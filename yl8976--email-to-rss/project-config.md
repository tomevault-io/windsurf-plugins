# Detailed Project Implementation Plan

This section is a top-level "blueprint" describing the solution architecture and how each component fits together.

## Overview

**Goal:** Build a service that turns email newsletters into RSS feeds, so you can subscribe in an RSS reader like Reeder. The service should provide unique email addresses per feed, a front-end admin panel, indefinite (or long-term) storage of newsletters, and minimal cost—preferably using Cloudflare services plus ForwardEmail.net.

## Key Components

1. **ForwardEmail.net**
   - Accept incoming newsletters on your custom domain’s email addresses.
   - Forward them (via webhook) to your API endpoint for processing.
   - Free inbound plan includes JSON + raw MIME data.
2. **Cloudflare Workers**
   - **Inbound Worker:** Receives the webhook from ForwardEmail.net, parses/stores newsletter data in KV (or R2).
   - **RSS Worker:** Serves RSS feeds by reading from KV and outputting XML.
   - **Admin Worker (potential):** Could serve a small UI or JSON API for feed management.
3. **Cloudflare KV**
   - Key-value store for storing newsletter items (subject, date, HTML, etc.).
   - Minimal cost for text data.
   - Indefinite retention if you keep usage under limits.
4. **Cloudflare Pages (Optional)**
   - Could host a separate front-end for admin tasks.
   - Alternatively, build a simple admin UI directly within the Worker.
5. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Basic login and feed creation (generate random email addresses).
   - List newsletters and optionally delete them or rename feed titles.
   - For a simple approach, implement a minimal password-protected area or JSON endpoints.
6. **Domain / DNS Setup**
   - Use your custom domain (e.g. `mynewsletters.dev`).
   - Add DNS records so ForwardEmail.net is the MX handler.
   - Configure Cloudflare for general DNS (with “Orange Cloud” or not, depending on your proxying preferences).
   - Verify your domain following ForwardEmail.net’s instructions.

## Data Flow

1. A newsletter arrives at `newsletterXYZ@mynewsletters.dev`.
2. ForwardEmail.net triggers a webhook to `https://your-worker.example.com/api/inbound?feed=XYZ` with JSON + raw MIME.
3. The Worker parses the email, extracts relevant information (date, subject, HTML body), and stores it in KV under a key like `feed:XYZ:timestamp`.
4. When your RSS reader (e.g. Reeder) requests `GET https://your-worker.example.com/rss/XYZ`, the Worker fetches all items from KV for that feed, builds an RSS XML response, and returns it.
5. *(Optional)* The Admin Dashboard (via a password-protected route or a separate Cloudflare Pages front-end) can create new feed IDs, display items, etc.

## Summary of Implementation Steps

1. Set up the Domain and ForwardEmail.net for inbound mail.
2. Create a Cloudflare Worker to handle the inbound webhook.
3. Parse the email (using ForwardEmail.net’s parsed data or parsing the raw MIME if necessary).
4. Store the data in KV.
5. Create an RSS Worker endpoint to retrieve the data and output XML.
6. *(Optional)* Develop an Admin UI to create new feeds, list items, and manage them.
7. Deploy and test the solution. Subscribe to the feed with Reeder.
