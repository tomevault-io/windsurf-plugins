## Purpose

Garu is a browser-first, lightweight Korean morphological analyzer. The core research goal is to keep the analyzer practical for client-side use while approaching server-grade analyzers in accuracy.

Primary constraints:

- Runs fully offline in the browser through WASM.
- Ships model files inside the npm package; do not require CDN or server calls.
- Keep inference cheap: prefer lookup tables, Viterbi, compact rules, caches, and small quantized models.
- Treat model size, latency, and F1 as a single tradeoff. Accuracy gains that make browser delivery impractical are not acceptable by default.

## Source Priority

- `CLAUDE.md` is the current operational snapshot for architecture, file map, commands, and local rules.
- `docs/paper.md` is the research narrative: why earlier approaches failed, how each optimization helped, and what open research directions remain.
- Code, model artifacts, and fresh benchmark output override both documents when they disagree.
- If reporting metrics externally, rerun or cite the exact benchmark command and dataset split. The paper and `CLAUDE.md` contain different historical metric snapshots.

## Current Architecture

Pipeline:

```text
input text
  -> sentence-level lattice construction
     - FST content-word dictionary
     - suffix codebook
     - smart eojeol cache as low-cost arcs
     - typo-tolerant OOV arcs
  -> trigram N-best Viterbi decoding
  -> postprocessing rules
     - VCP split
     - VX/JC/JKC/NNB/XSN/XPN/MM/XSV/XSA corrections
  -> CNN reranking / agreement scoring
  -> token output
```

Important model pieces:

- `codebook.gmdl` / `js/models/base.gmdl`: GMDL binary model with FST dictionary, suffix codebook, sparse trigram costs, word-bigram adjustments, parameters, and smart eojeol cache.
- `cnn2.bin`: small int8 1D CNN used for reranking and POS correction.
- `crates/garu-core/src/model.rs`: analyzer orchestration.
- `crates/garu-core/src/codebook.rs`: lattice construction, Viterbi, cache injection, and postprocessing.
- `crates/garu-core/src/cnn.rs`: quantized CNN inference.
- `crates/garu-core/src/trie.rs`: FST dictionary and multi-POS packing.
- `crates/garu-core/src/types.rs`: Sejong POS tags.
- `crates/garu-wasm/src/lib.rs`: WASM bindings.
- `js/src/index.ts`: public JS/TS API.

## Research Lessons

Do not restart from approaches already shown to be poor fits unless the goal is explicitly to reproduce or disprove them:

- BiLSTM distillation failed because matrix-heavy inference is not browser-friendly.
- Jamo-level sequence labeling failed because it lengthened sequences and destroyed useful syllable-level signals.
- Ambiguity-table expansion hurt accuracy by adding too many noisy candidates.
- Self-learning frequency loops did not converge reliably.
- Perceptron POS reranking produced only tiny gains because many remaining errors are segmentation errors.
- Decomposition preference penalties increased over-segmentation.
- Cost-scale normalization did not improve over tuned parameters.

Strong historical wins:

- Switching from Kiwi-derived output to NIKL gold-derived codebook patterns was the largest improvement.
- Lowering `morpheme_penalty` made multi-morpheme suffix patterns usable.
- Removing noisy Wikipedia NNP entries improved both size and accuracy.
- Multi-POS FST, sparse trigram quantization, and word-bigram costs gave small but clean gains.
- Smart eojeol cache broke the codebook-only ceiling by caching high-correction-value words, not merely frequent words.
- Contextual postprocessing rules gave free accuracy without growing the model.
- Sentence-level Viterbi allows cached analyses to be overridden by stronger sentence context.
- N-best Viterbi plus CNN agreement scoring is the main current path for better ambiguity handling.

## Research Priorities

Prefer work that targets known residual error classes:

- Segmentation errors: the dominant remaining error source. Investigate Viterbi top-N candidates, CNN reranking, and candidate generation changes that can actually change boundaries.
- POS ambiguity: continue using sentence context, word-bigram rules, CNN confidence, and targeted postprocessing.
- OOV and neologisms: explore syllable-pattern or CNN-assisted POS inference without adding large neural inference cost.
- Typos and spacing noise: improve typo arcs, noisy training, and pre/postprocessing while measuring clean-text regressions.
- Domain robustness: compare same-domain, split, and cross-domain NIKL results. Do not optimize only one split.
- Model-size discipline: record size deltas for every model or dictionary change.

## Experiment Protocol

Before changing the analyzer, identify:

- The exact error type being targeted.
- Baseline F1 and model size.
- The expected mechanism of improvement.
- The rollback criterion if accuracy, size, or speed regresses.

After changing the analyzer, check at least the focused failure examples and one aggregate benchmark. For broad model changes, compare:

- Gold testset F1.
- NIKL MP F1 when the dataset is available.
- Model gzip size.
- WASM/package impact if the change touches public delivery.
