- This is the Next.js 15 project using React 19.
- The project is using Tailwind CSS for styling.
- The project is using Shadcn UI for components. Do everything using shadcn whenever possible.

- Every single time we need to run a shadcn command, use `npx shadcn@latest`

- It's Next.js so use Server Components when possible
- Use server actions when possible
- Use Next.js 15

- If you generating validation schemas, forms, actions, working with db - THEN ALWAYS use the database schema from @/lib/db/schema.ts as A SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
- NEVER MODIFY OR REMOVE ANYTHING FROM THE DATABASE SCHEMA, UNLESS I EXPLICITLY TELL YOU TO DO SO.
