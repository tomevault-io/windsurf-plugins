# OpenTK Model Context Protocol Server

## Project Concept

The OpenTK project is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to Dutch parliamentary data through a standardized interface. It serves as a bridge between large language models (LLMs) and the Dutch Parliament's information systems, allowing AI assistants to search, retrieve, and analyze parliamentary documents, debates, and member information.

The server uses the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to implement the MCP specification, which enables structured communication between AI models and external data sources. By exposing parliamentary data through well-defined tools and endpoints, OpenTK makes it possible for AI assistants to:

1. Search for parliamentary documents using complex queries
2. Access information about Members of Parliament
3. Retrieve official documents in various formats
4. Analyze parliamentary activities and proceedings
5. Track legislative cases and government pledges

The project leverages Bert Hubert's tkconv service as its primary data source, which provides a more accessible API than the official Dutch Parliament APIs.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure:

```

├── package.json                # Project dependencies and scripts
└── tsconfig.json               # TypeScript configuration
```

## API Service Endpoints

The `ApiService` class in `src/services/api.ts` provides the core functionality for interacting with the tkconv API. Here are the key methods:

### 1. `fetchJson<T>(path: string, options?: RequestInit): Promise<T>`
- Fetches and parses JSON data from the API
- Handles error cases and content type validation
- Used for structured data endpoints

### 2. `fetchHtml(path: string, options?: RequestInit): Promise<string>`
- Retrieves HTML content from the API
- Used for document pages, MP profiles, and other HTML-based content

### 3. `fetchBinary(path: string, options?: RequestInit): Promise<{ data: ArrayBuffer, contentType: string }>`
- Downloads binary data such as PDFs and images
- Returns both the data and content type for proper handling

### 4. `search<T>(query: string, options?: { twomonths?: boolean, soorten?: string }): Promise<T>`
- Performs searches across parliamentary data
- Supports complex queries with quotes, NOT operators, etc.
- Includes fallback mechanisms for handling API errors

### 5. `resolveExternal(extId: string): Promise<string>`
- Resolves external reference IDs to direct URLs
- Tries multiple approaches to find the correct URL

### 6. `fetchSitemap(path: string): Promise<string[]>`
- Retrieves lists of URLs for specific time periods
- Supports yearly, half-yearly, and monthly sitemaps

### 7. `getPersons(): Promise<any[]>`
- Fetches a list of all current Members of Parliament
- Extracts structured data from HTML responses

### 8. `getPerson(id: number): Promise<any | null>`
- Retrieves detailed information about a specific MP
- Parses HTML to extract structured data

## MCP Tools

The MCP server exposes the following tools to AI assistants:

### Search Tools
1. `search_tk` - Comprehensive search across all parliamentary data
2. `search_tk_filtered` - Search filtered by document type (Document, Activiteit, Zaak)

### Document Tools
3. `get_document_html` - Retrieves document content in HTML format
4. `download_document` - Downloads the actual document file (usually PDF)
5. `get_document_metadata` - Retrieves metadata about a document

### MP Information Tools
6. `get_mp_list` - Lists all current Members of Parliament
7. `get_mp_details` - Retrieves detailed information about a specific MP
8. `get_photo` - Retrieves an MP's official portrait photograph

### Navigation Tools
9. `get_sitemap_year` - Provides a list of all parliamentary content URLs for a specific year
10. `get_sitemap_half_year` - URLs for a half-year period
11. `get_sitemap_month` - URLs for a specific month
12. `resolve_external` - Converts parliamentary reference IDs into direct URLs

### Specialized Content Tools
13. `get_toezegging` - Information about government pledges
14. `get_case` - Details about parliamentary cases

## Search Functionality

The search functionality is particularly sophisticated, supporting:

- Simple keyword searches: `kunstmatige intelligentie`
- Exact phrase searches: `"kunstmatige intelligentie"`
- Exclusion searches: `Hubert NOT Bruls`
- Boolean operators: `OR`, `NEAR()`
