Rootbeer is a rust library and command line tool that executes a user-provided
lua script in a sandboxed environment, creating a system configuration. Think of
it akin to a dotfile manager like home-manager or chezmoi.

- `crates/rootbeer-cli`: The command line tool the user interacts with
- `crates/rootbeer-core`: The core library that runs the lua script
- `crates/rootbeer-store`: Shared content hashing and normalized storage
- `crates/rootbeer-package`: Package models, recipe parsing, graph, resolution, and installation
- `crates/rootbeer-build`: Build plans, backend phases, execution, and build caching
- `crates/rootbeer-packaging`: Discovery, qualification, signing, and publication
- `crates/rootbeer-forge`: The package-maintainer CLI (`rootbeer-forge`)

Configuration must not depend on the build or packaging crates. Backends produce
phases for the shared build executor. Coordinate recipe schema changes with the index repository and its engine pin.

Production package recipes belong exclusively in `rootbeer-index/packages/`.
Rootbeer contains generic package tooling and regression tests; never embed or
duplicate production recipes in this repository.

## Package CI and Publication

- Verify changed package inputs once on each supported platform, then promote
  those exact verified artifacts through merge and publication without rebuilding.
- Reuse verified results for unaffected packages. Scope invalidation to changed
  recipes, dependencies, relevant backend/executor behavior, and build environments;
  an unrelated engine change must not force a full-catalog rebuild.
- Do not run a cold baseline build merely to warm caches before a PR, or stack
  baseline, PR, and post-merge full builds for the same publication. Check artifact
  promotion eligibility and cache reuse before triggering expensive CI.
- Retry only failed or affected work, preserving completed results. Reserve full
  requalification for scheduled/explicit rechecks or changes that actually affect
  the entire catalog. Never bypass integrity or provenance checks to save CI time.
- If current tooling prevents reuse, identify and fix that limitation rather than
  treating repeated full builds as a routine prerequisite for adding packages.

User configuration is provided through a layering system in the core library,
where the base fundamentals (such as symlinking files, creating new files,
running commands, etc.) are provided by the library, callable from the user's
lua script.

Because the lua scripts are meant to run with 0 external dependencies, the core
library also builds up fundamentals such as JSON serialization, string formats,
and more (akin to Nix's stdlib).

The highest API layer is mostly defined in Lua and wraps the lower level APIs
in nice types, functions, and design patterns. For example, a `zsh` module is
defined in the highest layer which consumes the lower level APIs, allowing the
user to follow a nicely typed API to manage their zsh configuration.

This pattern needs to remain consistent across all modules and there are a few
different tools built around these assumptions defined below.

## Require Syntax

Standard Lua dot-separated require paths are used **everywhere** — stdlib
modules, user scripts, docs, and examples:

- `require("rootbeer.git")` — dot syntax, used in **all** code.
- `require("helper")` — resolves from the user's source directory.

A Rust-level require wrapper in `vm.rs` translates dot paths to Luau-native
`@`-prefixed paths before they reach Luau's C++ layer. This is a hidden
implementation detail — all Lua files look like vanilla Lua and work with
lua-language-server without special configuration. Never use `@`-prefixed
paths in `.lua` files.

The LSP setup (`rb lsp` / `rb init`) writes type definitions to
`~/.local/share/rootbeer/typedefs/` and a `.luarc.json` with
`workspace.library` pointing there. A generated `init.lua` lets
`require("rootbeer")` resolve to the `rootbeer` class type. No LuaLS plugin
is needed — standard `workspace.library` resolution handles everything.

- I/O operations run in a plan/execute mode, where calls only append to a log of
  operations that need to be executed on the apply stage.
- High-level Lua modules (zsh, git, ssh, …) MUST iterate user-supplied maps
  with `rootbeer.tbl.sorted_pairs` (not `pairs`) so generated output is
  deterministic across runs. Multi-line user input MUST be split with
  `rootbeer.str.split_lines` (not `gmatch("[^\n]+")`) so blank lines are
  preserved. See `docs/contributing/architecture.md` → "Authoring Principles"
  for the full convention.
- The lua language server is used to automatically generate markdown docs for
  the documentation site defined in the `docs` directory (built with Vitepress).
  The `docs/api/_generated/` directory is auto-generated from `lua/rootbeer/*.lua`
  meta files via `scripts/lua2md.ts`. NEVER hand-edit files in `_generated/` and
  NEVER manually write API field tables in doc pages. Instead, update or create
  the corresponding `lua/rootbeer/*.lua` meta file with `@class`/`@field`
  annotations, and use `<!--@include: ../api/_generated/<name>.md-->` in the doc
  page (also taking care to ensure the path is added to the sidebar if necessary).
