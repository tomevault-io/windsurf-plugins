# Yamada UI Development Guide

Yamada UI is a React UI component library built with CSS-in-JS (Emotion).

## Critical Rules

- **Do not add unnecessary tests**: Do not add or update tests just because files were changed. Tests are required only when the change introduces a new branch, contract, observable behavior, or regression path that is not already verified by existing tests in the same package or dependent units. If existing tests already cover the affected behavior, do not add unnecessary tests.
- **Accessibility is required**: All components must support ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen readers. Report any concerns.
- **Do not bundle multiple fixes**: If you encounter a separate issue while working on a fix, do not fix it in the same PR. Create a separate issue and submit a separate PR.
- **Do not run format, lint, or typecheck unless explicitly asked**: Format, lint and typecheck are handled by lefthook on commit. However, run tests for the changed files locally to verify that the implementation works correctly.
- **Do not write comments**: JSDoc and comments that suppress linter or formatter errors are allowed, but all other comments are not. Programs that require comments to be understood should have their structure questioned. Programs must be simple and immediately understandable by reading the code itself.
