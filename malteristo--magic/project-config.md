# Copy-Paste Command Formatting

When generating shell commands for the Mage to run manually (on the Mac Mini, in a separate terminal, etc.):

- Always format commands in a fenced code block with `bash` language tag
- Chain related commands with `&&` so they can be pasted as a single block
- Include an `echo` confirmation at the end so the Mage can see it worked
- Never mix instructions and commands — put the explanation BEFORE the code block, not inside it
- If a sequence has conditional steps (if X then do Y), provide separate copy-paste blocks for each path
- Assume the Mage will copy the entire block and paste it verbatim — it must work without editing
