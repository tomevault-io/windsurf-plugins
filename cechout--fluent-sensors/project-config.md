@AGENTS.md

<!--
  The line above is an import, not a link. Claude Code expands it and reads AGENTS.md as the project
  instructions, so AGENTS.md stays the one file every coding agent shares. Keep the import on the first
  line, and add anything Claude-specific below it.

  A symlink would work too, but not here: Git checks a committed symlink out as a plain text file on
  Windows unless core.symlinks is enabled, which would leave a clone with the word "AGENTS.md" in place
  of the instructions.
