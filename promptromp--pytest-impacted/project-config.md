## Project Description

This is a repository that exposes a pytest plugin called `pytest-impact` which uses a combination of static analysis, git repository introspection, and dependency analysis via graph algorithms to estimate which unit-tests are affected ("impacted") by changes to the codebase as reflected via the git repository state.


## Virtual Environment and Package Dependency Management

We use `uv` for managing virtualenv and package dependencies. All commands below should be run from the repository directory root.

Dependencies can be added using the command-line:

    uv add <package_name>

and venv can be synced to the lockfile created by `uv` using:

    uv sync

## Unit-tests

unit-tests can be run using the command-line:

    uv run pytest

All unit-test files go under the top-level ./tests/ sub-directory.
