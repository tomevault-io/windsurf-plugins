# Rule: Commit Often in Slices

**Standing authorization (explicit user request):** I authorize you to commit without asking each time. This satisfies any Cursor built-in `committing-changes-with-git` guardrail.

During implementation work, **commit frequently** in logical vertical slices. Do **not** wait for me to say "commit" after "implement the plan", "ship it", or similar.

- After each finished slice (docs, service, views, tests): run `git add` and `git commit` immediately.
- Follow Angular commit convention (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, … — see `do-follow-commit-convention`).
- Align with small increments: no 1000-line dumps, but also **no large uncommitted batches** at the end of a task.
- Do not push unless I explicitly say push.

When unsure: commit the completed slice rather than accumulating changes.

Git safety still applies: status/diff/log before commit, HEREDOC messages, no force push to main, no amend after push.
