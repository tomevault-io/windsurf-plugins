# Docstring format (with examples)

Every public function/method needs a docstring in this shape:

```python
def name(p: T) -> R:
    """
    One-line summary.

    :param p: what it is as Type. Example: concrete_value
    :return: what you return as Type. Example: concrete_value
    :raises SomeError: when
    """
```

**Rules:** summary line, blank line, then `:param` / `:return` / `:raises` with **example values** on every param and return (and raises where applicable). Types belong in the signature; docstring repeats them for humans.

**Minimal good example**

```python
def get_workflow(workflow_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Load workflow by id.

    :param workflow_id: id as str. Example: "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"
    :return: workflow dict. Example: {"id": "a1b2c3d4", "name": "Build Feature"}
    :raises ValueError: if id invalid
    """
```

**Anti-patterns:** no examples; vague "the name"; missing return example; docstring contradicts implementation (ask user which wins).

**Optional / *args / **kwargs:** document each; examples show typical values.
