*When asked to create an Issue:*
**Main idea: we are creating a task for the person with very little knowledge of the domain, and very little interest to learn. Therefore we have to create a very detailed to do, giving the person very little space to misinterpret what needs to be done.**

User will tell you what we are creating:
Feature - Page (described by Feature) with set of Component (described by Scenarios), Scenario (default), Enhancement (change of existing Feature/Scenario), Bug, Refactoring, Infra.

1. Add a label for the issue: 
a) Feature, Scenario, Enhancement, Bug, Refactoring, Infra.
c) easy (simple scenario/screen/modal/component)-medium(avdanced scenario/component/combination of components)-hard(entire feature/page/combination of components/service)
2. Start name with the Scenario prefix when available, like "LOG1.1: Scenario A" etc. 
3. Transfer scenario content to description.
4. If there is plan for the scenario/features in docs/plans - add plan contents, as approved by the user, to the description. Keep in mind that your developer needs checklist-style guidance giving them a chance to do the right thing even though they can be too lazy to read the docs or to understand them.
5. Before creating issue - check if issue with this prefix already exists. If yes - stop and inform user.

*When asked to update an Issue:*
**Main idea: all people working on the issue need to be able to understand what was done, why, and what you intend to do next.**
1. Always associate a commit. 
2. List what was done and why. 
3. If we deviated from the initial plan - explain why (user directions, technical setback etc.).
4. Briefly state what next steps are.
5. Update the plan in the checklist - mark done (add what was done but was not in the plan), add/update next steps if necessary.
6. Before performing an update - summarize to the user what you will post, and ask for approval.
