**Mimir metadata:** slug `do-assert-log-story`; `always_apply: false` (link to BPE-02 / MIN-04 / TFK-02).

When a plan or iteration manifest declares a **Log Story Script** (or `log_story_script[]` / `log_tests[]`), you MUST prove those beats with pytest `caplog` (or equivalent log capture) — not by grepping `logs/app.log` alone, and not by “logging statements exist” checklists.

## Requirements

1. For each Log Story Script row, a test asserts the `where` + `beat` + `must_include` fragments appear in captured logs at the declared level (default INFO; WARNING/ERROR when the script says so).
2. Cover **happy** and **reject** paths when the scenario has both (`test_*_log_story_happy` / `test_*_log_story_reject`).
3. Use the shared helper from skill *Pytest Log Story Assertions* (`tests/support/log_story.py` → `assert_log_story(...)`) once TFK-02 has bootstrapped it.
4. Log-story tests ship in the **same commit** as behavior green — never a deferred logging slice.
5. Never assert on raw secrets, tokens, or passwords in log lines.

## Anti-patterns

- Behavior test green while log story absent or weakened to `logger.info("done")`
- Manual `logs/app.log` inspection as the only DoD for observability
- Skipping `checkpoint.log_story_command` when the manifest lists `log_tests`
