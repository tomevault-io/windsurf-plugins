# Rule: Plan Before Doing

1. Read the feature or spec in full.
2. If you need new packages, pick one path with the user when multiple fit; update `requirements.txt` when adding dependencies.
3. Assess the codebase: what exists, what must change, what must be added. Do not trust signature + docstring alone—open the body; you may find `TODO` or `NotImplementedError`.
4. Scan `docs/architecture/`; note doc vs code drift and ask the user to resolve.
5. Write a step-by-step plan (models, APIs, services, views, **tests**, templates, styles).
6. **Show the plan and get approval or refinements before coding.**
7. **After each step:** update the plan, show where you stand, state the next step, then implement.
8. When reality diverges (e.g. missing API you assumed), revise the plan and repeat from step 6.
