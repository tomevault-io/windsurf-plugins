# Cursor Agent Entry Point

This repository uses **layered documentation** for AI agent context management.

## Start Here

1. **AGENTS.md** (root) - Coding rules, architecture boundaries, and constraints
2. **DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md** (root) - How docs are organized and how to navigate

## Documentation Layers

| Layer | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Principles | `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` | Stable rules, always loaded |
| Architecture | `docs/architecture/` | System design |
| Implementation | `docs/implementation/` | Active plans |
| History | `docs/implementation/history/` | Past decisions |
| Guides | `docs/guides/` | Reference docs |

## Quick Navigation

- **Multi-agent orchestration?** → Use `.skills/quest/` skill
- **Building a feature?** → Use `.skills/implementer/` skill
- **Reviewing an implementation plan?** → Use `.skills/plan-reviewer/` skill
- **Reviewing code?** → Use `.skills/code-reviewer/` skill
- **Understanding the system?** → Start with `docs/architecture/` if present

## Skills

This repository uses **skills** for specialized workflows. Skills are automatically discovered and used based on task context:

- **quest:** Multi-agent orchestration for features
- **plan-reviewer:** Review implementation plans and PR specifications for test coverage
- **code-reviewer:** Review actual code for quality, security, and patterns
- **implementer:** Step-by-step implementation with traceability

See `.skills/BOOTSTRAP.md` for how to use skills with different AI platforms.

This structure reduces context pollution and keeps agents grounded in authoritative sources.
