# Swift macOS Development Guidelines for CodeLooper

This document provides guidance for AI assistants when working with the CodeLooper Swift macOS application.

## Project Overview

CodeLooper is a Swift macOS menu bar application that provides automation and workflow enhancement capabilities. The project uses:

- **Swift Package Manager (SPM)** for dependency management
- **SwiftUI** for modern UI components
- **AppKit** for traditional macOS functionality
- **AXorcist** accessibility framework integration
- **Swift 6.0** with strict concurrency checking

## Architecture Overview

- **Application Layer** (`Sources/Application/`): Core app lifecycle, delegates, and coordination
- **Components** (`Sources/Components/`): SwiftUI views, alerts, and UI components
- **Diagnostics** (`Sources/Diagnostics/`): Logging, error handling, and debugging
- **Settings** (`Sources/Settings/`): User preferences and configuration
- **StatusBar** (`Sources/StatusBar/`): Menu bar interface and icon management
- **Utilities** (`Sources/Utilities/`): Helper functions, extensions, and shared utilities

## Code Quality Standards

### SwiftLint Configuration
- Use the project's `.swiftlint.yml` configuration
- **CRITICAL**: Preserve explicit `self.` references for Swift 6 concurrency compliance
- The `redundant_self` rule is disabled to maintain capture semantics
- Run `./run-swiftlint.sh` to check compliance

### Swift 6 Concurrency
- Use `@MainActor` for UI-related code
- Add explicit `self.` in closures to satisfy capture semantics
- Handle `Sendable` conformance properly
- Use structured concurrency (`async`/`await`) over callbacks

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive variable names (avoid single letters like `i`, `x`, `y`)
- Function names should be clear and self-documenting
- Follow Swift API design guidelines

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Build the project
swift build

# Run SwiftLint
./run-swiftlint.sh

# Run SwiftFormat
./run-swiftformat.sh

# Generate Xcode project (via Tuist)
./scripts/generate-xcproj.sh

# Open in Xcode
./scripts/open-xcode.sh

# Run the application
./scripts/run-app.sh
```

## Accessibility Integration

The project integrates with **AXorcist** for macOS accessibility automation:

- Located in `AXorcist/` submodule
- Provides UI element querying and interaction
- Requires accessibility permissions
- Use `axorc` command-line tool for testing

## File Organization Guidelines

### New Swift Files
- Place in appropriate source directory based on functionality
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Include proper import statements
- Follow existing code organization patterns

### Extensions
- Place utility extensions in `Sources/Utilities/Extensions/`
- Keep extensions focused on single responsibilities
- Use `// MARK:` comments for organization

### SwiftUI Components
- Place in `Sources/Components/SwiftUI/`
- Use `@MainActor` for view models
- Follow SwiftUI best practices for state management

## Debugging and Logging

### Diagnostic System
- Use the project's `Logger` class for consistent logging
- Different log levels: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`
- Category-based logging via `LogCategory`
- File-based logging available via `FileLogger`

### Debug Patterns
```swift
import Diagnostics

// Use the logger
private let logger = Logger(category: .application)

// Log with context
logger.info("Starting application setup")
logger.error("Failed to initialize: \(error)")
```

## Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use macOS Keychain for sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow principle of least privilege for permissions

## Performance Guidelines

- Use lazy initialization where appropriate
- Avoid blocking the main thread
- Use background queues for heavy operations
- Profile memory usage in Instruments

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests should go in `Tests/`
- Use XCTest framework
- Mock external dependencies
- Test accessibility features with AXorcist tools

## Agent Operational Guidelines

### When Working on This Project
1. **Always check SwiftLint** after making changes
2. **Preserve `self.` references** in closures for Swift 6 compliance
3. **Use TodoWrite tool** to track complex tasks
4. **Read existing code** to understand patterns before implementing
5. **Check for similar implementations** in the codebase first

### Common Patterns to Follow
- Use `@MainActor` for UI code
- Implement proper error handling with `Result` types
- Use structured concurrency over completion handlers
- Follow the existing diagnostic logging patterns

### Before Submitting Changes
1. Run SwiftLint: `./run-swiftlint.sh`
2. Run SwiftFormat: `./run-swiftformat.sh`
3. Verify build: `swift build`
4. Test functionality manually if UI changes

This guide ensures consistent, high-quality Swift code that follows the project's established patterns and requirements.
