# Agent Notes for via

This file captures project-specific conventions, gotchas, and workflows that are
useful when working on via with AI coding agents. It complements the
human-facing README.

## Testing

### Run the full local check

```bash
bash scripts/test-nvim.sh   # headless Neovim Lua tests
cargo test                  # Rust unit tests
cargo test --examples       # mock ACP agent example tests
mise fmt-fix
```

For manual ACP modal queue UX testing, run `cargo build --example
mock_acp_agent` first, then build and spawn
`examples/mock_acp_agent acp` (typed SDK agent; trailing `acp` required for ACP
classification) — see CONTRIBUTING.md "Manual testing: mock ACP agent".

### Stress-test parallel-sensitive Rust tests

Tests that mutate process-wide state (e.g. `VIA_SESSION` via
`std::env::set_var`) are racy under parallel `cargo test`. After changing them,
run with extra threads repeatedly:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  cargo test 'assign_to_human|run_review' -- --test-threads=16 || break
done
```

Use the global `test_support::env_lock()` mutex to serialize env-mutating tests.

### Headless Neovim Lua test gotchas

- Scratch buffers (`nvim_create_buf(false, true)`) automatically clear
  `vim.bo.modified`. If a test asserts on the modified flag, create a
  normal-like buffer with `buftype = ""` and a name.
- Prefer `vim.split(text, "\n", { plain = true })` over `gmatch("[^\n]*")`; the
  latter yields a trailing empty line and causes round-trip drift.
- Test fixtures should mirror the real buffer's options. The `:ViaTasks` board
  uses `filetype = "via-tasks"` / `buftype = "nofile"` / `readonly = true`; task
  bodies open in unlisted floating buffers (`bufhidden = "wipe"`).

## UI / Buffer Editing Conventions

### Task board vs task body

- **`:ViaTasks` board is read-only.** It lists tasks from `via task list`; use
  `gR`, `gn`, `gb`, and `gc` for refresh / board / create actions. Do not edit
  rows in the board buffer — there is no `:w` save path from the board.
- **Task Markdown opens in a centered float** (`<CR>` on `via:<id>`). That popup
  is a normal writable buffer backed by the task file on disk; `:w` persists
  edits via the usual file write path.

## Rust

### Module layout

- Define types (`struct`, `enum`, and their `impl` blocks) at the top of the
  file: public items first, then `pub(super)` / crate-private, then module-private
  helpers. Functions and free helpers follow the type definitions.

### Environment variables in tests

- `std::env::set_var` / `remove_var` are process-global and unsafe to call from
  parallel tests without synchronization.
- Use `crate::test_support::env_lock()` to serialize env-mutating tests.
- Treat env mutation in tests as a design smell: prefer passing context
  explicitly when the code under test allows it.
