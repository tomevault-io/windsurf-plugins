# Agent Guide

## Quick Reference

- **Backend:** `aws-blocks/index.ts` — APIs, auth, data models
- **Frontend:** `src/` — imports backend APIs via `import { api } from 'aws-blocks'`
- **Tests:** `test/e2e.test.ts` — run with `npm run test:e2e`
- **AWS Blocks docs** ship inside the `@aws-blocks/blocks` package. Find the docs folder once: `node -p "require('path').dirname(require.resolve('@aws-blocks/blocks/docs/README.md'))"` (fallback: `node_modules/@aws-blocks/blocks/docs`). Read everything relative to it: `README.md` (dev guide + catalog + decision tree — start here), then `<block>/README.md`, plus `<block>/API.md` and `<block>/DESIGN.md` where present.

## Framework model

These are the load-bearing facts about how a Blocks app fits together. Knowing them up front means you do **not** have to reverse-engineer the wiring or read every block doc before you can build.

### Backend defines APIs; the frontend imports the same names as a typed client

- The backend (`aws-blocks/index.ts`) declares each API with `new ApiNamespace(scope, '<name>', (context) => ({ ...methods }))`, and auth with `auth.createApi()`. You `export` them (e.g. `export const api = …`, `export const authApi = auth.createApi()`).
- The frontend imports those **same export names** from `'aws-blocks'`:

  ```ts
  import { api, authApi } from 'aws-blocks';
  const todos = await api.listTodos();          // typed, awaited call
  ```

  At runtime that import resolves to an auto-generated **client proxy** (`aws-blocks/client.js`), not the server module — the types come from your backend, the transport is injected. **The JSON-RPC transport is invisible: never build request payloads by hand or `fetch()` the API directly** (only for one-off connectivity troubleshooting). Just import the namespace and call the method.
- **Pitfall:** do not `import ... from '../aws-blocks/index.ts'` in a script/test to call the API — that gives you the *server* definition object, which behaves differently from the client. Import from `'aws-blocks'` (the package name) so you get the client, exactly as `src/` does.

### Methods are namespaced

A call is always `namespace.method(...)` — e.g. `api.createTodo(title)`, `api.listTodos()`. The namespace is the string you passed as the **second** argument to `new ApiNamespace(scope, '<name>', …)`. A bare method name with no namespace will not resolve. (Auth is the same shape but pre-built: `authApi` exposes `getAuthState`/`setAuthState` — sign-up is `authApi.setAuthState({ action: 'signUp', … })`, not a bare `signUp`.)

### Auth is a Building Block, not hand-rolled

Get the current user inside a method with `await auth.requireAuth(context)` (throws if unauthenticated — put it at the top of a protected method). On the frontend, mount the ready-made UI from `@aws-blocks/blocks/ui`:

```ts
import { Authenticator, onAuthChange } from '@aws-blocks/blocks/ui';
authContainer.appendChild(Authenticator(authApi));
onAuthChange(authApi, (user) => { /* re-render for signed-in/out */ });
```

`AuthBasic` without a `codeDelivery` config signs a user in immediately on sign-up (no email confirmation step).

### The deployed frontend finds the backend on its own

You do **not** wire an API URL into the frontend. The imported client resolves the API endpoint itself at runtime: locally, the dev server serves the backend and its config together (`npm run dev` in a fresh app, or `npm run dev:server` when Blocks was added to an existing project; it exposes `/.blocks-sandbox/config.json`); once deployed, the client reads the config served from the hosting origin, where the frontend and API sit same-origin. So build against the imported client and let the framework resolve the URL — don't hardcode one or curl-hunt for the API base.

### Minimal end-to-end example

```ts
// aws-blocks/index.ts (backend)
import { ApiNamespace, Scope } from '@aws-blocks/blocks';
const scope = new Scope('my-app');
export const api = new ApiNamespace(scope, 'api', (context) => ({
  async ping(name: string) { return { message: `hi ${name}` }; },
}));
```

```ts
// src/index.ts (frontend)
import { api } from 'aws-blocks';
const res = await api.ping('world');   // { message: 'hi world' }
```

## Workflow

1. Make changes to backend (`aws-blocks/index.ts`) or frontend (`src/`)
2. Test with `npm run test:e2e` — starts a dev server automatically if one isn't running
3. For faster iteration: run `npm run dev &` in the background, then run `npm run test:e2e` repeatedly (reuses the running server)
4. Do NOT use curl/fetch against the API unless troubleshooting connectivity

## Rules

- **Use Building Blocks** for all persistence and cloud abstractions — never local files, in-memory arrays, or local databases.
- **To store data, reach for a storage Building Block** — `KVStore` for key–value, `DistributedTable` for a queryable table (rows + indexes). Both are constructed with a `Scope` and used inside your API methods; read their `README.md`/`API.md` (see the docs pointer above) for the exact API. The full catalog (auth, files, realtime, email, scheduled/async work, …) is in the docs `README.md`.
