# CloudFront WebACL Retention

When changing CDK infrastructure for CloudFront distributions, preserve the existing `webAclId` for protected stages (`prod` and `main`) instead of hardcoding a value in construct props.

- Resolve the current distribution WebACL from existing distribution state at deploy time.
- Reuse that resolved value when updating the distribution configuration.
- For `prod`/`main`, treat the existing console-managed WebACL as required external state.
- For `prod`/`main`, always set `DistributionConfig.WebACLId` from the resolved value path.
- Never synthesize protected-stage updates that omit `DistributionConfig.WebACLId`.
- Use fail-fast behavior if lookup cannot provide a non-empty value.
- Never use `AWS::NoValue` fallback for protected-stage `DistributionConfig.WebACLId`.
- Keep behavior unchanged for non-protected stages.

## Why

This prevents accidental WebACL detachment during CloudFront updates. For pricing-plan protected distributions, safety takes priority over convenience: deployment must fail fast if the existing console-managed WebACL cannot be resolved.

## Known Failure Mode To Avoid

For protected stages, fallback logic that uses `AWS::NoValue` for `DistributionConfig.WebACLId` is unsafe and must not be used.

- If lookup fails and `AWS::NoValue` is emitted, CloudFormation omits `WebACLId` from the update payload.
- Omitting `WebACLId` is interpreted as an attempt to remove/replace the current WebACL association.
- CloudFront pricing-plan protected distributions reject that update path with:
  `"You can't remove or replace the web ACL for your distribution..."`.
