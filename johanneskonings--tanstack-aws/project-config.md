## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Overview

TanStack AWS is a single TanStack Start (React SSR) application built with Vite + Nitro. It showcases TanStack libraries (Start, Router, DB, AI, Query, Store, Form, Table) with AWS services. There is no monorepo structure — one `package.json` at the root, pnpm as the package manager.

## Global conventions

- Use `vp` for package, build, lint, and test commands. Do not run `pnpm`, `npm`, or `yarn` directly.
- TypeScript: do not use `any` or `as` casts to silence type errors unless unavoidable and justified.
- Before completing substantial code changes, run `vp check` and `vp test`.

## Rules index

- CDK lifecycle + workflow stage handling: `.cursor/rules/cdk-stage-lifecycle.mdc`
- CloudFront/WAF retention behavior: `.cursor/rules/cdk-cloudfront-webacl-retention.mdc`

## Agent skills

Matt Pocock engineering skills live in `.agents/skills/`. Sync with `npx skills update -p` (or `vp dlx skills@latest update -p`). Restore from lockfile: `npx skills experimental_install`.

- **Setup**: run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` once after changing tracker or domain-doc layout.
- **Code review**: prefer `/code-review` (standards + spec). Use `/review-security` only for security-focused review.
- **Tests**: prefer `/tdd` for feature work; run `vp check` and `vp test` per global conventions below.

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues on `JohannesKonings/tanstack-aws`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five-role vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, but it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`.

## Vite+ Workflow

`vp` is a global binary that handles the full development lifecycle. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

### Start

- create - Create a new project from a template
- migrate - Migrate an existing project to Vite+
- config - Configure hooks and agent integration
- staged - Run linters on staged files
- install (`i`) - Install dependencies
- env - Manage Node.js versions

### Develop

- dev - Run the development server
- check - Run format, lint, and TypeScript type checks
- lint - Lint code
- fmt - Format code
- test - Run tests

### Execute

- run - Run monorepo tasks
- exec - Execute a command from local `node_modules/.bin`
- dlx - Execute a package binary without installing it as a dependency
- cache - Manage the task cache

### Build

- build - Build for production
- pack - Build libraries
- preview - Preview production build

### Manage Dependencies

Vite+ automatically detects and wraps the underlying package manager such as pnpm, npm, or Yarn through the `packageManager` field in `package.json` or package manager-specific lockfiles.

- add - Add packages to dependencies
- remove (`rm`, `un`, `uninstall`) - Remove packages from dependencies
- update (`up`) - Update packages to latest versions
- dedupe - Deduplicate dependencies
- outdated - Check for outdated packages
- list (`ls`) - List installed packages
- why (`explain`) - Show why a package is installed
- info (`view`, `show`) - View package information from the registry
- link (`ln`) / unlink - Manage local package links
- pm - Forward a command to the package manager

### Maintain

- upgrade - Update `vp` itself to the latest version

These commands map to their corresponding tools. For example, `vp dev --port 3000` runs Vite's dev server and works the same as Vite. `vp test` runs JavaScript tests through the bundled Vitest. The version of all tools can be checked using `vp --version`. This is useful when researching documentation, features, and bugs.
