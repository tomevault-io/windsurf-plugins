# CDK Stage Lifecycle Contract

Keep stage normalization and lifecycle behavior centralized so deploy, destroy, and promotion flows are deterministic.

- Normalize stage names through `lib/stage-name.ts`.
- Resolve workflow stage values through `scripts/resolve-stage.ts`; do not duplicate slug logic in workflow YAML.
- Workflow stage resolution contract:
  - Pass source ref/input explicitly with `--stage "<value>"`.
  - Write normalized output from `scripts/resolve-stage.ts` to workflow output, then set `APP_STAGE` from that output for CDK commands.
  - Source mapping:
    - `deploy-feature.yml`: `github.ref_name` + `--lifecycle ephemeral`
    - `deploy-main.yml`: `github.ref_name` + `--lifecycle permanent`
    - `deploy-prod.yml`: `github.event.inputs.stage` + `--lifecycle permanent`
    - `destroy-feature-on-merge.yml`: `github.event.pull_request.head.ref` + `--lifecycle ephemeral`
- Treat `main` and `prod` as permanent stages; all other stages are ephemeral.
- If a branch normalizes to a reserved permanent name, prefix it (for example `feature-main`) so it remains ephemeral.
- In `bin/app.ts`, classify lifecycle and instantiate the stack before applying ephemeral cleanup policies.
- For ephemeral stages, apply cleanup at app scope with `RemovalPolicies.of(app).destroy()` and `Mixins.of(app).apply(new s3Mixins.BucketAutoDeleteObjects())`.
- This mirrors `bin/app.ts`, where lifecycle is classified and cleanup mixins are applied at the app level.
- Keep stacks (for example `lib/tanstack-aws.ts`) focused on resource definition and avoid lifecycle-control props like `appLifecycle`.
- Destroy workflows must be idempotent: treat "stack does not exist" as successful cleanup.
- Cleanup can run for PRs merged into `main`; fork PR cleanup should safely no-op when no matching feature stack exists.
- Ephemeral cleanup has no resource-level exceptions: destroy all stack resources for ephemeral stages.

## Why

This prevents divergence between app bootstrap behavior, workflow stage resolution, and stack lifecycle policy.
