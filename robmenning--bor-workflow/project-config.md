---

This project will create a workflow managment service implemented with the Prefect orchestration engine (https://docs.prefect.io/v3/get-started). 
A top requirement is that this is a light and simple to admin implementation of Prefect.
The context is an early stage project composed of docker container services, that has a next.js web application (docker container: bor-app), a node express api (docker container: bor-api), a mysql 8 database (docker container: bor-db), a filestore ftp service (docker container: bor-files), and this workflow service (docker container: bor-workflow). 
All docker containers are running in separate processes in separate docker containers and are connected by a docker network called bor-network. 
The bor-files, bor-db, and this bor-workflow share at least one docker persistent volume to be used in ETL and data processing workflows by this project. 
This bor-workflow service will be responsible for two sub-services: 
  1. bor-workflow-db: a postgresql database in a docker container using the standard best practice implementation of the database required to host the prefect server using a docker volume to persist the dataf. 
  2. bor-etl-agent: a service for executing prefect workflows and tasks. 

Initial workflow:
This service will be used initially in the following business case: a simple ETL ingestion will: 
1. check for the existence of an import file in the persistent docker volume shared with bor-files and bor-db. 
2. execute the 'LOAD DATA INFILE' command to ingest the file into a staging table in the 'borarch' database in the bor-db contanerized database called 'FundClassFee'. 
3. execute the stored procedure bormeta.usp_FundClassFee_Load . 
A simple and flexible implementation is required because the team has minimal experience with Prefect and just wants a basic but capable framework for scheduling and managing data processing related
workflows..
The service will run in peroduction in a docker container called bor-workflow

** Workflows implemented by this project are documented in /.workflows. **

## prefect
The Prefect subsystem will use a containerized PostgreSQL database for orchestration state, following a simple, maintainable, and industry-standard architecture. The recommended production setup uses three containers:

### 1. Prefect Server/UI/API/CLI Container
- **Image:** Official Prefect image (`prefecthq/prefect:3-latest`)
- **Purpose:** Runs the Prefect server, UI, API, and CLI for orchestration, scheduling, and monitoring.
- **Ports:** Exposes 4640 (UI/API) to the host (e.g., `-p 4440:4200` for dev).
- **Management:** Start/stop with Docker (NOT Docker Compose). No custom ETL code or dependencies needed here.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d --rm \
    --name bor-workflow \
    --network bor-network \
    -p 4640:4200 \
    -e PREFECT_API_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://prefect:prefect@bor-workflow-db:5432/prefect" \
    prefecthq/prefect:3-latest \
    prefect server start --host 0.0.0.0
  ```

### 2. ETL Agent/Worker Container (Custom Image)
- **Image:** Custom image based on `prefecthq/prefect:3-latest`, with your ETL dependencies (e.g., `mysql-client`, `pandas`, `mysql-connector-python`, etc.) installed.
- **Purpose:** Runs the Prefect agent, which picks up and executes your ETL flows and tasks.
- **Management:** Build and run as a separate container. Register this image with your Prefect work pool for flow execution.
- **Example Dockerfile:**
  ```dockerfile
  FROM prefecthq/prefect:3-latest
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y mysql-client && \
      pip install pandas mysql-connector-python python-dotenv
  ```
- **Example run:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d --rm \
    --name bor-etl-agent \
    --network bor-network \
    -e PREFECT_API_URL="http://bor-workflow:4200/api" \
    custom-etl-image:latest \
    prefect agent start --work-pool 'default-agent-pool'
  ```

### 3. PostgreSQL Database Container (bor-workflow-db)
- **Image:** Official PostgreSQL image (e.g., `postgres:latest`)
- **Purpose:** Stores Prefect orchestration state and metadata.
- **Management:** Start/stop with Docker or Docker Compose. Data persisted via Docker volume.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name bor-workflow-db \
    --network bor-network \
    -v bor-workflow-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=prefect \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=prefect \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=prefect \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    postgres:latest
  ```

### Management and Usage
- All containers are connected via the `bor-network` Docker network for secure, internal communication.
