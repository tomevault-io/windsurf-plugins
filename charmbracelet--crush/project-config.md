# Crush Development Guide

## Project Overview

Crush is a terminal-based AI coding assistant built in Go by
[Charm](https://charm.land). It connects to LLMs and gives them tools to read,
write, and execute code. It supports multiple providers (Anthropic, OpenAI,
Gemini, Bedrock, Copilot, Hyper, MiniMax, Vercel, and more), integrates with
LSPs for code intelligence, and supports extensibility via MCP servers and
agent skills.

The module path is `github.com/charmbracelet/crush`.

## Architecture

```
main.go                            CLI entry point (cobra via internal/cmd)
internal/
  app/app.go                       Top-level wiring: DB, config, agents, LSP, MCP, events
  cmd/                             CLI commands (root, run, login, models, stats, sessions)
  config/
    config.go                      Config struct, context file paths, agent definitions
    load.go                        crush.json loading and validation
    provider.go                    Provider configuration and model resolution
  agent/
    agent.go                       SessionAgent: runs LLM conversations per session
    coordinator.go                 Coordinator: manages named agents ("coder", "task")
    hooked_tool.go                 Decorator that runs PreToolUse hooks before tool execution
    prompts.go                     Loads Go-template system prompts
    templates/                     System prompt templates (coder.md.tpl, task.md.tpl, etc.)
    tools/                         All built-in tools (bash, edit, view, grep, glob, etc.)
      mcp/                         MCP client integration
  hooks/                           Hook engine: runs user shell commands on hook events
    hooks.go                       Decision types, aggregation logic, event constants
    runner.go                      Parallel hook execution, timeout, dedup
    input.go                       Stdin payload builder, env vars, stdout parsing (Crush + Claude Code compat)
  session/session.go               Session CRUD backed by SQLite
  message/                         Message model and content types
  db/                              SQLite via sqlc, with migrations
    sql/                           Raw SQL queries (consumed by sqlc)
    migrations/                    Schema migrations
  lsp/                             LSP client manager, auto-discovery, on-demand startup
  ui/                              Bubble Tea v2 TUI (see internal/ui/AGENTS.md)
  permission/                      Tool permission checking and allow-lists
  skills/                          Skill file discovery and loading
  shell/                           Bash command execution with background job support
  event/                           Telemetry (PostHog)
  pubsub/                          Internal pub/sub for cross-component messaging
  filetracker/                     Tracks files touched per session
  history/                         Prompt history
```

### Key Dependency Roles

- **`charm.land/fantasy`**: LLM provider abstraction layer. Handles protocol
  differences between Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, etc. Used in `internal/app`
  and `internal/agent`.
- **`charm.land/bubbletea/v2`**: TUI framework powering the interactive UI.
- **`charm.land/lipgloss/v2`**: Terminal styling.
- **`charm.land/glamour/v2`**: Markdown rendering in the terminal.
- **`charm.land/catwalk`**: Snapshot/golden-file testing for TUI components.
- **`sqlc`**: Generates Go code from SQL queries in `internal/db/sql/`.

### Key Patterns

- **Config is a Service**: accessed via `config.Service`, not global state.
- **Tools are self-documenting**: each tool has a `.go` implementation and a
  `.md` description file in `internal/agent/tools/`.
- **System prompts are Go templates**: `internal/agent/templates/*.md.tpl`
  with runtime data injected.
- **Context files**: Crush reads AGENTS.md, CRUSH.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md
  (and `.local` variants) from the working directory for project-specific
  instructions.
- **Persistence**: SQLite + sqlc. All queries live in `internal/db/sql/`,
  generated code in `internal/db/`. Migrations in `internal/db/migrations/`.
- **Pub/sub**: `internal/pubsub` for decoupled communication between agent,
  UI, and services.
- **Hooks**: User-defined shell commands in `crush.json` that fire before
  tool execution. The engine (`internal/hooks/`) is independent of fantasy
  and agent — it takes inputs, runs commands, returns decisions. The
  `hookedTool` decorator in `internal/agent/hooked_tool.go` wraps tools at
  the coordinator level. Hooks run before permission checks. See
  `HOOKS.md` for the user-facing protocol.
- **CGO disabled**: builds with `CGO_ENABLED=0` and
  `GOEXPERIMENT=greenteagc`.

## Build/Test/Lint Commands

- **Build**: `go build .` or `go run .`
- **Test**: `task test` or `go test ./...` (run single test:
  `go test ./internal/llm/prompt -run TestGetContextFromPaths`)
- **Update Golden Files**: `go test ./... -update` (regenerates `.golden`
  files when test output changes)
  - Update specific package:
    `go test ./internal/tui/components/core -update` (in this case,
    we're updating "core")
- **Lint**: `task lint:fix`
- **Format**: `task fmt` (`gofumpt -w .`)
- **Modernize**: `task modernize` (runs `modernize` which makes code
