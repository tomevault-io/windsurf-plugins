# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The Python package lives in `src/hermes_trading/`, organized by domain: connectors to exchanges sit in `connectors/`, candle and liquidity utilities in `candles.py` and `liquidity.py`, trading orchestration in `trading.py`, and signal logic under `signals/`. Top-level scripts such as `scan_month_signals.py` demonstrate how to combine these pieces for historical scans. Test coverage mirrors the package tree in `tests/`, with focused suites like `tests/test_signals.py` validating indicator behaviour.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Create a virtual environment targeting Python 3.10+, then install editable dependencies with `pip install -e .`. Run the full test suite via `pytest` from the project root; pytest auto-discovers `tests/`. For exploratory runs against live data, execute `python src/scan_month_signals.py` to stream Binance futures candles and print trade summaries. While iterating on detectors, target the signal suite with `pytest tests/test_signals.py -k price_action` to confirm pattern regressions early.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow PEP 8 defaults: four-space indentation, `snake_case` for functions, and `PascalCase` for classes such as `BinanceConnector`. Existing modules rely heavily on type hints and dataclasses; new code should preserve annotations for public APIs and keep constructors side-effect free. Keep docstrings short and functional, mirroring the concise style in `trading.py`. Avoid in-line constants—promote shared values to module-level names when reused.

## Testing Guidelines
Write new tests alongside code in `tests/`, naming files `test_<feature>.py` and functions `test_<condition>_<expectation>()`, as seen in `test_price_action_signal_detects_patterns_on_levels`. Prefer parametrized pytest cases for connector edge conditions and ensure levels precede candles when crafting fixtures. Run `pytest -k <keyword>` locally while iterating, then `pytest` before opening a pull request to confirm regressions are caught early.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Commit history favours short, imperative summaries (`fix: pin bar detection`, `test: ensure levels precede candles`). Use that tone, optionally prefixing the scope with `fix:`, `feat:`, or `test:` when helpful. Each pull request should describe the behavioural change, reference relevant issues, and note any live-exchange impacts. Include screenshots or sample command output when changes affect user-facing scripts, and confirm pytest results in the PR description.

## Secrets & Exchange Configuration
Connector classes default to public market-data access, but trading flows require API credentials. Source keys from environment variables or a local `.env` excluded from version control, then pass them into connector constructors (e.g., `BinanceConnector(api_key, secret)`). Never commit keys, and reset credentials if accidental exposure occurs.
