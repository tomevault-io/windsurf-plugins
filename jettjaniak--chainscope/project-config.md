description: - always import types like that: `from chainscope.typing import *`
---

- tests
  - in pytest
  - in tests/
- typing
  - use type hints
  - always import types like that: `from chainscope.typing import *`
  - DATA_DIR (Path) is defined there too
  - always put imports at the top of the file
  - don't use List[], Dict[] etc. for typing, use list[], dict[] etc.
  - use jaxtyping, prefer type hints like Float[torch.Tensor, " dim1 dim2"] rather than just torch.Tensor
  - we use beartype
    - it's turned on by default on all library files
    - but we need to use the decorator for functions outside of the library, like scripts or tests
- executable scripts
  - always add shebang in (#!/usr/bin/env python3)
  - use click for arguments
- use operators when possible, i.e. set1 | set2 instead of set1.union(set2)
- use "for key in dict.keys()" instead of "for key in dict"
  - but use "for key, value in dict.items()" when it's useful
- see how things are done in other files/scripts and follow the same conventions
  - unless they're different than
    - what's defined in these instructions
    - what I say in the prompt
