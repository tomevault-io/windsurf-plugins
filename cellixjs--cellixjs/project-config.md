# CellixJS Development Guide

## Copilot CLI Workflow

- Start Copilot CLI from the repository root so repository-level hooks, custom agents, and skills are loaded from `.github/`
- Agent workflow state lives in `.agents-work/current/`
- The agent workflow uses `.github/hooks/check-gate.sh` together with `.github/hooks/workflow-enforcement.json` to gate planner, implementer, and reviewer transitions; security markers are reported for visibility but do not drive phase changes
- If a previous orchestrator run was abandoned, request a fresh workflow reset with `touch .agents-work/current/reset.requested` before starting a new top-level session; the next bootstrap clears the old phase/plan markers automatically
- For trivial tasks, write `.agents-work/current/workflow.mode` with `lean` before delegating to the implementer; otherwise use `full`

## Architecture Overview

CellixJS is a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) monorepo built on Azure Functions, implementing a modular architecture with strict separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic in `@ocom/domain`
- **Application Services**: Orchestration layer in `@ocom/application-services`
- **Infrastructure**: Data persistence via Mongoose, OpenTelemetry observability, etc.. in `@ocom/service-*`
- **API Layer**: GraphQL and REST endpoints via Azure Functions in `@ocom/rest` and `@ocom/graphql`

## Core Patterns

### DDD Structure
Each bounded context follows this structure:
```
domain/contexts/{context-name}/
├── {entity}.ts              # Aggregate roots and entities
├── {entity}.value-objects.ts # Immutable value objects
├── {entity}.uow.ts          # Unit of Work pattern
└── README.md                # Domain structure documentation
```

### Service Registration Pattern
The `Cellix` class orchestrates dependency injection:
```typescript
Cellix.initializeServices<ApiContextSpec>((serviceRegistry) => {
  serviceRegistry.registerService(new ServiceMongoose(...));
})
.setContext((serviceRegistry) => ({ 
  domainDataSource: contextBuilder(serviceRegistry.getService(ServiceMongoose))
}))
```

### Azure Functions Integration
Functions are registered via the main application factory:
```typescript
cellix.registerAzureFunctionHandler('graphql', { route: 'graphql' }, graphHandlerCreator)
```

## Development Workflow

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Initial setup (Node v22 required)
nvm use v22 && pnpm run clean && pnpm install && pnpm run build

# Development startup
pnpm run dev  # Builds all workspace packages, starts mock emulator services, backend Azure Functions entry point, and frontend React UI

# Build Pipeline Verification
pnpm run verify    # Run all verification steps (lint, build, test, sonarcloud, quality gate)

# Package-specific operations
pnpm run build    # Build all packages
pnpm run lint     # Lint all packages
pnpm run test     # Test all packages
pnpm run gen      # Generate code (e.g., GraphQL types)
```

**Important**: 
- Use `pnpm run verify` to ensure code quality before commits
- *Note*: Be patient when you run the `verify` command; wait at least 6 minutes for all checks to complete before assuming unexpected failure.
- Use `pnpm run snyk` to run security scans before commits
cop- If you encounter this error when attempting to push changes `hook git error: Command failed with exit code 1: git commit -m REDACTED`, it indicates that pre-commit hooks have failed due to unmet code quality or security standards. Review the output from the hooks, fix the reported issues, and try committing again. Be aware that this error has nothing to do with firewall rules or network connectivity; it is expected to fail if your changes do not meet the project's standards.
- Address any reported issues across all packages before pushing changes (if something fails, it was due to your changes and is considered to be "your code").

### Security Scanning Workflow

**During code generation**:
- Use `snyk_code_scan` MCP tool for immediate security feedback on newly generated code
- Fix security issues iteratively as code is generated

**Before committing changes**:
```bash
pnpm run snyk  # Run all security scans
```

This runs three security scans:
- `snyk:code` - SAST (Static Application Security Testing) for source code vulnerabilities
- `snyk:test` - SCA (Software Composition Analysis) for dependency vulnerabilities
- `snyk:iac` - IaC scanning for Bicep template security misconfigurations

**If security issues are found**:
1. Review Snyk output for vulnerability details and remediation guidance
2. Fix the reported issues (upgrade dependencies, refactor code, etc.)
3. Re-run `pnpm run snyk` to verify fixes
4. Repeat until all scans pass
5. Only then commit the changes

**Note**: Do NOT use `snyk:report` or any Snyk subtasks tagged with `:report` - these are reserved for CI/CD pipeline only.

### VS Code Tasks
Use VS Code tasks for development (preferred over manual commands):
- `func: host start` - Start Azure Functions runtime
- `npm watch (functions)` - Watch mode for API package
- `npm build (functions)` - Build API package

### Testing
- Coverage reports generated in `packages/*/coverage/`
- Run tests: `pnpm run test`
- Run test with coverage: `pnpm run test:coverage`
