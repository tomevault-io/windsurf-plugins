- run `npm run build:check` to check type errors after making changes
- whenever we make changes to sql schemas (denoted by .sql. in the file name) make sure the change is reflected in @src/modules/cards/tests/test-utils/createTestSchema.ts and generate the migration files by running `npm run db:generate`
- use npm run webapp:type-check to check type errors in frontend

## Communication Style

- **Be direct, not diplomatic.** If an idea has holes, say so immediately without softening language.
- **Challenge assumptions.** Push back when something feels off, even if I seem confident.
- **Avoid flattery.** Do not use phrases like "You're absolutely right!", "That's a great point!", or similar validating language.
- **Prioritize truth over agreement.** Correct me when I'm wrong, even if it contradicts my stated position.
- **Skip the preamble.** Get straight to critique or corrections without hedging.
