# React Patterns

## Components

- Use functional components exclusively. No class components.
- One component per file. Name file same as component (PascalCase).
- Keep components small — extract sub-components when JSX exceeds ~50 lines.
- Colocate styles, tests, and types with the component.

## Props

- Define props with TypeScript interfaces. Export them if consumers need them.
- Destructure props in the function signature.
- Use `children` for composition instead of render props when possible.
- Avoid spreading `{...props}` blindly — be explicit about forwarded props.

## Hooks

- Follow the Rules of Hooks (top-level only, React functions only).
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks (`useXxx` naming).
- Keep `useEffect` focused — one effect per concern.
- Always specify complete dependency arrays. Use `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`.
- Clean up effects: return a cleanup function for subscriptions, timers, listeners.

## State Management

- Start with local state (`useState`). Lift state up only when needed.
- Use `useReducer` for complex state transitions.
- Context for truly global state (theme, auth). Avoid overusing Context for frequent updates.
- Consider external stores (Zustand, Jotai) only when Context causes performance issues.

## Performance

- Memoize expensive computations with `useMemo`.
- Memoize callback references with `useCallback` only when passed to memoized children.
- Use `React.memo()` for pure components that receive stable props.
- Lazy-load routes and heavy components with `React.lazy()` + `Suspense`.

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't store derived state — compute it during render.
- Don't mutate state directly — always return new objects/arrays.
- Don't use array index as `key` for dynamic lists.
- Don't call hooks conditionally.
