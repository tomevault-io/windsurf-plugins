# README Conventions and Guidelines 📚

The project's README.md follows specific conventions to maintain consistency and clarity. The documentation is split between README.md (project overview) and CURSOR_TIPS.md (Cursor-specific documentation).

## Language Requirements

All documentation MUST be written in English. This includes:
- Main content
- Comments
- Examples
- Section headers
- File names and paths

## README.md Structure

1. **Title and Introduction**
   ```markdown
   # Project Title 🚀

   ```

2. **Content Overview**
   ```markdown
   ## 📚 What You'll Find Here

   ### [CURSOR_TIPS.md](mdc:CURSOR_TIPS.md)
   Brief description of what's in CURSOR_TIPS.md
   ```

3. **Rules Section**
   ```markdown
   ## 📋 Rules

   Brief explanation of Cursor rules and their purpose.

   ```

5. **License Section**

## Content Guidelines

1. **General Principles**
   - Keep README.md focused on project overview
   - Move Cursor-specific content to CURSOR_TIPS.md
   - Use clear, professional English
   - Be concise and direct

2. **Formatting**
   - Use **bold** for emphasis
   - Use `code` for technical terms
   - Use emojis frgaUse horizontal rules (---) between main sections

3. **Links and References**
   - Link to CURSOR_TIPS.md for Cursor-specific details
   - Link to rule files in .cursor/rules/
   - Use descriptive link text
   - Example:
   ```markdown
   [Cursor Usage Guide](mdc:CURSOR_TIPS.md) | [Git Conventions](mdc:.cursor/rules/git-conventions.mdc)
   ```

## Examples

✅ Good README Structure:
