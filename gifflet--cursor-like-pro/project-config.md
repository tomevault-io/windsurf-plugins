# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
    ```
    .cursor/rules/
    ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    ├── another-rule.mdc
    └── ...
    ```

2. Follow the naming convention:
    - Use kebab-case for filenames
    - Always use .mdc extension
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:
    ```
    PROJECT_ROOT/
    ├── .cursor/
    │   └── rules/
    │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    │       └── ...
    └── ...
    ```

4. Never place rule files:
    - In the project root
    - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
    - In any other location

5. Cursor rules have the following structure:

```
---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/* 
alwaysApply: false
---
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:
```typescript
// Good example
function goodExample() {
  // Implementation following guidelines
}

// Bad example
function badExample() {
  // Implementation not following guidelines
}
```

6. Rule Types and Properties:

The rule properties (description, globs, alwaysApply) must be filled according to how the rule will be added to the chat context. Only one of these properties should have a valid/defined value at a time (note that false in alwaysApply is considered empty as it's the default value).

Types of rules:

a) Always Rules:
   - Set `alwaysApply: true`
   - Leave `description` and `globs` empty
   - These rules are automatically added to every chat context

b) Auto Attached Rules:
   - Set `globs` with a pattern matching the files to be modified
   - Leave `description` and `alwaysApply` with default values
   - These rules are automatically added when working with files matching the glob pattern

c) Agent Requested Rules:
   - Set `description` with a clear purpose of the rule
   - Leave `globs` and `alwaysApply` with default values
   - These rules are added when the AI agent recognizes their relevance based on the description

d) Manual Rules:
   - Leave all properties with default values
   - These rules are only added when manually requested by the user
   - Properties should be:
     ```
     description: 
     globs: 
     alwaysApply: false
     ```
