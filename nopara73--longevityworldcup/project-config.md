# PowerShell Commit Gotcha

- This repo is usually worked in from Windows PowerShell. Shell commands that include bash-style heredoc syntax like `<<'EOF'` can be parsed by PowerShell before bash receives them.
- For `git commit` message construction in PowerShell, prefer a PowerShell here-string or another PowerShell-safe approach instead of an inline bash heredoc.
