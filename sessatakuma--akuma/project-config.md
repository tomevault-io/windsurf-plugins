# Guidelines

## Env

- Always prefer `bun` commands if using bun.
- Always read `package.json` before running any build/dev command.
- Always assume the dev server is already running, never start one.
- Always check the config file to confirm the port when accessing dev server.

## Frontend

- Always check the front-end design skill when the task is front-end related.
- Always use global style variables for colors, fonts, and spacing
- Always use global string constants for text.

## Dev

- Always fixes lint errors after making changes.
- Always directly read the editor for lint error status, never use commands.
