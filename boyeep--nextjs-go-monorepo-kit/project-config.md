description: Guidance for AI edits in this Next.js + Go starter template
---


- Use `AGENTS.md` at the repo root as the primary project guide.
- Treat this repository as a reusable template, not a single-purpose product.
- Keep naming generic unless the task explicitly replaces the sample domain.
- Prefer editing within existing structures:
  - `frontend/src/features/` for frontend domain behavior
  - `frontend/src/components/` for shared UI and chrome
  - `backend/internal/server/` for routing
  - `backend/internal/handler/`, `service/`, and `repository/` for backend changes
- Root verification commands:
  - `npm run check`
  - `npm run e2e`
- Frontend auth is intentionally in-memory only. Do not assume page reloads preserve login state.
- If home-page or public copy changes, update `frontend/e2e/smoke.spec.ts` as needed.
- Keep docs, scripts, and CI aligned when changing workflows.
- Be aware that frontend builds run `next-sitemap` and can regenerate files under `frontend/public/`.
