# Agent Operations Guide

This document records the workflow followed so far, key decisions, and rules
for future human or agent contributors working on the angr MCP server project.

## Environment & Tooling

- **Python**: 3.13 (system interpreter). A dedicated virtual environment is
  created via `uv venv .venv`. Keep `UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache` to store build
  artifacts locally.
- **Dependencies**: install `claripy` and `angr` from PyPI inside the virtual
  environment (`uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python claripy angr`).
- **Testing**: run `.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover tests` to cover both
  the synthetic sample binary suite and the angr CTF Phase 1 regressions.
- **Binary samples**: Phase 1 tests rely on bundled 32-bit angr CTF binaries.
  Native replay assertions will skip automatically if `/lib/ld-linux.so.2`
  (or equivalent) is unavailable. The legacy sample binary still compiles on
  the fly and therefore continues to require a working C compiler (`cc` or
  `gcc`).

## Repository Layout Snapshot

- `angr_mcp/` – MCP server implementation and runtime registry.
- `resources/` – Bundled reference material and companion codebases:
  - `resources/angr` – Upstream angr source tree (currently unused for installs;
    PyPI packages are consumed instead).
  - `resources/awesome-angr` – Community exploration techniques dynamically
    imported by the server when requested.
  - `resources/angr_ctf` – Capture-the-flag training levels and build scripts
    for learning angr-based symbolic exploitation (MetaCTF workshop content).
  - `resources/dAngr` – dAngr examples and docs for additional exploration
    strategies.
  - `resources/GhidraMCP` – Shared assets for coordinating workflows with the
    Ghidra MCP server.
- `angr_mcp/utils/` – Shared binary-inspection and state-mutation helpers used
  by handlers and tests.
- `tests/test_mcp_server.py` – Integration tests; doubles as executable examples
  for the handler workflow.
- `tests/test_phase1_ctf.py` – Automates angr CTF levels 00–04 through MCP
  handlers, asserting predicate metadata, register/stack tooling, and native
  replay.
- `tests/test_deep_call_partition.py` – Builds a deeply nested binary and
  exercises call-chain recovery, state-budget limits, and chunked symbolic
  execution to reach a buried function.
- `pyproject.toml` – Minimal configuration for `uv` environment management.

## Implemented Workflow (Session Summary)

1. Explored bundled angr documentation and `resources/awesome-angr` techniques to scope key
   capabilities for MCP exposure.
2. Implemented the MCP server core:
   - Registry tracking projects, states, simulation managers, hooks, monitors.
   - Handlers covering project load, state creation, instrumentation, symbolic
     execution, monitoring, inspection, constraint solving, CFG, and slicing.
   - Dynamic loading of exploration techniques with resilient error handling.
3. Added error-tolerant execution (capturing exceptions and returning them in
   handler responses) and stash-safe state collection.
4. Implemented structured alerting for unconstrained instruction pointers and
   suspicious memory writes; alerts accumulate per state and surface in run
   results and inspections.
5. Introduced job persistence: `run_symbolic_search` now issues job handles,
   jobs can be listed/resumed/deleted, and persisted snapshots live under
   `.mcp_jobs/`.
6. Authored JSON Schemas for every handler request/response in `schemas/` to
   aid downstream validation.
7. Wrote integration tests compiling a sample binary that requires discovering
   the string “AB” to reach a `win` function; tests cover hooking, exploration,
   constraint solving, monitoring, alerts, job persistence, CFG, and slicing.
8. Provisioned a `uv`-managed virtual environment and documented setup in the
   README.
9. Implemented predicate descriptors (`address`, `stdout_contains`,
   `stdout_not_contains`) with recorded match metadata and stream capture in
   `run_symbolic_search`.
10. Added structured state-mutation helpers (register injection, stack
    adjustments, solver-option presets) plus the public `mutate_state` handler
    and symbolic handle tracking for constraint queries.
11. Created binary-analysis utilities (`angr_mcp/utils`) powering `.rodata`
    scans and literal cross-referencing used by Phase 1 automation.
12. Authored Phase 1 angr CTF regression tests validating levels 00–04 via the
    MCP tooling and confirming native execution of recovered inputs.
13. Added `analyze_call_chain`, caching CFG results to surface caller→callee
    paths so assistants can plan deep explorations without recomputing graph
    analyses.
14. Introduced a `state_budget` guard in `run_symbolic_search`; the handler now
    reports per-stash state pressure and interrupts runs when limits are
    exceeded so clients can shrink their search windows.
15. Landed the deep-call regression (`tests/test_deep_call_partition.py`) that
    compiles a wide branch tree and demonstrates chunked exploration via the
    new call-chain handler and state-budget feedback.
16. Vendored the angr taint engine, exposing it through a new MCP handler
    (`run_taint_analysis`) that supports pointer-aware taint sources,
