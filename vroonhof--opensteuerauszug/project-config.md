Never change the ech0196 and kursliste models as they define the standards.

Some fields in the ech0196 model are optional despite not being so in
the spec, this is to allow incremental construction without pydantic
errors. Do not change this. when necessary refer specs/eCH-0196-2-2.xsd to authoritative info.
