# Port CLI PR Quality Checklist

## migrate.go must mirror import.go protections

When modifying blueprint import phases in `import.go`, always check whether `migrate.go` needs the same change. The migrate module has its own `importToTarget` that duplicates the phased approach. Key parity requirements:

- aggregationProperties: use `TopologicalSortAggProps` for ordering
- ownership: use `TopologicalSortOwnership` for ordering
- mirrorProperties: retry after aggProps phase
- aggregationProperties: retry after all other phases
- Both modules must handle failures identically (collect + retry, not just log)

## --include flag validation

When adding a new resource type that depends on another (e.g. `page-permissions` depends on `pages`), validate the dependency in ALL four commands: export, import, migrate, compare. A bare `--include page-permissions` without `pages` causes silent empty exports or idempotency-breaking overwrites.

## Regex patterns must handle multi-line API responses

Port API error bodies can span multiple lines. Always use `(?s)` flag in regexes that extract JSON from error strings (e.g. `invalidPermBodyPattern`).

## Migrate command output parity

When adding new result counters (e.g. `BlueprintPermissionsUpdated`), ensure they appear in:
- The `Result` struct
- CLI text output
- CLI JSON output (`--output json`)
- Both "Errors:" and "Warnings:" sections use the correct label

## Test patterns (Eric's style)

- Every new feature needs both positive (success) and negative (failure) tests
- Use `httptest.NewServer` with closure variables to capture requests
- Use `t.Fatalf` for setup failures, `t.Errorf` for assertion failures
- Never silently skip — use `t.Fatal` instead of returning early on nil
- For retry logic: test success-on-retry AND failure-on-retry (error reported)

## CHANGELOG entries

Describe features and fixes, not test names. Write from the user's perspective:

```
# Bad
- TestCollector_CollectsPagePermissions: verify page permissions collected

# Good
- aggregationProperties are now applied in topological order during migrate
```
