# Repository Guidelines

## MCP Tools and Skills

This project has MCP tools available for Control Tower CLI commands (`ct run eval`, `ct run monitor`, `ct live ...`, etc.). Use these MCP tools for executing commands.

**For guidance on HOW to run evaluations or monitoring**, use the skills instead of the MCP tools:
- For running evaluations: Use the `running-evals` skill (invoke with questions about `ct run eval`, policies, task sets, etc.)
- For monitoring trajectories: Use the `monitoring` skill (invoke with questions about `ct run monitor`, suspiciousness scores, monitor types, etc.)

The skills provide documentation and best practices, while the MCP tools execute the actual commands.

**Running long commands:** When using `ct run eval`, `ct run monitor`, or `ct live score`, always use `background: true` (this is the default). These commands return immediately with an `output_dir` containing `stdout.log` and `stderr.log`. Use the Read tool or `tail -f` to check progress.

**Inspecting `.eval` files:** When asked to look at, inspect, or analyze `.eval` files or trajectories, use the `ct-eval-*` MCP tools (`ct-eval-info`, `ct-eval-sample`, `ct-eval-messages`, `ct-eval-search`) instead of unzipping or parsing manually.

## Settings and Nested Environment Repositories

Environments live under, and are created by, **settings** — directories directly under `.settings/`. The layout, for `linuxarena`, is `.settings/linuxarena/<env>/` (e.g. `.settings/linuxarena/web_scraping/`). See [env-architecture](docs/development/env-architecture.md#3-setting-layout) for how discovery works.

`.settings/` is gitignored in the parent repo (except `.settings/demos/` and `.settings/sandbox_escape/`, which are tracked). Settings and their envs are pulled via `uv run ct settings pull <setting>`.

1. **Searching**: Always include gitignored files when searching under `.settings/`. These files exist locally and matter — they're just not tracked by the parent repo.

2. **Git operations**: Changes inside a pulled setting or env belong to that sub-repo, not the control-tower repo. When committing, branching, or checking status, use `git -C .settings/<setting>/<env>/ ...` (linuxarena) or `git -C .settings/<setting>/ ...` (basharena, docker_sandbox_breakout). These changes will **not** appear in the parent repo's `git status` — that's expected. If the user asks to commit and recent work was in an env, check that sub-repo's git status.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Core packages live under `src/`, organized by responsibility: trajectory formats under `src/control_tower/trajectories`, orchestration logic in `src/control_tower/ct_runs` and `src/control_tower/utils`, protocol definitions in `src/control_tower/protocols`, environment definitions in `src/control_tower/environments`, live development tools in `src/control_tower/live`, sandbox management in `src/control_tower/sandbox`, and CLI entry points in `src/control_tower/cli`. Tests mirror the package layout in `tests/`. Generated artifacts land in `logs/` (gitignored). The `apps/docs/` directory holds the docs/marketing site and should remain isolated from the Python runtime code.

Do not add `__init__.py` files when creating helper directories; we rely on namespace packages by default.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use `uv sync --dev --all-extras` after updating dependencies. The Makefile wraps routine tasks: `make pr-checks` runs lint, format, ty, verifytypes, and test suites; `make clean` purges stray `__pycache__` folders; `make test` executes the PyTest suite. CLI entry points ship as scripts: `uv run ct run eval` to execute evals across environments, `uv run ct run monitor` to run monitors on trajectories, `uv run ct envs validate` to confirm environment metadata consistency, and `uv run ct run side-task-review -e <env>` to review side task quality. Prefer `uv run <tool>` over direct module invocations so the managed virtualenv is respected.

## Reference Runs

When comparing evaluation results or looking for baseline trajectories, use the runs page filters and run tags to narrow to relevant reference runs.

```bash
# Filter runs via CLI tags
uv run ct runs list --tag baseline
```
