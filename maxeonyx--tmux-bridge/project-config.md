# Agent Instructions

This document is for AI coding assistants working on the tmux-bridge codebase. This tool is developed from the [agent-tools workspace](https://github.com/maxeonyx/agent-tools); clone and develop there, not from this repo directly.

## Project Overview

`tb` is a Rust CLI allowing AI agents to inject commands into an interactive terminal session controlled by a human user. Built on tmux.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `tb start` | Human starts session, displays ID like `a7x` |
| `tb info` | Agent probes pane to identify shell via observable behavior |
| `tb run` | Agent runs synchronous command, waits for output |
| `tb run --dry-run` | Agent prints the exact `tmux send-keys` string without running it |
| `tb launch` | Agent starts background task in split pane |
| `tb check` | Agent checks background task status/output, or captures main pane |
| `tb done` | Agent closes background task pane |

## Fundamental Constraints

`tb` operates on tmux panes whose foreground program may be an SSH client connected to a remote shell. The primary use case is a local tmux pane showing a remote shell over SSH.

The only reliable signal is **pane content** — what the human sees. tmux's local process metadata cannot see through SSH and only reflects the local client process, not the remote shell. Therefore:

- All pane interaction uses only `tmux send-keys` and `tmux capture-pane`
- Detection and probing must work through SSH — if it fails when the pane is an SSH session, it's broken
- Treat tmux as a transport to the pane, not a source of truth about what's running in it

## Key Design Decisions

1. **tmux is the foundation** - don't reinvent tmux
2. **Pane content is the source of truth** - `tb` must work through SSH, so shell detection uses only observable pane behavior (`send-keys` + `capture-pane`), never local process metadata
3. **Human terminal is primary** - agent is a guest, not the owner
4. **`tb run` behaves like a command wrapper** - stdout/exit status work normally
5. **Progressive disclosure** - each command only hints at the next logical step
6. **Multi-session support** - session IDs like `a7x` allow multiple bridges
7. **Background tasks** - up to 6 concurrent tasks in split panes

## Building and Testing

```bash
# Build
cargo build

# Run tests (96 tests defining behavior)
cargo test

# Run specific test file
cargo test --test start
cargo test --test info
cargo test --test run
cargo test --test launch
cargo test --test check
cargo test --test done

# Run with release optimizations
cargo build --release

# Run the test ratchet (CI uses this)
python3 scripts/ratchet.py

# Stress test for flakiness (run N times, report pass rate)
./scripts/stress-test.sh 20
```

### Test Architecture

Tests are real E2E tests using real tmux sessions. The key principle: **never use fixed sleeps — always poll for observable state.** The test helpers in `tests/common/mod.rs` provide polling primitives:

- `wait_until(description, timeout, poll_interval, probe)` — generic polling
- `wait_for_pane_content(session, predicate, timeout)` — poll tmux pane capture
- `wait_for_pane_count(session, expected, timeout)` — poll pane count
- `wait_for_session_exists(prefix, id, timeout)` — poll session existence
- `TestSession::wait_for_check_output(task_id, predicate)` — poll `tb check` output
- `TestSession::wait_for_main_check_output(predicate)` — poll `tb check` (main pane)

When adding new tests: use these helpers instead of `thread::sleep`. If a new wait pattern is needed, add it to `tests/common/mod.rs`.

### TODO: test runs leak tmux sessions on crash/interrupt

tb test runs leak tmux sessions (prefix `tb-help-*` and other `tb-*` test prefixes) whenever a test crashes, times out, or an agent interrupts the run. The harness cleans up on the happy path but not when a run is killed mid-flight, so leaked sessions pile up and confuse later runs. This is a recurring, real annoyance (e.g. left six `tb-help-run-*` / `tb-help-launch-*` sessions alive after one interrupted ratchet run).

**TODO — make cleanup crash-proof:** the test harness should reap any session matching its scoped prefix even after an aborted/panicking run (e.g. a pre-run sweep of stale test-prefixed sessions, and/or a more robust drop/`atexit`-style guard). Until that's fixed, manually sweep after ANY `cargo ratchet` / `cargo nextest` run:

```bash
tmux ls 2>/dev/null | grep -oE '^tb-[^:]*' | while read s; do tmux kill-session -t "$s"; done
```

Verify none remain with `tmux ls`.

### Test Ratchet

The project uses a test ratchet system (`scripts/ratchet.py`) that enforces:

1. **TDD workflow**: New tests must be added as "pending" (failing) first, then promoted to "passing" in a separate commit
2. **No regressions**: Once a test passes, it must keep passing
3. **No silent removal**: Tests in `.test-status.json` must exist

When adding a new test:
1. Add the test code
2. Add entry to `.test-status.json` as `"pending"`
3. Commit: "Add failing test for X"
4. Implement the fix
5. Change status to `"passing"` in `.test-status.json`
