# claude-io-guard

io-guard is a Claude Code plugin that checks what an agent sends to the file and shell tools, fixes what it safely
can, and returns a structured error for the rest. One codebase runs on Windows and macOS. This repository is also the
plugin's marketplace: github.com/Riztazz/claude-io-guard.

## Layout

The tasks build most of this. Today the marketplace, the plugin's manifest, hooks, launcher, skills, the
`ioguard` package's runtime core (`lib/` and the pipeline in `checks/`, with twenty-two checks: the session
probe, `write.location`, `write.locks`, `shell.writes`, `transport.body`, `shell.lint`, `win.paths`, `conform.write`,
`conform.edit`, `verify.write`, `verify.command`, `shell.touched`, `read.profile`, `diagnose.failure`,
`diagnose.refused`, `shell.results`, `server.heartbeat`, `run.rules`, `commit.policy`, `restore.ask`,
`trust.ask` and `journal.write`), the hook entry point and bridge in `hooks/`, the io MCP server in `mcp/` with
`io.read`, `io.edit`, `io.splice`, `io.append`, `io.run`, `io.status`, `io.read_log`, `io.format`, `io.snapshot`,
`io.restore`, `io.compare`, `io.stage`, `io.config`, `io.dashboard`, `io.trust` and the hook tools, the corpus,
replay, precommit, report, measure, check and profile commands in `cli/` with their scripts, `tests/` with
its fixtures and helpers, `tools/probes/`,
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.claude/`, `docs/`, `workbench/` and this file exist.

```

docs/launcher.md                  how io-guard starts Python on each platform, and what each hook path costs
.claude/tasks/                    the build plan: README.md, context.md, open/, done/, baseline/
.claude/rules/this-repo.md        the rules for this repository
.claude/rules/docs.md             which doc each kind of change must update, the drawing included

```

## The kit's links

The lead's shared kit, UNREAL-SHARED, links its generic group in here with `install.ps1 -Profile generic`:

- `.claude/rules/shared/`: the always-on rules for every project
- `.claude/skills/engineering`, `testing`, `verification` and `prose`: the skills for every project
- `.claude/tools/shared/`: the kit's scripts, for the hook in `.claude/settings.local.json` that prints the
  steps after a compaction

Claude Code loads a rule only when its real path is inside the project, and a linked rule's real path is the kit. The
installer therefore approves imports from outside the project for this folder, in the lead's `~/.claude.json`. With
that approval gone, the seven shared rules silently stop loading.

Every link is gitignored, and a public clone has none of them. **Never edit a linked file here**, and never add
one to git: git writes through a tracked link into the kit. A change to them is a task in the kit's `tasks/open/`.

## Start here

1. Read `.claude/tasks/README.md`, `.claude/tasks/context.md` and `docs/design/architecture.md`.
2. Pick the lowest-numbered open task whose `depends-on` tasks are all done.
3. Read the skills the task needs:
   - `io-guard-dev` before any work here
   - `engineering` before writing code
   - `testing` before writing a test
   - `verification` before handing work back
   - `prose` before any comment, docstring, message or page

## Running things

Each line works once the task that builds it has landed.

- Tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .`. CI runs `python tests/run_all.py`, the same suite, which
  also fails when no test ran
- Fixtures: `python -m tests.support.fixtures` rewrites the generated fixtures and `tests/fixtures/MANIFEST.sha256`
- The checks on one command, offline: `python tools/ioguard.py check "<command>"`
- The replay corpus, from the lead's transcripts: `python tools/corpus.py myproject=<folder> ...`, one `NAME=FOLDER`
  per transcript folder under `~/.claude/projects/`. Then `python tools/replay.py`, which writes
  `reports/replay-<time>.json` and prints the summary
