# Agents

All agent-driven work must be opened as pull requests against `plttn/tide`.

Do not open pull requests against `IlanCosman/tide` (upstream) for work done in this fork.

For testing, use `mise` rather than `make`.

PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
(e.g. `fix: ...`, `feat: ...`) — see `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Since PRs are
squash-merged, the title becomes the commit message that release-please
reads to generate the changelog.
