# List Conversations

List and filter conversations. Use the thread resource link inside the Conversation entity to load conversation threads.

## Request

```
GET /v2/conversations HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer oauth_token
```

Request parameters can be used to filter conversations. All parameters are joined by the AND operator.

If you want closed conversations in a specific inbox, call:

```bash
curl https://api.helpscout.net/v2/conversations?mailbox=123&status=closed
```

You can also exclude data from your search results using the NOT operator, calling:

```bash
curl https://api.helpscout.net/v2/conversations?query=(NOT email:"email@domain.com")
```

By default only active conversations are listed and they are sorted by `createdAt` (from newest to oldest). This is equivalent to `?status=active&sortField=createdAt&sortOrder=desc`.

If you want to list all conversations, use `?status=all`

**Note:** If using the `embed=threads` parameter with this call, you will see truncated chat threads. This is by design. To view Beacon chat threads in full, call the List Threads endpoint for that conversation instead.

## URL Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Examples | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `embed` | enumeration | `embed=threads` | Allows embedding/loading of sub-entities, allowed values are: `threads` |
| `mailbox` | number | `mailbox=123`<br>`mailbox=123,567` | Filters conversations from a specific inbox id. Use comma separated values for more inboxes |
| `folder` | number | `folder=993` | Filters conversations from a specific folder id |
| `status` | enumeration | `status=active` | Filter conversation by status (defaults to active):<br>- `active`<br>- `all`<br>- `closed`<br>- `open`<br>- `pending`<br>- `spam` |
| `tag` | string | `tag=red`<br>`tag=red,blue` | Filter conversation by tags. Use comma separated values for more tags |
| `assigned_to` | number | `assigned_to=1771` | Filters conversations by assignee id |
| `modifiedSince` | date | `modifiedSince=2018-05-04T12:00:03Z` | Returns only conversations that have been modified since this date |
| `number` | number | `number=123` | Look up a conversation by conversation number |
| `sortField` | enumeration | `sortField=createdAt` | Sorts the result by specified field. Allowed values:<br>- `createdAt`<br>- `customerEmail`<br>- `customerName`<br>- `mailboxid`<br>- `modifiedAt`<br>- `number`<br>- `score`<br>- `status`<br>- `subject`<br>- `waitingSince` |
| `sortOrder` | enumeration | `sortOrder=desc` | Sort in ascending (`asc`) or descending (`desc`) order, default is `desc` |
| `query` | special | `query=(number:123)` | Advanced query. If you use other filtering request parameters, they will be combined with `AND` operator. For example `?mailbox=567&query=tag:fire` effectively means `mailbox=567 AND tag=fire`. |
| `page` | number | `page=1` | The page number |
| `customFieldsByIds` | special | `customFieldsByIds=123:blue`<br>`customFieldsByIds=123:blue,234:99` | Filters by custom field values. Must be combined with `mailbox` parameter as well. Expected format is `id:value,id:value`. See Custom Fields Search for details |

## Custom Fields Search

### customFieldsByIds

This is a fairly low level search - the values are expected in a `fieldId:value` format and you can either:

- use multiple `customFieldsByIds` params like this: `?customFieldsByIds=123:green&customFieldsByIds=234:blue`
- or join the values yourself: `?customFieldsByIds=123:green,234:blue`

**Rules:**

- the filtering is done via an exact match for all field types with the exception of single line text field - for example a custom field with a number type and ID `123` with the following filter of `123:1000` will only match if the value is precisely `1000`
- single line text fields are searched in full text search manner
- multiple filters use `AND` operator - all custom fields filters must match
- for Dropdown custom field type the value is the dropdown option ID (you can use Inbox Fields endpoint to fetch all IDs)
- Multiline custom fields are not supported

## Query

You can create complex search queries by combining operators:

```
?query=(assigned:"spock" AND (customerIds: 123 OR customerIds: 567))
```

Some characters (particularly `+` signs in email addresses) are reserved and will need to be encoded. For more info, see [this article](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp).

### Subject

| Example | What it does |
|---|---|
| `query=(subject:"rainbow")` | Searches for conversation subjects that contain the word "rainbow" |
| `query=(subject:"have a question")` | Searches for conversation subjects that contain the phrase "have a question" (not case sensitive) |
| `query=(subject:"coffee" OR subject:"tea")` | Searches for conversations with a subject that contain the word "coffee" or the word "tea" |
| `query=(subject:"coffee tea")` | Searches for conversation subjects that contain the word "coffee" and the word "tea" in no particular order |

### Tags

| Example | What it does |
|---|---|
| `query=(tag:"carrots")` | Searches for conversations that have the tag "carrots" |
| `query=(tag:"dogs love carrots")` | Searches for conversations that have the tag "dogs love carrots" |
| `query=(tag:"dogs" OR tag:"carrots")` | Searches for conversations that are tagged with either "dogs" or "carrots" |

### Inbox

| `query=(modifiedAt:[NOW-1HOUR TO *])` | Searches conversations that were modified in the last hour |
| `query=(modifiedAt:[2013-01-01T00:00:00Z TO 2013-12-31T23:59:59Z])` | Searches conversations that were modified in 2013 |
| `query=(modifiedAt:[2014 TO 2014-12-01])` | Searches conversations that were modified from the start of 2014 to the beginning of December, 2014 |
| `query=(modifiedAt:2000-11)` | Searches conversations that were modified in November, 2000 |

| `query=(createdAt:[NOW-1HOUR TO *])` | Searches conversations that were created in the last hour |

### Email

| Example | What it does |
|---|---|
| `query=(email:"john@appleseed.com")` | Searches conversations where the mail `john@appleseed.com` is either in to, cc, bcc fields or it's one of the emails in a customer profile. |

## Moved or Merged Conversations

When a conversation is merged with another conversation, it is no longer accessible using the old ID. Get Conversation endpoint will return a `HTTP 301 Moved Permanently` status code and the response will contain a `Location` header with the URI of the new conversation.

This request will return a `HTTP 404 Not Found` in such case. If you suspect the conversation you are trying to change was merged, call the Get Conversation endpoint to get a new conversation location.

## Thread Type

`lineitem` represents a change of state on the conversation. This could include, but not limited to, the conversation was assigned, the status changed, the conversation was moved from one inbox to another, etc. A line item won't have a body, to/cc/bcc lists, or attachments.

When a conversation is forwarded, a new conversation is created to represent the forwarded conversation. `forwardparent` is the type set on the thread of the original conversation that initiated the forward event. `forwardchild` is the type set on the first thread of the new forwarded conversation.

## Thread State

A state of `underreview` means the thread has been stopped by Collision Detection and is waiting to be confirmed (or discarded) by the person that created the thread.

A state of `hidden` means the thread was hidden (or removed) from customer-facing emails.

## Thread Status

Thread status is only updated when there is a status change. Otherwise, the status will be set to `nochange`.

## Attachment State

A state of `valid` means the attachment is free from malicious content.

A state of `virus` means malicious content has been detected for the attachment.
