# AGENTS.md

Generally speaking, you should browse the codebase to figure out what is going on.

## Task Completion Requirements

- All of `bun fmt`, `bun lint`, and `bun typecheck` must pass before considering tasks completed.
- Never use `bun test`, use `bun run test` (runs Vitest).
- Never write a useEffect. If you really think you need to, see the no-use-effect skill.

## Project Snapshot

fm-gacha is a music gacha game site for users to casually collect cards relating to songs.

This repository is WIP. Proposing sweeping changes that improve long-term maintainability is encouraged.

## Core Priorities

1. Performance first.
2. Reliability first.
3. Visual consistency first. Adhere to the visual style of the existing site.

If a tradeoff is required, choose correctness and robustness over short-term convenience.

Do not add excessive fallbacks. Errors like missing env are critical and shouldn't be masked by fallbacks. Logic should be simple, with reasonable expecations, don't `try except` everything. Use the smallest possible diff. Then think of how to make it smaller. Don't add helpers. Do not use fallbacks with ternaries or the || operator. No typeof checks. No backwards compatability. Smallest possible set of changes to make the instructed change work.

Keep files under ~400 lines. Refactor as neeeded to meet this.

## Maintainability

Long term maintainability is a core priority. If you add new functionality, first check if there are shared logic that can be extracted to a separate module. Duplicate logic across mulitple files is a code smell and should be avoided. Don't be afraid to change existing code. Don't take shortcuts by just adding local logic to solve a problem.

## Package Roles

- `convex/`: Contains all backend services and functions routed through Convex. Serving articles, images, and auth for example
- `src/`: TanStack Start + React UI and site structure.

## Expectations

- Use shadcn for base components `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add {component}`
- Use dark mode color scheme in src/styles.css
- Keep designs simple, no over explaining, plain colors, no gradients, no decorative elements.
- Assume dev servers for both Convex and `bun dev` are already running.
