# Building
- This project uses **Gradle** build system and the **Kotlin** language for all Android-related code.
- Declare and manage dependencies in the Gradle TOML format, specifically in the `@gradle/libs.versions.toml` file.

---

# Localization
- **Always use localization for user-facing text.** Do not hardcode strings in the UI code.
- Add new strings to `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` (English/Default).
- You **MUST** translate new strings into all supported languages found in the `app/src/main/res/` directory (e.g., `values-ar`, `values-de`, `values-es`, `values-fr`, `values-he`, `values-ru`).

---

# Lint and Format
- Do not manually fix linting or formatting issues. The project uses an auto-formatter.
- You can run the auto-formatter with the command `./gradlew spotlessApply`. This applies to all code in the codebase.

---

# Code style

## Package names
- **Never use full package names inline in code.** Always use imports instead.
- **Incorrect**: `com.anysoftkeyboard.janus.app.repository.RecentLanguagesRepository`
- **Correct**: Add `import com.anysoftkeyboard.janus.app.repository.RecentLanguagesRepository` at the top and use `RecentLanguagesRepository` in the code.
- This applies to all classes, including `R` resource references (use `R.string.foo`, not `com.anysoftkeyboard.janus.app.R.string.foo`).

## Code comments
- should be rare in our code base: naming and readability should do most of the documenting
- comments should explain the "why".
- if there is a need to explain a complex code block:
  - use clear language
  - you may use: pseudocode, simple diagrams, examples
  - citations are encouraged if relevant
- comment may be included if a critical "TODO" need - document what needs to be implemented/modified.

# Git Commit Guidelines
- Before creating a commit, always run `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` to ensure all tests are passing and `./gradlew spotlessApply` to ensure proper formatting.

## Commit Messages
- **Title:** The title should be concise and prefixed with `[LLM]`.
- **Description:** Include a short description of the issue (bug, feature-request, crash, chore, etc) and a short description of the solution.
- Be thorough yet concise.
- Provide enough detail to give reviewers a good understanding of the context without overwhelming them with too much information.
- Be sure to break down large changes into digestible sections if necessary.
- the most important parts of the description are:
  - **What**: summarize (short) what this change is doing
  - **Why**: why this is the correct change
- Add your name at the end of the description to signify the commit was made by an AI Agent.
- When fixing or implementing a github issue, add the issue number at the end of the description with a `#` prefix. For example: `Fixes #123` or `Implements #123` or `Closes #123`.

# Naming
- Use inclusive language for all variables, functions, and class names:
    - Replace "dummy" with "fake," "mock," or "noop."
    - Replace "blacklist" with "disallow-list."
    - Replace "whitelist" with "allow-list."
    - Avoid terms like "master," "slave," "insane," and "dumb."
    - Use gender-neutral pronouns.
