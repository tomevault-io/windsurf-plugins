# AGENTS.md — working on capn-hook

Capn Hook is dynamic memory for coding agents: chart discoveries as markdown entries, recall them with `capn ask` (QMD hybrid search), cache-bust by content hash. Read README.md for the product; this file is how to work on the repo.

## Ground rules

- **The tests are the contract.** GOAL.md is gone — retired before publish (`4c8bbef`); don't go looking for it. `bun test` plus the agent E2E verify behavior. Never weaken or delete a test to make the suite pass — spec changes are explicit, human-approved revisions.
- **Verifier-first workflow:** change the contract docs (README.md) and tests before or with behavior changes, then make `bun test` and the E2E prove it.
- **Chart or unchart, never update** applies to chart entries by design. Do not build entry-mutation features.

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/capn`, `src/run.ts`, `src/capn.ts` | Executable launcher, runtime entrypoint, and command dispatch |
| `src/commands.ts` | Command handlers and command-local helpers |
| `src/{project,entries,store,hooks,util}.ts` | Flat storage, project pathing, hook, QMD store, and utility modules |
| `tests/capn.test.ts` | bun:test suite |
| `tests/agent-e2e.sh` | Two-phase codex-in-the-loop E2E |
| `tests/treasure-cove/` | Fixture codebase. Must never mention capn — agents under test learn only from `capn context` output |
| `eval/` | Token-cost eval corpus, harness, and committed run evidence. Read `eval/README.md` before touching `eval/run.ts` or running the harness |
| `docs/shaping.md`, `docs/frame.md` | Design history (shaping method) |

## Conventions

- Tests are **subprocess-only**: spawn the CLI in mktemp dirs, assert on exit codes/stdout/files. Never import functions from `src/` in tests. Never touch the repo's own `.capn/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, or `.capn/qmd/` from tests.
- Tests run **concurrently** (`test.concurrent`, whole suite ~1.5s): every test mints its own workspace via `workspace()` — own mktemp dir, own `HOME` — and awaits async `execa`. Never `execaSync`, never shared module state between tests. `bun test` discovery is scoped to `tests/` by `bunfig.toml`.
- Tests must pass on a machine with **no GGUF models**: init with `--no-embedding` (BM25). Embedding-path tests must `skipIf` models are absent.
- Chart entries use `chart`/`unchart` naming; the old `add`/`delete` commands are intentionally gone.
- CLI contract (v0.2+): `capn chart "<question>" --files <files> [--details "<extras>"]` — the files ARE the answer; there is no positional answer argument. `capn ask` emits ranked JSONL (one object per line — parse line-by-line, never as a single blob); a miss exits 1 with the hint on stderr. User-visible CLI changes need a changeset.
- Identifier naming: acronyms stay uppercase (`JSON`, `URL`, `DB`); the `Id` suffix stays mixed-case (`entryId`, `sessionId`).
- Keep `src/` flat and lean — storage libs plus one `commands.ts`; no speculative options. The executable package bin stays `bin/capn`; `src/capn.ts` stays importable command dispatch. The `@tobilu/qmd` import stays dynamic inside `openStore`.

## Gotchas (learned the hard way)

- `bun link` does NOT put the `capn` bin on PATH. Symlink the launcher instead: `ln -s "$PWD/bin/capn" <dir-on-PATH>/capn`.
- capn's index state lives in `.capn/qmd/index.sqlite` — capn must never create a `.qmd/` at a host project's root; that dir belongs to the host's own qmd install (the host-qmd coexistence test guards this).
- **Stale `dist/` masks source changes.** `bin/capn` runs only `dist/capn.js` (it errors if missing — no `src/` fallback). After editing `src/`, run `bun run build` before trusting any subprocess behavior — installed CLI, `capn context` output. (`just install` and the E2E build automatically; `tests/capn.test.ts` spawns `src/run.ts` directly and doesn't need it.) This has burned four separate sessions.
- The launcher resolves its entry from its own realpath, so the capn repo's node_modules is what loads — keep `npm install` or `bun install` fresh there. Bun silently auto-installs from its global cache if no node_modules is found; don't rely on it.
- Hooks are a single command string, `/usr/bin/env capn context`. Codex ignores `args` arrays, and a bare `/usr/bin/env` dumps every env var into session context. Claude hooks belong in `.claude/settings.json`, not `settings.local.json`. Non-interactive `codex exec` (as of 0.142.5) fires no SessionStart hooks at all — inject `capn context` through the prompt instead.
- Broad `rg`/`fd` invocations wander into heavyweight ignored trees (`eval/repos/`, `eval/runs/work/`, `motion/node_modules/`, `motion/out/`) and drown in output — scope commands away from them unless you're working there. (`bun test` is already fenced by `bunfig.toml`.)
- sqlite `-wal`/`-shm` files beside `index.sqlite` are normal; the sqlite is disposable — `capn init` rebuilds it from the markdown.
- The whole `.capn/` directory is gitignored local memory (`capn init` manages the line) — tests must not assume any of it is committed.
