# Development Guidelines

## Dev Servers

Each plugin has a Next.js test app in its `dev/` directory. Start with `pnpm dev` from there (or use `PORT=<port> pnpm --filter <test-app-name> dev` from the root). Use different ports to run multiple plugins simultaneously.

## Conventional Commits

All commit messages **must** follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

- **Types**: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `release`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`
- **Scopes** (optional): `admin-search`, `alt-text`, `astro-payload-richtext-lexical`, `cloudinary`, `content-translator`, `geocoding`, `pages`
- **Description**: lowercase, imperative mood, no period at the end

Examples:

- `feat(pages): add breadcrumb navigation`
- `fix(cloudinary): handle missing API key gracefully`
- `chore: update dependencies`
- `docs(alt-text): improve README examples`

This is enforced by a `commit-msg` git hook via commitlint. PR titles follow the same format (enforced by CI).

## Publishing

Publishing is done via the `Release` GitHub Actions workflow (manual dispatch). Select the plugin and bump type (patch/minor/major). The workflow bumps the version in `package.json`, verifies the changelog has a matching `## <version>` heading, publishes to npm, commits the version bump, creates a git tag, and creates a GitHub release. Do not bump versions or publish manually — the changelog entry must be committed beforehand with the target version as the heading.

## UI Components and Styling

Plugin custom components should use Payload's built-in UI components (e.g. `Pill`, `Button` from `@payloadcms/ui`) and CSS variables (e.g. `var(--style-radius-m)`, `var(--theme-elevation-500)`) instead of custom styles wherever possible. This ensures visual consistency with the Payload admin panel.

## Icons

All icons used in custom Payload components must come from the [Geist icon set](https://github.com/jarvis394/geist-icons/tree/main/source). Copy the SVG markup from the source files, replace `fill="white"` with `fill="currentColor"`, and wrap it in a React component. Do not use custom or third-party icon SVGs.

## Document ID Types

Document IDs must always support both `string` and `number` (MongoDB uses strings, PostgreSQL uses numbers). Use `DefaultDocumentIDType` from `'payload'`, or `number | string` when `payload` is not a dependency.

## Test-Driven Fixes and Features

For every new fix or feature, a failing test must be added **first** that succeeds once the fix/feature is in place. For bug fixes, the failing test must reproduce the bug as a user would observe it (wrong response, wrong UI state, wrong DB row) — not merely exercise the line being changed.

Every test must justify its existence by verifying meaningful behavior. A test earns its place only if **all** of these hold:

- It describes a user- or API-visible behavior, not an implementation detail.
- Inverting the implementation (flipping a branch, returning the opposite, deleting a guard) would make it fail.
- It survives a reasonable refactor of the code under test.
- It does not restate what TypeScript, a schema, or a constant already guarantees.

**Do not add** render-without-crashing smoke tests, prop-passthrough assertions, tests whose assertions only check that a mock was called, or tests added to hit a coverage number.

Default to integration tests against real Payload / real React rendering. Reach for unit tests only for pure logic with non-trivial branches. Only stub external boundaries: network, filesystem, time, randomness, LLM providers, third-party SDKs. If a test requires mocking the module under test's close collaborators, test at a higher level instead.

Name each test by the behavior it protects in one sentence (_"rejects a confirmation when the tool call id is unknown"_), not by the method it calls (_"calls handleConfirm with false"_).

## Changelog

Every shipped `fix` or `feat` gets **one** line in the affected plugin's `CHANGELOG.md` describing the user-visible change. The unit is "the change", not "the commit": if a PR makes multiple commits to ship the same thing, edit the existing line rather than adding a new one. Internal-only commits (`chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs` that don't change behavior) don't earn a changelog entry.

If there is no section for the upcoming version yet, add an `## Unreleased` heading at the top and list changes under it. When a version is released, the `## Unreleased` heading is replaced with the version number by the release workflow.

## Dev App Demonstrations

Every new feature added to a plugin **must** be demonstrated in that plugin's `dev/` app with a minimal, runnable use case. Tests prove correctness; the dev app proves usability. The plugin author needs to be able to click through the feature in the admin panel (or trigger it via the dev app's runtime, depending on the feature) without writing extra code.

Concretely:

- A new collection, field, or admin component → wire it into `dev/src/payload.config.ts` so it appears in the local Payload admin.
