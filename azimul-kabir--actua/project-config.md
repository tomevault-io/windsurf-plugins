# Contributor and agent guidance

## Scope and references

Actua is an independent Kotlin/Jetpack Compose Android client originally based on
[MattFaz/actuali](https://github.com/MattFaz/actuali), connecting directly to
[Actual Budget](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual). Read README.md and
BACKEND_PARITY.md before changing behavior. Preserve LICENSE and NOTICE.md credits.
Use Actuali as the portable product/behavior reference and Actual's
`packages/crdt` and `packages/loot-core` as protocol/database references. Link
specific upstream sources or commits in parity PRs. A sibling iOS checkout may
help comparison but must never be required by builds or tests.

Adapt presentation and lifecycle to Android. Do not add Apple-only integrations
or represent deferred features as working. Update BACKEND_PARITY.md when the
implementation boundary changes.

## Repository map

Sources are under `app/src/main/java/com/azimulkabir/actua/`:

- `MainActivity.kt`, `ui/navigation/`, `ui/*`: Compose screens, navigation, shared
  components and theme. Follow existing state/event patterns and Material 3.
- `data/ActuaRepository.kt`: bridge from UI models to the selected budget,
  mutation writers and sync scheduling.
- `data/budget/ActualBudgetDatabase.kt`: Actual-compatible SQLite storage and
  read models. `ActualTransactionWriter`, `ActualEntityWriter`, and
  `ActualBudgetWriter` apply mutations through the CRDT path.
- `data/sync/`: HLC, Merkle tree, protobuf wire encoding, encryption, sync client,
  status and WorkManager jobs. `data/network/ActualServerClient.kt`: server API.
- `data/rules/`, `data/schedules/`: portable financial behavior.
- `data/security/`: Android Keystore-backed credentials and encryption keys.
- `app/src/test/`: JVM JUnit tests and sync fixtures; `app/src/androidTest/`:
  AndroidJUnit4 tests for SQLite, networking, encryption and Android behavior.

## Data and sync invariants

- Preserve Actual wire compatibility: timestamp ordering, CRDT value encoding,
  protobuf fields, Merkle hashing and encryption must match upstream fixtures.
- Route synchronized mutations through existing writers and
  `applyLocalMessages`; do not bypass the message log with ad-hoc UI SQL. Keep
  multi-row changes atomic and preserve clock/Merkle persistence and scheduling.
- Monetary writes use integer cents (`Long`); avoid floating-point round trips.
  Display currency and hidden decimals must never alter stored amounts.
- Preserve Actual date encodings (including YYYYMMDD day integers), integer
  booleans, tombstones, transfer/split links, and zero/reflect budget semantics.
- Use parameterized SQL and close cursors/resources. SQLite features must work
  on the minimum supported Android version, not only the newest emulator.
- Preserve offline edits, retry/convergence behavior and per-budget isolation.
  Test migrations, restore and archive validation without destroying user data.
- Never log or commit credentials, encryption keys, real budgets or unredacted
  financial data. Use synthetic fixtures and preserve Keystore protections.

## Kotlin and Compose conventions

Match neighboring Kotlin code, naming and package layout. Reuse existing money,
calendar, database and UI helpers before adding dependencies or abstractions.
Keep composables focused on presentation; financial logic belongs in data/model
layers. Keep blocking database/network work off the main thread, respect
coroutine cancellation and resource lifetimes, and use WorkManager for durable
background work. Preserve synchronization around clocks and database writes.
Use existing theme/components, accessible labels and Android back navigation;
check small screens, keyboard/insets and font scaling for UI changes.
Keep changes focused; avoid unrelated refactors, generated files, local IDE
settings, signing material or versionCode/versionName changes unless requested.

## Build and validation

Use the committed Gradle wrapper. The daemon toolchain is JDK 25 in
`gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties`; Java/Kotlin bytecode targets Java 17,
which is not the Gradle runtime requirement. Install Android SDK 37; minSdk is
28. Dependency versions live in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug testInstrumentedUnitTest lintDebug
# With an emulator/device connected (the test build type is "instrumented"):
./gradlew connectedInstrumentedAndroidTest
# Narrow a JVM regression run where appropriate:
./gradlew testInstrumentedUnitTest --tests '*SyncCoreFixtureTest'
```

Add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior. Keep pure logic tests
in `src/test` and Android/SQLite/Keystore tests in `src/androidTest`, mirroring
packages. Never weaken assertions or regenerate upstream sync fixtures merely
to make failures pass. Validate UI changes manually on a device/emulator;
exercise API 28 for platform/SQLite compatibility changes. Report exact checks
and limitations in the PR. Documentation-only changes need format/link checks,
not a full device suite.

## Contribution and workflow safety

Every development change must start with a GitHub issue that defines the problem,
scope, and acceptance criteria. When creating that issue, first inspect the
repository's existing labels and include the appropriate labels in the issue
