# AGENTS.md

These instructions apply to the `framework/` subtree. Also follow the repository
root `AGENTS.md`.

## Project shape

- `py/flwr/` is the Python package. It is a typed package (`py.typed`) and the
  main source of truth for framework behavior.
- Unit tests live next to the code as `*_test.py` under `py/flwr/`. Follow nearby
  test style; many tests use `pytest` parametrization, some older tests use
  `unittest`. Prefer `pytest` for new tests.
- `proto/flwr/proto/` contains protobuf sources. Generated Python protobuf files
  live under `py/flwr/proto/`.
- `py/flwr/supercore/state/schema/` contains SQLAlchemy Core table metadata.
  Alembic revisions live in `py/flwr/supercore/state/alembic/versions/`.
- `docs/source/` contains Sphinx docs. `docs/build/` is generated output.
- `e2e/` contains standalone Flower apps and shell scripts used by CI.
- `docker/`, `swift/`, `kotlin/`, and `cc/` contain non-Python packaging/client
  surfaces. Keep Python framework changes separate from those unless the behavior
  actually crosses the boundary.
- Avoid editing or committing generated/cache outputs such as `.venv/`,
  `.mypy_cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `docs/build/`, and `dist/`.

## Environment and commands

Run framework commands from `framework/` unless a command is explicitly shown from
the repository root. Use Python `3.11.14` for local agent commands; CI also checks
newer Python versions, but project tooling targets Python 3.11 syntax.

Preferred local agent form:

```bash
cd framework
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 <command>
```

If the environment is missing or dependencies changed, synchronize intentionally:

```bash
cd framework
uv sync --locked --python=3.11.14 --all-extras --all-groups
```

CI installs with uv, so when reproducing CI setup exactly use:

```bash
cd framework
uv sync --locked --python=3.11.14 --all-extras --all-groups
```

Useful checks:

```bash
# Fast package-only quality gate, skips e2e/docs/copyright extras in dev/test.sh
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 ./dev/test.sh false

# Full framework quality gate used by pre-commit/CI
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 ./dev/test.sh

# Narrow tests
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 python -m pytest py/flwr/path/to_test.py
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 python -m pytest py/flwr -k "name"

# Targeted type/lint checks
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 python -m mypy py
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 python -m ruff check py/flwr --no-respect-gitignore
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 python -m pylint --ignore=py/flwr/proto py/flwr
```

`dev/test.sh` sets `RAY_ENABLE_UV_RUN_RUNTIME_ENV=0` for pytest because Ray's uv
runtime-env hook can stall under `uv run`. Use the same environment variable when
debugging Ray/simulation tests directly.

Format broadly only when appropriate:

```bash
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 ./dev/format.sh
```

For narrow edits, prefer targeted `isort`, `black`, and `ruff`
commands on the touched files. Keep `py/flwr/proto/` excluded from Python
formatters because it is generated.

## Python conventions

- Keep core `flwr` framework code ML-framework-agnostic. Do not add PyTorch,
  TensorFlow, JAX, sklearn, or similar dependencies to the core package for a
  narrow feature; e2e apps and examples carry framework-specific dependencies.
- Use explicit, typed interfaces compatible with strict mypy. Avoid untyped
  helpers unless nearby code already establishes the pattern.
- Use NumPy-style docstrings for public classes/functions. `ruff` enforces
  pydocstyle with the NumPy convention, and `docsig` checks signatures.
- Keep imports consistent with `isort` and `black` line length 88. The project
  commonly uses `from __future__ import annotations` in newer modules.
- New source files should include the Flower Apache license header matching
  nearby files.
- Prefer existing helpers for logging, exit handling, serialization, config
  parsing, and CLI errors. Do not introduce parallel utility layers without a
  concrete need.

## Public API rules

Flower's Python public API is defined by recursively following `__all__` from
`flwr/__init__.py`. See `docs/source/contributor-explanation-public-and-private-apis.rst`.

- Adding a public symbol usually requires importing it in the relevant
  `__init__.py`, adding it to `__all__`, adding/updating API docs in
  `docs/source/reference.rst`, and adding tests for the public import path.
- Do not expose implementation modules accidentally. Prefer
  `from .module import Name as Name` plus `__all__ = ["Name"]`, as nearby code
  does.
- Treat existing public behavior as compatibility-sensitive. If changing or
  removing public APIs, add deprecation handling/tests instead of hard breaks
  unless the task explicitly calls for a breaking change.

## Protobufs

- Edit `.proto` files in `proto/flwr/proto/`, not generated files in
  `py/flwr/proto/`.
- Regenerate Python protobuf outputs with:

```bash
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 ./dev/protoc.sh
```

- CI runs `./framework/dev/check-protos.sh` from the repository root. That script
  reruns generation and fails if generated files differ from `HEAD`, so in a
  local dirty worktree it can report expected uncommitted generated changes.
  Use it as a clean-tree/CI parity check.
