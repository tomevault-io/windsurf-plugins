# Splatrix project - AI Assistant Rules

## Communication Style
**MANDATORY**: Use concise military-style communication throughout all sessions.
- Direct, efficient responses
- No unnecessary explanations
- Use "Roger", "Acknowledged", "Task accomplished", etc.
- Don't use SIR, etc.
- Status-first reporting: "Completed X. Found Y. Next: Z."
- No emojis unless explicitly requested

## Core Project Rules (MANDATORY)

### 1. Simplicity & Extensibility
- Ask before implementing mid/large changes, especially when removing existing code
- If solution not 100% known, investigate first (print statements, debugging)
- Create branch for every bugfix/feature. Main branch must be stable.
- Generic base classes: Create extensible bases (`BaseImageToImageDataset`, `BaseImageToImageModel`)
- Prefer composition over subclassing
- Simple is better - prioritize maintainability and readability
- Support metadata/configs for generic dataset/task handling
- Lazy loading of heavy resources (discover from disk when needed)
- Use memory caching where appropriate
- Don't hardcode task-specific assumptions
- Don't assume dependencies if not needed for current task
- Every rule has an exception.

### 3. UI Responsiveness (CRITICAL)
**RULE**: UI must remain interactive at all times. No blocking operations in UI thread.
- All operations >100ms MUST run asynchronously
- Use Python async/await or QThread for long-running tasks
- Never call blocking I/O from UI event handlers
- Never perform heavy computations in UI thread callbacks
- Use `pyqtSignal` for thread-safe progress updates
- Progress updates must be real-time and quantitative

**Forbidden patterns**:
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Blocks UI thread
def on_button_click(self):
    result = heavy_computation()
    self.label.setText(str(result))
```

**Correct pattern**:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Async in background thread
class WorkerThread(QThread):
    progress = pyqtSignal(dict)
    finished = pyqtSignal()
    
    def run(self):
        # Heavy work here
        for item in items:
            result = process(item)
            self.progress.emit({'current': item})
```

### 4. Button State Management
**RULE**: Disable buttons when their actions cannot be executed.
Examples:
  - Disable "Start Training" when no dataset available
  - Disable "Run Inference" when required inputs missing
  - Disable "Stop" when no operation running

- Enable buttons ONLY when prerequisites met
- Update button states immediately on state changes

## Project Structure

## Technology Stack
- **Python 3.10+** with type hints
- **PyQt6** for UI (migration to QML planned)
- **pyqtgraph** for real-time plotting
- **asyncio** for async operations
- **Conda** environment: `splatrix`
- ** Everything else which is required for splatrix

## Coding Patterns

### Type Safety
- **Prefer Enums over lists of strings** for representing fixed sets of states, categories, or options (e.g. `Stage`, `PipelineState`). Enums provide type safety, IDE support, and a single source of truth.
- **Use explicit state machines for UI state transitions** (e.g. `transitions` library). Never rely on ad-hoc boolean flags or nullable references to track lifecycle states like idle/running/cancelling. Define states as Enums, transitions as declarative rules, and guard all entry points via the machine.

## AI Assistant Behavior

### When Working
1. Read relevant docs FIRST if uncertain
2. Investigate before implementing (use grep, codebase_search)
3. Fix errors immediately when introduced
4. Test button states when modifying UI
5. Check linter after file edits
6. Keep working until task complete (don't stop to ask permission)
7. Create TODOs for complex multi-step tasks
8. Update TODOs as work progresses

### When Uncertain
1. Ask clarifying questions (concisely)
2. Propose approach before large changes
3. Reference PROJECT_RULES or UI_DEVELOPMENT_MANIFEST

### File Operations
- Don't use cat/sed/awk for file reading/editing (use read_file, search_replace)
- Run commands in sandbox when possible
- Request permissions (git_write, network) only when needed

### Documentation Policy
**RULE**: Minimize documentation overhead. User doesn't read extensive docs.

**Write documents ONLY for**:
- Critical architecture decisions that affect multiple files
- Non-obvious technical solutions that will be needed again
- Setup/installation steps that must be reproduced

**DO NOT write**:
- FIX_*.md for every bug fix
- DEBUG_*.md for troubleshooting steps
- Detailed changelogs
- Approach comparison documents (unless explicitly requested)
- Documents that duplicate code comments

**Instead**:
- Put critical info in code comments
- Update README.md for major features
- Use inline documentation
- Explain in chat response, don't create file

## Quick Commands

### Run UI
```bash
conda activate splatrix
cd /home/alexander.obuschenko/Projects/splatrix
python -m splatrix.main_qml
# or
python run.py
```
