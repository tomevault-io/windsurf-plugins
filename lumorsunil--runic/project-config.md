description: Keep top-level folders predictable: place interpreter sources and shared utilities under `src/`, CLI front-ends under `cmd/`, integration fixtures in `examples/`, and human-readable specs inside `docs/`. Create `tests/` for integration-style suites and reserve `assets/` for longer sample scripts, diagrams, or benchmark data. Even though the repo currently ships a single `README.md`, follow this layout when adding files so newcomers can locate runtime, parser, and documentation modules instantly.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Keep top-level folders predictable: place interpreter sources and shared utilities under `src/`, CLI front-ends under `cmd/`, integration fixtures in `examples/`, and human-readable specs inside `docs/`. Create `tests/` for integration-style suites and reserve `assets/` for longer sample scripts, diagrams, or benchmark data. Even though the repo currently ships a single `README.md`, follow this layout when adding files so newcomers can locate runtime, parser, and documentation modules instantly.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use the native toolchain of the implementation language for formatting, linting, building, and testing. Document the canonical commands in the README (e.g., formatter → linter → build → test) so contributors can follow the same workflow. When working on experimental Runic programs inside `examples/`, prefer invoking the emerging CLI or REPL (`cmd/` binaries) the same way users eventually will, e.g., `path/to/repl -- path/to/script.rn`, so behavior mirrors production expectations.
When working in Zig (currently version 0.15.1), reference the official documentation at www.ziglang.org so guidance stays aligned with the upstream tooling.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow the idioms of the chosen language (folder structure, naming, indentation) and keep functions short and domain-specific. Extract parser or runtime helpers into submodules inside `src/` to avoid monolithic files. Always run the language-appropriate formatter before opening a PR, treat lint warnings as errors, name Runic files with the `.rn` extension, and keep command invocations column-aligned for readability.

## Testing Guidelines
Place unit tests alongside their modules when the language supports it and rely on `tests/` for public API and CLI smoke suites. Favor table-driven cases for quoting and pipeline semantics. Every new feature should include at least one regression test covering both success and failure flows; when behavior spans multiple binaries, prefer snapshot-style tests under `tests/cli_*`. After making changes, run a local regression pass before concluding the work. Use the broader combination-oriented Runic suite in `tests/features/feature_combinations.rn` alongside the rest of the suite so interactions between features are exercised, not just isolated primitives. If the regression pass exposes issues in the recent implementation, continue by investigating and fixing those failures as part of the same task. Run the full test suite locally before pushing and note any ignored tests in the PR body.

## Backlog Hygiene
Keep [todo.md](todo.md) aligned with the current implementation. If you implement or fix an item that is already tracked there, update the checklist entry in the same change instead of leaving stale backlog state behind.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Adopt a Conventional Commits prefix (`parser:`, `runtime:`, `docs:`) plus an imperative summary under 72 characters, e.g., `runtime: enforce exit code propagation`. Each PR should describe motivation, implementation notes, and verification steps; link issues with `Fixes #ID` and attach logs or terminal transcripts demonstrating the change. Keep PRs narrowly scoped and request reviews only after formatting, linting, and tests pass.
