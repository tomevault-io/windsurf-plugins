# ACE-Framework Cursor Rules
# This file configures AI behavior in Cursor IDE

## Project Context

This project uses the ACE-Framework (AI-assisted Code Engineering) v2.0.
All AI interactions should follow the BMAD methodology: Analyze → Plan → Execute → Verify.

## Required Reading on Session Start

Before any task, read these files:
1. .aceconfig - Core rules and configuration
2. .ace/roles/roles.md - Available roles and their responsibilities
3. docs/context/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md - Current session state
4. docs/rca/regression-guards.yaml - Protected files and invariants

## Core Rules

1. Never commit secrets, credentials, or API keys
2. All code must pass linting before commit
3. Follow patterns established in docs/adr/
4. Update ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md after each session
5. Verify against .ace/standards/ before completing any task
6. Generate IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md before writing code
7. Every task follows BMAD: Analyze → Plan → Execute → Verify
8. Create ADR for any significant architectural decision
9. Atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages
10. No code generation without reading existing code first
11. Check regression guards before modifying any guarded file
12. Every issue requires RCA with regression prevention

## Standards

When writing code, follow:
- .ace/standards/coding.md - Code quality rules
- .ace/standards/security.md - Security requirements (CRITICAL)
- .ace/standards/architecture.md - Design patterns
- .ace/standards/git-workflow.md - Commit and branching conventions

## Available Roles

Activate appropriate role for the task:
- Architect (PLANNING) - System design and planning
- Developer (EXECUTION) - Implementation and testing
- QA Engineer (VERIFICATION) - Testing and validation
- Incident Responder (INCIDENT) - RCA and fixes

## Skills

For specialized tasks, apply relevant skill:
- .ace/skills/api-design.md
- .ace/skills/database-operations.md
- .ace/skills/migration-logic.md
- .ace/skills/refactoring.md
- .ace/skills/root-cause-analysis.md
- .ace/skills/testing-strategy.md
- .ace/skills/code-review.md

## Before Modifying Files

1. Check docs/rca/regression-guards.yaml for guards
2. If file is guarded, read the associated RCA
3. Understand invariants that must be maintained
4. Run regression tests after modification

## Session Protocol

Start: "Read .aceconfig, .ace/roles/roles.md, and ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md"
End: "Update ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md with completed work and next steps"

## Response Format

- Be specific about file locations
- Reference relevant standards/ADRs
- Follow established code patterns in docs/context/system_patterns.md
- Update ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md when significant progress is made
