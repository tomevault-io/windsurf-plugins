description: Repository architecture literacy — read docs before large edits and preserve layering

# FlexPrice architecture rule

Before substantive work (new features, refactors, integrations, Temporal changes, Kafka topics, migrations):

1. **Read orientation docs** under `docs/` in this order when scope is ambiguous:
   - `docs/REPO_MAP.md` — census and boundaries  
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — principles and conventions  
   - `docs/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` — coupling and hotspots context  
   - `docs/HOTSPOTS.md` — avoid enlarging risky areas blindly  
   - `docs/FLOWS/*.md` — when touching authentication, metering, billing, invoices, subscriptions, webhooks, or retries  

2. **Trace dependencies before editing** — follow constructor wiring from `cmd/server/main.go`, service interfaces in `internal/service`, and domain contracts in `internal/domain`. Prefer explicit injection over widening hidden globals.

3. **Preserve layering** — domain packages do not import repositories or HTTP layers. Handlers delegate to services. Do not bypass services for transactional rules.

4. **Minimize coupling and blast radius** — prefer localized diffs in the bounded context already owning the behavior. Avoid “drive-by” refactors unrelated to the ticket.

5. **No silent architecture changes** — if you materially change pipelines (Kafka topics/groups), deployment modes, Temporal schedules, tenancy/RBAC semantics, or data stores, update the matching `docs/*` sections in the same change when practical.

6. **Generated code discipline** — do not hand-edit Ent outputs under `repository/ent` or generated SDK trees; edit schema/spec + run documented `make` targets.

7. **Graphify** — When `graphify-out/graph.json` exists, prefer `graphify query` / `path` / `explain` before undirected codebase search. After structural code changes, run `graphify update .` so the graph matches the tree (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` Graphify section).
