# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
- ShipSwift iOS component template library (public repo)

## Directory Structure
- Reusable components live under `ShipSwift/SWPackage/` in five directories:
  - `SWAnimation/` — Self-contained animation components (each works independently, may depend on SWUtil only)
  - `SWChart/` — Self-contained chart components (each works independently, may depend on SWUtil only)
  - `SWComponent/` — Self-contained UI components organized by category:
    - `Display/` — Display components (FloatingLabels, MarkdownText, ScrollingFAQ, RotatingQuote, BulletPointText, GradientDivider, Label, OnboardingView, OrderView, RootTabView)
    - `Feedback/` — Feedback components (Alert, Loading, ThinkingIndicator)
    - `Input/` — Input components (TabButton, Stepper, AddSheet)
  - `SWModule/` — Multi-file frameworks (SWAuth, SWCamera, SWPaywall, SWChat, SWSetting, SWSubjectLifting, SWTikTokTracking)
  - `SWUtil/` — Shared utilities (no dependencies on other SWPackage directories)
- Showcase app views live under `ShipSwift/View/` (HomeView, ChatView, ComponentView, ProPaywallView, RootTabView, SettingView, ShipSwiftAuthView)
- App services live under `ShipSwift/Service/` (ChatService, ComponentRegistry)
- Shared app components live under `ShipSwift/Component/` (ListItem)

## Naming Conventions
- All type names use the `SW` prefix: `SWAlertManager`, `SWStoreManager`, `SWCameraView`
- View modifier methods use `.sw` lowercase prefix: `.swAlert()`, `.swPageLoading()`, `.swPrimary`
- File names match their primary type: `SWAlert.swift` contains `SWAlertManager`
- **Platform suffix rule**: iOS-only files use `+iOS` suffix (e.g. `SWCameraManager+iOS.swift`), macOS-only files use `+macOS` suffix. Cross-platform files have no suffix
- **Xcode Build Phases reminder**: This project supports both iOS and macOS. When adding a `+iOS` or `+macOS` file, remind the user to set the platform filter in Xcode → Build Phases → Compile Sources (change "Always Used" to "iOS" or "macOS"). Do NOT use `#if os(iOS)` / `#if os(macOS)` as a substitute

## Dependency Rules
- `SWUtil` has zero dependencies on other SWPackage directories
- `SWAnimation`, `SWChart`, and `SWComponent` may only depend on `SWUtil`
- `SWModule` may depend on `SWUtil`, `SWComponent`, and other files within the same module

## Self-Containment Principle
- Every file in `SWAnimation/`, `SWChart/`, and `SWComponent/` must work without importing other SWPackage files (except `SWUtil`)
- Alert and Loading merge their managers into the same file for self-containment
- CameraManager uses an `onError` closure instead of directly referencing `SWAlertManager`

## Code Style
- All comments and documentation in English (this is a public repo; overrides the global Chinese rule)
- No external constants file — product IDs, URLs, and config values are inlined or configurable via struct properties
