# Repository Guidelines

You just need to finish the notebook instead of compiling the mkdocs code.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is a MkDocs Material documentation site. Source content lives in `docs/`, with Markdown pages grouped by topic:

- `docs/incourse/`: course notes and resources.
- `docs/article/`: reading notes and outside-study articles.
- `docs/tools/`, `docs/life/`, `docs/friends.md`: site sections and standalone pages.
- `docs/css/` and `docs/_js/`: custom styles and scripts loaded by `mkdocs.yml`.
- `docs/smaterials/`: downloadable PDFs, ZIPs, and other course materials.
- `overrides/`: MkDocs Material template overrides.
- `site/`: generated static output; avoid editing it directly unless intentionally updating built artifacts.

Navigation, theme settings, plugins, Markdown extensions, CSS, and JavaScript entries are configured in `mkdocs.yml`.


## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use 4-space indentation for YAML, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript changes where indentation is needed. Keep Markdown filenames and nav entries stable; changing a path requires updating `mkdocs.yml`. Prefer concise Markdown headings, fenced code blocks with language tags, and standard LaTeX math syntax when needed. When writing documentation content, favor MkDocs Material blocks such as `!!! note`, `!!! tip`, and `=== "Tab"` for callouts and grouped content instead of stacking many `###` headings. Use `camelCase` for JavaScript variables/functions and keep custom CSS selectors descriptive.


## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history uses Conventional Commit prefixes such as `feat:` and `docs:`, alongside short imperative summaries. Prefer Conventional Commits, for example:

```text
docs: add quantum lecture notes
feat: update course navigation
```

Pull requests should include a brief description, affected directories or pages, screenshots for visible UI/style changes, and links to related issues when applicable. Note whether `mkdocs build` passed locally.

## Agent-Specific Notes

Keep edits focused on source files under `docs/`, `overrides/`, and `mkdocs.yml`. Do not introduce dependency managers or generated fallback code unless the project explicitly needs them.
