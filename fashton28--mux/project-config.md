# mux

A Claude Code session manager that lives in your terminal (a tmux overlay).

## Full context for agents

Before working in this repo, read **`context/CLAUDE.md`** - it holds the complete project context:
design decisions, the `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` discovery, the issue breakdown (#1-#8), the
testing seam, conventions, and a running implementation log. The canonical shareable spec is GitHub
issue #1 (the PRD); a copy lives at `context/prd-mux-session-manager.md`.

> Note: `context/` is git-ignored, so it is local to this machine, not committed. Keep its working log
> and implementation status up to date as slices land.

## Definition of done

Every issue's completion requires running `/no-mistakes` (automated review, tests, lint, docs, PR, CI).
See issue #8 for the hook that enforces this.
