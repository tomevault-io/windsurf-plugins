cd endor-labs-gemini-extension
gemini extensions link .
```

### Usage

Once installed, you can use natural language prompts within the Gemini CLI to interact with Endor Labs:

#### Initialize Endor Labs
```bash
gemini> Initialize Endor Labs with Google authentication
gemini> Set up Endor Labs for this project
```

#### Security Scanning
```bash
gemini> Scan my project for security vulnerabilities
gemini> Check dependencies for known CVEs
gemini> Generate a security report for this repository
```
