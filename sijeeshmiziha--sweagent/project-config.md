# Tool Evaluation and Improvement

## Mindset

- Tools are contracts between deterministic systems and **non-deterministic agents**; design for agents, not just for APIs.
- Use **evaluation** to measure and improve tool effectiveness.

## Process

1. **Prototype**: Build a quick prototype (e.g. MCP server or tools passed into the API); test locally and collect user feedback.
2. **Evaluate**: Run a **programmatic evaluation**—one agentic loop per task, each with a single task prompt and your tools.
3. **Analyze**: Read transcripts and reasoning; identify where agents get stuck or misuse tools.
4. **Collaborate**: Feed evaluation transcripts into an agent (e.g. Claude Code) to refactor tools and descriptions; use a **held-out test set** to avoid overfitting.

## Evaluation Tasks

- Ground tasks in **real-world use**; prefer multi-step, multi-tool scenarios over trivial sandbox prompts.
- Pair each prompt with a **verifiable outcome** (exact match or LLM-as-judge). Avoid verifiers that reject correct answers due to formatting or phrasing.
- In evaluation system prompts, ask agents to output **reasoning or feedback blocks** (or use extended thinking) to diagnose why tools are or aren’t used.

## Metrics

- Track **accuracy** plus: tool-call count, token consumption, tool errors, runtime.
- Redundant tool calls may suggest pagination or token limits; many invalid-parameter errors may suggest clearer descriptions or examples.

## Analysis

- Read evaluation agents’ reasoning and raw transcripts (including tool calls and responses); “read between the lines”—agents don’t always say what they mean.
- Use metrics to spot improvement areas: e.g. rightsizing pagination, clarifying parameter descriptions, consolidating common workflows.
