# 2027-cyber-jobs

A job board rendered by GitHub. `listings.json` holds every accepted role, the `README.md`
tables and `companies.md` are rebuilt from it, and GitHub Actions do all the writing on `main`.
The audience is cybersecurity students, so the intern and new-grad tables come first and a
change is judged by what a student sees. A wrong row on the board costs more than a missed one.

## Charter

A row belongs only if it is all three: a cybersecurity role (or any engineering role at a
`security_company: true` employer), internship or new grad or 0 to 2 years, and in the US or
Remote (US). CONTRIBUTING.md states the rules for humans; `classify.evaluate_job` is the
executable version, and the two must agree.

## Who writes what

Bots own these on `main`: `listings.json`, the README tables and stats block, `companies.md`,
and `.github/data/`. Change the board by changing its inputs (`companies.yml`, the scripts, or
an approved issue), never by editing the outputs.

Three workflows share the `readme-updates` concurrency group and commit as
`github-actions[bot]`: the scrape at 11:17 and 23:17 UTC, the link check at 09:43 UTC that
marks 🔒, and add-listing when a maintainer applies the `approved` label. Each runs
`check_outputs.py` before committing, and `health.yml` runs `health_check.py` after each one to
keep the "Scraper health" issue current. A branch a day old is
behind `main`. Rebase before opening a PR, and take `main` for any conflict in a bot-owned file.

## Module map

- `classify.py` is the taxonomy and the US location rules. Stdlib only, so
  `test_classification.py` runs on a bare interpreter and the scraper, the issue flow and the
  tests share one source of truth.
- `common.py` is URL normalisation and issue-body parsing, shared for the same reason: dedup
  only works when the scraper and the submission flow normalise identically.
- `scrape_jobs.py` owns one `scrape_<ats>` function per platform, persistence
  (`seen_jobs.json` is per-posting last-seen, `board_baseline.json` is per-board counts for the
  silent-board alarm), and `main()`, which runs purge, renormalise, reclassify, the
  stored-row re-evaluation, the location repair, the vanished-req retire and the orphan retire
  (a row whose company has no board for its source in `companies.yml`) over existing rows
  before dedup and insert of new ones.
- `check_links.py` is the daily link check. It only visits rows the scraper cannot retire:
  Community rows, amazon.jobs rows and rows with no req id in the URL. A 404 or 410 closes the
  row on its second day. For a Community row, a 200 whose `<title>` reads as not found or is
  empty, or a redirect that drops the req id, closes it on its third day, and a Community row
  120 days old ages out.
- `notify.py` turns the events file a scrape or add-listing run writes into a GitHub Release
  and one comment per matching alert issue, unlocking and relocking each thread.
  `test_notify.py` covers it.
- `compare_runs.py` diffs two dry-run logs; see "Verifying a scraper change".
- `rebuild_readme.py` regenerates the tables between the `TABLE_START <type>` markers.
- `validate_issue.py` and `process_approved.py` are the community path: issue form, one
  advisory verdict comment edited in place, `approved` label, row added, issue closed after
  the push lands. `test_community.py` covers them.
- `check_outputs.py` and `health_check.py` are stdlib-only guards on the bot's output and runs;
  `test_health.py` covers them. Against main's listings.json, `check_outputs.py` also fails a
  new scraped row the charter rules reject and a run that closes more than a quarter of the
  open rows. Rerun the writer by hand with `allow_mass_close` once the cause is understood.
- `build_site.py` turns `site/` (plain HTML, CSS and JS, no build step) and `listings.json` into
  the untracked `_site/`: the Pages board, its trimmed data file and the Atom feeds.
  `pages.yml` deploys it after each writer finishes, because a push made with `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  starts no Pages build. `test_site.py` covers it.

## Changing the classifier

Every keyword or location change lands with a case in `test_classification.py`, and the PR
names the example titles that flip. Rejects are cheap. An accept rule costs precision, so it
needs a real title the current rules miss and a reason no existing rule should catch it.
Every rule reaches existing rows on the next scrape. Each row gets the title rules under its
company's current `security_company` flag, and a row whose posting is still in the feed also
goes through the full `judge_job` pipeline, which drops it or refreshes its type, category and
🇺🇸 flag. A missing description never drops a row. A new category is added in `CATEGORY_RULES` and in the issue template
dropdown together.

## Verifying a scraper change

1. `ruff check .github/scripts`, then every test script under `.github/scripts/`:
   `test_classification.py`, `test_scrapers.py`, `test_community.py`, `test_health.py`,
   `test_notify.py` and `test_site.py`. All offline, and `tests.yml` runs the same set.
2. `scrape_jobs.py --dry-run --board <ats> --limit 3` while iterating on one parser.
3. A full `--dry-run` on `main` and on the branch, minutes apart, each redirected to a log,
