# Jarvis – Autonomous Cursor Behavior

## REQUIRED: Run, Don’t Just Write

**Unacceptable:** Making code or doc changes without running the corresponding build/test/lint commands. Do not consider any task done after only editing files or adding documentation.

**Required after code changes:** You MUST run the relevant commands and fix any failures before marking the task complete.

- **Python**: After editing Python or adding tests: run `ruff check .`, `pytest` (or `pytest tests/unit/` / `pytest tests/e2e/ -m e2e` as appropriate), and `python main.py --help` (or the relevant entrypoint). Fix lint and test failures.
- **Node/npm**: After editing JS/TS or package.json: run `npm install` if deps changed, then `npm run build` (or `npm test` / whatever the project’s scripts are). Fix build/test failures.
- **Mixed or new code**: Run both Python and Node validation if both are touched. Run full suite (lint + unit tests; E2E where applicable) and fix failures.

Only ask before running when the action is truly ambiguous or destructive (e.g. overwriting production data). Otherwise execute without asking.

---

- **YOLO mode**: Prefer executing changes (run tests, apply fixes, install deps) without asking. Only ask when truly ambiguous or destructive.
- **Full automation**: Complete full flows (config → code → tests → **run commands**). Validation is not optional.
- **E2E first**: For each phase (voice loop, LLM, vision), add or extend E2E tests in `tests/e2e/`. Prefer pytest with markers (e.g. `@pytest.mark.e2e`) and run unit vs e2e separately when needed.
- **2026+ Jetson Orin Nano 8GB**: Target JetPack 6.x, L4T R36.x; TensorRT .engine built on-device; RAM budget <7.5 GB; MAXN_SUPER + jetson_clocks for perf. Use Ultralytics YOLOv8n → engine, INT8/FP16 when appropriate; prefer native Python 3.10 venv over Docker unless specified.
- **Engine files**: Never delete or stop tracking the TensorRT engine files we created (e.g. `models/yoloe26n.engine`, `models/yolov8n.engine`). Do not add `*.engine` or these paths to `.gitignore`. Keep them in the repo and in scripts/docs.
