# Copilot Global Instructions

You are working on a **Next.js 16** project using the **App Router**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Supabase** as the backend.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16.x (App Router, `src/app/`)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (utility-first)
- **Backend/DB:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, RLS)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (via GitHub Actions CI/CD)
- **Package Manager:** npm

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Read the docs first.** Next.js 16 has breaking changes. Always check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before implementing any Next.js API. Heed deprecation notices.
2. **Server Components by default.** Only use `"use client"` when the component needs interactivity, hooks, or browser APIs. Keep Client Components at the leaves of the component tree.
3. **Async APIs.** In Next.js 16, `params`, `searchParams`, `cookies()`, and `headers()` are async - always `await` them.
4. **No local test data.** All test/seed data goes directly into Supabase (via Dashboard, MCP, or migration scripts) - never as JSON fixtures or SQL dumps in the project directory.
5. **Environment variables.** Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix only for variables that must be accessible in the browser. Server-only secrets (e.g. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) must never be prefixed.
6. **Schema awareness.** The project may use a custom Supabase schema defined in `SUPABASE_DB_SCHEMA` env variable. Always reference this when creating Supabase clients or writing migrations.
7. **Supabase Docker creation.** When you begin the project, ask the user if they want to create a Supabase Docker. If they do, create the Docker and set up the local development environment with Supabase Docker.
8. **Correct usage of dashes.** Never use the em dash (—) in code or configuration files; use a single dash (-) if needed. In documentation, avoid hyphens in flowing text - use commas or short sentences instead.
9. **Vercel-Ready app** when deployed. The app must run without errors on Vercel. Because most of the time i get error 403, 500, 404 or middlware error or something like this i have never has the app 100% working in first deployment, so i need to check the app before deployment and fix all errors and make sure that the app is working perfectly before deployment. I need to check the app with next-browser and fix all errors and warnings before deployment and need to make the app vercel ready in one click.


## Additional App Creation Rules

When creating a new app or major app surface, always follow these rules:

1. **Mandatory multilingual support (EN + DE) using Next.js App Router and next-intl.**
  - Implement next-intl specifically configured for the Next.js App Router architecture.
	- Always use the `useTranslations` hook for all user-facing text. Never hardcode strings in components.
	- Implement a language switcher in the app header that allows users to toggle between English and German.
	- Store and  maintain translations in dedicated JSON files (e.g. `en.json`, `de.json`) and configure next-intl routing accordingly.
	- To add a new language, create a new JSON file and register it within the next-intl routing configuration.
2. **Mandatory light and dark themes.**
	- Every app must support both light mode and dark mode.
	- Ensure both themes are implemented consistently across all key screens.
3. **Branding and homepage quality.**
	- Create a unique, meaningful, and professional app logo.
	- Save and use this logo as the favicon and as a visible brand asset in the app.
	- Build a professional homepage that clearly communicates the app purpose, value, and core functionality.
4. **Legal content in footer.**
	- Use legal documents from the `legal-docs` folder.
	- Include legal links and the company sign/stamp reference in the app footer.

## Workflow Orchestration

### First: Ask the User About Their Database Setup

At the **start of every new project or major feature**, always ask:

> "How do you want to work with Supabase for this project?"
> - **(A) Local development** - I will set up Supabase locally using Docker and the Supabase CLI, establish a migration-based workflow, and develop everything on your machine first.
> - **(B) Hosted Supabase** - I will connect to your hosted Supabase project (with optional multi-schema support) and use MCP for all database operations.

- If the user chooses **(A)**: follow the `localsupabase.instructions.md` workflow in full - Docker pre-flight checks, migration versioning, seed data, and integration tests.
- If the user chooses **(B)**: follow the `supabase.instructions.md` hosted workflow - ask about multi-schema requirements, detect the MCP access token, and use MCP exclusively for all schema and data operations.
- If the context makes the choice obvious (e.g. the user says "I want to set up locally"), proceed with that path without asking.

### Planning
- For ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions): use the `@planner` agent first. Do not start coding without a plan.
- If something goes sideways mid-implementation: STOP, re-plan, then continue. Do not keep pushing broken code.
