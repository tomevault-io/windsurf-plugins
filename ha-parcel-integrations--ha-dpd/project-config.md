# Working in this repository

Home Assistant custom integration for DPD parcel tracking. Distributed via HACS;
not part of HA core. **Silver** quality tier, minimum HA `2024.7.0`. No DTO layer.

## Shared conventions — fetch when relevant

Suite-wide rules live in
[`.github/CONVENTIONS.md`](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/.github/blob/main/CONVENTIONS.md)
and are **not** repeated here. Don't fetch it every session — fetch it **before**
you act in one of these areas:

| Before you … | Fetch `CONVENTIONS.md` § |
|---|---|
| touch entities, sensors, config/options flow, coordinator, diagnostics, translations | *Home Assistant developer docs* (its table points on to the canonical HA page — don't rely on memory) |
| add/rename a parcel field, a `ParcelStatus`, or a bus event; change first-refresh or unmapped-status logging | *Parcel contract* (this repo implements it; below is only where DPD deviates) |
| consider "fixing" a lint/pattern the skill flags (poll interval, inline client) | *Deliberate skill divergences* — likely intentional, don't re-flag |
| commit, bump, tag, release, or write release notes; add a feature without a test | *Workflow / Commits / Versioning / Testing* |

**API mechanics live in `carrier-research/api/dpd/` (private research repo)** — the Keycloak
auth flow (`auth.md`), the parcels/detail endpoints + status-description and 68-code
GSMT event vocabulary (`parcels.md`), and the FMP delivery-window fetch (`fmp.md`).
Do not duplicate them here.

**Suite-wide tripwire, kept inline on purpose:** the first refresh runs in
`__init__.py` *before* `async_forward_entry_setups`, never in a platform — from a
forwarded platform HA can't catch `ConfigEntryNotReady` and half-sets-up the
entry. Runtime-only; the tests don't catch a regression here.

## Load-bearing DPD decisions — do not refactor away

**Auth & setup**
- **Auth-tier 5xx → `ConfigEntryNotReady`**: when Keycloak returns a non-JSON 5xx
  page, `api.py` raises `DpdApiError(status_code)` before parsing; `__init__.py`
  maps it to `ConfigEntryNotReady` (retry with backoff) instead of crashing on a
  `JSONDecodeError` or forcing reauth.
- **Reauth** uses `async_update_reload_and_abort`; the confirm step guards with
  `async_set_unique_id` + `_abort_if_unique_id_mismatch` so a *different* account's
  credentials abort instead of rebinding.
- **Options flow** has no `entry.add_update_listener` — `async_schedule_reload` on
  submit. `CONF_REFRESH_INTERVAL` = 15/30/60/120/240 min, default 30.
- `aiohttp.ClientError` is not caught in the coordinator (wrapped automatically).
  Config: `ConfigEntry.runtime_data` (`DpdData`), `PARALLEL_UPDATES = 0`,
  coordinator takes `config_entry=entry`.

**Business unit**
- **Only `DPD-NL` is mapped** in `BUSINESS_UNITS`. Setup is BU-agnostic but the
  tracking-URL builder (`_tracking_url`) hardcodes `/nl/` — **update it too if you
  add a BU**. The user step's `description` links a pre-filled "Add country" issue.

**Status & pickup**
- The raw description lives on `raw_status`, never `status`; unmapped →
  `ParcelStatus.UNKNOWN` + one-shot WARNING (`_unknown_descriptions_logged` /
  `_unknown_event_types_logged`). `KNOWN_DESCRIPTIONS` and `_DESCRIPTION_MAP` both
  need updating on a new DPD lifecycle stage.
- **ParcelShop sensors**: `DpdEnRouteToParcelShopSensor` counts `pickup` parcels
  with `status != at_pickup_point`; `DpdAwaitingPickupSensor` counts
  `status == at_pickup_point` — confirm against a real parcelshop parcel if one
  appears.

**Detail cache & FMP (cost control)**
- **`_detail_cache`** (keyed by barcode, integration-lifetime) lazily fills
  `receiver` / `weight` / `dimensions` — at most one detail call per parcel. A
  **failed** call is cached (not retried every poll) and retried once the parcel's
  status moves — one hiccup must not mean missing data until restart.
- **FMP delivery-window fetch is best-effort** (any failure → `None`, poll
  continues); `planned_from`/`planned_to` reflect the FMP hour window when present,
  else the calendar-day window in the parcel's local tz.

**History (opt-in, default OFF — `CONF_INCLUDE_HISTORY`)**
- **No new endpoint** — reuse the detail call. With the option on, the cache stores
  the status and refetches detail when a barcode's status moves (history grows on a
  status change); with it off the cache is never refetched. **Do not collapse back
  into "fetch once, forever".** History reuses the parcel maps (we map only the
  consumer-realistic subset of DPD's event codes — see `carrier-research/api/dpd/`).

**Outgoing (own shipments + returns) & events**
- DPD splits server-side into `incomingShipments` / `sendingShipments`, so a return
  the account ships back lands in `sendingShipments` and flows into the outgoing
  sensors automatically — **no `isReturn` filtering** needed here (unlike DHL).
- `_async_update_data` splits `sendingShipments` into active + delivered (via the
  shared `_apply_delivered_filter`), feeding `DpdOutgoingDeliveredParcelsSensor`.
- Incoming events run over **active + delivered** combined (terminal hop → only
  `_delivered`; `delivery_time_changed` only on a non-null `planned_*` that
  differs). Outgoing events over `outgoing_active + outgoing_delivered`; `delivered`
