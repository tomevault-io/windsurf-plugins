# Repository instructions

## Synchronized bilingual documentation

- Root `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` are one synchronized documentation artifact.
- Each Agent's `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` are also synchronized pairs.
- Feature, installation, configuration, command, behavior, limitation, and test changes must
  update the applicable English and Chinese files together.
- Keep commands, paths, identifiers, environment variables, model IDs, limits, and status
  values identical between languages.

## Repository hygiene

- Never commit API keys, `.env`, downloaded papers, session databases, generated runs,
  caches, virtual environments, or personal outlines and request files.
- Public examples must contain placeholder credentials and redistributable content only.
