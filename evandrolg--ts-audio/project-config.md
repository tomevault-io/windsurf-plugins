# Cursor Rules for ts-audio Project

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript audio library that provides audio playback, playlist management, and Web Audio API integration. The project uses **Bun** as its runtime and package manager, follows strict TypeScript standards, and includes comprehensive testing with Bun's built-in test runner.

## Code Style & Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration (strict: true, noImplicitAny: true, strictNullChecks: true)
- Always provide explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Use interfaces for object shapes and types for unions/primitives
- Prefer `const` over `let`, use `let` only when reassignment is necessary
- Use `readonly` for immutable properties
- Implement proper error handling with typed error objects

### Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces (e.g., `AudioClass`, `EventEmitter`)
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods (e.g., `audioCtx`, `preloadFile`)
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `defaultStates`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose and functionality
- Prefix private properties with underscore (e.g., `_file`, `_audioCtx`)

### File Organization

- Keep related functionality in dedicated modules (audio/, playlist/, etc.)
- Use index.ts files for clean public API exports
- Separate test files in `__tests__` directories
- Maintain clear separation between core logic and utilities

## Architecture Patterns

### Class Design

- Follow single responsibility principle - each class should have one clear purpose
- Use composition over inheritance where possible
- Implement proper encapsulation with private/public methods
- Use dependency injection for external dependencies (e.g., AudioContext)

### Event Handling

- Use the EventEmitter pattern for decoupled communication
- Define clear event types and interfaces
- Implement proper event cleanup and memory management
- Use typed event data structures

### Audio Implementation

- Leverage Web Audio API (AudioContext, AudioBufferSourceNode)
- Handle AudioContext state management (suspended, running, closed)
- Implement proper resource cleanup and disposal
- Use async/await for audio operations (decodeAudioData, resume)

## Testing Standards

### Bun Testing

- Write comprehensive unit tests for all public methods
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Mock external dependencies using `mock.module()` from `bun:test`
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Use beforeEach/afterEach for proper test isolation
- Verify method calls and state changes
- Import test utilities from `bun:test`: `describe`, `test`, `expect`, `beforeEach`, `mock`, `spyOn`

### Test Structure

- Group related tests using `describe` blocks
- Use `test` or `it` for individual test cases
- Use `mock.module()` for mocking modules (replaces `jest.mock()`)
- Use `spyOn()` for spying on methods (replaces `jest.spyOn()`)
- Clear test data setup and verification
- Tests use happy-dom for browser API simulation

## Error Handling

### Audio Context Errors

- Handle AudioContext state transitions gracefully
- Implement proper error recovery for suspended contexts
- Provide meaningful error messages for debugging
- Use try-catch blocks for audio operations

### Resource Management

- Implement proper cleanup for audio resources
- Handle file loading failures gracefully
- Manage memory usage for large audio files
- Provide fallback behavior when possible

## Performance Considerations

### Audio Preloading

- Implement intelligent preloading strategies
- Limit concurrent preload operations
- Use appropriate buffer sizes for different audio formats
- Consider memory constraints for mobile devices

### Event Optimization

- Minimize event listener overhead
- Use event delegation where appropriate
- Implement proper event cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Documentation

### Code Comments

- Use JSDoc comments for public methods and classes
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Explain non-obvious implementation details
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### API Documentation

- Provide clear examples for common use cases
- Document configuration options and their effects
- Explain event types and their data structures
- Include performance considerations and limitations

## Security & Best Practices

### Audio File Handling

- Validate file paths and URLs
- Implement proper CORS handling for cross-origin audio
- Sanitize user input for file operations
- Handle malicious or corrupted audio files gracefully

### Web Audio API

- Respect user gesture requirements for audio playback
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Handle browser compatibility issues
- Provide fallbacks for unsupported features

## Build & Development

### Runtime & Package Manager

- This project uses **Bun** as the JavaScript runtime and package manager
- Use `bun install` to install dependencies
- Use `bun test` to run tests
- Use `bun run <script>` to run package.json scripts
