# Ralph Wiggum Extension

This extension implements the Ralph Wiggum technique - continuous self-referential AI loops for interactive iterative development.

## What is the Ralph Wiggum Technique?

The Ralph Wiggum technique is an iterative development methodology based on continuous AI loops.

**Core concept:**
The same prompt is fed to the AI repeatedly. The "self-referential" aspect comes from the AI seeing its own previous work in the files and git history.

**Each iteration:**
1. AI receives the SAME prompt.
2. Works on the task, modifying files.
3. Tries to exit.
4. Stop hook intercepts and feeds the same prompt again.
5. AI sees its previous work in the files.
6. Iteratively improves until completion.

## Available Commands

### /ralph-loop <PROMPT> [OPTIONS]

Start a Ralph loop in your current session.

**Usage:**
```
/ralph-loop "Refactor the cache layer" --max-iterations 20
/ralph-loop "Add tests" --completion-promise "TESTS COMPLETE"
```

**Options:**
- `--max-iterations <n>` - Max iterations before auto-stop.
- `--completion-promise <text>` - Promise phrase to signal completion.
- `--debug` - Enable debug logging (saved to `.gemini/ralph-debug.log`).

**How it works:**
1. Creates `.gemini/ralph-state.json` state file.
2. You work on the task.
3. When you try to exit, the stop hook intercepts.
4. Same prompt is fed back.
5. You see your previous work.
6. Continues until promise detected or max iterations reached.

### /cancel-ralph

Cancel an active Ralph loop (removes the loop state file).

## Key Concepts

### Completion Promises

To signal completion, you must output a `<promise>` tag:

```
<promise>TASK COMPLETE</promise>
```

The stop hook looks for this specific tag. Without it (or `--max-iterations`), Ralph runs infinitely.

## Prompt Writing Best Practices

### 1. Clear Completion Criteria

❌ Bad: "Build a todo API and make it good."

✅ Good:
```markdown
Build a REST API for todos.

When complete:
- All CRUD endpoints working
- Input validation in place
- Tests passing (coverage > 80%)
- README with API docs
- Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

### 2. Incremental Goals

❌ Bad: "Create a complete e-commerce platform."

✅ Good:
```markdown
Phase 1: User authentication (JWT, tests)
Phase 2: Product catalog (list/search, tests)
Phase 3: Shopping cart (add/remove, tests)

Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when all phases done.
```

### 3. Self-Correction

❌ Bad: "Write code for feature X."

✅ Good:
```markdown
Implement feature X following TDD:
1. Write failing tests
2. Implement feature
3. Run tests
4. If any fail, debug and fix
5. Refactor if needed
6. Repeat until all green
7. Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

### 4. Escape Hatches

Always use `--max-iterations` as a safety net to prevent infinite loops on impossible tasks:

```bash
# Recommended: Always set a reasonable iteration limit
/ralph-loop "Try to implement feature X" --max-iterations 20
```

**Note**: The `--completion-promise` uses exact string matching, so you cannot use it for multiple completion conditions (like "SUCCESS" vs "BLOCKED"). Always rely on `--max-iterations` as your primary safety mechanism.
