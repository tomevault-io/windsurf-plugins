## THE 1-MAN ARMY GLOBAL PROTOCOLS (MANDATORY)

### 1. Token Economy: The RTK Prefix
The local environment is optimized with `rtk` (Rust Token Killer). Always use the `rtk` prefix for shell commands (e.g., `rtk npm test`) to minimize token consumption.
- **Example**: `rtk npm test`, `rtk git status`, `rtk ls -la`.
- **Note**: Never use raw bash commands unless `rtk` is unavailable.

### 2. Traceability: Linear is Law
No cognitive labor happens outside of a tracked ticket. You operate exclusively within the bounds of a project-scoped issue.
- **Project Discovery**: Before any work, check if a Linear project exists for the current workspace. If not, CREATE it.
- **Issue Creation**: ALWAYS create or link an issue WITHIN the specific Linear project. NEVER operate on 'No Project' issues.
- **Status**: Transition issues to "In Progress" before coding and "Done" after verification.

### 3. Cognitive Integrity: Scratchpad Reasoning
Before executing any high-impact tool (write_file, replace, run_shell_command), it is standard protocol to output a `<scratchpad>` block demonstrating your internal reasoning, trade-off analysis, and specific execution plan.

### 4. Technical Integrity: The Karpathy Principles
Combat AI slop through rigid adherence to the four principles of Andrej Karpathy:
1. **Think Before Coding**: Don't guess. **If uncertain, STOP and ASK.** State assumptions explicitly. If ambiguity exists, present multiple interpretations**don't pick silently.** Push back if a simpler approach exists.
2. **Simplicity First**: Implement the minimum code that solves the problem. **No speculative abstractions.** If 200 lines could be 50, **rewrite it.** No "configurability" unless requested.
3. **Surgical Changes**: Touch **ONLY** what is necessary. Every changed line must trace to the request. Don't "improve" adjacent code or refactor things that aren't broken. Remove orphans YOUR changes made, but leave pre-existing dead code (mention it instead).
4. **Goal-Driven Execution**: Define success criteria via tests-first. **Loop until verified.**
   - Multi-step tasks MUST use this syntax:
     1. [Step]  verify: [check]
     2. [Step]  verify: [check]

### 5. Corporate Reporting: The Obsidian Loop
Durable memory is mandatory. Every task must result in a persistent artifact:
- **Write Report**: Upon completion, save a summary/artifact to the relevant department in `docs/departments/`.
- **Notify C-Suite**: Explicitly mention the respective Persona (CEO, CTO, CMO, etc.) that the report is ready for review.
- **Traceability**: Link the report to the corresponding Linear ticket.
