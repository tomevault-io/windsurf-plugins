## Goal

Our Main Files - Always Check these files before updating
[CustomInventoryPlugin.java](mdc:src/main/java/com/example/custominventoryplugin/CustomInventoryPlugin.java)
[InventoryListener.java](mdc:src/main/java/com/example/custominventoryplugin/listeners/InventoryListener.java)
[PlayerGearData.java](mdc:src/main/java/com/example/custominventoryplugin/data/PlayerGearData.java)
[GearInventory.java](mdc:src/main/java/com/example/custominventoryplugin/inventory/GearInventory.java)
[ConfigManager.java](mdc:src/main/java/com/example/custominventoryplugin/config/ConfigManager.java)

The main code of the project is 

- Create a Minecraft Paper 1.21 plugin addon for the Fabled plugin
- Plugin will open a custom 9-slot inventory GUI via a command
- GUI will sync with player's armor and allow custom ring item usage
- The main goal is adding custom 'ring slot' (this is open to anything, amulet, relic) that players can equip items in and the stats and attributes transfer to the player and specifically connects properly with fabled


## Done Criteria

- /gear opens the GUI successfully
- GUI mirrors armor slots and updates in real time
- Ring slot works and updates stats correctly via NBT
- Invalid items are rejected in ring slot

- Command `/gear` opens a custom inventory GUI
- GUI has 9 slots:
  - Slots 0–3: mirror player's equipped armor (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots)
  - Slot 4: custom ring item slot only accepts items with a ring identifier
  - Slots 5–8: reserved for future use or visual filler
- Changes made in the GUI are synced with player inventory and vice versa
- Ring slot reads NBT data from inserted item and updates stats using Fabled's methods
