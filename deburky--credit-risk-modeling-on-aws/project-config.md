## Makefile Quality and Validation Tools

### Syntax Validation with mbake

- After finalizing Makefile edits, validate syntax with `mbake`:
```bash
  # Validate Makefile using uvx (recommended)
  uvx mbake format Makefile
  uvx mbake validate Makefile
  
  # Or using pipx
  pipx run mbake format Makefile
  pipx run mbake validate Makefile
  
  # Validate all Makefiles in project
  uvx mbake format **/Makefile
  uvx mbake validate **/Makefile
```
- `mbake format` formats the Makefile according to the rules
- `mbake validate` catches syntax errors, invalid target names, and common mistakes
- Run before committing to ensure Makefile is valid
- Fix all validation errors - don't ignore warnings

### Makefile Best Practices

- Use tabs (not spaces) for recipe indentation - this is a hard requirement
- Declare `.PHONY` targets at the top for non-file targets
- Use meaningful target names that describe the action
- Add help target with `##` comments for documentation
- Use variables for repeated values (e.g., `PYTHON := python3`)
- Keep recipes concise and focused on a single task

### Target Documentation
```makefile
.PHONY: help
help: ## Show available targets
	@grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | \
		awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "  %-20s %s\n", $$1, $$2}'

.PHONY: test
test: ## Run tests
	pytest tests/

.PHONY: lint
lint: ## Run linters
	ruff check .
	mypy .
```

## Output Formatting

### Recommended Patterns

- Use plain text status indicators: "Success", "Error", "Running", "Complete"
- Use simple symbols: ✓ (checkmark), ✗ (cross), → (arrow)
- Colors are acceptable via ANSI codes for important messages
- Keep output concise and actionable

### Example Output Style
```makefile
.PHONY: build
build: ## Build the project
	@echo "→ Building project..."
	@uv build
	@echo "✓ Build complete"

.PHONY: clean
clean: ## Clean build artifacts
	@echo "→ Cleaning build artifacts..."
	@rm -rf dist/ build/
	@echo "✓ Clean complete"
```

### Prohibited Patterns

- Excessive decorative lines with repeated characters
- Unnecessary blank lines between status messages
- Over-use of emojis (✓ and ✗ are sufficient)
- Verbose multi-line explanations in output

## Validation Workflow

1. Edit Makefile
2. Run `uvx mbake validate Makefile` to check syntax
3. Test targets manually: `make <target>`
4. Commit only if validation passes and targets work

### Rationale

Clean, validated Makefiles that are easy to maintain and use across the team.
