## Markdown Formatting

When writing notes, use the following format:

> [!NOTE]  
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]  
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.

## Diagrams Over Lists

- Use Mermaid diagrams for workflows with >5 steps or complex architectures
- [GitHub Mermaid Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)

````mermaid
graph LR
    Train --> Package --> Upload --> Deploy --> Test
````

- Keep simple lists for 2-4 items only

## Mathematical Expressions

### Use LaTeX for Formulas

- Use inline math with `$...$` and display math with `$$...$$`
- GitHub natively renders LaTeX mathematical expressions
- See: [GitHub Math Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)

````markdown
# Inline math
The Gini coefficient is calculated as $G = 2 \cdot AUC - 1$

# Display math (centered block)
$$
\text{Gini} = 2 \int_0^1 (ROC(t) - t) \, dt
$$

# Multiple equations
$$
\begin{align}
\text{Precision} &= \frac{TP}{TP + FP} \\
\text{Recall} &= \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
\end{align}
$$
````

### Common Use Cases

**Model Metrics**
````markdown
$$
F_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
$$
````

**Loss Functions**
````markdown
$$
L(\theta) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \log(p_i) + (1-y_i) \log(1-p_i)]
$$
````

**Statistical Tests**
````markdown
The KS statistic is defined as $KS = \max_t |F_1(t) - F_0(t)|$
````

### When to Use Math

- Documenting model formulas and metrics
- Explaining statistical methods
- Loss functions and optimization
- Credit scoring formulas (e.g., odds ratio, log-odds)
- Keep simple ratios as text: "precision = TP / (TP + FP)" for casual references

### Lists and Line Breaks

- Always add a blank line before lists (ordered or unordered)
- Lists must be separated from preceding text by a blank line

```markdown
# Good: Blank line before list
Reference Documentation:

- [LocalStack Lambda ECR Tutorial](https://example.com)
- [Detailed Fix Documentation](path/to/doc.md)

# Bad: No blank line before list
Reference Documentation:
- [LocalStack Lambda ECR Tutorial](https://example.com)
- [Detailed Fix Documentation](path/to/doc.md)
```

### Other Formatting Rules

- Use `**bold**` for emphasis, not `__bold__`
- Use `*italic*` for emphasis, not `_italic_`
- Add blank line before and after code blocks
- Add blank line before and after headers (except at document start)
