# MUI Login Component Library

- Follow **Material-UI design patterns** and theming conventions
- Make components **highly configurable** through props
- Ensure **theme-agnostic** design - components should work with any MUI theme
- Include proper **TypeScript definitions** for all props and exports
- Use **peer dependencies** for React and MUI to avoid bundle duplication
- Follow **semantic versioning** for releases
