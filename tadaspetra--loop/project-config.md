# AGENTS.md

This file is the canonical contributor guide for this repository.

If another assistant-specific file exists, it should defer to this document for repo workflow, quality gates, and architecture constraints.

## Mission

Keep this Electron video app production-ready while preserving:

- clear module boundaries
- deterministic tests
- stable user-facing behavior
- release integrity

Do not optimize for "quickly making tests pass." Optimize for making the codebase more robust.

## Required Workflow

For any non-trivial change, follow this order:

1. Identify the affected feature and expected behavior.
2. Define or update acceptance criteria before implementation.
3. Add or update tests first for the intended behavior.
4. Implement the code change.
5. Run the full verification suite.
6. Fix code defects if tests fail. Do not weaken assertions unless the product requirement itself changed.

## Change Policy

- Prefer small, isolated changes over broad rewrites.
- Preserve behavior unless the task explicitly changes product behavior.
- Do not introduce duplicate business logic across renderer and main.
- Shared normalization/domain logic belongs in `src/shared/`.
- Main-process business logic belongs in `src/main/services/`, not in IPC registration or app bootstrap.
- Renderer feature logic belongs in `src/renderer/features/`, not inline in `src/index.html`.
- `src/preload.ts` should remain a narrow bridge and not gain business logic.

## Architecture Guardrails

Current intended structure:

- `src/main/`
  - Electron runtime bootstrapping, IPC registration, services, infra
- `src/shared/`
  - domain rules, normalization, data-shape helpers shared across layers
- `src/renderer/`
  - renderer entrypoint and feature utilities
- `tests/unit/`
  - pure logic and isolated helper tests
- `tests/integration/`
  - service/integration tests with controlled fakes
- `tests/e2e/`
  - Electron smoke and workflow checks

When adding new code:

- Put pure data logic in a testable module first.
- Keep side effects at the edges.
- Inject dependencies where practical for testability.
- Favor explicit validation and errors over silent fallback when data is invalid.

## Test-First Requirements

Before implementing behavior changes:

- Add unit tests for pure logic.
- Add integration tests for filesystem, IPC, or service coordination.
- Add or extend e2e coverage for critical user flows if the change affects runtime behavior.
- For every user-visible behavior change, add at least one proving test that would fail without the change.
- Treat "what behavior changed?" as a required design question before coding.

Minimum expectation by change type:

- Pure helper/domain change: unit tests
- Main-process service or IPC change: unit + integration tests
- Renderer feature change: utility tests and, if behaviorally important, e2e or smoke coverage
- Release/build/packaging change: verification via packaging smoke and relevant CI updates

## Coverage Policy

Do not chase 100% coverage as a vanity target. Protect confidence instead.

Coverage priorities by layer:

- `src/shared/**`
  - target very high coverage
  - new logic should normally ship with direct unit coverage
- pure modules in `src/main/services/**`
  - target high coverage
  - normalization, parsing, validation, section math, FPS selection, ffmpeg filter builders should be directly tested
- orchestration-heavy main-process code
  - combine unit coverage with integration coverage
  - do not rely on line coverage alone
- renderer runtime glue
  - prefer behavior tests and smoke/e2e coverage over brittle implementation-detail tests

Use this rule when changing code:

- if logic moved or behavior changed, coverage for that area should stay the same or improve
- if an agent adds a new branch/edge case, it should usually add a test for that branch
- do not lower confidence in a critical path while keeping the global coverage number flat

## Testing Rules

- Never "fix" a test by removing meaningful assertions just to get green CI.
- If a test reveals a bug, fix the underlying code.
- Prefer deterministic tests using mocks, fakes, fixtures, and temp directories.
- Avoid live external dependencies in tests.
- Keep tests readable and behavior-focused.

## Required Commands

Use pnpm only in this repo.

Primary commands:

- `pnpm run build:styles`
- `pnpm run lint`
- `pnpm run typecheck`
- `pnpm run test`
- `pnpm run test:e2e`
- `pnpm run package:smoke`
- `pnpm run check`

Before finishing a substantive change, run:

- `pnpm run check`

If `pnpm run check` is too slow during iteration, run a narrower loop while developing, but do not mark work complete until the full check passes.

## Build And Runtime Notes

- Start the app with `pnpm dev` or `pnpm start`, not raw `electron .`
  - this ensures renderer styles are rebuilt first
- Tailwind output is generated into `src/renderer/styles/main.css`
- Do not reintroduce Tailwind CDN loading
- Keep the stricter CSP in `src/index.html`

## Environment Rules

- Required env vars must be documented in `.env.example`
- Validate required env at runtime before using it
- Do not hardcode secrets
- Do not commit `.env`

## Release Integrity

Any change that affects build, packaging, or runtime startup must keep these green:
