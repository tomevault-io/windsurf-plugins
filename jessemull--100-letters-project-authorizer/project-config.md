# Architecture

Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

- Keep auth logic in `src/index.ts` (or clearly named modules under `src/` if split later).
- Do not expand this Lambda into a general API.
- Preserve Webpack → zip → S3 → CloudFormation deploy topology unless migrating with human approval.
- Fail closed on auth errors (`Unauthorized`).
