## Setup Commands

### Minimal Setup (Fastest)
```bash
# No special setup required - Gradle wrapper handles everything
# Just ensure Java is available (JDK 21+ recommended)
```

### Verification Build
```bash
# Full clean build to verify all changes work correctly
./gradlew clean build
```

## Repository Context

### Project Overview
**Mosaic** is a Kotlin framework for **composable backend orchestration** that enables "response-first" thinking rather than "database-first" thinking. It provides intelligent caching, concurrent safety, and type-safe tile composition for building high-performance data access layers.

### Key Concepts for AI Understanding

#### Core Architecture
- **Tiles**: The fundamental building blocks that cache and retrieve data
  - `Tile<T>`: Created with `singleTile { }` DSL for single values
  - `MultiTile<K, V>`: Created with `multiTile { }`, `perKeyTile { }`, or `chunkedMultiTile { }` DSL for key-value mappings
- **Canvas**: Dependency injection system using hierarchical scoping
- **Mosaic**: Per-request execution context that manages tile caching and concurrency

#### Response-First Philosophy
Instead of thinking "what database queries do I need?", developers think "what response do I want to build?" and compose tiles to create that response.

#### Intelligent Caching
- Tiles automatically cache results and share concurrent requests
- Dependencies are resolved automatically and cached transitively
- No manual cache management required

### Project Structure

```
Mosaic/
├── mosaic-core/          # Core framework (Tile, MultiTile, Mosaic, Canvas)
├── mosaic-test/          # Testing framework (TestMosaic, TestMosaicBuilder, etc.)
├── examples/             # Example implementations
├── buildSrc/             # Gradle convention plugins
└── build.gradle.kts      # Root build configuration
```

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin 2.2.0
- **Build System**: Gradle with Kotlin DSL
- **Concurrency**: Kotlin Coroutines with `Deferred` for caching
- **Testing**: Kotlin Test with Kover for coverage (Micronaut example uses JUnit 5)
- **Code Quality**: ktlint (formatting), detekt (static analysis)

### Development Patterns

#### Tile Implementation Pattern
```kotlin
val UserTile = singleTile {
    val userId = source<String>("userId")
    userService.getUser(userId)
}
```

#### Composition Pattern
```kotlin
val UserProfileTile = singleTile {
    val user = compose(UserTile)
    val preferences = compose(PreferencesTile)
    UserProfile(user, preferences)
}
```

#### MultiTile Patterns
```kotlin
// Batch API call
val ProductsByIdTile = multiTile { productIds ->
    productService.getProducts(productIds.toList())
}

// Per-key fetching
val UserByIdTile = perKeyTile { userId ->
    userService.getUser(userId)
}

// Chunked requests
val InventoryBySkuTile = chunkedMultiTile(50) { skus ->
    inventoryService.getBatch(skus)
}
```

## AI Agent Guidelines

### Code Style & Standards
- Follow Kotlin conventions enforced by ktlint
- Use meaningful tile names ending with "Tile"
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use suspend functions for async operations
- Follow the existing package structure (`org.buildmosaic.*`)

### Testing Best Practices
- Use the `mosaic-test` framework for testing tiles
- Isolate tiles from their dependent tiles by using `TestMosaicBuilder`
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Use `TestMosaicBuilder` helpers (`withMockTile`, `withFailedTile`, etc.) for different test scenarios
- Use `runTest` from kotlinx-coroutines-test for coroutine testing
- Pass `TestScope` to `TestMosaicBuilder` constructor
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage for core and test modules (enforced by Kover)

### Common Operations

#### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
./gradlew test

# Specific module
./gradlew :mosaic-core:test

# With coverage
./gradlew koverHtmlReport
```

#### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# All quality checks
./gradlew check

# Style checking
./gradlew ktlintCheck

# Static analysis
./gradlew detekt

# Auto-fix formatting
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

### Module-Specific Notes

#### mosaic-core
- Contains the main framework classes: Mosaic, Canvas, Tile DSL functions
- Dependency injection via Canvas with hierarchical scoping
- Automatic caching and concurrency management
- Focus on performance and thread safety
- Minimal external dependencies

#### mosaic-test
- Comprehensive testing utilities
- Mock tile implementations with configurable behaviors
- Test assertions specific to tile testing
- Integration with kotlinx-coroutines-test

#### examples/
- Demonstrates real-world usage patterns
- Spring Boot, Ktor, and Micronaut integration examples available
- Tile library for reuse between different examples
- Good reference for best practices
- Is a separate gradle project. Gradle commands on examples must be run using `-p examples` flag

### Performance Considerations
- Tiles should be lightweight and focused
- Use `MultiTile` for batch operations when possible
- Avoid blocking operations in tile DSL blocks
- Use `composeAsync()` for parallel execution of multiple tiles
- Dependencies are injected via Canvas, not passed through request context
- Prefer `composeAsync().await()` pattern for parallel composition

### Error Handling
- Tiles should let exceptions bubble up naturally
