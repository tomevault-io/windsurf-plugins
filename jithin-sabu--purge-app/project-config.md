# Commit Conventions

Follow [awesome-commit-conventions](https://github.com/khasky/awesome-commit-conventions) for all commit messages.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<body: why the change, what was wrong>

<footer: Closes #123, BREAKING CHANGE:, Co-authored-by:>
```

Only the first line is required. Body and footer are optional.

## Header rules

- Imperative mood: `add`, `fix`, `remove` — not `added`, `adds`, `fixing`
- ≤ ~50 characters, lowercase after `:`, no trailing period
- Wrap body lines at 72 characters

## Types

| Type | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New user-facing feature (minor bump) |
| `fix` | Bug fix (patch bump) |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code change, no behavior change |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Tests |
| `build` | Xcode project, dependencies, release tooling |
| `ci` | CI pipelines |
| `chore` | Housekeeping (version bumps, config) — not user-facing |
| `style` | Formatting only |
| `revert` | Reverts a prior commit |

Breaking changes: `feat(api)!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer → major bump.

## Scopes

Use `kebab-case`, stay consistent, match project areas. Examples for this repo:

`menu-bar`, `settings`, `scheduler`, `update-checker`, `about`, `purge-store`, `release`

Global changes may omit scope: `build:`, `ci:`, `chore(release):`.

## Examples

```
feat(scheduler): add weekly cleaning preference
fix(menu-bar): keep popover open during scan
refactor(purge-store): simplify cache invalidation
chore(release): bump version to 1.2.4
docs: update security disclosure process
```

Header = **what**. Body = **why**. Use `Closes #123` in footer when applicable.
