# AGENTS.md

`chunk` is a Go CLI (built with cobra) that mines PR review comments from GitHub, analyzes them with Claude, and outputs a markdown prompt file tuned to a team's review patterns. Generated context goes in `.chunk/context/` for AI coding agents to pick up automatically.

## Common Commands

```bash
task build              # Build binary → dist/chunk
task test               # Run all tests
task acceptance-test    # Run acceptance tests
task lint               # Run linters
task fmt                # Format code
```

## Documentation Map

Read these when working in the relevant area:

- **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — module layering, dependency rules, data flow, environment variables
- **[docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md)** — complete command tree, flag conventions, behavior decisions
- **[docs/HOOKS.md](docs/HOOKS.md)** — pre-commit hooks: runs fmt, lint, test before commits via `.claude/settings.json`

## Key Architectural Constraints

- Dependencies flow strictly downward: `cmd/ → internal/`
- `cmd/` contains cobra command definitions — thin wrappers that delegate to `internal/`
- Leaf packages must not import from `cmd/`

## Code Conventions

- **Early returns**: Reduce nesting depth
- **Error handling**: Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`
- **Naming**: Follow Go conventions — short, unexported by default, no stuttering (e.g. `pipeline.ID` not `pipeline.PipelineID`)

## Testing Rules

- **Integration over mocks**: Critical workflows use real git operations in temp directories
- **No Claude API mocking**: Tests requiring `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` skip gracefully if missing
- **Fakes over mocks**: Use fake HTTP servers instead of mocking libraries
- **Test isolation**: Each test creates its own temp directory and cleans up
- **Race detector**: Always run tests with `-race`
- Acceptance tests live in `acceptance/`
