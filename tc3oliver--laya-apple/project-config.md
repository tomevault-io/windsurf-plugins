# AGENTS.md

These are the rules for coding agents that work on laya-apple. This file is the single
source of truth for agents; `CLAUDE.md` only imports it. Human contributors should read
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), which has the full setup, the test tiers and the
release policy. These rules summarise it and do not replace it.

## Scope

laya-apple is one repository. It covers:
- **Fast Laya runtime** (product direction): loading, the MLX GPU and Core ML / ANE
  backends, parity and provenance.
- **GPU + ANE serving** (product direction): routing, heterogeneous serving and
  benchmarking.
  - This includes `laya-apple serve`: a local, loopback-only HTTP decision backend with a
    Jev-compatible API. Existing clients, such as Claude Code plugins, call it without
    code changes.
  - Serving answers the decisions a client sends. It does not decide what an agent
    offloads, so it does not resume the paused research below.
- **Agent offloading** (research, **paused**): local Laya decisions inside coding agents
  (OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, Pi).
  - The EXP-001 and EXP-002 quick probes found no measurable upside, so no further
    experiments are added (`research/agent-decision-offloading/`).
  - Resume only if new evidence shows a workload with measurable offloading value, such
    as substantial redundant tool-output context or a meaningful fraction of
    fixed-action post-tool LLM turns.
  - Integrations, adapters, hooks, installers and CLI integration belong here when that
    work is promoted.

Rules:
- **Research vs production.** Research lives in `research/<track>/`. The `laya_apple`
  package never imports it, and it never ships.
  - A result is promoted to production only after its experiment passes its recorded
    criteria.
  - The promoted code is rebuilt with tests in its own pull request, for example under
    `integrations/<agent>/`.
- **Agent integrations** use the agent's official plugin, hook or extension API.
  - Never fork, vendor, patch or rewrite a third-party agent framework.
  - Record the upstream version you verified against.
- **Client compatibility** (Jev-compatible clients and plugins) is verified against the
  client's released version, without modifying the client. Record the versions tested.

## Git workflow

- **`main` is stable and always releasable.** Never commit or push to it directly.
- **Check the branch before changing anything:** `git status --short --branch`. If it
  shows `main`, create a branch first. Use one of these prefixes:
  - `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`;
  - `bench/`, `research/`, `release/`.
- **Every change goes through a pull request.** Merge only after CI passes. Prefer
  squash merge.
- **Title pull requests as `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>`.** The title becomes
  the squash commit subject on `main`.
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`,
    `bench`.
  - Scope: optional, short and lowercase, for example `runtime`, `routing`,
    `scheduler`, `mlx`, `ane`, `parity`, `artifacts`, `benchmarks`, `hardware`,
    `community`, `readme`, `media`, `offloading` or `integrations`.
  - Summary: concise and imperative, lowercase after the colon, no trailing period.
  - Examples:
    - `feat(routing): add calibrated profile selection`
    - `fix(ane): reject artifacts that fail placement validation`
    - `perf(scheduler): reduce short-request queueing`
    - `docs(community): clarify hardware benchmark submissions`
    - `bench(hardware): add M3 Max benchmark result`
  - One pull request is still one logical change. The convention applies from now on;
    merged pull requests are not renamed, and CI does not check titles.
- **Protect published history:**
  - never force-push `main`;
  - never rewrite `main`'s published history;
  - never move, delete or recreate a published tag.
- **Never commit generated or local-only files:**
  - generated Core ML models (`*.mlpackage`, `*.mlmodelc`);
  - model weights;
  - credentials;
  - machine-specific absolute paths.

## Validation

Run what the change needs. The table in `CONTRIBUTING.md` ("Which tests a PR needs")
gives the exact commands.

| Change | Minimum validation |
|---|---|
| Any change | `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format --check laya_apple scripts tests`, and the fast suite: `uv run pytest -q -m "not integration and not parity and not ane and not stress"` |
| Docs only | Fast suite and CI. For packaging or README changes, also run `uv build` and `uvx twine check --strict dist/*` |
| Runtime, routing, scheduler, backend, model or ANE code | The relevant `integration`, `parity` and `ane` tests on Apple silicon, plus the `scripts/derive_*.py --check`, `scripts/make_goldens.py --check` and `scripts/generate_readme_svgs.py --check` data checks |
| Performance-sensitive change | Re-run the affected benchmark and compare it with the recorded baseline in `benchmarks/` (`scripts/compare_bench.py`). Report the comparison in the PR |

- **Never loosen a gate to make CI or a benchmark pass.** This covers:
  - the parity tolerances in `laya_apple/parity/__init__.py`;
  - routing thresholds;
  - release-gate criteria.

  A tolerance or threshold change needs its own PR with measurements behind it.
