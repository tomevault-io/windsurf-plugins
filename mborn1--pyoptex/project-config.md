# Workflow

## Verification (run before committing)

```bash
make lint       # ruff
make format     # ruff format
make typecheck  # mypy
make test       # pytest
make all        # lint + typecheck + test
```

## Rules of engagement

- Run the verification checklist after every substantive change.
- Do not change `setup.py` extension definitions without ensuring the CI wheel build still works (`python-publish.yml`, cibuildwheel).
- Modify `.pyx` files only if you understand Cython (see `cython.mdc`).
- Version lives only in `src/pyoptex/__init__.py`.
- Add tests in `tests/` for new public API; run `venv/bin/python examples/run_all.py` to validate examples.
- Never commit `.env`, tokens, or credentials.
