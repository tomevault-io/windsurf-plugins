# Handoff Entry: new chat startup behavior

When a handoff file is provided or referenced:

## Startup rule
- Read `@.cursor/handoff/current.md`
- Read `@.cursor/current_state.md`
- Read the referenced task + linked RFC/ADR contracts.
- Stay scoped: only consult paths inside the task's **Touched paths** allowlist.

## Plan mode decision
- **New task (first time in this task)**: Request Plan Mode and produce a plan with:
  - Acceptance criteria coverage (one-by-one)
  - Proof strategy (tests/markers) for the specified desired behavior
  - Security invariants and negative tests (`test_reject_*`) when applicable
  - Doc/header/ADR sync items
- **Task continuation (handoff explicitly says we're continuing)**: Skip Plan Mode and proceed with focused debugging/implementation.

## Context budget discipline
- Prefer strict manual context (1–3 relevant files) for continuation/debugging.
- Avoid auto-including or expanding large diffs unless explicitly requested.
