# Design & Animation Rules

## Core Philosophy

Taste is trained, not innate. Reverse engineer animations. Inspect interactions. Unseen details compound — a thousand barely audible voices all singing in tune. Beauty is leverage.

## Animation Frequency Framework

| Frequency | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| 100+ times/day (keyboard shortcuts, command palette) | No animation. Ever. |
| Tens of times/day (hover effects, list navigation) | Remove or drastically reduce |
| Occasional (modals, drawers, toasts) | Standard animation |
| Rare/first-time (onboarding, celebrations) | Can add delight |

Never animate keyboard-initiated actions.

## Easing Decision Flowchart

```
Entering or exiting viewport? → ease-out
Moving/morphing on screen? → ease-in-out
Hover/color change? → ease
Constant motion (marquee, progress)? → linear
Default → ease-out
```

Use custom curves — built-in CSS easings lack punch:

```css
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);
--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);
```

Never use `ease-in` for UI animations. It starts slow, making the interface feel sluggish.

## Duration Guidelines

| Element Type | Duration |
|-------------|----------|
| Button press feedback | 100-160ms |
| Tooltips, small popovers | 125-200ms |
| Dropdowns, selects | 150-250ms |
| Modals, drawers | 200-500ms |
| Marketing/explanatory | Can be longer |

- UI animations stay under 300ms
- Larger elements animate slower than smaller ones
- Exit animations ~20% faster than entrance
- Match duration to distance

## Spring Animations

Springs feel more natural — they simulate real physics with no fixed duration.

When to use: drag interactions with momentum, elements that feel "alive", gestures that can be interrupted, decorative mouse-tracking.

Apple's approach (recommended): `{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }`. Keep bounce subtle (0.1-0.3). Avoid bounce in most UI contexts. Springs maintain velocity when interrupted — CSS animations restart from zero.

## clip-path Techniques

`clip-path: inset(top right bottom left)` — one of the most powerful animation tools. Use for: hold-to-delete overlays, tab color transitions (duplicate + clip), image reveals on scroll, comparison sliders.

## Gesture Rules

- Momentum-based dismissal: calculate velocity (`distance / time`). If > 0.11, dismiss.
- Damping at boundaries: the more they drag past the edge, the less it moves.
- Pointer capture once dragging starts (`setPointerCapture`).
- Multi-touch protection: ignore additional touch points after initial drag.
- Friction instead of hard stops.

## Performance

- Only animate `transform` and `opacity` (GPU-composited).
- Motion `x`/`y`/`scale` are NOT hardware-accelerated. Use `transform: "translateX(100px)"` for GPU.
- CSS animations run off main thread. Use CSS for predetermined, JS for dynamic.
- Don't animate CSS variables on parents — recalculates all children.
- WAAPI (`element.animate()`) gives JS control with CSS performance.

## Accessibility

- `prefers-reduced-motion`: keep opacity/color, remove movement.
- Gate hover behind `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`.
- 44px minimum hit area on touch targets.

## Component Rules

1. **Scale buttons on press**: `transform: scale(0.97)` on `:active`, 160ms ease-out.
2. **Never animate from scale(0)**: Start from `scale(0.95)`, not `scale(0)`.
3. **Origin-aware popovers**: `transform-origin` to trigger location. Exception: modals stay centered.
4. **Skip tooltip delay on subsequent hovers**: `[data-instant] { transition-duration: 0ms; }`.
5. **CSS transitions over keyframes**: Transitions are interruptible; keyframes restart from zero.
6. **Blur to mask crossfades**: `filter: blur(2px)` during transition. Under 20px.
7. **Asymmetric enter/exit**: Enter chunked and staggered (60-100ms). Exits have reduced travel.
8. **Stagger animations**: 30-80ms between items. Never block interaction during stagger.
9. **Use `@starting-style`** for entry animations (replaces `useEffect` + `setMounted(true)`).

## Review Checklist

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `transition: all` | Specify exact properties |
| `scale(0)` entry | `scale(0.95)` with `opacity: 0` |
| `ease-in` on UI element | `ease-out` or custom curve |
| `transform-origin: center` on popover | Trigger location (modals exempt) |
| Animation on keyboard action | Remove entirely |
| Duration > 300ms on UI element | 150-250ms |
| Hover without media query | `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` |
| Keyframes on rapid triggers | CSS transitions |
| Motion `x`/`y` under load | `transform: "translateX()"` |
| Same enter/exit speed | Exit ~20% faster |
| Everything appears at once | Stagger 30-80ms |

## The Sonner Principles

From building Sonner (13M+ weekly npm downloads):

1. No hooks, no context, no setup. Insert once, call from anywhere.
2. Good defaults > options. Ship beautiful out of the box.
