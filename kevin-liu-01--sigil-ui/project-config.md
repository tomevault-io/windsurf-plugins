# React Conventions

> Imported from Kevin's wiki (`wiki/style/react.md`).
> Cross-reference: `sigil-conventions.mdc` (component rules), `sigil-design-system.mdc` (token consumption), `css-ui-enforcement.mdc` (styling stack).

## Styling

All UI via `className={cn(...)}` and Tailwind utilities. No CSS modules or co-located `.css` for normal components. Raw CSS belongs almost only in `globals.css`. Do not combine `style={{ ... }}` with Tailwind on the same node. See `css-ui-enforcement.mdc`.

## Rules of Hooks

Hooks are identified by position in an array. Call order must be identical on every render.

- Hooks at the top level of a component or custom hook only.
- Before any conditional logic.
- No hooks inside conditions, loops, event handlers, callbacks passed to `useMemo`/`useReducer`/`useEffect`, or after early returns.
- Most common violation: early return before hooks. Move hooks above the conditional.

## Custom Hooks

Name the hook after what it returns, not what it does internally. `useOrgData` > `useFetchAndCacheOrgDataWithLoading`.

## Exhaustive Dependencies

`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` dependency arrays must include every referenced value. Missing dependencies cause stale closures. If adding a dependency causes an infinite loop, restructure (extract to ref, memoize the dependency, move to event handler) — do not suppress the warning.

## setState in Effects

The React compiler flags synchronous `setState` inside effect bodies. Canonical alternative: `useSyncExternalStore`. Migrate incrementally.

## Linting Rules (Ultracite/oxlint)

| Rule | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` | error | Non-negotiable, never disable |
| `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` | warn | Fix stale closures, do not suppress |
| `react/self-closing-comp` | error | `<Foo />` not `<Foo></Foo>` |
| `react/jsx-curly-brace-presence` | error | No `{"text"}` when `text` suffices |

## Architecture-Policy Rules

Custom ESLint rules for repo-specific patterns that oxlint cannot express:

| Rule | What it catches |
|------|-----------------|
| `no-derived-state-in-effect` | `useEffect` computing derived state — use `useMemo` or inline render logic |
| `no-fetch-in-effect` | `fetch()`/`axios.*()` inside `useEffect` — use TanStack Query or server-side |
| `no-query-client-in-component` | `new QueryClient()` in component body — creates a new client per render |
| `no-void-query-fn` | `queryFn` returning void — calling `setState` instead of returning data |
| `no-unstable-query-result-deps` | Destructured query results in dep arrays — new refs every render |
| `query-key-deps` | `queryKey` missing variables used by `queryFn` — stale cache hits |

## Vercel React Best Practices (69 Rules Reference)

Prioritized performance rules from Vercel. Auto-loads via `vercel-react-best-practices` skill.

| Priority | Category | Impact | Key Rules |
|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Eliminating Waterfalls | CRITICAL | `Promise.all()` for independent ops, defer await into branches, Suspense boundaries |
| 2 | Bundle Size | CRITICAL | Direct imports (avoid barrel files), `next/dynamic` for heavy components, defer analytics |
| 3 | Server-Side | HIGH | `React.cache()` dedup, LRU cross-request cache, minimize data to client, `after()` for non-blocking |
| 4 | Client Data Fetching | MEDIUM-HIGH | SWR for dedup, deduplicate event listeners, passive scroll listeners |
| 5 | Re-render | MEDIUM | Extract expensive work into memoized components, derive state during render, functional setState, `startTransition` |
| 6 | Rendering | MEDIUM | `content-visibility` for long lists, hoist static JSX, Activity component for show/hide |
| 7 | JS Performance | LOW-MEDIUM | Map for repeated lookups, combine filter/map, Set for O(1) lookups |
| 8 | Advanced | LOW | Store event handlers in refs, initialize once per app load |

## RSC Safety

- Default to Server Components. Global state only in Client Components.
- Interactive UI (Motion, magnetic hover, perpetual animations) → isolated `"use client"` leaf components.
- Server Components render static layouts only.

## React Hygiene

Run `npx react-doctor@latest` after major agent-authored UI refactors or before release branches. Complements Ultracite/oxlint with React-specific diagnostics.
