# Design tokens - `src/styles/`

Rules for **authoring the stylesheets**. How to _consume_ tokens from a component
lives in `src/CLAUDE.md`, which loads for all frontend work. This file loads only when
you are in here.

## What each file owns

| File             | Owns                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `global.css`     | Every value: palette, brand pair, state colors, surfaces, scales, glass tiers, gradients                                   |
| `tailwind.css`   | Nothing of its own - the entry point, the font imports, and a `@theme` block aliasing `global.css` into Tailwind utilities |
| `animations.css` | Keyframes and the stagger utility                                                                                          |

`tailwind.css` is the single CSS entry point, imported in `main.tsx`. Keep the section
banner comments in `global.css` and add to the right section rather than appending to
the end.

The theme is shared with the [LTK Wiki](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/wiki) and the
LoL Meta Wiki. Their `custom.css` is what to diff against when the brand moves.

## Comments name their tokens and stop

A comment on a token group says _what the group is_, in one line:

```css
/* The logo colors. */
/* State colors, for components that derive their look from state. */
/* Colors for mod category pills. */
```

That is the whole budget. **Never write, in CSS:**

- **the values** - they are on the very next line
- **which components or pages consume a token** - that belongs in `src/CLAUDE.md`, and the
  list goes stale the moment a component changes
- **contrast measurements, or the reasoning behind a chosen value** - stale on the next tweak
- **what a token is _not_**, or how another project in the ecosystem does it differently

A comment earns more than one line only for a mechanical fact a reader cannot recover
from the code: declaration order a minifier would break, or which of two competing
blocks wins. `global.css` has exactly two of those. Match that bar.

If a rule feels worth writing next to a token, it belongs in `src/CLAUDE.md` instead.

## Adding a token

Numbered scales are the convention:

| Category   | Pattern            | Example                            |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Spacing    | `--space-{NNN}`    | `--space-004` → 18px (NNN × 4.5px) |
| Radius     | `--radius-{NNN}`   | `--radius-003` → 9px               |
| Icon sizes | `--icon-{NNN}`     | `--icon-003` → 12px                |
| Shadows    | `--shadow-{name}`  | `--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-glass`    |
| Z-index    | `--z-{name}`       | `--z-modal`, `--z-toast`           |
| Duration   | `--duration-{NNN}` | `--duration-004` → 200ms           |
| Easing     | `--ease-{name}`    | `--ease-spring`                    |

A new token is defined in `global.css` and aliased in the `@theme` block, or Tailwind
cannot see it. Color tokens carrying an LTK value are `--ltk-*`, and the app's own scales
are unprefixed (`--surface-*`, `--accent-*`).

**No `@apply`.** Reference the custom properties directly:
`background-color: var(--surface-900)`.

## Theme mechanics

Dark is the bare `:root`. Light overrides land in a `[data-theme="light"]` block, set by
`useTheme`. A color that flips is defined once and aliased - never as a pair of literals
in two places. Rung numbers encode **role, not luminance**, so both scales invert
wholesale between the themes.

Elevation is dark-first: `--shadow-*` carries depths tuned for the dark theme and the
light block softens them, because those depths read as smudges on a near-white surface.

Zoom is `--zoom-scale` on `<html>` and reaches the interface three ways. `--space-*` and
`--icon-*` carry the scale in their own `calc()`, because they are authored in px. Type
rides the root font size, which is what every `rem` in the app resolves against. Nothing
else moves - not `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`, `--z-*`, or colors.

A length authored in px is therefore a length that will not zoom. That is right for a
radius and wrong for anything sized against text, so **write type in `rem`**, never
`text-[13px]`. The rows a virtualizer measures itself are the one place px is
unavoidable, and those go through `useZoomedPx`.

`[data-corners]` is the one exception, and it is the only thing allowed to move
`--radius-*`. It is a setting of its own rather than a side effect of density, and it
leaves `--radius-006` alone because a pill is geometry.

## Surfaces are one hue with fixed curves

`--surface-{50..950}` is `oklch()` over a per-rung lightness and chroma, sharing a single
`--surface-hue` that `useTheme` sets from the accent. Both themes spell out their own
curves and read the same hue, so a rung keeps its contrast whatever the accent is.

Every chroma is written `calc(<authored> * var(--surface-tint))`, the scale the Appearance
panel's Surface tint slider sets, so one control moves the whole ramp between the authored
tint and a plain grey. Lightness never takes the scale - contrast has to hold at every
