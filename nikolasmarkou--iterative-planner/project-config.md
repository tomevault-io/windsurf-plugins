Guidance for working with the Iterative Planner codebase.

## Project Purpose

Claude Code skill — state-machine driven iterative planning and execution. Cycle: Explore → Plan → Execute → Reflect → Pivot. Filesystem (`plans/plan_YYYY-MM-DD_XXXXXXXX/`) as persistent memory.

Use cases: multi-file tasks, migrations, refactoring, failed tasks, debugging, anything 3+ files or 2+ systems.

## Key Commands

### Bootstrap

Manage plan directories from a project root:

```bash
node <skill-path>/scripts/bootstrap.mjs "goal"              # Create new plan (backward-compatible)
node <skill-path>/scripts/bootstrap.mjs new "goal"           # Create new plan
node <skill-path>/scripts/bootstrap.mjs new --force "goal"   # Close active plan, create new one
node <skill-path>/scripts/bootstrap.mjs resume               # Output current plan state for re-entry
node <skill-path>/scripts/bootstrap.mjs status               # One-line state summary
node <skill-path>/scripts/bootstrap.mjs close                # Close active plan (preserves directory)
node <skill-path>/scripts/bootstrap.mjs list                 # Show all plan directories
```

`new` creates plan directory with all files + writes `plans/.current_plan` pointer. Creates `plans/FINDINGS.md`, `plans/DECISIONS.md`, `plans/LESSONS.md`, and `plans/INDEX.md` if they don't exist. Idempotent-safe: refuses if active plan exists.

### Activation Triggers

Complex task, or: "plan this", "figure out", "help me think through", "I've been struggling with", "debug this complex issue".

## Protocol Reference

Complete spec in **src/SKILL.md**. Key sections:

- **State Machine & Transitions**: src/SKILL.md "State Machine" and "Transition Rules" sections
- **Mandatory Re-reads**: src/SKILL.md "Mandatory Re-reads" section
- **Autonomy Leash**: src/SKILL.md "Autonomy Leash" section
- **Complexity Control**: src/SKILL.md "Complexity Control" section + `src/references/complexity-control.md` (6 Simplification Checks including essential vs accidental complexity)
- **Code Hygiene**: src/SKILL.md "Code Hygiene" section + `src/references/code-hygiene.md`
- **Decision Anchoring**: src/SKILL.md "Decision Anchoring" section + `src/references/decision-anchoring.md`
- **Planning Rigor**: src/SKILL.md PLAN/EXPLORE/REFLECT/PIVOT sections + `src/references/planning-rigor.md` (assumptions, pre-mortem, falsification signals, exploration confidence, prediction accuracy, ghost constraints, decomposition)
- **Git Integration**: src/SKILL.md "Git Integration" section
- **Sub-Agent Architecture**: src/SKILL.md "Sub-Agent Architecture" section (agent definitions, file ownership, dispatch rules)

Do not duplicate protocol content here. Read src/SKILL.md directly.

## Working with This Codebase

### File Modification Guidelines

- **src/SKILL.md** — core protocol. Changes affect all planning behavior.
- **src/agents/** — sub-agent definitions. Each file uses YAML frontmatter (name, description, tools, model) + Markdown system prompt. Installed to `~/.claude/agents/`.
- **src/references/** — supplementary knowledge, read on-demand. Add new files for expanded guidance.
- **src/scripts/bootstrap.mjs** — requires Node.js 18+. Idempotent-safe (refuses if active plan exists).
- **VERSION** — single source of truth. `Makefile` + `build.ps1` read from it. Bump only `VERSION` + `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep state machine diagram, transition rules, file lifecycle matrix, and file format references in sync across src/SKILL.md and src/references/.

### Tech Stack

- Node.js/ESM (for bootstrap script)
- Markdown documentation
- PowerShell/Make for build scripts

### Build Commands

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\build.ps1 build            # Build skill package structure
.\build.ps1 build-combined   # Build single-file skill with inlined references
.\build.ps1 package          # Create zip package
.\build.ps1 package-combined # Create single-file skill in dist/
.\build.ps1 package-tar      # Create tarball package
.\build.ps1 validate         # Validate skill structure
.\build.ps1 lint             # Check script syntax
.\build.ps1 test             # Run tests (lint + round-trip)
.\build.ps1 clean            # Remove build artifacts
.\build.ps1 list             # Show package contents
.\build.ps1 help             # Show available commands

# Unix/Linux/macOS
make build                   # Build skill package structure
make build-combined          # Build single-file skill with inlined references
make package                 # Create zip package (default)
make package-combined        # Create single-file skill package
make package-tar             # Create tarball package
make validate                # Validate skill structure
make lint                    # Check script syntax
make test                    # Run tests (lint + round-trip)
make clean                   # Remove build artifacts
make list                    # Show package contents
make help                    # Show available targets
```

### Reference File Pattern

1. Clear section headers
2. Tables for quick reference
3. Code snippets where applicable
4. Cross-references to other reference files

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] `.\build.ps1 validate` passes (or `make validate`)
- [ ] src/SKILL.md has `name:` and `description:` in YAML frontmatter
- [ ] All cross-references in src/SKILL.md point to existing files in `src/references/`
- [ ] State machine diagram matches transition rules table
- [ ] File Lifecycle Matrix matches state machine states and plan directory file list
- [ ] `src/scripts/bootstrap.mjs` creates all files referenced in `src/references/file-formats.md` (including `verification.md`)
- [ ] Plan directory structure in src/SKILL.md matches bootstrap.mjs output (including `verification.md`)
- [ ] `src/scripts/bootstrap.mjs` creates and references `FINDINGS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `LESSONS.md` consolidated files
- [ ] Consolidated files contain merged content after `close`
- [ ] `plans/LESSONS.md` referenced in SKILL.md (EXPLORE, PLAN gate check, PIVOT, CLOSE, Recovery)
- [ ] `plans/INDEX.md` created by bootstrap and updated on close
- [ ] `lessons_snapshot.md` created in plan directory on close
- [ ] `src/scripts/validate-plan.mjs` passes syntax check
- [ ] All agent definitions in `src/agents/` have `name:`, `description:`, and `tools:` in YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Agent definitions in src/SKILL.md "Sub-Agent Architecture" section match files in `src/agents/`
- [ ] File Ownership Model table in src/SKILL.md matches agent tool permissions

## Updating Local Skill

When asked to "update local skill", copy **everything** from the repo to `~/.claude/skills/iterative-planner/` — no exceptions, no partial copies:

```bash
# Full sync — mirrors repo structure exactly
cp src/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/iterative-planner/SKILL.md
cp src/scripts/*.mjs ~/.claude/skills/iterative-planner/scripts/
cp src/references/*.md ~/.claude/skills/iterative-planner/references/
cp README.md LICENSE CHANGELOG.md ~/.claude/skills/iterative-planner/

# Install agent definitions (optional — skill works without them)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp src/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

Always verify with `diff -rq` after copying. Every file, every time.
