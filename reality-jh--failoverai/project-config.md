# FailoverAI contributor instructions

- Keep this repository independent. Do not copy credentials, data, branding, prompts, domains, or configuration from reference projects.
- PostgreSQL is authoritative for jobs, idempotency, leases, attempts, events, and final results.
- Fake providers are the only providers in the reference implementation.
- Prefer the smallest implementation that preserves safety, fencing, and observability.
- Run backend tests, frontend typecheck/build, Compose health checks, CodeGraph sync, and release scans before claiming completion.
- Never log prompts, raw idempotency keys, secrets, or provider payloads.
