## Working principles

- **Think before coding.** State assumptions explicitly. If a request has multiple reasonable
  interpretations, surface them and ask — don't silently pick one. Push back when something
  looks wrong instead of running with it.
- **Define the scope contract.** Before non-trivial work, agree on the expected user behavior,
  failure behavior, acceptable degradation or data loss, explicit non-goals, and completion
  criteria. Treat this contract as the PR scope.
- **Review against the contract.** A confirmed contract, security, or privacy violation is
  actionable. Feedback that expands the contract or adds lifecycle state, retries, timers, or
  cross-component coordination requires owner approval before editing. Do not optimize for zero
  comments; stop when the contract is satisfied and the Gate passes.
- **Simplicity first.** Choose the smallest implementation that fully meets the current
  requirements. Avoid speculative features, abstractions, configuration, and indirection; do not
  add error handling for cases that can't occur. Ask whether a senior engineer would find the
  solution overcomplicated.
- **Avoid legacy baggage.** Preserve backward compatibility only when current project requirements
  demand it—for example, for a public API contract, persisted data, or a rolling deployment. When
  project context confirms compatibility is no longer required, remove obsolete paths instead of
  adding compatibility layers, fallbacks, or migrations.
- **Build in working layers.** Start with the smallest version that works end to end, then add each
  capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished
  complexity.
- **Keep boundaries clear.** Keep components modular and concerns separated.
- **Build for the long term.** Make durable architectural decisions. Do not accept a stopgap that
  only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.
- **Surgical changes.** Every changed line should trace to the request — but it's fine to refactor
  or improve nearby code and remove pre-existing dead code where there's clear room for improvement.
- **Goal-driven execution.** Turn the request into verifiable success criteria, state a brief plan
  for complex tasks, then loop until the criteria are met.
- **Comment only what the code can't say.** Make code explain itself through names and structure.
  Add a comment only for a tool directive, a required marker, or a short *why* a reader couldn't get
  from the code, such as a hidden constraint, a platform quirk, or the race a lock prevents. Never
  restate what the code does, narrate its history, or copy a design doc; link the doc instead.

## Workflow

- **Explore → plan → implement.** For non-trivial changes, understand the relevant code and
  agree on an approach before editing. Skip planning only for small, well-scoped fixes.
- **Evidence, not assertion.** Before claiming work is done, run the **Gate** command and show the
  output. Don't say "it works" without the passing result to back it.
- **Adopt proven patterns.** Before designing a solution, study how established products solve the
  problem and adopt their proven patterns and conventions. Within the repo, find similar code and
  mirror its structure, naming, and idioms rather than imposing a new approach.
- **Reuse before building.** Check the documentation and types of dependencies already in the
  project before writing your own implementation or adding a package. Prefer established,
  well-maintained libraries when they reduce overall complexity or improve reliability; reimplement
  common functionality only with a clear reason.
- **Prefer running focused tests** over the whole suite while iterating, then run the full **Gate**
  before finishing.
- **Open a PR when the work is done.** Once the change is complete and the **Gate** passes, commit
  to a branch and open a pull request without waiting to be asked. Don't leave finished work
  uncommitted on a local branch.

## Commit messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): summary` in
lowercase imperative mood (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`).
Mark breaking changes with `!` (`feat!:`) or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. One logical change per commit.

## Security & safety

- Never hardcode or log secrets, tokens, or credentials; read them from env/secret storage.
- Validate and sanitize all external input; treat user data as untrusted.

## Never

- **Never** skip pre-commit/pre-push hooks (e.g. `--no-verify`) or the **Gate**.
- **Never** commit secrets, `.env` files, or credentials — nor generated artifacts or large binaries.
- **Never** commit directly to the default branch; open a PR.
- **Never** `git push --force` to a shared branch.
- **Never** modify or delete a test to make a broken change pass — fix the code, not the test.
- **Never** suppress an error or warning to hide a problem — address the root cause.
