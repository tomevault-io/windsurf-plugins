# Muninn Project Conventions
# These rules guide all AI assistants and contributors working in this repository.

## Architecture

- The canonical output type for ALL scanner implementations is `[]normalizer.Finding`
  (defined in `internal/normalizer/finding.go`). Never return raw scanner output to callers.
- Every scanner MUST implement the `Scanner` interface in `internal/scanner/scanner.go`.
  The interface is the only contract; callers must not type-assert to concrete types.
- Reporters live in `internal/reporter/`. They consume `[]normalizer.Finding` and write
  to an `io.Writer`. Never pass raw findings to a reporter — apply suppressions first.

## Error Handling

- Always wrap errors: `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`. Never discard errors.
- Never call `panic()`. Return errors up the call stack.
- Scanner `Run()` returning `(nil, nil)` means "ran successfully, zero findings".
  A non-nil error means the scanner itself failed (binary not found, parse error, etc.).

## Function Length

- Keep functions under 40 lines. If a function is growing, extract a helper.
- Helpers that are only used by one file should stay in that file.

## Testing

- Every scanner implementation needs a test file: `internal/scanner/<name>_test.go`.
- Tests MUST use fixture data from `testdata/<scanner>/sample.json`.
  Never make real network calls or exec real binaries in tests.
- Use `testing.T` and standard library `testing` package only — no test frameworks.

## Comments

- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT. Do not narrate the code.
- All exported identifiers (types, functions, constants) must have a godoc comment.
- Do not add TODO/FIXME without a description of what needs to be done.

## Variables and State

- No package-level variables except for constants and errors (`var ErrFoo = errors.New(...)`).
- Inject dependencies via constructor arguments or function parameters.
- Use `context.Context` as the first parameter of any function that may block or call I/O.

## Style

- `gofmt` is the only formatter. Do not use `goimports` directives that auto-add imports.
- Imports: stdlib, then internal (`github.com/skaldlab/muninn/...`), then third-party.
  Separate each group with a blank line.
- Prefer table-driven tests over repeated `if` blocks.

## Adding a New Scanner

1. Create `internal/scanner/<name>.go` with a struct implementing `Scanner`.
2. Add fixture output to `testdata/<name>/sample.json`.
3. Add a test file `internal/scanner/<name>_test.go` that parses the fixture.
4. Add a `ScannerConfig` key in `internal/config/config.go`.
5. Wire the scanner into the orchestrator in `main.go` `scan()`.
6. Update README.md scanner table.
