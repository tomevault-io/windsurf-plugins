# AGENTS.md

pitboard is a Rust command line and a native macOS menu bar app that switch between a
person's own Claude Code and Codex logins. It moves real OAuth logins, so a mistake here
can sign someone out of a paid account. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) is the full
guide; this file is what an agent needs before it touches anything.

## Never

- Never write to, overwrite or delete a keychain item that holds a real login, such as
  `Claude Code-credentials`. Tests name their items after themselves and call
  `common::guard_not_live` before the first write.
- Never run `claude`, `codex login`, `codex logout` or `claude auth login` against a real
  home: they replace or revoke the login stored there.
- Never run a `pitboard` built from a branch, or the built app, against your real home.
  Point `HOME`, `CODEX_HOME` and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` at a fresh directory first, and build
  before you set them, since Cargo and rustup read `HOME` too.
- Never write to `~/.claude`, `~/.claude.json`, `~/.codex` or `~/.pitboard` from a test
  or a script.
- Never print a token. `pitboard doctor --json` hides them; raw files do not.
- Tests never touch launchd, systemd, `/usr/local/bin`, `/Applications` or
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents`.

## Check a change

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked
cargo test --locked -- --skip writing_preserves_attributes
cargo deny check
```

For the app, build the core's bindings once, then run its unit tests:

```sh
./apple/scripts/build-xcframework.sh
swift test --package-path apple
```

CI sets `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`. [Check a change](CONTRIBUTING.md#check-a-change) lists
everything else CI runs, and [The app](CONTRIBUTING.md#the-app) covers the Xcode project,
fixtures and UI tests.

## Rules

- A behaviour change starts with a test that fails against the current code.
- A claim about Claude Code or Codex needs a reading of a named build or an experiment,
  recorded in the tool's register (`crates/pitboard-core/src/provider/*/assumptions.rs`),
  a test or the commit message. [Tool registers](CONTRIBUTING.md#tool-registers) says how.
- A change people would notice gets an entry under `## [Unreleased]` in
  [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- A commit subject is one present-tense sentence saying what pitboard does after the
  change, with no prefix. The body says why, and what was measured.

## Where things are

- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md): the code map, invariants and measured facts.
- [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md): how a release is made. Do not push tags.
- `docs/`: the documentation site; [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) has its writing rules.
