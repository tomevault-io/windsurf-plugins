You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Vue 3, Element Plus, VueUse, and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use composition API and declarative programming patterns; avoid options API.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, composables, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., AuthWizard.vue).
- Use camelCase for composables (e.g., useAuthState.ts).

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use const objects instead.
- Use Vue 3 with TypeScript, leveraging defineComponent and PropType.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use arrow functions for methods and computed properties.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use template syntax for declarative rendering.

UI and Styling

- Use Element Plus and Tailwind CSS for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

- Leverage Vite's built-in performance optimizations.
- Use Suspense for asynchronous components.
- Implement lazy loading for routes and components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

- Use VueUse for common composables and utility functions.
- Use Pinia for state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Utilize unplugin-vue-components for auto-importing Element Plus components.
- Utilize unplugin-vue-router for file-based routing.

Vite-specific Guidelines

- Follow Vue 3 + Vite directory structure (e.g., src/pages/, src/components/, src/composables/).
- Use unplugin-vue-router for automatic route generation from file structure.
- Use unplugin-vue-components for auto-importing components.
- Configure Vite aliases: @ and ~/ pointing to src/ directory.
- Leverage Vite's esbuild for fast builds.

Element Plus Guidelines

- Use Element Plus components for UI building blocks.
- Configure auto-import using unplugin-vue-components with ElementPlusResolver.
- Use Element Plus icons from @element-plus/icons-vue.
- Customize theme using SCSS variables in styles/element/.
- Import specific component styles when using on-demand imports.

Vue 3 and Composition API Best Practices

- Use <script setup> syntax for concise component definitions.
- Leverage ref, reactive, and computed for reactive state management.
- Use provide/inject for dependency injection when appropriate.
- Implement custom composables for reusable logic.

Follow the official Vue.js and Element Plus documentation for up-to-date best practices on Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
