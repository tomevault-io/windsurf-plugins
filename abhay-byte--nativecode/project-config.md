<!-- SPECKIT START -->
For additional context about technologies to be used, project structure,
shell commands, and other important information, read the current plan
<!-- SPECKIT END -->

<!-- context7 -->
Use Context7 MCP to fetch current documentation whenever the user asks about a library, framework, SDK, API, CLI tool, or cloud service -- even well-known ones like React, Next.js, Prisma, Express, Tailwind, Django, or Spring Boot. This includes API syntax, configuration, version migration, library-specific debugging, setup instructions, and CLI tool usage. Use even when you think you know the answer -- your training data may not reflect recent changes. Prefer this over web search for library docs.

Do not use for: refactoring, writing scripts from scratch, debugging business logic, code review, or general programming concepts.

## Steps

1. Always start with `resolve-library-id` using the library name and the user's question, unless the user provides an exact library ID in `/org/project` format
2. Pick the best match (ID format: `/org/project`) by: exact name match, description relevance, code snippet count, source reputation (High/Medium preferred), and benchmark score (higher is better). If results don't look right, try alternate names or queries (e.g., "next.js" not "nextjs", or rephrase the question). Use version-specific IDs when the user mentions a version
3. `query-docs` with the selected library ID and the user's full question (not single words)
4. Answer using the fetched docs

# Agent Instructions

MANDATORY: Use caveman + context-mode at all times. Not optional. Not sometimes. Every turn.

## Skills Available

This directory contains a release pipeline:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `todo-triage/` | Intake: manual feature/bug + GitHub issue import → `/docs/todo/todo.md` |
| `dev-cycle/` | Build: pick todo → branch → plan → impl → build & run → manual test → PR → review → merge to version branch |
| `review/` | 8-pass review (build, plan adherence, correctness, security, performance, style, tests, docs). Spawned in dev-cycle 2.8 and release 1.4. |
| `release/` | Ship: changelog → build & run → review → GitHub Release → merge to main → satisfaction check |

Use the appropriate skill based on the user's intent. Skills cross-reference each other.

## 1. Caveman Mode — ALWAYS ON

All communication ultra-compressed:
- No pleasantries, filler, explanations
- Shortest possible technical answer. 1-3 lines max for status/chat
- No "Here is what I did" / "I've gone ahead" / "Let me explain"
- No markdown fluff — just facts
- If 5 words works, use 5 words
- Exceptions: required artifacts (plans, reviews, changelogs, PR bodies, release notes) and code blocks. Keep those complete but tight.

## 2. Context-Mode MCP Tools — ALWAYS ON

11 tools. Use this priority:

### GATHER & PROCESS (first choice)

| Tool | When | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| `ctx_batch_execute` | 3+ related commands + queries | One round-trip, auto-indexed |
| `ctx_execute` | Filter/count/parse/aggregate data | Think-in-Code: bytes stay in sandbox |
| `ctx_execute_file` | Analyze one file | Same, scoped to one file |

### STORE & SEARCH (second choice)

| Tool | When | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| `ctx_fetch_and_index` | Web docs, changelogs, API refs | Indexed, searchable later |
| `ctx_index` | Store content (docs, specs, output) | FTS5 knowledge base |
| `ctx_search` | Query stored content | BM25 + stem/trigram search |

### UTILITY

| Tool | When |
|------|------|
| `ctx_stats` / `ctx_doctor` / `ctx_upgrade` / `ctx_purge` / `ctx_insight` | Meta |

### Shell via ctx_execute — NOT raw Bash

When you need to run a shell command that produces output (tests, builds, logs, search, git log, ls -la, any command with output you'd read or filter):

```
ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "npm test 2>&1 | grep -E 'FAIL|Error:'")
```

NOT bare Bash tool. Here's why:

| Approach | Output to context | Cost |
|----------|------------------|------|
| Raw Bash + `npm test` | 15,000 lines / 500 KB | High |
| `ctx_execute` shell + `grep` | 12 lines / 400 bytes | Very Low |
| Raw Bash + 10 `ls` calls | 600 lines / 20 KB | Medium |
| `ctx_execute` shell + `ls -R | wc -l` | 1 line / 20 bytes | Near zero |

Bash tool allowed ONLY for:
- **Mutations**: git push, mkdir, rm, mv, chmod, npm install, docker
- **Observing** short fixed output: git status (clean tree), pwd, whoami, which
- File writes (Write/Edit tool unavailable or inappropriate)

`ctx_execute(language: "shell")` is the DEFAULT for all shell work. Raw Bash is the exception.

### General Routing Rules

- `ctx_execute` / `ctx_batch_execute` over Bash when processing data
- `ctx_execute_file` over Read when analyzing a file
- `ctx_fetch_and_index` over WebFetch for web content
- `ctx_search` over re-reading raw sources
- NEVER use Bash for `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`

## 3. Context7 — Documentation

| Step | Tool |
|------|------|
| 1 | `context7_resolve-library-id` — find correct library ID |
| 2 | `context7_query-docs` — query docs with full question |

Library/framework/API docs only. NOT for refactoring, debugging, code review, general programming.

## 4. Web Search
