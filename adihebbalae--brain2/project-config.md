# Project Instructions — Cortex

## Project Overview
Cortex is a local-only personal command center dashboard. It aggregates projects, deadlines, TODOs, and knowledge into a single web UI running on localhost.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js (TypeScript)
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **No database** — all data read from filesystem (markdown files)
- **AI**: Claude API (optional, for summarization)
- **Test framework**: Vitest (unit + integration)

## Key Paths (configured via .env)
- `PROJECTS_DIR` → `C:\Users\boomb\Documents\_Projects` (scanned, never modified except TODO toggles)
- `VAULT_DIR` → `C:\Users\boomb\Documents\SecondBrain` (Obsidian vault)
- Dashboard code lives in THIS repo (Brain2)

## Architecture
- Frontend on `:5173` (Vite dev server)
- Backend on `:3001` (Express)
- `concurrently` runs both via `pnpm dev`
- Backend reads filesystem directly — no DB layer
- Frontend fetches from `http://localhost:3001/api/*`

## Code Conventions
- Use TypeScript strict mode for all files
- Use `import type` for type-only imports
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use Tailwind utility classes — no custom CSS files unless necessary
- Backend route handlers go in `server/routes/`, business logic in `server/lib/`
- Frontend components go in `src/components/`, one component per file
- Use `async/await` over `.then()` chains
- Validate all filesystem paths — never trust user input to construct paths (path traversal prevention)

## File Conventions
- State file detection priority: `agent_state.md` → `Agent_State.json` → `state.md` → `Status.md` → `README.md`
- Deadline format: `- [ ] YYYY-MM-DD | Description | optional-tag`
- Quick capture format: `- [ ] [YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] Text`
- TODO patterns: `- [ ]`, `- [x]`, `TODO:`, `FIXME:`, `HACK:`

## Security Rules
- **No auth needed** — localhost only, single user
- **Path traversal**: All file reads MUST be scoped to PROJECTS_DIR or VAULT_DIR. Reject any path that escapes these roots.
- **File write-back**: Only allowed for TODO checkbox toggling (in-place) and inbox.md appending. No other file writes.
- **API keys**: Store in `.env`, never commit. `.env.example` has placeholders only.

## Testing
- Use Vitest for all tests
- Test files: `*.test.ts` co-located with source
- Mock filesystem for scanner/extractor tests
- Integration tests can use a temporary test directory

## Agent System Protocol

This project uses a multi-agent architecture. Every agent MUST follow this protocol.

### On Session Start
1. Read `.agents/state.json` to understand current project state, active task, and context
2. Read `.agents/workspace-map.md` if you need to locate files or understand project structure
3. Identify your role and act within your boundaries
4. Do NOT proceed on a handoff if `handoff.approved_by_user` is `false` — wait for user approval

### On Session End
1. Update `.agents/state.json` with:
   - What you accomplished (add to `changelog`)
   - Current task status
   - Any blockers or decisions made
   - Updated `last_updated` and `last_updated_by`
2. Update `.agents/state.md` with a human-readable summary of changes
3. If you created or moved files, update `.agents/workspace-map.md`

### Handoff Protocol
When work needs to transfer between agents:

**Autonomous mode (v2.0, VS Code Feb 2026+)**: Manager uses `runSubagent` to spawn worker agents directly. No manual handoff needed after PRD approval. Manager controls the full loop until completion or a break condition is hit (3 Engineer failures or CRITICAL security finding).

**Manual mode (backward compatible)**: The sending agent writes the handoff prompt to `.agents/handoff.md`, updates `state.json` → `handoff` field, and shows a prominent banner to the user:
   ```
   ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
   ║  🔀 SWITCH TO:  @[agent]   |   MODEL:  [Model]             ║
   ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
   ```
   Then tells the user to run `/handoff-to-[agent]` or copy `.agents/handoff.md` to the target agent.

### State Files — Do Not Proliferate
- `.agents/state.json` — Machine state (single source of truth)
- `.agents/state.md` — Human-readable dashboard
- `.agents/workspace-map.md` — File/directory reference
- `.agents/handoff.md` — Current handoff prompt
- `.agents/MODULES.md` — Module registry for complex projects (3+ modules); auto-created by `/init-project`
- **No other state/summary files.** If it's not in these five files, it doesn't exist.

## Code Standards
- Write clean, readable code with meaningful names
- Handle errors at system boundaries (user input, API calls, external data)
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Run tests before declaring work complete
- Run the `quality-gate` skill before every push (lint → type-check → tests → security scan). Do not push with any stage failing.

## Communication Principles
- **Always include WHY**: When making a decision, choosing a priority, or recommending an approach, explain the reasoning. "Do X because Y" not just "Do X."
- **Research first**: Before making changes, search the codebase for existing patterns and conventions. Understand what exists before creating something new.
- **Close the loop**: If tests fail, fix them and re-run. If a build breaks, fix it. Don't report back with broken state — iterate until green.
- **Keep workspace organized**: Update `.agents/workspace-map.md` when files are created or moved. An organized workspace saves tokens and prevents drift.
