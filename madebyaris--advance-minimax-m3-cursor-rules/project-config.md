# Cross-Platform Mobile Development

Guidance for Flutter, React Native, and Expo projects. For general coding workflow, the always-on core **Code Discipline** and **App And Scaffold Discipline** sections are canonical — especially CLI-first scaffolding and verification.

Load this rule when globs match mobile project files. Identify the stack from manifests (`pubspec.yaml`, `package.json` + native folders, `app.json`) before choosing patterns. Do not hand-create `pubspec.yaml`, Xcode/Android project trees, or `.xcodeproj` / `.pbxproj` — use the framework CLI.

---

## Before Changing Mobile Code

1. Identify stack: **Flutter**, **React Native**, **Expo**, or other.
2. Read manifest, entry point (`main.dart`, `App.tsx`), navigation setup, and existing state-management pattern.
3. Match platform folder conventions already in the repo — do not restructure unprompted.
4. For new dependencies or SDK versions, verify against current official docs before recommending.

## Scaffold & Verify (CLI-first)

| Stack | Create | Add deps | Typical verify |
|-------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Flutter | `flutter create` | `flutter pub add` | `flutter analyze`, `flutter test` |
| React Native | `npx react-native init` | `npm install` | `npx react-native doctor`, build one platform |
| Expo | `npx create-expo-app` | `npx expo install` | `npx expo doctor`, `npx expo start` |

After structural changes, run the stack's analyze/test/build check before claiming done.

## Architecture Quick Reference

**Good cross-platform fit:** content apps, business/productivity, MVPs, teams with web background, similar UI across platforms.

**Consider more native work when:** heavy AR/camera, games, deep OS integration, strict platform HIG, or performance-critical media pipelines.

| Framework | Best for | Watch out for |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Flutter | Custom UI, performance | App size, Dart ecosystem |
| React Native | JS/TS teams, code share | Native modules, bridge overhead |
| Expo | Fast iteration, managed workflow | Native module limits (unless dev client) |

**Share across platforms:** domain logic, models, API client, validation, most state logic.  
**Keep platform-specific:** native permissions, push/deep links, store billing, platform UI chrome where HIG matters.

Layering (presentation → domain → data) applies; see `language-agnostic-patterns` when refactoring module boundaries.

---

## State & Navigation

- Reuse the pattern already in the repo (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, Redux, Zustand, etc.) — do not introduce a second state library.
- Navigation: one primary approach (go_router, React Navigation, Expo Router) per app; match existing route definitions.
- Persist only what the product requires; handle offline/error states explicitly on mobile networks.

## Mobile Design Quality

Web design instincts do not transfer 1:1 to mobile. The judgment calls:

- **Platform type defaults are correct here.** SF Pro on iOS and Roboto on Android are the *native* choice, not slop — the web font bans in `anti-slop-design` apply to display/brand moments, not to app body text. Custom fonts earn their place on headings and brand surfaces only.
- **Design for the thumb, not the cursor.** Primary actions in the bottom half of the screen; destructive actions away from habitual tap zones; nothing important hidden behind hover (there is none).
- **Navigation follows platform grammar.** Bottom tabs for 3–5 top-level destinations; respect the Android back gesture and iOS swipe-back; use native share sheets, switches, and pickers instead of web-style rebuilds.
- **Glanceability over density.** One primary piece of information per screen region; web dashboard density fails at arm's length on a 6-inch display.
- **Loading is layout-shaped.** Skeletons that match the final layout; render cached/partial data immediately rather than blocking the screen on the full payload.
- **Lists must be virtualized.** `FlatList` / `ListView.builder` with stable keys — never map an unbounded array into scroll children (also listed in traps; it is the #1 mobile perf bug).
- **Motion at 60fps.** RN: `useNativeDriver` / Reanimated on the UI thread. Flutter: animate with `AnimatedBuilder`/implicit animations, not `setState` rebuilds of whole subtrees.

For visual direction (palette, tone, category), still load `anti-slop-design` — adapted through the platform conventions above.

---

## Platform Integration

- Request permissions at point of use with clear rationale; handle denied/permanent-deny flows.
- Test on **both** iOS and Android when behavior is platform-specific — simulators/emulators are minimum proof; label device-only issues `unverified`.
- Deep links, push, and IAP: follow each store's current guidelines; verify against official docs.

---

## Performance & Release

- Images/assets: appropriate resolution; lazy-load lists (avoid building unbounded scroll children).
- Profile before optimizing (Flutter DevTools, RN Performance monitor).
- Release: match existing signing, flavors/schemes, and store listing workflow in the repo — do not invent a new pipeline without asking.
