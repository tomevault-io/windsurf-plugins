# Agent Teams (M3 + Cursor 3.7)

Use this rule when the work is best handled by multiple agents or explicitly separated roles.

## Team Shape

- Define roles before delegating: planner, explorer, implementer, verifier, or another bounded role.
- Give each role a distinct objective, owned surface, and stopping point.
- Do not create overlapping ownership without a clear reason.

## Multiple concurrent Cursor sessions

Cursor 3.7 can run **several agent sessions in parallel** (for example from the Agents Window sidebar, or kicked off from mobile, web, Slack, GitHub, Linear). The same rules apply as for parallel roles or subagent branches: use parallel sessions only for **independent** workstreams, keep **non-overlapping ownership** of files and decisions, and **serialize** anything that would race the same artifact. More sessions visible at once does not make conflicting edits safer.

## Multi-Environment Teams

When a single team spans environments (some roles local, some in `/worktree`, some in cloud, some over SSH):

- The handoff contract must name the **environment** per role — local, worktree, cloud, or SSH — and the **model** per role.
- Choose environments to remove file-system races: if two roles may touch the same artifact, pin both to the same isolated worktree or serialize the touch.
- Prefer `/worktree` for any role whose output will be reviewed and possibly discarded. Prefer `cloud` for any role whose value is "keep working while I am away."
- When one role's output feeds another role in a different environment, the handoff payload should include the file paths, branch, and any required state — not just a prose summary.

## Handoff Contract

Every handoff should state:

- current goal
- **which repo or workspace root** when more than one is in play
- **environment** (local / worktree / cloud / SSH) and **model** (e.g. `MiniMax-M3`, `composer-2.5`, `auto`)
- files, dirs, or questions owned
- findings or artifacts produced
- open risks or assumptions
- exact next step for the receiving role

## Serial vs Parallel

- Use parallel teams only for independent branches.
- Use serial teams when one role depends on another role's findings.
- If two agents may touch the same file or decision, centralize that step instead of racing them.

## /best-of-n as a Team Pattern

For decisions where a second opinion is cheap insurance (architecture choice, design parity, risky refactor, choosing between two valid approaches), treat `/best-of-n` as a team pattern:

```text
1. Define the question and the deliverable shape
2. Run the same prompt across 2-4 models in parallel worktrees
3. Read each result centrally
4. Pick the strongest, merge complementary ideas, or escalate to the user with the comparison
```

The "team" is the synthesis step, not the model run; centralize it.

## Challenge And Review

- At least one role should challenge assumptions, edge cases, or weak evidence on non-trivial work.
- Reviewer or verifier roles should critique the work, not merely restate it.
- Keep disagreement evidence-based and scoped to the task.
- A verifier reviewing visual work should re-read the actual post-change frame, not rely on a prose description; that is `multimodal-grounded` review.

## Human Escalation

Escalate to the user when:
- a branch changes architecture or product direction
- safety, destructive actions, or irreversible changes appear
- two valid team recommendations lead to meaningfully different outcomes
- `/best-of-n` returns a near-tie that needs human taste

## Closeout

- Synthesize in the main thread before acting on team output.
- Final user-facing claims must follow the always-on status and verification contract.
- Include the environment, the model, and the relevant evidence (including `multimodal-grounded` for visual claims) in the closeout.
