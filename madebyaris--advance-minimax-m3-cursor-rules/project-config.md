# Tool Discovery (Cursor 3.7 + M3)

Current through **Cursor 3.7** (Jun 2026). Use this rule when the runtime surface is unfamiliar, tool-heavy, or likely to differ across environments.

## Discovery Order

Inventory the current surface in this order:

1. direct tools exposed in the prompt (`Read`, `Grep`, `Task`, `Await`, etc. — names vary by surface; the live list wins)
2. browser, canvas, and other IDE-native surfaces exposed in the prompt
   - **Browser MCP** (`cursor-ide-browser`): snapshot-first automation; read the server's tool descriptors
   - **Canvas** (`.canvas.tsx`): confirm the session supports canvases before promising one; load the `canvas` skill before authoring
   - **Design Mode** (3.7): user-driven in browser or canvas — not an agent tool; when the user has selected or annotated elements, treat that as the primary input for UI edits
3. **Cursor Marketplace** (or team marketplace) plugins already installed — same schema-first rules as other MCPs; discover tools and resources from each plugin's descriptors before calling
4. MCP tools and resources with their current schemas (including project-configured servers under the session's MCP descriptor path)
5. web docs only when discovery or versions still remain unclear

For delegation, read the live `Task` schema for available `subagent_type` values and whether nesting or `run_in_background` applies (Multitask Mode expects background runs).

## Schema-First Use

- Read the current schema or descriptor before calling unfamiliar MCP tools.
- Match the task step to the smallest tool that can honestly do it.
- Do not infer hidden parameters or old wrapper names from memory.
- **MCP Apps structured content**: when a tool returns structured content, prefer the structured form over reconstructing from prose. When the structured data *is* the deliverable, route it to a **canvas** rather than a markdown table in chat.

## Capability Mapping

Before acting, translate the task into:

- what must be read
- what must be changed
- what must be verified
- which currently exposed tool best serves each step

For visual-fidelity work, also translate into: which image/frame must be read, which **Design Mode** selections the user provided (if any), and which post-change frame must be re-read after editing.

For analytical or tabular deliverables, also translate into: whether a **canvas** is the right surface (audit, metrics breakdown, MCP query results) vs. inline chat prose.

## Discovery Loop

```text
1. Inventory current tools
2. Read the schema for unfamiliar options
3. Choose the smallest viable tool
4. Try the narrowest valid call
5. Verify the result
6. Escalate or fall back only if needed
```

## Safe Fallbacks

- If a tool is unavailable, say so and choose the next best exposed path.
- If discovery fails, simplify the task step and re-check the current surface.
- Do not promise a tool-based deliverable until the path is confirmed.

## Anti-Patterns

- assuming a tool exists because it existed in another environment
- using shell as the first choice when a direct tool is exposed
- calling MCP tools without reading current schemas
- hiding tool uncertainty behind confident prose
- ignoring MCP Apps structured content and dumping it as prose or markdown tables when a canvas is available
- promising canvas, Design Mode, browser, or nested `Task` behavior before confirming the current session exposes it
