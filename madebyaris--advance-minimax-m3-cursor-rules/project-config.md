# Fable 5 Coding Craft

Distilled from how frontier coding agents earn SWE-Bench-class scores. The score does not come from knowing more syntax — it comes from judgment: finding the right place to change, changing as little as possible, and proving the change at the surface that matters. This rule transfers that judgment to any model.

The always-on core **Code Discipline** section is canonical for workflow (read-before-edit, CI discovery, minimal diff, verification). This rule goes deeper on the judgment calls inside that workflow.

## The Craft Hierarchy

When choices conflict, optimize in this order:

1. **Correct** — does what the user actually needs, including edge cases the repo already cares about
2. **Clear** — a maintainer who has never seen this diff understands it in one read
3. **Consistent** — matches this repo's naming, layering, error style, and test style
4. **Small** — smallest honest diff; no opportunistic changes
5. **Fast / clever** — only after the above, and only with a measurement justifying it

Never trade a level up for a level down. Clever-but-unclear is a defect, not a style.

## Locate Before You Write

The highest-leverage minutes in any coding task are spent finding *where* the change belongs, not writing it. Most weak fixes are correct code in the wrong place.

1. Start from the strongest signal: a failing test, a stack trace, an error string you can grep, or the user-visible symptom.
2. Trace from symptom to mechanism: which function produced this output? Which caller decided to call it with these inputs? Where does the data originate?
3. Read the neighbors before editing: the callers, the tests, and at least one sibling implementation of the same pattern. They tell you the contract you must not break and the conventions you must follow.
4. Identify the owner of the behavior: the one place that is *responsible* for the decision you need to change. A fix at the owner is 5 lines; a fix at every symptom site is 50 and rots.
5. Only then write. If you cannot name why the change belongs in this file rather than its caller or callee, you have not finished locating.

## The Root-Cause Method

Every bug is a broken invariant: something that was supposed to be guaranteed, wasn't. Patching the symptom leaves the guarantee broken for the next caller.

Work the chain:

```text
Symptom      → what the user / test observed
Mechanism    → the exact code path that produced the symptom
Invariant    → what guarantee was supposed to make this impossible
Breach       → where and why that guarantee failed
Fix          → restore the guarantee at the point it is owned
```

Ask: "What was supposed to make this state unreachable, and why didn't it?" If the answer is "nothing ever guaranteed it," the fix is to *create* the guarantee at the boundary that owns the data — not to add a defensive check at every consumer.

Acceptable reasons to fix a symptom instead: an emergency mitigation, or the root cause is out of scope. In both cases, say so explicitly and name the real cause.

## Simplicity Taste

The most common quality failure in model-written code is not incorrectness — it is unrequested complexity. Counters:

| Impulse | Replace with |
|---|---|
| Defensive null/undefined checks on internal calls | Validate once at the boundary that owns the data; trust internal invariants |
| try/catch around code that cannot throw meaningfully | Let programmer errors fail loudly; catch only where you have a recovery strategy |
| Config options, parameters, or flags "for flexibility" | Hardcode the single current behavior; add the option when a second caller needs it |
| Abstraction on first duplication | Wait for the third occurrence; duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction |
| Wrapper/helper/manager class for one call site | Inline it; a function used once is usually a sentence, not a chapter |
| Fallback values masking failed operations (`or defaultValue` on an error path) | Propagate the failure; a silent wrong answer is worse than a loud error |
| Backwards-compatibility shims for code you can just change | Change the code and its callers in the same diff |
| Rewriting a module to fix one function | Fix the function |

Deleting code is a contribution. If the correct fix removes lines, remove them — do not preserve dead branches "just in case."

## Error-Handling Philosophy

- Errors are part of the data flow, not an afterthought. Decide for each failure: propagate, recover with a real strategy, or crash loudly. "Log and continue" is a decision too — it means the operation is genuinely optional. Be honest about which one applies.
- Programmer errors (violated invariants, impossible states) should fail fast and loud. User and environment errors (bad input, network down, file missing) get handled paths with actionable messages.
- An error message must let the reader act: what was being attempted, with what key values, and what to check first.
