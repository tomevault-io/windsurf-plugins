# Code Comments

## Principle

Each file reads as if it was always designed this way. Comments guide the next developer, not narrate the development journey.

Note: These rules are not exhaustive. Extrapolate from the principles and examples to the specific context you are working in.

## Remove

- **Implementation backstories**: "We do this because the other day X happened"
- **Obvious narration**: "Create the attribute", "Loop through keys", "Check if valid" -- if the code says it, the comment is noise
- **Debugging breadcrumbs**: "Without this, subsequent tests may see the modifier key as still held"
- **Trial-and-error reasoning**: "We tried X but it caused Y so we do Z instead"

## Keep

- **Non-obvious design decisions**: stated as *what* and *why this design*, not *what happened to us*
- **Tricky invariants**: conditions that would be easy to accidentally break
- **API contracts**: docstrings on public methods with Args, Returns, Raises

## Prefer Instead

- **Rename** a variable or function to be self-explanatory rather than adding a comment
- **Docstrings** on classes and public methods (Google style: `Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:`)
- **Type hints** over comments about expected types
- **Short inline comments** on the *why*, never the *what*
