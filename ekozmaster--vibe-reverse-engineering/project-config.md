# Vibe Reverse Engineering — Copilot Instructions

This is a reverse engineering toolkit for PE binaries (`.exe` / `.dll`) combining static analysis (`retools`), dynamic analysis (`livetools` via Frida), and D3D9 frame tracing. Work is organized around knowledge base files (`kb.h`) that accumulate discoveries and feed back into richer decompilation.


## Bootstrap

On first use, or if `kb.h` is missing or contains only minimal content, automatically run:
`python -m retools.bootstrap <binary> --project <ProjectName>`
before any further static or dynamic analysis. **Bootstrap takes 2-5 minutes** — it scans for RTTI classes, identifies CRT/library functions, and propagates labels. The output goes to `patches/<ProjectName>/kb.h` — verify this file exists and has content after bootstrap returns. All subsequent `decompiler.py` calls must use `--types patches/<ProjectName>/kb.h`. **Bootstrap speeds up all subsequent decompilation**: `--types` pre-analyzes every known function so cross-references resolve to named functions and you avoid the expensive full-binary analysis pass. Tell the user it's running and do other work while it completes.

**In parallel with bootstrap**, run `python retools/pyghidra_backend.py analyze <binary> --project patches/<ProjectName>` to create a reusable Ghidra project. This takes 5-15 minutes but makes all subsequent pyghidra decompilations near-instant. Both bootstrap and pyghidra analyze can run simultaneously.

Run `python verify_install.py` from the repo root before first use. If pyghidra/Ghidra shows as WARN, run `python verify_install.py --setup` to auto-download JDK 21 + Ghidra + pyghidra (~600MB one-time download). Common failures: missing `git lfs pull` (LFS pointer stubs instead of real binaries), missing `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Delegation Rule

**Never run static analysis tools (`retools`) directly in sequence.** Delegate to the `static-analyzer` agent for all offline analysis. Exceptions — run these inline (all <5s):

- `sigdb.py identify` / `fingerprint` — single-function ID or compiler detection
- `context.py assemble` / `postprocess` — context gathering and decompiler annotation (assemble now includes forward constant propagation by default; use `--no-dataflow` on large functions)
- `dataflow.py --constants` / `--slice` — single-function constant propagation or backward register trace
- `readmem.py` — single typed read from a PE file
- `asi_patcher.py build` — build step, not analysis
- `pyghidra_backend.py status` — project existence check (<1s)

If you're about to run a second `retools` command in the same turn, stop and delegate everything to a subagent.

Run all tools from the repo root using `python -m <module>` syntax (e.g. `python -m retools.search`).

## Live Tools First

The main agent owns `livetools` — always use them to verify static findings and act on leads from subagents. Use `attach <name_or_pid>` for running processes, or `attach <path> --spawn` to launch + instrument before init code runs. When a subagent returns addresses or candidates, immediately follow up with live tools (trace, breakpoint, mem read/write) rather than spawning more static analysis. Static analysis finds clues; live tools confirm and act on them. Do not wait idle for subagents — use live tools to explore independently while static analysis runs in the background.

## Dual-Backend Decompilation

The decompiler supports two backends with different strengths:

- **pyghidra (preferred)** — better MSVC type propagation, library call resolution, larger function scope detection. Requires a Ghidra project (`pyghidra_backend.py analyze` creates one). Use when `patches/<project>/ghidra/<binary>.gpr` exists.
- **r2ghidra (fallback)** — better `__thiscall` on small functions, no JVM startup. Always available.

**Auto mode**: `python -m retools.decompiler binary.exe 0x401000 --types patches/proj/kb.h --project patches/proj` tries pyghidra first, falls back to r2ghidra. Use `--project` alongside `--types` for auto selection.

**Dual-backend deep analysis**: For complex exploratory tasks (finding subsystems, mapping call chains), run both backends in parallel on the same functions and merge findings. r2ghidra results go to `findings_r2.md`, pyghidra to `findings.md`. Neither backend finds everything alone -- merging both gives the most complete picture.

## Engineering Standards

Every change should make the codebase better, not just make the problem go away. If a solution needs a paragraph to justify why it's not a hack, it's a hack.

**Remove:** fixes in the wrong layer, tolerance inflation, catch-all exception swallowing, excessive null-guard chains, god methods (200+ lines), leaky abstractions.

**Design for:** single responsibility (if you need "and" to describe it, split it), ownership (the component that creates the problem owns the fix), minimal public surface.
