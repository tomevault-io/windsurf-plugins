# Project Workspace

Use `patches/<project_name>/` (git-ignored) for all project-specific artifacts:
- Knowledge base files (`kb.h`)
- One-off analysis scripts
- ASI patch specs and builds
- Notes, logs, collected trace data

Create the project subfolder on first use.

# Backups

Before modifying project files (proxy source, kb.h, proxy.ini, build scripts, ASI specs), create a timestamped backup in `patches/<project>/backups/`:

```
patches/<project>/backups/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_<description>/
```

Copy ALL files being modified into the backup folder. The description should be a short slug of what the update does (e.g. `added-world-matrix-regs`, `fixed-albedo-stage`, `enabled-skinning`).

Create the backup BEFORE making changes so it captures the last known-good state. This applies to all development work — FFP proxy edits, ASI patch specs, build config changes, and any other project file modifications.

# Knowledge Base

When reverse engineering a binary, maintain a knowledge base file (`.h`) that accumulates discoveries. Store in `patches/<project>/kb.h`.

**Format:** C types (no prefix), functions (`@` prefix), globals (`$` prefix):
```c
struct Foo { int x; float y; };
@ 0x401000 void __cdecl ProcessInput(int key);
$ 0x7C5548 Object* g_mainObject
```

**When to update the KB:**
- When you identify a function's purpose, add `@ 0xADDR` with a descriptive name and signature
- When you reconstruct a struct (e.g., from `structrefs.py --aggregate`), add the struct definition
- When you identify a global variable via `datarefs.py`, add `$ 0xADDR` with its name and type
- When you identify magic constants, define an enum with named values
- When `rtti.py` reveals a class name, use it in struct/function names
