# LaneKeep — Developer Guide

## What This Is

LaneKeep is a governance guardrails and insights tool for AI coding agents (Claude Code). It intercepts tool calls
via Claude Code's PreToolUse hook, evaluates them through a tiered pipeline,
and enforces allow/deny decisions. Disabled by default — opt-in.

## Core Concepts

| Term | What it is |
|------|------------|
| **Event** | A raw tool call occurrence — one record per hook fire (`PreToolUse` or `PostToolUse`). `total_events` always increments regardless of outcome. |
| **Evaluation** | An individual check within the pipeline. Each evaluator module (`eval-hardblock.sh`, `eval-rules.sh`, `eval-budget.sh`, etc.) independently examines the event and sets `EVAL_PASSED`/`EVAL_REASON`. A single event triggers many evaluations; results recorded in the trace `evaluators[]` array with `name`, `tier`, and `passed`. |
| **Decision** | The final pipeline verdict: `allow`, `deny`, `warn`, or `ask`. Stored in the `decision` field of each trace entry and counted in `decisions.deny / warn / ask / allow` in cumulative metrics. |
| **Action** | An event where the tool actually ran (`allow` or `warn`). Denied and pending-ask calls don't count. `eval-budget.sh` increments `action_count` only when `already_blocked != true` and `skip_increment != true` — this is what `budget.max_actions` measures. |

```
Event (raw hook call)
  └── Evaluations (N checks run against it)
        └── Decision (single verdict: allow/deny/warn/ask)
              └── Action (only if tool actually ran — counts against max_actions)
```

## Important Rules

- All enforcement decisions are logged to JSONL trace. No silent drops.
- TaskSpec is immutable after creation.
- Evaluators return 0 (pass) or 1 (deny). Set globals before returning.
- `set -e` in bats tests catches `return 1` — use `func args || true` then check globals.
- jq `//` operator treats `false` as null — use `if has("field") then .field else default end`.
