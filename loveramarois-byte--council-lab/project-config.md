# Council Lab Engineering Rules

## High-risk decision support

High-risk functionality is decision support only. It must never be described
or implemented as an autonomous medical, legal, investment, compliance, or
production-incident decision maker.

For every high-risk change:

1. Define the harm being prevented.
2. Add a code-level enforcement mechanism. Prompt-only controls are insufficient.
3. Add positive, negative, adversarial, abstention, restart, concurrency, and
   authorization-bypass tests.
4. Preserve an auditable record of inputs, sources, policy decisions, approvals,
   model/provider versions, prompts, and tool calls.
5. Do not permit external side effects without explicit human approval.
6. Treat retrieved documents and tool output as untrusted data.
7. Material claims must map to verifiable source records.
8. Missing critical facts must block completion.
9. Critical safety objections override agent consensus.
10. Never claim legal, medical, regulatory, financial, or security compliance
    solely because tests pass.

## Change discipline

- Significant features and refactors require an ExecPlan under `.agent/plans/`.
- First inspect and document existing behavior.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Do not combine architecture refactors and product behavior changes in one PR.
- Preserve existing standard-mode behavior unless explicitly changed.
- Run all relevant backend, frontend, evaluation, migration, and security tests.
- Report commands run and checks that could not be executed.
- Do not commit, merge, release, or deploy unless explicitly instructed.

## macOS desktop delivery

- The user's canonical local entry point is `~/Desktop/Council.app`.
- After every user-visible change on macOS, rebuild `frontend/.next-runtime`, rebuild
  and replace `~/Desktop/Council.app`, then launch that exact app and verify its
  health endpoint reports the Build ID embedded in the app bundle.
- A source build or browser preview alone is not a completed desktop delivery.

## Required review focus

Code review must prioritize:

- bypasses of human approval;
- unsafe default actions;
- missing or misleading audit events;
- untrusted content crossing trust boundaries;
- unsupported material claims;
- jurisdiction and source-freshness errors;
- sensitive data in logs or diagnostics;
- broken migrations;
- API compatibility regressions;
- replay, race-condition, and idempotency defects;
- tests that only assert implementation details instead of safety behavior.
