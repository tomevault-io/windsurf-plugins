This rules specifies how authentication checks are done on the OpenCouncil repo.

1. Use the methods in src/lib/auth.ts.
2. Two main methods exist: isUserAuthorizedToEdit (returns a boolean) and withUserAuthorizedToEdit (throws if not authorized).
3. Both methods are asynchronous, and should be await-ed -- otherwise this can lead to serious authentication bugs.

Example usage:
    const editable = await isUserAuthorizedToEdit({ cityId: data.meeting.cityId });

or:
    await withUserAuthorizedToEdit({ partyId: params.partyId })
