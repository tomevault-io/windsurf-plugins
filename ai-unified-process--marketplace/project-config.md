# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

AI Unified Process Marketplace is a collection of plugins for Claude Code that implement the AI Unified Process
methodology. The repository is structured as a marketplace with a two-layer architecture: a stack-agnostic core and
technology-specific plugins.

## Plugin Architecture

### Two-Layer Design

- **aiup-core** — Stack-agnostic methodology: from vision to use case specification. Works with any tech stack.
- **vaadin-jooq** — Stack-specific: implementation and testing for the Vaadin + jOOQ stack. Requires core.

### Marketplace Configuration

- `marketplace.json` defines the marketplace with owner info and an array of plugins
- Each plugin entry has `name`, `source` (path), and `description`

### Plugin Structure

Each plugin contains:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Plugin metadata (name, version, author)
- `.mcp.json` - MCP server configurations for external tools
- `skills/` - Skills with SKILL.md definitions; each skill is also a slash command

## AI Unified Process Workflow

Skills follow the AI Unified Process phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition.

### Core (stack-agnostic)

| Phase        | Skill (slash command) | Description                                                          |
|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inception    | `/requirements`       | Generate requirements from vision                                    |
| Elaboration  | `/entity-model`       | Create entity model with Mermaid ER                                  |
| Elaboration  | `/use-case-diagram`   | Generate PlantUML use case diagrams                                  |
| Construction | `/use-case-spec`      | Write detailed use case specifications                               |
| Construction | `/test-case`          | Write an end-to-end test case (TC-*) chaining several use cases      |
| Any          | `/reverse-engineer`   | Recover use case diagram, use case specs, and entity model from code |
| Construction | `/implement`          | Stack-agnostic dispatcher — detects the stack and delegates          |
| Construction | `/test`               | Stack-agnostic dispatcher — server-side unit / integration tests     |
| Construction | `/e2e`                | Stack-agnostic dispatcher — browser-based end-to-end tests           |

### Vaadin/jOOQ (stack-specific — invoked by the core dispatchers)

| Phase        | Skill (slash command)    | Description                                               |
|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Construction | `/flyway-migration`      | Create Flyway migrations                                  |
| Construction | `/implement-vaadin-jooq` | Implement use cases using Vaadin and jOOQ                 |
| Construction | `/browserless-test`      | Create Vaadin Browserless unit tests (recommended)        |
| Construction | `/karibu-test`           | Create Karibu unit tests (legacy — superseded since 25.1) |
| Construction | `/playwright-test`       | Create Playwright tests — use case (UC-*) or test case journey (TC-*) |

The core `/implement`, `/test`, and `/e2e` skills inspect the project's build files (`pom.xml`, `build.gradle`,
`package.json`, etc.) to choose which stack-specific skill to invoke. New stack plugins (e.g. a future
`aiup-spring-react`) plug in by shipping their own `implement-<stack>` and test skills and adding a row to each
dispatcher's routing table.

## Releasing to the Tessl Registry

Pushes to `main` publish plugins to the Tessl registry (https://tessl.io/registry/aiup) via
`.github/workflows/publish-tessl.yml`. Key facts:

- **Each plugin has two version files that must be bumped together**: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
  (used by Claude Code) and `.tessl-plugin/plugin.json` (used by the publish workflow). The workflow
  versions off `.tessl-plugin/plugin.json` only — bumping just the Claude one silently skips the
  release ("version already published").
- The workflow publishes a plugin only when its `.tessl-plugin` version is new; pushes without a
  version bump are skipped, not failed.
