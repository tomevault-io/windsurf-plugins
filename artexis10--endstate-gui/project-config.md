# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Vite dev server (web preview, http://127.0.0.1:1420)
npm run tauri dev        # Full Tauri dev with hot reload

# Build
npm run build            # TypeScript check + Vite build
npm run tauri build      # Full Tauri production binary

# Testing
npm run test             # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:coverage    # Unit tests with v8 coverage
npm run test:e2e         # Playwright E2E tests
npm run test:contract    # CLI envelope contract tests (Node.js)
npm run test:all         # Full pipeline: openspec validate + unit + contract + e2e
cd src-tauri && cargo test  # Rust unit tests

# Run a single test file
npx vitest run src/lib/apply-utils.test.ts
# Run tests matching a name pattern
npx vitest run -t "pattern"
# Run a single Playwright spec
npx playwright test e2e/apply-modal.spec.ts

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# OpenSpec validation (also runs as pre-push hook)
npm run openspec:validate --all --strict --no-interactive
# Emergency bypass: OPENSPEC_BYPASS=1 git push

# Git hooks
npm run hooks:install    # Install lefthook pre-push hook
```

## Architecture

### Core Design: GUI is a Thin Presentation Layer

All business logic lives in the **Endstate CLI**. The GUI contains no provisioning logic. Every operation executes by spawning the CLI with `--json` and consuming structured JSON output. The GUI never fabricates or infers state.

### Data Flow

```
User Action → React Component → Tauri invoke()
  → Rust Backend (lib.rs → engine_adapter.rs)
  → Spawns: endstate <cmd> --json <args>
  → NDJSON streaming output
  → Rust parses lines, injects runId, emits via Tauri event channel (endstate://event)
  → Frontend event handler → State update → UI render
```

**Final state** always derives from the JSON envelope at command completion. Streaming text is only used for transient progress UI (live activity feed, counters).

### Frontend (src/)

- **`App.tsx`** — Main component with complex state for capabilities, report, verify, running action, lifecycle tracking
- **`components/app/overview/`** — Overview screen with dual-flow architecture (Capture/Setup flows). `useOverviewState` hook manages action status, expanded cards, running state. `FlowSelector` is the primary action hub.
- **`components/ui/`** — shadcn/ui primitives. **All interactive UI must use shadcn components** (Button, Select, Dialog, etc.) unless there's a documented exception. Native HTML elements break theming.
- **`lib/`** — Core logic: engine execution, streaming event parsing, state management, profile handling
- **`types.ts`** — Central types: `EndstateEnvelope<T>`, capability/verify/apply/capture data types

### Rust Backend (src-tauri/src/)

- **`lib.rs`** — Tauri commands (`engine_run`, `engine_cancel`, `engine_is_running`, etc.) and event emission
- **`engine_adapter.rs`** — CLI streaming adapter: spawns process, reads stdout/stderr concurrently, parses NDJSON, injects runId on all events, enforces one-run-at-a-time mutex
- **`cmd_impl.rs`** — Shared command builder. **Critical:** Windows `.cmd` PATH shims require `cmd /C` wrapping. All spawn sites MUST use `build_engine_command()` — never construct `Command::new(exe)` directly for engine invocation.

### Key Abstractions

- **`EndstateEnvelope<T>`** — Standardized CLI response: `{ schemaVersion, cliVersion, command, runId, timestampUtc, success, data, error }`
- **`EngineEvent`** — Union: LogEvent | ResultEvent | CliEnvelopeEvent
- **Event filtering by runId** — Events from previous runs must not pollute current display
- **One run at a time** — Mutex guard at Rust layer blocks concurrent CLI execution

### Path Alias

`@/*` maps to `./src/*` (configured in tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts).

### localStorage Namespacing

Keys are prefixed by runtime: `tauri:`, `web:`, or `test:` (e.g., `tauri:Endstate-gui-settings`). Playwright tests use `VITE_STORAGE_NS=test` for isolation.

## Authority Documents

These govern AI behavior in this repo, in precedence order:

1. `docs/ai/AI_CONTRACT.md` — AI behavior contract (highest authority)
2. `docs/ai/PROJECT_RULES.md` — Operational policy
3. `CLAUDE.md` — Architecture context, commands, landmines (this file, auto-loaded by Claude Code)
4. `openspec/specs/` — Invariants and behavior specifications (lazy-loaded on demand)

### Key Rules from These Documents

- **Smallest change** that satisfies acceptance criteria. No unrelated refactors, formatting sweeps, or dependency bumps.
