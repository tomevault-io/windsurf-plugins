# Expense Autopilot

An automated expense receipt management system with Claude Code integration.

## Project Overview

This project helps automate the tedious process of managing expense receipts for
filing in expense systems like Concur. It provides a unified `/expense` command
with multiple subcommands for different tasks.

## Main Command

Use `/expense` followed by an action and arguments:

```bash
/expense scan receipt.pdf
/expense process receipt.pdf
/expense batch
/expense report
/expense mileage "client meeting" 45
/expense check
/expense export concur
```
