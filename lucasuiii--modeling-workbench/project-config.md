# CLAUDE.md

Choose the entry point from the user's task:

- **Solve or resume a contest problem:** read [.agents/skills/cumcm-workflow/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/cumcm-workflow/SKILL.md) and follow it. The engineering instructions below do not apply to solving the contest problem. Resolve this link from the directory containing this file, not the contest workspace.
- **Edit this workflow repository:** follow the engineering instructions below. Do not start a contest run unless requested.

The Claude Code Skill at `.claude/skills/cumcm-workflow/SKILL.md` routes to the same canonical workflow.

## Layout

`.agents/skills/cumcm-workflow/` is the single canonical tree: `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `schemas/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`. `.claude/skills/cumcm-workflow/SKILL.md` is a thin router into it and deliberately restates no rules — if you add a rule, it goes in the canonical tree only.

## Invariants to preserve when editing

- **Machine facts are recorded, never hand-written.** If a change would make an agent type a SHA-256, an exit code, a page count or a result value into a contract, the change is wrong; extend a recorder instead.
- **Two knobs only.** `mode` (`working` / `finalizing`) and `--gate-mode` (`preflight` / `enforce`). Do not reintroduce a profile axis.
- **Four stage statuses.** `not_started`, `in_progress`, `passed`, `needs_revision`.
- **Schemas describe shape, the checker decides strictness.** Mode-dependent requirements (for example the frozen model contract) live in `workflow_checks.py`, not in a JSON Schema `required` list — a schema cannot see the mode.
- **A schema is also a prompt.** An optional field that nothing consumes will still get filled in by an agent. Delete it rather than leaving it optional.
- **Exploratory runs never block.** Anything about an `official_run: false` run is at most a warning.
- **Runs are append-only and their evidence is frozen.** A rerun appends a successor with `parent_run_id`; it must never overwrite a run directory. Declared source and outputs are copied into `runs/<id>/{source,outputs}/` mirroring the original paths, and hashed as copies. Supersession is derived from the parent chain -- never write it back into the old manifest, because that changes its hash and stales every decision bound to it.
- **Declared is not recorded.** Anything the caller types (`--assert name=pass`) is a note; only what the run wrote itself (`--assert-file`) is machine-derived evidence. Tag provenance on the record and let the checks that mean "this was verified" read only the recorded kind. The same test applies to any future field: who produced this, the tool or the caller?
- **A run may only claim what it produced and verified.** Claim outputs and assertion files must be freshly generated at paths cleared with recoverable backups before execution -- a leftover file must never be frozen as this run's evidence -- and assertions are never inherited by a rerun. Both are evidence-fabrication paths, not conveniences.
- **Only a successful official rerun supersedes.** A failed or exploratory child replaces nothing. Whenever you add a consumer of "the current official run", route it through `canonical_evidence.resolve_official_computation` so the definition stays single.
- **Freezing must not cost drift detection.** Because the frozen copy cannot change, staleness is measured as frozen-versus-live (`RUN-E020`), and tampering with the frozen copy is a separate failure (`RUN-E021`). If you add another frozen artifact, add its drift check at the same time.
- Do not add a check whose only evidence is that someone asserted it. If it cannot be measured, it belongs in `REVIEW_REQUEST.md` as a named failure class for a human or a fresh-context reviewer.
- **A free-text field is not a check.** `alternatives_considered` was a string array whose only rule was "non-empty", so "I compared alternatives" was unfalsifiable. Structured `candidates` replaced it because a candidate can be tied to the runs that evaluated it. Apply the same test to anything new: what would make this claim wrong, and can a script see it?
- **No backward compatibility.** v0.6 rejects any contract whose `schema_version` is not `0.6.0`, and the repository keeps no migration scripts or historical design documents. An older workspace is re-initialised from its official files.

## Development

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-ci.txt
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
python3 -m compileall -q .agents/skills/cumcm-workflow/scripts tests
```

`tests/workflow_fixtures.py` holds synthetic contracts/approvals; `tests/recorder_fixtures.py` holds shared real-recorder setup. Import these helpers rather than another test class. Test files retain their regression cases; recorder, compile, and cross-competition tests may execute real subprocesses and LaTeX. Tool-dependent cases skip when tools are absent. CI invokes the full suite on Ubuntu/Python 3.10, Ubuntu/Python 3.13 with XeLaTeX/CTeX/Poppler installed, and native Windows/Python 3.13. The Windows job also runs compileall and JSON Schema validation; tool-dependent skips do not certify Windows PDF delivery.
