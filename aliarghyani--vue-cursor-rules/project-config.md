# Prompt Engineering Guide

## Rule Structure Basics

**Make rules specific and modular:**
- Keep full examples under ~4KB; link to longer versions when needed.
- Use clear section delimiters: `### Props`, `### Methods`, `### Examples`
- Start with role definition: "You are a Vue 3 expert specializing in..."
- Include 3-5 core rules as bullets
- Add chain-of-thought instruction for consistency

## Vue-Specific Patterns

**For composables:** Chain thoughts--plan reactivity first, then export:
```markdown
Think step-by-step: 1. Define reactive state 2. Create computed/methods 3. Return interface
```

**For components:** Structure before implementation:
```markdown
Think step-by-step: 1. Analyze props/emits 2. Plan template structure 3. Implement logic
```

## Utility Defaults

- For cross-cutting utilities (debounce/throttle, timers, event listeners, observers, etc.), prefer the matching helper from `@vueuse/core` instead of hand-written implementations.

## Type Resolution Workflow

When the agent or linting surfaces unresolved types (e.g., "Cannot use namespace 'User' as a type"):
- Look in the shared `types/` directory first; reuse exports from `types/index.ts` or sibling files.
- Prefer `import type { Foo } from '@/types'` (or alias `types/*`) over namespace or global references.
- If the type does not exist, define it in `types/`, export it, then update the calling code to use the shared import.
- Re-run the fix after updating imports to ensure the error clears instead of muting it with `any`.

## Before/After Examples

**Before (too vague):**
```markdown
Use composition API for components
```

**After (modular + sized):**
```markdown
# Role: You are a Vue 3 component expert
Core Rules:
- Always use `<script setup>` syntax
- Type props with `defineProps<T>()`
- Use `defineEmits<T>()` for events
- Prefer `ref()` for primitives, `reactive()` for objects

Think step-by-step: 1. Analyze component needs 2. Define interface 3. Implement logic
```

## Activation Patterns

- **File patterns:** `*.vue` for components, `**/composables/**` for composables
- **Context triggers:** Keywords like `pinia`, `router`, `test`
- **Refinement:** Test outputs and adjust globs for better targeting

## Testing Rules

Iterate by:
1. Create minimal rule
2. Test with real code
3. Refine based on AI outputs
4. Add examples only if needed
