# CLAUDE.md - Groundwork

## Copy standards (travel with every output)
- No em dashes, ever. Use commas, periods, or restructure.
- No AI language. If it wouldn't come out of your mouth, rewrite it.
- No contrast framing ("this isn't X, it's Y")
- No engagement bait or false suspense
- No therapy speak
- No "Best," sign-offs. Use "Best wishes" or "Thank you."
- No corporate or agency tone
- US English spelling and conventions
- Voice: builder-to-builder, direct, no fluff

## Build standards
- WCAG 2.2 AA on every view
- Color contrast checked on all text-on-background combinations
- Keyboard navigable throughout
- All form fields labeled with clear validation and error states
- Font loading: preload, font-display swap, fallback stack

## Stack
- Astro, Tailwind, Supabase, Netlify
- Supabase client in src/lib/supabase.ts
- Protected routes via middleware.ts
- Row-level security: users see only their own data

## Conventions
- No em dashes in any output, ever
- Stub files for phases not yet built, with clear comment noting which phase builds them
- Every response includes localhost preview URL
