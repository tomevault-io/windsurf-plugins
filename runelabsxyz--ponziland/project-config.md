# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PonziLand is a fully onchain, token-agnostic DeFi metagame built on Starknet. It's a multi-language project consisting of:
- Frontend: SvelteKit/TypeScript web application with widget-based UI
- Smart Contracts: Cairo contracts for Starknet blockchain using Dojo framework
- Backend: Rust-based indexer and meta-indexer services

## Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Enter development shell with all tools
nix develop

# Run database migrations
nix run .#migrate

# Create a new migration
nix run .#new-migration <migration_name>
```

## Common Development Commands

### Frontend (Client)
```bash
cd client

# Development
bun dev              # Local development
bun dev:sepolia      # Sepolia testnet
bun dev:mainnet      # Mainnet

# Building
bun build            # Standard build
bun build:sepolia    # Build for Sepolia
bun build:mainnet    # Build for Mainnet

# Testing
bun test             # Run tests
bun test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode

# Code Quality
bun run check        # Type check
bun run check:watch  # Type check in watch mode
bun prettier --write .   # Format code
bun prettier --check .   # Check formatting
```

### Smart Contracts (Dojo/Cairo)
```bash
cd contracts

# Local Development
katana --dev --dev.no-fee  # Start local blockchain
sozo build                 # Build contracts
sozo test                  # Run tests
# For deployment, ask the user for specific instructions

# Running local indexer
torii --world <WORLD_ADDRESS> --http.cors_origins "*"

# Code Quality
scarb fmt            # Format Cairo code
scarb fmt --check    # Check formatting
```

### Rust Backend
```bash
# Building
cargo build          # Build all crates
cargo build --bin indexer  # Build specific binary

# Code Quality
cargo fmt            # Format Rust code
cargo fmt --check    # Check formatting
cargo clippy         # Run linter

# Testing
cargo test           # Run tests
cargo nextest run    # Run tests with nextest (faster)
```

## Architecture Overview

### Widget System (Frontend)
The UI is built with a modular widget system that allows easy extension:
- Widgets live in `client/src/lib/components/widgets/`
- Each widget has its own directory with a `widget-<name>.svelte` file
- Register new widgets in `widget-provider.svelte` and `widget.config.ts`
- Use Svelte 5 runes for reactivity ($state, $derived, $effect)

### Smart Contract Structure (Dojo Framework)
- `/contracts/src/systems/` - Game actions (buy, claim, nuke, auction)
- `/contracts/src/models/` - Data models (land, auction)
- `/contracts/src/components/` - Reusable contract components
- Built with Dojo engine (https://book.dojoengine.org)
- All game logic is fully onchain using Cairo and Dojo framework

### Backend Services
- `crates/indexer` - Main indexing service that processes blockchain events
- `crates/chaindata` - Models and repository for blockchain data
- `crates/torii-ingester` - Ingests data from Torii (Dojo's indexer)
- Uses PostgreSQL for caching with read-heavy optimization

## Key Development Patterns

### Frontend Development
- Always use absolute imports from `$lib/`
- State management uses Svelte stores and runes
- Components should be typed with TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with the project's design system
- At the end of a modification batch / end of todolist Format the code
- The syntax class={['base-classes', { 'conditional-class': condition }]} is a clean, idiomatic way to handle conditional styling in Svelte.

#### Date Utilities
Use centralized date utilities from `$lib/utils/date` for consistent date formatting:

**Basic Date Formatting:**
- `formatDate(dateString)` - Full date with time (e.g., "Dec 2, 2024, 10:30 AM")
- `formatDateOnly(dateString)` - Date only (e.g., "Dec 2, 2024")
- `formatTimeOnly(dateString)` - Time only (e.g., "10:30 AM")

**Duration Formatting:**
- `formatDuration(startDate, endDate)` - Duration between dates (e.g., "2d", "3h", "45m")
- `formatDurationFromNow(startDate)` - Duration from start to now
- `parseNukeTime(timeInSeconds)` - Parse seconds into nuke time format string (e.g., "2d 3h 45m")
- `parseNukeTimeComponents(timeInSeconds)` - Parse seconds into object with `{days, hours, minutes, toString()}` for when individual components are needed
- `formatDurationHMS(durationInSeconds)` - Format as HH:MM:SS for countdown displays

**History & Timestamps:**
- `formatTimestamp(timestamp)` - Format as "YYYY/MM/DD at HH:MM"
- `formatTimestampRelative(timestamp)` - Relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago", "just now")

**Validation:**
- `isValidDate(dateString)` - Check if date string is valid

**Important:** Always import and use these utilities instead of creating duplicate date formatting functions in components. This ensures consistency across the entire application.

### Smart Contract Development
- Follow Dojo framework patterns for systems and models
- Use the existing components for common functionality (payable, taxes)
- Test contracts with `sozo test`
- Build with `sozo build`

### Rust Development
- Use SQLx for compile-time checked queries
- Follow the workspace structure for new crates
