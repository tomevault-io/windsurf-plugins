# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository hosts the pre-stable Beam Lean plugin, wrapper, and local broker tooling.

Treat the repo as public but still experimental: prefer conservative, well-tested changes over
feature sprawl.

Current public status and limitations live in [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md).
Compatibility policy lives in [docs/COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).
User setup lives in [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md). Exact MCP behavior lives in
[docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md), and exact sync/save/diagnostic behavior lives in
[docs/SYNC_AND_DIAGNOSTICS.md](docs/SYNC_AND_DIAGNOSTICS.md).

## Product Priorities

In order:

1. dead-simple public API
2. rock-solid stability
3. type-safe boundaries
4. isolation of each request
5. performance

Performance matters, but not at the cost of correctness or stability.

## Public API Guardrails

The core public request should remain conceptually:

- `runAt(pos, "lean text")`

Rules:

- no required public mode flag for command vs tactic execution
- backend selection is internal
- keep request and response structures small and typed
- use transport errors for invalid params, stale state, cancellation, and internal faults
- avoid exposing internal execution details unless a concrete client need forces it

Follow-up handle APIs exist, but they are pre-stable extensions around the basic request, not the main
story of the project.

## Execution Model

Each request should behave like an isolated sandbox:

- never mutate the document's real elaboration state
- never depend on side effects from a previous request
- never leak internal mutable state through the base API
- discard derived execution state unless the request explicitly stores a follow-up handle

## Testing Priorities

Tests matter more than cleverness.

Focus on:

- position selection and boundary behavior
- whitespace and comment positions
- proof-vs-command basis selection
- stale snapshot and file-changed behavior
- nested tactic cases
- no state leakage across requests
- cancellation behavior
- handle invalidation when handle behavior is touched

If a behavior is subtle, encode it in tests before optimizing it.

## Common Code Smells

- do not stringify typed errors or responses and later parse the rendered exception text to recover
  control flow; keep `Response`, `BrokerFailure`, or structured error data typed across
  async/pending boundaries, and stringify only at transport, CLI, or diagnostic display edges
- do not add useless backward compatibility support; this pre-stable project has no legacy users, so
  remove obsolete aliases, inferred envelope shapes, and compatibility branches unless they support
  an explicitly listed Lean/Rocq/tooling/protocol version or another target named in
  [docs/COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md)

## Skill Boundaries

Keep the Lean and Rocq skills fully separate.

- `lean-beam` must stay Lean-only and must not require Rocq setup or Rocq concepts
- `rocq-beam` must stay Rocq-only and must not require Lean-specific workflow guidance
- do not introduce a shared skill helper, common skill file, or mixed Lean/Rocq skill layer
- if a short instruction is needed in both skills, duplicate it instead of coupling the two skills

## Public Writing

Docs, skill text, and PR descriptions should be readable without local worktree history or private
review context.

- define project-specific terms before using them as shorthand
- name concrete commands, CI jobs, fixtures, or failure codes when making testing claims
- separate current behavior from unsupported cases, planned work, and safe follow-ups
- in agent-facing skill text, prefer exact commands, stop conditions, stdout/stderr behavior, and
  known stale-state recovery paths
- do not describe aspirational or planned MCP/CLI behavior as if it already exists

## Local Tooling

The repo includes:

- `lake exe beam-daemon`
- `lake exe beam-client`
- `lake exe beam-daemon-smoke-test`
- `lake exe beam-daemon-rocq-smoke-test`
- [scripts/lean-beam](scripts/lean-beam)
- [scripts/codex-harness.sh](scripts/codex-harness.sh)
- [scripts/codex-session-start.sh](scripts/codex-session-start.sh)
- [scripts/validate-defensive.sh](scripts/validate-defensive.sh)

The Codex harness scripts are maintainer workflow helpers for this repository. They are not part of
the public `lean-beam` API or the installed skill surface.

When working locally:

- start new Codex tasks from `./scripts/codex-harness.sh session start <task-id>` so the task runs
  in a dedicated git worktree instead of the primary checkout
- let the harness keep its default persistent worktree root under
  `<repo>/.codex-worktrees/lean-beam`; do not place long-lived task worktrees under `/tmp`
- keep destructive shell cleanup scoped to owned temp/worktree paths; do not use broad `rm` or
  `rm -rf` against repo-local `.beam`, install caches, or user homes as part of normal workflows
- for LSP request / handle / scenario changes, run `bash tests/test-lsp.sh`
- for Beam broker protocol / stream / barrier changes, run `bash tests/test-beam-fast.sh` first
- for Beam wrapper / install / bundle-resolution changes, also run `bash tests/test-beam-slow.sh`
