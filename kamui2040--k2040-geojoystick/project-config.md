# Repository Rules

## Project scope

GeoJoystick is an open-source Android mock-location utility for emulator and developer testing. Keep the project suitable for public collaboration and independent local builds.

## Product and safety constraints

- Keep the app ad-free, account-free, analytics-free, tracking-free, subscription-free, and free of mandatory proprietary services.
- Preserve Android's standard mock-location provider flow and manual Developer Options selection.
- Do not add concealment, integrity or attestation bypasses, anti-detection mechanisms, game/app-specific bypasses, account automation, ban evasion, root/Shizuku requirements, or other non-standard location injection.
- Treat external links and imported data as untrusted. Validate supported formats, coordinate ranges, schemes, redirects, bounds, and failure paths.
- Never substitute a real-world fallback coordinate when parsing or validation fails.
- Preserve OpenStreetMap attribution and keep network-dependent behavior optional and disclosed.

## Data and privacy

- Keep saved coordinates, favorites, settings, and other user state local unless a user explicitly invokes a documented export/import or network action.
- Never commit credentials, signing material, personal data, real location histories, device identifiers, machine-specific paths, or maintainer-only operational information.
- Use synthetic or deliberately sanitized fixtures and examples.

## Build and validation

- JDK 17 and Android SDK Platform 36 are the current build baseline.
- Use the repository build/bootstrap tooling; do not require a globally installed Gradle.
- Keep Linux, macOS, and Windows build instructions contributor-facing and machine-independent.
- Before a change is considered complete, inspect the changed-file scope and run applicable tests, lint, build checks, and `git diff --check`.
- Validation harnesses must verify configuration semantics rather than formatting-specific literals. For Gradle version gates, parse or syntax-tolerantly match `versionCode` and `versionName`; equivalent quote or whitespace styles must not be treated as a version change.
- Generated Android string resources must escape ASCII apostrophes using Android resource syntax, preserve NFC Unicode, and pass `tools/test_localization_resources.py` before build or commit gates.
- For device QA that changes network state, verify the effective transport state after mutation before judging offline behavior. A successful `svc`/settings command or a single settings key is not proof that all active network transports are disabled; if true offline state cannot be verified, treat the offline gate as pending rather than as an app failure.
- Keep source, build, runtime/device, signing, reproducibility, and publication evidence distinct.
- If an automated Android runtime-state detector disagrees with verified known-active manual behavior, treat the detector as invalid evidence. Stop detector retries, remove superseded detector logic, and report the affected automated gate as requiring manual acceptance unless a reliable app-owned debug interface exists.
- In RTL layouts, do not manually invert text glyphs that Android mirrors automatically. Validate directional controls and isolate mixed-direction numeric and legal tokens on a real RTL surface before acceptance.
- For manual pinch QA, judge anchoring only against the exact geographic point under the midpoint between the two active touches. A nearby off-centre landmark or the screen-centred `+`/`−` controls are not valid anchor references.
- Do not claim installation, physical-device behavior, signing, reproducibility, or release readiness without corresponding evidence.

## Contributions

- Keep `main` stable and prefer focused, reviewable changes.
- Multi-touch map gestures must derive every rendered center from one stable geographic pinch anchor and the live gesture midpoint. Do not repeatedly re-anchor from center state already mutated by asynchronous pointer events.
- Immediately before any GitHub issue or pull-request comment, review, metadata change, close, or merge mutation, verify the exact target number, title, state, base/head where applicable, and that it belongs to the current work unit. Do not mutate historical items while switching tools or testing an action.
- Before any GitHub write, verify that the operation type itself exactly matches the intended resource mutation. Commenting, assignment, issue metadata, pull-request metadata, review, close, and merge operations are not interchangeable; if the exact operation is unavailable or unclear, stop and resolve that mismatch instead of substituting another write.
- Do not probe repository write capability with placeholder mutations. Verify tool capability and repository state through discovery or read-only operations before any public or tracked write.
- Preflight generated handoff scripts by compiling the exact final file text. Avoid nesting the same triple-quote delimiter when embedding code or fixtures.
