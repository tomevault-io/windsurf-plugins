# Generated Frontend Guide

The CLI owns one shared React service UI under `adapters/ui`. Next copies the
contents of `adapters/ui/src` into its project root. TanStack UI copies the
TanStack headless base first and then overlays `adapters/ui` and its
framework-specific UI shell.

## Boundaries

- Build presentation data with `buildServicePageModel()` from
  `@lucid-agents/http`.
- Load the Agent Card and health through public HTTP handler contracts.
- Do not inspect `runtime.entrypoints`, `runtime.payments`, or
  `runtime.agent.config` from generated pages.
- Keep the shared endpoint-table component in `adapters/ui`.
- Keep only routing, request adaptation, document metadata, and providers in
  Next or TanStack overlays.
- TanStack headless remains API-only and must not receive the shared UI layer.
- `service-ui.config.ts` is the only generated user-editable visual config.
  Keep preset resolution, token validation, and shared CSS in the browser-safe
  `@lucid-agents/http/service-ui` subpath.
- Hono and Express storefronts are static/read-only. Do not add browser scripts,
  credential fields, or invoke controls to the portable renderer.
- Every renderer is read-only and consumes the same `ServicePageModel`. Do not
  add JSON editors, raw Agent Card dumps, wallet controls, or invoke clients to
  the generated public page.

## Testing

When changing generated UI:

```bash
bun test packages/cli/tests/cli.test.ts
bun run scripts/test-generated-project.ts next all
bun run scripts/test-generated-project.ts tanstack-ui console
```

The generated-project script packs current workspace packages before install.
Do not replace this with a test that resolves `latest` from npm.

Avoid tests tied to component internals. Assert the generated public contract,
user-visible states, accessible markup, and real generated application builds.

## Deployment overlays

Deployment assets are adapter/template overlays, not runtime-adapter behavior.
The first overlay applies only to `blank` + `hono` unless `--no-deploy` is
passed. It contributes `src/worker.ts`, `wrangler.jsonc`,
`lucid.deploy.json`, package scripts/dependencies, and an appended README
section while leaving `src/index.ts` unchanged.

Keep provider execution, environment allowlisting, redaction, confirmation,
and public-origin verification in `@lucid-agents/deploy`. Generated adapters
must continue delegating requests to the canonical HTTP runtime and must not
grow provider-specific paywalls or route registries.

## Scaffold safety

- Mark secret wizard inputs with `sensitive: true`; the interactive prompt
  suppresses terminal echo and does not render secret defaults.
- Keep generated `.env` files in the shared ignore policy for every adapter.
- Keep `template.json` prompts and `template.schema.json` aligned. The CLI
  validates resolved context and wizard values against the schema before it
  creates a staging directory.
- Preserve owner-only `0600` permissions on generated `.env` files.
- Build and optionally install in the staging directory. Do not write directly
  into the final target before validation succeeds.
- Reject `.` and other paths that resolve to the current working directory;
  atomic handoff requires a distinct target directory.
- Treat installation failure as scaffold failure. Do not report a partially
  installed project as successfully created.
- Test failures through `runCli()` and the generated filesystem rather than
  private copy or prompt helpers.
