# AGENTS.md — Parastore

Conventions and orientation for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor,
Codex, Aider, …) working in this repository. Human contributors should also
find it useful.

> **Helping an end user run parastore rather than modify the code?** See
> [`USAGE.md`](./USAGE.md) instead — it covers the wizard inputs, LLM
> call counts per persona size, supplemental-file conventions, and the
> silent-failure modes to coach the user through before triggering a

## What this project is

Parastore is an isometric 3D store-layout simulator with LLM-driven virtual
personas. See [`README.md`](./README.md) for the user-facing description and
local-run instructions; this file covers everything you need to make a clean
contribution.

## Repo layout

```
parastore/
  backend/   — Python 3.13+ FastAPI + LiteLLM + Instructor + pathfinding
  frontend/  — Vite + React 19 + R3F (Three.js) + Zustand + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui + Recharts
  scripts/   — dev/build helper scripts
```

Local run: `./scripts/dev.sh` (see README for prerequisites).

## Verification commands

Run these before claiming a change is done:

```bash
# Backend type check (strict mode — keep zero errors)
cd backend && uv run pyright src/

# Backend boot smoke
cd backend && uv run python -c "from store_emulator.server.main import app; print('OK')"

# Backend tests
cd backend && uv run pytest

# Frontend build (also runs tsc)
cd frontend && pnpm build

# Frontend lint
cd frontend && pnpm lint

# Frontend tests
cd frontend && pnpm test
```

## Backend architecture

Strict layered dependency direction:

```
domain ← engine ← application ← server
```

No reverse dependencies.

- **`domain/`** — pure data models (Pydantic) and `Protocol` definitions.
  No I/O, no prompts, no framework imports.
- **`engine/`** — implementations of `domain` Protocols. LLM pipelines,
  pathfinding, simulation engines.
- **`application/`** — use-case wiring, presets, storage.
- **`server/`** — FastAPI routers and schema conversion. The only layer
  that touches HTTP.

When in doubt about where new code belongs, ask "what is the lowest layer
that has all the imports I need?" and put it there.

## Backend code conventions (Python)

- `pyright` strict mode — keep zero errors.
- No `Any`. Repeated structural types live in `domain/types.py`
  (e.g. `Position`, `Shape`).
- No incomplete generics — write `dict[str, object]`, `list[int]`, etc.
- `type: ignore` only at third-party boundaries, with a comment explaining
  why.
- No abbreviated imports — use the full module path.
- When adding a dependency, pin a lower bound to the latest stable PyPI
  version in `backend/pyproject.toml`.
- Don't introduce wrapper classes or single-use utilities. If
  de-duplication hurts readability, allow the duplication.
- Logging uses module-level `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Log in
  English.

## Frontend code conventions

- TypeScript strict, ESLint with the React Compiler plugin enabled —
  `pnpm lint` clean.
- Routing: TanStack Router (`src/routes/`, code-split via
  `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — the snapshot ships a committed copy so a fresh
  `pnpm build` works without the dev plugin running first).
- Data fetching: TanStack Query against the FastAPI backend; mutations and
  queries colocated under `src/services/{queries,mutations}/`.
- State: Zustand stores in `src/stores/` (one store per concern — playback,
  simulation metrics, simulation lifecycle).
- Feature folders under `src/features/` are self-contained
  (`{dashboard,grid-editor,layouts,playback,setup,store-viewer}`); shared
  primitives go in `src/shared/`.
- 3D rendering uses React Three Fiber (`@react-three/fiber` + `drei`) with
  isometric camera; GLB assets live under `public/assets/{market,characters,ghost}/`
  and are mapped in `shared/utils/assetMap.ts`.
- UI: shadcn/ui + Radix primitives + Tailwind v4. Icons from
  `lucide-react`, charts from Recharts, Excel exports via `exceljs` /
  `xlsx`.

## i18n policy

User-facing surfaces (frontend UI, backend logs and errors, FastAPI OpenAPI
metadata) are **English-only**. Do not introduce new Korean string literals
at the frontend/backend contract boundary (dict keys, `===` comparisons,
route params) — they break silently at runtime even when the build passes.

Korean strings that remain in the codebase are intentional and confined to
LLM-internal sites; they never cross into the dashboard or any API
response. The categories are:

- **Prompt bodies / prompt-composing fragments** — the prompts were tuned
  in Korean by native speakers; rewriting them risks behavior regressions.
  Each prompt template carries a `## 언어` directive instructing the model
  to emit narrative output fields in English. Files involved:
  `engine/generators/persona.py`,
  `engine/simulation/engines/pattern_intent_impulse/{stage1_pattern,stage2_intent,stage3_impulse,prompt_utils}.py`,
  `application/supplemental.py`,
  `application/presets/behavior.py`,
  `domain/types.py` (`WEEKDAY_LABELS` — only consumed by prompt builders).
- **Korean Literal types** kept for backwards-compatible match sites:
  `domain/persona.py` (`Gender = Literal["남", "여"]`,
  `AgeGroup = Literal["10대", ...]`) and the matching comparison site in
  `frontend/src/shared/utils/assetMap.ts`.
