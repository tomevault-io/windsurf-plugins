# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agents working in this repository.

## Source of truth

Before making architecture claims, use these files:

- `docs/device-profile.md`
- `docs/hardware-verification.md`
- `docs/refactor-plan.md`
- `artifacts/probe-report.json` (historical pre-pull-firmware evidence)

The hardware is verified as a **4-slot** device, not a 7-slot carousel. The
current tracked pull firmware still requires a fresh physical probe after flash.

## Mental model

Treat this repo as a small publishing system for a monochrome ePaper target.

- **Firmware**: bitmap storage, display, buttons, HTTP pull client, diagnostic API
- **Host SDK**: capability discovery, safe slot operations
- **Scene pipeline**: providers -> scenes -> scheduler -> renderer -> device

Do not reintroduce the removed legacy fixed-page system unless explicitly asked.

## Verified constraints

- Resolution: `800x480`
- Format: `1-bit`
- Raw image bytes: `48000`
- Physical slots: `0..3`
- Tracked firmware is a deep-sleep HTTP client: timer wakes poll the host's `/content-hash` and `/content/slot-N`, persist changed slots, refresh, then sleep
- A 3-second right-button hold opens a 10-minute diagnostic window with `/status`, `/eventlog`, `/snapshot`, `/imageraw`, `/page`, and `/sleep`
- Slot names are neutral: `slot-0..slot-3`
- `snapshot` can return the exact stored raw bitmap for a loaded slot during diagnostic mode
- loaded slots persist to LittleFS across normal reboot/power cycle; host republish is still the recovery path after reflash, empty storage, or filesystem failure
- the host pull server is plain unauthenticated HTTP; keep it on a trusted LAN and enforce isolation outside the process
- on some macOS hosts, curl-based transport can be more reliable than Python `requests` for live device mutations
- all `ImageDraw.Draw` instances in render/provider code must set `draw.fontmode = "1"` immediately after construction — without it Pillow antialiases text into gray pixels that threshold to noise on 1-bit output

The checked-in `artifacts/probe-report.json` verifies the 4-slot hardware and the
older always-on firmware. It predates the tracked deep-sleep/pull refactor and
must not be cited as proof of the current diagnostic contract.

## Agent access quickstart

See `docs/access.md` before debugging connectivity or Python-path issues.
The Python project root is `python/`; from repo root, use
`env -u VIRTUAL_ENV uv --directory python run reterminal ...`.
USB serial is for logs/flashing only; status/snapshot/upload/page control is
HTTP over Wi-Fi after discovery.

## Core commands

```bash
cd python

uv run reterminal discover
uv run reterminal doctor
uv run reterminal status
uv run reterminal capabilities
uv run reterminal snapshot --png ./current.png
uv run reterminal probe
uv run reterminal publish --feed examples/agent-feed.json --preview ./previews
uv run reterminal publish --feed examples/agent-feed.json --preview ./previews --push --live
uv run reterminal publish --feed examples/kitchen-display.json --watch --live
```

## Decommissioned legacy commands

The old fixed-page `refresh` / `watch` CLI commands and `reterminal/pages/*` modules are gone. Use `reterminal publish` with provider manifests instead. `refresh.sh` is retained only as a decommissioning pointer.

## Design direction

Prefer these extension points:

- **providers** for Paperclip, local feeds, generated media, etc.
- **renderers/templates** for strong typography and layout
- **scheduler strategies** for slot rotation
- **device capabilities** for hardware-aware behavior

Avoid baking external integrations directly into firmware or into slot-specific host code.

## Safety rule

Preview first. Live device mutations should require explicit `--live` approval and should refuse `--non-interactive` mutation attempts. `publish --push` stages changed slots without changing the visible page unless `--show-slot` is explicit.

## When adding features

1. keep the device SDK small and truthful
2. put external system logic behind providers/adapters
3. keep scene data structured, not pre-rendered
4. make renderers responsible for visual composition
5. never assume more than 4 physical slots unless firmware changes and is re-probed

## Verification

For code changes, run targeted tests from `python/`:

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest -q
uv run --extra dev ruff check reterminal tests
