# mini-on-ai — Claude Operating Instructions

## What This Project Is

mini-on-ai is an AI-powered digital product factory running on a Mac mini.
It continuously generates, packages, and publishes small digital products to a public showcase website at `mini-on-ai.com`.

Products are sold via Gumroad ($9–$49). Visitors can also generate a custom product on-demand via the "Build Your Own" page (Stripe, $9).

## Quick Context Recovery

The memory system is the authoritative state source — read these in order:
1. `~/.claude/projects/-Users-minion-Dev-mini-on-factory/memory/factory_state.md` — products, commands, infrastructure
2. `~/.claude/projects/-Users-minion-Dev-mini-on-factory/memory/distribution_state.md` — channel status
3. `~/.claude/projects/-Users-minion-Dev-mini-on-factory/memory/scripts_manifest.md` — all scripts

Do NOT rely on `docs/current-state.md` — it is stale.

```

## Product Categories (all active)

- `prompt-packs` — 20–30 ready-to-use prompts
- `checklist` — structured action/decision list
- `swipe-file` — copy-ready examples
- `mini-guide` — concise practitioner guide
- `n8n-template` — ready-to-import automation workflow
- `claude-code-skill` — Claude Code skill configuration pack

## Pipeline

All scripts are Python 3. Orchestrated by `scripts/run_pipeline.py`.

```
run_pipeline.py
  → trend_scan.py       writes to data/idea-backlog.json
  → idea_rank.py        marks one idea as selected:true
  → generate_product.py writes to products/{id}/assets/
  → package_product.py  creates products/{id}/package.zip
  → update_site.py      updates site/ and data/product-catalog.json
  → telegram_notify.py  sends Telegram message
```

Triggered via `/run [seed]` in Telegram or the background daemon.

## Site Rebuilding

After any change to product data or templates:
```bash
python3 scripts/update_site.py --rebuild-all
```
This regenerates all 57+ product pages, index, and blog index. Then `git push` deploys to Cloudflare Pages.

## Cloudflare Workers

Two workers deployed (not in this repo, managed in Cloudflare dashboard):
- `worker/generate.js` — Build Your Own: generate (Anthropic Haiku) → Stripe checkout → ZIP download. Deployed as `mini-on-ai-generate`.
- `worker/subscribe.js` — Brevo subscribe proxy. Deployed as `mini-on-ai-subscribe`.

Both use `ALLOWED_ORIGIN = "https://mini-on-ai.com"` CORS. Secrets in CF environment.

## Conventions

- Product IDs: `{prefix}-{kebab-title}-{YYYYMMDD}` e.g. `prompts-marketing-hooks-20260312`
- All pipeline scripts are Python 3, no build step required
- Environment variables: see `.env.example`
- Never commit `.env` file
- Never explain the factory on the public website — products only
- After any edit: commit + push immediately (user preference)

## Active Workflow Skills

Read these at the start of the relevant task:

- `skills/pattern-detect.md` — at the start of any new planning session: scan git log for repeated patterns, propose up to 2 new skills
- `skills/sales-counsel.md` — when user asks about sales/distribution: fetch live data and give concrete next actions

## Environment Variables Required

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=         # Claude API
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=        # Telegram bot
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=          # Your Telegram chat
SITE_URL=                  # https://mini-on-ai.com
BREVO_SUBSCRIBE_URL=       # CF Worker URL for email subscribe
GUMROAD_API_TOKEN=         # Gumroad API
