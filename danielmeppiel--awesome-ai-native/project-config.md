# VSCode Agent Primitives

- VSCode already implements some Agent Primitives natively:

    - **Chat Modes**: Domain-specific chat behavior with `.chatmode.md` files. They have to be configured in the `.github/chatmodes/` directory. Each chat mode can have its own set of MCP tools and model configurations in the yaml frontmatter.
    - **Instructions Files**: Modular instructions for context-specific guidance with the general `copilot-instructions.md` in the `.github` folder and `.instructions.md` files including `applyTo` patterns in the `.github/instructions` folder. They are automatically loaded based on the agent's context.
    - **Prompt Files**: Reusable task templates with `.prompt.md` files in the `.github/prompts` folder. Can be summoned with `/prompt` command in chat

- Ensure you fetch related documentation from the [VSCode Copilot Customization Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization) using the `fetch` MCP tool.

- Our framework should build on the way VSCode implements Agent Primitives. 

- When sharing implementation examples, they should conform as much as possible to the VSCode native, supported Agent Primitives structure and default paths, using `.chatmode.md`, `.instructions.md`, and `.prompt.md` files as appropriate. 
    - IMPORTANT: However please note that in our framework we may extend to include more primitives or patterns that are not yet supported by VSCode natively. 
    - This is because we seek to build on top of what exists and yet push the boundaries of Agent Primitives to create a more powerful and flexible AI Native Development framework. This is frontier work.

- The site renders locally with jekyll at `http://localhost:4000/awesome-ai-native/`.
