# AI Assistant Memory Bank Rules

## Core Instruction
At the start of EVERY session, you MUST read the memory-bank files to understand project context. This is not optional - it's how we maintain continuity across AI memory resets.

## Memory Bank Location
The memory-bank directory is located at the root of this project:
```
project-root/
├── memory-bank/
│   ├── project.md      # What we're building
│   ├── current.md      # Current status  
│   ├── patterns.md     # Code standards
│   └── guidelines.md   # Detailed usage
├── [other project files]
```

## Required Reading Order
Read these 3 files at the start of each session:

1. **`memory-bank/project.md`** - Understand what we're building and tech stack
2. **`memory-bank/current.md`** - See current status and active tasks  
3. **`memory-bank/patterns.md`** - Learn established code patterns and standards

**Total reading time: 1-2 minutes**

## File Purposes
- **`project.md`** - Project goals, tech stack, setup, key decisions
- **`current.md`** - Active tasks, recent changes, immediate priorities  
- **`patterns.md`** - Code standards, architecture notes, reusable patterns
- **`guidelines.md`** - Detailed usage instructions (read if you need clarification)

## Workflow

### Before Starting Any Task
- Read all 3 core memory-bank files
- Understand current project status from `current.md` 
- Follow established patterns from `patterns.md`
- Make decisions consistent with architecture in `project.md`

### While Working
- Follow patterns established in `patterns.md`
- Stay focused on priorities listed in `current.md`
- Reference project context from `project.md`

### After Making Changes
- Update `current.md` with task progress
- Add new patterns to `patterns.md` if they're reusable
- Keep updates brief and actionable

## Update Guidelines
- **Immediate:** Update `current.md` when task status changes
- **As needed:** Update `patterns.md` when creating reusable code patterns  
- **Rarely:** Update `project.md` only when core project info changes

## Core Principle
The memory-bank maintains only essential project context. Every AI must read the core files at the start of each session to maintain continuity across memory resets.

**Keep it simple. Focus on what you actually need to know to continue development work effectively.**
