## Writing code

- **Minimal try/except**: let errors propagate — silent failures hide bugs. Only catch for intentional fault tolerance (retries, robustness).
- **Targeted comments**: don't explain your work process or reference old code. Use comments sparingly to clarify ambiguous logic or non-obvious constraints.
- **No "this replaced that" comments**: never write comments or docstrings that reference code that used to exist. That context belongs in the PR, not in the file. Describe what the code does now, not what it isn't anymore.

## Running code

- **Always use uv**: run code with `uv run`, never raw `python`.
- **Adding dependencies**: add to `pyproject.toml` and run `uv sync` (or `uv sync --group dev` for dev-only) to install and lock.

## Testing

- Run the suite with `uv run pytest tests/`.
- Write tests as plain functions; don't use class-based tests.
- **Conservative test additions**: don't add new tests unless the user asks or it's clearly necessary. Editing existing tests is fine.
- **Test what matters**: only test code with clear, isolated logic. If you need to patch everything to make it testable, it's probably not worth testing.

## Git

- **Branch prefixes**: use `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `tests/`.

## GitHub

- **Draft PRs**: always create PRs as drafts (`gh pr create --draft`) to avoid triggering CI unnecessarily.
- **PR titles**: start the title with a conventional-commit prefix matching the branch prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `tests:`), e.g. a `docs/...` branch gets a `docs: ...` title.
- **Pull requests**: do not include a "test plan" section unless you actually ran tests or the user explicitly asked for one.
