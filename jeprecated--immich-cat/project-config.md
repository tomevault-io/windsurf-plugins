# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is Immich Cat, an image categorization tool built with Elm that integrates with the Immich photo management system. It provides a keyboard-driven interface for efficiently categorizing and managing large photo collections.

## User Preferences

**Important Guidelines for Claude Code:**

- **Always create tests when possible** - Add comprehensive unit, integration, and fuzz tests for new functionality
- **Use direct Elm commands** - Run `elm make` and `elm-test` directly instead of npm scripts (npm commands only work in devbox shell)
- **Do not run the server** - The user will run the server, and usually is already doig so with elm-live
- **Refer to the Immich api docs** - https://immich.app/docs/api/
- **Use the example api return json files** - Located at `docs/immich-api/example-returns`
- **When finished:**
  - Play a sound when finished with `beepcomplete`
  - Format the code with `elm-format src/ --yes`

## Development Commands

### Compilation and Testing (Direct Commands)

```bash
# Compile the Elm application
elm make src/Main.elm --output dist/index.html

# Run all tests
elm-test

# Run tests with specific seed for reproducible results
elm-test --seed 12345
```

## Architecture

### Frontend (Elm)

- **Entry Point:** `src/Main.elm` - Main application using Elm Architecture (Model-View-Update)
- **API Integration:** `src/Immich.elm` - Refactored with generic HTTP request builders and minimal duplication
- **Utilities:** `src/Helpers.elm` - Common utility functions
- **Key Bindings:** `src/KeybindingGenerator.elm` - Smart keybinding generation with conflict resolution
- **UI Framework:** elm-ui for layout and styling

### Key Features

- **Keyboard-driven navigation** - Normal/Insert modes similar to Vim with pagination support
- **Real-time image/video viewing** - Custom web components with authenticated asset loading
- **Album management** - Asset categorization with automatic count tracking
- **Smart keybinding system** - Conflict-free album shortcuts with fuzzy matching
- **Search capabilities** - Fuzzy search for albums and smart asset search
- **Batch operations** - Favorites, archives, deletions with proper state management
- **Asset preloading** - Intelligent caching system for smooth navigation
- **External integration** - 'K' keybinding to open assets in Immich web interface

### Custom Web Components

The application uses custom elements defined in `src/index.html`:

- `image-from-api` - Handles authenticated image loading from Immich with preloading
- `video-from-api` - Handles authenticated video playback with selective preloading
- Both create blob URLs for secure asset access and implement caching

### Environment Configuration (Secure)

- **Development:** Custom Node.js proxy server injects environment variables in-memory only
- **Security:** API keys never written to any files on disk
- **Runtime injection:** Environment variables passed via `window.ENV` at request time
- **Configuration:** Development environment variables loaded from `.env` file

### Development Security Features

- ✅ Zero secret persistence - API keys stay in memory only
- ✅ In-memory injection - Variables loaded at HTTP request time
- ✅ Clean builds - Production artifacts contain no embedded secrets
- ✅ Development safety - Shows first 5 characters of API key for verification

```

## Development Notes

### Core Technologies

- **Elm 0.19.1** with functional programming patterns and strong typing
- **Hot reloading** provided by elm-live proxied through secure development server
- **Elm Architecture** pattern for predictable state management
- **elm-ui** for declarative layout and styling

### Architecture Patterns

- **Generic HTTP builders** - Centralized request handling with ~70% code reduction
- **PropertyChange tracking** - Optimistic UI updates with backend synchronization
- **Smart keybinding system** - Conflict-free album shortcuts with prefix detection
- **Pagination state management** - Screen-height-aware pagination with vim-style navigation
