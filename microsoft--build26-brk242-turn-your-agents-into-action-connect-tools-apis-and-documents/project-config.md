This is a Microsoft Build 2026 session content repository.

This repo has been finalized for publication. When helping with updates, keep changes attendee-facing and preserve the existing structure in `/docs` and `/src`.

Key constraints:
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials. Use environment variables.
- Do not modify LICENSE, LICENSE-DOCS, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, or SECURITY.md.
- Do not add large binary files (PowerPoint, video, recordings) to the repo. Links are fine.
- Use the Microsoft Learn MCP Server (configured in .vscode/mcp.json) to find relevant learn.microsoft.com links when populating resource sections.

### Issue Support
If a user asks for help filing an issue, or reports a problem:
- Check `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` to discover available issue templates
- If templates exist, match the user's request to the best-fit template and walk them through the fields
- If no templates exist, create a plain issue with a clear title and description
- Check `gh label list` for available labels and apply relevant ones
- Do not hardcode template names or labels — always discover what's available at runtime
