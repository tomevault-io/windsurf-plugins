## What this project is

seLe4n is a production-oriented microkernel written in Lean 4 with machine-checked
proofs, improving on seL4 architecture. Every kernel transition is an executable
pure function with zero `sorry`/`axiom`. First hardware target: Raspberry Pi 5.
Lean 4.28.0 toolchain, Lake build system, version 0.33.52.

> The version line above is one of the version sites that
> `scripts/check_version_sync.sh` (a Tier 0 gate, also run by the
> pre-commit hook) holds equal to `lakefile.toml`. When you bump
> `lakefile.toml` you must bump every site in the same PR — see the
> **Versioning policy** section below. Keep this sentence on a single
> line with the canonical trigger phrase (`Lake build system, version
> <x.y.z>`) intact: the verifier greps for the literal phrase on one
> line, so do not reword it or split it across a wrap.

## Versioning policy (every PR bumps the patch version)

**Every PR bumps the patch version and updates all version locations.**
There is no "release cut" accumulation under an `Unreleased` heading —
each merged PR ships its own `vX.Y.Z` and the docs always reflect the
live version.

- **Canonical source:** the `version` field in `lakefile.toml`. Every
  other site must equal it.
- **Bump in one step:** run `./scripts/bump_version.sh <new-version>`
  (e.g. `./scripts/bump_version.sh 0.31.11`). It rewrites every site
  listed in `scripts/version_locations.sh`, then self-verifies. Add a
  matching `## v<new-version> — <summary>` entry at the top of
  `CHANGELOG.md` by hand (the bumper reminds you).
- **Enforcement (sync gate):** `scripts/check_version_sync.sh` verifies
  that all sites equal `lakefile.toml`. It runs as a Tier 0 hygiene gate
  (CI, on every PR and push) and from the pre-commit hook (whenever a
  version-bearing file is staged), so a bump that forgets a location is
  a hard failure, never a silent drift. There is deliberately **no**
  force-bump (increment-vs-`main`) gate, so automated contributors
  (e.g. dependabot) are never blocked.
- **The version sites** (authoritative list in
  `scripts/version_locations.sh`): `lakefile.toml`; the four `sele4n-*`
  crates in `rust/Cargo.toml` / `rust/Cargo.lock`; `KERNEL_VERSION` in
  `rust/sele4n-hal/src/boot.rs`; `docs/spec/SELE4N_SPEC.md`; `CLAUDE.md`
  + `AGENTS.md`; the root `README.md` badge + `Version` row; the eleven
  `docs/i18n/*/README.md` badges (+ the `de` / `fr` `Version` rows); the
  GitBook `README.md`, `navigation_manifest.json`, and
  `05-specification-and-roadmap.md`; and `docs/codebase_map.json`.
- **Adding a site:** register it once in
  `scripts/version_locations.sh` — both the verifier and the bumper pick
  it up automatically.
- **Not version sites (never auto-bumped):** historical prose such as
  `CHANGELOG.md` headers, "LANDED at vX.Y.Z" / "Version bumped A → B"
  notes, the Lean toolchain version (`4.28.0`), and audit-document
  filenames (`AUDIT_v0.30.6_*`).

## Build and run

```bash
# Environment setup (runs automatically via SessionStart hook — no build)
./scripts/setup_lean_env.sh --skip-test-deps

# Full setup including test dependencies (shellcheck, ripgrep)
./scripts/setup_lean_env.sh

# Manual build (run separately after setup)
source ~/.elan/env && lake build

# Run executable trace harness
lake exe sele4n
```

## Validation commands (tiered)

```bash
./scripts/test_fast.sh      # Tier 0+1: hygiene + build
./scripts/test_smoke.sh     # Tier 0-2: + trace + negative-state
./scripts/test_full.sh      # Tier 0-3: + invariant surface anchors
NIGHTLY_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 ./scripts/test_nightly.sh  # Tier 0-4
```

Run at least `test_smoke.sh` before any PR. Run `test_full.sh` when changing
theorems, invariants, or documentation anchors.

## Module build verification (mandatory)

**Before committing any `.lean` file**, you MUST verify that the specific
module compiles:

```bash
source ~/.elan/env && lake build <Module.Path>
```

For example, after editing `SeLe4n/Kernel/RobinHood/Bridge.lean`:

```bash
lake build SeLe4n.Kernel.RobinHood.Bridge
```

**`lake build` (default target) is NOT sufficient.** The default target only
builds modules reachable from `Main.lean` and the test executables. Modules
not yet imported by the main kernel will silently pass `lake build` even
with broken proofs.

A pre-commit hook enforces this automatically. Install with
`./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh` (invoked automatically by
`setup_lean_env.sh` and by the Lean Action CI workflow, so fresh clones
and CI checkouts are guarded without manual action). For CI contexts:

```bash
./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh          # install (idempotent no-op if present)
./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh --check  # verify installation (non-zero if absent)
./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh --force  # overwrite; backs up any diverging hook
```

The hook detects staged `.lean` files, builds each modified module, checks
for `sorry` in staged content, and **blocks the commit** if any build fails
