# Rule: Code Dependency and Impact Analysis

## Context
This rule applies whenever a function (its signature, or implementation that affects callers) or a global/widely-used variable (its name, type, or how it's used) is modified.

## Instructions
When modifying functions or variables that might be used elsewhere in the codebase, it is crucial to identify and update all dependent code to maintain consistency and prevent errors.

1.  **Identify the Scope of Change**:
    *   Clearly understand what has changed:
        *   For functions: Is it the name, return type, number/type of parameters, or core behavior that impacts how it's called or what it returns?
        *   For variables: Is it the name, data type, scope, or the way its value is set/interpreted?

2.  **Locate All Usages/Dependencies**:
    *   Use codebase search tools (e.g., semantic search, grep/text search provided by `default_api.codebase_search` or `default_api.grep_search`) to find all instances where the modified function is called or the variable is accessed.
    *   Pay attention to:
        *   Direct function calls.
        *   Assignments to/from the variable.
        *   Use of the variable in expressions or conditional logic.
        *   Function pointers or other indirect references if applicable (especially in C projects).

3.  **Update Dependent Code**:
    *   For each identified usage, propose changes using the `edit_file` tool to align with the modifications made to the original function or variable.
    *   If a function's parameters changed, update the arguments in all calls.
    *   If a variable's name or type changed, update all references accordingly.
    *   If the *meaning* or *behavior* of a function/variable changed, ensure the calling/using code still operates correctly with the new behavior. This might involve more than just syntax changes and require careful logical adjustments.

4.  **Consider Indirect Impacts**:
    *   Think about whether the change could affect other parts of the system indirectly. For example:
        *   If a function now returns values in a different range or format, any logic that depends on the old range/format needs to be updated.
        *   If a variable's change affects program state, consider how this impacts other modules that rely on that state.
        *   Changes in data structures returned by functions or pointed to by variables also require updates in all code that accesses members of that structure.

5.  **Header File Consistency**:
    *   If a function signature or global variable declaration in a header file (e.g., `my_module.h`) is changed, ensure this header file is correctly updated.
    *   Remember that changes in a header file can affect all `.c` files that include it.
    *   Refer to `[project_guidance_tc26b.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project_guidance_tc26b.mdc)` and `[new_header_inclusion_rule.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/new_header_inclusion_rule.mdc)` for guidelines on header file management, especially concerning `[libraries/zf_common/zf_common_headfile.h](mdc:libraries/zf_common/zf_common_headfile.h)` if relevant.

6.  **Verification (Recommended)**:
    *   After making changes, if compilation tools or linters are available through the environment, suggest running them to catch syntax errors or type mismatches.
    *   Advise the user to thoroughly review the proposed changes and test the affected functionality to ensure correctness, as automated updates might not always capture all nuances of the required logic changes.

## Example Scenario:

Suppose a function `int32_t process_data(int32_t input_val)` in `user/data_processor.c` (declared in `user/data_processor.h`) is changed to `float32_t process_data(int32_t input_val, float32_t scale_factor)`.

1.  **Change Identified**: Function signature changed (return type from `int32_t` to `float32_t`, added `scale_factor` parameter of type `float32_t`).
2.  **Update Declaration**: Modify `user/data_processor.h`:
    ```c
    // Old:
    // int32_t process_data(int32_t input_val);
    // New:
    float32_t process_data(int32_t input_val, float32_t scale_factor);
    ```
3.  **Locate Usages**: Search the project for `process_data(`.
4.  **Update Call Sites**: If `user/main_logic.c` had:
    ```c
    #include "data_processor.h" // Assuming it includes the header
    // ...
    int32_t raw_data = 100;
    int32_t processed_result = process_data(raw_data);
    // use processed_result as int32_t
    ```
    It needs to be updated. For example:
    ```c
    #include "data_processor.h"
    // ...
    int32_t raw_data = 100;
    float32_t scale = 0.5f;
    float32_t processed_result_float = process_data(raw_data, scale);
    // use processed_result_float as float32_t, adjust subsequent logic
    ```
5.  **Indirect Impacts**: Any code in `user/main_logic.c` that used `processed_result` as an `int32_t` (e.g., for array indexing, integer arithmetic, bitwise operations) must be reviewed and potentially modified to correctly handle a `float32_t`.

## Importance
Neglecting to update all dependent code can lead to:
*   Compilation errors (often the easiest to catch).
