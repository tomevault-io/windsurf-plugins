# Performance Playbook

When you discover a new performance improvement, optimization pattern, or fix a performance regression, add a concise bullet to the relevant section below in the same session.

## Rendering strategy

- Avoid `headers()` / `cookies()` in server components that can be static — they force dynamic rendering on every request
- Use ISR (`export const revalidate = N`) with `unstable_cache` for pages that don't need per-request freshness
- Create a separate headerless RPC client for public endpoints so server components aren't forced dynamic

## Client/server split

- Default to server components — only add `"use client"` for interactivity that truly needs it
- Split large client components into a server shell + small client islands (timestamp, chart, toggle)
- Use `@phosphor-icons/react/ssr` for icons in server components instead of pulling in the client bundle
- Lazy-load heavy client components with `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })`

## Caching layers

- **In-process**: `lru-cache` (Map + TTL) in front of Redis — eliminates network round-trip on hot paths, sub-millisecond reads
- Use `NULL_SENTINEL` pattern (`Object.freeze({ __null: true })`) to cache negative lookups in LRU — avoids repeated Redis/DB calls for non-existent keys
- Cache pure CPU work (UA parsing, bot detection, ETag hashing, geo lookups) in LRU — these repeat with the same inputs across requests
- Cache dedup/idempotency results in LRU — once a write is known to be a no-op (e.g. click already recorded), skip the Redis check entirely on repeat calls
- **Next.js layer**: `unstable_cache` with `revalidate` and `tags` for page-level data
- **API layer**: Redis `cacheable` wrapper with `staleWhileRevalidate` to absorb concurrent requests
- **CDN layer**: `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=N, stale-while-revalidate=M` headers for edge caching
- Stack all four — in-process > Redis > DB on the API side, CDN in front of everything
- `@elysiajs/cors` with `origin: true` sets `Vary: *` which prevents CDN caching — override with `set.headers.vary = "Origin"` on cacheable endpoints

## API middleware

- Skip expensive middleware for routes that don't need it — `applyAuthWideEvent` does a session DB lookup on every request; skip it for anonymous `/public/` routes via URL check in `onBeforeHandle`
- Use `@elysiajs/server-timing` to profile per-phase durations (CORS, beforeHandle, handle, afterHandle) without manual instrumentation
- Elysia's JIT compiler is on by default (`precompile: true`) — no extra config needed

## Database queries

- Add time-bound filters to ClickHouse queries (e.g. `AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY`) to avoid full table scans
- Combine sequential Postgres queries into a single JOIN when fetching related data
- Use `Promise.all` for independent queries that can run in parallel

## Frontend rendering

- Use `Map` for O(1) lookups instead of `Array.find()` inside loops
- Skip rendering expensive wrappers (e.g. `Tooltip`, `TooltipProvider`) when not needed — check a boolean prop first
- Use `useMemo` for derived data that's expensive to compute from props

## Layout shift prevention

- Derive loading booleans from query state instead of managing with `useState`/`useEffect` — e.g. `allItems.length === 0 && (isPending || isFetching)` instead of a manually toggled `isInitialLoad` flag
- Show `Skeleton` placeholders at the exact dimensions of real content for data-dependent cells — never render text that changes (e.g. "Unknown" → "Operational")
- Use `min-h-*` on containers whose content loads asynchronously to reserve stable space
- Avoid conditional banners/bars that insert/remove height — fold the info into existing UI (header buttons, stat rows) instead
- Loading skeletons should structurally match the real page: same sections, same heights, same padding — include placeholders for dynamically loaded chunks (e.g. `LatencyChartChunkPlaceholder`)

## Perceived performance

- Add `loading.tsx` skeletons for routes that may take time to generate
- Use `router.refresh()` with a countdown for auto-refresh instead of full page reloads
- Gate skeleton → page transition on the fastest critical query, then show inline skeletons for remaining data — avoids blocking on the slowest query while preventing staggered pop-in
