when using 'text-right', always add 'text-balance' so its not ugly

When working on anything, try to split off components, utils, anything reusable to ensure better loading speed and less complexity

LESS COMPLEXITY IS BETTER, the fewer lines, the less complex logic the better

Naming convention is lower-case-like-this

Think about mobile responsiveness when doing any UI tasks or changes

NEVER add placeholders, mock data, or anything similar

Always use rounded, not rounded-xl or rounded-md, always rounded

ALWAYS use bun, never npm, never pnpm, just bun

Don't use lucide for icons, ONLY use phosphor icons, use width="duotone" for most, but for arrows use fill, for plus icons don't add width

Handle complex data transformations independently of React.
Keep these modules decoupled from React for improved modularity and testability.
View Components:

Decouple state management, data transformations, and API interactions from the React lifecycle.
Simplify data flow to eliminate prop drilling and callback hell.
Prioritize modularity and testability in all components.

ALWAYS use error boundaries properly

Use Dayjs NEVER date-fns, and Tanstack query for hooks, NEVER SWR

use Icon at the end of phosphor react icons, like CaretIcon not Caret AND THATS THE DEFAULT IMPORT, NOT AS

use json.stringify() when adding debugging

Almost NEVER use useEffect unless it's critical

do NOT use types any, unknown or never, use proper explicit types

Suffix functions with Action in types, like type Test = { testAction }

Never use barrel exports or create index files
