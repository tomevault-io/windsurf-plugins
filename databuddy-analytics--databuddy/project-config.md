# Rust Safety Rules for LLM

## Rule Set Format
Each rule follows the structure
Issue
Example
Reason

## Rules

Issue
Using unwrap
Example
`let x = value.unwrap()`
Reason
Unwrap causes an instant panic if the value is missing. This can crash services in production.

Issue
Using expect everywhere
Example
`config.expect("it should exist")`
Reason
Expect still panics. It must only be used when failure is impossible such as during startup.

Issue
Using panic in normal logic
Example
`panic("unexpected state")`
Reason
Panic kills the whole process. This removes all stability guarantees.

Issue
Ignoring return values
Example
`some_func()` without handling the result
Reason
Ignoring errors counters Rusts guarantees. Failures become silent and hard to debug.

Issue
Using clone to avoid ownership problems
Example
`let data2 = data.clone()`
Reason
Cloning large values causes heavy performance drops and unexpected memory use.

Issue
Using to_string everywhere
Example
`value.to_string()` repeatedly
Reason
Unnecessary allocations. Strings are expensive and should be avoided when possible.

Issue
Blocking inside async code
Example
`sleep` inside a Tokio async handler
Reason
This freezes the executor and stalls the entire service.

Issue
Using blocking IO in async
Example
`std::fs::read` inside async
Reason
Blocking the executor stops all other tasks. Use async alternatives.

Issue
Spawning untracked tasks
Example
`tokio::spawn(task())` without storing the handle
Reason
Tasks leak. Memory grows until the service crashes.

Issue
Global mutable state
Example
`static mut COUNTER: i32`
Reason
Race conditions and undefined behavior. Global state must use safe abstractions.

Issue
Random unsafe blocks
Example
Raw pointer writes without justification
Reason
Unsafe disables compiler guarantees. Each block must be proven correct.

Issue
Silent numeric conversions
Example
`let x: u8 = num.try_into()?`
Reason
Overflow errors appear only with certain inputs. Must be handled explicitly.

Issue
Catch all match arms
Example
`_ => {}`
Reason
Hides new enum variants and removes compile time checks.

Issue
Unbounded channels
Example
Unbounded MPSC channels in high load systems
Reason
Messages queue forever and cause memory explosions.

Issue
Building strings in loops
Example
Repeated string concatenation
Reason
Excessive allocations slow down the system.

Issue
Moving large data instead of borrowing
Example
Returning huge structures by value
Reason
Unneeded copies waste memory and CPU.
