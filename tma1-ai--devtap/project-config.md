# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Build
go build ./cmd/devtap

# Test (unit only)
go test ./...

# Test with race detection (as CI runs)
go test ./... -race -count=1

# Run a single test
go test ./internal/store/file/ -run TestDrain

# Integration tests (requires local GreptimeDB on gRPC :4001, MySQL :4002)
go test -tags=integration ./internal/store/greptimedb/

# Lint
golangci-lint run ./...
```

## Architecture

devtap captures stdout/stderr from build/dev commands and delivers them to AI coding tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol).

### Data Flow

```
devtap -- <cmd>  →  capture (runner/longrun)  →  store.Write()  →  fan-out to all adapters
AI tool          ←  MCP server (get_build_errors) ←  store.Drain()  ←  per-adapter queue
```

### Core Interfaces

**Store** (`internal/store/store.go`): Write/Drain/Status/Close. Two backends:
- **File** (default): JSONL at `~/.devtap/<session>/<adapter>/pending.jsonl`, atomic rename for IPC
- **GreptimeDB** (optional): SQL queries + watermark cursor, `tag` is a reserved keyword and must be backtick-quoted in all SQL

**Adapter** (`internal/adapter/adapter.go`): Name/DiscoverSessions/Install. Five implementations:
- **claudecode**: `.mcp.json` + optional Stop hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **codex**: `.codex/config.toml`
- **opencode**: `opencode.json`
- **gemini**: `.gemini/settings.json`
- **aider**: lint wrapper script (no MCP)

### Key Patterns

- **Multi-adapter fan-out**: Writers discover adapters via `store.DiscoverAdapters()`, write to all. Each tool drains independently.
- **Multi-source drain**: MCP server and drain command can read from up to 2 sources (local + configured remote). `resolveDrainSources()` in `cmd/devtap/storefactory.go` resolves sources and deduplicates when (backend, session) match. Messages are merged, deduplicated via `mcp.DedupMessages()`, and labeled with `[host session]` prefix in multi-source mode.
- **Drain budget unit**: `Store.Drain(sessionID, maxLines)` treats `maxLines` as a **message count** (not line count). The multi-source loop tracks remaining budget in messages. Line-level truncation is a separate pass via `mcp.TruncateMessages()`.
- **Host field**: `LogMessage.Host` is set via cached `os.Hostname()` at capture startup. Used for multi-source origin labeling. GreptimeDB uses `COALESCE(host, '')` for backward compat with pre-existing rows.
- **File store IPC**: `pending.jsonl` → atomic rename to `pending.jsonl.draining` → read → delete. Leftover lines written back to prevent data loss.
- **Config merge**: `.mcp.json` / `settings.json` / `opencode.json` reads existing → upserts devtap entry → writes back. Never overwrites other tools' config.
- **Instruction injection**: Appends `<!-- devtap:start -->
## devtap

devtap captures build/dev output from a separate terminal and delivers it here via MCP.

**You MUST check devtap in these situations:**
- At the start of each new task or conversation turn
- Before writing or editing any code
- After being told that a build, test, or dev server has new output

**Use this call order:**
1. Call "get_build_status" once at the start of the turn.
2. Call "get_build_errors" when status reports pending messages, when the user says new output arrived, or before the first code edit in the turn.

**Call limit per turn:** call "get_build_errors" at most once per turn unless new output is reported.

**Multi-source mode:** when devtap drains from multiple sources, tags are prefixed with "host/label |" (for example, "[devtap: myhost/local | make]"). "host" is the machine name, "label" identifies the source. Show these prefixes as-is. If output includes source warnings (for example, source unreachable), show those warnings verbatim and continue with output from reachable sources.

**Output format:** when "get_build_errors" returns content:
If build succeeded, acknowledge briefly (do not repeat the output).
If build failed, present the error output verbatim in a fenced code block.
Then add one line: "Next action: <what you will do>".
<!-- devtap:end -->` block to project instruction files. Idempotent via marker detection.
- **Session encoding**: `session.EncodeDir("/foo/bar")` → `"-foo-bar"`, shared across adapters.
- **Capture modes**: `runner.go` (batch, flush every 50 lines) vs `longrun.go` (debounce timer, for dev servers).
- **Scanner buffers**: 64KB initial / 1MB max (`internal/capture/errors.go`). On scanner error (line >1MB), pipe is drained to discard to prevent child process deadlock.
- **Line-level truncation**: `mcp.TruncateMessages()` allocates line budget proportionally across messages. Applied in both MCP server and drain command after all sources are drained.

### GreptimeDB Specifics

- Composite `PRIMARY KEY (session_id, \`tag\`, stream, adapter)` clause (not inline per-column)
- `TIMESTAMP(6)` microsecond precision to avoid PK collisions
- `append_mode=true` allows duplicate PKs
- `host STRING` column added via `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` (silently ignores error if column already exists). Not a TAG column — TAG columns are part of the primary key and cannot be added via ALTER TABLE.
