description: Adaptive learning pack: pattern detection, rule suggestions, noise reduction — auto-populated from learning patterns
---


# Adaptive Learning Pack

Post-review intelligence layer that detects recurring patterns, suggests pack rules, and suppresses noise.

Runs as a **passive intelligence layer** inside `/temper:review` (Step 8.5) and `/temper:status` (dashboard section). All learning state lives in `.temper/learning.json`.

## Pattern Detection Algorithm

```
1. CLUSTER findings by (category, file_path_pattern, description_keywords)
2. MATCH each cluster against learning.json detected_patterns:
   - If pattern exists: increment total_shown, update counts
   - If new AND count >= 2: create new detected pattern entry
3. EVALUATE per-pattern statistics:
   - acceptance_rate = accepted / total_shown
   - dismissal_rate = dismissed / total_shown
```

## Promotion Criteria

When a detected pattern meets these thresholds, generate a rule template:

| Criterion | Threshold | Suggested Severity |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Accepted >= 3 AND acceptance_rate >= 70% | Met | WARN |
| Accepted >= 5 AND acceptance_rate >= 80% | Met | BLOCK (security/architecture only) |

On promotion:
1. Rule template written to `.temper/learning/suggestions/{pattern_id}.md`
2. Entry added to `suggestion_queue[]` in learning.json
3. Status dashboard shows the pending suggestion

## Suppression Criteria (Noise Reduction)

| Criterion | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Dismissed >= 3 AND acceptance_rate < 30% | Met | Downgrade severity by 1 level |
| Dismissed >= 5 AND acceptance_rate < 10% | Met | Auto-suppress entirely |

Suppressed patterns move to `suppressed_patterns[]` in learning.json. Future reviews skip suppressed patterns entirely.

## Context-Specific Handling

Context-specific dismissals are tracked independently per pattern. A pattern suppressed in one context continues to fire in others.

| Context | Detection | Behavior |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| config-loader | Path contains `config/` | Independent suppression |
| test-fixtures | Path contains `test/`, `spec/` | Independent suppression |
| data-transfer | Class has `DTO`, `Request`, `Response` | Independent suppression |
| legacy-module | Listed in `.temper/legacy-modules.json` | Independent suppression |
| generated-code | Header has `@generated` | Independent suppression |

## Learning Curve Calculation

```
1. Read issues_per_review from metrics history
2. Compute trend:
   - Last 5 reviews: compute linear regression slope
   - Slope < -0.5 → "improving"
   - Slope between -0.5 and 0.5 → "stable"
   - Slope > 0.5 → "degrading"
   - Fewer than 3 reviews → "insufficient_data"
3. improvement_pct:
   (first_review_issues - last_review_issues) / first_review_issues * 100
```

## Integration Points

| System | Direction | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `/temper:review` (Step 8.5) | Inbound | Post-review pattern detection trigger |
| `/temper:status` | Inbound | Dashboard rendering |
| `review-memory.json` | Inbound | Pattern history for clustering |
| Pack system | Outbound | Promoted rule templates |
| review Step 4 | Outbound | Noise filter lookup |

## Graceful Degradation

When `learning.json` does not exist:
1. Review skips Step 8.5 entirely — no errors, no warnings
2. Status shows "Adaptive learning: not yet initialized"
3. All existing commands work exactly as before
4. `learning.json` created automatically on first review run

## Rule Template Format

Promoted patterns generate rule templates in `.temper/learning/suggestions/{pattern_id}.md`:

```markdown
## {Rule Name}

**Severity:** {BLOCK|WARN|SUGGEST}
**Category:** {category}
**Detection:** {file glob} + description keywords: {keywords}
**Auto-generated from learning pattern:** {pattern_id}

### Description
{What the rule catches}

### Detection Pattern
- File pattern: `{file_pattern}`
- Keywords: {description_keywords}
- Acceptance rate: {acceptance_rate} ({accepted}/{total_shown})

### Suggested Action
{Description of what to do when this pattern is found}
```
