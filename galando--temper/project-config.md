# Git Pack

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-03-09

## Quality Rules (WARN if violated)
- Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits format
- Commits should be atomic (one logical change per commit)
- Never commit directly to main/master branch
- Branch names should be descriptive: feature/{ticket}-{description}

## Conventions (SUGGEST improvements)
- Include ticket/issue reference in commit message body
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write commit body explaining WHY, not WHAT
- Delete branches after merging
