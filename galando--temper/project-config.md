# Context Engineering

Load the right information, in the right order, at the right time. Maximize signal per token.

For the full context loading strategy, apply the `.claude/skills/context-engineering/SKILL.md` definitions:
- Priority: rules -> arch -> source -> errors -> conversation
- Budget: under 2K lines per task
- 6-step process: determine scope -> load rules -> load architecture -> load source -> load errors -> defer everything else

Apply these rules at the start of every Temper stage.
