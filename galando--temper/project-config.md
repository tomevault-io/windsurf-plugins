# Source-Driven Development

Write framework-specific code against current official documentation, not stale training data.

For the full source-driven process, apply the `.claude/skills/source-driven-development/SKILL.md` definitions:
- Detect version -> Fetch current docs -> Cite sources -> Surface conflicts
- Authority hierarchy: official docs > type definitions > source code > community > training data
- Use Context7 MCP when available; fall back to web search (label as HEURISTIC)

Apply before writing framework-specific code. Skip for plain logic or known patterns.
