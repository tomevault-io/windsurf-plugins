# Design: System Design Phase

**Goal:** Produce system design artifacts for complex/medium features. Skipped for simple/trivial features.

**When active:** `phases.design: true` in temper.config AND feature complexity >= medium.

## Active Skills

- **Context Engineering** — load hierarchical context at stage start (rules → arch → source → errors, under 2K lines/task)
- **Temper Core** — stack detection, pack resolution, quality gates

## Execution

### Context Loading

This stage may run in two modes:
- **Standalone** (`/temper:design`) — runs in current context, handles its own gate
- **Agent subprocess** (from `/temper`) — starts with CLEAN context, only loads what's listed below

**Subprocess mode override:** When running as an Agent subprocess, do NOT show AskUserQuestion gates or clear context. Return the design summary to the orchestrator. The orchestrator handles all gate decisions and context transitions.

In both modes, the design methodology is identical.

**Context loading strategy:** Apply the context-engineering skill for hierarchical loading (rules -> arch -> source -> errors, under 2K lines/task). The file list below specifies WHAT to load; the skill specifies HOW and WHEN.

Files to load at start:
1. `.temper/specs/{feature}/intent.md`
2. `.temper/specs/{feature}/plan.md`
3. `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/.claude-plugin/reference/design.md` (this file)

### Step 1: Analyze Plan

Read intent.md and plan.md to understand:
- Feature scope and success criteria
- Planned file changes
- Risk level and complexity

### Step 2: System Design Exploration

For MEDIUM complexity features:
- Identify the primary system components involved
- Map data flow between components
- Define key interfaces

For COMPLEX complexity features:
- Full system architecture diagram
- API contract definitions (request/response shapes)
- Database schema changes (if applicable)
- Integration points with external systems
- Error handling strategy

### Step 3: Generate Design Artifacts

Write `.temper/specs/{feature}/design.md` using the template from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/templates/design.md`.

### Step 4: Design Summary

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| DESIGN -- {Feature Name}                                     |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE                                          |
|    Components: {N} new, {N} modified, {N} existing          |
|    Data flow: {brief description}                            |
|                                                              |
| API CONTRACTS (if applicable)                                |
|    + POST /api/{endpoint} -- {request shape} -> {response}   |
|    ~ GET /api/{endpoint} -- {change description}             |
|                                                              |
| DATABASE CHANGES (if applicable)                             |
|    + {table} -- {columns}                                    |
|    ~ {table} -- {change}                                     |
|                                                              |
| INTEGRATION POINTS                                           |
|    {external system} -- {how it connects}                    |
|                                                              |
| DECISION LOG                                                 |
|    1. {decision} -- {rationale}                              |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Stage Gate

Use AskUserQuestion with these options:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What next?"
  options:
    - label: "Continue to Build (Recommended)"
      description: "Proceed to build with the approved design."
    - label: "Walk through design step by step"
      description: "Interactive walkthrough of design decisions."
    - label: "Save for later"
      description: "Save design and stop."
  multiSelect: false
```

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Continue to Build** | Save design.md, proceed to build |
| **Walk through design** | Interactive section-by-section review (see below) |
| **Save for later** | Save state, stop |
| **Other** (free-text) | Edit design, re-show gate |

#### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

When the user selects "Walk through design step by step", present the design as an interactive, section-by-section flow.

**Walkthrough sections (dynamic — only show sections present in design.md):**

Read `design.md` and detect which sections exist. Present only sections that have content. The available sections:

1. **Architecture Overview** — System components, data flow diagram, what's new vs modified vs existing (always shown)
2. **API Contracts** — Request/response shapes, endpoint changes, backward compatibility notes (shown if design.md has API contract content)
3. **Database Changes** — Schema changes, migration strategy, impact on existing data (shown if design.md has database content)
4. **Integration Points** — External system connections, error handling strategy, retry/fallback logic (shown if design.md has integration content)
5. **Decision Log** — Each architectural decision with rationale and alternatives considered (always shown)

**After each section, use AskUserQuestion:**

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What would you like to do?"
