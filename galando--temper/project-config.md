# Config Suggestions

**Goal:** After Check passes, analyze what was built and suggest updates to CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md. Captures new patterns, learned conventions, and architectural decisions as config suggestions.

## When to Trigger

After all validation levels in `/temper:check` pass (no failures), before the Commit gate:

1. `config-suggestions` capability is enabled (default: enabled)
2. Check validation passed (compile, tests, coverage, lint, security all green)
3. At least one file was changed (`git diff --name-only` returns results)

## Analysis Inputs

```
1. git diff --stat (files changed, lines added/removed)
2. .temper/specs/{feature}/intent.md (what was planned)
3. .temper/specs/{feature}/tasks.md (tasks completed)
4. Existing CLAUDE.md content (project root or .claude/CLAUDE.md)
5. Existing AGENTS.md content (project root or .claude/AGENTS.md, if exists)
```

## Suggestion Categories

| Category | Detection | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| New pattern | Code introduces a reusable pattern not in existing docs | "Services use Result<> for error handling" |
| Learned convention | Naming/structure convention observed consistently in new code | "Test files follow *.test.ts naming" |
| Architectural decision | Structural choice that affects future code | "All API routes use /api/v2/ prefix" |
| Tooling config | New tool or config discovered | "Add ESLint rule for async/await" |

## Generation Algorithm

```
1. ANALYZE changed files for patterns:
   a. Error handling patterns (try/catch, Result<>, throw, .catch)
   b. Naming conventions (file naming, class naming, function naming)
   c. Directory structure patterns (where new files were placed)
   d. Import/export patterns (barrel exports, named exports)
   e. Testing patterns (describe/it, Given/When/Then, test helpers)
   f. Configuration patterns (env vars, config files, feature flags)
   g. API patterns (route structure, middleware, validation)
   h. Data patterns (DTOs, mappers, serializers)

2. COMPARE against existing CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md:
   - Is this pattern ALREADY documented? → Skip
   - Is this pattern NEW or DIFFERENT from documented? → Generate suggestion
   - Does this CONTRADICT documented patterns? → Flag as inconsistency

3. GENERATE suggestions:
   For each new/changed pattern:
   - type: new_pattern | learned_convention | architectural_decision | tooling_config
   - description: plain English explanation
   - suggested_text: the actual text to add to CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md
   - confidence: 0.0-1.0
   - target: CLAUDE.md | AGENTS.md

4. FILTER:
   - Skip suggestions with confidence < 0.6
   - Skip patterns that only appear once (likely one-off)
   - Skip patterns already in existing docs
   - Max 5 suggestions per check (prevent overwhelm)
```

## Graceful Degradation

- If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist: still generate suggestions, target file creation
- If AGENTS.md doesn't exist: skip AGENTS.md suggestions
- If no patterns detected (trivial change): show "No config suggestions for this change"
- If `learning.json` doesn't exist: create it with the suggestion entries

**This capability does NOT modify files without user consent.** All suggestions require explicit Accept at the Check gate.
