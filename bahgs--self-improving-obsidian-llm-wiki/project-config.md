description: LLM Wiki OS operating rules
---


This repository is an Obsidian-friendly LLM Wiki OS.

Before durable wiki changes, read:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `schema/AGENT.md`

For substantial ingest, query, lint, or audit work, also read:

- `schema/evolution/ingest-rubric.md`
- `schema/evolution/output-quality-rubric.md`
- `schema/evolution/extraction-patterns.md`

Core rule:

- `raw/` is immutable source evidence.
- `wiki/` is generated synthesis.
- `schema/` is the operating system for future agents.

Never modify `raw/` during normal ingest.
