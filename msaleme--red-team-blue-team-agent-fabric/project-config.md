# Agent Security Harness — Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview

Security testing framework for AI agent systems. 470 tests across 32 modules covering MCP, A2A, L402, x402, identity protocols, plus MCP server, telemetry, attestation registry, and community plugin system.

## Testing Procedures

### Round-Based Evaluation

Each "round" follows this exact procedure:

1. **Pull latest** — `git fetch origin && git pull origin main`
2. **Baseline check** — `python3 scripts/count_tests.py` + `python3 -m pytest testing/ -v --tb=short`
3. **Verify prior fixes** — Confirm all issues from the previous round are resolved with exact line numbers and evidence
4. **Deep scan for new issues** — Use parallel agents for thorough audits:
   - Security: command injection, SSRF, path traversal, deserialization, ReDoS, YAML bombs
   - Logic: tests that can't fail/pass, off-by-one, race conditions, dead code
   - Consistency: test count drift, version mismatches, missing CLI registrations
   - Integration: new modules registered in cli.py, test_code_quality.py, README
5. **Write new tests** — Add tests to `testing/test_code_quality.py` that catch every issue found
6. **Run full suite** — Verify new tests pass (for regressions) or fail (for real issues)
7. **Write evaluation report** — Unique file per round

### Report Naming Convention

```
testing/CRITICAL_EVALUATION_R{round}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
```

Examples:
- `testing/CRITICAL_EVALUATION_R24_2026-03-30.md`
- `testing/CRITICAL_EVALUATION_R25_2026-03-31.md`

Reports are **never overwritten** — each round produces a new dated file. The generic `testing/CRITICAL_EVALUATION.md` may also be updated as a "latest" pointer.

### Report Structure

Each evaluation report contains these sections in order:

1. **Header** — Date, round number, test counts, version, evaluator
2. **What Changed** — Files added/modified, line counts, purpose
3. **Prior Fix Verification** — Table: issue number, severity, FIXED/NOT FIXED, evidence with line numbers
4. **New Issues Found** — Each with: issue number (sequential across all rounds), severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), file:line, description, recommended fix
5. **What's Good** — Positive findings to acknowledge
6. **Methods** — Evaluation approach, files audited, tools used
7. **Self-Test Suite** — Test count, passing/failing, new tests added with descriptions
8. **Score** — 1-10 scale with historical table and trajectory chart
9. **Recommendations** — Prioritized: immediate, before next release, architecture
10. **Cumulative Assessment** — Total issues raised/fixed/open, trajectory

### Scoring Criteria

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|---------|
| 10/10 | Zero MEDIUM+ issues. All prior fixes intact. Tests all pass. |
| 9/10 | Only LOW issues. No regressions. |
| 8-9/10 | 1-3 MEDIUM issues. No HIGH/CRITICAL. |
| 7-8/10 | HIGH issues or 4+ MEDIUM issues. |
| <7/10 | CRITICAL issues or systemic problems. |

### Issue Severity Definitions

- **CRITICAL** — Remote code execution, credential exposure, data loss
- **HIGH** — Authentication bypass, supply chain risk, no sandboxing for untrusted input
- **MEDIUM** — SSRF, ReDoS, path traversal, info disclosure, stale counts in 10+ places
- **LOW** — Dead code, cosmetic, documentation inaccuracy, design discussions

## Issue Tracking

Issues are numbered sequentially across ALL rounds (currently at #140). Each issue includes:
- Unique number (never reused)
- Severity
- File and line number(s)
- Description
- Status: FIXED (with round number) / NOT FIXED / PARTIAL / DESIGN CHOICE

The test suite in `testing/test_code_quality.py` encodes key issues as executable regression checks. Failing tests indicate real unfixed issues, not test bugs.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `testing/test_code_quality.py` | Main regression suite — guards all issue classes |
| `testing/test_trial_runner.py` | trial_runner.py unit tests |
| `testing/test_gtg1002_patterns.py` | GTG-1002 _leak()/_recon_info() pattern tests |
| `testing/test_autogen_harness.py` | AutoGen harness unit tests |
| `testing/test_statistical.py` | Wilson CI, bootstrap, statistical report tests |
| `testing/test_transport.py` | JSON-RPC structure tests |
| `scripts/count_tests.py` | Single source of truth for test count |
| `protocol_tests/trial_runner.py` | Shared multi-trial runner (test-ID matching) |
| `protocol_tests/version.py` | Centralized version lookup |

## Common Issue Patterns to Watch For

These recur across rounds — always check:

1. **Test count drift** — New tests added but count not updated in CLI, README, pyproject.toml, badge, MCP server. Use `count_tests.py` as source of truth.
2. **New module not registered** — Added to `protocol_tests/` but missing from cli.py HARNESSES, test_code_quality.py MODULES, README table.
3. **Dict-merge vulnerability** — `{"_status": x, **(json.loads(body)...)}` lets server overwrite internal keys. Safe pattern: parse first, then assign.
4. **--trials no-op** — Module accepts `--trials` but doesn't actually loop. Must use `trial_runner.run_with_trials()`.
