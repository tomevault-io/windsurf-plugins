## Code Style
- Eger ihtiyacin olur ise her projede context-manager MCP’yi varsayılan kullan. Akış: 1) index_project(project_path) 2) search_code(query) 3) get_context(file,line) 4) gerekirse read_graph(node_id). Shell yerine önce MCP’den kanıt topla.
- Comments in English only
- Prefer functional programming over OOP
- Use OOP classes only for connectors and interfaces to external systems
- Write pure functions - only modify return values, never input parameters or global state
- Follow DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles
- Use strict typing everywhere - function returns, variables, collections
- Check if logic already exists before writing new code
- Avoid untyped variables and generic types
- Never use default parameter values - make all parameters explicit
- Create proper type definitions for complex data structures
- All imports at the top of the file
- Write simple single-purpose functions - no multi-mode behavior, no flag parameters that switch logic

## Error Handling

- Always raise errors explicitly, never silently ignore them
- Use specific error types that clearly indicate what went wrong
- Avoid catch-all exception handlers that hide the root cause
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- No fallbacks unless I explicitly ask for them
- Fix root causes, not symptoms
- External API or service calls: use retries with warnings, then raise the last error
- Error messages must include enough context to debug: request params, response body, status codes
- Logging should use structured fields instead of interpolating dynamic values into message strings

## Tooling and Dependencies

- Prefer modern package management files like `pyproject.toml` and `package.json`
- Install dependencies in project environments, not globally
- Add dependencies to project config files, not as one-off manual installs
- Read installed dependency source code when needed instead of guessing behavior

## Testing

- Respect the current repository testing strategy and existing test suite
- Do not add new unit tests by default
- When tests are needed, prefer integration, end-to-end, or smoke tests that validate real behavior
- Use unit tests only rarely, mainly for stable datasets or pure data transformations
- Never add unit tests just to increase coverage numbers
- Avoid mocks when real calls are practical
- It is usually better to spend a little money on real API or service calls than to maintain fragile mock-based coverage
- Add only the minimum test coverage needed for the requested change

## Codex Workflow

- Inspect the repository before editing
- Read active `AGENTS.md` files before making assumptions
- Keep changes minimal and directly related to the current request
- Match the existing repository style even when it differs from my personal preference
- Do not revert unrelated changes
- Prefer `rg` for code search
- Use non-interactive commands with flags
- Always use non-interactive git diff: `git --no-pager diff` or `git diff | cat`
- Run relevant tests or validation commands after code changes when the project already defines them

## Documentation

- Code is the primary documentation - use clear naming, types, and docstrings
- Keep documentation in docstrings of the functions or classes they describe, not in separate files
- Separate docs files only when a concept cannot be expressed clearly in code
- Never duplicate documentation across files
- Store knowledge as current state, not as a changelog of modifications
