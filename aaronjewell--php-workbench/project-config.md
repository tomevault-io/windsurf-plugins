# Testing Implementation Standards

## Test Structure Template
Follow this pattern for consistent, thorough tests:

@templates/test-template.ts

## Test Organization
- Tests should be in `src/test/` directory
- Use descriptive test names: `should_execute_php_code_with_composer_autoload`
- Group related tests in `describe` blocks
- Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` for setup/teardown

## Test Structure Principles
- **Arrange**: Set up test data and dependencies
- **Act**: Execute the code under test
- **Assert**: Verify the expected behavior
- Use meaningful assertions with descriptive messages

## Mocking and Isolation
- Mock external dependencies (file system, network, VSCode APIs)
- Test business logic in isolation from side effects
- Use dependency injection to make code testable
- Mock VSCode APIs when testing extension commands

## VSCode Extension Testing
- Use `@vscode/test-electron` for integration tests
- Test extension activation and command registration
- Mock VSCode APIs for unit tests
- Test both success and error scenarios

## Test Coverage Requirements
- All business logic must have unit tests
- Error paths must be tested
- Edge cases should have dedicated tests
- Integration tests for command registration and activation
- Test both success and error scenarios
