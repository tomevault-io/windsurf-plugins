# Bugbot Python Review Rule

When reviewing or generating changes in this repository, prioritize finding behavior regressions and safety issues before style concerns.

## Review Priorities

1. Confirm telemetry integration behavior remains backward compatible unless explicitly changed.
2. Verify environment-variable precedence and configuration fallback logic are preserved.
3. Ensure semantic convention constants remain stable and typo-free.
4. Require unit tests for behavior changes, especially around `integrations/configuration.py` and `semconv` modules.
5. Flag silent exception handling, overly broad `except Exception`, and dropped error context.

## Required Checks Before Approving

1. Run unit tests in package directory:
   - `uv run pytest -v tests/unit`
2. Run quality checks:
   - `make lint`
3. If headers or new files changed, run:
   - `make license-check`

## High-Risk Change Signals

- Changes to public constants in `semconv`.
- Changes to default exporter endpoints, headers, or auth behavior.
- Changes to package versioning or release workflow files.
- Added dependencies without justification in `pyproject.toml`.
