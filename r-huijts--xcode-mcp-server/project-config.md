# Xcode MCP Server Tools Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the tools available in the Xcode MCP Server and explains how they interact with Xcode projects.

## Server Architecture

The Xcode MCP Server is organized into the following modules:

- **Project Management**: Tools for working with Xcode projects
- **File Operations**: Tools for reading and writing files
- **Build & Testing**: Tools for building and testing projects
- **CocoaPods Integration**: Tools for managing CocoaPods dependencies
- **Swift Package Manager**: Tools for managing Swift Package Manager functionality
- **Simulator Tools**: Tools for interacting with iOS simulators
- **Xcode Utilities**: Miscellaneous Xcode-specific tools
- **Path Management**: System for secure file access and directory navigation

## Project Management Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `set_projects_base_dir` | Sets the base directory where Xcode projects are stored |
| `set_project_path` | Sets the active Xcode project (xcodeproj, xcworkspace, or SPM) |
| `get_active_project` | Retrieves detailed information about the active project |
| `find_projects` | Finds Xcode projects in the specified directory |
| `get_project_configuration` | Retrieves configuration details for the active project |
| `detect_active_project` | Attempts to automatically detect the active Xcode project |
| `change_directory` | Changes the active directory for relative path operations |
| `push_directory` | Pushes current directory to stack and changes to a new directory |
| `pop_directory` | Returns to previous directory from stack |
| `get_current_directory` | Shows the current active directory |

These tools help you navigate and manage Xcode projects. The server supports multiple project types including regular .xcodeproj files, workspaces (.xcworkspace), and Swift Package Manager projects (Package.swift).

## File Operation Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_file` | Reads the contents of a file within allowed directories |
| `write_file` | Writes or updates file content within allowed directories |
| `copy_file` | Copies a file or directory to a new location |
| `move_file` | Moves a file or directory to a new location |
| `delete_file` | Deletes a file or directory |
| `create_directory` | Creates a new directory |
| `list_project_files` | Lists all files within an Xcode project |
| `list_directory` | Lists directory contents with options for format and hidden files |
| `get_file_info` | Gets detailed information about a file or directory |
| `find_files` | Searches for files matching a pattern in a directory |
| `resolve_path` | Shows how a path would be resolved |
| `check_file_exists` | Checks if a file or directory exists |

File operation tools allow you to interact with files securely. All operations use the path management system for validation and security.

## Build & Testing Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `analyze_file` | Analyzes a source file for potential issues using Xcode's static analyzer |
| `build_project` | Builds the active Xcode project with specified configuration and scheme |
| `run_tests` | Executes tests for the active Xcode project, optionally with a test plan |

Build and testing tools interact with Xcode's build system to compile your projects and run tests. They use `xcodebuild` in the background.

## CocoaPods Integration

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pod_install` | Runs 'pod install' in the active project directory |
| `pod_update` | Runs 'pod update' in the active project directory |
| `pod_outdated` | Checks for outdated dependencies in the project |
| `pod_repo_update` | Updates the local CocoaPods spec repositories |
| `pod_deintegrate` | Removes CocoaPods from the project |
| `pod_init` | Initializes a new Podfile in the project |
| `check_cocoapods` | Checks if the active project uses CocoaPods and returns setup information |

CocoaPods tools allow you to manage CocoaPods dependencies in your iOS projects. These tools require CocoaPods to be installed on your system.

## Swift Package Manager Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `init_swift_package` | Initializes a new Swift Package Manager project with options for type and testing |
| `add_swift_package` | Adds a Swift Package dependency to the active project |
| `update_swift_package` | Updates dependencies with options for specific packages and versions |
| `swift_package_command` | Executes arbitrary Swift Package Manager commands |
| `build_swift_package` | Builds a Swift Package with configuration options |
| `test_swift_package` | Tests a Swift Package with filtering and parallel options |
| `show_swift_dependencies` | Displays dependency graphs in various formats |
| `clean_swift_package` | Cleans build artifacts with options for global cache |
| `dump_swift_package` | Dumps the Package.swift manifest as JSON |

Swift Package Manager tools provide comprehensive support for Swift packages and dependencies. They interact with the Swift Package Manager CLI and provide enhanced error reporting.

## Simulator Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
