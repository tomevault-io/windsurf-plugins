This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

OpenWave is an open-source subatomic wave simulator for exploring fundamental physics through **classical field theory enriched with topology and nonlinearity** — the scientific tradition of de Broglie–Bohm pilot waves, wave structure of matter, and modern topological-soliton models. The platform tests whether particles and forces can emerge from deterministic field equations rather than being postulated.

The simulator runs multiple candidate Lagrangian frameworks (scalar-field, vector-field) in a shared numerical engine, plus a granule-motion model for educational visualization. GPU acceleration uses Taichi Lang.

### Project Goals

OpenWave investigates, in one integrated simulator, four primary domains: **matter** (particle emergence from topological defects + wave dynamics), **forces** (electric, strong, magnetic, gravitational from one classical-field framework), **electromagnetic waves**, and **heat** (whether wave-field degrees of freedom contribute to thermal physics). Each domain has concrete pass/fail criteria applied uniformly across candidate models.

### What is OpenWave?

### Theoretical Advisors and Candidate Frameworks

| Contributor | Framework | OpenWave Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jeff Yee | Energy Wave Theory (EWT) | M3 |
| Dr. Jarek Duda | Liquid Crystal Particle Analogs (arxiv 2108.07896, 2501.04036) | M5 |
| Dr. Robert Close | Classical elastic-solid / "Equation of Everything" | M5 (shared) |
| Manfried Faber | LdG regularization (Universe 11/2025/113) | M5.6 baseline |

### Known Challenges & Limitations

- Full Planck-scale fidelity is computationally prohibitive; resolution is user-tunable per xperiment.
- Uses a dedicated physics computational backend (Taichi GPU), independent of 3D modeling software.

### Scientific Source Material

Each model directory under `openwave/xperiments/` contains a `/research` subfolder with active research notes, plus a `theory/` folder (at the model root) holding the foundational theorist papers for that model (e.g. `m5_liquid_crystal/theory/liquid_crystal_model.pdf`, `Equation-of-Everything.pdf`, `faber_universe_2025.pdf`).

Note: the legacy top-level `scientific_source/` folder was retired 2026-05-18 — papers now live per-model.

## Installation & Usage

Refer to `README.md` for installation, CLI usage (`openwave -x`), and the instrumentation framework.

## Physics Context

OpenWave implements classical-field-theory-with-topology-and-nonlinearity approaches:

- Topological defects provide static structure (integer charge, spin).
- Klein-Gordon-like wave dynamics around the vacuum field provide mass and relativistic kinematics.
- Standing-wave interference between defect emissions produces orbit quantization.
- Particles are **time-periodic resonances** (Zitterbewegung clocks), NOT static solitons — Derrick's theorem forbids static stable solitons, confirmed empirically in M5.2.

- Also refer to ../CLAUDE.md file to search for any available context to the OpenWave project in a parent directory.
