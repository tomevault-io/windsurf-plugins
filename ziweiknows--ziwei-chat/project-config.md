## Product Constitution

Ziwei Chat is a consumer-facing Ziwei Dou Shu vertical agent. Chat is the interface; the product asset is a reliable agent that grounds answers in chart facts, deterministic tools, curated knowledge, analysis workflows, and quality checks.

The product must serve ordinary users who want an interesting, repeatable, companion-like fortune analysis experience without requiring Ziwei Dou Shu vocabulary.

The first release is open-source and Vercel-first for deployment. It must not require product registration, product login, email verification, payment, or a Ziwei Chat hosted account. Formal product accounts are future extensions, not first-version requirements.

## Engineering Principles

- Reuse mature open-source infrastructure before writing custom systems.
- Do not implement chart calculation logic by hand; use iztro as the deterministic chart engine.
- Use Vercel AI SDK for streaming chat, model calls, and tool execution.
- Treat Vercel as the primary deployment path to reduce open-source adoption friction.
- Use Postgres as the system of record. Local Markdown/keyword knowledge search is the open-source baseline; pgvector is an optional enhanced retrieval mode.
- Keep the first version narrow but agentic: intent routing, planning, tool calls, knowledge loading, memory, and response critique must exist.
- Keep user-visible language friendly and plain; keep internal analysis structured and auditable.
- Default identity model is an anonymous profile/workspace, not an authenticated user account.
- Open-source mode must run without a Ziwei Chat hosted account or embedding service.

## Agent Principles

Accuracy comes from this chain:

```text
birth data -> deterministic chart -> chart facts -> analysis workflow -> trusted knowledge -> critic -> plain-language response
```

The LLM must not invent chart facts, calculate Ziwei positions, or make irreversible life decisions for the user.

## Documentation Protocol

- Update docs when changing product scope, module boundaries, tool contracts, data schemas, knowledge format, prompt protocol, or evaluation rules.
- Add module-level `AGENTS.md` files once source directories exist and a module gains multiple responsibilities.
- For important business files, add the L3 header:

```text
/**
 * [INPUT]: Depends on {specific modules or capabilities}
 * [OUTPUT]: Provides {exported functions/components/types/constants}
 * [POS]: {module role and relationship with sibling files}
 * [PROTOCOL]: Update this header when changed, then check AGENTS.md
 */
```
