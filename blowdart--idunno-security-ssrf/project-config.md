﻿## General

* Make only high confidence suggestions when reviewing code changes.
* Always use the latest version C#, currently C# 13 features.
* Do not use preview language features.
* Never change .editorconfig files unless explicitly asked to.
* Never change .gitignore files unless explicitly asked to.
* Never change global.json unless explicitly asked to.
* Never change Directory.Build.props or Directory.Build.targets files unless explicitly asked to.
* Never change Directory.Packages.props file unless explicitly asked to.
* Never change package.json or package-lock.json files unless explicitly asked to.
* Never change NuGet.config file unless explicitly asked to.

* Apply code-formatting style defined in `.editorconfig`.
* Prefer file-scoped namespace declarations and single-line using directives.
* Insert a newline before the opening curly brace of any code block (e.g., after `if`, `for`, `while`, `foreach`, `using`, `try`, etc.).
* Ensure that the final return statement of a method is on its own line.
* Use pattern matching and switch expressions wherever possible.
* Use `nameof` instead of string literals when referring to member names.
* Ensure that XML doc comments are created for any public APIs.
* When adding XML documentation to APIs, follow the guidelines at [`docs.prompt.md`](/.github/prompts/docs.prompt.md).
* Prefer `?.` if applicable (e.g. `scope?.Dispose()`).
* Use `ObjectDisposedException.ThrowIf` where applicable.

**If you make code changes you MUST ensure there are tests for the changes.**

**Any code you commit MUST compile, and new and existing tests related to the change MUST pass.**

You MUST make your best effort to ensure any code changes satisfy those criteria before committing. If for any reason you were unable to build or test code changes, you MUST report that. You MUST NOT claim success unless all builds and tests pass as described above.

If you make code changes, do not complete without checking the relevant code builds and relevant tests still pass after the last edits you make. Do not simply assume that your changes fix test failures you see, actually build and run those tests again to confirm.

### Nullable Reference Types

* Declare variables non-nullable, and check for `null` at entry points.
* Always use `is null` or `is not null` instead of `== null` or `!= null`.
* Trust the C# null annotations and don't add null checks when the type system says a value cannot be null.

### Testing

* We use xUnit SDK v3 for tests.
* Do not emit "Act", "Arrange" or "Assert" comments.
* Copy existing style in nearby files for test method names and capitalization.
* When writing tests, prefer using `[Theory]` with multiple data sources (like `[InlineData]` or `[MemberData]`) over multiple duplicative `[Fact]` methods. Fewer test methods that validate more inputs are better than many similar test methods.* 

## Running tests

* To build and run tests in the repo use the `dotnet test` command from the root of the repository.
