# Rust Coding Guidelines for Library Development

## General Principles

- Write **idiomatic Rust** code that is clear, efficient, and maintainable.
- Prioritize **safety, performance, and modularity**.
- Follow **Rust’s naming conventions**:
  - Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, and module names.
  - Use `PascalCase` for structs, enums, and traits.
  - Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants and static variables.
- Keep code **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** by using functions, modules, and generics.
- Use **explicit, descriptive names** for variables, functions, and types.
- **Avoid `unwrap()` except in test cases**, ensuring proper error handling.
- **Use generics, traits, and interface programming** where applicable.
- **If any grammar mistakes are found in comments, suggestions for improvement should be provided.**

---

## Error Handling

- Use `thiserror` to make custom error for package-level errors. You shouldn't use `anyhow` unless I explictly approve you to do that.
- Avoid panics in library code; return errors instead.
- Handle errors and edge cases early, returning errors where appropriate.

---

## Performance Optimization

- Use **iterators instead of loops** for better performance and readability.
- Minimize memory allocations by using **borrowed references (`&str`, `&[u8]`)** where possible.
- Optimize for **human readability** while maintaining machine efficiency.
- Use `criterion` for benchmarking.

---

## Async Programming

- Use `tokio` as the async runtime.
- Prefer **channels over mutexes** where applicable.
- Implement **structured concurrency** using `tokio::select!`.
- Use `tokio::sync::mpsc` for multi-producer, single-consumer communication.
- Use `tokio::sync::broadcast` for broadcasting messages.

---

## API Design

- Follow **Rust’s API guidelines** for public interfaces.
- Use **builder patterns** for complex configurations.
- Try to proper trait definition and implementation to invert dependencies and testability.
- reexport public types and functions from the root crate.

---

## Testing

- Write **unit tests** with `#[cfg(test)]`.
- Use **integration tests** for public APIs in the `tests/` directory.
- Mock external dependencies where necessary.
- Use `tokio::test` for as
mentation
- Write **Rustdoc** comments for public functions and structs.
- Include examples in   preview document

---

## Dependency Management

- Use `cargo-audit` to che**minimal and up-to-date**.
- Add crates to workspace's `Cargo.toml` file. Don't add them to individual crates' `Cargo.toml` files.

---

## Logging and Debugging

- Use `tracing` for structured logging.
- Enable debug assertions wit_assert!()`.
