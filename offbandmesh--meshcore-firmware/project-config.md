These two documents are the canonical inheritance for this project. Anything below extends or parameterizes them; nothing below overrides them. If there is a conflict, SAFELANE and CLAUDE-BASE win.

## What Offband is

Offband is a standalone MIT fork of [MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore) for cross-role firmware enhancements and optimization (companion/observer + repeater active; room/bridge not yet). Firmware repo: **`OffbandMesh/meshcore-firmware`**. See `README.md`.

> Formerly **Crosswire** — the product was rebranded to **Offband** (#100) and the repo moved `Strycher/Crosswire` → `OffbandMesh/meshcore-firmware` (#107, 2026-06-13). The **Citadel project and Agent-Mail key intentionally keep the legacy `Crosswire` name** (Citadel has no project-rename/batch-move — DifferentWire/citadel#81; renaming would strand 80+ tasks and the `Crosswire-xxx` short-ids). The name mismatch is cosmetic.

## Project identity (READ FIRST)

This firmware is **Offband**, repo **`OffbandMesh/meshcore-firmware`**, working dir **`C:\Dev\meshcore-firmware`**. For ALL work here (including worktrees):

| Channel | Value |
|---|---|
| Citadel | **`DW_PROJECT=Crosswire` — MANDATORY to export.** The git hooks default the project to the repo basename (`meshcore-firmware`), which is NOT a Citadel project, so commits/pushes fail unless `DW_PROJECT=Crosswire` is set. **Never** `LoRa`. (worktree project-resolution bug: #22.) |
| GitHub issues/PRs | `OffbandMesh/meshcore-firmware` |
| GitHub Project board | OffbandMesh org board **#1** (`PVT_kwDOEXsS3c4BaleW`) |
| Agent Mail `project_key` | **`app-c-dev-crosswire`** — register + send + read HERE. Register with `register_agent(project_key="app-c-dev-crosswire", ...)` directly; do **NOT** `ensure_project` on the path (would mint a stray `app-c-dev-meshcore-firmware` and break coordination). NOT `app-c-dev-lora`, NOT `app-crosswire`. |
| Do NOT conflate | `Strycher/LoRa` (separate personal origin repo) and `Strycher/meshcore-open` (separate client fork — not this project). |

Worktrees coordinate in the SAME `app-c-dev-crosswire` (resolve from the repo common dir, not the worktree path).

## Project Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `PROJECT_NAME` | Offband (Citadel project + `DW_PROJECT` = `Crosswire`; see Project identity) |
| `PROJECT_DIR` | `C:\Dev\meshcore-firmware` (renamed from `C:\Dev\Crosswire` 2026-06-13, #107) |
| `INFRA_PROFILE` | Maker |
| `BUILD_COMMAND` | `pio run -e <env>` (run from this repo's working tree at `C:\Dev\meshcore-firmware`) |
| `DEPLOY_TARGET` | Device flash over USB / OTA (no SCP deploy; firmware is flashed, not server-deployed) |
| `CITADEL_PROJECT` | `Crosswire` (now → `OffbandMesh/meshcore-firmware`; name kept, citadel#81). Always `DW_PROJECT=Crosswire`. |
| `GITHUB_PROJECT_ID` | `PVT_kwDOEXsS3c4BaleW` (OffbandMesh org board #1) |
| `AGENT_MAIL_STATUS` | Canonical git hooks installed (preflight, pre-commit, post-commit, pre-push, commit-msg, block-direct-citadel-db). Firmware flash/OTA/agent-mail PreToolUse hooks PORTED (P5.2): block-raw-flash, block-raw-curl-ota, require-agent-mail-check (registered in `.claude/settings.json`). |

## Project board field IDs (OffbandMesh org board #1)

Recorded per REPOCONFIG (board field IDs captured in project CLAUDE.md). Consumed by `.github/workflows/sync-labels-to-board.yml`.

- `PROJECT_ID` = `PVT_kwDOEXsS3c4BaleW`
- Status field `PVTSSF_lADOEXsS3c4BaleWzhVcBL8`: backlog `91d35710`, todo `7bf7b9ef`, ready `ec816a33`, in-progress `ee71a6e3`, testing `3dc70fe4`, deferred `fc4959bc`, done `4a67db65`
- Priority field `PVTSSF_lADOEXsS3c4BaleWzhVcBMs`: P0 `43b5c396`, P1 `40c7b471`, P2 `3ed2b368`, P3 `2406bdd1`

**Required secret:** the sync workflow needs repo secret `PROJECT_PAT` — a **classic** PAT with `project` + `repo` scope (the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot mutate an org-owned Projects v2 board). ⚠ **Must be classic, not fine-grained:** OffbandMesh rejects fine-grained PATs with >366-day lifetime for org-Projects access, so `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (fine-grained) does **not** work (DifferentWire/standards#148). **Set + verified** 2026-06-14 (board sync confirmed live).

## Migration status (IMPORTANT for agents)

**Firmware has migrated here.** `firmware-base` (this repo's default branch) is the canonical Offband (meshcore-firmware) firmware tree. The old `crosswire` branch of `Strycher/MeshCore` is retired and that **fork is archived** (2026-06-04, read-only; reversible via `gh repo unarchive`). Full history is preserved in this repo: branches (patch-id verified), all `crosswire-v*` release tags + `archive/*` tags, and Plan 3 (see Preserved artifacts). Design-of-record: `docs/architecture/2026-06-01-observer-architecture-review.md`.
