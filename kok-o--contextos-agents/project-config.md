description: Minimalist coding mindset based on DietrichGebert/ponytail. Teaches the AI to write only what is strictly necessary. Uses a 7-rung ladder: YAGNI → reuse → stdlib → platform → deps → one-liner → minimum. Minimizes unnecessary boilerplate and over-engineering while keeping all safety, validation and security guards.

## Overview

Minimalist engineering discipline that eliminates over-engineering and premature abstraction while maintaining 100% of required validation, type safety, error boundaries, and security invariants.

## When to Use

Activate on all BUILD phases to prevent bloated implementations and enforce concise, focused solutions.

## Rules & Patterns

Based on [DietrichGebert/ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail).

> _He says nothing. He writes one line. It works._

**Core Impact**: Dramatically reduces code footprint by eliminating premature abstraction, YAGNI violations, and boilerplate, while keeping all safety invariants (validation, error handling, security) 100% intact.

### Core Principle

> **The best code is code you don't write.**  
> Write only what the task strictly needs. Lazy about the solution, never about reading and understanding.

---

### The 7-Rung Decision Ladder

**Before writing ANY code**, stop and check each rung in order. Stop at the first rung that holds:

```text
1. Does this need to exist?
   → No: YAGNI — skip it entirely. Don't build for "future use."

2. Already in this codebase or component library?
   → Yes: Reuse it. Don't rewrite. Call the existing function/component/module.
   → For UI: Check shadcn/ui FIRST. Before building a complex UI element from scratch, check if it exists in the component library. If yes, generate the install command: npx shadcn@latest add dialog — never manually rewrite what shadcn already provides.

3. Standard library does it?
   → Yes: Use it. Don't write formatDate() — use Intl.DateTimeFormat or dayjs.

4. Native platform feature?
   → Yes: Use it. Don't install flatpickr when <input type="date"> exists.
   → Exception for UI Components: If a native HTML element (like <input type="date"> or <select>) CANNOT be styled consistently across Chrome, Safari, and Firefox to match the premium design system — use the established component library (e.g., shadcn/ui <DatePicker>, <Select>) instead. Cross-browser inconsistency is a legitimate reason to NOT use native.

5. Already-installed dependency?
   → Yes: Use it. Don't install a new library to do what an existing one can.

6. Can it be done in one line?
   → Yes: One line. No abstraction layer needed.

7. Only then: write the MINIMUM that works.
   → No classes when a function works. No module when an inline does.
```

### The Rule of Three (Do Not Abstract Early)

- **First occurrence**: Write it inline directly where it is needed.
- **Second occurrence**: Duplicate it cleanly. Duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction.
- **Third occurrence**: Only now extract a shared helper or utility.

### 10 Concrete Over-Engineering Red Flags

1. Creating a `GenericRepository<T>` when you only have 2 database tables.
2. Creating a custom state machine or complex reducer for 2 boolean flags.
3. Adding a configuration file or environment variables for values that never change.
4. Writing custom retry/circuit-breaker logic when native `fetch` or SDK already handles it.
5. Building a generic `BaseService` with 15 hook methods implemented by only one class.
6. Wrapping every standard library call in a custom helper class (`StringUtils`, `DateUtils`, `ObjectUtils`).
7. Creating a multi-level folder structure (`domains/auth/adapters/driving/rest/controllers/dto/`) for a 30-line microservice.
8. Writing custom mock frameworks when Vitest/Jest/Node test runner provide standard mocks.
9. Installing a 50KB npm package for a 3-line utility (e.g. `left-pad`, `is-number`, `deep-clone`).
10. Pre-optimizing caching and indexing for endpoints serving 10 requests a day.

### The Sacred Exceptions (NEVER Cut These)

The ladder applies to features and abstractions. These 4 areas are **non-negotiable** and **never simplified away**:

#### 1. Input Validation

```javascript
// [GOOD] Always validate — even if "internal" API
function createUser(data) {
  if (!data.email || !isValidEmail(data.email)) {
    throw new ValidationError('Invalid email');
  }
  return db.insert('users', data);
}

// [BAD] Never skip validation for "speed"
function createUser(data) {
  return db.insert('users', data); // NEVER
}
```

#### 2. Error Handling

```javascript
// [GOOD] Always handle errors explicitly
async function fetchUser(id) {
  try {
    const user = await db.findById(id);
    if (!user) throw new NotFoundError(`User ${id} not found`);
    return user;
  } catch (err) {
    logger.error('fetchUser failed', { id, err });
    throw err;
  }
}
```

#### 3. Security Checks

- Authorization check BEFORE every query or mutation.
- Parameterized queries everywhere — zero string concatenation in SQL.
- Strict sanitization of all rendered HTML and markdown.

#### 4. Type Safety & Behavioral Tests

- Strict TypeScript types — no `any` evasion.
- Tests covering happy path, 4xx, and 5xx edge cases.
