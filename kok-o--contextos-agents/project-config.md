## Overview

High-precision operational standard designed specifically to harness the high speed and expansive context window of Google Gemini models while eliminating common LLM failure modes: hasty assumptions, partial code placeholders (`// ...`), unverified assertions, and scope creep.

## When to Use

Activate whenever:

- Executing non-trivial code modifications, refactoring, bug fixes, or architecture design.
- The user requires maximum rigor, reliability, and precision from Gemini.
- Handling complex multi-file changes where accidental side-effects must be zero.

## Rules & Patterns

### 1. The Read-Before-Write Invariant (Zero Assumptions)

**Never write code based on assumptions about the codebase.**

- Before modifying a function or creating an integration, **always inspect the actual files** using `view_file` or `grep_search`.
- Check the exact runtime, framework version, and installed dependencies (e.g. React 19 vs 18, Next.js 15 vs 14, Tailwind v4 vs v3, Zod vs Joi) in `package.json` or config files before generating code.
- Verify imported symbol names and parameter signatures directly from source files.

### 2. The Zero-Placeholder Invariant (Complete Code Only)

**Never produce lazy, incomplete, or stubbed output.**

- ❌ **Forbidden**:
  - `// TODO: implement logic here`
  - `// ... rest of existing code ...`
  - `// ... existing imports ...`
  - Mock stub returns when real integration is required
- ✅ **Mandatory**:
  - Provide **100% complete, fully-implemented, compilable, and drop-in ready** code.
  - When replacing a block of code, include all necessary imports, type definitions, and edge-case handling.

### 3. The Proof-of-Work Invariant (Verification Before Completion)

**Never claim a task is complete without tool-verified evidence.**

- When modifying code or configuration:
  1. Run the project validator or compiler (`node .agents/ctx.js validate`, `tsc --noEmit`, etc.).
  2. Run unit and integration tests (`npm test`, `pytest`, etc.).
  3. Run linter and formatting checks (`npm run lint:md`, `eslint`, etc.).
- If a test or validation fails, do not guess: read the exact error trace, fix the root cause, and re-run until green.

### 4. Surgical Blast Radius Containment

**Modify ONLY what is strictly necessary.**

- Keep edits isolated to the exact lines, functions, and files specified in the plan.
- Do not reformat, reorder, or alter indentation of unrelated code blocks.
- Preserve existing comments, docstrings, and project conventions unless explicitly asked to change them.

### 5. Ponytail Minimalism (YAGNI)

- Prioritize native platform APIs (standard library, browser built-ins) over new npm/pip packages.
- Follow the "Rule of Three": inline on first use, duplicate cleanly on second, abstract only on third.
- Keep solutions obvious to a mid-level developer without requiring multi-layered wrapper classes.

### 6. Targeted Tool-Specific Modifications

**Prevent accidental code loss during file updates.**

- For existing files requiring localized updates (< 50% change), always prefer surgical targeted replacement chunks over destructive full-file rewrites.
- Never discard unrelated file sections, existing comments, or helper utilities.

### 7. Persistent Context & Plan Tracking

**Prevent context drift during multi-step tasks.**

- When an operation requires more than 3 sequential steps, write and maintain a persistent plan or checklist on disk.
- Never rely exclusively on volatile conversational memory for tracking complex multi-file refactorings.

### 8. Progressive Step Narration (Transparent Pair Programming)

**Eliminate the "black box" by narrating technical decisions.**

- Avoid executing long, silent chains of tool calls without user visibility.
- Provide a concise 1–2 sentence transparent status update before key operations:
  - State what was inspected or verified from the code.
  - State the architectural decision made and the immediate next action.
- Keep narration crisp and actionable without excessive verbosity.
- **Zero-Spam Constraint**:
  - ❌ **Forbidden**: Starting every intermediate step, tool call, or status update with domain/phase/role tags (e.g. `[DOMAIN: ...] [PHASE: ...] [ROLE: ...]`).
  - ✅ **Mandatory**: Declare role and phase strictly once at the start of a phase. Intermediate step updates must be clean, natural language sentences describing technical actions directly.
  - Do not narrate routine micro-inspections (single line reads or basic greps). Announce only meaningful task phases and decisions.

## Code Examples

### Bad (Lazy Model Output) vs Good (Precision Model Output)

**❌ Bad (Lazy AI Output)**:

```javascript
// user.service.js
export async function updateUser(id, data) {
  // ... existing auth check ...
  // TODO: validate data with zod
  return await db.user.update({ where: { id }, data });
}
```

**✅ Good (Gemini Precision Output)**:

```javascript
// user.service.js
import { z } from 'zod';
import { db } from '../lib/db.js';
import { ValidationError, UnauthorizedError } from '../errors/index.js';
