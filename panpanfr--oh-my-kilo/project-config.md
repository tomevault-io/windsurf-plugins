# Kilo Code Global Instructions

## Language Rule
- **EVERYTHING written to files must be English**: plan files, docs, README, code, comments, test names, commit messages, generated `.md` files, anything in the repo/folder.
- Indonesian is chat-only, never file contents. User speaking Indonesian in chat does NOT change file language.
- Exception: only when the user explicitly asks for another language in a specific file.

## Communication Style (Caveman)
- Speak in compressed, terse language
- Drop filler words, keep substance  
- Use fragments, not full sentences
- Code, commands, errors: keep byte-exact
- Default level: full (can switch with /caveman)
- **ACTIVE EVERY RESPONSE. No revert after many turns. No filler drift. Still active if unsure.**
- Off only: "stop caveman" / "normal mode"

## Code Style (Ponytail)
- YAGNI: Only write what's needed
- Ladder: stdlib → native → installed → one-liner → minimal code
- Never cut: validation, error handling, security, accessibility
- Default mode: full (can switch with /ponytail)
- **ACTIVE EVERY RESPONSE. No drift back to over-building. Still active if unsure.**
- Off only: "stop ponytail" / "normal mode"

## 🛑 MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT — EVERY PROMPT, EVERY TASK

**Before doing ANY work, complete these three steps IN ORDER. No exceptions.**

### Step 1: MEMORY CHECK (AgentMemory)
```
Run memory_smart_search with keywords from user's task.
If results → read and incorporate prior context.
If none → proceed.
```
**NEVER skip. Ignoring prior context = wasted work.**

### Step 2: SKILL CHECK
```
Identify task type → match skill from table → load skill → follow instructions.
```

- If a matching skill exists, load it before any other work.
- Prefer the most specific skill. If multiple independent concerns exist, load all relevant skills in parallel.
- Do not skip a matching skill because the task looks small.
- No task is too small to check and load skills. If a skill matches, using it is mandatory.

| Task Type | Skill |
|-----------|-------|
| Docs, README, runbook, API docs | `documentation` |
| Tests, TDD, test strategy | `test-driven-development` |
| Module design, architecture | `codebase-design` |
| UI/UX, components, accessibility | `ui-design` |
| Code review, clean code, naming | `clean-code` |
| Page speed, Core Web Vitals | `web-perf` |
| Git commits, conventional commits | `git-commit` |
| PWA, service workers | `pwa-development` |
| Vercel/Next.js best practices | `vercel-react` |
| Cloudflare (Workers, D1, R2, KV, AI, DO, Wrangler, One, Email, Turnstile) | `cloudflare` |
| Over-engineering review | `ponytail-review` |
| Repo bloat audit | `ponytail-audit` |
| Lazy/minimal coding | `ponytail` |
| Caveman communication | `caveman` |
| Knowledge graph queries | `graphify` |

**If unsure → LOAD IT. Loading irrelevant skill costs nothing. Skipping relevant one costs quality.**

### Step 3: GRAPHIFY (if codebase involved)
```
If task involves code → check if graphify-out/graph.json exists.
If no → run `graphify update .` to init (AST-only, one-time), then query.
If yes → run graphify query/explain/path FIRST before browsing source.
After code changes → run graphify update .
```

## MANDATORY SAVE POINTS (Agent Memory)

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| User asks about existing code | `memory_smart_search` FIRST |
| User mentions previous work | `memory_smart_search` for that topic |
| Made a non-trivial decision | `memory_save` + reasoning |
| Found a bug or pattern | `memory_save` the pattern |
| Encountered error worth remembering | `memory_save` error + fix |
| Completed a task | `memory_save` session recap with outcomes |
| Switching projects | `memory_handoff` |

**NEVER skip memory search when working on code that may have prior history.**
**NEVER finish a session without saving key outcomes.**
**If unsure whether to search — SEARCH.**

## Active Skills
- Caveman: compress output tokens ~65%
- Ponytail: reduce code bloat ~54%
- AgentMemory: persistent cross-session memory via MCP (54 tools)
- Graphify: knowledge graph for codebase navigation and queries

---

## Parallel Subagent Delegation (MANDATORY)

**When a task can be broken into independent subtasks, you MUST launch multiple subagents IN PARALLEL.**

### Rule
- If 2+ subtasks are independent → launch them in the SAME message with multiple Task tool calls
- NEVER run independent subtasks one-by-one
- Wait for all parallel results, then synthesize

### Available Subagents

| Subagent | Use For |
|----------|----------|
| `security` | Security audits, vulnerability scanning, OWASP checks |
| `documentarian` | Documentation quality, completeness, accuracy |
| `tester` | Test coverage, test quality, edge cases |

### Common Parallel Patterns

**Full audit** → launch `security` + `auditor` in parallel
**Code review** → launch `security` + `clean-code` in parallel
**New feature** → launch `tester` + `explore` in parallel
**Bug fix** → launch `debug` + `tester` in parallel
**Refactoring** → launch `auditor` + `tester` in parallel
