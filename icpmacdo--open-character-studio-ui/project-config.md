# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Despite the directory name, there is no UI here. This is `open-character-tinker` (CLI: `octt`) — a Python implementation of Open Character Training (arXiv 2511.01689) on Tinker: constitution → DPO distillation → SFT introspection → LoRA merge → Elo eval, plus a dense-vs-MoE scaling study. First-party code lives in `octt/`. `tinker-cookbook/` and `tinker-project-ideas/` are vendored upstream (Thinking Machines): treat them as read-only, and don't apply their CI or stricter lint rules to `octt/`. The project implements `tinker-project-ideas/replicate-open-character-training.md` plus its model-scaling extension.

## Commands

```bash
uv run pytest                               # all tests (offline/dry-run by design; no API keys needed)
uv run pytest tests/test_merge.py -k name   # single test
uv run ruff check                           # lint (line-length 100)
octt preflight --dry-run                    # cost/config gate — EXPECTED to exit 2 (Ultra rank64 blocked)
scripts/octt_plan.sh local                  # cheap pre-spend gate: tests + ruff + preflight assertions
```

Use `uv` for env/deps (`uv sync --all-extras`). Heavy deps are optional extras (`train`, `local-eval`, `capabilities`); use plain `lighteval`, never `lighteval[adapters]` (PEFT version conflict).

## Cost safety

- `octt run` / `octt scaling` are dry-run by default; `--execute` spends real Tinker money. Never add `--execute` unless the user explicitly asks. Route paid runs through `scripts/octt_plan.sh` phases (disk-gated, resumable, skip-if-done) — see `docs/COST_CONTROLS.md`.
- Secrets live in gitignored `.env`: `TINKER_API_KEY` (paid runs), `HF_TOKEN`.
- Local adapter merges need ~4× adapter size in free disk; check `scripts/octt_disk_budget.py` before merge phases.

## Code patterns

- `octt/config.py` and `octt/models.py` must stay side-effect-free — the recipe is held constant across the scaling study.
- Lazy-import heavy deps (`tinker`, `torch`, `transformers`, `peft`, `datasets`) inside functions: the package must import and tests must pass without the training stack installed.
- Keep the chat renderer identical across DPO pair-gen, introspection, SFT, and eval, with reasoning OFF for hybrid models — otherwise Elo measures template mismatch, not character.
- Nemotron Ultra is LoRA rank-capped at 32 (`octt/models.py`). `octt scaling` applies the uniform study policy (rank 32, lr 1e-4 — `config.for_scaling_study`) unless `--lora-rank` is passed explicitly; `octt run`/PAPER keep the paper-stated rank 64. Ultra additionally needs `--no-merge` (base weights too large to merge locally).

## Gotchas

- `deploy/` contains only orphaned `.pyc` bytecode with no source — dead code, ignore it.
