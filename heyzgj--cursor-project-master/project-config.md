# 100 · Core Engine: Plan → Scaffold → Execute

---
## PHASE 1: PROJECT INITIALIZATION
> This phase runs ONLY ONCE at the start of a project when `/project/plan.json` is absent.

1.  **REQUIREMENT VALIDATION**
    - Read all documents in `/docs`.
    - **MANDATORY CHECK:** If `PRD.md` is missing core features, or `TECH_SPEC.md` is missing `techStack` details, you **MUST PAUSE** and ask the user for clarification. Do not proceed with incomplete specifications.

2.  **TECH STACK & STARTER SELECTION**
    - Detect `techStack` from `TECH_SPEC.md`. Default to `nextjs-prisma-tailwind-shadcn-supabase-vercel`.
    - **Use your search capability** to find the official starter template on Vercel or GitHub for the selected stack. Prioritize templates with high star counts and recent updates.
    - If new or unfamiliar frameworks are specified, use the `context7` MCP to fetch their latest official documentation to inform the scaffolding process.

3.  **SCAFFOLDING**
    - Execute the starter's official CLI command with non-interactive flags (e.g., `npx create-next-app@latest ... --ts --tailwind`).
    - **On Failure:** If scaffolding fails, automatically clean the directory, log the error in `TROUBLESHOOTING_LOG.md`, and prompt the user with the error details.
    - **On Success:** Clean any demo files/routes to create a blank canvas including starter readme file and change meta data to project version. Run `npx tailwindcss init -p` if necessary.

4.  **DECOMPOSITION (PLAN GENERATION)**
    - **INPUT:** Concatenate all files from `/docs` into a single context string.
    - **PROMPT:**
        <START_LLM_PROMPT>
        **Role:** You are a Principal Technical Program Manager specializing in breaking down product briefs for autonomous software agents.
        **Mission:** Convert the provided project documentation into a precise, machine-readable JSON work-plan. The output MUST be a valid JSON object and nothing else.
        **Output Schema:**
        ```jsonc
        {
          "epics": [{"id": "E-1", "title": "...", "children": ["T-1"]}],
          "tasks": [{"id": "T-1", "epic": "E-1", "title": "...", "description": "...", "criteria": ["..."], "dependencies": [], "ui_review": true}]
        }
        ```
        **Rules:**
        - Task titles MUST be imperative (e.g., "Implement Login API").
        - Task descriptions MUST be concise (≤ 140 chars).
        - The dependency graph MUST be acyclic.
        - Split any task whose `criteria` list exceeds 5 items.
        - **If `ui_review: true`, the generated task file MUST contain a `design_review: pending` flag.**
        <END_LLM_PROMPT>
    - **OUTPUT:**
        a. Save the generated JSON to `/project/plan.json`.
        b. For each task in the JSON, create a corresponding markdown file in `/project/tasks/todo/` using the `/project/_templates/task.md` template.
        c. Commit the plan and tasks with `git commit -m "chore(plan): initial project decomposition"`.
    - **KANBAN**
        a. Initialize Kanban: 
            1. cd kanban && npm install
            2. npm run dev

5.  **INITIALIZATION COMPLETE**
    - Generate the `/project/project_status.md` dashboard.
    - Activate the first task by moving it to `/project/tasks/in_progress/`.
    - Report to the user: "Planning and setup are complete. I will now begin work on task T-1: [Task Title]."

---
## PHASE 2: TASK EXECUTION LOOP
> This is the main work loop. It continues until `/project/tasks/todo/` and `/project/tasks/in_progress/` are both empty.

For the active task `T<ID>` in `/project/tasks/in_progress/`:

A. **LOAD CONTEXT & PREPARE**
   - Read the task file `T<ID>.md`.
   - Load ONLY the files listed in its `Context Binding`.
   - If the task has `design_review: pending`, PAUSE and ask the user for a visual sign-off before writing code. Proceed only after user approval.

B. **EXECUTE & VERIFY (TDD CYCLE)**
   - Strictly adhere to the `200-quality.mdc` rule for TDD, contract-first development, and linting.
   - Run `npm run test` (or equivalent) repeatedly until all tests for the current task pass.

C. **CI/CD GATE**
   - After local tests pass, commit and push the code to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
   - **Monitor the CI result.**
   - **If CI fails due to missing secrets** (e.g., `VERCEL_TOKEN`), PAUSE and prompt the user to add them via GitHub Secrets, referencing the `README.md` guide.
   - **If CI fails for any other reason**, mark the task as failed, log the failure, and trigger the `300-adaptation.mdc` failure-reflection loop.

D. **ARCHIVE & REPORT**
   - **On Green CI:**
     a. Archive the completed task: `mkdir -p ./project/tasks/done/$(date +%Y-Q%q) && mv ./project/tasks/in_progress/T<ID>.md ./project/tasks/done/$(date +%Y-Q%q)/`
     b. Update the task file's internal status to `Done`.
     c. Run `python scripts/report.py` if a reporting milestone is reached (epic complete or 5 tasks done).

E. **SELECT NEXT TASK & REPEAT**
   - Update `/project/project_status.md`.
   - Identify the next available task from `/project/tasks/todo/` whose dependencies are met.
   - Activate it by moving it to `/project/tasks/in_progress/`.
