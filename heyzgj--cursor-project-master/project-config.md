# 300 · Adaptation Engine: Research, Reflect, Resolve

## CONTEXT
This rule set is invoked when the agent encounters situations beyond standard execution: unknown technologies or persistent failures. It provides a multi-layered strategy for adaptation and problem-solving.

---
### PROTOCOL A: PROACTIVE KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION (Research Spike)

- **TRIGGER:** When a task requires using a technology not detailed in `/docs/TECH_SPEC.md` or for which the agent lacks high confidence.
- **ACTION:**
    1.  **PAUSE** the current implementation task.
    2.  **CREATE** a new task with `type: research` in `/project/tasks/todo/`. The task's goal is to produce a summary of best practices for the unknown technology.
    3.  **EXECUTE** the research task, utilizing built-in search and any available `@context` MCPs to study official documentation.
    4.  **LOG DECISION:** The primary deliverable of the research task is a new, detailed entry in `/docs/DECISION_LOG.md` (ADR format), documenting the chosen approach, key findings, and code examples.
    5.  **RESUME** the original implementation task, now grounded with new knowledge.

---
### PROTOCOL B: STRATEGIC DECISION LOGGING (ADR)

- **TRIGGER:** After any non-trivial architectural choice, library selection, or resolution of a complex trade-off.
- **ACTION:** You **MUST** append a new, timestamped entry to `/docs/DECISION_LOG.md`. The log entry must be concise but comprehensive, following the ADR template. This is a non-negotiable step for ensuring project traceability.

---
### PROTOCOL C: HIERARCHICAL FAILURE RESOLUTION
> This protocol is a state machine triggered by the `attempts` counter, which is managed by the **100-engine** on each failed test run for a given task.

**Level 1: Simple Patch & Retry (`attempts` < 3)**
- **ACTION:** Attempt to fix the bug directly based on the test failure output. If the stack trace includes a `file:line`, prioritize a targeted patch on that line (Execution-Guided Line Patch).

**Level 2: Self-Reflection (`attempts` == 3)**
- **ACTION:**
    1.  **PAUSE** implementation attempts.
    2.  **REFLECT:** Generate a structured reflection note.
        ```markdown
        <<REFLECTION_NOTE>>
        **Problem:** A brief summary of the failing test.
        **Root Cause Analysis:** My hypothesis for why the previous attempts failed.
        **Next Strategy:** A new, alternative approach to solve the problem.
        <</REFLECTION_NOTE>>
    3.  **SELF-SCORE (R³):** Append a `self_score: [1-5]` to the reflection, rating your confidence in the new strategy. If the score is ≤ 3, you must regenerate the reflection with a different strategy.
    4.  **LOG:** Append the final, high-scoring reflection note to `/docs/DECISION_LOG.md`.
    5.  **RETRY:** Prepend the reflection note to your next implementation prompt and resume attempts.

**Level 3: Competitive Self-Duel (`attempts` == 5)**
- **ACTION:**
    1.  **PAUSE** all other approaches.
    2.  **INITIATE DUEL:** In a single prompt, instruct yourself to act as two independent expert coders, `Coder A (using Strategy A)` and `Coder B (using Strategy B)`. Generate two distinct patches for the problem.
    3.  **SELF-CRITIQUE:** After generating both patches, provide a critique of the pros and cons of each.
    4.  **JUDGE:** Select the winning patch based on your critique.
    5.  **APPLY & LOG:** Apply the winning patch and log the entire duel (both patches and the critique) to `/docs/DECISION_LOG.md`.
    6.  **RESET & RETRY:** Reset the `attempts` counter to 0 and re-run the tests with the winning patch.

**Level 4: Escalation (`attempts` > 5 or after a failed Duel)**
- **ACTION:**
    1.  **HALT:** Stop all implementation attempts for this task.
    2.  **BLOCK TASK:** Move the task file from `/project/tasks/in_progress/` to `/project/tasks/blocked/`.
    3.  **REPORT TO HUMAN:** Update `project_status.md` to show the task is blocked. Clearly state the problem, link to the relevant entries in `/docs/DECISION_LOG.md`, and explicitly ask for human guidance. You may suggest creating a new research task or simplifying the requirement.
