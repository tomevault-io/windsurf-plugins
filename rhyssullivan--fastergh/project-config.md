# Import Rules

## Cross-Package Imports

Do not use relative paths when importing across packages. Always use package imports instead.

- ❌ `import { something } from "../../../packages/database"`
- ✅ `import { something } from "@packages/database"`

## Self-Imports

Do not import from a package within itself.

- ❌ `import { Button } from "@packages/ui"` inside `packages/ui/`
- ✅ Use relative imports within the same package
