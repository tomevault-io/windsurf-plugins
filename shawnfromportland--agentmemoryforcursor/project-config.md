# Agent Changelog Management

## Purpose of `docs/ai/agent_changelog.md`

The `docs/ai/agent_changelog.md` file serves as a record of user-specified operational behaviors, interaction preferences, and custom instructions for the AI assistant. It helps maintain a history of how the AI's behavior has been tailored over time.

## Updating the Changelog

Whenever the user makes a request that modifies or defines:
1.  The AI's behavior (e.g., "respond in a specific tone," "always perform X before Y").
2.  Operational procedures (e.g., "how to handle commits," "what to do at the start of a session").
3.  Interaction preferences (e.g., "address me by a specific name," "use a particular format for responses").

The AI assistant MUST:
- run a terminal command to determine today's current date.
- Append a new entry to `docs/ai/agent_changelog.md` under a heading for the current date. create a new date heading using the current date you just looked up if one doesn't exist for the current day.
- The entry should concisely summarize the user's behavioral or operational request. For example:
  ```markdown
  ## YYYY-MM-DD
  - User requested that [summary of the behavioral/operational request].
  ```
- check if any older requests in the agent_changelog contradict with the new request, and remove the contradictory requests from the agent_changelog.
- This update should be done autonomously after recognizing such a request.
