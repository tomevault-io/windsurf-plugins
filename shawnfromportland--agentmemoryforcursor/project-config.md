# Rule Name: Git Workflow Automation

## Description:
This rule outlines how the AI assistant should handle requests to commit or discard changes using the custom npm scripts. The goal is to streamline the development workflow by automating these common Git operations based on natural language commands from the user.

### Committing Changes

1.  **Trigger**:
    *   For commit ONLY (local): User asks to "commit," "commit changes," "commit this," "commit the latest," or similar explicit phrasing indicating a desire to save work locally.
    *   For commit AND PUSH: User asks to "commit and push," "save and sync," or similar explicit phrasing indicating a desire to save work and update the remote repository.
    *   For PUSH ONLY: User asks to "push," "push changes," "sync remote," or similar explicit phrasing indicating a desire to update the remote repository with already committed changes.

2.  **Clarify Ambiguity (If Necessary)**:
    *   If the user's request to commit (from Trigger) is vague or could be interpreted in multiple ways (e.g., "should we save this?"), the AI MUST first seek clarification: "It sounds like you might want to commit the changes. Is that correct?"
    *   If clarification was sought and the user confirms they *do not* want to commit, the process stops here. The subsequent steps are only followed if the intent to commit is clear (either initially explicit or clarified as such).

3.  **Generate Commit Message and Detailed Changelog Content**:
    *   The AI will silently review changes made during the current interactive session leading up to the commit request.
    *   The AI will generate a concise, conventional commit message (e.g., "feat: Implement user authentication flow").
    *   The AI will also generate a list of key changes/features/fixes from the session as bullet points.
    *   The AI will format this as a markdown block: the commit message as `### Title`, followed by the bullet points.
        Example:
        ```markdown
        ### feat: New user dashboard and API refactor
        - Created `UserDashboard.tsx` with initial metrics display.
        - Modified `/api/users` endpoint to support pagination.
        - Refactored `AuthService` to use JWT tokens.
        ```

4.  **Handle Commit Execution Based on Initial Command Clarity**:
    *   **Path A: Explicit Initial Command (No Ambiguity Clarification Was Needed in Step 2)**
        *   If the user's initial command (from Trigger) was explicit and unambiguous, the AI will use the auto-generated message from Step 3 and immediately proceed to Step 5 (Execute Commit). No confirmation of the message content is sought from the user before execution.
    *   **Path B: Command Clarified as Commit (Ambiguity Was Resolved in Step 2)**
        *   If the user's initial command was vague, and the AI successfully clarified in Step 2 that the user *does* want to commit:
            *   The AI MUST present the auto-generated commit message (from Step 3) to the user for approval or modification. For example: "Proposed commit message: 'feat: Updated X and Y'. Is this okay, or would you like to change it?"
            *   The AI proceeds to Step 5 (Execute Commit) only after the user explicitly approves or modifies the message. If the user rejects the message and provides no alternative, or cancels the action, the commit is not executed.

5.  **Prepare Changelog and Execute Commit**:
    *   The AI MUST write the generated detailed markdown changelog content (from Step 3) to the file `scripts/.tmp_changelog_content.md`. This step MUST occur *before* executing the npm script.
    *   If the trigger was for commit ONLY: The AI will execute the command: `npm run git:commit -- "<commit_message>"`
        *   (Where `<commit_message>` is the concise conventional message from Step 3, Path A or Path B).
    *   The AI will inform the user of the successful local commit.
    *   If the trigger was for commit AND PUSH: The AI will execute the command: `npm run git:commit:push -- "<commit_message>"`
        *   (Where `<commit_message>` is the concise conventional message from Step 3, Path A or Path B).
    *   The AI will inform the user of the successful commit and push.
    *   If Path A was taken (auto-generated message used without prior user confirmation of content), the AI MUST also inform the user of the commit message that was used. E.g., "Committed with message: 'feat: ...'" or "Committed and pushed with message: 'feat: ...'".

### Pushing Changes (Without New Commit)

1.  **Trigger**: When the user asks to "push," "push changes," "sync remote," or uses similar explicit phrasing indicating a desire to update the remote repository with already committed local changes (and it's clear no new commit is intended or needed).
2.  **Action - Execute Push**:
    *   The AI will directly execute the command: `npm run git:push`
    *   The AI will inform the user of the successful push.
3.  **Ambiguity**:
    *   If the user's request to push is vague (e.g., "update the server?") and it's unclear if a commit is also needed, the AI should clarify, e.g., "Do you want to commit new changes and then push, or just push existing commits?"

### Discarding Changes (Rollback)
