# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

All project management goes through `uv` — never pip directly.

```bash
uv sync                                  # base install (mock backend only, no GPU/model deps)
uv sync --extra qwen3                    # adds torch/transformers/qwen-tts for the Qwen3 backend

uv run pytest                            # full suite (must pass with no GPU and no model downloads)
uv run pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -v  # one file
uv run pytest tests/test_pipeline.py::test_idle_timeout_raises -v  # one test

uv run uvicorn tts_server.main:app --port 8000   # run server (mock backend by default)
TTS_BACKEND=qwen3 uv run uvicorn tts_server.main:app --port 8000

uv run python benchmarks/bench_http.py --backend mock --concurrency 5 --requests 20
uv run python benchmarks/bench_ws.py --backend mock --requests 5
```

Config precedence: defaults → YAML (`TTS_CONFIG` env or `./config.yaml`) → env overrides (`TTS_BACKEND`, `TTS_HOST`, `TTS_PORT`, `TTS_DEVICE`). See `config.example.yaml`.

## Architecture

Single-process asyncio FastAPI server. One backend is active per process, resolved by name from `backends/registry.py` (a name → `"module:Class"` dict with **lazy imports** — selecting `mock` must never import `qwen3`'s heavy deps; a test enforces this) and loaded once in the FastAPI lifespan (`main.py`), with warmup and graceful `close()` on shutdown.

The flow every request takes:

- **Three API surfaces** (`api/openai_compat.py`, `api/elevenlabs_compat.py`, `api/native.py`) all funnel into the same two entry points in `streaming/pipeline.py`:
  - `run_stream()` — async generator wrapping any backend stream with a bounded queue (backpressure), per-chunk idle timeout, producer cancellation on client disconnect, and metrics. Cancellation (`GeneratorExit`/`CancelledError`) is deliberately *not* counted as a failure and records no latency.
  - `synthesize_once()` — the non-streaming path (WAV, `stream=false`); applies the same timeout + metrics. Do not call `backend.synthesize()` directly from an API handler.
- **Backends** subclass `TTSBackend` (`backends/base.py`): implement `load`/`synthesize`/`close`; `synthesize_stream` has an emulated default (full synthesis re-sliced into chunks). Blocking model inference must go through `asyncio.to_thread` — handlers are asyncio-native.
- **WebSocket endpoints** share `StreamInputSession` + `run_ws_session` in `streaming/websocket.py` (buffering vs. per-segment synthesis depends on `supports_streaming_input`; malformed input → close 1003; `TTSServerError` → error message then close 1011). Don't duplicate the receive loop in a new WS endpoint — reuse `run_ws_session`.
- **Errors**: raise `TTSServerError` subclasses (`errors.py`); the app-level handler in `main.py` maps them to `{"error": {code, message, capabilities?}}` with the right status. `UnsupportedFeatureError` should carry the backend's capabilities.

## The honesty rule (project-defining constraint)

Capability metadata (`TTSCapabilities`) must describe only what the code actually does. Emulated streaming is labeled `streaming_mode="emulated"` (the base-class default); only backends that genuinely pace/generate chunks incrementally may claim `"native"`. This extends to docs and benchmarks: README claims must match implemented behavior, and benchmark results from the mock backend are auto-labeled "mock backend — synthetic audio, not real model inference" (`benchmarks/common.py`) — never present mock numbers as real model performance.

## Backend status caveats

- `Qwen3TTSBackend` is **verified on real CUDA hardware** (NVIDIA A10, 24 GB, bf16, torch 2.12.1+cu130, qwen-tts 0.1.1; report + artifacts: `reports/2026-08-20/`). It uses the `qwen-tts` package's `Qwen3TTSModel.generate_custom_voice()` API. Default model is `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice` (realtime-first; 1.7B via `backend.model_path` — only 1.7B honors `instruct`, and the emotion/style capability is adjusted per loaded model accordingly). Real-numbers summary (single stream, c=1, 30 req, 0 fail): **RTF p90 0.58 / TTFA p90 9.8 s** with the default `fast_subtalker` path, RTF p90 1.47 stock; ~4.2 GB device memory; concurrency serialized by an explicit `_infer_lock`. `fast_subtalker` (`backends/qwen3_fast.py`) replaces qwen-tts's nested per-frame HF `generate()` on the 5-layer code predictor with a hand-rolled KV-cache loop captured as one CUDA graph — semantics preserved (same sampling), capture failure falls back to the eager loop. Reproduce: `uv sync --extra qwen3 && TTS_BACKEND=qwen3 uv run python scripts/gpu_validate.py`, then `bench_http.py`/`gpu_smoke.py` per the report. Install constraints live in the `[qwen3]` extra and matter: `numba>=0.59` (else llvmlite won't build on py3.12) and `torch>=2.4,<2.13` (2.13's triton stack references a `bmm_outer_product.triton_kernels` module it doesn't ship, so generation fails). Its tests still run without torch by design (they exercise the missing-dep and not-loaded paths). Keep it importable without torch: heavy imports live inside methods.
