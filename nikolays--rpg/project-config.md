# CLAUDE.md — Rpg

## Project

rpg — modern Postgres terminal with built-in diagnostics and AI assistant. Repo: NikolayS/rpg.

## Style rules

Follow the shared rules at https://gitlab.com/postgres-ai/rules/-/tree/main/rules — key rules summarized below.

### SQL style (development__db-sql-style-guide)

- Lowercase SQL keywords — `select`, `from`, `where`, not `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`
- `snake_case` for all identifiers
- Root keywords on their own line; arguments indented below
- `AND`/`OR` at the beginning of the line
- Always use `AS` for aliases; use meaningful alias names
- Use CTEs over nested subqueries
- Functions as identifiers: `date_trunc()`, not `DATE_TRUNC()`
- ISO 8601 dates: `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss`
- Plural table names (`users`, `blog_posts`), `_id` suffix for FKs

```sql
-- Correct
select
    t.client_id as client_id,
    date(t.created_at) as day
from telemetry as t
inner join users as u
    on t.user_id = u.id
where
    t.submission_date > '2019-07-01'
    and t.sample_id = '10'
group by
    t.client_id,
    day;
```

### DB schema design (development__db-schema-design-guide)

- Primary keys: `int8 generated always as identity`
- Prefer `timestamptz` over `timestamp`, `text` over `varchar`
- Store money as cents (`int8`), never use `money` type
- Always add `comment on table` / `comment on column`
- Lowercase keywords, proper spacing

### Shell style (development__shell-style-guide)

Every script must start with:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -Eeuo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'
```

- 2-space indent, no tabs
- 80 char line limit
- Quote all variable expansions; prefer `${var}` over `$var`
- `[[ ]]` over `[ ]`; `$(command)` over backticks
- Errors to STDERR; use `trap cleanup EXIT`
- `lower_case` functions and variables; `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- Scripts with functions must have `main()` at bottom, last line: `main "$@"`

### PostgreSQL command execution (development__postgres-command-execution)

- Always use `--no-psqlrc` and `PAGER=cat`
- Prefer long options, one per line with `\` continuation
- Use `timeout` with `kubectl exec` to prevent hanging
- Avoid `-it` flags for non-interactive queries

```bash
timeout 10 kubectl exec pod-name -n namespace -- \
  env PAGER=cat psql \
    --no-psqlrc \
    --username=postgres \
    --dbname=mydb \
    --command="select version()"
```

### Git commits (development__git-commit-standards)

- Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `ops:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, etc.
- Scope encouraged: `feat(auth): add OAuth`
- Subject < 50 chars, body lines < 72 chars
- Present tense ("add" not "added")
- Never amend — create new commits
- Never force-push unless explicitly confirmed

### Units and timestamps

- Binary units in docs/reports: GiB, MiB, KiB (not GB, MB, KB)
- Exception: PostgreSQL config values use PG format (`shared_buffers = '32GB'`)
- Dynamic UI: relative timestamps with ISO 8601 hover tooltip
- Static content: absolute timestamps `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss UTC`

## Testing approach — red/green TDD

Use red/green TDD, especially for bug fixes but also for new features:

1. **Red** — write a failing test (or identify an existing failing test case) that
   reproduces the bug or specifies the new behavior. Confirm it fails.
2. **Green** — write the minimal code to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor** — clean up while keeping tests green.

For bug fixes this is mandatory: every fix must include a test that would have
caught the bug. For new features it is strongly encouraged — write the test
first when practical, or immediately after the implementation when the test
setup is complex.

When fixing psql compatibility gaps, the psql regression test suite serves as
the "red" phase — a failing diff is the test. The fix makes the diff disappear.

## PR workflow (mandatory for all agents)

Every PR must go through this sequence before merge — no exceptions:

1. **CI green** — all GitHub Actions checks pass
2. **REV review** — run `/review-mr <PR-URL>` and get no BLOCKING issues
   - REV is the parallel AI review system: https://gitlab.com/postgres-ai/rev/
   - For GitHub PRs: fetch diff with `gh pr diff <number> --repo NikolayS/rpg`, then run the review agents (security, bugs, tests, guidelines, docs) and post the report as a PR comment
   - A review with only NON-BLOCKING / POTENTIAL / INFO findings is a **pass**
   - Any BLOCKING finding must be fixed first, then re-review
3. **Merge** — squash merge: `gh pr merge <number> --squash --repo NikolayS/rpg`

**SOC2 findings:** REV may flag missing reviewer or linked issue — ignore SOC2
findings, they are not blocking for this project.

**Copyright:** always `Copyright 2026` — never a year range.like `2024-2026`.

## Architecture

See `docs/blueprints/SPEC.md` for the full specification. Key concepts:

- **Modern Postgres terminal** — psql replacement with DBA diagnostics and AI assistant
- **AI via slash commands** — `/ask`, `/fix`, `/explain`, `/optimize`
- **`/dba` diagnostics** — built-in DBA commands for bloat, vacuuming, index health, wait events
- **Language:** Rust
- **Wire protocol:** tokio-postgres
- **PG support:** 14-18

## Command namespace convention

See `docs/COMMANDS.md` for the full reference.
