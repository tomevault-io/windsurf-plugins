# donat

A GraphQL engine over Postgres, compatible with the Donat v2 surface
(metadata format, API shape), developed TDD-style against a native
conformance harness with Donat-derived fixtures (`crates/conformance`).

## Tech Stack

Rust workspace (axum, tokio, serde, insta), Postgres 16 (postgis), native
conformance harness (`crates/conformance`).

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `crates/metadata` | Donat v2 metadata types + YAML directory loader (`!include`) |
| `crates/catalog` | Postgres introspection (pg_catalog) |
| `crates/schema` | Per-role GraphQL schema generation, introspection |
| `crates/ir` | Intermediate representation — the SQL-free boundary |
| `crates/sqlgen` | IR → one Postgres SQL statement (insta snapshot tests) |
| `crates/server` | axum server: `/v1/graphql` (+ws), relay, `/api/rest` (RESTified endpoints), `/mcp` (MCP server), auth; `migrate`/`validate`. No runtime admin/`run_sql` API (deleted) |
| `crates/conformance` | Native conformance harness + fixtures (the conformance source of truth) |
| `knowledgebase/` | Design notes and ADRs (Obsidian-style, see `_index.md`) |
| `PLAN.md` | Architecture, milestones, decision log |

## Commands

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Build | `make build` |
| Unit/snapshot tests | `make test` (or `cargo test -p <crate>`) |
| Run with fixture metadata | `make run` (serves :8080) |
| Apply schema migrations (DDL) | `donat migrate --migrations-dir migrations` (refinery) |
| Validate metadata vs DB | `donat validate --metadata-dir <dir>` (non-zero exit on inconsistency) |
| Conformance suite | `make conformance` (or `cargo test -p donat-conformance [--test <module>]`) |
| Review snapshot changes | `cargo insta review` |
| Format and lint gates (CI blocks on both) | `cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` |
| Inspect one Process instance | `donat process inspect --source <name> --instance <uuid>` (read-only) |
| Check one instance's history | `donat process verify-history --source <name> --instance <uuid>` (read-only, non-zero exit on inconsistency) |

The conformance harness needs Postgres (`postgis/postgis:16-3.4`) at
`PG_URL` (default `postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:15432/postgres`).
It builds/spawns the engine itself — REBUILD `cargo build -p donat-server
--bin donat` after engine changes before re-running conformance, the
harness uses the existing binary. One database per suite (`conf_<name>`),
parallel-safe. Conventions: `crates/conformance/PORTING.md`.

## The TDD Loop (how all engine work is done)

1. Engine-behavior changes start from a failing conformance case: a fixture
   in `crates/conformance/fixtures` + a call in `crates/conformance/tests/`.
2. Implement; add/adjust unit + insta tests in the touched crate.
3. `cargo build -p donat-server --bin donat && cargo test -p
   donat-conformance --test <module>` until green; then run the full
   conformance crate — suites share engine semantics and regress together.
4. Fixtures are ground truth (exact bodies, error codes, paths, status).
   Local fixture edits are allowed ONLY for documented known-diffs and must
   carry a `# donat:` comment (see fixtures/README.md).

Quirks to remember: some fixtures `!include` files as quoted strings;
legacy `$op` permission spellings are valid input; three insert fixtures
expect status 400 with bodies identical to our deliberate 200 — they are
patched copies with comments, do not "fix" the engine to 400. The legacy
pytest harness only WARNED on error-body mismatches; the native harness is
strict — pytest greenness is not evidence of exact conformance.

## BLOCKING RULE: No Admin Role

**This engine has no admin role.** Only classic explicit roles work — every
data access goes through an explicit per-role permission. There is no
permission-bypass role and no admin-over-HTTP surface at all: the runtime
admin/management API (`run_sql`, metadata mutation) was deleted, and the
admin DATA role (the `ADMIN_ROLE` permission bypass) was removed too. A
trusted request with no `X-Donat-Role` is denied ("x-donat-role header is
required"); `X-Donat-Admin-Secret` is API-level auth only. Any diff that
re-introduces an admin role or permission bypass must be rejected.
Configuration is deploy-time: `migrate` (DDL) + YAML metadata at boot.

## BLOCKING RULE: Knowledgebase First

Read relevant `knowledgebase/` files BEFORE analyzing, planning, or
implementing. `ls knowledgebase/` + `grep -ri "topic" knowledgebase/`;
check `knowledgebase/<domain>/decisions/` — ADRs explain *why*. Plans or
code written without this are invalid and must be redone. After work with
meaningful trade-offs, capture an ADR (template:
`knowledgebase/_templates/decision.md`).

## Quality Review at Feature Completion

There is no per-commit review gate. Each TDD slice must still have its focused
test evidence and the required suite verification. Run one independent code
review for the complete, cohesive feature range before it is merged, handed
off, or declared ready. Address material findings with a regression test and
fresh verification before completion.

## Essential Rules

- **Repo content in English** (docs, comments, specs, ADRs). Chat language
  may differ; the repo never does.
