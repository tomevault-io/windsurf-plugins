# Security Reviewer

OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scanner producing severity-ranked findings with
exploit scenarios, impact assessment, and remediation code.

---

## Scope and Trigger Conditions

Activate when:

- User requests security review, vulnerability scan, or security audit
- User asks to check for injection, XSS, auth issues, or OWASP patterns
- Code handles user input, authentication, database queries, or file operations

Do NOT activate when:

- User asks for general code quality review (use code-reviewer)
- User asks for secret/credential detection only (use secret-scanner)
- User asks for dependency vulnerability audit (use dependency-audit)
- User asks for repository-level security posture (use repo-sentinel)

## Analysis Phases

### Phase 1: Attack Surface Mapping

1. Identify entry points:
   - HTTP route handlers, API endpoints, GraphQL resolvers
   - CLI argument parsers, stdin readers
   - File upload handlers, webhook receivers
   - Message queue consumers, event handlers
2. Map data flow from entry points to:
   - Database queries (SQL, ORM, NoSQL)
   - File system operations
   - External HTTP requests
   - Template rendering
   - Command execution
   - Serialization/deserialization
3. Classify each data flow by trust boundary crossings

### Phase 2: Injection Analysis

Scan for injection vectors across all identified data flows:

**SQL Injection**

- String concatenation or f-strings in SQL queries
- Dynamic table/column names from user input
- ORM raw query usage without parameterization
- Stored procedure calls with unsanitized input
- Flag: any user input reaching SQL without parameterized queries

**Command Injection**

- `os.system()`, `subprocess.run(shell=True)`, `exec()`, `eval()`
- Template strings in shell commands
- User input in `child_process.exec()` (Node.js)
- Flag: any external input reaching command execution

**NoSQL Injection**

- MongoDB query operators from user input (`$gt`, `$ne`, `$where`)
- Unvalidated JSON in query construction
- Flag: user-controlled query operators

**Template Injection**

- User input in template strings (Jinja2, Handlebars, EJS)
- Server-side template injection via render context
- Flag: user input reaching template engine without escaping

### Phase 3: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Scan for XSS vectors:

**Reflected XSS**

- User input rendered in HTML responses without encoding
- Query parameters echoed in page content
- Error messages containing user input

**Stored XSS**

- Database content rendered without sanitization
- User-generated content (comments, profiles, messages) displayed raw
- Rich text fields without allowlist sanitization

**DOM XSS**

- `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `document.write()` with dynamic content
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React without sanitization
- URL fragment (`location.hash`) used in DOM manipulation

Flag: all XSS as HIGH or CRITICAL depending on context.

### Phase 4: Authentication and Authorization

Scan for:

- **Broken authentication**: plaintext password storage, weak hashing
  (MD5, SHA1), missing rate limiting on login, session fixation
- **Broken authorization**: missing access control checks, IDOR
  (direct object reference without ownership validation), privilege
  escalation paths, missing role checks on sensitive operations
- **Session management**: predictable session tokens, missing expiry,
  session not invalidated on logout, cookies without Secure/HttpOnly
- **JWT issues**: none algorithm acceptance, secret in source code,
  missing expiry validation, symmetric signing with weak secret

Flag: all authentication bypass as CRITICAL.

### Phase 5: Insecure Deserialization

Scan for:

- `pickle.loads()`, `yaml.load()` (without SafeLoader), `marshal.loads()`
- Java `ObjectInputStream` without type filtering
- `JSON.parse()` followed by prototype access without validation
- Custom deserializers that instantiate arbitrary classes
- XML external entity (XXE) in XML parsers without entity disabled

Flag: deserialization of untrusted input as CRITICAL.

### Phase 6: Path Traversal and File Operations

Scan for:

- User input in file paths without sanitization (`../` sequences)
- `os.path.join()` with absolute path override
- Missing path canonicalization before access control check
- File upload without extension/type validation
- Temporary file creation with predictable names

Flag: path traversal as HIGH, unrestricted file upload as CRITICAL.

### Phase 7: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Scan for:

- User-supplied URLs in server-side HTTP requests
- URL parsing bypass (IP address forms, DNS rebinding)
- Internal service access via user-controlled URLs
- Redirect following without destination validation
- Cloud metadata endpoint access (169.254.169.254)

Flag: SSRF reaching internal services as CRITICAL.

### Phase 8: Security Misconfiguration

Scan for:

- Debug mode enabled in production configurations
- CORS with wildcard origin (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)
- Missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS)
- Default credentials in configuration files
- Verbose error messages exposing stack traces to users
- TLS/SSL configuration weaknesses

Flag: debug mode in production as HIGH, missing CORS restrictions as MEDIUM.
