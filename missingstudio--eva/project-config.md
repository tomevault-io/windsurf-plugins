# Eva
An autonomous, AI-native software factory.
The workers of this factory are agents. You are one of them.

## Done means verified

**Evidence, not claims.** A report of success is not success. Eva re-runs the checks
on every harness that claims a green run, and the same rule binds you.

A task is complete when all four are true:

1. `make verify` ran.
2. The behaviour the task asked for is verified — not the behaviour you built.
3. You read the full diff, and meant every hunk.
4. The diff carries no secret, credential, or tenant data.

`make verify` is exactly what CI checks on every change. It is `make check`, which
needs nothing but this repository, plus `make audit`, which reaches the network — so
its answer can change while the tree does not, and CI runs it on a schedule for that
reason. The Makefile declares both lists and `make check-coverage` fails when no
workflow a commit reaches runs one of them, so neither can quietly check less than
the other. `make help` lists the targets.

One thing CI runs that `make verify` does not: `make rehearse`, the release path
without a tag. It builds every archive and installs from what it built, which is
what proves the install script asks for the name the build wrote. It is not a check because
it compiles five targets and downloads a release tool, so CI runs it when a change
can reach the release path. Run it yourself when you touch the Makefile,
`.goreleaser.yaml`, `scripts/`, or a workflow. Only signing is still tag-time:
keyless signing needs an OIDC token that no laptop has.

When a check does not run, the report is **degraded**: name what did not run, and
why. A degraded report is a valid outcome. An unrun check reported as a passing one
poisons the only instrument this project has, and nothing recovers from that.

## Never

These outrank every other rule here.

- **A secret stays out of the record.** Credentials enter at the env boundary and
  never reach a trace, a log, or a context window. Tests hold this today; keep them
  passing.
- **Tenant and Actor ride on every record**, from commit one, before a second tenant
  exists.
- **A layer imports only what its allow list names.** `make lint` runs `depguard` in
  strict mode, so an unlisted import fails the build. A new layer needs a new
  `.golangci.yml` rule.

Cross-tenant escape is the one failure that ends the business. No SQL or datastore
exists yet, so the query-level rules land with the first one — read
`docs/reference/platform.md` before you write it.

## While you work

- Change only what the task names.
- Prefer the small reversible change to the large correct-looking one.
- Reuse the pattern already in the repo. A second way to do one thing is a cost the
  task must justify.
- A behaviour change and its doc update land in the same commit.
- A comment states its decision in its own words, and names no document. Name the
  glossary term or the decision, never the file holding it.

## How you write

Every word this repository ships is **ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English**. It
binds commit messages, documents, code comments, CLI text, and your reports alike.
The rules that carry the weight here:

- One topic per sentence. No sentence runs over 25 words.
- Active voice. Name the thing that acts.
- Keep the articles. Never delete a word to make a line shorter.
- One word carries one meaning. A word means what it says, never what it evokes.
- A Technical Name is exempt from the vocabulary rule: `Event`, `Trace`,
  `Provider`, `Recorder`, `cask`, `epoll`.

A commit subject obeys that rule, and three limits of its own:

- A conventional prefix opens it: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`,
  `build`, `ci`, `chore`. An optional scope follows in brackets. Conventional
  Commits specifies that grammar and nothing else. The mood below is this
  repository's own rule.
- 72 characters at most. No full stop at the end.
- One topic. An `and` that joins two clauses means the commit holds two changes,
  so split the commit.

A subject states what the code now does, never what you did to it. It carries a
subject, a present-tense verb, and the behaviour: `fix: the coverage check reads
target names` — never `fix: read target names`. The imperative drops the actor,
and this log names it.

A machine keeps its own wording. A merge commit and a Dependabot commit stay as
the tool wrote them.

One logical change per commit. Work spanning several gets several commits.

## When you report

1. What changed.
2. What you verified — and what you did not, named as the degraded part.
3. The limitation or follow-up that matters.

State facts before conclusions.
