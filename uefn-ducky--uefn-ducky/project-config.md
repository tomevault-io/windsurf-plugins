# Seamless for other people's chats

Breakage reported by anyone using UEFN-Ducky (Codex, Store plugins, MCP
approvals, CLI shims) is healed **inside the app and its Store plugins**.
Other people's chats must keep working with no extra click.

**Never tell an end user to:**

- Settings → Store → Update / Enable
- enable MCP connections, approve tools, or edit `~/.codex/config.toml`
- start a new chat / say continue here / paste a prompt into Cursor
- sideload a zip or copy into `%LOCALAPPDATA%/UEFN-Ducky/uefn_plugins/`

**Do this instead:**

1. Fix the shared function in `UEFN-Ducky-Release` or the standalone
   `uefn-plugin-<id>` clone.
2. Publish the plugin (`py -3 scripts/release.py --publish`). The panel
   auto-applies published Store updates on start.
3. Heal on `register()` / launch — rewrite CLI config, skip broken shims,
   auto-install the CLI. Do not wait for the next user message if a file
   write can fix it now.

Developers still publish through the Store and never hot-patch AppData.
That is not end-user homework.
