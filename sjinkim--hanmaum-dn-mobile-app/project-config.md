# AGENTS.md — hanmaum-dn-mobile-app

Repository-level instructions for Codex. Treat this file as the durable source of truth for how to work in this repo. Keep it concise; detailed workflows live under `docs/codex/`, `.codex/commands/`, and `.agents/skills/`.

## Project Snapshot

- Kotlin Multiplatform mobile app for Android and iOS.
- Shared UI: Compose Multiplatform 1.10.0 + Material3.
- Architecture: feature-first clean architecture with shared KMP domain/data/presentation layers.
- Auth: Keycloak; tokens stored through `TokenStorage` using multiplatform-settings.
- Networking: Ktor 3.3.3 through `core/network/NetworkClient.kt` only.
- DI: Koin 4.0.0 via `di/AppModule.kt`, `DnChurchApp`, and `KoinInit.kt`.
- Navigation: type-safe `@Serializable` route objects in `core/navigation/Routes.kt`.

## Start-of-Session Protocol

1. Read `tasks/lessons.md` before changing anything.
2. Check `git status --short --branch`; if there are user changes, list them and do not overwrite them.
3. Inspect related code before planning or editing.
4. For any task with 3+ steps, architectural choices, or uncertain scope, use a written plan first.
5. If work goes sideways, stop, re-plan, then continue with the smallest safe correction.

## Senior Mobile Engineering Defaults

- Solve the root cause, not the symptom.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes that preserve existing style.
- Shared business logic belongs in `commonMain`; platform APIs stay in platform source sets or behind `expect`/`actual`/interfaces.
- UI must be state-driven: ViewModels expose immutable UI state via `StateFlow`; composables render state and send events back.
- Repositories are the boundary to data sources; ViewModels/composables must not call Ktor, Firebase, Settings, GPS, or platform APIs directly.
- Dependencies are not added casually. Ask before new production dependencies or risky upgrades.
- Do not introduce database/schema/server contract changes unless explicitly requested.
- Security/privacy: never commit secrets, tokens, API keys, keystores, or real user data. Keep environment URLs in BuildKonfig or environment config.

## Architecture Rules

Feature layout under `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hanmaum/dn/mobile/features/<feature>/`:

- `domain/model/` — plain shared models.
- `domain/repository/` — repository interfaces.
- `data/model/` — DTOs and serialization types.
- `data/repository/` — Ktor/settings/cache-backed implementations.
- `presentation/` — ViewModels, UI state, Compose screens/components.

Shared infrastructure lives in `core/`:

- `core/network/NetworkClient.kt` owns Ktor client configuration, base URL handling, JSON, logging, and bearer auth.
- `core/domain/repository/TokenStorage.kt` and `core/data/repository/TokenStorageImpl.kt` own token persistence.
- `core/navigation/Routes.kt` owns type-safe navigation route objects.
- `core/domain/model/NavRoute.kt` is the platform-agnostic navigation intent enum for ViewModels.
- `core/presentation/theme/` owns design-system tokens; do not hardcode one-off colors/shapes/typography in screens.

## Networking Rules

- All backend calls go through the injected shared `HttpClient` from `createHttpClient(tokenStorage)`.
- Do not create ad-hoc Ktor clients in features unless a feature explicitly needs an isolated third-party client and the auth-leak risk is reviewed.
- Bearer tokens must only be sent to the Hanmaum backend host. Never leak Keycloak tokens to pCloud, Google Calendar, or other external hosts.
- Login/Keycloak calls use absolute URLs and bypass backend base-path injection.
- Feature repositories return `Result<T>` or existing project error patterns; avoid throwing across presentation boundaries.

## UI, Design, and Accessibility

All screens must conform to `designs/dn_app/DESIGN.md`.

- New screen from scratch: run `lazyweb:lazyweb-quick-references` first when the lazyweb tool is available; otherwise state it is unavailable and continue with `DESIGN.md`.
- Significant redesign: run `lazyweb:lazyweb-design-improve` with a current screenshot when available; otherwise state the fallback.
- Minor modifications: follow `DESIGN.md` tokens directly.
- Animations: use spring-based specs with `animateFloatAsState` / `AnimatedVisibility`; never linear or ease-in-out transitions.
- Compose performance: avoid expensive work in composables; compute in ViewModels or `remember`; use stable lazy-list keys; use `derivedStateOf` for rapidly changing derived UI state.
- Accessibility: support readable labels/content descriptions, sufficient contrast, scalable text, and tap targets appropriate for mobile.
