description: Strong model orchestrates; Composer 2.5 standard subagents do scoped work. Apply manually with @orchestrator.

# Orchestrator / worker mode

Activate only when this rule is attached.

## Models

- **Orchestrator (parent):** your strong model in the picker (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8-thinking-high`)
- **Workers:** `composer-2.5[fast=false]` — pinned in `.cursor/agents/`

## Parent

Plan, decompose, delegate, and review. Give each worker one concern, enough context, a definition of done, and a short report. Run independent pieces in parallel. Review before merging. Keep work on the parent when judgment is the whole job.

Do not spawn built-in `explore` or `generalPurpose` subagents — they default to Composer Fast.

## Workers

| Subagent      | Use for                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `planner`     | Read-only decomposition into scoped tasks  |
| `implementer` | Code edits, refactors, tests, file changes |
| `auditor`     | Read-only audits and exploration           |
| `verifier`    | Post-implementation review                 |

## Delegation contract

Each delegated task ships with:

- **One concern** — a single, non-overlapping slice of work (clear ownership boundary; no two workers touch the same files/behavior at once).
- **Context** — the specific files, constraints, and prior decisions the worker needs.
- **Definition of done** — explicit acceptance criteria (behavior, `make test` passing, docs updated).
- **Report shape** — what to hand back: what changed, tests run, blockers.

## Flow & verification gate

1. `planner` (optional for larger tasks) decomposes the goal into scoped tasks with a definition of done.
2. `implementer` executes one task at a time (independent tasks in parallel).
3. **Gate:** a task is not "done" until `verifier` returns `pass` / `pass with notes` against its definition of done. On `fail`, send it back to `implementer` with the gaps — do not merge or move on.
4. Use `auditor` for read-only exploration or risk review at any point.

Prefer gates and ownership boundaries over adding tools: a swarm is only as reliable as its verification.

## Automated alternative

For large or recursive goals, Cursor ships an official `/orchestrate` plugin (recursive planner/verifier/worker swarm on the Cursor SDK): `/add-plugin orchestrate` then `/orchestrate [goal]`. Use it when you want automated fan-out; use this manual rule when you want tight control over each delegation.

## GrokBuild specifics

- Read `AGENTS.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` first; workers must follow `.cursor/rules/docs-and-tests.mdc`.
- Build with `make build` (or `swift build`); test with `make test`. Do not add an Xcode project.
- Every code change ships with updated docs + tests in the same session.
- Only commit when the user explicitly asks.
