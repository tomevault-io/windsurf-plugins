# Documentation, tests & Computer Use (required)

Any **code change** — new features, behavior changes, bug fixes, refactors that alter contracts, new persistence keys, notifications, build scripts, or CLI integration — must include **updated docs**, **tests**, and **Computer Use verification** in the same work session. Do not leave documentation stale, ship untested logic, or mark work done without driving the running app.

## Tests (required for every code change)

1. Run `make test` before finishing.
2. Add or extend tests in `Tests/GrokBuildTests/` for behavior you changed or introduced.
3. Prefer extending an existing test file over creating a new harness (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` → Tests).
4. Test pure logic (parsing, persistence round-trips, settings, version compare) without requiring a live `grok` process when possible.
5. Skip new tests only when the change is docs-only or a trivial comment/format with zero behavior change.

## Computer Use (required for every code change)

`make test` alone is **not** enough. Every code change must also be verified in the **running GrokBuild app** via **Computer Use** — even when you did not edit SwiftUI views directly (services, persistence, restore flows, and CLI integration all surface in the live UI).

Any of these drivers works:

- **`user-grokbuild-computer-use` MCP** — **default.** Already installed and permission-granted in Cursor; dogfoods GrokBuild's own Computer Use helper. Tools: `snapshot` / `click` / `type` / `press` / `get` / `wait` / `screenshot` / `list_*`.
- **`agent-desktop` directly** via Shell — fallback when you need extra verbs (`find`, `scroll`, `drag`, `set-value`, `select`, `toggle`, `expand`) or MCP gating blocks an action. Binary at `/opt/homebrew/bin/agent-desktop` or `~/.grokbuild/computer-use/`; `agent-desktop skills get desktop` for the observe→act loop.
- **Orca's `computer-use` CLI** — situational only (`get-app-state` + `--element-index`); different model, not an `agent-desktop` wrapper.

**Preference order:** MCP → direct `agent-desktop` → Orca CLI.

**Steps (every change):**

1. Rebuild and relaunch: quit any running instance, then `make run` (`make build` alone does **not** refresh the running `.app`).
2. Snapshot the accessibility tree (`computer_snapshot` / `agent-desktop snapshot --app GrokBuild`).
3. Navigate to the **exact state your change affects** (tab, settings panel, empty state, restored session, etc.) and confirm behavior via snapshot, click/type, and screenshot when helpful.
4. For non-UI service changes, still reach the user-visible outcome (e.g. transcript recovery → switch tabs and confirm messages; per-tab model → switch tabs and confirm model picker).
5. Check interactive elements expose meaningful names/roles in the accessibility tree.
6. Prefer non-destructive states; if you cannot reach a state live, say so explicitly — do not skip Computer Use silently.
7. Clean up temporary screenshots afterward.

**Skip Computer Use only when:** docs-only, test-only harness changes with zero app behavior change, or trivial comment/format with zero behavior change.

Note: the MCP registered in Cursor is **not** the same process the grok agent uses inside a GrokBuild session at runtime.

## Documentation — what to update

| Change type | Update |
|-------------|--------|
| New/changed feature, service, UI flow, persistence key, notification | `ARCHITECTURE.md` (source map, persistence table, notifications, common tasks → files) |
| User-visible capability or install/requirements | `README.md` |
| Build, sign, notarize, release CI, scripts, bundling | `BUILDING.md`, `scripts/README.md` if scripts changed |
| grok CLI integration surface | `.cursor/skills/grokbuild-grok-cli/SKILL.md`, `grok-cli-integration.mdc` if needed |
| Release/version/update-check behavior | `.cursor/skills/grokbuild-release/SKILL.md` |
| Dev workflow, make targets, testing | `.cursor/skills/grokbuild-dev/SKILL.md` |
| Agent-facing bundled skill behavior | `GrokBuild/Resources/Skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Agent entry / repo conventions | `AGENTS.md` |

`ARCHITECTURE.md` is the canonical internal reference — keep it accurate when structure or data flow changes.

## Definition of done

- [ ] Code compiles (`make build` or `swift build`)
- [ ] `make test` passes; new/changed behavior covered in `Tests/GrokBuildTests/`
- [ ] **Computer Use** verification in the running app (`make run`, then `user-grokbuild-computer-use` MCP, `agent-desktop`, or Orca `computer-use` CLI) — required for **every** code change, not only view edits
- [ ] Relevant docs updated (at minimum `ARCHITECTURE.md` for non-trivial app changes)
- [ ] User-facing changes reflected in `README.md` when applicable

Only commit when the user explicitly asks.
