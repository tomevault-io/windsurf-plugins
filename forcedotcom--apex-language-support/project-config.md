description: Run verification after code changes
---


After making code changes, follow the verification checklist in `.claude/skills/verification/SKILL.md`: compile, lint, Effect language service (where applicable), test, bundle, knip, check:dupes. On compile failure, use `.claude/skills/verification/references/compile.md` (TS4023 / TS1261 skills).

**Debug mode** (active bug investigation, Cursor Debug mode, instrumentation): priority is reproduce → fix → validate with runtime evidence. **Do not require lint** between iterations; defer knip/dupes/full tests until the bug is fixed or pre-merge. See `SKILL.md` section **Debug mode**.

If the user **suspends lint** (lint is in the way): do not run lint or prioritize lint-only fixes until they say otherwise or pre-PR; see **Lint suspended** in the same SKILL.

Delegate to the verifier subagent (`@.cursor/agents/verifier.md`) to check for dead code (knip only). The stop hook covers compile, lint, Effect LS, test, `bundle`; do not fix in the verifier — parent fixes.

A stop hook runs compile, lint, Effect LS, test, `bundle` when the agent stops (knip excluded — repo has pre-existing unused files). If verification fails, the agent continues with a fix instruction.
