# LSP positioning and VS Code web extension rules

Apex-language-support-specific TypeScript notes. Pulled from the previous `.cursor/rules/ts-rules.mdc`.

## Language Server Protocol (LSP)

- Positions (line:column) from the client side are both 0-based indexes
- This includes ranges (start-position and end-position)
- The `lsp-compliant-services` layer transforms position data to parser-ast values and back

## Apex parser/ast

- Positions in package `apex-parser-ast` follow the form defined by the ANTLR4 base parser
- Positions in parser-ast use a 1-based index for line numbers and 0-based index for column numbers
- Code in `apex-parser-ast` should never use a different indexing scheme

## Apex class semantics

- For a class that defines Apex source, never use method `testMethod`, as it is a reserved word

## VS Code web extension development

### Web extension runtime environment

Web extensions run in a Browser WebWorker environment within the VS Code extension host, subject to browser worker sandbox restrictions. This environment has significant limitations compared to Node.js-based extensions.

### Module loading and bundling

- Web extensions do not support ES module imports, `require()` for external modules, or `importScripts()`. The ONLY exception is `require('vscode')`, which works via a special shim.
- All web extension code MUST be bundled into a single file before deployment. Use esbuild (preferred) or webpack to produce a single-file output.
- Never attempt to dynamically load additional extension files or node modules at runtime in web extensions.

### Node.js APIs and globals

- Node.js globals and built-in modules (`process`, `os`, `setImmediate`, `path`, `util`, `url`, `fs`, `crypto`, etc.) are NOT available at runtime in web extensions.
- These APIs can be polyfilled at build time using webpack or similar bundlers with appropriate configuration, but the runtime will never have native Node.js support.
- Always verify that any dependencies used in web extensions are browser-compatible or have browser builds available.

### File system access

- Workspace files and folders are on a virtual file system in web extensions.
- ALL file system operations MUST use the VS Code file system API: `vscode.workspace.fs` (methods: `readFile`, `writeFile`, `readDirectory`, `createDirectory`, `delete`, `rename`, `copy`, `stat`).
- Never use Node.js `fs` module methods directly in web extension code, even if polyfilled.
- Extension context locations (`ExtensionContext.extensionUri`) and storage locations (`ExtensionContext.storageUri`, `ExtensionContext.globalStorageUri`) are also on virtual file systems and require `vscode.workspace.fs`.

### Network and web resources

- Use the Fetch API (`fetch()`) for all HTTP/HTTPS requests to web resources in web extensions.
- All accessed external resources MUST support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Resources without proper CORS headers will fail to load.
- Never use Node.js-specific HTTP libraries like `http`, `https`, or `axios` (unless they have browser-compatible builds).

### Process and worker management

- Creating child processes or running executables is NOT possible in web extensions.
- To run background work or language servers, use the Web Worker API (`new Worker()`) instead.
- Language servers in web extensions must be packaged as browser-compatible workers and communicate via the Language Server Protocol over Web Worker messaging.

### Extension activation

- Web extensions must export their lifecycle functions using CommonJS-style exports: `exports.activate = ...` and `exports.deactivate = ...`.
- Do not use ES module `export` syntax for the main activation functions in web extension entry points.
