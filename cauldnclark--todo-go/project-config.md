# Go Backend Development Guidelines

## Code Organization
- Follow clean architecture: handlers → services → repositories
- Use dependency injection pattern (see [main.go](mdc:cmd/api/main.go) for examples)
- Keep business logic in services, data access in repositories
- HTTP handlers should be thin and delegate to services

## Error Handling
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Return structured error responses
- Log errors with context using logrus
- Handle database errors gracefully (check for sql.ErrNoRows)

## Database Patterns
- Use prepared statements for queries
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Follow the repository pattern for data access

## Configuration
- Load configuration from environment variables via [config.go](mdc:internal/config/config.go)
- Use struct tags for validation
- Support both development and production environments

## Middleware
- Authentication middleware extracts user ID from JWT context
- Rate limiting uses Redis sliding window
- CORS configured for frontend integration
- Request logging and recovery middleware

## WebSocket
- Hub manages connections and broadcasting
- Use Redis for scaling WebSocket across instances
- Handle connection cleanup properly

## Testing
- Write unit tests for services and repositories
- Use table-driven tests for handlers
- Mock external dependencies (Redis, database)
