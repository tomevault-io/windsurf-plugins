# Pocket CEP - Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

Pocket CEP is an **educational** NextJS companion app for the Chrome Enterprise Premium MCP server.
It demonstrates how to connect to an MCP server using OAuth, call tools, and build an AI-powered
admin chat assistant. Code should be well-documented and beginner-friendly.

## Documentation Standards (JSDoc/TSDoc)

All code must be documented to help new engineers understand the codebase. Follow these requirements strictly.

> **Note:** ESLint doesn't enforce JSDoc presence in this project — the standards below are enforced through code review and AI agent instructions.

### File-Level Documentation

Every TypeScript file MUST begin with a file-level JSDoc comment describing its role:

```typescript
/**
 * @file Human-readable formatting utilities for Cloud Identity settings.
 */
```

### Function Documentation

Every exported function and class method MUST have a multi-line JSDoc comment:

```typescript
/**
 * Formats a Cloud Identity setting type into a human-readable name.
 */
export function formatSettingType(settingType: string) {
```

**Format requirements:**
- Use multi-line format with `/**` on its own line
- Description only - do NOT use `@param` or `@return` tags
- Keep descriptions concise but informative
- Explain the "why" not the "what" when the function name is self-explanatory

### Type and Interface Documentation

Every exported type, interface, and type alias MUST have a JSDoc comment:

```typescript
/**
 * Result from fetching Chrome audit events.
 */
export type ChromeEventsResult = { ... }

/**
 * Contract for CEP tool execution. Implementations include CepToolExecutor
 * for production API calls and FixtureToolExecutor for deterministic testing.
 */
export interface ToolExecutor { ... }
```

### What NOT to Document

- Private helper functions with obvious purpose (use judgment)
- Inline type definitions within function signatures

### Educational Comments

Comments should be descriptive and beginner-friendly, explaining extension points
and design decisions. Keep them proportional to the complexity they explain.

### Code Organization

- Two blank lines between top-level declarations (functions, classes, types)
- One blank line between substantially different blocks within a function
- Group related code together
- Do not re-export; do not clog code with backwards-compatibility shims

## Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Prefer clarity over brevity.

### Type Safety & Explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises returned from async functions
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains
- Handle errors in async code with try/catch
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### React & JSX

- Use function components over class components
- Call hooks at the top level only, never conditionally
- Specify all dependencies in hook dependency arrays correctly
- Use the `key` prop for elements in iterables (prefer unique IDs over array indices)
- Nest children between opening and closing tags instead of passing as props
- Don't define components inside other components
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility:
  - Provide meaningful alt text for images
  - Use proper heading hierarchy
  - Add labels for form inputs
  - Include keyboard event handlers alongside mouse events
  - Use semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, etc.) instead of divs with roles

### Error Handling & Debugging

- For this POC, structured `console.log` output is allowed; include a consistent tag and avoid secrets
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
- Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases
- Eval suites log per-case progress with `[eval]` prefix; keep logs concise and structured

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
- Group related code together and separate concerns

### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
- Validate and sanitize user input
