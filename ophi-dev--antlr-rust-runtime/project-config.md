# Development notes

## Codegen boundaries

Generic runtime and codegen paths must stay grammar-agnostic. Do not add
language-specific rule names, grammar names, file extensions, or semantic
workarounds to `src/bin/antlr4-rust-gen.rs` or runtime modules; model the
behavior from ANTLR metadata/ATN structure instead, and keep language-specific
guidance in docs or tests for that language.

## Kotlin parser parity perf benchmark

Reproduces the timings against the Kotlin grammar from `antlr/grammars-v4`.

### One-time setup (fresh checkout)

```bash
# 1. ANTLR jar (any path; pin v4.13.2)
mkdir -p /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/tools
curl -fLo /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/tools/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar \
    https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar

# 2. grammars-v4 checkout (sparse, just the kotlin grammar)
mkdir -p /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 init -q
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 remote add origin https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4.git
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 sparse-checkout init --cone
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 sparse-checkout set kotlin/kotlin
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 fetch --depth 1 origin 284602b3f23ca54dc30778204ab7ae9e969145e9
git -C /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4 checkout FETCH_HEAD
```

### Run the parity smoke + dumper build

```bash
tests/kotlin-parity/run.sh \
    --antlr-jar /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/tools/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar \
    --grammars-v4 /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/grammars-v4
```

That generates the Rust recognizers directly from the Kotlin `.g4` source,
builds `tests/kotlin-parity/dumper`, and asserts the parse trees match
`antlr4-python3-runtime` byte-for-byte. The ANTLR jar is used only for the
Python oracle.

### Measure parse-only timings

The dumper has a built-in parse-only stopwatch so process startup (~10 ms) is excluded:

```bash
DUMPER=tests/kotlin-parity/dumper/target/release/kotlin-parity-dumper
for snippet in tests/kotlin-parity/snippets/*.kt; do
    echo "=== $(basename "$snippet") ==="
    "$DUMPER" --input "$snippet" --output /tmp/dump.txt --iters 5 --time
done
```

`--iters N` repeats parse N times within one process; `--time` prints `min`/`avg` to stderr.

## ANTLR runtime testsuite

Validates the Rust runtime against ANTLR's upstream conformance descriptors.

### One-time setup

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/antlr/antlr4 /tmp/antlr-cleanroom/antlr4-upstream
```

The harness reads `antlr4-upstream/runtime-testsuite` and the same ANTLR jar fetched above.

### Run the full sweep

```bash
cargo run --release --quiet --bin antlr4-runtime-testsuite
```

Defaults to `ANTLR4_JAR=/tmp/antlr-cleanroom/tools/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar` and `ANTLR4_RUNTIME_TESTSUITE=/tmp/antlr-cleanroom/antlr4-upstream/runtime-testsuite`. Override with `--antlr-jar`/`--descriptors` or env vars. Cases run on `--jobs` parallel workers (default `min(cores, 8)`), each with its own cargo target-dir stripe; the render driver and `antlr4-rust-gen` are prebuilt once per sweep. Wall-clock ≈ 2 minutes on Apple Silicon.

### The rendered (embedded-actions) pipeline

The harness runs descriptors the way every official ANTLR target does:
each descriptor grammar is rendered through
`.conformance-review/Rust.test.stg` with the real StringTemplate engine
(`tools/stg-render/RenderGrammar.java`, executed via the ANTLR jar and the
Java single-file source launcher), so its actions/predicates become real
Rust code. The rendered grammar feeds `antlr4-rust-gen --actions embedded`
directly, which splices the bodies verbatim
after `$`-attribute translation (`src/bin_support/embedded.rs`) and
generates typed context views, per-rule attrs structs, members
fields/methods, listener traits, and recognizer facades. `--stg PATH`
overrides the template group. (An earlier template-recognition pipeline,
which simulated action output instead of executing it, was replaced by
this one before ever shipping.)

### Run a subset while iterating

```bash
# One descriptor:
cargo run --release --quiet --bin antlr4-runtime-testsuite -- --case LexerExec/KeywordID

# One group (e.g. while debugging left-recursion):
cargo run --release --quiet --bin antlr4-runtime-testsuite -- --group LeftRecursion --limit 20

# Keep the per-case temp crates for inspection:
cargo run --release --quiet --bin antlr4-runtime-testsuite -- --case ParserErrors/SingleSetInsertion --keep
```

Per-case scratch crates land under `target/antlr-runtime-testsuite/<case>/`. Stale dirs from a killed run can fail a re-run with `Os { code: 66, ... DirectoryNotEmpty }` — `rm -rf target/antlr-runtime-testsuite/*` to recover.

## Code coverage

CI collects LLVM source-based coverage (`cargo-llvm-cov`) and uploads it to
Codecov as two merged flags — `unittests` (from `ci.yml`) and `conformance`
(from `antlr-runtime-testsuite.yml`). One-time local install (it is a crates.io
cargo subcommand, *not* a rustup component, so it cannot live in
`rust-toolchain.toml` — only its `llvm-tools` dependency does, and that is
already pinned there):

```bash
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov   # or: cargo binstall cargo-llvm-cov (prebuilt)
```

Then reproduce CI locally:

```bash
