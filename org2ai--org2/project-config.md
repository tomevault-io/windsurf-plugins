# AGENTS.md — Agent Skill Routing for ORGII

This file orients Codex / orgii agents working in this repo. It tells you **which audit / methodology skill to invoke** for which kind of task, and what to deliver before declaring work done.

> Cursor IDE users: live UI-feature delivery rules live in `.cursor/rules/ui-feature-workflow.mdc`. This file does **not** replace those — it's about skill routing for AI agents, not unit-test gates.

This is **advisory**, not a hard contract. Use judgment based on PR size and risk.

## Skill Routing Table

| Scenario                                                                                                                   | Skill to invoke                     | When                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rust / TypeScript architecture, types, dead code, FSM, naming overload, wire protocol, init parity                         | `architecture-audit`                | Before finalizing a refactor plan; before cleanup/unification PRs; when reviewing a domain rewrite                                            |
| Frontend UI consistency, design-system component usage, arbitrary Tailwind values, a11y basics, visual-pattern duplication | `frontend-ui-audit`                 | Before delivering a PR that touches `*.tsx` under `src/components/` or `src/modules/**/components/` (component refactors, UI cleanup batches) |
| React performance, re-renders, async waterfalls, bundle size, heavy dependencies, virtualization, high-frequency events    | `react-best-practices`              | For performance-focused React implementation/review; not for routine styling, copy, or single-file bug fixes without a performance concern    |
| Both architecture and React performance change together                                                                    | Run both, keep findings categorized | Apply `architecture-audit` to ownership/boundaries and `react-best-practices` to measured React runtime concerns                              |
| E2E test surface (Playwright / WebDriver), test stability                                                                  | `e2e-testing`                       | When adding or repairing rendered E2E specs                                                                                                   |
| Polling, timers, caches, subscriptions, workers, streaming, sync, scans, pagination, multi-instance lifecycle              | `org2-performance-guard`            | Before delivering any change that can consume CPU/RAM/I/O while active, idle, hidden, or across repeated open/close cycles                    |

Skills live at:

- `.orgii/skills/architecture-audit/SKILL.md` (workspace copy, if present)

If the skill block isn't already prefetched in your context, read its `SKILL.md` before acting on it.

## Default Delivery Flow

### Touching `*.tsx` files (UI work)

Before declaring a UI-touching task complete, ask:

1. **Is this a single-file bug fix?** If yes, skip `frontend-ui-audit` (its own "When NOT To Use" rules out single bug fixes — noise-to-value ratio is too high).
2. **Is this a component refactor, UI cleanup, or "should this use the design system?" question?** If yes, run `frontend-ui-audit` over the changed files and drop a report in `docs/frontend-ui-audit-YYYY-MM-DD/<ComponentName>.md` using the skill's output format. Summarize fix / keep-with-reason / abstract counts in the delivery message so the user can see verdicts without opening the file.
3. **Did you find a fix-candidate that spans multiple files?** Don't fix site-by-site silently. Surface it as a sweep candidate per the skill's `Systematic Sweep Discipline` section and let the user decide whether to land a config-level change.

### React performance-focused work

Use `react-best-practices` only when performance is part of the task: re-renders, async waterfalls, bundle/startup cost, heavy dependencies, virtualization, high-frequency events, or subscription scope. Apply its ORGII filter before upstream guidance: Next.js/RSC/server-only rules are inapplicable, SWR is not introduced by default, and runtime performance claims require measurement rather than typecheck-only evidence.

### Touching Rust / backend / type-level / cross-layer code
