## Mandy's Story (Reference)
Mandy started in sales and marketing for Crock Spot. She saw an empty cafe at a catering job and took the spot - turning one location into three restaurants. Her love for catering led her to downsize to one restaurant plus dedicated catering operations, focusing on making people feel special through creative catering experiences.

This pivot happened one month before COVID hit. As the dining landscape changed, Mandy saw opportunity and rolled with it. A woman-owned business that bet on herself and created a thriving corporate catering empire.

**Mission**: We make food fun, social, and special for everyone.

## Session Notes

- Added greyscale image cards to Pop-Up Events page (4 cards)

### Pending Verification
- **Pandemic Reference**: The Lunch menu mentions "serving the National Guard meals for 36 days straight during the Pandemic" - verify this is accurate with Mandy before launch
