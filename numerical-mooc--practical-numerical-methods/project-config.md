# Repository guidance

This repository contains the 2026 edition of **Practical Numerical Methods: Engineering computation in the agentic era**. Work incrementally and favor pedagogical clarity over software abstraction. Explain unfamiliar tools and consequential choices in plain language.

## Course architecture

- Notebooks are the canonical executable exposition: learners should see the model, derivation, algorithm, experiments, verification, and interpretation.
- Introduce numerical code transparently in a notebook before moving stable, reused logic into `src/practical_numerical_methods/`. Avoid imports that hide the method being taught.
- Treat scientific-library and AI-agent results as claims requiring inspection and evidence. Learners remain responsible for specifications, verification, provenance, and engineering judgment.
- Follow `DECISIONS.md` and `docs/Notebook-First-Code-Architecture.md`. Record consequential new design choices in `DECISIONS.md` and elaborate them under `docs/` when useful.

## Authoring conventions

- Jupyter Book 2/MyST sources live in `book/`; lesson notebooks and their figures live together under `book/modules/<module>/`.
- Keep notebooks readable as chapters: interleave concise narrative with small code chunks, expose intermediate reasoning, and include reminders where learners with rusty Python may need them.
- During development, keep committed notebooks free of cell outputs and execution counts. Adding final outputs is a deliberate later step.
- Preserve notebook cell IDs and avoid unrelated notebook reserialization. Use triple single quotes (`'''`) for Python docstrings.
- Use `book/references.bib` and MyST citations instead of handwritten reference lists. Give referenced equations semantic labels such as `eq-radius-of-curvature` and use generated references such as `[Equation %s](#eq-radius-of-curvature)`; never type equation numbers manually.
- Build from `book/` with `npx --yes --package=mystmd@1.10.1 myst build --html`. The GitHub Pages workflow is `.github/workflows/book.yml`.

## Working agreement

- Make small, reviewable changes and preserve unrelated user work.
- Treat the archived repository at `../numerical-mooc` as source material only; do not modify it unless explicitly requested.
- Validate edited notebooks as JSON, review the diff, and run checks or a book build proportional to the change.
- Do not commit, push, or publish unless explicitly asked. Leave changes for local review when requested.
