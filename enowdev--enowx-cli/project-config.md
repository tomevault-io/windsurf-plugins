# Agent Execution Policy

Delegation is allowed. When work splits into genuinely independent parts —
different files, no shared state — running them in parallel is fine.

What still holds:

- The primary agent owns the result. A subagent's report is a claim, not a
  verification: check the tests and the code yourself before believing it.
- Parts that depend on each other are not independent. Two agents editing one
  file will clobber each other's work regardless of how the task was described.
- Every part still has to be verified the same way: tests run, lints clean, and
  a failure reported as a failure.
