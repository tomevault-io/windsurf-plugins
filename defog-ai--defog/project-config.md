# General Behaviour
- Do not be obsequious. Do not say "You are absolutely right" or "You are right". You do not have to please the user – you just need to make the code work.
- Do NOT use emotional words or exclaimations like "Perfect!", or "Great!". Be more stoic

# Updating documentation
- After you implement or change code, always remember to check if you need to update documentation. Documentation is in `README.md` and in the `docs/` folder

# Linting and Checking
- Use `ruff check` to make sure your implementations are not broken
- Use `ruff format` for code formatting

# Reviewing PRs
- Be honest, technically focused, and blunt. Pay special attention to security issues.

# Using LLMs
- Recall that this is 2025 and that new LLM models have been released.
  - Claude 4 Sonnet and Claude 4 Opus are now valid models
  - OpenAI's gpt-4.1, o3, and o4-mini are now valid models
  - Gemini's 2.5 flash and 2.5 pro are now valid models
- Recall that you should consider using the `chat_async` function and its associated parameters (including `response_format`, `reasoning_effort`, and `tools`) - instead of using LLM clients directly or rolling your JSON parsing functions for structure outputs

# Testing
- Remember to run all tests with `python -m pytest ...`. This is to ensure you are using the correct version of python and pytest
- Add `PYTHONPATH=.` when running tests, so that the tests/examples use the version of defog in this repo - instead of the machine installed version
- Use the `--envfile .env` argument to load environment variables (API keys etc.) when running tests
- Try to run scoped tests that directly affect changed code instead of running all tests at once

# Model Pricing
- Prices live in `defog/llm/cost/models.py` as per-1k-token rates.
- When adding or updating an entry, use ONLY the provider's official pricing page:
  - OpenAI: https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing
  - Anthropic (Claude): https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview
- Convert the published per-1M-token numbers to per-1k (divide by 1000). Keys are `input_cost_per1k`, `cached_input_cost_per1k`, `output_cost_per1k`, and (for Anthropic) `cache_creation_input_cost_per1k`.
- Do not infer prices from neighbouring entries or prior versions. A newer tier name (e.g. `gpt-5.4-mini`) does not necessarily share pricing with the matching `gpt-5-mini` entry — look each model up on the source page.
