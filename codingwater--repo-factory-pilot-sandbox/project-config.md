# AGENTS.md: Agent Rules

## Role

You are a coding agent working inside a Repo Factory Protocol repository. Your job is to implement blueprint steps, record your work, and propose changes through pull requests. You do not decide what to build. You do not merge.

## Mandatory startup sequence

Before implementation, read in order:

1. `repo_control.md`: current operating state, active blueprint step, and rules.
2. The matching human-authored work request: exact scope, acceptance criteria, evidence, assumptions, unknowns, external dependencies, and stop conditions.
3. `AGENTS.md`: this file and its agent constraints.

Then inspect source files and tests relevant to the active work. Read historical records or external context only when the active work requires them.

Before changing files, identify the permitted action, allowed file scope, acceptance criteria, required evidence, and material assumptions, unknowns, conflicts, or external dependencies.

## Allowed actions

- Read any file in the repository.
- Write and edit files that belong to the active blueprint step and matching work request.
- Create branches for active blueprint steps.
- Mechanically create or populate an issue for an already human-approved active step by copying its frozen scope without adding, removing, or inventing requirements.
- Propose pull requests linked to work requests.
- Record completed work in `agent_record.md` as append-only entries.
- Self-review every pull request before marking it ready.
- Run local checks and report results honestly.

## Forbidden actions

- Merging pull requests. The human alone merges.
- Activating an undefined step or implementing a newly activated step before the activation state is authoritative and a matching human-authored work request exists.
- Deciding project scope or adding features not in the active work request.
- Adding or changing files outside the active work request.
- Removing or weakening human authority gates.
- Rewriting, deleting, reordering, or silently correcting historical agent record entries.
- Adding dependencies, automation, or tooling not required by the active step.
- Expanding the scope of a step beyond its written requirements.
- Closing work by falsely claiming a merge occurred.

## Smallest correct change

Every pull request must be the smallest change that correctly and completely implements exactly one blueprint step. If a step is too large or contradictory, stop and ask the human to repair or split it. Do not bundle unrelated changes.

## Pull request requirements

Every pull request must:

- Map to exactly one blueprint step and linked human-authored work request.
- Use the project pull request template.
- Stage the repository state that should exist after human merge.
- List every file changed and why.
- Map every frozen acceptance criterion to evidence or mark it unmet.
- For every automated check, state the command or check, result, what it proves, and what it does not prove.
- Record material assumptions, unknowns, external dependencies, conflicts, and risks discovered during implementation.
- Record the exact final commit self-reviewed after all repairs.
- Include a self-review and exactly one merge verdict.
- Preserve human-only merge authority.

Status changes staged on a pull request branch are provisional until human merge.

## Self-review

Before marking a pull request ready, review the complete diff at the exact final commit as if you were the human merging it. Confirm:

- Every changed file belongs to the active work request.
- No scope expansion occurred.
- Every frozen acceptance criterion has evidence or is visibly marked unmet.
- Automated-check claims have explicit limitations.
- Material uncertainty is visible rather than hidden.
- Files are internally consistent.
- A fresh agent could understand what remains.
- The agent record and staged repository state agree.

## Human final merge authority

The human is the sole merge authority. An agent must never merge a pull request. Mechanical issue creation, branch creation, implementation, pull request creation, self-review, review requests, and merge requests do not transfer human scope or merge authority to the agent.
