# disktree — agent guide

A GPUI + gpui-omarchy treemap explorer for disk usage on Omarchy. Read
`README.md` for the product; this file is the working contract.

## What this is

Find what is eating a volume, mark paths for removal, review the list, and
remove it — with the volume's free space live on screen the whole time. Two
phases: explore (treemap, breadcrumbs, the selection and status lines) and review (the marked list,
the removal mode, the confirmation). Marking is never destructive.

## Commands

```sh
make build                      # release build
make run                        # build and run, scanning $HOME
make install                    # ~/.local: binary, desktop entry, icon
make install PREFIX=/usr/local  # system-wide (needs root)
make uninstall
make lint                       # rustfmt --check, then clippy --all-targets -D warnings
make test                       # core and window-harness tests
make ci                         # lint, then test
make fmt                        # format in place
```

`make install` is the supported way to put this on a machine: it installs the
release binary, `packaging/disktree.desktop.in` (rendered with the real install
prefix and the crate version) and `assets/disktree.svg`. Keep the desktop
entry's `Categories` to a single main category plus additional ones, or
`desktop-file-validate` complains.

`cargo xtask lint` is the gate. It must be green before anything is called
done, and it must not fix anything: a red local run is the same signal CI gives.

## House rules

* **Strict lints from omatrack's style.** `clippy::all` and `clippy::pedantic`
  are errors, `clippy::nursery` warns, and `-D warnings` promotes the rest. Every
  deliberate exception is listed with its reason in the workspace `Cargo.toml`
  or as an `#[allow(..., reason = "...")]` on the item — never silently.
* **80 columns**, 4-space indent, by `rustfmt.toml`. Only stable rustfmt
  options, because the gate runs on stable; unstable options would be ignored
  with a warning instead of applying.
* **Comments say why.** The code says what. Any non-obvious number, ordering or
  boundary deserves the reason next to it.
* **Tests live beside the promise they make.** `disktree-core` tests size
  accounting, layout and deletion guards against real temporary trees;
  `disktree-app/src/tests.rs` drives the real window harness — draw a frame,
  press keys — so a screen that panics while painting fails a test.
* **Never delete anything outside a marked path.** See `removal.rs`; the guards
  are load-bearing and are covered by tests.

## Invariants

1. **Sizes come from `st_blocks * 512` unless apparent size was asked for.**
   That is the number that comes back when a file is deleted.
2. **`own_bytes`/`own_files` are derived, never tracked.** `tree::aggregate`
   computes the totals from the children. Hardlink de-duplication rewrites a
   leaf's weight and re-aggregates; anything that patches `bytes` directly will
   be overwritten.
3. **A directory is only built when its own scan *and* every subdirectory task
   has finished.** That is the `+1` sentinel in `PendingDir::pending`. Building
   early silently drops whole subtrees — it has happened once.
4. **Only paths under the scanned root may be removed**, and mount points, the
   root, the home directory and symlink targets are refused.
5. **Marks are keyed by absolute path**, not tree position, so they survive a
   re-scan; `Marks::refresh` re-reads their sizes and drops what is gone.
6. **The treemap is painted, not composed of elements.** Thousands of
   rectangles belong in one canvas callback; labels are shaped there too so they
   clip to their own tile.
7. **Tile crumbs are absolute.** `treemap::layout` takes the drawn node's
   crumbs and every tile extends them, so a tile resolves from the scanned
   root at any depth. Relative crumbs look right at `~` and silently point
   at other directories after descending — including for marks. Any code that
   turns a path into crumbs walks from the scanned root, too.
8. **The view transform is the only thing zoom changes.** Layout runs in
   base-space pixels and is cached; `screen = (base - origin) * scale`.
9. **The status bar never claims a saving it cannot measure.** Projections come
   from marked bytes; the final number comes from `statvfs` before and after.
