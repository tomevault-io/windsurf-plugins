# QuantLab Cursor Rules

## Read First

Before making changes, read these context files:

- `@.agents/project-brief.md`
- `@.agents/implementation-rules.md`
- `@.agents/current-state.md`

## Change Discipline

- Make the smallest change that satisfies the task.
- Do not edit unrelated files.
- Do not move business logic into `main.py`.
- Prefer existing modules and patterns over new abstractions.
- Preserve backward compatibility unless the task explicitly changes a contract.

## Quality Rules

- Add or update `pytest` coverage for behavior changes.
- Keep deterministic behavior where possible.
- Preserve artifact schemas and CLI contracts unless the task requires a change.
- For broker or execution work, keep human gates explicit and preserve idempotency and reconciliation safety.
