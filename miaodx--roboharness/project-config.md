# AGENTS.md

This file defines the default operating playbook for coding agents working in this repository.
Its scope is the entire repo tree rooted at this directory.

## Steering priority

Before implementing broad changes, read `docs/steering/current.md` for the active milestone and non-goals.

## 0) First-read policy (mandatory)

Before running any command, read in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md` (this file)
2. `CLAUDE.md`
3. `pyproject.toml` sections:
   - `[project.optional-dependencies]`
   - `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`
   - `[tool.coverage.run]`

If instructions conflict, priority is:
**system/developer/user prompt > AGENTS.md > CLAUDE.md > inferred defaults**.

## 0.1) Skill routing (Codex + Claude)

When the user's request clearly matches an available skill, invoke that skill as the
first action instead of replying ad hoc or exploring with other tools first. This
applies to Codex sessions as well as Claude sessions.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming -> `office-hours`
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors -> `investigate`
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR -> `ship`
- QA, test the site, find bugs -> `qa`
- Code review, check my diff -> `review`
- Update docs after shipping -> `document-release`
- Weekly retro -> `retro`
- Design system, brand -> `design-consultation`
- Visual audit, design polish -> `design-review`
- Architecture review -> `plan-eng-review`
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume -> `checkpoint`
- Code quality, health check -> `health`

---

## 0.2) Design artifact mirroring

When a design or planning skill writes artifacts outside the repo (for example under
`~/.gstack/projects/...`), keep that external copy if the skill needs it for cross-session
discovery, but also mirror the approved project-facing artifact into `docs/designs/` so the
repository remains self-contained.

For `/office-hours` outputs specifically:
- mirror the approved design doc into `docs/designs/`
- mirror any project-relevant sketch HTML into `docs/designs/` when available
- do not treat `/tmp` files as the canonical project artifact

---

## 0.3) Decision persistence for long reviews

For multi-step design, review, or planning work, do not rely on chat context as the
sole source of truth once decisions start getting locked in.

- After each approved review block or major decision set, mirror the accepted
  decisions into a repo-local artifact under `docs/designs/` or another task-appropriate
  docs path.
- Before starting implementation from a long interactive review, ensure the latest
  approved decisions exist in a repo-local file and save a `/checkpoint`.
- If context is getting long, the user asks about persistence/handoff, or a session
  switch looks likely, save a `/checkpoint` proactively.
- Treat `~/.gstack/projects/...` checkpoints as the handoff layer and repo-local
  docs as the canonical project record for approved decisions.

## 1) Environment preflight (mandatory before tests)

Do not run UT immediately on a fresh environment.
Always complete dependency preflight first.

### 1.1 Preferred package manager: `uv`

Use `uv` first when available:

```bash
uv --version
```

If available, install project + dev dependencies with one of:

```bash
uv sync --dev
```

If no lockfile/workspace setup is present, use:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 1.2 Fallback when `uv` is unavailable

Use pip:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 1.3 Fast sanity check before UT

Because pytest coverage flags are configured in `pyproject.toml`, verify `pytest-cov` is usable before running full tests:

```bash
python -c "import pytest_cov; print('pytest-cov ok')"
```

If this fails, install missing dev deps first (via `uv` preferred, pip fallback), then proceed.

---

## 2) Standard test workflow

### 2.1 Full unit tests (default)

```bash
pytest -q
```

### 2.2 Focused debugging loop

```bash
pytest tests/<target_file>.py -k <pattern> -q
```

### 2.3 Optional no-cov local loop (only for faster debugging)

```bash
pytest --no-cov -q
```

Before finishing work, run full default UT (`pytest -q`) at least once.

---

## 3) Lint/type checks for code changes

Run when Python code changes are made:

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy src/
```

If a check cannot run because of environment limits, report the exact blocker.

---

## 4) Operational best practices

1. **Fail fast with clear diagnostics**: prefer explicit errors over silent fallbacks.
2. **No hidden dependency assumptions**: always derive test requirements from `pyproject.toml`.
3. **Reproducible command logs**: report exact commands and outcomes.
4. **Small, verifiable steps**: install deps -> sanity check -> run UT.
5. **No dependency drift in fixes**: avoid ad-hoc single-package installs unless doing triage; converge back to `.[dev]`.

---

## 5) Quick command checklist (copy/paste)

```bash
# 1) Read project testing/dependency config
sed -n '1,220p' pyproject.toml

# 2) Install deps (uv preferred)
uv --version && uv sync --dev || python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 3) Verify pytest-cov is available
python -c "import pytest_cov; print('pytest-cov ok')"

# 4) Run all unit tests
pytest -q
```

## 6) Commit hygiene
