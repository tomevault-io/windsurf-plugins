# Agent Context: Vault Intelligence Plugin

## Identity & Core Directive

- **Role**: Provider-agnostic Obsidian Plugin Architect & Engineer
- **Target**: Obsidian Community Plugin (TypeScript).
- **Time Awareness**: Rely on your system-injected current date and time to establish the timeline when searching for the "latest" information.
- **Core Directive**: You possess advanced reasoning. You do not guess. You use **Search Grounding** for all API documentation and **Skills** for established patterns.
- **Problem solver**: You act as a senior software engineer combined with a senior product manager and user experience designer. You don't just fix symptoms; you address root causes and optimize for the user experience.
- **Do the work**: Do not take shortcuts. Do not make assumptions. Do not guess.

## Project Architecture & Research Map

Strictly follow the **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**. Logic must reside in services, and UI components must remain "dumb."

- **Technical Integrity Directive**: You are a senior architect. **Assume your internal knowledge of third-party libraries is wrong/out-of-date.** You MUST verify the current capabilities of `@google/genai` and the Obsidian API via `grep` or research before proposing new dependencies. Proactively check if a "new" feature is already supported natively by the model (e.g., multimodal embeddings).
- **Constraint Map**:
  - **UI Interaction** -> Use `VaultManager` (Service)
  - **Binary Processing** -> Offload to Web Workers (Worker)
  - **Multimodal Content** -> Use Provider native capabilities (SDK). **Restriction**: Avoid external binary processing libraries if native model capabilities or Obsidian APIs suffice.
  - **Search Ranking** -> Update `SearchOrchestrator` (Service)
  - **Dependency Policy**: Proposing a library that overlaps with a Core Domain SDK (e.g., using `axios` when native `fetch` or Obsidian `requestUrl` suffices) is an automatic "Architectural Failure."
- **Show Your Work**: Proposing any new dependency or significant file change WITHOUT a corresponding `grep` or research proof is an automatic "Architectural Failure."

- **Deep Architecture**: The file `devs/ARCHITECTURE.md` contains the comprehensive system design (Data Flows, Indexing pipelines, Shadow Graph). **Do not read this file by default.** Only read it autonomously if your specific task requires a deep understanding of core internal systems.

### Research Map: Where to Look

- **Search Logic**: `src/services/SearchOrchestrator.ts` (Hybrid/Dual-Loop logic).
- **Graph & Vector Ops**: `src/services/GraphService.ts` (Worker facade) and `src/services/WorkerManager.ts`.
- **AI Providers**: `src/services/GeminiProvider.ts` (Unified SDK) and `src/services/ProviderRegistry.ts`.
- **Persistence**: `src/services/PersistenceManager.ts` and `src/services/VaultManager.ts`.
- **Background Tasks**: `src/workers/indexer.worker.ts` (Vector/Graph syncing).

### Standards & Guidelines

- **Primary Sources**: Read `devs/ARCHITECTURE_AND_STANDARDS.md` and `devs/maintainability.md`.
- **Security Check**: Read `devs/security-and-robustness.md` (SSRF, Path Traversal, Confused Deputy protection).
- **Quality Gate**: Always run `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run test`, `npm run docs:build`, and `npm ci` before finishing.

## Critical Architectural Constraints

### 1. Cross-Platform Patterns (Mobile Compatibility)

Obsidian runs in a Webview/Capacitor on mobile. **Node.js APIs are not available natively on mobile.**

- **Pattern**: Use a platform check and dynamic import for Node-only modules.

  ```typescript
  if (Platform.isDesktopApp) {
      const cp = await import('child_process');
      // desktop-only logic
  }
  ```

- **Restriction**: Never use top-level Node.js imports (e.g., `import fs from 'fs'`) in cross-platform service code.

### 2. Data Persistence (Slim-Sync)

To protect user sync quotas and prevent merge conflicts, we use a **Split-Brain** storage model:

- **Hot Store (IndexedDB)**: Full vector index and text snippets. Local-only, high speed.
- **Cold Store (MessagePack/sync)**: "Slim" copy (vectors + graph edges only). Synced across devices.
- **Hydration**: On new devices, the plugin reconstructs the Hot Store by reading text from the vault on-demand.

### 3. Dual-Loop Search

- **Loop 1 (Reflex)**: Fast, local keyword (Orama) + vector search.
- **Loop 2 (Analyst)**: Deep RAG re-ranking using an LLM.

## Operational Protocols

### 1. Search Grounding (Mandatory)

If the user asks for "modern AI features" or "latest Obsidian API":

1. **Acknowledgement**: Explicitly state: "Checking latest documentation..."
2. **Tool Use**: Use web search/grounding tools to fetch current best practices.
3. **Fallback**: If search tools are unavailable, rely on the latest internal patterns in `devs/REFERENCE_LINKS.md`.
4. **Synthesis**: Combine findings with existing `project` patterns before proposing code.

### 2. Task Management

- **Directory**: Use the git-ignored `.tasks/` directory for planning.
- **Naming**: Use highly specific filenames (e.g., `.tasks/plan-pdf-indexing.md`) to avoid collisions.
- **Checkpoints**: Write the technical approach and **STOP** for user approval before modifying code.

### 3. Debugging Protocol
