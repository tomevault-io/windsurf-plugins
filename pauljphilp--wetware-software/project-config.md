# Manage Resource Lifecycles with Scope
**Rule:** Use Scope for fine-grained, manual control over resource lifecycles and cleanup guarantees.

### Example
This example shows how to acquire a resource (like a file handle), use it, and have `Scope` guarantee its release.

```typescript
import { Effect, Scope } from "effect";

// Simulate acquiring and releasing a resource
const acquireFile = Effect.log("File opened").pipe(
  Effect.as({ write: (data: string) => Effect.log(`Wrote: ${data}`) }),
);
const releaseFile = Effect.log("File closed.");

// Create a "scoped" effect. This effect, when used, will acquire the
// resource and register its release action with the current scope.
const scopedFile = Effect.acquireRelease(acquireFile, () => releaseFile);

// The main program that uses the scoped resource
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Effect.scoped "uses" the resource. It runs the acquire effect,
  // provides the resource to the inner effect, and ensures the
  // release effect is run when this block completes.
  const file = yield* Effect.scoped(scopedFile);

  yield* file.write("hello");
  yield* file.write("world");

  // The file will be automatically closed here.
});

Effect.runPromise(program);
/*
Output:
File opened
Wrote: hello
Wrote: world
File closed
*/
```
