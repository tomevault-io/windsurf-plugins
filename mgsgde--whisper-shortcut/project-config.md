## 📋 Project Overview

**WhisperShortcut** is a macOS menu bar app for voice-first productivity: Dictate, Dictate Prompt, Read Aloud, Prompt & Read, AI Chat, Live Meeting transcription, Smart Improvement, local Whisper dictation, and Google account tools. Xcode project, not SPM.

**Stack**: Swift 5.9+, Cocoa, AVFoundation, UserNotifications · **Target**: macOS 15.5+

## 🏗️ Architecture (Summary)

- **State machine**: Single source of truth is `AppState` in `AppState.swift` (`idle`, `recording`, `processing`, `feedback`). Always transition via AppState; never manipulate UI or flags directly.
- **Orchestration**: `MenuBarController` owns services and shortcuts; `SpeechService` holds the main logic (transcribe, executePrompt, executePromptWithVoiceResponse).
- **Chat**: `LLMChatProvider` abstracts Gemini and Grok; `ChatTools` exposes controlled local and Google tools; slash commands are typed in the composer.
- **Google integration**: `GoogleAccountOAuthService` provides Calendar, Tasks, and Gmail tokens; API clients are actors.
- **Core services**: AudioRecorder, TTSService, AudioPlaybackService, ClipboardManager, KeychainManager, AudioChunkingService, LiveMeetingRecorder.
- **Patterns**: Use `DebugLogger` only (no `print`/`NSLog`/`os_log`). UI updates on main thread (MainActor). Support cancellation in async work (`Task.checkCancellation()`, cancel methods). Typed errors + `SpeechErrorFormatter` for user messages.

## ⚡ Critical Rules

- **KISS**: Prefer the simplest, most robust solution.
- **Rebuild after changes**: After making any code or project changes, the agent must run `bash scripts/rebuild-and-restart.sh` itself (do not only suggest it). Run it once at the end of the edits so the user can test immediately.
- **Logging in code**: Use only `DebugLogger` methods; never `print()`, `NSLog()`, or `os_log()`. For **viewing** logs use skill **view-logs-via-bash**. For **debugging or adding instrumentation** (and full flow: repro plan → analyze logs) use skill **debugging-workflow**.
- **Tests**: Do not run tests from the agent; user runs them manually in Xcode.
- **Commands are slash commands only**: In this project, "commands" are always **typed** by the user: a leading slash plus a keyword (e.g. `/stop`, `/new`, `/model`). Do not implement commands as hotkeys or keyboard shortcuts; use slash commands in the chat/input and reserve hotkeys for system shortcuts (e.g. menu bar actions).
- **Language**: All user-facing text must be in **English**. This includes UI strings, confirmation dialogs, button labels, tooltips, section titles, default prompts, and examples shown to users. Prefer English for internal docs and comments too, but locale-specific examples and test data may use other languages when intentional.
- **Plans**: Shared implementation plans and specs live in `plans/`. Read the relevant file in `plans/active/` before implementing plan-driven work, and do not duplicate plans under `.cursor/` or `.claude/`.

## 🗣️ Communication

- **Understand first**: Clarify requirements and confirm understanding before implementing.

## 🚀 Run / Rebuild

```bash
bash ./scripts/rebuild-and-restart.sh                 # Debug build, production API
bash ./scripts/rebuild-and-restart.sh --development   # Debug build, local API (localhost:8080)
bash ./scripts/rebuild-and-restart.sh --app-store     # App Store scheme
```

## 🔗 Gemini API / models

When working with **Gemini models** (transcription, prompt mode, TTS, model IDs, or API issues):  

- Use the official Gemini API documentation: <https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs>  
- Always verify current model IDs using official docs and the **gemini-model-docs** skill.  
- Regularly check the **Google AI Developers Forum** for outages, deprecations, and known issues: <https://discuss.ai.google.dev/c/gemini-api/4>

## 📁 Data Directories

WhisperShortcut uses one canonical app data location so sandboxed and non-sandboxed builds share the same files:

- `~/Library/Containers/com.magnusgoedde.whispershortcut/Data/Library/Application Support/WhisperShortcut/`

When debugging, resetting, or counting interaction logs, check this canonical path. See `docs/data-directories.md` for details.
