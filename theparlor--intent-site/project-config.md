## Site Information Architecture (IA v2 — Three Pillars)

**IMPORTANT: Read `site-ia.md` for the full IA specification. This section is the summary.**

The site is organized into three pillars. The primary nav has exactly 3 links (plus logo). Each pillar has a hero page and depth pages with a sub-nav.

### Primary Nav (ALL pages)
```html
<nav class="site-nav">
  <a href="index.html" class="logo"><span>I</span>ntent</a>
  <a href="pitch.html">The Story</a>
  <a href="work-system.html">The System</a>
  <a href="architecture.html">The Build</a>
</nav>
```
One pillar link gets `class="active"` based on which pillar the current page belongs to.

### Pillar 1 — The Story (pitch.html is hero)
Pages: pitch.html, concept-brief.html, methodology.html, walkthrough.html, roadmap.html
Primary nav active: "The Story"
Sub-nav: Overview · Concept Brief · Methodology · Walkthrough · Roadmap

### Pillar 2 — The System (work-system.html is hero)
Pages: work-system.html, flow-diagram.html, system-diagram.html, schemas.html, signals.html, personas.html, dogfood.html, observe.html, event-catalog.html, getting-started.html
Primary nav active: "The System"
Sub-nav: Overview · Flow · System Map · Schemas · Signals · Voices · Dogfood · Observe · Events · Start

### Pillar 3 — The Build (architecture.html is hero)
Pages: architecture.html, agents.html, deployment.html, observability.html, arb.html, decisions.html, native-repos.html, products.html
Primary nav active: "The Build"
Sub-nav: Overview · Agents · Deployment · Observability · ARB · Decisions · Repos · Products

### Index Page
`index.html` is a meta redirect to `pitch.html`. The logo always links to `index.html`.

### Visual Brief
`visual-brief.html` is NOT a nav destination. It's a CTA link on the pitch page.

## CSS Strategy — CRITICAL RULES

**All pages link `styles.css` for shared foundation (nav, palette, typography, footer, grid, cards) AND keep page-specific CSS in inline `<style>` blocks.**

**Light pages** (methodology, concept-brief, schemas, flow-diagram, visual-brief)
Small or no `<style>` block. Most styling comes from styles.css.

**Rich pages** (pitch, dogfood, arb, roadmap, signals, architecture, agents, deployment, work-system, native-repos, walkthrough, observe, getting-started, system-diagram, observability, decisions, event-catalog)
Extensive `<style>` blocks with page-specific visual components. **Never strip or reduce inline `<style>` blocks from these pages.** The page-specific CSS IS the page's value.

## Content Preservation Rules

1. **Never reduce a page's file size by more than 20%** without explicit human approval.
2. **Never replace a page with a skeleton/placeholder.**
3. **Visual components are content.** Tech radar grids, SVG loop diagrams, comparison strips, timeline visualizations, stat box layouts — these are not decoration.
4. **When resolving merge conflicts on HTML files, prefer the LARGER version.**

## Footer (ALL pages)
```html
<footer>
  <p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/theparlor/intent">github.com/theparlor/intent</a> · Built with the Intent methodology</p>
</footer>
```

## Diagram Source Policy

**Every interactive diagram page MUST link to its Mermaid source file.** The interactive page is the storytelling surface; the Mermaid source is the working artifact engineers copy into PRs and docs. Mermaid files live in `docs/diagrams/`. See `site-ia.md` § Diagram Source Policy for the full spec.
