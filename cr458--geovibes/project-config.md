# Python Coding Standards for Geovibes

## Comments and Documentation
- Never add comments to code unless explicitly requested
- Never add inline comments
- Always include docstrings for functions, classes, and modules
- Use Google-style or NumPy-style docstrings with type hints

## Type Hints and Imports
- Always add comprehensive type hints to all functions and methods
- Use typing module imports as needed (List, Dict, Optional, Union, etc.)
- Include return type annotations
- Organize imports: standard library, third-party, local modules
- Use f-strings for string formatting

## Error Handling During Development
- DO NOT wrap code in try/except blocks during development
- Only add try/except statements when explicitly told "we are ready to finish up"
- When implementing error handling (only when requested), be specific about exception types

## Function Design
- Do not create wrapper functions for single operations
- Bad: `def load_csv(path): return pd.read_csv(path)`
- Good: Use `pd.read_csv()` directly in the code
- Only create functions when they encapsulate multiple operations or complex logic

## Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Assume Python 3.8+ unless specified otherwise
- Avoid global variables
- Prefer generators for large data processing
- Use context managers (with statements) for resource handling

## Example Good Practice:
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

def process_data_files(
    file_paths: List[str], 
    output_dir: str,
    chunk_size: Optional[int] = None
) -> Dict[str, pd.DataFrame]:
    """
    Process multiple data files in parallel.
    
    Args:
        file_paths: List of file paths to process
        output_dir: Directory to save processed files
        chunk_size: Optional chunk size for large files
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping file names to processed DataFrames
    """
    output_path = Path(output_dir)
    output_path.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    
    results = {}
    for file_path in file_paths:
        df = pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunk_size)
        results[Path(file_path).name] = df
    
    return results
```
