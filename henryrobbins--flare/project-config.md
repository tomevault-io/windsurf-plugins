# FLARE Agent Guide

This repo hosts the publishable `milp-flare` Python package and the
experiment code used to produce the FLARE paper's results. The
**FormulationBench** dataset and its `formulation-bench` loader package
live in a separate repo,
[henryrobbins/formulation-bench](https://github.com/henryrobbins/formulation-bench);
this repo consumes them as a PyPI dependency (`formulation-bench>=0.5.0`)
and, on the Lean side, as a Lake git require.

## Sub-project guides

Per-project development information lives next to each project. Read the
guide for the area you are working in instead of duplicating it here:

- **Dataset and `formulation-bench` package** — see the
  [formulation-bench repo](https://github.com/henryrobbins/formulation-bench)
  and the published [docs](https://formulation-bench.henryrobbins.com).
- **`milp-flare` package** —
  [`packages/milp_flare/AGENTS.md`](packages/milp_flare/AGENTS.md), including
  the Docker harness setup.
- **Paper landing page** — [`site/README.md`](site/README.md). Astro project
  built with `npm run dev` / `npm run build` from `site/`; deployed to
  GitHub Pages (https://flare.henryrobbins.com/) on pushes to the `site`
  branch by `.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml`. Content lives in
  [`site/src/paper.mdx`](site/src/paper.mdx).

## Experiment code (`src/`)

Not published; installed editable as the package `src`. The
[`verify/base.py`](src/verify/base.py) `ReformulationVerifier` interface is
the common contract shared by every verifier implementation; verifiers are
constructed from dict specs (loaded from YAML configs) via
[`verify/factory.py`](src/verify/factory.py).

```

└── analysis/
    └── agent_jsonl.py   # Normalizes agent JSONL traces into a CSV schema
```

## `experiments/`

Entry-point scripts plus YAML configs under `experiments/configs/`. Each
script writes a timestamped subdirectory under `runs/<timestamp>/` with
`results.jsonl` and per-pair artifacts.

- `experiments/baseline.py` — runs every configured verifier on every
  reformulation pair (multi-run aware via per-verifier `multi_run`).
- `experiments/ablation.py` — prompt-template × model sweep for `FLARE-NL`.

See the [Reproducing the paper](README.md#reproducing-the-paper) section of
the root README for invocation details.

## `scripts/`

Standalone utilities. Each script has a top-of-file docstring with full
usage; the summary below is just an index.

**Top-level**

- `scripts/report.py` — classification metrics (precision, recall, accuracy)
  for `runs/<id>/results.jsonl`; aggregated by default, per-instance with
  `-i`. Reports mean ± std across runs when `run` is set.
- `scripts/combine_runs.py` — merge multiple run directories into a new run
  by symlinking artifact dirs and merging `results.jsonl`. Later runs win on
  duplicate `(pair_id, method)`. Supports `--last N`.

**`scripts/analysis/`** — derive plots/tables from a run's normalized agent
traces (produced via `src/analysis/agent_jsonl.py`).

- `time_cost_analysis.py` — wall-clock and `$USD` summary across artifact
  dirs; aggregate by default, `-i` for per-artifact rows. Falls back to
  estimated cost via the project pricing table when the harness (e.g.
  `codex`) doesn't report `cost_usd`.
- `plot_agent_time.py` — horizontal Gantt of each artifact dir's tool
  activity over wall-clock time, colored by tool group.
- `context_analysis.py` — per-file context-read summary
  (Read/Bash/Edit/lean-lsp) with read counts, total chars, and
  ~4-chars/token estimates.

**`scripts/review/`** — LLM-assisted FLARE result inspection.

- `extract_flare_lean.py` — pull `A/Formulation.lean`, `B/Formulation.lean`,
  and `Reformulation.lean` out of every artifact dir in a run, rewriting
  imports into a flat `results/<run_id>/<problem>/<a_b>/<artifact>/` layout.
- `flare_formulation_reviewer.py` — local HTTP UI to diff extracted FLARE
  outputs against the ground-truth dataset formulation.

## Testing and coverage

The pytest config at the repo root (`pyproject.toml`) collects from:

- `tests/` (root experiment tests, currently `tests/verifiers/`)
- `packages/milp_flare/{tests,src/milp_flare}`
