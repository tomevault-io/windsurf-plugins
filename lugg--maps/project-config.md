# Agent Instructions

## General Rules

1. YOU MUST NOT do builds unless you are told to.
2. YOU MUST NOT commit changes yourself until I explicitly tell you to.
3. YOU MUST NOT create summary documents unless you are told to.
4. YOU MUST NOT add code comments that are obvious.
5. Always update relevant docs in `docs/` when making changes to components or APIs.
