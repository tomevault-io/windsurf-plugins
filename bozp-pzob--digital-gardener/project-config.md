# Aggregator Components

The `[src/aggregator/](mdc:src/aggregator)` directory contains the core logic for orchestrating the data flow.

## 1. Content Aggregator (`[ContentAggregator.ts](mdc:src/aggregator/ContentAggregator.ts)`)

This is the primary aggregator used by the main `[src/index.ts](mdc:src/index.ts)` script for continuous operation.

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Manages registered plugins: Sources, Enrichers, Storage.
    *   Initiates data fetching from sources (`fetchAndStore`).
    *   Passes fetched data through registered enrichers.
    *   Saves processed data using the registered storage plugin.
    *   (Note: Generators are managed separately by `index.ts` but interact with data produced via the aggregator and stored).
*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `registerSource(source: SourcePlugin)`
    *   `registerEnricher(enricher: EnricherPlugin)`
    *   `registerStorage(storage: StoragePlugin)`
    *   `fetchAndStore(sourceName: string)`: Fetches from a specific source, enriches, and stores.

## 2. Historical Aggregator (`[HistoricalAggregator.ts](mdc:src/aggregator/HistoricalAggregator.ts)`)

This aggregator is specifically used by the `[src/historical.ts](mdc:src/historical.ts)` script for fetching past data.

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Similar to `ContentAggregator` but designed for fetching data for specific dates or ranges.
    *   Manages sources that implement the `fetchHistorical` method.
    *   Manages registered Enrichers and Storage.
*   **Key Methods:**
    *   `registerSource(source: SourcePlugin & { fetchHistorical: Function })`
    *   `registerEnricher(enricher: EnricherPlugin)`
    *   `registerStorage(storage: StoragePlugin)`
    *   `fetchAndStore(sourceName: string, date: string)`: Fetches data for a specific date.
    *   `fetchAndStoreRange(sourceName: string, filter: DateConfig)`: Fetches data for a date range.

Both aggregators rely heavily on the plugin system and the shared interfaces defined in `[src/types.ts](mdc:src/types.ts)`.
