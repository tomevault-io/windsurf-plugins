# Project Overview: Digital Gardener

This project is Digital Gardener, a configurable system designed to cultivate content from various sources, process it using AI, and generate summaries.

## Main Entry Point

The primary execution starts in `[src/index.ts](mdc:src/index.ts)`. This script:

1.  Loads environment variables (`dotenv`).
2.  Parses command-line arguments (`--source`, `--onlyFetch`, `--output`).
3.  Dynamically loads plugins (Sources, AI Providers, Enrichers, Generators, Storage) from subdirectories within `[src/plugins/](mdc:src/plugins)` using helpers from `[src/helpers/configHelper.ts](mdc:src/helpers/configHelper.ts)`.
4.  Reads a JSON configuration file (specified by `--source`, e.g., `[config/discord-raw.json](mdc:config/discord-raw.json)`) to get plugin settings and parameters.
5.  Initializes instances of configured plugins, injecting dependencies like AI providers and storage.
6.  Instantiates the `[src/aggregator/ContentAggregator.ts](mdc:src/aggregator/ContentAggregator.ts)`.
7.  Registers the initialized plugins with the aggregator.
8.  Schedules periodic fetching for each source (`aggregator.fetchAndStore`) based on its configured interval.
9.  Schedules periodic summary generation for each generator (`generator.instance.generateContent`) based on its interval (unless `--onlyFetch` is true).
10. Can run continuously or execute once (`runOnce` setting in config).
11. Handles graceful shutdown.

## Core Concepts

*   **Configuration-driven:** Behavior is heavily defined by JSON configuration files.
*   **Plugin-based:** Functionality (data sources, AI, storage, etc.) is implemented as modular plugins.
*   **Aggregation:** The `ContentAggregator` orchestrates the flow of data from sources through enrichers to storage and triggers generators.
*   **Scheduling:** Uses `setInterval` for recurring data fetching and summary generation.
*   **Normalization:** A central `[ContentItem](mdc:src/types.ts)` interface standardizes data from different sources.

See also: `[historical-script.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/historical-script.mdc)` for fetching past data.
