# Fetch GitHub PRs with plain git

`origin` is configured with `+refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*`, so `git fetch origin` mirrors every PR to `origin/pr/<N>`. Check one out with `git switch -c pr-3 origin/pr/3`.

Plain git fetches PR commits only — for metadata (title, comments, checks, open-PR list) hit the REST API: `https://api.github.com/repos/cyberpunk2073/vam-backstage/pulls`.
