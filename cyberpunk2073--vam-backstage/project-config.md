description: How to run the vitest suite (Electron ABI, not raw vitest)
---


# Running tests

Tests touch native modules (`better-sqlite3`, `@parcel/watcher`) that are built
against **Electron's** ABI, so they must run under Electron-as-Node, not the
system `node`.

## Do

- Run via the npm script: `npm test` (wraps `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 electron … vitest run`).
- Target files/dirs by appending after `--`:

```bash
npm test -- src/main/scanner/var-reader.test.js
npm test -- src/main/            # a directory
```

- Watch mode: `npm run test:watch`.

## Don't

- Don't run `npx vitest` / `vitest` directly, and don't call the raw runner with
  system node. It loads native modules built for a different `NODE_MODULE_VERSION`
  and fails with e.g. `better_sqlite3.node was compiled against a different Node.js version`.

## Native module ABI

If you ever see a `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch, the native build is targeting
the wrong runtime. Rebuild for the runtime you need:

- `npm run native:electron` — build for Electron (required for `npm test`, `npm run dev`). Default.
- `npm run native:node` — build for system node (only if intentionally running under plain node).

`npm run native:node` breaks `npm test`; run `npm run native:electron` afterward to restore it.
