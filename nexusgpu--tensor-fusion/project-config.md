# Project Goals
TensorFusion is building large scale heterogeneous GPU pooling and scheduling AI infra using cloudnative ecosystem projects libs, help enterprise save GPU costs, simplify O&M and increase observability, boost elasticity.

Underlying tech: in this repo: Kubebulder, Scheduler, CDI. not in this repo: user-space time-divided sharing based fractional GPU, API forwarding based GPU-over-IP.

# Critical Modules
- pod mutating webhook for augment user pods, add needed inputs and outputs
- advanced scheduler with allocator/GPU-resource vertical scaler/bin-packing/rebalancer/quotas, based on schedulerFramework
- custom resource operator, GPU cluster -> pool -> gpunode -> gpu, gpunodeclaim -> node -> gpunode, maintain resources and TensorFusion components status, eval alerts etc.
- hypervisor, works like kubelet, reconcile TensorFusion workers on each gpu node, discover and bin devices, multi-process priority and autoFreeze handlers, produce metrics etc.
- server, for offering API to assign remote vGPU worker, expose system debug endpoints
- cloud provider integration (direct integration or with karpenter).
- indexallocator is a special module to resolve CDI device plugin Allocate interface can not get Pod info issue, without CDI container -> Pod matching, not possible to get advanced allocation info (hack before k8s DRA deployed). using dummy resource name and number to compose a special index pass to hypervisor. this is not general device plugin patter, need remember this context only when changing device allocation and device plugin related functions.

# Requirements

- You are professional cloudnative and AI infra engineer. High quality, robust codes with Golang and k8s best practices.
- For complex tasks, ask user to confirm the plan, then write code.
- Always be user-centric, think the whole user workflow and scenario and how a AI inference/training app running on this system for every task, no hidden logic, concise and strong type definition
- Define fields are in @api/v1 package, always think best data structure when CRD changes are needed.
- Don't abstract too much nor abstract nothing, extract interface based on business understanding.
- extract function when its larger than 50-80 lines, otherwise prefer simple single function for one responsibility of codes.
- use modern latest golang features, eg any rather than interface{}, generic typing if needed etc.
- Never reinvent wheels, think how kubernetes source codes and kubernetes SIGs do, leverage utils and constants packages and introduced dependencies.
- Always prioritize security, scalability, and maintainability.
- Think reconcile loop, memory consistency pattern, kubebuilder framework.
- Think k8s tricky issues like resource conflicts, finalizers, deepCopy rather than one field by one assignment, use equality.semantic.DeepEqual rather than hard code comparing.
- Never write large task at once, break to smaller ones
- For every task completed, run `golangci-lint run --fix` to check and fix lint issues, and run `make test` for parallel regression testing, if failed without useful debug info, try ginkgo Focused file mode or `make test-serial` to narrow down the issue
- Only write necessary comments, e.g for some complex algorithm and background info, never write stupid comment.
- Always remember to add events by kubernetes event recorder and logs for KEY code paths, which are important for user observability and troubleshooting, but events should not be too many.
- Always test-driven, USE Ginkgo to write test cases, don't write native golang unit test, review codes and refactor until test works
- When the task introduce some new memory state, consider expose it to server module for troubleshooting
