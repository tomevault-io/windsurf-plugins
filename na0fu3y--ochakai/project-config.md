# CLAUDE.md

ochakai is a knowledge store for data-analysis agents. Two decisions
frame everything: no LLM inside and no SQL execution (0081), and
zero secrets — Cloud Run IAM + Cloud SQL IAM on Google Cloud,
in-process OIDC verification off it (0086), never tokens or passwords
(0065, 0003).

## Design docs

Architecture decisions live in [docs/design](docs/design) as numbered,
immutable decision records (mostly Japanese).
[docs/design/README.md](docs/design/README.md) is the index — its
opening table says which doc describes each area today; the prose below
it carries the history, and a superseded or amended doc says so in its
`Status:` header.

A numbered doc is for a decision **a user can observe**
([0048](docs/design/0048-decision-records-for-wire-contracts.md)): the
shape of the wire, the stored form and its round trip, what identity and
provenance mean, a new Google Cloud dependency, or something ochakai
refuses to do. Internal changes that leave the outside unchanged belong
in the PR description instead. **And a number is for an area's decision,
not a rule inside it**
([0128](docs/design/0128-a-number-is-for-an-area-not-a-rule-inside-it.md)):
if the parent record plus the CHANGELOG answer the question somebody
reopens in three months, the rule goes in the PR and the CHANGELOG, not
a record. **A doc that has not reached a release is revised by replacing
it, not by taking a new number** — immutability is a promise about
decisions somebody could be depending on — and a released one is amended
by a record that restates the whole area and supersedes it, never by a
diff stacked on it. The index's opening table has a ceiling on how many
records one row may cite (`INDEX-ROW-RECORDS`, down only, checked).

When one is needed, it lands in the same PR as the change and the index
stays truthful — the `design-doc` skill has the full procedure (new
number, older docs' `Status:` headers, the index entry, and why amendment
chains get a replacement instead). The bookkeeping half of it is checked:
`cmd/ochakai/designdocs_test.go` fails on a record missing from an index,
an index that disagrees with a record's `Status:` header about whether it
is current, or a supersession recorded at only one end.

**A record has a ceiling; the corpus no longer does.** CONTRIBUTING.md
declares `RECORD-LINES` for one record's length, and a Superseded record
shrinks to a tombstone (`TOMBSTONE-LINES`); the same test file reads both
back. Over a line usually means two decisions, or a record restating one
that already exists — not a record that needs denser prose. **What is no
longer counted is the total**: `RECORD-CORPUS-LINES` is retired, with
`DOC-LINES` and `REST-LINES`, because the paragraphs those ceilings asked
for became the largest thing they produced (docs/surface.md's 上限
section). 0048 narrowed what earns a number and 0128 narrowed what a
number is for; a corpus growing under those two rules is growing
correctly, and one growing against them is a review problem rather than
an arithmetic one. Records have grown 4.1x since v0.10.0 against non-test
Go's 2.5x, and it is the tombstone rule that keeps their line total under
the code's.

## Surface, and the default answer

What ochakai costs the person using it is its **surface** — the endpoints
they can call, the tool schemas that spend their agent's context, the
commands they have to learn, the variables they have to set, the pages of
the manual they have to read — not the code behind it.
[docs/surface.md](docs/surface.md) counts all nine dimensions in one
place, and `cmd/ochakai/surface_test.go` fails when the count and the
build disagree, so an addition shows up as a heading moving from `(19)`
to `(20)` instead of disappearing into a spec diff. **Prose is counted
too**, in pages: adding one to the manual moves `DOC` from `(27)` to
`(28)`. The line totals of the manual and the contract are no longer
capped — those ceilings are retired and 上限 says why — so a page that
grows without a new page appearing is caught by review, not by CI.

That document opens with the **eight conditions** ochakai exists to
satisfy — the knowledge stays the user's, secret-zero on Google Cloud,
OKF v0.2, no forward-deployed engineer, usable from Claude Code, a small
embeddable REST API, a measurable improvement loop, and being one of the
best choices available to a Japanese-speaking user weighing similar
services. Read them before proposing anything a user would touch. **A
proposal that serves none of the eight is one to decline**, and saying so
is the more useful answer; naming which one it serves is where a proposal
that survives begins.
Serving a condition is necessary and not sufficient — every condition has
infinitely many mechanisms that would serve it.

**The default answer to a new feature is no.** Before writing code that
widens a surface, answer that document's three questions in the PR
description: who actually got stuck, whether an existing surface already
covers it (if it does, don't add), and what can be folded away in
exchange. Per-surface defaults are
[0067](docs/design/0067-four-faces-and-what-they-decline.md) — REST is the only
contract, CLI is the completeness surface, MCP's default is *no* because
tool schemas are paid for out of the agent's context window, and the web
