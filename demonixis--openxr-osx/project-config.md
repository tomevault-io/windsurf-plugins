# OpenXR OSX Runtime

OpenXR runtime for macOS that brings PC-style OpenXR support to Apple Silicon Macs without Windows.
The project currently combines a macOS runtime, a unified macOS/iOS viewer with `Simulator` and
`StereoView` modes, a first-pass visionOS viewer, and a Quest/Pico-oriented streaming stack with an
Android client scaffold.
The repository also includes a native SwiftUI macOS companion app for runtime configuration and
runtime registration workflows.

**Current state:** Metal/core runtime, Vulkan interop, controller and hand input paths, loader-backed
runtime tests, `XR_EXT_conformance_automation`, `XR_EXT_hand_interaction`, and `XR_EXT_debug_utils`
are in place. The Quest/Android client now feeds real `XR_EXT_hand_tracking` joints into the runtime
matches per-frame render poses for headset compositor reprojection, and enables a first-pass dynamic
`XR_FB_foveation` path when the headset supports it. The visionOS
viewer now starts from a minimal floating search window, enters immersive VR automatically when the
stream connects, and sends head pose, hand joints, and first-pass tracked accessory controller data
while the immersive space is open. The macOS SwiftUI apps now produce sandboxed App Store/TestFlight
archives.
As of March 17, 2026, the pinned non-interactive OpenXR-CTS baseline is fully green locally:
63 passed, 36 skipped, 0 failed.

## Repository Rules

- **Always build and verify before declaring success** — run the macOS build + tests and/or Android build as appropriate before saying everything works
- **Always update `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the relevant files in `docs/` when making significant project changes**
- All dependencies are fetched via CMake FetchContent
- All source code and documentation must be in English
- Project-owned source code is licensed under MPL-2.0; preserve SPDX headers and keep third-party code under its upstream license.

## Quality Bar

- Keep patches focused and avoid silent behavior changes.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes. If a test cannot be added, explain why.
- Preserve non-blocking frame submission and latency-sensitive paths.
- Do not add new dependencies without a clear reason.

## Documentation Rules

`README.md` must stay short. Put detailed build, platform, protocol, simulator, and test guidance in `docs/`.

Avoid duplicating the same guidance in multiple files. If commands, platform status, or CTS results change, update the single page that owns that topic and keep cross-links accurate.

## Important Technical Constraints

- The runtime does not link directly against Vulkan. Resolve Vulkan functions through the app-provided loader path.
- `Session::EndFrame()` must stay non-blocking.
- The streaming encoder queue is latest-frame-only.
- Headset refresh rate is negotiated from the client.
- Latency reports feed bounded pose prediction.
- Headset clients must match `VIDEO_FLAG_RENDER_POSE` metadata to the decoded frame before projection submission.
- Quest hand tracking depends on the Android manifest permission `com.oculus.permission.HAND_TRACKING` and the optional `oculus.software.handtracking` feature.
- The action system is profile-aware and must not regress to hard-forcing `KHR simple_controller`.
- `xrLocateSpacesKHR` is accepted as an alias of the OpenXR 1.1 `xrLocateSpaces` entry point.
- Reference spaces currently enumerate `VIEW`, `LOCAL`, `LOCAL_FLOOR`, and `STAGE`.
- Runtime configuration is loaded from `~/Library/Application Support/OpenXR-OSX/openxr_osx.toml` with compatibility fallback for older local paths.

## Verification Commands

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
xcodebuild -project "clients/companion/OpenXR OSX Companion.xcodeproj" \
  -scheme "OpenXR OSX Companion" \
  -configuration Debug \
  build

xcodebuild -project "clients/simulator/OpenXR Simulator.xcodeproj" \
  -scheme "OpenXR Simulator" \
