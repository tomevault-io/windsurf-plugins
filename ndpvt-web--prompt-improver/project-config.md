description: Optimize prompts for better AI responses. Use when user asks to improve a prompt, refine a prompt, make a prompt better, optimize prompting, "Aristotelian", "first principles", or "proof-based" , review their prompt, or says "/improve-prompt". Transforms vague requests into clear, specific, actionable, logic-based prompts.

# Prompt Improver

Transform vague prompts into clear, specific, actionable ones for better AI responses.

## Workflow

1. **Gather context** - Use AskUserQuestion as many times as needed to resolve any doubts or assumptions

2. **Analyze** - Identify what's unclear, missing, or ambiguous

3. **Improve** - Apply the Aristotelian framework 

4. **Present** - Show improved prompt with key changes explained

5. **Refine** - Ask if user wants adjustments

## Aristotelian Mode (First Principles)

Always actived. produce a prompt that **instructs the receiving LLM to reason from first principles** when executing the task.

The prompt-improver does NOT do the Aristotelian reasoning itself. It crafts a prompt that tells the LLM to:

1. **Gather context from user** - Ask what system capabilities, tools, and constraints exist. Bake known context (root access, AI model, available tools, domain) directly into the prompt as given axioms.

2. **Embed the reasoning directive** - The improved prompt tells the LLM to:
   - Identify the atomic, irreducible truths of the task before acting
   - Interrogate each truth: "Can this be decomposed further? If removed, does the task break? Does it contradict anything?"
   - Discard anything that is not strictly necessary
   - Build the solution deductively, where every action traces to a stated axiom
   - Verify the result against the axioms at the end

3. **Structure the output prompt** with these sections:
   ```
   REASONING DIRECTIVE: [Instruct the LLM to use first-principles reasoning]
   GIVEN AXIOMS: [Known truths about system, capabilities, domain -- baked in]
   TASK: [What to accomplish]
   METHOD: [Tell LLM to discover task-specific axioms, interrogate them, then build deductively]
   VERIFICATION: [Tell LLM to check its result against its axioms]
   ```

**Output format for Aristotelian mode:**
```markdown
## Analysis
[What context was embedded and why]

## Improved Prompt (Aristotelian)
[The complete prompt with reasoning directive, given axioms, task, method, and verification]

## What This Prompt Does
- Tells the LLM to [specific reasoning behavior]
- Bakes in [specific context] so the LLM does not hallucinate it
```
