# CLAUDE.md — HeyMeg Brand Journey Tracker

## MegAI Prompt Logic

- All MegAI prompt logic lives in `src/lib/megai-prompt.ts`. Do not move it elsewhere.
- Never rewrite or refactor `lib/megai-prompt.ts` unless explicitly asked to do so.

## Content Ideas

- Content ideas must always be theme-specific and tailored to the user's current brand journey stage. Never generate generic or one-size-fits-all suggestions.

## Preventing Repetition

- Always pass `previousIdeas` to API calls that generate content ideas. This ensures the AI does not repeat suggestions the user has already seen or dismissed.
