# Cursor Rules — NATS Plugin for OPA

You are editing **github.com/permitio/opa-nats**. The library implements an **LRU cache backed by NATS Key-Value (JetStream)** that *selectively* overrides OPA's runtime store for paths matched by regexes. It is **not** a full OPA storage implementation.

## Core Principles

1. **Do not change the contract**: This is a cache + path router around an embedded `storage.Store`. Only `Read`/`Write` are overridden; everything else must go to the embedded store.
2. **Regex decides routing**: `handled_paths_regex` is the single source of truth. If it’s empty, nothing is routed to NATS.
3. **NATS is source of truth for handled paths**: Reads fall back to NATS on cache miss. Writes go to NATS, then update the LRU cache.
4. **Keep the cache simple**: No hidden global state, no additional layers unless explicitly justified.
5. **Production-grade (practical) engineering**: clear errors, timeouts, reconnect logic, metrics/status surface, and structured logs.

## Go / Tooling

- **Go version**: match the `go.mod` (bump only with CI + docs update).
- **Linting**: keep `golangci-lint` clean; fix or justify with inline comments.
- **Static analysis**: `go vet`, `staticcheck` where possible.
- **Error handling**: wrap with `%w`; give context (`fmt.Errorf("connect NATS: %w", err)`).
- **Context**: every external I/O (NATS ops, watchers) must accept `context.Context`.
- **Generics**: use only when it simplifies code meaningfully.

## Concurrency & Lifecycles

- Watchers/goroutines must:
  - Respect `ctx.Done()`.
  - Return on shutdown.
  - Avoid leaks (document ownership & stop semantics).
- Reconnect logic:
  - Honor `max_reconnect_attempts` and `reconnect_wait`.
  - Surface status to OPA status API.

## Configuration Rules

- Keep config in `natsstore.Config`. Add fields only when needed, document them in README and code comments.
- Validate config on startup (URLs, TTLs, bucket, auth mode exclusivity).
- If both `credentials` and `token`/`username` are provided, error out with a helpful message.

## Path Handling

- **Never** route non-matching paths to NATS.
- Path mapping: OPA `["data","schemas","user"]` → NATS key `data.schemas.user`. Any change here must be explicitly documented and migration noted.
- Regex must be compiled once and reused.

## Logging & Monitoring

- Structured logging only (key/value). No `Printf`.
- Respect `log_level` in config.
- Status API should expose:
  - Cache size & capacity.
  - NATS connection state.
  - Trigger/watch count.
  - Policy count (from embedded store).

## Testing

- **Unit tests** for:
  - Regex routing (hit/miss).
  - Cache TTL behavior.
  - NATS read/write fallbacks.
  - Reconnect logic.
- **Integration tests** (with JetStream) behind a build tag (e.g. `integration`).
- **Race detector** (`-race`) must pass.
- Maintain/raise coverage; do not merge coverage regressions without rationale.

## CI

- Do not break `.github/workflows/pr_checks.yml`.
- Add new tooling steps only if they’re reproducible locally.

## Commits & PRs

- Use **Conventional Commits**:
  - `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `chore:`
- Each PR must:
  - Explain what path(s) it touches (NATS vs embedded store).
  - List any config or status API changes.
  - Include tests or justify why not.

## Docs

- README is the single entry point for users. If you add/rename:
  - Config fields
  - Status metrics
  - Path mapping logic
  then **update README, examples, and comments**.
- Avoid marketing-y fluff and filler words.

## Security

- Never log secrets (token, username, password, creds path contents).
- TLS flags must be honored; `tls_insecure` defaults to `false`.
- Encourage secure defaults in examples.

## Troubleshooting & Errors

- Emit actionable errors:
  - Connection failures: include URL and selected auth mode (not the secret).
  - Bucket not found: suggest permission or creation options.
- Prefer retryable errors where appropriate; otherwise fail fast with context.

## Style

- Keep files short and focused. Split out packages only when it clarifies ownership/boundaries.
- Prefer small, cohesive interfaces.
- Name things after what they *do* (e.g., `pathRouter`, `kvBackedCache`).

## Banned Phrases (do not write these)

- dynamic world
- evolving landscape
- the world of
- digital age
- ever-evolving
- digital landscape
- robust
- myriad

## When You’re Unsure

- Default to the simplest change that preserves public behavior.
- Add a small test that demonstrates the intent.
- Leave a short comment pointing back to the README section that explains the behavior.
