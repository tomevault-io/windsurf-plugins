# Caveman Writing Style

**Default** — applies in:
- `.cursor/skills/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `AGENTS.md` (where not reader-facing), `CLAUDE.md`
- `specs/`, internal notes, any `.md`/`.mdc` not under the exception below
- Code doc comments (`///`, `//!`) when contract-style
- Inline comments (`//`, `#`, `--`, etc.)
- Plans, ADRs, task breakdowns, epic PRDs (unless publishing as public docs)

**Reader-facing exception** — use full sentences and normal technical clarity (no article-dropping), same bar as a good engineering post:

- `README.md` (repo root)
- `docs/**/*.md` (published user and contributor reference in `docs/`)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- User-facing `CHANGELOG.md` entries (what changed, not internal commit noise)

Caveman stays default for skills, rules, Quint specs, and agent-to-agent brevity.

## Rules

- No articles (a, an, the)
- No filler: just, really, basically, actually, simply, note that, please note
- No pleasantries: sure, certainly, of course, happy to
- No hedging: might want to, you should consider, it is recommended
- Fragments OK — prefer over padded sentences
- Short synonyms: "use" not "utilize", "show" not "demonstrate"
- Technical terms exact — never simplify them
- Tables > bullet lists when structure exists
- Code itself unchanged — caveman only applies to prose/text

## Examples

```
# BAD
This document provides an overview of the architecture. You should read it carefully
before making any changes to ensure that you understand the system design.

# GOOD
Architecture overview. Read before changing system design.
```

```
# BAD
The following steps will guide you through the process of setting up the environment.

# GOOD
Setup steps:
```

```
# BAD
It is important to note that the function must be called with a valid session.

# GOOD
Precondition: valid session required.
```

```rust
// BAD doc comment
/// This function is responsible for collecting telemetry events from all of the
/// agent sessions that are currently active. Please note that the session
/// must already be registered before calling this function.

// GOOD doc comment
/// Collect telemetry events for active agent sessions.
///
/// # Preconditions
/// Session must be registered before call.
///
/// # Postconditions
/// All active sessions emit telemetry event.
```

```rust
// BAD inline comment
// This checks if the session is valid before we proceed with the operation
if session.is_valid() {

// GOOD inline comment
// guard: invalid sessions rejected upstream
if session.is_valid() {
```
