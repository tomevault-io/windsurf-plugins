# Subagent-First

Spawn subagent when ANY condition met. No vague "use liberally".

## Spawn Triggers

| Condition | Type |
|---|---|
| Explore 3+ files for answer | `explore` |
| 5+ shell commands for one task | `shell` |
| Task likely >15 turns | `explore` or `generalPurpose` |
| Browser/MCP test >2 actions | `browser-use` |
| Best-of-N experiment needed | `best-of-n-runner` |
| Broad codebase orientation | `explore` |
| Multi-file refactor | `generalPurpose` |

## Why

`explore` subagent: reads ~50k tokens → returns ~2k summary. 25× compression.
Main context stays clean. Big sessions = big cost.

## Subagent Types

- `explore` — read-only codebase search, answers questions about structure
- `shell` — git ops, build commands, sequential terminal tasks
- `generalPurpose` — multi-step implementation, research
- `browser-use` — UI testing, web automation
- `best-of-n-runner` — isolated parallel experiments in git worktrees

## Anti-Patterns

- Reading 5 files inline when `explore` would compress them
- Running 10 shell commands in main context when `shell` subagent handles them
- Keeping task context in main window past 15 turns

## Default

When in doubt: spawn. Cost of wrong subagent < cost of bloated main context.
