# Agent Workflow

## Plan Mode Default

ANY task with 3+ steps or architectural decisions → plan mode.
Goes sideways → STOP, re-plan immediately. No pushing through.
Write specs upfront to reduce ambiguity.

```rust
// GOOD — pause before touching multiple modules:
// Switch to plan mode, map trait changes + module
// impact before writing any code

// BAD — jump straight into editing 5 files without
// scoping the work first
```

## Subagent Strategy

Use subagents liberally. Keep main context window clean.
Offload research, exploration, parallel analysis. One task per subagent.

```
# GOOD — parallel, focused subagents
spawn subagent A → explore telemetry pipeline
spawn subagent B → trace session event flow

# BAD — pile all exploration into main context,
# bloating it before starting actual work
```

## Verification Before Done

Never mark complete without proving it works.
Run full test suite. Ask: "Would staff engineer approve this?"

```bash
# GOOD
cargo test && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check

# BAD — visual check + "looks good" without running tests
```

## Autonomous Bug Fixing

Bug report → fix it. No hand-holding. Run tests to find root cause.

```bash
# GOOD — trace failure, fix root cause, re-run
cargo test

# BAD — "Should I change the schema or the query?"
# Find and fix root cause yourself
```
