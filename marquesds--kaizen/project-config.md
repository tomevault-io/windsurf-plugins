# Read Hygiene

`read-cap.sh` blocks unsliced reads >150 lines (>300 for `.md`/`.mdc`). Lockfiles exempt.

## Tier 1 — Signature Scan (always try first)

Grep for function/struct signatures before reading full file.

```
Grep: pattern="pub fn " glob="**/*.rs"
```

## Tier 2 — Offset/Limit Slice

Know section? Read only that region.

```
Read: path="src/collector.rs" offset=45 limit=30
```

## Tier 3 — Full Read (last resort)

Only if file is small (<150 lines) or genuinely need whole thing.
Large `.md`/`.mdc` docs: read by section with offset+limit.

## Why

Full reads on large files waste tokens and trigger hook block.
Grep signatures + targeted slices deliver same context at 10–20× lower cost.

## Hook Behaviour

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| content lines ≤ threshold | allow |
| content lines > 150 (non-md) | deny with message |
| content lines > 300 (md/mdc) | deny with message |
| lockfile path | allow unconditionally |
