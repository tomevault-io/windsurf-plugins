# Helps AI understand project context and preferences

<development_process>

1. Planning and Validation:

- Always start with a clear plan before making code changes
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- Validate approach with user before proceeding with implementation
- Consider mocking/stubbing complex integrations first
- Identify dependencies and potential conflicts upfront

2. Incremental Development:

- Start with minimal viable implementations
- Prefer multiple small, focused changes over large refactors
- Complete and validate one step before moving to the next
- Order steps from least to most complex:
  1. UI/Component structure
  2. Type definitions and interfaces
  3. Basic routing and navigation
  4. Core business logic
  5. Data integration
  6. Error handling and edge cases
  7. Performance optimizations

3. Implementation Guidelines:

- Mock data and services initially when building UI before continuing
- Implement basic happy path first, then add error handling
- Test each layer before moving to the next
- Document assumptions and decisions
- Consider rollback strategy for each change

4. Communication:

- Present clear plan before starting implementation
- Break down complex changes into discrete steps
- Get confirmation before proceeding with major changes
- Highlight potential risks and tradeoffs
- Suggest alternative approaches when relevant

5. Validation Steps:

- Confirm requirements are clear
- Verify approach aligns with existing patterns
- Check for potential conflicts with existing code
- Consider impact on existing features
- Plan testing strategy

6. Testing Workflow:

- Write unit tests alongside implementation
- Run tests with "bun run test:unit" after changes
- Check types with "bun run check-types"
- Run linter with "bun run lint" before completing changes
- Ensure all tests pass before handing back to user
- Follow test patterns:
  1. Arrange - Set up test data and conditions
  2. Act - Execute the code being tested
  3. Assert - Verify the results
- Test categories to include:
  1. Happy path - Expected successful scenarios
  2. Edge cases - Boundary conditions
  3. Error handling - Expected failure scenarios
  4. Input validation - Data validation rules
  5. Integration points - Service boundaries

7. E2E Testing with Playwright:

- Add or update Playwright tests when making significant UI changes
- Focus on critical user journeys and main functionality
- Run "bun run test:e2e" after major UI changes
- Use role-based selectors for better accessibility and stability
- Follow best practices:
  1. Use role-based selectors as primary choice (getByRole)
  2. Use text content as secondary choice (getByText)
  3. Use data-testid as last resort for complex cases
  4. Test real user interactions
  5. Verify visual and functional changes
- Test structure:
  1. Page object patterns for reusability
  2. Descriptive test names
  3. Clear arrange-act-assert blocks
  4. Proper error handling
  5. Appropriate timeouts and waits
- File organization:
  1. Tests in app/e2e directory
- Development workflow:
  1. Run dev server separately
  2. Use VSCode test explorer for development
  3. Use terminal for CI-like execution
  4. View reports at http://localhost:9323
- Common commands:
  1. bun run test:e2e - Run all tests
- Test patterns:
  1. Wait for networkidle on navigation
  2. Use explicit timeouts for critical elements
  3. Store locators in variables for reuse
  4. Clear comments explaining test flow
  5. Verify both presence and functionality

<framework_preferences>

1. Framework Requirements:

- TanStack Router for routing
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- TanStack Table for data grids
- TanStack Form for form handling
- TypeScript required
- React Context for client state

2. UI Components:

- shadcn/ui components
- Lucide Icons
- Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first configuration, no tailwind.config.js)
  - All configuration in CSS using @tailwind directives
  - Font families and other theme options defined in CSS variables
  - No JavaScript configuration file needed

3. Data Layer:

- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Drizzle-valibot for schema validation
- PostgreSQL (via Neon) as database
- TanStack Start server functions for API

4. Validation Patterns:

- Use drizzle-valibot to define base schemas from database tables
- Derive form and API schemas from base drizzle-valibot schemas
- Reuse schemas across client and server validation
- Prefer server-side validation as final authority

5. Error Handling:

- Use ValiError for validation errors
- Propagate errors to UI with proper typing
- Include error boundaries at route level

6. Type Safety:

- Prefer inference over explicit types when possible
- Use strict TypeScript checks
- Maintain end-to-end type safety with Drizzle

7. Form Patterns:

- Create reusable form components for entity types
- Use TanStack Form's useForm hook with proper TypeScript types
- Define form schemas using drizzle-valibot
- Separate form field types from API types when needed
- Handle form submission with proper error handling
- Use optimistic updates for better UX
- Include loading states and disable controls during submission
