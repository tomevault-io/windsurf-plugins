## Beans OpenSpec Integration

When I refer to issues like <this-dirname>-rn3b checkout the task
in @.beans/<this-dirname>-rn3b-*.md

In this project we will use these tasks as epics for making openspec proposals.

Run the `beans prime` command to know how beans work.

WHEN you create a proposal at a link to this task in the proposal.md.
WHEN a bean is used to create an proposal change the status to "in-progress"
WHEN a proposal is archived add the link to the archived proposal in the frontmatter of this task like this:

```
openspec-link: openspec/changes/archive/....
```

You are allowed to update these statuses in the task frontmatter:

- in-progress
- todo
- draft
- completed
- scrapped

When making changes you are allowed to update the date/time in `updated_at` in the task frontmatter

Besides updating status and openspec-link, you are NOT ALLOWED to modify the contents of the task file.

## Git/jj

- We use jj
- I don't want Claude to appear as committer or coworker in the git-history

## OpenSpec Archive triggers

WHEN /opsx:archive is called the work should be made ready for merging in bookmark main.

Run these steps in order:

1. jj describe
2. the changelog should also be updated. Each entry headline (the `- **name** — summary` bullet) MUST be <= 80 characters; put detail and `See [proposal]/[ADR]` links on indented sub-bullets below it, not in the headline.
