# AGENTS.md

## Project Context

LunarNX is a Nintendo Switch homebrew Xbox Remote Play client. The codebase is
early-stage and prioritizes getting a reliable end-to-end stream running on real
Switch hardware over reducing implementation complexity.

Key areas:

- `src/auth/`: Microsoft/Xbox authentication and token storage.
- `src/api/`: HTTP client and Xbox REST API calls.
- `src/app/`: Xbox session, SDP/ICE, WebRTC transport, and stream controller.
- `src/webrtc/`: wrapper around libpeer.
- `src/stream/`: media pipeline, H.264/Opus decode, render/audio stats.
- `src/ui/`: Borealis UI activities and stream overlays.
- `tools/mock_xbox/`: local mock Xbox WebRTC server for simulator testing.
- `tools/libpeer_legacy/`: tracked patch for the ignored local libpeer checkout.
- `docs/ryujinx_testing.md`: current Ryubing/Ryujinx test workflow.

## Hard Constraints

- Do not build Switch-targeted libraries on macOS. Use Docker/devkitA64 for all
  Switch libraries and Switch NRO builds.
- Prefer `devkitpro/devkita64:20251117` for current Switch builds unless the
  user asks for a different image.
- Keep dependency usage aligned with Moonlight-Switch or wiliwili when this repo
  uses the same dependency class. If a library is unavailable in the Docker
  image, build it inside Docker.
- The active WebRTC path is the legacy local `lib/libpeer` checkout. It is
  ignored by the main repo; do not try to commit it directly. Reproducible
  libpeer changes belong in `tools/libpeer_legacy/legacy-libpeer-switch.patch`
  and `tools/libpeer_legacy/README.md`.
- Do not switch to `WEBRTC_PROVIDER=upstream` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not remove the legacy libpeer packet-buffer fix. `CONFIG_MTU` is the RTP
  packetization size; the inbound UDP receive buffer is `CONFIG_PACKET_BUFFER_SIZE`.
- App startup should stay light. Network failures must show errors and must not
  prevent the app from opening.
- Keep Switch NRO BSS below 32 MiB. This is a LunarNX regression guard based on
  known-working LunarNX, Moonlight-Switch, and wiliwili packages, not a general
  Switch platform limit. Do not add large static buffers or static fallback
  heaps. Use libnx's default dynamic heap initialization, as Moonlight-Switch
  does, unless real-hardware evidence requires a different implementation.
- Do not eagerly construct or start streaming controllers before the user enters
  the relevant flow.
- Do not add Applet Mode blocking pages unless the user explicitly asks.
- PlayStation code lives in `src/ps/` and links against chiaki-ng (AGPL-3.0).
  Keep PS protocol code isolated from Xbox modules. The combined binary when
  the PS path is linked must be distributed under AGPL-3.0 terms.
- PlayStation PSN Remote requires the bundled curl 8.x WebSocket build, json-c,
  and miniupnpc. Keep `CURL_PROVIDER=moonlight` for combined Xbox/PlayStation
  Switch builds; devkitPro/wiliwili curl 7.69 cannot open `wss://` signaling.
- Never commit tokens, auth files, simulator data dirs, generated logs, or
  generated NRO/build artifacts. This includes PS credential files
  (ps_credentials.json, ps_token.json, psn_*.json).

## Build Commands

Switch builds must use Docker:

```sh
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work \
  devkitpro/devkita64:20251117 bash -lc '
    set -e
    export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
    export PATH=/opt/devkitpro/devkitA64/bin:/opt/devkitpro/tools/bin:$PATH
    make -f Makefile.switch -j$(nproc) \
      NETWORK_DIAG=0 CURL_PROVIDER=moonlight CURL_VERIFY=0 \
      CURL_VERBOSE=0 CURL_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
  '
```

For a clean Switch rebuild, run `make -f Makefile.switch clean` inside the same
Docker environment before the build command.

Desktop builds/tests may use macOS system libraries because they are not Switch
artifacts:

```sh
make -f Makefile.desktop
make -f Makefile.desktop auth_test
```

## Test Commands

Run focused Python regressions after WebRTC, session, RTP, data channel, or
stream startup changes:

```sh
python3 tests/xbox_stream_session_order_test.py
python3 tests/libpeer_sctp_config_test.py
python3 tests/libpeer_dtls_read_loop_test.py
python3 tests/datachannel_ppid_test.py
python3 tests/switch_nro_bss_test.py
```

Run formatting whitespace checks before finishing:

```sh
git diff --check
```

For simulator testing, prefer Ryubing Canary 1.3.333 and follow
`docs/ryujinx_testing.md`. Avoid raw Ryubing stdout/stderr logs for long runs;
they can grow extremely large. Use the app log instead:

```sh
$HOME/work/self/ryujinx-data/sdcard/switch/LunarNX/lunarnx.log
```

For an interactive cloud-stream test where the user will click inside the
emulated LunarNX window, launch the Canary app through macOS LaunchServices.
Keep `--no-gui`: it skips the Ryubing manager while still showing the emulated
game window. Direct `nohup` launches from an agent tool shell may exit when that
shell finishes.

```sh
open -na /tmp/ryubing-canary-1.3.333/Ryujinx.app --args \
  --no-gui \
  --root-data-dir "$HOME/work/self/ryujinx-data" \
  --disable-file-logging \
  --disable-docked-mode \
  --ignore-missing-services \
  --use-hypervisor false \
  --enable-internet-connection \
  "$HOME/work/self/LunarNX/build/switch/LunarNX.nro"
```
