# Git branches

- Base all work on `main`. Do not commit implementation directly to `main` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Create a branch before code changes: `git checkout -b <name>`.
- Never force-push `main`/`master`. Never `git config`. Never skip hooks. Never destructive git (hard reset, force push) unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Names (`type/area-short-name`)

| Type | When |
| --- | --- |
| `feat/` | New behavior (interceptor, classifier, sandbox, rag, action, api, dashboard, eval) |
| `fix/` | Bug |
| `docs/` | Documentation only |
| `chore/` | Scaffold, deps, CI glue (no product behavior) |
| `eval/` | Held-out harness, splits, frozen pins |

`area` is one of: `interceptor`, `classifier`, `sandbox`, `rag`, `reasoner`, `action`, `api`, `dashboard`, `eval`, `docs`, `policy`.

```
✅ feat/interceptor-lockfile-extract
✅ fix/sandbox-canary-paths
✅ docs/implementation-phases
❌ SentryHulud-final
❌ feature/new
❌ alfred-wip
```

- One concern per branch. Do not mix interceptor + sandbox + RAG in one branch.
- Dataset/corpus work: `feat/eval-metadata-labels` (or `eval/...`). Never put ChainDrop into train on a “quick” branch.
- After the user asks for a PR, push with `-u` and open the PR against `main`.
