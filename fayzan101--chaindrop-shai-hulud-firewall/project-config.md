# Pull requests

Only open a PR when the user asks. Use `gh pr create` (not the GitHub website). Push first if the branch has no upstream.

## Before opening

In parallel: `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git diff main...HEAD`, and whether the branch tracks origin. Do not commit secrets, `.env`, or malware blobs.

## Title

`<type>(<area>): <imperative why/what>` — match the branch type.

```
✅ feat(interceptor): extract lifecycle scripts from lockfiles without executing them
❌ update stuff
```

## Body (required HEREDOC)

```markdown
## Summary
- 1–3 bullets on **why** this change exists (user-facing / pipeline stage).
- Name the implementation phase (0–8) if applicable.
- Call out held-out / ChainDrop / sandbox impact if any.

## Changes
- Files/areas touched (interceptor, classifier, docs, …).
- Schema or `feature_schema_version` / `model_version` / `corpus_version` bumps.

## Test plan
- [ ] Command or fixture used (e.g. `fixtures/benign-lockfile`)
- [ ] Lifecycle scripts are **not** executed on the host/runner
- [ ] No secrets in logs or the diff
- [ ] Held-out split unchanged (or explain)
- [ ] Docs updated if behavior or an interface changed

## Security
- Sandbox / fail-closed / dual-use: what this PR does **not** enable.
```

If the PR is docs-only, keep Summary + Test plan (“docs render / links”). If it is eval/corpus, explicitly state ChainDrop stays `heldout`.

## After create

Return the PR URL. Do not merge unless asked. Do not `--no-verify`. Do not mention `cursor.com` or Cursor product URLs in the title or body.
