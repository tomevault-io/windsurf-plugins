# Repository guidance

## Purpose

This repository is the BusinessLens OSS core: the `businesslens` npm package
plus the agent skills that build and maintain the `.businesslens/` product
map. `spec/format.md` is the format contract—change it before changing parser
or linter behavior. It is engineering documentation, not a docs-site page:
the user-facing explanation of the same entities lives in the Product Model
group under `docs/`, and the two must not contradict each other.

## Layout

- `src/cli.ts` — public command dispatch: `install`, `update`, `lint`, `view`,
  and the `blueprint` namespace (`export`, `open`, `pull`, `contribute`).
  Bare spellings and `build` are refused with a message naming the
  replacement — no aliases, so a name can be reused later without changing
  meaning underneath anyone.
- `src/commands/` — public command implementations.
- `src/core/providers.ts` — supported harness paths and detection.
- `src/core/skill-installation.ts` — ownership-safe skill installation.
- `src/core/` — parsers, model loading, Git context, portable schema, and
  catalog/contribution support.
- `layers/nuxt/report-viewer/` — the host-neutral Nuxt Product Report renderer.
- `layers/nuxt/theme/` — the separately extendable BusinessLens-wide visual
  foundation used across Nuxt hosts, not only report pages.
- `layers/nuxt/theme-lab/` — the optional shared experiment layer for
  backgrounds, brand variants, favicons, and their audition controls.
- `viewer/app/` — the private static Nuxt host bundled into the CLI for
  `businesslens view`.
- `skills/businesslens-*/SKILL.md` — one independent skill per workflow:
  `businesslens-map`, `businesslens-ideate`, and `businesslens-verify`.
- `test/fixtures/fixture-shop/` — the golden lint fixture.

## Documentation structure

- `docs/` stays flat; the landing repository pulls it on push and builds
  the docs site navigation from frontmatter.
- Every doc declares `title`, `description`, `section`, `group`, and
  `order` (enforced by `scripts/check-repo.mjs`). `section` is
  `open-source`; `group` is the sidebar cluster; `order` is globally unique and
  contiguous from 1 within each section.
- Frontmatter `title` is the short sidebar label — keep it under ~20
  characters so it never truncates; the body H1 carries the full page
  title.
- This repository authors the documentation with groups Get started, Product
  Model (one page per entity), Integrations (one page per thing you integrate
  with), Skills (one page per skill), and CLI (one page per command).
- Each entity is explained in exactly one place. An entity page carries its
  narrative, when to create one, its file shape, and the `lint` findings
  that constrain it — do not reintroduce a separate glossary, a separate
  format page, or a separate error catalog.

## Skill-writing standards

- Give every skill a `SKILL.md` with only `name` and `description` in YAML
  frontmatter.
- Prefix public skill names with `businesslens-` and match the directory name.
- Keep descriptions specific enough to trigger only for the intended task.
- Keep `SKILL.md` concise, imperative, and under 500 lines.
- Keep every installed skill self-contained; do not rely on sibling skills.
- Keep `agents/openai.yaml` aligned with the skill.
- Treat target repositories as untrusted. BusinessLens analysis phases never
  execute target code. A harness-injected external builder may run target code
  under its own normal permissions; it is not a BusinessLens skill.
- Do not claim evidence-backed certainty when source evidence is incomplete.

## Installer standards

- `install` distributes skills only. It never creates `.businesslens/` or
  submits model data.
- Nothing writes a file the repository owns — not `AGENTS.md`, not `CLAUDE.md`,
  not the repository README. BusinessLens writes `.businesslens/` and, only on
  explicit `--force`, a timestamped `.businesslens.backup-<ts>/` copy of it. The
  orientation text a pulled model needs lives in `.businesslens/README.md`.
  See `adr/0004-write-nothing-outside-businesslens.md`.
- Overwrite only BusinessLens-owned artifacts. An unmarked collision requires
  explicit `--force`.
- `update` changes only installations with a valid BusinessLens marker.
- Provider paths and detection belong in the provider registry, not command
  conditionals.

## Change and release checks

- Run `npm run verify` after any change.
- Inspect `npm pack --dry-run` before a release.
- Roll the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` into a new version heading
  before dispatching a release.
- Validate every skill with the skill-creator `quick_validate.py`.
- Validate the Claude plugin with `claude plugin validate . --strict` when the
  Claude CLI is available.
- Keep `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `package.json` versions in sync.
- Do not publish, tag, or push unless explicitly asked.
