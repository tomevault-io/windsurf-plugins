# AGENTS

Repo-specific instructions for agents working on `scena`.

## Mission

`scena` is a Rust-native Three.js replacement for scene-graph, glTF, model-viewer,
industrial visualization, CAD/viewer, and digital-twin style applications. It is not a
simulation engine, not a robotics engine, not physics, not PLC/domain logic, and not a game
engine.

The canonical charter is `docs/RFC-rust-3d-renderer.md`. Start architectural, API, scope, or
milestone work from that RFC.

## Required Skills

- Use `scena-rfc-governance` when editing the RFC, changing v1.0/v1.x scope, changing
  milestones, or reviewing whether a feature belongs in the renderer.
- Use `scena-renderer-architecture` when implementing or refactoring scene/assets/render
  module ownership, typed handles, prepare/render lifecycle, resource lifetime, or public
  API.
- Use `scena-renderer-quality` when adding tests, visual proof, browser/WASM checks,
  headless screenshots, leak tests, allocation tests, or capability gates.
- Use `scena-gltf-assets` when touching glTF/GLB loading, extensions, animation, skinning,
  morph targets, anchors, units, or hot reload.
- Use `scena-doctor` when adding, changing, or reviewing doctor checks, validation gates,
  silent-failure prevention, checklist enforcement, or source-derived architecture rules.
- Use `scena-release-hygiene` when preparing user-visible changes for release, changing
  crate metadata, versioning, changelog/release notes, publish readiness, or v1.0 release
  evidence.
- Use `scena-git-github` when working with branches, commits, tags, GitHub issues, pull
  requests, workflow runs, releases, or local-vs-remote state proof.
- Use `scena-remote-builder` when compiling, running cargo tests, running doctor, or
  preparing remote proof from the Hetzner CPU build machine.

## Skill Trigger Guidance

- Scope, milestone, and "should this belong in scena?" questions start with
  `scena-rfc-governance`.
- Implementation work starts with `scena-renderer-architecture`, then adds the narrower
  skill for the touched area: `scena-gltf-assets` for import/animation assets,
  `scena-renderer-quality` for tests/visual/browser/performance proof, and `scena-doctor`
  for enforceable drift checks.
- Any review finding, silent fallback, or repeated mistake must be checked for doctor
  coverage. If it can be detected from source, docs, manifests, or gate artifacts, extend
  `xtask doctor` before considering the finding closed.
- User-visible API, renderer behavior, docs/tutorial, crate metadata, publish readiness,
  or v1.0 release evidence also uses `scena-release-hygiene`.
- Compile, test, clippy, doc, publish dry-run, and doctor proof must use
  `scena-remote-builder` so the heavy Rust work runs on the remote machine.
- Branch, commit, tag, issue, PR, workflow, release, crash-recovery, or local-vs-remote
  proof work also uses `scena-git-github`.
- When multiple skills apply, use all relevant skills in this order: RFC scope, renderer
  architecture, area-specific implementation, quality proof, doctor enforcement, release
  hygiene, remote builder proof, then Git/GitHub follow-through.

## Architecture Rules

- Keep renderer logic out of `platform`; platform modules are adapters only.
- Keep asset fetching/parsing/cache ownership in `assets`; `Renderer` must not fetch assets.
- Keep scene graph state in `scene`; `Renderer` consumes prepared scene/resource state.
- Do not add simulation, robotics, PLC, process, or physics concepts to `scena`.
- Prefer typed handles and structured errors over stringly contracts or silent fallbacks.
- Do not hide async fetches, shader compilation, or GPU upload inside `render()`.
- Follow SOLID/KISS: every public feature has one owner module, no catch-all manager/engine
  types, no global singleton state, and no abstraction added only for hypothetical future
  flexibility.

## Unit Test First Rule

- For production implementation code, add or update the narrowest unit or integration test
  that captures the expected contract before changing the implementation.
- Run the focused test and confirm it fails for the expected reason on the remote builder
  before patching production code.
- Implement the smallest code change that makes the focused test pass, then run the broader
  required gates.
- If a change cannot be meaningfully unit-tested first, record why in the checklist or final
  handoff and add the closest deterministic proof before implementation.
- Do not mark a checklist implementation item complete without naming the test-first proof
  or the documented exception.

## Test Flow Discipline

Do not turn every edit into a full release-gate loop. Use an evidence ladder and stop
expanding when the current proof is sufficient for the risk:

1. Reproduce or pin the exact failure first. Prefer one focused test, one CLI proof, one
   browser probe, or one rendered-output comparison that would fail on the old behavior.
2. Patch the smallest surface that can make that proof pass.
3. Rerun the same focused proof. If it still fails, keep iterating there; do not broaden to
   unrelated suites.
4. Add scoped gates only for the touched surface: formatting after Rust edits, the affected
   integration test after CLI/schema edits, `doctor --full` after doctor/checklist/schema
