# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Build
cargo build
cargo build --release

# Build the React UI assets required by Rust include_str! routes
corepack enable
yarn --cwd src/design install --frozen-lockfile
yarn --cwd src/design build

# Run all Rust tests with release warning policy
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo test

# Run a single test by name
cargo test <test_name>

# Run tests in a specific module
cargo test middleware::plugins::jwt_inspector

# Lint
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run the proxy. A clean checkout will build src/design/dist automatically
# if Node/Yarn are available; explicit UI build is still faster in CI.
cargo run
```

> **Critical:** run the full test suite before release, not only `cargo test --lib`. Browser tests live under `tests/browser` and use Playwright.

## Architecture

### Three-layer separation

1. **Transport** (`main.rs`, `core/engine.rs`) — hyper accept loop, CONNECT handling, MITM TLS, reqwest forwarding  
2. **Traffic manipulation** (`middleware/`) — inspect, rewrite, throttle, pause, mock  
3. **Control plane** (`management.rs`, `api/`, `storage.rs`) — axum REST API, web UI, JSON persistence

### Request lifecycle

```
hyper accept loop (main.rs)
  ├─ CONNECT request → mitm_intercept() or TCP tunnel (copy_bidirectional)
  └─ all other requests → proxy_dispatch_layer (axum middleware)
       ├─ Host == localhost → axum router (management UI / API)
       └─ else → ProxyEngine::handle_request()
            1. Buffer body (up to max_body_bytes)
            2. Run Request Middleware Chain (insertion order)
            3. Strip internal headers, resolve target URL
            4. Forward via reqwest
            5. Run Response Middleware Chain (reverse order)
            6. Return to client
```

### Middleware system

New traffic features = implement `Middleware` trait. No engine changes needed.

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Middleware: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    async fn on_request(&self, ctx: &mut RequestContext) -> MiddlewareAction;
    async fn on_response(&self, ctx: &mut ResponseContext) -> MiddlewareAction;
}
// MiddlewareAction: Continue | StopAndReturn | Pause
```

`StopAndReturn` returns 403 by default. To return a custom response (mock, Lua abort), embed a JSON payload in `ctx.headers["x-oproxy-mock-response"]` before returning `StopAndReturn`. The engine reads and serves it.

**Middleware chain insertion order** (`runtime/state.rs`):
1. AccessControl (block/allow rules)
2. CaptureFilter (skip recording for filtered hosts)
3. DnsOverride (rewrite upstream host)
4. MapRemote (routing table)
5. Throttling (latency/bandwidth)
6. Rewrite (request/response mutations)
7. Breakpoint (pause on match)
8. JwtInspector / GraphQLInspector / GrpcInspector (payload inspection)
9. Inspection (record session)
10. MapLocal (serve local files) ← short-circuits to file instead of forwarding
11. Mock (return canned responses)
12. Lua (custom request/response logic)
13. Inspection response-pass (record response)

Plugins running before step 9 record the original request. Steps 10–12 can short-circuit with `StopAndReturn`, preventing upstream forwarding.

### Internal middleware ↔ engine side-channel

Middleware plugins exchange data with each other and the engine through **typed,
in-memory fields** on `RequestContext` / `ResponseContext` (all `#[serde(skip)]`, so
they never serialise into recordings/exports and can never leak to the upstream
server). This replaces the former `x-oproxy-*` pseudo-header protocol — there is no
JSON-in-header encoding, no base64 round-trip for binary mock bodies, and a client
can no longer spoof these by sending matching headers (the engine defensively strips
any client-supplied `x-oproxy-*` request header before forwarding).

| Field | Set by | Read by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RequestContext.skip_recording: bool` | CaptureFilterMiddleware | InspectionMiddleware | Skip session recording for filtered hosts |
| `RequestContext.session_id: Option<String>` | InspectionMiddleware | engine.rs | Correlate response to exact request session |
| `RequestContext.destination: Option<String>` | RoutingMiddleware / DnsOverride / MITM | engine.rs | Override upstream target URL |
| `RequestContext.inspector: InspectorData` | JWT / GraphQL / gRPC inspectors | InspectionMiddleware | Parsed inspector data → `Exchange.inspector_data` |
| `RequestContext.mock_response: Option<InterceptedResponse>` | Mock / Rewrite / Lua abort / Breakpoint timeout | engine.rs on StopAndReturn | Short-circuit response returned instead of forwarding |

`InterceptedResponse { status: u16, headers, body: Bytes, tags: Vec<String> }` carries
the body as raw `Bytes`, so binary mock payloads survive without base64. The MITM TLS
layer passes its target via `engine.handle_request_with_destination(req, dest)` rather
than a header. `ResponseContext.tags: Vec<String>` carries session tags (e.g. `"mock"`)
to attach when the exchange is recorded.

### Binary body forwarding
