# Drizzle ORM Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices for managing database schemas and migrations using Drizzle ORM within the our project's server application.

## Workflow: TypeScript-First Schema Management

We adopt a **TypeScript-first** approach for managing the database schema. This means:

1.  **Source of Truth:** The TypeScript schema definition files located in `server/src/db/schema/` are the definitive source of truth for the database structure.
2.  **Schema Changes:** All changes to the database structure (adding tables, columns, constraints, etc.) MUST be made by modifying these TypeScript files first.
3.  **Generating Migrations:** After modifying the TypeScript schema, the `drizzle-kit generate` command is used to automatically create corresponding SQL migration files (`*.sql`).
4.  **Applying Migrations:** The generated SQL migrations are then applied to the database (both local development and production environments) using the standard Supabase migration workflow (e.g., `supabase db push` locally, CI/CD deployment).

**Rationale:**

- **Type Safety:** Leverages TypeScript's full potential for defining and interacting with the database schema.
- **Consistency:** Ensures the database schema always matches the application's understanding (defined in TypeScript).
- **Maintainability:** Changes are tracked and managed within the codebase alongside application logic.
- **Avoids `pull` Limitations:** Sidesteps potential issues with `drizzle-kit pull` overwriting manual schema adjustments or struggling with split file structures.

## Directory Structure (`server/src/db/schema/`)

- **Individual Table Files:** Each database table should have its own schema definition file (e.g., `users.schema.ts`, `pets.schema.ts`). This prevents circular dependencies and improves organization.
- **Shared Definitions:** Common elements like PostgreSQL enums should be defined in a dedicated shared file (e.g., `shared.schema.ts`) and imported where needed.
- **Relations File:** Database relationships should be defined separately, typically in `relations.ts`, importing the necessary table schemas.

## Process for Schema Changes

1.  **Modify TypeScript Schema:** Make the desired changes directly in the relevant `*.schema.ts` file(s) within `server/src/db/schema/`.
2.  **Generate SQL Migration:** Run the following command from the `server/` directory:

    ```bash
    npx drizzle-kit generate
    ```

    > **Note:** In the SAT Monsters project, the preferred way to run this command and handle the generated output is by using the root-level script: `pnpm run db:generate-migration`. This script automatically runs `drizzle-kit generate` and then moves/renames the output file to the correct `supabase/migrations/` directory with the proper naming convention.
    > If you run `npx drizzle-kit generate` manually within the `server/` directory, you **must** remember to manually move the generated `.sql` file from `server/drizzle/migrations/` to `server/supabase/migrations/` and rename it according to the project's timestamp convention (e.g., `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_description.sql`) before it can be used by the Supabase CLI.

    This command reads the changes in your `.ts` files, compares them to the previous schema state (using snapshots typically stored in the migration output directory), and generates a new `.sql` file in the directory specified by the `out` property in `drizzle.config.ts` (e.g., `./drizzle/migrations/`).

3.  **Review SQL Migration:** Inspect the generated `.sql` file to ensure it accurately reflects the intended changes.
4.  **Apply Migration:**
    - **Local:** Use Supabase CLI: `supabase db push` (if applicable for local dev) or apply manually.
    - **Production:** Integrate the new SQL migration file into your deployment process (e.g., Supabase migration CI/CD).
5.  **Commit Changes:** Commit the modified `*.schema.ts` files AND the newly generated `.sql` migration file.

## `drizzle.config.ts` Setup

The `server/drizzle.config.ts` file should be configured to support this workflow:

```typescript
import type { Config } from "drizzle-kit";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config({ path: ".env" });

if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error("DATABASE_URL environment variable is not set");
}

export default {
  // Point schema to the DIRECTORY containing all individual *.schema.ts files
  schema: "./src/db/schema/",
  // Point out to the directory where SQL migrations should be GENERATED
  out: "./drizzle/migrations", // Or './prisma/migrations' if preferred, but './drizzle/' is conventional
  dialect: "postgresql",
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
  verbose: true,
  strict: true,
} satisfies Config;
```

By following this TypeScript-first approach, we ensure a robust, type-safe, and maintainable system for evolving our database schema.

### Migration File Handling

1.  **Generation**: When you run `(cd server && npx drizzle-kit generate)`, Drizzle Kit creates SQL migration files in `server/drizzle/migrations/` based on changes in your schema (`server/src/db/schema/*`).
