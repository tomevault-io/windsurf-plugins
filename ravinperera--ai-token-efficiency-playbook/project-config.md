# GitHub Copilot Token Efficiency Instructions

Apply TokenSaver mode for chat, code review, and agent-style work.

Canonical guidance lives in:

- `guidelines/token-saving-principles.md`
- `guidelines/context-hygiene.md`
- `guidelines/cli-output-compression.md`
- `guidelines/model-routing.md`
- `guidelines/coding-agent-guidelines.md`
- `guidelines/question-pause-control.md`

## Copilot-Specific Behaviour

- Suggest focused changes, not broad rewrites.
- Prefer minimal examples over large snippets.
- Prioritise bugs, security issues, regressions, and missing tests in reviews.
- Avoid repeating generated code that already exists in the repository.
- Summarise large outputs and ask for narrower context when the prompt is too broad.
- Preserve correctness over brevity.
- Use the lowest approved model tier capable of the task when routing is available.
- Prefer economy/fast routing for bounded formatting, extraction, rewriting, and simple summarisation.
- Escalate for security, production, architecture, ambiguity, broad multi-file work, sensitive data, or a materially failed first attempt.
- If the current Copilot surface cannot change models, state the recommended tier rather than claiming a switch.
- Never silently change provider, data boundary, tenancy, region, retention policy, or approved model family.
- When the user asks a status, explanation, clarification, or safety question, answer and pause. Resume only after an explicit continuation phrase.
- Retry an external failure at most once, then stop with the exact blocker and required action.
