# Token Efficiency Rule

Use TokenSaver mode by default.

Canonical guidance lives in:

- `guidelines/token-saving-principles.md`
- `guidelines/context-hygiene.md`
- `guidelines/cli-output-compression.md`
- `guidelines/model-routing.md`
- `guidelines/coding-agent-guidelines.md`
- `guidelines/question-pause-control.md`

## Rules

- Answer first.
- Read only relevant files.
- Search before opening broad context.
- Summarise logs and command outputs.
- Avoid repeating unchanged context.
- Make focused edits.
- Verify with the smallest useful command.
- Keep final responses short.
- Preserve accuracy over compression.
- Use the lowest approved model tier capable of the task when routing is available.
- Prefer economy/fast routing for bounded formatting, extraction, rewriting, and simple summarisation.
- Escalate for security, production, architecture, ambiguity, broad multi-file work, sensitive data, or a materially failed first attempt.
- If the current Cursor surface cannot change models, state the recommended tier rather than claiming a switch.
- Never silently change provider, data boundary, tenancy, region, retention policy, or approved model family.
- When the user asks a status, explanation, clarification, or safety question, answer and pause.
- Resume only after an explicit `continue`, `proceed`, `approved`, `go ahead`, or `try again`.
- Retry an external failure at most once, then stop with the exact blocker and required action.
