# claude-plugins

The marketplace repo for my plugins. One plugin per folder at the repo **root**, listed once in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. There is no `plugins/` directory, and a path that assumes one 404s silently: readable's CDN line carried `@main/plugins/readable/assets/rc.css` for a year and only ever showed up as an unstyled card.

## One source, always the remote

Every machine and every Claude surface installs these plugins from the remote marketplace, `https://github.com/smk-labs/claude-plugins.git`. A second copy anywhere means two versions, and the stale one wins half the time.

So never leave any of these behind:

- a skill copied into `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` or a command into `~/.claude/commands/<name>.md` when a plugin here already ships it
- a marketplace registered with `source: directory` pointing at this checkout
- `claude plugin install` from a local path
- a dev override in the Claude desktop config (for readable, an `mcpServers.readable-card` entry whose path points into this checkout instead of `~/.claude/plugins/data/readable/server/server.js`)

A plugin here MAY register itself with the desktop app on first session, because installing a plugin should be the whole setup. readable does. But an auto-write earns that only by satisfying all four of these, and readable's `hooks/connect.sh` is the worked example plus the tests:

- **every profile, not one.** A hook that knows a single config path leaves the other profiles diverged, which is what drives people to hand-copy whole configs between profiles and spread live API tokens doing it.
- **one backup per config, ever.** Not one per write, or a config full of tokens accumulates copies of itself.
- **say it once.** The write is useless until the app restarts, so a silent write leaves a user with no feature and no explanation.
- **an opt-out that holds.** Removal must survive the next session, or removal is not a thing the user can do.

Plus the precondition that makes it safe at all: being registered must not imply being able to act. readable's server refuses to offer its card tool to a host that cannot render one, so registering it in a profile that cannot use it costs nothing.

One implementation, please. 6.0.0 briefly split this across two hooks with a copy of the file list in each, which is exactly how the two drift apart.

## Test from the checkout, then clean up

Run a plugin's own tests in place, for example `node readable/server/test.js`. For a visual check, render a scratch HTML file somewhere outside the repo and open it. If a check needed a local install or a dev override, delete it in the same session that created it. Nothing test-related stays on the machine, and nothing test-related gets committed.

## Shipping is a push

1. Bump the version in `<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
2. Bump the same version in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. The two must match; a stale listing is why an update silently never arrives.
3. Commit and push to `origin/main`.

Consumers then pick it up on their own: the CLI on `claude plugin update <name>@smk`, the desktop app on its next marketplace refresh. Never hand-copy a build to a machine to make it arrive sooner.

## Before you commit

The repo is often open in more than one session. Run `git status` first, and if files you did not touch are already modified, commit only your own paths and leave the rest. Never sweep another session's work in progress into your commit or push it.
