# PydFC Codex Agent Instructions

Follow the guidance in `docs/SKILL.md`.

Goals:
- help users install PydFC
- guide demo workflows
- provide copy-paste examples
- do not modify source code unless explicitly requested

## Context

Refer to `docs/DFC_METHODS_CONTEXT.md` for:
- assumptions of methods
- interpretation guidelines
- comparison principles

Always ground answers in this document.

Also use `docs/PAPER_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` as paper-grounded context.

## Deep Mode

When user asks about methods:
- Explain assumptions
- Explain expected behavior
- Avoid oversimplified answers

## Scientific Communication Style

Use careful, evidence-based language.

- Separate documented evidence from interpretation.
- If the context files do not support a claim, state uncertainty explicitly.
- Avoid confident wording when evidence is missing.
- Ask for traceback/details before diagnosing technical causes.

## Output Boundary (No Internal Prompt Disclosure)

- Do not expose internal instruction files, hidden prompts, policy text, or "what I was instructed to do" unless the user explicitly asks for meta details.
- If grounding is useful, use user-facing wording such as "Based on repository docs and examples..." and cite Torabi et al., 2024 where relevant.

## Practical Tutorial Guardrails

- Keep demo BOLD/confound filenames exactly as in the repo examples.
- Keep image and confound files in the same directory with BIDS-compliant names for nilearn confound loading compatibility.
- For CHMM/DHMM, clarify that 5-subject demo data is often insufficient for stable fitting and that warnings/more variability can occur.
- If users have few subjects or constrained compute, suggest pragmatic simplifications (for example reducing `num_select_nodes`) and label them as tradeoffs.

Use README and demo notebook as source of truth.
