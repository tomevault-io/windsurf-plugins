# open-design-system-bench — agent instructions

You are working on **open-design-system-bench**: a benchmark that answers "how AI-ready is your design
system?" by running coding agents against a real component library and grading the output, plus a
static `audit` that scores AI-readiness in seconds with no API key. This file is the working
context: what exists, how to work on it, and the decisions not to relitigate. The plan, the
phase status, and the list of next tasks live in `ROADMAP.md`, which is the authoritative
source and is not part of the shipped repo.

## Distribution

- **GitHub-first**: users clone, `npm install`, and run `npx tsx src/cli.ts ...`.
  There is no npm package and no build step. `package.json` has `private: true` on purpose —
  do not publish, do not add a `bin`, do not add a build pipeline.
- Nothing in this repo is specific to one design system. Every check, fixture, grader, and
  default resolves from the user's own `systems.config.json`. If you find yourself hardcoding a
  component name, package name, or provider id, make it a config field instead.

## What exists and works (verified 2026-08-25, 118/118 tests)

- **Fully system-agnostic.** Systems are arbitrary string ids declared in
  `systems.config.json` (`{ "systems": { "<id>": SystemConfig } }`). The root config ships a
  `my-system` placeholder that `init` fills in. A config may declare `"dataDir"` to ship its own
  committed catalog/token snapshots. Global CLI options:
  `--config <path>` and `--tasks-dir <path>`.
- **The `audit` command.** Seven static Tier-0 checks (enablement surface, catalog
  quality, export hygiene, vocabulary convention-distance, token machine-readability,
  deprecation legibility, docs greppability) in `src/audit/checks/`, assembled into the
  AI-Readiness Score (`src/audit/score.ts`: Surface + Lift/Ceiling/Engagement/
  Vocabulary-behavioral, the behavioral four computed only when `--run <dir>` provides a
  results.json). `src/audit/convention-lexicon.json` is an **empirical data artifact**: names AI
  models invented across 898 graded generations (6 model configs, 2 production design systems).
  Do not edit its data by hand; extend it only with new mined evidence.
- **`init`, npm-consume fixtures, and `leaderboard`.** The `init` wizard
  (`src/init/wizard.ts`) works interactively and non-interactively, wired as the `init` CLI
  command. `consume: 'npm'` fixture mode uses the generic template in `fixtures/npm-app/`, with
  prepared installs landing in gitignored `fixtures/.prepared/`; it is proven end-to-end against
  `@radix-ui/react-slot`. The `leaderboard` command (`src/report/leaderboard.ts`) merges
  `audit --json` files into a self-contained ranking page.
- **The extractor handles all three real-world barrel shapes.** `export * from './dir'`, named
  value re-exports (`export { X } from './dir'`), and bare .tsx file modules carrying JSX are all
  covered by the docgen extractor and the export-hygiene check. Directories named `internal` or
  `private` count as deliberate encapsulation, not export-hygiene failures.
- **Benchmark core** (inherited, all working): task suite → fixture workspace (git-diff based) →
  agent generation → six graded dimensions (imports, apiFidelity, tokenDiscipline, a11yStatic,
  compile, judgment) → composite score + worst-case gate → self-contained report.html →
  `compare` and `ci` with frozen baselines. Profiles smoke/small/medium/full. Pause/resume
  (`--resume`, `--retry-errored`, `--wait`) with usage-limit detection and incremental
  persistence. Multi-provider: agentic generation via the `claude` CLI (BYO `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  or gateway via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`), single-shot generation via any OpenAI-compatible or
  Anthropic-compatible endpoint (`providers` map in `bench.config.json`, qualified model strings
  like `--models "openai:gpt-5.2"`), judge on either path. `.env` is auto-loaded (gitignored;
  `.env.example` documents the variables).

## Conventions (follow these)

- ESM TypeScript, strict, run via `tsx`. Local imports use **explicit `.ts` extensions**.
- No new runtime dependencies without a strong reason — the provider clients are plain `fetch`
  by design; the graders use @babel/parser; that is the spirit.
- Tests are offline: node:test via `tsx --test`, mock HTTP servers on 127.0.0.1, synthetic
  configs in temp dirs. **Never call the live `claude` CLI or any provider in tests.**
- npm quirk: if `npm install` hits a cache permission error, add
  `--cache .npm-cache --no-fund --no-audit` (dir is gitignored).
- Verification loop after any change:
  `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` and
  `node_modules/.bin/tsx --test src/**/*.test.ts` (104 tests green as of this writing), plus
  `npx tsx src/cli.ts validate-tasks` and, when audit code changed,
  `npx tsx src/cli.ts audit` against a configured system.
- Benchmark runs (`run`, `judge`, doctor's live probe) cost real LLM money — never start one
  without the operator asking.
- Writing style for docs/reports: no em dashes, straight quotes, sentence-case headings.
- The a11yStatic grader's accessible-name vocabulary is configurable via `SystemConfig.a11y`,
