# OOP Architect

A skill for designing, documenting, and tracking object-oriented software architecture using Mermaid UML diagrams inside CLAUDE.md.

## Core Philosophy

This skill exists because vibe coding sessions get interrupted. When you return after hours or days, CLAUDE.md with live-updated UML lets you instantly see: what's built, what's not, how things connect, and what constraints exist.

The architecture should be **language-agnostic in principle but language-aware in practice** — the same OOP thinking applies everywhere, but UML adapts to each language's idioms.

---

## Step 0 — Before Anything: Two Checks

### Check A: Is OOP appropriate?

If the project is a single-file script, a one-off data transformation, a purely functional pipeline, or has no shared state between components — OOP adds complexity without value. In that case, tell the user directly and suggest a simpler approach. Do not force a class hierarchy.

### Check B: Detect the mode

Assess the situation, then read the corresponding reference:

| CLAUDE.md exists? | Code exists? | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| No | No | **Phase 1** — Read `references/new-project.md` |
| No | Yes | **Phase 3** — Read `references/generate-from-code.md` |
| Yes | Yes, user wants to add a feature | **Phase 4** — Read `references/extend-design.md` |
| Yes | Yes, code has changed | **Phase 2** — Read `references/resync.md` |

**Phase 2 vs Phase 4 disambiguation** — when CLAUDE.md exists and both could apply, use these signals:

- User describes something new to build ("add X", "design Y", "I want to implement Z") → **Phase 4**
- User mentions drift, scanning, or syncing ("resync", "update CLAUDE.md", "scan the project", "things have changed") → **Phase 2**
- User says something ambiguous ("let's continue", "keep going", "what's next") → **ask**: "Do you want to design a new feature, or sync the architecture with the current state of the code?"

### Check C: Load language reference

Detect the primary language from file extensions, imports, or user statement. Read the matching file before generating any UML. If the language is not listed, read `references/langs/generic.md`.

| Language | Reference |
|---|---|
| Python | `references/langs/python.md` |
| Java / C# / Kotlin | `references/langs/java-csharp-kotlin.md` |
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `references/langs/typescript-javascript.md` |
| Go | `references/langs/go.md` |
| Rust | `references/langs/rust.md` |
| C++ | `references/langs/cpp.md` |
| Swift | `references/langs/swift.md` |
| Ruby | `references/langs/ruby.md` |
| PHP | `references/langs/php.md` |
| Other | `references/langs/generic.md` |

For multi-language projects, read all relevant language files and apply principle 8 (separate diagrams per layer).

## Phase 1: Design from Scratch

Read `references/new-project.md`.

## Important Principles

1. **UML is the source of truth for architecture.** Code is the source of truth for implementation. CLAUDE.md bridges them.
2. **Keep diagrams readable.** More than 15–20 classes in one diagram → split by module. Name each section after its module (`### Class Diagram — Auth`, `### Class Diagram — Payment`). Cross-module relationships go in the component diagram, not across split class diagrams.
3. **Special notes are precious.** They capture constraints that can't be derived from code.
4. **Status tracking enables resume.** ✅/🔶/🔲 lets anyone instantly see what's done, what's next.
5. **Extensibility is designed, not accidental.** Abstract base methods should be needed by every subclass — if only some subclasses need it, it belongs in a mixin or separate interface.
6. **CLAUDE.md is self-maintaining.** The generated file contains its own update rules — this skill only runs for initial planning and full resyncs.
7. **Test code stays out of UML.** Mock classes, fakes, and test fixtures don't belong in architecture diagrams. Exception: a test double that ships as part of the production library (e.g., an in-memory adapter intended for downstream users) should be included.
8. **Multi-language projects: separate diagrams per layer.** For a project with e.g. a Python backend and TypeScript frontend, create one class diagram per language layer and label each section clearly. Cross-language boundaries (REST API, message queue) go in the component diagram, not in class relationships. Shared data contracts (request/response schemas) go in a dedicated section using the most expressive type system available.
