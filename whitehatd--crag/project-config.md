# CLAUDE.md — @whitehatd/crag

> Generated from governance.md by [crag](https://crag.sh). Regenerate: `crag compile --target claude`

Make every AI agent obey your codebase. One governance.md → compiled to CI, hooks, and every agent. No drift.

**Stack:** node
**Runtimes:** node

## Quality Gates

Run these in order before committing. Stop on first MANDATORY failure:

- `node test/all.js`
- `node --check bin/crag.js`
- `node bin/crag.js help > /dev/null`
- `node bin/crag.js version`
- `node bin/crag.js analyze --dry-run > /dev/null`
- `node bin/crag.js upgrade --check > /dev/null`
- `node bin/crag.js workspace --json > /dev/null`
- `node bin/crag.js analyze > /dev/null`

## Rules

1. Read `governance.md` at the start of every session — it is the single source of truth.
2. Run all mandatory quality gates before committing.
3. If a gate fails, attempt an automatic fix (lint/format) with bounded retry (max 2 attempts). If it still fails, escalate to the user.
4. Never modify files outside this repository.
5. Never run destructive system commands (`rm -rf /`, `DROP TABLE`, force-push to main).
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Commit trailer: `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`

## Security

- No hardcoded secrets — grep for sk_live, AKIA, password= before commit

## Tool Context

This project uses **crag** (https://crag.sh) as its governance engine. The `governance.md` file is the authoritative source. Run `crag audit` to detect drift and `crag compile --target all` to recompile all targets.
