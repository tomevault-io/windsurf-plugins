# Project conventions: cozystack/ansible-cozystack

This file captures project-specific working conventions that aren't obvious
from the code.

## Release strategy

- Collection version is **inherited from `cozystack/cozystack`** — it
  tracks the upstream Cozystack chart version (the value in
  `roles/cozystack/defaults/main.yml:cozystack_chart_version`).
- Do **NOT** bump the collection version just because a PR adds features
  or fixes bugs. The collection version moves only when upstream
  `cozystack/cozystack` releases a new chart version.
- Between upstream releases, changes accumulate on `main`. Users pin to
  git tags for stable installs; they reference `main` if they want the
  current feature set.
- Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggers on
  `galaxy.yml` changes and creates a tag named `v<version>`. Never edit
  `galaxy.yml` version to force a release — the upstream Cozystack version
  is the trigger.
- Git tags are **`v`-prefixed** (`v1.2.2`), but `galaxy.yml` and
  `requirements.yml` version fields **omit the `v`** for Ansible Galaxy.
  Example requirements files that use `type: git` reference tags and must
  include the `v` prefix.

## CHANGELOG discipline

- `CHANGELOG.rst` uses per-version sections in reverse chronological order.
- For changes on `main` without a version bump, use an `Unreleased`
  section at the top. Rename it to the new version when upstream bumps
  and the release workflow fires.
- Never attribute new changes to an already-tagged version — releases are
  immutable.

## Review workflow for pull requests

Every PR must receive at least two independent review passes before
merging — one from a second LLM (run in parallel, in the background, so
it does not block the main review) and one from a branch-diff-focused
reviewer. Iterate on any blocking findings until both pass. False
positives must be explicitly justified before dismissing.

Only then enable auto-merge:

```bash
gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch
```

## Planning discipline

When the user invokes plan mode (or the task is non-trivial):

- Research must be **exhaustive, not summary-level**. For anything touching
  OS packages, kernel modules, or upstream components:
  - Verify each package name against the **latest LTS** repos (Ubuntu
    22.04/24.04, RHEL 9, openSUSE Leap 15.6).
  - Follow the dependency chain: e.g., LINSTOR needs DRBD, DRBD needs
    headers, Piraeus compiles DRBD at runtime, multipathd grabs DRBD
    devices, etc.
  - Cover every Cozystack subsystem (storage, networking, virtualization,
    observability) even if the immediate issue touches only one.
- Produce per-OS tables when cross-distro work is involved.
- Cite upstream documentation URLs in research output.

Shallow "looks right" research will be rejected in plan review.

## Ansible collection conventions

- Node-side work lives in `examples/*/prepare-*.yml`, not in the role.
  The role handles only the Cozystack chart and Platform Package install.
- Kernel modules on nodes:
  - Drop a file in `/etc/modules-load.d/cozystack*.conf` for persistence.
  - `community.general.modprobe` for immediate load.
  - Use `failed_when: false` only when the failure is benign (module
    built into kernel, only one of two vendor-specific modules applies);
    document the reason inline.
- Kernel headers: Piraeus builds DRBD against the running kernel, not
  the staged one, so pin to the running kernel when the distro allows.
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `linux-headers-{{ ansible_kernel }}` works.
  - RHEL: `kernel-devel-{{ ansible_kernel }}` works.
  - openSUSE/SLE: zypper rejects `kernel-default-devel-{{ ansible_kernel }}`
    because SUSE package names use a different NVR format than `uname -r`.
    Use the plain `kernel-default-devel` metapackage — zypper resolves
    it to the version matching the installed kernel. Note: if a kernel
    update is staged but not yet booted, this pulls headers for the
    newer installed kernel, not the running one; the user should reboot
    before running the playbook in that case.
- External repos (OpenZFS release RPM, OBS `filesystems`):
  - Import the GPG key explicitly; **never** `disable_gpg_check: true`.
  - OBS path segments are canonical distro names (e.g.
    `openSUSE_Leap_15.6`, `SLE_15_SP6`), not bare version numbers.

## What NOT to install on hosts

KubeVirt, Kube-OVN, and Piraeus all bundle their userspace components in
their own pods. Do **not** install on the host:

- `qemu-kvm`, `libvirt*` — KubeVirt bundles these.
- `openvswitch-switch` / `openvswitch` userspace — Kube-OVN bundles OVS.
- `drbd-utils`, `drbd-dkms`, `kmod-drbd*` — Piraeus init-container
  compiles DRBD 9.x from source at runtime (kernel headers are enough).

The host only needs the kernel modules and, for KVM, a working `/dev/kvm`.

## Critical silent-failure traps

- **Multipath DRBD blacklist**: without
  `/etc/multipath/conf.d/cozystack-drbd-blacklist.conf` blocking
  `^drbd[0-9]+`, `multipathd` grabs DRBD devices and LINSTOR volumes
  become inaccessible after reboot. Always apply.
- **`vhost_net` not loaded by default**: KubeVirt VMIs stay Pending until
  it's present.
- **`br_netfilter` missing**: `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-*` sysctls fail
  with "No such file or directory". Load the module before applying the
  sysctl.
