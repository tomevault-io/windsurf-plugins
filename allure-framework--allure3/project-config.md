# Project Guide

Use [Allure Agent Mode](docs/allure-agent-mode.md) for all test-related work in this repository.

- Read `docs/allure-agent-mode.md` before designing, writing, reviewing, validating, debugging, or enriching tests.
- If a command executes tests and its result will be used for smoke checking, reasoning, review, coverage analysis, debugging, or any user-facing conclusion, run it through `allure agent`. It preserves the original console logs and adds agent-mode artifacts without inheriting the normal report or export plugins from the project config.
- Use `allure agent` for smoke checks too, even when the change is small or mechanical.
- After changing a package in this repository, treat package builds as part of validation and run the changed package build command before finalizing (for example, `yarn workspace <package-name> build`), because type-level regressions can break builds.
- When multiple packages are affected, build them in dependency-graph order so upstream package changes are validated before dependent packages.
- Only skip agent mode when it is impossible or when you are debugging agent mode itself.
- If agent-mode output is missing or incomplete, debug that first rather than silently falling back to console-only review.
- Use Allure agent-mode when adding tests for features or fixes so expectations, evidence quality, and scope review are part of the loop.
- Keep any non-testing project guidance here short; the detailed Allure workflow belongs in the linked guide.
