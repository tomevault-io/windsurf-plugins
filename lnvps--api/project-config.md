# AGENTS.md - Coding Agent Guidelines for LNVPS

This file is an index. Load only the specific doc(s) relevant to your task to minimize context usage.

**Always load [docs/agents-common/common.md](docs/agents-common/common.md) first** — it contains essential guidelines for task sizing, git commits, and git push that apply to all tasks.

**Git push** — Always push using the HTTPS URL directly: `git push https://github.com/LNVPS/api.git`

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [work/agent-rules-compliance.md](work/agent-rules-compliance.md) | Bringing codebase into full compliance with all agent rules |

## Pull Request Procedure

When creating a PR that closes a GitHub issue:

1. **Label the issue** — Before opening the PR, apply appropriate labels to the linked issue using `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "<label>"`. Choose from existing repo labels; create a new one with `gh label create` only if no existing label fits. Typical labels:
   - `bug` — something is broken
   - `enhancement` — new feature or improvement
   - `host:proxmox` / `host:libvirt` — host-specific changes
   - `api` — user-facing or admin API changes
   - `database` — migration or schema changes
   - `payments` — payment/invoice logic
   - `refactor` — internal restructuring without behaviour change
   - `documentation` — docs-only change
2. **Open the PR** — Reference the issue in the PR body (`Fixes #N`).

## Release Procedure

When the user asks to create a release:

1. **Update `API_CHANGELOG.md`** — Change `## [Unreleased]` to `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` with the current date
2. **Update `Cargo.toml` versions** — Bump the version in the root `Cargo.toml` under `[workspace.package]` (all crates inherit via `version.workspace = true`)
3. **Bump the `lnvps_fw` version** — `lnvps_fw` is a **separate workspace** (excluded from the root one) with its own `[workspace.package]` version in `lnvps_fw/Cargo.toml`. Bump it to the **same `X.Y.Z`** as the main workspace so the two stay in lockstep. This matters: the firewall daemon's self-upgrade (`lnvps_fw_service/src/upgrade.rs`) compares its compiled `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` against the newest `vX.Y.Z` GitHub release tag — if `lnvps_fw/Cargo.toml` lags behind the tag, every running daemon will report an upgrade is available on startup and every 6h.
4. **Commit the changes** — `git commit -m "chore: release vX.Y.Z"`
5. **Create an annotated tag** — `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`
6. **Push commit and tag** — `git push https://github.com/LNVPS/api.git && git push https://github.com/LNVPS/api.git vX.Y.Z`

### `lnvps_fw` release artifact

The `vX.Y.Z` tag is what drives the firewall release. Pushing it triggers the `.github/workflows/lnvps_fw-deb.yml` workflow, which builds the `lnvps_fw_service` daemon (including the eBPF datapath, via a nightly `rust-src` + `bpf-linker` toolchain) into a Debian package with `cargo deb` and attaches the `.deb` to the GitHub release. Running daemons then discover and install that `.deb` through the self-upgrade endpoint (`GET`/`POST /api/v1/upgrade`). There is **no separate `fw` tag** — the fw workspace shares the single `vX.Y.Z` tag, which is exactly why step 3's version bump must happen before tagging.
