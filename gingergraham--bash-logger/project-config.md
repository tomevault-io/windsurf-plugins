# bash-logger Agent Instructions

This document provides guidance for AI agents contributing to the bash-logger project.
Follow these standards when generating, modifying, or reviewing code.

## Agent Skills

This repository provides skills in `.claude/skills/`. Supporting agents (GitHub Copilot,
Claude Code, and others implementing the Agent Skills open standard) load these automatically.
Each skill contains the authoritative, step-by-step workflow for its domain:

* **[linting-code](.claude/skills/linting-code/SKILL.md)** — run ShellCheck and MarkdownLint,
  interpret failures, fix common issues
* **[running-tests](.claude/skills/running-tests/SKILL.md)** — discover available suites,
  choose targeted vs full runs, read test output
* **[writing-tests](.claude/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md)** — create test suites, write
  correctly isolated test functions, use assertions
* **[writing-commits](.claude/skills/writing-commits/SKILL.md)** — format commit messages and
  PR descriptions with Conventional Commits / semantic-release
* **[pre-pr-checks](.claude/skills/pre-pr-checks/SKILL.md)** — full gate sequence before
  opening a pull request
* **[security-review](.claude/skills/security-review/SKILL.md)** — review changes for input
  sanitization, file system safety, config injection, and other security domains

When a skill covers a task (linting, testing, committing, security review), defer to it for
the detailed procedure. The sections below state the standards; the skills explain the how.

## Linting and Code Quality

All code changes **MUST** pass the linting requirements defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

* **ShellCheck** — all `.sh` files, severity `warning`, `--external-sources`
* **MarkdownLint** — all `.md` files, rules from `.markdownlint.yaml`

See the `linting-code` skill for commands and how to fix common failures.

## Test Suite

* **Tool**: `tests/run_tests.sh`
* **Requirement**: all changes must not break existing tests; new functionality must have tests
* **Contributor guide**: [docs/writing-tests.md](docs/writing-tests.md)

See the `running-tests` and `writing-tests` skills for invocation syntax and test patterns.

## Commit Message Standards

All commits **MUST** follow **Conventional Commits / semantic-release** format to drive
automated versioning and changelog generation:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Common types: `feat` (minor bump), `fix`/`perf`/`refactor` (patch bump), `docs`/`style`/
`test`/`chore`/`ci` (no bump). A `BREAKING CHANGE` footer triggers a major bump.

See the `writing-commits` skill for the full type/scope table, subject rules, footer
conventions, and PR description format.

## Shell Compatibility Guidelines

The project targets Bash but aims for broad compatibility where possible.

**Supported shells** (in order of priority):

1. POSIX shell (`sh`) — most compatible
2. Bash (4.x and 5.x)
3. Zsh
4. Fish
5. Other POSIX-compatible shells

**DO:**

* Use `[[ ]]` in Bash-targeted files (like `logging.sh`); reserve `[ ]` for scripts where
  POSIX portability is explicitly required
* Use `$(...)` instead of backticks (works everywhere)
* Use `.` for POSIX sh; `source` is Bash/Zsh/Ksh-specific (but widely supported)
* Document shell requirements in comments

**DON'T:**

* Use `[[ ]]`, `(( ))`, or `=~` in scripts that must be POSIX-portable
* Use bash arrays or associative arrays unless truly needed
* Rely on bash-specific string manipulation in portable scripts
* Use `<<` heredocs without considering portability

**Bash-specific exception:** when POSIX compatibility is not feasible, default to Bash,
add a comment explaining why, and use ShellCheck suppressions with justification:

```bash
# shellcheck disable=SC3010 -- bash-specific syntax required for performance here
```

The main `logging.sh` uses `#!/usr/bin/env bash` explicitly. Configuration and demo
scripts should maintain broader compatibility.

## Markdown Formatting Standards

All Markdown files must satisfy the rules in `.markdownlint.yaml`:

* **MD004** — unordered list markers: always `*`, never `-`
* **MD007** — list indentation: 2 spaces per level
* **MD013** — line length: maximum 200 characters; code blocks and tables are exempt
* **MD022** — headings: one blank line above and below every heading
* **MD029** — ordered list style: use `1.` for every item, or true sequential numbers
* **MD060** — table column style: `"aligned"` — all column widths must be padded uniformly so
  every pipe is vertically aligned; separator dashes must span the full column width

Rules explicitly disabled (permitted in this project): raw HTML (MD033), duplicate headings
across sections (MD024), emphasis as heading (MD036), language tag on fenced blocks (MD040),
trailing punctuation in headings (MD026), first-line heading (MD041).

## Code Style Standards

* **Indentation**: 4 spaces, no tabs
* **Line length**: under 100 characters where reasonable
* **Variable names**: meaningful and descriptive
* **Comments**: explain complex logic or non-obvious constraints; not needed elsewhere
* **Naming conventions**:
  * Constants: `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
  * Functions: `lowercase_with_underscores`
  * Local variables: `lowercase_with_underscores`
