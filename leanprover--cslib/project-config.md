# Project Instructions

## Repository Overview

**CSLib** is the Lean library for Computer Science (CS), formalising CS theories and tools in the Lean programming language. It provides APIs for formal verification, certified software, and connecting different CS developments.

- **Language:** Lean 4
- **Build System:** Lake
- **Primary Dependency:** Mathlib (leanprover-community/mathlib4)
- **Project Type:** Lean library

## Build & Validation Commands

**Always run commands from the repository root.** The project uses `lake`.

### Essential Commands (in order of typical usage)

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `lake build` | Build the library | After any code change |
| `lake build --wfail --iofail` | Build with CI strictness (fails on warnings) | Before committing |
| `lake test` | Run all tests (builds CslibTests + checks init imports) | After changes to verify correctness |
| `lake lint` | Run environment linters (Batteries/Mathlib) | Before committing |
| `lake exe lint-style` | Run text-based style linters | Before committing |
| `lake exe mk_all --check` | Verify Cslib.lean imports all modules | After adding new files |
| `lake exe mk_all` | Auto-update Cslib.lean imports | After adding new files |

### Full CI Validation Sequence

Run these commands **in order** to replicate CI checks locally:

```bash
lake build --wfail --iofail
lake exe mk_all --check
lake test
lake lint
lake exe lint-style
```

### Additional Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `lake clean` | Remove build outputs (use if build state is corrupted) |
| `lake update` | Update dependencies (rarely needed) |
| `lake exe lint-style --fix` | Auto-fix style errors |
| `lake exe shake Cslib` | Check for minimized imports |

## Critical Requirements

### 1. All Cslib Modules Must Import Cslib.Init
Every file in `Cslib/` must transitively import `Cslib/Init.lean`. This sets up default linters and tactics. The test suite verifies this.

**Exceptions** (documented in `scripts/CheckInitImports.lean`):
- `Cslib.Foundations.Lint.Basic` (circular dependency)
- `Cslib.Init` itself

### 2. New Files Must Be Added to Cslib.lean
When creating a new `.lean` file in `Cslib/`, add its import to `Cslib.lean` by running:
```bash
lake exe mk_all
```

### 3. PR Title Convention
PR titles **must** follow the format: `type(scope): description`

Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `doc`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

Examples:
- `feat(LTS): add weak bisimulation`
- `fix(Lambda): correct substitution lemma`
- `doc: improve README`

### 4. File Headers
Every `.lean` file must have a copyright header:
```lean
/-
Copyright (c) $YEAR $AUTHOR_NAME. All rights reserved.
Released under Apache 2.0 license as described in the file LICENSE.
Authors: $LIST_OF_AUTHORS
-/
```
where $YEAR should be replaced with the current year, $AUTHOR_NAME with the name of the file creator, and $LIST_OF_AUTHORS with the list of authors (this is just the file creator if there are no additional authors).

### 5. Always Read Local README.md Files

Before working on any file or directory, **always read** all `README.md` files in all directories throughout the entire repository.

These files contain essential context that must be understood before making changes.

## Code Style

- Follow everything written in /CONTRIBUTING.md
- Follow the [Mathlib code style](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/style.html)
- Use domain-specific variable names when dealing with APIs that have a clear intention (e.g., `State` for state types, `μ` for transition labels).
- Keep proofs readable; golfing is welcome if proofs remain clear.
- Use existing typeclasses for common concepts (`Congruence`, `Context`, etc.).
- Use the `module` keyword at the start of files with `public import` statements.

## Linter Configuration

Linters are configured in `lakefile.toml`.

## Common Patterns

### Creating a New Module
1. Create file in appropriate `Cslib/` subdirectory
2. Add `import Cslib.Init` (or import a module that imports it)
