# Code comments

## Style

- Explain **why**, not **what**. The code already shows what; comments justify a decision, flag a constraint, or warn about a non-obvious interaction.
- Plain prose, sentence case, periods. No banner art or decorative dashes.
- Reference symbols and paths in backticks (`` `useChat` ``, `lib/db/...`).
- Active voice ("Returns null on..." not "Null is returned on...").
- Reference constants by name; don't restate their value.

## Comment when

A future reader would otherwise have to spelunk to answer "why does it do this?":

- Architectural choices and invariants the type system can't express.
- Workarounds for bugs / browser quirks / library limits — link the issue and note when it can be removed.
- Non-obvious tradeoffs ("we re-render on every keystroke because the sidebar live-mirrors the value").

## Don't comment

- Restating the line below (`// increment the counter`).
- Standard library / framework behavior (`autoFocus = true` doesn't need a paragraph explaining what `autoFocus` does).
- TODOs without an owner or ticket — open an issue instead.

## Length

Inline comments should be **3 lines or fewer**. File headers cap at **4–5 lines**. Go longer only when a reader would genuinely be lost without it; otherwise trim. If a long comment only restates what the code does, delete it.
