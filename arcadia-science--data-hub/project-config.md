## Commits and pull requests

Do **not** put sensitive information from internal environments (production, staging, or a coworker's machine) into commit messages, PR titles/bodies, review comments, or committed files. That includes:

- Credentials and secrets: PATs (`dhub_…`), `AUTH_SECRET`, AWS keys/session tokens, database passwords, webhook secrets
- Pre-signed or authenticated URLs (S3 download links, anything with `X-Amz-Security-Token` / signature query params)
- Identifiers from internal environments: instrument IDs, run IDs, file IDs, and real filenames from those runs
- Raw dumps from internal MCP tools, API responses, or logs that embed the above
- `.env` contents or other gitignored config copied into the diff

Safe to reference: public docs URLs, redacted error messages, and synthetic fixtures. When a PR needs to describe a production incident, summarize the failure mode — don't paste tokens, signed URLs, IDs, or full internal payloads.

## Documentation

User-, operator-, and admin-facing documentation — installing a watcher, setting up an instrument, managing tokens, security/permissions — lives on the docs site at https://datahub.arcadiascience.com/docs, **not in this repository**. Search there first for "how do I use Data Hub" questions; don't rely on training data or guess at UI flows, since the site's `/docs/llms.txt` and `/docs/llms-full.txt` routes (and a `.md` suffix on any page URL) serve clean Markdown that's cheap to fetch.

This repo's `developer-docs/` covers contributing to and self-hosting Data Hub itself: architecture internals, local dev setup (`getting-started.md`, `local-development.md`), conventions, the step-by-step self-hosting guide for the web app and AWS infrastructure (`first-time-deployment.md`) plus CI/ongoing-deploy reference (`ci-and-deployment.md`), and per-package references (`lambda.md`, `watcher.md`, `shared-library.md`). See `developer-docs/README.md` for the full index.

### Watcher CLI catalog (docs site)

The public [Watcher CLI](https://datahub.arcadiascience.com/docs/cli-reference) page renders from a JSON catalog generated from Click in `watcher/src/data_hub_watcher/cli_catalog.py`.

1. Change CLI help or options in `watcher/src/data_hub_watcher/cli.py`.
2. Run `make py-watcher-cli-catalog` (writes a gitignored `watcher/cli-catalog.snapshot.json`).
3. Copy that file to `data-hub-docs/src/lib/cli-catalog.snapshot.json` and commit it in the docs repo.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

Data Hub is a multi-component repo (see `README.md`). The component you can run end-to-end locally with zero external credentials is the **Next.js web app + REST API + PostgreSQL** (`web/`). The `lambda/`, `watcher/`, and `packages/shared/` Python packages are exercised via tests and a local S3 mirror — no real AWS is needed for local work.

Standard commands live in the `Makefile`, `web/package.json`, `developer-docs/getting-started.md`, and `developer-docs/local-development.md`. The notes below are the non-obvious caveats that those docs don't make obvious for a fresh cloud VM (where the update script has already installed deps).

### Starting services (not handled by the update script)

- **PostgreSQL must be started on every fresh VM** — the cluster is installed and the data (roles + databases) persist in the snapshot, but the server process is not running at boot: `sudo pg_ctlcluster 16 main start` (or `sudo service postgresql start`).
- Postgres is reachable at `postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432`. Databases `data-hub-local` (dev) and `data_hub_test` (integration tests) already exist. The integration harness (`web/tests/integration/global-setup.ts`) hardcodes these same credentials and creates `data_hub_test` itself if missing.
- **Web dev server:** `make dev` (Next.js + Turbopack on http://localhost:3000). Sign in at `/login` with the "Sign in (dev)" button using email `alice@example.com` (workspace admin; shared seed password is submitted invisibly).

### Environment file

`web/.env` is gitignored and required for `make dev` / seeding. If it is missing on a fresh VM, recreate it from the "Minimal `.env`" block in `developer-docs/local-development.md` (the key lines are `DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/data-hub-local`, a 32+ char `AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000`, dummy `AWS_*` values, and `LOCAL_S3_MIRROR=../lambda/.local-s3`).

### Node / Python toolchain

- Use **Node 24 (npm 11)** — it is the nvm default and is what CI uses. `npm ci` against the committed `web/package-lock.json` **fails under npm 10** ("Missing: esbuild@… from lock file"), so don't downgrade. A clean login shell already selects Node 24 via nvm.
- Python is managed by `uv` (Python 3.13, pinned in `.python-version`). Run Python tools through `uv run …` (e.g. `uv run pytest`); the Makefile targets already do this.

### Seeding and local file bytes

- `make db-reseed` resets + pushes the Drizzle schema + seeds deterministic data. It prints a personal access token (`dhub_…`) for the dev user — use it for `Authorization: Bearer` API calls.
