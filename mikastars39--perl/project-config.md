> ABOUT THE PROJECT
> By default, the development i.e., this claude code is running on a cpu machine, while the coding is running on a gpu machine
> Therefore, it is natural that you may not find some python packages or environment on your cli
> Also do not run training that needs GPUs.
> You can ask the user to run something on GPU machines.


# PeRL - Parameter-Efficient Reinforcement Learning

A minimal, modular framework for PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) + RL (Reinforcement Learning), and Optimizer design.

## Repository Structure

```
PeRL/
├── modules/          # Core modules (contains submodules + local code)
│   ├── trl/          # Local TRL-based training code (modules/trl/perl/)
│   ├── slime/        # [submodule] SLIME training backend, forked from THUDM/slime
│   ├── Megatron-LM/  # [submodule] Megatron-LM (an individual repo copied from docker image of slime)
│   └── Emerging-Optimizers/  # [submodule] NVIDIA NeMo optimizers
├── recipes/          # Training scripts & configs
│   ├── trl/          # TRL recipes (openr1/, openmath/, accelerate/, a6000/)
│   └── slime/        # SLIME recipes
├── env/              # Environment setup (requirements_hard.txt)

```

## Key Concepts

- **modules/trl/perl/**: Core PeRL implementation on top of TRL. Contains PEFT method integrations (LoRA, DoRA, AdaLoRA, MiSS, PiSSA, VeRA, etc.).
- **recipes/**: Shell scripts for launching training. Organized by backend (trl/slime) and dataset/config (openr1, openmath).
- **Submodules**: `slime`, `Megatron-LM`, `Emerging-Optimizers` are git submodules under `modules/`.

## TODO

IMPORTANT: read the doc/TODO.md for what we will do for this project
