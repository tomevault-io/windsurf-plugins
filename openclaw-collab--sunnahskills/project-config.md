# Code quality & performance routing

- Keep changes surgical and avoid overengineering: apply karpathy-guidelines.
- If code becomes verbose/boilerplate-y: use ai-slop-cleaner to reduce and tighten.
- If refactoring for clarity without behavior change: use code-simplifier (and keep diffs small).
- For React/UI performance concerns: use vercel-react-best-practices.

# Security routing

- If touching auth, cookies/sessions, payments, webhooks, admin endpoints, secrets, or input validation: invoke security-reviewer before shipping/committing.

# Review routing

- After a meaningful milestone: invoke code-reviewer before finishing.
