## Building

For a full build from the repository root:

```sh
cmake -B build .
cmake --build build --parallel 8
./ollama serve
```

For quick Go-only iteration against an existing native payload:

```sh
go build .
go run . serve
```

See `docs/development.md` for prerequisites, platform notes, GPU backends, and
the full development workflow.
