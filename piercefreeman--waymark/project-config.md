## Terminology

- A "node_id" is only true for the ground truth DAG node that come from the workflow definition in the run() workflow. This is converted from Python->IR->DAG. These are the `nodes` that are referenced.
- An "execution_id" comes from the state graph of the program that is currently running. Loops are unrolled in this state, for example. They also maintain the state of the actions that are actually pushed into the cluster like the current attempt number of the actions.

## Code Review

When there are TODOs in the code that indicate issues with the code written (versus areas that we want to implement in the future), you should fix them one by one. You should also generalize the feedback that you receive into advice that applies to our code style guides. For every piece of this feedback, consult the AGENTS.md file. Is the feedback still within the document? If not, add it as a new bullet or nuance a bullet that is already there to be more specific it it overlaps significantly in scope. Feel free to include code examples inline of the good/bad way of how to handle it.

Once you are done fixing the TODO, double check your work. Have we really taken care of the TODO? Remove the comment if so.

Follow this syntax:

<code_feedback>
<rule></rule>
</code_feedback>

## UI Design Conventions

Follow a modern, developer-focused design language. The design prioritizes clarity, information density, and professional polish.

### Theme & Color System

**Dual Theme Support**
- Every component must support both light and dark modes
- Dark mode: Near-black backgrounds (#0a0a0a to #1a1a1a), light text
- Light mode: White/off-white backgrounds, dark text
- Use CSS variables or Tailwind's dark: prefix for all color values

**Semantic Color Palette**
- **Green** (#22c55e / emerald): Success, completed, active states, running processes
- **Blue** (#3b82f6): Primary actions, parent workflows, links, interactive elements
- **Yellow/Amber** (#eab308): Waiting, pending, in-progress states
- **Red** (#ef4444): Errors, failures, destructive actions
- **Gray** (#6b7280): Secondary text, metadata, timestamps, disabled states

### Visual Elements

**Background Treatment**
- Use subtle vertical or grid lines on dark backgrounds for depth and structure
- Lines should be very low contrast (e.g., #1f1f1f on #0a0a0a)
- Diagonal hatching patterns for "idle" or inactive regions

**Cards & Containers**
- Minimize card usage - prefer flat layouts with subtle borders
- When cards are needed: thin 1px borders, no shadows in dark mode
- Light mode cards: subtle shadows allowed, clean white backgrounds
- Border radius: consistent rounded-lg (8px) or rounded-xl (12px)

**Glassmorphism (Floating Elements Only)**
- Apply to modals, dropdowns, popovers, and floating UI
- Use backdrop-blur with semi-transparent backgrounds
- Dark mode: rgba(0,0,0,0.8) with backdrop-blur-lg
- Light mode: rgba(255,255,255,0.9) with backdrop-blur-lg

### Component Patterns

**Status Badges/Pills**
- Rounded-full pill shape with semantic border colors
- Transparent or semi-transparent fill with colored border
- Include status dot indicator when appropriate
- Example: Green border + "Completed" text for success states

**Timeline/Waterfall Visualizations**
- Horizontal bars showing duration and timing
- Color-coded by status (green=success, blue=running, yellow=waiting)
- Show function names and durations inline
- Use grid lines to indicate time intervals

**Code & Technical Text**
- Monospace font (font-mono) for: IDs, function names, code snippets, durations
- Syntax highlighting in code blocks with muted, readable colors
- Inline code: subtle background tint with rounded corners

**Typography Hierarchy**
- Headlines: Bold, larger size, high contrast
- Body text: Regular weight, comfortable reading size
- Metadata: Smaller size, muted gray color
- Use font-medium sparingly for emphasis

### Layout Principles

**Spacing**
- Generous whitespace between sections
- Consistent padding within components (p-4, p-6)
- Use gap utilities for flex/grid layouts

**Information Density**
- Dense data displays (tables, timelines) are acceptable
- Balance density with clear visual hierarchy
- Group related information visually

**Responsive Behavior**
- Mobile-first approach
- Stack horizontal layouts vertically on small screens
- Maintain readability at all breakpoints

### Interaction States

**Hover**
- Subtle background color shift
- Don't rely on hover for essential information

**Focus**
- Clear focus rings for accessibility
- Use ring-2 with brand/accent color

**Active/Selected**
- Distinct visual treatment from hover
- Consider using filled backgrounds instead of just borders

## Coding Conventions

- Never add optional-import fallbacks for core dependencies (e.g., wrapping `pydantic` imports in `try/except`). Import them directly and let the program fail fast if they're missing.
