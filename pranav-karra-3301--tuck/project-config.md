# Workflow Rules

## CI Workflow (ci.yml)

Runs on:
- Push to main
- Pull requests to main

Jobs:
1. **lint** - ESLint + TypeScript checking
2. **test** - Run on Ubuntu + macOS, Node 18/20/22
3. **build** - Build and verify CLI works
4. **security** - Dependency audit

## Release Workflow (release.yml)

Runs on:
- Push to main (when CI passes)
- Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

Jobs:
1. **check** - Verify releasable changes exist
2. **release** - Run semantic-release
3. **build-binaries** - Build for all platforms

## Workflow Conventions

### Always Use

- `pnpm/action-setup@v4` for pnpm
- `actions/setup-node@v4` for Node.js
- `actions/checkout@v4` for checkout
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` for deps

### Version Matrix

Test on:
- Node.js: 18, 20, 22
- OS: ubuntu-latest, macos-latest

### Timeouts

Set reasonable timeouts:
- lint: 10 minutes
- test: 15 minutes
- build: 10 minutes
- release: 20 minutes

### Concurrency

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true  # For PRs
  cancel-in-progress: false # For releases
```

## Secrets Required

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Auto-provided
- `NPM_TOKEN` - For npm publish
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For coverage upload

## Binary Builds

Build standalone binaries using pkg:
- linux-x64, linux-arm64
- darwin-x64, darwin-arm64
- win32-x64

Binaries are attached to GitHub releases.

## Semantic Release

Configuration in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "release": {
    "branches": ["main"],
    "plugins": [
      "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
      "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
      "@semantic-release/changelog",
      "@semantic-release/npm",
      "@semantic-release/github",
      "@semantic-release/git"
    ]
  }
}
```

## NEVER Do

- Skip CI with `[skip ci]` in production
- Hardcode secrets in workflows
- Use latest tags for actions (pin versions)
- Skip tests in release workflow
