# CLAUDE.md - Experiment Scorers Directory

This document provides guidance for working with the experiment-scorers feature, which manages LLM judges and custom code scorers for evaluating ML traces.

⚠️ ScorerCardRenderer currently receives both scorer (for header) and control
   (for expanded form). Ideally should only take scorer, with form initialized
   in a child container. See principle #2.
```

## Data Flow

```
Transform Layer (scorerTransformUtils.ts)
─────────────────────────────────────────

  ScorerConfig ────────► ScheduledScorer ────────► ScorerFormData
  (API shape)            (UI domain model)         (form state)
                         e.g. guidelines: []       e.g. guidelines: ""

  ScorerConfig ◄──────── ScheduledScorer ◄──────── ScorerFormData
```

## Key Design Principles

**Important: New features should be designed keeping these principles in mind**

### 1. Data Fetching / Rendering Separation

Containers own data fetching, mutations, and state. Renderers just display what they're given.

```
Container (data)                   Renderer (presentation)
────────────────                   ───────────────────────
ScorerCardContainer        ────►   ScorerCardRenderer
ScorerFormCreateContainer  ────►   ScorerFormRenderer
ScorerFormEditContainer    ────►   ScorerFormRenderer
SampleScorerOutputPanel-   ────►   SampleScorerOutputPanelRenderer
  Container
```

Renderers should NOT call `useQuery`, `useMutation`, or manage complex state. They receive data via props and render it.

**Note**: In some cases if the component is simple you can just define a component like ModelSection that does state management + rendering on its own without container/renderer separation. But any complex components should be split up.

### 2. Data Source: `scorer` vs Form Data

**When to use each data source:**

| Use `scorer` (ScheduledScorer)         | Use form data (via `control`)                |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Displaying persisted/saved state       | Editing or previewing editable fields        |
| Card header, collapsed summary, badges | Expanded card view, edit modal, create modal |

**Key insight:** The expanded card view is a **read-only form preview** - it shows the same form the user would edit, just not editable yet. This is why it uses form data, not `scorer`.

**Component rules:**

- Components should only receive **one data source** (either `scorer` or `control`)
- **Exception**: Container components that need `scorer` to initialize the form via `getFormValuesFromScorer()`
- If a component needs both for other reasons, consider splitting it

**Current state:** `ScorerCardRenderer` receives both `scorer` (for header) and `control` (for expanded form area). Ideally it should only take in `scorer`, and the form should be initialized in a child container component. Future components should keep this distinction clear.

### 3. Type Hierarchy: ScorerConfig vs ScheduledScorer vs ScorerFormData

Three types represent a scorer at different layers:

| Type                | Purpose                            | Shaped by                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **ScorerConfig**    | Wire format (API request/response) | Backend API contract                 |
| **ScheduledScorer** | Central UI domain model            | What a scorer semantically IS        |
