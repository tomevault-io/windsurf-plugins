## Project overview

**baygent-skills** is a collection of Agent Skills for Bayesian modeling, causal inference, and probabilistic thinking. Each skill is a self-contained subfolder following the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification).

## Development conventions

### Python environment
- Use the `baygent` mamba env: `conda run -n baygent python <script>`
- Recreate with: `mamba env create -f environment.yml`
- Never use system Python

### Skill structure
Every skill follows the Agent Skills spec:
- `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (name, description, license, metadata)
- `references/` for detailed docs (plural, not `reference/`)
- `scripts/` for utility scripts
- Description must be agent-neutral (no "Claude"-specific language)

### Code style
- PyMC 5+ syntax with coords and dims
- nutpie sampler by default
- Descriptive seeds: `RANDOM_SEED = sum(map(ord, "analysis-name"))`
- xarray-first for InferenceData operations

### Testing
- All evals now in `evals/` (bayesian-workflow, causal-inference, amortized-workflow)
- Benchmark target: 100% with skill vs ~90% without
- Each eval has: `eval_metadata.json` (prompt + assertions), `with_skill/` and `without_skill/` outputs + grading
