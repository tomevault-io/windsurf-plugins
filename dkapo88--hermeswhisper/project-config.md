# Security & Configuration

- Never commit secrets; prefer `*.xcconfig` and use Keychain at runtime.
- Review `Signing & Capabilities` and `*.entitlements` for least privilege; enable Hardened Runtime.
- Avoid private APIs; audit third‑party dependencies periodically.
- Keep model/API keys in the Keychain and load via dedicated services (e.g., `KeychainService`).
