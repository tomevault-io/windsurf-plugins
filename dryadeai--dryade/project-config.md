# Dryade — Contributor Guide for AI Coding Agents

Python FastAPI backend (`core/`) + React/TypeScript workbench (`workbench/`). This file guides any AI coding agent (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, …) working directly inside this repository.

---

## Top 3 Hard Rules

1. **Never commit internal-only content.** Everything here ends up on public GitHub forever. Keep planning docs, operational notes, vendor-specific IPs, and customer references out of the tree. When in doubt, omit.
2. **Never load plugins without a valid signed allowlist.** Zero fail-open fallbacks, ever. See Plugin Security Model below.
3. **Never use `--no-verify` on `git push`.** The pre-push hook is the local CI gate. If it fails, fix the code, re-stage, retry — do not bypass.

---

## Public Repo Boundary

Everything committed here is durable + public. Keep the scope to:

**Allowed:**
- `core/` — Python backend (FastAPI, orchestrator, autonomous, plugin loader)
- `core/core/ee/` and `*.ee.py` — EE source-available under LICENSE_EE
- `workbench/` — React/TypeScript frontend
- `docs/` — user-facing documentation
- `deploy/qdrant.yaml` — example deploy manifest
- `tests/unit/` + `tests/integration/` — public suites

**Forbidden:**
- Any private planning directories
- Any internal sync scripts or ops tooling
- `tests/ee/` (requires license infrastructure not present here)
- Hardcoded private network addresses or lab hostnames
- Absolute paths referring to a specific developer machine
- Internal phase / sprint numbers
- Internal product code-names

Before every commit, sanity-check the diff for anything that looks like a local-network address, a home-directory path, a company-internal project code-name, or a non-public planning reference.

---

## LICENSE vs LICENSE_EE

- **`LICENSE`** — DSUL (Dryade Source-Usage License). Covers `core/` (non-EE), `workbench/`, and everything outside the `ee/` boundary.
- **`LICENSE_EE`** — governs `core/core/ee/` and every `*.ee.py` file. Source is visible; production activation requires a valid license.

**EE boundary convention:**
- Any module under `core/core/ee/` is EE.
- Any file ending `.ee.py` is EE (regardless of location).
- Public test suites must not import from `core.ee.*` directly — use public stubs (`core.internal_api`, `core.plugins`).

---

## Plugin Security Model

1. **No plugin loads without a valid signed allowlist.** `~/.dryade/allowed-plugins.json` must exist with a valid Ed25519 signature verified against the TOFU-pinned Plugin Manager public key (`~/.dryade/pm-pubkey.pem`).
2. **Core enforces tier limits from the signed allowlist.** Core reads `max_users` and `custom_plugin_slots` from v2 allowlists. `required_tier` in manifests is read for catalog display only — never for gating.
3. **No fail-open patterns.** Missing / invalid / bad-signature allowlist means zero plugins load.
4. **No escape hatches.** Never add a toggle that bypasses the allowlist.
5. **No PM client in core.** Core never calls Plugin Manager. Plugin Manager pushes allowlists to core via HTTP on `localhost:9471`.
6. **Blocked plugins are invisible.** Not in allowlist means no routes, no `/api/plugins` entry, no log lines referencing the plugin.
7. **Gate at discovery time.** `validate_before_load()` runs before any plugin code is imported.
8. **Development workflow**: `dryade-pm push --plugins-dir <path>` scans local plugins and pushes a dev allowlist (tier=dev, unlimited).
9. **Plugin code authenticity.** Allowlist `plugin_hashes` carry SHA-256 digests. Core verifies on-disk code before import. Hash mismatch → silent skip.
10. **Production pipeline**: marketplace forges encrypted allowlist → PM stores, decrypts, re-signs, pushes to core.
11. **Plugin tier names.** Valid `required_tier` values: `starter`, `team`, `enterprise`. Community users have no PM and no plugins — never use `community` as a tier.

## License Lifecycle

**Canonical path**: `~/.dryade/license.dryadelicense` — a DRYADLIC magic-byte container, dual-signed Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65. Legacy JSON license paths are not supported.

**Install path**: `dryade-pm install-license --file <path>`. Writes atomically with `0600` perms. Exit codes: 0 success / 1 invalid / 2 IO.

**Device caps** (signed into token): Starter 1, Team 3, Enterprise 10. Marketplace admin can override for custom contracts.

**Offline grace** (signed into token): default 30 days. Can be forged higher for sovereign / air-gapped deployments.

**Heartbeat is fatal past the grace window.** PM compares `(now - last_successful_heartbeat_at)` against `max_offline_days` on every startup and after every heartbeat failure. Exceed → PM exits 1.

**IP clustering triggers suspension.** 3 distinct source IPs per license_id in 1h → `device_activations.status = 'suspended'` → PM exits 1, no grace.
