# z80cpmw

Win32 + wxWidgets front end for a Z80 / CP/M (RomWBW HBIOS) emulator. Ships on
two channels: the Microsoft Store (unsigned MSIX, Microsoft re-signs) and a
signed sideload beta (Azure Trusted Signing, GitHub release).

## Build

Needs two sibling checkouts beside this one — `../cpmemu` and `../romwbw_emu` —
because `z80cpmw.vcxproj` compiles core sources straight out of them. They are
not submodules and nothing fetches them.

    MSBuild z80cpmw.sln -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform=x64 -t:Rebuild -m
    cmd /c tests\run_tests.bat        # seven headless suites, ~1467 checks

The suites need no wxWidgets, no vcpkg and no window (except the rendering one,
which opens its own). They run on any machine with a compiler. wxWidgets comes
from `C:\temp\vcpkg`.

`MainWindow.cpp` and `SettingsDialogWx.cpp` are in **no** suite and cannot be —
they need a real window and an interactive window station. Changes there are
verified by driving the built app with `WM_COMMAND` + `PrintWindow`. See
`WIP.md` for what a driving script must know (pointer-carrying common-control
messages are not marshalled across processes and will crash the app).

## Rules

**Disk images come from the ioscpm release area. Always.** Every port's client
downloads them from the catalog pinned by `RELEASE_TAG` in `DiskCatalog.cpp`.
Nothing is bundled in any package — if a packaging script grows a
`Copy-Item ...disks\*` or a `File ...hd1k_*.img`, that is a bug. When the
question is "which disk image do users get?", the answer is `RELEASE_TAG`,
never the build. Changing it is a code change with its own release.

**Never sign a `-Beta` package run on a version that is already published.**
`build-msix.ps1` names its output from `Version.h`, so such a run re-mints the
published artifact under its own name and nothing in the script objects. It has
happened once, on 2026-08-28, and cost a live signing call. Check
`gh release list` against `Version.h` first. `-WhatIf` is a hard binding error
there and is not a way to find out; the safe rehearsal is
`-Beta -SkipBuild -SkipSign`, which writes a distinct `-unsigned` name and
reaches neither `sign.ps1` nor the network.

**Both channels share a version number only when they carry the same binary.**
Cut the beta with `-SkipBuild` off the same `bin\Release` the Store package was
made from. A rebuild is a different binary; if the builds differ, the numbers
must differ too.

**A `.pdb` cannot be recovered after the fact.** A rebuild has a different debug
GUID, so its symbols will not load against a shipped binary. Both packaging
scripts keep the `.pdb` beside their output and fail if it is missing — but
`build-msix.ps1` did that on its `-Beta` arm only until 1.0.25, so the rule was
true of this file before it was true of the code. 1.0.22 and 1.0.24 both shipped
Store packages with no symbols kept anywhere, and their crash dumps are
permanently unreadable. The Store package's name carries no version, so its
`.pdb` carries one instead: `dist\z80cpmw-<ver>-store.pdb`, which the next Store
build cannot overwrite.

**Say what was measured, not what was inferred.** This tree has repeatedly
carried claims that were reasoned from one side of a mechanism without checking
the other — a caveat about images the packaging scripts *copy*, without checking
whether anything *reads* them; parity cells filled in from commit messages
without opening the port's source. If an entry cannot name the command that was
run or the symbol that was grepped, it is a guess and must say so.

**Cross-port claims need a citation that resolves.** `FEATURE_PARITY.md` marks
prose about a sibling with `<!-- cites: repo -->`, and every backticked
identifier inside must resolve by `git grep` in that port at the recorded
commit. `tools/check-sibling-drift.sh` enforces it and also reports how far each
port's tree has moved past what its column was read at. Run it before trusting
that document.

## Searching this tree without a permission prompt

Use `Grep`, `Glob` and `Read`, not `grep`/`find`/`cat` through Bash. The
dedicated tools do not prompt; a Bash pipeline prompts once **per segment**, so
one `cat x && grep y | head` is three interruptions. This is also a rule for
subagents and workflows — a fan-out of seven investigators each running
`git show` is where the prompt floods have come from, so tell them the same
thing when you write their prompts, and prefer running the handful of `git` /
`gh` commands yourself in one place.

The prompts themselves are decided by `.claude/settings.json`, never by this
file: `permissions.allow` there lists the read-only Bash forms (`grep:*`,
`git log:*`, `gh release list:*`, …) plus `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`. Add to that
list when a new read-only command starts prompting. Note that Claude Code only
watches for settings changes in directories that already had a settings file
when the session started, so the first session that *creates* `.claude/` keeps
prompting until `/config` is opened once or the session restarts.

## todo.txt

Open items for **this** project only: bugs to fix and features to build, for the
next release. It is not a place for standing rules (they belong here), for
finished work (that belongs in `CHANGELOG.md`), or for notes about what some
