Read [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for the current implementation and source map.
Read [README.md](README.md) for the public overview. This file is a navigation
aid; measured results and limitations belong in the topic documents below.

## Engineering constraints

- Native weight conversion must match the Python reference byte-for-byte.
  Preserve `-ffp-contract=off`; FMA contraction changes LoRA rounding.
- Compare a recipe-derived pack against the corresponding reference pack.
  A context-binary checksum or a successful compile is not an image-quality
  measurement.
- The app uses checkpoint-owned CLIP and both VAE components for both model
  families. Shared-component archives are legacy backup/restore inputs only.
- Extra unmatched LoRA tensors warn and leave the recognized UNet layers
  usable. Text-encoder LoRA and BF16 remain unsupported; BF16 is deferred.
- SDK libraries, generated templates/models and checkpoints stay excluded
  from source control. A fresh clone needs externally supplied artifacts for
  a working APK; see [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) and [NOTICE](NOTICE).
- Published documentation should distinguish host checks, historical phone
  measurements and reported field results. Avoid broad compatibility claims
  from a single checkpoint or device.
- Keep device serials, network endpoints, private paths, credentials and local
  diagnostic reports out of published changes. Review the actual diff before
  committing; historical repository rewriting requires separate coordination.

Use the repository's current Gradle and NDK configuration. Build commands and
test dependencies are maintained in [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).
