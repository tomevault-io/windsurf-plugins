# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Instructions loading (Claude Code memory model)

Per the [Claude Code memory documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory), `CLAUDE.md` is project-level persistent context loaded each session. It is guidance, not a separate enforcement layer—keep it accurate, specific, and under ~200 lines when possible; split or use `@path` imports and optional `.claude/rules/` for larger or path-scoped instructions as that doc describes.

## Cursor rules — read first, keep in sync

This repository’s **Cursor** constraints live in **`.cursor/rules/`** (`.mdc` files). They are the canonical, always-applied (or path-scoped) rules for work done in Cursor.

**Before making substantive code or config changes:** read the `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` that apply to the areas you edit (or the whole set if scope is unclear). Treat them as mandatory alongside `.claude/rules/` if present.

**When conventions change:** update `.cursor/rules/` and this `CLAUDE.md` together so they do not contradict each other—mirror critical requirements here or in imports, and keep Cursor rules as the source of truth for editor-enforced behavior.

## What This Project Is

Kabegame is a cross-platform anime wallpaper crawler and manager built with **Tauri 2** (Rust backend) and **Vue 3** (TypeScript frontend). It supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android — **not iOS**. Crawler plugins are written in the **Rhai** scripting language.

## Commands

All top-level commands go through `scripts/run.ts` (a Tapable-based build system) and are run with `bun`.

### Development
```bash
bun dev -c main                  # Start dev server (Vite + Tauri, port 1420)
bun dev -c main --mode local     # Dev with all plugins bundled locally
bun dev -c main --mode android   # Android dev
bun dev -c main --data prod      # Dev against system data dirs (not repo-local data/)
bun dev:frontend-main            # Frontend only (no Tauri, port 1420)
```

### Build
```bash
bun b                            # Build everything (main + CLI)
bun b -c main                    # Build main app only
bun b -c main --skip cargo       # Vue build only
bun b -c main --skip vue         # Cargo build only
bun b --release                  # Copy artifacts to release/
bun b -c main --mode android     # Build Android APK/AAB
```

### Type Checking
```bash
bun check -c main                # Check Vue types + Cargo
bun check -c main --skip cargo   # Vue types only
```

### Data directory modes (`--data`)
- `dev` (default for `bun dev`): repo-local `data/` and `cache/` dirs — isolated from installed app
- `prod` (default for all other commands): system user data dirs (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kabegame` on Windows, `~/.local/share/Kabegame` on Linux/macOS)
- Use `--data prod` during dev to test against real installed data; use `--data dev` in a release build for CI/testing isolation
- Controlled via `kabegame_data` Rust cfg injected by `src-tauri/{core,app-main}/build.rs`

### Other
```bash
bun run set-version              # Bump version across workspace
bun run build:ffmpeg             # Build FFmpeg sidecar (requires libx264)
```

### Verification workflow
**Do not run `cargo build` or full builds to verify changes.** Rely on lint diagnostics (`vue-tsc`, `cargo check`) instead. Only run build commands when the user explicitly requests a build.

## Architecture

### Monorepo Layout
- `apps/main/` — Vue 3 frontend (Vite, Element Plus, Pinia, UnoCSS)
- `packages/` — Shared frontend packages (`core`, `i18n`, `image-type`, `photoswipe-vue`)
- `src-tauri/core/` — `kabegame-core`: shared Rust library (crawler engine, plugin system, storage)
- `src-tauri/app-main/` — Tauri GUI app (desktop + Android)
- `src-tauri/app-cli/` — Headless CLI
- `src-tauri-plugins/` — Custom Tauri plugins (picker, archiver, pathes, share, compress, wallpaper, task-notification)
- `src-crawler-plugins/` — Rhai-based crawler plugins packaged as `.kgpg` archives

### Build Modes
| Mode | Features |
|------|----------|
| Standard (default) | Virtual disk, CLI, store plugins |
| Light (`--mode light`) | Store only, no virtual disk/CLI |
| Local (`--mode local`, dev) | All plugins bundled locally |

### Key Architecture Rules

**No dynamic imports** — All TS/JS/Vue files must use static `import`. Dynamic `import()` is forbidden (Tauri packaging constraint).

**Path logic belongs in `tauri-plugin-pathes`** — Any path/directory calculation must live in `src-tauri-plugins/tauri-plugin-pathes/`. Other modules call into it via `AppPaths`; never hardcode or recompute paths elsewhere.

**Single source of truth for file types:**
- Image extensions/MIME: use `kabegame_core::image_type::*` (e.g. `is_image_by_path`, `supported_image_extensions`). Never hardcode `["jpg","png",...]` in Rust. Frontend uses the `get_supported_image_types` Tauri command.
- Archive extensions: use `kabegame_core::archive::supported_types()` / `is_archive_by_path()`. Never hardcode `["zip","rar"]` in Rust. Frontend fetches via Tauri command.
