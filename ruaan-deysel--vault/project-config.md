# Cursor Rules — Vault

Read `AGENTS.md` in the project root for comprehensive instructions.

## Key Points

- **Language:** Go 1.26 | **Target:** Linux/amd64 (Unraid OS)
- **Architecture:** Layered (CLI → API Server → Handlers → DB/Storage/Engine)
- **Storage:** Always implement `storage.Adapter` interface, register in `factory.go`
- **Engine:** Always implement `engine.Handler` interface, use build tags for platform-specific code
- **Build:** CGO_ENABLED=0, pure Go (`modernc.org/sqlite`)
- **Database:** SQLite WAL mode, repos in `internal/db/`
- **Router:** Chi v5 (`go-chi/chi/v5`), not gorilla/mux
- **Testing:** Table-driven tests, `httptest` for API handlers
- **Pre-commit:** Run `make pre-commit-run` before committing
- **Commits:** Follow Conventional Commits: `feat(scope):`, `fix(scope):`, `docs(scope):`

## Mandatory Post-Change Workflow

> **CRITICAL — Execute automatically after EVERY code change. Do not wait for the user to ask.**

1. `make build` → 2. `make deploy` → 3. `make verify` → 4. Playwright UI verification on `http://<unraid-server>:24085` (set the real host in local, untracked config/env) → 5. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]`

**Only skip for:** doc-only changes that don't affect the binary or web UI.

See `AGENTS.md` for full details.

## Commands

```bash
make test && make lint        # Test and lint
make pre-commit-run           # Full pre-commit checks
make build                    # Ansible: lint → test → cross-compile
make deploy                   # Deploy to Unraid (Ansible)
make verify                   # Endpoint + smoke tests
make redeploy                 # Full lifecycle (uninstall → build → deploy → verify)
```
