# .cursorrules — pointer to AGENTS.md

This repository's agent-contract single source of truth is **AGENTS.md**.

Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, and every other agent harness read the same contract from that one file. `.cursorrules` and `CLAUDE.md` exist as plain-text pointers (not symlinks) so cross-OS clones stay deterministic.

Do not add Cursor rules here. Edit `AGENTS.md` instead.

See also:
- `AGENTS.md` — authoritative agent contract
- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude pointer (same target)
- `.claude/skills/README.md` — Claude Code skill catalog authoring rules
- `docs/SKILLS_MCP_DISCOVERY.md` — skills + MCP primitive reference
