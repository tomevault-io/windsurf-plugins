You are working in the SeldonFrame Turborepo.

Execution workflow (strict):
1. Complete one requested step at a time.
2. Make minimal, surgical edits for that step only.
3. Run `pnpm build` at repo root.
4. Stop and wait for user confirmation before next step.

Monorepo structure (current):
- Apps: `apps/web`, `apps/cloud`, `apps/pro`
- Packages: `packages/core`, `packages/crm`, `packages/payments`

Boundaries:
- `@seldonframe/core`: shared primitives (integrations, events, telemetry, virality)
- `@seldonframe/crm`: product behavior, routing, server actions, UI wiring
- `@seldonframe/payments`: payment-domain utilities/logic

Key CRM paths:
- Routes: `packages/crm/src/app/(dashboard)` and `packages/crm/src/app/(auth)`
- API: `packages/crm/src/app/api/v1`
- Domain actions: `packages/crm/src/lib/*/actions.ts`
- Schema: `packages/crm/src/db/schema`
- Soul system: `packages/crm/src/lib/soul`, `packages/crm/src/components/soul`
- Layout shell: `packages/crm/src/components/layout`

Current design system cues:
- Glass surfaces via `glass-card`
- Premium typography hierarchy (`text-page-title`, section/card title tokens)
- Sidebar left-glow active pattern via sidebar overrides (`packages/crm/src/styles/components/overrides.css`)

Recently added/important components:
- Inline contacts data-grid editing: `packages/crm/src/components/contacts/contacts-inline-table.tsx`
- Split contact detail layout (fields + timeline): `packages/crm/src/app/(dashboard)/contacts/[id]/page.tsx`
- Deep command palette (navigate + contacts + deals + pages + activity):
  - `packages/crm/src/components/layout/command-palette.tsx`
  - `packages/crm/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
- Booking availability + timezone UX:
  - `packages/crm/src/components/bookings/bookings-page-content.tsx`
  - `packages/crm/src/components/bookings/public-booking-form.tsx`
  - `packages/crm/src/lib/bookings/actions.ts`

UI skill location:
- Local clone: `ui-ux-pro-max-skill/`

Architecture/safety constraints:
- Maintain `orgId` multi-tenant scoping.
- Keep event contracts typed.
- Respect demo write guards (`assertWritable`, demo client guards).
- Do not introduce Redis/Bull/BullMQ.
- Do not create per-tenant databases/deployments.
- Never expose credentials in client code.

Next.js note:
- This repo uses Next.js 16; verify framework behavior against `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before framework-level changes.

## Block Architecture

SeldonFrame has two types of blocks:

### Built-in blocks
- Located in `packages/crm/src/app/(dashboard)/[blockName]/`
- Follow these patterns:
  - Schema in `packages/crm/src/db/schema.ts`
  - Server actions in `packages/crm/src/lib/[blockName]/actions.ts`
  - Page components in `packages/crm/src/app/(dashboard)/[blockName]/page.tsx`
  - Detail pages in `packages/crm/src/app/(dashboard)/[blockName]/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Public pages in `packages/crm/src/app/[publicRoute]/page.tsx`

### Marketplace blocks
- Defined by BLOCK.md specs (see `BLOCK_MD_SPEC.md`)
- When implementing a BLOCK.md:
  - Create schema following Drizzle patterns (`orgId` on every table, UUID primary keys)
  - Create server actions using existing patterns (`"use server"`, `revalidatePath`)
  - Create pages using existing UI patterns (`useSoulLabels()`, `glass-card`)
  - Emit events using `emitEvent()` from `@seldonframe/core`
  - Read soul via `getSoul(orgId)` or `useSoulLabels()`
  - Map BLOCK.md `Person` to contacts (`contactId` FK)
  - Map BLOCK.md `Identity` to soul config
  - Map BLOCK.md `Payments` to Stripe Connect (`org.stripeAccountId`)
  - Map BLOCK.md `Email` to existing email actions
  - Register in built-in registry or marketplace tables based on block type
