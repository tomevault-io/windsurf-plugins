# CLAUDE.md — notes for sessions editing this skill

## Load-bearing invariants (change these carefully)

### The 7-field metadata contract

```python
{"recommendation", "latency_ms", "tool_calls",
 "input_tokens", "output_tokens", "model_id", "error"}
```

Appears in all of these files — if you change the shape, update **all** of them in the same commit:

- `SKILL.md` → "Metadata contract" section
- `README.md` → "The 7-field metadata contract" section
- `references/framework-adapters.md` → the opening contract block + every per-framework recipe
- `references/judge-robustness.md` → "Never drop a result" JSONL schema + "Failure categories to report" table
- `references/cross-subject-benchmarking.md` → SUBJECTS dispatch explanation
- `references/html-report-template.html` → column headers in the leaderboard + failure-categories table
- Any example harness code in the repo

### Required CLI flags on generated harnesses

`--framework`, `--test-case`, `-v`/`--verbose`, `--trials`. Baked into `SKILL.md` step 2d. Don't drop one without updating the skill's validation checklist too.

### Leniency thresholds

`<0.10` / `0.10–0.25` / `>0.25`. Defined in `references/rubric-design.md` and referenced by both `SKILL.md` step 3 and the harness's "recalibrate" warning. Keep them aligned.

## How to test changes to this skill

The skill is validated against a throwaway SEO agent at `~/dev/fresh-seo-agent/`. Two test waves:

1. **Wave 1 — single-subject.** Invoke the skill with `Add an eval layer to /Users/erweinst/dev/fresh-seo-agent`. Confirm the 4 artifacts are generated (`rubrics/main.yaml`, `test_cases/seed.yaml`, `prompts/judge.md`, `eval_harness.py`), YAML parses, Python compiles. Smoke-test one case with `--test-case easy-01 --no-judge` so you don't burn Bedrock credits.
2. **Wave 2 — multi-subject.** Add a second variant (e.g. `src/agent_terse.py` with a shorter system prompt) and a `SUBJECTS` dispatch. Run `--framework all --no-judge` and then `make_html_report.py --demo`. Grep the output HTML for `<canvas>` and `<table>` to confirm the template wired up.

**Rule**: when you touch a reference doc that a generated artifact depends on, re-run the relevant wave on a fresh agent. Don't assume the generation path still works — the earlier waves surfaced real bugs (client construction outside the try block, LangGraph `response_format` rejection on Bedrock) that nothing but an end-to-end run caught.

Never run the judge against Bedrock in a test pass unless the user explicitly asks — the `--no-judge` + `--demo` path is for skill validation.

## Format conventions for `references/`

- **Copy-paste-ready.** Every code snippet should run standalone (minus framework imports the user is already using). No pseudocode.
- **~150–300 lines per file.** Longer and the reference becomes a book; shorter and it's a footnote.
- **Match existing voice.** Brief, direct, ⚠️ for pitfalls, tables for comparison, no hype.
- **Cross-reference by path.** `see references/foo.md` — not "see the other doc". Paths survive renames better than prose references.
- **No framework worship.** The skill is framework-agnostic. When a framework misbehaves, document the fix; don't steer users away from it.

---

## What NOT to add

- **New runtime deps in generated harnesses.** Stick to `anthropic`, `pyyaml`, and stdlib. Users have to `pip install` whatever we generate — no Jinja2, no click, no rich, no tqdm. The existing `make_html_report.py` uses `string.Template` specifically to avoid Jinja2.
- **Opinionated rubrics.** The dimension catalog in `rubric-design.md` is a menu, not a mandate. Don't hardcode "correctness + completeness + faithfulness" into the skill.
- **Framework favoritism.** If a recipe in `framework-adapters.md` is longer/uglier for one framework, that's how it is. Don't hide the complexity.
- **Auto-running the judge.** Always gate judge calls behind `--no-judge` off by default *in user docs*, but leave it as opt-in in test passes. The user spends real money when the judge runs.
- **A third wave prematurely.** Waves 1 + 2 cover single- and multi-subject. Adding more test variants without a motivating bug is over-fitting the skill to one repo.

## Known open gaps (live TODOs, not closed)

1. **`TOTAL_COST_USD` is hardcoded `"n/a"`** in the HTML dashboard. Fixing it requires a model-pricing table in the skill. Options: (a) drop the field, (b) add `pricing.yaml` and teach `make_html_report.py` to look up `model_id`. Lean (a) unless someone asks.
2. **Radar axes mix 3-point and 5-point scales.** The current template plots raw scores with `suggestedMax: 5`, so a perfect 3/3 on `schema_compliance` looks like 60%. Fix: normalize every dim to `[0, 1]` before plotting. Hasn't bitten anyone yet because most rubrics are all-5-point.
