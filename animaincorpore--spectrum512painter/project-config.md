# Spectrum 512 Painter - Agent Guidelines

## Project Purpose
This project is a painting program for the **Spectrum 512 Atari ST image format**.

## Core Technical Constraints
- Use **HTML5/WebGL** technology only.
- Use **no external dependencies** (no third-party libraries, frameworks, or CDNs).
- Keep the implementation self-contained in this repository.

## Code Organization Rules
- Split behavior by responsibility into ES modules (for example: UI, canvas/viewport, I/O, tools).
- **Do not keep large functions monolithic**. If a function grows beyond a small, single-purpose unit, split it into helper functions and/or separate modules.
- Prefer one module per feature area, and one function per clear responsibility.
- Keep wiring/composition in a small entry module (currently `js/main.js`), while feature logic lives in dedicated modules.
- Keep tool identifiers stable via `data-tool` attributes in the UI and matching keys in the tool registry.

### Current JS Module Layout
- `js/ui/*`: GEM menu behavior, tool button selection, pattern palette UI.
- `js/canvas/*`: canvas document state and custom GEM viewport scrollbar behavior.
- `js/io/*`: file loading, saving, and export handlers.
- `js/tools/*`: tool state, tool controller, tool registry, helpers, and per-tool implementations.
- `js/imaging/*`: image processing and color operations (for example quantization, palette mapping, dithering, conversions).
- `js/formats/*`: file format encode/decode modules (for example Spectrum 512 readers/writers and related bitmap import/export codecs).
- `js/config/*`: shared static configuration (for example pattern class lists).

### GEM IMG/XIMG Format Notes
- Treat GEM IMG support as a family of variants: classic monochrome/palette planes and extended XIMG variants.
- Keep decoding logic modular in `js/formats/*` so plane-format handlers can be extended without large monolithic functions.
- True-color variants exist in extended XIMG usage (not only 1-plane or indexed formats), including higher plane-count encodings.
- Current implementation status:
  - Supported now: 1..8 indexed planes, 16-plane true-color (5:6:5 pseudo-planes), 24-plane true-color (8:8:8 pseudo-planes), documented RLE items, vertical replication marker, optional XIMG palette block when present.

## UI/UX Direction
- The website shall mimic an **ancient Atari GEM-like GUI**.
- Use **proper GEM-style English text** for all visible GUI labels, menus, and captions.
- Favor classic windowed desktop styling:
  - flat grayscale panels,
  - beveled borders,
  - pixel-like iconography,
  - retro menu/toolbox layout,
  - minimal modern visual effects.
- Prioritize usability for pixel-art / retro paint workflows while preserving the GEM aesthetic.
- Follow full GUI rules in `doc/CLASSIC_GUI_GUIDELINES.md` for menus, dialogs, icons, controls, and window behavior.

## Tool Behavior Reference (MacPaint-derived)
GEM Paint was modeled after MacPaint. Use MacPaint as the authoritative reference for tool behavior. The GEM visual style (see above) always takes precedence over any Mac-specific aesthetics.

### Drawing Tools
- **Pencil**: Freehand 1-pixel drawing. Toggles pixels (drawing on black inverts to white, on white to black). Shift-drag constrains to straight horizontal/vertical/diagonal lines.
- **Brush**: Freehand painting using the selected brush shape and current pattern. Shift-drag constrains to straight lines. Brush shape is chosen from a palette of selectable shapes.
- **Spray Can**: Scatters pixels randomly in a circular area around the cursor. Density increases the longer the mouse is held still.
- **Eraser**: Paints over pixels with the background color/pattern. Double-click clears the entire visible canvas area. All tools remain usable in FatBits (zoom) mode.
- **Fill (Paint Bucket)**: Flood-fills an enclosed area with the current pattern. If the boundary has gaps, fill leaks through — this is intentional classic behavior.

### Selection Tools
- **Rectangle Select**: Defines a rectangular region. Supports move, cut, copy, paste, flip horizontal/vertical, rotate 90°, and color invert on the selection.
- **Lasso**: Freehand irregular selection that automatically snaps/shrinks to the content outline. Same operations as rectangle select apply.

### Shape Tools
- **Line**: Draws a straight line from click to release. Thickness follows the current line-size setting. Shift constrains to 45° angle increments.
- **Rectangle / Rounded Rectangle**: Available in two variants — outline only, or filled with the current pattern. Shift constrains to a perfect square.
- **Oval / Circle**: Same two variants as rectangle. Shift constrains to a perfect circle.

### Text Tool
- Allows typing in a selectable font, size, and style (bold, italic, etc.). Text is committed to the canvas as pixels — it becomes part of the bitmap and is no longer editable after confirmation.

### FatBits (Zoom Mode)
- Magnifies the canvas (8× scale) so individual pixels are visible and clickable as enlarged squares. All drawing tools remain fully functional in this mode. A small navigator inset shows the unzoomed position.
