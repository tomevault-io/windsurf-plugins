# Agent Instructions for Reef

These instructions apply to AI-assisted work in `Human-Agent-Society/reef`.
`AGENTS.md` is the shared source of truth; `CLAUDE.md` is a relative symlink to
this file. Edit this file when updating shared instructions.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for project policy. Follow any more
specific `AGENTS.md` in the area you change. Explicit user instructions take
precedence over repository guidance.

## Contribution workflow

- Inspect the working tree before editing and preserve existing user changes.
  Keep each change focused on the requested problem.
- Before opening an issue or pull request, search existing issues and PRs for
  overlapping work. Follow the RFC criteria in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for changes to
  architecture, public contracts, persistence, or project policy.
- Reproduce bugs and inspect the relevant implementation before changing it.
  Avoid speculative fixes, unrelated formatting, and unnecessary abstractions.
- Use [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
  Explain the problem, resulting behavior, compatibility impact, and actual
  verification results. Disclose non-trivial AI assistance. The human
  contributor remains responsible for reviewing and understanding the change.
- Keep credentials and private transcripts out of logs, fixtures, and commits.
  Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.

## Codebase and boundaries

Reef connects inference, feedback, learning, and versioned delivery for model
weights and agent harnesses. The distribution is `reef-infra`; imports use
`reef`. Use the [codebase map](docs/contributing/codebase-structure.rst) and the
affected package's `__init__.py` docstring to find the owner of a change.

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `reef/core/` | Shared value types, wire contracts, and errors |
| `reef/dispatcher.py`, `reef/scenario/` | Coordination, scenario state, commit ordering, and recovery |
| `reef/service/` | HTTP, authentication, streaming, and deployment |
| `reef/recipe/`, `reef/train/` | Recipe contracts, processors, training, evaluation, and backend integrations |
| `reef/runtime/` | Backend-neutral runtime contracts, scheduling, and publication coordination |
| `reef/inference/` | Concrete inference integrations, engine control, and weight reception |
| `reef/surface/` | Delivery of published artifacts |
| `reef/artifact/` | Versioned artifacts and repositories |
| `reef/storage/` | Record storage contracts, persistence, and retention |
| `reef/harness/` | Harness adapters, rendering, runners, and trajectories |
| `reef/record2dataset/` | The generator service: a designer prompt for Harbor tasks, the authoring gate and oracle check, task player jobs |
| `recipes/`, `tutorials/` | Method implementations, runnable examples, and tutorials |
| `tests/`, `docs/`, `docker/` | Verification, documentation, and deployment environments |

- Keep shared mechanisms in `reef/` and method-specific policy in `recipes/`.
  The core must not import cookbook methods; `recipes/` does not ship in the
  Reef wheel.
- Keep `reef-client` a separate, dependency-free protocol client. Harnesses
  consume `reef_client`; they should not need Reef's service or training stack.
- Keep the base installation usable on CPU. GPU dependencies belong to the
  supported training environment, and concrete adapters belong under their
  integration. Declare or pin third-party dependencies instead of copying them.
- Preserve provider request bodies, scenario isolation, receipt-to-feedback
  linkage, and artifact publication/recovery contracts.

## Development environment

Use `uv` and the repository virtual environment for Python work. Reuse an
existing environment; for a new checkout, the usual setup is:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]" -e ./third_party/reef-client
pre-commit install
```

Reef requires Python 3.12 or newer, one interpreter for the service and every
child it starts; CI tests 3.12. Git LFS is required for artifact/checkpoint work.

Training-related work may also need:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[slime]"
uv pip install --no-deps --group runtime
```

The `slime` extra supplies Python-side adapter dependencies; the `runtime`
group pins Slime itself. Preserve `--no-deps` so the installation does not
replace the container's CUDA-compatible stack. Follow
[development](docs/contributing/development.rst) and [docker/README.md](docker/README.md)
for the environment required by the selected backend.

## Python style and design

- Follow `pyproject.toml`: Black and isort format at 119 columns; Ruff checks
  code and naming; mypy checks `reef`. Match nearby code and add types to new
  or changed interfaces.
- Prefer focused functions, data classes for values, and cohesive objects for
  state and lifecycle. Use composition and explicit abstract base classes for behavior.
- Do not use `typing.Protocol`, `typing_extensions.Protocol`, or `runtime_checkable`.
  Define an `ABC` and inherit it explicitly. CI checks all first-party Python files,
  including tutorials, Docker/docs/CI scripts, and root files, without baseline exceptions.
