# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> ## ⚠ TOP-PRIORITY CONTRACT — READ FIRST
> **No vanilla / one-off bash or `python3 -c` for ANY recurring cycle step. The user does not approve it.**
> If a step is deterministic and recurs, it belongs in a committed reusable script under `scripts/` (write one if missing). This includes labelled diagnostic compounds (`echo "—status—"; git status …`, `ls | grep | sort`, chained `&&` shell pipelines for inspection, `python3 -c "import json; …"`). The full rule is below under "Scripting discipline (contract — non-negotiable)" — every cycle step MUST satisfy it.

## Project Overview

This is a **Suno AI music generation prompt engineering workspace**. The goal is to craft, iterate on, and execute Suno prompts via browser automation (Claude-in-Chrome) against `suno.com/create`.

Suno generates complete songs (vocals + instruments + lyrics) from text prompts in under 60 seconds. Current model is **v5.5** (March 2026).

## Suno Prompt Anatomy

We use **Custom Mode** exclusively at `suno.com/create`. Fields:

| Field | Limit | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Style** | 1,000 chars | Genre, mood, tempo, instruments, vocal style |
| **Lyrics** | 1,000 chars | Exact lyrics with structural metatags |
| **Title** | 100 chars | Song name |
| **Instrumental** | toggle | Remove vocals |

**Style prompt approach:** v5.5 prefers conversational flowing descriptions over comma-separated tags. Write sentences, not lists: "Sublime neoclassical orchestral vocalise with monumental cinematic grandeur..." not "neoclassical, orchestral, sublime, cinematic." Aim for 850-950 chars to leave room for negative prompts and key/BPM at the end.

### Metatags (embedded in lyrics)

Structural: `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Verse 1]`, `[Pre-Chorus]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Post-Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Hook]`, `[Interlude]`, `[Break]`, `[Outro]`, `[End]`, `[Fade Out]`, `[Big Finish]`, `[Short Instrumental Intro]`

Performance: `[Whispered]`, `[Spoken Word]`, `[Belted]`, `[Male singer]`, `[Harmonized chorus]`

Instrument/FX: `[Acoustic guitar]`, `[Synth pads]`, `[Jazz saxophone solo]`, `[Silence]`, `[Applause]`

Ad-libs use parentheses inline: `(oh yeah)`, `(hey!)`

### Prompt Best Practices
- Front-load style with genre and mood (survives truncation)
- Write descriptions, not commands: "Upbeat pop track with..." not "Create an upbeat..."
- No artist names — use genre/era descriptors instead
- Use negative prompts: "no autotune", "no heavy bass"
- Keep lyrics 8-12 lines per generation to avoid timing errors
- Use `[End]` as standalone section to signal endings
- BPM and timestamps work: "120 BPM", "lyrics begin at 0:15"
- Expect 8-15 iterations to nail a prompt — small changes matter
- v5.5 prefers conversational style descriptions over comma-separated tags
- **Silence before climax** is the #1 frisson trigger — build to 80%, drop to near-silence, then deliver climax that exceeds expectations (use `[Silence]` metatag)
- **Key modulation** at climax: half-step up (e.g., D Major → Eb Major) after silence = goosebump multiplier
- **Glass harmonica** creates spatial disorientation (1-4 kHz, brain can't locate sound) — more ethereal than crystal bowls
- **Three-layer instrument control**: genre anchor + specify instruments + negative prompts (+ Exclude styles field)
- Avoid words that trigger wrong genres: "Dune"/"desert" triggers Arabic, "epic"/"massive" triggers rock/drums
- Always verify style is under 1000 chars BEFORE submitting — count characters, don't estimate

## Browser Automation

Songs are generated via Chrome automation at `suno.com/create`. The UI flow:

1. Navigate to `suno.com/create`
2. Select **Advanced** tab (top-left) — this is Custom mode
3. Fill **Lyrics** and **Style** fields
4. Expand **More Options** → set Exclude styles, Vocal Gender
5. Fill **Song Title (Optional)** field (below More Options)
6. Click **Create** → generates 2 versions
7. Listen, then optionally Extend/Edit/Crop/Replace

Key URLs:
- Create: `suno.com/create`
- Song: `suno.com/song/{UUID}`

## Skill: `/suno`

Run `/suno` (or `/suno prompts/some-file.yaml`) to submit a prompt to Suno via Chrome browser automation. The skill reads the YAML file, navigates to `suno.com/create`, fills Custom mode fields, and clicks Create.

All prompt content comes from the user — the skill never generates or modifies prompts on its own.

## Project Structure

```
.claude/skills/suno/  # /suno skill for browser automation
prompts/              # Saved prompt experiments (YAML files)
experiments/          # Logs and notes from generation sessions
scripts/              # Helper scripts for prompt generation
```

## Autonomous Generation Cycle (every 10 minutes)

The project runs an autonomous generation cycle **every 10 minutes** (6/hour). Each cycle:

1. **Research** — WebSearch for one rotating topic (new instruments, genre fusions, frisson techniques, film scoring trends) AND review what's currently topping Suno's most-listened charts to read the *signal* (genre, structure, energy, hooks, production) that is resonating right now.
