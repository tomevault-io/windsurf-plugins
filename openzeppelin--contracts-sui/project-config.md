# GitHub Copilot instructions

This repository keeps its coding conventions as data, in one place. This file
only points to them - it restates no rules.

- [`STYLEGUIDE.md`](../STYLEGUIDE.md) - single source of truth for conventions
  (how we write Move: naming, ordering, idioms, testing, documentation).
- [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) - design rationale (why), incl. upgrade
  safety.
- [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) - the gateway for AI agents; start here.

When generating or reviewing Move, follow `STYLEGUIDE.md` exactly. Do not invent
conventions from generic internet patterns; if a rule is not in `STYLEGUIDE.md`,
it is not a convention of this repo.
