# AGENTS.md

This file captures the project overview and working notes the agent would normally
produce during an init step.

## Project summary

AI control evaluation framework that runs protocol-based agent interactions against
ControlArena tasks. The primary execution mode is agent CLIs (Codex, etc.), with
manual prompting as a fallback. Outputs are summarized into safety/usefulness metrics
and Pareto front reports.

## Key goals

- Compare protocol designs (baseline, parallel verification, hierarchical cascade).
- Support honest vs attack evaluation modes with explicit attack strategies.
- Use ControlArena as a library (no fork) and generate native .eval logs when needed.
- Produce reproducible, shareable reports (JSON/CSV + Pareto outputs).

## Repo structure

- `packages/aicontrol/`: core framework (protocols, tasks, metrics, analysis)
- `apps/`: CLI entrypoints
- `experiments/`: example configs and sweep templates
- `scripts/`: helper tools (sweep expansion, manual advance, model probing)
- `docs/`: documentation and runbooks
- `data/raw/`: run outputs (results.jsonl, transcripts, logs)
- `reports/`: summary/report outputs

## Common commands

Install:

```
scripts/py.ps1 -m pip install -r requirements.lock
scripts/py.ps1 -m pip install -e .
```

Run a config:

```
scripts/py.ps1 -m apps.runner.cli --config experiments/mvp.yaml
```

ControlArena native runner:

```
scripts/py.ps1 -m apps.control_arena_cli.cli --config experiments/mvp.yaml
```

Analysis:

```
scripts/py.ps1 -m apps.analysis_cli.cli --root data/raw --report
```

Tests:

```
scripts/py.ps1 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

MVP sweep (canonical):

```
scripts/py.ps1 scripts/expand_sweep.py --config experiments/sweep_mvp.json --out-dir experiments/generated_mvp --prefix mvp
scripts/py.ps1 scripts/run_sweep.py --dir experiments/generated_mvp
```

## Important configs

- `experiments/mvp.yaml`: manual-first MVP run
- `experiments/mvp_parallel.yaml`: parallel verification
- `experiments/mvp_hierarchical.yaml`: hierarchical cascade
- `experiments/sweep_mvp.json`: sweep template for generated runs

## Key files

- `packages/aicontrol/tasks/control_arena.py`: task loading + filters/presets
- `packages/aicontrol/protocols/`: protocol implementations
- `packages/aicontrol/attacks/strategies.py`: attack strategy scaffolds
- `packages/aicontrol/orchestrator/runner.py`: run orchestration + concurrency
- `packages/aicontrol/analysis_cli.py`: reporting/pareto outputs
- `packages/aicontrol/control_arena_runner.py`: ControlArena-native runner

## Workflow notes

- Local environment: prefer the repo-local `aicontrol` venv when present (via `scripts/py.ps1` or `scripts/py.cmd`).
- If PowerShell blocks scripts, use `scripts/py.cmd` or `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/py.ps1`.
- Dependencies are pinned in `requirements.lock`; install it before editable installs.
- ControlArena requires Python 3.11+.
- MVP runs should use `experiments/sweep_mvp.json` as the canonical matrix.
- Attack evals require an explicit `attack_mode`.
- ControlArena submissions are supported only for `data_poisoning`.
- Manual providers force serial runs; CLI providers can run with `max_concurrency`.
- For ControlArena logs, use `analysis_cli` with `--control-arena-logs` to emit
  results.jsonl and standard reports.

## Where outputs go

- `data/raw/<run_id>/results.jsonl`: protocol run results
- `data/raw/<run_id>/transcripts/`: prompt/response transcripts (CLI providers)
- `data/raw/<run_id>/control_arena/logs`: native ControlArena .eval logs
- `reports/<timestamp>/`: summary.json, groups.csv, pareto outputs
