# Project AI Rules

## CRITICAL RULES

- Don't hallucinate or make up information. If you are not sure, say so.

## Documentation Standards

- All summary and user reference documentation files should be created in the `work/` directory
- Only create documentation files when explicitly necessary or requested by the user
- Do not proactively generate documentation unless there is a clear need
- Avoid adding "Project Structure" or directory tree sections to README or documentation files as they become outdated quickly
- Use GitHub admonitions for callouts: `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]`

## SQL Standards

### Snowflake SQL

- All Snowflake SQL code must follow Snowflake SQL syntax and best practices
- Reference and index official Snowflake documentation at <https://docs.snowflake.com>
- When answering Snowflake SQL questions or writing Snowflake queries, consult Snowflake-specific documentation
- Snowflake SQL files are located in the `snowflake/` directory
- All Snowflake CLI commands should be run using the `snow` CLI tool <https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/index>

### PostgreSQL/PostGIS SQL

- All PostgreSQL SQL code must adhere to PostgreSQL SQL syntax standards
- Reference and index official PostgreSQL documentation at <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/>
- For PostGIS-specific functionality, reference PostGIS documentation
- PostgreSQL initialization scripts are in the `init/` directory
- PostgreSQL queries are in the `queries/postgis/` directory
- When writing or modifying PostgreSQL SQL, ensure compatibility with standard PostgreSQL syntax
