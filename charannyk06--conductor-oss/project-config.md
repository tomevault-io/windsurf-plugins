> Context file for AI coding agents working on Conductor OSS.

## What is Conductor OSS

Conductor is a local-first AI agent orchestrator. It turns Markdown kanban boards into dispatched coding tasks, runs them via agent CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Qwen Code, Amp, Hermes, Cursor CLI, OpenCode, Droid, GitHub Copilot, CCR) in isolated worktrees, and streams results through a dashboard with a multi-agent Skills tab.

**One command. Markdown-native. Local-first by default.**

## Architecture

### Stack

- **Backend:** Rust (axum, tokio, sqlx/SQLite). Repo dev scripts use port 4749; the launcher defaults to 4748 and forwards `CONDUCTOR_BACKEND_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONDUCTOR_BACKEND_URL` into the dashboard.
- **Dashboard:** Next.js (packages/web). Repo dev scripts use port 3000; the launcher defaults to 4747.
- **CLI:** Node.js launcher + Rust native binary
- **Runtime:** native PTY-based session management; regular sessions stay terminal-first and only ACP dispatcher sessions use the dispatcher conversation pane
- **Persistence:** SQLite in `.conductor/conductor.db` + Markdown files
- **Bridge/Access:** optional relay, paired-device bridge, and dashboard access-control flows in the same repo

### Rust Crates

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `conductor-core` | Types, board parsing, config, task/session models, dispatcher |
| `conductor-server` | Axum HTTP server, routes, state management, SSE streaming |
| `conductor-db` | SQLite persistence via sqlx, migrations |
| `conductor-executors` | Agent adapters, process management, prompt delivery |
| `conductor-git` | Git/worktree operations |
| `conductor-relay` | Relay server for bridge and remote terminal flows |
| `conductor-types` | Shared bridge and transport protocol types |
| `conductor-watcher` | File system watching (board changes) |
| `conductor-cli` | Rust CLI binary |
| `notify-rust` | Desktop notification support |

### TypeScript Packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `packages/cli` | npm CLI entrypoint, native binary launcher |
| `packages/core` | Shared TS types and schemas |
| `packages/web` | Next.js 16 dashboard UI, bridge onboarding, and access controls |

### Key Server Files

- `crates/conductor-server/src/routes/` - route handlers (sessions, tasks, boards, github, terminal, attachments, access, notifications, etc.)
- `crates/conductor-server/src/state/session_manager.rs` - Core session lifecycle
- `crates/conductor-server/src/state/detached/` - detached runtime coordination and PTY streaming
- `crates/conductor-server/src/runtime.rs` - Runtime coordination
- `crates/conductor-executors/src/agents/` - agent adapters
- `crates/conductor-relay/src/` - relay and bridge transport server
- `bridge-cmd/` - companion bridge binary used by pairing flows

### Supported Agents

Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Qwen Code, Amp, Hermes, Cursor CLI, OpenCode, Droid, GitHub Copilot, CCR

### Skills

The dashboard Skills tab installs official skill bundles for the supported agents and maps them to the correct user/workspace roots automatically. It also detects custom skill folders already present on the machine.

Each adapter in `crates/conductor-executors/src/agents/` defines launch commands, process detection, and prompt delivery methods.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (stable)
- Bun >= 1.2
- Node.js >= 20.9.0
- git

### Commands

```bash
# Full dev (dashboard + backend)
bun run dev:full

# Backend only
bun run dev:backend
# or: cargo run --bin conductor -- start --port 4747

# Dashboard only
bun run dev

# Build everything
bun run build

# Tests
cargo test --workspace          # Rust workspace
bun run --cwd packages/core test  # TS core

# Type check
bun run typecheck
```

### Default Ports

- `bun run dev:full`: dashboard `http://localhost:3000`, backend `http://127.0.0.1:4749`
- `co start`: dashboard `http://127.0.0.1:4747`, backend `http://127.0.0.1:4748` unless config overrides it
- Native `cargo run --bin conductor -- start`: backend `http://127.0.0.1:4747` unless `--port` is set

## Code Conventions

### Rust

- Use `thiserror` for error types, `anyhow` for ad-hoc errors in binaries
- Prefer `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for shared state, `DashMap` where contention matters
- All API routes return `Result<Json<T>, ApiError>`
- SSE endpoints use `axum::response::Sse` with `tokio_stream`
- SQLite queries use sqlx with compile-time checked macros where possible
- `SessionStatus` is an enum, not a string
- Types are consolidated in `conductor-core` (single source of truth)

### TypeScript

- ESM only, no default exports in library code
- Bun as package manager and runtime
- Next.js 16 for dashboard with App Router

### Commits

Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`

### PR Requirements

- Every PR needs `## Type of Change` checkboxes
- Every PR needs `## User-Facing Release Notes` bullets (or `N/A - internal maintenance only`)
- CI enforced: `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, build checks
- Greptile auto-reviews all PRs

## Data Flow

1. User creates/moves task on Kanban board (`CONDUCTOR.md`)
2. File watcher detects change, parses board
3. Dispatcher picks up "Ready to Dispatch" tasks
4. Executor launches a native PTY session and streams the agent terminal
