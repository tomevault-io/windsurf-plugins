description: Produce production-grade, maintainable, high-performance Java code with strong architectural judgment. Use this skill when the user asks to design, implement, refactor, or review Java systems, services, libraries, or APIs.
---


This skill guides the creation of **robust, scalable, and readable Java systems** built with senior-level judgment. The output must reflect real-world engineering experience: clear tradeoffs, defensive coding, operational awareness, and long-term maintainability.

The user provides Java requirements: a feature, service, library, refactor, bug fix, or architectural decision. They may include constraints such as framework, database, scale, or domain context.

## Engineering Mindset

Before coding, understand the system and commit to a **clear architectural stance**:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this code solve? Who depends on it?
- **Longevity**: Is this a core system, a boundary adapter, or disposable glue code?
- **Scale & Risk**: Expected load, failure modes, data sensitivity.
- **Constraints**: Java version, frameworks, infrastructure, team maturity.
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Prefer boring, proven solutions unless innovation is justified.

**CRITICAL**: Choose an intentional design direction (simple CRUD, domain-driven, event-driven, hexagonal, reactive, etc.) and execute it consistently. Avoid accidental architecture.

Then implement **real, working Java code** that is:
- Correct and defensive
- Readable by other engineers
- Operationally safe
- Easy to test and evolve

## Core Java Excellence

Focus on:
- **Modern Java**: records, sealed classes, pattern matching, switch expressions
- **Strong typing**: value objects, enums over strings, immutability by default
- **Collections & Generics**: correct data structures, PECS rules, no raw types
- **Time handling**: `java.time` only, timezone-aware
- **Null discipline**: clear null contracts, Optional only where appropriate

Avoid:
- Overuse of streams in hot paths
- Clever one-liners that reduce clarity
- Legacy APIs (`Date`, `Calendar`, `Vector`, etc.)

## Clean Code & Design

Apply principles pragmatically:
- **SOLID**, but not dogmatic
- **Composition over inheritance**
- **Small, focused classes**
- **Explicit dependencies** via constructor injection
- **Meaningful names** that reflect intent, not mechanics

Patterns to use deliberately:
- Factory, Strategy, Builder, Adapter, Decorator, Template Method
- Avoid pattern abuse or premature abstraction

## Architecture & Structure

Design with boundaries:
- Clear separation of domain, application, and infrastructure
- Ports & adapters (hexagonal) when complexity justifies it
- DTOs at boundaries, domain objects internally
- No framework leakage into the domain layer

Structure code:
- Package by feature, not by technical layer
- Avoid cyclic dependencies
- Keep APIs small and stable

## Error Handling & Resilience

- Clear exception strategy (checked vs unchecked)
- No swallowed exceptions
- Meaningful messages and error codes
- Idempotency for retries
- Timeouts on all external calls
- Retries with backoff and jitter where safe

## Concurrency & Performance

- Understand the threading model (servlet, async, reactive)
- Prefer immutability and thread confinement
- Use bounded executors with named threads
- Avoid blocking in reactive or async flows
- Measure before optimizing; profile hot paths

## Framework Competence (when applicable)

If using Spring / Jakarta / similar:
- Understand lifecycle and autoconfiguration
- Correct transaction boundaries
- Avoid N+1 queries and lazy-loading traps
- Proper validation and exception mapping
- Secure endpoints by default

## Persistence & Data

- Solid SQL literacy (indexes, joins, pagination)
- Correct transaction isolation
- Migrations via Flyway/Liquibase
- Use ORM pragmatically; JDBC/jOOQ when appropriate
- Enforce integrity at the database level

## Distributed Systems Awareness

- HTTP clients with pooling, timeouts, retries
- Circuit breakers and bulkheads
- Messaging semantics (at-least-once, deduplication)
- Caching with clear invalidation strategy
- Graceful degradation under failure

## Testing Discipline

- Fast, deterministic unit tests
- Integration tests for boundaries (DB, HTTP, messaging)
- Clear test data builders
- Cover edge cases and failure paths
- Tests describe behavior, not implementation

## Security Fundamentals

- OWASP awareness (injection, SSRF, deserialization)
- Never log secrets or PII
- Externalize secrets
- Enforce authorization explicitly
- Validate and constrain all inputs

## Observability & Operations

- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics for latency, errors, throughput
- Tracing awareness (OpenTelemetry concepts)
- Health checks (liveness/readiness)
- Feature flags and safe rollouts

## Documentation & Communication

- Code that explains itself through structure and naming
- Comments only for non-obvious “why”
- API documentation when exposed
- Migration and breaking-change notes
- Operational notes for production systems

## Agent Operating Rules

When generating code, the agent MUST:
1. Clarify requirements and constraints
2. State assumptions explicitly if needed
3. Propose a concise approach before coding
4. Prefer the simplest correct solution
5. Write complete, compilable code (imports included)
6. Handle edge cases and failures
