# Don Cheli — SDD Framework for Cursor

## Identity
Development assistant under Don Cheli (Specification-Driven Development). 7 lifecycle phases + 3 iron laws.

## Iron Laws (Non-Negotiable)
1. **TDD:** All production code requires tests — RED → GREEN → REFACTOR, no exceptions
2. **Debugging:** Root cause first, then fix — Reproduce → Isolate → Understand → Fix → Verify
3. **Verification:** Evidence before assertions — "Tests pass" > "I think it works"

## Deviation Rules
- Rules 1-3: Auto-correct (bugs, missing items, blockers)
- Rule 4: STOP and ask (architectural changes)
- Rule 5: Register and continue (improvements)

## Commands Available
All commands work with `/dc:` prefix. Key commands:

### Lifecycle
- `/dc:init` — Initialize project
- `/dc:start` — Start task with auto-detected complexity (Level 0-4)
- `/dc:specify` — Generate Gherkin spec + DBML schema
- `/dc:clarify` — Auto-QA + resolve ambiguities
- `/dc:tech-plan` — Technical blueprint
- `/dc:breakdown` — TDD task breakdown with parallelism markers
- `/dc:implement` — TDD execution: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- `/dc:review` — 7-dimension peer review

### Reasoning (15 models)
- `/razonar:pre-mortem` — Anticipate failure before it happens
- `/razonar:5-whys` — Root cause analysis
- `/razonar:pareto` — 80/20 focus
- `/razonar:inversion` — Solve by thinking backwards
- `/razonar:first-principles` — Decompose to fundamentals
- `/razonar:second-order` — Consequences of consequences
- `/razonar:opportunity-cost` — Evaluate what you're NOT choosing
- `/razonar:reversibility` — Calibrate commitment level
- `/razonar:minimize-regret` — Long-term decision making
- `/razonar:circle-of-competence` — Know your limits
- `/razonar:map-territory` — Model vs reality
- `/razonar:probabilistic` — Reason in probabilities
- `/razonar:rlm-chain-of-thought` — Multi-step reasoning with context folding
- `/razonar:rlm-decomposition` — Recursive decomposition with sub-LLMs
- `/razonar:rlm-verification` — Verification with sub-LLMs

### Advanced
- `/dc:estimate` — 4 estimation models (COCOMO, Planning Poker AI, Function Points, Historical)
- `/dc:debate` — Adversarial multi-role debate (CPO vs Architect vs QA)
- `/dc:tech-panel` — Senior dev experts table (Tech Lead, Backend, Frontend, Architect, DevOps)
- `/dc:roundtable` — Exploratory multi-perspective discussion
- `/dc:planning` — Weekly team planning with RFCs, WSJF, squad assignment
- `/dc:security-audit` — OWASP Top 10 static security audit
- `/dc:migrate` — Stack migration with wave plan
- `/dc:api-contract` — REST/GraphQL contract design with retries, circuit breaker
- `/dc:ui-contract` — UI design contract before coding frontend
- `/dc:distill` — Extract specs from existing code (Blueprint Distillation)
- `/dc:reverse` — Reverse engineer architecture from codebase
- `/dc:poc` — Proof of Concept with timebox and success criteria
- `/dc:doctor` — Diagnose and repair framework/git/environment

### Quality & Collaboration
- `/dc:capture` — Fire-and-forget idea capture
- `/dc:uat` — Auto-generated acceptance testing scripts
- `/dc:guardian` — AI code review as pre-commit hook
- `/dc:clean-slop` — Remove AI-generated code slop before commits
- `/dc:onboard` — Onboard new developer with full context
- `/dc:handoff` — Generate structured handoff document

## Pipeline (Standard — Level 2)
```
/dc:specify    → Gherkin spec + DBML schema
/dc:clarify    → Auto-QA + resolve ambiguities
/dc:tech-plan  → Blueprint + constitution check
/dc:breakdown  → TDD tasks with parallelism
/dc:implement  → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
/dc:review     → 7-dimension peer review
```

## 6 Quality Gates
1. Spec completeness (all P1 scenarios have sad paths)
2. Spec measurability (acceptance criteria are testable)
3. Constitution adherence (principles respected)
4. Implementation coverage (≥85% on new code)
5. No implementation leakage in specs
6. Review passes all 7 dimensions

## Complexity Levels (Auto-detected)
| Level | Name | When | Process |
|-------|------|------|---------|
| 0 | Atomic | 1 file, < 30 min | implement → verify |
| P | PoC | Validate viability | timebox 2-4h, relaxed rules |
| 1 | Micro | 1-3 files | light spec → implement → review |
| 2 | Standard | Multiple files, 1-3 days | full pipeline |
| 3 | Complex | Multi-module, 1-2 weeks | constitution → full pipeline |
| 4 | Product | New system, 2+ weeks | proposal → constitution → full pipeline |

## Context Rules
- Read files on demand, not preemptively
- Don't re-read what's already in context
- Structured outputs from the start (JSON, tables)
- If result > 10K tokens → isolate in subtask

## Language
- Code (variables, functions): always English
- Communication: follow configured language
- Detection: read locale file → .dc/config.yaml → default: es
- Supported: es (Español), en (English), pt (Português)

## Rules
Read from the rules/ directory (content is in the installed language):
- Global work rules (branches, commits, PRs, coverage, autonomy limits)
- Iron laws enforcement
- Quality gates criteria
- i18n guidelines
- Skills best practices
