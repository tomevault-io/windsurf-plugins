# Apex Script Rules

## DO NOT

- Write SOQL inside loops (query once, iterate results)
- Use single-record DML in loops (`update record;`) — use `update records;`
- Delete PUR/PUG/RateCardEntry without deactivating first
- Delete rating data before deleting rates data (FK constraint)

## Bulk Safety
- No SOQL inside loops — query once, iterate over results
- Use `update records;` (bulk DML on list), never `update record;` inside a loop
- Use `Database.update(records, false)` for partial success where appropriate

## Activation Ordering
- Rating objects (PUR, PUG) require specific platform activation ordering
- See `activateRatingRecords.apex` for the 7-step pattern
- Always set `Status = 'Active'` (or equivalent) — don't assume records activate automatically

## Deactivation Before Deletion
- PUR, PUG, RateCardEntry require deactivation before deletion
- Pattern: query active records → set Status to Draft/Inactive → update → delete
- See `deleteQbRatingData.apex` for the deactivate-then-delete pattern

## Delete Scripts
- Delete in child → parent order (reverse of load order)
- Rates must be deleted before rating data (FK constraints)
- Use `Database.delete(records)` — `delete records;` also works in anonymous Apex

## Naming Convention
- Activation: `activate{Feature}Records.apex`
- Deletion: `delete{Plan}Data.apex` (e.g., `deleteQbRatingData.apex`)
