# SFDMU v5 export.json Rules

## DO NOT

- Change `Upsert` to `Insert+deleteOldData` without user approval
- Use `$$Field1$Field2` in `externalId` (v4 syntax — use `;`)
- Leave empty CSVs without `excluded: true`
- Put child objects before parent objects in the `objects` array

## externalId Format
- Use `;` delimiters: `Field1;Field2` — NOT `$$Field1$Field2` (v4 syntax)
- Relationship traversals: `Parent.Field` (1-hop), `GrandParent.Parent.Field` (2-hop)

## Operation Selection
- **Upsert**: Only when externalId uses direct fields (no relationship traversals)
- **Insert + deleteOldData: true**: Required when externalId contains ANY relationship traversal (Bug 3)
- **Update**: Modifying existing records only
- **Readonly**: Reference objects loaded by another plan
- Never change Upsert → Insert+deleteOldData without explaining which bug applies and getting user approval

## v5 Bugs to Watch
- Bug 1: All-multi-hop externalId fails validation — include at least one direct field
- Bug 2: 2-hop traversals cause SOQL injection in Upsert — use Insert+deleteOldData
- Bug 3: Relationship-traversal externalId never matches on Upsert — use Insert+deleteOldData

## Object Ordering
- Parent objects before child objects in the `objects` array
- deleteOldData objects delete in reverse array order (last first)

## SOQL Queries
- ORDER BY fields must appear in SELECT
- Relationship columns must match CSV header expectations

## Empty CSVs
- Mark `excluded: true` to prevent destructive delete-on-load
