# CCI Task/Flow Definition Rules

## After Editing

Regenerate the CCI skill reference files:

```bash
python scripts/ai/generate_cci_reference.py
```

## DO NOT

- Skip `group:` on tasks or flows
- List excluded objects in task descriptions
- Use `$$` syntax in `when:` conditions (use `project_config.project__custom__<flag>`)
- Add steps to `prepare_rlm_org` before their dependencies are deployed

## Task Naming

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `insert_qb_{plan}_data` | Load a data plan |
| `delete_qb_{plan}_data` | Delete plan data |
| `extract_qb_{plan}_data` | Extract from org |
| `test_qb_{plan}_idempotency` | Idempotency test |
| `activate_{thing}` | Apex activation script |
| `deploy_*` | Deploy metadata bundles |
| `refresh_dt_*` | Refresh decision tables |
| `manage_*` | Comprehensive management tasks |

## Required Fields

```yaml
tasks:
  my_task_name:
    group: Data Maintenance    # Required — groups tasks in cci task list
    description: >
      Specific description of what objects/SObjects are affected.
    class_path: tasks.rlm_sfdmu.LoadSFDMUData
    options:
      pathtoexportjson: datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pricing
```

## Task Groups

| Group | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Revenue Lifecycle Management` | Core RLM tasks |
| `Data Maintenance` | Delete/reset data plans |
| `Data Management - Extract` | Extract data from org to CSV |
| `Data Management - Idempotency` | Idempotency tests |
| `UX Personalization` | Flexipage/layout/profile assembly |
| `E2E Testing` | Robot Framework UI tests |
| `Partner Relationship Management` | PRM-specific tasks |

## Feature Flags

- Defined under `project.custom` — boolean flags
- `when: project_config.project__custom__billing`
- Compound: `when: project_config.project__custom__dro and project_config.project__custom__qb`
- Negation: `when: not project_config.project__custom__refresh`
- Scratch org: `when: org_config.scratch and not project_config.project__custom__tso`

## Flow Steps

Steps are integer keys. Flows can call other flows or tasks:

```yaml
flows:
  my_flow:
    group: Revenue Lifecycle Management
    description: What this flow does.
    steps:
      1:
        flow: prepare_core
      2:
        task: deploy_full
        when: project_config.project__custom__billing
```

For detailed YAML anchor patterns, `prepare_rlm_org` step ordering, and
`org_config.scratch` usage, see `.cursor/skills/cci-orchestration/SKILL.md`.
