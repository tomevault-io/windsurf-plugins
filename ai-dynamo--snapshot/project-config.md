# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. Human contributors
should start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); everything there applies
here too.

> Note: "agent" in this file means an AI coding assistant. The `agent/` module
> is a different thing entirely — the node-level Snapshot agent daemon.

## What this project is

Snapshot is a Kubernetes-native checkpoint and restore system for NVIDIA GPU
workloads. It checkpoints a fully initialized GPU pod — running process, CPU and
GPU memory — and restores that state on another compatible node. It provides
primitives, not orchestration.

## Agent skills

Repository agent skills live in `.agents/skills/` and are versioned with the
checkout. Use the `snep` skill when drafting or revising a Snapshot Enhancement
Proposal (SNEP); it guides the proposal section by section and follows the
process in `docs/proposals/README.md`.

## Repository layout

| Path | Go module | What lives there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api/` | yes | CRD types (`PodSnapshot`, `PodSnapshotContent`, `SnapshotJob`) and generated CRD YAML in `api/v1alpha1/crds` |
| `agent/` | yes | Node-level daemon that drives CRIU and CUDA checkpointing. **Linux/amd64 only** |
| `operator/` | yes | Cluster controller that reconciles the CRDs |
| `charts/snapshot/` | — | Helm chart; `charts/snapshot/crds` is a generated copy of the CRDs |
| `e2e/` | — | Python end-to-end suite (uv/pyproject), not Go |
| `docs/` | — | User and developer documentation |
| `hack/` | — | Build tooling, license boilerplate, base-package capture |

Three separate Go modules — `api`, `agent`, and `operator` — each with its own
`go.mod` and its own `Makefile`. The root `Makefile` fans out to all three.

## Build and test

Run everything from the repository root. Go 1.27.1 — the version is pinned in
`hack/tools.mk`, `go.work`, all three `go.mod` files, `agent/Dockerfile`, and
the workflows, and they must agree.

```bash
make check        # default goal: the full local gate (see below)
make test         # unit tests across api, agent, operator
make build        # build agent and operator binaries
make lint         # golangci-lint across all three modules
make fmt          # format
make generate     # regenerate CRDs from api/ types
```

`make check` is the one that matters before opening a pull request. It runs, in
order: `verify-crds`, `install-tools`, `generate`, `pagebroker-check-generated`,
`add-license-headers`, `fmt`, `tidy`, `verify-license-headers`, `lint`,
`govulncheck`, and `helm-lint`. It deliberately does not run in parallel
(`.NOTPARALLEL:`) because the stages mutate files that later stages read.

To scope work to one module, use its own Makefile — `make -C operator test`.

### Building the agent from macOS

The agent is Linux/amd64-only (`cuda-checkpoint` ships no other architecture),
so it does not build natively on a Mac. Use the containerized targets:

```bash
make linux-build   # builds agent/ inside a golang container
make linux-test    # runs agent/ tests inside a golang container
```

Both require Docker.

## Conventions that will fail CI if you miss them

1. **Every commit must be signed off (DCO).** Use `git commit -s`. Unsigned
   commits fail the DCO check and cannot be merged. See
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certificate-of-origin-dco).

2. **Every pull request must link an approved issue.** The
   `Validate Issue Reference` check fails when a pull request references no
   issue, or only issues that are closed or not yet labeled `approved`. Open the
   issue first and wait for a maintainer to apply `approved` before investing
   significant work. Do not open a pull request that skips this step.

3. **SPDX license headers are required on new files.** `make add-license-headers`
   adds them from `hack/boilerplate.addlicense.txt`; `verify-license-headers`
   checks them in CI. Generated CRDs are exempt.

4. **CRDs are generated, not hand-edited.** Edit the types under `api/v1alpha1`,
   then run `make generate`. The chart copy in `charts/snapshot/crds` must stay
   in sync with `api/v1alpha1/crds` — `verify-crds` fails on drift and tells you
   to run `make generate` and commit the result.

5. **The agent base image is pinned in one place.** `AGENT_BASE_IMAGE` is read
   out of `agent/Dockerfile`. If you change it, re-run
   `make capture-base-packages` so the committed package baseline matches;
   `verify-base-packages` enforces this.

## Preferred and deprecated patterns

Concrete examples of the shape a change should take here. Each is enforced
somewhere — a linter, a `make` target, or a CI job — so getting it wrong shows
