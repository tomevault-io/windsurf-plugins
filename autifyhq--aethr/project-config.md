## Access & Security

- Don't read .env files or other files containing secrets or credentials

- Use npm run lint:fix to fix eslint errors before making other changes
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Utilize type inference as much as possible
- Follow existing code patterns and architectural decisions

## Development Approach

- Prioritize modular architecture with clean interfaces
- Follow test-driven development practices when possible
- Ensure proper error handling with useful messages
- Maintain compatibility with Node.js v22+

## Project Guidelines

- Use LangChain/LangGraph for ReAct agent implementation
- Use Pino for terminal UI components
- Support multi-LLM providers via environment variables
