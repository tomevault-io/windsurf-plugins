# CLAUDE.md

Eventum is a synthetic data generation platform built around a three-stage plugin pipeline: Input (generates timestamps) -> Event (produces events) -> Output (delivers to endpoints).

## Structure

This repository is the main part of a multi-repo workspace at `../`:

- `eventum/` (this repo) - Python backend, CLI, HTTP API, and the Studio UI
- `../docs/` - Next.js + Fumadocs documentation site deployed to https://eventum.run
- `../content-packs/` - ready-to-use generator projects that produce realistic data

Inside this repo, the Python package `eventum/` is organized as:

- `plugins/` - plugins of eventum (`input/`, `event/`, `output/`)
- `core/` - generation engine that wires plugins into pipeline
- `api/` - FastAPI routers, models, middleware for the HTTP API
- `ui/` - React/TypeScript frontend for Eventum Studio UI
- `server/` - HTTP server entry point that wires HTTP API, UI and other services
- `app/` - top-level application orchestrating generators and the server
- `cli/` - CLI commands (`run`, `generate`, `eventum-keyring` etc.)
- `logging/`, `security/`, `utils/` - supporting packages
- `www/` - bundled static UI assets shipped with the package

Alongside the package at the repo root:

- `config/` - reference `eventum.yml` and `startup.yml` configurations
- `LOGGING.md` - structured logging data model (field names, types, semantics) - `structlog` context keys should follow it

## Stack

**Backend** (`eventum/`):
- Package manager: `uv`
- Build backend: `hatchling`
- Lint + format: `ruff`
- Type check: `mypy` (standard mode)
- Tests: `pytest`
- Validation: Pydantic
- Logging: `structlog`

**Frontend** (`eventum/ui/`):
- Package manager: `pnpm`
- Build tool: Vite
- Lint: ESLint
- Format: Prettier
- Type check: `tsc`
- Components library: Mantine
- Validation: Zod

All app can run in Docker.

## Commands

Project-specific invocations that aren't obvious from the Stack section:

- Run the full application: `uv run eventum run -c <eventum.yml>`
- Run a single generator: `uv run eventum generate --path <generator.yml> --id test --live-mode true`

Standard tool invocations (`uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check`, `uv run mypy eventum/`, `pnpm build`) follow directly from the Stack section.

## Style

- **Python style**: 79-character lines for code and 72-character lines for docstrings - applies to `.py` files only. Do not hard-wrap prose in Markdown, MDX, YAML, or other formats; let the renderer/formatter handle those. ASCII only in Python code, comments, and docstrings.
- **Python typing and docstrings**: Full types and complete docstrings on public interfaces. Internal one-liners are fine, unless the logic is non-trivial.
- **Dashes**: Use a single hyphen `-` instead of em dash `—` in source code. The em dash `—` is allowed for MDX prose under `../docs/`.

## Rules

Area-specific rules live in `.claude/rules/`, scoped by `backend`, `frontend`, `docs`, and `content`. Read the relevant scope before touching that area.

## Hard rules

- **Commands**: Run appropriate commands through `uv run`. Don't invoke `python`, `pytest`, `ruff`, or `mypy` directly to avoid environment errors.
- **Tests** are co-located under `<package>/tests/test_<name>.py`. Every feature or bug fix ships with tests.
- **Branches**: Use git-flow model. Feature branches are created off `develop`, never off `master`.
- **Commits**: Use conventional commits. Valid scopes are top level packages names.

## Common rules

**Safeguards**
- **Never commit or push** unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Respect user edits**: Never re-add content the user has deleted.

**Reasoning**
- **Analyze before acting**: A user request is a hypothesis to weigh, not a command to execute. Before applying a change, check whether it's actually the right move - does it fit the existing design, duplicate an existing rule, create inconsistency? Surface concerns first; don't execute silently if something feels off.
- **Intent over literal**: The request is data about a goal. Execute the goal - if the literal ask misses it, say so and propose what actually serves the goal.
- **Evidence over inference**: Before stating how code works, read it. Don't infer from names, structure, or prior patterns.
- **Name your assumptions**: When a conclusion rests on assumptions, surface them explicitly. An unnamed assumption is a future error.
- **Depth before ascending**: Fully understand what is in front of you before moving up the stack or on to the next step. Gaps at the base compound upward into bigger mistakes.
- **Root cause over symptom**: Fix causes, not presentations. Ask "why" twice. If a rule conflicts, find the conceptual clash - don't shuffle wording.
- **Self-critique before commit**: Before finalizing output, attack your own draft. Where would a careful reader object? Fix those first.

**Communication & stance**
- **Surface problems honestly**: Report failed commands, flag uncertainty. Do not proceed silently over unknowns.
