# webfox

This repository contains **webfox**, a TypeScript library, CLI, and pi extension
for configurable web access.

It exposes web-related capabilities through interchangeable providers instead of
tying each capability to a single backend.

See `README.md` for user-facing documentation.

## Setup

Enter the development shell and install dependencies and hooks:

```bash
nix develop
bun install --frozen-lockfile
lefthook install
```

For automatic activation with direnv and nix-direnv configured, run
`direnv allow` once in this checkout.

Pushing runs the quality gates automatically. No need to run checks manually.

## Nix packaging

- `nix/package.nix` builds from `package-lock.json`; keep every dependency's
  integrity hash present, including nested dependencies.
- When the npm lockfile changes, update `npmDepsHash`: temporarily set it to
  `lib.fakeHash`, run `nix build`, and use the reported hash.
- Validate packaging changes with `nix build`. CI builds on Linux and macOS
  and checks the installed CLI without provider credentials.

## Release engineering

- Use `tenzir-ship` for changelog management and releasing
- Add changelog entries for user facing changes
- Before releasing, ensure `main` is in sync with `origin/main`
- To release, dispatch .github/workflows/release.yaml with a title & intro
