# AGENTS.md

Guidance for Claude Code and other agentic assistants working in this
repository. Keep this file concise. The architecture documentation in
[`docs/`](docs/README.md) holds internal project notes. Developer-facing guides
live in the DocC catalogs under `Sources/`.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
bun run test                                       # Repo gate: shared suite + policy checks
bun run test:all                                   # Exhaustive checked-in primary-repo test surface
swiftly run swift build                            # Build all root-package targets
swiftly run swift test                             # Run root-package tests
swiftly run swift test --filter SwiftTUITests.SwiftUISurfaceTests             # One test suite
swiftly run swift test --filter SwiftTUITests.SwiftUISurfaceTests/testName    # One test
swift format format -i --configuration .swift-format.json Sources/ Tests/     # Format
```

Always run `bun run test` after changes that touch shared code, platform
products, or repository tooling. Make sure that it passes before you complete
the work. Example-package coverage lives in `SwiftTUI/swift-tui-examples`.
Do not run repo-local builds or tests with bare `swift` or `xcrun swift` — use
`swiftly run swift ...` so runs match the pinned toolchain. See
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full toolchain, gate, and
release story.

## Architecture (one-page summary)

```
SwiftTUIPrimitives -> SwiftTUIGraph -> SwiftTUICore -> SwiftTUIViews -> SwiftTUIRuntime
```

- **SwiftTUIPrimitives** — leaf vocabulary: inert value types only (geometry,
  identity, style/color values, draw/layout metadata, the `Animatable` math). No
  engine, no render algorithms. Builds independently. Foundation-free.
- **SwiftTUIGraph** — the reconciliation engine (the AttributeGraph analog).
  It owns `ViewGraph`/`ResolvedNode`, state slots, dependency tracking,
  invalidation planning, reuse gates, checkpoints, and entity routing. It also
  owns the runtime registries, the scheduler, and animation intent. Depends on
  `SwiftTUIPrimitives` **only** —
  the compiler enforces that graph code names no render type. Foundation-free.
- **SwiftTUICore** — the render engine: measure/place/draw/raster/commit phases
  and their typed products, extractors, style resolution, content engine. Consumes
  the graph's `ResolvedNode` snapshots. It `@_exported`-imports Graph and
  Primitives, so
  `import SwiftTUICore` is unchanged. Terminal-IO-free.
- **SwiftTUIViews** — the SwiftUI-shaped authoring surface (`View`, controls,
  layout, state, focus, gestures). `@_exported`-imports Core so the published
  `SwiftTUIViews` product is a self-sufficient authoring surface for external
  view libraries (SwiftTUICharts consumes exactly this).
- **SwiftTUIRuntime** — the run loop, renderer, scenes, and host integration.
- **SwiftTUI** — the batteries-included convenience product. It re-exports the
  combined terminal/WebHost runner and `SwiftTUIAnimatedImage`.
- **SwiftTUICharts** — chart and graph views. It ships from the peer repository
  [`SwiftTUI/swift-tui-charts`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-charts),
  composed on the public `SwiftTUIViews` surface.

`DefaultRenderer` runs one composed runtime stage pipeline:

```
head -> animation injection -> late-preference reconciliation -> fused frame tail -> commit
```

The fused tail produces the seven typed phase products in order:

```
resolve -> measure -> place -> semantics -> draw -> raster -> commit
```

Full developer-facing detail lives in
[Runtime-Render-Pipeline.md](Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/SwiftTUIRuntime.docc/Runtime-Render-Pipeline.md).
Internal source-layout context lives in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Development Guidelines

- When a new feature replaces an existing constraint, search for and remove
  **all** old guards and assertions that enforce the previous constraint. Do
  not leave stale invariants behind.
- Put each new file in one subsystem. Keep the source layout in
  [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) aligned with file moves.
- New files that touch C stdio/POSIX (`open`/`write`/`getenv`/`FILE`, …) must
  stay **WASI-safe and strict-memory-safety clean**. Import each libc:
  `Darwin`, `Glibc`, `Android`, and `Musl`. Exclude path-based POSIX code with
  `#if !canImport(WASILibc)`. Use `DiagnosticTraceSink` and
  `TerminalPOSIXController` as models. Mark each unsafe call `unsafe`.
  A WASI-only break in 0.0.19 passed the Linux-only gate. The
  `EnvFrameTraceSink` break in 0.0.26 also passed it. The repository gate now has a
  `wasm32-wasi cross-compile` lane for
  `SwiftTUIWASI`. Before you push a WASI-related change, run `swiftly run swift
  build --swift-sdk swift-6.3.3-RELEASE_wasm --target SwiftTUIWASI`. Use
  `--target`, not `--product`. A library-product build includes non-WASI PTY
  targets.
- Treat fixture changes as evidence, not housekeeping — see
  [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#rendered-text-fixtures).
- For runtime state bugs, distinguish transient flicker from true state loss.
  If state must survive lazy-tab, deferred-content, or presentation churn,
  hoist ownership above that seam. Do not hoist unrelated state. Distinguish
