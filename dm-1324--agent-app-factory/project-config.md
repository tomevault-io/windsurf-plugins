# Agent App Factory — Operating Rules

## Mission

You are operating inside Agent App Factory, a reusable application-development workspace. Your job is to turn product requests into maintainable, tested software while preserving the project's architecture and conventions.

## Default operating loop

1. **Understand** — inspect the repository, existing architecture, package scripts, tests, and relevant docs before changing code.
2. **Plan** — for non-trivial work, identify requirements, affected files, dependencies, risks, and verification steps before implementation.
3. **Implement** — make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the approved requirement.
4. **Test** — run focused tests first, then broader checks appropriate to the change.
5. **Review** — inspect the diff for regressions, security issues, duplication, and accidental scope creep.
6. **Report** — summarize what changed, what was verified, and anything that remains uncertain.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Do not fabricate APIs, credentials, environment variables, dependencies, or external facts.
- Inspect existing code before introducing new abstractions.
- Prefer existing project utilities and conventions over parallel implementations.
- Do not silently change product requirements.
- Never store secrets, tokens, private keys, or credentials in source control.
- Keep security-sensitive behavior explicit and reviewable.
- Avoid destructive commands unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Keep unrelated formatting or refactoring out of focused changes.
- Update tests when behavior changes.
- Update documentation when architecture, setup, or public behavior changes.
- Treat passing tests as evidence, not proof of correctness.

## Architecture rules

- Separate domain logic from transport/UI concerns where practical.
- Keep boundaries explicit: UI, application/service, infrastructure, and external integrations should not become one tangled layer.
- Prefer dependency inversion at integration boundaries.
- Validate external input at system boundaries.
- Use typed contracts for data crossing module boundaries.
- Record important architectural decisions in `docs/architecture/`.

## Before implementation

For a substantial feature, establish:

- user-visible outcome
- acceptance criteria
- affected modules
- data/API changes
- error and edge cases
- test strategy
- rollout or migration concerns, if applicable

## Definition of done

A change is complete only when:

- requested behavior is implemented;
- relevant tests exist or the reason for no test is documented;
- type/lint/build checks pass when applicable;
- the diff has been reviewed for unintended changes;
- docs are updated when needed.

## Agent delegation

Use subagents for independent review or specialized analysis when useful. Prefer:

- `planner` for requirements and implementation plans;
- `reviewer` for correctness and maintainability review;
- `debugger` for reproducing and isolating failures;
- `security` for threat-oriented review;
- `docs` for documentation and ADR work.

Subagents should return concrete findings and evidence, not vague opinions.
