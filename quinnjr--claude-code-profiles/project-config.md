This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Cross-platform shell functions for managing multiple Claude Code configuration profiles via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Each profile is a complete, isolated config directory. A transparent `claude()` wrapper auto-resolves the active profile so users just run `claude` normally.

Three equivalent implementations: POSIX sh (sourced), PowerShell (dot-sourced), and Windows cmd batch.

## Architecture

The POSIX and PowerShell implementations are sourceable function files (not standalone scripts). They each define two functions: `claude()` (transparent wrapper) and `claude-profile()` (management). The cmd batch script is standalone since cmd lacks a function-sourcing mechanism.

- **`claude-profile.sh`** (POSIX sh) — reference implementation. Sourced in `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`. Provides `claude()` wrapper that auto-resolves the default profile before calling the real binary via `command claude`. Provides `claude-profile()` for management commands. Strict POSIX only: no `local`, no `[[ ]]`, no arrays, no bashisms. Uses `printf` over `echo`, `_cp_`-prefixed variables, `return` (not `exit` — runs in user's shell). On Git Bash / MSYS2 (detected via `$MSYSTEM`), profiles are stored at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\claude-profiles\` and paths are converted via `cygpath -w` before invoking `claude.exe` so they are shared with the cmd/PowerShell implementations.
- **`claude-profile-init.ps1`** (PowerShell 5.1+/pwsh 6+) — cross-platform. Dot-sourced in `$PROFILE`. Same two-function model. Uses `$args` manual parsing (not `param()`) to avoid conflicts with PowerShell parameter binding. `Get-Command -CommandType Application` to find the real `claude` binary past the function.
- **`claude-profile.cmd`** (Windows batch) — standalone script. Uses `goto :label` dispatch, `setlocal enabledelayedexpansion`, `endlocal & set` idiom to leak `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to the caller. No transparent `claude` wrapper (cmd limitation). Users run `call claude-profile.cmd use <name>` then `claude` separately.

Profile data lives at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/claude-profiles/` (Linux/macOS/WSL, default `~/.local/share/claude-profiles/`) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\claude-profiles\` (Windows, including Git Bash/MSYS2). A `.default` file stores the default profile name as plain text without trailing newline.

The tool itself is installed at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/claude-profile/` (Linux/macOS) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\claude-profile\` (Windows) — note the singular form, distinct from the plural `claude-profiles/` data directory.

## Command Interface

All three implementations share the same command interface:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `claude-profile` | Show current profile status (active + default) |
| `claude-profile use <name>` | Switch to a profile for the current session |
| `claude-profile create <name>` | Create a new profile |
| `claude-profile list` | List all profiles (marks default and active) |
| `claude-profile default [name]` | Get or set the default profile |
| `claude-profile local [name]` | Show, set, or `--remove` the directory-local `.claude-profile` |
| `claude-profile auto [on\|off\|status]` | Control directory-local auto-switching (sh/ps1 only) |
| `claude-profile skills ...` | Manage the shared skill pool and per-profile selections (see below) |
| `claude-profile which [name]` | Show the resolved config directory path |
| `claude-profile delete <name>` | Delete a profile (with confirmation) |
| `claude-profile help` | Show help |

## Directory-Local Profiles

A `.claude-profile` file (first non-empty, non-comment line = profile name) switches `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when the shell enters that directory or any descendant, and reverts on leaving. An explicit `claude-profile use` pins the session and wins until `claude-profile auto on`.

The pin is tracked via an exported `CLAUDE_PROFILE_AUTO_SET` marker: auto-switching only manages `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when its value equals that marker, so anything set by hand (or inherited from outside) is left alone. Exporting it means nested shells keep auto-managing rather than treating the inherited value as manual.

Directory-change hooks differ per shell: zsh `chpwd`, bash `PROMPT_COMMAND`, `cd` wrapper elsewhere; PowerShell 6+ `LocationChangedAction`, PowerShell 5.1 `prompt` wrapper. cmd.exe has no hook — a bare `call claude-profile.cmd` resolves the dotfile at invocation time instead.

Because bash re-runs the resolver on every prompt, `_cp_auto_switch` short-circuits when `$PWD` is unchanged and the upward walk uses only parameter expansion (no `dirname` fork per component). That short-circuit also rate-limits the "invalid/missing profile" warnings to once per directory entry.

## Per-Profile Skills

A shared skill pool lives at `<data-root>/skills/` (the profile name
`skills` is therefore reserved and rejected by validation in all three
implementations, including the `.claude-profile` resolvers). `skills
register <name> <path>` links a skill source directory (must contain
`SKILL.md`) into the pool — `ln -s` on POSIX, directory junctions
(`mklink /J`, no admin rights) on Windows including via Git Bash
