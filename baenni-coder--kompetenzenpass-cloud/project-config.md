# CLAUDE.md - Digitaler Kompetenzpass (Cloud Version)

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-02
**Repository:** baenni-coder/kompetenzenpass-cloud
**Language:** German (UI and comments)

## Project Overview

This is a cloud-based digital competency tracking system (Kompetenzpass) for educational settings. Students can self-assess their competencies using a star-rating system, while teachers can manage competencies, classes, and view student progress reports. All data is stored in Firebase Firestore with real-time synchronization.

### Purpose
- Students track their skill progress across various competencies
- **Gamification with badges & achievements system (16 automatic + unlimited custom badges)**
- Teachers manage competencies, classes, and monitor student progress
- **Teachers can bulk-create student accounts with auto-generated credentials**
- **Teachers can bulk-assign star ratings to multiple students at once**
- **Teachers can create and award custom badges to students**
- **Printable access credentials overview for easy distribution**
- Real-time cloud synchronization across devices
- PDF export functionality for competency reports (including badges)

## Firebase Configuration

### Collections Schema

#### `users` Collection
```javascript
{
  name: string,           // Student/teacher name
  email: string,          // Authentication email
  role: string,           // "student" or "teacher"
  class: string,          // Class identifier (e.g., "7a")
  createdAt: timestamp,   // Account creation time
  lastActive: timestamp   // Last login time
}
```

#### `progress` Collection
```javascript
{
  ratings: {              // Object mapping competency level IDs to ratings
    [levelId]: number     // Rating value 0-5 stars (e.g., "IB-1-1-a": 4)
  },
  lastUpdated: timestamp  // Last modification time
}
```

#### `classes` Collection
```javascript
{
  name: string,           // Class name (e.g., "7a", "8b")
  description: string,    // Optional description (e.g., "Schuljahr 2024/25")
  grade: string,          // Grade level (e.g., "7", "8", "KiGa", "1./2.", "3./4.")
  createdBy: string,      // UID of teacher who created it
  createdAt: timestamp    // Creation time
}
```

#### `competencyAreas` Collection (NEW - Hierarchical Structure)
```javascript
{
  id: string,             // Area ID (e.g., "medien", "informatik")
  name: string,           // Area name (e.g., "Medien", "Informatik")
  emoji: string,          // Icon emoji (e.g., "📱", "💻")
  order: number           // Display order
}
```

#### `competencies` Collection (Updated - Hierarchical Structure)
```javascript
{
  id: string,             // Competency ID (e.g., "IB-1-1")
  areaId: string,         // Reference to competencyArea (e.g., "medien")
  name: string,           // Full competency description
  lpCodePrefix: string,   // LP code prefix (e.g., "IB.1.1")
  order: number           // Display order
}
```

#### `competencyLevels` Collection (NEW - Hierarchical Structure)
```javascript
{
  id: string,                    // Level ID (LP code with dashes, e.g., "IB-1-1-a")
  competencyId: string,          // Reference to parent competency (e.g., "IB-1-1")
  lpCode: string,                // Full LP code (e.g., "IB.1.1.a")
  description: string,           // Detailed level description
  cycles: array<string>,         // Cycles (e.g., ["Zyklus 1", "Zyklus 2"])
  grades: array<string>,         // Grade levels (e.g., ["KiGa", "1./2."])
  isBasicRequirement: boolean,   // Is this a "Grundanspruch"?
  order: number                  // Display order within competency
}
```

#### `competencyIndicators` Collection (NEW - Granular Assessment)
```javascript
{
  id: string,             // Indicator ID (auto-generated)
  levelId: string,        // Reference to competencyLevel
  text: string,           // "Ich kann..." statement (e.g., "Ich kann die Vor- und Nachteile von Nicknames im Internet erkennen")
  order: number,          // Display order within competency level
  createdBy: string,      // Teacher UID who created it
  createdAt: timestamp    // Creation time
}
```

**How Indicators Work:**
- Teachers define concrete "Ich kann..." statements for each competency level
- Students rate each indicator individually (1-5 stars)
- The parent competency level rating is automatically calculated as the average of all indicator ratings
- Indicators are optional - competency levels without indicators work as before with direct rating
- Indicator ratings are stored in the progress document with the key format: `indicator_[indicatorId]`

#### `artifacts` Collection (File Uploads)
```javascript
{
  userId: string,         // Student UID who uploaded
  competencyId: string,   // Associated competency level ID
  fileName: string,       // Original file name
  fileUrl: string,        // Firebase Storage URL
  fileType: string,       // MIME type
  uploadedAt: timestamp   // Upload time
}
```

#### `userBadges` Collection (NEW - Badge System)
```javascript
{
  userId: string,         // Student UID who received the badge
  badgeId: string,        // Reference to badge (from BADGE_DEFINITIONS or customBadges)
  awardedAt: timestamp,   // When badge was awarded
  awardedBy: string,      // Optional: Teacher UID who manually awarded it
  awardedByName: string,  // Optional: Teacher name (stored directly to avoid permissions issues)
  reason: string,         // Optional: Reason for manual award
  notified: boolean       // Whether student was notified
}
```

**How Badges Work:**
- Automatic badges are awarded based on criteria (e.g., "10 competencies with 3+ stars")
- Teachers can manually award custom badges with optional reason
- Each user can only receive each badge once
- Badges include emojis, rarity levels, and colors
- Teacher name is stored directly in badge to avoid Firestore permissions issues

#### `customBadges` Collection (NEW - Teacher-Created Badges)
```javascript
{
  name: string,           // Badge name (e.g., "Kreativ-Preis")
  description: string,    // Badge description
  emoji: string,          // Emoji icon (e.g., "🎨")
  rarity: string,         // "common", "rare", "epic", "legendary"
  color: string,          // Hex color code (e.g., "#667eea")
  type: string,           // Always "custom"
  category: string,       // Always "teacher"
  createdBy: string,      // Teacher UID who created it
  createdAt: timestamp,   // Creation time
  order: number           // Display order
}
```

**Badge System Features:**
- 16 pre-defined automatic badges (milestones, area experts, time-based)
- Teachers can create unlimited custom badges
- Badge showcase in student dashboard
- Badge collection modal with earned/locked views
- Animated notifications when badges are earned
- PDF export includes badges
- Rarity system: Common 🟢, Rare 🔵, Epic 🟣, Legendary 🟡

### Firestore Security Rules

⚠️ **CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION:** The Firebase config (including API key) is exposed in `index.html:16-24`. This is standard for client-side Firebase apps, but **server-side security rules are MANDATORY**.

#### Deploying Security Rules

The complete security rules are defined in `firestore.rules`. To deploy them:

**Option 1: Firebase Console (Recommended for beginners)**
1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project → Firestore Database
3. Navigate to "Rules" tab
4. Copy contents from `firestore.rules`
5. Click "Publish"

**Option 2: Firebase CLI (Recommended for development)**
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in project (only once)
firebase init firestore

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

#### Security Rules Overview

The `firestore.rules` file implements role-based access control (RBAC):

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ All operations require authentication
- ✅ Students can only access their own data
- ✅ Teachers have elevated permissions
- ✅ Role validation via Firestore lookup
- ✅ Resource-level ownership checks

**Collection Access Matrix:**

| Collection | Students (Read) | Students (Write) | Teachers (Read) | Teachers (Write) |
|------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| `users` | Own only | Own only | All | All |
| `classes` | All | ❌ | All | All |
| `competencyAreas` | All | ❌ | All | All |
| `competencies` | All | ❌ | All | All |
| `competencyLevels` | All | ❌ | All | All |
| `competencyIndicators` | All | ❌ | All | All |
| `progress` | Own only | Own only | All | All |
| `progressHistory` | Own only | Own only | All | Create |
| `artifacts` | Own only | Own only | All | Delete |
| `userBadges` | Own only | Own only (auto) | All | All |
| `customBadges` | All | ❌ | All | Create |
| `competencyReviews` | All | Own only (create) | All | Update |

**Important Features:**

1. **Progress Collection** (includes comments)
   - Students can read/write ratings (via review system)
   - Teachers can add/edit comments
   - Schema: `{ ratings: {}, comments: {}, pendingReviews: {} }`

2. **Progress History** (NEW - 2025-12-02)
   - Auto-created on every rating change
   - Students can only read their own history
   - Teachers can read all histories
   - Used for timeline feature

3. **Badge System**
   - Students can create userBadges (automatic awards)
   - Teachers can create userBadges (manual awards)
   - Only teachers can create customBadges
   - Everyone can read badges

4. **Review System**
   - Students submit reviews (create)
   - Teachers approve/reject (update)
   - All can read (for badge counter)

#### Helper Functions in Rules

```javascript
function isAuthenticated() {
  return request.auth != null;
}

function isOwner(userId) {
  return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

function getUserRole() {
  return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role;
}

function isTeacher() {
  return isAuthenticated() && getUserRole() == 'teacher';
}
```

#### Testing Security Rules

**Firebase Console:**
1. Firestore Database → Rules tab
2. Click "Rules Playground"
3. Test read/write operations with different roles

**Example Tests:**
```
# Test student can read own progress
Auth: student-uid-123
Read: /progress/student-uid-123
Expected: Allow

# Test student cannot read other progress
Auth: student-uid-123
Read: /progress/student-uid-456
Expected: Deny

# Test teacher can read all progress
Auth: teacher-uid-789 (with role=teacher)
Read: /progress/student-uid-123
Expected: Allow
```

#### Important Notes

- **Role verification requires Firestore read:** Each request with `getUserRole()` counts toward quota
- **Update rules when adding new collections:** Always update both `firestore.rules` and this documentation
- **Test thoroughly:** Use Rules Playground before deploying to production
- **Monitor usage:** Check Firebase Console → Usage tab for rule evaluations

#### Common Security Issues to Avoid

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use `allow read, write: if true;` (public access)
- Trust client-side role checks only
- Forget to update rules when adding collections
- Use admin SDK credentials in client code

✅ **DO:**
- Always require authentication
- Validate ownership at resource level
- Use helper functions for DRY rules
- Test rules before deploying
- Document rule changes in CLAUDE.md

## Hierarchical Competency Structure

**NEW Feature (2025-11-28):** The app now uses a three-level hierarchy based on the Swiss "Lehrplan Informatik & Medien":

### Structure Overview

```
📱 Competency Area (Kompetenzbereich)
  └── 📚 Competency Group (Kompetenz)
       └── ⭐ Competency Level (Kompetenzstufe)
            ├── LP Code (e.g., IB.1.1.a)
            ├── Description
            ├── Cycles (Zyklus 1-3)
            ├── Grade Levels (KiGa, 1./2., 3./4., 5./6., 7., 8., 9.)
            └── Basic Requirement Flag
```

### Three Competency Areas

1. **📱 Medien** - Media competencies
2. **💻 Informatik** - Computer science competencies
3. **🎯 Anwendungskompetenzen** - Application competencies

### Grade-Level Filtering

**How it works:**
1. Teachers assign a `grade` (e.g., "7", "8", "3./4.") when creating/editing a class
2. Students are assigned to a class (e.g., "7a")
3. App looks up the class's grade level in Firestore
4. Only competency levels matching that grade are displayed to students
5. Teachers see all competency levels (no filtering)

**Example:**
- Class "7a" has grade "7"
- Student in "7a" sees only competency levels with `grades` array containing "7" or "7./8."
- Flexible matching handles various formats

### Import Process

**Initial Setup:**
1. Open `import-competencies.html`
2. Login as teacher
3. Click "Import starten"
4. Tool imports 87 competency levels from `Kompetenzen-Lehrplan.csv`
5. Creates:
   - 3 competency areas
   - ~10 competency groups
   - 86-87 competency levels

**Data Source:** Official curriculum from Lehrplan Informatik & Medien

## Badge & Achievement System (NEW - 2025-12-01)

The app features a comprehensive gamification system with automatic and custom badges to motivate students.

### Badge Categories

**16 Automatic Badges** organized into 4 categories:

1. **🎯 Milestones** (General Progress)
   - 🌟 **Erste Schritte** (Common) - First competency rated
   - 🚀 **Aufsteiger** (Rare) - 10 competencies with 3+ stars
   - 💎 **Experte** (Epic) - 20 competencies with 4+ stars
   - 👑 **Meister** (Legendary) - 30 competencies with 5 stars
   - ⭐ **Fleissig** (Rare) - 50 competencies rated (any level)
   - 🎖️ **Engagiert** (Epic) - 100 competencies rated

2. **📱 Area Experts** (Competency Areas)
   - 📱 **Medien-Profi** (Rare) - 5 media competencies with 4+ stars
   - 💻 **Informatik-Held** (Rare) - 5 computer science competencies with 4+ stars
   - 🎯 **Anwendungs-Champion** (Rare) - 5 application competencies with 4+ stars

3. **⏱️ Time-based** (Usage Patterns)
   - 🎉 **Pionier** (Common) - Account created (awarded on first rating)
   - 🔥 **Durchstarter** (Rare) - Active for 7 days
   - 💪 **Beharrlich** (Epic) - Active for 30 days
   - 🏆 **Veteran** (Legendary) - Active for 365 days

4. **🌟 Special** (Custom Awards)
   - 🎓 **Vollständig** (Epic) - All competencies rated (any level)
   - ✨ **Perfektionist** (Legendary) - All competencies with 4+ stars
   - 🎨 **Custom Badges** - Unlimited teacher-created badges

### Automatic Badge Awards

**Trigger Points:**
- After each rating update: `checkAndAwardBadges()` is called
- Evaluates all 16 automatic badge criteria
- Awards badges if criteria newly met
- Prevents duplicate awards (checks existing badges)
- Shows animated notification for new badges

**Criteria Checking:**
```javascript
// Examples from checkBadgeCriteria()
case 'first-steps': return ratedCount >= 1;
case 'rising-star': return ratings3Plus >= 10;
case 'expert': return ratings4Plus >= 20;
case 'master': return ratings5 >= 30;
case 'media-pro': return mediaRatings4Plus >= 5;
```

### Badge UI Components

**1. Badge Showcase (Student Dashboard)**
- Always visible section showing earned badges
- First 3 badges displayed with full details
- "+X weitere" counter if more than 3
- "🎖️ Alle anzeigen" button opens full collection
- Animated slide-in on page load
- Empty state message if no badges yet

**2. Badge Collection Modal**
- Full-screen modal with all badges
- Tabs: "Erhalten" (Earned) and "Gesperrt" (Locked)
- Earned badges show award date and teacher (if manually awarded)
- Locked badges show criteria and progress
- Rarity indicators with colors
- Click badge for detail view

**3. Badge Detail View**
- Large badge icon with rarity color
- Complete description
- Award details (date, teacher, reason)
- Progress toward locked badges
- Close button returns to collection

**4. Badge Notifications**
- Animated toast notification
- Badge emoji + name
- "Neues Abzeichen erhalten!" message
- 5-second auto-dismiss
- Slide-in from right

### Teacher Badge Management

**Features:**
1. **View All Badges** - See automatic + custom badges
2. **Award Badge** - Manually give any badge to any student with optional reason
3. **Create Custom Badge**
   - Name, description, emoji
   - Rarity level (common/rare/epic/legendary)
   - Auto-assigned color based on rarity
4. **Delete Custom Badge** - Remove teacher-created badges

**Manual Award Process:**
```javascript
// Teacher can award any badge (auto or custom)
executeAwardBadge(studentId, badgeId, reason)
  -> awardBadge(userId, badge, teacherId, reason)
  -> Stores: awardedBy, awardedByName, reason
```

### PDF Export with Badges

**Implementation Details:**
The PDF export includes a graphical badge showcase but faced Unicode limitations:

**Problem:** jsPDF has very limited Unicode support
- Star characters (★☆) rendered as "&&&&&"
- Badge emojis rendered as "Ø<ß"
- Even `String.fromCharCode()` failed

**Solution:** Geometric drawing with jsPDF primitives
```javascript
// Star ratings: Filled/empty squares
pdfDoc.setFillColor(255, 215, 0); // Gold
pdfDoc.rect(starX, yPos - 3, 4, 4, 'F'); // Filled square

pdfDoc.setDrawColor(200, 200, 200); // Gray
pdfDoc.rect(starX, yPos - 3, 4, 4, 'D'); // Empty square

// Badge icons: Colored circles
pdfDoc.setFillColor(...borderColor); // Rarity color
pdfDoc.circle(30, yPos + 8, 5, 'F'); // Outer circle

pdfDoc.setFillColor(255, 255, 255); // White
pdfDoc.circle(30, yPos + 8, 2, 'F'); // Inner highlight
```

**PDF Badge Section:**
- "🏆 Abzeichen & Erfolge" section header
- Each badge as a row with:
  - Colored circle icon (rarity-based)
  - Badge name and description
  - Award date
  - Teacher name (if manually awarded)
- Text wrapping for long descriptions with `splitTextToSize()`
- Automatic pagination if needed

### Technical Implementation

**Global State:**
```javascript
let allBadges = []; // Combined automatic + custom badges
```

**Key Functions:**
- `loadAllBadges()` - Loads BADGE_DEFINITIONS + Firestore customBadges
- `getBadgeById(id)` - Helper to find badge in combined array
- `loadUserBadges(userId)` - Loads user's earned badges from Firestore
- `checkAndAwardBadges(userId)` - Evaluates criteria and awards new badges
- `awardBadge(userId, badge, awardedBy, reason)` - Creates userBadge document
- `renderBadgeShowcase()` - Renders dashboard badge display
- `showBadgeCollection()` - Opens modal with all badges

**Data Denormalization:**
To avoid Firestore permissions issues, the teacher name is stored directly in the badge:
```javascript
// When awarding badge, teacher has permissions to read users
const teacherDoc = await getDoc(doc(window.db, 'users', awardedBy));
badgeData.awardedByName = teacherDoc.data().name || 'Unbekannt';

// Later, students can read badge without needing users collection access
```

**Backwards Compatibility:**
Rating keys support both formats for historical data:
```javascript
// Check both "level_IB-1-1-a" and "IB-1-1-a"
const rating = ratings[levelKey] || ratings[level.id] || 0;
```

### Modal System Implementation

**CSS Architecture:**
```css
.modal-overlay {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0; left: 0;
    width: 100%; height: 100%;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
    display: none; /* Hidden by default */
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    z-index: 1000;
    backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
}

.modal-overlay.show {
    display: flex; /* Show when class added */
}
```

**JavaScript Pattern:**
```javascript
const overlay = document.createElement('div');
overlay.className = 'modal-overlay';
overlay.innerHTML = `<div class="modal-content">...</div>`;
document.body.appendChild(overlay);
setTimeout(() => overlay.classList.add('show'), 10); // Trigger animation
```

### Bug Fixes and Workarounds

**1. Variable Name Conflict (PDF Export)**
- **Problem:** `doc` variable conflicted with Firebase `doc()` function
- **Fix:** Renamed jsPDF variable to `pdfDoc`
- **Location:** `exportProgress()` function

**2. Unicode Characters in PDF**
- **Problem:** jsPDF doesn't support Unicode star/emoji characters
- **Attempted:** `String.fromCharCode()` - still failed
- **Solution:** Draw geometric shapes (rectangles, circles)

**3. Custom Badges Not Loading**
- **Problem:** Code only checked `BADGE_DEFINITIONS` array
- **Fix:** Created `allBadges` combining automatic + custom
- **Implementation:** `loadAllBadges()` merges both sources

**4. Teacher Name Permissions Error**
- **Problem:** Students can't read `/users` collection for teacher names
- **Error:** `FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions`
- **Solution:** Store `awardedByName` directly when badge is awarded
- **Benefit:** Teacher has permissions at award time, denormalized for later reads

**5. Rating Keys Format Mismatch**
- **Problem:** Old data stored as `IB-1-1-a`, new code searched `level_IB-1-1-a`
- **Symptom:** All PDF ratings showed 0/5 stars
- **Fix:** Support both formats with fallback lookup

**6. PDF Competency Sorting**
- **Problem:** Sorted by `order` property instead of LP code
- **Fix:** Alphanumeric sort with `localeCompare()`
```javascript
sortedLevels.sort((a, b) =>
  a.lpCode.localeCompare(b.lpCode, 'de', { numeric: true })
);
```

**7. Modal Overlay Invisible**
- **Problem:** `.modal-overlay` CSS completely missing
- **Symptom:** Modals created in DOM but invisible, view shifted left
- **Fix:** Added complete modal system CSS (93 lines in style.css)

### Performance Notes

- Badge checks run only after rating updates (not continuously)
- All badges loaded once and cached in `allBadges` array
- Modal HTML generated dynamically (not hidden in DOM)
- PDF generation uses single-pass rendering

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Badge editing for teachers
- Activity tracking for consecutive days badges
- Badge statistics and leaderboards per class
- Export badge collection as image
- Push notifications for new badges (PWA)
- Badge categories filtering in collection modal

## Code Architecture

### Global State
```javascript
let currentUser = null;           // Firebase user object
let userRole = null;              // 'student' or 'teacher'
let competencies = [];            // Cached competency list
let allBadges = [];               // Combined automatic + custom badges
let unsubscribeListeners = [];    // Firestore listeners to cleanup
```

### Key Functions and Patterns

#### Authentication Flow
1. `onAuthStateChanged` observer monitors auth state (line 34)
2. On login → `loadUserData()` fetches user role
3. Role-based routing:
   - Students → `showStudentArea()`
   - Teachers → `showTeacherDashboard()`

#### Data Loading Pattern
```javascript
// Real-time listeners pattern
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(docRef, (snapshot) => {
  // Update UI with new data
});
unsubscribeListeners.push(unsubscribe);  // Track for cleanup
```

#### UI Update Pattern
```javascript
// Always show loading indicator
showLoading(true);
try {
  // Perform async operation
  await someFirebaseOperation();
  showNotification('Success message', 'success');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error);
  showNotification('Error message', 'error');
} finally {
  showLoading(false);
}
```

## UI Components

### Three Main Views

1. **Login Area** (`#loginArea`)
   - Student login/registration tabs
   - Teacher login (separate)
   - Role-based authentication

2. **Student Area** (`#mainArea`)
   - Welcome message with name and class
   - Overall progress bar
   - Competency cards with star ratings
   - Export and share buttons

3. **Teacher Dashboard** (`#teacherArea`)
   - Four tabs: Competencies, Students, Classes, Reports
   - Real-time student data
   - CRUD operations for competencies and classes
   - Report generation

### UI Patterns

**Tab Switching:**
```javascript
window.switchTab = function(tabId) {
  // Hide all tabs, show selected
  // Load data specific to that tab
}
```

**Modal Pattern:**
Used in `showStudentDetails()` - Creates a fixed overlay div dynamically

**Star Rating:**
- CSS classes: `.star` and `.star.filled`
- Click handlers update rating (1-5 stars)
- Visual feedback with animations

## Styling Conventions

### Color Palette
```css
Primary: #667eea (Purple)
Secondary: #764ba2 (Dark Purple)
Success: #48bb78 (Green)
Error: #f56565 (Red)
Info: #4299e1 (Blue)
Warning: #ed8936 (Orange)
```

### Key CSS Classes
- `.hidden` - Display none (toggled via JS)
- `.loading-overlay` - Full-screen loading indicator
- `.competency-card` - Student competency display
- `.student-card` - Teacher student grid item
- `.tab-content` - Tab panel (hidden by default)
- `.btn-icon` - Small icon buttons

### Animations
- `slideIn` - Component entry animation
- `slideInRight` / `slideOutRight` - Notification animations
- `starPop` - Star rating visual feedback
- `spin` - Loading spinner rotation

## Development Workflows

### Making Changes to Competencies
1. Teachers access "Kompetenzen" tab
2. Functions: `addNewCompetency()`, `editCompetency()`, `deleteCompetency()`
3. Changes sync to all students in real-time
4. Import/Export JSON format available

### Adding New Features

**Before Adding Code:**
1. **Check if Firebase rules need updating**
   - New Firestore collection? → Add rules to `firestore.rules`
   - Changed access patterns? → Update existing rules
   - Test rules in Firebase Console Rules Playground
   - Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
   - Document changes in CLAUDE.md → Firestore Security Rules section
2. Consider real-time sync implications
3. Add loading states for async operations
4. Include error handling with user notifications
5. Test with both student and teacher roles

**Pattern to Follow:**
```javascript
window.myNewFeature = async function() {
  showLoading(true);
  try {
    // Your logic here
    await firebaseOperation();
    showNotification('Erfolg!', 'success');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Fehler:', error);
    showNotification('Fehler: ' + error.message, 'error');
  } finally {
    showLoading(false);
  }
};
```

### Testing Considerations

**Test Both Roles:**
- Student view: Rating updates, PDF export, UI responsiveness
- Teacher view: All CRUD operations, real-time updates, reports

**Browser Testing:**
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive breakpoints (@media max-width: 600px)
- IndexedDB/LocalStorage for Firebase

### Deployment

**Static Hosting Steps:**
1. No build process required
2. Upload all 4 files to hosting
3. Ensure Firebase config is correct
4. Verify CORS settings for Firebase
5. Test authentication flow

**GitHub Pages:**
- Currently configured with `authDomain: "https://baenni-coder.github.io/"`
- Files can be deployed directly

### Student Management Workflows (NEW - 2025-11-30)

#### Bulk Student Creation
1. Teacher navigates to **Schüler** tab
2. Click "➕ Mehrere Schüler anlegen" button
3. Select target class from dropdown
4. Enter student names (one per line)
5. Configure email domain (e.g., `schule.example.com`)
6. Click "✨ Schüler-Accounts erstellen"
7. System generates:
   - Email addresses (`vorname.nachname@domain`)
   - Secure passwords (10 characters, readable)
   - Firebase Auth accounts
   - Firestore user documents
   - Empty progress documents
8. **Printable credentials overview** is displayed automatically
9. Teacher can print or save as PDF

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses **secondary Firebase App instance** to avoid auth conflicts
- `initializeApp(config, 'Secondary')` creates isolated auth context
- Primary teacher auth remains active throughout process
- Secondary app is deleted after completion
- Prevents "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors

**Password Generation:**
- Uses `crypto.getRandomValues()` for cryptographic security
- Character set: `a-z, A-Z, 2-9` (excludes confusing chars like 0/O, 1/l/I)
- Default length: 10 characters
- Example: `a7XmN5pqRt`

**Email Generation:**
- Converts name to lowercase
- Replaces umlauts (ä→ae, ö→oe, ü→ue, ß→ss)
- Removes special characters
- Joins name parts with dots
- Example: "Max Müller" → `max.mueller@schule.example.com`

#### Student Deletion
1. Teacher clicks student in **Schüler** tab
2. Student details modal opens
3. Click red "🗑️ Löschen" button
4. Confirm deletion warning (explains consequences)
5. System deletes:
   - User document (`/users/{uid}`)
   - Progress document (`/progress/{uid}`)
   - All artifacts (`/artifacts` where `userId == uid`)
   - Storage files for artifacts
6. Modal closes automatically
7. Student list refreshes

**Important Notes:**
- Firebase Auth account is NOT deleted (requires admin SDK/Cloud Functions)
- Deletion is irreversible
- All student data is permanently removed
- Storage files are deleted individually with error handling

#### Credentials Overview Features
**Display:**
- App URL (auto-detected)
- Table with: #, Name, Email, Password
- Styled for printing
- Warning about password visibility

**Actions:**
- 🖨️ Print directly (browser print dialog)
- 📄 Save as PDF (via html2pdf.js)
- Close modal

**Security Note:**
Passwords are only shown once during creation. They cannot be retrieved later.

#### Bulk Star Rating for Classes (NEW - 2025-11-30)
Teachers can assign star ratings to multiple students at once through the **Klassen** tab.

**Workflow:**
1. Teacher navigates to **Klassen** tab
2. Click the green **⭐** button on a class card
3. **Bulk-Rating Dialog** opens with three steps:

   **Step 1: Select Students**
   - Individual checkboxes for each student
   - "✅ Alle auswählen" / "⬜ Keine auswählen" buttons
   - Live counter shows selected students
   - Students sorted alphabetically

   **Step 2: Choose Competency/Indicator**
   - 🔍 Search field to filter competencies
   - Hierarchical dropdown with:
     - Competency Areas (📱 Medien, 💻 Informatik, 🎯 Anwendungskompetenzen)
     - Competency Groups
     - Competency Levels (e.g., "IB.1.1.a - Description")
     - Indicators (indented under levels: "└─ Ich kann...")
   - Automatically filtered by class grade level
   - Selected competency preview shown below

   **Step 3: Assign Stars**
   - Interactive 5-star rating selector
   - Hover effects on stars
   - Current rating displayed ("X Sterne")

4. **Live Preview** shows: "X Schüler(n) werden Y Sterne zugewiesen"
5. **"✅ Bewertungen zuweisen"** button (enabled when all selections complete)
6. **Confirmation dialog** with details and warning about overwriting
7. **Batch update** to Firestore (sequential for error handling)
8. **Success notification** with count or partial success warning
9. Dialog auto-closes on success

**Technical Details:**
- **Overwrites existing ratings** (does not add/increment)
- Supports both **competency levels** (e.g., `level_IB-1-1-a`) and **indicators** (e.g., `indicator_xyz123`)
- Uses `setDoc()` with `merge: true` for safe updates
- Individual error handling per student (continues on failure)
- No Firebase batch writes (sequential for better error reporting)
- Grade-level filtering matches class's assigned grade
- Search function filters by LP code and description text

**Key Functions:**
- `showClassBulkRating(classId, className)` - Opens modal
- `loadCompetencyOptionsForBulkRating(gradeFilter)` - Loads hierarchical competencies
- `updateBulkRatingPreview()` - Updates live preview and enables/disables button
- `executeBulkRating()` - Performs batch updates
- `updateStudentRating(studentId, competencyKey, rating)` - Updates single student

**Use Cases:**
- After teaching a topic (e.g., "Cybermobbing"), assign 3 stars to all students
- Assign baseline competencies to a new class
- Update multiple students who passed a specific assessment
- Quick progress updates after group activities

**Limitations:**
- One competency per operation (for clarity and teacher control)
- Sequential updates (not parallel) for error tracking
- No "add stars" mode, only "set stars"
- Cannot bulk-assign multiple competencies at once

## Common Tasks for AI Assistants

### Adding a New Competency Field
1. Update Firestore schema in `competencies` collection
2. Modify `createDefaultCompetencies()` function
3. Update `loadCompetencyManager()` UI rendering
4. Update `addNewCompetency()` to include new field
5. Update import/export functions

### Adding a New Report Type
1. Add option to `#reportType` select in index.html
2. Create new `generate[Type]Report()` function
3. Call from `generateReport()` switch/if statement
4. Follow existing HTML generation pattern

### Modifying Student Dashboard
1. Student UI rendered in `renderStudentCompetencies()`
2. Real-time updates via `onSnapshot` listener
3. Star rating handlers in event listeners (line 319)

### Adding Admin Features
1. Create new user role check in `loadUserData()`
2. Add new UI area (like teacherArea)
3. Protect Firebase operations with role checks

## Security Best Practices

### Current Implementation
- Role stored in Firestore `users` collection
- Role checked on teacher login (line 141)
- Client-side role enforcement only

### Recommendations for Production
⚠️ **Critical:** Client-side security is not sufficient!

**Required for Production:**
1. Implement Firestore Security Rules based on user roles
2. Use Firebase Functions for sensitive operations
3. Validate all inputs server-side
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Add email verification for registration

**Example Rule Pattern:**
```javascript
// Allow students to only modify their own progress
match /progress/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId
                     && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(userId)).data.role == 'student';
}
```

## Internationalization Notes

Currently hardcoded to German:
- All UI strings in German
- Comments in German
- No i18n framework

**To Add English:**
1. Create translation object/file
2. Replace hardcoded strings with keys
3. Add language toggle
4. Store preference in localStorage or user profile

## Performance Considerations

### Current Optimizations
- Competencies cached in memory after first load
- Real-time listeners prevent polling
- CSS animations hardware-accelerated

### Potential Improvements
- Lazy load jsPDF (only when exporting)
- Paginate student lists for large classes
- Debounce search/filter inputs
- Cache student progress data
- Use Firestore query limits

## Error Handling

### Auth Errors
Handled in `handleAuthError()` (line 1447):
- User not found
- Wrong password
- Email in use
- Invalid email

### Firestore Errors
Generally caught and logged with user notification:
```javascript
showNotification('Fehler beim Laden!', 'error');
```

### Missing Robustness
- No offline handling
- No retry logic
- No conflict resolution for concurrent edits

## Browser Compatibility

**Requirements:**
- ES6 module support
- Fetch API
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- LocalStorage

**Minimum Versions:**
- Chrome 61+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

## Git Workflow

### Commit Patterns (from history)
- Most commits: "Update app-firebase.js" or "Update index.html"
- No conventional commits pattern
- Direct commits to main branch

### Recommended for AI Assistants
When making changes:
1. Create feature branch: `claude/feature-name-sessionid`
2. Make focused, atomic commits
3. Use descriptive commit messages (what changed and why)
4. Push to remote feature branch
5. Create PR when ready

## Known Limitations

1. **No offline support** - Requires internet connection
2. **No teacher account management** - Teachers can't be created from UI (requires Firebase Console)
3. **Limited report customization** - Fixed formats only
4. **Auth account deletion** - Firebase Auth accounts not deleted when student is removed (requires Cloud Functions)

- **CSV import** for student lists (in addition to bulk text input)
- **Custom competency templates** for teachers to create own skill sets
- **Multi-language support** (i18n framework integration)
- **Dark mode toggle** for better accessibility
- **Enhanced reports** with date range filters, export formats (Excel, CSV)
- **Cloud Functions** for complete user deletion including Firebase Auth
- **Badge editing** functionality for teachers (currently: create/delete only)
- **Activity tracking** for advanced time-based badges (consecutive days, yearly reviews)
- **Badge statistics** and leaderboards per class
- **Competency goals** - Teachers set target ratings, students see progress toward goals
- **Notification system** - Push notifications for badge awards, teacher comments
- **Offline mode** - Progressive Web App with service worker

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Firebase Debug Mode
```javascript
// Add to console
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'firestore:*');
```

### Common Issues

**Students can't see competencies:**
- Check `loadCompetencies()` was called
- Verify Firestore connection
- Check browser console for errors

**Ratings not saving:**
- Verify user is authenticated (`currentUser` not null)
- Check Firestore rules allow write
- Look for errors in `updateRating()` function

**Teacher dashboard empty:**
- Verify role is 'teacher' in Firestore
- Check collections exist in Firestore
- Verify real-time listeners setup

## Quick Start for AI Assistants

1. **Understand the role system**: Student vs Teacher - different UIs and permissions
2. **Follow the async pattern**: Always use showLoading() and try/catch
3. **Real-time is key**: Use onSnapshot for data that changes
4. **German language**: UI strings and comments are in German
5. **No build step**: Changes to files are immediately reflected
6. **Test both roles**: Create both student and teacher accounts
7. **Firebase first**: All data operations go through Firestore

**Most Common Request**: "Add new competency field" or "Modify student dashboard"
**Most Complex Part**: Teacher reports with real-time aggregation
**Most Fragile Part**: Role-based access (client-side only currently)

When in doubt, check how existing similar features are implemented. The codebase is consistent in its patterns.
