# Smriti — Development Guide

## What is this?

An offline-first desktop photo library manager. Rust engine (services, DB, ML) wrapped in a Tauri 2 shell with a Svelte 5 frontend. Uses `rusqlite` (SQLite) and `ort` (ONNX Runtime for face detection/recognition). Indexes photos from external drives, extracts EXIF metadata, detects faces, clusters them, finds duplicates/bursts, and provides geocoding.

## Architecture

- **`src/`** — pure Rust library: services, DB, ML, models, search, scoring, config. No UI. Re-exported via `src/lib.rs`.
- **`src-tauri/`** — Tauri 2 bin crate. Wraps the engine in `#[tauri::command]` handlers per the contract in `docs/COMMAND_SURFACE.md`.
- **`src-ui/`** — Vite + Svelte 5 frontend. Talks to the backend via Tauri IPC.

The iced UI was removed in 2026-05; the engine is the same.

## Cross-Platform Development (WSL + Windows)

This project targets **both Linux and Windows** from a single codebase. Development uses a single-instance model from WSL.

### How it works

```
Code lives in WSL (single source of truth):
  /home/virinchi/code/rust/photovault

Windows accesses it via UNC path:
  \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-24.04\home\virinchi\code\rust\photovault
```

- **One Claude instance (WSL)** makes all code changes
- **One git repo** — all commits happen from WSL
- Each platform has its own native Rust toolchain — no cross-compilation
- File changes are instantly visible to both sides (same filesystem)

### Who does what

| Action | Where | Who |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Code edits | WSL | Claude (this instance) |
| Git operations | WSL | Claude (this instance) |
| Linux build + test | WSL terminal | Claude / user |
| Windows build + test | PowerShell | User runs `cargo build && cargo run` |
| Later: standalone Linux | Clone the repo | Same code, works as-is |

### PowerShell — How to build & test Windows

```powershell
cd \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-24.04\home\virinchi\code\rust\photovault

cargo build              # debug build
cargo build --release    # release build
cargo run                # run
cargo test               # tests
```

Note: Windows `cargo build` on the UNC path is slower (~2-3x) due to the WSL filesystem bridge. This is fine for periodic Windows smoke tests — primary development happens in WSL.

The `target/` directory has separate artifacts per platform. Windows = `smriti.exe`, Linux = `smriti`. They do NOT conflict.

### Windows Setup (one-time)

1. **Rust toolchain**: `winget install Rustlang.Rustup` (restart terminal after)
2. **Visual Studio Build Tools**: install "Desktop development with C++" workload (provides MSVC linker)
3. **Assets**: from PowerShell in the project dir, run:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup_assets.ps1
   ```
   This downloads `onnxruntime.dll`, ONNX face models, and GeoNames data.

### Linux Setup (one-time)

```bash
./scripts/setup_assets.sh
```

## Platform-Specific Code

Only two files have `#[cfg]` gates:

- **`src/services/drive_detector.rs`** — drive enumeration (Linux: /media, /mnt; Windows: drive letters A-Z; macOS: /Volumes)
- **`src/ml/runtime.rs`** — ONNX Runtime library name (`libonnxruntime.so` on Linux, `onnxruntime.dll` on Windows)

Everything else is platform-agnostic.

### ONNX Runtime

The `ort` crate uses `load-dynamic` — the shared library is loaded at runtime via dlopen/LoadLibrary.

| Platform | Library file | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Linux | `libonnxruntime.so` | `libs/onnxruntime/` |
| Windows | `onnxruntime.dll` | `libs/onnxruntime/` |

Resolution order (both platforms):
1. `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` env var
2. `libs/onnxruntime/` relative to executable
3. `libs/onnxruntime/` relative to CWD

### Asset Scripts

| Platform | Script | Downloads |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Linux | `scripts/setup_assets.sh` | `libonnxruntime.so` (Linux x64), ONNX models, GeoNames |
| Windows | `scripts/setup_assets.ps1` | `onnxruntime.dll` (Win x64), ONNX models, GeoNames |

Both are idempotent — skip files that already exist.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Engine + Tauri shell (debug)
cargo build -p smriti -p smriti-tauri

# Frontend (one-time + on every change for production builds)
cd src-ui && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Run dev (opens native window with HMR via Vite)
cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2" --locked   # one-time

# Use the wrapper, NOT `cargo tauri dev` directly. The wrapper passes
# `--no-watch`, which is the only thing that stops tauri-cli 2.11's
# dev watcher from rebuilding the binary on every SQLite WAL/SHM
# tick, every doc save, every script touch. Vite HMR still handles
# the frontend; Rust changes need a Ctrl+C + restart.
scripts\dev.ps1     # Windows PowerShell
scripts/dev.sh      # Linux / macOS

# Production bundle (.deb/AppImage on Linux, .msi on Windows, .dmg on macOS)
cargo tauri build

# Tests
cargo test -p smriti
cargo test -p smriti-tauri

# Lint gate (required before any push)
cargo clippy --all-targets -p smriti -p smriti-tauri
