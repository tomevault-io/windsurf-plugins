**Writing Code Protocol**

- Place mock, test and implementation exactly near intent file.
- Export files from its folders using barrel file (ui/ui.dart, commands/commands.dart etc.).
- To find implementation, try to load intents first.
- Do not rely on strings, use enums.
- Use context.read/context.select to subscribe to observable state in build methods.
- If you create new file, make sure to check its intent. If it doesn't have an intent - create it.
- Use EquatableMixin for classes.
