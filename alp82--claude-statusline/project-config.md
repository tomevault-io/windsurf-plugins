# claude-statusline

A single-file Bash statusline for Claude Code (`statusline.sh`).

`remotion/` is a separate npm sub-project (React + Remotion, `node_modules` gitignored) that rebuilds the statusline as an animatable terminal mockup for the landing page and README. `statusline.sh` is the source of truth for its palette, thresholds and bar geometry — change one, change the other.

The annotation over a bar — the racers named, the gap read out, the effort row — is drawn twice: by `annotate()` in `docs/index.html` and by `remotion/src/statusline/Annotation.tsx`. The page measures the painted bar, the render computes it from `theme.ts`, and both carry the same pixel constants. Change one, change the other.
