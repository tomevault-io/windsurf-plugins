# Project Notes

## Build / Run
All app code is Rust; the cargo workspace lives in `src/` and produces the `jellium-desktop` binary. Everything is driven through `just` — recipes are OS-gated via `[macos]`/`[linux]`/`[windows]` attributes, so the same command works everywhere:
```
just deps      # one-time: submodules, CEF download, macOS brew packages
just build     # build + stage a runnable tree in build/ (+ .app bundle on macOS)
just test      # run the workspace test suite (depends on build)
just run       # run with debug logging → logs to build/run.log
just run-mpv   # run the bundled mpv CLI directly (mpv-only debugging)
just clean     # remove build/ and dist/, cargo clean
just fmt        # format the workspace (cargo fmt)
just fmt-check  # check formatting without writing
just clippy     # clippy with -D warnings + unwrap/expect/panic denies
just lint       # fmt-check + clippy
just strict-lint # lint + clippy pedantic/nursery
just appimage build # [linux] build AppImage
just flatpak build  # [linux] build Flatpak bundle
just dmg            # [macos] build Apple Disk Image (.dmg)
```
Platform-specific entry points live in `dev/linux/`, `dev/macos/`, `dev/windows/`, imported by the top-level justfile.

## Before Committing
Run `just fmt` and `just lint` before every commit; both must pass clean (lint runs `fmt-check` + `clippy`, and CI rejects unformatted or lint-failing code).

## Architecture
- **CEF** (Chromium Embedded Framework) — hosts jellyfin-web as an embedded browser; handles JS-to-Rust IPC for player control commands and renders the UI as an overlay texture above the video layer. Multi-process: browser process (main app, owns CefBrowser), renderer process (V8/Blink), GPU process. IPC via `CefProcessMessage`. Bindings via `cef-dll-sys`; project glue lives in `src/jfn_cef`.
- **mpv** (fork in `third_party/mpv`) — video playback; the desktop client injects native shims to override browser media playback. mpv owns its own window + GPU; libmpv is used only for the control plane (properties/commands/events).
- Wayland subsurface for video layer (Linux). Platform crates: `src/macos`, `src/windows`, plus Wayland/X11 paths under `src/`.

## mpv Integration
- **Never call sync mpv API (`mpv_get_property`, etc.) from event callbacks** - causes deadlock during video init. Use property observation or async variants instead.

## mpv Event Flow
mpv is the authoritative source of playback state. All state (position, speed, pause, seeking, etc.) flows from mpv property observations outward to the JS UI and OS media sessions. The JS UI and MPRIS/macOS media sessions are consumers — they never determine playback state, they only reflect what mpv reports. This means things like rate changes, seek completion, and position updates come from mpv, not from JS round-trips or manual bookkeeping.
