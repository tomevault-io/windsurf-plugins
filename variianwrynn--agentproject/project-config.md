# Claude Code Context Management Rules
# Project: AgentProject — AI Agent Engineering Course (Varian, Uni Melbourne)
# These rules apply whenever the user executes /compact

## AGENT WORKFLOW REFERENCE

Read `AGENT_CONTEXT.md` for the full development workflow guide, including:
- How to fill checkpoints after test runs
- How to document bugs using `scripts/extract-troubleshooting.sh`
- End-of-week resume data export procedure

---

## ALWAYS PRESERVE (never compress or delete)

### Test Results
- Final test commands and their complete outputs
- Performance metrics with exact numbers (response time ms, accuracy %, token count)
- Before/after comparisons (baseline → optimized with % improvement)
- Benchmark tables comparing modules or configurations

### API & Interface Contracts
- Function signatures with parameter types and return shapes
  - `query(text: str, top_k: int = 5) -> list[dict]` (RAG)
  - `run(question: str, session_id: str) -> AgentState` (LangGraph)
  - `text2sql_tool(question: str) -> str` (Text2SQL)
- AgentState schema: question, intent, plan, steps_executed, reflection, confidence, final_answer, iteration, session_id
- Redis key patterns: `react:{sid}:*` (TTL 3600s), `langgraph:{sid}:summary` (TTL 7200s)
- Config thresholds: score threshold 0.45, confidence threshold 0.7, max_iterations 3

### Key Technical Decisions
- Architecture choices with rationale (e.g., "chose IVF_FLAT over HNSW because...")
- Model/library selection decisions with comparison data
- Tradeoff analysis (recall vs. latency, accuracy vs. cost)

### Troubleshooting Content (CRITICAL — see extraction rule below)
- Complete bug lifecycle: problem description → initial hypothesis → ALL attempted solutions (including failed ones) → final solution → lessons learned
- Failed attempts with explanation of WHY they failed
- Optimization iterations with concrete data at each step
- Format: "Method X: baseline 0.58 → attempt1 0.71 → attempt2 0.82 (3 iterations, +41%)"

### Skill Tool Call Parameters
- Complete parameters for `agent-resume-builder` skill invocations
- Complete parameters for `rag-viz` skill invocations
- Any structured data sent to Claude Chat for resume generation

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING EXTRACTION RULE

When compacting, if troubleshooting content exists in the conversation:
1. Extract each bug/issue to `[project-root]/docs/troubleshooting-log/issue-YYYYMMDD-NNN.md`
2. Use the template in `[project-root]/docs/troubleshooting-log/README.md`
3. Replace the full troubleshooting content in conversation with:
   `[Extracted to docs/troubleshooting-log/issue-YYYYMMDD-NNN.md — Issue: <brief title>]`
4. NEVER delete troubleshooting content without extracting it first

---

## CHECKPOINT REFERENCE RULE

When compacting:
- Keep checkpoint file references: `[Day N checkpoint: docs/checkpoints/dayN-checkpoint.md]`
- Keep one-line module status summary from the checkpoint
- Delete detailed content already captured in the checkpoint file

---

## SUMMARIZE AGGRESSIVELY (compress to one line)

- Environment setup: "Installed: milvus-lite==2.4.0, pymilvus==2.4.x, langchain==0.1.x, redis==5.x"
- Docker infrastructure: "Docker stack: etcd + MinIO + Milvus(19530) + Redis(6379) running"
- Technical research process: "Compared X/Y/Z, chose X for [reason]"
- Dependency resolution: "Fixed [package] version conflict: pinned to [version]"
- Code refactoring: "Refactored [module]: [before summary] → [after summary], kept API contract unchanged"
- Repeated successful operations with no variance

---

## DELETE COMPLETELY

- Successful routine file I/O (reading files, loading models with no issues)
- Module imports and environment verification that succeeded without errors
- Duplicate debugging loops — keep ONLY the final working version
  - EXCEPTION: if a failed loop has learning value, move to troubleshooting log, then delete
- One-time print/debug statements used for ad-hoc verification
- Repeated tool invocations with identical parameters and expected results
- Version/package listing output (pip list, conda list) unless a version caused a bug
- Generic LLM responses that don't contain project-specific decisions

---

## MODULE CONTEXT (quick reference after /compact)

### RAG Pipeline (rag_pipeline.py)
- Embedding: BAAI/bge-m3 (1024-dim), Milvus IVF_FLAT/COSINE
- Chunking: ParagraphChunker, 512 tokens, 50-token overlap, SHA-256 dedup
- Retrieval: top-5, score threshold 0.45
- Files: rag_pipeline.py, ingest_files.py, test_rag.py

### ReAct Engine (react_engine.py)
- Redis memory: `react:{sid}:question/plan/steps`, TTL 3600s
- Tools: rag_search, doc_summary, web_search (DuckDuckGo, max 5)
- LLM: OpenAI-compatible wrapper (MiniMax-M2.5 default)
- Files: react_engine.py

### Text2SQL (tools/text2sql_tool.py)
- Pipeline: ambiguity detection → SQL generation → summarization
- Schema: sales(id,product,region,amount,sale_date) + products(id,name,category,unit_price)
- term_dict: Chinese business terms → SQL (e.g., "营收"→"SUM(amount)")
- Files: tools/text2sql_tool.py, data/schema_metadata.json, data/sales.db

### LangGraph Agent (langgraph_agent.py)
- Nodes: Router → Planner → Executor → Reflector ↔ Critic
- Intent types: data_query, analysis, research, general
