# AI Agent Session Center: Agent Guidance

This file is the durable coding-agent entrypoint for this repository. It is
based on `CLAUDE.md`; read `CLAUDE.md` for the full architecture notes and keep
the two files aligned when project guidance changes.

## Project Snapshot

AI Agent Session Center is a localhost dashboard on port 3333 for monitoring AI
coding agent sessions from Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, and related tools. It
uses hooks to ingest session events, visualizes sessions as 3D robots, supports
SSH terminals, team/subagent tracking, prompt queuing, workspace snapshots, and
session resume.

Core stack:

- Backend: Node.js 18+, ESM, Express 5, ws 8, tsx
- Frontend: React 19, Three.js / `@react-three/fiber`, Zustand 5, Vite 7
- Desktop: Electron 34, electron-builder 25
- Terminal: `node-pty` through Electron IPC, WebSocket fallback in browser
- Hooks: Bash hook script with JSONL file queue and HTTP POST fallback
- Persistence: SQLite / `better-sqlite3` on the server, IndexedDB / Dexie in the
  browser

## Common Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Vite + tsx watch
npm run build            # Production build
npm start                # Start production server
npm test                 # Vitest
npm run test:e2e         # Playwright E2E
npm run test:coverage    # Coverage report
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint             # ESLint src/
npm run format           # Prettier
npm run electron:dev     # Build and launch Electron app
npm run electron:build   # Build distributables
npm run install-hooks    # Install CLI hooks
npm run uninstall-hooks  # Remove dashboard hooks
npm run setup            # Interactive setup wizard
npm run reset            # Remove hooks, clean config, backup
```

Use the smallest verification command that fits the change. For shared contracts,
state shape, server routes, Electron IPC, terminal behavior, or feature-doc work,
prefer at least `npm run typecheck` plus any targeted tests that cover the touched
area.

## Feature Documentation Workflow

All feature logic is documented under `docs/feature/`. Before implementing a new
feature or modifying an existing one:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` to identify the affected feature domain.
2. Read the corresponding doc(s) in `docs/feature/`.
3. Check the impact matrix in `CLAUDE.md` for connected features.
4. Read connected feature docs before changing shared behavior.
5. After the code change, update every affected feature doc.

`docs/feature/.manifest.json` is machine-readable source of truth for file to
doc mappings, symbols, and last-aligned timestamps. Do not hand-edit it. If it
drifts, run the feature-doc alignment workflow rather than patching the manifest
manually.

Feature-doc domains:

- `docs/feature/server/`: hooks, sessions, matching, approvals, WebSocket, API,
  database, terminal/SSH, teams, process monitoring, auth, file index cache, and
  floating session spawning
- `docs/feature/frontend/`: Zustand state, persistence, WebSocket client,
  session detail, conversation/file/terminal/queue/review views, settings,
  shortcuts, command autocomplete, workspace snapshots, setup, auth UI, project
  browser, floating terminals, creation modals, and UI primitives
- `docs/feature/3d/`: cyberdrome scene, robot system, particles/effects
- `docs/feature/multimedia/`: sound/alarm and TTS voice output
- `docs/feature/electron/`: app lifecycle, PTY host, and IPC transport

## Architecture Notes

Event flow:

```text
AI CLI
  -> hooks/dashboard-hook.sh
  -> /tmp/claude-session-center/queue.jsonl
  -> server/mqReader.ts
  -> server/hookProcessor.ts
  -> server/sessionStore.ts
  -> server/wsManager.ts
  -> browser Zustand stores and React render
```

Important server areas:

- `server/index.ts`: orchestration and startup
- `server/apiRouter.ts`: REST API surface
- `server/mqReader.ts`, `server/hookProcessor.ts`, `server/hookRouter.ts`: hook
  ingestion and routing
- `server/sessionStore.ts` and helpers: session state, matching, titles,
  approvals, teams, liveness, and auto-idle
- `server/wsManager.ts`: WebSocket broadcast and terminal relay
- `server/sshManager.ts`: SSH/PTY terminal management
- `server/db.ts`: SQLite storage
- `server/authManager.ts`: password auth and tokens
- `server/floatingSessionSpawner.ts`, `server/floatingPrompt.ts`,
  `server/extractPreviousAnswer.ts`: floating/forked session support

Important frontend areas:

- `src/stores/`: Zustand state stores for session, settings, queue, room,
  camera, UI, WebSocket, agenda, shortcuts, and floating sessions
- `src/hooks/`: WebSocket, terminal, sound, auth, shortcuts, settings init,
  workspace auto-save/load, queue scheduler, selection popup, and outside-click
  behavior
- `src/lib/`: client transport, IndexedDB, audio, workspace snapshots, CLI
  detection, scene utilities, file system provider, formatting, shortcuts,
  transcript, queue scheduling, history export, command suggestions, and TTS
- `src/components/3d/`: scene, robots, labels, particles, camera, overlays, and
  3D state display
- `src/components/session/`: detail panel, tabs, conversation, project/file
  browser, floating panels, queue/history, notes, summaries, linkified text,
  dialogs, TeX/image viewers
