Read AGENTS.md first. It has the full developer-facing instructions for this Next.js codebase.

This repo is the open-source Agentic OS Console — a Next.js 15 web app that runs locally and talks to Hermes Agent. Audience for the product itself is solo founders; this file is for AI assistants helping develop the codebase.

Strict voice rules across all code, copy, comments, and skill files:
- USE: leverage, own, compete, coordination overhead, second brain, pipeline, runway
- AVOID: productivity, efficient, automate, seamless, AI workforce, AI company, founding cohort, em-dash abuse, hedging language

Don't:
- Add a chat surface to the Next.js app (Hermes already has chat)
- Use paid search APIs (Tavily, Perplexity, Bing) — use lib/search.ts (ddgr → gogcli → browser)
- Add paid-tier feature flags or upsell prompts
- Push to git remote without user consent
- Anthropomorphize with named character agents (persona system is user-customizable)

See AGENTS.md for full conventions.
