# Wasp General Guidelines

**Description**: General Wasp configuration and setup guidelines

## Configuration

- Roke uses the standard Wasp configuration approach with `main.wasp`

## Rules

- Wasp is on ^0.16.x
- Don't remove existing configuration in main.wasp unless specifically requested
- When adding new routes, pages, actions, or queries, ensure you also create the
  corresponding implementation files
- Follow proper import patterns for Wasp entities and functions (see imports.md)
