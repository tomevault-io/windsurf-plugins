# Documentation
- After updating or renaming files make sure READMe.md file is up to date.

# Project Conventions

## Koin
 -  Use this syntax to bind interface to concrete type`singleOf(::ForecastRepositoryImpl) bind 
 ForecastRepository::class`

## Build scripts

- Make sure build scripts in modules are aligned.
- Move as much logic as possible to Gradle convention plugins.

## Architecture

- Clean Architecture is used as a base for the project. The project is divided into three layers:
  - `Domain`
  - `Data`
  - `Presentation` 

## Data Layer

- Responsible for data management, including repositories and data sources.
- represented by the `data` package

### Models

- Stores data models in `model` package

### Repositories

- Stores repository implementations in `repository` package
- Class implementing the `Repository` interface should have `Impl` suffix. e.g. `ForecastRepositoryImpl`

### Network Models

- Classes used for network requests and responses use a `Model` suffix: `...RequestModel`, `...ResponseModel`
  (e.g. `ForecastRequestModel`, `ForecastResponseModel`).

## Domain Layer
- 
- Contains business logic and domain data models.
- represented by the `domain` package

### Models

- Stores domain models in `model` package

### Repositories

- Stores repository interfaces in `repository` package
- Interface names should have `Repository` suffix e.g. `ForecastRepository`

### Use Cases

- Stores use cases in `usecase` package


## Presentation Layer

- Handles UI logic and user interactions
- represented by the `presentation` package

### ViewModel
- Every method that is called from the UI should have `on` prefix. e.g. `onButtonClick()`.

## UI

A feature's native UI sits next to its shared logic, in the feature module, not in the app modules. The app
modules only wire things together:

```
feature/forecast/src/
├── commonMain/kotlin/…/presentation/   ViewModels, state (shared)
├── androidMain/kotlin/…/presentation/  Jetpack Compose screens and components
└── iosMain/swift/presentation/         SwiftUI screens and components
```

- Swift can't be compiled by Gradle, so the files are compiled by the Xcode app target through a
  synchronized folder e.g `forecast` in `iosApp.xcodeproj`, pointing at `feature/forecast/src/iosMain/swift`). New files
  there are picked up automatically.

## Common

### Platform-specific Files Use A Platform Suffix
- Use a platform suffix (Pattern: `<Name>.<platform>.kt`); The base name stays platform-agnostic 
  - Shared code: `MyFile.kt`
  - iOS code: `MyFile.ios.kt`
  - Android code: `MyFile.android.kt`
- Never embed the platform in the name (❌ `MyFileIos.kt`).
