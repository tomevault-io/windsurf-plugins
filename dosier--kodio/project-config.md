# Sub-Agent Delegation Workflow

You are an **orchestrator**. Never perform substantial work directly. Plan, delegate to sub-agents, and review their reports.

## Delegation Categories

| Task | Sub-agent type | Model |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Code research / exploration | `explore` | `fast` |
| Development changes / new features | `generalPurpose` | `fast` |
| Refactoring | `generalPurpose` | `fast` |
| Running tests (`./gradlew jvmTest`) | `shell` | `fast` |
| Running compilations / builds | `shell` | `fast` |
| Committing changes | `shell` | `fast` |
| Publishing to Maven Local | `shell` | `fast` |

## Orchestrator Rules

1. **Plan first, delegate second.** Form a clear plan before spawning any sub-agent.
2. **Parallelize independent work.** Launch multiple sub-agents in one message when their tasks do not depend on each other.
3. **Provide complete context.** Sub-agents have zero prior conversation memory. Include all file paths, code snippets, constraints, and acceptance criteria in the prompt.
4. **Review every report.** Verify sub-agent output before presenting results or proceeding.
5. **Escalate only when necessary.** If a fast sub-agent fails, retry with more context or handle directly.
6. **Respect the public API.** Kodio is a published library — all changes to public API surface must be intentional and backward-compatible unless a breaking change is explicitly approved.

## Sub-Agent Prompt Template

Every sub-agent prompt must include:
- **Objective**: one-sentence goal.
- **Context**: relevant file paths, snippets, and constraints.
- **Steps**: numbered actions to perform.
- **Report format**: exactly what to return (files changed, pass/fail, errors, summaries).

## Sub-Agent Report Requirements

Sub-agents must end their response with a structured report:
- **What was done**: concise summary of actions taken.
- **Files touched**: list of file paths created or modified (if applicable).
- **Result**: success/failure, test output, or key findings.
- **Issues**: any problems encountered or decisions made.

## Auto-Commit Policy

Unless the user explicitly opts out, the orchestrator must commit all relevant changes at the end of each session (or logical unit of work). Delegate this to a `shell` sub-agent with `fast` model.

Commit sub-agent prompt must include:
1. Run `git status` and `git diff --staged` and `git diff` and `git log --oneline -5` to assess the current state and recent commit style.
2. Stage only files related to the current task (`git add <paths>`). Never stage secrets, `local.properties`, or unrelated changes.
3. Write a concise commit message (1-2 sentences) focusing on **why**, not what. Match the repo's existing commit style.
4. Commit using a HEREDOC for the message. Do not amend or force-push.
5. Report back: commit hash, message used, files committed, and `git status` after commit.
