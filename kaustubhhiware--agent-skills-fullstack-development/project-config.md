# Quality Guardrails

- Before any repository edit task, load `skills/mistake-memory-guardrails/SKILL.md`.
- Read `AGENT_MISTAKES.md` before proposing or applying edits.
- If a known pattern appears, revise until compliant before finalizing.
- Record every detected mistake occurrence in `AGENT_MISTAKES.md` using dedupe/update rules.
- For Frontend, DO NOT use Tailwind.
- Do not use magic values for colors. You MUST use colors defined in [frontend/app/globals.css)](frontend/app/globals.css). You CANNOT use color-mix either. Use `bg-page` instead of `white`.
