# Layout Quality Rules

Before coding a UI screen, produce:

- Objective
- User workflow
- Information architecture
- Component tree
- Data contract
- State model
- Layout grid
- Responsive behavior
- Empty / loading / error states
- Acceptance checklist

## UI quality constraints

- No placeholder-only UI.
- No fake data unless explicitly marked as mock.
- No giant component over 250 lines.
- No inline business logic in JSX.
- No magic strings for statuses — use typed status enums.
- Use stable spacing scale (Tailwind spacing tokens).
- Every primary action must have disabled / loading / error behavior.
