This repository contains the Go Conference 2026 workshop materials for Go探無比 (gotan). Apply these rules when creating or editing scenarios.

## File Layout

- Store each scenario at `<category>/<difficulty>/<topic>/README.md`; use one directory per scenario.
- Categories: `01-packages`, `02-features`, `03-cmd-tools`, `04-deep-dive`.
- Difficulties: `01-beginner`, `02-intermediate`, `03-advanced`.
- Use a descriptive English kebab-case topic name, such as `fmt-printf` or `slog-handler`; do not add sequence numbers.
- Do not create separate solution files or directories. Put hints and answers in the scenario README inside `<details>` blocks.
- Each category root must have a README with reverse-search guidance. If the target category lacks one, propose creating it.
- Keep the tutorial material at `workshop/00-tutorial/README.md`; it is not a scenario under a difficulty directory, so do not list it in the `workshop/SCENARIOS.md` table.

## Difficulty and Scenario Format

The directory and the PR label must express the same difficulty: `初級`, `中級`, or `上級`.

| Level | Directory | Story guidance | Questions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 初級 | `01-beginner` | 目の前のコードや出力から用語・基本仕様を調べる | About 2 |
| 中級 | `02-intermediate` | 実現したいことと制約から具体的な方法を調べる | 3 |
| 上級 | `03-advanced` | 現象の背景にある仕様・設計・歴史を調べる | No fixed limit |

Examples: [beginner #2](https://github.com/andpad-dev/gotan/pull/2), [intermediate #3](https://github.com/andpad-dev/gotan/pull/3), [advanced #4](https://github.com/andpad-dev/gotan/pull/4).

## Scenario README

Use this structure:

1. `# <title>`.
2. One execution-environment line, so readers can tell before opening whether they need Go installed.
3. An introduction framed as a workplace problem. The observation, purpose, and investigation should connect naturally without requiring a fixed sentence. Link every runnable Go example to Go Playground.
4. A `<details><summary>調査の入り口</summary>` block placed **before the first question**, so readers meet it before they start.

   Open with one sentence pointing at the category README (`まず [<category> の調べ方](../../README.md) を開き、…`), then `そのうえで、次のどれかから入ります。`, then a **bulleted** list — not numbered. The sources are alternatives, not steps; a numbered list of ten reads as a ten-step procedure. Each bullet is `- [source](url) — short description`, naming the source and what it covers. Never a bare link with no explanation.

   Because readers see this block **before** they read the questions, it must not spoil the hints. Keep the two apart:

   | | Include | Exclude |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | 調査の入り口 | which document to open; what that document covers | section names, search terms, what to compare, the order to follow |
   | ヒント | section names, search terms, what to compare | the conclusion |

   A term already disclosed in the question text is not a spoiler and may stay. A section name that is already part of the linked URL (`#hdr-...`) may stay in the link text.
5. `## 設問 N: <heading>` sections, using the question count for the difficulty. Each section contains the problem, an optional `<details><summary>ヒント</summary>` hint, and an `<details><summary>答え</summary>` explanation with **調査ルート** (primary sources and order) and **答え**.
6. An optional `<details><summary>こぼれ話</summary>` section for interesting but nonessential findings.

Formatting:

- Separate the entry-point block, questions, and trivia with `---`.
- Do not use Markdown headings inside `<details>`; use bold labels instead.
- Keep common investigation triggers, such as “press `f` to search first,” visible in the category README rather than hiding them in hints.

Go-version badge:

| Case | Message | Color |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Go version has a minimum requirement | `Go <x.y> 以上` | `F39C12` |
| Go version is fixed to one release | `Go <x.y>` | `F39C12` |
| Go version is not specified | `指定なし` | `9E9E9E` |
| No code to run | `不要` | `9E9E9E` |

Write it as `![実行環境: <message>](https://img.shields.io/badge/実行環境-<message>-<color>)` with the label and message percent-encoded, and keep the alt text identical to the badge. Add anything the badge cannot carry as one line below it.

Then add a row to the category table in `workshop/SCENARIOS.md`, pasting the **same badge markdown verbatim**. The two must match character for character, so a mismatch is easy to spot.

## Quality and Research

- Write learner-facing problem statements in Japanese.
- Verify every referenced URL with `curl` or an equivalent HTTP-status check before committing it.
- Run every code snippet with `go run`; copy its actual output into the README. Link all problem code and execution examples to Go Playground:
  `curl -s -X POST --data-binary @main.go https://play.golang.org/share` → `https://go.dev/play/p/<id>`.
- Treat Go 1.27 (`go1.27`) as the current version for this repository. For recent-feature scenarios, prioritize features introduced in Go 1.26 or Go 1.27.
- Never conclude from caches, search indexes, snippets, or memory alone. Trace every technical claim to a primary source.
