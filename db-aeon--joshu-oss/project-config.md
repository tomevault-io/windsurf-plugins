# .cursorrules

This Cursor workspace is **multi-root**. All of these repos are open together:

| Repo folder | Role |
|-------------|------|
| `joshu-oss/` | **Canonical AGPL** — community PRs, engine/apps/packages/skills |
| `joshu/` | Private fleet superset — merges OSS + `proprietary/`, `vendor/`, Joshu-SOP |
| `joshu-control-plane/` | Private control plane (Vercel → hello.joshu.me) |
| `joshu-design/` | Private JDL brand pack (tokens, assets) |

## Where to edit

| Change type | Repository |
|-------------|------------|
| AGPL engine, apps, EA skills, generic docs | **`joshu-oss/`** |
| Proprietary apps, fleet SOPs, learning-loop scripts | **`joshu/`** only |
| Control plane | **`joshu-control-plane/`** |

Fleet repo sync: `bash joshu/scripts/sync-from-oss.sh` after OSS `main` moves.

## Documentation

1. **`joshu-oss/docs/`** — public self-host and app docs (canonical for AGPL).
2. **`joshu/docs/`** — full internal canon including `Joshu-SOP/`, fleet runbooks.
3. **`joshu-control-plane/docs/`** — provisioning, portal, schema.
4. **`joshu-design/`** — brand guidelines and assets.

Generic EA guide (OSS): `docs/executive-assistant.md`. Fleet SOP depth stays in `joshu/docs/Joshu-SOP/`.

**OSS boundaries:** run `npm run check:oss-boundaries` before publishing. Never hardcode fleet customer names in AGPL paths.

**ArozOS:** Joshu patches live in `joshu/patches/arozos/joshu-core.patch`, not as commits inside `joshu/vendor/arozos` (submodule).

Coding Style:
- Use comments liberally
- Keep things DRY
- Keep architecture clean and separate interests

Finally, if you need me to run something locally because of sandbox permissions, just ask.
