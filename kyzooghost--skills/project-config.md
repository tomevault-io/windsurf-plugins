# CLAUDE.md

# Shell commands

Use `rtk` wrappers by default for shell commands to reduce output tokens.
Do not run `rtk init*`
If `rtk` has no equivalent or output is too compressed, run raw command or `rtk proxy <cmd>`

# Strict Rules

If anything about the user's request is unclear, ask relentlessly - intent, technical implementation, system design, tradeoffs, UX, all of it.

When writing unit tests, ensure they comply with /unit-test.

If an environment variable is added or removed, update the corresponding .env.* template files in the same project to match.

Use shared const enums or constant objects instead of raw string literals when introducing new string values. Never scatter raw strings across files.

When installing new dependencies, pin exact versions. Do NOT use floating versions, ranges, wildcards, or "latest".

Code should be self-documenting for 'what'. Comments explain 'why' - decisions, constraints, non-obvious reasons - written for a developer with zero prior context. Be concise; every word should earn its place.

Never commit code that logs sensitive details (credential tokens, RPC URLs, etc.) - mask them if they must appear in output. Unmasked logging for local debugging is acceptable if reverted before committing.

All bash scripts must start with `set -euo pipefail`.

Java/Kotlin: Use imports instead of fully qualified class names (e.g., `Response<String>` not `org.web3j.protocol.core.Response<String>`).

Do not write with emdash `—`, write with regular dash `-` instead

When corrected, after making a mistake or misinterpreting an instruction, write to ~/.claude/lessons.md:
- Organize by git remote (`git remote get-url origin`)
- Per lesson: half-to-one-line summary header, then what went wrong, why, prevention rule as separate sections
- At session start, review only current remote's section

# Coding Guidelines

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 0. Match Local Conventions First

**Before writing any implementation, examine 2-3 sibling files in the target directory.**

If local patterns conflict with rules in this file or in skills, **local patterns win**. Your code should look like it belongs next to its neighbors.

Check: Do similar files have unit tests? What's the naming convention? How are utilities structured?

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Subagent Strategy

**Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean.**

- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents.
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents.
- One task per subagent for focused execution.

## 6. Error Handling

- Fail fast with clear, actionable messages
- Never swallow exceptions silently
- Include context (what operation, what input, suggested fix)

# Technical Writing & Analysis

When writing technical documentation or doing deep technical analysis:
- Use EXACT values from source material - never approximate (e.g., "exactly 1 block" not "~1 block").
- Do NOT invent steps, mechanisms, or details not in the source.
- Flag uncertain claims with [NEEDS VERIFICATION] rather than guessing.
- For protocol/contract descriptions, cite the specific file and line.

## Mermaid Diagrams

When creating Mermaid diagrams:
- Never split a single statement across multiple lines. Each diagram statement (e.g., `A->>B:
message`) must be on one line.
- Validate syntax mentally before presenting - watch for stray `end` keywords, unclosed blocks,
and incorrect nesting.

## Tables

When writing tables, provide both ASCII (plain text) and Markdown formats so the output is copy-pasteable into any tool.
