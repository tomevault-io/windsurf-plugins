# nmrs Code Review Guide

Guide for reviewing pull requests to `nmrs` — a Rust library for NetworkManager over D-Bus.

## Error Handling and Result Types

Every fallible operation must return `nmrs::Result<T>`, which is `Result<T, ConnectionError>`. Do not use `.unwrap()`, `.panic!()`, or `.expect()` in library code. The only exception is `unwrap_or_else()` when there is a documented fallback value.

When examining error paths, ensure all errors use typed `ConnectionError` variants. Do not accept raw string errors or opaque error wrappers like `anyhow::Error`. This forces callers to handle specific failure modes. For example, `BluezUnavailable` should be distinct from `BluetoothToggleFailed` so consumers can decide whether to retry, skip Bluetooth, or propagate the error upward.

Aggregate operations (like `set_airplane_mode`) that combine multiple independent D-Bus calls must document their partial-failure semantics. If Wi-Fi and WWAN toggle succeed but Bluetooth settle fails, the entire operation should not fail. Bluetooth failures should be logged as warnings and allow the aggregate operation to return `Ok()`. This prevents state divergence where the UI sees failure while the underlying radios are already in the desired state.

## D-Bus and NetworkManager Semantics

All D-Bus communication must go through `zbus` (v5.15.0+). Proxy calls should be wrapped cleanly in `dbus/` module functions and not exposed raw in the public API.

When fetching radio state or toggling radios, be aware of the distinction between:
- Software-enabled: the user-controlled toggle (readable and writable via D-Bus)
- Hardware-enabled: the rfkill state (read-only from userspace)

Both are necessary to determine actual radio capability. A radio can be software-enabled but hardware-killed, resulting in no functional connectivity.

For operations that affect multiple radios (Wi-Fi, WWAN, Bluetooth), use `futures::future::join3()` or similar combinators to execute them concurrently. Do not chain sequential `.await` calls. NetworkManager and BlueZ may have slow property changes, and Bluetooth adapters have a 2-second settlement timeout (`BLUEZ_POWER_SETTLE_TIMEOUT`). Concurrent fetches reduce total latency and expose timing issues early.

When toggling Bluetooth adapters, the `Powered` property may take time to flip. The code must wait (with a timeout) for the property to actually settle on the target value before returning. A read-after-write of airplane mode state should not see stale Bluetooth state from before the toggle.

## Testing for Bug Fixes

Every bug fix must include a regression test that would fail if the bug were reintroduced. The test should not rely on graceful error handling or early returns; it must assert that the operation succeeded with `expect()` or `assert!()` and verify the expected state changed.

For example, when Bluetooth settle failures caused `set_airplane_mode()` to fail entirely (while Wi-Fi was already toggled), the regression test must:
1. Call `set_airplane_mode()` and use `.expect()` to assert it returned `Ok()`
2. Verify the airplane mode state actually changed (not just that the call didn't panic)
3. Document in a comment what the original bug was and how this test prevents it

Do not write tests that gracefully skip on error or log warnings and return successfully. Those patterns hide regressions. The test must fail loudly if the operation returns an error when it should succeed.

## Testing for New Behavior

When adding a new feature, write tests that verify the happy path and at least one error case. Test both the positive (feature works) and negative (error handling is correct) scenarios.

Tests belong in three places:
- Unit tests in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` within the module or in `api/models/tests.rs`
- Integration tests in `nmrs/tests/` that require a running NetworkManager instance
- Doc examples in public API functions (runnable with `cargo test --doc`)

Integration tests can skip gracefully if NetworkManager is unavailable (using `require_networkmanager!()` macro), but core unit tests must not depend on external services. Mock or inject dependencies where needed.

Test assertions should verify behavior, not implementation. Avoid testing internal helper function calls or private state; test the public API's observable output. When testing aggregate operations, verify that all three radio states are queried concurrently, not that the code uses `join3()` internally.

## D-Bus Proxy Calls and Lifetimes

Proxy objects from `zbus` (like `NMProxy`, `BluezAdapterProxy`) are tied to the `Connection` lifetime. When creating proxies, ensure they are not stored in long-lived structs without proper lifetime annotations. Pass `&Connection` to internal functions and construct fresh proxies as needed.

D-Bus signal subscriptions (for monitoring state changes) must be properly scoped and dropped when no longer needed. Use streaming futures and explicit drop guards to avoid resource leaks.

## Code Organization

Keep layers separate:
- `api/`: Public API surface and high-level operations (e.g., `set_airplane_mode`)
- `core/`: Internal business logic that orchestrates D-Bus calls
- `dbus/`: Raw D-Bus proxy wrappers and method calls
