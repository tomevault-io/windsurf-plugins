# ⚓ SaaS Yacht Club - Cursor IDE Rules

## 🎯 Project Context
This is the **SaaS Yacht Club** - a FREE & Open Source SaaS boilerplate built with React 19, Next.js 15, TypeScript 5.7, Better Auth, Stripe, Neon PostgreSQL, and Drizzle ORM. It's production-ready with enterprise-grade security, multi-tenant architecture, and modern development practices.

## 🛠️ Development Environment
- **Node.js**: >= 20.0.0 (use .nvmrc)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm >= 9.0.0 (faster than npm/yarn)
- **TypeScript**: 5.7+ with strict mode enabled
- **Build System**: Turbo monorepo with caching
- **Code Quality**: Biome (100x faster than ESLint)

## 📦 Package Management
- Prefer `pnpm` over npm/yarn for all operations
- Use `pnpm -w` for workspace-level commands
- Resolve semver conflicts by preferring app versions
- Always run `pnpm -w build` before pushing to ensure clean builds
- Use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in CI/production

## 🔐 Environment & Security
- **Required Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, RESEND_API_KEY
- **Optional but Recommended**: SENTRY_DSN, AXIOM_TOKEN, NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY
- Never commit .env files or secrets to version control
- Use .env.example as template for required variables
- Validate all environment variables at startup

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns
- **App Router**: Use Next.js 15 App Router exclusively (no Pages Router)
- **Server Components**: Default to Server Components, use 'use client' only when needed
- **React 19**: Leverage new features like improved hydration and concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with proper null/undefined handling using optional chaining
- **Database**: Use Drizzle ORM with type-safe queries and relations

## 🎨 Code Style & Quality
- **Linting**: Use Biome instead of ESLint (configured in biome.jsonc)
- **Formatting**: Biome handles formatting (no Prettier needed)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with exactOptionalPropertyTypes: false
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports with @ alias for src/ directory
- **Components**: PascalCase for components, kebab-case for pages

## 🔄 API & Error Handling
- Use `next-axiom` `withAxiom` wrapper on all API routes and middleware
- Capture errors via `src/lib/logging.ts` `captureError` function
- Implement proper error boundaries with global-error.tsx
- Use Zod for input validation and type safety
- Follow RESTful conventions with proper HTTP status codes

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for end-to-end testing
- **Type Checking**: Run `pnpm type-check` before commits
- **Build Verification**: Always run `pnpm -w build` before pushing
- **Coverage**: Maintain good test coverage for critical paths

## 🚀 Deployment & Production
- **Platform**: Optimized for Vercel deployment
- **Build**: Use `pnpm build` for production builds
- **Environment**: Separate configs for development/staging/production
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for errors, PostHog for analytics, Axiom for logs
- **Performance**: Monitor Core Web Vitals and optimize accordingly

## 🔒 Security Best Practices
- Implement CSRF protection with tokens
- Use proper input sanitization and validation
- Enable rate limiting on API endpoints
- Use secure session management with Better Auth
- Implement proper CORS and security headers
- Regular dependency updates and security scanning

## 📊 Database & ORM
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe queries
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Migrations**: Use Drizzle migrations for schema changes
- **Relations**: Properly define relations for complex queries
- **Indexes**: Add appropriate indexes for performance

## 🎯 Component Development
- Use shadcn/ui as base component library
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Use Tailwind CSS with consistent design tokens
- Support dark mode with CSS variables
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Use React.forwardRef for component refs

## 📱 Responsive & Performance
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Use proper caching strategies (Redis, CDN)
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Monitor and optimize Core Web Vitals

## 🤝 Collaboration & Git
- Use conventional commits for clear history
- Create feature branches for new development
- Use pull request templates for consistency
- Run all checks before pushing (build, test, lint)
- Keep commits atomic and well-described

## 📚 Documentation
- Update documentation when adding new features
- Use JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep README and CONTRIBUTING.md current
- Document API endpoints and their usage
- Maintain changelog for version tracking

Remember: This is a production-ready boilerplate used by real SaaS companies. Maintain high code quality, security standards, and performance optimization in all contributions.
