# Ticket Workflow and Development Process

This rule documents the ticket system and development process for the QuickBooks Oracle project.

## Ticket Structure

All development is driven by tickets located in the `tickets/` directory with the following format:
- **Naming Convention**: `XX-title.md` where `XX` is the sequence order (e.g., `01-Fixing-Firecrawl-Extraction-Implementation.md`)
- **Status Indicators**: ✅ done · ⏳ pending · 🛑 blocked

### Core Ticket Files

- **@00-Overview.md**: 
  - Top-level epic description and ticket list
  - Shows dependencies between tickets
  - Tracks overall progress

- **@README.md**:
  - Instructions for using the ticket system
  - Development workflow guidelines

- **@TODO.md**:
  - Initial master ticket with comprehensive details
  - Technical specifications and requirements

## Development Workflow

1. Read **@00-Overview.md** first to understand the feature scope
2. Read **@TODO.md** for technical details and requirements
3. Pick the lowest-numbered ticket with **pending** (⏳) status whose dependencies are met
4. Complete the implementation following the guidelines in the ticket
5. Mark the ticket as **done** (✅) in **@00-Overview.md**
6. Create appropriate documentation in `docs/intuit/` when relevant

## Implementation Guidelines

### Core Principles

- Follow functional programming and SOLID principles
- Use descriptive names, avoid `any` type
- Maintain ≥90% unit test coverage
- Follow existing coding patterns

### Key Technologies

- UI stack: React 18 + Next.js (RSC where possible) + shadcn/tailwind
- Testing: Jest/Bun for unit tests
- Documentation: Markdown files (.md)
- File naming: kebab-case for filenames

### Required Documentation

When creating new utilities or components, ensure proper documentation in matching `.md` files:
- **Utility docs**: Follow the pattern in @MapEstimateToInvoice.md
- **API docs**: Follow the pattern in @InvoiceServiceWrapper.md

## Success Criteria

Each ticket includes its own success criteria, but general requirements include:
- Code passes ESLint/Biome validations
- All unit tests pass
- Documentation is complete
- Implementation matches the requirements specified in the ticket

## Dependencies Management

- Check ticket dependencies in **@00-Overview.md** before starting
- Mark tickets as blocked (🛑) if any dependencies are incomplete
- For tickets with dependencies, verify that required functionality exists before implementation
