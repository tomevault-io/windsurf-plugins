# kody agent index

Instructions for **agents and humans working in this repository** (building and
maintaining Kody). End-user / MCP usage docs live under
[`docs/use/`](./docs/use/index.md).

Use Node 24 and npm for installs and scripts (`npm install`, `npm run ...`).

This file is intentionally brief. Detailed instructions live in focused docs:

- Contributor documentation map:
  [docs/contributing/index.md](./docs/contributing/index.md)
- Talk slide decks (Slidev): [docs/talks/README.md](./docs/talks/README.md)
  (`npm run dev:talks`)
- Documentation principles (usage vs contributing, MCP text, gardening):
  [docs/contributing/documentation.md](./docs/contributing/documentation.md)
- Commit-time formatting, linting, and typechecking are enforced by Husky +
  lint-staged; see `docs/contributing/setup.md` for the workflow details and
  what still needs explicit validation.
