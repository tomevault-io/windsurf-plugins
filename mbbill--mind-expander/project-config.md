  },
  "implementationPolicy": {
    "scopeControl": "Do not add speculative features, diagnostics, UI affordances, or helpful extras that were not requested. If an addition seems useful but is not required for the current task, discuss it before implementing it.",
    "diagnostics": "Keep debug and diagnostic views driven by the same data structures used by the real implementation. Do not maintain separate approximate diagnostic data.",
    "comments": "When adding code for a specific feature or product behavior, include a nearby intent comment only when the behavior or constraint is not obvious from the code. Comments should explain why the code is needed and what behavior it protects, not restate the implementation line by line."
