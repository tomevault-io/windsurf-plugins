# Hyperbook Copilot Instructions

## Repository Overview

**Hyperbook** is a TypeScript/Node.js tool for building interactive workbooks and documentation. This is a monorepo containing ~22,000 lines of code that supports modern web standards and includes features like embedded code execution environments, interactive elements, and multi-language support.

### High-level Information
- **Type**: CLI tool and web framework for interactive documentation
- **Languages**: TypeScript (primary), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Markdown
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ required, browser runtime for built output
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (required, version 8+)
- **Build System**: esbuild (via custom scripts), TypeScript compilation, Vite
- **Architecture**: Monorepo with 6 packages, 1 platform, and self-documenting website

## Build and Development Instructions

### Prerequisites
**ALWAYS** ensure these are installed before any operations:
```bash
# Install pnpm if not available
npm install -g pnpm@9.1.1

# Verify versions
node --version  # Should be 18+
pnpm --version  # Should be 8+
```

### Essential Build Sequence
**CRITICAL**: Always follow this exact sequence. Package dependencies require specific build order.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (ALWAYS run first)
pnpm install

# 2. Build packages in dependency order
cd packages/types && pnpm build                          # No dependencies
cd packages/fs && pnpm build                             # Depends on types
cd packages/web-component-excalidraw && pnpm build       # No dependencies, needed by markdown
cd packages/markdown && pnpm build                       # Depends on types, includes emoji prebuild
cd packages/hyperbook && pnpm build                      # Depends on fs, markdown, types

# 3. Full monorepo build (after individual packages work)
pnpm build

# 4. Run tests
pnpm test

# 5. Run linting
pnpm lint  # May have TypeScript errors in excalidraw package (non-blocking)
```

### Known Build Issues and Workarounds

**TypeScript Errors in web-component-excalidraw**:
- External dependency issues with @excalidraw packages
- These are non-blocking for most development work
- Safe to ignore unless working specifically on Excalidraw integration

**Missing Locales Error**:
- May occur during hyperbook package build
- **Fix**: Ensure `packages/markdown/dist/locales` exists by copying from `packages/markdown/locales`

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development watcher (watches all packages)
pnpm dev

# Run tests (includes vitest for all packages)
pnpm test

# Run specific package commands
pnpm --filter hyperbook build
pnpm --filter @hyperbook/fs test
pnpm --filter hyperbook-studio watch  # VSCode extension

# Website development (uses built hyperbook CLI)
pnpm website:dev    # Start dev server
pnpm website:build  # Build documentation site

# Platform-specific commands
pnpm platform:vscode:dev  # VSCode extension development
```

### Testing Instructions
- **Test Framework**: Vitest (configured per package)
- **Test Files**: Located in `packages/*/tests/` directories
- **Test Coverage**: Core packages have comprehensive test suites
- **Snapshots**: Some tests use snapshot testing (in `__snapshots__` folders)
- **Test Requirements**: Build packages before running tests
- **CI Environment**: Set `CI=true` for production test runs
