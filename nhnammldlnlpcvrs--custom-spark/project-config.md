# Apache Spark

## Pre-flight Checks

Before the first code edit or running test in a session, ensure a clean working environment. DO NOT skip these checks:

1. Run `git remote -v` to identify the personal fork and upstream (`apache/spark`). If unclear, ask the user to configure their remotes following the standard convention (`origin` for the fork, `upstream` for `apache/spark`).
2. If the latest commit on `<upstream>/master` is more than a day old (check with `git log -1 --format="%ci" <upstream>/master`), run `git fetch <upstream> master`.
3. If there are uncommitted changes (check with `git status`), ask the user to stash them before proceeding.
4. Switch to the appropriate branch:
   - **Existing PR**: resolve the PR branch name via `gh api repos/apache/spark/pulls/<number> --jq '.head.ref'`, then look for a local branch matching that name. If found, switch to it and inform the user. If not found, ask whether to fetch it or if there is a local branch under a different name.
   - **New edits**: ask the user to choose: create a new git worktree from `<upstream>/master` and work from there (recommended), or create and switch to a new branch from `<upstream>/master`.
   - **Running tests**: use `<upstream>/master`.

## Development Notes

SQL golden file tests are managed by `SQLQueryTestSuite` and its variants. Read the class documentation before running or updating these tests. DO NOT edit the generated golden files (`.sql.out`) directly. Always regenerate them when needed, and carefully review the diff to make sure it's expected.

Spark Connect protocol is defined in proto files under `sql/connect/common/src/main/protobuf/`. Read the README there before modifying proto definitions.

Avoid introducing non-ASCII characters in code or comments. String literals may contain non-ASCII when the content requires it (error messages, test data, etc.). Identifiers are ASCII by convention. The common failure mode is typographic characters (em-dash, smart quotes, ellipsis, non-breaking space) sneaking into comments; scalastyle flags some of these. Spot-check before committing: `grep -rn -P "[^\x00-\x7F]" <files>`.

## Build and Test

Build and tests can take a long time. If the user explicitly asked to run tests, run them. Otherwise (you are running tests on your own to verify a change), first ask the user if they have more changes to make.

Prefer SBT over Maven for faster incremental compilation. Module names are defined in `project/SparkBuild.scala`.

Compile a single module:

    build/sbt <module>/compile

Compile test code for a single module:

    build/sbt <module>/Test/compile

Run test suites by wildcard or full class name:

    build/sbt '<module>/testOnly *MySuite'
    build/sbt '<module>/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.MySuite'

Run test cases matching a substring:

    build/sbt '<module>/testOnly *MySuite -- -z "test name"'

For faster iteration, keep SBT open in interactive mode:

    build/sbt
    > project <module>
    > testOnly *MySuite

### PySpark Tests

PySpark tests require building Spark with Hive support first:

    build/sbt -Phive package

Activate the virtual environment specified by the user, or default to `.venv`:

    source <venv>/bin/activate

If the default venv does not exist, create it:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r dev/requirements.txt

Run a single test suite:

    python/run-tests --testnames pyspark.sql.tests.arrow.test_arrow

Run a single test case:

    python/run-tests --testnames "pyspark.sql.tests.test_catalog CatalogTests.test_current_database"

## Investigating PR CI Failures

Do NOT download full job logs to grep for errors — they are very large and slow. Instead, use the test report annotations on the fork.

Step 1 — Get the fork owner and the latest commit SHA of the PR:

    gh api repos/apache/spark/pulls/<PR_NUMBER> --jq '{owner: .head.repo.owner.login, sha: .head.sha}'

Step 2 — Find the "Report test results" check run on the fork's commit:

    gh api repos/<OWNER>/spark/commits/<SHA>/check-runs \
      --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.name == "Report test results") | {id: .id, annotations: .output.annotations_count}'

Step 3 — Fetch failure annotations:

    gh api repos/<OWNER>/spark/check-runs/<CHECK_RUN_ID>/annotations

Each annotation contains the test class, test name, and failure message.

## Pull Request Workflow

PR title format is `[SPARK-xxxx][COMPONENT] Title`. The component tag is derived from the JIRA component name: take the last word and uppercase it (e.g. `Project Infra` → `[INFRA]`, `Spark Core` → `[CORE]`, `Structured Streaming` → `[STREAMING]`, `SQL` → `[SQL]`).

Infer the PR title from the changes. If no ticket ID is given, create one using `dev/create_spark_jira.py`, using the PR title (without the JIRA ID and component tag) as the ticket title.

    python3 dev/create_spark_jira.py "<title>" -c <component> { -t <type> | -p <parent-jira-id> }

- **Component** (`-c`): the exact JIRA component name (not the PR title shorthand), e.g. "SQL", "Spark Core", "PySpark", "Connect". Run `python3 dev/create_spark_jira.py --list-components` for the full list.
