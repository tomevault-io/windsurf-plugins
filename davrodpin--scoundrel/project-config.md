# Skill Loading (MANDATORY — Execute Before All Tasks)

Every task MUST begin by loading the relevant skills. Do NOT write or modify any
code until you have read the matching SKILL.md files. Do not rely on memory —
read the file every time.

| Trigger                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Skill to Load   | File to Read                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Any code change (feature, bug, test)                                                                                                                                                                        | tdd-development | `.claude/skills/tdd-development/SKILL.md` |
| Any file change — code, tests, .md docs (including CLAUDE.md), .json/.yaml/.toml config, dashboard files, assets, .claude/ directory files (skills, settings, SKILL.md files), or anything else in the repo | git-workflow    | `.claude/skills/git-workflow/SKILL.md`    |
| Building or modifying UI components                                                                                                                                                                         | game-frontend   | `.claude/skills/game-frontend/SKILL.md`   |

Multiple skills often apply to the same task. Load ALL that match.

## Execution Order

1. FIRST: `git-workflow` — create worktree and branch
2. THEN: `tdd-development` — write tests before implementation
3. IF UI work: `game-frontend` — apply dungeon crawler aesthetic

## Common Mistakes (AVOID)

- Starting to code and reading the skill mid-task
- Skipping `git-workflow` for "small changes"
- Assuming you know the TDD skill without re-reading it
- Loading only one skill when multiple apply (e.g., UI + TDD)

# Project Overview

Scoundrel is a web application where people can play the Scoundrel card game
where the player explores a dungeon, collecting weapons and health potions, and
fighting monsters.

For more information about the games, including all rules, you can refer to
@docs/SCOUNDREL.md

# Development Methodology

- TDD is non-negotiable. Every code change — new features, bug fixes, refactors
  — goes through the `tdd-development` skill.
- Every implementation task MUST be done inside a git worktree. Use the
  `git-workflow` skill to create the worktree and branch. Never implement
  directly on `main`.
- When building or modifying UI components, also use the `game-frontend` skill
  to maintain the dungeon crawler aesthetic.

# Tech Stack

- **Frontend** implemented in TypeScript (Deno), using
  [Deno Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) and
  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Backend** implemented in TypeScript (Deno) using Deno Fresh. Database Prisma
  with Postgres
- **Platform** [Deno Deploy](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/) will be
  infrastructure provider
- **Schema Validation** [Zod](https://zod.dev/basics)
- **Logging** [LogTape](https://logtape.org/manual/start)

## Subdirectory Context (Routing)

Refer to local `CLAUDE.md` files for specialized instructions:

- `routes/`: Server-side Fresh routes and API handlers.
- `routes/api/`: API route conventions.
- `islands/`: Client-side interactive components (Preact).
- `lib/engine`: Game rule engine.

# Coding Standards

- No any types - ever (use unknown if type truly unknown)
- No type assertions without justification
- Prefer type over interface for data structures
- Reserve interface for behavior contracts only
- Define schemas first, derive types from them (Zod/Standard Schema)
- Use schemas at trust boundaries, plain types for internal logic
- Every and each domain that requires code to be written should be written as a
  [Deno Module](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/modules/) inside the
  `lib/` directory
- All modules should have a `mod.ts` files that will contain only the function,
  type and classes the module exports to be used by clients
- Every module must have an entry on `deno.json` dependencies, scope by
  @scoundrel. Example: an authentication modules would have a
  `@scoundrel/authentication: "./lib/authentication/mod.ts` entry
- Each feature must have their own suite of integration tests. Integration tests
  don't use mocks anywhere. They will run against lower environments.
- Any administered task like database migrations, run tests and etc should be
  represented as a Deno task in `deno.json`
- Environment variables are managed via Deno Deploy and injected locally using
  `deno task --tunnel <task>`
- When adding logging messages, use the appropriate level and use
  [structured data](https://logtape.org/manual/struct)
- Use zod for all schema validations
- All timestamps in UTC
- Any dependency should be injected to the application state defined in
  @utils.ts

## Error Handling

Use `AppError` from `@scoundrel/errors` for all typed errors. Never construct
