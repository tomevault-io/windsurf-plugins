# Agent guide

Read this before changing anything here.

## What this repository is

A static recompilation of Tony Hawk's Project 8 (Xbox 360), published as
checkpointed releases.

- **`src/`, `config/` and `patches/` are synchronised from the project's
  development tree.** Changes to them are applied there and arrive here in a
  release, so a pull request against those paths may be applied as a patch
  rather than merged as a commit. It will be credited either way. The README,
  `docs/`, `tools/`, `.github/`, and the licence files belong to this repository
  and are edited here directly.
- **This repo has exactly one goal:** make it easy for someone who owns a legal
  copy to end up with a ready-to-play build. It is not a research dump.

## The rule that overrides everything

**No game content is ever committed or published.** Not assets, audio, video,
textures, `default.xex`, disc images, decrypted intermediates, platform keys, or
the translation units the recompiler generates from a dump.

`tools/check_no_game_content.sh` enforces it against the file listing, not the
ignore rules. Run it before any commit that adds files. There is no allowlist,
and adding one is not a change to make casually.

If you are unsure whether something counts: it counts.

## Layout

```
src/launcher/    the GUI launcher. Links no SDK; builds anywhere, needs no dump.
src/identify/    disc identity + extraction. Links the SDK; does what the GUI must not.
src/game/        the game's host code. Needs the SDK and generated sources.
src/common/      shared between the identity worker and the game's dump gate.
config/          recompiler configuration: addresses, sizes, names.
patches/         patches against the SDK the port depends on.
tools/           staging, licence generation, and the release gates.
docs/            end-user and contributor documentation.
```

## Things that are the way they are on purpose

**The launcher links no part of the SDK.** That is what lets CI build it, lets
it build when the game does not, and keeps it from failing in the dynamic
linker. Disc identity is answered by a separate binary that does link the SDK.
Do not "simplify" this by merging them.

**One dump table, two gates.** `src/common/supported_dumps.h` is used by both
the launcher's identity check and the game's own startup gate. Never copy it;
two copies mean one of them is never tested.

**Settings render to argv by omission.** An unset setting emits no flag at all,
never `--flag=`. An empty value is consumed as the next argument and silently
shifts the whole command line. `src/launcher/tests/test_settings.cpp` holds this;
do not route around it.

**The dump gate has no override flag.** Now that the executable ships prebuilt,
that gate is the only remaining guarantee that a user's assets match the build
compiled against them.

**Generated sources are never committed.** They are a mechanical translation of
the user's own executable, regenerated locally from configuration that *is*
committed here. Addresses and table entries are facts about a binary; the binary
is not.

## Verification, and its limit

**Headless testing cannot verify this launcher's UI.** There is no window
manager in CI, so nothing delivers focus and synthetic input never reaches a
control. CI proves the RML/RCSS documents parse with zero diagnostics and that
code paths run. It cannot prove a user can reach them.

This is not a theoretical caveat. A previous fully-green headless pass shipped
three defects that a human with a controller found in minutes: every button
silently discarding its click, B doing nothing, and Play producing a black
screen from one missing flag.

So: **anything input-driven needs a human before it is called done.** Say
"implemented, unverified" and add it to `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` rather than
implying a machine confirmed it. Do not fake a screenshot, and do not describe a
headless run as evidence that a control works.

**Windows is unverified in the same way, only more so.** A community report
confirms that v0.1.0 started on Windows 10, but the maintainers have not run a
current complete build on real Windows hardware. Never describe it as verified,
and never describe a compatibility-layer result as evidence about real
Windows.

## Comments

Explain why, not what, particularly when the obvious approach was tried and
failed. That history is the most valuable thing in a comment and the easiest to
lose.

**Do not cite documents that are not in this repository.** No plan
identifiers, milestone numbers or release-gate item numbers: none of them exist
here, so they read as nonsense. State the reasoning the citation stood for.

## Before committing

```sh
tools/check_no_game_content.sh
tools/check_patch_series.sh
cmake -S src/launcher -B build/launcher -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/launcher && ctest --test-dir build/launcher --output-on-failure
```

Touching a third-party dependency also means:

```sh
tools/make_notice.py --sdk /path/to/rexglue-sdk > NOTICE
```

Cutting a release also means:

```sh
tools/check_gpl_boundary.sh <every binary being shipped>
```

That last one exists because the SDK tree contains GPL binutils for the
recompiler, and no shipped binary may link it. It follows symlinks, because
