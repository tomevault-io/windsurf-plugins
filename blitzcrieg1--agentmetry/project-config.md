# Agentmetry: working notes for Claude

Read this before doing anything in this repository. It exists because sessions
kept relearning the same facts, and one of those facts has a deadline attached
that is expensive to break by accident.

## What this is

A **local-first endpoint sensor for AI coding agents**. It records what an agent
did at the tool boundary, correlates sequences into detections, and forwards
into the SIEM the customer already runs.

It is **not** an agent OS, not a console, not a sandbox, not a CASB. An earlier
incarnation of this repo was an agent runtime; that was removed deliberately and
is not coming back. If a change starts to look like "Agentmetry runs your
agents", it is the wrong change.

The public framing lives on [agentmetry.ai](https://agentmetry.ai) and in
`README.md`. Use "Agentic OS" only in the README, GitHub description, or
investor material. Never in landing-page copy or a cold first line.

## The detection freeze, restarted 2026-08-26

**Do not edit these files.** They are hashed into the ruleset fingerprint, and
changing any of them restarts the four-week dogfood clock that gates beta.

```
apps/orchestrator/agentmetry/core/audit/detection/rules.py
apps/orchestrator/agentmetry/core/audit/detection/traits.py
apps/orchestrator/agentmetry/core/audit/detection/engine.py
apps/orchestrator/agentmetry/core/audit/mitre.py
apps/orchestrator/agentmetry/policies/detection/manifest.yaml
```

The clock **restarted at 0.7.0 on 2026-08-26**, and the freeze runs again from
there. The previous run reached 3 of 4 green weeks and was ended deliberately:
four known false positives (#44, #49, #50, #51) were shipping as criticals to
the first external tester, and a clean gate measured against a ruleset that
fires critical on `.env.example` is not worth the weeks it took. Earliest close
is now **2026-09-23**. Check it any time:

```bash
apps/orchestrator/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m agentmetry.cli dogfood
```

Four green weeks measured against four different rulesets is not a number worth
quoting, which is why the freeze is checkable rather than promised. Verify the
fingerprint has not moved before opening any PR that touches
`apps/orchestrator/agentmetry/core/audit/`:

```bash
apps/orchestrator/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -c "from agentmetry.core.audit.dogfood import ruleset_fingerprint; print(ruleset_fingerprint()[:16])"
# expect 15846a0915769d4a
```

Four of the five parked detection-precision bugs were fixed in 0.7.0 (#44,
#49, #50, #51), which is why the clock restarted. Still parked: [#44](https://github.com/blitzcrieg1/agentmetry/issues/44),
[#49](https://github.com/blitzcrieg1/agentmetry/issues/49),
[#50](https://github.com/blitzcrieg1/agentmetry/issues/50),
[#51](https://github.com/blitzcrieg1/agentmetry/issues/51),
[#55](https://github.com/blitzcrieg1/agentmetry/issues/55). Land them as one
pass with #55, so the fingerprint moves once more and not again.

Files in `detection/` that are **not** frozen and are safe to edit:
`disposition.py`, `live.py`, `live_store.py`, `benchmark.py`, `yaml_rules.py`,
`yaml_config.py`, `models.py`.

## Where truth lives

In this order. When they disagree, the earlier one wins and the later one is
stale and should be fixed.

1. **The code**, and a command you can run
2. **`CHANGELOG.md`**, what shipped, per release
3. **`ROADMAP.md`**, what is being worked on. Refreshed 2026-08-22
4. **Open GitHub issues**
5. Everything else

**Do not trust an audit document.** Three external audits in August 2026 each
read a stale `ROADMAP.md` as current and produced findings that were already
fixed, including one that recommended building a feature which had shipped the
previous day. If a document and a command disagree, run the command.

`ROADMAP.md` carries two rules that keep it honest: shipped work leaves the file
for `CHANGELOG.md`, and every item names an issue. Keep both.

---

## Commands

The orchestrator lives in `apps/orchestrator` with a venv at `.venv`. On
Windows the interpreter is `.venv/Scripts/python.exe`.

```bash
cd apps/orchestrator
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q              # 1120 tests
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff check agentmetry tests
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m agentmetry.cli benchmark   # 50 cases, must be 0/0
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m agentmetry.cli dogfood     # the beta gate
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m agentmetry.cli doctor      # install health
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m agentmetry.cli stats --days 7
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m agentmetry.cli verify --trail data/agentmetry-trail.jsonl
```

Dashboard is `apps/dashboard` (Next 15, React 19, npm, `output: "export"`).
The marketing site is a **separate repo** at `../ai-audit-watch` and uses
**bun**, not npm. Running `npm install` there once produced a broken lockfile;
do not do it.

## How to work here

**Commit only when asked.** Do the work, report it, and wait. This is a
standing preference and it is not negotiable by convenience.

**Branch and PR.** `master` is protected with five required checks and
`enforce_admins` on, so nothing merges from a direct push. Match the existing
commit-message voice: what changed, why it was wrong before, what it cost.

**Never skip hooks or bypass signing.** If a hook fails, fix the cause.
