# Maintainer handoff for Claude and other coding agents

This file is the fastest way to resume the PvZ Fusion Android English port.
Read it completely, then read `README.md`, `docs/RESEARCH.md`, and
`docs/WORKFLOW.md` before changing build logic.

## Objective and current result

The repository contains reproducible tooling for porting the PC English
translation of *Plants vs. Zombies: Fusion* to the Android IL2CPP build. The
current supported target is Android 3.9.

The release is not a decompiled/recompiled Android application. It preserves
the Android shell and replaces exactly two Unity/IL2CPP data files:

- `assets/bin/Data/data.unity3d`
- `assets/bin/Data/Managed/Metadata/global-metadata.dat`

Do not commit APKs, extracted game data, translated bundles, metadata, DLLs,
font assets, or signing keys. `.gitignore` intentionally excludes them.

## What was learned

Joseph Franci's 3.6.1 English APK and aha's unfinished 3.8.1 APK use the same
fundamental method: translate IL2CPP literals in `global-metadata.dat`, modify
serialized Unity text/UI and fonts in `data.unity3d`, then repackage/sign.

Metadata replacement alone is insufficient. Almanac databases, TMP labels,
font references, baked textures, and layout live in the Unity bundle.

The working 3.8.1 pipeline combines:

1. current Teyliu PC translation dictionaries;
2. conservative mappings learned from aligned Chinese/English Android pairs;
3. same-version serialized UI translation;
4. TextMesh Pro font and SDF atlas transplantation;
5. narrow Android-specific layout fixes;
6. post-build validation and comparative APK safety auditing.

See `docs/RESEARCH.md` for the full evidence and object-level discoveries.

## Known local inputs for 3.8.1

These files are deliberately absent from Git. A maintainer must supply legally
obtained copies under the ignored local directories.

| Purpose | Expected local path | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| Official Chinese 3.8.1 APK shell/reference | `artifacts/ChineseAPK3.8.1.apk` | `1d6789a388621f544ea1c29778acfb12645933b67153ecaed4f54a48c7fa43c0` |
| aha 3.8.1 Android translation reference | `artifacts/pvzrh3.8.1_a.apk` | `355b35304100b64e38ba66667eaecd8841b0f5aa8a2eb58f9f42e1cb9ba63657` |
| Joseph English 3.6.1 reference | `artifacts/PvZFusion3.6.1-English-Beta1.11.apk` | verify locally |
| PC Chinese 3.8.1 reference | `artifacts/PC_PVZ-Fusion-3.8.1.zip` | verify locally |
| updated metadata donated for 3.8.1 | `artifacts/global-metadata.dat` | verify locally |

Never silently accept a hash mismatch. Upstream downloads are sometimes
replaced without changing their filename.

## Environment

- Python 3 with `requirements.txt`
- Unity version: `2022.3.62f1`
- Android SDK Build Tools 35.0.0 (`aapt2`, `zipalign`, `apksigner`)
- Dummy DLLs generated for the matching IL2CPP build, locally under
  `il2cpp/eng381_embedded/DummyDll`
- current PC translation checkout/data under ignored local directories

On Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Build order

The important rule is to begin each major stage from its documented clean
input. Do not repeatedly mutate an already-generated asset unless the stage is
explicitly designed as a final polish pass.

1. Build translated metadata with `scripts/build_metadata_translation.py`.
2. Build translated TextAssets with `scripts/build_unity_text_translation.py`.
3. Apply serialized UI translations with `scripts/build_unity_ui_translation.py`.
4. Transplant fonts using `scripts/replace_unity_font_data.py` and
   `scripts/transplant_tmp_font_asset.py`.
5. Refine Almanac typography with `scripts/refine_almanac_layout.py`.
6. Apply Android-specific finishing work with `scripts/polish_android_ui.py`.
7. Bake and validate the Help parchment with `scripts/bake_help_credits.py`.
8. Bake validated PC particle translations with
   `scripts/apply_pc_texture_translations.py`.
9. Run `scripts/audit_remaining_cjk.py` and review every *visible* result.
10. Package only the two payloads with `scripts/package_apk_payload.py`.
11. Align, release-sign, and verify the APK.
12. Run `scripts/audit_apk_release.py` against the chosen base APK.

Every builder writes a JSON report and reopens/revalidates its generated file.
Treat a failed validation as a real failure; do not delete checks to get a
build through.

## Current 3.8.1 final-polish specifics

`scripts/polish_android_ui.py` followed by `scripts/bake_help_credits.py` is the
authoritative final sequence. Important details:

- Almanac PC `<size>` tags are removed because Android applies a different
  effective scale.
- the three plant-detail skin selectors use the compact label `Skin`;
- the rotating Almanac footer is width-limited so it does not cross Search;
- duplicate live Help/Hotkeys overlays are blanked because the parchment
  already contains that content;
- the Help parchment is Texture2D path ID `2199`, named `thanks`, and must
  remain exactly 1400×600;
- the complete credit line `Joseph Franci · aha · SilverShadow · Codex` is
  baked into that texture using embedded Font path ID `6493` (`fzjz`);
- live TMP component path ID `179902` is deliberately blanked after baking;
- the disclaimer is rewritten to avoid the awkward phrase “only on the dev.”
