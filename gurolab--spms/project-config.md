# SMS Agent Progress

Last updated: 2026-03-07

## Completed in this update

1. Applied role-based guards using the requested role matrix.
2. Reworked `administrator/admin_guard.php` to enforce module-level access rules instead of admin-only blanket access.
3. Updated `api/admin.php` from admin-only access to action-level role guards that align with module ownership.
4. Fixed `profile.php` so all authenticated roles can access profile safely without triggering admin-only sidebar guard.
5. Audited Administrator module link/action wiring and fixed supplier update POST key mismatch.
6. Corrected broken Administrator breadcrumb links (`index.html`) to `dashboard.php` across module pages.
7. Aligned supplier address UI with backend validation by using required `textarea` fields in add/edit forms.
8. Improved `profile.php` Account Security submit button visibility by switching to solid primary styling.
9. Added explicit empty-state rendering in `administrator/audit_logs.php` when no records are present.
10. Instrumented authentication events in `login.php` and `logout.php` (`auth.login.*`, `auth.logout`) using `writeAuditLog`.
11. Hardened `administrator/supplier-actions.php` with field-length/contact-number validation, safer exception handling, and detailed supplier CRUD audit logs (`supplier.add.*`, `supplier.update.*`, `supplier.delete.*`).
12. Implemented Employee self-service module: request supplies/property via RIS, maintain request lines while editable, and view request + property accountability status (`employee/requisition.php`, `employee/request-actions.php`, `employee/acknowledgment.php`, dashboard metrics/links).

## Active role matrix implemented

- Employee (`roleid=6`): Employee dashboard/profile plus self-service request and status pages (`employee/requisition.php`, `employee/acknowledgment.php`).
- Supply Officer (`roleid=2`): Receive, Issuance, RIS, supplier maintenance, and related report endpoints.
- Property Custodian (`roleid=4`): ICS, PAR, Property Cards, Transfers, and related print pages.
- Inventory Officer (`roleid=3`): Items, stock inventory, supply ledger (SLC), reorder/inventory reconciliation pages.
- Auditor (`roleid=5`): RPCI, RPCPPE, IIRUP modules and audit logs access.
- System Admin (`roleid=1`): Full access to all modules.

## Notes

- `profile.php` now conditionally loads `administrator/sidebar.php` only for System Admin users.
- Non-admin users can now open and use profile pages without unintended `admin_guard` redirects.
- Audit Logs will now populate from login/logout and supplier create/update/delete actions.
- Supplier updates that previously failed due invalid/overlong input now return user-facing validation errors instead of silent failure.
