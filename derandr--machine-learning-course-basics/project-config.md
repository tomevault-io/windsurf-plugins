# Agent Guide

This repository is an introductory machine learning course.
It contains lecture notes, slide decks, example notebooks, and classroom practicals covering 18 lecture blocks from exploratory data analysis to LLM overview.

Use this file to understand what the repository contains and where to find things.

## Where Things Live

All course materials are in `lectures/`. Fully packaged lecture directories have:

- `README.md` — lecture overview with links to all files
- `lecture_notes.md` — student-facing recap and revision notes
- `links.yaml` — compact lecture metadata
- `slides/lecture.pdf` — canonical lecture deck
- `lecture_examples/` — example notebooks with paired `.py` scripts
- `practical_session/` — 90-minute classroom practical with TODO cells for students

Lectures `15` to `18` are practical-first drafts. They have lecture READMEs, notes/metadata, and practical sessions, but do not yet have packaged slide decks or separate `lecture_examples/`.
Lecture 18 currently publishes full practical notebooks rather than a separate student TODO version.

Use `lectures/index.yaml` as the machine-readable course index.

## How to Navigate

To explore the full course:

1. `README.md` — repository overview
2. `lectures/README.md` — lecture map with links
3. `lectures/index.yaml` — machine-readable index (all paths, all lectures)

To explore a specific lecture:

1. `lectures/<slug>/README.md` — what's in this lecture
2. `lectures/<slug>/lecture_notes.md` — summary and key concepts
3. `lectures/<slug>/links.yaml` — metadata
4. `lectures/<slug>/slides/lecture.pdf` — slide deck
5. `lectures/<slug>/lecture_examples/README.md` — list of example notebooks
6. `lectures/<slug>/lecture_examples/example_XX.ipynb` — example notebook
7. `lectures/<slug>/practical_session/README.md` — practical overview
8. `lectures/<slug>/practical_session/*_student_90min.ipynb` — student practical notebook

## Practical Sessions

Packaged lectures and most practical-first drafts have a `practical_session/` containing:

- A **student notebook** (`*_practical_student_90min.ipynb`) with TODO cells where students write code.
- A paired **Python script** (`*_practical_student_90min.py`) for lightweight reading and diffing.
- A **README.md** with teaching intent, scope, and environment notes.

The practicals are designed for 90 minutes and use real datasets from OpenML, library datasets, public downloads, or small generated examples.
Lecture 18 is currently an exception: it is a dual full-notebook draft without a separate student TODO notebook.

## Lecture Examples vs Practical Sessions

These are separate layers — do not mix them:

- `lecture_examples/` — demos shown during the lecture to illustrate concepts
- `practical_session/` — hands-on exercises students complete during class

## Notebook Files

- `.ipynb` is the source notebook
- `.py` is an auto-generated companion script for reading and diffing
- After editing notebooks in `lecture_examples/`, regenerate scripts: `uv run python tools/sync_lecture_examples.py`

## Local Setup

Use `uv` as the environment manager:

```bash
uv sync
uv run python tools/check_notebook_environment.py
uv run jupyter lab
```

Some lectures need extra dependencies:

| Group | Lecture | Key packages |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `ensembles` | 07 | catboost, lightgbm, xgboost |
| `time_series` | 08 | prophet |
| `hpo_automl` | 10 | h2o, optuna, hyperopt, scikit-optimize |
| `neural_networks` | 12 | torch, torchinfo |
| `nlp` | 16 | transformers, sentence-transformers, datasets, gensim |
| `llm` | 18 | transformers, accelerate, peft, bitsandbytes, torchao |
| `xai_piml` | 11 | piml (compatible Python versions only) |
| `ml_in_production` | 14 | evidently, mlflow |

Install with: `uv sync --group <group_name>`

Detailed setup: `docs/student-quickstart.md`

## Supporting Directories

- `docs/` — student-facing setup guides and workflow documentation
- `src/mlcourse/` — shared Python helpers (paths, data utilities)
- `tools/` — repository maintenance scripts (notebook sync, environment checks)
- `publish/lectures.yaml` — assignment and solution publication status
