# Commit authorship

When committing in this repo:

- Author and committer must be the human maintainer (Mr-remon219 / lemonkun211@gmail.com), not Cursor Agent or `cursoragent@cursor.com`.
- Never add `Co-authored-by:` lines for Cursor, Cursor Agent, or any AI tool.
- Do not use inverted co-author trailers; the user is the sole author even when an agent wrote the patch.

Prefer `git commit` with the user's configured identity and a message only; no agent attribution footers.
