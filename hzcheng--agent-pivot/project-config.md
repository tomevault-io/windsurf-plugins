# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents working in this repository. Read this before
making any change.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Never edit files directly in the primary checkout on `main`.** Each
   line of work runs in its own worktree on that worktree's branch: make
   every commit for the job on that branch and cut serial PRs from it as
   earlier ones merge. Do not switch branches inside the worktree, do not
   spread one job across worktrees, and do not start another worktree for
   the same job:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin main
   git worktree add -b <branch> .worktrees/<topic> origin/main  # once per job
   ```
   Run `npm run worktree:bootstrap` inside the worktree before verifying
   anything. It validates direct dependency lock entries and build sentinels;
   when either is missing or stale it runs the required `npm ci
   --ignore-scripts --allow-scripts=`, avoiding user-level npm script
   allowlists, and serializes it with other guarded commands in that worktree.
   Use `npm run worktree:run -- <command>` for a complete verification command
   so a concurrent install cannot delete its `node_modules` mid-run. npm
   silently resolves binaries from the primary checkout's `node_modules`
   otherwise. Dirty files in the primary checkout are user changes; do not
   revert them. Details: skill `protecting-main-with-worktrees`.

2. **Never push directly to `main`.** Publish through a PR against
   `origin/main` in `hzcheng/agent-pivot`. This repo has two remotes
   (`origin` = fork, `upstream` = original project) — pass
   `--repo hzcheng/agent-pivot` to every `gh` command. Write PR titles, PR
   bodies, and commit messages in English. After opening or updating a PR,
   verify it is mergeable with checks running — never leave a PR
   conflicting or red. Details: skill `publishing-and-merging-github-prs`.

3. **Load the matching skill before acting.** Project skills live in
   `.skills/` (canonical) and are mirrored into `.kimi/skills/`,
   `.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`. Their descriptions are injected into
   your context — if a description matches the task, read that skill's
   `SKILL.md` first. Only edit skills under `.skills/`, never the mirrors.

4. **Verify before committing, and again after the final fix.** Minimum
   before a commit: `npm run test-compile`, the focused tests for the touched
   area, and `git diff --check`. Details: skill `review-fix-commit-loop`.

## Merging

A PR merges when the required checks are green and the owner has posted
`approve <full-head-sha>` as a PR comment (the merge-approval gate posts the
status from the default branch; approvals bind the exact head and expire
when it moves). The PR body must carry a `## Skill harvest` section and an
`## Owner approvals` section with the ready-to-copy command (CI enforces
both).

## Common commands

- Bootstrap a worktree's dependencies: `npm run worktree:bootstrap`
- Run any complete verification under the worktree lock:
  `npm run worktree:run -- <command>`
- Compile for tests: `npm run test-compile`
- Dashboard webview checks: `node scripts/run-dashboard-webview-checks.js`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Behavior contracts: `npm run test:behavior-contracts`
- Build + install the extension locally: `npm run install-local`
  (set `SKIP_NPM_CI=1` when dependencies are already installed)

## Key paths

- Dashboard webview HTML/icons: `src/webview/webviewContent.ts`,
  `src/webview/webviewIcons.ts`; webview scripts/styles: `media/`
- AI sessions: `src/aiSessions/`; prompts: `src/prompts/`
- Behavior catalog: `docs/testing/behavior-contracts.json`
