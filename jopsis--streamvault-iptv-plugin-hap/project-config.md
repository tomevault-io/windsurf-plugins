## Project Map

This repository builds the StreamVault HaP companion plugin APK. It packages
AceServe and HTTPAceProxy behind the StreamVault plugin API, exposes a native
configuration activity, publishes a local `/aio` M3U provider, prepares local
HaP playback, and rewrites local URLs for Chromecast/LAN playback.

The graphify map for this project is in `graphify-out/`:

- `graphify-out/graph.html` is the interactive graph.
- `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` is the audit report.
- `graphify-out/graph.json` is the raw graph data.

The highest-signal graph nodes are `HapConfigActivity`, `HapBridge`,
`PlaylistCatalog`, `StreamVaultHapPluginService`, `ProxySupervisorService`, and
`AceServeRuntime`. Start there when you need architectural context.

## Main Code Areas

- `app/src/main/java/com/streamvault/plugin/hap/` contains the StreamVault
  plugin surface: `StreamVaultHapPluginService`, `HapConfigActivity`, and
  `PluginContract`.
- `app/src/main/java/com/jopsis/httpaceserveproxy/` contains the HaP runtime
  facade and Android-side proxy logic. `HapBridge` is the central facade;
  `ProxySupervisorService` owns foreground startup/shutdown; `AceServeRuntime`
  prepares and runs the bundled Python/AceServe runtime.
- `PlaylistCatalog`, `CustomPlaylistCatalog`, and `SourceValidator` own user
  M3U/custom channel persistence and validation.
- `ConnectedClientsClient`, `HealthClient`, and `ChannelStatusClient` query the
  running proxy/status endpoints.
- `ProxyExposure` owns local vs LAN exposure. The local proxy port is `8888`;
  server mode switches the native proxy listen host from `127.0.0.1` to
  `0.0.0.0`.
- `app/src/main/cpp/` contains the JNI boundary and CMake config. CMake builds
  `httpaceproxy_core` as a static library and `httpaceproxy_jni` as the shared
  Android library.
- `app/src/main/cpp/httpaceproxycpp/` contains the C++ HTTPAceProxy core:
  Ace client protocol, HTTP server, proxy handlers, plugins, playlist
  generation, broadcast streaming, JSON, and utilities.
- `app/src/main/assets/aceserve/` contains the Android AceServe runtime assets
  and ABI zips for `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a`.
- `app/src/main/assets/httpaceproxy/http/` is the bundled HTTPAceProxy web UI.
  Treat minified third-party files like jQuery, Bootstrap, and Popper as
  vendored assets.
- `app/src/main/res/values/` and `app/src/main/res/values-es/` must stay in
  sync for user-visible strings.

## Build And Verify

Use JDK 17 plus the Android SDK/NDK expected by Gradle:

```sh
JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home" \
ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk" \
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Useful commands:

```sh
./gradlew -q :app:printVersionName
./gradlew -q :app:printVersionCode
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:lintDebug
```

Install and open the debug build on a connected device with:

```sh
$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb shell am start \
  -a com.streamvault.plugin.hap.CONFIGURE \
  -p com.streamvault.plugin.hap
```

There are currently no `app/src/test` or `app/src/androidTest` sources. For
behavioral changes, run at least `:app:assembleDebug` and do a device smoke
test for the affected flow.

## Change Rules

- Keep version data synchronized across `app/build.gradle.kts`,
  `AndroidManifest.xml`, `README.md`, and `docs/Changelog.md`.
- Keep StreamVault metadata aligned with the supported API surface:
  `provider.m3u`, `playback.prepare`, `cast.rewriteUrl`, and
  `configuration.activity`.
- Do not advertise `configuration.schema` unless a complete host-rendered schema
  is intentionally implemented. The native activity is the source of truth.
- Keep `HapConfigActivity` exported for
  `com.streamvault.plugin.hap.CONFIGURE`, but do not add launcher or Leanback
  launcher intent filters. The plugin should stay hidden from app drawers.
- Put user-visible text in Android resources and update both English and Spanish
  resources together.
- Public builds must not ship hardcoded playlist sources. Sources are
  user-managed M3U lists plus the generated `Custom` source.
- Preserve M3U validation semantics: HTTP/HTTPS URL, `#EXTM3U` header, M3U
  channels, and at least one AceStream-like target.
- Changes that affect Cast/LAN playback should go through `ProxyExposure` and
  `HapBridge`; enabling server mode should restart the proxy if it is running.
- Changes that affect runtime startup must respect `ProxySupervisorService`'s
  lifecycle, foreground service notification, `ServiceState`, and readiness
  checks for AceServe and HTTPAceProxy.
- Native changes should keep C++20, the Android compile definition
  `HTTPACEPROXYCPP_ANDROID=1`, and the JNI library link option
  `-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384`.
- Do not casually edit bundled ABI zips, `libacepython.so`, or vendored
  minified web libraries. Treat them as binary/vendor inputs unless the task is
  explicitly about refreshing them.

## Release Notes

The GitHub workflow `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` builds signed release APKs
on tags or manual dispatch. Release tags must match `versionName` with an
optional leading `v`. Signed releases require the Android signing secrets used
by the workflow.
