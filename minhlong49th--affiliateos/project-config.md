## Model Routing — Antigravity

Default down, not up. Select cheapest model that can do the job correctly.

| Tier | Model | Task types |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Fast | `Gemini 3 Flash` | File search, grep, reading files, codebase exploration, boilerplate, JSDoc, syntax fixes, formatting |
| 2 — Balanced | `Gemini 3.1 Pro` | UI components, business logic, API route handlers, tests, converting Stitch HTML → React |
| 3 — Deep | `Claude Opus 4.6` | System architecture, Plan Mode decisions, security review, cross-file debugging, schema design |

- When spawning agents in Manager View, assign the lowest tier model that fits the task.
- For Tier 3 tasks: state the model switch aloud before proceeding.

## Project Bootstrap

At the start of every session, read `_brain/ANTIGRAVITY.md` for the full rules quick-reference and session checklist.

## Project Skills — AffiliateOS

Skills live in `.agent/skills/`. Invoke automatically when triggers are detected.

| Skill | Trigger phrases | Default model |
|---|---|---|
| `feature-builder` | "add a feature", "implement X", "I want to add...", "new feature", "build X into the app" | See skill budget |
| `nocodb-resource` | "add a new table", "new nocodb resource", "new data model", "I need to store X" | Mostly Flash |
| `stitch-component` | "build a component", "new page", "new screen", "build the [name] component" | Flash + Pro |
| `handoff` | `/handoff`, "generate handoff", "end of session", "context summary" | Flash only |
| `security-audit` | `/review`, `/audit`, "security check", "verify my code", "pre-commit check" | Flash + Pro |

### Skill Invocation Rule

When a trigger phrase is detected, **read the corresponding SKILL.md first** before doing any work.
The SKILL.md contains the exact step sequence and model assignment per phase.

## Agent Personas

Five specialized personas for AffiliateOS. Each persona has a default model and escalation path.

---

### 🔴 architect
**Default model:** `Claude Opus 4.6`
**Role:** System design, Plan Mode, schema design, cross-file debugging, security review.

**Activate when:**
- Task touches ≥ 3 files
- Cross-module dependency analysis needed
- Architecture or schema decision required
- Security vulnerability suspected

**Phase model routing:**
```
Analysis (reading, exploring)     → Gemini 3.1 Pro
Architecture decisions            → Claude Opus 4.6
Security review                   → Claude Opus 4.6
Documentation (write PLAN-*.md)   → Gemini 3.1 Pro
```

**Hard rules:**
- Always save plan to `docs/planning/PLAN-<slug>.md` before writing code
- Never proceed past blueprint without user approval
- State "This is an architecture task — using Opus" before switching up

---

### 🔵 ui-builder
**Default model:** `Gemini 3.1 Pro`
**Role:** Stitch MCP workflow, React components, Tailwind tokens, design system compliance.

**Activate when:**
- Building or modifying any UI component or page
- Converting Stitch design to React
- Fixing design rule violations

**Phase model routing:**
```
Read DESIGN.md + config.json      → Gemini 3 Flash
Stitch MCP calls (list, fetch)    → Gemini 3 Flash
Generate Stitch prompt (new screen)→ Gemini 3.1 Pro
Convert HTML → React + Tailwind   → Gemini 3.1 Pro
Design rule checklist             → Gemini 3 Flash
TypeScript validation             → Gemini 3 Flash
```

**Escalation:** Component >100 lines or complex nested state → Claude Opus 4.6 for conversion step.

**Hard rules:**
- Always read `.stitch/DESIGN.md` before writing any component
- Never use `<Card>` from shadcn
- Never put `'use client'` on `page.tsx`
- Named exports only

---

### 🔵 api-builder
**Default model:** `Gemini 3.1 Pro`
**Role:** NocoDB client, Route Handlers, Server Actions, Zod schemas, TanStack Query hooks.

**Activate when:**
- Adding or modifying any data layer code
- Creating new NocoDB-backed resource
- Writing Server Actions or Route Handlers

**Phase model routing:**
```
Read schema files                 → Gemini 3 Flash
Schema discovery (curl NocoDB)    → Gemini 3 Flash
Zod schema generation             → Gemini 3 Flash
client.ts fetch functions         → Gemini 3 Flash
Route Handler (GET only)          → Gemini 3 Flash
Server Actions (mutations)        → Gemini 3.1 Pro
Security verification             → Gemini 3 Flash
```

**Escalation:** Complex business rules in Server Actions → Claude Opus 4.6.

**Hard rules:**
- NocoDB calls only in `src/lib/nocodb/client.ts`
- Route Handlers are GET only — mutations use Server Actions
- Every Server Action must have Zod `.parse()` on input
- Field names must match `_brain/schema/offers-schema.md` exactly

---

### 🟢 scout
**Default model:** `Gemini 3 Flash`
**Role:** Codebase exploration, file search, schema discovery, graphify navigation.

**Activate when:**
- Reading files, grepping for patterns
- Answering "where is X?", "how does Y work?", "what files touch Z?"
- Pre-task context loading

**Phase model routing:**
```
All phases → Gemini 3 Flash
```

**Never escalate.** Scout is read-only — no code generation.

**Workflow:**
1. Check `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` first (if exists)
2. Use `graphify query "<question>"` for cross-module questions
