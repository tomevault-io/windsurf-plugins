# Field Cut — Claude Code Context

## What this project is

A local web app for audio journalism production. Built for journalists
who record field interviews and produce narrative audio pieces (radio documentary / podcast).

## The pipeline this app automates

1. Upload a WAV or MP3 interview file (any language, 1+ speakers, 10-120 min)
2. Transcribe via OpenAI Whisper API with word-level timestamps
3. Optional: speaker diarization via pyannote (detects who's talking)
4. User clicks words in the transcript UI to mark clip boundaries
5. App cuts the source audio into numbered clip files using ffmpeg
6. User records narration separately, uploads WAV files
7. User uploads narration WAVs and marks narration clips the same way
8. User drags clips and narration into an assembly timeline
9. App assembles everything into a single rough cut WAV via ffmpeg
10. Export: Word doc transcript, paper edit, clips ZIP, rough cut WAV

## Stack

- **Backend**: Python / Flask (app.py)
- **Frontend**: Single HTML template (templates/index.html) — vanilla JS, no framework
- **Audio processing**: ffmpeg (must be installed on the system)
- **Transcription**: OpenAI Whisper API (`whisper-1` model, `verbose_json` format with word + segment timestamps)
- **Speaker diarization**: pyannote.audio (optional, requires HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN)
- **State**: JSON file per project — no database
- **Config**: config.json (app-wide settings like export folder)
- **Port**: 5555

```

## Environment

Requires env variables in `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # required
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_...        # optional, for speaker diarization
```

The app has a first-run setup wizard that creates `.env` if missing.

Run with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Security notes

- All file-serving routes use `safe_project_path()` to prevent path traversal
- `/setup/save_keys` is restricted to localhost only
