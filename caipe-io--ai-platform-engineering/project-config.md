# Safe Git: Protect the User's Working Tree

The user's checked-out branch and working tree are theirs. Before doing any
branch/PR work, make sure you will not lose their edits or churn thousands of
files. The failure that motivated this rule was switching branches across a
**stale local `main` (37 commits behind `origin/main`)**, which rewrote ~3,800
`docs/` files in the user's tree.

## Always (universal — applies to every repo and agent)

- **Never assume local `main` is current.** Run `git fetch origin <base>` and
  branch from the *remote* ref (`origin/main`), not the local one.
- **Preserve uncommitted work.** Run `git status` before any git command. If the
  tree is dirty, do not switch/reset/checkout over those edits — commit, stash
  *with the user's awareness*, or isolate in a worktree instead.
- **Never push to a shared branch.** Push only to feature branches; never
  `push`/`--force` to `origin/main` (or any protected branch).
- **Never rewrite shared history** (`reset --hard`, force-push) on a branch
  others may have pulled.
- **Branch naming:** use the `prebuild/` prefix when the branch should trigger CI
  Docker image builds (see `AGENTS.md`).

## Prefer an isolated worktree when the work is risky or parallel

Reach for a throwaway worktree when you need to *experiment*, run work *in
parallel* with the user's current branch, or when the tree is dirty and you must
not disturb it:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git worktree add /tmp/caipe-<task> origin/main -b prebuild/<feat-branch>
cd /tmp/caipe-<task>          # do edits, commits, pushes here
# when done:
cd -                          # user's repo, untouched
git worktree remove /tmp/caipe-<task>
```

Worktree caveats to handle (don't assume the worktree "just works"):

- **Untracked-but-essential files don't come along.** Gitignored config such as
  `.env` is absent in a fresh worktree — copy or symlink what the task needs.
- **Virtualenvs are not shared.** Per `CLAUDE.md`, each worktree (and each
  subpackage: RAG ingestors/server, MCP agents) needs its own
  `uv venv --python python3.13 --clear .venv && uv sync`.
- `/tmp` is cleared on reboot and duplicates large caches — fine for short tasks,
  not for long-lived state.

## A plain feature branch is acceptable when the base is current and the tree is clean

If `git status` is clean and your base is up to date with `origin`, branching in
the user's repo is normal git flow and is fine:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git switch -c prebuild/<feat-branch> origin/main
```

The point of this rule is **not** "never branch" — it is "never destroy the
user's uncommitted work or branch from a stale base."

## If you only need to *read* another branch/commit

Use `git show <ref>:<path>`, `git diff <ref>`, or `git log <ref>` — these never
touch the working tree. Switch to an edit workflow (branch or worktree) only when
you need to build, edit, or commit.

## Enforcement

Prose rules are advisory. For a hard gate, this repo ships a
`beforeShellExecution` hook (`.cursor/hooks/guard-git-branch-ops.sh`) that pauses
for confirmation on branch/history-mutating git commands while letting read-only
git through. See `.cursor/hooks.json`.

See the `using-git-worktrees` skill for the full isolation procedure.
