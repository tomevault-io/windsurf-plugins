# ltx-overwatch — Development Rules

> These rules are mandatory for ALL development sessions. No exceptions.
> This file is the single source of truth. Update it when anything changes.

## Organisation

- **Company:** Riot Labs Ltd
- **GitHub org:** Punxworx-Holdings-Ltd
- **Owner:** Ben Johnson, CEO — benj@bemoreriot.com
- **Git identity:** Always commit as `benjriot <benj@bemoreriot.com>`
- **Package manager:** npm (NOT pnpm)
- **Node version:** 22

## Workflow Rules

### Git Sync (CRITICAL)
- **Before every task:** `git pull origin main`
- **After every task:** Commit and push immediately. Do not batch.
- Always use git author: `benjriot <benj@bemoreriot.com>`
- Never leave uncommitted work.

### Memory Storage — REPO ONLY, NEVER LOCAL
- Do NOT save memories to local `~/.claude/` directories. They don't sync.
- ALL memory, context, decisions, and learnings go in THIS file (CLAUDE.md).
- The repo is the shared brain. Local files are ephemeral.

### Editing
- Always proceed with file edits without asking — fast, autonomous workflow.
- When merging branches with many conflicts, use parallel agents.
