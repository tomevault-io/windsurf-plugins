## Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Type Safety & Explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
- Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### Error Handling & Debugging

- Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` statements from production code
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
- Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
- Group related code together and separate concerns

### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
- Validate and sanitize user input

### Performance

- Avoid spread syntax in accumulators within loops
- Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them in loops
- Prefer specific imports over namespace imports
- Avoid barrel files (index files that re-export everything)
- Use proper image components (e.g., Next.js `<Image>`) over `<img>` tags

### Framework-Specific Guidance

**Svelte:**
- Use `class` and `for` attributes (not `className` or `htmlFor`)

---

## Testing

- Write assertions inside `it()` or `test()` blocks
- Avoid done callbacks in async tests - use async/await instead
- Don't use `.only` or `.skip` in committed code
- Keep test suites reasonably flat - avoid excessive `describe` nesting

# Context+ MCP - Agent Instructions

## Purpose

You are equipped with the Context+ MCP server. It gives you structural awareness of the entire codebase without reading every file. Follow this workflow strictly to conserve context and maximize accuracy.

## Architecture

The MCP server is built with TypeScript and communicates over stdio using the Model Context Protocol SDK. It has three layers:

**Core Layer** (`src/core/`):

- `parser.ts` - Multi-language symbol extraction via tree-sitter AST with regex fallback. Supports 14+ languages.
- `tree-sitter.ts` - WASM grammar loader for 43 file extensions using web-tree-sitter 0.20.8.
- `walker.ts` - Gitignore-aware recursive directory traversal with depth and target path control.
- `embeddings.ts` - Ollama vector embedding engine with disk cache, cosine similarity search, and API key support.

**Tools Layer** (`src/tools/`):

- `context-tree.ts` - Token-aware structural tree with symbol line ranges and Level 0/1/2 pruning.
- `file-skeleton.ts` - Function signatures with line ranges, without reading full bodies.
- `semantic-search.ts` - Ollama-powered semantic file search with symbol definition lines and 60s cache TTL.
- `semantic-identifiers.ts` - Identifier-level semantic search returning ranked definitions + call chains with line numbers.
- `semantic-navigate.ts` - Browse-by-meaning navigator using spectral clustering and Ollama labeling.
- `blast-radius.ts` - Symbol usage tracer across the entire codebase.
- `static-analysis.ts` - Native linter runner (tsc, eslint, py_compile, cargo check, go vet).
- `propose-commit.ts` - Code gatekeeper validating headers, FEATURE tag, no inline comments, nesting, file length.
- `feature-hub.ts` - Obsidian-style feature hub navigator with bundled skeleton views.
- `memory-tools.ts` - Memory graph MCP wrappers (upsert, relate, search, prune, interlink, traverse).

The memory graph is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system. Agents MUST use `search_memory_graph` at the start of every task to retrieve prior context, and persist learnings with `upsert_memory_node` and `create_relation` after completing work. This prevents redundant exploration and builds cumulative knowledge across sessions.

**Core Layer** (continued):

- `hub.ts` - Wikilink parser for `[[path]]` links, cross-link tags, hub discovery, orphan detection.
- `memory-graph.ts` - In-memory property graph with JSON persistence, decay scoring, and auto-similarity edges.

**Git Layer** (`src/git/`):

- `shadow.ts` - Shadow restore point system for undo without touching git history.

**Entry Point**: `src/index.ts` registers 17 MCP tools and starts the stdio transport. Accepts an optional CLI argument for the target project root directory (defaults to `process.cwd()`).

## Environment Variables

| Variable                                | Default            | Description                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL`                    | `nomic-embed-text` | Embedding model name                                          |
| `OLLAMA_API_KEY`                        | (empty)            | Cloud auth (auto-detected by SDK)                             |
| `OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL`                     | `llama3.2`         | Chat model for cluster labeling                               |
| `CONTEXTPLUS_EMBED_BATCH_SIZE`          | `8`                | Embedding batch per GPU call (hard-capped to 5-10)            |
| `CONTEXTPLUS_EMBED_TRACKER`             | `true`             | Enable realtime embedding updates for changed files/functions |
| `CONTEXTPLUS_EMBED_TRACKER_MAX_FILES`   | `8`                | Max changed files per tracker tick (hard-capped to 5-10)      |
| `CONTEXTPLUS_EMBED_TRACKER_DEBOUNCE_MS` | `700`              | Debounce before applying tracker refresh                      |

Runtime cache: `.mcp_data/` is created at MCP startup and stores reusable embedding vectors for files, identifiers, and call sites. A realtime tracker watches file updates and refreshes changed function/file embeddings incrementally.

## Fast Execute Mode (Mandatory)

Default to execution-first behavior. Use minimal tokens, minimal narration, and maximum tool leverage.

1. Skip long planning prose. Start with lightweight scoping: `get_context_tree` and `get_file_skeleton`.
2. Run independent discovery operations in parallel whenever possible (for example, multiple searches/reads).
3. Prefer structural tools over full-file reads to conserve context.
4. Before modifying or deleting symbols, run `get_blast_radius`.
5. Write changes through `propose_commit` only.
6. Run `run_static_analysis` once after edits, or once per changed module for larger refactors.

### Execution Rules

1. Think less, execute sooner: make the smallest safe change that can be validated quickly.
2. Do not serialize 10 independent commands; batch parallelizable reads/searches.
3. If a command fails, avoid blind retry loops. Diagnose once, pivot strategy, continue.
4. Cap retry attempts for the same failing operation to 1-2 unless new evidence appears.
5. Keep outputs concise: short status updates, no verbose reasoning dumps.

### Token-Efficiency Rules

1. Treat 100 effective tokens as better than 1000 vague tokens.
2. Use high-signal tool calls first (`get_file_skeleton`, `get_context_tree`, `get_blast_radius`).
3. Read full file bodies only when signatures/structure are insufficient.
4. Avoid repeated scans of unchanged areas.
5. Prefer direct edits + deterministic validation over extended speculative analysis.

## Strict Formatting Rules

### File Header (Mandatory)

Every file MUST start with exactly 2 comment lines (10 words each) explaining the file:

```
// Regex-based symbol extraction engine for multi-language AST parsing
// FEATURE: Core parsing layer for structural code analysis
```

Line 1: What the file does.
Line 2: `FEATURE: <name>` - the primary feature it belongs to. Links to hub.

### Zero Comments

No comments anywhere in the file except the 2-line header. No inline comments, no block comments, no TODO markers.

### Code Ordering

Strict order within every file:

1. Imports
2. Enums
3. Interfaces / Types
4. Constants
5. Functions / Classes

### Abstraction Thresholds

- **Under 20 lines, used once**: INLINE it. Do not extract into a function.
- **Under 20 lines, used multiple times**: Extract into a reusable function.
- **Over 30 lines**: Extract into its own function or file.
- **Max nesting**: 3-4 levels. Flatten deep nesting.
- **Max file length**: 500-1000 lines. Split larger files.
- **Max files per directory**: 10. Use subdirectories for organization.

### Variable Discipline

- No redundant intermediate variables. Chain calls: `c = g(f(a))` instead of `b = f(a); c = g(b)`.
- Exception: Keep intermediate variables that represent distinct, meaningful states.
- Remove all unused variables, imports, and files before finishing.

| `propose_commit`             | The ONLY way to save files. Validates before writing.                              |
| `list_restore_points`        | See undo history.                                                                  |
| `undo_change`                | Revert a bad AI change without touching git.                                       |
| `get_feature_hub`            | Browse feature graph hubs. Find orphaned files.                                    |
| `upsert_memory_node`         | Create/update memory nodes (concept, file, symbol, note) with auto-embedding.      |
| `create_relation`            | Create typed edges between memory nodes (depends_on, implements, etc).             |
| `search_memory_graph`        | Semantic search + graph traversal across 1st/2nd-degree neighbors.                 |
| `prune_stale_links`          | Remove decayed edges (e^(-λt)) and orphan nodes periodically.                      |
| `add_interlinked_context`    | Bulk-add nodes with auto-similarity linking (cosine ≥ 0.72).                       |
| `retrieve_with_traversal`    | Start from a node, walk outward, return scored neighbors by decay and depth.       |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. Reading entire files without checking the skeleton first.
2. Deleting functions without checking blast radius.
3. Creating small helper functions that are only used once.
4. Writing inline comments anywhere in the code.
5. Wrapping simple logic in 10 layers of abstraction or nesting.
6. Leaving unused imports or variables after a refactor.
7. Creating more than 10 files in a single directory.
8. Writing files longer than 1000 lines.
9. Running independent commands sequentially when they can be parallelized.
10. Repeating failed terminal commands without changing inputs or approach.

## Priority Reminder

Execute ASAP with the least tokens possible.
Use structural/context tools strategically, then patch and validate.
Avoid over-planning unless the task is ambiguous or high-risk.
