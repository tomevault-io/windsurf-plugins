# AGENTS.md — guidance for AI agents working in this repo

## What this project is

`drawpad` is a Go CLI that opens a small Chrome window with an Excalidraw
canvas so an AI agent and a human can collaborate on a diagram. The
`drawpad` binary is on `PATH` — invoke it directly as `drawpad`, never as
`bin/drawpad` or an absolute path. See `drawpad --help` for the user-facing
contract (it is written for both humans and agents — read it before
invoking the tool).

## Use `drawpad` to talk back to the user when a picture beats text

This repo ships a tool whose entire purpose is visual communication with the
user. When you are operating in this repo (or anywhere `drawpad` is on
PATH), **reach for it whenever a diagram would land faster than prose**.
Concrete triggers:

- **Architecture showcases.** Before writing or refactoring multi-component
  code, sketch the layering / module graph in `drawpad` and ask the user to
  confirm or red-line it. Cheaper than writing the wrong code.
- **Design decisions with tradeoffs.** When two or three structural options
  exist, draw them side by side and let the user point at the one they want
  (or annotate "no, like this").
- **Flows, sequences, state machines.** Boxes and arrows convey ordering
  better than numbered lists.
- **UI / UX proposals.** Wireframe the page in `drawpad` instead of
  describing it. The user will fix proportions and labels with one mouse
  drag.
- **Asking the user to sketch their idea.** Hand them a blank canvas with
  `--prompt "draw what you want"`. Their scribble + one-line comment will
  unstick you faster than three rounds of clarifying questions.

Don't use `drawpad` for trivial confirmations, things that fit in one line
of text, or when no display is available (e.g. CI, headless SSH).

## How to invoke it

```bash
drawpad \
  --prompt   "Question shown above the canvas." \
  --initial  scene.json \              # optional; omit for a blank canvas
  --output   result.json \             # or omit / "-" for stdout
  --screenshot-dir ./screenshots
```

## What you get back

The CLI exits with:

- **0** — user clicked Send. `result.json` has `scene`, `comment`,
  `screenshotPath`, `cancelled:false`. **Read the screenshot** (absolute PNG
  path) to actually see what the user produced. **Read `comment`** as their
  primary natural-language reply.
- **2** — user cancelled or closed the window. `cancelled:true`. Don't pretend
  they confirmed; fall back to asking in text.
- **1** — config / I/O error; stderr explains.

## Where to put one-shot generators

One-shot scene generators (the throwaway `main.go` you write to produce
an initial scene for a single `drawpad` call) **must live under `/tmp/`**,
not inside the repo. That keeps `git status` clean and leaves nothing for
a follow-up agent to garbage-collect. Recommended layout:

```
/tmp/drawpad-<slug>/main.go        ← the generator (self-contained)
/tmp/drawpad-<slug>/go.mod         ← `go mod init scratch`
/tmp/drawpad-<slug>/result.json    ← --output target
/tmp/drawpad-<slug>/screenshots/   ← --screenshot-dir target
```

**Self-contained means no imports of this repo.** `internal/diagram` is
unreachable from `/tmp/` (Go's `internal/` rule blocks importers outside
the module tree, and a `replace` directive does not relax it). Emit the
Excalidraw JSON directly — the schema is just a `{type, version,
elements, appState}` envelope and each element is a plain map. Crib the
field shapes from `internal/diagram/elements.go` and inline the few
helpers you need (UUID-style IDs, `boundElements` / `containerId`
wiring for labels, `startBinding` / `endBinding` for arrows).

Build and run from there, e.g.:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/drawpad-<slug> && cd /tmp/drawpad-<slug>
go mod init scratch
go run . \
  | drawpad --initial - \
            --output    result.json \
            --screenshot-dir screenshots
```

If a generator is genuinely worth keeping as a reference for future
agents, ask the user before promoting it from `/tmp/` into
`cmd/build-*/` — the surviving worked examples live there
(`cmd/build-architecture/main.go`, `cmd/build-webapp-ui/main.go`).

## Dogfooding when developing this tool

If you are working on `drawpad` itself and have a non-trivial design
choice (where to put a new abstraction, how to layer a feature, what a new
window should look like), **use `drawpad` to propose it to the user**. The
tool exists precisely for this kind of exchange.

## Code conventions

- Tests favour real integration over mocks: parse real Excalidraw JSON,
  drive the server through `httptest`, exercise the orchestrator end-to-end
  by stubbing only the browser `LaunchFunc`. Match that style when adding
  features.
- Run `go test -race ./...` before declaring work done.
- Layered architecture (game-engine style, bottom-up): `diagram → session →
  server → web → browser → app → cmd/drawpad`. New code goes into the
  lowest layer that makes sense; don't reach upward.
