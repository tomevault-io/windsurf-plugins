# Advanced Image-Only Product Recognition Pipeline

## Project Overview
This is an advanced ML-powered image search system using **pure visual processing** for fine-grained product matching. The system leverages multi-image aggregation, texture-aware feature extraction, and hierarchical attention mechanisms to achieve superior accuracy in product recognition, particularly for textile patterns and clothing items.

## Core Architecture
- **Multi-Image Visual Aggregation**: Hierarchical attention pooling across multiple product views
- **Texture-Aware Feature Extraction**: Multi-scale CLIP adaptation for fabric/pattern recognition  
- **Advanced FAISS Indexing**: IVF-PQ configuration optimized for texture discrimination
- **Neural Attention Components**: Custom PyTorch modules for visual feature aggregation
- **API Backend**: FastAPI serving real-time visual search requests
- **Frontend UI**: Gradio interface for image-based product queries

## Key Technologies
- **Visual Understanding**: OpenAI CLIP with multi-layer feature fusion and texture enhancement
- **Similarity Search**: FAISS IVF-PQ indexing for compressed high-accuracy search
- **Neural Components**: PyTorch modules for attention-based aggregation
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async processing for real-time queries
- **Frontend**: Gradio for ML demo interface
- **Data Input**: Multi-image CSV with Shopify product data

## Development Phases
1. **Phase 0**: CSV data preparation and multi-image validation
2. **Phase 1**: Advanced feature extraction and neural aggregation pipeline
3. **Phase 2**: Texture-aware FAISS index construction  
4. **Phase 3**: Real-time API with attention-based search
5. **Phase 4**: User-facing interface with visual similarity display

## Data Input Format
- **shopify_product_id**: Unique product identifier (string)
- **title**: Product name/description (string)
- **images**: Array of multiple product view URLs (JSON string)
- **preview_image**: Primary product image URL (string)
- **Focus**: Checked shirts POC with 94% accuracy target

## Performance Targets
- **Top-1 Accuracy**: >92% on checked shirt verification
- **Texture Recall**: >89% for pattern discrimination  
- **Query Latency**: <180ms on consumer CPU hardware
- **Index Compression**: 18MB for 16k products (vs 32MB baseline)
- **False Positive Reduction**: 38% improvement over vanilla CLIP
