This project contains the implementation of ios-build-verify, a skill intended for iOS-development use in Claude Code.

Josh Adams is the author and maintainer of ios-build-verify.

The skill bundles two halves of the iOS agentic-coding loop. The build half pipes `xcodebuild` through `xcbeautify` for token-cheap building and unit testing, with raw output mirrored to a build.log file as a diagnostic fallback. The verify half pairs AXe, a Swift-native simulator-automation CLI, with `xcrun simctl` and exposes them through named-intent operations: launch the app, tap a control by its accessibility identifier, read or set a field's value, verify a screen has loaded, screenshot a named view, and audit a view for missing accessibility modifiers. State checks read AXe's `describe-ui` accessibility-tree dump rather than screenshots, favoring text before pixels. Screenshots land on disk and are read only when layout, typography, color, or spacing are actually under review.

## Repository layout

- `skills/ios-build-verify/SKILL.md` — canonical reference for every operation, exit code, and worked example. Authoritative (~107K); consult it before inferring semantics from script filenames.
- `skills/ios-build-verify/scripts/` — bash entrypoints for every operation. Scripts whose names start with `_` (e.g., `_resolve_udid.sh`, `_check_pill_overlap.sh`, `_classify_present_ids.sh`) are sourced helpers, not standalone commands; reach them through the public scripts that source them.
- `skills/ios-build-verify/data/coordinates.json` — per-project tab-pill coordinate data, edited per project.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest. Bump `version` on release.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — marketplace listing.
- `prompts/` — validation-session writeups; not loaded by the skill at runtime.

## Runtime contract

- Every script reads `$(pwd)/.claude/ios-build-verify.config.sh` and exits 2 if it is missing. Required fields: `APP_NAME`, `BUNDLE_ID`, `SCHEME`, `TARGET_SIM`, `FIRST_SCREEN_ID`. Run `setup_project.sh` first to write it.
- Verify-half ops require a simulator named `TARGET_SIM` to be booted; `_resolve_udid.sh` exits 3 otherwise. Run `launch_app.sh` (which boots and installs) before any tap / read / verify op.
- `launch_app.sh` exits 4 if the built `.app` is missing. Run `build_app.sh` first.
- `calibrate.sh` requires Python Pillow; `measure_tab_pill.sh` exits 4 with install instructions if missing. Calibration is a once-per-project step.
- `smoke_test.sh` is the canonical end-to-end smoke probe: build → launch → screenshot → per-tab tap+screenshot+assertion → terminate, with per-step ✓/✗ output and SKILL.md hints on failure. Run it on a new project before composing ad-hoc validation flows; rerun whenever you want to confirm the app still drives end-to-end. Distinct from `calibrate.sh` (one-time setup that *writes* `MAIN_TABS_COORDS`); `smoke_test.sh` reads config, doesn't modify it.
- Public scripts use `set -euo pipefail`. Follow the convention in any new script.
- Standard exit codes used across named-intent ops: `2` = config / argument problem; `3` = no booted simulator matches `TARGET_SIM`; `4` = identifier or required state not present in the AXTree (carries the "present AXUniqueIds in the tree" classifying hint); `5` = launch anchor (`FIRST_SCREEN_ID`) never appeared within `WAIT_FOR_RENDER_BUDGET_S`; `6` = read-back / value mismatch; `7` = state probe (e.g., tab-pill overlap, segment-not-selected); `8` = `tap_xy.sh --verify-target` / `--verify-role` mismatch (the AXLabel or role under the tap coordinate didn't match what was asserted; no tap dispatched).

## Common verify-half friction

Every item below is a silent or near-silent failure mode that costs an agent real time on first encounter. Each is one-liner here; full treatment lives in SKILL.md and the validation writeups under `prompts/`.

- **Logical points, not pixels.** `axe tap` / `axe swipe` / `axe describe-ui` take logical points; `xcrun simctl io <UDID> screenshot` writes pixels at the device's retina scale (3× on iPhone 17 / 17 Pro / 17 Plus). Divide screenshot pixel coords by the scale factor, or read a logical-point frame directly via `describe_ui.sh --point <x>,<y>`. Full treatment plus AXLabel-search recipe: SKILL.md "Coordinate space: logical points, not pixels."
- **Empty AXTree on launch = modal gating.** `launch_app.sh` exit 5 with `children: []` means a modal (review prompt, onboarding, system alert, IAP paywall, custom permission primer) is gating describe-ui before `FIRST_SCREEN_ID` can be polled. The full-tree dump is empty; reach the dismiss button via `describe_ui.sh --point <x>,<y>`. See SKILL.md "Common first-real-app friction" item 6.
- **iOS 26 SwiftUI `TabView(.page)` cannot be advanced by `axe swipe`.** Gesture executes but the page coordinator rejects it; page-indicator dots are not hit-testable. `swipe_page_tabview.sh` is the fail-fast diagnostic — it swipes wide and slow, then fingerprints the AXTree and exits 7 if unchanged. Recovery options and full treatment: SKILL.md "Common first-real-app friction" item 7.
