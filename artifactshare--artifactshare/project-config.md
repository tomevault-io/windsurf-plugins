# Public repository instructions

- Product-development constraints: see [`docs/reference/development-constraints.md`](docs/reference/development-constraints.md).

- Keep credentials, secret values, customer context, private documents, and private-only URLs out of this repository. Production topology, non-secret resource identifiers, deployment configuration, and deployment automation may be reviewed and maintained here when they are intended to be public.
- Production writes must use the protected GitHub `production` Environment and the staged deployment workflow. Do not run production commands from an ordinary development shell.
- Install dependencies with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Before declaring a change complete, run the local validation selected by `docs/development-workflow.md`; the merge queue remains the source of truth for full validation. Product UI changes must keep React Doctor at zero warnings and errors.
- Use the repository [Controlled Review skill](.agents/skills/controlled-review/SKILL.md) for orchestrated reviews, including when a personal skill with the same name is installed. The implementation gate's Claude side runs Claude Code's `/code-review` instead, as `docs/development-workflow.md` describes. The calling orchestrator owns conditions, role assignments, and finding dispositions.
- Review implementation, user-visible behavior, tests, security boundaries, and maintainability. Keep pull-request descriptions to the implementation, its generalized visible effect, validation results, and any workflow usage included.
- Classify and run maintainer changes with `docs/development-workflow.md`, which is the source of truth for proportional specification, review, and validation. Initialize the branch objective scope when the boundary-sensitive implementation review applies; every review must use a committed, clean worktree, and spec review records the clean checkout as reference context for a fixed Artifact Share version.
- Follow the writing and contribution rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and the nearest directory instructions.
