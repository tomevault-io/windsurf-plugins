# Repository Instructions

- Treat all Markdown and Chinese text files in this repository as UTF-8.
- On Windows PowerShell, read text files with explicit encoding, for example `Get-Content -Encoding UTF8`.
- Do not assume a file is corrupted just because default PowerShell output shows mojibake; verify with explicit UTF-8 decoding before editing.
- Preserve UTF-8 when editing documentation. Prefer LF unless the existing file requires otherwise.
