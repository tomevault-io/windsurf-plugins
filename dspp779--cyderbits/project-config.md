# Cyder Wine engine (sibling repo)

This CyderBits repo is the application layer. The Wine engine that actually
runs `.exe` files is [cyder-wine-engine](https://github.com/dspp779/cyder-wine-engine)
(`../cyder-wine-engine` or `/Users/jjc/cyder-wine-engine`).

Before engine / wineserver / ntdll / pack work:

1. Prefer operating in the `cyder-wine-engine` checkout.
2. Read `cyder-wine-engine/AGENTS.md` and
   `cyder-wine-engine/docs/incremental-build-and-patches.md`.
3. Do not ad-hoc rebuild host Mach-O without that repo’s `.env` / minOS 10.15
   rules.
