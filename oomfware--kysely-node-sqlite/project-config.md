kysely-node-sqlite is a Kysely dialect for node:sqlite, built with TypeScript.

the source code is organized under `src/`.

## development notes

### project management

- tools like Node.js, Bun and pnpm are managed by mise
- build with `pnpm run build` (tsdown)
- typecheck with `pnpm run typecheck` (tsc)
- format with `pnpm run fmt` (oxfmt)
- lint with `pnpm run lint` (oxlint)
- check `pnpm view <package>` before adding a new dependency

### code writing

- new files should be in kebab-case
- use tabs for indentation, spaces allowed for diagrams in comments
- use single quotes for strings; use template literals for localization strings (user-facing
  strings, error messages)
- add trailing commas
- prefer arrow functions, but use regular methods in classes unless arrow functions are necessary
  (e.g., when passing the method as a callback that needs `this` binding)
- use braces for control statements, even single-line bodies
- use bare blocks `{ }` to group related code and limit variable scope
- avoid barrel exports (index files that re-export from other modules); import directly from source
- use `// #region <name>` and `// #endregion` to denote regions when a file needs to contain a lot
  of code
- a parameter should be optional only when callers genuinely split between passing a value and
  relying on the default; if every caller passes a value, make it required; if no caller would ever
  change it, it should not be a parameter at all
- avoid optional parameters that change behavioral modes or make the function do different things
  based on presence/absence; prefer a separate function with a clearer name instead
- avoid type assertions (`as Type`, `as const`) unless TypeScript actually errors without them; when
  it does error, prefer finding a solution that satisfies the type system naturally before resorting
  to an assertion

### documentation

- documentations include README, code comments, commit messages
- any writing should be in lowercase, except for proper nouns, acronyms and 'I'; this does not apply
  to public-facing interfaces like web UI
- only comment non-trivial code, focusing on _why_ rather than _what_
- write comments and JSDoc in lowercase (except proper nouns, acronyms, and 'I')
- add JSDoc comments to new publicly exported functions, methods, classes, fields, and enums
- JSDoc should include proper annotations:
  - use `@param` for parameters (no dashes after param names)
  - use `@returns` for return values
  - use `@throws` for exceptions when applicable
  - keep descriptions concise but informative

### agentic coding

- `.research/` directory in the project root serves as a workspace for temporary experiments,
  analysis, and planning materials. create if not present (it's gitignored). this directory may
  contain cloned repositories or other reference materials that can help inform implementation
  decisions
- this document is intentionally incomplete; discover everything else in the repo
- don't make assumptions or speculate about code, plans, or requirements without exploring first;
  pause and ask for clarification when you're still unsure after looking into it
- in plan mode, present the plan for review before exiting to allow for feedback or follow-up
  questions
- when debugging problems, isolate the root cause first before attempting fixes: add logging,
  reproduce the issue, narrow down the scope, and confirm the exact source of the problem

### Claude Code-specific

- Explore subagent may not be accurate; verify findings as needed
- never spawn subagents to read and return file contents; read files directly in the main context.
  subagents should perform searches or answer specific questions, not act as file I/O proxies
