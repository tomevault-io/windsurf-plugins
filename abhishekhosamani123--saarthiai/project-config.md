## 🎯 Expected Behavior with Gemini

### Normal Response (No Gemini):
```
In Andhra Pradesh, district X, rice was produced...
```

### With Gemini Enhanced:
```
Based on the agricultural data from Andhra Pradesh, specifically the East Godavari 
district, rice production during the 2010 Kharif season was substantial. The crop 
was cultivated across 150 hectares, yielding 450 tons. This represents a productive 
farming season with approximately 3.0 tons per hectare...
```

## ⚠️ If You See Errors

### Check 1: Internet Connection
Gemini needs internet to work

### Check 2: API Key Valid
Check your key at: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

### Check 3: Backend Console
Look for error messages like:
- "Gemini not available"
- "API key invalid"
- "Network error"

### Fallback
If Gemini fails, it will automatically use the basic Q&A system.

## 🧪 Test Questions

1. "What is rice production in Andhra Pradesh?"
   - Should give enhanced, natural response

2. "Explain soil health in Kerala"
   - Should provide detailed explanation

3. "Compare wheat in Punjab and Haryana"
   - Should give intelligent comparison

---

## 📊 Enable/Disable Gemini

To disable Gemini (use basic mode):
- Edit `app/backend/app.py` line 98
- Change `True` to `False`

Or in frontend, the request already sends `use_gemini: true`

---

## ✅ Status

- ✅ Gemini enabled by default
- ✅ Frontend configured
- ✅ Error handling in place
- ✅ Fallback available
- ✅ Better responses expected

Enjoy your enhanced AI assistant! 🤖
