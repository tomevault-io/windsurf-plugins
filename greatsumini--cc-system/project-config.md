# `docs/findings/` — Working Protocol

This directory holds **debt-and-insight queue documents**: things noticed
during a goal iteration that are out-of-scope for the current goal but
must not be lost. A finding lives here until it is either promoted into a
goal, closed in code, or archived.

Findings are not goals. They have no enumerated gates, they do not gate
`completion-check.sh`, and they can be edited freely by anyone who picks
one up. They are a **queue**, not a contract.

---

## Filename convention

```
docs/findings/<UTC-created-at>-<slug>.md
```

- `<UTC-created-at>` — `YYYY-MM-DDTHHMM` (no seconds, no colon, UTC).
  Derive from the original commit:
  `git log --diff-filter=A --follow --format='%aI' -- <file>`, converted
  to UTC.
- `<slug>` — short, lowercase, hyphenated. Don't duplicate the date in
  the slug — the prefix already encodes it.

Examples:

```
2026-05-21T1635-perf-log.md
2026-05-22T1632-dogfood-snapshot.md
2026-05-23T1700-gates-over-coupling.md
```

## Frontmatter schema

Every finding **must** start with a YAML frontmatter block. Fields:

| Field          | Type                      | Required | Default | Notes                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`        | string                    | yes      | —       | Mirrors the `# H1` heading; quote if it contains `:` or special chars.                                                 |
| `created_at`   | ISO-8601 UTC              | yes      | —       | Format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. Must match the filename prefix to the minute.                                           |
| `resolved`     | `boolean \| "partial"`    | yes      | —       | `false` until every item closes; `partial` only with `status_notes` enumerating remaining open items; `true` at close. |
| `priority`     | `P0 \| P1 \| P2`          | no       | —       | Omit for P2-ish cleanup. `P0` = data-integrity / chain-blocker; `P1` = pre-release hazard; `P2` = post-release cleanup. |
| `resolved_by`  | string or list of strings | no       | —       | Commit SHA(s) that resolved the finding; strongly recommended when flipping `resolved: true`.                          |
| `was`          | repo-rooted path          | no       | —       | Previous goal path (`goals/<n>-<name>.md`) when a promoted goal dissolved back into the queue.                         |
| `kind`         | string                    | no       | finding | `snapshot` for frozen audit/dogfood runs; `append-only-log` for telemetry. Neither is a "resolve" target.              |
| `status_notes` | multi-line string         | no       | —       | Required when only a _subset_ of items is closed — name which are still open.                                          |
| `related`      | list of paths             | no       | —       | Other findings, goals, docs, or source paths the reader should jump to.                                                |

Minimal template:

```yaml
---
title: <short noun phrase>
created_at: 2026-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
resolved: false
priority: P2
related:
  - docs/<other-doc>.md
---
# <Same as title>
```

With explicit priority + partial-closure notes:

```yaml
---
title: <noun phrase>
created_at: 2026-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
resolved: partial
priority: P1
resolved_by:
  - <sha>
status_notes: |
  Item 1 — open.
  Item 2 — CLOSED on YYYY-MM-DD (commit <sha>, gate <id>).
related:
  - goals/<n>-<name>.md
---
```

## Body structure

Required:

1. **`# H1` title** — matches the frontmatter `title`.
2. **TL;DR** (1–3 sentences) — what's broken / queued, and why it isn't
   fixed yet.
3. **Body** — concrete reproducer with **file:line** references for every
   claim. If you cannot point at a file/line, you do not have a finding
   yet — you have a hunch.

Recommended (use when relevant):

4. **Options / Recommendation** — when the resolution is debated, list
   the candidate paths and call out a recommended one.
5. **Acceptance signal** — how a future agent confirms the finding is
   actually closed. Avoid "tests pass" alone; name the specific test or
   grep that flips from red to green.
6. **Migration plan** — if the resolution is a multi-step refactor,
   sketch the order so a future goal author has a starting point.

Each finding should be **scannable in 60 seconds.** If yours runs past
~400 lines, split it.

---

## Honesty rules

- **Verify against code before claiming closure.** A doc may say "Goal X
  closes A1" — that's a _plan_, not a fact. Run `grep`/Read on the cited
  file:line and confirm the change landed before marking `resolved: true`.
- **Forward-looking markers.** When an item is scoped by a goal that has
  not yet merged, label it `_(Goal <n> will close)_` inline and keep it
  under "Open" — do not pretend it's closed.
- **Quote your evidence.** When you flip an item to closed, paste the
  matching `<file>:<line>` or test name so the next reader can re-verify
  in seconds.
- **No silent bullet removal.** If you delete a bullet from a finding, the
