## Product Requirements

See `prd.md` for the full product requirements document.

## MCP Servers

This project uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to extend AI capabilities. These are automatically invoked when relevant.

### Context7 Documentation Server

**When to use:**
- Looking up library documentation (e.g., "How do I use pydantic-ai streaming?")
- Checking API references for dependencies
- Finding code examples from official docs
- Verifying correct usage of third-party packages

**Examples:**
- "What's the latest pydantic-ai agent syntax?"
- "Show me httpx async client examples"
- "How do I configure pytest-asyncio?"

### GitHub Repository Server

**When to use:**
- Checking open/closed issues in this repository
- Reviewing pull requests and their status
- Reading issue comments and discussions
- Finding related issues or PRs
- Understanding project history and decisions

**Examples:**
- "What are the open issues about curiosity?"
- "Show me recent PRs related to PDF support"
- "Are there any issues about MLX integration?"
- "What's the status of issue #13?"

### Best Practices

- **Be specific:** "Check issue #15" is better than "check issues"
- **Context first:** Read codebase with `@Codebase` before checking issues
- **Combine sources:** Use Context7 for "how to use X" and GitHub for "what's our approach to X"
