## Testing with Pytest

## Testing Principles

- **Reuse, Don't Replicate**: Tests should reuse as much functional code as possible. Avoid reimplementing application logic within a test. Import and call the actual functions and classes you intend to test.
- **Mock Fundamental Processes**: When isolating code for a unit test, mock the most fundamental external interaction. For example, mock the `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` call for a command-line tool, not a higher-level function that wraps it. This ensures you are testing your application's error handling and response parsing logic.
- **Cover All Failure Modes**: Every test suite should cover not just the "happy path" but also all conceivable failure modes. Use `pytest.raises` to verify that your code correctly handles non-zero return codes, missing commands (`FileNotFoundError`), network errors, and other exceptional conditions.

### Test Structure
```python
@pytest.mark.vcr()  # For tests using VCR cassettes
@pytest.mark.asyncio  # For async tests
async def test_feature() -> None:
    """Test description."""
    # Arrange
    ...
    
    # Act
    result = await some_function()
    
    # Assert
    assert result is not None
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Skip tests requiring paid APIs
uv run pytest -m "not paid"

# Run specific test
uv run pytest tests/test_utils.py::test_fetch_content -v
```

### Markers
- `@pytest.mark.paid` - Requires paid API keys (skipped in CI)
- `@pytest.mark.ollama` - Requires local Ollama (skipped in CI)
- `@pytest.mark.searxng` - Requires local SearXNG (skipped in CI)
- `@pytest.mark.vcr()` - Uses VCR cassettes for HTTP recording

### VCR Cassettes
- Location: `tests/cassettes/`
- Record mode: `'none'` (playback only by default)
- Hostname normalization in `conftest.py` handles `host.docker.internal` → `localhost`
- Deterministic tests: set `temperature=0.0` in `MODEL_SETTINGS`

### Coverage Requirements

**After writing or modifying tests**, verify coverage targets are met:

1. **Read coverage targets** from `.codecov.yaml` to determine:
   - `coverage.status.project.default.target` - minimum overall project coverage
   - `coverage.status.project.default.threshold` - allowed coverage drop tolerance
   - `coverage.status.patch.default.target` - minimum coverage for new/modified code

2. **Run coverage report**:
```bash
# Full project coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src/deepresearcher2 --cov-report=term-missing

# Specific module coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src/deepresearcher2/MODULE_NAME --cov-report=term-missing tests/test_MODULE_NAME.py
```

3. **Verify targets are met**:
   - New code must meet the **patch target** from `.codecov.yaml`
   - Overall coverage must not drop below **project target minus threshold**
   - Focus coverage on critical paths: error handling, edge cases, and main functionality
