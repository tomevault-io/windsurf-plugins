description: how to write api routes
---

- our api routes are under `app/api`
- like our pages, api routes use kebab-casing
- our apis are RESTful and should be as simple as possible
- use zod schema to parse requests
- use `parseSearchParams` from `zod-search-params` to parse search params
- api routes contain as little logic as possible and act as request/response parser. The main data logic should be under `lib/api`
- it should only contain routes. ALL other utilities and core business logic and even helper functions should be in `lib/`
- use `createSuccessResponse` and `createErrorResponse` in @api_response.ts and a try block, like so:
```
try {
  return createSuccessResponse(await someApi(parsedParams));
} catch (error) {
  return createErrorResponse(error);

}

```
