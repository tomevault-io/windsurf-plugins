# Ailloy — AI Agent Instructions

Ailloy is the package manager for AI instructions. This project uses Ailloy blanks for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Behavioral Contract

@features.md

`features.md` is the terse, code-backed contract of ailloy's user-facing behaviors — read it before changing any feature so you don't regress existing behavior.

**Standing rule: keep `features.md` current.** Whenever you add a feature, or introduce or change a behavior or user expectation, update `features.md` in the SAME change. Every claim in it must be backed by the actual code. Treat it as part of the definition of done.

## Available Commands

The following command blanks are available in the `.claude/commands/` directory:

- **brainstorm**: Analyze an idea for feasibility, scope, and value using structured brainstorming techniques
- **create-issue**: Generate well-formatted GitHub issues with proper structure
- **start-issue**: Fetch GitHub issue details and begin implementation
- **open-pr**: Create pull requests with structured descriptions
- **pr-description**: Generate comprehensive PR descriptions
- **pr-comments**: Respond to PR review comments efficiently
- **pr-review**: Conduct comprehensive code reviews with silent/interactive modes
- **preflight**: Pre-flight checks and setup
- **update-pr**: Update existing pull requests

## Available Skills

The following skills are available in the `.claude/skills/` directory:

- **brainstorm**: Structured brainstorming methodology for evaluating ideas using freewriting, cubing, and journalistic techniques
- **add-ailloy-blank**: Guided workflow for creating new Ailloy blanks with proper mold structure

## Workflow Blanks

The following workflow blanks are available in the [official mold](https://github.com/nimble-giant/nimble-mold) and can be installed into a project's `.github/workflows/` via `ailloy cast --with-workflows`:

- **claude-code**: GitHub Actions workflow for the Claude Code agent (responds to @claude mentions in issues and PRs)
- **claude-code-review**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated PR reviews with Claude Code agent. Features brevity-focused formatting, collapsible sections, and comment management (updates summary, creates replies).

## CLI Commands

Key CLI commands for working with molds:

- **mold new** (`mold create`): Scaffold a new mold directory with boilerplate
- **mold list**: List available molds
- **mold show**: Display a mold's content
- **cast** (`install`): Install molds into a project
- **forge** (`template`): Preview rendered output (dry run)
- **assay** (`lint`): Lint AI instruction files against best practices
- **temper** (`validate`): Validate a mold or ingot package; use `--assay` (alias: `--lint`) to also render and assay output
- **anneal** (`configure`): Configure flux variables interactively
- **smelt** (`package`): Package a mold for distribution
- **recast**: Re-resolve installed molds to newer versions AND re-render their content (alias: `upgrade`); refreshes `.ailloy/installed.yaml` and (if present) `ailloy.lock`. Accepts `--set`, `--values`/`-f`, `--with-workflows`, and `--force-replace-on-parse-error` — flags layer on top of the options the original cast recorded in the manifest.
- **quench**: Opt in to `ailloy.lock` by pinning everything in `.ailloy/installed.yaml`; supports `--verify` (CI drift check) and `--global`
- **evolve** (`reinstall`): Self-upgrade the ailloy CLI binary in place from the latest GitHub release; supports `--check`, `--version`, `--force`, and `--no-animate`. Refuses on Homebrew installs (use `brew upgrade nimble-giant/tap/ailloy`)
- **cache clear**: Clear ailloy's on-disk cache (mold artifacts and foundry indexes under `~/.ailloy/cache/`). Supports `--molds`, `--indexes`, `--dry-run`, `--yes`. Bidirectional: `clear cache` also works.

## Usage

To use a command blank:

1. Open the blank file from the `.claude/commands/` directory
2. Copy the blank content into your Claude Code conversation
3. Use the command syntax specified in the blank

## Git Hooks (lefthook)

This project uses [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) for graduated local checks. Install with `make hooks`.

| Hook         | What Runs                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre-commit` | `go vet` + `gofmt` check (staged `.go` files only) |
| `commit-msg` | conform (conventional commits)                     |
| `pre-push`   | `golangci-lint` + `go build` + `go test -race`     |

## Project Setup

This project uses Ailloy's compiler pipeline to provide structured AI workflows for:
- GitHub issue management
- Pull request workflows
- Development task automation
