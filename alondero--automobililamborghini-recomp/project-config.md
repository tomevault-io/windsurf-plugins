Native PC port of the N64 game via *static recompilation* (N64Recomp → C, run on `ultramodern`+`librecomp`, rendered with RT64).
Same approach as [Snowboard Kids 2 Recompiled](https://github.com/cdlewis/snowboardkids2-recomp), [Smash Bros Recompiled](https://github.com/zestydevy/smash64r), [Bomberman 64 Recompiled](https://github.com/RevoSucks/BM64Recomp). 

## Mental model

- **Name-routed static recompilation.** N64Recomp translates ROM functions to C by *name*.
  `ultramodern`+`librecomp` provide the libultra/OS layer — there is NO hand-rolled HLE and
  NO CP0/IRQ kernel emulation to maintain. RT64 is the renderer (F3DEX v1 ucode).
- **`force_stub.txt`** lists functions deliberately left as empty stubs (not yet needed or
  routed natively). The porting loop is: run → it crashes on a CP0/MMIO instruction inside
  some primitive → hand that primitive to the native runtime (or un-stub the real function).
- **`RecompiledFuncs/` and `src/aspMain.cpp` are ROM-derived and git-ignored** — regenerated
  by step 3 of BUILDING.md. Never commit them.
- Boots through attract/title/menu to the demo race. Input, audio, rendering wired through RT64.

## Non-negotiable engineering principles

- **Source is ground truth; session notes are corruptible history.** Before reasoning about
  any function, read its actual body. "Per earlier findings" is a signal to re-read source.
- **Recompilation, not game design — NEVER invent mechanics.** No invented timeouts, counter
  seeds, transition values, or idle durations. If behaviour is missing, translate what the ROM
  actually does; read the disassembly first. A hand-rolled shortcut is *scaffolding*: name it
  as such in the comment, pair it with a tracker entry, and remove it when the real code lands.
- **Measure before architecture.** measurement → data → decode → fix. Run the cheap diagnostic
  first; don't stack implementation options without a falsification gate between them.
- **Verify empirically, not by name.** Whether a function is called / emits DL / owns a role —
  prove it with a breakpoint, watchpoint, or grep for the actual primitive constants.
- **Ship code, not notes.** A session whose only output is a note/plan is a failure mode — the
  next session distrusts unverified notes and re-derives them. Land the smallest real increment.
  Never hand the next session an "exact first move"; if you know what to do, do it now.

## Debugging

- **ares is reference.** Invoke the **`ares-debugger` skill** for any live-ROM
  work (read/write RDRAM, "who writes X" watchpoints, per-frame VI/DL capture). An empty
  `mcp__ares__*` response is NOT a blocker — it means use the skill that launches ares. VI base
  = `0xA4400010`; ares RDRAM is big-endian. To check port-vs-ROM data, capture an ares dump this
  way and diff it against a port dump.
- **Live-debug the port** with native gdb on the built binary (`build/lamborghini_modern`).
  Count breakpoint hits with `ignore N <big>` + `info breakpoints`, NOT printf-in-commands
  (silently undercounts in the multithreaded build).
- **Success metric = port-vs-ares convergence**, not screenshot diffs and not byte-identicality
  between builds. Replacing a stub with real translated behaviour moves the port toward ares —
  that divergence is *progress*.

## Toolchain gotchas

- **MinGW `bin` must be on PATH** or `gcc.exe` silently exits 1 (can't find its own DLLs).
- A `cc` shim may sit ahead of gcc in PATH on this box — pin `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER`/`CXX_COMPILER`
  explicitly when configuring, or `project()` fails with "C compiler is broken".
- If a rebuild links stale recompiled code, delete stale archives under `build/` named
  `libRecompiledFuncs.a`.
- **EOL trap:** `scripts/gen_syms_toml.py` has *mixed* line endings at HEAD and
  `assets/ui/lambo.rcss` is LF-only — whole-file rewrites that normalise EOLs produce
  thousands of diff-noise lines. Edit in place; never round-trip these files through a
  text-mode script that rewrites every line.

## Game facts (verify from source / live-ares before building on them)

- **State machine 0→8:** attract → title → menu → demo race.
- **Audio:** voice alloc/steal search is `func_80080040`; the SDL sink needs a *persistent*
  SDL_AudioStream (stateless per-buffer resampling garbles); guest-word PCM needs a pair-swap
  un-swizzle; `get_frames_remaining` must report AI-rate (22050) frames, not device-rate (48000),
  or music plays ~2.2× slow. State 6 = music; state 8 = quiet music + SFX.
- **Input map:** A = confirm, B = cancel; menu input buffer `D_8011C640` (mind byte order).
- **View-cone cull is FOV-coupled:** the scene builder (func_8000A6C0) ANDs both segment
  cull paths with an authored forward-cone cosine double `0.886` at 0x8008D8C0/C8 — the
  only readers. It was authored for the N64 frustum, so any FOV change must rewrite it
  per frame or geometry pops in at the screen edges regardless of draw distance
  (`lambo_view_cone_cos` + the world-draw hook; docs/no_lod_audit.md §11).
- **Pedals:** throttle = s16 at vehicle+0xAA (±10/update toward a per-channel limit); brake demand
  = float at vehicle+0xA0 (+1/update to 16 while B held, snapped to 0 on release), consumed by
