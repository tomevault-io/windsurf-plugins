# Architecture and Features

## Core Features

This application is a Gitea Assistant that provides AI-driven code review capabilities for Gitea repositories. Key features include:

- AI code review for Pull Requests
- AI code review for successful commit statuses
- Integration with OpenAI API for code analysis
- Both summary and line-level code comments
- Secure webhook validation
- PR notification system via Feishu

## Architecture

The application follows a clean, layered architecture:

1. **Controller Layer** ([src/controllers/review.ts](mdc:src/controllers/review.ts))
   - Handles webhook requests from Gitea
   - Processes different event types (PR events, status events)
   - Manages PR notification triggers

2. **Service Layer**
   - [src/services/gitea.ts](mdc:src/services/gitea.ts): Interacts with Gitea API
   - [src/services/ai-review.ts](mdc:src/services/ai-review.ts): Manages AI code review logic
   - [src/services/feishu.ts](mdc:src/services/feishu.ts): Handles Feishu notifications
     - PR creation notifications
     - Reviewer assignment notifications
     - Error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Configuration Layer** ([src/config/index.ts](mdc:src/config/index.ts))
   - Centralizes application configuration from environment variables
   - Manages Feishu webhook configurations

4. **LLM Gateway** ([src/llm/](mdc:src/llm))
   - Multi-provider LLM abstraction layer
   - Provider adapters for OpenAI Compatible, OpenAI Responses API, Anthropic, Google Gemini
   - Role-based model routing (legacy, planner, specialist, judge, embedding)

5. **Database Layer** ([src/db/](mdc:src/db))
   - SQLite-based LLM provider and role configuration
   - API key encryption with AES-256-GCM

4. **Utilities**
   - [src/utils/logger.ts](mdc:src/utils/logger.ts): Custom logging utilities

## Webhook Flow

1. Gitea sends webhook events to `/webhook/gitea`
2. Signature verification ensures request authenticity
3. Events are processed based on their type:
   - Pull Request events:
     - Trigger code review on the PR
     - Send notifications to reviewers (if applicable)
   - Status events trigger code review on successful commits

## Notification Flow

1. **PR Creation Flow**
   - PR webhook event received
   - Event validated and processed
   - If reviewers are assigned:
     - Feishu notification prepared with PR details
     - Notification sent to all assigned reviewers

2. **Reviewer Assignment Flow**
   - PR review_requested event received
   - New reviewer information extracted
   - Feishu notification sent to newly assigned reviewer
   - Notification includes PR title and direct link

3. **Error Handling**
   - Failed notifications are logged but don't block the review process
   - Automatic retry mechanism for failed notifications
   - Errors are captured and logged for monitoring
