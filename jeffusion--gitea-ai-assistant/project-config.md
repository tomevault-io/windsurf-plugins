# AI Code Review System

## Overview

The AI Code Review system is the core feature of this application. It automatically analyzes code changes in Pull Requests and commits, providing insightful feedback using pluggable LLM providers via the LLM Gateway.

## Key Components

- **Review Controller**: [src/controllers/review.ts](mdc:src/controllers/review.ts)
  - Handles webhook events from Gitea
  - Routes events to appropriate handlers

- **AI Review Service**: [src/services/ai-review.ts](mdc:src/services/ai-review.ts)
  - Contains the core logic for AI-powered code review
  - Generates both summary comments and line-level feedback
  - Customizable prompts for different review contexts

- **Gitea Service**: [src/services/gitea.ts](mdc:src/services/gitea.ts)
  - Fetches code diffs and file contents from Gitea API
  - Posts review comments back to Gitea

## Review Workflow

1. **Trigger**:
   - Pull Request created/updated or
   - Commit status changes to "success"

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - Fetch diff content from Gitea
   - Process and analyze changes
   - Generate AI prompts with context

3. **AI Review**:
   - Route request through LLM Gateway to configured provider
   - Generate summary feedback
   - Generate line-level comments

4. **Feedback Delivery**:
   - Post summary comment to PR or commit
   - Add line comments to specific code sections
   - Apply formatting for better readability

## Customization

The system supports customizable prompts through environment variables:
- `CUSTOM_SUMMARY_PROMPT`: For overall review summaries
- `CUSTOM_LINE_COMMENT_PROMPT`: For line-specific comments

Default prompts are designed to focus on bugs and serious issues rather than style or minor concerns.
