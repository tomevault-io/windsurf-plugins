# Copilot / AI assistant instructions — NFM-World

Keep guidance short and actionable. Reference files and patterns below when making changes.

- **Big picture:** The playable app lives in `nfm-world/` (`NFMWorld.csproj`) and depends on many sibling projects (notably `NFMWorld.Library`, `FNA`, `NvgSharp`, `MonoGame.ImGuiNet`). Treat `nfm-world` as the app entry; engine/framework code is in `FNA/` and rendering/GUI glue under `NvgSharp/`, `FontStashSharp/`, and `MonoGame.ImGuiNet/`.

- **Build / run:** Use the .NET SDK (this repo targets `net10.0`). Typical commands:
  - Build entire workspace: `dotnet build nfm-world.sln -c Debug`
  - Build single project: `dotnet build nfm-world/NFMWorld.csproj`
  - Run: `dotnet run --project nfm-world/NFMWorld.csproj`
  - Run tests: `dotnet test --no-build` from solution root or test project folder.

- **Publish / native files:** `NFMWorld.csproj` contains platform-specific copy targets that move native libs from `nfm-world/skiadriver/` into the output folder. Do not remove or duplicate these targets; update them only when adding new native artifacts.

- **Shaders & tools:** Shaders in `data/shaders/*.fx` are compiled to `.fxb` via `fxc.exe` during build (`BuildShaders` target). On non-Windows builds the project expects `wine` + a Windows DirectX SDK `fxc.exe` (winetricks `dxsdk_jun2010`) or a `tools/fxc.exe` helper. If altering shader handling, preserve the MSBuild targets in `nfm-world/NFMWorld.csproj` that produce and include `.fxb` files.

- **Platform nuances:**
  - Native libraries (.dll/.so/.dylib) are copied by MSBuild targets: see `CopyCustomContentWindows`, `CopyCustomContentLinux`, and OS conditions inside `nfm-world/NFMWorld.csproj`.
  - The project sets `AllowUnsafeBlocks` and several compile symbols (e.g. `USE_BAS`). Keep those when editing compilation logic.

- **Project patterns / conventions:**
  - Most subprojects are referenced with `ProjectReference` from `NFMWorld.csproj`; prefer keeping cross-project ref changes small and use `dotnet sln` only when adding/removing whole projects.
  - Game logic vs UI: `NFMWorld.Library` contains backend/game systems; UI, rendering and native interops live in `nfm-world/`, `NvgSharp/`, and `FNA/`.
  - Data and assets: many projects include `None Include="data\**\*" CopyToOutputDirectory=...` — follow existing CopyToOutputDirectory semantics rather than inventing new asset pipelines.

- **Dependencies & runtime notes:**
  - NuGet packages used by the app include `ImGui.NET`, `ManagedBass` (and related), `Silk.NET.OpenGL`. When adding packages, prefer matching versions already in the csproj.
  - For local developer builds on Linux/macOS, ensure native dependencies (OpenGL drivers, libSDL, wine for shader compilation) are present.

- **Tests and CI hints:**
  - Run `dotnet test` at repo root; test projects are co-located with their libraries (e.g. `HoleyDiver.UnitTest`).
  - CI should `dotnet restore` then `dotnet build` then `dotnet test`. If CI runs on Linux/macOS, ensure native copy targets won't fail due to missing platform files — add conditional guards or include stub files as needed.

- **When editing MSBuild targets:** Inspect `nfm-world/NFMWorld.csproj` for patterns: shader compilation targets, copy-to-output items, and platform-specific Publish hooks. Changes here affect runtime asset layout; run a local `dotnet publish` to validate.

- **Where to look for behavior:**
  - Initialization / main loop: `nfm-world/NFMWorld.csproj` → `NFMWWindow.cs`, `NFMWorld.csproj` references `NFMWorld.cs` and `NFMWWindow.cs` as logical entry points.
  - Game backend: [NFMWorld.Library](NFMWorld.Library/NFMWorld.Library.csproj)
  - Rendering and fonts: `NvgSharp/`, `FontStashSharp/` and `FNA/`.

- **Examples to follow:**
  - Adding native files: mirror the `skiadriver` copy targets in `nfm-world/NFMWorld.csproj` rather than ad-hoc scripts.
  - Adding compiled assets (shaders): add `.fx` to `CompileShader` ItemGroup so builders include shader compilation automatically.

- **Do NOT:**
  - Remove or flatten the MSBuild platform conditionals without testing on all OSes.
  - Change shader/tool expectations without keeping a non-Windows fallback path (`tools/fxc.exe` or documented wine steps).

If anything above is unclear or you want examples inserted for a specific task (adding a native plugin, publishing for Linux, or modifying shader flow), tell me which area to expand and I will update this file.

## XAML UI System (Yoga Flexbox)

The project uses a custom XAML runtime built on XamlX (IL weaving) with Avalonia-compatible tooling. Use XAML to define UI hierarchies instead of inline C# node construction.

### Creating a new XAML View

1. **Create the XAML file** (e.g., `nfm-world/mad/ui/hud/MyView.xaml`):
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <Node xmlns="clr-namespace:nfm_world.ui.yoga"
         xmlns:elements="clr-namespace:nfm_world.ui.elements"
         xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
         x:Class="nfm_world.ui.hud.MyView"
         FlexDirection="Column"
         AlignItems="FlexStart"
         Gap="10"
         Padding="10">
