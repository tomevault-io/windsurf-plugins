# Repository write scope

Write access is restricted to these repositories:

- `aimalygin/xray-rust` (`/Users/antonmalygin/xray-rust` and its worktrees).
- `aimalygin/xray-rust-mobile` (`/Users/antonmalygin/xray-rust-mobile` and its worktrees).

Reading other repositories is allowed when relevant to the task, including
inspecting code, searching, comparing implementations, and fetching reference
material.

Keep repository modifications and GitHub write operations within the two
repositories above. This includes source edits, commits, pushes, branch/tag
changes, pull-request or issue changes, workflow dispatches, and releases.
Writing to another repository requires a new explicit instruction from the user.

Before a write operation, verify the target repository. Use an explicit
repository path or `--repo` argument where available; broader account access
does not authorize writes to other repositories.
