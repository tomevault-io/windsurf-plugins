# Commits

Follow the Commits section of AGENTS.md. Do not wait for a reminder.

- Format: `type(scope): subject`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`
- Scope is the directory touched (`jev`, `router`, `ui`, `scripts`, and so on)
- Subject line only. No body. No bullet list.
- One commit per directory when a change spans several.
- Do not push unless asked.
- Do not commit secrets, `data/catalog.sqlite`, or generated dumps.
