# Elysia Backend Guidelines

## Feature Organization

- Organize code by feature modules with clear boundaries
- Each feature contains: routes, service, domain models, and repository implementation
- Use underscore prefix for all feature-specific internal directories

## Controller Pattern (Elysia)

- Use Elysia instances as controllers with method chaining
- Group related routes using prefixes
- Include Swagger documentation with the `detail` property

## Service Pattern

- Use class-based services with arrow function methods
- Keep business logic in services, separate from controllers
- All service methods MUST accept object parameters and return objects

## Model Definition

- Use Elysia's validation system (`t.Object()`) for models/DTOs
- Group related models together in `_domain` directory

## Security

- Validate all inputs using Elysia's built-in validation
- Implement proper authentication with better-auth
- Use secure headers and proper CORS configuration
