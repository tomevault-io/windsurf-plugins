# Coding Standards

## Core Principles

- Write clean, readable code with feature-based organization
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines)
- Use clear, consistent naming and prioritize modularity
- Always use object as function parameter
- Always use arrow functions for class methods
- Always return objects from hooks and async functions

## Code Style

### File Naming & Structure

- Use kebab-case for all file and directory names
- Organize directories by feature with underscore prefix for feature-specific folders:
  - `features/feature/_components/`, `features/feature/_controllers/`, etc.
- Shared components should NOT use underscore prefix:
  - `components/ui/`, `components/layout/`, `components/shared/`

### Imports & Paths

- Use absolute imports with the `~` prefix for all project files
- Import UI components from `~/components/ui/*` NOT from `~/ui/*`
- Always use direct imports instead of barrel (index) files for better tree-shaking
- Prefer consistent import ordering: React/external libraries first, followed by absolute imports

### TypeScript & React

- Use TypeScript with proper types; prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Implement functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns

## Hook Design

- Create single-responsibility hooks that return one state or action
- All hooks MUST return objects even when returning a single value (e.g., `return { isPending }` not `return isPending`)
- Avoid hooks that return multiple states or actions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use composition to combine smaller hooks where needed

## Component Design

- Use compound component design pattern for complex components
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for component composition
- Create small, reusable components that can be composed together
- Isolate re-renders to the smallest possible component
- All component event handlers should use object parameters (e.g., `onClick={({ id }) => handleClick({ id })}`)

## Component Performance

- Create smaller components that consume only the specific hooks they need
- Break UI into logical, focused components to isolate re-renders

## Function Returns

- All functions MUST return objects if needed, even for single values (e.g., `return { result }` not `return result`)
- All hooks MUST return objects, even for single values (e.g., `return { isPending }` not `return isPending`)
- All controller methods that return data should return objects for destructuring
