## Skill Conventions

- `SKILL.md` must have YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`.
- `description` is a routing instruction for the model, not a human summary. Include trigger phrases.
- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move details to `references/`.
- No README.md, CHANGELOG.md, or human-facing docs inside skill directories.

## Rules

1. **No hardcoded credentials.** Use `$ENV_VAR_NAME` for tokens, API keys, auth strings, product IDs. This repo is public.
2. **No personal data.** No emails, phone numbers, account balances, or internal URLs.
3. **Update README.md** when adding, removing, or renaming skills. Every skill directory must appear in the README under the correct category.
4. **Use `openclaw` naming** (not `clawdbot`). Config path: `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. Metadata key: `openclaw`.
5. **Paths use `~/clawd/skills/`** for workspace references (not `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/`).

## PR Guidelines

- One logical change per PR. Don't stack unrelated changes.
- Branch from `main`. Don't stack branches on other feature branches. Use git worktrees for feature work, placed in `~/.hermes/.worktrees/skills/` (outside the repo to avoid duplicating repo content).
- If CI (claude-review) flags issues, fix them before requesting merge.
- Check all three comment sources for review feedback: inline comments, issue comments, and review verdicts.

## CI

- `claude-code-review.yml` runs on every PR. It checks frontmatter, hardcoded secrets, broken references, and accuracy.
- CI failures from bad credentials (401) are infra issues. Retry the run.
