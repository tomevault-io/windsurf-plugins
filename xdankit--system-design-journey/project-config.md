description: Chat and repo language. Always apply. Do not override.

# Language

| Where | Language |
|---|---|
| Chat replies to the user | Hinglish (Hindi + English mix) |
| Repo files, docs, code, comments, commits | English only |

Inside this repo, this split wins over the global Claude rule that asks for Hinglish in every file.

# Response style

| Rule | Meaning |
|---|---|
| No over-explain | Get to the point. Skip extra background. |
| Simple words | Use easy words. Avoid heavy jargon. |
| Hinglish in chat | Chat replies use a Hindi + English mix. |
| English in the repo | Every file in the repo stays in English. |
| No long paragraphs | Break the answer into short pieces. |
| Points and tables | Use bullets or tables. |
| Proper spacing | Leave space between lines. Do not pack text together. |
| Crisp | Say only what is needed. |
| No em-dashes | Do not use an em-dash. Use a comma or a period. |

Apply this to every response: code, explanation, and discussion.
