# Frontend E2E (Playwright)

Browser-level tests against the real Angular app, in
`web/app/e2e`. Full detail lives in
`web/app/e2e/README.md` — this rule is a summary, not a
duplicate. All commands run via the repo's `@playwright/test` devDependency
(`npx playwright` / the npm scripts) — never a separately pinned or global
Playwright install.

## Layout

```
e2e/
  poms/       # Page Object Models — locators + interactions only, no assertions, no env awareness
  fixtures/   # test.extend fixtures (testUser, userWithPersonality, seed, apiClient); api.ts holds raw HTTP calls
  sdk/        # openapi-typescript-generated client (npm run sdk:generate)
  tests/
    functional/   # per-feature specs: auth/, personality/, profile/
    journeys/     # cross-cutting flows
    visual/       # toHaveScreenshot specs + committed __screenshots__ baselines
    a11y/         # axe-core scans
  scripts/
    visual-docker.sh   # runs tests/visual inside the Playwright Docker image
  playwright.config.base.ts   # shared settings + the three browser projects
  playwright.config.{mock-llm,local-llm}.ts
```

## Which config

**The config/backend/tag matrix lives in one place:
`web/app/e2e/README.md` ("Configs"), with the reasoning in
`e2e/docs/what-runs-where.md`. Read it there — do not restate it here.**

This section used to carry its own copy of that table and it drifted, which is
the argument for the rule: it listed a retired `@no-prod` tag no config
honours, omitted tags configs actually exclude, and gave wrong guidance on
`E2E_BASE_URL` / `E2E_API_BASE_URL`. Anyone following it would have set
variables that override the correct values.

The one thing worth stating here because it is not in the table: there is no
root `playwright.config.ts` — always pass `--config` (the npm scripts do).

## Backend prerequisites

Local configs only start the Angular dev server, not the backend:

```bash
make db-up
make dev-up   # or: make run-mock / make run-local
```

## Writing tests

- POMs (`e2e/poms/`): locators + interactions only, **no assertions, no env
  awareness**. Grow an existing POM rather than putting a raw locator in a
  spec.
- Locate by `aria-label`, role, or placeholder — the app has no
  `data-testid` attributes.
- Use the shared fixtures from `e2e/fixtures/index.ts` (`testUser`,
  `userWithPersonality`, `seed`, `apiClient`) instead of bare
  `@playwright/test`.
- `e2e/fixtures/api.ts` is the only file allowed to hand-roll HTTP; new
  endpoint calls should go through `e2e/sdk/` (regenerate with
  `npm run sdk:generate` after an `openapi.yaml` change).
- Run `npm run lint:e2e` before considering e2e work done.

### POM, fixture and naming conventions

**These live in one place: `web/app/e2e/README.md`, section
"POM and fixture conventions". Read it before adding or changing a POM,
fixture or spec — do not restate the rules here.**

It covers: never naming a POM member after a Playwright API member; URL
navigation as the default (`navigateTo()`) with `AppShell.clickThroughTo()`
as the click-path alternative; POMs coming from fixtures rather than `new`;
fixtures naming the identity they hand back; locators as constructor-assigned
`readonly` fields; constructors that do nothing but assign; and — the one
that bites hardest on deployed runs — **asserting only about entities your
own test created, never about the account's list as a whole**.

Three of those are enforced rather than trusted, all in `eslint.config.mjs`:
a bare call statement in a POM constructor is an error, a `test.fixme` whose
reason string cites no filed GitHub issue (`#nnn`) is an error, and
`userWithPersonality` / `authenticatedPage` are exempt from `no-unused-vars`
because naming a fixture is what runs it.

### A test that fails because the product is broken

File the bug first, then park the test on it with
`test.fixme(true, '… — see #nnn')` — never delete the test, weaken the
assertion to match the broken behaviour, or leave it failing. The full
procedure, including why it is `fixme` and not `skip`, is in the README
section "Parking a test on a filed bug".

## Visual regression

`tests/visual/` (tagged `@visual @mock-only`, Chromium-only) covers a
handful of deterministic screens. **Baselines are only generated/updated
inside the Playwright Docker container** — never via `--update-snapshots`
on a host machine, since macOS/Linux font rasterization differs from CI:

```bash
npm run e2e:mock-llm:visual:docker         # check mode — what CI effectively runs
npm run e2e:mock-llm:visual:docker:update  # regenerate baselines — commit these
```

`npm run e2e:mock-llm:visual` / `e2e:mock-llm:visual:update` are host-only diagnostic runs;
never commit their output.
