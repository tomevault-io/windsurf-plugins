# Agent Instructions

This file tells AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude, Codex, Copilot, etc.) how to work in this codebase. Read it before making changes.

## Runtime

- **Bun** is the only supported runtime. Do not use Node.js APIs that Bun does not support.
- TypeScript everywhere. No plain `.js` files in `packages/`.
- `bun:sqlite` for all SQLite access. Do not use `better-sqlite3` or `node:sqlite`.

## Essential commands

```bash
bun install                    # install all workspace deps
bun run dev                    # start gateway with hot reload
bun run build                  # production build → dist/index.js
bun run typecheck              # tsc --noEmit (must be clean)
bun test --recursive           # all tests
bun test packages/core/        # unit tests only
bun test packages/memory/      # memory + vector tests
bun test packages/scheduler/   # scheduler + budget tests
bun test packages/tools/       # tool tests
```

Always run `bun run typecheck` and `bun test --recursive` after making changes. Both must pass before committing.

```

## Core contracts (do not break without a major version bump)

These interfaces are the public API. Implementations plug in via the gateway:

- `Provider` — chat streaming (`packages/core/src/types/provider.ts`)
- `EmbeddingProvider` — vector embeddings (`packages/core/src/types/provider.ts`)
- `Channel` — message in/out (`packages/core/src/types/channel.ts`)
- `ConversationStore` — message history (`packages/core/src/types/memory.ts`)
- `LongTermMemory` — fact storage + recall (`packages/core/src/types/memory.ts`)
- `Result<T, E>` — error monad, used everywhere library code can fail (`packages/core/src/types/errors.ts`)

## Coding conventions

- **No `any` unless unavoidable.** When a third-party type is incomplete, use a narrowly-scoped cast, not a blanket `any`.
- **No `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-nocheck`.** Fix the underlying type issue.
- **Result monad for fallible operations.** Return `Result<T, E>` from library functions; do not throw from library code.
- **No framework magic at the core.** `packages/core` has zero runtime dependencies. Keep it that way.
- **File size.** Keep files under ~400 lines. If a file grows beyond that, split it.
- **Tests colocated.** Test files live next to the code they test in `src/__tests__/`.
- **Conventional commits.** All commit messages must follow `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `perf:` prefixes. This powers automated releases.

## Adding a new provider

1. Create `packages/providers/<name>/` with a `package.json` and `src/provider.ts`
2. Implement the `Provider` interface (and optionally `EmbeddingProvider`)
3. Add the package to `packages/gateway/src/gateway.ts` provider selection
4. Add config validation in `packages/core/src/config.ts` if new env vars are needed
5. See `packages/providers/gemini/` as a reference

## Adding a new channel

1. Create `packages/channels/<name>/` with a `package.json` and `src/<name>-channel.ts`
2. Implement the `Channel` interface from `@spaceduck/core`
3. Register it in `packages/gateway/src/gateway.ts`
4. Add any new env vars to `.env.example` and `packages/core/src/config.ts`
5. See `packages/channels/whatsapp/` as a reference

## Adding a new tool

1. Create `packages/tools/<name>/` with a `package.json` and `src/index.ts`
2. Implement the tool class (see `packages/tools/browser/` for the pattern)
3. Register it in `packages/gateway/src/tool-registrations.ts`

## sqlite-vec on macOS

On macOS, `ensureCustomSQLite()` in `packages/memory/sqlite/src/schema.ts` must be called once before any `new Database()`. This loads Homebrew's SQLite (which supports extensions) instead of Apple's system SQLite (which does not). On Linux, this is a no-op.

The function looks for `libsqlite3.dylib` at Homebrew paths (`/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlite/lib/` for Apple Silicon, `/usr/local/opt/sqlite3/lib/` for Intel).

## What not to touch

- `dist/` — generated by `bun run build`, never edit
- `node_modules/` — managed by Bun
- `data/whatsapp-auth/` — WhatsApp session credentials, gitignored
- `spaceduck.db` — local database, gitignored
- Migration files in `packages/memory/sqlite/src/migrations/` — only add new numbered migrations, never edit existing ones
