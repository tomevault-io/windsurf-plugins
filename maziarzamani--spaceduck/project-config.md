# Git Conventions

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commits. Format: `type(scope): description`

Types:
- `feat` — new feature or capability
- `fix` — bug fix
- `refactor` — code restructuring without behavior change
- `test` — adding or updating tests
- `docs` — documentation only
- `chore` — tooling, deps, CI, config changes
- `perf` — performance improvement

Scope is the package name without `@spaceduck/` prefix: `core`, `gateway`, `memory-sqlite`, `provider-gemini`, `channel-web`.

Examples:
- `feat(gateway): add WebSocket support with WsEnvelope protocol`
- `fix(memory-sqlite): handle foreign key constraint on facts table`
- `test(core): boost coverage for fact-extractor and error classes`
- `chore: rename project from moonbot to spaceduck`

## Author

Commits in this repo use `hi@spaceduck.ai` as the author email (set via local git config).

## Commit Practices

- **Typecheck before committing.** Run `bunx tsc --noEmit` and fix all errors before staging.
- **Run tests before committing.** All tests must pass. Run `bun test --recursive`.
- **Small, focused commits.** Each commit should do one logical thing.
- **Never commit secrets.** The `.env` file is gitignored. Only `.env.example` is tracked.
- **Never commit binaries or build artifacts.** `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `*.db` are gitignored.
- **Don't skip hooks.** Never use `--no-verify`.

## Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing any branch or creating a PR, **always** run these in order:

1. `bunx tsc --noEmit` — must exit 0 (no type errors)
2. `bun test --recursive` — must exit 0 (all tests pass)

Do NOT push code that fails either check. Fix the issues first.

## Branch Strategy (GitHub Flow)

- `main` — stable, protected. All PRs target `main`. Never push directly.
- Feature branches: `feat/<short-description>` (e.g., `feat/web-ui`)
- Fix branches: `fix/<short-description>`
- Chore branches: `chore/<short-description>`
- Keep branches short-lived. Merge via PR.

### Starting a task

**Always create a feature branch before making changes.** When the user asks you to implement something:

1. `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. `git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>` (e.g., `feat/config-system`, `fix/memory-leak`, `chore/update-deps`)
3. Do the work, commit incrementally
4. Push and tell the user to create a PR on GitHub

Never commit directly to `main`. If you find yourself on `main`, create and switch to a branch first.

## When to Commit

Commit after completing a logical unit of work:
- A milestone (M0, M1, M2, ...) or sub-milestone
- A new feature, test suite, or bug fix
- A rename, refactor, or config change

Do NOT commit half-finished work to `main`. Use a feature branch.

## Pull Requests

- Title follows conventional commit format
- Body has a `## Summary` section with 1-3 bullet points
- Body has a `## Test plan` section
- Reference related issues if any
