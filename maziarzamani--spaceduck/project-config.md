# Package conventions

## Dependency rules (strict)

- `@spaceduck/core` has ZERO external dependencies. It defines interfaces only.
- All other packages depend on `@spaceduck/core` via `workspace:*`.
- No package may depend on another non-core package (except gateway).
- `@spaceduck/gateway` is the ONLY package that depends on implementation packages.
- Gateway is the composition root — it creates and wires all implementations.

## Package structure

Each package follows this layout:

```
packages/<category>/<name>/
  package.json
  src/
    index.ts              # barrel export — the public API
    <implementation>.ts   # one file per concern
    __tests__/            # co-located tests
      <implementation>.test.ts
    __fixtures__/         # test helpers (core only)
```

## Adding a new package

1. Create the directory under the appropriate category (`channels/`, `providers/`, `memory/`)
2. Add `package.json` with `@spaceduck/<name>`, depend on `@spaceduck/core` via `workspace:*`
3. Export the public API from `src/index.ts`
4. Wire it in `@spaceduck/gateway` via constructor injection
5. Existing workspace globs auto-discover new packages — no root config change needed

## Naming

- Package names: `@spaceduck/<name>` (lowercase, hyphenated)
- Interfaces: PascalCase (`Provider`, `ConversationStore`, `EventBus`)
- Implementations: PascalCase with prefix (`BedrockProvider`, `SqliteConversationStore`)
- Files: kebab-case (`context-builder.ts`, `long-term.ts`)
- Test files: same name with `.test.ts` suffix
