# Mintlify Technical Writing

## Writing principles

- Use second person ("you") for instructions, active voice, present tense
- Lead with the most important information; basic concepts before advanced
- Break procedures into numbered steps with prerequisites and expected outcomes
- Keep sentences concise; define jargon on first use; maintain consistent terminology
- Use parallel structure in lists and headings

## Page structure

Every `.mdx` page starts with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Clear, keyword-rich title"
description: "Concise description of page purpose and value"
---
```

Heading hierarchy starts at H2 (`##`). Use descriptive, scannable headings.

## Component selection

| Need | Component |
|------|-----------|
| Sequential instructions | `<Steps>` with `<Step title="...">` |
| Platform-specific alternatives | `<Tabs>` with `<Tab title="...">` |
| Same concept in multiple languages | `<CodeGroup>` |
| Progressive disclosure / FAQ | `<AccordionGroup>` + `<Accordion>` |
| API endpoint request/response | `<RequestExample>` / `<ResponseExample>` |
| API parameters | `<ParamField path\|body\|query\|header>` |
| API response shape | `<ResponseField>` with `<Expandable>` for nesting |
| Supplementary info | `<Note>`, `<Tip>`, `<Warning>`, `<Info>`, `<Check>` |
| Navigation cards | `<Card>` / `<CardGroup cols={2}>` |
| Images | Always wrap in `<Frame>` (optional `caption`) |
| Inline definitions | `<Tooltip tip="...">` |

## Callout usage

- `<Note>` — helpful context that supports the main content
- `<Tip>` — best practices, shortcuts, pro tips
- `<Warning>` — potential issues, breaking changes, destructive actions
- `<Info>` — neutral background or announcements
- `<Check>` — success confirmations

## Code examples

- Always complete and runnable; use realistic data, never real secrets
- Specify language and filename: `` ```javascript config.js ``
- Add comments only for non-obvious logic
- Show error handling and expected output
- Use `<CodeGroup>` for multi-language variants

## API documentation

- Document all parameters (required and optional) with `<ParamField>`
- Show success and error responses with `<ResponseExample>`
- Include auth examples, rate limits, and all HTTP status codes
- Use `<Expandable>` for nested object properties

## Navigation config

Refer to [docs.json schema](https://mintlify.com/docs.json) when building `docs.json` and site navigation.

## Accessibility

- Descriptive alt text on all images
- Specific link text (never "click here")
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Sufficient color contrast in examples
