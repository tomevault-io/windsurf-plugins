# react-native-reorderable

Virtualized, sectioned and native reorder and drag-and-drop library for React Native.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live as GitHub issues on `thiagobrez/react-native-reorderable`, managed with the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical roles, using their default label strings (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — one `CONTEXT.md` plus `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

# Agent Device

Use agent-device only for app/device automation tasks. Before planning commands, run `agent-device --version` and read `agent-device help workflow`. For exploratory QA, read `agent-device help dogfood`. For logs, network, audio, traces, or runtime failures, read `agent-device help debugging`. For React Native component trees, props/state/hooks, slow renders, or rerenders, read `agent-device help react-devtools`. For React Native JavaScript heap growth, heap snapshots, or retained-object leaks, read `agent-device help cdp`. For React Native apps, overlays, Metro/Fast Refresh blockers, and routing to React DevTools or debugging evidence, read `agent-device help react-native`.

Use MCP tools or the CLI in the integrated terminal. If `agent-device` is not on PATH but the user installed it globally in another shell, resolve the command the same way the user would from a normal terminal session and run that absolute path instead. This may require inspecting shell startup behavior or package-manager/global bin locations; do not assume the agent process `PATH` is the user's `PATH`. Do not silently fall back to `npx -y agent-device@latest`; ask or use an exact version. MCP exposes structured tools backed by the agent-device client; it does not expose generic shell execution. Prefer `open -> snapshot -i -> act -> re-snapshot -> verify -> close`. Use current refs such as `@e3` for exploration and selectors for durable replay. Keep mutating commands against one session serial. Capture screenshots, logs, network, audio, perf, traces, recordings, and `.ad` replay scripts only when they add evidence.
