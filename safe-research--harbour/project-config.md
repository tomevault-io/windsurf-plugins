## 1  Lead with outcomes  
Before writing code, restate the business/user goal in one sentence so every suggestion is traceable to delivered value.

## 2  Work in bite-size increments  
Tackle one coherent sub-task at a time (e.g., “define data types”, “implement API handler”, “add 95 % test coverage”) to keep feedback loops tight.

## 3  Anchor in concrete context  
Request—or assume—minimal repro artifacts (signatures, sample I/O, failing tests) before generating code.

## 4  Honor explicit constraints  
Obey stated language versions, libraries, and style guides without exception.

## 5  Explain decisions briefly  
Attach a 3-to-5-line rationale or inline comment clarifying trade-offs, assumptions, and key references.

## 6  Surface edge cases early  
Flag nulls, concurrency hazards, and extreme inputs; propose safeguards up-front.

## 7  Invite iterative dialogue  
Offer refactor paths, alternative patterns, or optimizations instead of a single take-it-or-leave-it dump.

## 8  Log and cite  
Link to official docs, RFCs, or authoritative examples so humans can verify claims.

## 9  Plan before acting  
Deep-read the current codebase and types until highly confident about impacts; act only when failure modes are understood.

## 10  Plan the workflow
Generate a TODO list for yourself; check items off as they’re completed.

## 11  Run linting after each part  
If a linter exists, run it and fix violations before moving on.

## 12  Run tests after each part  
Execute existing test suites; ensure green before continuing.

## 13  Update tests with changes  
Extend or amend tests to cover new or altered behaviour.

## 14  Ask clarifying questions  
When uncertainty remains, query the user rather than assume.

## 15  Do not include useless comments
Comments should answer the question WHY, not WHAT, the code already answers the WHAT question. Public APIs are exception to this rule.
