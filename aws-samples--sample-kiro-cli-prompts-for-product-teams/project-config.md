# Product Team's Tool Chest

This project transforms Claude into a product development partner, guiding you from idea to interactive prototype.

## Automatic Workflow

When the user describes a product idea or asks to start product development, follow the workflow in `prompts/Claude_Code_Workflow.md`.

**Workflow phases (user-facing):**
1. **Deep Market Research** - 6 parallel research dimensions with 120+ sources and quality gates
2. **AI Framing** (optional) - For AI/ML products only
3. **PRFAQ** - Amazon-style Working Backwards documentation
4. **PRD** - Detailed requirements with EARS syntax
5. **Prototype** - Interactive HTML with modular screens

**Internal sub-steps (agent executes, not presented to user as separate phases):**
- Technology Research runs inside PRD (validates current-year tech availability)
- Prototype Spec runs at the start of Prototype (defines interactions before screen building)

**Project Dashboard — update after EVERY phase (MANDATORY, do not skip):**
Create `documents/ProjectDashboard_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html` at the START (all phases "pending"), then after each phase completes:
1. Save the phase document
2. **Regenerate the dashboard wholesale** from its `CONFIG` object — set that phase's card `status` to "completed" and fill its action `href`(s); re-emit the whole file (progress %, timestamp, links all derive from `CONFIG`). Never str-replace its structural HTML.
3. `open ./documents/ProjectDashboard_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html`
4. Tell the user: "Dashboard updated — [Phase] complete."

This keeps the dashboard live as you go. Full protocol + template: `prompts/Claude_Code_Workflow.md` and `prompts/ProjectDashboard_Template.html`.

**Key rules:**
- All outputs are **HTML files** saved to `./documents/`
- Use file naming: `[Type]_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html`
- Follow design standards in `prompts/Claude_Code_Workflow.md` (avoid AI slop)
- Tech stack: AWS-native (Amazon Bedrock for generative AI, AWS services for infrastructure)
- **Prototype screens must link together** - every button/link navigates to the correct screen
- **For known companies:** Fetch and use their actual logo, brand colors, and typography

**Brand assets (REQUIRED for known companies):**
When building for a recognizable company (Discovery Education, Amazon, Google, etc.):

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: The logo must be for the CUSTOMER company — the company this product is being built FOR. The market research phase contains competitor logos and branding. Do NOT use a competitor's logo. If uncertain which company is the customer, check `customer_company` in the handoff payload or ask the user.**

1. **FIND the CUSTOMER's logo** (see full protocol in `Prototype_Creation_Guide.md` Step 1.1):
   - **Web image search first:** `"[Customer Name]" logo` — most reliable
   - **Schema.org / Clearbit / Wikipedia** — check before scraping
   - **HTML scrape last:** prioritize alt text containing customer name, NOT filenames containing "logo"
   - **Do NOT trust filenames** — `partner-logo.png` in a carousel is not the site logo

2. **PASS THE LOGO GATE (mandatory — all 5 checks):**
   - [ ] HTTP 200 (`curl -sI "[URL]" | head -5`)
   - [ ] File size 2KB–50KB (`curl -sI "[URL]" | grep -i content-length`)
   - [ ] **Downloaded and LOOKED AT the image** (`curl -sL -o /tmp/logo_check.png "[URL]"` then read it)
   - [ ] **The image shows the CUSTOMER's brand** (not a partner, sponsor, or different company)
   - [ ] **Stated out loud:** "This logo belongs to [Customer] because [reason]"
   
   **HTTP 200 alone is NOT verification.** You MUST download and visually confirm the image.
   **If you can't confidently say it's the customer's logo → ask the user.** A text placeholder is always better than the wrong company's logo.

3. **Extract brand colors** - visit their website, use dev tools to get exact hex values

4. **Identify typography** - their fonts or closest Google Fonts match

5. **Embed VERIFIED logo in outputs:**
   - Market Research: `<img src="[VERIFIED-URL]">` in "Brand Assets" section
   - Design System: Use their colors as CSS variables
   - Prototypes: Show logo in header, login screens, footer

**Logo verification loop:** Try URL → fetch fails? → try next URL → repeat until success

## Prototype Structure

**Create MODULAR files, not a single monolithic HTML.**

**Build order (STRICT — each step depends on the previous):**
1. `[product-slug].css` — Shared CSS file (create FIRST, `.css` extension required)
2. `DesignSystem_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html` — Visual reference page (BEFORE any screens)
3. Design Token Contract — extracted from CSS for subagent prompts (theme mode, color/spacing/shadow/radius/animation/z-index/breakpoint vars, class inventory)
4. Screen manifest + sidebar shell template + Content Link Map — exact filenames, full sidebar HTML (logo + nav + footer), in-content links between screens
5. `Screen_[Name]_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html` — One file per screen (links to `.css`, uses token contract)
6. `ScreenIndex_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html` — Navigation hub (LAST, use template at `prompts/ScreenIndex_Template.html`)
