# 🤖 Agent instructions

This CLI is **agent-operated**: you are the primary operator, and the CLI is your deterministic toolbelt for parsing, validating, rendering, and tracking resumes. See [ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-agent-operated-cli.md) for the design rationale.

Use this repo to help a candidate run an evidence-backed resume workflow. Assume the candidate wants the **agent-first path** unless they explicitly ask for CLI-only instructions.

## 🚀 Default workflow

1. 📦 Run `npm install` if dependencies are missing.
2. 🧪 Run `npm start` so the candidate can see the fictional sample workflow.
3. 🧭 Follow [`docs/playbooks/onboarding.md`](docs/playbooks/onboarding.md) for first-run sequencing — it checks the workspace's actual state (does it exist? has real material been dropped in? has it been ingested? has intake happened?) and greets the candidate at the right step instead of always starting from scratch.

Throughout the lifecycle, not just at first launch:

4. 🙋 Ask clarifying questions before making claims that are missing, vague, or high impact.
5. 📌 Record unanswered questions in workspace notes or `candidate/outputs/follow-up-questions.md`.
6. ✅ Run `npm run workspace:validate -- --workspace candidate` before handoff.
7. 🔒 Run `npm run check:privacy` before committing or sharing anything.

## ⚠️ Claim rules

- Do not invent experience, metrics, degrees, employers, production usage, or ownership.
- Use `profile.json` and `evidence.jsonl` as the source of truth.
- If a claim lacks evidence, ask the candidate or record a follow-up question.
- Phrase low-confidence claims cautiously and mark them for candidate review.
- Do not promote a similar role to tracked status until the candidate approves it.

## 🔒 Privacy rules

- Treat `candidate/` as private workspace data.
- Do not commit real resumes, private notes, profile files, evidence ledgers, tracked roles, or generated outputs.
- Commit reusable code, docs, templates, schemas, and fictional examples only.
- If a privacy check fails, stop and fix the staged or tracked private file before proceeding.

## 💬 Communication style

- Use plain language.
- Keep first steps short.
- Explain what command to run and what result to expect.
- Ask one focused question at a time when user input is needed.

## 📊 Status update recipe

When a candidate reports a status change ("I was denied for X", "I have an interview at Y", etc.), use the `set-status` command to record it deterministically:

```bash
npm run workspace -- set-status \
  --workspace candidate \
  --company "<Company Name>" \
  --title "<Role Title>" \
  --status <status> \
  [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
```

**Status enum:** `interested`, `applied`, `interview`, `offer`, `rejected`, `withdrawn`

If the candidate has more than one tracked role with the same company + title (e.g. a reapply after an earlier rejection), `set-status` refuses to guess and lists the ambiguous role IDs — re-run with `--id <role-id>` instead of `--company`/`--title` to disambiguate.

**Examples:**
- "I got rejected by Acme Corp for Senior Engineer":
  ```bash
  npm run workspace -- set-status --workspace candidate --company "Acme Corp" --title "Senior Engineer" --status rejected
  ```

- "I interviewed at TechCorp for the PM role yesterday":
  ```bash
  npm run workspace -- set-status --workspace candidate --company "TechCorp" --title "Product Manager" --status interview --date 2026-07-19
  ```

The command updates `roles.tracked.json` and rebuilds `outputs/tracker.md` and `outputs/tracker.html` automatically.
## 🎤 Intake interview (grill)

**When to use:** After the candidate has set up their workspace, run the grill intake interview to capture their work history, target roles, location preferences, compensation, and constraints.

**How to use:**

1. Open the grill playbook: [`docs/playbooks/grill.md`](docs/playbooks/grill.md)
2. Paste it into your terminal agent (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot CLI, etc.)
3. Follow the agent's guidance to answer questions one at a time
4. The agent writes answers to `candidate/profile.json`, `candidate/preferences.json`, and `candidate/evidence.jsonl`
5. Validate the result: `npm run workspace:validate -- --workspace candidate`

The grill playbook is the source of truth. See the `.claude/skills/grill` skill for usage details.

## 🎓 Study guide recipe

**When to use:** Before an interview for a tracked role.

1. Gather everything relevant — profile, evidence, the tailored resume config, and the job posting — into one context bundle:
   ```bash
   npm run workspace:bundle -- --workspace candidate --company "<Company Name>" --title "<Role Title>"
   ```
   This writes `outputs/study-guide-bundles/<role-id>.json`. See [`docs/workspace-schemas.md`](docs/workspace-schemas.md#study-guide-bundle-study-guide-bundle) for the exact bundle shape.
2. Read the bundle and write the actual study guide to `outputs/study-guides/<company>/study-guide.md`, following [`docs/playbooks/study-guide.md`](docs/playbooks/study-guide.md) — organized by interview stage, with every talking point tied back to an `evidence.jsonl` entry ID.
