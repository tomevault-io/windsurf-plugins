## Project Overview
The **OCS Node: SF20 Transformation Engine** is an AI-driven system designed to transform high-level user intent into high-fidelity execution artifacts. It operates using the **KickLang** protocol, a structured syntax for inter-agent communication and task processing. The core mission is defined as "Transform by two generations."

The project follows a rigorous **20-step Transformation Execution workflow** managed by a team of specialized AI personas (e.g., GPTASe, Lyra, Fizz La Metta, Codein).

## Key Components

### KickLang Protocol
All interactions and data processing MUST adhere to KickLang headers:

*   **Directives (`⫻cmd/`)**: Operational commands (e.g., `⫻cmd/exec:`, `⫻cmd/halt:`, `⫻cmd/mode:`).
*   **Payloads (`⫻data/`)**: Information containers (e.g., `⫻data/obj:` for objectives, `⫻data/tas:` for Task Agnostic Steps, `⫻data/logic:` for content).
*   **Queries (`⫻query/`)**: Requests for clarification or additional information (e.g., `⫻query/clarify:`).

### Transformation Workflow (`⫻flow:transformation/execution`)
A 20-step cycle ensuring comprehensive execution:
1. TAS Extraction -> 2. TAS Purification -> 3. Workflow Structuring -> 4. Cognitive Coordination -> 5. Knowledge Transfer -> 6. Code Context -> 7. Prompt Refinement -> 8. Protocol Establishment -> 9. System Monitoring -> 10. Ethical Compliance -> 11. Visual Assets -> 12. Operational Rules -> 13. Strategic Plans -> 14. NL Translation -> 15. Dynamic Role Adaptation -> 16. Joint Decisions -> 17. Integrity Monitoring -> 18. Tailored Plans -> 19. Holistic Task Approach -> 20. Review & Refinement.

## Directory Structure
*   `conductor/`: Contains high-level project management documents (`index.md`, `product.md`).
*   `docs/`: Detailed playbooks and protocol specifications (e.g., `playbook.kl`).

## Usage Guidelines
1.  **Strict Protocol Compliance**: Always use KickLang syntax for inputs and outputs unless otherwise specified.
2.  **Workflow Adherence**: When performing transformations, reference the 20-step workflow in `tasks/001_sf20_transformation.kl`.
3.  **Persona Context**: Be aware of the specialized agent roles (GPTASe, Lyra, etc.) when refining tasks or generating content.
4.  **Task Management**: New objectives should be recorded as `.kl` files in the `tasks/` directory.

## Key Files
*   `docs/playbook.kl`: The definitive guide for KickLang operations.

## Working Directories
*   `tasks`: Active task definitions
*   `output`: Generated artifacts
*   `src`: Implementation of the OCS Node
