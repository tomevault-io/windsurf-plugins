This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Photo Prompt - 提示词图片展示** (Photo - Prompt Image Display)

A single-file HTML website that displays text-to-image generation cards. Pure frontend implementation, no backend or build process required.

## Project Structure

- `text2img-index.html` - Single HTML file containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- `prd.md` - Product requirements document

## Architecture

The HTML file contains:

- Static card grid displaying AI-generated images
- Each card shows: generation engine, positive prompts, and LORAs used
- Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- UI style: artistic photography aesthetic, black/white/gray color scheme

## Running the Project

Open `text2img-index.html` directly in any modern web browser. No build, server, or dependencies required.

## Development Notes

- All code is self-contained in a single HTML file
- No external dependencies or CDN requirements for core functionality
- CSS handles card styling with shadows and rounded corners
- JavaScript handles any dynamic rendering of cards
