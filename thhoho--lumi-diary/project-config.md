# 🧚 Lumi Diary

**Your local-first memory guardian and cyber bestie.**

> *Lumi isn't a cold cloud drive or a mechanical habit tracker. She's a tiny spirit living on your device who speaks your squad's slang, drops memes from months ago at the perfect moment, and stitches everyone's messy moments into a stunning memory scroll.*
>
> *Lumi 不是一个冷冰冰的网盘，也不是机械的打卡助手。她是一个住在你设备里、懂你们圈子黑话、会接梗，还能把日常碎片拼成灿烂画卷的赛博精灵。*
