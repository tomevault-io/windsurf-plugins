# jarvis-llm-proxy-api

LLM proxy service with local model inference, LoRA adapter training, and queue workers.

## Running (Port 7704 API, Port 7705 Queue Worker)

**On macOS:** Run natively (required for Metal acceleration):
```bash
./run.sh                       # Starts API + queue worker natively
./run.sh --rebuild             # Rebuild venv after dependency changes
```

**On Linux:** Docker is fine:
```bash
./run.sh --docker              # Start in Docker
./run.sh --docker --rebuild    # Rebuild after dependency changes
```

**Production:**
```bash
./run-prod.sh                  # Uses prod.env, no hot reload
```

**Why native on macOS:** Uses llama-cpp-python with Metal acceleration and sets `OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES` for macOS compatibility. Docker cannot access Metal GPU.

## Two API Modes

### 1. Synchronous - OpenAI-Compatible Passthrough (Port 7704)

Accepts OpenAI-style requests and forwards them to the local model, returning OpenAI-style responses. Extra sugar added for enhanced capabilities, but the interface is standard OpenAI.

This is what command-center and other services call for real-time inference.

### 2. Async Queue - Long-Running Jobs (Port 7705)

Queue worker for tasks that take minutes/hours:

- **Base model training**: Takes a base model and adds date/time context awareness using a key system. Keys like `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday` are embedded during training - the caller resolves these to actual dates at inference time.
- **Adapter training**: Trains LoRA adapters for specific jarvis nodes. Uses the `IJarvisCommand` examples from a node's command set to teach the model that node's available commands.

Jobs are queued via Redis and processed by the background worker.

```

## Environment Variables

Env vars should only hold sensitive values. All non-sensitive config (model name, context window, etc.) should be in the database via jarvis-settings-client.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `JARVIS_CONFIG_URL` | Config service URL for bootstrap discovery |
| `JARVIS_AUTH_APP_ID` | App ID for inter-service auth |
| `JARVIS_AUTH_APP_KEY` | App key (sensitive) |

## Service Dependencies

**Must be running:**
- `jarvis-auth` (7701) - App-to-app auth
- `jarvis-config-service` (7700) - Service discovery
- `jarvis-logs` (7702) - Centralized logging
- `jarvis-settings-client` - Runtime configuration (model name, context window, etc.)

**Data services (from jarvis-data-stores/):**
- Redis - Job queue for async training tasks

## Dependencies

FastAPI, uvicorn, llama-cpp-python, vllm (optional), jarvis-log-client, jarvis-settings-client, jarvis-config-client, jarvis-auth-client
