# jarvis-config-service

Service discovery and configuration management. The bootstrap service - all other services find each other through this one.

## Running (Port 7700)

```bash
./run.sh --docker              # Start in Docker (standard)
./run.sh --docker --rebuild    # Rebuild after dependency changes
```

## How It Works

Simple FastAPI service that stores and exposes URLs for all jarvis services. Acts as the central registry for service discovery.

- Services use `jarvis-config-client` library to query this service for other service URLs
- `jarvis-admin` dashboard provides UI to register/update service URLs
- Every other service only needs `JARVIS_CONFIG_URL` env var to bootstrap - it discovers everything else from here

## Key Endpoints

- `GET /services` - List all registered services and their URLs
- `GET /services/{name}` - Get specific service URL
- `GET /info` - Service identity info (returns `{"service": "jarvis-config-service"}`, used by network auto-discovery)
- `GET /health` - Health check

## Settings API

Also serves settings CRUD at `/v1/settings` (used by jarvis-admin dashboard for managing runtime settings across services).

## Service Dependencies

**Must be running:**
- `jarvis-auth` (7701) - Auth for admin endpoints
- `jarvis-logs` (7702) - Centralized logging

**Data services (from jarvis-data-stores/):**
- PostgreSQL - Service registry storage

**Note:** This is the bootstrap service - it cannot depend on config-service or settings-client since it IS the config/settings provider.

## Dependencies

FastAPI, uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, jarvis-log-client
