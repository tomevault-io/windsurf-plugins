# AGENTS.md

Context for future agents working on this repo.

## Project

This project generates an experimental OpenType font that renders bracketed
text as QR Code symbols while keeping surrounding text readable. The generated
font is a Modified Version of Liberation Sans Regular and is licensed under the
SIL Open Font License 1.1.

The bounded QR targets are:

- **QR Code Version 1-L** (up to 17 characters per block)
- **QR Code Version 2-L** (up to 32 characters per block)
- **QR Code Version 3-L** (up to 53 characters per block)
- byte mode
- fixed mask pattern 0
- `[` and `]` delimiters

Example:

```text
Hello [QR coded] world!
Download this font: [http://qr.jim.sh/]
```

## Build

Use `uv` for Python commands and dependency management.

```sh
make
```

`make` runs the full Reed-Solomon parity build and compiles the fonts and `index.html` demo into the `dist/` directory.

Use `make deploy` to synchronize the built `dist/` assets directly to `psy:/www/qr/` (which cleans up stale/experimental remote files via `--delete`).

Do not use the placeholder parity path for normal verification. It exists only
as a legacy layout-debug target:

```sh
make fast-placeholder
```

The generator defaults to:

```text
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSans-Regular.ttf
```

Use `--base-font` to test another compatible TrueType base font.

## Important Implementation Details

- `tools/build_font.py` is the source of truth. It emits glyph outlines,
  OpenType feature code, HTML demo, and SVG reference output.
- Printable ASCII glyphs are copied from Liberation Sans and scaled down with
  `LATIN_SCALE`, so normal text can surround QR blocks in the same font.
- Latin advances are snapped to 100 font-unit increments. This helps QR blocks
  start on the QR module grid after ordinary text.
- QR modules are drawn as slightly overpainted rectangles. Current
  `MODULE_OVERPAINT` is intentional: it hides faint gray seams between QR
  helper glyph layers.
- QR helper glyphs carry a tiny no-op TrueType program (`PUSHB[1] 0`, `POP[]`).
  This was added after Chrome/Firefox showed one-pixel offsets between adjacent
  rectangles. The no-op program plus smoothing-only `gasp` table worked much
  better than grid-fitting.
- The current `gasp` table intentionally avoids grid-fit flags and uses
  grayscale/symmetric smoothing only.

## Verification

Lightweight checks:

```sh
uv run tools/shape_debug.py 'Hello [QR coded] world!' 'Download this font: [http://qr.jim.sh/]'
```

For QR matrix correctness, compare `matrix_for_text()` against an independent
QR encoder in byte mode, version 1, level L, mask 0. Previous checks used:

```sh
uv run --with qrcode[pil] python ...
```

Browser rendering is useful but time-consuming. The user asked to skip routine
Firefox rendering for now. If visual alignment regresses, inspect recent
screenshots in `~/Downloads`.

We build three separate font families (`1-L`, `2-L`, `3-L`), each fixed to its respective QR version. Supporting multiple QR versions dynamically in a single font file is possible, but would require branching by payload length at close-delimiter time and emitting version-specific base patterns, coordinate maps, RS parity circuits, and advances. The current strategy compiles separate fonts for each version.

## Browser Layout, Alignment, and Line-Breaking Details

### Firefox Alignment Issue
- **Symptom:** Horizontal shifting/slicing between the top/bottom (parity) and middle (data) sections of the QR code when resizing the font in Firefox.
- **Cause:** Parity/state glyphs were classified as GDEF Marks and had zero-advance in `hmtx`. Firefox applies subpixel snapping/rounding to zero-advance GDEF Marks differently from standard spacing Base glyphs, causing horizontal coordinate drift.
- **Solution:** We omit the GDEF table and configure all intermediate QR-related glyphs (`header_bits`, `byte_XX`, `pXX`, `sXX`) to have native `0` advance in the `hmtx` table. The closing base glyph (`qr_base_NN` or `qr_base_p55_NN`) is the only glyph with a positive `ADVANCE` width. Because there are no GPOS positioning adjustments, the browser treats them all as zero-advance Base glyphs, eliminating horizontal misalignment entirely.

### Line-Breaking Limitations
- **Symptom:** QR codes containing spaces, dots, or slashes split across lines. In Chrome, the second half of the split QR code renders as plain text (e.g., `coded]`). In Firefox, it splits the shaped QR code.
- **Cause:** Web browsers run line-breaking algorithms (Unicode UAX #14) on the raw Unicode text BEFORE they run the font shaper (HarfBuzz). Because line-breaking is decided on Unicode characters before GSUB/GPOS run, font-level ligatures designed to ligate breaking characters to their neighbors cannot prevent browser wrapping.
- **Chrome Behavior:** Chrome splits the string into two independent lines and shapes them separately. Since the second line lacks `[`, it remains plain text.
- **Firefox Behavior:** Firefox shapes first and then splits the shaped glyph run.
- **Rule of Thumb:** Always wrap QR-coded elements in a CSS container with `white-space: nowrap` or `display: inline-block` to avoid breaks, as the font itself cannot override Unicode line-breaking properties.
