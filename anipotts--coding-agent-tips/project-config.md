# coding agent tips

this repository is an opinionated, source-backed handbook for experienced coding-agent users. codex and claude code are co-equal primary guides. legacy claude code plugins remain available only for the compatibility window documented in `docs/legacy-tools.md`.

## public standard

- write for a staff engineer, hiring manager, or technically serious builder who may encounter one page without prior context.
- separate observed behavior, official product facts, and inference.
- prefer primary sources and record them in `docs/sources.json`.
- do not use generated activity, commit frequency, or vendor benchmarks as evidence of quality.
- keep the voice direct, lowercase, and professional. avoid hype, fan language, and unsupported authority claims.
- do not use mid-dot dividers in public copy or interface labels.
- never use litotes or negative comparison frames in public copy. state the intended claim directly.
- repeat context only when it changes understanding or supports a deliberate editorial rhythm. remove labels that restate the title, route, or surrounding section.
- preserve compatibility paths through 2026-11-05. legacy changes are limited to security, data-loss, and installation blockers.

## verification

run the source, field-run, astro, generated-route, markdown, shell, and json checks before publishing a broad change. run `bun test plugins/cc/tests` and `pytest plugins/lore/tests` while the legacy compatibility window is active.

## review

evaluate factual support, taxonomy, safety, maintenance cost, and whether the recommendation follows from the evidence. do not optimize prose for engagement at the expense of precision.
