# CrossKit

One component library with the same API in React, Vue, Svelte and Angular.

Full conventions live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). What follows is only the part that is
non-obvious, repo-specific, and expensive to get wrong — the things worth checking on every change.

## Direction

v2 is a rewrite toward **zero runtime dependencies**. Behaviour that used to come from a third-party
state-machine library is being reimplemented as framework-free TypeScript in `packages/core`, and
`packages/react|vue|svelte|angular` are thin adapters over it.

So: hand-rolled focus traps, positioners and animation primitives in `core` are the intended
design, not something to flag as reinventing a wheel. What *is* worth flagging is any new runtime
dependency in a published `package.json`.

Do not name other UI or behaviour libraries in shipped code, comments, docs or commit messages.

## The rules that catch real bugs

1. **Booleans are presence attributes, never `="false"`.** Everything goes through `dataAttr()`,
   which returns `"" | undefined`. Binding a raw boolean makes some frameworks render
   `data-loading="false"`, and `"false"` *matches* `[data-loading]` in CSS — so the wrong styles
   apply, silently. This is the single most likely cross-framework divergence.

2. **No class names in markup, ever.** Components emit `data-scope`, `data-part` and `data-state`.
   A consumer's `class` lands on the root untouched.

3. **Consumer attributes spread last**, after our own `data-*`, so a consumer — and a composing
   component — can override anything.

4. **Every root part declares its own `display`.** Angular roots can be custom elements, which
   default to `display: inline`. A root that does not state its display is one framework away from
   a different box.

5. **Gate rendering on presence, not on `open`.** Unmounting the instant `open` flips means
   `data-state="closed"` never gets a frame and every exit animation silently does nothing.

6. **Anchored overlays must portal to `document.body`.** The positioner writes viewport
   coordinates and sets `position: fixed`, but `fixed` is captured by any ancestor with a
   `transform`, `filter`, `perspective`, `backdrop-filter`, `contain: paint`, or a `will-change`
   naming one of those — that ancestor becomes the containing block and the popup lands somewhere
   else. (`will-change: opacity` does not; only the properties that would create one themselves.) Portalling is
   the only fix, and it cannot be enforced from `core`.

7. **Prop names are identical in all four adapters.** Only two-way binding differs, each using its
   own framework idiom over the same underlying prop.

8. **CSS ships inside cascade layers** (`@layer ck.reset, ck.tokens, ck.components, ck.overrides`),
   because unlayered consumer CSS then wins regardless of specificity. Authoring outside a layer
   breaks the override story.

9. **Write logical properties, not physical ones** (`margin-inline`, `inset-inline-start`). RTL is a
   tested contract, not a claim.

## Two traps that have each cost real time

- **Ambiguous star exports vanish silently.** Two `export *` sources exporting the same name makes
  it ambiguous, and TypeScript drops it from the barrel rather than erroring — so a type disappears
  from the public API with a clean typecheck *and* a clean build.
- **Playgrounds import built `dist`, not `src`.** Changing source and re-running an e2e suite
  without rebuilding measures the old code. This has produced false greens twice.

## Finding your way around

Two indexes are wired up as MCP servers in `.mcp.json`, and both have a CLI. Reach for them
**before** grepping: 14 workspaces share one small `data-part` vocabulary on purpose, and `label`,
`item`, `title`, `control` and `content` between them account for hundreds of occurrences across
most of the component files — so `rg 'data-part="title"'` returns a large slice of the tree, and
that is the normal case here rather than a bad query.

```bash
codegraph query "useAnchored"          # where a symbol is defined and who imports it
codegraph callers "dataAttr"           # every call site
codegraph impact  "createFormStore"    # what a change would reach
graphify query   "how does a Form.Item bind its child?"   # a subgraph for a question
graphify explain "DatePanel"           # a node and its neighbours, in prose
graphify path "Form" "createFormStore" # how two things are connected
```

`codegraph` answers "where is it and who calls it" from a symbol index; `graphify` answers "how does
this relate to that" from a community-clustered graph. Use `codegraph` for a symbol you can name and
`graphify` for a concept you cannot. `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` is the whole-architecture view —
read it only when `query`/`explain`/`path` do not surface enough, because it is large.

**Neither CLI comes from this repo.** They are installed separately and are not in any
`package.json`, on purpose: they are a reading aid, not a build step. Nothing here depends on them —
if the commands do not exist, this section simply does not apply and normal search still works. CI
never runs them.

**Both indexes are generated and gitignored, so a fresh clone has neither.** Build them once, then
