# TOSS Repository Guide

## Scope

Everything tracked here must be public-safe. Use synthetic data and public
services. Never add credentials, personal data, private hosts, proprietary
assets, downstream deployment configuration, or private material without an
explicit provenance and licensing review. Company-authored open-source
dependencies are allowed when their licenses permit use and redistribution.

## Module ownership

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `web/` | React/Vite application, CodeMirror workspace, browser compiler workers, preview, task center, i18n, and UI composition |
| `backend/` | Rust/Axum modular monolith for REST, realtime collaboration, access, Git, storage, templates, document processing, and runtime asset delivery |
| `workers/` | Public processing SDK and independently deployed, sandboxed processor implementations |
| `protocol/` | Checked-in public and worker OpenAPI contracts plus the isolated browser TypeScript generator toolchain |
| `distributions/community/` | Neutral product configuration, Help content, starter templates, and public Typst catalog |
| `config/` | Safe default deployment topology; secrets are mounted separately and never tracked |
| `prebuilt/` | Reproducible browser-runtime provenance and ignored, fetched package caches |
| `third-party/typst.ts/` | Public Apache-2.0 source submodule pinned to an exact revision |
| `docs/community/` | Public engineering Wiki and accepted architecture decisions |
| `scripts/` | Public-safe build, validation, backup, bootstrap, and smoke-test orchestration |

Generated outputs, caches, test results, and fetched `prebuilt/` packages are
not source. Regenerate them through their owning scripts; never hand-edit or
commit them.

## Architecture boundaries

The backend is a modular monolith organized as vertical bounded contexts:

| Path | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| `backend/src/access/` | Authentication, principals, authorization, organizations, grants, shares, and personal access tokens |
| `backend/src/workspace/` | Projects, files, assets, settings, archives, snapshots, and workspace-owned policy |
| `backend/src/collaboration/` | Realtime transport, rooms, Yjs persistence, and collaboration invalidation |
| `backend/src/versioning/` | Git locking, commits, local history, smart HTTP, merge validation, and rejected-push recovery |
| `backend/src/external_repositories/` | Provider-neutral linking, import, sync, checkpoints, grants, jobs, and provider adapters |
| `backend/src/templates/` | Built-in, personal, and organization-shared template workflows |
| `backend/src/experience/` | Runtime product identity and user-facing content contracts |
| `backend/src/distribution/` | Validated distribution configuration and source-file policy |
| `backend/src/typst_runtime/` | Built-in assets, public package proxying, and cache policy |
| `backend/src/latex_runtime/` | Optional BusyTeX requests, upstream resolution, and cache policy |
| `backend/src/document_processing/` | Durable jobs, immutable inputs, attempts, leases, worker sessions, cancellation, quotas, and artifacts |

Do not create horizontal `application/`, `repositories/`, `services/`, global
`domain/`, or generic CRUD layers. Values and lifecycle states stay with their
owner. Cross-context calls use owner-named facades; queries and locks stay in
owner persistence; multi-context transactions use explicit transactional
facades.

Errors belong to the producing capability; HTTP status and public-code mapping
stay at transport edges. OpenAPI references owner-defined read contracts
directly; do not add field-for-field response copies.

External repository models remain provider-neutral. Provider DTOs, URL rules,
pagination, OAuth refresh, and permission semantics stay under
`external_repositories/provider/<provider>/`.

`protocol/` and `backend/src/protocol/` are integration boundaries, not a shared
domain model. Public API changes regenerate OpenAPI and browser types together;
worker-wire changes regenerate worker OpenAPI separately. Worker credentials
and lifecycle routes never enter the browser generator.

Community begins with immutable `202607120001_baseline.sql` and does not support
in-place upgrades from earlier histories. Never edit, renumber, delete, or
consolidate a published migration. Add forward migrations and validate fresh
install plus upgrade from the latest Community release when a migration
transforms existing data.

## Process, realtime, and compatibility

- Run one Core replica. Process-local rooms and Git locks make shared storage,
  sticky sessions, or a shared database insufficient for horizontal scaling.
- Keep `AppState` at server, HTTP, and WebSocket composition edges. Background
  owners and reusable context workflows receive narrow facades and adapters.
- Core replacement uses one monotonic drain signal and one deadline. Contexts
  stop claims and own repair or retry; do not add independent lifecycle sources
  or a generic activity registry.
- Room APIs return sender and receiver as one atomic subscription. Revalidate
  the effective principal, write capability, and access/content generations
  after subscribing and before bootstrap. Persist accepted Yjs mutations before
  acknowledgement.
- Bump `PROTOCOL_EPOCH` only when an already loaded first-party Web build could
