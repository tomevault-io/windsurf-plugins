# Commit Message Format

Use **Conventional Commits** style for all commit messages.

## Prefixes

- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `refactor:` code restructuring without behavior change
- `docs:` documentation only
- `chore:` build, config, tooling
- `perf:` performance improvements
- `test:` adding/updating tests

## Scope

Use the current project phase as scope when the change is phase-specific:

```
feat(phase4): add obstacle observations to policy
fix(phase4): widen goal sigma to 3.0
```

Omit scope for cross-cutting changes:

```
refactor: extract reward terms into cfg parameters
docs: update changelog for p2a-3 results
```

## Rules

- Subject line must be lowercase, imperative mood, no period at the end
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Use the body (separated by a blank line) for additional context when needed
