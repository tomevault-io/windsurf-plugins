# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a **COMPLETE** reproduction of the research paper "AlphaGo Moment for Model Architecture Discovery" (arXiv:2507.18074) using MLX-LM for autonomous discovery instead of GPT-4, optimized for Apple's MLX framework on Mac Studio with 512GB RAM.

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **FULLY COMPLETE** - The reproduction is finished and working
✅ **LLM-Powered** - Uses MLX-LM (Qwen2.5-0.5B) for autonomous architecture generation  
✅ **Research Integration** - Loads knowledge from ASI-Arch cognition database
✅ **Real Training** - Complete MLX training and evaluation pipeline
✅ **Breakthrough Detection** - LLM-powered analysis and discovery tracking

## Development Commands

### Running the Complete System

```bash
# Run the FULL LLM-powered autonomous discovery
python src/llm_asi_arch.py

# Install dependencies (if needed)
pip install mlx mlx-lm transformers

# Format code
black .
isort .

# Type checking
mypy .
```

### MLX Architecture Conversion System

**Individual Architecture Conversion:**
```bash
# Interactive converter for fixing architectures one by one
python src/convert_single_architecture.py

# Commands available in the interactive mode:
#   list                 - List all architectures and their status
#   convert <index|name> - Convert a specific architecture  
#   verify <name>        - Verify an MLX architecture
#   fix <name>           - Attempt to fix an architecture
#   show <name> [lines]  - Show architecture content
#   status               - Show overall status summary
#   quit                 - Exit
```

**Batch Architecture Conversion:**
```bash
# Convert all 106 architectures at once (may have issues)
python src/pytorch_to_mlx_converter.py

# Test all converted architectures
python test_all_architectures.py
```

**Architecture Status:**
- ✅ **Working**: Architecture converts and verifies successfully
- ❌ **Broken**: Architecture has syntax/import/logic errors  
- ⚪ **Not Converted**: Architecture not yet converted from PyTorch

The single architecture converter allows you to:
1. Convert PyTorch architectures one by one
2. Verify syntax, imports, and structure
3. Apply automatic fixes for common issues
4. View architecture content and debug problems
5. Track conversion progress
