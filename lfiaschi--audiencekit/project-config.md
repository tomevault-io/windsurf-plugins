# AudienceKit

AudienceKit is a Python library for synthetic audience research grounded in
real respondent rows. GSS is the first supported adapter, but core behavior
must stay dataset-agnostic:

- `AudienceFrame` handles weighted respondent sampling for any DataFrame.
- `PersonaTemplate` renders row attributes into persona prompts.
- `Study` defines structured survey instruments.
- `SyntheticPanel` runs studies against an injectable model backend.
- `audiencekit.gss` prepares full GSS files into an AudienceKit frame.

Run commands through `uv run`. Use `uv run --extra dev python -m pytest tests`
for the test suite.

Open-source hygiene:

- Keep generated outputs under `results/` or `examples/*/results/`; do not
  commit fresh run artifacts.
- Keep top-level `skills/` as the canonical agent skill source.
- Frame synthetic audience findings as directional pressure tests, not
  substitutes for fieldwork.
- Do not hard-code GSS assumptions into generic primitives; add new datasets
  as adapters beside `audiencekit.gss`.

GSS variable semantics:

- Before answering questions about GSS variable meanings or changing GSS
  preprocessing, check the official documentation first. Use the
  [2024 GSS Codebook Release 3](https://sda.berkeley.edu/sdaweb/docs/gss24rel3/DOC/GSS2024CodebookR3.pdf)
  and the
  [2024 GSS Release 3 variable guide](https://sda.berkeley.edu/sdaweb/docs/gss24rel3/DOC/GSS2024ReleaseVariablesR3.pdf).
  Do not infer semantics from similar variable names alone, especially income
  variables such as `INCOME16` and `INCOM16`.
