# Deploy And Release

- Production repo: `/Volumes/Wotg Drive Mike/GitHub/Marga-App`, branch `main`, staff URL `app.marga.biz`.
- After verified fixes: commit and push to `main` for Netlify deploy unless the user explicitly says not to push in that message.
- Verify live on `app.marga.biz` with hard refresh (service worker). Sync to `Marga-App-staging` only after production is confirmed.
- Bump `service-worker.js` cache name and script `?v=` versions on deploy.
