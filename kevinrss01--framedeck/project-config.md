# Copyfy Prompt Engineering Rules

Use this file as the source of truth when creating or editing prompts.

## 1) Canonical References

MUST:
- Treat `src/lib/services/ai-gateway/prompts` as the canonical reference for prompt structure, naming, and composition style.
- Keep prompts in dedicated prompt files instead of burying long prompt strings inside orchestration code.
- Follow the existing prompt-folder pattern: typed input, small reusable helpers/constants, and `buildXPrompt()` functions.

## 2) Prompt Construction Rules

MUST:
- Start with a precise role and a single objective.
- Prefer simple, positive instructions over long lists of constraints.
- Be explicit about the expected output, success criteria, scope, and allowed evidence.
- Use variables and typed inputs for dynamic values instead of hardcoding request-specific content.
- Keep prompts concise, direct, and easy to scan.

SHOULD:
- Add examples, schemas, or canonical labels when output shape matters.
- Reuse shared helpers such as `joinSections`, `toJsonBlock`, `toTextBlock`, or shared output rules when the prompt family repeats the same structure.

## 3) Preferred Section Order

Mirror the sectioned style already used in `src/lib/services/ai-gateway/prompts` whenever it fits the task:
- `ROLE`
- `OBJECTIVE`
- `CONTEXT` or source guidance
- `DECISION RULES` or `ANALYSIS RULES`
- `OUTPUT CONTRACT`
- `OUTPUT RULES`
- `INPUTS`

Example pattern:
- `ROLE:`
- `OBJECTIVE:`
- `OUTPUT CONTRACT: Return exactly this JSON shape`
- `OUTPUT RULES: Return ONLY valid JSON`
- `INPUTS:`

## 4) Technique Selection

MUST:
- Use role, system, and contextual prompting by default.
- Use few-shot examples when the model needs help matching a structure, format, edge case, or classification pattern.
- Mix class order in few-shot classification examples instead of repeating the same class sequence.
- Use step-back, Chain of Thought, self-consistency, or ReAct only when the task genuinely needs deeper reasoning or tool use.

SHOULD:
- Start with zero-shot or a strict schema first, then add few-shot examples only if reliability is still weak.
- Keep reasoning internal unless the product requirement explicitly needs visible reasoning steps.

## 5) Output and Reliability Rules

MUST:
- For structured tasks, define the exact output contract and say whether empty or missing evidence should return `null`, `[]`, or an empty string.
- For extraction, classification, or analysis tasks, prefer structured outputs such as JSON.
- For evidence-based tasks, instruct the model to stay conservative, separate observation from inference, and never invent unsupported claims.
- If the prompt depends on formatting compliance, explicitly forbid markdown fences and extra commentary.

## 6) Model Configuration and Iteration

MUST:
- Keep deterministic tasks like extraction, classification, ranking, and validation biased toward low-temperature behavior.
- If Chain of Thought is intentionally used for a single correct answer, prefer temperature `0`.
- Control output length both through model settings and explicit prompt instructions when brevity matters.
- Re-test prompts when model versions, sampling settings, or upstream context change.
- Document important prompt attempts, assumptions, and settings outside the prompt when behavior is being tuned over time.
