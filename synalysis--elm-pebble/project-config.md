# Generic Fusion Only (elmc C Codegen)

Compiler fusion in **elmc** must detect **reusable Elm IR patterns** and emit **generic C** that implements that pattern. It must not replace a function body with one app's algorithm.

Matching IR shape is **not** enough. The emitted C must be correct for **every** app that could match the pattern.

## Allowed

- Pattern detection from IR structure (calls, `List.map`/`foldl`/`all`, bounds checks, grid indexing, case-on-tuple keys).
- Generated C that is a direct, generic lowering of that pattern (for example `y * cols + x` list access, bounds-checked cell update, static table from `case (k, r)` branches).
- Using names from the function being compiled (`name` parameter) for C symbol prefixes — not hardcoded app function names as fusion triggers.
- Reachability metadata derived from IR (`runtime_callees`), not hardcoded callee lists.

## Forbidden

- Emitting magic numbers, layout constants, or control flow copied from one template (for example fixed `top = 30`, wall-kick sequences, spawn position formulas) unless they are **literal values in the matched IR**.
- Fusion gated on a specific function name (`name == "boardLayout"`, `name == "dropStep"`) instead of IR pattern.
- Fusion that would produce **wrong results** for another app with the same structural pattern but different semantics.
- Whole-function rewrites of update/spawn/render logic that belong in app Elm, not the compiler.

## Litmus Test

Before adding or keeping a fusion, ask:

1. Could this IR pattern appear in **multiple unrelated apps**?
2. Does the emitted C implement the **pattern**, or does it implement **one app's function**?
3. If two apps share the pattern but differ in constants or branches, would both stay correct?

If (1) is yes but (2) or (3) is no → **do not fuse**. Let normal codegen emit the Elm semantics.

## Examples

- **Bad:** `BoardLayoutLoop` — matches `displayShapeIsRound` + layout record, but emits elmtris layout math (`gap = 1`, `top = 30`, `diameter * 2/3`). game-2048 uses different gaps, margins, and sizing with the same rough shape.
- **Bad:** `PieceMotionLoop` / `SpawnPieceLoop` — reimplement tetris update/spawn as native C instead of lowering Elm.
- **Good:** `Tuple2CaseTable` — `case (k, r) of …` → static lookup table derived from branch literals in IR.
- **Good:** `CellAtLoop` — `y < 0` guard + `withDefault 0 (listAt board (y * cols + x))` → `elmc_list_nth_int_default(board, y * cols + x, 0)`.

## When Adding Fusion

- Add a **minimal fixture** with the same IR pattern and **different function/field names** to prove genericity.
- Add a **second template or app** when the pattern is domain-shaped (grids, tables) to catch semantic drift.
- If an optimization only helps one sample and cannot be generalized, **remove it** — do not rename it.
