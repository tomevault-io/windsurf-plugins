# Correct Elm → Fix the Toolchain

When application Elm is **semantically correct** (valid Elm, matches intended behavior, uses declared APIs), failures belong in the **toolchain**, not in app code.

Fix at the root in: parser, tokenizer, IR/lowering, **elmc**, **elmx**, **elm_ex**, runtime, debugger, IDE, emulator glue — wherever the bug actually lives.

## Do Not

- Rewrite app/template Elm to dodge codegen, runtime, or IDE bugs (for example replacing `case activePiece model of … piece ->` with manual field reads from `model`).
- Add “works around elmc” patterns in `Main.elm`, templates, or samples when the Elm you wrote is what a normal Elm compiler would accept.
- Ship one-app shims in the compiler to make a single template pass (see also **Generic Code Rules**).
- Ask apps to rename `Msg` constructors so platform shims recognize them (`CurrentDateTime`, `HourChanged`, etc.) — tags must come from the call site in the cmd/sub, not name-guess lists (see **Msg and Cmd wiring** in Generic Code Rules).

## Do

- Treat correct Elm as the specification; make the toolchain match Elm semantics and project contracts.
- Add or extend **toolchain tests** (elmc/elmx/elm_ex/ide) that reproduce the bug from minimal IR or Elm, then fix the implementation.
- Prefer fixes that apply to **all** apps with the same language construct (patterns, types, subscriptions), not one project slug.
- Change app Elm only when the Elm was wrong, incomplete, or intentionally adopting a new contract.

## Safety Goal

On-device/watch behavior should not fault on well-typed, memory-safe Elm logic — same spirit as Elm on the web. The only acceptable hard crash from normal app logic is **out-of-memory** (or equivalent platform resource exhaustion), not bad codegen or wrong runtime representation.

## Examples

- **Bad:** `dropStep` uses `if hasPiece model` and `model.pieceY` because `case activePiece` codegen passes the `Maybe` wrapper to `elmc_record_get`.
- **Good:** fix `Elmc.Backend.CCodegen.Patterns` so `Nothing` + bare-var `case` binds the Just payload (like elmx already does).

- **Bad:** special-case `game-elmtris` in `elmc` or the IDE.
- **Good:** a codegen test for `case maybe of Nothing -> …; x -> …` and a generic `bind_pattern` fix.

- **Bad:** `getCurrentDateTime` emits only command kind; runtime uses `pick_tag(..., ["CurrentDateTime", "GotCurrentDateTime"])`.
- **Good:** encode `constructor_tag_expr(to_msg)` in the cmd tuple (like `storageReadInt`); runtime dispatches the tag from the queued cmd.

## When Changing the Toolchain

- Prove the fix with a focused test in the package you changed, plus a second fixture/template when the path is shared.
- Do not “fix” the emulator or debugger by patching runtime model in ways that hide compiler bugs unless that layer is genuinely the owner of the contract.
