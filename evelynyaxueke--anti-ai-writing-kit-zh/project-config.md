# AGENTS.md

Guidance for agents maintaining this skill folder.

## Repository contract

This is a portable Simplified Chinese writing skill for drafting, editing, rewriting, polishing, and reviewing prose without common Chinese AI-writing tells.

`SKILL.md` is the complete default skill and the single source of truth for default rules, explanations, phrase lists, and examples. Keep its load and delivery gates near the top and its EOF marker at the end.

There is no package installation or build step. Scripts use Node.js standard-library modules only.

## Key files

- `SKILL.md`: metadata, operating instructions, complete default rules, explanations, phrase lists, and examples.
- `scripts/print-active-rules.mjs`: deterministic full-skill loading, chunking, checksum validation, and preference resolution.
- `scripts/print-customization.mjs`: deterministic customization plan, category overview, exact section/subsection output, and next-step resolution.
- `scripts/check-final.mjs`: active-rule verification, candidate transport checks, word bounds, and final receipt.
- `scripts/scan-writing.mjs`: deterministic Chinese mechanical and candidate checks. It cannot judge meaning or truth.
- `tests/*.test.mjs`: loader, scanner, and final-gate regression tests.
- `operations/kit-operations.md`: loading, customization, reset, additions, maintenance, and fixed replies.
- `README.md`: public manual.
- `agents/openai.yaml`: optional interface metadata.
- `skill-customized.md`: a complete standalone customized skill created locally on request. Never commit, overwrite, or silently migrate it.

## Ownership

Change the smallest applicable layer, then synchronize affected layers:

- Every public writing rule, explanation, phrase list, and example belongs in `SKILL.md`.
- Add a scanner rule only when an exact or clearly labeled candidate check is safe.
- Add a regression test for every scanner or loader behavior change.
- Customization, reset, and fixed replies belong in operations.
- Public behavior belongs in README.

A new V2 `skill-customized.md` is the only active skill source and contains the operating instructions plus all eight writing sections. Older compact and legacy files remain supported as preference layers over `SKILL.md`.

## Rule editing

Before adding a rule, search `SKILL.md`, the scanner, and tests for the exact phrase, close variants, and root problem. Prefer revising one rule to adding a near-duplicate.

Keep rules short and actionable. State what to do instead. Check that cleanup does not make Chinese prose stiff, over-oral, vague, or artificially rough.

Send every normal add-rule, remember-rule, or save-rule request to `skill-customized.md`. Do not offer users a choice between the customized file and `SKILL.md`. Treat a deliberate change to the repository's shipped defaults as maintainer work with its own validation and release.

## Verification

Before finishing a change:

1. Confirm EOF markers in SKILL, operations, standalone custom, and older compact custom fixtures.
2. Confirm `SKILL.md` remains the complete source for public rules, explanations, phrase lists, and examples.
3. Run `node --check scripts/*.mjs`.
4. Run `node --test tests/*.test.mjs`.
5. Test default, whitespace-only, standalone, malformed standalone and compact, older compact, legacy, and chunked custom files.
6. Verify the custom template preserves valid YAML metadata and contains the operating instructions, maintenance section, all eight numbered sections, and the skill EOF marker.
7. Test Chinese punctuation, stock openings and closings, false contrast, majority hooks, vocabulary, rhythm, code masking, Chinese length bounds, and the final receipt.
8. Keep README and operations aligned with actual behavior.
9. Test every customization ID from `print-customization.mjs --sequence`, exact subsection output, category overviews, and next-step transitions.
10. Never claim a local PASS receipt proves equality with a later assistant message.

## Publishing

Remove generated local files and keep `LICENSE` in the repository root. Do not publish unless the user asks.
