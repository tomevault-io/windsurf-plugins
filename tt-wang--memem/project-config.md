# memem — Persistent Memory & Context Assembly

You have access to a persistent memory system via memem. This memory persists across sessions, self-evolves, and gets smarter over time.

Storage: Obsidian vault at `~/obsidian-brain/memem/memories/` (markdown files, single source of truth).
Machine index: SQLite FTS5 at `~/.memem/search.db` for fast retrieval.

## Auto-recall

The UserPromptSubmit hook fires on every message and builds an `active_memory_slice` from the current query. This uses your message to activate the relevant working-state memories and produces a focused slice — not a raw index dump.

For deeper recall during the session, use the MCP tools below.

## Layered recall (v0.10)

Memories are organized into layers:
- **L0 (always-loaded):** project identity — tech stack, repo structure, core conventions. Full content is injected at session start.
- **L1 (generic conventions):** broadly useful patterns (testing, style, commit conventions)
- **L2 (domain-specific):** most memories — the default bucket
- **L3 (rare/archival):** niche failure modes, one-off lessons

**At session start** you receive an L0 briefing (full content) plus a compact index of L1-L3 memories (~50 tokens each: `[id] L<layer> title — snippet`). Use this index to decide what to drill into.

**During the session**, use the 3-tier recall workflow:

1. **`memory_search(query)`** — compact index (~50 tok/result). Returns IDs + titles + 1-line snippets. Use FIRST to narrow candidates cheaply.
2. **`memory_get(ids=[...])`** — full content (~500 tok/result). Use AFTER memory_search when you know which specific memories you need.
3. **`memory_timeline(memory_id)`** — chronological thread via `related[]` graph + same-project window. Use when you need the narrative around a memory (what led to it, what came after).

`memory_recall` (legacy) still works as a backward-compat alias that's equivalent to memory_search + memory_get on top results.

**Always-wake recall** — the `UserPromptSubmit` hook runs `active_memory_slice` on every prompt. Topic overlap is tracked only for telemetry and tuning; it no longer gates activation. You don't need to call it manually.

**Graph traversal** — `memory_search` and `memory_get` automatically follow the `related[]` field one hop and include linked memories in a separate section.

## Auto-save

When you complete significant work, save non-obvious lessons:

Call `mcp__memem__memory_save` with:
- `content`: The key insight (one per save, keep it atomic)
- `title`: Short descriptive title
- `tags`: Comma-separated relevant tags

**Save these (durable knowledge):**
- User preferences, corrections, conventions
- Architecture decisions with rationale
- Environment facts, tool quirks, project structure
- Non-obvious lessons learned from failures

**Do NOT save these (use transcript_search instead):**
- Task progress, session outcomes, what was worked on today
- Completed-work logs or TODO state
- Trivial or obvious facts easily re-discovered from code

## Starting the miner (opt-in)

memem is **opt-in** as of v0.9.0 — install does not start any background processes. The miner daemon only runs once the user explicitly enables it. Opt-in is tracked by the marker file `~/.memem/.miner-opted-in`.

When the user asks to start memem, start mining, enable memory extraction, or similar — **identify which of the two modes they want** and run the matching commands:

**Mode 1 — "start mining new sessions" / "start the miner" / "enable memem" / "start memem"** (no history):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.memem && touch ~/.memem/.miner-opted-in
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/memem/miner-wrapper.sh" start
```
Then tell the user: the miner is running, it will mine new sessions automatically ~5 min after they end, and it will auto-start on future Claude Code launches.

**Mode 2 — "mine everything" / "mine history" / "mine all my past sessions" / "include history"** (full history + ongoing):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.memem && touch ~/.memem/.miner-opted-in
nohup PYTHONPATH="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" python3 -m memem.server --mine-all > ~/.memem/mine-all.log 2>&1 &
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/memem/miner-wrapper.sh" start
```
Then tell the user: history mining is running in the background (log at `~/.memem/mine-all.log`), the ongoing miner is also running, and they can continue working normally. Warn them if the session count is large that this may take up to an hour and uses Haiku API credits.

**If unsure which mode the user wants, ask.** Don't default — the difference matters (API cost, time).

**To stop / opt out:** `python3 -m memem.server --miner-opt-out` (stops daemon and removes marker so it won't auto-start next time).

## Available tools

| Tool | What |
|------|------|
| `memory_save` | Store a lesson, pattern, or convention |
| `memory_search` | **[Layer 1]** Compact index search — returns ~50 tok/result, use first |
| `memory_get` | **[Layer 2]** Full content fetch by IDs — use after memory_search |
| `memory_timeline` | **[Layer 3]** Chronological thread via related[] graph |
| `memory_recall` | (legacy) Search + fetch full content — prefer search+get for token efficiency |
| `memory_list` | List all memories with stats |
