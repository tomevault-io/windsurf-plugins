# TDD Workflow

Medium and large changes MUST follow strict Test-Driven Development:

1. **Red**: Write tests that describe expected behavior. Run `npm test` — they must FAIL.
2. **Green**: Write the minimum code to make tests pass. Run `npm test` — they must PASS.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up implementation while keeping tests green.

## What counts as medium/large?
- New features or commands
- New modules or components
- Refactors touching more than one file
- Changes to public API signatures

## What is exempt?
- Config changes, dependency bumps
- Documentation-only edits
- Cosmetic fixes under 10 lines

## Test structure
- Tests live in `src/tests/`, mirroring `src/` file names
- Use Vitest: `describe`, `it`, `expect`
- Run: `npm test` (once) or `npm run test:watch` (continuous)
