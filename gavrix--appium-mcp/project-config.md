# Project Structure

The project is structured to separate the core server logic from the individual tool implementations.

- **`[server.js](mdc:server.js)`**: This is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the `McpServer`, sets up shared state (`sharedState`) and common dependencies (`toolDependencies`), and then dynamically loads and registers all available tools.

- **`tools/`**: This directory contains the implementation for each individual tool that the MCP server exposes.
    - Each tool is defined in its own JavaScript file, e.g., `[tools/startSession.js](mdc:tools/startSession.js)`, `[tools/launchApp.js](mdc:tools/launchApp.js)`, etc.
    - Each tool file exports a factory function named `create<ToolName>Tool` (e.g., `createStartSessionTool`).
    - This factory function accepts `sharedState` and `dependencies` as arguments and returns a tool definition object.
    - The tool definition object has the following structure:
        - `name` (string): The programmatic name of the tool.
        - `description` (string): A human-readable description of what the tool does.
        - `schema` (object): A Zod schema defining the arguments the tool expects. For tools not requiring arguments, this is typically an empty object `{}`.
        - `handler` (async function): The function that contains the actual logic for the tool. This handler receives the tool's arguments (if any) and has access to `sharedState` (e.g., `appiumDriver`) and `dependencies` (e.g., `logToFile`, `zod`) through a closure.

- **Log Files**:
    - `mcp-server.log`: General server logs.
    - `device_console.log`: Logs captured from the connected iOS simulator (specifically filtered for React Native logs during `start_session`).

JSDoc type annotations are used throughout the codebase for better type clarity and IntelliSense support.
