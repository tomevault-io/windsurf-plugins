# Container Layer Test

This repo tests the **container-layer** skill for Claude Code on the Web.

## What happens on session start

The `SessionStart` hook in `.claude/settings.json` runs `boot-ccotw.sh`, which:
1. Bootstraps the container-layer skill from `oaustegard/claude-skills`
2. Applies the `Containerfile` — fetching skills and installing packages
3. Caches the result as a tarball in GitHub Releases (if `GH_TOKEN` is set)
4. On subsequent sessions, restores from cache instead of rebuilding

## Verifying it worked

After boot, try:
```
python3 -c "import httpx; print(httpx.__version__)"
ls /mnt/skills/user/
```

## Credentials

For caching to work, create a `.env` file (gitignored) with:
```
GH_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

Without it, the layer still builds — it just can't cache/restore.

## Customizing

Edit `Containerfile` to change what gets installed. The format is a
Dockerfile subset: `FETCH`, `RUN`, `ENV`, `WORKDIR`, `SNAPSHOT`.
