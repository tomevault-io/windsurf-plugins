# AGENTS.md — omniverse-labs

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## What this repo is

**omniverse-labs** is NVIDIA Omniverse’s public sketchpad: early samples, integration experiments, reference patterns, and proof-of-concept apps that compile and run but have **no support SLA**. Code may change without notice; presence here does not imply a product roadmap commitment.

**Audience:** developers evaluating or building on Omniverse libraries (`ovrtx`, `ovphysx`, `ovstorage`, etc.) who want forkable starting points, not polished production SDKs.

**License:** Apache 2.0 ([LICENSE](LICENSE)).

| Area | Purpose | When to touch |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `samples/` | Self-contained runnable code | Adding or fixing experiments, skills, scripts |
| `_unpublished/` | Draft placeholders (not on Pages) | WIP before explicit publish; see `_unpublished/README.md` |
| `docs/` | Public marketing/showcase site | New write-ups, cards on the home grid |
| Root `README.md` | Repo positioning | Rarely; keep in sync with major scope changes |

Samples and site projects are **independent**: a sample can exist without a `docs/` card, and a `docs/` article can link to external or future code.

---

## Working on samples

### Before you change code

1. Read the sample’s `README.md` (YAML frontmatter + body).
2. Note **Status**: `Working` | `Partial` | `Concept` — do not claim end-to-end success for `Concept` samples.
3. Install only the Omniverse pip packages listed in frontmatter (`omniverse_libraries`), using **pip package names** (e.g. `ovrtx`, `ovphysx`), not Kit extension IDs.
4. Respect platform notes in `tested_platforms`; many samples need a GPU or extra credentials (S3, NGC) — the README states this.

### Required sample structure

Follow [`samples/NEW_SAMPLE_TEMPLATE.md`](samples/NEW_SAMPLE_TEMPLATE.md). Summary:

- Folder: `samples/<kebab-case-name>/`
- **No loose files at sample root** — code in `source/`, assets in `data/`, config in `config/`, optional `skills/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `tools/`
- Every `README.md` **must** start with the YAML frontmatter block defined in the template
- **Self-contained** — no imports from other sample directories
- If something cannot run, set status to `Concept` and document what broke

### Sample types (`type` in frontmatter)

`snippet` | `example` | `demo` | `template` | `tutorial` | `benchmark` | `skill`

Use `skills/` and `skills_included: true` when the sample ships agent-callable skill definitions.

### Creating a new sample

```bash
# From repo root — copy scaffold if _template exists, else create layout manually
cp -r samples/_template samples/your-sample-name   # when _template is present
```

Then fill frontmatter, implement under `source/`, and complete the pre-PR checklist in `NEW_SAMPLE_TEMPLATE.md`.

### Agent-specific expectations

- Prefer **minimal diffs** that match existing layout and naming in sibling samples.
- Do not add cross-sample shared libraries at repo root without maintainer direction.
- Do not commit secrets (`.env`, API keys, machine-specific absolute paths).
- Binary assets **> 5 MB**: flag for maintainer review before adding.
- Update `version` in frontmatter on breaking changes (SemVer).
- When adding skills, keep definitions in `skills/` and document them under README **Skills**.

## Working on the docs site (`docs/`)

Static site; no build step beyond GitHub Pages uploading `docs/` as-is.

### Local preview

```bash
python -m http.server 8080 --directory docs
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/`. Cards load from `docs/data/projects.json` via `docs/assets/js/main.js`.

### Add a home-grid project or article

1. Copy `docs/projects/_template.html` → `docs/projects/<slug>/index.html`
2. Add an entry to `docs/data/projects.json` (`slug`, `title`, `subtitle`, `type`, `status`, `date`, `image`, `accent`, `links`, etc.)
3. Add `docs/assets/images/<card>.svg` (or PNG)
4. Keep contributor-only guides off the public grid — surface **about**, **samples**, and real experiments

**Project `type` values in JSON:** `article` | `project` | `sample` | `tool` | `concept` (see `TYPE_LABELS` in `main.js`).

**Status in JSON:** `working` | `partial` | `concept` (lowercase; drives badge CSS).

Do not add internal-only or placeholder cards to the home grid.

### Unpublished drafts (`_unpublished/`)
