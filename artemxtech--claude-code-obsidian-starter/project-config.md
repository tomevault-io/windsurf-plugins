- `"morning routine"` - Start your day
- `"get my projects"` - See all projects
- `"who needs follow-up?"` - Check clients
- `"sync my meetings"` - Sync Granola meetings to vault

## Output Preferences

When querying data, **present as markdown table**. Use grep to extract frontmatter - don't read full files.
