# Shared cARL Adapter Loader

This repository uses **cARL** as its authoritative agent governance system.

This file is located at `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot compatibility, but it is also the **shared cARL adapter loader** for all harness shims. Other harness entrypoints (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .cursor/rules/carl.mdc, .agents/rules/carl.md) are shims that point here.

This file is a loader, not the source of governance truth.

Do not treat this file as the complete operating model. Use it to hydrate, apply, and reconcile the canonical cARL artefacts.

---

## Authority model

Canonical governance lives in:

1. `.github/carl/memory.md`
2. `.github/carl/current-pr-contract.md`
3. `.github/carl/invariants.yml`
4. `.github/carl/trust-boundaries.md`
5. `.github/carl/tool-policy.yml`
6. `.github/carl/plans/`
7. `.github/instructions/`

Harness-specific files such as `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, and `ANTIGRAVITY.md` are adapters. They may load, summarise, or route to cARL, but they are not the canonical governance authority.

If prompt/session memory conflicts with cARL artefacts, trust cARL and report the conflict.

If `.github/carl/memory.md` conflicts with current repository state, current repository state wins and memory should be updated.

---

## Required lifecycle

For every repository task, follow this lifecycle.

### 1. Hydrate before planning or implementation

Before planning, editing, or writing files, read the relevant cARL artefacts:

- `.github/carl/current-pr-contract.md`
- `.github/carl/memory.md`
- `.github/carl/invariants.yml`
- `.github/carl/trust-boundaries.md`
- `.github/carl/tool-policy.yml`
- any relevant files in `.github/carl/plans/`
- any relevant instruction packs in `.github/instructions/`

At minimum, identify:

- active goal;
- approved scope;
- forbidden scope;
- non-goals;
- invariants;
- trust boundaries;
- validation requirements;
- stop conditions;
- escalation triggers.

Do not begin implementation until the current PR contract and relevant invariants are understood.

### 2. Apply cARL during execution

During implementation:

- stay within the active PR contract;
- preserve all invariants unless the user explicitly approves a governance amendment;
- prefer small, reversible changes;
- follow existing repository patterns before introducing new ones;
- avoid unrelated refactors;
- classify tool actions against `.github/carl/tool-policy.yml`;
- stop if the requested change crosses forbidden scope or an escalation trigger.

For significant, long, nested, security-sensitive, trust-boundary-changing, or model-comparison tasks, prefer prompt-as-code in `.github/carl/plans/` over large UI prompts.

### 3. Validate contract, implementation, and tests together

Validation must prove the approved behaviour, not merely the implementation that happened to be written.

For non-trivial work:

- identify contract assertions before implementation;
- ensure tests or manual checks map back to those assertions;
- run the repository’s relevant validation commands when possible;
- report any validation that could not be run.

If tests fail, do not treat the task as complete. Report the failure, suspected cause, and proposed next action.

### 4. Reconcile cARL and documentation before final response

Before finalising, decide whether the change updates durable project truth.

Update the relevant documentation and cARL artefacts when the change affects:

- behaviour;
- assumptions;
- commands;
- scope;
- roadmap;
- operating model;
- invariants;
- trust boundaries;
- validation expectations;
- stable field findings;
- recurring workflow hazards.

Do not update cARL mechanically for every edit. cARL artefacts are durable governance records, not a per-turn session diary.

If no cARL or documentation update is required, explicitly state why.

### 5. Report completion clearly

Final responses must include:

- summary
- changes
- tests run/not run
- cARL/docs update decision
- risks

In Plan-only mode, still use the same headings and explicitly report:

- no code changes proposed;
- no tests run;
- whether any cARL/docs update is proposed.

---

## Operating modes

Default to Plan-only mode unless the user explicitly approves implementation.

Use mode selection in this order:

1. If the user explicitly requests `automatic mode`, use Automatic mode.
2. Else if the user explicitly approves implementation with words such as `implement`, `apply`, `make the change`, `proceed`, or `approved`, use Assisted implementation mode.
3. Else use Plan-only mode.

### Plan-only mode

In Plan-only mode:

- do not edit files;
- do not run tests;
- provide a plan;
- identify expected files;
- identify validation steps;
- identify cARL/docs updates likely to be required.

### Assisted implementation mode

Use when the user explicitly approves implementation.

If implementation scope is unclear, pause and ask for clarification before writing.

### Automatic mode

Use only when the user explicitly writes `automatic mode`.

Automatic mode still requires cARL hydration, scope control, validation, and reconciliation.

## Core engineering rules

Preserve these rules unless the current PR contract explicitly amends them:
