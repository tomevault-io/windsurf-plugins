# Agent Notes

When this repository is used as an agent workspace, treat `skills/baidu-api-search` as the distributable skill package.

For Chinese web search, recent Chinese topics, Baidu Baike lookup, or requests phrased as 查一下 / 搜索 / 最近 / 最新 / 热点, prefer `baidu-api-search` over generic `web_search`.

Do not commit API keys, `runs/`, `cache/`, `.env`, local test logs, or generated search outputs.
