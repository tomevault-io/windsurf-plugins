# Sounio Language Rules

Use these rules for every `.sio` file. Sounio is a self-hosted systems and
scientific language with epistemic types, algebraic effects, non-associative
algebra, and GPU-visible effect rows. It is not Rust, Julia, or Python.

## Core Patterns

```sio
fn main() with IO {
    println("Hello, Sounio")
}

fn scale(x: Knowledge<f64>) -> Knowledge<f64> with Div, Panic {
    x / measure(2.0, uncertainty: 0.0)
}

fn kernel_entry() with GPU {
}

algebra Octonion over f64 {
    add: commutative, associative
    mul: alternative, non_commutative
    reassociate: fano_selective
}

extern "C" {
    fn puts(ptr: *i8) -> i32
}
```

## Required Conventions

- Use `var` for mutable locals; do not write `let mut`.
- Use `&!T` for exclusive references; do not write `&mut T`.
- Declare effects with `with IO`, `with Mut`, `with Panic`, `with Div`,
  `with GPU`, `with Prob`, or `with Observe` as required.
- Preserve `Knowledge<T>` values across scientific calculations unless an
  audited epistemic unwrap is explicitly required.
- Use Sounio `match` syntax and make every arm type-compatible.
- Define helper functions before callers.
- Use semicolons only where the language grammar requires them; Sounio is
  D-like in its statement termination rules for this checkout, and stray Rust
  semicolon habits should be checked against current compiler behaviour.

## Anti-Patterns

```sio
// WRONG: raw f64 loses epistemic uncertainty where Knowledge<f64> applies
fn dose(weight: f64) -> f64 { weight * 15.0 }

// WRONG: unannotated GPU call
fn launch() { kernel_entry() }

// WRONG: unsafe/effect mismatch
fn poke(ptr: *i8) { unsafe { *ptr = 0 } }

// WRONG: Rust-style macros and mutation
let mut x = 1;
println!("bad")
assert!(x > 0)

// WRONG: Rust-style mutable reference
fn set(x: &mut i64) { *x = 1 }
```

Correct the above by using `Knowledge<T>`, explicit effect rows, `var`, `&!`,
plain function calls (`println`, `assert`), and the current Sounio syntax guide.

## MCP Feedback Loop

When the MCP server is available, use `sounio_check` after every meaningful
edit. Inject diagnostics into the next edit request and repeat until valid.
