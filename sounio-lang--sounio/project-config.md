description: Binding attention governance — 5=1+2; P0 queue and agent bus before writes
---


# Attention Charter (5 = 1 + 2)

Before write-bearing work in this repo:

1. Read `.claude/ATTENTION_CHARTER.md` and `.claude/attention_p0.v1.json`.
2. Run `bash scripts/dev/attention_brief.sh` or MCP `attention_p0` + `coord_brief`.
3. Claim an exact write-set (`bin/sounio-coord claim` or MCP `coord_claim`).
4. Only P0 work that closes **1** (compiler sovereignty) or **2** (epistemic honesty) may hold attention. Garden/science without a trust/compiler gate is read-only by default.
5. Talk to other agents via `coord_send` / `coord_inbox` / `coord_ack` (or `bin/sounio-coord`). Ack after acting.
6. `/workspace/sounio` is the control surface, not a heavy compile bench — use a dedicated worktree for implementation.
7. Halt with a typed blocker or handoff containing `Next-Command` is a valid deliverable.

Do not invent a parallel coordination system. The bus is `bin/sounio-coord` + MCP `sounio-coord`.
