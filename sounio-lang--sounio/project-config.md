# Sounio Effects System

Every function that performs a side effect MUST declare it with `with`. Missing effects = compile error.

## Effect Reference

| Effect | When Required | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `IO` | `println()`, `print()`, file I/O, env access | `fn greet() with IO { println("hi") }` |
| `Mut` | Mutating via `&!`, `var` reassignment in &! context | `fn set(x: &!i32) with Mut { *x = 5 }` |
| `Div` | Division `/` or modulo `%` | `fn half(x: f64) -> f64 with Div, Panic { x / 2.0 }` |
| `Panic` | Array access `arr[i]`, `assert()`, `as` casts | `fn get(a: [i64; 4], i: i64) -> i64 with Panic { a[i as usize] }` |
| `Alloc` | Heap allocation (Vec, Box) | Rare in most code |
| `Async` | Async operations | `async fn fetch() with Async { }` |
| `GPU` | GPU kernel execution | `kernel fn k() with GPU { }` |
| `Prob` | Probabilistic sampling | `fn sample() with Prob { }` |

## Rules

1. **Pure functions** have NO `with` clause: `fn add(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64 { a + b }`
2. **Div always pairs with Panic**: Division can panic on zero, so both are needed
3. **Effects propagate upward**: A caller must declare all effects of its callees
4. **Multiple effects**: `fn process() with IO, Mut, Panic, Div { }`

## Common Patterns

```sio
// Pure — no effects
fn square(x: i64) -> i64 { x * x }

// IO only
fn hello() with IO { println("Hello") }

// Mutation
fn increment(c: &!i64) with Mut { *c = *c + 1 }

// Division (always with Panic)
fn average(a: f64, b: f64) -> f64 with Div, Panic { (a + b) / 2.0 }

// Array processing (Panic for bounds checks)
fn sum(arr: [i64; 4]) -> i64 with Panic {
    var total: i64 = 0
    for i in 0..4 { total = total + arr[i as usize] }
    total
}

// Main — usually needs everything
fn main() with IO, Mut, Panic, Div {
    // ...
}
```

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting `Panic` when accessing arrays: `arr[i as usize]` needs `Panic`
- Forgetting `Mut` when using `&!` references
- Forgetting `IO` when calling `println()` or `print()`
- Forgetting `Div` when using `/` or `%`
- Not propagating effects from callees to callers
