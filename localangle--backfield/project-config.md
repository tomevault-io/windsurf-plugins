description: Python readability and structure conventions for Backfield

# Python Standards

- Prefer **strict typing**: type hints on public functions, methods, and module-level values where the type is not obvious from context. Avoid `Any` unless unavoidable; prefer concrete types, unions, generics, or `TypedDict` when a full Pydantic model is not warranted.
- Prefer **Pydantic** for structured data: use `BaseModel` (or existing project models such as `GraphSpec` and SQLModel row types) for HTTP bodies, validated JSON, and config shapes. Parse at boundaries; do not thread raw untyped `dict`/`list` through multiple layers when a model fits.
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` in new modules when it keeps forward references and annotations readable (match surrounding files in the same package).
- Put imports at the top of the file unless a local import is needed to avoid a circular import or heavy optional dependency.
- If you use a local import, add a short comment explaining why.
- Prefer human readability over idiomatic cleverness.
- Split large functions into smaller focused helpers, including private helpers, when that improves scanning the file.
- Use descriptive names for functions, classes, variables, and tests.
- Avoid speculative abstraction or generic helpers that only serve one call site.
