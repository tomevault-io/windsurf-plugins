description: Database schema and migration conventions for Backfield
---


# Database Standards

- Database tables must be namespaced by app prefix such as `agate_` or `stylebook_`.
- Keep schema ownership in `packages/backfield-db`; do not duplicate table contracts across apps.
- Treat indexing as part of schema design. Add indexes intentionally for expected lookup, join, and filter paths.
- Keep model names, migration behavior, and database docs aligned.
- Prefer explicit migrations and readable schema changes over clever shortcuts.
