# Backfield Agent Guide

Use this file for engineering and agent conventions in this repository. Keep it short, then follow
the linked docs for details. **Human contributors** should start with
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (setup, PR process, project status). This file remains the
canonical agent/engineering checklist.

## Repo map

- `apps/agate-api`: FastAPI service for projects, flows, templates, runs, processed-item review, and node metadata.
- `apps/agate-ui`: React/React Flow application for building flows and reviewing runs.
- `apps/worker`: Celery execution, Backfield Output persistence, and background Stylebook and semantic-indexing jobs.
- `apps/stylebook-api`: FastAPI service for catalogs, canonical entities, candidates, cleanup, activity, relationships, geocoding, and bundles.
- `apps/stylebook-ui`: Stylebook catalog, candidate, cleanup, activity, and relationship interfaces.
- `apps/api-playground`: Developer-only public API schema explorer; project API keys remain in
  browser memory only.
- `apps/core-api`: Sessions, users, organization and project administration, integrations, AI configuration, and `/public/v1`.
- `packages/backfield-agate`: `agate-runtime` graph types, execution, run helpers, node definitions, metadata, and node-panel source files.
- `packages/backfield-ai`: Model resolution, LiteLLM integration, embeddings, AI call accounting,
  and flagship curated presets generated from LiteLLM's model catalog.
- `packages/backfield-ui`: Shared React components and `@backfield/ui/nodeOutputs`.
- `packages/backfield-auth`: Session, service, and project API-key authentication.
- `packages/backfield-observability`: Runtime identity, CloudWatch EMF metric emission, and shared observability helpers.
- `packages/backfield-db`: SQLModel models, database sessions, encryption, seeding, and Alembic migrations.
- `packages/backfield-entities`: Entity registry, catalog resolution, canonicalization, public queries, ingest, cleanup, connections, and semantic synchronization.
- `packages/backfield-cli`: Stack lifecycle, migration, seeding, and data-maintenance commands.
- `infra/docker-compose.yml`: Local multi-service stack (localhost-bound ports).

## Canonical commands

- `make bootstrap`: install Python workspace dependencies with `uv`; see [local setup](docs/development/local-setup.md).
- `make up` / `make down`: start and stop the local stack. These are thin wrappers around the **`backfield` CLI** (`backfield up` / `backfield down`), which is the source of truth for stack operations. `make down` stops this Compose project only—it does **not** prune Docker globally. Use `make docker-trim` / `make docker-trim-full` when you explicitly want host-wide cleanup (full also prunes unused volumes).
- `make logs`: follow stack logs (wraps `backfield logs`). `backfield ps` / `backfield restart` list and restart containers.
- `make migrate`: run Alembic via the one-off Compose **`migrate`** service. Use `make migrate-host` (or `backfield migrate`) for the host CLI path against local Postgres.
- `make lint`: run Ruff checks.
- `make test`: run unit, integration, and structural tests.
- `make smoke-fast` / `make smoke` / `make smoke-observability`: live-stack smoke; see [testing](docs/development/testing.md).

## Docs map

- `README.md`: product story, project status, and local quick start.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md): human contribution entry point.
- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md): audience-based documentation index.
- [`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md): application and package boundaries and dependency direction.
- [`docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`](docs/OBSERVABILITY.md): application metrics / EMF contract with backfield-cloud.
- [`docs/development/entities/overview.md`](docs/development/entities/overview.md): entity model; use with `.cursor/skills/add-entity-type`.
- [`docs/development/nodes.md`](docs/development/nodes.md): Agate node contracts and checklists; use with `.cursor/skills/add-agate-node`.
- [`docs/development/frontend/conventions.md`](docs/development/frontend/conventions.md): shared frontend and user-facing copy rules.
- [`docs/development/testing.md`](docs/development/testing.md): validation ladder and smoke-test guidance.
- [`docs/development/local-setup.md`](docs/development/local-setup.md): prerequisites, first run, stack commands, and local data lifecycle.

## Engineering posture

- Think before coding. If the request is ambiguous, surface assumptions instead of guessing.
- Keep changes surgical. Every changed line should trace back to the task.
- Prefer existing commands, docs, and package boundaries over inventing new workflows.
- Update the matching source-of-truth doc when behavior, architecture, or operations change.
- Keep work reviewable: one task per branch, one coherent diff, no unrelated cleanup.
- In user-facing UI copy and frontend docs, prefer **product language** (e.g. “locations”, “candidates”, “canonicals”) over internal database terms like **“substrate”**.
