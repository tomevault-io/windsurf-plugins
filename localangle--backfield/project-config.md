# Core Workflow

- Use `Makefile` targets when they exist instead of inventing new command flows. For stack operations (`up`, `down`, `logs`, `ps`, `restart`, `reset-db`, `clear-entity-data`) the **`backfield` CLI** is the source of truth and the `make` targets are thin wrappers around it.
- Keep diffs surgical and tied to the request.
- Update the matching source-of-truth doc when behavior, architecture, or operations change.
- Prefer readable, explicit code over cleverness.
- Run relevant validation before finishing:
  - default: `make lint` and `make test`
  - runtime changes: also run `make smoke`
- **Branching (agent default):** within a single agent session, **do not create or check out new branches unless the user explicitly asks**. Stay on the currently-checked-out branch and keep diffs surgical and tied to the request.
- **New sessions:** start a new agent session on a **fresh branch** cut from the task’s base (usually `main`) unless the task explicitly says to continue existing work.
