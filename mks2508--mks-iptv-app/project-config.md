# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MKS-IPTV-App is a native Apple multiplatform IPTV streaming client built with Swift 6 and SwiftUI, targeting iOS 26 Beta, macOS 26 Beta, and tvOS 26 Beta with Liquid Glass design patterns.

## Build Commands

### macOS Development Build
```bash
xcodebuild -project mks-multiplatform-iptv.xcodeproj \
  -scheme mks-multiplatform-iptv \
  -configuration Debug
```

### iOS Archive and Export
```bash
# Create archive
xcodebuild -project mks-multiplatform-iptv.xcodeproj \
  -scheme mks-multiplatform-iptv \
  -configuration Release \
  -archivePath build/ios/mks-iptv.xcarchive archive

# Export IPA
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath build/ios/mks-iptv.xcarchive \
  -exportPath build/export/ios \
  -exportOptionsPlist ExportOptions.plist
```

### tvOS Development Build
```bash
xcodebuild -project mks-multiplatform-iptv.xcodeproj \
  -scheme mks-multiplataforma-tvos-iptv \
  -configuration Debug
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Project Structure
- **IPTVDownloader/**: Main application code organized by feature modules
  - **Core/**: Infrastructure including Configuration, Networking, and Player implementations
  - **Features/**: Feature modules (Downloads, LiveChannels, Movies, Series, TouchBar)
  - **Models/**: Data models (Movie, Series, LiveChannel)
  - **Services/**: API services and networking layer
  - **Utils/**: HTTP servers and streaming utilities
- **mks-multiplataforma-tvos-iptv/**: tvOS-specific target
- **build/**: Build outputs and distribution files
- **docs/**: Documentation and screenshots

### Key Architectural Components

1. **StreamManager**: Handles live stream management and URL resolution with HTTP proxy servers for AVPlayer compatibility
2. **DownloadManager**: Reactive download system with real-time progress tracking and queue management
3. **HTTPStreamServer**: Local HTTP server for streaming downloaded content
4. **PlatformNavigationView**: Adaptive navigation that switches between sidebar (macOS), split view (iPad), and tab bar (iPhone)
5. **TouchBarManager**: Native macOS TouchBar integration for media controls

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: Swift 6.0 with modern concurrency (async/await, Actor model)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI with platform-specific adaptations
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVVM with clear separation of concerns
- **Video Playback**: AVKit with AVPlayer, HTTP proxy for IPTV compatibility
- **Networking**: Native Network framework with custom HTTP proxy implementation

### Platform-Specific Features
- **iOS**: Liquid Glass navigation, adaptive layouts for iPhone/iPad
- **macOS**: TouchBar support, native window management
- **tvOS**: Focus-based navigation optimized for Apple TV

### Content Management
- Four main modules: Movies, Series, Live TV, Downloads
- Gallery views with search and filtering capabilities
- Per-content actions: Stream, Download, External Player, Copy Link
- MOV format conversion for optimal AirPlay and Apple TV integration

## Documentation Site Commands

### Jekyll Development (Legacy)
```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Serve locally with live reload
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Build static site
bundle exec jekyll build

# Clean generated files
bundle exec jekyll clean
```

### Astro Development (New Landing Page)
```bash
# Navigate to Astro project from main repository
cd /Users/mks/Documents/GitHub/MKS-IPTV-App/docs/mks-iptv-landing

# Or relative navigation if already in MKS-IPTV-App directory
cd docs/mks-iptv-landing

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Preview production build
bun run preview

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
bun run deploy
```

## Development Notes

### Current Repository State
**IMPORTANT**: This repository contains ONLY documentation and build artifacts. The actual Swift source code is maintained in a private repository and is not available here. When asked to modify application code, inform users that source code access is not available.

### Implementation Source Location
**Main Repository Path**: `/Users/mks/Documents/GitHub/MKS-IPTV-App`
- This is the primary working directory for the documentation and build artifacts
- The Astro landing page implementation is located at: `/Users/mks/Documents/GitHub/MKS-IPTV-App/docs/mks-iptv-landing`
- All refactor plans and project documentation are consolidated in the Astro landing directory
- Use absolute paths when navigating between different parts of the project
