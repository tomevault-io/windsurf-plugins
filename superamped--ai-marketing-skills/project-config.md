## How to Use

**Claude Code plugin users:** Skills are auto-discovered — just ask Claude to run any skill by name.

**Other tools:** When a user asks to run an audit (or any skill), read the corresponding `SKILL.md` file and follow its instructions exactly. Pass the user's input (e.g. a URL) as the argument.

## Conventions

- Skills live in `skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Each skill defines its own process, output format, and rules
- Do not improvise outside what the skill specifies — follow the SKILL.md

## Integrations

Some skills use MCP servers. See `integrations/` for setup guides.
- **Keywords Everywhere** — keyword data, traffic metrics, backlinks
- **Playwright** — browser automation, screenshots
