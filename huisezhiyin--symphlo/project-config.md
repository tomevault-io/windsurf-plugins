# AGENTS

默认用中文交流；公共 API、协议字段、代码标识符和对外开发者文档使用英文。

## Read First

进入 workspace 后按顺序阅读：

1. `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md`
2. `PROJECT_SPEC.md`
3. `README.md`
4. `PUBLIC_SOURCE_MANIFEST.md`
5. 当前 task 对应的代码和测试

## Owner Model

- 主 Agent 是 owner / decider / implementer / verifier。
- 中等及以上任务先明确 goal、scope、affected contracts、validation、risks 和 non-goals，获得 checkpoint 后再实现。
- 一次只推进一个最小可验收 task；每次收敛都回写受影响的 public contract、tests 和 release evidence。
- 保留用户已有改动；不重置、不清理、不顺手修无关文件。

## Product Boundaries

- Symphlo is the durable Flow and collaboration control plane in the active
  `Symphlo + Clerklet` product portfolio. The historical
  `huisezhiyin/agent-flow` project
  is retired and must not receive new product work.
- Symphlo coordinates multiple independent executors, not only fixed Agent
  chains. Agents, applications, MCP, HTTP, CLI, scripts, compute and Humans may
  collaborate through the same versioned Node and handoff contracts.
- Fixed and repeated orchestration is one strong Flow shape, not the complete
  product definition. Multi-Agent and multi-application collaboration is a
  core product scenario.
- Symphlo is not a general low-code platform and not an Agent UI shell.
- An Agent is a first-class Node executor. It may keep its internal loop, while Symphlo owns observable inputs, effects, executor identity, events, accepted results, Context and Artifacts.
- Symphlo guides Agent work through external task boundaries; it does not modify, expose or claim control over private Agent reasoning.
- Loop ownership slides with explicit Node granularity: broad Agent Nodes preserve more Agent autonomy, while finer semantic boundaries give the Flow more orchestration, evidence and recovery responsibility.
- Do not infer atomic work from a small task. `Agent Node` may contain an opaque loop; `model.task + model_cli` guarantees one adapter request, while `tool.task` guarantees one fixed semantic CLI, MCP or HTTP operation and records `symphlo.tool-call-evidence.v1`.
- Flow controls `what / who / when / dependencies / authority / handoff`; each
  Agent or application controls `how` inside its Node boundary.
- Flow definitions, Run state, Context, Artifacts and history are product truth. Agent sessions and conversations are not.
- The public product must remain agent-agnostic and capability/adapter-driven.
- Clerklet is the separate standalone Agent and an optional reference
  participant. Neither repository may become the other's hidden runtime,
  database or source-path dependency.
- Canvas is optional infrastructure and must not define product identity or become the source of truth.

## Provenance And Public-Source Rules

- This repository starts from an empty Git history. Source from another workspace requires explicit owner authorization, a reviewed file-level provenance boundary and the public ownership gate; never import its Git history.
- Do not copy source, styles, assets or generated bundles from third-party, restricted or unclear-provenance repositories.
- Product semantics may be reimplemented from approved specifications and public protocols.
- Do not add third-party-derived source/assets/design, internal integrations, Pilot material, company identity, internal endpoints, handoffs, local state, traces, Artifacts or user data.
- Do not add `.env`, credentials, keys, cookies or tokens.
- Do not create or claim a final `LICENSE`, public release or M0 completion until ownership, license, name, notices, destination and publication authority have explicit human sign-off.
- Do not change repository visibility, push, publish packages or create releases without explicit user authorization.

## Architecture Rules

- Stable public contracts precede implementation.
- DSL and public contracts are portable truth; visual editor state is not.
- Runtime owns durable state transitions, retries, timeout, cancellation and audit.
- Historical Run comparison is read-only and exact-version only: same Task, semantic
  Flow hash and ordered Nodes. Public comparison may expose equality flags and reason
  codes, never accepted payloads, payload hashes, paths or automatic root-cause claims.
- Companion-facing Run tracking must use the exact, redacted
  `symphlo.run-outcome.v1` read model. Do not make a companion consume full Evidence,
  SQLite or `app-run.json`; the projection may expose bounded status/progress/Artifact
  references, never accepted payloads, event bodies, error text or local paths.
- Companion-triggered cancellation must use exact versioned Run/Flow identity and
  reuse the Runtime-owned cancellation state machine. It must be explicit,
  idempotent and terminal-state preserving; companions must not create their own
  cancellation controller or infer cancellation from polling.
- Companion Run history must be a bounded, exact Flow-scoped redacted projection
  over existing durable Runs. Do not expose broad workspace summaries or create a
  companion history store; opening a history item must return to the exact outcome
  contract and must never imply a new admission.
- Runtime owns effect admission. `write_local | write_external` requires an exact
  pre-admission authorization bound to Flow hash, accepted input hash and pending
  executable Node/effect scope; missing or stale authorization creates zero Run.
