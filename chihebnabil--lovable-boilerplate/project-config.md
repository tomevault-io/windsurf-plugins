# Quality Checklist Rules

## Pre-Ship Quality Gates

### Code Architecture Quality
- [ ] **No monolithic components** - Each component under 300 lines with single responsibility
- [ ] **Logic extraction** - Reusable logic moved to custom hooks, not duplicated
- [ ] **Type safety** - Shared interfaces defined in `lib/types.ts` and reused
- [ ] **Service layer** - API calls abstracted to service functions, not inline
- [ ] **Proper imports** - Using path aliases (@/) and organized import groups
- [ ] **Validation schemas** - Zod schemas shared and reused across components
- [ ] **Component composition** - Complex UI built from smaller, focused components

### Design Quality  
- [ ] Uses intentional color palette that serves the design purpose
- [ ] Has proper visual hierarchy with varied typography scales
- [ ] Includes subtle animations and micro-interactions
- [ ] Features generous whitespace and purposeful spacing
- [ ] All interactive elements have clear hover/active states
- [ ] **Accessibility standards are met (proper contrast, focus states)**
- [ ] Mobile experience is thoughtfully designed
- [ ] Maintains cohesive visual story throughout
- [ ] Design feels custom-crafted, not template-like
- [ ] Visual identity matches target industry and audience
- [ ] Color choices enhance user experience and brand message

### Essential Commands Check
```bash
npm run lint         # MUST pass before shipping
npm run build        # MUST succeed without errors
```

### NEVER Ship Code That:
- Contains components over 300 lines mixing multiple concerns
- Has duplicated logic that could be extracted to hooks
- Uses inline API calls instead of service layer
- Lacks proper TypeScript interfaces
- Has accessibility contrast violations  
- Contains copy-pasted code blocks
- Mixes business logic with presentation layer
- Has console errors or warnings
- Fails ESLint checks

### Development Workflow
1. Run `npm run dev` to start development
2. Follow component size limits (300 lines max)
3. Extract reusable logic to hooks
4. Test responsive design on mobile/desktop
5. Verify accessibility contrast ratios
6. Run `npm run lint` and fix all issues
7. Ensure no console errors before shipping

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Component Anti-Patterns
```tsx
// DON'T: Monolithic component
const BadDashboard = () => {
  // 400+ lines of mixed concerns
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([])
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([])
  // ... massive component
}

// DO: Composition pattern
const GoodDashboard = () => (
  <PageLayout>
    <DashboardHeader />
    <DashboardMetrics />
    <DashboardCharts />
  </PageLayout>
)
```

### Data Fetching Anti-Patterns
```tsx
// DON'T: Inline API calls
const BadComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/users').then(res => res.json()).then(setUsers)
  }, [])
}

// DO: Service layer + custom hooks
const GoodComponent = () => {
  const { data: users } = useUsers()
}
```
