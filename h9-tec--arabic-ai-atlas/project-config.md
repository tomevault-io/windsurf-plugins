# Project Rules

- data/ is source of truth
- run `uv run python scripts/build.py build` after editing data (`all` also refetches HF metrics; leave that to the nightly job)
- never hand-edit README.md, docs/tables/ (incl. wanted.md), assets/ (incl. tree.svg), dist/, data/.cache/ (incl. wanted.json)
