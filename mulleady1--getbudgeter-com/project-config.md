# Budgeter

This is a web app for users to manage their monthly bills and track if they've been paid.

## Tech Stack

- Django
- HTMX
- Web Awesome (formerly Shoelace)

## Code style

The frontend uses as little client-side JavaScript as possible. Default to HTMX for any user
interaction that involves data. Create new endpoints liberally rather than trying to make JS do
the work.

When adding client-side JavaScript for non-HTTP interactions (e.g., DOM manipulation, event handling,
UI effects), first consider using [surrealjs](https://github.com/gnat/surreal) if appropriate.

When writing python code, prefer top-level imports as opposed to imports inside function bodies.

## HTMX Patterns

### Opening drawers/dialogs
Always append to `<body>` so Web Awesome can teleport the overlay correctly:
```html
<wa-button hx-get="/things/new" hx-target="body" hx-swap="beforeend">Add</wa-button>
```

### Fragment targets
Define named fragments with `{% partialdef %}` and target them by ID:
```html
{% partialdef thing-list inline %}
  <div id="thing-list">...</div>
{% endpartialdef thing-list %}
```
The view returns the fragment via `render(request, "things/page.html#thing-list", context)`.

### Returning updated state after mutations (POST/PUT/DELETE)
After a mutation, re-render the relevant list fragment and set `HX-Trigger` so sidebars/stats
reload without a full page refresh:
```python
response = render(request, "things/page.html#thing-list", context)
response["HX-Trigger"] = "things-changed"
return response
```

### Listening for cross-component events
Sidebar panels load on page load and re-load when data changes:
```html
<div hx-get="/things/stats" hx-trigger="load, things-changed from:body"></div>
```

### Month-scoped pages
Pages that show monthly data use a `wa-input type="month"` with HTMX. The input fires a GET
that pushes the new URL, so the month is bookmarkable:
```html
<wa-input
  type="month"
  id="month"
  value="{{ selected_month|date:'Y-m' }}"
  hx-get="/things"
  hx-push-url="true"
  hx-target="#things-list"
  hx-trigger="change delay:500ms"
  hx-swap="outerHTML"
></wa-input>
```
The view reads the month from `request.GET.get("month")`, defaulting to the current month.
Month navigation buttons call a small JS helper (`changeMonth(+/-1)`) that updates the input value
and fires `change`; this is the only JS needed.

### Passing context to HTMX GET requests
When a button needs to carry a value (e.g., current month) into a GET endpoint, use a query param:
```html
<wa-button hx-get="/things/new?month={{ selected_month|date:'Y-m' }}" hx-target="body" hx-swap="beforeend">
```

### Delete with confirmation
Use `customConfirm()` (defined in `static/js/app.js`) instead of the native `hx-confirm`:
```html
<wa-button
  hx-delete="/things/{{ thing.id }}"
  hx-trigger="confirmed"
  hx-target="#thing-list"
  hx-swap="outerHTML"
  onclick="customConfirm().then(yes => { if (yes) htmx.trigger(this, 'confirmed') })"
>
```

### Forms inside drawers
- Put the form *inside* `<wa-drawer>` with a stable `id`
- Put Cancel/Save in `slot="footer"` with a 2-column grid layout
- Cancel: `onclick="this.closest('wa-drawer').open = false"`
- Save: `type="submit" form="<form-id>"`
- `app.js` already handles auto-closing the drawer on successful HTMX response

```html
<wa-drawer label="Add Thing">
  <form id="thing-form" hx-post="/things" hx-target="#thing-list" hx-swap="outerHTML"
        style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem;">
    {% csrf_token %}
    ...
  </form>
  <div slot="footer" style="width: 100%; display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 1rem;">
    <wa-button appearance="outlined" onclick="this.closest('wa-drawer').open = false"
               style="margin-top: 1rem; width: 100%;">Cancel</wa-button>
    <wa-button type="submit" form="thing-form" style="margin-top: 1rem; width: 100%;">Save</wa-button>
  </div>
</wa-drawer>
```

## Web Awesome Components

Use `wa-*` components consistently. Key components and their usage:

| Component | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| `wa-button` | All buttons. Use `appearance="plain"` for icon-only, `appearance="outlined"` for secondary, `variant="danger"` for destructive |
| `wa-icon` | Icons via Font Awesome name. Use `slot="start"` inside buttons for leading icon |
| `wa-input` | Text, number, url, month inputs. Always use `label=` instead of external `<label>` |
| `wa-select` / `wa-option` | Dropdowns in forms. Use `value=` on `wa-select` to set the selected option |
| `wa-checkbox` | Boolean toggles in forms |
| `wa-drawer` | Side-panel forms (add/edit). Preferred over `wa-dialog` for forms |
| `wa-dialog` | Modal dialogs for confirmations or short non-form interactions |
| `wa-dropdown` / `wa-dropdown-item` | Action menus (e.g., page-level ⋮ menu) |
| `wa-badge` | Status chips |

---

## Surrealjs

Use surrealjs for any client-side DOM work that doesn't need a server round-trip.

### Key rules
- `me()` without args = parent element of the `<script>` tag. Works reliably for non-web-component
  parents. Use `me('#id')` (explicit selector) when the script might run after an HTMX swap.
- `any(selector)` = all matching elements, chainable.
