description: Store module-specific constants in colocated constants.js files

# Constants Conventions

- When a module accumulates non-trivial constants, move them into a colocated `constants.js` file instead of leaving them inline.
- Prefer importing constants from `./constants.js` or the nearest related `constants.js` for that module area.
- Keep behavior and helper functions in the main module; keep static config, IDs, labels, asset definitions, and similar constant data in `constants.js`.
- When adding new constants to an area that already has a related `constants.js`, extend that file instead of redefining the values locally.
