description: Preserve strong types and distinguish real type checks from weaker signals

# Agent Types And Safety

- Prefer existing types, validated data shapes, and shared helpers over ad hoc inline types or duplicated type logic.
- Avoid introducing `any`, wide casts, or weaker return types unless the local codebase pattern truly requires it.
- When you touch typed code, use the closest real typecheck or TypeScript build command for that package when one exists.
- Do not claim full TypeScript verification from a green lint pass or successful bundle alone.
- In areas with weak or partial typing coverage, call out the remaining risk instead of overstating confidence.
