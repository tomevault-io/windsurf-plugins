- This application uses Cordis <https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis> a Meta-Framework of Spatiotemporal Composability based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.25512 - and Olai must be developed in prefect adherence to its principles. 
  - Preserve Cordis adherence in every change, including refactors. Share live values across package boundaries through declared services; tie resources and work to explicit owners and lifetimes. Static contracts may remain imports. Preserve cleanup, withdrawal order, atomic ownership claims, optional availability and reconnection. Never hide dependencies or weaken lifecycle guarantees for simpler code; explain changed ownership boundaries.
- [Claude only] If your model is Fabel, when spawning sub-agents - use Fable only where truly necessary, and use Opus by default.
- Keep docs/*.md up to date in the same PR as the code. website/ is the pitch for people, not a spec dump — touch it only if the reason to try olai changed, or a picture of something a person sees is now wrong. 
- Require full e2e coverage of user workflows and edge cases across the app; audit for missing coverage, fix discovered bugs, and do not treat a green existing suite as proof of completeness.
- Prefer frequent-commits 
   - Run individual checks remotely with `just typecheck-fast-remote`, `just test-fast-remote`, or `just e2e-fast-remote` against your working tree as it stands (uncommitted edits and new files included, ignored files excluded); `just ci` still needs a clean, pushed checkout. These use up to six available Odu slots and appear together in the `fast-remote` help group.
   - The fast targets and `just ci` use the current flake's pinned Odu via `nix run .#odu`. Fast targets default to a 10-minute watch timeout; override with `ODU_TYPECHECK_REMOTE_TIMEOUT`, `ODU_TEST_REMOTE_TIMEOUT`, or `ODU_E2E_REMOTE_TIMEOUT`.
   - Odu runs belong to its shared service: Ctrl-C or a watch timeout leaves the run active. Use `nix run .#odu -- wait --run <id>` to follow it or `nix run .#odu -- cancel --run <id>` to cancel it.
