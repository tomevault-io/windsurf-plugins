- `skills/ringing-integration/SKILL.md` — Dual SDK (Chat + Calls), initiateCall, accept/reject/cancel
- `skills/session-settings/SKILL.md` — All SessionSettingsBuilder options: layouts, session type, audio mode, hide buttons
- `skills/event-listeners/SKILL.md` — SessionStatus, Participant, Media, ButtonClick, Layout listeners
