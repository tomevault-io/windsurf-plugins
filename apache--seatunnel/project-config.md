# LLM Context Guide for Apache SeaTunnel

This guide helps AI assistants (LLMs / Agents) make **safe, consistent, and verifiable** changes to the Apache SeaTunnel codebase. It mirrors practices from mature Apache projects and adapts them to SeaTunnel’s **build, testing, architecture, and documentation conventions**.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Validate Before Proposing Changes

**Agents MUST run verification commands locally before suggesting or finalizing changes.**

```bash
# Format code (mandatory)
./mvnw spotless:apply

# Quick verification (mandatory)
./mvnw -q -DskipTests verify

# Unit tests (strongly recommended)
./mvnw test
```

Failure to meet these requirements will likely result in PR rejection.

## Git Commit Message Convention

SeaTunnel follows a **strict commit message format** to maintain a clean and searchable history.

**Format**:

```
[Type][Module] Description
```

### Types

* `Feature`  – New features
* `Fix`      – Bug fixes
* `Improve`  – Improvements to existing behavior
* `Docs`     – Documentation-only changes
* `Test`     – Test cases or test framework changes
* `Chore`    – Build, dependency, or maintenance tasks

### Modules

* `Connector-V2`  – seatunnel-connectors-v2
* `Zeta`          – seatunnel-engine (Zeta engine)
* `Core`          – seatunnel-core
* `API`           – seatunnel-api
* `Transform-V2`  – seatunnel-transforms-v2
* `Format`        – seatunnel-formats
* `Translation`   – seatunnel-translation
* `E2E`           – seatunnel-e2e

### Examples

* `[Fix][Connector-V2] Fix MySQL source split enumeration bug`
* `[Fix][Zeta] Fix checkpoint timeout under heavy backpressure`
* `[Feature][Transform-V2] Add LLM transform plugin`
* `[Improve][Core] Optimize jar package loading speed`
* `[Docs] Update quick start guide`

```

## Code Standards

### Java Backend

* **Formatting**: Google Java Format (AOSP style), enforced by Spotless
* **Imports**:
    * No wildcard imports
    * Use shaded dependencies: `org.apache.seatunnel.shade.*`
* **Nullability**: Avoid implicit null assumptions
* **Visibility**: Keep APIs minimal; prefer package-private when possible
* **Comments**: Add comments for important methods (public APIs, complex logic). Important methods include public APIs, lifecycle hooks (initialization, start/stop, checkpoint), and complex or performance-critical logic. Example:

```java
/**
 * Enumerates source splits for parallel reading.
 * Called once during job initialization.
 *
 * @param context Split enumeration context
 * @return Collection of discovered splits
 */
@Override
public List<SourceSplit> enumerateSplits(SplitEnumerationContext context) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Apache License Header (MANDATORY)

All **new files** MUST include the ASF license header:

```java
/*
 * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more
 * contributor license agreements.  See the NOTICE file distributed with
 * this work for additional information regarding copyright ownership.
 * The ASF licenses this file to You under the Apache License, Version 2.0

 * distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
 * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
 * limitations under the License.
 */
```

## 🚨 Backward Compatibility (VERY IMPORTANT)

Agents MUST treat backward compatibility as a **hard constraint**.

* DO NOT remove or rename existing config options
* DO NOT change default values casually
* DO NOT break public APIs or SPI contracts

Any incompatible change MUST:

* Be explicitly documented
* Be documented in `docs/en/introduction/concepts/incompatible-changes.md`
* Include migration guidance
* Be clearly explained in the PR description

## Dependency Rules

* DO NOT introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary
* Prefer existing shaded dependencies under `org.apache.seatunnel.shade.*`
* Any new dependency MUST:
    * Be justified in the PR description
    * Consider shading, size, and conflict risks

## Architecture Guidelines

### Connector (V2)

* Implement `SeaTunnelSource` or `SeaTunnelSink`
