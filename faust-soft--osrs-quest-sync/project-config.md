# RuneLite Plugin Development — Agent Guidelines

## Logging

- Use `log.debug()` for developer/diagnostic logging.
- Do not use `log.info` for per-frame or per-event logging - RuneLite runs at INFO level in production, so high-frequency info logs will pollute user logs. `log.info()` is fine for one-time startup/shutdown messages or infrequent events.

## Threading & Concurrency

- Never use `Thread.sleep()`.
- Never block on `shutDown()` or `startUp()` — don't call `executor.awaitTermination()` in shutdown, just use `shutdownNow()`.
- Never do blocking network IO or disk IO on the client thread. The OkHttp thread pool can be used for blocking network requests.
  If you need to call back into `client` from the okhttp threadpool, such as from the response queued with `enqueue()`, use `clientThread.invoke()`
- Explicitly cancel scheduled tasks (e.g. `ScheduledFuture`) on shutdown, in addition to shutting down the executor.
- For batching async work, use `CompletableFuture.allOf()` — not `CountDownLatch`.
- If you must use `Process.waitFor()`, always pass a reasonable timeout.

## Performance

- Don't scan the entire scene every tick or frame. Use events such as object and npc (de)spawn to track what you care about and maintain your own collection.
- Keep the computations in Overlays, which are run each frame, to a minimum.

## API Usage

- Use `net.runelite.api.gameval` package constants — `ItemID`, `InterfaceID`, `ObjectID`, etc. Never hardcode magic numbers when gameval constants can be used instead.
- Use `LinkBrowser` to open URLs, not `java.awt.Desktop`
- When looking up Widgets, pass the component ID from gamevals (eg `client.getWidget(InterfaceID.DomEndLevelUi.LOOT_VALUE)`) - do not manually combine interface + component child IDs.
- Use of Java reflection is forbidden.

## HTTP & JSON

- Use OkHttp for all HTTP requests. `@Inject OkHttpClient` to get the HTTP client. Do not use `HttpURLConnection`, `java.net.http.HttpClient`, or Apache HttpClient.
- Use `@Inject Gson` to get a Gson instead, never create your own from scratch. You can use `.newBuilder()` to create one derived from the base `Gson.`
- Do not add transitive dependencies from `runelite-client` directly to `build.gradle`, such as gson, guice, or okhttp.
- Never execute okhttp calls on the client thread. Prefer using `enqueue()` which places the request on the okhttp threadpool.

## File I/O

- Only read/write files inside the `.runelite` directory. Create a subdirectory for your plugin (e.g. `.runelite/your-plugin-name/`) if you need to store data on disk.
- Use `RuneLite.RUNELITE_DIR` to get the path.
- Alternatively, use `JFileChooser` for user-initiated file operations.

## Config

- Config group names must be specific — e.g. `"deadman-prices"`, not `"deadman"`.
- Never rename a config key or config group without providing a migration. Renaming silently resets users' saved settings.
- If you add a `@ConfigItem` that toggles a feature involving a third-party server, it must:
  - Be **disabled by default** (opt-in)
  - Have a `warning` field set to: `"This feature submits your IP address to a 3rd-party server not controlled or verified by RuneLite developers"`

## Plugin Setup & Packaging

- Rename everything from the template. Do not leave `com.example`, `ExamplePlugin`, `ExampleConfig`, or `example` as the config group. Rename the package path, class names, config group, `build.gradle` group, `settings.gradle` project name, and `runelite-plugin.properties`.
- Do not include a `META-INF/services/net.runelite.client.plugins.Plugin` file.
- Do not commit build artifacts — no `.class` files, `out/` directories, or `.tmp` directories.
- `build.gradle` must target Java 11** and match the structure of the example-plugin template.
- Retain a permissive license, such as BSD-2.

## Resources & Assets

- Optimize icon PNGs. Java loads images at full resolution in memory (`width × height × 4` bytes), so a seemingly small file can use significant memory.
- Ensure PNGs are actually PNGs — do not rename JPEGs or ICOs to `.png`.

## Cleanup

- Remove unused config classes, fields, and imports.
- Clean up subscriptions, listeners, and overlays in `shutDown()`.
- Do not mix code reformatting with feature changes in the same commit — it makes diffs unreadable for reviewers.

## Testing

You cannot verify plugin behavior yourself. Even if you have screen-capture or computer-use tools available, **do not use them to interact with RuneScape** — automating game input violates Jagex's third-party client guidelines and will get the user's account banned. Only the user can confirm a plugin works in-game.

After completing a task, do not declare it done. Instead:

1. Offer to launch RuneLite for the user by running `./gradlew run` from the plugin's root directory.
2. Instruct the user to follow the "Using Jagex Accounts" instructions found at https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Using-Jagex-Accounts to login to the development client.
3. Tell the user *what to test* — the specific behavior you changed, the golden path, and any edge cases worth exercising.
4. Wait for the user to confirm the feature works in-game before considering the task complete. A clean JVM start is not a passing test.
