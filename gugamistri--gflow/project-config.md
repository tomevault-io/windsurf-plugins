# Harness lessons

Auto-synced from gate failures; do not hand-edit.

Learned harness lessons (auto-synced; do not hand-edit):
- [stagnation/active/core] Identical validation fingerprint repeated. Change approach — do not re-apply the same failing edit.
  avoid: Do not retry the exact same patch, command, or suppression.
  prefer: Diagnose root cause with a different path, or escalate with BLOCKED / TRIED / NEED.
  before retrying: Diff your last edit against the gate output; ensure the next action is different.
_(5 more active lessons omitted under char budget)_
