# Screeny — Claude Code Context

## Project
Minimal macOS menu bar screenshot app with annotation tools. Built with SwiftUI + AppKit.

## Structure
```
Screeny.xcodeproj/        — Xcode project (deployment target: macOS 14.0)
Screeny/
  ScreenyApp.swift         — @main entry point
  AppDelegate.swift        — Menu bar icon, global hotkey (Ctrl+Shift+4) via Carbon
  ScreenCaptureManager.swift — Capture flow using ScreenCaptureKit (SCScreenshotManager)
  SelectionOverlayWindow.swift — Full-screen transparent NSWindow for area selection
  EditorWindow.swift       — NSWindow with AnnotationCanvas + SwiftUI ToolbarView
  AnnotationCanvas.swift   — NSView handling drawing, mouse events, text input
  EditorViewModel.swift    — ObservableObject shared between canvas and toolbar
  Annotation.swift         — Annotation enum (rectangle, arrow, text, fill, pixelate)
  Info.plist               — LSUIElement=true, NSScreenCaptureUsageDescription
  Screeny.entitlements     — app-sandbox=false
```

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **AppKit + SwiftUI hybrid**: NSWindow/NSView for the editor canvas (mouse events, drawing), NSHostingView<ToolbarView> for the SwiftUI toolbar
- **No App Sandbox**: Simplifies screen recording permission; set in Screeny.entitlements
- **ScreenCaptureKit**: Uses SCScreenshotManager (macOS 14+) for capture — sees all windows. CGWindowListCreateImage was abandoned because it only captures wallpaper on macOS 14+ without proper permission recognition
- **Carbon hotkeys**: RegisterEventHotKey for global Ctrl+Shift+4 (avoids conflicts with system Cmd+Shift+4)
- **Coordinate systems**: SelectionOverlayWindow converts NSView bottom-left coords to CG top-left coords before passing to SCScreenshotManager.sourceRect
- **TCC Permission issue**: Screen recording permission is tied to binary code signature. App must be code-signed (Xcode → Signing & Capabilities → Team) and run from /Applications for permission to persist across builds. Build phase auto-copies to /Applications after each build.

## Tools
| Tool | Annotation Type | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Rectangle | `.rectangle(rect, color, lineWidth)` | Stroke only |
| Arrow | `.arrow(start, end, color, lineWidth)` | Line + arrowhead via NSBezierPath |
| Text | `.text(string, position, color, fontSize)` | NSTextField overlay → commits on Enter/blur |
| Fill | `.fill(rect, color)` | Solid color fill for censoring |
| Pixelate | `.pixelate(rect)` | CIPixellate filter on screenshot crop |

## Export
- **Cmd+C**: `AnnotationCanvas.flattenToImage()` → NSPasteboard (TIFF)
- **Cmd+S**: NSSavePanel → PNG or JPEG

## Known Issues / Gotchas
- Text field focus: EditorWindow.makeFirstResponder must pass through both NSTextField AND NSText (field editor), otherwise the text tool is unresponsive
- SCScreenshotManager requires macOS 14.0+
- Permission won't persist without proper code signing — run `tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.screeny.app` after signing setup
- Build phase "Copy to Applications" copies .app to /Applications after every build for stable permission binding
