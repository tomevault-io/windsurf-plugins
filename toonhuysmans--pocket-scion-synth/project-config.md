# Repository guidance for coding agents

## Mission

Maintain and extend the clean-room Pocket SCION real-time synthesis firmware.
Preserve musical behavior, real-time audio reliability, recoverability, and the
project's separation from Instruō's proprietary firmware and sample content.

This file applies to the entire repository. A future, more specific
`AGENTS.md` in a subdirectory may add or override guidance for that subtree.

## Start here

Read the smallest relevant set before changing code:

- `README.md` for product scope, installation, and recovery.
- `docs/platform.md` for confirmed peripherals and GPIO assignments.
- `docs/architecture.md` for real-time data flow and voice allocation.
- `docs/banks-and-parameters.md` for patches and sensor routing.
- `docs/controls.md` for gestures, LEDs, and MIDI behavior.
- `docs/reverse-engineering.md` for provenance and confidence levels.
- `docs/hardware-testing.md` for physical-device validation.

Treat the source, especially `src/synth.cpp` and `src/board_pins.h`, as
authoritative when prose and implementation disagree. Correct stale prose in
the same change.

## Build and test

The supported SDK is Raspberry Pi Pico SDK 2.2.0. Prefer an out-of-tree build
and do not commit generated files.

```sh
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/absolute/path/to/pico-sdk
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

Run the host sensor test for every change that touches sensor acquisition,
statistics, or sequencing inputs:

```sh
cc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror \
  -Isrc src/sensor_math.c tests/test_sensor_math.c \
  -lm -o /tmp/test_sensor_math
/tmp/test_sensor_math
```

Before handing off a firmware change:

1. Run `git diff --check`.
2. Run relevant host tests.
3. Build `pocket_scion_synth.uf2` with Pico SDK 2.2.0.
4. Inspect metadata with `picotool info -a build/pocket_scion_synth.uf2` when
   `picotool` is available.
5. State clearly whether the change was hardware-tested.

Do not copy a UF2 to a mounted device or otherwise flash hardware unless the
user explicitly requests it. A successful compile is not a substitute for the
physical checks in `docs/hardware-testing.md`.

## Hardware and real-time invariants

- Target: RP2040 at 153.6 MHz, 48 kHz signed 16-bit stereo output.
- Audio: PIO0 and chained DMA, I2S data/BCLK/LRCLK on GPIO12/13/14.
- Sensor: GPIO0 both-edge pulse input; ten accepted intervals per window.
- RGB: nine WS2812-compatible pixels on GPIO1 through PIO1.
- MIDI: UART0 TX on GPIO16 at 31,250 baud plus USB MIDI.
- Buttons are active-low on GPIO17–21 with the assignments in
  `src/board_pins.h`.
- GPIO27 and GPIO29 have unresolved auxiliary roles; initialize them safely
  and do not assign behavior without new evidence and hardware validation.

Audio buffers have first priority. Keep blocking I/O, allocation, logging,
USB service, sensor analysis, and UI work out of the per-sample render path.
Preserve the dual-core PRA32-U arrangement and SRAM placement of hot DSP code
and lookup tables unless timing is measured again on hardware.

There are four synth voices. Do not reintroduce unconditional voice stealing
or repeated envelope restarts: repeated pitches tie and extend, and excess
new triggers are dropped. This behavior prevents low-volume attack churn and
audible clicking.

Changes to clocks, DMA buffer size, PIO timing, gain, effects, raw capture,
polyphony, or cross-core memory placement are high-risk and require the full
hardware checklist.

## Behavioral expectations

- Preserve all eight banks and sixteen scene positions unless a change is
  intentionally versioned and documented.
- Pitch bend remains a separate toggle layer, not an additional bank.
- DIN and USB MIDI should describe the same musical events.
- Single-channel MIDI uses channel 1; multichannel maps the three lanes to
  channels 1–3.
- White LED flashes are reserved for actual ratchet firings in normal mode.
- Raw mode must silence synth voices and MIDI notes before presenting the
  captured pulse train.
- Program and mode transitions must avoid stuck notes.

When altering controls, test single, double, triple, held, shifted, and paired
button gestures for conflicts. When altering patches, compare quiet and high
sensor pressure, all four active voices, ratchets, and effect-heavy scenes.

## Clean-room and licensing boundary

Never commit or redistribute:

- Instruō factory firmware images or decoded binaries;
- extracted factory samples or other factory content;
- the Instruō manual or copied proprietary source/material;
- local disassembly databases, dumps, or analysis artifacts.

It is acceptable to link to Instruō's official factory-firmware download.
Document behavioral observations and independently implemented interfaces,
not copied implementation. Keep third-party code under `vendor/` pinned and
