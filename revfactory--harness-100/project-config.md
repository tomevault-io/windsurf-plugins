A harness where an agent team collaborates to perform multilingual translation, localization, cultural adaptation, and terminology management.

## Structure

```
.claude/
├── agents/
│   ├── translator.md            — Translator (source analysis, initial translation, nuance preservation)
│   ├── localizer.md             — Localizer (cultural adaptation, idioms, units of measurement, date formats)
│   ├── terminology-manager.md   — Terminology Manager (glossary building, consistency, industry standards)
│   ├── quality-reviewer.md      — Quality Reviewer (accuracy, fluency, localization suitability verification)
│   └── style-harmonizer.md      — Style Harmonizer (tone & voice consistency, brand voice application)
├── skills/
│   ├── translation-localization/
│   │   └── skill.md             — Orchestrator (team coordination, workflow, error handling)
│   ├── translation-quality-mqm/
│   │   └── skill.md             — quality-reviewer extension (MQM error classification, severity, scoring)
│   └── cultural-adaptation-guide/
│       └── skill.md             — localizer extension (market-specific format conversion, cultural taboos, idiom substitution)
└── CLAUDE.md                    — This file
