# Omaclip — Project Instructions

## Overview

A Wails desktop clipboard manager that tracks clipboard history and syncs across multiple computers on the local network.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Wails v2)
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia
- **CSS**: TailwindCSS only — no other CSS frameworks, no custom CSS classes outside of Tailwind utilities
- **Peer Discovery**: mDNS via `grandcat/zeroconf` (`_omaclip._tcp` service type)
- **Sync Transport**: HTTPS with TLS — a CA cert is derived from the passphrase and used to sign a leaf cert; peers validate against this CA (no `InsecureSkipVerify`)

## Features

1. **Clipboard history** — continuously poll/monitor the system clipboard and store a history of copied items (text and PNG images)
2. **History UI** — browse and re-copy from clipboard history
3. **Multi-machine sync** — peers discover each other via mDNS and pull each other's clipboard over HTTPS
4. **Omarchy theming** — automatically reads the active Omarchy color theme and applies it to the UI; colors update live when the theme changes
5. **Remote clipboard disable** — `--remote-clipboards-disable` flag skips networking entirely for single-machine use

## Clipboard History

- In-memory only (no persistence across restarts)
- Default max: 50 items, configurable via `OMACLIP_CLIPBOARD_MAX_HISTORY`
- Items can be pinned to the top of the list (local tab only, in-memory only); default max: 3 pins, configurable via `OMACLIP_CLIPBOARD_MAX_PINNED`. Exceeding the cap auto-unpins the oldest pin (FIFO).
- Supports text and images (max 25 MB per image); content type is either `"text"` or `"image"`
- Images are normalised to PNG at ingestion (`image.Decode` + `png.Encode`) regardless of original format; stored as base64-encoded PNG in `ClipboardEntry.ImageData`; `ClipboardEntry.ImageMimeType` carries the MIME type (`"image/png"` after normalisation)
- SHA-256 used for duplicate detection
- Wayland-aware: uses `wl-paste`/`wl-copy` if available; falls back through xclip → xsel → macOS (`osascript`+`pbpaste` both required)

## Multi-Machine Sync (mDNS + HTTPS)

- Each instance starts an HTTPS server on a random OS-assigned port
- TLS: a CA cert is derived from the passphrase key bytes and used to sign a leaf cert; peers validate against this CA — no `InsecureSkipVerify`
- mDNS advertises the port with TXT records: `version=1` and `ph=<first 16 hex chars of Argon2id passphrase hash>`
- Peers filter by `ph=` — only instances sharing the same passphrase connect
- Peer fetcher polls all discovered peers: `GET /api/clipboard` with `X-Omaclip-Pass` header; handler validates with `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` (timing-attack resistant)
- Images are fetched separately: metadata-only on `GET /api/clipboard`, then `GET /api/clipboard/{id}/image` for PNG bytes
- Peers expire after ~3 missed browse cycles (~6s)

## Passphrase

- Minimum 8 chars, maximum 128 chars, no leading/trailing whitespace
- Stored in `$HOME/.config/omaclip/config.json` (mode 0600) as `{ "passphrase": "..." }`
- Loaded at startup; if invalid, the app logs an error and exits immediately
- On first launch (no config), the UI shows a passphrase setup screen before enabling networking
- If `DisableRemoteClipboards` is true, passphrase is never required
- The passphrase is the single security boundary: it derives the TLS CA cert, is hashed (Argon2id) into mDNS TXT records for peer filtering, and is validated on every HTTP request

## Omarchy Theming

- Reads `$HOME/.config/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml`; gracefully skips if missing
- Watches file for changes (fsnotify, 200ms debounce) and emits `theme:loaded` Wails event
- All UI colors come from Omarchy theme tokens via CSS custom properties (`--color-*`); no hardcoded colors

## App Behavior

- Normal window (no system tray)
- No global hotkey yet
- Wails events: `clipboard:new`, `remote:updated`, `theme:loaded`

## Architecture Notes

- `app/app.go` — main Wails struct; exposes Go methods to the frontend via `Bind`
- `app/routes.go` — registers HTTP routes on the sync server
- `app/handlers/` — HTTP handlers (clipboard endpoint)
- `business/clipboard/` — clipboard monitor, history, reader/writer interfaces
- `business/passphrase/` — thread-safe passphrase store + validation
- `business/sync/` — HTTPS server wrapper
- `business/peersclipsync/` — periodic fetcher of remote peer clipboards
- `business/theme/` — Omarchy theme loader and file watcher
- `foundation/clipboard/` — platform clipboard backends (Wayland + Wails runtime)
- `foundation/config/` — JSON config file read/write
- `foundation/mdns/` — mDNS registration and peer discovery
- `foundation/tlscert/` — self-signed TLS certificate generation
- Frontend Vue stores (Pinia): `clipboard.js`, `remote.js`, `theme.js`, shared `navigation.js` composable

## CLI Flags

All configurable via environment variables (`OMACLIP_<FLAG>`) or command-line args:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `OMACLIP_DEBUG` | `false` | Enable debug-level logging |
| `OMACLIP_CLIPBOARD_MAX_HISTORY` | `50` | Max local clipboard entries |
| `OMACLIP_CLIPBOARD_MAX_PINNED` | `3` | Max number of clipboard items that can be pinned at the top of the list |
