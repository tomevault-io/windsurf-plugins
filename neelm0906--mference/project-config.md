# Mference

Swift and Metal inference for Gemma 4 26B-A4B on Apple Silicon.

## Scope

This checkout is for running and reporting existing behavior. Do not edit source, change runtime defaults, or start optimization work unless the user asks.

## Layout and commands

`Sources/Mference/` is the runtime; `Sources/MferenceRepack/`,
`Sources/MferenceCLI/`, `Sources/MferenceServer/`, and
`Sources/MferenceApp/` contain the installer, CLI, loopback server, and
Mac app.
`Tests/` contains focused public tests; `docs/` contains design, benchmark, and experiment notes.

```bash
swift run -c release MferenceRepack --output scratch/gemma4.gturbo
swift run -c release MferenceRepack --output scratch/gemma4.gturbo --resume
swift build -c release
.build/release/MferenceMac
swift run -c release MferenceCLI \
  --model scratch/gemma4.gturbo \
  --prompt "The capital of France is" \
  --max-new 64
```

The installer streams the pinned model without staging the full source checkpoint. Set `HF_TOKEN` only if requested. The download is about 15 GB. Cancellation preserves verified completed ranges; continue them with `--resume` or remove them with `--discard-partial --output scratch/gemma4.gturbo`.

## Local server

Follow the [server guide](docs/OPENAI_SERVER.md) for launch commands, health
checks, client setup, prompt reuse, tool loops, and supported API behavior.
Apply the model-process checks below first; never start a second model process
or terminate an existing one.

Keep the server on its default `127.0.0.1` binding unless the user explicitly
asks for `--bind tailnet` and intends the Tailnet ACL to be the access
boundary. It has no application-level authentication or TLS, so never bind it
to a wildcard interface or expose it through a proxy or tunnel. A tool call
from the local model never bypasses the client's normal permission policy. Keep
the execution session alive while the server is needed, and stop only a server
you launched.

## Test rules

Before a model run, require macOS 15+, Swift 6.1+, enough disk, acceptable `memory_pressure -Q`, a completed `scratch/gemma4.gturbo`, and no process from `pgrep -fl 'MferenceServer|MferenceMac|MferenceDecodeService|MferenceCLI|MferencePackageTests|swiftpm-testing-helper|mlx_lm|mlx-lm'`. If a check fails, inform the user and stop; do not terminate apps or delete or reinstall the model.

Run package tests through `Scripts/test.sh`. Run only one app, CLI, or model-using test at a time.

For performance results, build release once and follow the [community benchmark guide](docs/COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md) exactly. Do not enable experimental controls or profiling.

Do not download a full checkpoint, duplicate the `.gturbo` model, create a worktree, or purge caches just to run tests.

Report the commit, hardware and RAM, macOS, Swift version, exact command, exit code, complete timing footer or error, and every protocol deviation. Treat results as measurements, not performance ceilings.

## App controls

The Mac app sends prompts through the pinned Gemma 4 IT chat format. It
exposes context length, temperature, Top-K, Top-P, expert-cache slots, prefill,
and RDADVISE. The defaults are temperature `0.2`, Top-K `64`, and Top-P `0.95`.
Responses can use the context space left after formatting the prompt, and FP16
is the runtime KV format. The HUD shows generation rate, token count, and
decode-service memory; Last run also shows time to first token and I/O. Build
the app with its sibling `MferenceDecodeService`; it never loads a second
in-process model. See [README](README.md) and [Runtime controls](docs/RUNTIME_CONTROLS.md).
