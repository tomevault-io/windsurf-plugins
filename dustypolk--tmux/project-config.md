# tmux Configuration Setup

## Symlink Setup

To make tmux use the config file from this git repo location, create a symlink:

```bash
ln -s ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
```

Then reload tmux configuration:

```bash
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

This keeps the config in the git repo while making it accessible to tmux at the standard location.
