# Matter Tracker (Clio Edition) — Claude Code Context

This project is a legal matter tracking system backed by an Excel spreadsheet (`matter-tracker.xlsx`). It tracks open and closed client matters, limitation periods, court deadlines, conflict checks, and chronological timelines — all from a single `.xlsx` file in this directory. New matters are also synced one-way to [Clio Manage](https://www.clio.com/ca/clio-manage/) via the [clio-mcp](https://github.com/lawyered0/clio-mcp) server.

## Where Things Live

- **Tracker spreadsheet**: `matter-tracker.xlsx` in this directory (the CWD)
- **Client folders**: sibling directories of this file, one per matter (e.g., `./Smith v Jones/`)
- **Per-matter files**: inside each client folder (created/updated by the `work-on-matter` skill):
  - `_matter-brief.md` — current-state snapshot (rewritten as facts change)
  - `_matter-decisions.md` — append-only strategic decisions log with reasoning
  - `_matter-comms.md` — append-only client communication preferences

## Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `daily-triage` | Scan Gmail for new emails, match to open matters, surface urgent items, present a prioritised triage summary |
| `matter-tracker` | Open, update, and close matters — pulls from Gmail + client folders to build timelines, runs conflict checks, maintains the spreadsheet, **and syncs new matters to Clio Manage** (contact + flat-fee matter in one call via `custom_rate`) |
| `work-on-matter` | Load context for an existing matter at session start with a mandatory email refresh, do substantive work with source-first drafting and privilege screening, save to three per-matter files (brief, decisions log, comms), and keep the tracker current inline |
| `calendar-sync` *(helper)* | Push, update, and cancel deadline events on a dedicated "Key Dates" Google Calendar. Invoked internally by the other skills |
| `overdue-triage` | Periodic sweep of all open matters to reconcile stale / expired deadlines against reality |

## Configuration

Fill in the values below for your firm and jurisdiction. These are read by the skills at runtime.

### Firm

```
FIRM_NAME: [Your Firm Name]
LAWYER_SHORTHAND: [Your Initials]
```

`LAWYER_SHORTHAND` is used in timeline entries (e.g., "AB spoke with client re: settlement").

### Court / Tribunal Email Domains

Emails from these domains are flagged as **urgent** by the `daily-triage` skill. Add the domains used by courts, tribunals, and regulatory bodies in your jurisdiction.

```
COURT_EMAIL_DOMAINS:
  - court.gov.example
  - tribunal.gov.example
  - registry.example.gov
```

### Limitation Statutes

The statutes and default periods used for limitation deadline tracking. Edit to match your jurisdiction.

```
LIMITATION_STATUTES:
  - name: General limitation
    period_years: 2
    description: Default limitation period for most civil claims
  - name: Property damage
    period_years: 2
    description: Damage to property
  - name: Contract (written)
    period_years: 6
    description: Breach of written contract
  - name: Personal injury
    period_years: 2
    description: Bodily injury claims
```

### ID Verification

If your firm uses a third-party identity verification service, specify it here. The `matter-tracker` skill will reference this when prompting for client ID checks.

```
ID_VERIFICATION_SERVICE: [e.g., Verified.Me, Jumio, or "manual" for in-person verification]
```

### Calendar Sync *(optional — used by `calendar-sync` skill)*

If you want deadlines pushed to Google Calendar, create a dedicated "Key Dates" calendar and paste its ID below. The calendar's notification settings drive the reminder schedule (recommended default: 14 / 7 / 2 / 0 days before for all-day events).

```
KEY_DATES_CALENDAR_ID: <your-key-dates-calendar-id>@group.calendar.google.com
TIMEZONE: <your-iana-timezone>   # e.g., America/New_York
```

Finding the ID: Google Calendar → Settings → select the calendar → "Integrate calendar" → "Calendar ID". Requires a Google Calendar MCP server connected to Claude.

### Clio Sync

The `matter-tracker` skill syncs new matters to Clio via the [clio-mcp](https://github.com/lawyered0/clio-mcp) server. Set your Clio user id here so that new matters get the correct responsible and originating attorney. Find it by asking Claude "who am I in Clio?" once the clio-mcp server is connected.

```
CLIO_USER_ID: <your-clio-user-id>   # numeric, e.g. 123456
```

Clio sync runs on `new matter` only. `update matter` and `close matter` do not touch Clio — if you need to change a matter's Clio record, do it in the Clio UI.
