This project is a Discord bot for managing book club polls, running as a Cloudflare Worker. It's built with JavaScript, uses vitest for testing, and is configured with wrangler.toml.


Key features include:
  - Creating and managing polls.
  - Two voting systems: "Chris-style" (top-three, points-based) and ranked-choice.
  - Interaction via Discord slash commands and message components.
  - Data persistence for polls, nominations, and votes through a pollManager.


The code is structured with distinct directories for commands, interactions, utilities, services, and database schema.
