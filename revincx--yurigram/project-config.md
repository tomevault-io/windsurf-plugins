# Agent Guide for Telegram Desktop

This guide defines repository-wide instructions for coding agents working with the Telegram Desktop codebase.

## Working from Codex on Windows + WSL

This checkout may be opened in Codex Desktop through the Windows UNC path `\\wsl.localhost\{distro}\home\{user}\Telegram\tdesktop`, while the real Linux path is `/home/{user}/Telegram/tdesktop`. Treat it as a WSL/Linux checkout first, not as a native Windows checkout.

- Prefer running repository-aware commands through WSL:

```powershell
wsl.exe -d {distro} --cd /home/{user}/Telegram/tdesktop -- <command>
```

- PowerShell can read and write files through the UNC path, but native Windows tools may see different ownership, path, executable, or line-ending behavior than Linux tools.
- Git from PowerShell over `\\wsl.localhost\...` can fail with `detected dubious ownership`. Use WSL Git instead. Do not change global Git `safe.directory` settings unless the user explicitly asks for that.
- Keep path styles matched to the shell. Use `/home/{user}/Telegram/tdesktop/...` with WSL commands, and quoted `\\wsl.localhost\{distro}\home\{user}\Telegram\tdesktop\...` paths with native Windows commands. Avoid passing UNC paths to Linux tools or Linux paths to native Windows tools unless the tool explicitly supports them.
- If a command behaves strangely from the PowerShell UNC working directory, retry the same command through `wsl.exe -d {distro} --cd /home/{user}/Telegram/tdesktop -- ...` before concluding the repository or command is broken.
- Recursive searches and repo inspection are usually faster and more faithful through WSL, for example `wsl.exe -d {distro} --cd /home/{user}/Telegram/tdesktop -- rg ...`.
- Do not assume the WSL host has the build toolchain installed directly. In this setup, WSL may not have `cmake`, while Windows may have `cmake`, and the configured `out/` tree may still target the Linux Docker toolchain. Do not run native Windows `cmake --build out` against a Linux/Docker build tree.
- For WSL/Linux builds, use the Docker build entry point from the repository root: `Telegram/build/docker/centos_env/build_debug.sh`. The Docker daemon must be reachable from WSL; checking `docker info` is fine, but do not start a build unless the user asked for one.
- Existing build outputs may be Linux binaries, for example `out/Debug/Telegram` as an ELF executable, not `Telegram.exe`. Verify the build tree before assuming which platform produced it.
- Be careful with text file line endings. In a WSL/Linux checkout, files should remain LF-only unless the file already uses another convention. CRLF finishing applies only to native, non-WSL Windows runs/checkouts. Do not let PowerShell or Windows tools silently rewrite WSL files to CRLF. If a file becomes mixed, normalize it back to the convention appropriate for the current checkout, without adding a UTF-8 BOM.
- When using the local `perform-task` skill from this WSL checkout, keep external AI task artifacts and edited project text files LF-only. Treat its Windows text-normalization phase as not applicable to WSL, except to record that line endings were checked and kept LF/no-BOM. Run CRLF normalization only in a native, non-WSL Windows checkout.

## Build System Structure

The build system expects this directory layout:

```text
L:\Telegram\                    # BuildPath
L:\Telegram\tdesktop\           # Repository (you work here)
L:\Telegram\Libraries\          # 32-bit dependencies (Linux/macOS)
L:\Telegram\win64\Libraries\    # 64-bit dependencies (Windows)
L:\Telegram\ThirdParty\         # Build tools (NuGet, Python, etc.)
```

Dependencies are located relative to the repository: `../Libraries`, `../win64/Libraries`, or `../ThirdParty`.

## Build Configuration

### Build Commands

**From repository root, run:**

```bash
cmake --build out --config Debug --target Telegram
```

That's it. The `out/` directory is already configured. The executable will be at `out/Debug/Telegram.exe`.

**From WSL, run through the Linux Docker build environment:**

```bash
Telegram/build/docker/centos_env/build_debug.sh
```

**Important:** When running cmake from a shell that doesn't support `cd`, use quoted absolute paths:
```bash
cmake --build "l:\Telegram\tx64\out" --config Debug --target Telegram
```

**Never build Release** - it's extremely heavy and not needed for testing changes.

## Platform-Specific Requirements

### Windows
- Requires Visual Studio 2022
- Must run from appropriate Native Tools Command Prompt:
  - "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" for `win64`
  - "x86 Native Tools Command Prompt" for `win`
  - "ARM64 Native Tools Command Prompt" for `winarm`
- Dependencies: `../win64/Libraries` (64-bit) or `../Libraries` (32-bit)

### macOS
- Requires Xcode
- Dependencies: `../Libraries/local/Qt-*`
- Set `QT` environment variable: `export QT=6.8`

### Linux
- Build dependencies in `../Libraries`
- Set `QT` environment variable if needed

## Key Files

- **`Telegram/build/version`** - Version information
- **`out/`** - Build output directory

## Troubleshooting

### "Libraries not found"
Ensure the repository is in `L:\Telegram\tdesktop`. The build system requires `../win64/Libraries` to exist.
