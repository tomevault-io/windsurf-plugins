# Holistic - trade-hunter

## Session Start

At the start of every session, before doing anything else:
1. Read `HOLISTIC.md` in full.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`.
3. Summarise to the user: what was last worked on, what's planned next, and any known fixes to protect.
4. Ask: "Continue as planned, tweak the plan, or do something different?"
5. Use the repo-local Holistic helper in this repo: Windows `.\.holistic\system\holistic.cmd resume --agent cursor`; macOS/Linux `./.holistic/system/holistic resume --agent cursor`.

## Current Objective

Initiate M017 (Distribution & Licensing) to automate the build-time separation of Public (Simulation) and Commercial (Live) editions using scripts/distribute.py.

## Latest Status

Hardened terminology and UI across the entire stack. Standardized the 4-tier signal hierarchy (WHALE CLUSTER, SIGNAL, NOTABLE, WATCH). Purged 'ghost' features and legacy 'Winston' references. Deployed official commercial landing page to GitHub Pages.

## Before ending this session

Run:
```
holistic handoff --summary "..." --next "..."
```
This keeps repo memory current for the next agent.
