# Unit Testing Guidelines

## Testing Strategy
- Write tests for all business logic and utility functions
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Implement integration tests for complex workflows
- Maintain high test coverage (aim for 80%+)

## Test Structure
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Group related tests using describe blocks
- Keep tests focused and isolated

## Mocking and Fixtures
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Use test fixtures for consistent data
- Avoid over-mocking - test real behavior when possible
- Mock API calls and external services

## Best Practices
- Run tests frequently during development
- Fix failing tests immediately
- Use test-driven development when appropriate
- Ensure tests are fast and reliable
