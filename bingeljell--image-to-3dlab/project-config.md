# Repository Guide

How to communicate in this repo: Keep your answers short. No jargon - if we have to use abbriviations or jargon
we must explain it. We simplify everything. We don't over think or over explain. Brevity is important. Humour and wit is acceptable. 

Local Apple Silicon **image → 3D** pipeline wrapping four backends (SF3D, TRELLIS.2, and
two Hunyuan3D-MLX paths — see `docs/hunyuan-mlx-recipes.md`, not the old ComfyUI
route) behind one CLI, with license provenance as a first-class concern.

1. Commits and PRs must not include any co-authorship trailer — Claude, Codex, whatever.
2. **Only commit a script if it generalises.** Anything written for one asset, one
   debugging session or one render stays local — a scratch directory, never `scripts/`.
   Before committing one, take the asset out of it: no hard-coded object, image or
   material names, no colours or measurements that suit only the creature it was written
   for. Turn those into arguments, and it earns its place. And if it is worth committing
   it is worth finding, so list it in `scripts/README.md`; `tests/test_scripts_registry.py`
   fails if you do not.


## Layout

| Path | What lives here |
|------|-----------------|
| `pipeline.py` | CLI entry point (sets MPS env, delegates to `image_to_3dlab.cli`) |
| `image_to_3dlab/` | The package: `cli.py`, `provenance.py`, and one `*_backend.py` per backend |
| `manifests/` | Versioned run manifests (schema v1) — the preferred, traceable way to run |
| `scripts/` | Every command-line tool: generation, repair, texture, measurement, Blender, vendor patches. **`scripts/README.md` indexes all of them** and a test fails if a new script is not listed there |
| `workflows/` | ComfyUI API-format workflow JSON for the Hunyuan `--quality` path |
| `tests/` | pytest suite — one `test_*.py` per script or module it covers; run it with `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q` |
| `journal/` | Investigation logs and session history (git-ignored — local only, not part of the shipped repo) |
| `hunyuan_mlx/` | Xiong's Hunyuan3D-MLX shape+paint port (MIT) — **tracked in-repo**, moved out of `vendor/` 2026-08-19 so a clone alone has the code. `shape/` and `paint/` each need `uv sync`; `weights/` under each is git-ignored, fetched via `download_weights.py`. No patch-reapply dance needed here — fixes are just part of the tracked source |
| `vendor/` | Vendored backend checkouts — **git-ignored**, cloned by the bootstrap scripts (or manually, for `hunyuan-mlx`). `trellis-mac` is a clone of `shivampkumar/trellis-mac` (~1.1 GB of code, weights and compiled Metal kernels); `hunyuan-mlx` is dgrauet's shape port, kept vendored on purpose since it's Tencent-licensed code, not just weights (see `docs/info_and_credits.md`). Ignored because these are someone else's repos at multi-GB scale; the cost is that patches vanish on re-bootstrap, so they live in `scripts/patch_*.py` — except `hunyuan-mlx-paint`, retired 2026-08-19 once its code moved to `hunyuan_mlx/` |
| `characters/` | Per-creature rigs, animations and their tests, one folder each — **git-ignored**. The pipeline is the product; individual creatures are our own content. Scripts here add `scripts/` to `sys.path` explicitly, since shared helpers such as `blender_joint_markers.send` still live there. Run their tests with `pytest characters/` |
| `output/` | Generated assets + `.provenance.json` sidecars (git-ignored) |
| `videos/`, `assets_to_test/` | Promo-video project and backend-comparison meshes — **git-ignored** (2026-09-19). Both are local working material; together they were 223 MB of a 244 MB repo |

## Commit conventions

Use **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)**, one logical change per commit:

```
<type>: <imperative summary>

<optional body: what and why, wrapped ~72 cols>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `build`, `chore`.

- Keep commits small and self-contained — a commit should build and pass tests.
- Separate refactors from behavior changes.
- **No LLM co-author or attribution trailers.** Plain, human-authored messages only.

## Changelog

Follow **[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com)** in `CHANGELOG.md`.

- Every user-facing change adds a line under `## [Unreleased]`, grouped by
  `Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Removed` / `Security`.
- On release, rename `[Unreleased]` to the version + date and open a fresh `[Unreleased]`.
- Versioning is **SemVer**. Provenance schema and manifest schema bumps are breaking.

## Development

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q
ruff check .
python pipeline.py --help
```

- Target Python 3.10/3.11 (not 3.14 — SF3D's native deps don't fit yet).
- Backends that load real models are exercised manually; keep them out of the unit suite.
- Prefer running via a manifest (`--run-manifest manifests/...json`) so runs stay traceable.

## Testing (write the test first — one minute now saves fifteen)

**Every code addition gets a test.** Generation runs cost 15-20 minutes and Blender steps
are interactive, so a defect found by running the real thing is expensive; the same defect
found by a unit test is nearly free. A missing one-line import once cost a full 16-minute
