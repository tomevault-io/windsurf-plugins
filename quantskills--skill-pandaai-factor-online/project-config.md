description: PandaAI factor mining through pandaai-cli. Applies when creating, running, or interpreting factor analyses on the PandaAI platform.
---


Read `SKILL.md` (or `SKILL.zh-CN.md`) in this repository before working on PandaAI factors.

Hard rules:

- Run `python3 scripts/bootstrap.py` first; it checks the environment, config, login, and balance.
- Login is `pandaai-cli login --phone <phone> --password <password>`. If you cannot run a command
  containing a password, hand it to the user. Never print or commit the config file, token, or uid.
- `factor_run` costs compute credits: check `balance`, validate on a short window, batch the rest.
- `MEAN(A,B)` is not a rolling mean; use `MA(X,N)` or `TS_MEAN(X,N)`. See `references/pitfalls.md`.
- Probe the current server backtest limit before budgeting; the latest verified server accepted five
  years. Groups support 2-10; use 10 by default for competition-style decile reporting, and keep the
  universe at 沪深全A.
- 分组1 is the lowest factor value and 分组10 the highest, so the long side follows the direction flag.
- Rank candidates by long-decile excess return net of turnover cost, not the headline long-short number.
