# About this project

This project is a monorepo that contains many packages to build a SaaS Cloud and On-prem Server version of the SonarQube Frontend.

# Important skills

- `echoes-components` for working with Echoes design system `@sonarsource/echoes-react`.
- `webapp-code-sharing` for understanding the complex project organization of this NX repo.
- `webapp-testing` for understanding how to write good tests.
- `writing-code-style-guide` for understanding how to write good compliant code.

Load these skills only when the task actually requires them — do not load them at startup.

# NX Projects

These are the NX projects in the monorepo. You can use `webapp-code-sharing` to understand how they fit together.

# Testing, Linting, and running Tools

There are many configuration files for tools like linting and testing. If needed, check and read the relevent config files before deciding on what to do.

Tests can be run and targeted to a particular directory or file like so:

- `yarn nx run sq-server:test /path/to/tests`
- `yarn nx run sq-cloud:test /path/to/tests`

Other types of validation follow the pattern:

- `yarn nx run <project-name>:<script-name> <optional-args>`
- For example `yarn nx run sq-server-features:lint`
- Use the `project.json` to figure out what scripts are available for which projects.

When running tests, pick the most relevent platform (cloud or server) and narrowly scope the test run to the files you've modified as tests take time to run.

- ALWAYS use `await selector.find()` instead of `waitfor()` when looking for a possibly not-yet-rendered selector.

When you need to write tests (and are NOT running `/browse-and-verify`), use the `webapp-testing` skill.

# Writing Code

- Try not to write duplicate code, and reorganize if necessary to keep things DRY.
- Never attempt to fix linting issues until you believe the implementation is correct.
- Always fix typescript errors
- For components, always prefer `export { ComponentName }` intead of `export default ComponentName()` (it prevents renaming of components at import)
- **MANDATORY**: ALWAYS run `yarn prettier --write <file>` immediately after editing any file to ensure proper formatting.
- **MANDATORY**: Before committing or declaring a task done, ALWAYS run `yarn nx run sq-cloud:ts-check` (or `sq-server` as appropriate). The IDE diagnostics tool is not sufficient — it misses real TypeScript errors that `tsc --noEmit` catches in CI.

## Tailwind and CSS

- `sw-*` is our custom tailwind prefix.
- Prefer tailwind helper classes over custom CSS (using emotion) when possible.

## Echoes Component Styling

- **ALWAYS** prefer semantic Echoes component properties over low-level Tailwind styling classes
- **ALWAYS** prefer echoes components over legacy `design-system` components for new code.
- Use component-specific props for visual styling (colors, fonts, sizes, emphasis) rather than manual CSS classes
- Reserve custom Tailwind only for layout concerns (spacing, positioning, dimensions)
- Examples: `isSubtle` instead of `sw-text-gray-600`, `size="small"` instead of `sw-text-sm`, `colorOverride="danger"` instead of `sw-text-red-600`

When you need to use echoes components, always use the `echoes-components` skill!

## React Components and JSX

- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- **MANDATORY**: All newly created components MUST be functional components. No class components allowed.

## Localization

- If you make a new localization key, say so when you summarize your changes!
- Localization updates goes into files: messages.json for SQC or default.ts for SQS.
- Do not use default messages in code. Only use a key.

```ts
// Always destructure like this
const { formatMessage } = useIntl()
// Never do this
const intl = useIntl()
intl.formatMessage(...)
```

## React Query / TanStack Query Best Practices

**Core Principle**: Always reuse existing queries/mutations and return standard TanStack Query results.

### Queries

- **NEVER** create custom interfaces when reusing existing queries: `return { data: transformedData, isLoading, customField: 'value' }`
- **ALWAYS** return exactly what the base query returns when reusing: `return baseQuery` or `return baseQuery({ select })`
- Use `createQueryHook` for base to enable `select`, `enabled` and other options override support
- Call base queries with `select` parameter for data transformation: `useBaseQuery(params, { select: (data) => transformedData })`

### Mutations

- **NEVER** wrap mutations when reusing existing ones: `return { isPending: mutation.isPending, mutate: customMutate }`
- **ALWAYS** use `useMutation({ mutationFn: async (input) => existingMutation.mutateAsync(transformedInput) })` if you need to reuse existing mutations.
