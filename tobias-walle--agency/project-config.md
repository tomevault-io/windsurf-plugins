# Project

Agency is a command-line AI agent orchestrator. It helps developers run one or more coding agents (e.g. Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenCode) in isolated Git worktrees with tmux-managed sessions, while providing both a friendly TUI and a full-featured CLI. The daemon tracks sessions and notifies clients; the CLI/TUI attach to tmux for interactive work.

# Committing

- Use conventional commits e.g.:
  - `docs: add change proposal for ...`
  - `feat: implement ...`
  - `fix: fix ...`
- You MUST add the files and the create the commit in the same command for easy review e.g.:
  - `git add fileA.rs fileB.rs && git commit -m "feat: ..."`
- Keep commit messages short. Never add semicolons in them. Omit the description. Don't leave an agent signature.
- If you are committing a spec change always start with `docs: add spec change for ...`

# Code Style

- Naming
  - Avoid single-letter variable names except trivial indices; use descriptive names (e.g., `draft_text`, `editor_args`).
  - Avoid similar names in the same scope (e.g., `argv` vs `args`); choose clearly distinct identifiers.
  - Avoid underscore-prefixed bindings in production and tests; use descriptive names.
- Function Size & Structure
  - Keep functions under ~100 lines; extract helpers to satisfy `clippy::too_many_lines`.
  - Reduce nesting: early-returns, guard clauses, and splitting logic into small functions.
  - Prefer `let...else` over manual `match` for input validation and early exits.
  - Do not place item declarations after statements in a scope; declare items before executable code.
  - Prefer `while let` loops for stream/frame reads or "read-until-end" patterns instead of `loop { match ... }`.
- Match Hygiene
  - Merge identical match arms; avoid wildcard `_` on enums where future variants are possible.
  - Use explicit variants or a catch-all with clear handling.
- Documentation
  - For any function returning `Result`, include a `# Errors` section describing failure cases.
- Conversions
  - Avoid lossy numeric casts; use `TryFrom`, checked conversions, or explicit bounds handling.
  - Do not wrap return values in `Result` without actual error paths.
- Parameter Passing
  - Prefer passing by reference when the value is not consumed.
  - Prefer `Option<&T>` over `&Option<T>` for optional borrows.
- Error Handling
  - Do not panic in library code; return errors instead. In tests, prefer `assert!`/`assert_eq!` over `panic!`.
- Lint Hygiene
  - Prefer fixing code over broad `#[allow(...)]`; when needed, keep allows local and narrowly scoped.
- Imports
  - Always use `use` statements at the top of the file instead of inline `crate::path::Type` paths in function signatures or implementations.
- You MUST keep the code linear (avoid nesting)
- If this is not given, you MUST do the following:
  - Detect duplicated code and extract it to seperate functions
  - Detect strong nesting and create functions to reduce it
  - Use language feature to reduce nesting

# TTY Handling

Agency must work correctly in both interactive terminals and non-interactive environments (e.g., AI agents like Claude Code). Use `ctx.tty` for all TTY-related checks.

Guidelines:
- Never read from stdin without checking `ctx.tty.is_interactive()` first
- Commands that require TTY (e.g., attach, TUI) should bail with a clear error message
- Use `ctx.tty.confirm(prompt, default, yes_flag)` for all confirmations
- In non-TTY environments, confirmations auto-proceed with `default=true` to enable scripting

# Tests

- Integration tests are living in `./crates/agency/tests/`
- You MUST use the TestEnv in `./crates/agency/tests/common/mod.rs` for all tests
- Every integration test needs to be wrapped into `TestEnv::run`
- Readability is extremly important. Tests must be linear. Add new helpers to the TestEnv if it helps readability and avoids complex method chains inside the tests.

# Planning

Before creating plans, you MUST check your assumptions:

- `## Goals`
- `[goals (as a bullet point list)]`
- `## Out of scope`
- `[non-goals (as a bullet point list)]`
- `## Current Behavior`
- `[how does the system currently work (based on your research). Make sure to directly reference relevant files and code snippets.]`
- `## Questions`
- `[Numbered questions and the assumed answers that went into this plan. The user might want to modify the assumptions.]`

Afterwards present your full plan in the format below

- `## Solution`
- `[how will the behavior be changed to solve the problem (in bullet points). Stay high level and focus on architecture and avoid verbose implementation details.]`
- `## Architecture`
- `[overview of the new, modified and deleted files and symbols in a tree of bullet points. Should be more detailed than solution for a quick review of a Tech Lead.]`
- `## Testing`
- `[Bullet point list with the test cases you want to create or modify. Mark each test with "Unit" or "TTY". Take into account that the unit tests cannot start the daemon or tmux.]`
