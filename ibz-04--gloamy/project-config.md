# AGENTS.md — Gloamy Agent Engineering Protocol

This file defines the default working protocol for coding agents in this repository.
Scope: entire repository.

## 1) Project Snapshot (Read First)

Gloamy is a Rust-first autonomous agent runtime optimized for:

- high performance
- high efficiency
- high stability
- high extensibility
- high sustainability
- high security

Core architecture is trait-driven and modular. Most extension work should be done by implementing traits and registering in factory modules.

Key extension points:

- `src/providers/traits.rs` (`Provider`)
- `src/channels/traits.rs` (`Channel`)
- `src/tools/traits.rs` (`Tool`)
- `src/memory/traits.rs` (`Memory`)
- `src/observability/traits.rs` (`Observer`)
- `src/runtime/traits.rs` (`RuntimeAdapter`)
- `src/peripherals/traits.rs` (`Peripheral`) — hardware boards (STM32, RPi GPIO)

## 2) Deep Architecture Observations (Why This Protocol Exists)

These codebase realities should drive every design decision:

1. **Trait + factory architecture is the stability backbone**
    - Extension points are intentionally explicit and swappable.
    - Most features should be added via trait implementation + factory registration, not cross-cutting rewrites.
2. **Security-critical surfaces are first-class and internet-adjacent**
    - `src/gateway/`, `src/security/`, `src/tools/`, `src/runtime/` carry high blast radius.
    - Defaults already lean secure-by-default (pairing, bind safety, limits, secret handling); keep it that way.
3. **Performance and binary size are product goals, not nice-to-have**
    - `Cargo.toml` release profile and dependency choices optimize for size and determinism.
    - Convenience dependencies and broad abstractions can silently regress these goals.
4. **Config and runtime contracts are user-facing API**
    - `src/config/schema.rs` and CLI commands are effectively public interfaces.
    - Backward compatibility and explicit migration matter.
5. **The project now runs in high-concurrency collaboration mode**
    - CI + docs governance + label routing are part of the product delivery system.
    - PR throughput is a design constraint; not just a maintainer inconvenience.

## 3) Engineering Principles (Normative)

These principles are mandatory by default. They are not slogans; they are implementation constraints.

### 3.1 KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

**Why here:** Runtime + security behavior must stay auditable under pressure.

Required:

- Prefer straightforward control flow over clever meta-programming.
- Prefer explicit match branches and typed structs over hidden dynamic behavior.
- Keep error paths obvious and localized.

### 3.2 YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

**Why here:** Premature features increase attack surface and maintenance burden.

Required:

- Do not add new config keys, trait methods, feature flags, or workflow branches without a concrete accepted use case.
- Do not introduce speculative “future-proof” abstractions without at least one current caller.
- Keep unsupported paths explicit (error out) rather than adding partial fake support.

### 3.3 DRY + Rule of Three

**Why here:** Naive DRY can create brittle shared abstractions across providers/channels/tools.

Required:

- Duplicate small, local logic when it preserves clarity.
- Extract shared utilities only after repeated, stable patterns (rule-of-three).
- When extracting, preserve module boundaries and avoid hidden coupling.

### 3.4 SRP + ISP (Single Responsibility + Interface Segregation)

**Why here:** Trait-driven architecture already encodes subsystem boundaries.

Required:

- Keep each module focused on one concern.
- Do not make monolithic files
- Extend behavior by implementing existing narrow traits whenever possible.
- Avoid fat interfaces and “god modules” that mix policy + transport + storage.

### 3.5 Fail Fast + Explicit Errors

**Why here:** Silent fallback in agent runtimes can create unsafe or costly behavior.

Required:

- Prefer explicit `bail!`/errors for unsupported or unsafe states.
- Never silently broaden permissions/capabilities.
- Document fallback behavior when fallback is intentional and safe.

### 3.6 Secure by Default + Least Privilege

**Why here:** Gateway/tools/runtime can execute actions with real-world side effects.

Required:

- Deny-by-default for access and exposure boundaries.
- Never log secrets, raw tokens, or sensitive payloads.
- Keep network/filesystem/shell scope as narrow as possible unless explicitly justified.

### 3.7 Determinism + Reproducibility

**Why here:** Reliable CI and low-latency triage depend on deterministic behavior.

Required:

- Prefer reproducible commands and locked dependency behavior in CI-sensitive paths.
- Keep tests deterministic (no flaky timing/network dependence without guardrails).
- Ensure local validation commands map to CI expectations.

### 3.8 Reversibility + Rollback-First Thinking

**Why here:** Fast recovery is mandatory under high PR volume.

Required:

- Keep changes easy to revert (small scope, clear blast radius).
- For risky changes, define rollback path before merge.
- Avoid mixed mega-patches that block safe rollback.

## 4) Repository Map (High-Level)

- `src/main.rs` — CLI entrypoint and command routing
