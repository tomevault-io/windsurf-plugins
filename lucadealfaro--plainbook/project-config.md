# Plainbook

This is a project to create a plain language version of Python notebooks. 

## Plainbook format

Plainbooks are stored using the same format as Jupyter notebooks, but differ in the way in 
which the format is interpreted. 
A plainbook has three kinds of cells: 

* **Action Cells:** In an action cell, the cell.markdown.explanation contains a description in plain language of what the cell should do.  The cell is represented similarly to a code cell of Jupyter.  The source code is generated automatically from the explanation using an LLM, and it is stored in cell.source. 

* **Comment cells:** These are like the markdown cells in Jupyter.

* **Test cells:** These are cells, from which tests are generated automatically using AI. Unlike in action cells, test cells have access to the status of all prior cells, so that one can write assertions that compare the status across different cells.  The source code is generated automatically, and stored in cell.source. 

## Code organization

The code is divided into server code, and client code. 

### Server Code

The server code is written in Python, on top of the bottle.py web server. 
The main files are as follows:
* main.py : web interface.
* plainbook.py : contains the `Plainbook` class, with methods for saving cell content, executing cells, and so on. It uses the snapshot kernel (https://github.com/lucadealfaro/snapshot-kernel) for code execution.
* ai_common.py : common code for AI interfaces.
* gemini.py : interface to Gemini LLM for code generation and verification.
* claude.py : interface to Claude LLM for code generation and verification.

### Client Code

The client code is written in Javascript, with the help of the following frameworks: 

* Vue 3 javascript framework
* Bulma css framework
* Awesome Font 4.7 icons

#### Javascript code organization

The main file is in views/index.html; it loads js/nb.js as the main client code. 
In turn, js/nb.js loads all the other Vue components in the js/ folder. For example, the top app navbar is in js/AppNavbar.js, the code for displaying a cell is in js/NotebookCell.js, and so on. 

#### CSS code organization

The CSS is in css/main.css.  This file is not edited per se; see the css/README.md file for details. 
Essentially, the css/main.css file is generated from css/main.scss using: 

    npm run build

#### HTML conventions

We use boxincons, that have a form such as <i class="bx bx-play"></i>.
Communication with the server for the notebook is done in nb.js.  
Communication for other purposes is done in the various vue compoments as appropriate. 


## Architecture note

The project uses a single `Plainbook` class in `plainbook/plainbook.py`, backed by the snapshot kernel (https://github.com/lucadealfaro/snapshot-kernel). The snapshot kernel runs as a subprocess and is communicated with via HTTP API. Each cell execution creates a named snapshot, enabling efficient re-execution from any point without restarting from the beginning.
