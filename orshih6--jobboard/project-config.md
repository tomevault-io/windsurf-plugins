# General rule

- You must only work in the src/** directory and not make any changes to other files.
- You must only use existing libraries in package.json, so don't use libraries that are not listed there.
- Use context7 to determine the project’s library version and apply it accordingly.
- You must use @headlessui/react^2.2.9 to create components.
- You must use @heroicons/react to render icons.
- You must use import { cn } from @/lib/utils.ts function if you need to calculated classes.
- Don't pass a lot of props, use zustand to handle it.
- Before finalizing, please run yarn lint. Only errors must be fixed. Warnings can be ignored. If it works correctly, you can consider your work finished. (This will also check all ESLint rules.)
