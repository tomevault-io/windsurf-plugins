description: Rust Ownership and Borrowing Best Practices
---

This rule enforces best practices related to Rust's ownership and borrowing system.

## Rule Details

- **Pattern**: `*.rs`
- **Severity**: Error
- **Category**: Ownership

## Checks

1. **Unnecessary Clone Usage**
   - Avoid using `.clone()` when ownership can be transferred
   - Prefer references when possible
   - Use `&str` instead of `String` for string literals

2. **Mutable References**
   - Ensure only one mutable reference exists at a time
   - Avoid unnecessary mutability
   - Use `&mut` only when data needs to be modified

3. **Lifetime Annotations**
   - Add explicit lifetime annotations when compiler cannot infer them
   - Use descriptive lifetime names (e.g., `'a`, `'static`)
   - Ensure lifetime parameters are properly constrained

4. **Reference Counting**
   - Use `Arc` for shared ownership across threads
   - Use `Rc` for shared ownership within a single thread
   - Consider using `Weak` references to break reference cycles

## Examples

### Good
```rust
fn process_string(s: &str) {
    // Using string slice instead of owned String
}

fn modify_data(data: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    // Clear mutable reference usage
}
```

### Bad
```rust
fn process_string(s: String) {
    // Unnecessary ownership transfer
}

fn modify_data(data: &mut Vec<i32>, other: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    // Multiple mutable references to same data
}
```

## Rationale

Rust's ownership system is fundamental to its memory safety guarantees. Following these practices ensures:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Thread safety without runtime overhead
- Clear ownership semantics
- Efficient resource management
