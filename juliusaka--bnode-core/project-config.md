# bnode-core Copilot Instructions

## Critical rule

**Always update docs and instruction files in the same task as code changes.** See `python-workflows.instructions.md` → "Always update docs and instructions" for the full rule.

Do not preserve legacy compatibility branches, old schema support, historical aliases, or obsolete artifact names unless the user explicitly asks for compatibility.

## Communication

- Explain proposed changes in enough detail that the user can clearly understand the intended work before or while making it, and provide detailed feedback about the outcome.

## Scope and baseline

- These instructions apply to the `bnode-core` repository root. If you are working from the superproject root, follow the superproject instruction file instead of translating paths manually.
- Assume the environment is already provisioned by the user. Do **not** run `uv sync`, change dependency extras, or rebuild the environment unless explicitly asked.
- Activate the existing environment, then prefer direct Python entry points:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- Prefer `python -m ...`, `python -m pytest ...`, and `python -m ruff ...` over `uv run`.
- Run pytest from the repository root and reuse the same activated shell session.

## Targeted instruction files

- `.github/instructions/python-workflows.instructions.md` — environment policy, common commands, Hydra config roots, and workflow-contract guidance for normal Python work
- `.github/instructions/pytest-workflows.instructions.md` — pytest execution policy, suite map, and high-value test commands
- `.github/instructions/config-schema.instructions.md` — `src/bnode_core/config.py`, `tests/test_config.py`, and `resources/config/**/*.yaml`
- `.github/instructions/bnode-export.instructions.md` — BNODE ONNX exporter changes in `src/bnode_core/ode/bnode/bnode_export.py` and `tests/ode/test_bnode_export.py`
- `.github/instructions/trainer-restart.instructions.md` — restart-state architecture, trainer resume flow, and restart-state docs/tests
- `.github/instructions/docs-structure.instructions.md` — MkDocs page placement and `mkdocs.yml` updates

Read the targeted file for the area you are changing instead of duplicating its detailed guidance here.

## Instruction precedence

- The most specific targeted instruction file wins over this routing summary on overlapping details.
- When multiple targeted files apply, resolve them by specificity:
  - `bnode-export.instructions.md` or `config-schema.instructions.md`
  - then `pytest-workflows.instructions.md` or `docs-structure.instructions.md`
  - then `python-workflows.instructions.md`
- Keep using `python-workflows.instructions.md` for environment policy and Hydra-root expectations even when a more specific file also applies.

## Working-root decision ladder

1. Use the superproject root when the task depends on the top-level heat-pump `config/` tree.
2. Use the `bnode-core` root when the task depends on package-local `resources/config/`, docs, or package-local test behavior.
3. If command behavior depends on the root, say which root the command assumes instead of translating paths implicitly.
