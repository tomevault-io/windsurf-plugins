# Git commits

**Never add `Co-authored-by` trailers to commit messages.**

This includes and is not limited to:

- `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>`
- `Co-authored-by: Claude ...`
- Any other AI or agent co-author line

When committing:

1. Write the commit message yourself in a HEREDOC or `-m` flag — do not rely on tooling that auto-appends co-authors.
2. Before pushing, verify with `git log -1 --format='%B'` that no `Co-authored-by:` line is present.
3. If one appears, amend the commit and remove it before pushing.

The repository owner does not want AI tools listed as co-authors in git history.
