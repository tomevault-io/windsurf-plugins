# Paytick Project Rules

## Release Process

### How to Release a New Version
Use the release script to publish a new version:

```bash
release 1.0.7
```

Or run the script directly:
```bash
./scripts/update-version.sh 1.0.7
```

This will automatically:
1. Update `MARKETING_VERSION` in Xcode project
2. Commit the change
3. Create tag `v1.0.7`
4. Push to remote

**Important:** The tag points to the commit with the correct version number, ensuring builds use the right version.

### Setup Release Alias (one-time)
Add to your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
alias release='./scripts/update-version.sh'
```

## Git Commit Guidelines

### Language
- Commit messages MUST be written in English only
- This applies to both subject line and body

### Format
Use conventional commits: `type: description`

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`

**Rules:**
- Subject line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- No period at end of subject line

### Examples
```
feat: add dark mode support for dashboard
fix: resolve notification timezone offset issue
refactor: simplify income calculation by removing lunch deduction
perf: reduce timer frequency to prevent memory growth
```

## Code Style

### Swift
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use SwiftUI best practices
- Prefer `calendar.component()` over `dateComponents(in:from:)` for timezone safety
- All code comments in English

### Architecture
- Services handle business logic and data persistence
- ViewModels manage UI state and coordinate services
- Use Combine for reactive data binding
- Timer callbacks should use `autoreleasepool` for memory efficiency
