# Agent Architecture

> **The `.md` files in this repo are runtime prompt artifacts, not documentation.**
> `server.py` loads them at startup and injects their content into MCP tool descriptions
> and prompts. Editing them changes what the agent is instructed to do.
> `README.md` is the only human-facing documentation.

## Contributing

This repo uses **GitHub Flow**: all changes go through a branch + PR, never committed directly to `main`. `main` has branch protection enforced — direct pushes are rejected.

1. Create a branch for your change (`git switch -c <branch>`) **before** the first commit. Never commit on `main` and open a PR afterward — the squash-merge will leave local `main` permanently diverged from `origin/main`.
2. Open a PR against `main`
3. Merge via the GitHub UI (squash merge preferred)

### After a PR merges

This repo squash-merges, so the merged commit on `origin/main` has a different SHA than the local feature commits. Clean up with reset, not pull:

```
git switch main
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

Do **not** `git pull` on `main` when local `main` has commits matching the just-merged PR — `pull` will create a merge commit because the squash changed the SHA. If you must `pull`, use `git pull --ff-only` so divergence fails loudly instead of silently merging.

## Deployment

The MCP server runs on the NRP Nautilus Kubernetes cluster.

- **Prod:** `https://duckdb-mcp.nrp-nautilus.io` — `k8s/deployment.yaml` (replica count and image pin live there)
- **Dev:** `https://dev-duckdb-mcp.nrp-nautilus.io` — `k8s/dev-deployment.yaml`; must stay ≥2 replicas so cross-pod bugs surface here before prod
- **Resources:** 16 Gi RAM requested, up to 160 Gi / 16 CPU per pod
- **STAC catalog:** `https://s3-west.nrp-nautilus.io/public-data/stac/catalog.json` (set via `STAC_CATALOG_URL` env var)
- **Ingress:** HAProxy with CORS enabled, 10-minute query timeout, 1-hour SSE tunnel timeout

### MCP transport: stateless HTTP

The server runs FastMCP in **stateless streamable-HTTP mode** (`server.py`: `FastMCP(..., stateless_http=True)`). Every `POST /mcp` is a complete, independent request/response. There is no `Mcp-Session-Id` pinning clients to a replica, no per-pod session cache, no in-memory state that survives across requests. The protocol's stateful SSE mode is **not** in use here.

This is intentional and load-bearing. Several things depend on it:

- The Service has `sessionAffinity: None` and the ingress uses `balance-algorithm: leastconn`. Both rely on the stateless premise — replicas are interchangeable on a per-request basis.
- Each query runs in a fresh `duckdb.connect(":memory:")` (the Isolation Engine, `server.py` §4). No connection, credential, or DuckDB state survives between requests.
- Durable cross-pod state for genuinely persistent artifacts (e.g. hex tile pyramid build markers, PRs #146–#148) lives in **S3** markers, not pod memory, for exactly this reason.

**Do not** introduce per-pod in-memory caches keyed on something the client provides expecting the same pod will see the next request — under stateless HTTP it almost certainly won't, and even if it did once, scaling up replicas or a single rollout breaks the assumption silently.

### Rollout workflow

Application code is **baked into the image** (`COPY . /app` in the `Dockerfile`); pods no
longer `git clone` at startup. `docker.yml` builds on every push to `main` and on `vX.Y.Z`
release tags. The image is the unit of release.

**Tags CI produces:**
- `:main` — moving; rebuilt on every push to `main` and by the weekly cron. **dev** tracks this.
- `:<git-sha>` — immutable; one per commit.
- `:vX.Y.Z` — immutable; built on release tags. **prod** pins this (by digest, below).

**Merge to `main` → redeploy dev:**
```
kubectl apply -f k8s/dev-deployment.yaml
kubectl rollout restart deployment/dev-duckdb-mcp -n biodiversity
```
dev pins `:main` with `imagePullPolicy: Always`, so the restart pulls the freshest build.
**Wait for the `docker.yml` run on your merge to go green first** — rolling before the
image is pushed gives `ImagePullBackOff`.

**Tag a release → redeploy prod (promote by digest):**
1. `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`, then wait for `docker.yml` to build `:vX.Y.Z`.
2. Read the digest from the build run's job summary, or:
   `docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/boettiger-lab/mcp-data-server:vX.Y.Z --format '{{.Manifest.Digest}}'`
3. Set `image: ghcr.io/boettiger-lab/mcp-data-server:vX.Y.Z@sha256:<digest>` in
   `k8s/deployment.yaml` (separate commit).
4. `kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml`
5. `kubectl rollout restart deployment/duckdb-mcp -n biodiversity`

prod pins an immutable `:vX.Y.Z@sha256:…` (tag for humans, digest enforced — if they ever
disagree, the digest wins). **Never apply prod while the manifest points at an image CI
hasn't built yet** — the rollout stalls on `ImagePullBackOff`. `kubectl apply` must precede
`rollout restart`; a git push alone does not update the cluster.

Verify all prod replicas converge on a single digest after rollout:
```
kubectl -n biodiversity get pods -l app=duckdb-mcp \
  -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,IMAGE:.status.containerStatuses[0].imageID'
```
