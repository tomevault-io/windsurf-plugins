# Repository Instructions

## Purpose

This repository is the canonical My Farm Advisor skill catalog. It contains only the approved My Farm Advisor skills. Reusable Superior Byteworks skills are external dependencies, not repo content.

## In-scope skills

Only these skill roots are in scope unless the task explicitly adds a new skill:

- `my-farm-advisor/`: umbrella farm advisory, farm data pipelines, field management, imagery, soil, weather, EDA, strategy, and admin maps.
- `my-farm-breeding-trial-management/`: breeding operations, trial design, fieldbooks, germplasm, selection, crossing, and field trial placement.
- `my-farm-qtl-analysis/`: QTL and GWAS analysis, QC, population structure, genomic prediction, and reporting.

## Dependency boundary

Do not vendor, copy, mirror, or partially import Superior Byteworks skills into this repository. `superior-byte-works-skills` is installed separately and remains the dependency source.

Excluded legacy copies stay out of this repo:

- `superior-byte-works-wrighter`
- `superior-byte-works-google-timesfm-forecasting`

If a task needs Superior Byteworks behavior, update dependency notes or references, not copied files.

## Asset and generated output policy

Do not commit generated or downloaded runtime assets. Do not track `data/`, `.cache/`, build artifacts, `node_modules/`, generated example `output/` folders, or runtime geoadmin payloads.

Runtime geoadmin payload examples include `countries.geojson`, `states_usa.geojson`, and county GeoJSON outputs under `data/my-farm-advisor/shared/geoadmin/`.

Metadata, source URL records, downloader scripts, small JSON or GeoJSON metadata, and reproducibility docs may be committed. Binary assets over 1 MB require Git LFS and reviewer approval. Required LFS-backed formats include `.npy`, `.npz`, `.raw`, `.bin`, `.so`, `.dylib`, and `.dll`.

## Validation

Run from the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

Treat validation failure as a blocker unless the task is only drafting docs and explicitly says not to run commands. The validator checks required `SKILL.md` and `README.md` files, provenance records, forbidden paths, and asset policy compliance.

## Contribution default

Branch work should create a new skill unless the user explicitly asks to add, extend, or modify an existing skill.

New skills need a skill root with `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `PROVENANCE.md`, local examples or docs as needed, and validation compatibility. Existing skill changes should be as small as possible and stay within the requested skill tree.

## Skill layout expectations

Each top-level skill root should keep:

- `SKILL.md` as the compact routing entrypoint.
- `README.md` as the human overview.
- `PROVENANCE.md` as the source and import record.
- `INDEX.md`, `GUIDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, examples, references, scripts, or data notes as local workflow docs when present.

Subtree docs should be loaded on demand. Avoid making `SKILL.md` a full manual.

## SKILL.md and router rules

Keep `SKILL.md` short, accurate, and route-focused. Use it to answer when to invoke the skill, where to start, and which local index, guide, AGENTS file, or example family to open next.

Do not duplicate every example or long workflow in `SKILL.md` when a local `README.md`, `INDEX.md`, `GUIDE.md`, or `AGENTS.md` already covers it. Preserve frontmatter names and metadata unless the task explicitly changes skill identity. Prefer focused references and guides that agents load only when needed.
