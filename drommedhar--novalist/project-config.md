# Copilot Instructions

Before responding that work is finished, you MUST run `npm run verify` and confirm it completed successfully.
Warnings are strictly disallowed; resolve all warnings before considering work finished.
Do NOT use `eslint-disable` comments to suppress lint errors; fix the underlying issue instead.

## New Entity Types / Views Checklist

When adding a new entity type (like Characters, Locations, Items, Lore) or a new view, ensure the following are updated:

- **Ribbon toolbar** (`src/utils/toolbarUtils.ts`): Add a create button in the Create panel and/or a view button in the Views panel. Add the corresponding SVG icon path to the `createLucideIcon` icon map.
- **Peek cards** (`src/cm/focusPeekExtension.ts` + `src/main.ts` `setupFocusPeek`): Extend `EntityPeekData.type`, update `getEntityAtPosition` to detect the new folder path, update `getEntityPeekData` to parse the new sheet and return the correct fields, and update card rendering (icon, badge, pills, description).
- **Folder creation**: In the `createXxx` method, ensure the target folder is created if it doesn't exist (`vault.createFolder`) before calling `vault.create`. Older projects won't have folders for newly introduced entity types.

## README Maintenance

When adding, removing, or changing user-facing features, update `README.md` to reflect the current state. Follow these style rules:

- Keep the logo (`images/novalist.png`) at the top. Do not add other images or screenshots.
- Open with a single short paragraph summarizing the plugin.
- **Getting Started** section explains the startup wizard and project initialization.
- **Features** section has one `###` subsection per feature. Each subsection starts with a brief description of what the feature does, then lists concrete details in short bullet points or compact prose. No fluff — every sentence should convey useful information.
- Use inline code for UI labels, keyboard shortcuts, and token examples. Use bold for emphasis sparingly.
- **Settings** table lists every user-configurable setting with columns: Setting, Description, Default.
- **Commands** table lists every command palette entry with columns: Command, Description.
- **Internationalization** section is a single short paragraph.
- **Support Development** section with the PayPal donate button stays at the bottom, followed by the tagline.
- Tone is direct, factual, and concise. No marketing language, no exclamation marks, no filler.

## Wiki Maintenance

The project has a GitHub wiki at `https://github.com/Drommedhar/novalist/wiki`, stored as a separate git repo cloned at `J:\git\novalist-wiki`. When adding, removing, or changing user-facing features, update the relevant wiki page(s) to reflect the current state. Follow these rules:

- The wiki uses GitHub-flavored Markdown with `[[Page Name]]` wikilinks for cross-page navigation.
- `Home.md` is the landing page with a table of contents linking to all other pages. Keep it in sync when pages are added or removed.
- Each feature has its own page. Page filenames use `Kebab-Case.md` (e.g., `Plot-Board.md`, `Inline-Annotations.md`).
- Each page ends with a `---` separator and a "Next:" link to the following page in reading order (or "Back to: [[Home]]" for the last page).
- `Settings-Reference.md` and `Commands-Reference.md` are exhaustive reference tables — add new settings or commands there when introduced.
- `Tips-and-Workflows.md` covers practical usage advice — update it when new workflows become possible.
- Tone matches the README: direct, factual, concise. No marketing language.
- After editing wiki files, commit from `J:\git\novalist-wiki` with a descriptive commit message. Do NOT push automatically — the user will push manually.
