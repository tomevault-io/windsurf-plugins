# Agent Guidance

Museek keeps durable project memory in `docs/memory/`.

Before substantial planning, implementation, debugging, or review:

1. Read `docs/memory/manifest.md`; it is the sole routing authority.
2. Read `docs/memory/brief.md`.
3. Load only task-matched files named by the manifest.
4. If the memory directory exists without `manifest.md`, stop and report incomplete setup.
5. Do not load `inbox.md` or `archive/` unless asked or maintaining memory.

After meaningful decisions, repeated corrections, or rejected approaches, update the appropriate memory file or propose a concise update.
