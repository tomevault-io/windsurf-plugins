# No AI Agent Attribution (Hard Constraint)

AI agent attribution in version control is **strictly forbidden** under all circumstances. This applies to Cursor, Composer, Claude, Copilot, Codex, Gemini, Pythinker, and any other AI coding agent.

## Prohibited in commits

Never add any of the following to commit messages, commit commands, or PR text:

- `Co-authored-by:` trailers naming an AI agent or tool
- `Made-with:` / `Made-by:` / `Generated-by:` trailers
- `git commit --trailer ...` or any `--trailer` flag
- Phrases such as "Done by AI", "Written with Cursor", or similar attribution

## Required commit format

Use plain commits only:

```bash
git commit -m "type: subject"
# or
git commit -F /path/to/message.txt
```

Do **not** append trailers, co-authors, or attribution metadata.

## If attribution was added anyway

1. Amend locally to remove it: `git commit --amend` (edit message to remove trailers)
2. Never use `--no-verify` or `--no-gpg-sign` to bypass hooks
3. Never ask the user to bypass project policy

## Enforcement

- `.cursor/hooks/block-ai-commit-attribution.sh` blocks offending `git commit` shell commands
- `scripts/git-hooks/pre-push-no-ai-coauthorship.sh` rejects pushes containing AI attribution

These checks are mandatory and cannot be disabled by the agent.
