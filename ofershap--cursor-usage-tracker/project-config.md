# cursor-usage-tracker — Project Context

Open-source Cursor IDE usage monitoring, anomaly detection, and alerting for enterprise teams.

## Project Goals

This dashboard answers four questions:

1. **Cost monitoring** - Are we spending too much? Who's driving it? Why?
2. **Cost optimization** - Who's using expensive models when cheaper ones would do? How much would switching save?
3. **Adoption tracking** - Is everyone using the tool we're paying for?
4. **Usage understanding** - How is each person working with AI?

It is NOT a developer performance measurement tool. Cursor metrics cannot tell you if someone shipped a great feature or wrote bad code. The dashboard monitors cost, adoption, and usage patterns.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router, Turbopack) + TypeScript strict
- SQLite via better-sqlite3 (zero-config, file at `data/tracker.db`)
- Recharts for charts, Tailwind CSS for styling (zinc dark theme)
- Vitest for tests, ESLint 9 flat config, Prettier
- Docker (multi-stage Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml)

## Architecture

```
Cursor Enterprise APIs → Collector (src/lib/collector.ts) → SQLite (src/lib/db.ts)
                                                                ↓
                                                    Detection Engine (src/lib/anomaly/)
                                                                ↓
                                                    Alerts: Slack + Email (src/lib/alerts/)
                                                                ↓
                                                    Dashboard (src/app/ pages)
```

Two CLI entry points:
- `npm run collect` — fetch data from Cursor APIs into SQLite
- `npm run detect` — run anomaly detection + alerting on stored data

Single cron endpoint `POST /api/cron` does both: collect → detect → alert in one call.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/types.ts` | All shared types + DetectionConfig + DEFAULT_CONFIG |
| `src/lib/cursor-client.ts` | Cursor API client (Admin + Analytics), pagination, rate-limit retry |
| `src/lib/db.ts` | SQLite schema, all queries, dashboard stats, analytics, user stats |
| `src/lib/collector.ts` | Data collection pipeline (members, daily usage, spending, events, analytics, groups) |
| `src/lib/anomaly/detector.ts` | Orchestrator — runs all 3 detection layers, deduplicates |
| `src/lib/anomaly/thresholds.ts` | Layer 1: static limits (spend, requests, tokens) |
| `src/lib/anomaly/zscore.ts` | Layer 2: statistical z-score on daily spend vs active team mean |
| `src/lib/anomaly/trends.ts` | Layer 3: daily spend spikes, cycle spend outliers |
| `src/lib/incidents.ts` | Incident lifecycle: create, alert, acknowledge, resolve + MTTD/MTTI/MTTR |
| `src/lib/alerts/slack.ts` | Slack bot token + chat.postMessage with block-kit messages |
| `src/lib/alerts/email.ts` | Email alerts via Resend with HTML templates |
| `src/lib/date-utils.ts` | Date formatting helpers (formatDateShort, formatDateTick, formatDateLabel) |
| `src/lib/format-utils.ts` | Model name shortening (MODEL_MAP regex → short labels) |
| `src/app/api/cron/route.ts` | Main cron endpoint (collect + detect + alert) |
| `src/app/api/groups/import/route.ts` | HiBob CSV import: parse, preview changes, apply selectively |

## Dashboard Pages

- `/` — Team overview: stat cards, model cost comparison table ($/request relative multipliers), daily spend trend (sourced from `usage_events` with `daily_spend` fallback, last 2 days marked provisional), spend breakdown by user, members table with search/sort, **group filter dropdown**, time range picker (24h/3d/7d/14d/30d), billing cycle progress
- `/insights` — Analytics: DAU chart, model adoption, model efficiency rankings, repository code volume (lines, % of total, AI %), MCP tool usage, file extensions, client versions
- `/users/[email]` — Per-user detail: KPI cards (cycle spend, $/req, agent reqs, diffs accepted, team rank), spend trend chart, AI adoption card (tier, score bar, stat pills with tooltips), cost breakdown by model, tools & features (MCP tools + commands per user), repositories (top 15 by lines, % of total, AI %), model preferences, daily activity table, anomaly history
- `/anomalies` — MTTD/MTTI/MTTR metrics, open incidents (acknowledge/resolve), anomaly table
- `/settings` — Detection thresholds, **billing group management** (rename, assign, create), **HiBob CSV import** with change preview
