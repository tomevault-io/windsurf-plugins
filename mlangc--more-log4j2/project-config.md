# Guidance to agentic coding tools when working with code in this repository

## Project Overview

A collection of advanced plugins for Apache Log4j2: filters, appenders, and testing utilities. Published to Maven Central as `com.github.mlangc:more-log4j2`. Requires Java 17+.

## Build Commands

Uses Maven Wrapper — prefer `./mvnw` over `mvn`:

```bash
# Build and test all modules
./mvnw -B package

# Run all tests
./mvnw test

# Run a single test class (use -pl to avoid failure in modules that don't have the test)
./mvnw -Dtest=ClassName test -pl core -am

# Mutation testing (PIT) — always run selectively; full suite can take 30+ minutes.
# Requires compiled classes first. Use -DtargetClasses with a glob to scope to one class or package:
./mvnw test-compile -pl core -am -q && ./mvnw org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage -pl core -am -DtargetClasses='com.github.mlangc.more.log4j2.filters.ThrottlingFilter'

# Update license headers
./mvnw org.codehaus.mojo:license-maven-plugin:update-file-header
```

JaCoCo code coverage runs automatically with `./mvnw test`.

## Module Structure

- **`core/`** — All filters, appenders, and the LogCaptor API
- **`junit/`** — `AsyncHttpAppenderFlushingTestExecutionListener` for test integration
- **`parent/`** — Shared POM configuration and dependency versions
- **`bom/`** — Bill of Materials for consumers using multiple modules

## Architecture

### Plugin System

All components use Log4j2's `@Plugin` annotation and are auto-discovered via the Log4j2 plugin annotation processor. Filters extend `AbstractFilter`; appenders extend `AbstractAppender`. Configuration maps to XML element names via `@Plugin(name=...)`.

### AsyncHttpAppender

See [README.MD](README.MD) for the full configuration reference and architecture diagram.
The key implementation detail to be aware of when reading the code: batch draining is
intentionally **single-threaded** (one drainer thread using the async `HttpClient` API), so
any logic that touches the drain path must not block.

**`currentBatchBytes` accounting**: tracks the exact serialized size of the in-progress batch
(prefix + events + only those separators that `createBatchAssumingLocked` would actually write
under the configured `batchSeparatorInsertionStrategy`). The `append` paths and
`needsFlushAssumeLocked` consult `needSeparatorAssumeLocked` so the accounting and the
flush-fits-check both match `createBatchAssumingLocked`'s layout exactly under both `ALWAYS`
and `IF_MISSING`.

**Linger anchor**: `firstRecordNanos` and `scheduledFlush` are reset together via
`rescheduleFlushAssumeLocked` — call it from any new code path that empties `currentBatch`
and lets a new batch start.
Do not null `scheduledFlush` on task completion — only the shutdown path does. A stale fire
nulling a freshly-rescheduled future would defeat the next `cancel(false)`.

**`drainBufferedBatches` runs under the lock**: the method body is wrapped in `doWithLock`, but
the HTTP calls are submitted as `CompletableFuture`s and complete outside the lock. The
`whenComplete` callback re-acquires the lock explicitly when it needs to update shared state.

### Filters

See [README.MD](README.MD) for full configuration reference and usage examples.

- **ThrottlingFilter** — Rate-limits log events. The `level` attribute is easy to misread: events *at or
  less specific* than the configured level (e.g. WARN/INFO/DEBUG/TRACE when `level=WARN`)
  are counted against the limit; events *more specific* (e.g. ERROR/FATAL when `level=WARN`)
  bypass the throttle entirely and always return `onMatch`. This matches `BurstFilter`
  semantics. Performance-sensitive; JMH benchmarks live under `src/test/java/.../benchmarks/`.
- **RoutingFilter** — `getOnMatch()`/`getOnMismatch()` return `NEUTRAL`; routing decisions are delegated to each route's own filter.
- **AcceptAllFilter / NeutralFilter** — Always return `ACCEPT`/`NEUTRAL`; complement the
  mainline `DenyAllFilter`.

### Plugin factory conventions

`@PluginFactory` methods follow these conventions:

- **Optional attributes** with a sensible default (e.g. `onMatch`, `level`) receive an explicit null-fallback inline: `onMatch == null ? Result.NEUTRAL : onMatch`.
- **Mandatory attributes** (e.g. `interval`, `timeUnit`, `maxEvents`) are *not* null-checked. If a caller omits them, the resulting NPE — surfaced by Log4j2 via its status logger — is considered descriptive enough. Adding custom validation would be noise without diagnostic value.

### LogCaptor API

Captures log events in tests. See [README.MD](README.MD) for usage examples.

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests use XML log4j2 configuration files under `core/src/test/resources/` — there are 70+ such files
- WireMock 3.x for HTTP integration tests (AsyncHttpAppender)
- JMH benchmarks in `src/test/java/.../benchmarks/` for performance-sensitive filters

**AssertJ + `Configuration.getAppender()`**: the method's unconstrained generic return type
(`<T extends Appender> T`) creates an ambiguous overload for AssertJ's `assertThat()`.
Always cast explicitly: `assertThat((Appender) config.getAppender("name"))`.
