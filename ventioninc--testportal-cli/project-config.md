# AI Development Guidelines

This project is a Node.js CLI and TypeScript library for converting test reports
into unified format.

## Setup

- Requires **Node.js v18** or newer.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Development

- Source files are in `src/` and tests are in `tests/`.
- Use `npm run build` to compile TypeScript to `dist/`.
- Use `npm run new:file -- <path>` when creating a new supported source file so the standard Apache 2.0 header is added automatically.
- Use `npm run headers:add` to backfill the Apache 2.0 header across supported files in `src` and `tests`.
- Prefer the existing path aliases such as `@/core/*`, `@/providers/*`,
  `@/types/*`, and `@/utils/*` where they improve clarity.
- Keep strict TypeScript compatibility. Avoid introducing new `any` usage unless
  there is a clear reason, but note that some existing code still uses `any`.
- Types are often defined in `src/types/`, but some helper and implementation
  types are intentionally colocated with the code that uses them.
- Organize imports consistently with the surrounding file style rather than
  assuming a globally enforced import-order rule.
- This repository is licensed under Apache 2.0. Supported source files in `src`
  and `tests` should carry:
  - `// Copyright 2026 VENSOLUTIONSGROUP LTD`
  - `// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`

## Verification

- Before committing, run `npm run format`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
- Treat `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` as required validation steps, not
  optional extras.

## Contributing

- When adding a new provider, register it in `src/core/provider-registry.ts` and
  include accompanying tests under `tests/`.
- Update documentation in `README.md` and `docs/` when functionality changes.
- Do not commit generated files such as `dist/` or `node_modules/`.
- Use `npm run new:file -- <path>` when creating a new supported source file so
  the standard Apache 2.0 header is applied automatically.
- Use `npm run headers:add` when you need to backfill the standard header across
  existing supported files in `src` and `tests`.

## Commit Guidance

- Follow clear commit messages summarizing your change.
- Keep pull requests focused and include relevant tests and documentation.

## Releasing

The release process is automated via GitHub Actions triggered by tags. See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for the full release flow.
