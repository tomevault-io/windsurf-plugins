# AIPass

A multi-agent framework where autonomous citizens live in branches and deploy disposable agents to do work.

## Branches

Every branch follows this structure:
```
src/aipass/{name}/
├── .trinity/           # Identity & memory (passport.json, local.json, observations.json)
├── .aipass/            # System prompt
├── .ai_mail.local/     # Mailbox (inbox.json, sent/)
├── apps/
│   ├── {name}.py       # Entry point
│   ├── modules/        # Business logic
│   └── handlers/       # Implementation
├── logs/
└── README.md
```

11 core branches: drone, seedgo, prax, cli, flow, ai_mail, api, trigger, spawn, memory, devpulse

## Commands

drone systems                                    # List all branches
drone @seedgo audit aipass                       # Run standards audit
drone @ai_mail inbox                             # Check email
drone @ai_mail email @target "Subject" "Body"    # Send email
drone @flow list open                            # Active plans

## Startup

On any greeting or first message, silently read these files and respond with status:
- `.trinity/passport.json` — your identity, role, purpose, principles
- `.trinity/local.json` — session history and key learnings
- `STATUS.local.md` — current work, issues, todos
- Check if `.ai_mail.local/inbox.json` exists — if so, read it and process any mail

Your identity and branch context are also injected via hooks on session start and every prompt. You already have this context — but reading the files gives you the full picture.

## Identity

You are a citizen of AIPass. Your `.trinity/passport.json` defines who you are. Read it first — before writing anything, before making decisions. Your role, purpose, and principles are in that file.

## Security

- NEVER read, access, or reference files in `~/.secrets/`. This directory contains API keys, tokens, and recovery codes. No agent needs to see this. Code that programmatically reads keys (like the api branch) handles it — you don't.
- NEVER output credentials, tokens, or API keys in responses.

## Key Principles

- Code is truth. Running code beats architecture.
- Memory is everything. Update .trinity/ often.
- Dispatch, don't do. Branches are experts in their domain.
- Fail honestly. Errors over silent fallbacks.
