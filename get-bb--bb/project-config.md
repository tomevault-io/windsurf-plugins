# Codebase Guidelines

## Simplicity First

- When renaming a domain concept, search project-wide for stale names in variables, files, query keys, constants, tests, and docs. TypeScript only catches type references.

## Types And Contracts

- Validate and parse data at system boundaries, then pass typed values internally.
- Avoid `unknown` and `as X` casts inside the system. Use them only at genuinely unknowable boundaries such as freeform tool input, then narrow immediately.
- Keep one-off types near the code that uses them. Move types to a shared package only for a real cross-package contract.
- Optional contract fields are allowed only when omission has real semantic meaning. Do not use optional or nullable fields to hide defaults.
- If a field has a default, fill it in once at the server boundary and pass the explicit value through internal routes, commands, and persisted events.
- Accepted-but-ignored route or command fields are forbidden. Delete them or implement them end to end.
- Add or update route and command documentation only when behavior is non-obvious.

## Server And Daemon

- The server owns product policy: defaults, instructions, manager behavior, tool lists, and thread behavior.
- The host daemon owns host-local primitives, provider translation, runtime/session management, and workspace execution.
- If the server needs host-local data, the daemon should return raw data and the server should assemble product behavior.
- Do not move responsibility across the server/daemon boundary unless the current change requires it.
- **Always increment `HOST_DAEMON_PROTOCOL_VERSION` when a change can alter anything sent between the server and host daemon.** This includes adding, removing, renaming, or changing the type, requiredness, default, or meaning of fields in session payloads, WebSocket messages, host RPC commands, or host RPC results. A shared TypeScript build passing is not evidence of wire compatibility: enrolled machines can still be running an older daemon. The version mismatch is what triggers their automatic update; without a bump, an old daemon may connect successfully and then enter an `invalid-message` reconnect loop. If compatibility with the previously shipped daemon has not been deliberately preserved and tested, bump the version.

## CLI, Guide, And Skill

- When you add or change a `bb` CLI command, flag, or a user-facing configuration knob (env var, `.bb/` workspace file, settings field), update its discoverable surfaces in the same change. See [docs/cli-guide-and-skill.md](docs/cli-guide-and-skill.md) for which surfaces to update.
- Every end-user feature must also be usable by agents through both the SDK and the `bb` CLI; ship and document those surfaces in the same change as the UI.

## Plugin API

- Any new public plugin API member (a `@bb/plugin-sdk/app` export, an `app.slots.*` method, or a `BbPluginApi` property) ships with an `experimental_` name prefix and an entry in [docs/api_to_audit.md](docs/api_to_audit.md) describing what it does and what to audit before stabilizing. Dropping the prefix is the deliberate stabilization step: audit the entry, rename project-wide, and remove it from the doc in the same change.

## Data Access

- Do not load all rows and filter in JavaScript when a targeted query with `WHERE` or `JOIN` is possible.
- Add indexes only when they are required by the new or changed query.
- Do not manually edit Drizzle snapshot JSON. Change the schema, then regenerate migrations/snapshots with Drizzle so the snapshot chain stays consistent.
- Never mock the database in tests. Use in-memory SQLite via `createConnection(":memory:")` plus `migrate(db)`.

## UI

- Prefer sanctioned typography tokens over arbitrary `text-[Npx]` classes.
- Derive theme color tokens from the `--canvas`/`--ink` anchors (`color-mix(in oklch, var(--ink) N%, var(--canvas))`) or from another derived token — never hand-set an `oklch(L 0 0)` literal. Achromatic literals don't follow custom palettes (Nord, Dracula, …), which re-anchor only `--canvas`/`--ink`, so a hardcoded token strands a neutral-gray element in an otherwise tinted UI. Mix opaque steps `in oklch`; mix translucent steps (a `transparent` pole) `in oklab` so the hue survives. `apps/app/src/components/ui/theme.css` is the source of truth and `theme.test.ts` guards it.

## Build And Typecheck

- Always use Turbo when building and typechecking: `pnpm exec turbo run <task> --filter=@bb/<pkg>`. Turbo ensures upstream `^build` dependencies run first.
- Typecheck with `pnpm exec turbo run typecheck --filter=@bb/<pkg>`.
- Do not run package scripts directly, such as `pnpm --filter @bb/foo test`, or raw `npx tsc --noEmit` unless you are deliberately bypassing repo orchestration for investigation.

## Testing

- Only write high quality tests that verify where there could be potential bugs. Avoid testing trivial getters/setters, framework wiring, or other code that is unlikely to break.
- Pipe slow test output to a file, then read the file. Example: `pnpm exec turbo run test --filter=@bb/integration-tests --force > /tmp/test-out.txt 2>&1`.
