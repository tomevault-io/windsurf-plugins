# FunctAI: working in this repository

FunctAI is typed functions whose body is a language model call, in several
languages that agree through one contract. Python, TypeScript, R and
Julia exist. The plan is `design/01-many-languages.md`; read it
before adding a language or changing the contract.

## The map

| Path | What it is | Who it answers to |
|---|---|---|
| `contract/` | formats, JSON Schemas and cases every implementation must pass | nothing: it is the authority |
| `python/` | the Python package (`functai` on PyPI), self-contained: pyproject, uv.lock, .venv, tests, examples, README (PyPI's page), CHANGELOG | `contract/` |
| `ts/` | the TypeScript package (`functai` on npm, not published yet): src, tests, tools, README, CHANGELOG. `src/generated/contract.ts` is the contract's data, written by `node tools/generate.ts` | `contract/` |
| `docs/` | the website: MRMD notebooks with their outputs, each pinned to `python/` as its rat project. `index.md` the four-language home, `python.md` Python's landing; `docs/tutorials/` the Python tutorials, `docs/r/` the R ones (```r cells, outputs written by `r/tutorials`), `docs/julia/` the Julia ones (```julia cells, outputs written by `julia/tutorials`; also the tutorials of the Julia manual); `docs/ts/index.md` and every language's `news.md` are generated from the READMEs and changelogs (`tools/docs.py generate`); plots in `docs/_assets/generated/` | the code they show |
| `r/` | the R package (`functai`, not on CRAN): R, tests, data, README, NEWS. `inst/contract/` is the contract's data, copied by `r/check`; `tools/env.nix` is its R on NixOS | `contract/` |
| `julia/` | the Julia package (`FunctAI`, not registered): src, ext (StatsModels, CategoricalArrays), test, tools, docs (the Documenter manual, and the environment `julia/tutorials` runs in), README, CHANGELOG. `data/contract/` is the contract's data, copied by `julia/check`; lmcc and lm15 come from their checkouts (`Project.toml` `[sources]`) | `contract/` |
| `tools/docs.py` | generates reference/example/news pages, runs notebooks on rat, builds each language's manual (TypeDoc, pkgdown, Documenter) and the site | |
| `.github/workflows/docs.yml` | the website on GitHub Pages: the site and the three manuals, built in parallel on every push to master, placed as `tools/docs.py site` places them | |
| `tools/crosslang.py` | Python, TypeScript, R and Julia against each other: saved in Python, loaded in the others; one call log | `contract/` |
| `design/` | numbered design notes | |
| `check` | the one command: the contract, then every implementation | |

Rules:

- A language folder never imports from another. They meet in `contract/`.
- When code and contract disagree, the code is wrong. To change a rule,
  change the contract first (a new format number when the meaning of
  existing data changes), then every implementation, in the same commit.
- Contract cases are written by scripts from the rules (`contract/cases/make.py`),
  never copied from an implementation's output. Data every language must
  reproduce (layouts, the model table, case folding) lives in the contract
  as JSON; each implementation carries a copy and a test that it is equal.
- Each language keeps its own version, changelog and release tag prefix
  (`python-v1.1.0`, `ts-v…`, `r-v…`, `julia-v…`).

## Commands

```bash
./check                                         # everything; green before any commit
cd python && uv sync --all-extras --all-groups  # the Python environment (python/.venv)
cd python && .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q      # Python tests only (offline, a fake provider)
python/.venv/bin/python tools/docs.py generate  # reference, examples, news pages
python/.venv/bin/python tools/docs.py run [PAGE ...]   # run notebooks (needs model keys; costs cents)
python/.venv/bin/python tools/docs.py manuals   # TypeScript's, R's and Julia's manuals (after r/check)
python/.venv/bin/python tools/docs.py site      # build the website into site/, with the manuals built so far
cd ts && npm install && npm test                # TypeScript (needs ../lmcc checked out: lmcc is not on npm yet)
cd ts && node tools/generate.ts                 # after changing contract/layouts, models.json or unicode/
r/check                                         # R (needs ../lmcc and ../lm15-dev checked out; R from nixpkgs if not on PATH)
julia/check                                     # Julia (needs ../lmcc and ../lm15-dev checked out; Julia from nixpkgs if not on PATH)
julia/tutorials [docs/julia/0N-*.md ...]        # run the Julia tutorials in fresh sessions, write their outputs (real models; about 60 cents for all eight)
julia --project=julia/docs julia/docs/make.jl   # the Julia manual (Documenter) into julia/docs/build; runs no model
r/tutorials [docs/r/0N-*.md ...]                # run the R tutorials in fresh sessions, write their outputs (real models; about 40 cents for all eight)
python/.venv/bin/python contract/cases/make.py  # after changing a rule: rewrite the cases
```

Live runs (real models, costs cents): `cd python && .venv/bin/python
tests/live.py`; `cd ts && node --conditions=functai-source
--conditions=lmcc-source tools/live.ts`; `R_LIBS=r/.lib Rscript r/tools/live.R`; `julia --project=julia
julia/tools/live.jl`.
