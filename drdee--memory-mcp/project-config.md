# Cursor Rules for Python 3.13 Projects

## Python Version and Environment
- Use Python 3.13+ features where appropriate
- Utilize uv for dependency management
- Always pin exact package versions in requirements files
- Use virtual environments for all development

## Type Annotations and Type Safety
- Add complete type annotations to all functions and methods
- Use the `typing` module and modern typing features (e.g., `TypedDict`, `Protocol`, Union types with `|`)
- Leverage structural typing with `Protocol` when appropriate
- Validate type correctness with mypy in strict mode
- Use `Annotated` for metadata on types when needed

## Code Structure and Organization
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for code formatting
- Use black for consistent code formatting
- Organize code into logical modules and packages
- Keep functions and methods focused and short (aim for < 30 lines)
- Use docstrings for all modules, classes, methods, and functions
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible

## Modern Python Patterns
- Use dataclasses or Pydantic models for data containers
- Utilize context managers (`with` statements) for resource management
- Leverage async/await syntax for asynchronous operations
- Use pathlib for file system operations instead of os.path
- Prefer list/dict comprehensions over loops for simple transformations
- Use generator expressions for large data processing

## Error Handling
- Use specific exception types rather than catching Exception
- Create custom exception classes for application-specific errors
- Add context to exceptions with Python 3.11+ exception groups when appropriate
- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level of abstraction
- Use try/except/else/finally blocks appropriately

## Dependency Management
- Use uv for installing and managing dependencies
- Maintain requirements.txt or pyproject.toml with specific versions
- Regularly update dependencies for security and features
- Use optional dependency groups for development/testing requirements
- Document why each dependency is needed in comments

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- Write pytest-based tests for all functionality
- Aim for 90%+ code coverage
- Use fixtures and parametrization in tests
- Include integration tests alongside unit tests
- Use property-based testing for complex algorithms
- Add type checking to CI pipeline

## Performance Considerations
- Profile code before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures for operations
- Consider memory usage for large data operations
- Use generator expressions for processing large datasets
- Leverage multi-processing for CPU-bound tasks
- Use asyncio for I/O-bound operations

## Security Best Practices
- Never hardcode secrets in source code
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for secrets
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid security vulnerabilities
- Document security considerations in comments

## Documentation
- Use Google-style or NumPy-style docstrings consistently
- Include type information in docstrings (in addition to annotations)
- Document exceptions that may be raised
- Add examples in docstrings for complex functions
- Keep documentation updated with code changes
- Generate API documentation automatically

## Project Structure
- Use a standardized project structure
- Include setup.py or pyproject.toml configuration
- Maintain a comprehensive README.md
- Add a CHANGELOG.md to track changes
- Include contribution guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Create a standard directory structure (src/, tests/, docs/)
