# Decomp Academy — frontend

A Next.js app that teaches decompiling GameCube PowerPC assembly back into
matching C. Lessons live as Markdown under `src/curriculum/` and are compiled to
JSON by `scripts/build-curriculum.mjs` (runs on `predev`/`prebuild`).

## Authoring exercise lessons

Each exercise lesson is `src/curriculum/<NN>-<tier>/<NN>-<chapter>/<NNN>-<slug>.md`:
YAML frontmatter, a prose body, a `<!-- starter -->` ```c block, and a
`<!-- solution -->` ```c block. The app shows the learner the target assembly (in
the diff view) and they write C that compiles to it.

When writing or editing an exercise, these rules are **mandatory**:

- **Never reveal the answer.** The C solution — or any trivially copyable form of
  it — must not appear in the prose description or the `## Your task` line. The
  learner derives the C from the technique you teach plus the target assembly.
  (e.g. do NOT write "`a + b - c` is two operations"; teach what the instructions
  do and let them work it out.)
- **Always use a different worked example** than the exercise's own function —
  different operands / constants / registers — so the learner transfers the idea
  instead of copying it. Never walk through the exact solution.
- **Any assembly shown must be real compiler output.** Compile the example with the
  MWCC GC/2.0 toolchain and paste its actual disassembly; never invent or
  hand-write assembly.
- **The `## Your task` line points at the assembly to reproduce** (e.g. "Write
  `foo`, taking three `int`s, to reproduce the assembly above."), never the C.
- When editing an existing lesson, change **only the prose body** — keep the
  frontmatter `id`/`symbol`/`context`, the starter block, and the solution block
  byte-identical.

### Compiling to verify assembly

```
WIBO=/Users/jackpriceburns/Code/sfa/build/tools/wibo
MWCC=/Users/jackpriceburns/Code/sfa/build/compilers/GC/2.0/mwcceppc.exe
OBJDUMP=/Users/jackpriceburns/Code/sfa/build/binutils/powerpc-eabi-objdump
FLAGS="-nodefaults -proc gekko -align powerpc -enum int -fp hardware -Cpp_exceptions off -O4,p -inline auto -maxerrors 1 -nosyspath -RTTI off -fp_contract on -lang=c"
# write the function to /tmp/x.c (types s8/u8/s16/u16/s32/u32/s64/u64/f32/f64/BOOL
# are available via a shared preamble; NO #include), then:
cd /Users/jackpriceburns/Code/sfa && "$WIBO" "$MWCC" $FLAGS -c /tmp/x.c -o /tmp/x.o && "$OBJDUMP" -M gekko -drz /tmp/x.o
```

Verify every reference solution still compiles after curriculum changes by
running the dev/prod server and hitting `GET /api/admin/verify-all` (compiles
each lesson's reference solution and reports failures).
