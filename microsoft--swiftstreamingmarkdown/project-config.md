# Agent Instructions for SwiftStreamingMarkdown

> **Trust these instructions first.** Only search the repository if information here is incomplete or wrong.

## Project Overview

SwiftStreamingMarkdown is a Swift Package that renders **Markdown** in SwiftUI. It is consumed by Apple-platform apps that need to display Markdown content, either bespoke or incrementally produced by an LLM or other streaming source. The package is iOS-first, distributed via **Swift Package Manager only**, and ships with a sample app under `Examples/`.

**Key technologies:**

| Topic | Value |
|---|---|
| Language | Swift |
| UI | SwiftUI (some UIKit interop under `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/UIKit/`) |
| swift-tools-version | 5.9 |
| Minimum Xcode | **16.0** (the package contains `@available(iOS 18.0, *)` annotations that require the iOS 18 SDK) |
| Minimum iOS deployment | iOS 16 |
| Build system | Swift Package Manager (no Bazel, no CocoaPods) |
| Linter | SwiftLint (config: `.swiftlint.yml`, run via `swiftlint --strict`) |

## Architecture

The major components of this library are parsing and rendering. They are highly isolated to make sure code is executed on the right threads and is easy to contribute to.

### Preprocess

Perform text-level processing before sending it to the markdown parser, if needed. The library uses it to recognize math syntax and convert it to a format the markdown parser understands. This works in most cases but is not ideal — it's on the roadmap to include math parsing as part of the markdown parsing itself.

### Parse

This is based on Apple's open-source parser from [swift-markdown](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-markdown), which is backed by [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-cmark).

### Rewrite

Perform markdown AST-level manipulation before passing the result to the UI layer. The library uses this to speculatively close half-typed emphasis — for example, a streaming chunk `Yeah, this is *cool` gets rewritten to render as if it were `Yeah, this is **cool**`, so the text doesn't jitter back and forth as the rest of the token streams in.

### Pre-Render

This step converts the markdown AST (`Document`) into a `RenderableDocument` for rendering. It translates markdown styles into Apple's language, mainly around `NSAttributedString`, `NSTextAttachment`, etc.

### Render

The `RenderableDocument` is then passed to the SwiftUI/UIKit layer to render on iOS devices. Most of the UI components are written in SwiftUI except for paragraphs. We chose UIKit's `UITextView` to render paragraphs to ensure the library can support streamed markdown with fine-grained animation control and high performance.

## Working Principles

Behavioral guidelines for agents (and humans) working in this repo. These bias toward caution over speed; for trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think before coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop, name what's confusing, and ask.

### 2. Simplicity first

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
