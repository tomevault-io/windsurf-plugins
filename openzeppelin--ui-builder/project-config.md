# Research Guidelines (Exa + Ref MCP)

This rule outlines how to use Exa and Ref for research. It emphasizes starting with Exa for code-context and only moving to Ref for documentation verification when needed.

## Priority Order

1. Prefer Exa overall. Within Exa, call `get_code_context_exa` first for code-aware context.
2. Use `web_search_exa` only if `get_code_context_exa` does not surface useful results.
3. Use Ref only when explicitly requested by the user, results from Exa contradict each other, or after two unsuccessful attempts to fix an external API/library where documentation changes are suspected due to model cut-off.

## Ref Usage Rules

- Use only `ref_search_documentation` for Ref lookups.
- Never use `search_docs` or `my_docs`.
- Use `ref_read_url` to read primary docs pages (documentation sites, quickstarts, or specific API pages) when:
  - The user requests specific docs/quickstart pages, or
  - They would materially clarify/validate details found via Exa.

## Operational Flow

1. Start with Exa → `get_code_context_exa` using a precise, code-oriented query.
2. If insufficient, try Exa → `web_search_exa` for targeted top sources.
3. If integration still fails, asks for official docs:
   - Switch to Ref → `ref_search_documentation` with specific library/framework and version when known.
   - Open selected sources with Ref → `ref_read_url` to extract authoritative details.
4. When code changes depend on docs, annotate critical links and versions in comments.

## Notes

- Keep queries specific and focused; prefer several small, targeted queries over one broad query
- Use Ref sparingly; it is for authoritative verification or when documentation drift is suspected
