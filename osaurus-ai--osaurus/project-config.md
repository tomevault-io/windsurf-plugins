description: When to run tests — full suite only before PR submission, targeted tests during development
---


# Testing Workflow

The full unit suite (`make test`, ~5000 tests) takes about 30 minutes. Do NOT
run it during normal development iterations.

## During development

- Run only targeted tests scoped to what you changed, using `--filter`:

```bash
OSAURUS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN_FOR_TESTS=1 \
OSAURUS_TEST_ROOT=/tmp/osaurus-test \
OSU_MODELS_DIR=/tmp/osaurus-test-models \
swift test --package-path Packages/OsaurusCore --filter "SuiteOrTestName"
```

- A plain `swift build --package-path Packages/OsaurusCore` is enough to
  verify compilation after edits.

## Before submitting a PR

- Run the full suite exactly once, right before the PR is created:

```bash
OSAURUS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN_FOR_TESTS=1 \
OSAURUS_TEST_ROOT=/tmp/osaurus-test \
OSU_MODELS_DIR=/tmp/osaurus-test-models \
make test
```

- Keychain-gated suites (e.g. `PluginAgentScopingTests`) fail by design under
  `OSAURUS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN_FOR_TESTS=1`; run those without the flag when
  their area was touched.
