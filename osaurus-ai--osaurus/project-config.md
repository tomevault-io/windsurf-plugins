# Codex Configuration - osaurus-staging

See `~/AGENTS.md` for the global Codex environment, wiki protocol, hard rules,
machine context, and useful commands.

## Build & Test

Running tests and builds is encouraged — they're how we keep quality high. The
canonical lanes live in `Makefile`:

- `make test` — `swift test --package-path Packages/OsaurusCore` (fast unit
  loop).
- `make ci-test` — mirrors the CI `test-core` xcodebuild job (`xcbeautify`
  output, xcresult bundle at `build/Tests.xcresult`).
- `make cli` / `make app` — build the CLI and the embedded app via
  `xcodebuild` against `osaurus.xcworkspace`.
- `make evals` / `make evals-all` — run OsaurusEvals suites under
  `Packages/OsaurusEvals/Suites/*`.
- Live-app smoke: `scripts/live-proof/launch-keychain-free-osaurus.sh`.

### Keychain tip (optional)

Some tests touch Osaurus Keychain wrappers. If a test doesn't need real
Keychain access, prefer running it in keychain-disabled mode to avoid
unrelated "wants to use your confidential information" prompts:

```bash
OSAURUS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN_FOR_TESTS=1 \
OSAURUS_TEST_ROOT=/tmp/osaurus-test \
OSU_MODELS_DIR=/tmp/osaurus-test-models \
make test
```

In that mode, Keychain wrappers should return nil / no-op on reads, writes,
and deletes rather than calling `SecItemCopyMatching` / `SecItemAdd` /
`SecItemUpdate` / `SecItemDelete` against the login Keychain.

`OSU_MODELS_DIR` (pointed at an empty dir) matters on machines with real
models in `~/MLXModels`: dispatch-style tests start real `ChatSession.send`
turns, and without the override they resolve the user's installed models and
try to load them inside the SwiftPM harness — which has no Metal kernels and
dies with `MLX/MLXArray.swift precondition failed`. With the override those
sends fail fast with `modelUnavailable`, matching CI behavior. Keychain-gated
suites (e.g. `PluginAgentScopingTests`) still fail by design under
`OSAURUS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN_FOR_TESTS=1`; run those without the flag when you
need real Keychain proof.

## Model Runtime Non-Negotiables

- Never add forced thinking tags, parser repair, hidden sampler defaults,
  repetition-penalty rescues, close-token bias, or prompt/template coercion to
  make a model appear coherent.
- Never add fake guards, placeholder gates, hardcoded model allowlists,
  synthetic output filters, or "same behavior" enforcement to make a runtime
  row look safe. If JANG, JANGTQ, MXFP, VL/audio/video, hybrid cache, SWA,
  speed, coherency, leaking tool parser output, reasoning boundaries, or RAM
  policy is wrong, trace the root cause and fix the real function/path. If the
  root cause is not fixed yet, document the row as `PARTIAL` or `BLOCKED` with
  exact evidence instead of forcing behavior in prompts, parsers, samplers, or
  UI state.
- Chat/API defaults must come from the active model bundle's
  `generation_config.json` or equivalent runtime config unless a user
  explicitly overrides them. Native-trained defaults such as top-k matter for
  quality and speed; do not replace them with synthetic Osaurus defaults.
- Reasoning, tool, and chat-template behavior must be auto-detected from the
  bundle/tokenizer/template/runtime config. Do not fake thinking envelopes,
  strip visible output to hide parser bugs, or coerce one model family into
  another family's template.
- Runtime proof must separate proven, partial, failed, and unproven rows. A
  load-only result, single prompt, or source-only assertion is not enough to
  call a model family working.
- RAM proof means Activity Monitor physical footprint stays within the intended
  low-RAM gate. A row that reaches full model size in physical footprint is a
  failure even if generation is coherent.
- Every generation row must record token/s. Missing token/s is a blocked or
  failed row, not production proof.
- Multi-turn coherency is required: visible answer, reasoning channel behavior,
  no looping, no hidden reasoning-only output, no length-cap fake pass, and no
  raw parser marker leak.
- Reasoning fixes must preserve the model's real contract. Do not inject fake
  closers/openers, hide leaked reasoning markers by stripping visible text, or
  treat a parser cleanup as correctness unless the live output, structured
  reasoning field, and user-visible answer all prove the boundary is correct.
- Cache proof must match the model architecture:
  - Full-attention models need real KV, prefix/paged, L2 disk, and TurboQuant
    KV proof when enabled.
  - Qwen-style hybrid SSM needs KV plus SSM companion rederive/hit proof; a KV
    hit alone is not enough.
  - ZAYA/CCA and HY3-style models need companion cache and pooling proof.
  - DeepSeek-V4 CSA/HSA/SWA hybrid pool needs prefix/L2 plus pool restore/hit
    proof and must not use TurboQuant KV as a substitute.
- VL/video rows require real media payloads, media cache salts, and cache-hit
  validation; text-path evidence does not prove media-path correctness.
- Big-model load cancellation must be live-proven before promotion: if the user
  stops generation, closes chat, or exits during first load, startup must
  cancel and cleanup must prevent zombie loads and OOM growth.
- Qwen/JANG/JANGTQ RAM regressions require end-to-end Osaurus proof with
