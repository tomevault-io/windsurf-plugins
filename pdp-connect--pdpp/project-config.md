> Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning: read the specs and code before you edit them. The authority order is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Contributing

Policy: [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

- Sign off commits (`git commit -s`); unsigned are blocked.
- Disclose meaningful AI assistance: `Assisted-by: AI` on each assisted commit and as the final standalone PR-description line.
- Prose (PRs, issues, comments): technical, no filler, no emojis. What changed and why, briefly.
- Reject verbose summaries. Concise unless the change is a refactor, break, or architecture.
- Claims about the code need a file path or a reason.
- One change per PR. Run the repo's checks first.
- Before adding, changing, consolidating, or deleting tests, read [the testing policy](./docs/reference/testing-policy.md); executable suite ownership lives in [test-accounting.manifest.json](./test-accounting.manifest.json).
