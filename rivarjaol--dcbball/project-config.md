# DSC Hoops - AGENTS.md

## What This Project Is

Marketing and registration site for **DSC Hoops** and the **Workhouse Warrior Summer 2026** program.

The live site is now the approved React/Vite redesign. The root route `/` and `/summer` both render the summer registration experience. The old static HTML summer page has been removed from the deployed site.

**Live:** https://rivarjaol.github.io/dcbball/
**Repo:** https://github.com/rivarjaOL/dcbball (note the capital `OL` in the org slug)

The old redesign preview repo, `ClariSortAi/dcball-preview`, was the prototype source. The production source now lives in this repo.

## How to Run Locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8080/
http://localhost:8080/summer
```

The Vite config uses port `8080` by default. If that port is busy, run:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173
```

Build production output:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run checks:

```bash
npm run test
npm run lint
```

Current lint status may include shadcn fast-refresh warnings in `src/components/ui/*`; these are warnings, not build blockers.

---

## Deployment

- **Trigger:** push to `main`
- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Pipeline:** checkout, setup Node, `npm ci`, `npm run build`, copy `dist/index.html` to both `dist/404.html` and `dist/summer/index.html`, upload `dist` to GitHub Pages
- **Vite base path:** production builds use `/dcbball/` in `vite.config.ts`
- **SPA routes:** `dist/summer/index.html` serves `/summer` with HTTP 200, and `404.html` remains as a fallback
- **No env vars or secrets are required**

## Registration And Intake Wiring

The live site uses an in-page React intake flow in `src/components/RegistrationPacket.tsx`.

Flow:

```text
Website registration packet
  -> Google Forms formResponse endpoint
  -> Google Form response Sheet
  -> Apps Script spreadsheet submit trigger
  -> email notification
```

Important URLs:

- **Summer Google Form public URL:** `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tIES8Y_c-Fp957NolfjGFlnlwN67uKyyzPD_ONJNnj8/viewform`
- **Summer Google Form endpoint used by the React intake:** `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScf7b9ChwsWEaoNOaeRpKzCMW6LctFmk-TXeEe1Z5McnMx2iQ/formResponse`
- **Responses sheet:** `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-_MBTiupAFNOcXvkDpn_FfNhiqAwZoNqULoPw4QFu5o/`
- **Notification emails:** `hoops@dscinternationalgroup.com` (to), `jason.t.rivard@gmail.com` (cc)

The site does **not** write directly to Google Sheets. It submits to the same Google Form that writes to the Sheet. This is what allows the same Apps Script spreadsheet trigger to fire.

The registration packet maps 1-to-1 to the current summer Google Form entry IDs. If the Google Form fields change, update `buildGooglePayload()` in `src/components/RegistrationPacket.tsx` and revalidate the public form metadata before deploying.

The Apps Script still relies on the exact response column header `"Athlete's Name"` when building the email subject.

## Design System

The redesign uses a brutalist basketball training style:

- Bone background, ink typography, orange action color
- Large condensed display type through the `Anton` font
- Monospace utility labels through `Chakra Petch`
- Tailwind custom tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/index.css`
