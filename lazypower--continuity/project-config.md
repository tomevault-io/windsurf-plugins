# Continuity

Persistent memory for AI coding agents. Single Go binary, zero dependencies.

## Memory Instructions (IMPORTANT)

**Do NOT write to MEMORY.md or the auto-memory directory.** This project has its own memory system. Use `continuity remember` to store memories and `continuity search` to retrieve them. The server injects full tool instructions at session start.

**Tier character limits — content beyond these is hard-truncated:**
- **L0 (`-s`)**: Max 200 characters. One sentence. Injected into every session.
- **L1 (`-b`)**: Max 2000 characters (~300 words). Primary context tier. Compress aggressively.
- **L2 (`-d`)**: Max 40000 characters. Full content, retrieved on-demand only.

**Memory is not immutable; it is accountable.** Wrong write, stale fact, captured a piece of PII you shouldn't have? Use `continuity retract <uri> --reason "..."` to mark it retracted. The memory stays in the tree as a marker but is excluded from default reads. Pass `--superseded-by <new-uri>` when you have a replacement to preserve trajectory. Operators don't run this verb — it exists for the agent to curate its own substrate. The trust contract is what governs the substrate, not architectural enforcement.

## What This Is

Continuity gives Claude Code (and eventually any AI agent) memory that persists across sessions. It captures what happened, what was learned, and how you work — then injects that context into future sessions so the agent doesn't start cold every time.

**This is a clean-room Go rewrite** of [claude-mem](../continuity/) (TypeScript/Bun). The ideas are proven — the JS ecosystem was the problem. Read `RFC.md` for the full design rationale and architecture.

## Core Concepts

- **Memory Tree**: Hierarchical memory organized as a virtual filesystem with `mem://` URIs. Not a flat vector store — a browsable tree.
- **L0/L1/L2 Tiering**: Every memory has three representations: ~100 token abstract (search surface), ~2K token overview (context injection), full content (on-demand). Agents get shape without weight.
- **6-Category Taxonomy**: profile (mergeable), preferences (mergeable), entities (immutable), events (immutable), patterns (mergeable), cases (immutable). Merge rules prevent memory corruption.
- **Relational Profiling**: Extracts *how the user works* (feedback style, autonomy level, corrections given) as a compounding profile. No other tool does this.
- **Smart Decay**: 90-day half-life without access. Retrieval boosts relevance. Stale memories fade but never disappear.
- **Signal Keywords**: "remember this", "always use X", "bug was" trigger immediate capture at user-message time, not just session end.

## Architecture

```
continuity serve       → HTTP API + background worker (goroutines)
continuity hook <evt>  → Claude Code hook handler (reads stdin JSON, writes stdout)
continuity search      → CLI memory search
continuity profile     → Show relational profile
continuity tree        → Browse memory tree
continuity import      → Migrate from claude-mem JS database
```

Single binary. SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, no CGO). Embedded vector search. `go:embed` for viewer UI.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.22+
- **Database**: SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite` — pure Go, cross-compiles everywhere
- **CLI**: `cobra` for commands
- **HTTP**: `net/http` + `chi` router
- **UI**: Svelte + Tailwind CSS + Vite → static assets embedded via `go:embed`
- **LLM**: Claude CLI `claude -p` (primary, free with Max), Ollama (local/free), Anthropic API (optional, separate billing)
- **Config**: TOML at `~/.continuity/config.toml`
- **Data**: `~/.continuity/continuity.db`

## Claude Code Integration

Continuity integrates via Claude Code's hook system. Hook scripts are one-liners:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "continuity hook start" }] }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "continuity hook submit" }] }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "continuity hook tool" }] }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "continuity hook stop" }] }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "continuity hook end" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

No bun-runner. No node. No wrapper scripts. The binary IS the hook handler.
