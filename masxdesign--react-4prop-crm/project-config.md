# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

⚠️ Important:
Never assume API request or response JSON shapes.
Confirm all field names, types, and nesting with me before using them.
If a shape isn’t clearly defined, ask first.
Consistency between frontend and backend is critical.

## Use React Hook Form for All Forms
All forms in the frontend must use React Hook Form — no useState or custom input handlers for managing form data.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development (CRM only)
npm run dev:crm

# Full development with backend services
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy

# Generate TanStack Router routes
npm run generate
```

## Architecture Overview

This is a React CRM application built with:

- **Vite** as the build tool with SSL enabled for development
- **TanStack Router** for file-based routing with type-safe navigation
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Zustand** for client-side state management (look for zustand-extras.js utility)
- **Radix UI** as the primary component library
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom utility classes
- **React Hook Form** with Yup/Zod validation

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Routing Structure**: Uses TanStack Router with file-based routing. Routes are organized with:
- `_auth` prefix for authenticated routes
- `_dashboard` for main dashboard functionality  
- `_com` for communication/messaging features
- `mag.*` routes for Magazine functionality

**Component Organization**: Components are organized by feature in `/src/components/` with:
- Individual component directories containing index.js and main component file
- UI components in `/ui/` folder (Radix-based)
- Custom UI variants in `/ui-custom/`
- Magazine components organized in dedicated subdirectories

**State Management**: 
- Server state handled by TanStack Query with queryClient configuration
- Local state uses Zustand stores (no centralized store directory found)
- Custom hooks for specific state patterns (e.g., use-sheetState.js, use-DialogModel.js)

**TanStack Router Data Preloading Pattern**:
When implementing data preloading at the route level with loading overlays:
1. Use `beforeLoad` to create query options and add them to context - this makes them available to child routes and components
2. Use `loader` to preload data using the query options from context via `context.queryClient.ensureQueryData()`
3. Components can access preloaded data immediately via useQuery with the same query key
4. Implement loading overlays at the route level to show spinner when data is refetching (page changes, etc.)
5. This pattern ensures data is preloaded, cached, and components get immediate access with proper loading states

**Data Layer**:
- API calls primarily through axios
- Custom utilities for data transformation (propertyTypesCombiner, lowerKeyObject, etc.)
- Backend integration with bizchat and db-sync services

### Magazine Module

The Magazine component is a complex feature for property listing management with:
- **AdvertiserManagement**: Handle advertiser CRUD operations and statistics
- **AgentPropertiesTable**: Display property listings with scheduling capabilities  
- **MagazineDashboard**: Overview and listing management interface
- **ScheduleManagement**: Week-based scheduling system for property listings

All Magazine components have been refactored to use a week-based scheduling system.

### Development Environment

- Development server runs on HTTPS (basic SSL plugin)
- Base path is `/crm` in development, `/new/agentab_crm` in production
- Build output goes to `../4prop-backend/web/volumes/html/seo/agentab_crm`
- Iframe support with custom transport utilities for embedded usage

### Key Utilities

- **EACH System**: Custom utilities for password generation and core functionality (EACH-core.js)
- **Data Formatters**: numberWithCommas, displaySize, displayTenure, formatBytes
- **Route Mapping**: routeSearchMapping.js for URL parameter handling
- **Form Utilities**: Custom hooks and components for form state management

When working with this codebase:
- Follow the existing component structure with index.js exports
- Use the established Radix UI + Tailwind pattern for new components
- Leverage TanStack Query for all server state operations
- Maintain the file-based routing conventions for new routes
- ES Modules throughout, no TypeScript or TDD
- Backend: Node v20, Express.js, MSSQL 2017 compatibility level 100
- when creating a ui form hook component always create a *.example.jsx to test it
- property.pid is the property ID
