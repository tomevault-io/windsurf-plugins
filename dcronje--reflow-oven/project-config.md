rule_definition:
  description: "Enforce hardware interface management and safety guidelines."

  rules:
    - All hardware interfaces must be initialized with proper error checking.
    - GPIO pins must be documented with their purpose and configuration.
    - Hardware interfaces must be protected against concurrent access.
    - All hardware operations must include timeout mechanisms.
    - Hardware interfaces must be properly closed/released when not in use.
    - Hardware errors must be logged and handled gracefully.
    - Hardware interfaces must be tested for proper operation at startup.
    - Hardware configuration must be validated against physical constraints.
    - Hardware interfaces must implement proper error recovery procedures.
    - Hardware access must be abstracted through service classes.
