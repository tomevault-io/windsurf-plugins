description: API versioning, contracts, and schema evolution rules
---


API contract rules:
- Version APIs explicitly, e.g. /api/v1/, /api/v2/.
- Never introduce breaking changes to an existing version without deprecation.
- Document breaking vs non-breaking changes clearly.
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger specs when the project supports it.

Schema evolution:
- Add new fields as optional — never remove or rename existing fields in-place.
- Use explicit migration paths when changing response shapes.
- Dataset schema changes (JSONL, JSON) must be versioned alongside code.
- When training data format changes, document the version and conversion script.

Contract expectations:
- Request and response schemas must be typed (Pydantic, TypeScript interfaces).
- Error responses must follow a consistent structure across all endpoints.
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting must use consistent query parameter conventions.
- All public endpoints must have example request/response in docs or tests.

Deprecation process:
- Mark deprecated endpoints with headers or response metadata.
- Set a removal timeline and communicate it.
- Log usage of deprecated endpoints to track migration.

Do not:
- Ship breaking API changes without versioning.
- Return different response shapes from the same endpoint based on hidden logic.
- Leave undocumented endpoints in production.
