## Approach

- Always use Context7 when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration
  steps without me having to explicitly ask.
- Think before acting. Read existing files before writing code.
- Be concise in output but thorough in reasoning.
- Prefer editing to rewriting whole files.
- Do not re-read files you have already read.
- Test your code before declaring done.
- No sycophantic openers or closing fluff.
- Keep solutions simple and direct.
- User instructions always override this file.
- For icons, fetch from Google Fonts icons in the Rounded
  style: https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.style=Rounded
