# Sprint Invocation — Skill

Single-purpose: fire the runner via the **per-pilot overlay** —
the one true entrypoint. No framework CLI surface in this skill.

Per pass-r3 finding H-1: this skill previously taught a runner CLI
path (the framework runner, invoked with config + chunk-spec files
that have since been moved out of `examples/` into the per-pilot
overlay templates dir). That was the second operator-facing path
the chunk-12b collapse didn't actually collapse. The per-pilot
overlay is the **only** operator-facing entrypoint after chunk 13.

## Operator surface — one command, three modes

```
<PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/bin/run-sprint                                  # real run, operator in seat
<PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/bin/run-sprint --dry-run --non-interactive       # wiring test
<PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/bin/run-sprint --unattended                      # unattended live
```

If the overlay is not yet installed, the operator installs it once:

```sh
# From the framework repo, with <PILOT_REPO> the absolute path of the pilot repo:
mkdir -p <PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/bin
cp templates/overlay/sprint-loop-config.template.json \
   <PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/sprint-loop-config.json
cp templates/overlay/sprint-loop-chunks-example.template.json \
   <PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/chunks.json
cp templates/overlay/bin/run-sprint \
   <PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/bin/run-sprint
chmod +x <PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/bin/run-sprint
# Then edit the config JSON: replace placeholder paths, set validators.
```

(For the scriptable version of that recipe, see
`templates/overlay/README.md`. The skill is the high-level
recap; the README is the line-by-line install.)

## Flag semantics — what the overlay forwards

- `--dry-run` — simulate the entire pipeline; do NOT invoke droid
  exec; do NOT commit. The gate prints `[dry-run] auto-decision:
  accept` and exits 0. The simulator's `COMPLETED · run_id=...`
  banner is NOT a real-verdict: it is a §7 silent-green shape
  (see §15 in `planning/phase-4.5/RUN-PROMPT.md`). Treat dry-run as a
  wiring test, not as proof that a chunk would land.
- `--non-interactive` — bypass the reconcile gate stdin pause.
  The §5.3 machine-check still runs; refuse-on-blocker|high
  is `SystemExit(4/5)`. Per pass-r3 H-2 (fixed in chunk 13),
  this is *not* a synonym for `--dry-run`: the planner, both
  reviewers, and the executor are still invoked for real.
- `--unattended` — same as `--non-interactive`, but on §5.3
  refusal writes a `checkpoint.json` and `SystemExit(4/5)`;
  the operator resumes via `--resume-from <cp-path>`.
- `--skip-reconcile` — same gate semantics as
  `--non-interactive` (still runs §5.3) + prints a louder banner.

## Three example invocations (overlay form)

**1. First dry-run against a new pilot repo (recommended start).**

```sh
# Test the wiring without spending model credits. The simulator's
# ``COMPLETED`` exit-0 banner proves the overlay → runner plumbing
# is intact; it does NOT prove that a live run would accept.
<PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/bin/run-sprint --dry-run --non-interactive
```

If overlay exits 0 and the runner prints `COMPLETED · run_id=...`,
the wiring is good. **Then move to a real run.**

**2. Real run on a known-good config (operator present at reconcile).**

```sh
# Operator in the seat; type 'accept' / 'amend' / 'reject' at the gate.
<PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/bin/run-sprint
```

If both reviewers flag a blocker|high finding, `accept` will refuse
(`SystemExit 4`). Use `amend <reason>` to record a disposition, or
`reject <reason>` to loop back to the planner.

**3. Unattended live run.**

```sh
# CI / "close the laptop" workload. §5.3 preconditions ALWAYS run.
# Refusals write a checkpoint + SystemExit(4/5) — never silent.
<PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/bin/run-sprint --unattended
# To resume if the run paused for a §5.3 refusal:
<PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/bin/run-sprint --resume-from <checkpoint.json>
```

## What this skill does NOT cover

- The §1–§19 *operating rules*. Read `skills/adversarial-sprint/SKILL.md`
  for the durable principles (digest + index + rehydration).
- The chunk spec format. See `<PILOT_REPO>/.adversarial-sprint/chunks.json`
  (installed from `templates/overlay/sprint-loop-chunks-example.template.json`)
  alongside the rest of the overlay.
- The role/prompt design. See `tools/sprint_loop/prompts/`.
- The framework CLI. The overlay is the operator-facing surface;
  the framework CLI is a debug-only surface (not operator-facing).
  See `tools/sprint_loop/config.py` for the dataclass as the source
  of truth, and `tools/run-with-model.sh` for the run-with-model
  wrapper convention. (Historical H-1 fix: this skill used to point
  operators at the framework CLI directly; the panel flagged that as
  the second operator-facing path.)

## Rehydration reminder

When this skill has been loaded across many turns or conversation
crosses ~150k tokens, re-read `tools/OPERATING-RULES.md` and the
canonical meta-skill before firing the runner. That's §18 + §19 of
the meta-skill's digest.
