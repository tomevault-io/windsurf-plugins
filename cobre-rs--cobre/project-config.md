# Cobre — Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

Cobre is a Rust ecosystem for power system optimization. The first solver
vertical is SDDP-based hydrothermal dispatch.

- **Language**: Rust 2024 edition, MSRV 1.88
- **License**: Apache-2.0
- **Workspace**: 13 workspace members (`cobre-mcp`, `cobre-tui`, `cobre-flow`, `cobre-uc`, `cobre-emt` are member stubs) + the maturin-built `cobre-python` (excluded from the workspace so `cargo test --workspace` does not require a Python interpreter)
- **Build**: `cargo build --workspace`
- **Test**: `cargo test --workspace --features "mpi numa shared-memory serde schema slow-tests flatc-conformance test-support"`
- **Format**: `cargo fmt --all` (CI enforces `--check`)

## Hard Rules

These are non-negotiable. Violations must be fixed before committing.

- `unsafe_code = "forbid"` workspace default — `cobre-solver`, `cobre-comm`, and `cobre-python` override to `allow` for FFI/MPI/PyO3; `cobre-sddp` overrides for the `matrixmultiply::dgemm` call its cut-selection kernel needs (isolated in `src/gemm.rs`)
- `unwrap_used = "deny"` — no `.unwrap()` in library code (ok in tests)
- `clippy::all` and `clippy::pedantic` at `warn` level, zero warnings in CI
- **Never use `Box<dyn Trait>`** — enum dispatch for closed variant sets
- **Never allocate on hot paths** — pre-allocate workspaces, reuse buffers
- **Declaration-order invariance** — results must be bit-for-bit identical
  regardless of input entity ordering
- **Infrastructure crate genericity** — `cobre-core`, `cobre-io`, `cobre-solver`,
  `cobre-stochastic`, `cobre-comm` must contain zero algorithm-specific references
  (no "sddp", "SDDP", "Benders" in types, functions, or doc comments)
- **Python parity** — every output file the CLI writes must also be written by
  the Python bindings in `cobre-python`. When adding a new output, wire it in both.
- Do not use `bincode` — use `postcard` for MPI, `FlatBuffers` for policy
- Do not commit secrets, `.env` files, or credentials
- Do not force-push to `main`
- **`slow-tests` feature** — long-running tests (D-case sweep, FPHA plane-selection, forward-sampler convergence) are gated behind `#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "slow-tests"), ignore = ...)]`. Default `cargo test --workspace` skips them; pass `--features slow-tests` to include them.
- **No plan-structure references in user-facing artifacts** — identifiers such
  as `Epic 09`, `ticket-007`, or `architecture-unification plan` must not
  appear in `CHANGELOG.md`, release notes, `book/`, public rustdoc, or
  comments in shipped code. Plans live in `plans/` (gitignored); public
  artifacts describe behavior, not how the work was organized. Git commit
  messages may reference plan structure — they target git-log readers, not
  release consumers. Existing rustdoc/comment references predating this
  rule are tech debt; clean up opportunistically when touching the
  surrounding code.

## Architecture Guides (Read When Relevant)

SDDP correctness contracts (Benders cut sign, column-bound state pinning, FPHA
average storage, append-only cut pool / slot-identity basis, NCS availability
factors) are codified in `.claude/rules/sddp.md`, which auto-loads when editing
`crates/cobre-sddp/**/*.rs`. Each is a contract, not a style preference — a
plausible deviation produces wrong bounds or rejected warm-starts that still
compile.

Comment & documentation rules for all `.rs` files are codified in `.claude/rules/comments.md`, which auto-loads when editing any `**/*.rs` file. It governs the Earned-Comment Test, the Four Voices, and directives D1–D5 / N1–N6.

Prose documentation integrity rules (scope matrix, the single adaptation, and the six prose-only failure modes) are codified in `.claude/rules/doc-integrity.md`, which auto-loads when editing Markdown files in `book/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and root-level `*.md`.

When modifying hot-path code (`training/forward/`, `training/backward/`,
`training/training.rs`, `simulation/pipeline.rs`, `training/lower_bound.rs`),
read:
→ `.claude/architecture-rules.md`

When applying a stored basis at any call site, read:
→ `crates/cobre-sddp/src/cut/basis_reconstruct.rs` module docs.
Two public entry points exist — use the correct one for the path:

- `reconstruct_basis` — the **baked hot path** (forward pass, simulation, baked
  backward). Slot-identity-based: matches stored cut-row statuses to the current
  LP by `CutPool` slot, assigns `BASIC` to new cuts, then calls
  `enforce_basic_count_invariant`. **Never bypass this on the baked path.**
- `reconstruct_basis_uniform_basic` — the **DCS path** (`dcs.rs`). Slot-identity-
  free: copies the column block and template rows, then assigns every resident cut
  row `BASIC` unconditionally. DCS adds its cut rows fresh each solve and does not
  track which will bind, so slot alignment is unnecessary. The caller pairs it with
  `enforce_basic_count_invariant` to restore the invariant.

When changing the MPI basis-cache wire format, read:
→ `crates/cobre-sddp/src/workspace/workspace.rs` —
`CapturedBasis::to_broadcast_payload` and
`CapturedBasis::try_from_broadcast_payload` are the sole
owners of the byte layout. Any layout change must update
both methods together; the `broadcast_basis_cache` helper
