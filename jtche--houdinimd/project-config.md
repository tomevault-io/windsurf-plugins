# AGENTS.md

Project information: @README.md

## Guides

- [Architecture](agents/architecture.md) — the four layers, and which file owns what.
- [Deployment](agents/deployment.md) — Cloudflare CI deploys. You do not.
- [Page Content](agents/page-content.md) — regenerate the pages your change affects.
- [Code](agents/code.md) — one source of truth, small modules, no legacy paths.
- [Front-end](agents/frontend.md) — the design language, and how to look at a change.
- [Testing](agents/testing.md) — test the change, do not commit the test.
- [Issues](agents/issues.md) — where specs live.

## Rules

- Read the documentation before you write code against a service, quote a rate,
  or state a limit. Do not answer from memory. Prefer the site's own `llms.txt`
  or `index.md`; otherwise prefix the link with `markdown.new/` for clean raw
  text. Cloudflare publishes every page as `<url>/index.md`.
- Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English in all writing: replies, comments,
  commits, pull requests.
- Do not keep backward compatibility. Delete the old path. Do not add fallbacks,
  shims, or migrations.
- Do not write documentation that a person can get from the code. Write a short
  comment in the code instead.
- Do not record a fact that goes stale: page counts, version numbers, file
  inventories, benchmark tables, audit results. Point to the code that holds it.
- Do not publish, commit, or push SideFX content or any other copyrighted
  material. This includes doc pages, test fixtures made from doc pages, images
  from the Houdini install, and examples quoted at length. Make test fixtures on
  the machine that runs the test and keep them out of version control.
- Do not add a file to this repo unless the product needs it. Scratch work goes
  in a temporary directory.
- Do not commit SQL migration files. Write them in `migrations/`, apply, then delete
  the file.
- Look at a UI change before you report it done. A build that compiles is not a
  page that reads.
- When you change how content is scraped or rendered, regenerate every affected
  page with `bun run regen`. It does not change the live site — see
  [Content](agents/content.md).
