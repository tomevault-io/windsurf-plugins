# CLAUDE.md — repo-specific conventions for Claude Code sessions

This file is read by Claude Code when a session starts in this repo. It captures
**non-obvious conventions** the maintainer has explicitly chosen, so any future
session (or sub-agent) immediately knows the local rules without re-deriving
them from chat history.

Out of scope here: things already documented in `README.md` (install + usage),
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (test strategy, CI structure), `docs/TECHNICAL.md` (architecture).

## Merge policy — zero-confirmation when checks are green

When you (Claude Code) open a PR via `mcp__github__create_pull_request` and the
follow-up CI runs land, **act on the result without prompting the maintainer**:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| CI 6/6 green AND MiniMax review decision is `approve` OR `comment` | **Immediately call `mcp__github__merge_pull_request` (squash).** Don't ask. |
| CI 6/6 green AND review decision is `request-changes` | Read the review's `must_fix` items. Push fixes for the real ones, skip false-positives. Trigger a new review iteration. |
| CI red | Inspect the failing job, push a fix. Don't ask. |
| MiniMax can't converge after 5 iterations | The `pr-review.yml` workflow auto-escalates to Sonnet 4.6 (issue #60). If Sonnet also blocks, it opens a `needs-human` issue — at that point ping the maintainer. |

You merge through the user's MCP-authenticated path (their token, not workflow
GITHUB_TOKEN), so the resulting `push: main` cascades to `publish.yml` and
`docs.yml` automatically. No PAT needed (issue #54).

**Only prompt the maintainer when:**
- The MiniMax review is genuinely ambiguous (you can't tell true from false positive)
- The PR changes user-facing public API surface (PyPI version, MCP tool schema, etc.)
- A workflow fails in a way you haven't seen before (novel error class)
- The maintainer explicitly says "wait for me" / "I'll merge"

The instinct to "ask before merging" is wrong here. The maintainer has already
delegated this decision via #54's pipeline simplification + repeated explicit
agreement. Asking again per-PR is friction without value.

### Monitoring contract — never break the callback chain

The maintainer's hard rule (PR #66 retro): **the moment you open a PR, the
event chain is your responsibility — don't let it stall.** If the maintainer
ever has to type "what's the status?" the chain has broken and you failed.

For every PR you open:

1. **Subscribe** to `mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity` for review/CI events.
2. **In parallel**, start a `Bash run_in_background` poll script that:
   - Polls `https://api.github.com/repos/tangivis/twitter-mcp/commits/<sha>/check-runs`
     every ~10s.
   - **Encodes the merge-policy decision in-script**: when all checks complete
     and substantive ones are green (MiniMax `skipped` is fine for docs-only
     PRs), the foreground session should auto-merge as soon as the
     notification arrives — don't wait for a second nudge.
   - Exits non-zero on red so you fix-and-push without asking.
3. After merge, start a **second** poll for the cascade run on `main`
   (publish.yml / docs.yml) so PyPI / Pages confirmation also surfaces
   automatically.

Webhook alone is not sufficient — events can be batched, dropped, or arrive
after a long quiet stretch. Background poll is the safety net. Run both.

The cost of "I'll just sit and wait for the webhook" is asking the maintainer
to be the heartbeat. That's the failure mode this rule prevents.

## Spec-first workflow

Per the maintainer's emphasized SDD/TDD pattern:

1. Open an issue with the spec (problem, acceptance criteria, design, out-of-scope, TDD plan).
2. Branch + write red tests first.
3. Implement; verify green.
4. Open PR referencing the issue (`closes #N`).
5. PR runs through review + CI; merge per the policy above.

For genuinely tiny changes (one-line typo fix, dependency bump) the issue step
is acceptable to skip — but document the trade-off in the PR body. The maintainer
called this out in late conversation: "issue → spec → SDD → TDD" is the bar.

## Review labels (Conventional Comments-derived)

`pr-review.yml` uses these severity labels (issue #60). Treat them at face value:

| Label | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `must_fix` | Real bug, security hole, broken contract | Caps merge until fixed |
| `issue` | Design problem worth discussing | Discuss; usually fix |
| `suggestion` | Improvement, not blocking | Apply if cheap; skip if not |
| `nitpick` | Style/wording/naming | Skip-without-explanation OK |
| `praise` | Well-done point | Read; no action |
| `question` | Reviewer doesn't understand | Reply; no code change unless ambiguity is real |

The MiniMax review on this repo is **advisory** — the maintainer (you) makes the
call. False-positives are common; trust your judgment over the model's.

## Other repo-local conventions worth knowing

These are documented elsewhere but easy to miss:

- **`json.dumps` is renamed `_dumps()`** repo-wide — always `ensure_ascii=False`.
- **Test fakes** in `tests/test_tools.py` MUST mirror real twikit model attributes
  — `tests/test_fixture_shapes.py` enforces this (issue #37 was caused by drift).
- **Vendor patches** in `twitter_mcp/_vendor/twikit/` carry `# twitter-mcp patch
