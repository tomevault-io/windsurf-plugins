description: Satisfying the type checker when working with SQLModel
---

Complex SQLModel queries sometimes cause the type checker to choke, even though the queries are valid.

For instance, this error sometimes arises when using `selectinload`:

'error: Argument 1 to "selectinload" has incompatible type "SomeModel"; expected "Literal['*'] | QueryableAttribute[Any]"'

The solution is to explicitly coerce the argument to the appropriate SQLModel type.

E.g., we can resolve the error above by casting the eager-loaded relationship to InstrumentedAttribute:

```python
session.exec(select(SomeOtherModel).options(selectinload(cast(InstrumentedAttribute, SomeOtherModel.some_model))))
```

Similarly, sometimes we get type checker errors when using `delete` or comparison operators like `in_`:

'error: Item "int" of "Optional[int]" has no attribute "in_"'

These can be resolved by wrapping the column in `col` to let the type checker know these are column objects:

```python
session.exec(select(SomeModel).where(col(SomeModel.id).in_([1,2])))
```
