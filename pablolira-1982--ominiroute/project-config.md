# OmniRoute PR and Coverage Instructions

- Treat `npm run test:coverage` as a required gate for PR work.
- The repository minimum is `60%` for statements, lines, functions, and branches.
- If a PR changes production code in `src/`, `open-sse/`, `electron/`, or `bin/`, it must include automated tests in the same PR.
- When reviewing or updating a PR, if the report shows missing tests or coverage below `60%`, do not stop after reporting the problem. Add or update tests in the PR first, rerun the coverage gate, and only then ask for confirmation.
- Prefer the smallest test layer that proves the behavior:
  - unit tests first
  - integration tests when multiple modules or DB state are involved
  - e2e only when the behavior is truly UI or workflow-dependent
- For bug issues, try to encode the reproduction as an automated test before or alongside the fix.
- In the final PR report, include:
  - the commands you ran
  - the changed test files
  - the final coverage result
