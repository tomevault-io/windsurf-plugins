# AGENTS.md

This project aimed to build a end-to-end, lightweight Swift compiler and runtime in Rust.

## Folder Structure

- `crates` - tswift rust packages.
- `crates/tswift-lexer`, `crates/tswift-ast`, `crates/tswift-parser`, `crates/tswift-sema` - the **pure-Rust Swift frontend** pipeline. `crates/tswift-frontend` drives it and exposes the runtime-facing typed AST (`Analysis`/`Node`/`NodeKind`), where `Node` is a thin cursor straight over the `tswift_ast` parse AST (one shared `NodeKind` vocabulary; `src/decode.rs` decodes modifier/literal payloads). No C, no LLVM, no codegen — just the frontend. (The former vendored `msf` C frontend has been decommissioned, and the compatibility lowerer it required has been removed; see `docs/plan/unify-frontend-runtime-ast.md`.)

## Notable Documents

- `README.md` - overview of the project.
- `docs/swift-runtime/feature-checklist.md` - high level checklist of features we want to implement.
- `docs/swift-runtime/stdlib-inventory.md` - complete standard library interface of Swift.
- `docs/plan/swift-runtime-implementation-plan.md` - overall plan
- `docs/research` - research on the (now-removed) msf C frontend and the VM. `docs/research/msf-ast-cheatsheet.md` documents the historical runtime-facing AST contract — useful background, though the runtime now consumes the `tswift_ast` parse AST directly.
- `docs/agents/environment.md` - commit/signing conventions, offline-build constraints, tooling notes. Read before committing or adding a dependency.

## Development

- Read `CODING_STANDARD.md` before writing code.
- **Hard rules** (details in `docs/agents/environment.md`):
  - Run `scripts/presubmit` (fmt + clippy + test) before every commit; it must be green. It can take 10 minutes on a cold/dirty build — invoke it with a generous timeout (>= 900s) or run it in the background and poll, instead of letting the default tool timeout kill and retry it.
  - The wasm smoke test (`crates/tswift-wasm/tests/wasm_smoke.rs`) is opt-in (`TSWIFT_WASM_SMOKE=1`); run `scripts/validate web` when touching `crates/tswift-wasm` or web code.
  - Commit with `git commit --no-gpg-sign` (the signing agent fails in non-interactive sessions).
  - Assume no network access to crates.io: never add a dependency that isn't already in `Cargo.lock` unless user confirmed. Prefer a small self-contained module.
- **Git Commits**: Use conventional format: <type>(<scope>): <subject> where type = feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore|perf. Subject: 50 chars max, imperative mood ("add" not "added"), no period. For small changes: one-line commit only. For complex changes: add body explaining what/why (72-char lines) and reference issues. Keep commits atomic (one logical change) and self-explanatory. Split into multiple commits if addressing different concerns.
- No "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or "Generated with" line.

## Software Design Principles

- Read the load-bearing decisions and invariants (architecture docs, concurrency model, API promises) before sketching any design.
- Decompose the feature to its weakest sufficient requirement — most “we need to rewrite X” claims dissolve into something the current architecture already supports.
- Turn open-ended design choices into a single “who owns X?” question (who blocks, who owns state, who retries, who drives whom); enumerating its answers gives a complete, non-overlapping option set.
- Stress-test candidates against the least forgiving layer first (threading boundaries, public APIs, third-party integrations) — prefer the design that shrinks that layer’s contract.
- Distinguish adopting a capability internally from exposing it in your public contract; the former is far cheaper and can come first.
- Write rejected-for-now options down as tripwires: explicit triggers that would reopen the decision, and what the chosen design preserves for them.
- Phase migrations so infrastructure changes land behavior-preserving and separately from behavior changes — each step green, reviewable, and bisectable.
- Evolve interfaces additively, using adapters to keep existing consumers working unchanged.
- Where platforms or clients differ in capability, name the degraded tiers honestly instead of faking parity.
- Ground the design in what the code actually does at every layer the feature crosses; never design from memory or docs alone.
- Record unverified assumptions as named risks with a “verify by” checkpoint, not silent bets.

## Coverage

### Stdlib coverage

To measure how much of the Swift stdlib the runtime implements (overall and
per section), use the **`stdlib-coverage`** skill.

## Agent skills

- **Keep visible reasoning short.** No filler/hedging. Drop articles, fragments OK, short synonyms.

### Agent

If using Paseo, use `/paseo` skill to find subagents orchestration skill. Create "subagent" (not "detached" agent) in current workspace. Only start one subagent at a time.

### Autoloop

When user request `autoloop`, read `.agents/skills/autoloop/SKILL.md` for details.

### Issue tracker & triage

Issues live in GitHub Issues; use the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. Label vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`): see `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.
