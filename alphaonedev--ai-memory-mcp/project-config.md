# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Required Reading at Session Start (AI agents)

Before proposing any change to this repository, load the following into context:

- [`docs/AI_DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/AI_DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md) — the eight-phase
  workflow every AI session must follow (recall → plan → branch → implement → gates →
  self-review → PR → handoff).
- [`docs/AI_DEVELOPER_GOVERNANCE.md`](docs/AI_DEVELOPER_GOVERNANCE.md) — authority
  classes (Trivial / Standard / Sensitive / Restricted), attribution rules, security
  policy, memory governance, and the hard prohibitions you must never violate.
- [`docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`](docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md) — code, test,
  security, and release standards.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — contributor procedures.

### Loading project memory at session start

The mechanical guarantee is the SessionStart hook documented in
[`docs/integrations/claude-code.md`](docs/integrations/claude-code.md).
Install it once; every fresh Claude Code session boots with relevant
memory context already in the system prompt — no model proactivity
required. See the full agent matrix in
[`docs/integrations/README.md`](docs/integrations/README.md).

If the hook is not installed (cold-start fallback), call
`memory_session_start` followed by `memory_recall <task topic>` before
responding. Text directives are best-effort; the hook is the load-bearing
mechanism. See [issue #487](https://github.com/alphaonedev/ai-memory-mcp/issues/487)
for the RCA.

Default namespace for this repo is `ai-memory-mcp`.

Every commit you author must end with a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming the model.
Every PR you open must include the **AI involvement** section described in
[`AI_DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md` §8.2](docs/AI_DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md).

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
cargo build                    # Debug build
cargo build --release          # Release build (thin LTO, stripped)

# All four gates must pass before PR submission:
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::all -D clippy::pedantic
AI_MEMORY_NO_CONFIG=1 cargo test
cargo audit

# Run a single test
AI_MEMORY_NO_CONFIG=1 cargo test test_name

# Benchmarks
cargo bench --bench recall
```

`AI_MEMORY_NO_CONFIG=1` prevents loading user config which may trigger embedder/LLM initialization during tests.

## Dogfooding release branches

Every `release/v0.6.x.y` branch should be dogfooded by the maintainer for at least 24h before tag-cut so any migration / capability / wire-format regression surfaces in real use, not just CI. The script that does this on this node:

```bash
scripts/dogfood-rebuild.sh
```

What it does (idempotent — safe to re-run after every commit):
1. `cargo build --release`
2. Backs up the live MCP DB to `/tmp/ai-memory-dogfood-test-<ts>.db`
3. Dry-runs migrations against the backup (proves v17→v18→v19 etc. round-trip cleanly on real data)
4. Re-points `/opt/homebrew/bin/ai-memory` → `target/release/ai-memory` (via `brew unlink` + symlink)
5. Lists running MCP processes that need a Claude Code restart to pick up the new binary

What it does NOT do:
- Touch the live DB (migrations only run when an actual ai-memory process opens it on the next MCP restart)
- Kill the running MCP (would self-DOS the in-flight Claude Code session)
- Bump `Cargo.toml` version (that's a tag-cut concern)

Reverting to the brew-managed binary: `brew link --overwrite ai-memory`.

## Architecture

**ai-memory** is a Rust-based persistent memory system exposing three interfaces over a shared SQLite database layer:

1. **MCP Server** (`src/mcp.rs`) — stdio JSON-RPC 2.0 with 43 tools + 2 prompts
2. **HTTP API** (`src/handlers.rs`) — Axum REST server on port 9077, 50 endpoints at `/api/v1/`
3. **CLI** (`src/main.rs`) — clap-based, 40 subcommands with optional `--json` output

All three interfaces share the same database (`src/db.rs`) and validation (`src/validate.rs`) layers. Shared state is `Arc<Mutex<(Connection, PathBuf, ResolvedTtl, bool)>>` — a single SQLite connection protected by a mutex. Lock contention is the bottleneck under concurrent HTTP + MCP load.

### Key Modules

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `main.rs` | CLI parsing, daemon setup (Axum + GC scheduler), command dispatch |
| `mcp.rs` | MCP server: stdin/stdout JSON-RPC loop, tool definitions |
| `db.rs` | All SQLite operations: CRUD, FTS5 queries, recall scoring, GC, schema migrations |
| `handlers.rs` | HTTP request handlers (Axum extractors), error sanitization |
| `models.rs` | Core data structures: Memory (15 fields), MemoryLink, request/response types |
| `validate.rs` | Input validation for all write paths |
| `config.rs` | Feature tier system (keyword/semantic/smart/autonomous), TTL config |
| `reranker.rs` | Hybrid recall: blends semantic (cosine) + keyword (BM25-like FTS5) scores |
| `embeddings.rs` | HuggingFace model loading, vector generation, cosine similarity |
| `hnsw.rs` | In-memory HNSW vector index for approximate nearest-neighbor search |
| `llm.rs` | LLM integration via Ollama: query expansion, auto-tagging, contradiction detection |
