General gotchas to look for when reviewing code. Gotchas marked with "POTENTIAL BUG" have a high likelihood of causing a bug if not followed.
Check for these gotchas in symbols that are being modified. If a potential gotcha exists in the code (but isn't being caused by the current changes), still mention it to improve code quality over time.

**IMPORTANT: When reviewing code, make sure to check for any logical bugs or flawed assumptions that could be introduced by the changes (even if they are not listed below).**

## Instrumentation Self-Reference (POTENTIAL BUG)

**Problem**: Using instrumented global functions within the SDK's own instrumentation code can cause:

- Circular dependencies between instrumentation and utility modules
- Infinite recursion when instrumented code calls itself
- Incorrect behavior where SDK internals use mocked/replayed data instead of real data

**Examples of problematic code**:

```typescript
// BAD: Using potentially instrumented Date in logger
private formatMessage(message: string): string {
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString(); // This Date might be instrumented!
  return `${timestamp} ${message}`;
}

// BAD: Using potentially instrumented env vars in SDK code
const config = process.env.API_KEY; // This might be mocked in replay mode!
```

**Solution**: Use `OriginalGlobalUtils` or create new original utilities to access uninstrumented versions:

```typescript
// GOOD: Using original Date for SDK internal logging
import { OriginalGlobalUtils } from '../utils/originalGlobalUtils';

private formatMessage(message: string): string {
  const timestamp = OriginalGlobalUtils.getOriginalDate().toISOString();
  return `${timestamp} ${message}`;
}

// GOOD: Using original process.env for SDK internal config
const config = OriginalGlobalUtils.getOriginalProcessEnvVar("API_KEY");
```
