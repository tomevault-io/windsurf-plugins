# AI Stack Webapp

This is a webapp for sharing AI Stacks so that users can compare and choose the best set of tools for their needs.

## Development Process
* Web App is running on localhost:3019 - I am taking care of the dev servers running properly in my own terminal
* Convex is running already as well
* Schema changes are often required and okay
* Avoid backwards-compat, prefer convex migrations

## Styling Guidelines
* **No border-radius** - Use sharp corners throughout the design
* Use monospace fonts for buttons, labels, and technical accents
* Brand color: lime

## Tech Stack
* `pnpm`
* TypeScript / Vite / Biome
* Tanstack Start
* Tanstack Query
* Tanstack Forms
* Tailwind CSS
* Lucide Icons
* Convex
* Better Auth
* Resend

## Icon Migration

After seeding (or any time `iconUrl` rows on tools/models/bundles need to be
moved into Convex storage), run:

```sh
# Dev: auto-detects the running `convex dev` anonymous backend's admin key
# from ~/.convex/anonymous-convex-backend-state/<deployment>/config.json
pnpm tsx scripts/migrate-icons.ts

# Self-hosted prod — set self-hosted env vars (in .env.local or shell), deploy
# code first so the migration functions exist, then run:
export CONVEX_SELF_HOSTED_URL=http://10.0.0.20:3210
export CONVEX_SELF_HOSTED_ADMIN_KEY=convex-self-hosted...
npx convex deploy
pnpm tsx scripts/migrate-icons.ts
```

Auth: the script talks HTTP to Convex via `ConvexHttpClient` with admin auth
(no CLI shelling, no stdout parsing). It auto-detects a local anonymous
backend when env vars aren't set.

Idempotent — a second run skips every row that already has an
`iconStorageId`. Data URIs are decoded, http URLs are fetched (8s timeout),
ICOs are decoded via `decode-ico` (largest entry), and everything is sharp'd
to 512×512 WebP q80 and uploaded. Data-URI sources are cleared from
`iconUrl`; http-URL sources are kept as the canonical source.
