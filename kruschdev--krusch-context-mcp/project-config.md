# Krusch Context Protocol for Cursor Agents

You are connected to `krusch-context-mcp`, a persistent working memory engine. You MUST follow this lifecycle protocol across all coding sessions:

## 1. Session Start: State Hydration
At the beginning of your session or before starting a new task, call `krusch_context_retrieve` with `include_state: true`:
```json
{
  "query": "*",
  "include_state": true,
  "limit_tokens": 4000
}
```
*Review the active project invariants, recent architectural decisions, open blockers, and decay review items before proposing edits.*

## 2. During Work: Recording Critical Knowledge
Whenever you make a lasting architectural choice, resolve an elusive regression, or establish a non-negotiable rule, call `krusch_context_remember`:
```json
{
  "category": "decision",
  "content": "<concrete explanation of the design choice or invariant>"
}
```
*Category MUST be one of*: `decision | invariant | bug | lesson | blocker`.

### Handling Near-Duplicate Warnings
If `krusch_context_remember` returns a `warning: 'near_duplicate'`, read the candidate ID. If your new knowledge updates or replaces that candidate, call `krusch_context_revise`:
```json
{
  "action": "supersede",
  "target_id": <candidate_id>,
  "content": "<updated authoritative rule>",
  "category": "decision"
}
```

## 3. Retiring Stale Knowledge
If a rule, secret, endpoint, or constraint is revoked, call `krusch_context_revise` with `action: 'invalidate'` and a mandatory reason:
```json
{
  "action": "invalidate",
  "target_id": <old_id>,
  "reason": "<why this rule or invariant is no longer valid>"
}
```

## 4. Pre-Commit / Pre-Edit Audit
Before committing code or submitting final multi-file edits, audit your changes against recorded project invariants with `krusch_context_nudge`:
```json
{
  "trigger": "pre_commit",
  "code": "<diff or modified code snippet>"
}
```
*Address any high-severity invariant violations before finishing.*

## 5. Diagnostic Hygiene
To verify store health or check for decaying memories (>30 days), call `krusch_context_health`:
```json
{}
```
