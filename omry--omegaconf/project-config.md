# AGENTS.md

Repo-specific directives for coding agents working in this project.

## Behavioral defaults

These guidelines are intended to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Apply them alongside the repo-specific rules below. They bias toward caution over speed, and for truly trivial tasks you may use judgment.

### Think before coding

- Do not assume.
- Do not hide confusion.
- Surface tradeoffs.
- State assumptions explicitly when they matter to the implementation.
- If multiple reasonable interpretations exist, present them instead of silently picking one.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- Push back when warranted.
- If something material is unclear or risky, stop, name what is confusing, and ask instead of guessing.

### Simplicity first

- Solve the requested problem with the minimum code necessary.
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No flexibility or configurability that was not requested.
- No error handling for scenarios that are effectively impossible in context.
- If a solution feels overbuilt for the task, simplify it before considering it done.
- If you write 200 lines and the same result could be achieved in 50, rewrite it.
- Ask: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

### Surgical changes

- Touch only what is needed for the request.
- Do not "clean up" adjacent code, comments, formatting, or structure unless the change requires it.
- Match the existing style and patterns of the codebase unless the user asks for a broader refactor.
- If you notice unrelated dead code or issues nearby, mention them instead of fixing them opportunistically.
- Remove imports, variables, functions, or other artifacts that your change makes unused.
- Do not delete unrelated pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Prefer built-in tools over shell commands

Use `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Edit`, and `Write` for file operations. Reserve
`Bash` for things that genuinely require shell execution: `sl` (Sapling) commands,
deleting files, or `nox` / `pytest` / `python` for tests, linting, and other
repo tooling.

- Avoid inline Python snippets (e.g. `python3 -c ...`) when a dedicated tool or standard CLI utility is sufficient.
- Use `jq` to parse and extract JSON from shell output instead of piping to Python.

### Goal-driven execution

- Translate requests into concrete success criteria that can be verified.
- For bug fixes, prefer reproducing the issue with a test or other reliable check before fixing it.
- For refactors, prefer checks that demonstrate behavior is preserved before and after.
- For multi-step tasks, keep a brief plan in mind and verify each step before calling the work complete.
- Favor specific goals over vague ones:
  - "Add validation" -> write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass.
  - "Fix the bug" -> reproduce it with a test or reliable check, then make it pass.
  - "Refactor X" -> verify behavior before and after the refactor.

## Documentation map

- Sphinx/ReadTheDocs source: [`docs/source/`](./docs/source/)
- Entry point: [`docs/source/index.rst`](./docs/source/index.rst)
- Notebook tutorial: [`docs/notebook/Tutorial.ipynb`](./docs/notebook/Tutorial.ipynb)

## Reproduction files

When asked to create a reproduction for an issue, place files under `temp/`:

- Single-file repro: `temp/<issue_number>.py`
- Multi-file repro: `temp/<issue_number>/`

## Stop and ask

- If a tracked repo file appears unexpectedly renamed, moved, regenerated, deleted, or otherwise changed, stop and ask before reverting, recreating, reclassifying, or staging over that change.
- Do not change the approved Privacy Policy or Terms of Service text unless the user explicitly asks for those documents to be edited.

## Verification

- For any new or changed functionality, test it in two layers:
  - run relevant unit tests with `pytest path/to/test_file.py`
  - run the broader suite with `nox` or `pytest` to ensure no regressions
- If the broader suite disagrees with the focused tests, trust the broader result and do not call the change verified.
- If live verification is blocked by the current environment, request escalation if that would unblock it. If not, stop and ask for guidance.

## Linting and formatting

This project uses several linting and formatting tools. Run them via `nox -s lint` or individually:

- `black .` / `black --check .` — code formatting
- `flake8` — style and error checks (may need `--jobs=1` on some Python versions)
- `isort . --check` — import sorting
- `pyrefly check` — static type checking

All four must pass before a change is considered clean.

## Environment and hooks

- Use the repo-local `.venv` directory as the default development environment.
- Prefer `.venv/bin/python -m ...` for Python module commands and `.venv/bin/<tool>` for installed tools such as `pytest`, `nox`, `black`, and `isort`.
- If `.venv` is missing and environment setup is part of the task, create it with `python3 -m venv .venv` and install development dependencies with `.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements/dev.txt -e .`.
