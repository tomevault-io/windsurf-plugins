description: version bump parity — all 3 version locations must be updated together
---


# version bump rule

when bumping the project version, ALL 3 locations must be updated in the same commit. never bump one without the others. you can also use the `pnpm run version:sync` script to propagate the root version to all sub-packages.

## version locations (all must match)

| # | file | field |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `package.json` (root) | `"version"` |
| 2 | `core/package.json` | `"version"` |
| 3 | `apps/app/package.json` | `"version"` |

## process

1. determine the new version (semver: major.minor.patch)
2. update root `package.json` version, then run `pnpm run version:sync`
3. commit as `chore: bump version to x.y.z`
4. if a lockfile update is needed (new dependency added), run `pnpm install` and commit the lockfile BEFORE tagging
5. tag and push: `git tag vx.y.z && git push origin vx.y.z`

## common mistake to avoid

if you added a new dependency in the same release, run `pnpm install` to update `pnpm-lock.yaml` BEFORE creating the version tag. CI uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` which requires the lockfile to be in sync.
