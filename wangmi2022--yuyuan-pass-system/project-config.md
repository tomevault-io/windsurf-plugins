# Repository operating instructions

## Repository location

- The real Git repository is `D:\资产管理系统\mit-assets-admin`.

## Mandatory verification after code changes

- Preserve unrelated user changes and stage only files that belong to the current task.
- Run the narrowest relevant tests first, then an appropriate build or compile check.
- `git diff --check` must pass before publishing.
- Existing unrelated failures may be reported and bypassed only when task-specific checks pass and the failure is demonstrably outside the changed scope.

## Automatic publish and production restart

The user has explicitly authorized automatic publication and production restart after completed code changes. Once an implementation is finished and verified, do the following without asking for a second confirmation:

1. Confirm the repository is on `main` and inspect `git status -sb` plus the complete task diff.
2. Commit only the task files with a concise conventional commit message.
3. Push the commit to `origin/main` using Git SSH.
4. Deploy that exact committed revision to production and rebuild every affected service.
5. Run the production health check and inspect container status before reporting success.

Do not auto-publish when the user requested only diagnosis, review, explanation, or a local experiment. Do not publish from a non-`main` branch; report the branch mismatch instead.

## Production deployment facts

- Production server: `192.166.20.103`.
- Production web entry: `http://192.166.20.103:8080/`.
- Treat this server and web entry as the only production target unless the user explicitly replaces them.
- Do not use `172.30.3.135:8080`; it is not this asset-management production application.
- The production deployment still uses the legacy compatibility path and SSH alias below; migrate them only as a coordinated runtime operation.
- SSH is available from WSL through the alias `gin-vue-admin-remote`.
- Production root: `/data/gin-vue-admin`.
- The production root is a source deployment tree without `.git`; `git pull` will fail there.
- Deployment staging: `/data/gin-vue-admin/.deploy/staging`.
- Deployment backups: `/data/gin-vue-admin/.deploy/backups`.
- Revision marker: `/data/gin-vue-admin/.deploy/current-commit`.
- Compose directory: `/data/gin-vue-admin/deploy/docker-dev`.
- Server-side temporary workspace: `/data/gin-vue-admin/workspace`.

## Temporary workspace

- Keep every task or deployment temporary artifact under `/data/gin-vue-admin/workspace/` on the production server. Use `/data/gin-vue-admin/workspace/releases/` for release archives and `/data/gin-vue-admin/workspace/tmp/` for disposable working files.
- Never create release archives, generated patches, scratch directories, or other temporary artifacts on the Windows workstation, including the repository and `%TEMP%`.
- The repository-level `/workspace/` path is ignored and must never be committed to GitHub. Do not place source files or required runtime data there.
- Stream release archives from WSL directly to `/data/gin-vue-admin/workspace/releases/release-<short-sha>.tar.gz` through the `gin-vue-admin-remote` SSH alias; do not stage an archive on Windows first.

Publish with an archive created from the committed Git revision, never from an uncommitted working tree. Stream it through the WSL SSH alias directly into `/data/gin-vue-admin/workspace/releases/`, create a timestamped backup of the affected source directories, extract the archive over `/data/gin-vue-admin`, and preserve ignored runtime files such as:

- `deploy/docker-dev/.env`
- `deploy/docker-dev/config.yaml`
- everything under `.deploy`

Determine affected services from the files changed since `.deploy/current-commit`. If the marker is absent or unreliable, rebuild both services.

- `server/**` only: run `./build.sh server`, then force-recreate `server`.
- `web/**` only: run `./build.sh web`, then force-recreate `web`.
- Both trees, shared deployment files, or an unknown baseline: build and force-recreate `server web`.

The recreate command is:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.yml up -d --force-recreate <services>
```

`restart.sh` alone is forbidden for code updates because it does not rebuild images. After recreation, the release gate is:

```bash
./release-acceptance.sh
./ps.sh
```

Only after `release-acceptance.sh` exits with status `0`, write the full deployed commit hash to `.deploy/current-commit`. `ps.sh` is retained for the deployment report, while the acceptance script is the authoritative success gate. If upload, build, recreation, or acceptance fails, keep the previous backup, stop, and report the exact failed stage. Never claim production was updated unless release acceptance passed.

## Secrets and safety

- Never commit, print, archive, or overwrite `.env`, `config.yaml`, credentials, private keys, database dumps, or object-storage secrets.
- Do not use destructive Git commands or delete deployment backups.
- A deployment must be built from a pushed commit so GitHub and production remain traceable to the same revision.
