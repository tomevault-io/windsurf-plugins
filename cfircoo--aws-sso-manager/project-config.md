# AWS SSO Manager - Project Intelligence

## Project Overview
AWS SSO Manager is an Electron + React desktop application for managing AWS SSO sessions and role switching. Currently on v1.0.7, working on buy-me-coffee branch.

## Critical Implementation Paths

### AWS Operations
- ALL AWS SDK operations MUST be in the main process (main.ts)
- NEVER put AWS credentials in the renderer process
- Use IPC channels for renderer-main communication
- Pattern: `ipcMain.handle('channel-name', async (event, args) => {...})`

### State Management
- Use React Context API (not Redux)
- Three main contexts: SsoContext, ElectronContext, ThemeContext
- Contexts are in src/contexts/
- Components consume contexts via custom hooks

### Component Architecture
- Use shadcn/ui components (already configured)
- Components go in src/components/
- Pages go in src/pages/
- All components use TypeScript

### Security Patterns
- Settings stored via electron-store (encrypted)
- Implement caching layer to reduce disk I/O
- Session tokens expire - handle gracefully
- Browser-based SSO flow only

## User Preferences & Workflow

### Development Preferences
- Organization: SensiAI
- Use GitHub MCP server, not CLI commands
- Avoid playwright or browsing tools
- Don't create documentation unless asked

### AWS Configuration
- Regions: dev (eu-central-1), staging/prod (eu-west-1)
- Always check AWS role before operations
- Use jq for AWS CLI JSON parsing
- Never make changes without confirmation

### Memory Bank Usage
- Always read ALL memory bank files when starting work
- Update activeContext.md and progress.md frequently
- Memory bank in /memory-bank/ directory

## Project-Specific Patterns

### File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (AccountCard.tsx)
- Utilities: camelCase (formatTimeLeft.ts)
- Types: interfaces prefix with 'I', types exact name

### Common Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build-mac
npm run build-win

# Create installer
npm run make-dmg
```

### IPC Channel Naming
- `aws-sso:*` - SSO operations
- `ecr:*` - ECR operations  
- `settings:*` - Settings operations
- `open:*` - External URLs/files

### UI Patterns
- Three tabs: All, Favorites, Quick Access
- Session warnings: Yellow <2hr, Red <1hr
- Always show loading states
- Use toast notifications (sonner)

## Known Challenges

### Performance
- Large account lists (100+) cause lag
- Implement virtual scrolling if needed
- Cache where possible

### Session Management
- Tokens expire after ~8 hours
- Handle expiration gracefully
- Auto-redirect to login

### Platform Differences
- Test on both macOS and Windows
- File paths differ between platforms
- Use electron's app.getPath()

## Evolution of Decisions

### v1.0.7 Changes
- Added settings caching (reduced I/O)
- Fixed console URL generation
- Improved debug logging

### Current Work (buy-me-coffee)
- Adding donation functionality
- Integrating with existing UI
- Maintaining clean separation

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Terraform (if used)
- NEVER run apply, only plan/import
- Use Terragrunt with layers
- Only one root.hcl file

### Jira Integration
- Default project: PBAT
- Default component: DevOps  
- Always provide ticket URL
- Valid components: UI/UX, Testing, Product, Platform, Marketing and Branding, IT/Security, Embedded, DevOps, Devices, Data Annotation, CTO, Applications, Analytics, AI/Data

### Confluence
- Default space: RND
- DevOps requests under DevOps folder
- IT requests under IT folder
- Security under Security folder

## Testing Patterns
- Test files in __tests__ directories
- Use Jest and Testing Library
- Mock AWS SDK calls
- Test critical user flows

## Build & Release
- Version in package.json
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Create release notes
- Test both platforms before release
- Use GitHub releases for distribution
