# Agent harness — base

- Read neighboring files before editing; match existing naming, imports (`@/`), and patterns.
- Keep changes scoped to the request; do not remove unrelated comments or refactor untouched modules.
- Do not expose or request secrets; never suggest committing `.env` or keys.
- Verification: with Cursor **trusted workspace** hooks, **`postToolUse`** (matcher: **Edit/Write** on `*.ts` / `*.tsx` only) runs **`npm run verify:agent-hook`** (typecheck → `lint:check` → `test:run`). Set `CURSOR_SKIP_AGENT_VERIFY=1` to skip that hook when needed. Without hooks or for other files, run **`npm run typecheck`**, then **`npm run lint`** and **`npm run test`** when possible. ESLint does not catch all TS errors; do not skip `typecheck` after changing `.ts`/`.tsx` types, props, or exports.
- For new or changed public components: update `src/index.ts`, add or adjust Storybook stories and Vitest specs.
- Prefer delegating large work into clear steps (plan → code → stories → tests) and confirm ambiguous product decisions with the user.
