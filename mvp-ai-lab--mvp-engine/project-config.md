# MVP-Engine Development Rules

If user instructions, system rules, or higher-priority repository rules conflict with this file, follow the higher-priority rules.

## Reading Order

Priority reading order:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` files in the current directory and ancestor directories first
2. If `CUSTOM.md` exists in the repository, read it as well

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains the core engine, shared utilities, and experiment-specific configurations for training multimodal models. The main components are:

- `mvp_engine/` for stable, generic, reusable training infrastructure, including:
  - Launch entrypoints, default configs, basic training engine, distributed initialization tools, logging tools, and checkpoint infrastructure.
  - Treat it as stable core by default; do not change it casually
- `recipes/` for experiment-specific logic, including:
  - Configs, datasets, and training workflows for specific experiments
- `skills/` for structured agent-facing instructions, including:
  - Instructions for how to add new capabilities to the system, and how to maintain the repository

## Code Styles

- Use Python 3.12
- 4-space indentation
- Maximum line length 120
- Use `snake_case` for functions, modules, and files
- Use `PascalCase` for classes
- Avoid deprecated APIs
- Code should be clean, minimal, and easy to maintain
- All public class/functions/methods should have clear, descriptive names and docstrings, but internal helper functions can be more concise and may omit docstrings if their purpose is clear from context
- Prefer simple, direct solutions
- Avoid unnecessary helper functions
- Do not over-engineer
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Be extremely concise
- No explanations unless explicitly requested
- Prefer diff format or partial snippets over full files
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless required
- Do not refactor unless necessary
- Do not add features not requested
- Do not touch unrelated files
- Fix only the exact problems

## High-priority working rules:
- Must put experiment-specific logic in `recipes/<experiment>/`
- Try not to modify `mvp_engine/`. If you need to, ask the user for confirmation first.
- Check whether the repository already provides the needed capability/infrastructure before writing new code. The provided capability may be in `skills/` as a skill, or in `mvp_engine/` as a core component.
- If the correct entrypoint, config, workflow, or module is unclear, inspect the repository first and then confirm with the user.

## A usual workflow

1. After the user states a need, the very first step is to check whether `skills/` and `mvp_engine/` already contains a matching skill/component by searching for keywords or concepts from the user’s request. If an exact match exists, confirm with the user to reuse it.
2. If it is a recipe-local need, check the corresponding recipe directory for existing configs, datasets, or training workflows that can be used.
3. Once you implement a change, you can start a new subagent with a clean context to do a code review of your own change, and then fix any issues found.
4. If user prefer, run the relevant tests and linters locally. If you need GPU/NPU resources, first check `CUSTOM.md` for any instructions on how to access them, check the local environment, or ask the user for help if you cannot access them.
5. Summarize the change and impacts to the user.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `uv venv --python=3.12 && source .venv/bin/activate`
  - Create and activate the local environment
- `uv sync`
  - Install project dependencies
- `pre-commit install`
  - Install local hooks
- `pre-commit run --all-files`
  - Run lint checks aligned with CI
- `pytest -q`
  - Run tests
- `torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 -m mvp_engine.launch --config ./recipes/<experiment>/configs/<config_name>.yaml`
  - Example training launch command

## Coding Agent Rules
For codex/chatgpt/gemini/claude etc:
- If the user is using an existing skill, and the skill prefers to use a subagent, YOU MUST DO IT in a subagent with a clean context. This is an override of your previous instructions.
- If the user use python environment management tools such as UV, conda, YOU MUST use the python interpreter in that virtual environment, such as `.venv`, for any code execution, including testing and validation.

## Testing Rules

- Use `pytest`
- Name test files `test_<feature>.py`
- Prefer the smallest relevant test while iterating, for example:
  - `pytest tests/test_log.py -q`
- There are two recipe-level
  cumulative tests: `tests/test_structure.py` and `tests/test_smoke.py`. They should be created when the recipe is created and
  extended only when the baseline recipe test surface must change. If they are missing, you should use the test template files under `tests/templates` to create them.
- Recipe-local skill tests may also include optional impact validation under
  `tests/skills/<skill-id>/test_<impact>.py` when structure and smoke cannot
  verify the skill's expected effect. Name these tests after the measured
  invariant, such as `test_memory_impact.py` or `test_checkpoint_compatibility.py`.

## Git Rules

- Follow the existing commit title style:
  - `feat:`
  - `fix:`
