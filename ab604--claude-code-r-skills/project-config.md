# Modern R Development Guide

*This document captures current best practices for R development. For detailed guidance, refer to the skill files below.*

## Core Principles

1. **Use modern tidyverse patterns** - Prioritize dplyr 1.1+ features, native pipe, and current APIs
2. **Profile before optimizing** - Use profvis and bench to identify real bottlenecks
3. **Write readable code first** - Optimize only when necessary and after profiling
4. **Follow tidyverse style guide** - Consistent naming, spacing, and structure
5. **Bayesian Inference** - Use brms and marginaleffects
6. **Scientific reasoning** - We test hypotheses; we never prove them. Always reason from evidence, maintain healthy scepticism, quantify both certainty and uncertainty explicitly (Bayesian), and never tell the user what you think they want to hear at the expense of accuracy.

## Package and Environment Management

For R packages use pak and for R environments use renv

## Quick Reference

### Essential Modern Patterns

```r
# Always use native pipe
data |> filter(x > 0) |> summarise(mean(y))

# Modern joins with join_by()
inner_join(x, y, by = join_by(a == b))

# Per-operation grouping with .by
summarise(data, mean(value), .by = category)

# Embrace for function arguments
my_func <- function(data, var) {
  data |> summarise(mean = mean({{ var }}))
}
```

### Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```r
# Avoid legacy magrittr pipe
data %>% filter(x > 0)  # Use |> instead

# Avoid old join syntax
by = c("a" = "b")  # Use join_by(a == b)

# Avoid group_by/ungroup
group_by(x) |> summarise(y) |> ungroup()  # Use .by instead

# Avoid sapply (type-unstable)
sapply(x, f)  # Use map_*() instead
```

## Python

Use uv for python environment.
