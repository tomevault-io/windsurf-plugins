# GEMINI.MD: AI Collaboration Guide

This document provides essential context for AI models interacting with this project. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency and maintain code quality.

## 1. Project Overview & Purpose

* **Primary Goal:** This project, `libanaf`, is a Python library and Command Line Interface (CLI) designed to interact with the Romanian National Agency for Fiscal Administration (ANAF) e-Factura API. Its core functions include handling OAuth2 authentication, downloading and processing electronic invoices (in UBL XML format), and monitoring message statuses.
* **Business Domain:** The project operates in the Fintech sector, specifically focusing on electronic invoicing and fiscal compliance within Romania.

## 2. Core Technologies & Stack

* **Languages:** Python (>=3.11)
* **Frameworks & Runtimes:** Typer for the CLI application, with Flask used for the local server during the OAuth2 authentication flow.
* **Databases:** The application does not use a traditional database. It interacts directly with the ANAF API and stores configuration and downloaded invoices on the local filesystem.
* **Key Libraries/Dependencies:**
    *   `httpx`: Asynchronous HTTP client for API communication.
    *   `authlib`: Handles the OAuth2 authentication flow.
    *   `pydantic-xml`: For parsing and validating UBL XML invoices.
    *   `lxml`: Used for XML schema validation.
    *   `typer`: Powers the command-line interface.
    *   `rich`: For creating formatted and visually rich CLI output.
* **Package Manager(s):** `uv` is used to manage the packages

## 3. Architectural Patterns

* **Overall Architecture:** The project is a modular Python application with a clear separation of concerns. It exposes its functionality as both a library and a CLI. The architecture is designed around distinct packages for authentication (`auth/`), configuration (`config.py`), CLI commands (`cli/`), and domain-specific logic for invoices (`invoices/`) and UBL standards (`ubl/`).
* **Directory Structure Philosophy:**
    *   `/libanaf`: Contains all primary source code for the library and CLI.
    *   `/libanaf/auth`: OAuth2 flow (`AnafAuthClient`) and local TLS callback server (`OAuthCallbackServer`).
    *   `/libanaf/cli`: Typer CLI entry point (`app.py`) and sub-commands (`auth.py`, `invoices/`).
    *   `/libanaf/cli/invoices`: Typer commands for invoice management (`list`, `show`, `summary`, `prod-summary`, `download`, `process`, `render-pdf`).
    *   `/libanaf/invoices`: Pure library package — fetch, download, process, query, and summarize invoices. No CLI dependencies.
    *   `/libanaf/ubl`: UBL XML deserialization and validation via pydantic-xml.
    *   `/libanaf/failure_tracker.py`: Persistent JSON counter for consecutive sync failures across systemd restarts.
    *   `/libanaf/notifications.py`: Email alert helpers (`send_token_expired_alert`, `send_network_failure_alert`) via stdlib `smtplib`.
    *   `/secrets/.env.example`: Full reference for all environment variables (safe to commit — no real secrets).
    *   `/tests`: Unit and integration tests, with fixtures in `/tests/fixtures`.
    *   `/ai/briefs`: Task specifications for AI agents.
    *   `/docs`: Project documentation and sample files.

## 4. Coding Conventions & Style Guide

* **Formatting:** Code is formatted using `ruff` with a line length of 120 characters, double quotes (`"`) for strings, and space-based indentation. All code must pass `ruff check .`.
* **Naming Conventions:**
    *   `variables`, `functions`: `snake_case` (e.g., `get_config`)
    *   `classes`: `PascalCase` (e.g., `LibANAF_AuthClient`)
    *   `files`: `snake_case` (e.g., `product_summary.py`)
* **API Design:** The internal API is modular. The external interaction is with the ANAF REST/JSON API. The CLI follows a command/subcommand structure (e.g., `libanaf invoices prod-summary`).
* **Error Handling:** The application uses custom exceptions (`AnafRequestError` for HTTP/API errors; `AuthorizationError` → `TokenExpiredError` when the OAuth2 refresh token is expired and a hard re-auth is required) and implements a retry policy with exponential backoff for transient API errors. On sync failure, email alerts are sent via `libanaf/notifications.py` (STARTTLS + Gmail App Password); the consecutive failure count is persisted across runs in a JSON file by `libanaf/failure_tracker.py`.

## 5. Key Files & Entrypoints

* **Main Entrypoint(s):** The primary entrypoint for the CLI application is the `app` object in `libanaf/cli/app.py`, which is exposed as a script via `pyproject.toml` (`libanaf.cli:app`).
* **Configuration:** Configuration is loaded from a `.env` file (default: `secrets/.env`, overridden by `LIBANAF_ENV_FILE` env var) via `pydantic-settings` with env prefix `LIBANAF_` and nested delimiter `__` (e.g. `LIBANAF_AUTH__CLIENT_ID`). The `libanaf/config.py` module manages access via the cached `get_settings()` function. Settings sections: `auth`, `connection`, `efactura`, `storage`, `retry`, `log`, `notification` (email alerts), `state` (failure counter path). See `secrets/.env.example` for a full reference.
