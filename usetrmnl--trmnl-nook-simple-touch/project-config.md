## Forcing the Screen Off on NOOK Simple Touch (Android 2.3 / API 10)

The NOOK Simple Touch runs a heavily customised Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) firmware. Putting the screen to sleep programmatically from a third-party app is much harder than it looks. This section documents every approach tried and the one that actually works.

### Device facts
- SoC: OMAP3 (Texas Instruments)
- Android API: 10 (Gingerbread 2.3.x)
- ADB: runs as `uid=0` (root), `ro.secure=0`
- Rooted via Phoenix Project; `/system/bin/su` and `/system/xbin/su` present
- Superuser manager: `com.noshufou.android.su` (stores per-UID **and** per-command grants in `permissions.sqlite`)
- Screen timeout setting: `mTotalDelaySetting=120000` (2 min), controlled by `Settings.System.SCREEN_OFF_TIMEOUT`
- EPD (e-ink) driver: `NATIVE-EPD` / `EPD#PowerManager` — screensaver rendering is triggered by `PowerManagerService` during the normal screen-off path
- Power button fires `KEY_POWER (0x66)` on `/dev/input/event1`

### What does NOT work

| Approach | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| `PowerManager.goToSleep(long)` | Requires `android.permission.DEVICE_POWER` — a `signatureOrSystem` permission. Not grantable to third-party apps even on a rooted device. Throws `SecurityException`. |
| `KEYCODE_POWER` via `input keyevent 26` | No-op on NOOK firmware. The power key is handled at the kernel level before it reaches Android's input system. |
| `sendevent /dev/input/event1 1 116 1` (raw EV_KEY KEY_POWER) | Also no-op for sleep purposes. The kernel intercepts it before `PowerManagerService` sees it in a useful way. |
| `echo mem > /sys/power/state` via `su` | Works as a raw kernel suspend, **but** bypasses the Android power manager entirely. Result: no EPD screensaver renders, wake behaviour is broken (home button unreliable), and it is indistinguishable from a hard crash from Android's perspective. |
| `service call power 6 i32 ...` via `su` | Wrong transaction number. `i64` is not supported by this firmware's `service` binary — only `i32` and `s16`. |
| `service call power 2 i32 <uptime> i32 0` via `su` | Correct binder call (`IPowerManager.goToSleep`, transaction 2 on API 10), and it works from ADB shell. **But** the Superuser dialog appears first, which itself counts as user activity and resets the power manager idle timer. By the time the user taps Allow and `su` actually executes, the timestamp passed to `goToSleep` is stale — the power manager ignores it. Even if you pre-grant via `permissions.sqlite`, the grant is per-command (the timestamp is part of the command string), so it prompts every time. |
| `am broadcast -a com.bn.standby.ACTION_PRE_STANDBY` | WindowManager logs `Handling com.bn.standby.ACTION_PRE_STANDBY` but the broadcast alone does not sleep the screen — it is sent *by* the power manager *after* the screen is already off, not the trigger for it. |

### What DOES work — the `WRITE_SETTINGS` timeout trick

`android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS` is a **normal** permission any third-party app can hold. Using it, the app can set `Settings.System.SCREEN_OFF_TIMEOUT` to a very small value (e.g. 1000 ms). Android's own `PowerManagerService` then fires the natural screen-off path within ~1 second, which:

- Triggers the NOOK EPD screensaver render (`EPD#PowerManager fillRegion`)
- Calls `set_screen_state 0` properly
- Broadcasts `ACTION_SCREEN_OFF`
- Sets up the keyguard correctly so home/power button wakes the device normally

The sleep sequence in `DisplayActivity.sleepNow()`:

1. Write the current TRMNL image to `/media/screensavers/TRMNL/display.png` (so the NOOK screensaver shows the right content)
2. Schedule an `AlarmManager` wake alarm for the next refresh cycle
3. Turn WiFi off if auto-disable is enabled
4. Call `getWindow().clearFlags(FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON)` — removes the wake lock
5. Set `sleepPending = true` — blocks `onResume` from re-asserting `FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON` during the pause/resume cycle caused by the menu dismissing
6. Post a 5-second delayed `Runnable` (grace period for the user's finger to lift) that sets `Settings.System.SCREEN_OFF_TIMEOUT = 1000`
7. On the next `onResume` (after wake), restore `SCREEN_OFF_TIMEOUT = 120000` and re-assert `FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`

**Required manifest permission:**
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS" />
```

No root, no su, no Superuser dialog.

## Build Environment

- Build tool: Apache Ant 1.8.3 (bundled in ADT bundle)
- Java target: API 10 / Android 2.3
- Build command (inside devcontainer):
  ```
  cd /workspace && /opt/adt/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140702/eclipse/plugins/org.apache.ant_1.8.3.v201301120609/bin/ant -Dbuild.compiler=modern debug
  ```
- ADB binary: `/opt/adt/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140702/sdk/platform-tools/adb` (v1.0.31)
- ADB connect: use bare IP, e.g. `adb connect 192.168.1.249` — the old client appends `:5555` automatically
- Install: `adb -s 192.168.1.249:5555 install -r /workspace/bin/trmnl-nook-simple-touch-debug.apk`
