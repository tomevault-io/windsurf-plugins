| `/vcpu-ratio`        | Explain vCPU:pCPU ratios, CPU oversubscription, and scheduling |
| `/memory-mgmt`       | Memory management: ballooning, TPS, compression, swapping      |
| `/storage-design`    | Storage architecture: vSAN, VMFS, NFS, VMDK types              |
| `/drs-rules`         | DRS configuration, affinity rules, and resource pools          |
| `/ha-design`         | HA architecture, admission control, and FT design              |
| `/capacity-plan`     | Capacity planning methodology and sizing ratios                |
| `/perf-troubleshoot` | Performance troubleshooting with esxtop and metrics            |

### Command Examples

```
/vcpu-ratio explain how 4:1 affects scheduling for database workloads
/memory-mgmt when does ballooning kick in vs compression?
/storage-design vSAN vs NFS for VDI with 500 desktops
/drs-rules anti-affinity for a 3-node SQL Always On cluster
/ha-design admission control for N+1 with 4 hosts and mixed VM sizes
/capacity-plan size a cluster for 200 VMs: 60% general, 30% database, 10% VDI
/perf-troubleshoot VM showing 8% CPU ready but host only at 60% utilization
```

## Reference Index

All detailed technical content lives in `references/`. Each command file specifies which references to read. This index maps topics to files for ad-hoc questions that fall outside a specific command.

## Response Style

When answering vSphere architecture questions:

- **Explain why, not just what.** Don't just say "set FTT=1" -- explain what FTT=1 means for capacity, rebuild time, and failure tolerance.
- **Include thresholds and metrics.** Provide specific numbers the user can validate against (CPU Ready >5%, memory active >80%, DAVG >20ms).
- **Connect to capacity planning.** Most design decisions have capacity implications. Call them out.
- **Reference enterprise patterns.** Ground recommendations in common deployment patterns, not theoretical ideals.
- **Be opinionated.** State what works in practice, not just what's possible. Flag common mistakes.
- **Read the reference files.** Each command specifies which references to consult. Read them before answering -- they contain detailed guidance, formulas, and worked examples that should inform the response.
