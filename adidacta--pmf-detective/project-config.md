# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

**Plan PMF** is a Claude Code plugin that helps product builders create their PMF context layer — reference files that capture the "WHY" behind their product. Claude references these files when building anything for the product.

**Plugin name:** `plan-pmf` (in `plugin.json`)
**Marketplace name:** `pmf-detective` (in `marketplace.json`)

## Architecture

**Plugin Type:** Claude Code marketplace plugin (skills + commands)

**Core Structure:**
- `skills/` — AI-triggered skills with YAML frontmatter
- `commands/` — User-invoked slash commands
- `templates/outputs/` — Output file templates
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Plugin metadata
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — Marketplace listing

**Skill Hierarchy:**
```
pmf-context (coordinator)
├── plan-pmf-mode             (Full context builder — orchestrates the flow)
│
│   Context Layer (assumptions):
├── icp-builder               (ICP section)
├── value-prop-builder        (Value Proposition — Callout + Magnet)
├── mvp-builder               (MVP scope — aha moment → steps → features → requirements)
│
│   Validation:
├── validation-plan-builder   (Choose method + success criteria → routes to execution)
│
│   Execution (based on validation method):
├── asset-generators/
│   └── landing-generator     (Landing page — if validating with signups)
├── outreach-builder          (Outreach plan + Mom Test — if validating with conversations)
└── build-test-guide          (BMAD Method setup — if validating by building)
```

## The Flow

```
1. ICP                → pmf/icp.md           (assumption)
2. Value Proposition  → pmf/value-prop.md     (assumption)
3. MVP PRD            → pmf/mvp.md            (assumption)
4. Validation Plan    → pmf/validation-plan.md (decides HOW to test)
   │
   ├─→ Landing Page     → landing/              (signups/pre-orders)
   ├─→ Outreach         → pmf/outreach-plan.md  (Mom Test conversations)
   └─→ Build & Test     → BMAD Method setup      (build the MVP)
```

The first 3 files are assumptions. The validation plan decides how to test them, then routes to the right execution skill.

## The Context Layer

```
pmf/
├── icp.md              # Who you believe your customer is (assumption)
├── value-prop.md       # Why they should care (assumption)
├── mvp.md              # MVP scope — aha moment, steps, features & requirements (assumption)
├── validation-plan.md  # How you'll test these assumptions + chosen method
└── outreach-plan.md    # (if conversations) Mom Test questions + outreach approach
```

**Progress Tracking:** Context completion is detected by checking for files in user's `pmf/` directory:
- `pmf/icp.md` → ICP defined
- `pmf/value-prop.md` → Value proposition defined
- `pmf/mvp.md` → MVP scope defined
- `pmf/validation-plan.md` → Validation plan set + method chosen

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan-pmf` | Build full context layer (guided flow) |
| `/update-icp` | Update ICP section |
| `/update-value-prop` | Update value proposition |
| `/update-mvp` | Update MVP scope |
| `/pmf-status` | Show context completion status |
| `/generate-assets landing` | Generate a landing page |

## Key Conventions

**SKILL.md Format:**
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: >
  Trigger conditions and purpose.
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Glob, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion
---
```

**Allowed Tools by Skill:**

| Skill | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| pmf-context (coordinator) | Read, Write, Glob, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion |
| plan-pmf-mode | Read, Write, Glob, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion, Task |
| icp-builder | Read, Write, Glob, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion, Task |
| value-prop-builder | Read, Write, Glob, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion |
| mvp-builder | Read, Write, Glob, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion |
| validation-plan-builder | Read, Write, Glob, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion |
| outreach-builder | Read, Write, Glob, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion |
| landing-generator | Read, Write, Glob, Bash |
| build-test-guide | Read, Glob, AskUserQuestion |

**UI Patterns:**
- Use `AskUserQuestion` tool for user choices
- Always include "Not sure" option that adds to Open Questions
- Visual boxes using Unicode box-drawing characters (┌─┐│└─┘) at 63-char inner width
- Progress bars: `████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ X/Y sections`
- Show progress only at section END, not after every message

**AskUserQuestion Best Practices:**
- The `header` field creates a visual divider — use sparingly (1 word max) or omit
- Make questions **self-contained** — include all context in the question text
- Don't rely on text above the question to provide context
- BAD: "Which type?" with header "Target"
- GOOD: "Which type of YouTube learner is your ideal customer?"

**Output Files:** All user outputs go to `pmf/` folder using templates from `templates/outputs/`

**Core Rules:**
- Ask ONE question at a time
