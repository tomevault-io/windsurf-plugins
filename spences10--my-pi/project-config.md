# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Orientation

This repo is `my-pi`: a curated Pi coding-agent distribution plus
reusable `@spences10/pi-*` packages.

Start with:

- `README.md` for distribution-level usage and package list.
- `docs/package-map.md` for installable vs support packages.
- `docs/agent-workflows.md` for repository-specific skill routing.
- `docs/dependency-overrides.md` before changing pnpm overrides.
- Package-local `README.md` files before changing package behavior or
  user-facing docs.

## Repository-specific skills

Project skills live directly under `.agents/<skill>/SKILL.md`. Load
the matching skill before doing the work:

| Task                                             | Skill                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Build or modify Pi extensions/packages           | `pi-extension-development`   |
| Compare proposed customisation with Pi built-ins | `pi-primitive-check`         |
| Prepare or validate releases                     | `pi-release-workflow`        |
| Run review-gated peer issue delivery             | `pi-review-gated-delivery`   |
| Develop or review the observability dashboard    | `pi-observability-local-dev` |
| Test published package installability            | `pi-package-sandbox-test`    |
| Validate repository edits                        | `pi-validation-flow`         |

Keep skill metadata activation-friendly:

- single-line `description`
- `# prettier-ignore` above long descriptions
- trigger language starts with `Use when...`
- validate with
  `pnpx check-skills validate .agents --recursive --json`

## Source of truth order

1. Package-local `README.md` files for user-facing package behavior.
2. `.agents/*/SKILL.md` files for agent operating procedure.
3. Root `README.md` for distribution positioning and commands.
4. Source/tests for implementation details when docs are incomplete.

## Commit and Changeset ownership

Do not commit changes or create a Changeset unless the user explicitly
requests that action. By default, stop after validation so the user
can review the implementation, then let the user create the Changeset
or request that it be created and committed.

Factory v1 is paused and disabled by default. Do not route repository
work through Factory unless the user explicitly requests evaluation of
the experimental package. Use a task harness for ambiguous or risky
single-session work and Team Mode only for peer coordination already
authorized by the user.

## Validation

Before reporting implementation completion:

1. Inspect `git diff --name-only`.
2. Run the narrowest package check/test for touched packages.
3. Run LSP diagnostics for changed TypeScript/Svelte source files.
4. Run root checks when shared files, package manifests, lockfiles,
   registry wiring, or tooling changed.
5. For skill edits, run
   `pnpx check-skills validate .agents --recursive --json`.

Report changed files, validation run, and unresolved risks only.
