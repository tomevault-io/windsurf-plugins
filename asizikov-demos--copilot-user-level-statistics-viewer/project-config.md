# Copilot Session Context

## Project Overview

Next.js App Router single-page application. TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js for visualization. Static export only (`output: 'export'`) — no SSR, no API routes. Deployed to GitHub Pages. See `docs/project-overview.md` for full architecture, data flow, and code organization.

## Critical Architecture Constraint

All parsing and metrics aggregation should run in a **Web Worker** via the `parseAndAggregate` flow — avoid persisting raw metrics on the main thread. The worker is pre-bundled via esbuild (`scripts/build-worker.mjs` → `public/workers/metricsWorker.js`). The `build:worker` step runs automatically before `next build` and `next dev`.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build (runs worker build automatically)
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `npm run test:run` — run the test suite

> **VS Code note**: avoid running `npm run build` while the "Next.js Development Server" task is active — they conflict.

## Code Quality

- No unused variables (`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`)
- No explicit `any` — use proper types (e.g., `TooltipItem<'bar'>` for Chart.js tooltips)
- Escape special characters in JSX (`&apos;`, `&quot;`, `&amp;`)
- Always run `npm run build` before committing to catch TypeScript and ESLint issues early

## Key Domain File

`src/domain/modelConfig.ts` contains Copilot model multipliers synced with GitHub pricing docs. An automated workflow keeps them updated — see `.github/workflows/copilot-model-multipliers.md`.

## UX Patterns

- **Progressive disclosure** for data tables: show top N items by default, expand to see all
- Do not add comments documenting refactoring process (e.g., "Moved to X component")

## Workflow Conventions

- Scan/audit tasks are **read-only** — no surprise code changes
- When using sub-agents, parallelize independent work
- Reference items by name/description, not by number

## Code Navigation

Prefer the **TypeScript LSP** for code navigation and analysis — use `goToDefinition`, `findReferences`, `incomingCalls`, `hover`, and `documentSymbol` before falling back to grep/glob.

## Git Workflow

- **Post-merge cleanup** (user says "merged", "pr merged", or similar) — execute immediately, no confirmation needed
- **Branch cleanup and rebasing** — execute immediately
- **Branch creation, commits, and PR creation** — only after the Commit Gate below is satisfied

### Commit Gate

Do NOT create branches, commits, or PRs automatically after completing code changes. When the implementation work is done, use the `ask_user` tool to ask whether the user wants to proceed with commits and PR creation. Only proceed if they confirm.

Exception: if the user's original prompt explicitly requests commits/PR (e.g., "…create atomic commits and PR"), skip the confirmation and proceed directly.

### Pre-Commit Pipeline

The flow is strictly linear — do not skip or reorder steps:

1. **Code Review** — run as a sub-agent on all changes. If issues are found, fix them before proceeding. The Code Review agent itself never modifies code.
2. **Build gate** — run `npm run build && npm run lint && npm run test:run` (build + lint + test). If it fails, fix the issue and re-run. If the fix changes application logic, go back to step 1.
3. **User approval** — Commit Gate (above)
4. **Git Workflow** — create branch, atomic commits, push, PR. The build is already verified — just do the git mechanics.
