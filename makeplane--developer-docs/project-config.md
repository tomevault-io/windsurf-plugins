```

## Key Documentation Paths

- `self-hosting/methods/kubernetes.md` - K8s deployment guide
- `self-hosting/methods/install-methods-commercial/` - Commercial Docker Compose and Kubernetes
- `self-hosting/govern/integrations/` - GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Sentry
- `self-hosting/govern/plane-ai.md` - AI features configuration
- `self-hosting/govern/environment-variables.md` - All env var reference
- `self-hosting/govern/authentication.md` - Auth setup (LDAP, OIDC, SAML, OAuth)
- `self-hosting/govern/reverse-proxy.md` - Reverse proxy setup
- `self-hosting/manage/` - Instance management, backup/restore, Prime CLI
- `dev-tools/agents/` - Agent development docs
- `dev-tools/mcp-server.md` and `mcp-server-claude-code.md` - MCP server docs

## Important Notes

- Not all features are documented immediately after release
- Check both public docs (docs.plane.so) and internal docs
- `self-hosting/govern/plane-ai.md` is the correct path for AI config (not `self-hosting/plane-ai.md`)
- API reference covers 30+ resource categories — check `docs/api-reference/` for the full list
