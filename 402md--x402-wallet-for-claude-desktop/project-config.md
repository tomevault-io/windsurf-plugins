## Versioning

When creating a new release tag (e.g. `v0.1.5`), always update the `version` field in **all three files** to match:

1. `package.json` — npm version
2. `manifest.json` — `.mcpb` installer reads the version from here
3. Git tag (e.g. `v0.1.5`)

All three must stay in sync. If any is missed the installer will show a stale version.
