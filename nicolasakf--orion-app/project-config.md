# Orion Development Guidelines

## Agent behavior

- **Examine the codebase before answering** the user, even when the conversation is discussion-only (questions, reviews, architecture, or planning) and no code changes are requested. Search and read relevant files so answers reflect what the repo actually does rather than assumptions or generic advice. If you are highly confident the necessary context is already known from earlier exploration in the same conversation, you may skip re-examination; otherwise, always examine the codebase first.

## Development Workflow

- **DO NOT** run `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run start`, etc. unless explicitly requested by the user. You can run lint and tsc/tsx commands to check for errors and fix them.
- For installing packages, use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` command.
- Check correct root directory (`/Users/nicolasfonteyne/GitHub_nicolasakf/Orion`) before package installs

## Code Style Guidelines

- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing (`strict: true`). Avoid `any` types or loose types, only use it when necessary.
- **API Validation**: Always create mock validations using zod for external API responses
- **Components**: Prefer functional components with hooks. Use memoization for performance-critical components
- **Imports**: Group imports by type (React, components, utils, types) with blank lines between groups
- **Functions**: Use function comments for complex logic. Prefer useCallback for functions passed as props
- **Names**: Use PascalCase for components/interfaces, camelCase for variables/functions
- **CSS**: Use Tailwind utility classes via `cn()` for combining conditional classes
- **State**: Prefer local state with useState. Use debouncing for frequent updates
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch for async operations only where exceptions are expected and can be meaningfully handled
- **Performance**: Minimize unnecessary renders with memo(), useCallback() and useEffect() dependency arrays

## Shared modules (client and server)

- Do not use `import "server-only"` or `"use client"` unless a file truly needs them (e.g. React hooks). Prefer plain `.ts` modules for constants, types, and utilities shared by API routes and the UI.
- Keep secrets and filesystem access in API routes or `*.server.ts` modules; avoid pulling Node-only libraries (e.g. `jsdom`, `node:dns`) into settings defaults or other shared entry points.

## Documentation & Type Annotations

- Document all functions/methods/classes when creating/editing them
- Exception: Simple functions with no args/return can have brief 1-2 line comments

## Settings dialog UI

- When adding or editing options in the settings dialog, explain each setting with the **info icon + tooltip** pattern from `components/settings-dialog/settings-info-label.tsx` (`SettingsInfoLabel`, `SettingsInfoSectionTitle`, or the shared fields in `settings-form-fields.tsx`). Do not use inline helper paragraphs under controls unless the user asks for a different layout.

## Prompts & agent instructions (avoid redundancy)

- **One source of truth** for a given behavior: if instructions already live in a **loadable skill** (e.g. `SKILL.md`), a **tool description**, or a **dedicated module**, do **not** copy the same rules into the **system prompt** (or into another place that will load alongside it) unless there is a clear, documented reason.
- **Prefer the layer that always applies** for truly global invariants; **prefer the skill (or other injected content)** for workflow-specific or optional behavior that is only relevant after `load_skill` (or similar) runs.
- Repeating the same policy in multiple prompt surfaces drifts, doubles maintenance, and confuses which place to edit. When you add or change agent-facing text, ask: is this **new** information or a **duplicate** of something already defined elsewhere? Remove or consolidate duplicates.
- Example: workflow rules for a skill belong in that skill’s `SKILL.md` after `load_skill` — avoid restating them in `buildAgentSystemPrompt` (or the opposite) unless the model must see them *before* any tool call and that cannot be achieved another way.
