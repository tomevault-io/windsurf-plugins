# Git workflow (Evotown)

## Default

- **Base branch is always `main`.** Pull latest before starting work.
- **Do not create new feature branches** (`feat/…`, `fix/…`) unless the user explicitly asks for a branch or parallel experiments.
- **Do not stack PRs** on other feature branches (e.g. PR base = `feat/…`). Every PR targets **`main`** only.

## How to ship changes

1. `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. **Open a GitHub Issue** (see `issue-pr-workflow.mdc`) unless hotfix / user says skip.
3. Implement on **`main`** (or a same-day branch the user named).
4. Commit with a clear message when the user asks to commit.
5. Push and open **one PR → `main`** with **`Closes #<issue>`** in the body, or push to `main` directly if the user says to skip PR.

## Avoid

- Opening PR #N on branch A, then PR #N+1 on branch B that depends on A not yet in `main`.
- Leaving work only on long-lived feature branches after a stacked merge.
- Force-pushing shared branches without the user asking.

## If a branch already exists

Rebase onto `origin/main` and retarget the PR to **`main`** before merge — do not merge feature stacks into other feature branches.
