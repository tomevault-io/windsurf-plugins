# Issue → PR workflow (Evotown)

## Default (follow-up work after the first merge)

For **non-trivial** changes (features, security, dispatch/connector, infra, multi-file refactors):

1. **Open a GitHub Issue first** (`gh issue create` or UI) with acceptance criteria.
2. **Implement** on `main` or a short-lived branch the user named.
3. **Open one PR → `main`** whose body includes **`Closes #<issue>`** (auto-closes on merge).
4. **One Issue ↔ one PR** scope; split large work into multiple issues/PRs instead of stacking.

## Issue content (minimum)

- **Problem / context** (why now)
- **Proposed change** (what)
- **Acceptance criteria** (checkboxes, testable)
- **Labels** when useful: `security`, `dispatch`, `docs`, `P0` / `P1`

## PR content (minimum)

- First line or section: `Closes #123` (or `Fixes #123`)
- **Summary** (1–3 bullets)
- **Test plan** (checkboxes)
- Link related docs paths if applicable

Use **`Refs #123`** only when the PR does **not** fully close the issue.

## Exceptions

- **Hotfix / same-session tiny fix**: PR first is OK; open a tracking issue immediately and add `Refs #N` before merge.
- **User explicitly says “skip issue”**: proceed without issue; note that in the PR.

## Agent behavior

- When the user asks to **commit, push, or open a PR** for substantive work: **offer or create the issue first**, then use its number in the PR body.
- Do not open a second PR for work that belongs to an already-open issue without checking existing issues/PRs.
