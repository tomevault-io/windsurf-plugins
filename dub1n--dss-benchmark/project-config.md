# Frontmatter Validation Rules

## Required Fields

All DSS files with frontmatter must include:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `tags` | Array of strings | Categorization tags following tag conventions |
| `provides` | Array of strings | Resources or concepts that the file provides |
| `requires` | Array of strings | Dependencies that the file needs from other parts |

## Field Format Rules

### Tags
- Must be an array/list, even for a single tag
- Each tag must be a string
- Tags should be lowercase with underscores for spaces
- At least one tag is required
- Example: `tags: [documentation, automation, phase1]`

### Provides
- Must be an array/list, even for a single item
- Each item must be a string
- Items should represent resources, concepts, or artifacts the file contributes
- Empty array allowed if file doesn't explicitly provide resources
- Example: `provides: [frontmatter_validation_rules, validation_schema]`

### Requires
- Must be an array/list, even for a single item
- Each item must be a string
- Items should reference existing files or resources in the project
- Empty array allowed if file has no dependencies
- For file references, use relative paths from project root
- Example: `requires: [meta/dss_config.yml, docs/automated_formatting.md]`

## Format Consistency

### Markdown Files
Frontmatter in Markdown files must:
- Begin at the very start of the file
- Start with a line containing only `---`
- End with a line containing only `---`
- Contain valid YAML between the delimiters

Example:
```markdown
---
tags: [documentation, template]
provides: [frontmatter_example]
requires: []
---

# Document Title
```

### Python Files
Frontmatter in Python files must:
- Be contained within a docstring at the beginning of the file
- Start with `"""---`
- End with `---"""`
- Contain valid YAML between the delimiters

Example:
```python
"""---
tags: [utility, automation]
provides: [frontmatter_validation]
requires: [yaml, pathlib]
---
Module description here.
"""

import yaml
from pathlib import Path
```

## Auto-correction Behavior

The frontmatter validation script can automatically correct:

1. Missing required fields → added with default values from [dss_config.yml](mdc:meta/dss_config.yml)
2. String values for tags/provides/requires → converted to single-item arrays
3. Non-string, non-array values → replaced with appropriate defaults
4. Invalid YAML → reported but cannot be auto-corrected

## Validation Integration

These rules are implemented in:
- Frontmatter validation scripts
- Pre-commit hooks for automated validation
- Documentation generators enforcing frontmatter rules
