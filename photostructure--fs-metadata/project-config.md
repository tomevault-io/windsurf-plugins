# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

@photostructure/fs-metadata - Cross-platform native Node.js module for filesystem metadata retrieval.

### Directory Structure

- `src/` - Source code (TypeScript and C++)
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output (gitignored)
- `doc/` - Static documentation (manually written, checked into git)
- `build/` - All build artifacts (gitignored)
  - `build/docs/` - Generated API documentation from TypeDoc (deployed to GitHub Pages)
- `scripts/` - Build and utility scripts
- `prebuilds/` - Prebuilt native binaries for different platforms

### Script Preferences

**Always** use TypeScript (`.ts`) scripts executed with `tsx` instead of:

- `.js` scripts (require compilation or older Node.js syntax)
- `.mjs` scripts (ESM-only, compatibility issues)
- `.cjs` scripts (CommonJS-only, less type safety)

TypeScript with tsx provides type safety, modern syntax, and seamless execution.

## Critical Knowledge

### Testing File System Metadata

**Never** expect exact equality for dynamic values (`available`, `used`) between calls. Only verify:

- Value exists and has correct type: `typeof result.available === 'number'`
- Test static properties (`size`, `mountFrom`, `fstype`) for exact equality
- Avoid range assertions (`available > 0`) - file changes can be dramatic

### Cross-Module Compatibility

Use `_dirname()` from `./dirname` instead of `__dirname` - works in both CommonJS and ESM contexts.

### Node.js Version Compatibility

Jest 30 doesn't support Node.js 23. Use Node.js 20, 22, or 24.

## System Volume Detection

**IMPORTANT: Read `doc/system-volume-detection.md` before modifying any system volume detection logic.** It documents the full detection strategy across all platforms, including flag matrices and rationale for each approach.

Summary:

- The root `/` is a sealed, read-only APFS snapshot whose **UUID changes on every OS update** — never use it for persistent identification.
- **Primary detection** combines mount flags with APFS volume roles: `MNT_SNAPSHOT || (MNT_DONTBROWSE && hasApfsRole && role != "Data")`. See `ClassifyMacVolume()` in `src/darwin/system_volume.h`.
- The APFS role string is exposed as `volumeRole` on `MountPoint` and `VolumeMetadata`.
- **Fallback** uses `MNT_SNAPSHOT` only from `statfs` `f_flags` if DA session creation fails.
- `MNT_DONTBROWSE` is safe to use **only when combined with a non-Data APFS role**. The Data volume (`/System/Volumes/Data`) has `MNT_DONTBROWSE` but role `"Data"`, so it is correctly excluded.
- Pseudo-filesystems like `devfs` (no IOMedia, no APFS role) are caught by TypeScript fstype/path heuristics.

## Windows-Specific Issues

### Windows CI Jest Worker Failures

**Problem**: Jest worker processes fail on Windows CI environments (both x64 and ARM64) with "Jest worker encountered 4 child process exceptions".

**Solution for Memory Tests**:

Memory tests now use a standalone TypeScript runner (`src/test-utils/memory-test-runner.ts`) that bypasses Jest entirely on all platforms. This provides more accurate memory measurements without Jest overhead and avoids worker process issues.

- Run full memory check suite (includes native tools): `npm run check:memory`
- Memory test logic is in `src/test-utils/memory-test-core.ts`

**Workaround for Other Tests**:

1. Jest is configured to use single worker mode (`maxWorkers: 1`) for all Windows CI environments
2. Tests that stress worker threads or concurrency are skipped on Windows CI using `describeSkipWindowsCI` or `describePlatformStable`:

- `worker_threads.test.ts` - Worker thread integration tests
- `thread_safety.test.ts` - Concurrent operations stress tests
- `windows-memory-check.test.ts` - Memory leak detection (Windows only)
- `windows-resource-security.test.ts` - Resource handle leak tests (Windows only)

**Note**: These tests pass locally but fail in CI. The native module loads correctly, but Jest's worker process management has fundamental incompatibilities with these specific tests on GitHub Actions Windows runners.

### Build Architecture Issue

**Problem**: "No Target Architecture" error from Windows SDK headers when building with node-gyp/prebuildify.

**Solution**: Use `scripts/prebuildify-wrapper.ts` which sets the `CL` environment variable with architecture defines:

- For x64: `CL=/D_M_X64 /D_WIN64 /D_AMD64_`
- For ARM64: `CL=/D_M_ARM64 /D_WIN64`

**Why This is Necessary**:

- Prebuildify doesn't properly pass architecture defines from binding.gyp conditions
- The Windows SDK requires these macros before including `<windows.h>`
- Projects like node-sqlite avoid this by not using Windows headers directly

**Why Other Approaches Failed**:

- **Source file defines**: Would hardcode x64 defines, breaking ARM64 builds
- **windows_compat.h wrapper**: Can't distinguish x64 from ARM64 at compile time
- **binding.gyp conditions**: Not evaluated properly by prebuildify
- **msvs_settings defines**: Not passed through to the compiler

### Memory Testing Limitations

Traditional Windows tools **do not work** with Node.js native modules:

- **Dr. Memory**: Fails with "Unable to load client library: ucrtbase.dll"
