Lean Pool sits between [`mathlib`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) and [`merely-true`](https://github.com/merely-true/merely-true), preserving Lean 4 formalizations that don't fit mathlib's scope. Instead of mathlib's high-bar human review, it relies on deterministic linters and LLM judgment, so it can grow faster while staying `sorry`-free and pinned to the latest Mathlib. See [`MOTIVATION.md`](MOTIVATION.md) for the why, and browse the API docs at <https://vilin97.github.io/lean-pool/>.

So far, projects have been added by hand: each is a suitable, permissively licensed (Apache-2.0 or MIT) Lean repository, bumped to the latest Lean and Mathlib, made to pass [CI](.github/workflows/lean_action_ci.yml) — it builds warning-free and clears Mathlib's linters, the style checker, and the repository quality gates (no `sorry`/`admit`, no axioms beyond `Classical.choice`/`propext`/`Quot.sound`, no `unsafe`/`partial`, file headers, size limits) — and an [LLM review](.github/REVIEW_RULES.md) of fit and significance, then merged.

### Getting started

Requires Lean (via [`elan`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/), with the toolchain pinned in [`lean-toolchain`](lean-toolchain)) and Python 3.13+ with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
make setup    # pull Mathlib oleans, build the whole pool (~1.5h), install Python tooling
```

To work on a single project you don't need the whole pool built — see the
[fast per-project build](CONTRIBUTING.md#dev-setup) in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

# Contributing to Lean Pool

Lean Pool welcomes serious, medium- to large-scale formalizations of mathematics and related disciplines (see [`MOTIVATION.md`](MOTIVATION.md)). Browse [`LeanPool/`](LeanPool/) for examples and [`candidates/CRITERIA.txt`](candidates/CRITERIA.txt) for what we include.

## Opt out

If you would like to withdraw your project from Lean Pool, open an issue.

## Submitting a project

There are two paths:

- **Propose a repo.** Open an issue with the GitHub URL and a maintainer can import it. Repos that Reservoir does not index can be added to [`candidates/manual.txt`](candidates/manual.txt).
- **Open a content PR.** Add your project under `LeanPool/<YourProject>/`, register it in [`LeanPool/projects.yml`](LeanPool/projects.yml), and regenerate the index with `lake exe mk_all`.

Either way the result must pass CI (build, linters, and quality checks — see [Linting and testing](#linting-and-testing)) and an [LLM review](.github/REVIEW_RULES.md) of fit and significance. Accepted projects must be `sorry`-free, introduce no axioms beyond `Classical.choice`/`propext`/`Quot.sound`, and avoid `unsafe`/`partial`. (Proof profiling via `/profile` is available but informational, not a gate.)

## Dev setup

Requires Lean (via [`elan`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/), with the toolchain pinned in [`lean-toolchain`](lean-toolchain)) and Python 3.13+ with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
make setup            # pull Mathlib oleans, build the whole pool (~1.5h), install Python tooling
cd python && uv sync  # Python tooling only; add `--group test` for pytest
```

`make setup` builds every project in the pool, which takes about 1.5 hours from cold. **You almost never need that.** The projects are independent — none imports another — so to work on one project you only need Mathlib's prebuilt oleans plus your own project:

```bash
lake exe cache get                # prebuilt Mathlib oleans (fast)
lake build LeanPool.YourProject   # builds only your project — minutes, not hours
# or: make build-project P=YourProject
```

The whole-library checks (`lake exe runLinter LeanPool`, `lake exe lint-style LeanPool`, the quality checker) do need the full pool built, but CI runs them on your PR — you don't have to reproduce them locally.
