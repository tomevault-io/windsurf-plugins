## Workflow Guidance

Use the **swarm skill** for any task that isn't trivially simple.

The swarm skill spawns multiple agents that work in parallel with built-in review gates, making it ideal for:
- Adding new features
- Refactoring code
- Bug fixes that touch multiple files
- Adding tests
- Code migrations
- Any multi-step implementation work

Only skip the swarm for truly trivial tasks like:
- Single-line fixes
- Typo corrections
- Simple config changes
