# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Divine Ascension is a Vintage Story mod implementing deity-driven religion and civilization systems. Built with .NET 8 (C# 12) and the Vintage Story API, it includes dual progression (Favor/Prestige), blessing trees with stat modifiers, civilization alliances, PvP integration, and a full ImGui-based UI.

**Key Technologies:**
- .NET SDK 8.0, C# 12
- Vintage Story API 1.21.0
- VSImGui 0.0.6 (ImGui integration)
- protobuf-net (networking)
- Harmony (runtime patching)
- xUnit v3 (testing)
- Cake build system

## Environment Setup

### Vintage Story API

**Required:** Set `VINTAGE_STORY` environment variable pointing to a Vintage Story installation containing:
- `VintagestoryAPI.dll`
- `Lib/0Harmony.dll`, `Lib/cairo-sharp.dll`, `Lib/Newtonsoft.Json.dll`, `Lib/protobuf-net.dll`
- `Mods/VSEssentials.dll`, `Mods/VSSurvivalMod.dll`

Examples:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
export VINTAGE_STORY="$HOME/.local/share/Vintagestory"

# Windows PowerShell
$env:VINTAGE_STORY = "C:\Games\Vintagestory"
```

## Common Commands

### Building

```bash
# Full Cake build with packaging (outputs to Releases/)
./build.sh              # Linux/macOS
./build.ps1             # Windows

# Quick solution build
dotnet build DivineAscension.sln -c Debug
dotnet build DivineAscension.sln -c Release
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run specific test class by fully qualified name (preferred)
dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~DivineAscension.Tests.GUI.UI.Utilities.DeityHelperTests

# Run tests matching a pattern
dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~BlessingRegistry

# Generate coverage report (auto-installs ReportGenerator and opens HTML)
./generate-coverage.sh

# Manual coverage collection
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings coverlet.runsettings
```

**Note:** The coverage script references "PantheonWars" (legacy name) but works correctly. Coverage HTML opens at `coverage-report/index.html`.

## Architecture Overview

### Initialization Flow

**Entry Point:** `DivineAscensionModSystem.cs` (inherits `ModSystem`)
- **Start (Common):** Initializes ProfanityFilterService, registers Harmony patches, registers 20+ network packet types on channel `"divineascension"`
- **StartServerSide:** Calls `DivineAscensionSystemInitializer.InitializeServerSystems()` to initialize all managers, initializes LocalizationService
- **StartClientSide:** Sets up `DivineAscensionNetworkClient` and `UiService` for UI dialogs, initializes LocalizationService
- **Dispose:** Unpatches Harmony, disposes managers and network handlers

**CRITICAL INITIALIZATION ORDER** (in `DivineAscensionSystemInitializer.cs`):
0. `LocalizationService` - Multi-language support (must initialize before managers that use localized messages)
1. `CooldownManager` - Cooldown tracking (early initialization to prevent griefing attacks)
2. `ReligionManager` - Religion CRUD and membership with O(1) player-to-religion index
3. **Deity name migration** - Migrates existing religions with empty deity names (backward compatibility)
4. `ActivityLogManager` - Activity log tracking (depends on ReligionManager)
5. `CivilizationManager` - Civilization management (depends on ReligionManager)
6. `PlayerMessengerService` - Player messaging (after managers are initialized)
7. `PlayerProgressionDataManager` - Per-player data
8. `ReligionPrestigeManager` - Religion-level progression (**MUST be initialized before FavorSystem**)
9. `HolySiteManager` - Holy site management (depends on ReligionManager)
10. `AltarPlacementHandler` - Automatic holy site creation on altar placement (depends on HolySiteManager)
11. `AltarDestructionHandler` - Automatic holy site deconsecration on altar destruction (depends on HolySiteManager)
12. `FavorSystem` - Divine favor rewards (depends on PrestigeManager and ActivityLogManager)
13. `OfferingLoader` - Loads offering configurations from JSON (must be before AltarPrayerHandler)
14. `RitualLoader` - Loads ritual definitions from JSON (must be before RitualProgressManager)
15. `MilestoneDefinitionLoader` - Loads milestone definitions from JSON (must be before CivilizationMilestoneManager)
16. `BuffManager` - Buff system for temporary stat modifiers (must be before AltarPrayerHandler)
17. `PlayerProgressionService` - Facade for favor/prestige/activity systems (must be before AltarPrayerHandler)
18. `RitualProgressManager` - Handles ritual tracking for holy site tier upgrades (depends on RitualLoader)
19. `CivilizationMilestoneManager` - Tracks civilization milestone progression (depends on CivilizationManager, HolySiteManager, MilestoneDefinitionLoader)
20. `CivilizationBonusSystem` - Provides civilization-wide bonuses from milestones (depends on CivilizationMilestoneManager)
21. `AltarPrayerHandler` - Prayer interactions at altars (depends on many systems above)
22. `DiplomacyManager` - Inter-civilization diplomacy
23. `PvPManager` - PvP favor rewards
24. `BlessingRegistry` - Blessing definitions
25. `BlessingEffectSystem` - Stat modifiers and effects (**must register with PrestigeManager after initialization**)
26. Command handlers (Favor, Blessing, Religion, Role, Civilization, HolySite)
27. Network handlers (PlayerData, Blessing, Religion, Civilization, Diplomacy, Activity, HolySite, Milestone)
28. **Membership validation** - Validates and repairs player-to-religion index consistency

**Late-binding dependencies** (called after initial construction to resolve circular dependencies):
- `civilizationMilestoneManager.SetRitualProgressManager(ritualProgressManager)` - Subscribe to ritual completion events
- `civilizationMilestoneManager.SetPvPManager(pvpManager)` - Subscribe to PvP kill events
- `favorSystem.SetCivilizationBonusSystem(civilizationBonusSystem)` - Apply favor multipliers from milestones
- `holySiteManager.SetCivilizationBonusSystem(civilizationBonusSystem)` - Apply holy site slot bonuses from milestones
- `pvpManager.SetCivilizationBonusSystem(civilizationBonusSystem)` - Apply conquest multipliers from milestones

**Never reorder these** - dependency chains will break.

- Blessing definitions stored in `assets/divineascension/config/blessings/*.json` (5 files: craft.json, wild.json, conquest.json, harvest.json, stone.json)
- Query by domain, type (player/religion)
- Validates unlock eligibility (rank, prerequisites, domain match)

**BlessingEffectSystem** (`/Systems/BlessingEffectSystem.cs`):
- Applies stat modifiers from unlocked blessings
- Manages special effects via handlers in `/Systems/BlessingEffects/Handlers/`
- Caches stat modifiers per player for performance
- Special effect handlers: `AethraEffectHandlers`, `GaiaEffectHandlers`, `KhorasEffectHandlers`, `LysaEffectHandlers`, `ConquestEffectHandlers`

**ReligionPrestigeManager** (`/Systems/ReligionPrestigeManager.cs`):
- Religion-level progression (Fledgling → Divine)
- Awards prestige for member actions
- Unlocks religion-level blessings

**ActivityLogManager** (`/Systems/ActivityLogManager.cs`):
- Tracks religion activity feed with favor/prestige awards
- Bounded storage (100 entries per religion, FIFO eviction)

- Step discovery mechanic: steps start hidden ("??? Undiscovered") and are revealed when players offer matching items
- Tracks multi-player contributions to active rituals (per step, aggregated across requirements)
- Auto-starts rituals when qualifying items are offered at altars (auto-discovery mechanic)
- Validates ritual requirements using `RitualMatcher` with glob pattern support
- Awards 50% favor/prestige for ritual contributions (half of normal prayer rewards)
- Ritual offerings bypass prayer cooldown to encourage participation
- Handles ritual completion and tier upgrades (Shrine → Temple → Cathedral)
- Steps can be completed in any order; ritual completes when all steps are complete
- Ritual cancellation (founder-only, no refunds)
- Persists ritual progress in `HolySiteData.ActiveRitual` with step-level tracking (IsDiscovered, IsComplete flags)

### Command System

**Command handlers** (`/Commands/`):
- `ReligionCommands.cs` - Religion CRUD, membership, bans, prestige, deity name management
- `CivilizationCommands.cs` - Civilization management, invites
- `BlessingCommands.cs` - Blessing unlocks and queries
- `FavorCommands.cs` - Player favor and admin commands
- `RoleCommands.cs` - Role assignment and management
- `ConfigCommands.cs` - Admin-only mod configuration (profanity filter toggle)
- `CommandHelpers.cs` - Shared validation utilities

**Custom Parsers** (`/Commands/Parsers/`):
- `QuotedStringParser.cs` - Handles names with spaces via quotes (e.g., `"My Religion"`)
- `CommandParserExtensions.cs` - Extension methods: `QuotedString()`, `OptionalQuotedString()`

**Usage:** Commands use Vintage Story's fluent API with custom parsers for name arguments:
```csharp
.WithArgs(_sapi.ChatCommands.Parsers.QuotedString("name"))  // Required quoted string
.WithArgs(_sapi.ChatCommands.Parsers.OptionalQuotedString("name"))  // Optional
```

Users can specify names as `"Name With Spaces"` or `SingleWord` (backward compatible).

### Networking Architecture

**All packets use channel:** `"divineascension"`

**Server-side handlers** (in `/Systems/Networking/Server/`):
- `PlayerDataNetworkHandler` - Player sync, info requests
- `ReligionNetworkHandler` - Religion operations (~40KB file with all CRUD)
- `BlessingNetworkHandler` - Blessing unlocks, tree queries
- `CivilizationNetworkHandler` - Civilization management

**Client-side handler:** `DivineAscensionNetworkClient.cs`
- Receives responses, broadcasts events to UI
- Events: `PlayerReligionDataUpdated`, `BlessingUnlocked`, `ReligionStateChanged`, etc.

**Packet types** (20+): Request/response pattern for player data, religions, blessings, civilizations, roles. All in `/Network/` directory.

### GUI/UI System

**Main Dialog:** `GuiDialog.cs` (ImGui-based `ModSystem`)
- Hotkey: Shift+G
- Window size: 1400x900 base
- Architecture: `GuiDialog` → `GuiDialogManager` → Tab-specific state managers

**State Managers** (`/GUI/State/`):
- `GuiDialogState` - Main state machine
- `ReligionTabState`, `BlessingTabState`, `CivilizationTabState`
- Subtabs: `ActivityState`, `BrowseState`, `CreateState`, `InfoState`

**Renderers** (`/GUI/UI/Renderers/`):
- Component renderers: buttons, checkboxes, lists, progress bars
- Domain renderers: religions, blessings, civilizations (browse/create/info/detail)

**Pattern:** Events → ViewModel → RenderResult → Renderer

**UI Service:** `UiService.cs` - Injectable API for dialogs using `DivineAscensionNetworkClient`

**Icon Loaders** (`/GUI/UI/Utilities/`): `DeityIconLoader`, `BlessingIconLoader`, `CivilizationIconLoader`, `GuiIconLoader`

**Domain/Deity Helpers** (`/GUI/UI/Utilities/`): `DomainHelper` (domain enum utilities), `DeityInfoHelper` (deity display info)

### Buff/Stat Modifier System

**BuffManager** (`/Systems/BuffSystem/BuffManager.cs`):
- Applies/removes temporary buffs with stat modifiers
- Manages duration and expiration
- Integrates with blessing stat modifiers

**EntityBehaviorBuffTracker** (`/Systems/BuffSystem/EntityBehaviorBuffTracker.cs`):
- Attached to entities via `"DivineAscensionBuffTracker"` behavior class
- Tracks active effects, applies stat modifiers
- Handles cleanup on expiration

### Block Behaviors

**Pattern:** BlockBehavior with Service Locator for event emission

Divine Ascension uses BlockBehavior to extend vanilla blocks. BlockBehaviors are attached via JSON patches and emit events that handlers subscribe to.

**BlockBehaviorAltar** (`/Blocks/BlockBehaviorAltar.cs`):
- Attached to: Vanilla altar blocks via JSON patch (`assets/divineascension/patches/altar.json`)
- Intercepts: `OnBlockInteractStart` (right-click), `OnBlockBroken` (destruction), `DoPlaceBlock` (placement)
- Events: `OnAltarUsed`, `OnAltarBroken`, `OnAltarPlaced` (via `AltarEventEmitter`)
- Handlers:
  - `AltarPrayerHandler` - Prayer interactions and offerings
  - `AltarDestructionHandler` - Automatic holy site deconsecration on destruction
  - `AltarPlacementHandler` - Automatic holy site creation from land claims

**BlockBehaviorStone** (`/Blocks/BlockBehaviorStone.cs`):
- Attached to: Vanilla stone blocks via JSON patch (`assets/divineascension/patches/stone.json`)
- Intercepts: `GetDrops` (drop quantity modification), `OnBlockBroken` (event emission)
- Applies `StoneYield` stat bonus to drop multipliers
- Static event: `OnStoneBlockBroken` for handlers to subscribe
- Covers all 23 rock variants (granite, basalt, marble, etc.)

**Service Locator Pattern:**
- BlockBehavior constructors don't support DI (only receive `Block` instance)
- `AltarEventEmitter` acts as static service locator initialized in `DivineAscensionSystemInitializer`
- Allows handlers to keep full DI support while BlockBehavior emits events
- Initialized via `BlockBehaviorAltar.SetEventEmitter(altarEventEmitter)` in `DivineAscensionSystemInitializer.cs`
- Cleaned up via `AltarEventEmitter.ClearSubscribers()` and `BlockBehaviorStone.ClearSubscribers()` in `DivineAscensionModSystem.Dispose()`

**JSON Patch Structure:**
```json
{
  "op": "addmerge",
  "path": "/behaviors/-",
  "value": { "name": "DivineAscensionAltar" },
  "file": "game:blocktypes/stone/generic/altar.json",
  "side": "Server"
}
```
**Important:**
- File path requires `game:` domain prefix for vanilla game assets
- Use `"op": "addmerge"` instead of `"add"` for better mod compatibility (v1.19.4+)
- `side` is capitalized: `"Server"` not `"server"`
- BlockBehavior class must be `public` (not `internal`) for Vintage Story to instantiate it
- BlockBehavior must be registered via `api.RegisterBlockBehaviorClass()` in `ModSystem.Start()`
- Single patch applies to all block variants generated from the base file

**Block Placement Lifecycle:**
- `DoPlaceBlock` (Step 3) is used instead of `OnBlockPlaced` (Step 4) because it provides player context
- `OnBlockPlaced` lacks player/itemstack parameters and is called for all placements (including worldgen)
- `DoPlaceBlock` is called during manual placement and has full context for event emission

### Harmony Patches

**Patch classes** (`/Systems/Patches/`):
- `AnvilPatches`, `BlockCropPatches`, `ClayFormingPatches`, `CookingPatches`, `CraftPatches`, `CropPlantingPatches`, `EatingPatches`, `FlowerPatches`, `ForagingPatches`, `MoldPourPatches`, `MushroomPatches`, `PitKilnPatches`, `SkinningPatches`, `StonePatches`
- **Pattern:** Intercept game methods with Harmony, raise events that favor trackers subscribe to
- **Note:** Altar-related Harmony patches (`AltarPatches`, `AltarBlockPatches`) have been replaced by `BlockBehaviorAltar`
- **Note:** `StonePatches` provides stone/clay yield bonuses via Harmony prefix on `Block.OnBlockBroken`

### Data Persistence

All data stored via Vintage Story's world save system with ProtoBuf serialization (`[ProtoContract]` attributes):
- `ReligionWorldData` - All religions
- `CivilizationWorldData` - All civilizations
- `PlayerProgressionData` - Per-player progression data (loaded on join, DataVersion=4)
  - Player religion membership tracked via ReligionManager's player-to-religion index

Events: `SaveGameLoaded` (load), `GameWorldSave` (persist)

### Services

**LocalizationService** (`/Services/LocalizationService.cs`):
- Singleton service for multi-language support
- Loads translations from `assets/divineascension/lang/*.json`
- Server-side: Loads JSON directly
- Client-side: Uses Vintage Story's `Lang` API
- Thread-safe caching for performance
- Format string support with parameter substitution

**ProfanityFilterService** (`/Services/ProfanityFilterService.cs`):
- Singleton service for content moderation
- Filters inappropriate content in religion/civilization names, deity names, and descriptions
- Loads word list from embedded resource or mod assets (server-configurable)
- Case-insensitive whole-word matching with O(1) HashSet lookups
- L33t speak detection (e.g., `$h1t`, `4ss`) and repetition collapse (e.g., `shiiiit`)
- Integrated at all creation entry points (commands and network handlers)
- Can be enabled/disabled per-world via `/da config profanityfilter [on|off]` (admin only)
- See `docs/topics/configuration/profanity-filter.md` for detailed documentation
- Default word lists in `assets/divineascension/config/profanity/` (en.txt, de.txt, es.txt, fr.txt, ru.txt)

**BlessingLoader** (`/Services/BlessingLoader.cs`):
- Loads blessing definitions from JSON assets following `LocalizationService` pattern
- Implements `IBlessingLoader` interface for dependency injection and testing
- Reads from `assets/divineascension/config/blessings/{domain}.json` (craft, wild, conquest, harvest, stone)
- Validates domain, kind, and category enums during deserialization
- Logs warnings for unknown stat keys but still includes blessings
- DTOs: `BlessingJsonDto` (individual blessing), `BlessingFileDto` (file structure with domain and version)

**RitualLoader** (`/Services/RitualLoader.cs`):
- Loads ritual definitions from JSON assets following `LocalizationService` pattern
- Implements `IRitualLoader` interface for dependency injection and testing
- Reads from `assets/divineascension/config/rituals/{domain}.json` (craft, wild, conquest, harvest, stone)
- Validates domain enums, requirement types, and step count (3-5 steps required per ritual) during deserialization
- Builds indices by domain, ritual ID, and tier upgrade (source tier → target tier)
- Supports two requirement types: Exact (specific item codes) and Category (glob patterns like `game:ingot-*`)
- DTOs: `RitualJsonDto` (individual ritual), `RitualStepJsonDto` (step with nested requirements), `RitualFileJsonDto` (file structure with domain and version)
- Step-based structure: each ritual has 3-5 steps, each step has a name, ID, and list of requirements
- Used by `RitualProgressManager` for ritual validation and auto-discovery

### API Wrapper Layer

**Purpose:** Thin abstraction layer over Vintage Story's API for improved testability and maintainability.

**Location:** `/DivineAscension/API/` directory with `/Interfaces/` and `/Implementation/` subdirectories

**Design Principles:**
- Thin wrappers with minimal logic (direct pass-through to underlying API)
- Interface segregation (each wrapper focuses on specific API surface)
- Constructor-based dependency injection
- Test-friendly interfaces for easy mocking/faking

**Tier 1 - Critical Wrappers:**

1. **IEventService** (`ServerEventService`) - Wraps `IServerEventAPI`
   - Event subscriptions: `OnSaveGameLoaded`, `OnGameWorldSave`, `OnPlayerJoin`, `OnPlayerDisconnect`, `OnPlayerDeath`
   - Game events: `OnBreakBlock`, `OnDidUseBlock`, `OnDidPlaceBlock`
   - Periodic callbacks: `RegisterGameTickListener`, `RegisterCallback`, `UnregisterCallback`
   - Test double: `FakeEventService` with `Trigger*()` methods to manually fire events

2. **IWorldService** (`ServerWorldService`) - Wraps `IServerWorldAccessor`
   - Player access: `GetPlayerByUID`, `GetPlayerByName`, `GetAllOnlinePlayers`
   - Block access: `GetBlock(BlockPos)`, `GetBlock(int)`, `GetBlockEntity`, `HasBlock`
   - World interaction: `SpawnItemEntity`, `PlaySoundAt`
   - Test double: `FakeWorldService` with in-memory player/block storage

3. **IPersistenceService** (`ServerPersistenceService`) - Wraps `IWorldManagerAPI.SaveGame`
   - Generic save/load: `Load<T>(key)`, `Save<T>(key, data)`
   - Raw byte access: `LoadRaw`, `SaveRaw`
   - Utilities: `Exists`, `Delete`
   - Test double: `FakePersistenceService` with in-memory dictionary storage

4. **INetworkService** (`ServerNetworkService`) - Wraps `IServerNetworkChannel`
   - Handler registration: `RegisterMessageHandler<T>(handler)`
   - Sending: `SendToPlayer<T>`, `SendToAllPlayers<T>`, `Broadcast<T>`
   - Test double: `SpyNetworkService` with `SentMessages` list and `SimulateMessage<T>()` helper

5. **ITimeService** (`ServerTimeService`) - Wraps `IServerWorldAccessor` time access
   - Time access: `ElapsedMilliseconds` property
   - Provides monotonically increasing timestamp for absolute time tracking
   - Used for cooldowns, expiry times, and time-dependent logic
   - Test double: `FakeTimeService` with `SetElapsedMilliseconds()`, `AdvanceTimeBy()`, and `Reset()` methods

**Tier 2 - High Value Wrappers:**

6. **IPlayerMessengerService** (`PlayerMessengerService`) - Wraps player messaging
   - Basic messaging: `SendMessage(player, message, type)`, `SendGroupMessage(groupId, message, type)`
   - Test double: `SpyPlayerMessenger` with `SentMessages` list

**Tier 3 - Specialized Wrappers:**

7. **IModLoaderService** (`ModLoaderService`) - Wraps `IModLoader`
   - Mod checks: `IsModEnabled(modId)`
   - Mod system access: `GetModSystem<T>()`, `GetModSystemByName(name)`
   - Test double: `FakeModLoaderService` with configurable enabled mods and registered systems

8. **IInputService** (`ClientInputService`) - Wraps `IInputAPI` (client-side only)
   - Hotkey management: `RegisterHotKey`, `SetHotKeyHandler`, `UnregisterHotKey`
   - Test double: `FakeInputService` with `SimulateHotKeyPress()` helper

9. **IChatCommandService** (`ServerChatCommandService`) - Wraps `IChatCommand` API
   - Command registration: `Create(commandName)` returns fluent builder interface
   - Provides custom parsers: `QuotedString()`, `OptionalQuotedString()` for names with spaces
   - Handles command hierarchy with subcommands via `BeginSubCommand()`/`EndSubCommand()`
   - Test double: `FakeChatCommandService` with `RegisteredCommands` list and `SimulateCommand()` helper

**Usage Pattern:**
```csharp
// Constructor injection
public ReligionManager(
    IEventService eventService,
    IPersistenceService persistenceService,
    IWorldService worldService,
    ...)
{
    _eventService = eventService;
    // ...
}

// Event subscription
public void Initialize()
{
    _eventService.OnSaveGameLoaded(LoadFromWorldData);
    _eventService.OnGameWorldSave(SaveToWorldData);
}

// Persistence
private void LoadFromWorldData()
{
    var data = _persistenceService.Load<ReligionWorldData>("religions");
    // ...
}
```

**Testing Pattern:**
```csharp
[Fact]
public void CreateReligion_Success_SavesData()
{
    // Arrange - use fakes instead of 15+ mocks
    var eventService = new FakeEventService();
    var persistence = new FakePersistenceService();
    var worldService = new FakeWorldService();

    var manager = new ReligionManager(eventService, persistence, worldService, ...);

    // Act
    var result = manager.CreateReligion("player1", "Test Religion", ...);

    // Assert - direct access to in-memory storage
    var saved = persistence.Load<ReligionWorldData>("religions");
    Assert.NotNull(saved);
    Assert.Single(saved.Religions);
}
```

**Test Doubles Location:** `/DivineAscension.Tests/Helpers/`
- `FakeEventService`, `FakeWorldService`, `FakePersistenceService`, `FakeModLoaderService`, `FakeInputService`
- `SpyNetworkService`, `SpyPlayerMessenger`

**Documentation:** See `docs/topics/implementation/api-wrappers.md` for comprehensive guide

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Reduced mock complexity from 15-20 mocks to 3-5 wrappers per test (70% reduction)
- Test execution speed improved by 80% (500ms → 100ms average)
- Event-driven logic now fully testable without complex mock setups
- Clear separation between framework and domain logic

## Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Manager/Registry Pattern** - All systems use manager classes for state/operations; registries provide lookups
2. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Systems communicate via events (e.g., `OnReligionDeleted`, `OnPlayerDataChanged`)
3. **Dependency Injection** - Managers passed via constructor, loosely coupled via interfaces
4. **Server-Client Separation** - Server manages state, client handles UI; communication via async packets
5. **Caching** - `BlessingEffectSystem` caches stat modifiers per player
6. **Data Models (Immutable Records)** - Clean separation of data from logic, ProtoBuf serializable
7. **ViewModel/Renderer Pattern (UI)** - ViewModels compute state, renderers handle ImGui drawing
8. **Permission Systems** - Religion and Civilization use different permission models:
   - **Religion Permissions:**
     - **Role-Based System:** Most operations use `RoleManager` with configurable roles
     - Members can be assigned roles with different permission sets
     - **Founder-Only Actions:** Critical operations (disband, transfer founder) require founder status
     - Founder validation: `religion.FounderUID == playerUID`
   - **Civilization Permissions:**
     - **Founder-Only System:** No role system - all admin actions require founder status
     - Actions include: edit description, edit icon, invite religions, kick religions, disband
     - Founder validation: `civilization.FounderUID == playerUID`
   - **Founder Validation Pattern (Both):**
     - **Server-Side:** Always validates using `entity.FounderUID == playerUID`
       - Single source of truth: `FounderUID` property on data model
       - Checked in managers, commands, and network handlers
       - Never trust client for permission checks
     - **Client-Side (GUI):** Mirrors server validation
       - Compares current player's UID with entity's FounderUID
       - Used to show/hide UI elements (edit buttons, admin panels)
       - Cached in state managers for performance
   - **Anti-Pattern:** Never compare religion UIDs to determine founder status
     - Religion UIDs are shared by all members
     - Only player UIDs uniquely identify the founder
     - Example: `player.ReligionUID == civ.FounderReligionUID` is WRONG
9. **Periodic Callbacks** - Systems can register time-based callbacks for periodic scanning/processing
   - Use `_sapi.Event.RegisterCallback(callback, intervalMs)` to register
   - Returns callback ID for later unregistration
   - Use `_sapi.Event.UnregisterCallback(callbackId)` in Dispose()
   - Example: `RuinDiscoveryFavorTracker` scans for ruins every 500ms

## Important Constraints

1. **Initialization order is critical** - See initialization section above
2. **Single network channel** - All packets share `"divineascension"` channel
3. **Civilization limits** - 1-4 religions per civilization (each must have different domain)
4. **Favor rank persistence** - Favor rank tied to lifetime favor earned, persists across religion changes
5. **Blessing prerequisites** - Can require other blessings unlocked first
6. **Domain-bound blessings** - Only unlock if player's religion matches the blessing's domain
7. **Single source of truth** - ReligionManager is authoritative for membership; PlayerProgressionData queries it
8. **InternalsVisibleTo** - Main project exposes internals to tests via `[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("DivineAscension.Tests")]`
9. **Domain vs Deity Name** - `DeityDomain` enum (Craft, Wild, Conquest, Harvest, Stone) defines mechanics; `DeityName` string is customizable display name

## Development Practices

- C# 12 with `ImplicitUsings` and `Nullable` enabled
- Keep types `internal` when appropriate (tests have access via `InternalsVisibleTo`)
- Place new tests under `DivineAscension.Tests/<Area>/` with namespaces matching folder structure
- Test framework: xUnit v3 with Moq for mocking
- Inject clocks and random sources for deterministic testing (avoid time/randomness flakiness)

## Troubleshooting

- **Build errors about missing Vintage Story DLLs** → Verify `VINTAGE_STORY` env var is set and points to correct directory. Restart shell so `dotnet` inherits the variable.
- **Coverage script doesn't open report** → Manually open `coverage-report/index.html`
- **Test failures tied to time/randomness** → Inject clocks and random sources for determinism
- **Harmony patches not applying** → Check patch initialization in `DivineAscensionModSystem.Start()` and verify target methods exist in Vintage Story API version
