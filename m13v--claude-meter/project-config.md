# Codex-meter — project instructions

## Releasing a new version

**A release is NOT complete until a signed, notarized DMG is uploaded to a GitHub release for the new tag.** The download endpoint at `Codex-meter.com/api/download` resolves the latest `.dmg` asset from `api.github.com/repos/m13v/Codex-meter/releases/latest`. Skipping the GitHub release step means every email-gated download link keeps serving the previous version, even after the new tag is pushed. This bit us on v0.3.0 (2026-05-13): the website served 0.2.4 because the new tag had no DMG asset.

### The full pipeline (do all of it, in order)

1. **Bump version** in `Cargo.toml` (and let `cargo check` update `Cargo.lock`).
2. **Commit** the bump: `git commit -m "chore: release v<VERSION>"`.
3. **Tag**: `git tag v<VERSION>`.
4. **Push branch + tag**: `git push origin main && git push origin v<VERSION>`.
5. **Run `bash scripts/release.sh`.** This builds, codesigns (Developer ID), notarizes, staples, builds the DMG, notarizes the DMG, publishes the GitHub release with DMG + zip uploaded, AND bumps the homebrew tap (`m13v/homebrew-tap → Casks/Codex-meter.rb`). 9 steps total as of 2026-05-13.
6. **Verify**: `curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/m13v/Codex-meter/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name + " — " + (.assets | map(.name) | join(", "))'` must show the new tag and a `.dmg` asset. Also `brew bump-cask-pr --version=… --dry-run m13v/tap/Codex-meter` or just `cat ~/homebrew-tap/Casks/Codex-meter.rb` to confirm the cask points at the new version + sha256.

### Required toolchain on PATH

`scripts/release.sh` needs the following binaries on `PATH`:

- `cargo` (from `~/.cargo/bin`)
- `rsvg-convert` (from `librsvg`, in `/opt/homebrew/bin`)
- `iconutil` (Xcode CLT)
- `codesign`, `xcrun notarytool`, `xcrun stapler`, `hdiutil` (Xcode CLT)
- `gh` (GitHub CLI, in `/opt/homebrew/bin`)

If launching from a non-login shell (e.g., a Codex bash sandbox), prepend `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"` before invoking the script.

### Notarization profile

The script uses keychain profile `Codex-meter-notary` for `xcrun notarytool`. If it's missing, recreate it with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials Codex-meter-notary --apple-id … --team-id S6DP5HF77G --password <app-specific-password>`.

### Skip flags (only for debugging)

- `SKIP_DMG_NOTARIZE=1` — sign the DMG but skip its notarization (zip is still notarized + stapled). Don't use for real releases.
- `SKIP_GH_RELEASE=1` — skip the GitHub release publish step. Don't use for real releases; the website will serve the stale version.
- `SKIP_BREW_TAP=1` — skip the homebrew tap bump. Don't use for real releases; `brew upgrade --cask m13v/tap/Codex-meter` will keep installing the old version.

### Homebrew tap

`brew install --cask m13v/tap/Codex-meter` points at the `m13v/homebrew-tap` repo. `scripts/release.sh` step [9/9] auto-bumps `Casks/Codex-meter.rb` (version + sha256 of the new zip) and pushes to main. The local clone defaults to `~/homebrew-tap`; override with `TAP_DIR=/path` if needed. The website download flow does NOT use brew; it pulls the DMG straight from the GitHub release.
