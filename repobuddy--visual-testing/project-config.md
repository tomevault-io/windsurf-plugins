# Installing Packages

This rule explains how to properly install new dependencies (packages) in this project, including workspace and local package management, and best practices.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Determine the correct workspace**: Make sure you are in the correct package directory (e.g., `libraries/design`, `apps/web`, etc.) before running any install command.
2. **Use the correct package manager**: This project uses [pnpm](mdc:https:/pnpm.io).
3. **Install a new dependency**:
   - For a regular dependency: `pnpm add <package-name>`
   - For a dev dependency: `pnpm add -D <package-name>`
   - For a specific version: `pnpm add <package-name>@<version>`
4. **For monorepos (workspaces)**:
   - To add a dependency to the root: `pnpm add -w <package-name>`
5. **Commit changes**: After installing, commit the updated `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` files.
6. **Avoid unnecessary global installs**: Prefer local installs unless a tool must be available globally.

## Guidelines

- Always check if the package already exists in the workspace before installing.
- Prefer the latest stable version unless a specific version is required.
- For peer dependencies, follow the instructions in the package documentation.
- If you encounter issues, check the package manager's documentation or consult the team.

## Example

```sh
# Install a regular dependency in the current package
pnpm add lodash

# Install a dev dependency in the currend package
pnpm add -D typescript --workspace=design

# Install a specific version
pnpm add react@19.1.0

# Install a dependency in the root
pnpm add -w typescript
```
