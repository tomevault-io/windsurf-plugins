# Quick Start: Activate Your Agents 🚀

Your agents are currently **IDLE** because they haven't been added to a flow yet. Here's how to get them working:

## Step-by-Step Activation

### Step 1: Open Your Flow Canvas
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. You should see a canvas with a **"Portfolio Analyzer"** node (or create a new flow)

### Step 2: Add Agents to Your Flow

**Method 1: Right Sidebar (Easiest)**
1. **Open the right sidebar**: Click the right sidebar icon (top right) or press `⌘ + I` (Mac) / `Ctrl + I` (Windows)
2. **Find "Analysts" section**: Scroll down to see all your agents
3. **Click the "+" button** next to any agent you want to activate:
   - Value Composite
   - Growth Composite
   - Momentum
   - Mean Reversion
   - Or any others you want
4. **The agent will appear on your canvas** as a new node

**Method 2: Click on Agent Name**
- Simply **click on the agent name** in the right sidebar
- It will be added to your canvas automatically

### Step 3: Connect the Agents

Your agents need to be connected in a flow:

```
Portfolio Analyzer → Agents → Portfolio Manager
```

1. **Connect Portfolio Analyzer to Agents**:
   - Hover over the Portfolio Analyzer node
   - Drag from the **output handle** (right side) to each agent's **input handle** (left side)
   - Or click and drag to create connections

2. **Connect Agents to Portfolio Manager**:
   - Drag from each agent's **output handle** (right side)
   - To the Portfolio Manager's **input handle** (left side)

3. **Add Portfolio Manager** (if not present):
   - From right sidebar → "End Nodes" → Click "+" on "Portfolio Manager"

### Step 4: Configure Your Portfolio

1. **Click on the "Portfolio Analyzer" node**
2. **Set Available Cash**: Enter your starting capital (e.g., 100000)
3. **Add Stock Positions**:
   - Click the **"+" button** to add a position
   - Enter:
     - **Ticker**: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA, or GOOGL (free)
     - **Quantity**: Number of shares
     - **Trade Price**: Price per share
   - Add multiple positions as needed

### Step 5: Start Your Agents! 🎯

**Option A: Single Run (Live Analysis)**
1. Make sure **"Single Run"** is selected in Portfolio Analyzer
2. Click the **Play button (▶️)** on the Portfolio Analyzer node
3. Or press **`⌘ + Enter`** / **`Ctrl + Enter`**

**Option B: Backtest (Historical Training)**
1. Switch to **"Backtest"** mode in Portfolio Analyzer
2. Set **Start Date** and **End Date**
3. Click **Play (▶️)**

### Step 6: Watch Them Work!

**In the Flow View:**
- Agents will change from **IDLE** (gray) → **IN_PROGRESS** (yellow) → **COMPLETE** (green)
- Click on any agent to see their analysis

**In the Dashboard:**
- Click the **Dashboard icon (📊)** in the top bar
- Watch the Agent Roster update in real-time:
  - Status changes from IDLE to IN_PROGRESS
  - Shows which ticker each agent is analyzing
  - Displays progress messages

## Example: Activate 3 Agents

1. **Add 3 agents**:
   - Value Composite (from right sidebar)
   - Growth Composite (from right sidebar)
   - Momentum (from right sidebar)

2. **Connect them**:
   - Portfolio Analyzer → Value Composite → Portfolio Manager
   - Portfolio Analyzer → Growth Composite → Portfolio Manager
   - Portfolio Analyzer → Momentum → Portfolio Manager

3. **Configure portfolio**:
   - Cash: $100,000
   - Add AAPL: 100 shares @ $150

4. **Click Play** → Watch all 3 agents start working!

## Troubleshooting

### "Agents still showing IDLE"
- ✅ Make sure agents are **added to the canvas** (not just in the sidebar)
- ✅ Verify agents are **connected** to Portfolio Analyzer
