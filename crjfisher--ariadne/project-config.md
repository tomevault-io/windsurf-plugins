# Guidelines

## Project Layout / Intention Tree

- the top of the intention tree (the actual purpose of this codebase) is to detect call graphs and thereby find the entry point to the codebase.
- every change to the code needs to be justified in terms of its contribution to the top-level intention tree.
- the module layout is the instantiation of the intention tree.
- we _never_ add 'extra' functionality outside of this intention tree, even if it is 'well-meaning' and 'might' be used one day. 'extra', surplus code reduces our longterm velocity. it is much better to spend effort reviewing narrow, focussed code and its integration, rather than trying to cover a wide surface area.
- all namings and documentation should _only_ reflect the trunk and branches of the intention tree, not the 'differential' changes we make to the codebase. E.g. if we're changing 'method_resolution.ts', we don't just create a file like 'enhanced_method_resolution.ts', we just improve 'method_resolution.ts', leaving the core intention tree intact.

## Refactoring Ethos

- DO NOT SUPPORT BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY - JUST _CHANGE_ THE CODE.

## Documentation Style: Canonical and Self-Contained

When writing or updating documentation, always write in a **canonical, self-contained** style. Documentation should describe the system as it currently IS, not as it was or how it changed.

**DO:**

- ✅ Describe the system as it currently IS
- ✅ Write in present tense ("The system works like this...")
- ✅ Be authoritative and direct
- ✅ Assume reader has no prior knowledge or context
- ✅ Focus on WHAT to do, not what NOT to do
- ✅ State the approach confidently without justification

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Reference "old approaches," "previous versions," or "deprecated methods"
- ❌ Use "revised," "updated," or "new" framing
- ❌ Explain what you're NOT doing or alternative approaches you rejected
- ❌ Include defensive justifications for design choices
- ❌ Write comparisons to alternatives (unless teaching concepts)
- ❌ Use apologetic or hedging language
- ❌ Assume reader knows the history or evolution

**Why:** Documentation should be the authoritative source of truth about the current system. Historical context belongs in commit messages, architecture decision records (separate files), or changelog files - not in the canonical system documentation.

**Example of RELATIVE writing (bad):**

```markdown
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Revised Scope

Original plan: Three-stage JSON pipeline
Revised plan: Semantic index JSON only
Reason: Solves the real problem without complexity

What we're NOT doing:

- ❌ JSON for registry outputs
- ❌ JSON for call graph outputs
```

**Example of CANONICAL writing (good):**

```markdown
## Scope

The fixture system uses JSON for semantic index outputs. These fixtures serve as inputs for registry and call graph integration tests.

JSON fixtures represent semantic index outputs only. Registry and call graph outputs are verified with code assertions.
```

**Note:** This applies to system documentation (README, task docs, architecture docs). Implementation notes in task files may reference history when documenting specific changes made.

### Core

- `packages/core/src/index_single_file`
  - builds the semantic index for a single file
  - build definitions including symbol-ids which are globally unique
  - builds references including symbol-names which are unique within a scope
  - builds scopes including lexical scope relationships
  - build type information including type bindings and type members TODO: verify these details
- `packages/core/src/resolve_references`
  - resolves references to symbols, matching symbol-names to symbol-ids
  - resolves symbols by name and scope - start at the bottom of the scope tree and work up i.e. lexical scope resolution
- `packages/core/src/trace_call_graph`
  - detects the call graph of a codebase
  - uses the semantic index and resolve_references to find the entry points to the codebase caller scopes that are never called (internally)

## Universal Symbol System

### Always Use SymbolId for Identifiers

When working with any identifier (variable, function, class, method, property, etc.), use the universal `SymbolId` type instead of individual name types or raw strings:

### Creating SymbolIds

Use the factory functions from `symbol.ts`:

```typescript
import { function_symbol, class_symbol, method_symbol } from '@ariadnejs/types';

// Create symbols with proper context
const funcId = function_symbol('processData', 'src/utils.ts', location);
const classId = class_symbol('MyClass', 'src/classes.ts', location);
const methodId = method_symbol('getValue', 'MyClass', 'src/classes.ts', location);
...
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Naming Convention - pythonic

- **Functions**: `snake_case`
- **Variables**: `snake_case`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Classes/Interfaces**: `PascalCase`
- **Files**: `snake_case.ts`

### Code Structure

- **Functional Style**: Prefer pure functions over stateful classes
- **Exports**: Only export what is actually used by external modules
- **Dependencies**: Check existing libraries before adding new ones

## Backlog Workflow

USE BACKLOG WHENEVER 'TASK's ARE MENTIONED.
