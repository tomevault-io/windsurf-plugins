# Security — read-only

- App is **strictly read-only**. It must NEVER modify anything in NextDNS.
- The **only allowed HTTP method is GET**. No POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE.
- Only two NextDNS endpoints are used:
  - `GET /profiles/:id/logs`
  - `GET /profiles/:id/analytics/devices`
- API token (`NEXTDNS_API_KEY`) must **never** reach the browser.
