# AGENTS.md

Repo rule for coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor). Read this before touching code.

## What this repo is

`mesh-viewer` is a VS Code / Cursor extension (`AssetToolLabs.mesh-viewer-vscode`) that opens 3D
files and Gaussian splats in a custom editor. `esbuild.js` produces two independent bundles:

| Bundle            | Entry point                                    | Runs in                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `out/extension.js`| `src/extension.ts` → `src/viewerProvider.ts`   | extension host (Node)         |
| `out/webview.js`  | `src/webview/main.ts`                          | webview (browser, Three + Spark inlined) |

Webview modules: `viewer.ts` (scene, camera, render loop, overlays), `loaders.ts` (per-format
loading and format sniffing), `timeline.ts` (dope sheet and playback), `weightMaterial.ts` (skin
weight coloring), `viewer.html` + `style.css` (shell). `src/types.ts` is the message protocol
between the two sides. Almost every format or rendering bug lands in `src/webview/`.

---

## The loop

**Every feature request, format-support request, and rendering/loading bug fix runs through all
six phases below, in order.** Do not go from prompt straight to edit. Do not declare a visual
result working — you cannot see the viewport, so phase 6 is where the user decides.

### 1. Analyze

Before proposing a change:

- Restate the ask and the observed vs. expected behavior in one paragraph.
- Find the code that owns it. Format/loading → `src/webview/loaders.ts`. Scene, camera, shading,
  overlays → `src/webview/viewer.ts`. UI panels, tree, inspector → `src/webview/main.ts`.
  Animation → `src/webview/timeline.ts`. Webview HTML, CSP, resource URIs, file reads →
  `src/viewerProvider.ts`. Commands, activation, settings → `src/extension.ts` + `package.json`.
- Check what the pinned `three` already ships before adding a dependency —
  `node_modules/three/examples/jsm/` has loaders, decoders, and utils that are often the whole fix.
- Name the root cause. If you cannot, say so and treat phase 2 as a diagnostic step rather than
  claiming a cause you have not established.

### 2. Get real test data

Get an asset that actually exercises the code path **before** writing the fix, so there is a
before/after to compare.

- Put everything in `test_data/` (gitignored, never committed). Do not drop assets in the repo root.
- Fetch two things where possible: a **repro asset** that triggers the bug or new path, and a
  **control asset** in the same format that already works and must not regress.
- Verified sources (reachable from this sandbox):

  ```bash
  mkdir -p test_data && cd test_data

  # Khronos glTF sample assets — index of every model, then a specific one
  curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets/main/Models/model-index.json
  curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets/main/Models/DamagedHelmet/glTF-Binary/DamagedHelmet.glb

  # three.js example models — fbx, obj, stl, ply, collada, usdz, vox, pcd, ...
  curl -sSLO "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/dev/examples/models/fbx/Samba%20Dancing.fbx"
  curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/dev/examples/models/stl/binary/pr2_head_pan.stl

  # assimp regression corpus — broad, weird, good for edge cases
  curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/assimp/assimp/master/test/models/OBJ/spider.obj
  ```

- **Confirm the asset really hits the path** before coding — a sample named after a feature does
  not always use it. For glTF, check the extension list; for binary formats, check the header:

  ```bash
  node -e "const b=require('fs').readFileSync('test_data/x.glb');const j=JSON.parse(b.subarray(20,20+b.readUInt32LE(12)).toString());console.log(j.extensionsUsed,j.extensionsRequired)"
  ```

- If nothing public exercises the path, **generate a fixture** with a small node script under
  `test_data/` and say in your report that the evidence is synthetic.
- Record where each asset came from in `test_data/SOURCES.md` so the next session can refetch it.

### 3. Plan, then get approval

Write a dedicated plan and get the user's go-ahead before editing. In Claude Code use plan mode
and `ExitPlanMode`; in Codex post the plan and wait for an ack. The plan states:

1. Root cause (or the diagnostic that will pin it down).
2. Numbered steps, each with the file it touches and why.
3. Which side of the boundary changes — extension host, webview, or both.
4. What is explicitly out of scope.
5. How each step gets verified, and which test asset proves it.

Prefer the smallest change that fixes the class of problem. If a plan starts widening the CSP,
adding a dependency, or reworking the render loop, stop and flag the tradeoff instead of
absorbing it silently.

### 4. Implement and rebuild

```bash
npm run typecheck   # tsc over both tsconfigs; esbuild does NOT typecheck
npm run build       # writes out/
```

Both must pass clean. Match the surrounding style: the existing code explains *why* in comments,
not *what*. English only — no Chinese in code, comments, or identifiers.
