# openkairos — persistent memory for this project
# The openkairos daemon maintains .kairos/memory/MEMORY.md
# This file is automatically updated as the daemon observes your codebase

# Always read project memory at start of conversation:
Read .kairos/memory/MEMORY.md for full project context before responding.

# Memory structure:
# .kairos/memory/MEMORY.md — index of all topics
# .kairos/memory/*.md — detailed topic files (architecture, bugs, decisions)
# .kairos/logs/ — raw daily observations

# If .kairos/memory/MEMORY.md doesn't exist yet:
# Run: kairos init && kairos watch
