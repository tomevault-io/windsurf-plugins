# Chorus — project instructions

Native macOS app: a WKWebView multi-service browser (a Rambox/Franz alternative),
SwiftUI + SwiftData. Distributed directly — Developer ID-signed, notarized DMG
with Sparkle auto-updates. Not sandboxed, not on the App Store.

## Public-facing writing

Everything a user or the public reads — `README.md`, GitHub release notes, the
appcast and any website copy, in-app strings and error messages,
`release/DISTRIBUTION.md`, and every other doc in this public repo — must meet
two standards:

1. **Pass the mcp-humanizer check.** Draft the text, run `humanizer_check_text`
   on it, fix every finding, and re-run until `prohibitions_clear` is true. Then
   self-attest the manual-review items. Reading the rules alone leaves about half
   the problems in place — the check-then-fix loop is what does the work.

2. **Follow George Orwell's six rules** (from *Politics and the English
   Language*):
   1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech you are used to
      seeing in print.
   2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
   3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
   4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
   5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can
      think of an everyday English equivalent.
   6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

Write plain, direct, active, concrete prose. No marketing gloss, no AI tells.

## Build & test

- Test: `xcodebuild test -project Chorus.xcodeproj -scheme Chorus -destination 'platform=macOS'`
- The project is generated from `project.yml` via XcodeGen. When you change build
  settings (for example a version bump), edit both `project.yml` and the
  `.pbxproj` so a later `xcodegen generate` stays consistent.
- **Never add `-configuration Release` to that test command.** `ChorusTests` is
  app-hosted, and `ChorusApp.init` builds an `AppState`, so every test run
  executes the launch path, including `StoreRepair.applyPendingRestore`, which
  writes files. Under Debug that is harmless — the store resolves to
  `Application Support/Chorus-debug` and the defaults domain to
  `com.nicojan.Chorus.debug`. Under Release it would aim that write at the real
  store and the release defaults domain, and this repo has already lost a real
  user's data to a careless run against live data.

## The store path (never go back to the default)

Release builds open `Application Support/Chorus/default.store`, which
`StoreRelocation` moves them to. Never open a store through
`ModelConfiguration(isStoredInMemoryOnly: false)` or any other implicit default.
For an app that is not sandboxed that resolves to
`Application Support/default.store`, a path with no bundle id in it, so every
other non-sandboxed SwiftData app that takes the default opens the very same
file. Whichever app opens it second migrates it to its own model, and Core Data
drops the entities that model does not declare. Chorus shared that file with
Bartender 6 and both apps lost everything, at every launch, until 1.5.18 moved
out. Debug builds sit in `Chorus-debug` for the same reason.

## SwiftData schema changes (read before editing any `@Model`)

The store opens through an explicit `VersionedSchema` + `SchemaMigrationPlan`
(`Chorus/Models/Schema/ChorusSchema.swift`), not inferred migration. Any change
to a **stored** property on `ServiceInstance`, `Space`, `SpaceServiceLink`, or
`AppPreferences` (add, remove, rename, retype) is a new schema version. Before
editing the live model:

1. Freeze the current shape as a new `ChorusSchemaV…` (copy `ChorusSchemaVCurrent`
   into a namespaced enum with the stored properties as they are now).
2. Make the model change, then bump `ChorusSchemaVCurrent.versionIdentifier`.
3. Add a `MigrationStage` for the step — `.lightweight` for additive-optional
   changes, `.custom` for a reshape/rename.
4. Add a migration test (see `testMigratesFrom1_5_11…`) and update the pinned
   sets in `testCurrentStoredShapeIsPinned`. Changing `AppPreferences` also needs
   its frozen copy updated — `testFrozenAppPreferencesMatchesLiveModel` will go
   red until you do.

That last test fails if you skip these steps — treat it as the reminder, not a
nuisance. A lossless-looking test does not prove the migration race is gone; the
auto-restore safety net (`StoreRepair` + `loadContainer`) stays as defense, and
`macOS 14.0` (the deployment target) needs a real-device migration pass before
shipping a schema change — this repo's dev machine is newer.

## Releasing

See `release/DISTRIBUTION.md`. In short: the notarized, stapled `Chorus.app` is placed at
the repo root; package a DMG with `hdiutil`, cut a `gh release`, then sign and
regenerate `docs/appcast.xml`.

Every release also needs the Homebrew cask bumped (step 9 there): put the new
version and the stapled DMG's sha256 into `release/homebrew/chorus.rb`, copy it to
`Casks/chorus.rb` in the `nicojan/homebrew-tap` repo, and check it with
`brew style` / `brew livecheck` / `brew audit --cask --online` before pushing both.
Skipping it leaves `brew` users on the old version; Sparkle still updates them, so
it's cosmetic, not a break.
