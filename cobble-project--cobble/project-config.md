# Agent guidelines for cobble project

This repository is a Rust + Cargo project implementing an LSM-style KV storage engine with SST (Sorted String Table) files.

## Goals
- Make small, focused, and reviewable changes.
- Keep build, formatting, linting, and tests passing.
- Follow the repository's PR title and description conventions.

## Workspace Organization
- The project is organized as a Cargo workspace.
- The main crate is `cobble`, located in the `cobble/`
- Other crates include:
  - `cobble-bench`: Benchmarking tools.
  - `cobble-cli`: Command-line interface for interacting with the database.

## How to Test
- Daily unit-test loop: `cargo test-short` (`cargo test --workspace --lib`)
- Run all workspace tests before committing: `cargo test --workspace`
- Run a fast subset on the main crate: `cargo test <pattern>` (e.g., `cargo test row_codec`)
  Notes:
- Some tests write temporary files under `/tmp` and may use serial execution attributes. Remove stale `/tmp` test artifacts if tests intermittently fail.

## How to Lint & Format
- Format: `cargo fmt`
- Lint the workspace (treat warnings as errors): `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
- Optional auto-fix for some lints: `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged`

Before opening a PR, ensure:
- `cargo fmt` produces no diffs
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` passes
- `cargo test --workspace` passes locally

## PR Title Format
Use this exact format for PR titles:
`<type>: <summary>`

Allowed `type` values:
- `feat` — new feature
- `fix` — bug fix
- `perf` — performance improvement
- `refactor` — refactor without behavior change
- `test` — add or update tests
- `docs` — documentation only
- `chore` — tooling, build, deps, non-code work
