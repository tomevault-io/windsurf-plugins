# AI Agent Guide - Big Mood Detector

This guide helps AI agents understand and work with the Big Mood Detector codebase effectively.

## Mission

Build and maintain a clinical-grade bipolar mood prediction system that analyzes Apple Health data using validated ML models to provide actionable insights for mental health management.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Setup environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev,ml,monitoring]"

# Run application
python src/big_mood_detector/main.py process data/health_auto_export/
python src/big_mood_detector/main.py predict data/health_auto_export/ --report
python src/big_mood_detector/main.py serve

# Development workflow
make test        # Run all tests
make quality     # Lint + type check + test
make dev         # Start development server
```

## Architecture Overview

The system follows Clean Architecture with clear boundaries:

```
Interfaces (CLI/API) → Application (Use Cases) → Domain (Business Logic) ← Infrastructure (ML/DB)
```

**Key principles:**
- Domain layer has NO external dependencies
- All data flows through use cases
- ML models are abstracted behind interfaces
- Repository pattern for data access

## Where to Make Changes

### Adding New Features
1. Start in `domain/` - define entities and business rules
2. Create use case in `application/use_cases/`
3. Implement infrastructure in `infrastructure/`
4. Add interface in `interfaces/cli/` or `interfaces/api/`
5. Write tests first (TDD approach)

### Modifying ML Models
- Model interfaces: `domain/services/mood_predictor.py`
- Implementations: `infrastructure/ml_models/`
- Weights: `model_weights/` (do not commit large files)
- Fine-tuning: `infrastructure/fine_tuning/`

### Data Processing
- Parsers: `infrastructure/parsers/json/` and `xml/`
- Feature extraction: `domain/services/feature_extraction_service.py`
- Aggregators: `domain/services/*_aggregator.py`

## Critical Files

**DO NOT MODIFY without understanding impact:**
- `domain/value_objects/clinical_thresholds.py` - DSM-5 validated thresholds
- `infrastructure/ml_models/xgboost_models.py` - Model loading logic
- `infrastructure/parsers/xml/streaming_parser.py` - Memory-efficient parsing
- `core/config.py` - Environment and path configuration

**Key configuration:**
- Sleep window merging: 3.75 hours (domain constant)
- Activity sequences: 1440 minutes/day
- Model paths: Configured in settings
- Clinical thresholds: Based on research papers

## Testing Requirements

**Before committing:**
1. All tests must pass: `make test`
2. Coverage must stay >90%: `make coverage`
3. Type checking clean: `make type-check`
4. No linting errors: `make lint`

**Test categories:**
- `pytest -m unit` - Fast domain tests
- `pytest -m integration` - DB and parser tests
- `pytest -m ml` - Model validation tests
- `pytest -m clinical` - Clinical threshold tests

## Performance Guidelines

**Memory usage:**
- XML parser uses <100MB for any file size
- Feature extraction: ~1KB per day per user
- Model inference: <100ms per prediction

**Processing targets:**
- XML parsing: >40k records/second
- Feature extraction: <1s per year of data
- API response: <200ms average

## Clinical Accuracy

**Key metrics from research:**
- Depression detection: AUC 0.80
- Mania detection: AUC 0.98
- Hypomania detection: AUC 0.95

**Critical features:**
- Circadian phase (top predictor)
- Sleep duration and efficiency
- Activity patterns (1440-min sequences)
- Heart rate variability

## Common Tasks

### Process New Data Format
1. Add parser to `infrastructure/parsers/`
2. Register in `ParserFactory`
3. Map to domain entities
4. Add tests with sample data

### Add Clinical Feature
1. Define in `domain/services/feature_extraction_service.py`
2. Implement calculation logic
3. Add to feature vector
4. Update model if needed
5. Validate against clinical literature

### Improve Performance
1. Profile with `cProfile` first
2. Check for N+1 queries
3. Use batch processing
4. Consider caching (Redis)
5. Optimize hot paths only

## Debugging Tips

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Profile memory usage
mprof run python src/big_mood_detector/main.py process large_file.xml
mprof plot

# Check SQL queries
export SQLALCHEMY_ECHO=true

# Trace execution
python -m trace -t src/big_mood_detector/main.py process data/
```

## Context Budget

When working on this codebase, prioritize loading:
1. Domain layer files (small, pure Python)
2. Relevant use case
3. Specific infrastructure needed
4. Tests for the area you're modifying

Avoid loading:
- All infrastructure at once
- Reference repos (unless needed)
- Large test fixtures
- Generated documentation

## Current Status

**✅ Production Ready:**
- Core data processing pipeline
- XGBoost + PAT ensemble models
- CLI with 6 commands
- FastAPI server
- Docker deployment
- 695 passing tests

**🚧 In Progress:**
- Web UI (Next.js)
- Real-time monitoring
- Federated learning

## Getting Help

- Check tests for usage examples
- Read docstrings (comprehensive)
- Look at similar features
- Check research papers in `docs/literature/`
- Review closed PRs for patterns

Remember: **Clinical accuracy > Feature complexity > Performa
