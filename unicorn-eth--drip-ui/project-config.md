# Prompt Guidelines

- Start with prompt analysis and pseudocode planning
- Use comments for logic explanation, not code description
- Provide complete, functional code with minimal placeholders
- Prioritize readability and elegant typescript over optimization
- Reference files to be modified
- Challenge assumptions and show complete thought process

# App lifecycle

1. a merchant will sync their shop, pulling in store data and saving it
2. a user will land on the page
3. a auth/idenitfy request is made to verify their identity based on cookies
4. they select a shop
5. the menu loads
6. the discounts load
7. a item is added to the cart in local storage
8. the user places the order by calling /order/pay
9. the Cart gets mapped to and Order.
10. the payment is executed onchain and the order is pending
11. the barista marks the order as complete on their pos and the user's order is complete
12. the user can see order history whenever

# Code Guidelines

- Use TypeScript's advanced features

  - Branded types for IDs and special strings
  - Effect Schema for validation
  - Tagged unions for type discrimination
  - Utility types for DRY type definitions
  - No interfaces

- Write functional, declarative code

  - Use Effect.js for server-side operations
  - Use pipe and operators (no Effect.gen)
  - Prefer Effect.andThen over Effect.map
  - Use Effect.fail/succeed for error handling
  - Bundle service functions into objects, not classes

- Follow consistent naming patterns
  - Use auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
  - Prefix schemas with S\_ (S_UUID, S_USDC)
  - Suffix DTOs with DTO (currencyDTO)
  - Use branded types for domain IDs (ItemId, OrderId)

# Project Structure

- Group code by domain concepts:

  - components/ui/\* - Shadcn UI components
  - data-model/\* - Domain types, logic and DTOs
  - lib/\* - Utility functions and constants
  - queries/\* - React Query hooks
  - services/\* - Backend services

- Keep concerns separated:
  - Business logic in data-model
  - UI components in components
  - Data fetching in queries
  - Effect.js operations in services
  - Response / request handling in route handlers

# React & Next.js

- Use Next.js 14 Pages Router
- Implement mobile-first with Tailwind CSS
- Use react-query for data fetching
- Use Shadcn UI components from components/ui/\*
- Add loading skeletons for async states
- Ensure ARIA attributes for accessibility

# Data Sources

1. Slice: On-chain POS system
2. Square: Traditional payments

   overall:

- Map catalog data to internal types using dtos

# Error Handling

- Use Effect.js for type-safe error handling
- Define custom error classes with \_tag
- Validate inputs with Effect Schema
- Handle currency type mismatches
- Provide meaningful error messages

# Security

- Validate all inputs server-side
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Enforce HTTPS and CORS
- Sanitize frontend inputs
- Never expose sensitive data to client

# Core Dependencies

- effect, @effect/platform-node: Server-side type-safe operations
- next, react: Core framework (Pages Router)
- @tanstack/react-query: Data fetching
- viem: Ethereum interactions
- @slicekit/core: Slice POS integration
- square: Payment processing
- @vercel/postgres: Main database
- @privy-io/\*: Authentication

# Data Sources

- Slice: On-chain POS system for items/shop data
- Square: Traditional payment processing and item management
- Item source config stored in Item.\_\_sourceConfig
