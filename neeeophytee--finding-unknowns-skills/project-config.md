# Repo notes

This repo ships agent skills distilled from two Thariq Shihipar essays. It is a Claude Code plugin, a Codex plugin, its own single-plugin marketplace on both, and a plain `SKILL.md` collection installable into Kimi, Cursor, and Hermes. Everything below is a gotcha about maintaining it — none of it ships to users.

## What ships, and the gate that decides

`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `skills` array is the ship gate for the Claude Code plugin. A skill directory that exists under `skills/` but is missing from that array **does not reach Claude Code plugin users**, even though `npx skills add`, manual `cp -r`, the Codex plugin, and Hermes will still pick it up. (The Codex manifest uses `"skills": "./skills/"` — the whole directory — so it has no per-skill gate; the Claude array is the only explicit gate. Keep the array complete anyway; it's the intended control.) Add every new skill to the array in the same commit that creates it.

## Version lives in THREE manifests — move them together

`version` is what tells already-installed users an update exists. It is duplicated and must stay in lockstep:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- (a root `plugin.json` too, if Antigravity support ever lands — see `FUTURE-EXTENSIONS.md`)

`marketplace.json` and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` carry no version field. A version mismatch ships silently — no error, just wrong "update available" signals. Also tag the release (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z`) and `gh release create`; bumping the manifest alone does not create a GitHub release.

Never add `Co-Authored-By` / AI-attribution trailers to commits, PRs, or releases — it registers a bot on the contributor list.

## Files that must be edited together

- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are byte-identical. Edit both, or `diff` fails.
- The skill count is hardcoded in `README.md` (4 places) and in `plugin.json`'s `description`, which also enumerates every skill by name.
- Two of those README lines are **verification claims**, not prose. Find-and-replacing the number in them turns a verified claim into an unverified one. Re-run both and edit to what you observed:

```
npx skills@latest add /path/to/this/repo --list      # read-only; accepts a local path
```

```
mkdir -p /tmp/t/.agents/skills && cd /tmp/t && git init -q .
cp -r /path/to/this/repo/skills/* .agents/skills/
codex debug prompt-input                              # every skill name + description must appear
```

The Codex check needs a git repo and a project-level `.agents/skills/`; it resolves from the nearest `.git` root, so a bare temp directory silently finds nothing.

Codex **plugin** route (verify without touching real config — set `CODEX_HOME` to a temp dir):

```
export CODEX_HOME=/tmp/codexhome && mkdir -p $CODEX_HOME
codex plugin marketplace add /path/to/this/repo
codex plugin add finding-unknowns@finding-unknowns
cd /tmp/anygitrepo && codex debug prompt-input     # all 11 skill names must appear
```

Hermes route (verify with an isolated `HERMES_HOME` — do NOT write to the user's `~/.hermes`):

```
export HERMES_HOME=/tmp/hermeshome && mkdir -p $HERMES_HOME
printf 'skills:\n  external_dirs:\n    - /path/to/this/repo/skills\n' > $HERMES_HOME/config.yaml
hermes skills list        # all 11 must show 'enabled'
```

`hermes plugins install` is the WRONG route for this repo — it's a Python-plugin system (wants `plugin.yaml`/`__init__.py`). Use `skills.external_dirs`. Install-doc receipts live in `INSTALL-CODEX.md` and `INSTALL-HERMES.md`; when a claim's version changes, re-run the matching check above and edit the doc to what you saw.

## Shipped guidance is not this file

`guidance/finding-unknowns.md` is the passive-guidance version users drop into their own project as `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`. It used to live at this path, which made one filename mean two opposite things. Keep them separate: general methodology goes in `guidance/`, repo-specific gotchas go here.

## Skill conventions

Skills are flat: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, one file each, no subdirectories. Single-file skills install identically on all five supported agents; sibling files are only verified to travel on Claude Code.

Every skill ends in a `## Guardrails` section. That is deliberate house style — keep it.

`progressive-disclosure` is user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true`), so its description is human-facing: a one-line summary with no "Use when…" trigger phrasing. Model-invoked skills need the trigger phrasing; check which kind you're writing before copying a description's shape.
