# Pinget agent guide

This directory is being prepared to become its own `pinget` repository. Treat `pinget\` as the effective repo root when making changes here.

## Scope

- Maintain the Rust CLI + core in `rust\`
- Maintain the C# CLI + core + PowerShell module in `dotnet\`
- Keep **both** `rust\` and `dotnet\` directories in the standalone-repo prep
- Keep behavior aligned with WinGet where practical

## Hard exclusions

Do not add or depend on:

- DSC / `configure` / `dscv3` / `Microsoft.WinGet.Configuration`
- `mcp`

If an upstream behavior depends on one of those, document the limit instead of faking native integration.

## Working conventions

1. Prefer subtree-relative paths in docs, scripts, and instructions so the directory can be extracted cleanly later.
2. Keep Pinget-specific documentation inside this directory when possible.
3. Preserve the existing branding split:
   - product name: `Pinget`
   - C# namespaces/assemblies: `Pinget.*`
   - Rust crates/binaries: `pinget-*` / `pinget`
4. Keep Rust and C# behavior aligned when the same feature exists in both implementations.
5. When upstream `winget-cli` behavior or code needs to be referenced, create a local reference clone at `pinget\winget-cli\` and keep Pinget work in the sibling `rust\` and `dotnet\` trees rather than copying upstream code into them.

## Referencing winget-cli

If you need the upstream repository for comparison, clone it into the Pinget root like this:

```powershell
Set-Location .\pinget
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli.git .\winget-cli
```

Guidelines:

- treat `winget-cli\` as a **read-only reference clone**
- do not move Pinget sources into that clone
- do not collapse Pinget down to only one implementation; keep both `rust\` and `dotnet\`
- prefer extracting behavior, docs, and test expectations rather than copying implementation wholesale

## Validation

Run the existing toolchain checks that apply to the files you changed.

### Rust

```powershell
cargo +nightly fmt --manifest-path rust\Cargo.toml --all
cargo clippy -q --manifest-path rust\Cargo.toml --workspace --tests -- -D warnings
cargo test -p pinget-core --manifest-path rust\Cargo.toml
cargo test -p pinget-cli --manifest-path rust\Cargo.toml
cargo build -p pinget-cli --manifest-path rust\Cargo.toml
```

### C#

```powershell
dotnet format dotnet\Devolutions.Pinget.slnx
dotnet build dotnet\Devolutions.Pinget.slnx -c Release
dotnet test dotnet\src\Devolutions.Pinget.Core.Tests\Devolutions.Pinget.Core.Tests.csproj -c Release
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File (Resolve-Path 'dotnet\tests\RunTests.ps1')
```

## Migration prep guidance

When adding new files or build instructions, prefer layouts that will still make sense after this directory is copied into a standalone repository:

- avoid parent-repo-relative paths
- keep Pinget docs close to the subtree
- keep any upstream reference clone under `winget-cli\` at the Pinget root only
- avoid coupling to unrelated `winget-cli` infrastructure unless there is no practical alternative
