# CLAUDE.md

This file provides context to Claude Code when working in this vault.

## Vault Overview

This is [Your Name]'s personal knowledge management vault using the PARA methodology. It serves as my central workspace for [describe your main activities: consulting, content creation, research, project management, etc.].

## Folder Structure

- **00 Daily/** - Daily notes in `YYYY/YYYYMMDD.md` format. Chronological record of work sessions, decisions, and progress.
- **01 Inbox/** - Quick capture for unsorted items. Process during weekly review.
- **02 Projects/** - Active work with deadlines and completion criteria. When done, move to Archive.
- **03 Areas/** - Ongoing responsibilities without end dates. [List your main areas]
- **04 Resources/** - Reference materials, templates, frameworks, how-to guides.
- **05 Archive/** - Completed projects and inactive items.

## Current Focus

<!-- Update this section when your priorities change -->

**This Week:**
- [Primary focus for the week]
- [Secondary priority]

**Active Projects:**
- [Project 1]
- [Project 2]

## Working Preferences

<!-- Customize these to match how you like to work -->

- I prefer concise, direct communication
- Create files in appropriate PARA locations based on content type
- Document work sessions in daily notes
- Use [[wiki links]] to connect related content
- When creating project notes, include clear next actions

## Uncertainty Protocol

**When you're not sure, ask rather than guess.**

Before making decisions that could affect my data:

1. **File organization:** If you're unsure where a file belongs (which PARA folder), ask me rather than guessing.
2. **Content creation:** If you're fabricating details I didn't provide, stop and ask for the actual information.
3. **Destructive actions:** Before deleting, moving, or significantly modifying existing files, confirm the action.

**Safe defaults:**
- Low confidence about file destination → Keep in Inbox, flag for review
- Uncertain about fact or detail → Ask, don't invent
- Multiple valid approaches → Present options, let me choose

This builds trust. I'd rather answer a quick question than fix a mistake.

- **Numbers and statistics:** Verify from primary sources before writing them. Generic is better than fabricated. "I can't verify this" beats a plausible guess.

## Security Note

When you approve a Bash command, Claude Code saves the full command text to
`~/.claude/settings.json`. This means inline credentials get permanently stored:

- **BAD:** `API_KEY="sk-real-key" node script.js` — saves the key to settings forever
- **GOOD:** Export the credential first (`export API_KEY="value"`), then run the command without it

If this happens accidentally, edit `~/.claude/settings.json` to remove the entry
and rotate the exposed credential.

## Verification Rule

Before claiming work is complete, fixed, or passing — run the verification command
and show the output. "Should work" is not evidence. Evidence is evidence.

## Date Validation

The system clock is the only source of truth for dates. Never trust day-of-week
from file content — verify with the `date` command if accuracy matters.

## Review Principle

When reviewing or auditing content, apply fixes directly — don't just recommend them.
"Consider changing X to Y" wastes time. Change X to Y and explain why.

## File Naming Conventions

- Daily notes: `YYYYMMDD.md` (example: `20251223.md`)
- Project notes: Descriptive names with spaces (example: `Client Proposal - Acme Corp.md`)
- Session documentation: Include date when relevant

## Key Contexts

<!-- Add information Claude should know about your work -->

**Business/Role:**
[Describe what you do, your business, your role]

**Tools I Use:**
- [Tool 1]
- [Tool 2]
- [Tool 3]

**Writing Style:**
[Describe your preferred tone and style]
