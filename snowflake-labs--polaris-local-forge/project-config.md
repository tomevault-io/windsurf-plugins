# Cortex Code Skill Development

## Reference Repositories

**Best Practices:** `~/snow-works/coco/skills/BEST_PRACTICES.local.md`

**CLI Source (Python package):**
- `~/git/kameshsampath/snow-utils` - Scripts consumed by skills via uv git dependency

**Skills (SKILL.md files):**
- `~/git/kameshsampath/snow-utils-skills` - PAT, Networks, Volumes skills
- `~/git/kameshsampath/kamesh-demo-skills` - Demo skills (hirc-duckdb, smart-crowd-counter)

# Skill Title

**📍 MANIFEST FILE:** `.snow-utils/snow-utils-manifest.md`
**📋 PREREQUISITE:** NO PREREQUISITE or list dependencies
**⚠️ CONNECTION USAGE:** Which connection/auth model
**📌 ROLE MODEL:** (if applicable)

## Workflow

**FORBIDDEN ACTIONS -- NEVER DO THESE:**
- List prohibited actions

**INTERACTIVE PRINCIPLE:** Ask user, wait for response

### Step N: Step Name
[SHOW/DO/SUMMARIZE pattern]

## CLI Reference
[Tables with exact command/option names]

## Troubleshooting
[Common issues and fixes]
```

## Key Patterns

### SHOW/DO/SUMMARIZE (Pedagogical UX)

Every action in a skill should follow this three-phase pattern:

1. **SHOW** - Preview what we're about to do (display SQL/command with explanation)
2. **DO** - Execute after user approval
3. **SUMMARIZE** - Explain result and connect to learning goal

### CLI Thin Wrapper Pattern

- CLI does ONE thing (run subprocess, exit)
- SKILL.md handles: orchestration, user prompts, manifest updates, .env edits
- Status checks use native tools (`k3d cluster list`, `kubectl get`)

### Manifest-Driven Operations

- Track resources in `.snow-utils/snow-utils-manifest.md`
- Use START/END markers: `<!-- START -- skill-name -->`
- Update progressively (after each step, not at end)
- Include cleanup instructions in manifest

### .env Handling

- **CLI:** Read-only via `load_dotenv()`
- **SKILL.md:** Write via Edit/StrReplace tool (NEVER sed/awk)

### User Confirmation Rules

- Show full preview before destructive operations
- Use `ask_user_question` tool with 4-option limit
- Wait for explicit approval ("yes", "ok", "proceed")
- `--yes` flag for non-interactive execution after approval

## Naming Conventions

| Resource | Pattern | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Network Rule | `{SA_USER}_NETWORK_RULE` | `KAMESHS_DEMO_NETWORK_RULE` |
| Service Role | `{PROJECT}_ACCESS` | `KAMESHS_DEMO_ACCESS` |
| Service User | `{PROJECT}_RUNNER` | `KAMESHS_DEMO_RUNNER` |

## SQL Verification

**MANDATORY:** Before writing ANY SQL, verify syntax against Snowflake docs:
1. `web_search: "Snowflake <COMMAND> syntax"`
2. `web_fetch: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/<command>`

## Forbidden in Skills

- NEVER skip dry-run/preview output
- NEVER use sed/awk for config edits
- NEVER guess CLI options (run `--help` first)
- NEVER run raw SQL for cleanup (use CLI commands)
- NEVER write to `~/.snow-utils/` (project-scoped only)
