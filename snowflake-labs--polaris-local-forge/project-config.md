# Workflow Synchronization

## Critical: CLI and SKILL Workflows Must Stay in Sync

The project has two parallel workflows that MUST remain synchronized:

1. **CLI Workflow (Taskfile.yml)** - `task setup:all`, `task teardown`, etc.
2. **SKILL Workflow (SKILL.md)** - Cortex Code agentic workflow

### Files That Must Stay in Sync

| CLI Path | SKILL Path | Must Match |
|----------|------------|------------|
| `Taskfile.yml` setup:all steps | `SKILL.md` "Run all mode" section | Execution order, manifest updates |
| `Taskfile.yml` teardown task | `SKILL.md` "Teardown Flow" section | Confirmation behavior, cleanup paths |
| `Taskfile.yml` CLEANUP_PATHS | `SKILL.md` "Clean Generated Files" | Exact same file list |
| `src/polaris_local_forge/setup.py` | `SKILL.md` workflow logic | Exit codes, status handling |

### When Changing Either Workflow

1. **Check the other workflow** - Does it need the same change?
2. **Update both** - Keep behavior identical
3. **Verify constants** - `CLEANUP_PATHS` must match between Taskfile and SKILL.md
4. **Test both paths** - Run `task setup:all` AND test via Cortex Code

### Key Synchronization Points

- **Manifest format**: Single template at `polaris-forge-setup/templates/manifest.md.j2`
- **Runtime detection**: `plf setup runtime ensure` used by both
- **Cleanup paths**: `.kube work k8s scripts bin notebooks .env .aws .envrc .gitignore .venv`
- **Preserved paths**: `.snow-utils/` always preserved for replay/audit
- **Confirmation**: Destructive operations require user confirmation in BOTH paths

### Commands That Wrap CLI

The SKILL.md workflow uses CLI commands - changes to CLI affect SKILL:

```
./bin/plf teardown --yes     # SKILL calls this AFTER getting user confirmation
./bin/plf setup manifest *   # Used by both workflows
./bin/plf setup runtime *    # Used by both workflows
```

### Never Change Independently

- Exit codes from `plf setup replay` (0, 10, 11)
- Manifest status values (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, REMOVED)
- Resource numbering in manifest (1-7)
- File/directory cleanup list
