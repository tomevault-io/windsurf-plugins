## Project Overview

This is the Solis Cloud Control API integration for Home Assistant.

## Setup Commands

- Install dependencies: `uv sync`
- Run all checks (lint, format, type, test): `mise run check`
- Run tests: `mise run test`
- Run linter: `mise run lint`
- Run type checker: `mise run typecheck`
- Format code: `mise run format`

## MCP servers

- Use GitHub MCP tools for managing repositories, issues, and pull requests
- Use Context7 MCP when you need library/API documentation, code generation, setup, or configuration steps

## General rules

- Always ask if you are unsure what to do or if the potential impact of a change is large
- Always use Context7 MCP when you need library/API documentation, code generation, setup, or configuration
 steps without the user explicitly asking
- Comments: Use sparingly, explain WHY not WHAT
- Mirror patterns from existing integration modules under `custom_components/solis_cloud_control` and tests under `tests`.
- Prioritize maintainability, testability, and performance while matching existing simplicity. Follow logging, typing, and retry patterns already used.

## Architecture & Module Boundaries

- `api/`: Low-level Solis Cloud API client & error types.
- `inverters/` & `domain/`: Domain model abstractions (value objects, bitfields, configuration holders) for inverter capabilities.
- `coordinator.py`: Data retrieval + control orchestration with retry & verification loops.
- `entity.py`: Base entity tying coordinator data to Home Assistant entities (availability logic).
- Platform files (`number.py`, `sensor.py`, `switch.py`, `select.py`, `text.py`): Entity classes mapping domain model CIDs to HA platform features with consistent naming and logging.
- `config_flow.py`: User onboarding (two-step: credentials -> inverter selection) with error mapping.
- `diagnostics.py`: Redacted diagnostic dump (serial number masked) using `asdict` from dataclasses.
- `__init__.py`: Integration setup, device registration, migration logic, coordinator instantiation.
