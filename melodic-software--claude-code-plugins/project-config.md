# Claude Code Plugin System

Claude Code extensions (skills, agents, hooks, MCP servers) are organized into **plugins** which can be installed globally or per-user, separate from the project repository.

## Plugin Installation Locations

Plugins are installed via marketplaces and stored in user-level directories:

| Platform | Typical Location |
|----------|-----------------|
| macOS/Linux | `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/{marketplace-name}/{plugin-name}/` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\{marketplace-name}\{plugin-name}\` |

**Note**: The exact path depends on Claude Code configuration. Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable in plugin scripts for reliable path resolution.

## Plugin Directory Structure

```text
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Required: plugin manifest
├── agents/                   # Subagents (*.md files)
│   └── my-agent.md
├── skills/                   # Agent Skills
│   └── my-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── hooks/                    # Event handlers
│   └── hooks.json
├── .mcp.json                 # MCP server definitions
└── scripts/                  # Supporting scripts
```

## Key Files

### plugin.json (Required)

Located at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What this plugin does",
  "author": { "name": "Author Name" }
}
```

### SKILL.md (For Skills)

Each skill lives in `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` with optional supporting files in the same directory.

### hooks.json (For Hooks)

Event handlers configured in `hooks/hooks.json` or inline in plugin.json.

### .mcp.json (For MCP Servers)

MCP server definitions at plugin root.

## Component Types

| Component | Location | Format | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Agents | `agents/` | Markdown with frontmatter | Specialized subagents |
| Skills | `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Markdown with frontmatter | Model-invoked capabilities |
| Hooks | `hooks/hooks.json` | JSON | Event handlers |
| MCP Servers | `.mcp.json` | JSON | External tool integration |

## When Working with Plugin Components

1. **Check if it's from a plugin**: Components may be in the project OR in a user-installed plugin
2. **Find the plugin location**: Look in `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/` for installed plugins
3. **Respect the structure**: Keep components in their designated directories
4. **Use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}**: For paths in hooks and MCP configs

## Marketplace Structure

Marketplaces are collections of plugins with a manifest at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "marketplace-name",
  "owner": { "name": "Owner" },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "plugin-name",
      "source": "./plugin-name",
      "description": "Plugin description"
    }
  ]
}
```
