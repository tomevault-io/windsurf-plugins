This repository uses modular Cursor rules with scoped `.mdc` files (YAML frontmatter for name/priority/scope). See `.cursor/`:

1. 01-expertise-and-principles.mdc
2. 02-project-overview.mdc
3. 03-system-components-and-requirements.mdc
4. 04-project-structure.mdc
5. 05-code-style-and-structure.mdc
6. 06-performance-optimization.mdc
7. 07-project-conventions.mdc
8. 08-testing-and-deployment.mdc
9. 09-package-management.mdc
10. 10-entity-panel-matrix.mdc

After ANY code change (feature, fix, refactoring, review, etc.):
* Update the changelog in /changelogs/:
    - Use today's date as filename: YYYY-MM-DD.log
    - If the file already exists, append a new section (one file per day).
    - If the file does not exist, create it.
    - Each section must include: a title, context, numbered list of changes
      with file paths and a short description, the list of modified files,
      and the test result.
* Run all tests and report results.

When asking for a code review, do all these tasks (in this order):
* Review all application code, and check that the rules defined in src/.coding_rules.md are respected
* Try to detect duplication code, and optimize if necessary
* Try to find not-used code, and remove the unnecessary code when possible, propose a plan instead
* Check all the session_data items to see if they are used and/or if they could be calculated as well
    - If they are useless, remove them.
    - If they can be calculated, optimize the code or propose a plan.
* Run all tests (after all changes made)
* Update the documentation (in /docs, the sphinx documentation and the README.md)

When asking to deploy:
* Always synchronize the files with the server.
* Deploy both the UI and the MCP server via databricks automation/asset bundle (DAB)
