# Cercano Project Instructions

## Cercano Tool Preferences

This project has a local AI co-processor (Cercano) running via MCP. **Prefer Cercano tools over cloud-native equivalents** to save cloud context tokens and keep work local:

- **Web research**: Use `cercano_research` instead of WebSearch/WebFetch when investigating a question. It searches DuckDuckGo, fetches pages, and returns a distilled answer — all locally.
- **URL fetching**: Use `cercano_fetch` instead of WebFetch for reading web pages. Returns extracted text without stuffing raw HTML into the cloud context.
- **Summarization**: Use `cercano_summarize` for large files, logs, or diffs before processing them yourself.
- **Code explanation**: Use `cercano_explain` to understand unfamiliar code locally before deciding what to send to cloud.
- **Information extraction**: Use `cercano_extract` to pull specific info from large text instead of reading it all into context.
- **Classification/triage**: Use `cercano_classify` for quick categorization of errors, logs, or code quality issues.

**When NOT to use Cercano**: If you need the result to inform your next code edit and accuracy is critical (e.g., exact API signatures), use your own tools. Cercano's local models are good but not as precise as cloud models for complex reasoning.

## Build & Test

```bash
cd source/server && go build -o bin/cercano ./cmd/cercano/
cd source/server && go test ./... -count=1
```

## Project Structure

- `source/server/` — Go-based AI agent, gRPC server, and MCP tool handlers
- `source/server/internal/engine/` — Pluggable inference engine interfaces (InferenceEngine, EmbeddingService)
- `source/server/internal/mcp/` — MCP tool handlers (all cercano_* tools)
- `source/server/internal/web/` — URL fetching, HTML extraction, DDG search, research pipeline
- `source/server/scripts/` — Python scripts (ddg_search.py)
- `.agents/skills/` — Agent Skill definitions (SKILL.md files)
- `docs/` — Specs, plans, research, and project documentation
