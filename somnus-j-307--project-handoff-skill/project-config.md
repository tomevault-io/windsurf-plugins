# Repository rules

- Keep distributable Codex skills under `skills/<skill-name>/`.
- Treat `skills/project-handoff/` as the canonical published copy of the skill.
- Keep repository-level documentation at the repository root; do not place README or changelog files inside the skill directory.
- Do not commit credentials, machine-specific paths, generated caches, handoff packets, or test artifacts.
- Validate the skill with `quick_validate.py` and run the bundled validator tests before publishing changes.
- Keep changes narrowly scoped and preserve backward compatibility for existing handoff packets unless a breaking change is explicitly approved.
