# Cursor Rules for MCP Server for Splunk

## README and Markdown Standards

When editing any `*.md` file, apply these standards:

### README Writing Guidelines
- Follow the guide in `docs/readme-guide.md` for all README files
- Use the 3-Layer Principle: Hook (10s) → Quick Start (2m) → Navigation (30s)
- Target audience first: Define personas and technical level before writing
- Maximum 1200 words for main READMEs, focus on navigation to detailed docs

### Markdown Formatting Rules
```markdown
# H1: Document title only (one per file)
## H2: Major sections
### H3: Subsections (use sparingly, avoid H4+)

**Bold**: Important terms, actions, key concepts
*Italic*: Emphasis, file names, variables
`Code`: Commands, file paths, configuration values
```

### Content Standards
- **Paragraphs**: Maximum 3-4 sentences
- **Code blocks**: Always include language for syntax highlighting
- **Links**: Use descriptive text, prefer relative paths for internal links
- **Images**: Include alt text, optimize for <500KB, use repo-relative paths
- **Lists**: Use parallel structure, start with action verbs when possible

### Code Example Requirements
- Test all code examples before including
- Include expected output when helpful
- Show command context (directory, prerequisites)
- Comment complex commands
- Use realistic examples, not `foo/bar` placeholders

### README Structure Enforcement
For main README files, ensure these sections exist:
1. **Hero Section**: Title, badges, value proposition, key features
2. **Quick Start**: Prerequisites, installation, first success
3. **Documentation Hub**: Links to detailed guides
4. **Community/Support**: Issues, discussions, help channels

### Writing Style Rules
- Use active voice: "Run the command" not "The command should be run"
- Be specific: "Takes 2 minutes" not "Quick setup"
- Show outcomes: "You'll see X" not "The system will do Y"
- Use direct address: "You" instead of "users" or "developers"
- Avoid jargon without explanation

### Quality Checks
Before saving any .md file:
- [ ] All links work and point to correct locations
- [ ] Code examples are tested and current
- [ ] Images load and have alt text
- [ ] Headings follow logical hierarchy
- [ ] Content serves the target audience
- [ ] Length appropriate for document type

### Project-Specific Rules
- Reference the README guide: `docs/readme-guide.md`
- Use consistent emoji: 🚀 (quick start), 📚 (docs), 🔧 (tools), 🤝 (community)
- Link to examples in `contrib/` for community tools
- Maintain backward compatibility notes for migrations
- Include Windows/macOS/Linux considerations where relevant

### Auto-Corrections
When editing markdown:
- Replace "click here" with descriptive link text
- Convert passive voice to active where possible
- Break up paragraphs longer than 4 sentences
- Add syntax highlighting to code blocks missing it
- Suggest alt text for images without it
- Flag outdated version numbers or broken links

### Community Contribution Standards
For contribution-related markdown:
- Include clear next steps
- Provide examples of good contributions
- Link to development setup guides
- Mention testing requirements
- Reference code of conduct

Remember: A README is a conversation starter, not a reference manual. Hook readers, help them succeed quickly, then guide them to deeper resources.
