# Amytis Project Context

## Project Overview
**Amytis** (@hutusi/amytis) is a high-performance, elegant digital garden and blog engine built with **Next.js 16 (App Router)**, **React 19**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**. It is designed for cultivating thoughts and sharing knowledge with a focus on typography, readability, and flexible content organization.

The package is officially published to both **npm** and **GitHub Packages** with automated **Trusted Publishing** (OIDC).

### Main Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Runtime/Package Manager**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS-variable based themes and `@tailwindcss/typography`.
- **Content**: Local MDX/Markdown files with Zod-validated frontmatter.
- **Search**: Static full-text search using `Pagefind`.
- **Diagrams**: Native support for `Mermaid` diagrams.
- **Math**: LaTeX support via `rehype-katex`.

## Building and Running

### Development
```bash
bun dev
```

### Production Build (Static Export)
```bash
bun run build
```
Generates a fully optimized static site in the `out/` directory with Pagefind search index.

### Linting & Testing
```bash
bun run lint
bun test
```

## Project Structure
- `src/app/`: Next.js App Router pages and global styles.
  - `page.tsx`: Homepage with horizontal scrolling featured sections and latest timeline.
  - `posts/`: Paginated post listing and individual post routes.
  - `flows/`: Stream-style daily notes or micro-blogging (`[year]/[month]/[day]`).
  - `series/`: Series overview and individual series catalog pages with pagination support.
  - `books/`: Books overview and individual book/chapter pages (`[slug]/[chapter]`).
  - `notes/`: Evergreen notes index and individual note pages with backlinks.
  - `archive/`: Timeline-based chronological archive grouped by year and month.
  - `tags/`: Popularity-sorted tag cloud and filtered listings.
  - `authors/`: Posts filtered by individual authors.
  - `graph/`: Interactive knowledge graph visualization of all connected content.
  - `subscribe/`: Subscription options (RSS, Newsletter, Social).
  - `search.json/`: Static search index generator (supplementary).
- `src/lib/`: Core logic and utilities.
  - `markdown.ts`: Advanced parsing for posts/series/flows, sorting, and metadata.
  - `search-utils.ts`: Content cleaning and search result processing.
  - `shuffle.ts`: Deterministic and random array shuffling.
  - `urls.ts`: Centralized URL routing and link generation logic.
- `src/components/`: Modular UI blocks (Hero, HorizontalScroll, Search, CoverImage, ShareBar, etc.).
- `content/`: Source Markdown/MDX content.
- `scripts/`: CLI tools for content management and asset processing.

## Key Features & Configuration

### Advanced Content Management
- **Posts**: Supports both flat files (`.mdx`) and nested folders (`/index.mdx`) with co-located assets.
- **Flows**: Daily notes or micro-posts organized by date (`YYYY/MM/DD`). Designed for quick thoughts and stream-of-consciousness updates. Supports optional titles via frontmatter or H1 headings.
- **Series**: 
  - Robust grouping with folder-based or file-based entries.
  - Configurable sorting: `date-asc`, `date-desc`, or `manual` (explicit list of slugs).
  - **Collections**: Specialized series (`type: collection`) that allow manual curation of posts and other series.
  - **Namespaced Referencing**: Collection items support `folder/slug` syntax (e.g., `posts/my-post`, `web-dev/intro`) to explicitly resolve posts and prevent collisions across different content directories.
  - Cross-referencing: Series can include posts from the general pool or other folders.
  - Metadata inheritance: Posts can inherit attributes (like authors) from series index files.
- **Featured Content**: Mark posts or series as `featured` to display them in prominent homepage sections with horizontal scrolling.
- **Cover Images**: Support for local paths, external URLs, and dynamic desaturated gradients (`text:Label`).
- **External Links**: Posts can include a list of curated external resources in frontmatter.

### Digital Garden Features
- **Notes**: Atomic, evergreen notes for personal knowledge management (`content/notes/`).
- **Wiki-links**: Bidirectional linking using `[[Slug]]` syntax across all content types.
- **Backlinks**: Automatic display of "Linked References" with context snippets.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Interactive visualization of content relationships at `/graph`.

### Refined UX & Design
- **Homepage**: Elegant layout with "Curated Series" and "Featured Stories" sections using horizontal scroll triggers.
- **Navigation**: Command+K fuzzy search, sticky TOC with progress tracking, and Series Catalog sidebars.
- **Theming**: Four built-in palettes (`default`, `blue`, `rose`, `amber`) with high-contrast Dark Mode support.
- **i18n**: Multi-language infrastructure (en, zh) with footer language switcher. `site.config.ts` supports localized strings.

### Build Pipeline
- **Asset Mapping**: `scripts/copy-assets.ts` mirrors content assets to the public folder, handling relative path resolution for both flat and nested structures.
- **Image Optimization**: Fully integrated with `next-image-export-optimizer` for optimized WebP delivery in static exports.
