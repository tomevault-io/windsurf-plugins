# Weclappy Project Conventions

## Virtual Environment

The project uses a virtual environment located at `.venv` in the project root.

To activate:
```bash
source /Users/markus/Projects/weclappy/.venv/bin/activate
```

To run tests:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Library Design Patterns

### Polymorphic Method Signatures

All methods that operate on entities follow a consistent pattern with named parameters:

- `endpoint` - The entity type (e.g., 'article', 'salesOrder', 'document')
- `id` - Optional entity ID, always as a named parameter
- `action` - Optional action/method name for special operations
- `params` - Query parameters as a dict

URL construction follows this pattern:
- With id and action: `{endpoint}/id/{id}/{action}`
- With id only: `{endpoint}/id/{id}`
- With action only: `{endpoint}/{action}`
- Otherwise: `{endpoint}`

### Examples of Consistent API

```python
# GET single entity
client.get("article", id="123")

# PUT update
client.put("article", id="123", data={...})

# DELETE
client.delete("article", id="123")

# Upload with id and action
client.upload("article", id="123", action="uploadArticleImage", data=bytes, ...)

# Download with id and action
client.download("salesInvoice", id="123", action="downloadLatestSalesInvoicePdf")
```

### Minimal Dependencies

The library only depends on `requests`. Avoid adding new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.

### Return Types

- Binary responses return `{"content": bytes, "content_type": str}`
- JSON responses return parsed dicts or lists
- Structured responses use `WeclappResponse` when `return_weclapp_response=True`

## Testing

- Unit tests in `tests/test_weclappy_unit.py` use mocks
- Integration tests in `tests/test_weclappy_integration.py` require live API credentials
- Run unit tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_weclappy_unit.py -v`

## Changelog

IMPORTANT: Always update `CHANGELOG.md` when making changes to the library.

- Add new features under `## Unreleased` section
- Use Keep a Changelog format: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- When releasing, move Unreleased items to a new version section with date
- Be specific about what changed and why it matters to users

## Deployment

Releases are published automatically via GitHub Actions when a release is created.

1. Update version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release date
3. Commit, push, and create a GitHub Release with tag `vX.Y.Z`

See `PYPI.md` for detailed instructions.

## Library Scope

Keep weclappy as a **general-purpose API client**. Include only:
- HTTP operations (get, post, put, delete, upload, download)
- Pagination handling
- Error parsing and structured exceptions
- Content type inference for uploads

Do NOT include application-specific helpers like:
- Custom attribute access patterns
- Tag manipulation helpers
- Business logic or workflow helpers

These belong in the consuming application, not the library.
