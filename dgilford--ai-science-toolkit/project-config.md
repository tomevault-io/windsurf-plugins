# AGENTS.md

This repository is shared between Codex and Claude Code.

## Shared Guidance

Use `CLAUDE.md` as the source of truth for durable repository context, workflow notes, and skill-development conventions. Codex should read and follow the applicable project guidance there unless it conflicts with higher-priority Codex instructions.

## Agent-Specific Notes

- Claude Code uses `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/`.
- Codex uses this `AGENTS.md` entry point and `.codex/`.
- Keep shared repository knowledge in `CLAUDE.md` unless it is genuinely specific to one agent.
- Keep local/session state in `.ai/` when using the existing handoff workflow.

## Editing Rule

For Claude skills, edit the repo copy under `skills/`, then sync with `scripts/sync.sh`. Do not edit installed copies directly.
