# Measure Twice, Cut Once

Plan deliberately before implementation, then hand off the work with the right
model, skills, and first step.

## Measure Twice: Plan Before Drafting

For non-trivial plans or ambiguous work, prefer `/grill-me` if that skill is
installed. If it is not installed, use the same interaction pattern directly:
ask one question at a time, include your recommended answer, and inspect the
codebase instead of asking when the answer is discoverable.

Skip grilling for obvious single-step changes.

## Cut Once: Implementation Handoff

When creating or updating an implementation plan, end the plan with a short
`Implementation Recommendation` section.

Include:

- **Model:** Recommend a specific model that fits this task. Pick by task
  shape, not by habit:
  - Small, well-scoped wording/docs/script/config edits: name a fast
    implementation-tier model currently available in this environment.
  - Complex debugging, architecture-heavy work, refactors with unclear
    trade-offs, or anything safety-critical: name a strong reasoning model
    currently available in this environment.
  - If the task does not clearly favor a tier, say so explicitly and let the
    user choose.
  - Never hardcode a single model as a universal default. Never invent a model
    name that is not currently available; if available models are unknown,
    describe the desired tier instead.
- **Skills:** Recommend any relevant installed skills to attach for the
  implementation phase. If none fit, say so explicitly. Split these into:
  - **Attach/load before coding:** skills that should shape implementation.
  - **Run after only if requested:** opt-in retro/review skills the user may
    invoke on demand.
- **Why:** Give a one-sentence reason tied to the task shape, such as docs,
  UI, debugging, refactor, migration, packaging, or code review.

Keep this section concise. It should help the user start the next chat with the
right context, not reopen the design discussion.

If a plan recommends any **Attach/load before coding** skills, make the first
implementation todo: `Load recommended implementation skills/rules and confirm
scope`. Do not add opt-in retro skills to startup todos.

After implementation, the user may opt in to a retro on demand. Do not run a
retro automatically.
