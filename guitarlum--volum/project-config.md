# VoLum workflow (vibe coding + safety nets)

## Mindset

- Ship **small vertical slices**: one behavior, one bugfix, or one refactor path per pass—**working build + tests** before the next idea.
- Spikes are fine; **delete or fold** dead spike code before you call the iteration done.
- Match **existing** naming, patterns, and file layout. No drive-by cleanups outside the task.

## Every meaningful iteration (before you stop or hand off)

1. **Run tests** when C++/NAM/plugin logic changed:
   - `NeuralAmpModeler/scripts/run-tests-win.ps1` (Release x64), or the equivalent CI command you are using.
   - macOS parity: `NeuralAmpModeler/scripts/run-tests-mac.sh`; sanitizer parity: `NeuralAmpModeler/scripts/run-tests-mac.sh --sanitize`.
2. **Build and launch the standalone app** when VoLum **UI** changed (layout, controls, styling) so you can judge the result:
   - `NeuralAmpModeler/scripts/run-app-win.ps1` (Release x64). Close a running VoLum if postbuild cannot copy the exe.
3. **Append a changelog line** so you can bisect and remember intent:
   - Prefer `NeuralAmpModeler/installer/changelog.txt` (keep project style: date + short note).
   - One line per user-visible or behavior change; include breaking preset/state format bumps.
4. **Update user docs** when behavior is user-facing:
   - Keep `docs/user-guide.en.md` and `docs/user-guide.de.md` in sync.
   - Refresh stable `docs/user-guide-*.png` screenshots when the visible UI changes.
5. **Commit** in a **single coherent chunk** when possible (easy `git revert`). If the user prefers WIP commits, say so in chat.

## Tests are mandatory, not optional

- **Write tests for every confirmed-working feature or bugfix.** Do not wait for the user to ask.
- New DSP behavior → doctest in `NeuralAmpModeler/tests/`. Cover: no NaN, passthrough at zero mix, bounded output, all modes.
- Main signal-chain behavior → `VoLumProcessingPlan.h` plus `test_volum_processing_plan.cpp` when it can be expressed as routing/enablement decisions.
- New parameter → pin its index and step size in `test_eparam_order.cpp` / `test_keyboard_steps.cpp`.
- New serialization path → version-branch test in `test_volum_chunk_version.cpp` and chunk round-trip/bounds coverage in `test_volum_chunk_codec.cpp`.
- New main amp `.nam` under `rigs/` → keep `test_nam_rigs.cpp` loading it.
- New PRE capture `.nam` under `rigs/PrePedals/` → update/keep `test_volum_pre_pedal_captures.cpp`, the PRE capture load-smoke in `test_nam_rigs.cpp`, and packaging verification.
- If a bug was caused by a missing test, add the test that would have caught it.

## Code hygiene is part of the task

- **Refactor proactively** when a file crosses ~500 lines or a class accumulates unrelated responsibilities. Don't wait to be asked.
- Follow the existing file split pattern (see AGENTS.md "UI File Map"). New controls go in the correct file, not dumped into a monolith.
- Keep fractal/art code in `VoLumFractalArt.h`, triptych/POST controls in `VoLumTriptych.h`, core controls in `VoLumCoreControls.h`.
- If you add a new file, update the file map table in `AGENTS.md`.

## Execution

- **You run** builds/tests in this environment; do not only tell the user what to run.
- After failures: diagnose, fix, retry—do not stop after one error.
- Kill stale `VoLum.exe` processes before rebuilding if the linker reports a locked file.
- Shell is **Windows PowerShell 5.x**: chain commands with `;` plus `if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { exit $LASTEXITCODE }`. Do not use `&&` / `||` — PowerShell 5.x rejects them as invalid statement separators.
- Multi-line `git commit` messages use a PowerShell **here-string**, not a bash heredoc (`<<'EOF'` fails here): `$m = @'` … `'@` on its own line, then `git commit -m $m`.

## Scope discipline

- Touch only files needed for the request. Do not add docs/README/ADRs unless asked.

## Branching

- `main` is the released branch, `dev` is the integration branch.
- After every release lands on `main`, merge `main` into `dev` and push.
- New feature work branches off the latest `dev` as `feature/<short-topic>`; merge feature back into `dev` once verified.
- Only promote `dev` to `main` as part of a release (see `release-manager` skill / `volum-release-packaging` rule).
