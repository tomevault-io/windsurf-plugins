# Git Remote: Prefer HTTPS On This Machine

On this machine, GitHub SSH (`git@github.com`, port 22) is unreachable and
`git fetch` / `git pull` / `git push` against `origin` time out after ~20s
before HTTPS retry is needed.

## Rule

For `guitarlum/VoLum`, run remote operations against the explicit HTTPS URL:

```powershell
git fetch https://github.com/guitarlum/VoLum.git <ref>
git push  https://github.com/guitarlum/VoLum.git <branch>
```

After pushing, refresh the local tracking ref so `git status` shows
`up to date`:

```powershell
git fetch https://github.com/guitarlum/VoLum.git <branch>:refs/remotes/origin/<branch>
```

## Why not just change `origin`?

The `vo-lum-workflow.mdc` safety rules (and the global git safety protocol)
say **never modify git config from the agent**. The user can run
`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/guitarlum/VoLum.git` once on
this machine to make HTTPS permanent; until then, use the explicit URL in
every remote command.

## When to skip this rule

- On a different machine where SSH to GitHub works (don't assume).
- For repos other than `guitarlum/VoLum` (check with `git remote -v` first).
- If the user explicitly asks to use SSH.
