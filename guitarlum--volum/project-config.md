# VoLum Release And Packaging

Branch/workflow facts:

- `CI` uploads `VoLum-win` and `VoLum-mac`; automatic push/PR runs target `dev` and `main`.
- Manual `CI` runs build the selected ref unless checkout is overridden.
- `Release Native` is main-only: it checks out `main`, bumps metadata, tags, then builds from that tag.
- Regular CI now runs Windows/macOS doctests, macOS sanitizer doctests, NAMCore regression tests, Windows installer smoke verification, package layout checks, and VST3 validation through pluginval plus the Steinberg validator when available.

Branch policy (use this whenever starting new work):

- Long-lived branches: `main` is the released branch; `dev` is the integration branch.
- Right after any release lands on `main`, merge `main` into `dev` (`git checkout dev && git merge origin/main`) and push, so `dev` carries the released commits + version metadata.
- Feature work always branches off the latest `dev`, e.g. `feature/<short-topic>`.
- When a feature is verified, merge it back into `dev` (PR or fast-forward). Do not merge feature branches directly into `main`.
- Promote `dev` to `main` only as part of a release (use `release-manager` skill for the PR; see `Release Native` workflow above).
- Keep unrelated local dirt (especially `iPlug2` ASIO patch dirt) out of any of these merges.
- Packaging CI fixes should run on a fix branch first. Merge to `dev` only after branch CI is green, unless the user explicitly asks to iterate directly on `dev`.

Packaging layout:

- Dev rigs live in `rigs/`; shipped artifacts rename/copy them as `VoLumRigs/`.
- Windows installer writes `HKLM\Software\VoLum\NeuralAmpModeler\VoLumRigsRoot`.
- Legacy installs may expose `AmpeteRigsPath`; code treats that as a fallback.
- Portable packages keep `VoLum.vst3` and sibling `VoLumRigs/` together.
- macOS standalone embeds `VoLumRigs` in `VoLum.app/Contents/Resources`.
- macOS VST3 zip keeps `VoLumRigs` beside `VoLum.vst3`.
- macOS installer app packages must use `pkgbuild --analyze` metadata with
  `BundleIsRelocatable=false` for `VoLum.app`; otherwise `installer` may update
  a build-staged app instead of writing `/Applications/VoLum.app`.
- macOS installer smoke tests should run through
  `NeuralAmpModeler/scripts/smoke-installer-mac.sh` so local and CI behavior stay
  identical.
- PRE NAM captures live in `rigs/PrePedals/` during development and ship as `VoLumRigs/PrePedals/`; package verification must check any `.nam` files in that folder, not only the directory.
- Never apply Finder custom icons to signed VST3 bundles. Finder icons create root `Icon?` metadata files that break strict code-signature verification after zip/unzip.
- Before signing or zipping macOS bundles, scrub `Icon?`, `._*`, `.DS_Store`, and extended attributes; verify the staged VST3 before creating the portable zip.
- When macOS packaging CI fails with `resource fork, Finder information, or similar detritus not allowed` or `unsealed contents present in the bundle root`, inspect root files and xattrs with `NeuralAmpModeler/scripts/debug-mac-vst3-signature.sh`.

Version metadata:

- Use `python3 bump_version.py patch|minor|major` for manual bumps.
- Release workflow uses `prepare_release.py`, then `update_version-mac.py` and `update_installer-win.py`.
- Keep `config.h`, `installer/VoLum.iss`, and `resources/*.plist` versions consistent.
- macOS plist filenames keep `NeuralAmpModeler-*` even though product name is `VoLum`.

Release notes:

- Inspect actual assets with `gh release view` before writing notes.
- Describe only user-facing changes since the previous published release. Do not include manual test plans, internal RC-only bugs, or fixes for behavior that never shipped publicly.
- Mention concrete asset names and install path choices when they affect what users download or install.
- Do not remove README screenshots or CI badges unless explicitly asked.
