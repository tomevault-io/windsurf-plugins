# Mokka

Mokka helps simulate expensive GPU infrastructure on CPU nodes by
simulating the presence of GPU and network devices at the driver level.

The idea is to simulate the driver footprint at a low level,
so all consumers and applications up the stack work without modifications.

## Principles

- Simple and minimal code
- Strive for high cohesion and low coupling
- Write idiomatic Golang code and project structure
- Red-green test-driven development
- Code should communicate your intent
- Code should be composable and testable
- Errors should not be ignored. Bubble them up with more context, log or handle. If it doesn't make sense to handle an error, you must leave an concise explanation why.

## Use cases

- The system should work well for clusters up to 100k nodes.
- Also, the system should be convenient to use in local, low-scale clusters

## Tech Stack

- Modern Golang 1.26
- Kubernetes as a main deployment target
- Tilt for local development and CI E2E test environment setup

## Testing

- Use testify/require for test assertions
- When changing Golang codebase, make sure `make lint-fix` works without violations. Run `make test` to run changes against existing test suite.
- When modify helm chart, make sure to run `make helm-tests` in order to ensure that the Helm chart is not broken.
- Add only meaningful tests
- Use t.Parallel() where possible to speed up test execution

## CI/CD

- Github Actions must be used for CI/CD
- Use Makefile commands in Github Action pipelines to keep pipeline logic lean and be able to reproduce the same commands locally

## Logging

- use a globally registered instance of zap.L() logger
- Ensure sufficient and meaningful logging in the new or modified codebase.
- Use log level appropriately. Debug level is or diagnosing or understanding internal execution; normally disabled in production and enabled during development. Info level is for meaningful, expected lifecycle or business events. Warning is for something unexpected, but the operation or service can continue. Error level is for The current operation failed and could not recover at this layer.

## Comments

- When leaving a comment in code, it should explain intent where it's not obvious — why we are doing something, not what we are doing, in most cases. Don't write comments based on the current conversation context; they should generally be valuable long-term for readers.

## Docs

- Write high-quality technical documentation for this project using **MkDocs with the Material theme**.
- First, inspect the project structure, source code, configuration, existing documentation, examples, and tests. Build an accurate mental model before writing. 
- Do not invent behavior or capabilities that are not supported by the repository.

### Writing style

* Be concise, direct, and technically precise.
* Explain concepts in plain language before introducing specialized terminology.
* Focus on what the system does, why it exists, how its parts fit together, and how users interact with it.
* Describe implementation at the architectural level: summarize the approach, important components, data flow, lifecycle, and design decisions.
* Do not walk through source code line by line or document trivial implementation details.
* Use concrete examples where they improve understanding.
* Avoid marketing language, filler, repetition, and generic introductions.
* Define acronyms and project-specific terms on first use.

### Structure

The site has three top-level spaces. Place a page by who is reading it, not by
what it is about.

* **General** — someone learning or operating Mokka. Overview, Getting Started,
  Architecture, Reference, Troubleshooting, FAQ.
* **Guides** — someone with a specific goal. How-to scenarios and Tasks.
* **Contributing** — someone changing Mokka. Local development, testing,
  enhancement proposals, pull requests.

Within General, order pages so each builds progressively on the last: Overview → Getting
started → Concepts → Architecture → Reference → Troubleshooting.

Placement rules:

* Assume the reader is running Mokka in Kubernetes. The local `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  build is the contributor workflow and belongs under Contributing.
* Every fact has exactly one home. Link to it; never restate it. A fact written
  twice is a fact that will disagree with itself.
* The landing page says what Mokka is, shows one install, and routes. No
  reference tables — it is the most-read and least-maintained page.
* Architecture pages describe the moving parts, how they connect, and how the
  system behaves. Each component gets its own page under Architecture, covering
  what it does and how it behaves.
* A guide is customer-facing and self-contained: it runs without a repository
  clone, installs published artifacts, and keeps its assets beside it. A guide
  that needs the repo is a test script, not a guide.
* Create only pages the project justifies. Do not add a section to complete an
  outline.

Create only pages justified by the project. Do not add empty or generic sections merely to follow this outline.

### MkDocs Material features

Use Material features when they materially improve comprehension:

* admonitions such as `note`, `tip`, `warning`, and `example`;
* content tabs for meaningful alternatives;
