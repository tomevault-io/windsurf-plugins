## Intro

I am building 'BA Copilot', where BA stands for Business Analysts. I will sometimes refer to it as bacp.

## BA Copilot MVP

### Overview

It is an assistant for business analysts. The MVP will be a an ai chatbot type tool, which will render BPMN diagrams using bpmn-js. The user can then iterate on them either with:

- additional discussion
- editing the diagram directly (bpmn-js supports this)

### UI Description

Here is a hierarchical, indented bullet description of the BA Copilot MVP, focusing on its functionality for creating and iterating on BPMN diagrams:

BA Copilot Interface

Question Input Section

Users can input questions or requests related to business processes. Example: "Based on the doc content what have I missed?"

Process Section (Optional)

Allows users to upload or view BPMN diagrams in formats like .png, .vsdx, etc. Users can visualize and edit existing diagrams or create new ones. Example: A BPMN diagram showing a flow of "Register expense report", "Approve", and "Deny" processes.

Documents Section (Optional)

Users can upload relevant documents, such as PDFs, that might contain process details. Example: "Shelter - employee handbook.pdf" uploaded to provide context for the BPMN diagram.

Artifacts Section

Provides a space for related outputs or references to be displayed. Example: Diagram suggestions based on uploaded content.

Iterative BPMN Diagram Creation and Modification

Input Process

Users can pose questions or requests for modifications to existing processes. Example: Asking for missing steps in the process based on document content.

AI-Powered Suggestions

The system suggests additions or modifications to the BPMN diagram based on the content of uploaded documents or user queries. Example: Suggestion to add a task for checking the expense policy, citing specific sections from the uploaded handbook.

Diagram Editing

Users can interactively edit the BPMN diagram based on suggestions. Example: Adding a task "Check expense policy" with inputs and outputs like "Expense report" and "Checked expense report".

Documentation and References

The system references uploaded documents and highlights relevant sections. Example: Citing "Section 7. Claiming reimbursement for payments made on behalf of the company" from the employee handbook.

User Workflow

Start with a Question

User initiates the process by asking a question or making a request.

Upload Process Diagrams and Documents

User uploads existing diagrams and documents for context.

Receive AI-Generated Suggestions

System provides suggestions to enhance or correct the process flow.

Modify BPMN Diagram

User edits the BPMN diagram based on the received suggestions.

Iterate Until Satisfied

User continues to ask follow-up questions and modify the diagram until the desired outcome is achieved.

This BA Copilot MVP allows users to efficiently create, modify, and iterate on BPMN diagrams with contextual suggestions, leveraging uploaded documents and user queries.

## BA Copilot Vision

### Overview

The vision for this is that it will be the home for business analysts to get assistance relating to their jobs. It will protect itself network effects to increase the value of the product e.g. BA agencies posting their products in the toolkit section, and members discussing BA topics in community section. It will also protect itself via an ever improving model for BA tasks e.g. BPMN generation. Although it will never be trained on user data. It will grow via virality via a dropbox style 'refer a friend and you both get 100 AI credits'. Revenue will be via companies paying for it for their BAs. Revenue will also be via companies paying to list on the job board.
