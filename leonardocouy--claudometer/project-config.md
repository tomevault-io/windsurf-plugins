# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

# Claudometer (Tauri)

## Philosophy

This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut becomes someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt that slows the whole team down.

You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners you cut will be cut again.

Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.

## Project Overview

**Claudometer** is a tray-first desktop application for **macOS + Linux** that shows **Claude** and **Codex** usage limits in near real time.

The app can track usage from two providers:
- **Claude** (Anthropic): web cookie (`sessionKey`) or Claude Code CLI OAuth credentials.
- **Codex** (OpenAI): local Codex OAuth credentials or Codex CLI.

### Claude

Claude supports two authentication modes:
- **Web mode**: Claude.ai web session cookie (`sessionKey`)
- **CLI mode**: Claude Code CLI OAuth credentials (local Claude Code session)

Both Claude modes track the same metrics:
- 5-hour session utilization (`five_hour`)
- weekly utilization (`seven_day`)
- model-specific weekly utilization (`seven_day_*`, prefers `seven_day_sonnet`, then `seven_day_opus`)

**Web mode** authenticates via Claude web session cookie, sent as `Cookie: sessionKey=...` to `https://claude.ai/api/*`.

**CLI mode** authenticates via OAuth Bearer token, sent to `https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/*`.

### Codex

Codex supports two sources:
- **OAuth mode**: reads local Codex credentials (e.g. `~/.codex/auth.json` or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`) and calls HTTPS usage endpoints.
- **CLI mode**: shells out to the local `codex` binary.

## Tech Stack (Target)

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|--------------|
| App | Tauri v2 (Rust backend) + TypeScript UI |
| Runtime | Bun |
| Settings | `tauri-plugin-store` (non-sensitive) |
| Secrets | OS Keychain/Secret Service via `keyring` (session key) |
| Formatting/Lint | Biome |
| Tests | Rust unit tests for parsing/formatting (keep minimal) |

## Development Workflow

This repo uses OpenSpec for planning/requirements:
- Create proposal: `openspec list`, then add change under `openspec/changes/<change-id>/`, then `openspec validate <id> --strict`
- Implement after approval: follow `openspec/changes/<id>/tasks.md`

## Security & Privacy Rules

- Never log or persist the Claude `sessionKey` outside OS credential storage.
- Never include the session key in error messages, UI text, or telemetry.
- Never log, display, or persist OAuth tokens (Claude or Codex).
- Assume Claude web endpoints can change; handle errors and unauthorized states gracefully.
