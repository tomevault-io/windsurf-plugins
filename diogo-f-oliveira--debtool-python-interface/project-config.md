# AGENTS.md

## Project Purpose
- `DEBtool-Python-Interface` has two primary goals:
  - Provide Python tooling to interface with MATLAB DEBtool, including template-based generation of required species files:
    - `mydata_<species>.m`
    - `pars_init_<species>.m`
    - `predict_<species>.m`
    - `run_<species>.m`
  - Implement multitier DEB parameter estimation (individual and higher aggregation levels) based on the published multitier methodology.
- Prefer preserving compatibility with existing example workflows unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- Current status is pre-1.0; prioritize reliability and API clarity to support a near-term major release.

## Environment And Command Defaults
- Always run Python commands in the `debtoolpyif_dev` conda environment.
- Always run tests via conda environment:
  - `conda run -n debtoolpyif_dev python -m pytest ...`
- If a command uses package imports, prefer:
  - `conda run -n debtoolpyif_dev python ...`
- If a command needs `PYTHONPATH`, use:
  - `conda run -n debtoolpyif_dev python -m pytest ...` with `src` layout assumptions handled by project config or explicit env var only when needed.

## Testing Expectations
- For code changes, run relevant tests first, then broader tests if needed.
- Minimum validation for multitier changes:
  - `conda run -n debtoolpyif_dev python -m pytest tests/integration -m integration -q`
- When feasible, run:
  - `conda run -n debtoolpyif_dev python -m pytest -q`
- Keep unit tests fast and isolated from example folders and MATLAB.
- Keep integration tests aligned with the shared example workflow contract under `examples/`.
- When changing `examples/` structure, `load_data`, `create_tier_structure`, or `DataCollection` semantics, review and update both unit and integration tests together.
- See `tests/README.md` for the detailed testing strategy, current example contract, and planned estimation-test scope.
  
## Code Change Guidelines
- Keep path handling robust and cross-platform (`os.path.join` or `pathlib`).
- Avoid introducing breaking API changes without updating:
  - example scripts in `examples/`
  - integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- For changes affecting DEBtool generated files, preserve naming and expected DEBtool/add-my-pet conventions unless explicitly requested.
- When generating MATLAB numeric arrays, preserve missing and infinite values as MATLAB-compatible `NaN`, `Inf`, and `-Inf` tokens; do not coerce or drop them.
- Prefer small, targeted patches and keep public constructor signatures explicit.

## References
- Multitier paper (canonical link): `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380024001674`
- For shared parameter-estimation documentation, prioritize:
  - `docs/parameter_estimation/README.md`
  - `docs/parameter_estimation/MULTITIER_WORKFLOW.md`
  - `docs/parameter_estimation/DEBTOOL_FILES.md`
  - `docs/parameter_estimation/DEBTOOL_MULTITIER.md`
  - `docs/parameter_estimation/TEMPLATE_GENERATION.md`
  - `docs/parameter_estimation/MULTITIER.md`

## Output And Reporting
- After changes, report:
  - files modified
  - behavior change summary
  - exact test commands run and pass/fail outcome
- If tests cannot run, state the concrete blocker and next required action.
