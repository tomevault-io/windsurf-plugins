# Loopyard — Multi-Player Claude Code Runner

A Phoenix LiveView app that lets a team share and interact with Claude Code agents in real-time through a chat interface. Agents run code inside Docker containers.

**Multiplayer by design.** Two meanings:
1. **Multiple people** can watch and interact with agents simultaneously.
2. **One person, multiple windows** — tear off agent chats, service consoles, build logs into separate tabs. Every view has its own URL and stays in sync via PubSub.

All UI state is server-driven (assigns, PubSub). Never rely on client-side state.

## How it works

Loopyard is a **Docker control plane** with **AI agents** wired into it. Dev environments are Docker all the way down — compose clusters, named volumes, container images. Code lives in Docker volumes. Agents and humans interact with it exclusively through Docker.

**The control plane:** Each project gets a Docker Compose cluster — a workspace container (where agents exec commands), dev server containers (running the app), and stock services (postgres, redis, etc.). Code lives in a named Docker volume (`loopyard-<workspace_id>-code`) mounted at `/workspace` in every container. Agents write `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` directly to `.loopyard/workspace/`. Loopyard manages the container lifecycle, monitors health, and reconnects to running containers across server restarts.

**Source adapters — the ingress layer:** Source adapters (`Source.Local`, `Source.GitHub`) are how code gets INTO the volume, but they don't participate in the dev environment. Local uses Mutagen to sync host filesystem to the Docker volume. GitHub clones via API into the volume. Once code is in the volume, everything is Docker — agents have NO host filesystem access when containers are running. See [docs/SOURCE_ADAPTERS.md](docs/SOURCE_ADAPTERS.md).

**The agents:** Claude Code sessions run as GenServer processes. Each agent exec's into the workspace container to read/write code and run commands. Agents use MCP tools from `loopyard-container`: `exec` for commands, `write_file` for Dockerfile/docker-compose.yml, `docker_compose` for container lifecycle, `logs` for debugging. All tool operations go through Docker — `Docker.exec_in` for commands, `VolumeIO` for file I/O. Tool output is truncated for agents (via `Helpers.truncate_for_agent`, ~80 lines) to save context tokens, but streamed in full to the UI for humans. The setup agent bootstraps a project from scratch by examining the codebase and writing infrastructure files directly.

**The multiplayer layer:** Everything is wired through PubSub. Chat messages, terminal I/O, service status changes, build output — all broadcast to every connected viewer. LiveViews subscribe and render. The terminal system supports both browser (xterm.js via Phoenix Channel) and SSH access to the same shared session. Multiple people can watch an agent work, type in the same terminal, or monitor services simultaneously.

**The key insight:** agents and humans use the same tools and views. Agents use MCP tools (`exec`, `read_file`, `docker_compose`). Humans see the same data in the UI (service logs, file browser, terminal). The MCP tools are structured wrappers around the same Docker operations the terminal console uses. This means anything an agent does is visible, reproducible, and debuggable by a human.

## Coordination hardening (harden-resume-state)

The coordination layer went through a sprint of hardening moves (see [plans/coordination-hardening.md](plans/coordination-hardening.md) and the two follow-up audits). Landed surfaces + rules a new contributor needs to know:

**Observability surfaces (all at `/system`):**
- `/system/events` — live event tap (ring buffer, per-topic rate)
- `/system/sagas` — multi-step ops + rollback + journal state
- `/system/quarantine` — crash-looping actors, release controls
- `/system/orphans` — tracked resources without a live owner
- `/system/recovery` — checkpointer snapshot size/age, last boot replay time
- `/system/reconcilers` — drift detection runs
- `/system` — aggregated health map (`:healthy | :degraded | :down` per component)

**Adding a new broadcast event:**
1. Add a struct to the relevant publisher module in `lib/loopyard/events/` (e.g. `Loopyard.Events.ChatAgent.SomeEvent`).
2. Add a `publish/1` clause for the struct.
3. NEVER call `Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast/3` outside `lib/loopyard/events/`. The `test/loopyard/pubsub_boundary_test.exs` CI test will fail if you do.
4. Every subscriber behaviour gains a required `@callback on_<event>(struct, socket)`. Missing callback = compile warning (no `@optional_callbacks`).

**Adding a new LV subscriber:**
1. `@behaviour Loopyard.Events.<Topic>.Subscriber`
2. Implement every `on_*` callback explicitly (even if just `{:noreply, socket}`) — we do not use `@optional_callbacks`.
3. Standard dispatch: one `handle_info/2` per event struct that delegates to the callback.

**Adding a new state-machine actor (future):**
