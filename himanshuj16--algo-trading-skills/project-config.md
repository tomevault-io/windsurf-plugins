# Algo-Trading-Skills Rule for Cursor

When building or modifying algorithmic trading code, financial ML models, backtesting loops, risk controls, or broker integrations:

1. **Scan `skills/` Frontmatter**: Read the `SKILL.md` frontmatter in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` or query `index.json` to find relevant skills matching the task.
2. **Follow `agentskills.io` Standard**: Read `When NOT to Use` first (it names the cases the skill does not cover and hands each to the skill that does), then use the `Workflow`, `Common Pitfalls`, and `Verification` sections in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
3. **Reference Deep Context**: Read `references/standards.md`, `references/workflows.md`, and `scripts/` inside the target skill directory for implementation details.
4. **Verify Implementation**: Always verify code against the skill's verification checklist (`assets/checklist.md`) and run corresponding unit tests.
