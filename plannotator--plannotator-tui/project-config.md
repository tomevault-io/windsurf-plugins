# plannotator-tui — engineering notes

A small open-source terminal application. Optimize for a reader who has never seen the
code: clear module boundaries, boring Rust, no cleverness that needs a comment to defend it.

## Shape

```
crates/plannotator-tui-schema   annotation + anchor types and resolvers. Wire-exact with
                          Plannotator Workspaces. No I/O, no UI, no async. Pure functions.
crates/plannotator-tui          the app: parse → layout → draw → input. Talks to the schema crate,
                          never the other way round. Network clients live in their own
                          modules behind a trait so the app has one seam per external system.
herdr/                    the Herdr plugin manifest. The launcher it runs is
                          `plannotator-tui herdr open` (src/herdr/); no shell logic here.
```

Markdown parsing is `pulldown-cmark`; rendering to styled text is `tui-markdown`. We never
interpret markdown ourselves. Anything that needs to know "what is a heading" is a bug.

## Rules that are enforced (see `Cargo.toml` workspace lints)

- `unsafe` is forbidden. `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!`/`todo!` warn — production code returns
  errors or handles the `None`. Indexing warns: use `.get()`, iterators, or slice patterns.
- `println!`/`eprintln!` warn outside the CLI entry points; those opt out locally with a
  one-line `#[allow]` and a reason.
- `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` clean before commit.

## Rules that are judgement

- **Files stay small.** A module over ~300 lines is a signal to split by responsibility, not
  to add a second `impl` block. Tests live next to the code they test; when a test module
  outgrows the code, move it to `tests/` for that crate.
- **Tests are for behaviour that can regress.** One test per invariant, named for the
  invariant. No tests that restate the implementation, no mocks of our own types, no test
  helpers that need their own tests. Prefer a real temp dir over a fake filesystem, a real
  `TestBackend` over a fake terminal, real fixtures over builders.
- **Performance is structural, not micro.** Render once per block and cache; wrap on
  resize; touch only visible rows per frame; never reparse a whole document on an edit.
  Measure with `plannotator-tui --bench` before and after anything that changes those paths.
- **Errors carry context, not stack traces.** `anyhow` at the app boundary, typed errors in
  the schema crate. A user-facing failure names the file and what was being done.
- **No abstraction without a second caller.** No traits for one impl, no generics for one
  type, no builders for structs with four fields. A trait is justified only at a seam to an
  external system (Workspaces, Herdr, the clipboard) where a test needs a stand-in.
- **Ownership over cleverness.** Owned `String`s in long-lived structs; borrow in function
  signatures. Lifetimes in public types need a reason.
- **Commits are small and describe intent**, lowercase conventional style:
  `feat(schema): anchor resolution by rendered quote`.

## Data contract

Annotations are the Workspaces wire shape. The anchor object is opaque to the server; the
web client reads `originalText` (rendered text). Our fields ride alongside. See
`crates/plannotator-tui-schema/src/lib.rs` for the source of truth; do not redefine these types
elsewhere.
