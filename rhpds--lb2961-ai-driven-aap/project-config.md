# Lightspeed MCP Credential Flow

Lightspeed MCP is always enabled — there are no feature flags. If the role runs, it configures Lightspeed.

## Three Roles Consume MCP Credentials

The same Lightspeed client ID and secret are used by three roles, each with its own variable name:

| Role | Client ID variable | Client Secret variable |
|------|--------------------|------------------------|
| `lightspeed_mcp_server` | `lightspeed_mcp_client_id` | `lightspeed_mcp_client_secret` |
| `code_server_ai_client` | `ai_client_lightspeed_mcp_client_id` | `ai_client_lightspeed_mcp_client_secret` |
| `continue_dev_config` | `continue_dev_lightspeed_mcp_client_id` | `continue_dev_lightspeed_mcp_client_secret` |

## Where Credentials Are Set

Vault-encrypted values go in **agnosticv** (`sandboxes-gpte/AI_DRIVEN_ANSIBLE_AUTOMATION/common.yaml`), not in this collection's defaults. The defaults here are empty strings — they get overridden at deploy time.

## Container Details

The `lightspeed_mcp_server` role runs `ghcr.io/redhatinsights/red-hat-lightspeed-mcp:latest` in Podman, passing credentials as environment variables `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID` and `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET`. The MCP endpoint is `http://localhost:<port>/mcp`.

## Template Behavior

Both `claude-settings.json.j2` and `config.yaml.j2` always include the `lightspeed-mcp` server entry. The AAP MCP servers (`aap-job-mgmt`, etc.) are still conditional on `ai_client_mcp_enabled` / `continue_dev_mcp_enabled`.
