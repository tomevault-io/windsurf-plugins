# Go Development Standards

Use this rule for all Go service work.

## Readability and structure
- Follow standard Go guidance, especially Effective Go and Go Code Review Comments.
- Prefer short, explicit functions with clear names over highly generic helpers.
- Keep packages cohesive. If a file grows because it mixes transport, orchestration, parsing, and state logic, split it.
- Prefer constructor-injected dependencies and small interfaces owned by the consumer package.
- Keep exported APIs minimal and documented.
- Avoid hidden global state unless it is a true process singleton and the lifecycle is obvious.

## Service architecture
- Services should remain explicit daemons with clear startup, steady-state, and shutdown phases.
- Use structured logging with stable field names.
- Implement graceful shutdown with signal handling, context propagation, and cleanup ordering.
- Any retry loops, watchers, or goroutine ownership rules should be documented in comments when non-obvious.

## Error handling
- Return errors with enough context to explain the failed operation.
- Do not hide errors unless the failure is intentionally best-effort and the comment explains why that is safe.
- Prefer explicit sentinel or typed handling only when callers need branching behavior.
- Avoid panic in production paths. If panic is retained for an invariant, document why the invariant is process-fatal.

## Concurrency and lifecycle
- Propagate `context.Context` through long-lived or cancelable operations.
- Make goroutine ownership obvious. The creator should define shutdown and error semantics.
- Guard shared mutable state deliberately and comment on invariants if synchronization is subtle.
- Prefer deterministic timers and injected clocks in test-sensitive code.

## Code organization
- Group related functionality in separate files such as `main.go`, `config.go`, `dbus.go`, `watcher.go`, `logger.go`, or `service.go`.
- Prefer `internal` seams via package structure and unexported helpers over deeply coupled utility packages.
- Store configuration, filesystem paths, and external command behavior behind narrow seams so tests can fake them.

## Comments
- Add comments when logic encodes operational knowledge that future edits could break.
- Good comment topics:
  - shutdown ordering and why it matters
  - D-Bus or systemd contract assumptions
  - race-prevention invariants
  - retry or backoff trade-offs
  - reasons a particular interface seam exists
- Do not restate obvious control flow.

## Testing and quality
- Format with `gofmt -s`.
- Run `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` only in the touched Go module.
- Run `golangci-lint run --new-from-rev=HEAD~1 ./...` so linting is scoped to the changed Go diff.
- Prefer table-driven tests for behavioral branches.
- Test failure paths and boundary conditions, not only happy paths.
- Use fakes or test servers for D-Bus, HTTP, filesystem, and time-dependent behavior when possible.
- Keep tests focused on behavior, not private implementation details.

## Lint posture
- Prefer strict readability-oriented linting for new code.
- `nolint` requires a targeted rule name and a short justification when the reason is not obvious from the line itself.
- If an existing file has legacy lint debt, avoid spreading that pattern into new code.
