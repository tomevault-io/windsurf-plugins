# CTF Challenge Repository

This repo is used to solve CTF (Capture The Flag) cybersecurity challenges. Claude acts as an expert CTF player.

## Active Competition

**ALWAYS read `competition.md` first** — it has the current flag format, competition URL, and notes. Use that flag format for all grep/search commands instead of generic patterns.

## Core Principles

- **Speed over elegance** — CTF solutions don't need to be production-quality. Quick, working exploits win.
- **Try the obvious first** — `strings`, `file`, `xxd`, `curl` before deep analysis.
- **Read everything** — Challenge descriptions, source comments, HTML comments, HTTP headers all contain hints.
- **Automate brute force** — If a search space is small (<10M), script it instead of thinking harder.
- **Document what worked** — After solving, note the technique in the skill files for future reference.

## Project Structure

```
challenges/
  <category>/
    <challenge-name>/       # One directory per challenge
      README.md             # Challenge description, URL, hints
      solve.py              # Solution script
      flag.txt              # Captured flag
      WRITEUP.md            # Short post-solve writeup
      files/                # Challenge-provided files
scripts/                    # Reusable utility scripts
tools/                      # Custom tools
.agents/skills/             # CTF skill files (category-specific techniques)
```

## Challenge Workflow

When given a challenge to solve:

1. **Create directory**: `challenges/<category>/<challenge-name>/`
2. **Save description**: Write challenge info to `README.md`
3. **Download files**: Save provided files to `files/` subdirectory
4. **Analyze**: Run initial recon based on category
5. **Solve**: Write exploit in `solve.py` (or appropriate language). Non-trivial solution scripts should be saved to files in the challenge directory so the writeup can reference them. Quick one-liners and small snippets can run inline.
6. **Capture**: Save flag to `flag.txt`
7. **Write up**: Write a short writeup to `WRITEUP.md` (see format below)

## Writeup Format

After solving every challenge, write `WRITEUP.md` in the challenge directory. Keep it concise — a few paragraphs, not an essay.

```markdown
# <Challenge Name>

**Category:** <category> | **Points:** <points if known> | **Flag:** `<flag>`

## Overview
One-sentence description of what the challenge gives you.

## Solution
Short explanation of the approach and key insights. Include relevant details
like vulnerability type, algorithm, or trick used. Reference `solve.py` for
the full exploit.

## Key Takeaways
- Bullet points of techniques/lessons worth remembering for future challenges.
```

## Environment & Tools

### Available on this system (Windows with WSL-like environment)
- Python 3 with: pwntools, pycryptodome, z3-solver, sympy, gmpy2, requests, beautifulsoup4
- Node.js (for JS challenges)
- Standard CLI: curl, nc/ncat, base64, xxd, strings, file, binwalk
- Git, Docker (if needed for challenge infrastructure)

### Install as needed
```bash
pip install pwntools pycryptodome z3-solver sympy gmpy2 requests beautifulsoup4 pillow
```

## Flag Formats

**Check `competition.md` for the active flag format.** Use it in all search commands.

Common flag formats (when no competition is active):
- `flag{...}`, `FLAG{...}`
- `CTF{...}`, `ctf{...}`
- `picoCTF{...}`, `MetaCTF{...}`, `HTB{...}`, `DUCTF{...}`, `ENO{...}`

Search using the active format: `strings <file> | grep -i "ENO{"` (replace `ENO` with current prefix)

## Skills Reference

Use `/solve-challenge` to start solving. Category-specific skills are loaded automatically:

| Skill | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| `ctf-web` | XSS, SQLi, SSTI, SSRF, JWT, auth bypass, file upload, prototype pollution |
| `ctf-pwn` | Buffer overflow, format string, heap, kernel, race conditions, ROP |
| `ctf-reverse` | Binary analysis, VMs, obfuscation, anti-debug, game hacking |
| `ctf-crypto` | RSA, AES, ECC, ZKP, PRNG, classical ciphers, Z3 solving |
| `ctf-forensics` | Disk images, memory dumps, PCAP, event logs, file carving |
| `ctf-osint` | Social media, geolocation, DNS, username enumeration |
| `ctf-malware` | Obfuscated scripts, C2 traffic, PE analysis, protocol reversing |
| `ctf-misc` | Encodings, jail escapes, SDR/RF, QR codes, esoteric langs |
| `ctf-stego` | Image/audio steganography, LSB, spectrograms, hidden data |
| `ctf-recon` | Target reconnaissance, port scanning, service enumeration |
| `write-exploit` | Iterative exploit script development with testing loop |

## Coding Conventions for Exploits

- **Save non-trivial solve scripts to files** (e.g. `solve.py`) in the challenge directory so writeups can reference them. Small one-liners are fine to run inline.
- Use `pwntools` for binary exploitation and network interaction
- Use `requests` for HTTP-based challenges
- Use `pycryptodome` for crypto operations
- Print the flag clearly at the end: `print(f"FLAG: {flag}")`
- Add `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang
- Use `argparse` or pwntools' `args` for REMOTE/LOCAL switching
- Handle both local and remote targets when possible

## When Stuck

1. Re-read the challenge description for missed hints
