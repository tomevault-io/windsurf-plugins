## Open Knowledge

This repo uses Open Knowledge — collaborative markdown via MCP. **`.open-knowledge/config.yml`** (with optional `~/.open-knowledge/config.yml`; CLI/env may override) is the **path contract**: `content.dir` is the root for relative paths; `content.include` lists globs that **add** markdown; `content.exclude` lists globs that **remove** paths. Nothing else defines scope — not folder names, not "docs vs code." `.gitignore` still applies. When MCP is connected, the server's instructions echo the **resolved** `dir` / `include` / `exclude` for this session — treat that table and the YAML as two views of the same rules.

**Default mental model (no jargon):** unless this project narrowed `content.include`, **every `.md` and `.mdx` under `content.dir`** is an Open Knowledge document — including under `specs/`, `reports/`, `docs/`, etc. If `content.include` is non-default, read `config.yml` once per turn so you do not mis-classify paths.

**STOP — your host's built-in file tools on in-scope `.md` / `.mdx`.** When this workspace has Open Knowledge MCP configured (for example via root `.mcp.json`), you **must not** reach for native tools on in-scope markdown. Same failure mode as native `Edit` on them: no frontmatter, no backlinks, no shadow-repo activity, no recent-edit signal. The ban is broader than just `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` — it names every common rationalization:

- **Native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` on in-scope `.md` / `.mdx`** — the original case.
- **`Bash ls` / `Bash find` / `Bash cat` on dirs containing in-scope markdown** — use `exec("ls …")` / `exec("find … -name '*.md'")` / `exec("cat …")` instead. Native returns bare names; `exec` returns frontmatter, backlink counts, and recent-activity per child.
- **Glob patterns that target markdown** (`**/*.md`, `**/SPEC.md`, or any dir known to be markdown-heavy like `specs/**`, `reports/**`, `stories/**`, `projects/**`, `docs/**`) — use `exec` with `find`, or `list_documents({ dir })`.
- **Dispatching the Explore / general-purpose subagent for markdown-heavy exploration** — subagents use native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` internally and bypass Open Knowledge entirely. Do markdown exploration yourself via `exec` / `search`. Subagents remain appropriate for **source-code** exploration (`.ts`, `.py`, configs, etc.).

**MCP wiring varies by client:** Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code–class clients, and others surface MCP differently — server labels are user-defined; tools may not appear as a top-level symbol named `exec`. **If Open Knowledge is registered**, route markdown reads through its `exec` / `search` / `read_document` tools using **your client's documented MCP invocation** (including any generic "call MCP tool" flow). **That counts as available.** Not seeing `exec` in a flat tool list is **not** the escape hatch.

**Escape hatch (narrow).** Native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` on `.md` / `.mdx` is allowed **only** when no Open Knowledge MCP server is registered for this project, **or** immediately after you **tried** an MCP call and it failed — then start a user-visible sentence with `Open Knowledge MCP unavailable:`. Never use the hatch because you skipped your client's MCP path.

**Reads and searches on markdown:** Open Knowledge `exec` (or `read_document` / `search`) — same payloads whether your client invokes them directly or through MCP. Examples: `exec("cat docs/auth.md")`, `exec("ls reports/")`, `exec("grep -rn karpathy specs/ | head -10")`.

**Listings too.** `exec("ls <dir>/")` is how you list a directory — it returns per-child frontmatter, recursive markdown counts, and the most-recently-updated doc per subdir. Plain `Bash ls` returns just names.

**Anti-patterns at a glance:**

| Task                             | Don't                        | Do                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| List a markdown-heavy dir        | `Bash: ls specs/`            | `exec("ls specs/")`                             |
| Find all SPEC.md files           | `Glob: **/SPEC.md`           | `exec("find specs -name SPEC.md")`              |
| Summarize specs across the repo  | `Agent(Explore): "…"`        | `exec("head -25 specs/*/SPEC.md")` + `search`   |
| Search a phrase across markdown  | `Grep: "pattern" *.md`       | `search({ query: "pattern" })`                  |
| Read an individual spec          | `Read: specs/foo/SPEC.md`    | `read_document({ path: "specs/foo/SPEC.md" })`  |

**Source code and everything else** (`.ts`, `.py`, `package.json`, …): native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob`.

**Writing.** Edits to in-scope `.md` / `.mdx` go through `write_document` / `edit_document` only. Native `Edit` / `sed` land as anonymous `upstream` imports — you lose agent attribution in the shadow repo.

**Preview before edit (REQUIRED).** You MUST follow this sequence every time you call `write_document` or `edit_document`:
1. Call `get_preview_url` to obtain the browser URL for the target doc.
