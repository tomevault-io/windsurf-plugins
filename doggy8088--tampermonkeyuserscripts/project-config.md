# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Core userscripts live in `src/*.user.js`; each file is self-contained and shipped as-is to Tampermonkey.
- Feature-specific build sources sit under `dev/<script>/` (for example, `dev/Readability` and `dev/ChatGPTVoiceInput`) with `*.user.src.js` plus headers; build outputs are copied back into `src/`.
- Supporting assets and release notes live in `images/` and `docs/`. Keep docs close to the feature folder they describe.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Simple edits: modify the target file in `src/` and keep the metadata block intact.
- Build pipelines (per subfolder):
  - `cd dev/Readability && npm install && npm run build` to bundle the Readability-based context-menu scripts and sync them into `src/`.
  - `cd dev/ChatGPTVoiceInput && npm install && npm run build` for the voice input script.
  - `cd dev/dom-to-image && npm install && npm run build` for the DOM snapshot helper.
- After a build, verify the generated `*.user.js` appears in `src/` and retains the expected version header.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- `.editorconfig` enforces LF endings, UTF-8, trimmed whitespace, and `indent_size = 4` for `*.js` (Makefiles and batch files use tabs). Markdown keeps trailing spaces when needed.
- Userscript files follow `PascalCase.user.js` with a `// ==UserScript==` metadata block; keep fields minimal and aligned to Tampermonkey’s schema.
- Prefer `const`/`let`, early returns, and small helpers over deep nesting; avoid introducing dependencies unless scoped to a `dev/` build.
- Keep comments brief and practical, focusing on browser quirks, selectors, and shortcut mappings.

## Automated Intent & Commenting Policy
- For all future code updates, automated tooling and contributors should ensure rich, detailed comments are included in the code to capture the developer's intent, rationale, and any design choices. Automated tools (pre-commit hooks or CI checks) should assist in inserting or validating these intent comments where appropriate.
- 未來所有程式更新，都要自動幫我把我真正的意圖都寫成豐富且詳細的註解在程式碼中。

## Script Style Guide (Observed in `src`)
- Wrap each userscript in an IIFE and place `'use strict';` at the top of the wrapper.
- Keep the metadata block intact; include only needed `@grant` entries, add `@run-at` when timing matters, and keep `@match` scopes tight.
- Use 4-space indentation, semicolons, and blank lines between logical sections.
- Prefer `const` for constants and DOM handles, `let` for mutable state; some legacy scripts use `var`, so stay consistent within a given file.
- Keep helpers small and focused (`debounce`, `waitForElement`, `simulateClick`, `shouldIgnoreEvent`) and rely on early returns to avoid deep nesting.
- Hotkey handlers should ignore typing contexts (`input`, `textarea`, `[contenteditable]`), avoid modifier collisions, and call `preventDefault()` when taking over shortcuts.
- DOM queries should be defensive: check for null, use optional chaining, and short-circuit when elements are missing.
- For SPA pages, use `MutationObserver` plus URL change checks (often with debounce) or dispatch custom `locationchange` events via `history` overrides.
- When parsing DOM or JSON that might fail, wrap in `try/catch` and fail quietly; keep console logging purposeful or commented out.
- CSS injection is typically done with `GM_addStyle` and template literals; keep class names/regexes as constants and toggle via a root class when needed.
- When opening new tabs/windows from async flows, prefer `GM_openInTab()` with an explicit `@grant` so popup blockers do not block the navigation.
- Use `window.open()` only for synchronous user-gesture calls; if you must open after async work, document the fallback behavior when the browser blocks it.
- If a `src` file is a bundled output (large wrapper/codegen), edit the matching `dev/` source and rebuild instead of formatting the bundle.

## Userscript Header Pattern (Observed in `src`)
- Every script includes these fields in order: `@name`, `@version`, `@description`, `@license`, `@homepage`, `@homepageURL`, `@website`, `@source`, `@namespace`, `@author`.
- `@source` and `@namespace` both point to the raw GitHub URL for the same file under `src/`.
- `@homepage`, `@homepageURL`, and `@website` are consistently set to the author’s sites; keep them unchanged unless ownership changes.
- Add one or more `@match` lines (and `@exclude` when needed) after the core fields; keep patterns minimal and specific.
- Optional lines appear after the match block: `@run-at` (when timing matters), then `@icon`, and then `@require`/`@grant` as needed; if no GM APIs are used, omit `@grant` or use `@grant        none`.
- If a script does not need GM APIs, always include `@grant        none` to make the intent explicit.
- Align header values to the same column using spaces for readability.
