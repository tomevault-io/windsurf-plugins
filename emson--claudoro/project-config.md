# Claudoro

A Pomodoro timer that lives inside the Claude Code terminal: a live, ticking countdown in the
status line plus a render-decoupled end-of-block alarm. Open source, distributed as
`npm install -g claudoro` with a thin Claude Code plugin wrapper.

**Read first:** `specs/spec.md` (architecture, modules, data model, acceptance tests) and
`specs/decisions.md` (D-001..D-012, the authoritative rationale). The spec supersedes
`specs/charter.md` where they disagree. When in doubt, the decisions log wins.

## Core principle

> The code must always be **robust, flexible, and elegant.**

One architectural truth underpins everything (D-001): **the `pomo` CLI is the single source of
truth.** It owns all state, scheduling, and history. The status line, the `/pomo` command, and the
alarm are thin surfaces over it. The CLI runs with zero model involvement, so the core feature never
costs API tokens.

A second truth makes mutation safe (D-007): **derive, do not store, aggregates.** Counts, cycle
position, focus minutes, and streaks are folded from immutable records on read. There are no mutable
counters, so `undo`/`restore` are correct by construction.

## How we write code

Functional-first, composition over cleverness. Favour small, pure, well-named functions composed
into larger behaviour. Avoid complex code; if a function is hard to name or test, split it.

- **Pure core, impure edges.** Keep logic (timer math, derivation, rendering, formatting) as pure
  functions of their inputs. Push side effects (file I/O, `flock`, `spawn`, clock, stdout) to a thin
  boundary layer. A function reads the clock once and passes `now` down; it does not call
  `Date.now()` deep in a fold.
- **Compose, don't branch-pile.** Build a verb from discrete subfunctions
  (`resolvePaths → readState → mutate → writeAtomic`), not one long procedure. Prefer
  `map`/`filter`/`reduce` and data transformation over imperative mutation.
- **Data in, data out.** Functions take plain values and return plain values. Immutable updates
  (`{...state, run_state: 'paused'}`), no in-place mutation of shared objects.
- **Total functions.** Handle the empty/missing/corrupt case in the function, not at the call site.
  Missing state → `idle`; corrupt JSON → quarantine + reinit; never throw on the render path.
- **Explicit over implicit.** No hidden globals, no ambient singletons. Dependencies (paths, clock,
  fs) are passed in, which also makes them trivially mockable in tests.
- **Small modules with one job**, mirroring the spec's M1..M10. A file should fit in your head.

## Project conventions

- **Runtime:** Node ≥ 22 (20 is EOL), ES modules, no transpiler. Cross-platform via Node stdlib
  (`path`, `os`, `fs`, `child_process`) — identical code on macOS, Linux, Windows (D-005).
- **Dependencies:** zero runtime dependencies. Node stdlib only for core. Justify any new dev
  dependency in a PR; a tiny helper we can write ourselves beats a transitive tree. No `jq`, no
  shelling out for what Node can do in-process.
- **Types:** plain JS, typed via JSDoc and checked with `tsc --checkJs` (no build step). Domain
  shapes live in one place, `src/types.js`; reference them with `@typedef {import('./types.js')...}`.
- **No em-dashes in any content output** (use commas, colons, parentheses, or restructure).
- **Style:** match surrounding code. Descriptive names, early returns over nesting, comments only
  for the non-obvious *why*. Run the formatter/linter before committing.
- **Errors:** fail loud at the CLI boundary (clear message, non-zero exit); fail safe on the render
  path (degrade to passthrough or last-known, never crash the user's status line).

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **M1 CLI core & store** | argv dispatch; locked (`flock`) atomic read-modify-write of `state.json`; path resolution; derive-aggregates helper |
| **M2 Timer engine** | phase state + cadence (focus → short → long every `frequency`); transition modes `auto`/`balanced`/`manual` (D-006a) |
| **M3 Status-line renderer** | per-tick render from `state.json` (read-only, no lock); view modes; passthrough; opportunistic alarm-claim |
| **M4 Alarm & notify** | detached one-shot warning + end cues; single-fire via atomic claim; cross-platform sound, degrade to bell |
| **M5 History/undo/restore** | JSONL records; fold for queries; mandatory backup before any destructive op |
| **M6 Help & output** | one TTY-aware renderer: pretty on a TTY, clean plain text when captured, `--json` when asked (D-008) |
