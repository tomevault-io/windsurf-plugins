# Repository Working Guide

## Scope and required reading

These instructions apply to the entire repository unless a nested `AGENTS.md` or `AGENTS.override.md` supplies narrower rules.

Before v2, builder, Nuvio schema, or export work, read:

- `README.md`
- `docs/v2/BUILDER_KNOWLEDGE.md`
- the relevant GitHub issue

Before v2 product, UX, startup, template, recipe, Search/Add, presentation, or project-workflow work, also read:

- `docs/v2/BUILDER_PRODUCT_PLAN.md`
- `docs/v2/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md`

Before hierarchy creation or a new hierarchy-family issue, also read:

- `docs/v2/BUILDER_HIERARCHY_CREATION.md`
- the focused document for every existing family being reused or changed

`BUILDER_PRODUCT_PLAN.md` is the durable product-direction source. `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` is the durable Dave/ChatGPT/Codex process. Repository implementation, deterministic tests, and confirmed manual evidence override obsolete plans. Do not silently treat an open product decision as a confirmed requirement.

## Product boundaries

- v1 is the stable TMDB ID lookup and Nuvio JSON export application at the repository root.
- v2 is the active, isolated mobile-first visual Nuvio Collection Builder under `/builder/`, powered primarily by TMDB. It is not yet advertised as a released replacement for v1.
- Existing lookup and copy-ID workflows remain part of the product.
- Do not rewrite or remove stable v1 features merely to modernise the code.
- React/Vite under `/builder/` is the confirmed builder direction; keep domain, parsing, validation, migration, serialization, and ID logic framework-independent.
- Trakt integration is outside the current project scope unless explicitly approved in a future issue.

## Git and issue workflow

- Never work directly on `main`.
- Discussion, discovery, comparison, and read-only investigation do not require a GitHub issue.
- Before making a meaningful repository change, create or approve one focused GitHub issue and one dedicated branch from updated `main`.
- A substantial investigation may use an issue for durable tracking when helpful, but an issue is not required merely to explore an idea.
- Use one issue per branch. Inspect unexpected main commits, including legitimate automated maintenance, before synchronising them into task work.
- Keep work limited to the approved issue; do not include unrelated cleanup.
- Do not open a pull request unless Dave asks.
- After Dave authorises it, a pull request is the normal final review gate for meaningful v2 work.
- Meaningful V2 pull requests use a normal merge commit by default unless Dave explicitly chooses another method. Do not squash, rebase, or force-push unless specifically authorised. Use issue-closing syntax where applicable so the focused issue closes through the merged pull request.
- Do not merge, close the issue, or delete the branch until Dave explicitly approves after review and testing.
- After a successful merge, verify required checks and automatic Pages publication before performing approved local/remote branch cleanup and returning to synchronized `main`.
- Stop and report conflicts, unexpected local changes, or ambiguous scope.
- Use clear commits and report the final commit hash.

## Production safeguards

- Preserve existing export behaviour unless the issue explicitly changes it.
- Preserve imported unknown/community JSON fields wherever possible.
- Do not invent or guess unsupported Nuvio source types.
- Do not represent direct movie, direct series, or season sources as supported unless current Nuvio evidence confirms them.
- Never commit API keys, bearer tokens, credentials, or private data. TMDB credentials remain behind the Cloudflare Worker.
- Do not broaden Worker routes, CORS, CSP, or external hosts without explicit issue scope.
- Codex never deploys the production Cloudflare Worker. Worker changes stop at the separately authorised owner-deployment gate described in `docs/v2/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` and `cloudflare-worker/README.md`.
- Do not add production dependencies without explicit approval.
- Check the licence before reusing external code. Studying patterns is not permission to copy code.

## Nuvio source rules

The currently supported native TMDB source types are:

- `LIST`
- `COLLECTION`
- `COMPANY`
- `NETWORK`
- `DISCOVER`
- `PERSON`
- `DIRECTOR`

For future builder work:

- `sources` is the authoritative current source representation.
- `catalogSources` is a compatibility projection/fallback for addon-backed sources.
- Native TMDB sources do not belong in `catalogSources`.
- Addon-backed sources may have matching projections in both arrays when compatibility output requires them.
- Do not change existing v1 output merely to enforce a future canonical policy.
- Source and folder ordering is meaningful.
- Preserve imported opaque/community sources without guessing them into known types.
- Keep detailed evidence in `docs/v2/BUILDER_KNOWLEDGE.md`.

## Architecture and design

- Keep framework-independent source, validation, parsing, migration, serialization, and ID logic outside UI components.
