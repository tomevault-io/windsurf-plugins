## End of session

When the work produced code or doc changes, always:

1. Commit changes (follow existing commit message style)
2. Push to remote
3. If there's a version bump, prompt to publish to npm (see global CLAUDE.md for @yawlabs publish flow)

Don't wait for the user to ask — do this proactively when the task is done. (Read-only tasks like code reviews don't trigger this — nothing to commit.)
