# AGENTS.md

Orientation for any agent working in `www-sacred`. Read this before touching code.

## What this repo is

`www-sacred` (npm package `srcl`) is an open-source React component library with terminal aesthetics. It is consumed in two ways:

1. **A Next.js 16 / React 19 site at `sacred.computer`** that renders every component in a kitchen sink at `app/page.tsx`.
2. **Simulacrum**, a zero-dependency CLI framework under `scripts/cli/lib/` (and a snake_case Python mirror under `scripts/python/sacred_cli/`) so the same layouts can render in a terminal.

The React side and the Simulacrum side share a single source of truth for the palette: `scripts/cli/colors.json`. The CSS surface drives the same colors via `--theme-*` custom properties in `global.css`.

## Repo map

- `app/` — Next.js App Router. `app/page.tsx` is the kitchen sink. `app/api/*` are tiny demo routes. `app/llm/[...path]/route.ts`, `app/llms.txt/route.ts`, and `app/llms-full.txt/route.ts` expose every `AGENTS.md` and `SKILL.md` as plain `text/markdown` URLs under `https://sacred.computer/llm/...` so external agents can fetch the sacred contract without `git clone`.
- `components/` — Sacred React components. `components/AGENTS.md` is the canonical catalog of every component (one entry per `.tsx`, with props, theming tokens, and CLI primitive equivalent) — read this first when picking a component, before grepping. `components/examples/` contains larger demo surfaces (AS400, MessagesInterface, CLITemplate, InvoiceTemplate, ResultsList, OneLineLoaders). `components/SimpleTable.tsx` is the fluid HTML table the CLI port examples use — its column/status contract maps one-to-one onto the CLI framework's `formatRow` + `cardHeaderRow` primitives. `components/Window.tsx` is the React peer of the CLI window primitive — wrap a CLI port surface in `<Window>` to render the same dialog frame the alt-screen CLI shows.
- `common/` — Constants and utilities shared across components.
- `modules/` — Stand-alone modules (snake game, chess, etc.).
- `scripts/cli/` — Simulacrum, the sacred CLI framework (CommonJS, zero dependencies). `lib/` is the framework, `lib/__tests__/` is the vitest suite (and the `dump_reference.js` fixture generator), `templates/` is the canonical TS template, `colors.json` is the shared palette.
- `scripts/python/` — Simulacrum's Python mirror. `sacred_cli/` is the package, `sacred_cli/__tests__/` is the unittest suite (and the parity test against the JS fixture), `templates/` is the canonical Python template.
- `scripts/test_python.js` — Node orchestrator for `npm run test:python`. Probes for `python3`, regenerates the JS fixture, then invokes `python3 -m unittest discover`. Skips with a warning if `python3` is missing.
- `skills/` — Four porting skills (TS CLI, Python CLI, React-to-React, hostile React host). Read `skills/*/SKILL.md` before porting.
- `.workdir/` — Read-only reference material from sibling projects. Never edit, never ship.

## Conventions

- All new comments use `//NOTE(@YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME): ...` (or `# NOTE(@YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME): ...` in Python). Comments explain _why_, not _what_. Delete self-documenting comments on sight.
- The CLI framework is intentionally zero-dependency CommonJS so TypeScript templates can `require` it via `tsx` with no build step. Do not add ESM imports inside `scripts/cli/lib/*`.
- The Python framework mirrors the JS framework one-to-one but uses snake_case. The same `colors.json` is the single source of truth — do not duplicate the palette. The two runtimes are locked into byte-identical output by the parity suite under `scripts/python/sacred_cli/__tests__/test_parity.py`. When you change a JS module, port the change to its Python mirror in the same PR — `npm test` will fail otherwise.
- React example components in `components/examples/*` should only depend on sacred's existing primitives (`Card`, `SimpleTable`, `Button`, `RowSpaceBetween`, etc.). The CLI port examples (`CLITemplate`, `InvoiceTemplate`, `ResultsList`) use `SimpleTable`, not `DataTable`, because `SimpleTable`'s column + status contract maps one-to-one onto `formatRow` and `cardHeaderRow`. Do not import from `scripts/cli/lib/*` from React — that code is Node-only and uses `process.stdout`.
- Tests live in `scripts/cli/lib/__tests__/*.test.mjs` (vitest, JS), `components/__tests__/*.test.mjs` (vitest, sync guard for the component catalog), `app/llm/__tests__/*.test.mjs` (vitest, sync guard for the `/llm/...` URL surface), and `scripts/python/sacred_cli/__tests__/test_*.py` (unittest, Python). The vitest suite uses `createRequire` so ESM tests can pull in CJS source modules. `npm test` runs both suites; `npm run test:js` and `npm run test:python` run them individually. Run `npm test` before opening a PR.
- Sacred CLI ports are static — no animation diffing system. The React side keeps its existing animation primitives (canvas snake, canvas platformer, etc.). The one exception is `OneLineLoaders.tsx` because the spinners are the entire point of that component.

## Scripts

```sh
npm install             # install deps
npm run dev             # Next.js dev server on http://localhost:10000
npm test                # JS vitest suite + Python unittest + parity suite (chained)
