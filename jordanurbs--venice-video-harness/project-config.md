description: Preserve generated shot assets by archiving instead of deleting
---


# Shot Asset Safety

- Never delete generated shot files when making revisions to mini-drama episodes.
- For `shot-NNN.mp4`, `shot-NNN.png`, and related shot asset files, archive prior versions instead of removing them.
- Prefer versioned filenames like `-v1`, `-v2`, or pre-fix/pre-style backups over destructive replacement.
- If a workflow seems to require deletion, stop and use an archive-first approach instead.

Example:

- Instead of deleting `shot-003.mp4`, rename it to `shot-003-v1.mp4` before generating a replacement.
