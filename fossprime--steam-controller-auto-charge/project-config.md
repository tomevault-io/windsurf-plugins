# Coding Rules

- **NEVER** use CommonJS (CJS). No `require()`, no `module.exports`, no `.cjs` files.
- **ALWAYS** use modern ESM + TypeScript. `import`/`export`, `.ts`, Node 20+ features, `"type": "module"`.
- Use good TypeScript. Avoid `any`. Prefer `interface`/`type`, proper generics, avoid loose typing.
- Code like Anthony Fu and Evan You: clean, minimal, elegant, high-signal, zero bloat. Thoughtful APIs, excellent DX, performant by default. Avoid over-abstraction and enterprise patterns.
- Prefer Vite
- When generating code, default to the highest quality modern code the legends would ship. Avoid legacy stuff, when there is a fully functional modern alternative.
- **NEVER** use `!important` in css.
- Prefer using nix-shell for system dependencies over Docker, nix-instantiate or globals.
- Use nix-shell instead of nix-instantiate when possible
- If this is a NixOS machine, You have these linux programs availble out of the box /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
- **ALWAYS** run and test your code, if possible, and run all the tests, if any, and fix any issues before finishing. By the end of the task, all the tests should be passing.
- When I ask you to fix a bug, fix it and add tests to make sure it doesn't happen again
- **NEVER** make cjs files, even temporarily, instead use tsx instead

- **NEVER** modify images in ./data, or puck.png or controller.png
- Keep the module loading self contained, the user should be able to run this locally with no internet
- Keep system requirements under 16GB of RAM and 8GB of vRAM, it should run on the 2026 Steam Machine's Chromium browser
