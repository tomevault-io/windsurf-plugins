# AGENTS.md

## Project overview

Cloudflare Agents SDK — a framework for building stateful AI agents on Cloudflare Workers. This is a monorepo containing the core SDK packages, examples, guides, sites, and documentation.

## Repository structure

```
packages/          # Published npm packages (need changesets for changes)
  agents/          # Core SDK (see packages/agents/AGENTS.md)
  ai-chat/         # @cloudflare/ai-chat — higher-level AI chat agent
  hono-agents/     # Hono framework integration
  codemode/        # @cloudflare/codemode — experimental code generation

examples/          # Self-contained demo apps (see examples/AGENTS.md)
  playground/      # Main showcase app — all SDK features in one UI (uses Kumo design system)
  mcp/             # MCP server example
  mcp-client/      # MCP client example
  ...              # ~20 examples total

experimental/      # Work-in-progress experiments (not published, no stability guarantees)

site/              # Deployed websites
  agents/          # agents.cloudflare.com (Astro)
  ai-playground/   # Workers AI playground (React + Vite)

guides/            # In-depth pattern tutorials with narrative READMEs (see guides/AGENTS.md)
  anthropic-patterns/
  human-in-the-loop/

openai-sdk/        # Examples using @openai/agents SDK
  basic/ chess-app/ handoffs/ human-in-the-loop/ ...

docs/              # Markdown docs for developers.cloudflare.com (see docs/AGENTS.md)
design/            # Architecture and design decision records (see design/AGENTS.md)
scripts/           # Repo-wide tooling (typecheck, export checks, update checks)
```

## Nested AGENTS.md files

Some directories have their own AGENTS.md with deeper guidance:

| File                        | Scope                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/agents/AGENTS.md` | Core SDK internals — exports, source layout, build, testing, architecture |
| `examples/AGENTS.md`        | Example conventions — required structure, consistency rules, known issues |
| `guides/AGENTS.md`          | Guide conventions — how guides differ from examples, README expectations  |
| `docs/AGENTS.md`            | Writing user-facing docs — Diátaxis framework, upstream sync, style       |
| `design/AGENTS.md`          | Design records and RFCs — format, workflow, relationship to docs          |

## Setup

```bash
npm install        # installs all workspaces; postinstall runs patch-package + playwright
```

Node 24+ required. Uses npm workspaces with [Nx](https://nx.dev) for task orchestration, caching, and affected detection.

## Commands

Run from the repo root:

| Command                      | What it does                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run build`              | Builds all packages via Nx (cached, dependency-ordered)            |
| `npm run check`              | Full CI check: sherif + export checks + oxfmt + oxlint + typecheck |
| `npm run test`               | Runs all tests via Nx (cached)                                     |
| `npm run test:react`         | Runs Playwright-based React hook tests for agents                  |
| `npm run typecheck`          | TypeScript type checking across the repo (custom script)           |
| `npm run format`             | Oxfmt format all files                                             |
| `npm run check:exports`      | Verifies package.json exports match actual build output            |
| `npx nx affected -t build`   | Build only packages affected by current changes                    |
| `npx nx affected -t test`    | Test only packages affected by current changes                     |
| `npx nx run <project>:build` | Build a single project (and its dependencies)                      |

Run an example locally:

```bash
cd examples/playground   # or any example
npm run dev              # starts Vite dev server + Workers runtime via @cloudflare/vite-plugin
```

## Code standards

### TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled (`agents/tsconfig`)
- Target: ES2021, module: ES2022, moduleResolution: bundler
- `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` — use explicit `import type` for type-only imports
- JSX: `react-jsx`

### Linting — Oxlint

Config in `.oxlintrc.json`. Plugins: `react`, `jsx-a11y`, `typescript`, `react-hooks`. Key rules:

- `no-explicit-any: "error"` — never use `any`, use `unknown` and narrow
- `no-unused-vars: "error"` — with `varsIgnorePattern: "^_"` and `argsIgnorePattern: "^_"`
- `correctness` category set to `"error"` — catches common mistakes
- `jsx-a11y` rules enabled — accessibility violations are errors
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps: "warn"` — warns on missing hook dependencies

Oxlint does **not** handle formatting — Oxfmt does.

### Formatting — Oxfmt

- Run `npm run format` or rely on lint-staged (auto-formats on commit via husky)
- Config in `.oxfmtrc.json` (`trailingComma: "none"`, `printWidth: 80`)

### Workers conventions

- Always TypeScript, always ES modules
