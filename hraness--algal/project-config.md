# Contents

- `src/` — the contract (`contract.ts`, `graph.ts`), the scheduler (`run.ts`),
  the effect seam (`effects.ts`), the store (`store.ts`), verification
  (`verify.ts`), Vercel AI Gateway execution (`gateway.ts`) and portable
  Chat Completions execution (`openai-compatible.ts`, `chat-completions.ts`), typed external
  tools (`tools.ts`), opaque capability handles (`capabilities.ts`) and the
  bounded durable mailbox driver (`mailbox.ts`), the named durable process
  supervisor (`process.ts`), the provider-neutral
  typed-decision layer (`decisions.ts`) with the TypeSafe Jev adapter
  (`jev.ts`), cross-platform
  credential custody (`credentials.ts`), embeddings (`embeddings.ts`) and
  the derived semantic index plus recall executor (`semantic.ts`), foundry
  evaluation and search (`foundry.ts`, `search.ts`), benchmark comparison (`bench.ts`,
  `bench-verify.ts`), bundles (`bundle.ts`), transports (`transport.ts`),
  the `algal.expr.v1` WASM loader (`expr.ts` + committed `algal_expr.wasm`),
  canonical values and digests, and colocated tests.
- `crates/algal-expr/` — the one expression evaluator (Rust): linked into
  the kernel as an rlib and compiled to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` for Bun.
  `scripts/build-expr-wasm.sh` rebuilds `src/algal_expr.wasm` (needs a
  rustup toolchain with the wasm target; pins `RUSTC` past Homebrew).
- `cli.ts` — the Bun CLI (`run`, `check`, `verify`, `resume`, `inspect`,
  `explain`, `diff`, `foundry`, `bench`, `runs`, `digest`, `store`,
  `manifests`, `manifest`, `slots`, `slot`, `mailbox`, `process`, `pack`, `unpack`,
  `application` drain/verify-drain,
  `example`, `suite`, `index`, `search`, `auth`, `doctor`).
- `index.ts` — the package's public surface.
- `examples/` — bundled manifests and scripted responses used by `suite`.
- `spec/v1/organism.md`, `spec/v1/expr.md`, `spec/v1/foundry.md`,
  `spec/v1/search.md`, `spec/v1/bench.md`, `spec/v1/process.md`,
  `spec/v1/application.md` — authoritative
  contract prose, including the bounded durable process filesystem ABI.
- `site/` — the static algal.computer source; `build.ts` writes `site/dist`.
- `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` — the public contract.

# Guidelines

- Bun 1.3.x, strict TypeScript, zero required runtime dependencies. Shared
  foundations attach through the `Store` and `Executor` seams; do not add a
  package dependency for something the contract can express.
- Parse foreign values from `unknown` and reject unknown keys. Model invalid
  states out rather than checking them late.
- The manifest is data and carries no host code. `fn` cells resolve against
  the host registry; agent cells resolve against an executor the host
  supplies; `expr` cells carry bounded `algal.expr.v1` programs that the
  contract-owned evaluator (`crates/algal-expr`, one implementation for
  both runtimes) interprets under fuel — data, not executables.
- Receipts contain no wall-clock fields. `verify` must replay a run
  bit-for-bit; keep nondeterminism at the executor boundary only.
- `cap` ports carry host-admitted authority. Keep capability classes exact,
  reject widening to `json`, never let manifests mint handles with `const`,
  and make every mutable driver idempotent and replay-safe.
- Bound every count, byte size, depth, and list. New contract fields need a
  bound and a test.
- Colocate tests with source (`src/*.test.ts`); cover failure modes with a
  deterministic example, not a mock-heavy harness.
- Keep the public surfaces honest: README claims match what `bun run check`
  and the tests actually prove; mark proposals as proposals.

# ALGAL native migration

- The product is ALGAL; all wire identifiers are `algal.*.v1` and manifest
  fixtures use `*.algal.json`. There is no compatibility surface for older
  naming.
- `crates/algal/` is the Rust kernel, native CLI, memory/context primitives,
  and ACP boundary. Keep the TypeScript runtime independently runnable as the
  reference implementation. No implicit native-to-Bun fallback.
- Native checks: `cargo test --workspace --locked`,
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, and
  `cargo fmt --all -- --check`. Use `cargo build --locked` followed by
  `bun scripts/native-parity.ts` to compare every bundled example and verify
  receipts in both directions between TypeScript and Rust, and
  `bun scripts/application-parity.ts` to replay the durable application
  lifecycle (create/commit including activate, propose, select, and migrate
  transitions, dispatch/reconcile, memory scope/observe/snapshot/query, the
  bounded `algal.application-experiment.v1` promotion-evidence join, the
  deterministic `application lineage` projection, the structured-facts-only
  ablation fixture, and the `algal.application-host.v1` policy host) through
  both runtimes with
  identical digests, and `bun scripts/process-parity.ts` for the durable
  process lifecycle (create/inspect/list/tick/verify/schedule, the mailbox
  suspension/wake chain with shared capability records, uncertain-intent
  recovery through `recover`/`journal`, journaled dispatch,
  `export`/`verify-evidence` portable bundles, agent-cell suspension and
  resumption through the shared EX_TEMPFAIL command-executor contract, and
