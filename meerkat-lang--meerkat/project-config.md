## Agentic Workflows

After modifying any `.md` workflow file under `.github/workflows/`, always
recompile and commit the generated workflow files with the source change:

```bash
gh aw compile
apm compile
```

For Goal issues, keep the completion contract evidence-based. A goal is complete
only when the issue's stated verification evidence supports it.
