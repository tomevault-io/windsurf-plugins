# AI Agent Instructions

## Project: LeanSpec

Lightweight spec methodology for AI-powered development.

## Skills

This project uses the Agent Skills framework for domain-specific guidance. **Read the appropriate skill when working on related tasks.**

### Core Skills

1. **leanspec** - Spec-Driven Development methodology

   - Use when: Working with specs, planning features, multi-step changes
   - Key: Run `board` or `search` before creating specs

## Project-Specific Rules

1. **Use pnpm** - Never npm or yarn. All package management uses pnpm.
2. **DRY Principle** - Extract shared logic; avoid duplication.
3. **Skills First** - Read the relevant skill file before starting work on development, specs, or publishing tasks.
4. **Context Economy** - Keep specs under 2000 tokens. Split large tasks.
5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Use skills and references for detailed guidance.
