## 定位

把经过历史验证的思维方法做成按场景组织的决策辅助 skill 家族，本仓库是第一个。核心命题：**决策权在人——AI 铺开选项和证据，帮人
快速拍板**（人拍板、agent 跑腿）。主战场是**基于调研的决策**（evidence-based）：选型、
文献综述、尽调、竞品分析——决策必须站在可溯源的证据上；直觉型、政治型、纯偏好型决策
不在射程内。与把思维模型当 AI 推理透镜的同类项目不同，我们交付有状态的决策协议，产出
是人的选择加理由——版本化、留痕可溯，以决策速度和可追溯性衡量，而非 AI 准确率。

仓库以分发为先：README 钩子和活例子（`examples/autoharness/`）为传播性优化。生成的
HTML 是用完即弃的投影——只构建到临时目录或 artifact，永不入库。

## Key docs (read before changing the relevant area)

- **[docs/](docs/index.md)** — documentation map; single entry point for the whole `docs/` tree.
- **[docs/design-harness/output/](docs/design-harness/output/index.md)** — the assembled output (currently: the system design — architecture and the *why*). Start at the spine,
  then the step you're touching. *(Create these as the design solidifies; keep the index current.)*
- **[docs/design-harness/](docs/design-harness/index.md)** — the literature→design workspace: every
  cited source, its synthesis into directions, distilled ideas, design assembly, and decisions, in
  five provenance-linked layers (`sources/` `synthesis/` `ideas/` `design/` `decisions/`). The
  operating procedure is carried by the global **`design-harness` skill** — invoke it whenever you
  add a source, compare a direction, or push literature toward design.
- **[docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md)** — tracked follow-ups not yet on the roadmap.
  **Keep this current in real time** (see rule below).
- **[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md)** — test conventions and the per-file test map.
- **[docs/plans/](docs/plans/)** — per-change implementation plans (working artifacts, exempt from the design-doc style rules).

## Task lifecycle — the fixed order for every non-trivial change

Plan → sync → docs → tests → code → verify → commit → docs/index sweep → green CI.
Trivial one-line changes skip the plan; nothing skips the order. A change that arrives
out of order is *incomplete*.

1. **Plan.** Non-trivial changes start with a plan in `docs/plans/` (working artifacts,
   exempt from the design-doc style rules). The plan's first unit updates the relevant
   workspace `output/` doc; every unit places tests before code.
2. **Branch, isolate, sync.** Bind each change to exactly one explicit task on its own branch,
   developed in its own worktree — **created with Claude Code's own worktree tooling** (the
   `/ce-worktree` skill or the built-in worktree feature), which places it under
   `.claude/worktrees/<branch>` (`.claude/` is git-ignored); never hand-create one with raw
   `git worktree add`, and never develop on the default/trunk branch (`main`/`master`/`trunk`,
   or whatever the repo's current default branch is). Before developing, `git fetch` and rebase
   that branch onto the latest `main` so you build on the current baseline, never a stale one.
   Land the work via feature branch + PR; no direct pushes to `main`.
3. **Docs first.** Read, then update, the relevant workspace `output/` doc(s) before any test or
   code — pin down behavior boundaries, interface contracts, and acceptance criteria. Never
   touch code first.
4. **Tests next (TDD).** Write the failing unit test(s) first, then the system test(s), then
   the implementation. Put each in the matching `tests/test_<module>.py`, use fixtures rather
   than live external services, and assert **relationships/invariants** (sums reconcile,
   A > B, value `> 0`) — never hardcoded values that break when an upstream dependency
   changes. A feature shipped without a test is *incomplete*.
5. **Code.** Write the code that makes the tests pass.
6. **Verify end-to-end.** Run the app on a local server and confirm the behavior end-to-end
   against a running instance — not just via unit tests.
7. **Commit.** Run the relevant unit *and* system tests before each commit; commit at every
   green-test point (the natural TDD commit moments) and `git push` after every completed task
   and at every phase gate — progress must never exist only on this machine.
8. **Sweep docs & indexes.** Confirm whether the change needs updates to the design docs and
   the doc/file-tree indexes (`docs/design-harness/output/index.md`) — update them in the same change.
9. **Drive CI green.** After opening the PR, watch CI and code-quality checks (CI runs, lint,
   static analysis, doc-automation checks). On any failure, locate, fix, and push immediately
   — repeat until every required check passes.

## Working rules

- **Docs are top-level design only.** Describe *what* a piece does and *why* — never how. No
  pseudocode, no code snippets, no concrete data, values, or magic numbers. Name **modules and
  objects** — never functions, constants, ratios, or file paths; that detail lives in the code.
  Two carve-outs: **architecture diagrams** are legitimate top-level design and stay; and the
  **setup runbooks** (install, quickstart, ops) keep the literal commands a user runs, since
  the command *is* the deliverable there — but their prose still obeys the no-implementation
  rule.
- **Design docs are ruthlessly concise — every sentence earns its place.** No filler, no
  hedging, no motivational preamble, no restating what the code, a diagram, or another doc
  already says. One fact lives in exactly one place; cross-link instead of repeating. If a
