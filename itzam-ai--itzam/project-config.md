# Project
- You are working on Itzam, a product that makes AI workflows easier to implement. [ITZAM.md](mdc:notes/ITZAM.md) has all the details about it.

# Exports
- Declare export inline

# Nextjs
- We should use the app router when developing new features, and keeping the implementation for refactoring old ones
- Add "import 'server-only'" to ensure a file is only called on the server-side
- Maximize server components usage
- Don't forget to add loading.tsx (use the components inside /components/loading) and error.tsx for routes
- Add <Suspense> for async components loading states
- Use React's server functions for data fetching and server actions for forms

# Database
- Our database schema is declared in [schema.ts](mdc:packages/server/src/db/schema.ts)
- We're using Drizzle with the postgres adapter and deploying to supabase

# SDK
- If an endpoint is under the /api/v1 route, we should always document it using the open api spec

# Auth
- We're using Supabase Auth as our Auth provider

# Payments
- We use Stripe to handle payments

# Components
- We use Shadcn UI as our component library. Always check if there's a built component before creating a new one

# React
- Always use the `cache` function in server actions if appropriate

# Misc
- Use "~" for absolute paths
- Use date-fns for handling dates
- Use the [try-catch.ts](mdc:apps/web/src/lib/try-catch.ts) tryCatch function for async functions, dont use throw
