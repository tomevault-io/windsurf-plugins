# Task Environment

This environment contains a prebuilt **SkillDAG** typed-skill graph workspace.

## Required First Step

Before writing any code, retrieve relevant skills in two steps:

```bash
skilldag graph search "goal + artifact/format + operation/API + verifier-critical constraint" --top-k 5
skilldag show <skill_id>
```

`skilldag graph search` returns a ranked list of skill ids with scores and one-line descriptions. `skilldag show <id>` prints the full SKILL.md body. Pass multiple ids — `skilldag show A B C` — to read several skills in one call. Both commands are on PATH inside the container.

When writing the query, include only the retrieval-critical task facts that are actually known:

- concrete goal
- artifact, file format, or main object
- key operation, algorithm, API, or library
- verifier-critical constraint or invariant

Examples:

```text
update embedded xlsx in pptx preserve formulas
parallel tfidf search processpoolexecutor deterministic ranking
exact civ6 district adjacency calculator
```

Avoid vague queries such as `solve this task` or `help with benchmark`.

Retrieval is free and interruptible. Use `skilldag show <id>` for each skill that looks relevant, and consult more skills later if the task surface changes. If the ranking is empty, explicitly note that no relevant skill was found and continue without claiming skill usage. Otherwise, use the retrieved skills only as constraints on how to solve the task.

## Failure Reflection

SkillDAG failure-reflection protocol:

1. When an action or command fails, infer the missing precondition or wrong assumption before doing anything else.
2. Ask whether the failure is reusable across tasks:
   - Reusable structural error between two skills → mutate the graph.
   - One-off world-state confusion or local mistake → do not mutate; inspect state or try a different action/command.
3. Repeating the same failed action or near-identical search query is not progress.
4. Retrieval is free and interruptible: `skilldag show` / `search` / `get-*` calls do NOT consume your env-action budget, so you may consult skills at any point during the task — including mid-execution after an unexpected observation.
5. Mutation reasons must cite concrete evidence from THIS task in ≤30 words.

## When to Mutate

- `depends_on`: skill A keeps failing until skill B's setup/output should happen first.
- `composes_with`: A and B should be chained, but the current graph does not expose that composition.
- `conflicts_with`: two skills suggest incompatible or redundant procedures and jointly mislead execution.
- `edit-edge remove` / `edit-edge retype`: an existing relation is clearly contradicted by repeated failure evidence. Prefer `retype` over adding a second contradictory edge on the same pair.

CRITICAL — `depends_on` direction:

- `edit-edge add A B depends_on` = A requires B first. Source = A (dependent / failing skill); Target = B (prerequisite).
- Chronology may be B → A, but edge is A → B.
- If evidence says "A failed because B was missing", write `add A B depends_on`.
- Pre-commit check: read "A requires B first"; if backward, swap A/B.

## Online Graph Edit

Mutation is a two-step flow — propose (dry-run) first, commit second.

**Step 1 — propose.** Returns `{would, related}`; never mutates. `related` lists every existing edge and recent history entry whose endpoints match the target pair (ignoring direction), each with its reason so you can read prior evidence before acting. `--reason` is required as a forcing function: state the evidence in ≤30 words BEFORE you see `related`. The same string can be reused at commit.

```bash
skilldag graph propose-edge    <src> <tgt> <type>                --reason "<evidence>"
skilldag graph propose-remove  <src> <tgt> <type>                --reason "<evidence>"
skilldag graph propose-retype  <src> <tgt> --from <t1> --to <t2> --reason "<evidence>"
```

**Step 2 — commit.** Only path that writes. `--reason` is required.

```bash
skilldag graph edit-edge add    <src> <tgt> <type>                   --reason "<evidence>"
skilldag graph edit-edge remove <src> <tgt> <type>                   --reason "<evidence>"
skilldag graph edit-edge retype <src> <tgt> --from <t1> --to <t2>    --reason "<evidence>"
```

Edge types: `depends_on | composes_with | similar_to | conflicts_with | specializes`.

Rules:

- Propose whenever you have thought about it and the relation looks reasonable. `propose-*` is a pure dry-run — it never writes, so the bar is your own judgement, not a quota of failures.
- `--reason` is required on propose. State the evidence (≤30 words) BEFORE you see `related`; this forces you to articulate the case rather than rationalize after the fact.
- After propose, read the `related` list. If a prior edge or history entry on the same pair exists, its reason tells you whether your new evidence is consistent, contradictory, or redundant.
- If your new evidence contradicts a prior edge's reason, use `edit-edge retype` (or `edit-edge remove` first) — do NOT stack an opposing edge type on the same pair.
- Do not keep issuing near-duplicate retrieval queries without explaining why the previous retrieval was insufficient.
- Keep the reason short and grounded in observed evidence from this task.
