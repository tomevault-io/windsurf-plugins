# Memory Hub maintenance

Preserve user runtime bindings and full_memory_mode preferences.
Keep one local database and reuse existing source connectors.
Run scripts/run_tests.py for isolated offline tests; never test against personal chat stores.
Do not commit databases, exports, credentials, logs, or build artifacts.
