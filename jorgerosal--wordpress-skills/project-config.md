# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a parallel WordPress skill pack for Claude Code and Codex covering fourteen domains:

- Performance reviews
- Security reviews
- Plugin architecture reviews
- Block development reviews
- Theme development reviews
- WooCommerce development reviews
- REST API reviews
- Admin UI reviews
- Migration and upgrade reviews
- Accessibility reviews
- Test strategy reviews
- WP-CLI and operations reviews
- Playground reviews
- PHPStan reviews

The Claude and Codex wrappers are designed for WordPress 6.x+ codebases and provide structured review workflows, shared reference docs, quick triage commands for Claude, and cross-skill handoffs when a finding belongs in another specialty.

## Adding New Skills

1. Create directory: `claude-skills/wp-your-skill/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: Trigger phrases and when to use. Max 1024 chars.
   ---
   ```
3. Add references in `claude-skills/wp-your-skill/references/` if needed
4. Create a parallel Codex wrapper in `codex-skills/wp-your-skill/` when the domain should also be available in Codex
5. Add slash commands in `commands/` if the Claude skill needs explicit invocation
6. Update `README.md` skill and command tables
7. Update `CHANGELOG.md`

## Adding Slash Commands

Create a markdown file in `commands/` with:
```yaml
---
description: What the command does
argument-hint: [optional-args]
---
```

## Code Standards
