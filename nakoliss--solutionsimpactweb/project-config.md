# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a bilingual (French/English) digital marketing agency website for Quebec businesses, built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript. The project focuses on landing page creation, SEO services, and AI-powered marketing solutions.

### Business Carousel Feature
The homepage features an interactive carousel showcasing 10 distinct website designs for different business types:
- AI Marketing Agency (original design)
- Medical Clinic with appointment booking
- Antique Shop with catalog browsing  
- Auto Garage with service booking
- Retail Store with product showcase
- Restaurant with menu and reservations
- Law Firm with consultation forms
- Beauty Salon with service packages
- Pet Grooming with care packages
- Home Services with maintenance offerings

## Architecture

### Core Structure
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Languages**: TypeScript with strict configuration (noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters, exactOptionalPropertyTypes)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS
- **Internationalization**: next-intl for i18n routing and content
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for UI animations
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for production monitoring

### Key Directories
- `web/` - Main Next.js application (all npm commands run from here)
- `web/app/[locale]/` - Internationalized route structure
- `web/messages/` - Translation files (fr.json, en.json)
- `web/components/` - React components including BusinessCarousel, ErrorBoundary, compliance tools
- `web/content/` - MDX content files for guides and documentation
- `web/lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
- `Documents/` - Business documentation (BusinessPlanV0.5.md, roadmap)
- `Plans/` - Project improvement plans

### Internationalization Setup
- **Default locale**: French (`fr`)
- **Supported locales**: `['fr', 'en']`
- **Routing**: Always prefixed (`/fr/`, `/en/`)
- **Middleware**: Automatic locale detection and routing
- **Configuration**: `i18n.ts` and `i18n/request.ts` handle locale resolution

## Development Commands

All commands must be run from the `web/` directory:

```bash
cd web

# Development
npm run dev                    # Start dev server with Turbopack
npm run build                  # Production build
npm run start                  # Start production server

# Testing
npm run test                   # Run Vitest tests
npm run test:ui                # Vitest UI
npm run test:run               # Run tests once
npm run test:a11y              # Run Playwright accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y:headed       # Run accessibility tests with browser

# Linting & Validation
npm run lint                   # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix               # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run i18n:lint              # Validate translation files
npm run content:validate       # Validate content structure

npm run analyze:server         # Server bundle analysis
npm run analyze:browser        # Browser bundle analysis
```

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest with React Testing Library (`__tests__/` directory)

- Configuration in `package.json` lint-staged section

### TypeScript Configuration
