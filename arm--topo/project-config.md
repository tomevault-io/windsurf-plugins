## Coding Conventions

### Core Philosophy

Strive for code that is simple, performant, and robust. When in doubt, err on the side of clarity and directness over premature or overly complex abstractions.

- Prioritize clarity and maintainability over premature optimization
- Suggest consistent patterns within the existing codebase
- Delete unused code aggressively
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Keep cyclomatic complexity low
- Consider algorithmic complexity for data processing
- Cache expensive operations when appropriate

### Testing Philosophy

- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert structure for test organization
- Test should describe behaviour, not implementation
- Include tests for boundaries and edge cases, not just the happy path
- Prefer many, small tests which focus on asserting a single behaviour. Avoid large tests which arrange large amounts of state to test many things at once.
- Make test names descriptive of the scenario being tested

### Control Flow

- **Simple and explicit control flow**: Favor straightforward control structures over complex logic. Simple control flow makes code easier to understand and reduces the risk of bugs. Avoid recursion if possible to keep execution bounded and predictable, preventing stack overflows and uncontrolled resource use.

- **Use early returns**: Use early returns to reduce nesting and improve readability.

- **Prefer pure functions**: Prefer suggesting pure functions over stateful operations when possible.

- **Limit function length**: Keep functions concise, ideally under 70 lines. Shorter functions are easier to understand, test, and debug. They promote single responsibility, where each function does one thing well, leading to a more modular and maintainable codebase.

- **Prefer stateful operations higher up the stack**: Adopt a Function Core, Imperative Shell approach. Let the parent function manage state, keeping helpers stateless, calculating changes without directly applying them.  Keep leaf functions pure and focused on specific computations. This results in a core which is easy to extensively unit test, and makes stateful operations easier to trace and debug in the outer layers of the program

### Error Handling

- **Use assertions**: Use assertions to verify that conditions hold true at specific points in the code. Assertions work as internal checks, increase robustness, and simplify debugging.
  - Assert function arguments and return values: Check that functions receive and return expected values.
  - Validate invariants: Keep critical conditions stable by asserting invariants during execution.
  - Use pair assertions: Check critical data at multiple points to catch inconsistencies early.

- **Fail fast on programmer errors**: Detect unexpected conditions immediately, stopping faulty code from continuing.

- **Handle all errors**: Check and handle every error. Ignoring errors can lead to undefined behavior, security issues, or crashes. Write thorough tests for error-handling code to make sure your application works correctly in all cases.

### Naming

Get the nouns and verbs right. Great names capture what something is or does and create a clear, intuitive model. They show you understand the domain. Take time to find good names, where nouns and verbs fit together, making the whole greater than the sum of its parts.

- **Generate descriptive and self-documenting names**: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and files. Good naming improves code readability and helps others understand each component's purpose. Stick to a consistent style, like snake_case, throughout the codebase.

- **Avoid abbreviations**: Use full words in names unless the abbreviation is widely accepted and clear (e.g., ID, URL). Abbreviations can be confusing and make it harder for others, especially new contributors, to understand the code.

- **Include units or qualifiers in names**: Append units or qualifiers to variable names, placing them in descending order of significance (e.g., latency_ms_max instead of max_latency_ms). This clears up meaning, avoids confusion, and ensures related variables, like latency_ms_min, line up logically and group together.

- **Document the 'why', not the 'what'**: Use comments to explain why decisions were made, not just what the code does. Knowing the intent helps others maintain and extend the code properly. Give context for complex algorithms, unusual approaches, or key constraints. Do not comment on what the code is doing if it's already clear.

### Organization

Organizing code well makes it easy to navigate, maintain, and extend. A logical structure reduces cognitive load, letting developers focus on solving problems instead of figuring out the code. Group related elements, and simplify interfaces to keep the codebase clean, scalable, and manageable as complexity grows.

- **Organize code logically**: Structure your code logically. Group related functions and classes together. Order code naturally, placing high-level abstractions before low-level details. Logical organization makes code easier to navigate and understand.
