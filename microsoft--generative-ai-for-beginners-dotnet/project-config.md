# S - Save screenshot
```

#### Aspire MCP Sample
```bash
cd samples/PracticalSamples/src
dotnet run --project McpSample.AppHost/McpSample.AppHost.csproj
```

### Hot Reload and Watch Mode

```bash
# Run with hot reload (for web projects)
dotnet watch run

# Build in watch mode
dotnet watch build
```

## Testing Instructions

### Build Validation

The repository uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD validation. Before submitting changes:

```bash
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore <solution-path>

# Build in Release mode (as CI does)
dotnet build <solution-path> --no-restore --configuration Release --verbosity minimal

# Example: Validate core samples
dotnet restore samples/CoreSamples/CoreGenerativeAITechniques.sln
dotnet build samples/CoreSamples/CoreGenerativeAITechniques.sln --no-restore --configuration Release
```

### Validated Solutions

The following solutions are validated in CI:
- `samples/CoreSamples/CoreGenerativeAITechniques.sln`
- `samples/PracticalSamples/Aspire.MCP.Sample.sln`
- `samples/AppsWithGenAI/HFMCP.GenImage/HFMCP.GenImage.sln`
- `samples/AppsWithGenAI/SpaceAINet/SpaceAINet.sln`
- `samples/MAF/MAF-Demos.slnx`

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test a specific project
cd <project-directory>
dotnet run

# Verify AI integration works with your provider
# Follow the lesson-specific README instructions for testing AI features
```

### Note on Test Coverage

This repository is primarily educational with sample applications. There are currently no automated unit or integration tests. Validation is done through:
- Build verification in CI
- Manual testing of sample applications
- Documentation review

## Code Style and Conventions

### Formatting

```bash
# Format code before committing (REQUIRED)
dotnet format

# Verify formatting without making changes
dotnet format --verify-no-changes

# Format a specific solution
dotnet format <path-to-solution>.sln
```

### C# Conventions

- Use modern .NET features (top-level statements, nullable reference types, file-scoped namespaces)
- Follow standard C# naming conventions (PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for locals)
- Use async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Prefer dependency injection over static instances
- Use `IChatClient` abstraction (Microsoft.Extensions.AI) for AI model integration

### AI Integration Patterns

- **Never hardcode API keys** - use user secrets or environment variables
- **Abstract AI providers** behind service classes for easy swapping
- **Use IChatClient** from Microsoft.Extensions.AI for provider-agnostic code
- **Microsoft Agent Framework** for advanced agent orchestration and multi-agent workflows
- Support multiple providers (Azure OpenAI, Ollama) where applicable

### File Organization

- Place sample code in the `samples/` directory under the appropriate category
- Store images in `<lesson-number>/images/` or root `images/` folder
- Keep README files in lesson root directories
- Use descriptive file names with English characters, numbers, and dashes

### Documentation Standards

- All URLs must be wrapped in `[text](url)` format
- Relative links start with `./` (current dir) or `../` (parent dir)
- Add tracking IDs to Microsoft/GitHub URLs: `?wt.mc_id=` or `&wt.mc_id=`
- No country-specific locales in URLs (avoid `/en-us/`)
- Update relevant lesson README.md files when modifying code

## Build and Deployment

### Build Commands

```bash
# Standard build
dotnet build

# Release build (as used in CI)
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Build specific solution
dotnet build <path-to-solution>.sln
```

### .NET Workloads

The dev container automatically installs required workloads. For local development:

```bash
# Update workloads
dotnet workload update

# List installed workloads
dotnet workload list

# Trust development certificates
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

### Deployment Notes

- Sample projects are designed for local execution and learning
- For production deployment, follow Azure deployment best practices
- Aspire projects can be deployed to Azure Container Apps
- Refer to individual project READMEs for specific deployment instructions

## Additional Notes

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Errors
- **Missing SDK**: Ensure .NET 10 SDK is installed (`dotnet --version`)
- **Workload issues**: Run `dotnet workload update`
- **Package restore fails**: Delete `bin/` and `obj/` folders, then `dotnet restore`

#### AI Provider Issues
- **Azure OpenAI**: Check user secrets are configured: `dotnet user-secrets list`
- **Ollama**: Ensure service is running and model is pulled: `ollama list`

#### Codespace-Specific
- **Port forwarding**: Ensure port 17057 is forwarded for web applications
- **Memory limits**: Codespace requires 16GB RAM for optimal performance
- **Ollama in Codespaces**: Use the Ollama dev container configuration

### Security Considerations

- **Never commit secrets** to source control
- **Use user secrets** for local development: `dotnet user-secrets set`
- **Environment variables** for production/Codespaces
- **Review .gitignore** before committing to exclude sensitive files

### Performance Tips

- **Local models (Ollama)**: Require significant CPU/GPU resources
- **Cloud models**: Faster but require network connectivity
- **Batch operations**: Use streaming responses for better UX
- **Caching**: Consider caching AI responses for repeated queries

### Multi-Language Support

Translations are maintained in `translations/<language-code>/`:
- Only contribute translations in languages where you are proficient
- Do not use machine translation
- Submit complete translations (all files) in a single PR
- Update the translation table in README.md with the date
