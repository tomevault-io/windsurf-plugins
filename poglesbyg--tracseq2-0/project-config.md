description: LLM integration patterns and RAG implementations for laboratory document processing and information extraction
---



# llm-integration

The LLM integration implements several domain-specific patterns for laboratory document processing:

## Document Processing Pipeline
- Custom extraction prompts tailored to laboratory submissions
- Multi-stage validation with confidence scoring
- Extraction of 7 core categories:
  - Administrative information 
  - Source material details
  - Pooling data
  - Sequence generation parameters
  - Container specifications
  - Informatics requirements
  - Sample metadata

## RAG Implementation
- Vector store optimization for laboratory documents using ChromaDB
- Specialized chunking strategy preserving section context
- Local LLM inference via Ollama with OpenAI fallback
- Domain-specific prompt templates for accurate extraction

## Context Management
- Conversation history tracking with laboratory domain context
- Response generation incorporating system knowledge
- Enhanced answer synthesis using relevant document chunks

## Query Processing
- Natural language understanding for laboratory-specific queries
- Context-aware response generation
- Integration with sample and submission databases

## Resilience Mechanisms 
- Circuit breaker pattern for LLM API calls
- Exponential backoff retry policy
- Fallback to mock responses for testing

## Key Components
- `lab_submission_rag/rag/document_processor.py`
- `lab_submission_rag/rag/llm_interface.py` 
- `lab_submission_rag/rag/vector_store.py`
- `lab_submission_rag/core/services.py`
