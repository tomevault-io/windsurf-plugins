# Panel, Views, and Columns Relationship

## Overview
Panels and views have different relationships with their columns. Understanding this distinction is critical when working with the UI and data management logic.

## Panel-Column Relationship

### Master Column Definition
- **Panels define a master list of columns** that serves as the authoritative source
- This master list contains ALL columns that can be displayed in:
  - The panel itself
  - Any view derived from that panel

### Panel Column Visibility
- Panels can hide columns using the `display.visible` property
- **Important**: Setting `display.visible = false` only affects visibility in the panel itself
- Hidden columns in a panel can still be visible in derived views

### Panel Column Filters
- Panels can configure filters at the column level
- **Critical**: Panel-level filters are ALWAYS applied when data is loaded, regardless of column visibility
- These filters apply to:
  - The panel itself (even if the column is hidden)
  - All derived views (even if the column is not included in the view)

## View-Column Relationship

### Column Selection
- Views specify which columns to display by **referencing column IDs** from the panel's master list
- Views do not define their own columns - they select from the panel's available columns

### View Column States
- **No "hidden" state exists for view columns**
- Columns are either:
  - **Included**: Referenced by ID and displayed in the view
  - **Not included**: Not referenced and not displayed in the view

### View Column Filters
- Views can define **additional filters** per column
- These filters are applied **on top of** panel-level filters (additive)
- **Automatic cleanup**: When a column is removed from a view, any filters defined on that column in the view are automatically removed

## Key Differences Summary

| Aspect | Panel | View |
|--------|-------|------|
| Column Definition | Defines master list | References panel columns by ID |
| Visibility Control | `display.visible` property | Include/exclude by ID reference |
| Hidden State | Can hide columns while keeping them available | No hidden state - include or exclude only |
| Filter Scope | Always applied (global to panel + views) | Additional filters on top of panel filters |
| Filter Persistence | Persists regardless of visibility | Automatically removed when column excluded |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't confuse panel visibility with view inclusion**
   - Panel: `display.visible = false` hides but keeps column available
   - View: Column must be explicitly included by ID reference

2. **Don't assume hidden panel columns are filtered out**
   - Panel filters apply even for hidden columns
   - Data loading logic must respect panel filters regardless of visibility

3. **Don't try to "hide" columns in views**
   - Views don't have a hide mechanism
   - Remove the column ID reference instead

4. **Don't forget filter inheritance**
   - View filters are additional, not replacement
   - Panel filters + view filters are both applied

## Implementation Notes

- When implementing column visibility logic, check whether you're working with a panel or view context
- For data loading, always apply panel-level filters first, then view-level filters
- When modifying view columns, ensure proper cleanup of associated view-level filters
- UI components should handle the different visibility models appropriately
