# Bot Development Best Practices

## Documentation Requirements

Every bot file must include a comprehensive header that provides:

### Bot Name Format
Use the format: `[Project][Source System] Main goal`
- **Project**: Name of the Medplum project where the bot is deployed (use template placeholder if deployed across all projects)
- **Source System**: The system that triggers or provides data for the bot
  - For Medplum subscription events: Source system is implied and can be omitted
  - Format becomes: `[Project] Main goal`
- **Main goal**: Clear description of the bot's primary function

### Required Documentation
- **Triggering Event**: The specific event or type of event that triggers bot execution
  - For Medplum subscription events: Use format `<Resource> subscription` (e.g., "Task subscription")
  - For external events: Specify the exact event type and source
- **FHIR Resources**: **EXHAUSTIVE** list of FHIR resources created or updated by the bot
  - This is critical information for understanding bot impact and dependencies
  - Include all resource types, even if modifications are minor
  - For each resource, specify: operation type (Created/Updated/Deleted) and data scope (what fields are modified)
  - **Use functional language**: Describe changes in business terms, not technical conditions
- **Process Overview**: High-level description of the workflow executed by the bot

#### FHIR Resource Discovery Process
To ensure completeness, systematically analyze:
- **All resource operations**: Search for `createResource`, `updateResource`, `deleteResource`, `patchResource`
- **Helper functions**: Check all functions called by the main handler
- **Conditional logic**: Review all if/else branches for resource operations
- **Error handling**: Include resource operations in error and cleanup code paths

## Race Condition Prevention

To minimize race conditions, bots must follow this strict execution pattern:

1. **Fetch Phase**: Retrieve all additional data needed for processing
2. **Transform Phase**: Process input data and additional data transformations
3. **Update Phase**: Execute all FHIR store updates

**Critical Rule**: Group all FHIR resource updates at the end of the main handler function.

## Safe FHIR Resource Updates

Choose one of these approaches for safe resource updates:

### Option 1: Patch Operations (Preferred)
Use patch operations to make targeted changes to specific fields in FHIR resources.

### Option 2: Update Operations
When using update operations:
1. Fetch a fresh copy of the resource immediately before updating
2. Replace only the changed properties
3. Preserve all other existing data

## Utility Functions

### Reference File
The `@utility_functions.ts` file contains pure functions for common bot operations (e.g., nested merge of extensions).

### Usage Requirements
- **Medplum Imports Allowed**: Imports from the Medplum namespace (e.g., `@medplum/core`, `@medplum/fhirtypes`) are supported
- **Custom Utility Functions**: Copy utility functions from `@utility_functions.ts` directly into your bot file (cannot be imported). When copying such a function make sure to include a reference to the utility file in the tsdoc.
- **Version Verification**: Always verify that copied utility functions match the latest version in the reference file before deployment

### Best Practice
Regularly check for updates to utility functions and update your bot implementations accordingly.

## Logging Requirements

Effective logging is critical for troubleshooting bot issues. Since logs are displayed in space-constrained tables, focus on essential information only.

### Required Log Points

1. **Process Start**: Log key input data needed to understand what the bot will process
   - Include resource ID and relevant identifying information
   - Example: `"Starting enrichment process for task ${task.id} with status '${task.status}'"`

2. **Process Outcome**: Log the result with relevant metrics or error details
   - **Success**: Include quantitative results and what was modified
   - **Error**: Include resource ID and concise error message
   - Examples:
     - Success: `"Enrichment completed: processed 5 data points, added 3 connector inputs, updated patient"`
     - Error: `"Enrichment failed for task ${task.id}: ${errorMessage}"`

### Logging Guidelines
- Keep messages concise but informative
- Always include the primary resource ID for correlation
- Use quantitative metrics when possible (counts, types of changes)
- Avoid verbose descriptions - focus on actionable information
