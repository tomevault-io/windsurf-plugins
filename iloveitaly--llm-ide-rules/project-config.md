## Python App


- `app/lib/` is for code that is not specified to this application and with some effort could extracted into a external package.
- `app/helpers` is for larger reusable modules that if they weren't specific to this application, could be extracted into their own package.
- `app/utils` are small helper functions that are specific to a particular page or area of the application.
- `app/__init__.py` is the entrypoint for the application which is run when _anything_ is executed (fastapi, celery, etc).
  - It primarily runs `configure_*` commands for any `app.configuration.*` modules. These modules primary setup API clients, database connections, python language configuration, etc.
  - Also makes sure anything that mutates global state loads early.
- FastAPI server and routes are specified in `app/routes/`
- SQLModels are specified in `app/models/`
- Files within `app/commands/` should have:
  - Are not designed for CLI execution, but instead are interactor-style internal commands.
  - Should not be used on the queuing system
  - A `perform` function that is the main entry point for the command.
  - Look at existing commands for examples of how to structure the command.
  - Use `TypeID` for any parameters that are IDs of models.
- Files within `app/jobs/` should have:
  - Are designed for use on the queuing system.
  - A `perform` function that is the main entry point for the job.
  - Look at existing jobs for examples of how to structure the job.
  - Use `TypeID | str` for any parameters that are IDs of models.
- When referencing a command, use the full-qualified name, e.g. `app.commands.transcript_deletion.perform`.
- When queuing a job or `perform`ing it in a test, use the full-qualified name, e.g. `app.jobs.transcript_deletion.perform`.
- `app/cli/` is for scripts or CLI tools that are specific to the application.

### Factories

globs: app/factories/**/.py

* Each model should get it's own file under app/factories/model_name.py
* `ActiveModelFactory` (which is a polyfactory subclass) should be used.
* Use `BaseFactory.__faker__` to generate more specific fake data for important fields (used in routes, etc)
* Prefer `slug = BaseFactory.__faker__.unique.slug` to `slug = Use(lambda: BaseFactory.__faker__.unique.slug())`

#### Factory Example

```python
class ScreeningFactory(ActiveModelFactory[Screening]):
    funding_goal = lambda: BaseFactory.__faker__.random_int(
        min=0, max=2000_00
    )

    ticket_price = DEFAULT_TICKET_PRICE
    status = ScreeningStatus.active

    # always None
    funding_ending_at = None

    # pick entry from a fixed list
    zip_code = lambda: BaseFactory.__faker__.random_element(elements=REAL_ZIP_CODES)

    host_name = BaseFactory.__faker__.name
    host_description = lambda: BaseFactory.__faker__.paragraph(nb_sentences=2)

    # this method runs before the model is persisted to the database
    @classmethod
    def post_build(cls, model):
      # if the user does not pass in a important relationship during creation, you can generate a factory fallback
        if not model.distribution_id:
            model.distribution_id = DistributionFactory.save().id

        return model.save()

    # runs after the model is persisted to the database
    @classmethod
    def post_save(cls, model):
        return model.save()
```

### Database & ORM

When accessing database records:

* SQLModel (wrapping SQLAlchemy) is used
* `Model.one(primary_key)` or `Model.get(primary_key)` should be used to retrieve a single record
* Do not manage database sessions, these are managed by a custom tool
  * Use `TheModel(...).save()` to persist a record
  * Use `TheModel.where(...).order_by(...)` to query records. `.where()` returns a SQLAlchemy select object that you can further customize the query.
  * To iterate over the records, you'll need to end your query chain with `.all()` which returns an interator: `TheModel.where(...)...all()`
* Instead of repulling a record `order = HostScreeningOrder.one(order.id)` refresh it using `order.refresh()`

When writing database models:

* Don't use `Field(...)` unless required (i.e. when specifying a JSON type for a `dict` or pydantic model using `Field(sa_type=JSONB)`). For instance, use `= None` instead of `= Field(default=None)`.
* Add enum classes close to where they are used, unless they are used across multiple classes (then put them at the top of the file)
* Use `ModelName.foreign_key()` when generating a foreign key field
* Store currency as an integer, e.g. $1 = 100.
* `before_save`, `after_save(self):`, `after_updated(self):` are lifecycle methods (modelled after ActiveRecord) you can use.

Example:

```python
class Distribution(
    BaseModel, TimestampsMixin, SoftDeletionMixin, table=True
):
    """Triple-quoted strings for multi-line class docstring"""

    id: TypeID[Literal["dst"]] = TypeIDPrimaryKey("dst")

    date_field_with_comment: datetime | None = None
    "use a string under the field to add a comment about the field"

    # no need to add a comment about an obvious field; no need for line breaks if there are no field-level docstrings
    title: str = Field(unique=True)
    state: str

    optional_field: str | None = None

    # here's how relationships are constructed
    doctor_id: TypeID = Doctor.foreign_key()
    doctor: Doctor = Relationship()
