## Pytest Tests


- Look first to `app.factories.*` instead of `app.models.*` to generate any required database state
  - For example, to create and persist a `Distribution` record `DistributionFactory.save()`
  - If a factory doesn't exist for the model you are working with, create one.
  - You can customize one or more params in a factory using `DistributionFactory.save(host="custom_host.com)`
- Use `faker` factory to generate emails, etc.
- Do not mock or patch unless I instruct you to. Test as much of the application stack as possible in each test.
- If you get lazy attribute errors, or need a database session to share across logic, use the `db_session` fixture to fix the issue.
  - Note that when writing route tests a `db_session` is not needed for the logic inside of the route.
- When testing Stripe, use the sandbox API. Never mock out Stripe interactions unless explicitly told to.
- Omit obvious docstrs and comments. Add comments for non-obvious but easy-to-miss lines that are key to what the test is checking.
- If a docstring needs formatting, use markdown. Use Google Style.

### Example Test

Below is an example test, you'll notice the following:

- Docstr is omitted since the purpose of the test is obvious
- Comment about the `county` is added since it's the main point of the test
- Newline between test setup, functionality under test, and assertions against result
- `api_app_url_path_for` helper is used instead of hardcoded routes

```python
from app.generated.fastapi_typed_routes import api_app_url_path_for
import json

def test_calculate_quote_unknown_county(client):
    payload = {
        "subscriber": {"age": 35, "gender": "M"},
        # fake county to ensure error is thrown
        "county": "NotACounty",
    }

    response = client.post(
        api_app_url_path_for("composite_quote"),
        json=payload,
    )

    assert_status(response, status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_CONTENT)
```

### File Structure

* If there's more than a handful of tests in a folder, you should probably create subfolders.
* File name should be related to the file or primary class / functionality the test is covering. Do not add a component to the test name that exists in the test file path.
  * Example: `app/routes/unauthenticated/quote.py` should be `tests/routes/unauthenticated/quote_test.py`
* `tests/routes/{unauthenticated,authenticated}` and a handful of top-level test files for fastapi API route testing.
* `tests/integration/` for browser tests
