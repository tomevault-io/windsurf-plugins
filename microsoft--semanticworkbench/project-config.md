# Knowledge Transfer Assistant

A sophisticated dual-mode assistant that facilitates collaborative knowledge sharing between Coordinators (knowledge creators) and Team members (knowledge receivers) within the Semantic Workbench platform.

## Core Architecture

### Dual-Mode Operation
The assistant operates in two distinct modes with role-specific capabilities:

1. **Coordinator Mode**: Creates and manages knowledge packages, responds to information requests, shares files
2. **Team Mode**: Accesses shared knowledge, requests information, tracks learning progress

### Cross-Conversation Communication
The system manages three types of conversations:
- **Coordinator Conversation**: Personal workspace for knowledge creation
- **Shareable Team Conversation**: Template conversation (never directly used)
- **Team Conversation(s)**: Individual conversations for each team member

### Key Components

- **Knowledge Transfer Manager** (`assistant/domain/`): Orchestrates the entire knowledge transfer lifecycle
- **Share Manager** (`assistant/files.py`): Handles file synchronization across conversations
- **Storage System** (`assistant/storage.py`, `assistant/storage_models.py`): Persistent state management
- **UI Tabs** (`assistant/ui-tabs/`): Real-time visual dashboards showing transfer status
- **Notification System** (`assistant/notifications.py`): Cross-conversation communication

### Core Artifacts
- **Knowledge Brief**: Introductory overview for team members
- **Knowledge Digest**: Auto-updating LLM-generated information repository
- **Learning Objectives**: Structured goals with specific outcomes
- **Information Requests**: Team member questions with priority levels

## Development Commands

### Basic Operations
```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test with verbose output
uv run pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function -v

# Manual inspector test
python tests/test_inspector.py

# Type checking
make type-check

# Code quality
make lint
make format
```

### Assistant Management
```bash
# Start assistant service
make start

# Docker operations
make docker-build
make docker-run-local
```

- `assistant-extensions[attachments]`: File attachment support with dashboard cards
- `content-safety`: Content moderation capabilities
- `openai-client`: LLM integration for knowledge digest generation

## Development Guidelines

### Code Philosophy
The project follows a "wabi-sabi" philosophy emphasizing:
- Ruthless simplicity with minimal abstractions
- Present-moment focus rather than future-proofing
- Trust in emergence from simple, well-defined components
- Direct library integration with minimal wrappers

### Code Style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- Use type annotations consistently
- Write docstrings for functions and classes

### Quality Assurance
