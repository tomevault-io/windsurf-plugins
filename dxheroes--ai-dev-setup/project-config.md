# General Coding Standards

Apply these standards across all code:

## Code Quality
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small (single responsibility)
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

## File Organization
- Group related functionality in logical directories
- Use consistent naming: `kebab-case` for files, `PascalCase` for components/classes
- Separate concerns: types, validators, transformers, services
- Keep business logic separate from framework-specific code

## Import Organization
1. External libraries (React, Prisma, etc.)
2. Internal utilities and types
3. Relative imports
- Use absolute imports where configured
- Group imports logically with blank lines

## Error Handling
- Always handle errors explicitly
- Use typed error classes when possible
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately (see error-handling rule)

## Security Mindset
- Validate all external inputs
- Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
- Never log sensitive data
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Use environment variables for secrets
