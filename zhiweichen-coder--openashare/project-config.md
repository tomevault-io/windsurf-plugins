# AGENTS.md

## Project

This repository is an A-share AI analysis workspace built around `FastAPI + Next.js`.

Key areas:

- `api/`: FastAPI entrypoints, schemas, and service layer
- `app/`: Next.js App Router pages
- `components/`: frontend UI components
- `lib/`: frontend API client and shared types
- `ashare/`: analysis engine, monitoring, and data modules
- `scripts/`: local run helpers

## Working Rules

- Preserve the current product shape: stock analysis, news, hotspots, portfolio, and agent chat are the main paths.
- Prefer minimal, targeted edits over broad refactors.
- Keep secrets out of the repo. Never write real API keys into tracked files.
- When changing API contracts, keep `api/schemas.py` and `lib/types.ts` aligned.
- When working on agent behavior, prefer existing service boundaries over embedding business logic in the frontend.

## Information Source Preference

For time-sensitive or event-specific finance requests, prefer locally installed, authoritative financial information tools over generic search, especially for:

- latest stock news
- announcements
- broker research
- policy interpretation
- trading rules
- market event analysis
- external financial information that should not rely on generic web search

When freshness and source quality matter, avoid generic or stale web results. Treat returned facts as sourced information and label any downstream judgment as inference.

Do not document private local skill names, API keys, or local agent wiring in tracked project files. Do not commit local skill build artifacts or other machine-specific agent configuration to GitHub.

## Validation

- Backend tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_api_app.py -q`
- Frontend build: `npm run build`
