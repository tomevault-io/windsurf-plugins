# Core Framework Engineering Standard

Changes to the runtime, compiler, SSR/hydration engine, scheduler, reconciler,
and framework build pipeline multiply across every Octane application. Treat
performance, correctness, code size, and maintainability as release criteria,
not cleanup work for a later change.

## Establish the contract before editing

- Read the owning source comments, callers, tests, benchmark harness, and the
  documented React parity or Octane divergence. State the consumer-observable
  contract and the invariants that must not move.
- Map every execution mode the change can reach: mount/update/delete, dev/prod,
  client/server, render/hydrate, sync/concurrent, success/error/abort, and
  compiler authoring/output paths. Test only applicable modes, but do not omit a
  mode merely because the first implementation path did not mention it.
- Identify whether the code is on a hot path and estimate frequency and scale.
  Framework fundamentals are presumed performance-sensitive until inspection
  shows otherwise.
- For a bug, first add or identify a behavioral test with a credible pre-fix
  failure. For an optimization, record a relevant baseline before changing the
  implementation. Do not infer speed from shorter source or generated output.

## Protect the performance model

- Keep common paths direct. Avoid new allocations, closures, object-shape
  changes, polymorphic calls, scans, DOM reads/writes, serialization work, or
  scheduling hops per component/render/node unless measurement justifies them.
- Push rare behavior to cold branches and pay for optional features only when
  used. Do not penalize every component to simplify an uncommon case.
- Consider the whole cost transfer: compiler time, generated code, parse and
  load cost, runtime CPU, memory retention, garbage collection, DOM operations,
  SSR throughput, hydration work, and bundle size. Moving cost between layers
  is not automatically an improvement.
- Reuse existing deterministic benchmarks. Compare baseline and candidate with
  the same command, environment, warmup, and iteration policy. Use ratio guards
  or stable operation counters for regression protection; use timing results
  only when the signal exceeds noise.
- Never claim a performance improvement without measurements. If representative
  measurement is impractical, say so, avoid the claim, and document the
  remaining performance risk.

## Implement the smallest durable design

- Prefer fixing the owning abstraction over adding flags or special cases at
  callers. Preserve fast paths and existing data representations unless the
  benefit of changing them is demonstrated.
- Keep invariants explicit near the code that enforces them. Comments explain
  why a non-obvious constraint exists; tests protect observable behavior.
- Do not weaken correctness, diagnostics, accessibility, security, or supported
  semantics for benchmark gains. A faster wrong or incomplete path is a
  regression.
- Avoid speculative generality. New caches, queues, memoization, and retained
  state require an invalidation/lifetime argument and tests for cleanup,
  reentrancy, errors, and aborts where applicable.

## Preserve the compiler emission architecture

- Generated JavaScript and TypeScript syntax exists only as AST. Build and
  rewrite it copy-on-write with `@tsrx/core` builders and clone helpers, preserve
  authored origin locations, and print each emitted Program exactly once. Do not
  assemble generated syntax as strings, print fragments for interpolation,
  reparse generated output, or edit code after the final print.
- Static template HTML exists as compiler-owned template IR with authored
  origins. Serialize each completed template exactly once into the existing
  runtime HTML string ABI, then embed that string as an AST literal. HTML, CSS,
  module specifier values, diagnostics, and ordinary string literals remain
  textual data; they are not permission to construct JavaScript through text.
- `slot-hooks.js` and `runtime-requests.js` are the narrow text-edit exceptions:
  hook slots preserve authored line numbers without a source map, while runtime
  targeting edits only lexer-identified module specifier ranges in source that
  otherwise passes through unchanged.
  Volar/type-only generation delegates its one Program print to `@tsrx/core`;
  keep `boundaryTokens: true` so structural token boundaries resolve through
  its source map without changing output bytes.
- Before adding a manual ESTree object, verify that no builder or clone helper
  represents the shape. Keep any unavoidable unsupported shape in the compiler
  AST emit audit's explicit inventory and explain why it cannot use a builder.

## Perform an adversarial self-review

Before handoff, inspect the complete diff as if rejecting another author's
change. At minimum:

1. Try to falsify the solution with empty, large, repeated, nested, reordered,
   reentrant, error, abort, cleanup, and hydration cases that apply.
2. Trace new state and allocations from creation through invalidation and
   release. Look for retained trees, duplicate work, stale closures, and work
   that moved from a cold path to a hot one.
3. Re-read every changed call site and adjacent fast path. Check dev/prod and
