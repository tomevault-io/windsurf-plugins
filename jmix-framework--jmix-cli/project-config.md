# AGENTS.md

This file contains repository-specific guidance for coding agents and
contributors working on Jmix CLI.

## Project mission

Jmix CLI creates Jmix projects from the command line through `jmix new`. It
supports both a keyboard-driven wizard and deterministic non-interactive use in
scripts and CI.

Project generation should remain compatible with the templates and behavior
used by Jmix Studio.

## Read first

- [README.md](README.md) is the public source of truth for supported commands,
  requirements, and contributor-facing workflows.
- `src/main/kotlin/io/jmix/cli/` contains the production code.
- `src/test/kotlin/io/jmix/cli/` contains unit and integration coverage.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines the required cross-platform checks.

Verify behavior against the current code and tests. Do not rely on historical
implementation notes when they disagree with the implementation.

## Architecture

| Area                | Location                                                  | Responsibility                                                                        |

| Template repository | `repo/TemplateRepository.kt`                              | Maven metadata, downloads, caching, and offline fallback                              |

| Environment         | `env/`                                                    | JDK and Git discovery and Jmix/JDK compatibility checks                               |
| Self-update         | `update/`, `UpdateCommand.kt`                             | Startup auto-update, old-version and stale-cache cleanup                              |

| Distribution        | `install.*`, `buildSrc/`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Self-contained images, installers, checksums, and release publishing                  |

## Core invariants

- Keep the implementation on Kotlin/JVM. Project templates use Groovy template
  engines, including scriptlets, and both file paths and file contents are
  rendered.
- Use the existing
  `io.jmix.templates.studio:jmix-studio-templates` artifact. Do not introduce a
  second template format or maintain a forked built-in template set.
- Preserve Studio-compatible generation behavior: `.globals` evaluation,
  binding names, binary-file handling, localized message generation, Gradle
  wrapper permissions and line endings, and optional `git init`.
- Keep every wizard choice usable in non-interactive mode through an argument,
  option, or deterministic default.
- Preserve both terminal paths: enhanced raw-terminal interaction and the
  numbered/line-input fallback used by IDE consoles and pipes.
- Keep template caches isolated by repository URL. A custom repository must
  never receive metadata or artifacts cached for another repository.
- Preserve offline fallback without accepting corrupt or partial downloads.
- Validate the selected Jmix version against the supported JDK versions before
  generation. Generated projects use their bundled Gradle wrapper.
- Keep release archives self-contained. The bundled runtime starts the CLI;
  environment detection must continue to report JDKs available to the generated
  project rather than treating that private runtime as a development JDK.
- User-facing failures should be concise and actionable; avoid exposing Java
  stack traces for expected network, validation, or template errors.

## Build and verification

The Gradle build provisions its JDK 25 toolchain automatically.

Run the standard checks:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

Run a focused test while developing:

```shell
./gradlew test --tests 'io.jmix.cli.generator.ProjectGeneratorTest'
```

Run the real-template integration test for changes to repository access,
