# Project Guidelines

## Python Development Standards

### Type Annotations
- Use Python 3.11+ type annotation syntax throughout
- Include type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use `typing` module imports only when necessary for complex types
- Prefer built-in generic types (e.g., `list[str]` instead of `List[str]`)

### Environment Management
- Always use `uv` for Python environment and dependency management
- Use `uv add` for adding new dependencies
- Use `uv add --dev` for development dependencies
- Run commands through `uv run` when needed
- Always use `uv run script.python` or `uv run python -m module.path` instead of `python ...` commands

### No Cruft
Avoid adding `#!/usr/bin/env python3` to the top of Python files.

## Clean Code Guidelines

### Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

### Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used

### Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

### Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

### Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Behavioral Guidelines

### Verify Information
Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

### No Apologies
Never use apologies.

### No Understanding Feedback
Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

### No Summaries Of Your Work
Don't summarize changes made.

### No Unnecessary Confirmations
Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

### Preserve Existing Code
Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

### No Implementation Checks
Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

### No Unnecessary Updates
Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

### Provide Real File Links
Always provide links to the real files, not x.md.

### No Current Implementation
Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

### No Premature Generalizations
If you are asked to implement a specific backend, just stick to that. Do not generalize to other common or related use-cases. You can offer to implement these, but only do so if explicitly instructed to.

## Dependencies

This project uses:
- **ruff**: Fast Python linter and code formatter
- **just**: Command runner -- put commonly-used shell commands into the `justfile`!
