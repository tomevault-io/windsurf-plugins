This project is a benchmark comparing startup performance of a CLI bundle between:

- Node.js SEA with code cache 
- Bun executable with `--compile` and `--bytecode`

Other notes:
- The Node.js CLI bundle is pre-bundled using Rolldown.
- The benchmark itself is using `hyperfine`.
- Use `npm` to run scripts.
