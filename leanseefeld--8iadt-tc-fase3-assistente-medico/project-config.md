description: Assistant replies match the user's message language first; code and URLs in English; UI, human-facing repo docs, and code comments in Português Brasileiro pt-BR.

Ensure you reason about this rule before generating any responses and documents so that this rule is always respected and the correct language for each output is determined.

# Language conventions

## Priority (apply in this order)

1. **Assistant reply language** — Match the language of the **current user message** for explanations, answers, and **plans** written for the conversation (including agent implementation plans). Exception: the user explicitly asks for another language. This takes precedence over any default bias toward pt-BR for “project work.”
2. **Repository artifacts** — The sections **Project artifacts** below apply to **files and strings committed to the repo** (code, UI copy, README, comments). They do **not** redefine the language of chat replies.

**Separation:** Explanations, plans, and chat replies are **not** “README,” “UI copy,” or “human-facing documentation” in the sense of § Project artifacts. Only § Assistant replies governs their language.

**Counter-example:** The user writes in English → the assistant explains and plans in **English** in chat; in the same turn, edits to `README.md` body, UI strings, and code **comments/docstrings** in the repo still follow **§ Project artifacts** (pt-BR for those artifacts; English for identifiers).

**Ambiguous or mixed-language messages:** Default assistant replies to **English** unless the user has clearly been using **pt-BR** as the dominant language in the thread.

## Assistant replies

Detect the language the user writes in for their instructions and **reply in that same language**, unless they explicitly ask for another language. Plans should also respect the initial language of the conversation - even if they are going to be committed.

## Project artifacts (independent of chat language)

Rules below apply to **repository content**, not to the language of assistant chat messages.

### English

- Code identifiers: variables, functions, classes, modules, file and folder names.
- Routes and full URLs: paths, query parameters, slugs, and API segments.

### Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR)

- User-facing UI copy: labels, buttons, validation and error messages shown to users, etc.
- Human-facing documentation: README, guides, ADRs, and project documentation in PR descriptions.
- Code comments and docstrings.

## Example

```python
# Calcula o total com desconto aplicado ao carrinho.
def calculate_cart_total(items: list[CartItem], discount_percent: float) -> Decimal:
    ...
```

```tsx
// Exibe o resumo do pedido antes da confirmação.
<button type="button">{t("order.confirm")}</button>
```

Identifiers and code symbols in English; translation values and UI strings in pt-BR. When editing or generating code, keep this split.

Avoid European Portuguese ("secção", "ficheiro", "autocarro", "eléctrico").
