# Report and wait (before implementing)

## When this applies

Activate when the user **references this rule** (`@report-and-wait-before-implement` or the file under `.cursor/rules/`) **or** ends the message with one of these signals:

- `/report-and-wait`
- `report and wait`

If the signal appears **at the end of the message**, it overrides earlier parts of the same message that imply immediate implementation: **do not implement the plan in this turn**.

## Required behavior

1. **Do not** apply patches, create implementation files, or run “execute the plan” steps until the user sends another message.
2. **Reply** in clear language with:
   - **What was done** this turn (reads, conclusions, mental drafts — do not invent changes that did not happen).
   - **Proposed next actions** (concrete, ordered steps).
   - **An explicit question or invitation** to confirm, adjust priorities, or say “ok” for the next step.
3. **Wait** for the user’s reply before implementing.

## Reading and research

- Allowed: read files, search the repo, explain or refine the plan in prose.
- Avoid: persistent changes to the project (unless the user explicitly asked for *only* documentation/rule work and that is this turn’s scope).

## Example reply (structure)

```markdown
## What I did this turn
- …

## Suggested next steps
1. …
2. …

## Confirmation
Should I proceed with step 1 in the next message, or do you want to adjust …?
```
