# Push to GitHub After Changes

Whenever you complete a task that modifies files in this repo:

1. **Stage all changes**: `git add -A`
2. **Commit** with a short message that describes what was done: `git commit -m "Brief description of changes"`
3. **Push** to the default branch: `git push origin main`

Use PowerShell-compatible commands (e.g. `;` instead of `&&` for chaining). Run these in the project root (`d:\taxi`). If the user asks not to push, or there are no changes, skip the push step.
