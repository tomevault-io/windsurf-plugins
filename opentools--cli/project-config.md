## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a Node.js based CLI tool.  The source code is written in TypeScript.

## CODE STYLE
Adhere to standard TypeScript coding conventions.  Use Prettier for formatting.

## FOLDER ORGANIZATION
The project follows a standard structure:
- `src`: Source code.
- `test`: Unit tests.
- `cli`:  Contains the CLI application's entry point and related files.


## TECH STACK
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- npm
- shx (used in build script)
- OCLIF (used for CLI framework)
- zod (added 2025-03-12)


## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS
- All commands should be defined in the `src/commands` directory.
- Unit tests should be written for every command. Tests should accurately reflect command functionality. Avoid simple string matching in tests; instead verify behavior.
- The `package.json` file should clearly define the entry point for the CLI.
- Avoid using `any` type;  explicitly define types for all variables to prevent runtime errors.  (Added 2025-03-12)
-  Interface properties should be sorted alphabetically to satisfy `perfectionist/sort-object-types` linting rule. (Added 2025-03-12)


## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES
- Before running the CLI, build the TypeScript code using `npm run build`.
- Version updates will be managed using semantic versioning. (Further details on versioning strategy needed)
- To resolve TypeScript errors and missing modules, follow the steps outlined in `2025-03-12_14-21-fixing-typescript-errors-and-missing-modules.md`.  This includes installing `zod` and correctly typing variables to avoid `'value' is of type 'unknown'` errors.  The `npm install zod` command will install the necessary dependency.  Type assertions like `as [string, EnvVariable][]` may be necessary to resolve type errors related to 'unknown' types.
- To run tests, use `npm run test`. Tests should be updated to reflect actual command behavior, not simple string matching. Remove tests for commands that do not exist.  Use `npm run lint -- --fix` to automatically fix many linting errors.  To run tests without linting, use `npm test --no-posttest`.
- Address deprecation warnings related to `fs.Stats` constructor.


## REFERENCE EXAMPLES
- Running the CLI from source:  See instructions in `2025-03-11_12-54-running-a-package-from-source-instructions.md`
- Fixing TypeScript errors and missing modules: See `2025-03-12_14-21-fixing-typescript-errors-and-missing-modules.md`
- Fixing type issues in `uninstall.ts`: See `2025-03-12_15-33-fixing-type-issues-in-uninstall-ts.md`


## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
Documentation will be maintained using markdown files and integrated into the repository.

## DEBUGGING
- Ensure the TypeScript code is built (`npm run build`) before running the CLI.
- The error "command i not found" indicates that the TypeScript code needs to be compiled.
-  `'value' is of type 'unknown'` errors in TypeScript indicate improperly typed variables.  Refer to `2025-03-12_14-21-fixing-typescript-errors-and-missing-modules.md` for solutions.
- Missing module errors (e.g., "Cannot find module 'zod'") indicate missing dependencies. Use `npm install` to install required packages.
- Test failures often indicate a mismatch between test expectations and actual command output. Refactor tests to reflect actual command behavior.
-  Deprecation warnings related to `fs.Stats` constructor indicate outdated code.  Update the relevant code sections.
- Use `npm run lint -- --fix` to automatically fix many linting errors.
-  `any` type errors indicate a need for explicit type definitions.  Properly type variables to resolve these errors. (Added 2025-03-12)
- `perfectionist/sort-object-types` linting errors indicate improperly ordered object properties. Ensure properties are alphabetically ordered. (Added 2025-03-12)


## FINAL DOs AND DON'Ts
- **DO** use TypeScript.
- **DO** write unit tests that accurately reflect command functionality.
- **DO** build the project using `npm run build` before running.
- **DO** follow the folder organization guidelines.
- **DO** install all necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
- **DO** explicitly define types for all variables to avoid runtime errors. (Added 2025-03-12)
- **DO** sort object properties alphabetically to satisfy linting rules. (Added 2025-03-12)
- **DON'T** run the CLI without building the TypeScript code first.
- **DON'T** leave variables untyped; ensure proper type declarations to avoid runtime errors.
- **DON'T** write tests that rely on simple string matching of command output.  Focus on verifying actual command behavior.
- **DON'T** ignore deprecation warnings; address them promptly to maintain code quality and avoid future compatibility issues.
- **DON'T** ignore linting errors; address them using `npm run lint -- --fix` or manually.
- **DON'T** use `any` type unless absolutely necessary and with clear justification. (Added 2025-03-12)
- **DON'T** leave object properties unsorted; maintain alphabetical order for consistency and to satisfy linting rules. (Added 2025-03-12)
