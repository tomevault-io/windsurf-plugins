## MANDATORY: Use td for Task Management

You must run td usage --new-session at conversation start (or after /clear) to see current work.
Use td usage -q for subsequent reads.

## Git Workflow (Solo Contributor)

**Direct push to `main` is allowed.** Branch protection is off.

**Branch when it earns it, push directly when it doesn't.** The decision is
size and reversibility, not policy:

- **Direct push to main:** small, self-contained changes (a single playbook,
  a doc edit, a fix). One logical change per commit. Run `just canon-check`
  first when touching `canon/`.
- **Feature branch + PR:** larger work, multi-step changes, anything that
  benefits from CI running on a branch before merge. The PR is a review
  trail and a CI gate, not a permission gate.

**Why no branch protection** (recorded so this doesn't regenerate as a
barnacle): branch protection's main value is the peer-review gate, and this
is a solo repo — there are no peers. CI gates (`quality`, `lint-markdown`)
still run on branches and PRs regardless. The friction-to-utility ratio
failed the Watt test for a repo whose work is mostly meta-text (playbooks,
briefs, decisions, AGENTS.md edits). Removed 2026-07-05.

**Server-side AI reviewers** (CodeRabbit, Qodo) run **advisory**, not gating.
They are strong on code (smells, missing tests, type errors, security) and
near-zero on meta-text (they can't judge whether a playbook embodies its
discipline). Read their findings on code PRs; discount them on prose PRs.
Do not block on them.

## MANDATORY: Use tree-sitter for Code Audit

For code analysis and refactoring tasks, the agent shall perform a structural audit via Tree-sitter before executing any text-based (grep/regex) searches. This protocol requires: 1) Identification of the relevant grammar; 2) Execution of structural queries to map function definitions, dependencies, and type-hierarchies; 3) Conversion of this map into DOT notation for planning. Text-based search is permitted only for non-code assets (comments, documentation)

## MANDATORY: Canon Consistency on Startup

The `canon/` bundle at repo root holds curated, portable method playbooks (OKF-conformant). It is operational only when self-consistent — when `INDEX.jsonl` (source of truth) matches the files on disk, and every entry carries OKF frontmatter.

**Before reading, editing, or pulling from canon — run:**

```bash
just orient        # ends with a canon consistency check
```

`just orient` runs `just canon-check` as its last step. If the canon check fails, **do not proceed** with other work — fix the drift first (`canon/INDEX.jsonl` is the source of truth; regenerate with `just canon-index`). Do not build on an inconsistent foundation.

**Adding to canon:** one entry per commit, branch off main, update `INDEX.jsonl` then `just canon-index` then append to `canon/log.md`, `just canon-check` must pass before commit. See `canon/index.md` for the full protocol.

## Workflow

### Local Development

Direct. No agents, no multiplexers.

- **Editor:** Zed
- **Terminal:** Built-in or standalone
- **Run:** `bun run`, `just`, `bash`
- **Test:** `bun test`

### Remote Development

Monitoring only.

- Watch: `git log`, `td status`, `bun test`
- Act: Only when necessary

## The Silo Framework 

The **silo** framework for externalizing domain knowledge is still useful:

```
my-silo/
├── .silo              # Manifest
├── README.md          # Domain rules
├── schema.json        # Validation
├── queries.json       # Named jq filters
├── justfile           # Recipes
├── harvest.jsonl      # Raw data
└── process.sh        # Domain logic
```

**When to use silos:**
- Persisting domain knowledge across sessions
- Structured data pipelines
- Named query reuse

**When not to use silos:**
- One-off scripts → just write the script
- Simple tasks → direct terminal
- Real-time interaction → direct terminal

---

## Prerequisites

- `bun` — runtime
- `just` — task runner (`brew install just`)
- `jq` — JSON processing (`brew install jq`)
- `zed` — editor (optional)

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Run a script
bun run server.ts

# Test
bun test

# Watch mode
bun --watch run server.ts

# Task runner
just --list

# Watch tests
bun test --watch
```

---

## Experimental Tiers

Scripts evolve through tiers as they mature:

```
@scripts/lab/     → scripts/  → src/
  ↑                 ↑           ↑
  Tier 0            Tier 1      Tier 2
  (experimental)    (stable)   (production)
```

| Tier | Location | Rules |
|------|----------|-------|
| 0 | `@scripts/lab/` | Experimental. No review. Promote when stable. |
| 1 | `scripts/` | Stable. Reviewed. Production-ready. |
| 2 | `src/` | Full rigor. Types, tests, documentation. |

### Tier 0: @scripts/lab/

Experimental scripts with `@` prefix. Agents try ideas here:

```bash
scripts/lab/
├── @entropy-viz.sh    # Trying visualization
├── @jq-playground.sh  # Testing jq patterns
└── @experiment.sh     # Wild idea
```

**Rules:**
- No review required
- Promote to `scripts/` when stable
- Gamma-loop archives stale experiments

### Tier 1: scripts/

Stable, production scripts. Reviewed before promotion:

```bash
scripts/
