# Repository working agreements

- Make small, focused commits as work progresses, as requested by the owner.
- For banners, comparison charts, and other project visuals, use Montage semantic colors. Follow the palette and visual guidance in [assets/README.md](assets/README.md); do not introduce an unrelated palette unless the owner requests it.
- Treat `benchmarks/featured.json` as the single pointer to the landing-page benchmark. Whenever featured benchmark data, charts, paths, or claims change, run `python3 -B scripts/sync_featured_benchmark.py`, review both `README.md` and `README.ko.md`, then run the same command with `--check`. Never update one language or a plotted number independently.
- When a reviewed model result or material skill capability changes, refresh the dated checkpoint in `benchmarks/CURRENT-CANDIDATE-STATUS.md` and any affected English/Korean capability descriptions. Link the measured resource and limitations; do not relabel old measurements or promote a single favorable pair into the featured benchmark. Keep historical checkpoints explicitly historical, and separate local tests from model evidence and hosted release checks.
- Label non-featured checkpoint summaries with their checkpoint ID, date and measured resource rather than an independently maintained “latest” claim. Keep adverse results and limitations accessible when reorganizing onboarding; synchronize both README languages without changing frozen charts.
- Keep README onboarding concise: link chronological per-tool experiments from the current status and dated reports instead of accumulating each development step in the landing page. Preserve the dated `docs/DEVELOPMENT-NOTES*.md` snapshots; keep mixed/adverse evidence and limitations visible in both README languages.
- Keep `benchmarks/CURRENT-CANDIDATE-STATUS.md` a concise dated decision index. Preserve superseded checkpoints in same-directory dated history snapshots so relative evidence links remain valid. Before repeating an experiment or adding analysis tooling, search histories and existing scripts for the same approach; reused development cases are not independent validation.
