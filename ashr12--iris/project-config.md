# Dark surfaces must not band

Contour lines in a dark UI come from 8-bit quantization: sRGB has very few code
levels near black, so a wide soft gradient has nothing to put between its steps
and renders as flat plateaus with hard edges. Below the sRGB toe brightness is
proportional to code value, so **one step at value 7 is a ~14% brightness jump;
at value 21 it is ~5%** and stops reading as a line. Full explanation in
`README.md` → "Dark UI without colour banding".

## Rules

1. **A gradient that crosses more pixels than it has code levels is not a
   gradient — it is plateaus with visible edges.** Use a flat fill.
2. **Never take a surface below `--bg-0` (`#0b111c`).** Vignettes, scrims and
   overlays must land above that floor too, or they drag their region back into
   the crush zone.
3. **Gradients on dark surfaces must be small and steep** — a 40px button fade is
   fine, a 900px wash is not.
4. **Depth = one step of fill tone + spacing.** Not washes, not outlines. Surfaces
   nest by tone (background → panel → card) and carry no border; borders are only
   for things that float (menus, popovers).
5. **One light source.** Only the reactor canvas glows. Note the trap: on a flat
   background a lone soft halo becomes the only brightness variation, which is
   exactly what vignetting looks like.

```css
/* ❌ BAD — 2 levels of green stretched over 860px, plus window-sized washes */
background:
  radial-gradient(92% 78% at 50% 30%, rgba(18, 36, 68, 0.55), transparent 74%),
  linear-gradient(180deg, #05070d 0%, #030509 100%);

/* ✅ GOOD */
background: var(--bg-1);
```

## Do not "fix" banding with these

- **Noise/dither overlays.** Cannot remove a staircase already baked into a
  rasterized layer, and `backdrop-filter` averages any dither beneath it away, so
  banding returns inside blurred glass.
- **`mix-blend-mode: overlay`.** Resolves to `2 × backdrop × source` below
  mid-grey, so on dark surfaces its effect is a fraction of one code level.
- **More gradient stops.** The limit is quantization, not stop count.
