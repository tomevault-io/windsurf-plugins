# Server Management Instructions

## Critical Rule: Do NOT Start Servers

Under no circumstances should you attempt to start any servers in this project. The servers are already running and managed by the user. Specifically:

1. Do NOT run commands like:
   - `npm run dev`
   - `npm start` 
   - Any command that would start the frontend React application
   - Any command that would start the backend Python application

2. When making changes to the codebase:
   - Code changes will be automatically applied
   - The user handles server restarts when needed
   - Do not suggest starting or restarting servers

## Project Structure

This project consists of:
- A React frontend in the `frontend/` directory 
- A Python backend in the `fly/` directory
- Both are already running and managed separately by the user
