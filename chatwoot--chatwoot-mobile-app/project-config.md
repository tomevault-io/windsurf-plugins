# Chatwoot Mobile App - Combined Cursor Rules

## Project Overview

Chatwoot Mobile is a mobile app for the Chatwoot platform, built with React Native and Expo.

### Main Features:
- Ability to view conversations
- Ability to send messages
- Follow up on customer conversations on the go
- Reply easily with canned responses
- Receive real-time notifications about messages
- Communicate with other te notes
- Assign statuses to conversa and Structure

You are an expeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development.

### General Principles
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Component Modularity: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces. Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Follow Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://docs.expo.dev/

### Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

### TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use maps instead
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety

### Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements
- Use declarative JSX
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting

## UI and Styling

- Use the package @https://github.com/jaredh159/tailwind-react-native-classnames for styles
- Use Expo's built-in components for common UI patterns and layouts
- Implement responsive design with Flexbox and Expo's useWindowDimensions for screen size adjustments
- Use styled-components or Tailwind CSS for component styling
- Implement dark mode support using Expo's useColorScheme
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props
- Leverage react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations and gestures

## Safe Area Management
- Use SafeAreaProvider from react-native-safe-area-context to manage safe areas globally in your app
- Wrap top-level components with SafeAreaView to handle notches, status bars, and other screen insets on both iOS and Android
- Use SafeAreaScrollView for scrollable content to ensure it respects safe area boundaries
- Avoid hardcoding padding or margins for safe areas; rely on SafeAreaView and context hooks

## Performance Optimization
- Minimize the use of useState and useEffect; prefer context and reducers for state management
- Use Expo's AppLoading and SplashScreen for optimized app startup experience
- Optimize images: implement lazy loading with expo-image
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components with React's Suspense and dynamic imports
- Profile and monitor performance using React Native's built-in tools and Expo's debugging features
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately
- Always clearTimeout or clearInterval when using them — especially in event listeners, effects (useEffect), or animations

## Navigation
- Use react-navigation for routing and navigation; follow its best practices for stack, tab, and drawer navigators
- Leverage deep linking and universal links for better user engagement and navigation flow
- Use dynamic routes with expo-router for better navigation handling

## State Management
- Use React Context and useReducer for managing global state
- Leverage react-query for data fetching and caching; avoid excessive API calls
- For complex state management, consider using Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- Handle URL search parameters using libraries like expo-linking

## Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Use react-native-encrypted-storage for secure storage of sensitive data
- Ensure secure communication with APIs using HTTPS and proper authentication
- Use Expo's Security guidelines to protect your app: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/security/

## Key Conventions
- Rely on Expo's managed workflow for streamlined development and deployment
- Prioritize Mobile Web Vitals (Load Time, Jank, and Responsiveness)
- Use expo-constants for managing environment variables and configuration
- Use expo-permissions to handle device permissions gracefully
- Follow Expo's best practices for app deployment and publishing: https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/
- Ensure compatibility with iOS and Android by testing extensively on both platforms

## Project Structure

### Directories:
- **src/** - Main source code directory containing app components, screens, and business logic
- **ios/** - iOS native code and configuration
- **android/** - Android native code and configuration
- **assets/** - Static assets like images, fonts, and other media files
- **__mocks__/** - Jest test mocks and fixtures
