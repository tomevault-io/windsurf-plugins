# Agentic Knowledge Graph Construction

Agentic Knowledge Graph is a multi-agent system for constructing knowledge graphs, built on Google ADK (Agent Driver Kit) and designed to interact with Neo4j databases. It's a companion project to the deeplearning.ai course on agentic knowledge graph construction.

Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Working Effectively

### Environment Setup and Dependencies
- Install uv package manager: `pip3 install uv`
- Requires Python 3.12 (specified in .python-version and .tool-versions)
- Docker is required for integration tests
- Bootstrap the project:
  - `uv venv` -- creates virtual environment, takes ~0.05 seconds
  - `uv sync` -- installs all dependencies, takes ~6-7 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 60+ minutes for safety.
  - `cp .env.example .env` -- set up environment configuration

### Environment Configuration
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure as needed
- Key variables:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY=` -- required for full LLM functionality
  - `LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o` -- default model configuration
  - `NEO4J_DSN=bolt://neo4j:secret@localhost:7687/neo4j` -- Neo4j connection
  - `LOGLEVEL=INFO` -- logging configuration

### Testing
- Unit tests (fast, no external dependencies): `uv run pytest -q` -- takes ~1.5 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 30+ minutes.
  - NOTE: Some unit tests in test_tool_result.py currently fail due to existing codebase issues. This is expected.
  - Working unit tests: `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_pydantic_neo4j.py -v` -- passes in ~0.08 seconds
- Integration tests (requires Docker): `uv run pytest -q -m integration` -- takes ~50 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 120+ minutes.
  - NOTE: Integration tests may fail with authentication errors in some environments. This is expected behavior.

### Running the Agentic System
- Start the ADK web interface: `uv run adk web src/agentic_kg/coordinators/` -- starts on port 8000 by default
  - If port 8000 is in use: `uv run adk web src/agentic_kg/coordinators/ --port 8001`
  - Takes ~5 seconds to start. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 60+ minutes.
  - Access at http://localhost:8000 (or configured port)
- Two available coordinators/agents:
  1. `single_agent` - uses a single sub-agent that interfaces with Neo4j directly
  2. `multi_agent` - hierarchical system with specialized sub-agents for different phases
- Web interface allows agent selection and interactive chat
- Full functionality requires LLM API keys configured in .env

## Validation
- Always manually test the ADK web interface after making changes to coordinators or agents
- Test both agent types (single_agent and multi_agent) when making significant changes
- Without LLM API keys, the system will show connection errors but the interface should still load
- ALWAYS run through at least one complete interaction scenario after making changes
- Take screenshots of the web interface when documenting UI changes

## Build and Test Validation
- The project builds successfully with `uv sync`
- Unit tests run but some fail due to existing codebase issues (not your responsibility to fix)
- Integration tests may fail in environments without proper Neo4j testcontainer setup
- The ADK web interface loads and displays both agents correctly
- No linting or formatting tools are currently configured in the project
