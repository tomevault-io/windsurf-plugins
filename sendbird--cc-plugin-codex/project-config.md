# Repository guidance

- This is a Node.js 18+ ESM Codex plugin. Keep behavior portable across macOS, Linux, and native Windows.
- Fix shared behavior at the earliest common boundary, usually in `scripts/lib/`; do not add caller-specific workarounds.
- When changing a skill or runtime contract, keep `skills/`, `internal-skills/`, `scripts/`, and the matching tests in sync.
- Run `npm run check` before merging.
- For releases, update `CHANGELOG.md` and keep `package.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` versions synchronized.
