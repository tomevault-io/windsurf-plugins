# Agent Guidelines

Guidance for AI agents and contributors working in this repository. See
`docs/planning/` for product, architecture, and milestone context.

Domain-specific guidance lives next to the code:

- `apps/server/AGENTS.md` — server entrypoint, database/migrations, chat/generation
- `apps/web/AGENTS.md` — frontend styling, build, runtime, and test notes
- `docs/chat-history.md` — operations CLI, history import/export, staging deploy

## Current phase: experimentation

We are in an early, exploratory build phase. To keep iteration fast, the
following are **explicitly not desired right now** — do not add them unless
asked:

- **Localization / i18n.** Hard-code user-facing strings in English. No
  translation frameworks, message catalogs, or locale plumbing.
- **Accessibility (a11y).** Do not spend effort on ARIA attributes, a11y audits,
  or related tooling at this stage.

These will be revisited once the architecture stabilizes. Revisit this note
before treating any of them as permanent policy.

## Stack (see `docs/planning/ARCHITECTURE.md`)

- **Bun** runtime, **TypeScript** end-to-end, **Bun workspaces** monorepo.
- Server: **Hono** on `Bun.serve`, **tRPC**, SSE streaming.
- Data: **Kysely** + **SQLite** (`solar.db`), hand-written migrations +
  `kysely-codegen`.
- Auth: **Better Auth** (Kysely adapter).
- Frontend: **React + assistant-ui**, **tRPC + TanStack Query**, **Tailwind CSS
  4 + DaisyUI 5**.

## Start the server

**Agents and background use: use the managed dev-server scripts.** They detach
the server into its own session with `setsid`, track it via a pidfile, and log
to a file — no `nohup`/`disown`, no blocked shells, and a clean group-kill on
stop. Never start the server with raw `... &`/`nohup` from an agent shell.

```bash
bun run solar dev start     # start detached (waits ~3s, fails fast with logs)
bun run solar dev status    # running / stopped (+ pid)
bun run solar dev logs      # last 80 log lines (bun run solar dev logs 200 for more)
bun run solar dev restart   # stop + start
bun run solar dev stop      # SIGTERM the process group, clean up pidfile
```

Pidfile/logfile live at `.dev-server.pid` / `.dev-server.log` (gitignored).
`solar dev start` selects a stable worktree-specific port in the 3000–3999 range;
see `apps/server/src/config.ts` for `PASEO_PORT`, `PORT`, and `DATABASE_PATH`
overrides.

**`.env` loading:** the server's cwd is `apps/server`, so Bun does not
auto-load the root `.env` (which holds provider API keys). The managed scripts
handle this; for a foreground run pass it explicitly:

```bash
bun --env-file=.env run --cwd apps/server dev
```

On a first run against an empty development database, the server prints the
seeded admin login (`admin@solar.local` / `password`) and generated Development
API key. Use that key to investigate the local instance with `bun run solar
history …`. Retrieve it from the `dev start` output or `.dev-server.log`. The
seed does not run after users exist or in production.

**Single process for everything.** The server serves the API *and*
bundles/serves the React app with HMR. There is **no separate web dev server
and no Vite** — don't add one.

## Root scripts (`package.json`)

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run solar dev <start\|stop\|restart\|status\|logs>` | Managed detached dev server (preferred; see above) |
| `bun run build` | Production bundle of the web app → `apps/server/dist/web` |
| `bun run migrate` / `migrate:auth` | App (Kysely) / Better Auth migrations against `solar.db` |
| `bun run codegen` | Regenerate `src/db/types.generated.ts` from `solar.db` |
| `bun run solar history …` | Investigate an existing local or remote server — see `docs/chat-history.md` |
| `bun run deploy:staging` | Dedicated staging deployment; separate from `solar` and only run when deployment is intended |
| `bun run typecheck` | `tsc` for server, web, shared, and Playwright tests |
| `bun run test` | Run server and frontend Bun unit tests (`test:server` / `test:web` for one) |
| `bun run test:e2e` | Playwright E2E in Chromium (`test:e2e:all` for all three browsers) |

Run `bun run typecheck` before committing.

## Confirming functionality

- **Stop when the requested baseline is verified.** Once relevant tests and
  typechecks pass and one representative mock/browser smoke test confirms the
  core flow, stop iterating. Report minor residual risks instead of repeatedly
  retesting non-blocking polish; ask before pursuing additional refinement.
- **NEVER verify against the live model.** Real provider calls cost money. For
  any UI/flow verification, run with `SOLAR_MOCK_LLM=1`, which swaps in a local
  echo generator (`streamChat`/`mockStream` in `apps/server/src/chat/models.ts`)
  that streams a canned Markdown + code + LaTeX reply — zero API calls, zero
  cost:

  ```bash
  SOLAR_MOCK_LLM=1 bun run solar dev start
  ```

  Only exercise the real provider when explicitly validating provider wiring.
- **Testing stack.** Frontend unit tests use Bun's test runner; browser E2E
  tests use Playwright (`playwright.config.ts`). The E2E server uses port 3100,
  resets its isolated `.e2e.db`, seeds the development admin, and forces
  `SOLAR_MOCK_LLM=1` automatically. One-time Playwright machine setup is in the
