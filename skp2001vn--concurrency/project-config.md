# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository contains small, focused Java concurrency examples used for practice, learning, and interview preparation.

Each example should remain:
- self-contained
- easy to read
- correct under concurrent access
- backed by automated tests

## Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Maven
- JUnit 5
- Lombok

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/org/example/<example>/`
  - production code for each concurrency example
- `src/test/java/org/example/<example>/`
  - tests for the matching example
- `README.md`
  - high-level project overview and example list

## Implementation Guidelines

- Keep each example package focused on one problem or concurrency pattern.
- Prefer clear, standard Java concurrency primitives such as:
  - `ReentrantLock`
  - `Condition`
  - `Semaphore`
  - `Atomic*`
  - `ConcurrentHashMap`
  - `BlockingQueue`
  - `ExecutorService`
- Favor correctness and readability over cleverness.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions for small examples.
- Keep APIs minimal and aligned with the problem being solved.
- Use descriptive class and method names. Prefer simple names like `WebCrawler` over overly specific or verbose names unless needed.
- Use Lombok selectively for simple boilerplate such as getters or constructors on data-holder classes.
- Do not use Lombok where it obscures concurrency behavior or makes synchronization logic harder to read.

## Javadoc Expectations

- Add class-level Javadoc for each example class.
- Add method-level Javadoc for public methods.
- Add concise Javadoc for each `@Test` method so future readers can quickly see the behavior or guarantee being verified.
- Class-level Javadoc for example classes should follow the current repository pattern:
  - start with `Business logic:` and describe the real-world/use-case behavior the example models
  - follow with `Technique:` and describe the concurrency primitive, pattern, or coordination strategy used, why it fits the problem, and the benefit it provides
- Javadoc should also explain:
  - important behavioral guarantees or constraints
- Keep Javadoc concise and practical. Avoid repeating obvious implementation details line by line.
- When Lombok generates simple constructors or getters, document the class and any non-generated public methods instead of recreating boilerplate manually.

## Testing Guidelines

- Every new example should include dedicated JUnit 5 tests.
- Tests should validate:
  - normal behavior
  - edge cases
  - concurrency coordination behavior
  - regressions around ordering, blocking, deduplication, or termination when relevant
- Add short, behavior-focused Javadoc above each test case rather than relying only on method names.
- Prefer deterministic tests over timing-sensitive tests.
- Use helper fakes/stubs where appropriate instead of external dependencies.
- After changes, run:

```bash
mvn test
```

## Code Style

- Follow the existing project style and keep formatting consistent.
- Prefer simple package layouts: one package per example.
- Keep comments minimal and high signal.
- Use ASCII unless the file already requires something else.
- Do not add unused code, unused imports, or speculative utilities.

## README Maintenance

- Update `README.md` when adding a new example.
- Keep the Implemented Examples section as a two-column table: `Example` and `What it demonstrates`.
- Link each example name to `src/main/java/org/example/<example>/`.
- In `What it demonstrates`, use one concise sentence that describes the business/use-case situation first, then the main technique with wording like `..., using <technical terms>`.
- Keep README technique wording short and concrete; prefer names like `Phaser`, `ReentrantLock`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, `Semaphore`, or `ExecutorService` over explanatory phrases.
- Do not split README entries into separate `Business logic` and `Technique` columns, and do not use `Business logic:` / `Technique:` labels in the README table.
- Keep the example list and test-count statement in sync with the current repository state.

## When Adding A New Example

1. Add production code under `src/main/java/org/example/<example>/`
2. Add tests under `src/test/java/org/example/<example>/`
3. Add Javadoc to public classes and methods, including the `Business logic:` and `Technique:` class-level pattern for example classes
4. Add concise Javadoc for each test case
5. Update `README.md` with the linked example name and a one-sentence business/use-case plus technique description
6. Run `mvn test`

## Non-Goals

- Do not turn this repository into a framework or reusable library unless explicitly requested.
- Do not introduce unnecessary dependencies for simple examples.
- Do not sacrifice clarity just to mimic highly optimized production code.
