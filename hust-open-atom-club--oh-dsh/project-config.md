# Scope

These rules apply repository-wide. A nested `AGENTS.md` may narrow them for
its subtree. Keep this file to durable rules; put explanations in `docs/`.

# Architecture

- Desktop, Web, and TUI are surfaces over one pinned DSH runtime, not separate
  products or plugin systems.
- `src/profile.ts` owns surface composition. Keep the full/Desktop, Web-only,
  and TUI-only package boundaries intact.
- `src/data-root.ts` owns shared state under `~/.ohdsh`. Use `OH_DSH_HOME` for
  overrides; do not invent another cache, credential, or configuration root.
- Load capabilities through the DSH Profile, Loader, and Cordis services. Do
  not add a second loader or bypass its permission boundary.
- Keep Files, PTY, Git, and Browser access scoped to the active Session and
  Workspace. Electron-only capabilities must remain Desktop-only.
- Treat `upstream/` as pinned source. Adapt upstream behavior in `plugins/`,
  retain attribution, and preserve the Oh-DSH UI and contracts.
- `@oh-dsh/skins` owns shared theme identities across all surfaces. Surface
  adapters may change rendering, not theme ownership.
- Human and Agent marketplace actions use the same preview, approval, apply,
  and recovery transaction.
- Derive displayed versions from the repository version resolver. Do not
  duplicate versions, platform paths, executable names, or data roots.
- Make user-state migrations non-destructive, restart-safe, and idempotent.
- Preserve macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64, and Windows x64 behavior.

See `docs/design.en.md` and `docs/design.md` for detailed boundaries.

# Repository map

- `src/`: launchers, runtime supervision, profiles, and shared data.
- `plugins/`: built-in capability providers and surface adapters.
- `upstream/`: pinned third-party submodules.
- `scripts/`: build, staging, packaging, and smoke checks.
- `tests/`: reusable contract and regression tests.
- `docs/`: bilingual design and operating documentation.
- `.agents/`: agent skills and the Agent Notes decision record (`notes/`).

# Change rules

- Inspect status, local instructions, consumers, and public contracts first.
- Prefer the smallest coherent diff. Preserve unrelated user changes.
- Use existing services and shared contracts before adding state or helpers.
- Invoke `$simplify` for behavior-preserving cleanup, deduplication, dead-code
  removal, or model reduction.
- Do not edit generated output in `dist/`, `.stage/`, `release/`, or caches.
- Do not weaken `.npmrc`, lockfile, provenance, or release safety policies.
- Update both language variants when user-facing documentation changes.
- Add tests only for reusable, non-trivial contracts or regressions.
- Run `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm run build` when code changes.
  Run the relevant surface smoke or package check for runtime changes.

# Agent Notes

- A non-trivial change MUST add or update an Agent Note in the same PR; only a
  purely mechanical or local edit is exempt. An Agent Note records the
  decision, the alternatives it rejected, and the consequences — the parts
  code and docs cannot carry (see
  [when to write one](.agents/notes/README.md#when-to-write-one)).
- Follow the lifecycle and file format in
  [.agents/notes/README.md](.agents/notes/README.md): `proposed/` for unbuilt
  proposals, `implemented/` for shipped decisions kept current with what
  shipped, `rejected/` for declined proposals. A decision already made starts
  in `implemented/`.
- Use [dsh-find-simplifications](.agents/skills/dsh-find-simplifications/SKILL.md)
  when a change removes or collapses surface area, and
  [dsh-archive-agent-notes](.agents/skills/dsh-archive-agent-notes/SKILL.md)
  when an implemented note is unlikely to guide future work.
- Archived notes under `.agents/notes/archived/` are frozen snapshots: never
  edit, move, translate, or delete them, and do not treat them as authority
  for current behavior.

# Commits and contributions

- Write commits, PR titles, PR bodies, and review replies in English.
- Keep each commit atomic and use exactly `<module>: <subject>`: a lowercase
  module prefix, a colon and space, then an imperative subject. The module is
  the area the commit changes (`marketplace`, `web`, `terminal`, `docs`,
  `license`, `release`, ...), never a conventional-commit type. Do not write
  `fix: ...`, `feat: ...`, or `fix(scope): ...` subjects; when a commit
  touches several areas, use the primary module. PR titles follow the same
  format.
  Valid:   `marketplace: make preview cleanup junction-safe on Windows`
  Invalid: `fix(marketplace): make preview cleanup junction-safe on Windows`
- Include a body explaining why and impact. Keep every body line at most 72
  characters.
- An optional `Assisted-by: <tool>` trailer may disclose AI assistance. It
  must not identify a fictional person and is never required.
- Preserve upstream licenses, notices, links, and downstream attribution.
- In PRs, state scope and verification, link related issues, and resolve
  actionable review and CI failures before merge.

# Audit workflow

For every non-trivial task that writes to the workspace, choose a stable task
slug and keep agent-only records under:

```text
.agent-workflows/<agent-task>/
