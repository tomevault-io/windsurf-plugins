# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when
working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

```sh
make          # Incremental release build via xcodebuild → build/Luma.app
make clean    # Remove build artifacts
```

Or open `Luma.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build with Cmd+B (set
destination to **My Mac**).

`LumaCore` (the cross-platform Swift package) can be built and
type-checked on Linux without Xcode:

```sh
swift build --target LumaCore
```

There are no tests or linting commands. Code formatting follows
`.swift-format` (4-space indent, 140-char line length).

Avoid "headline comments" that narrate what the next block does.
Prefer aptly named variables and functions to make code
self-explanatory. Only add comments as a last resort, for
non-obvious *why* (hidden constraints, workarounds).

## Architecture

Luma is an interactive dynamic instrumentation app built on
[Frida](https://frida.re). All business logic lives in **LumaCore**,
a portable Swift package. The current shipping frontend is a macOS
SwiftUI app; a GTK/Adwaita frontend for Linux can be added against
the same `LumaCore`.

### Two-process model

1. **Host (Swift)** — owns the UI, persistence, and Frida session
   lifecycle (via `LumaCore`).
2. **Agent (TypeScript)** — compiled JS injected into the target
   process via Frida. Exposes RPC methods for instrumentation, REPL
   evaluation, memory access, and symbolication.

The agent entry point is `Agent/core/luma.ts`, which re-exports all
RPC methods from sibling modules. Agent source is compiled and
embedded into `Sources/LumaCore/Generated/LumaAgent.swift` by the
`LumaBundleCompiler` build tool target. The `Generated/` directory
is gitignored — it is produced at build time.

### LumaCore (`Sources/LumaCore/`)

- **`Engine`** — central `@Observable @MainActor` class. Owns the
  `DeviceManager`, all `ProcessNode` instances, the event log,
  `CollaborationSession`, `GitHubAuth`, `HookPackLibrary`, the
  `Disassembler` cache, address annotations, the descriptor
  registry, and the address-action provider list. Single public
  entry point: `start()` (called from the host once at launch).
- **`ProcessNode`** — represents one attached process. Holds the
  Frida `Session` + `Script`, loaded modules, and `InstrumentRef`s.
  Exposes `AsyncStream` event sources (events, REPL results, ITrace
  captures, module snapshots, detach events).
- **`EventLog`** — `@Observable` ring buffer with batched 16ms
  flushing. Frontends read `events` / `totalReceived` directly via
  Observation; no mirror in the host.
- **`Disassembler` / `TraceDisassembler`** — concrete `@MainActor`
  classes wrapping `R2Core` for live and trace disassembly. Both
  return portable `DisassemblyLine` / `StyledText` (RGB-spans, no
  AppKit/SwiftUI dependency). Frontends ship a tiny extension to
  convert `StyledText` into their preferred styled-text type.
- **`HookPackLibrary`** — discovers hook packs from a directory and
  produces `InstrumentDescriptor`s. Engine owns one rooted at
  `dataDirectory/HookPacks`.
- **`AddressAction` / `ThreadAction`** — pluggable per-address and
  per-thread action providers. The tracer registers itself at engine
  init; future instrument kinds can call
  `engine.registerAddressActionProvider` /
  `registerThreadActionProvider`. `AddressContext` (kind: code /
  function / data) lets providers tailor actions per call site.
- **Persistence (GRDB / SQLite)** — `.luma` is a directory document
  containing `db.sqlite` and `traces/<uuid>.bin`. `ProjectStore` owns
  the database with row models for `ProcessSession`,
  `InstrumentInstance`, `REPLCell`, `NotebookEntry`, `ITrace` (metadata
  only; data lives in `TraceStore`), `AddressInsight`,
  `RemoteDeviceConfig`, `ProjectPackagesState`, `InstalledPackage`,
  `ProjectCollaborationState`, `TargetPickerState`, plus UI-state
  singletons `ProjectUIState` and per-session `SessionUIState`.
  Schema is created with `if not exists` on every open; pre-release,
  no migrations.
- **`TraceStore`** — file-backed blob store for raw ITrace data.
  Engine routes reads through `loadTraceData(traceID:sessionID:expectedSize:)`,
  which checks live in-memory pending state, then the local file,
