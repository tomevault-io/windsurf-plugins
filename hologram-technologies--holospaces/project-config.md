# AGENTS.md — holospaces

This file is **timeless** orientation: durable facts about UOR, Hologram, and holospaces concepts, and how we work. **It contains no status** — nothing that goes stale (no progress, no crate inventories, no "current state"). The **authoritative specification** is the documentation under [`docs/`](docs/) — architecture, conceptual model, and lifecycle (start at [docs/docs-definition.md](docs/docs-definition.md)). Every implemented feature and workspace artifact must link back to it; this file is orientation, not a second source of truth.

## What holospaces is

holospaces is a UOR-native **boot layer** over the hologram substrate. It provisions and runs **holospaces** — bootable, content-addressed environments — and ships **Hologram**, the first-party holospace whose console (the **Platform Manager**) manages the rest. For the dev-environment use case it is a UOR-native, serverless Gitpod/Codespaces.

## The stack it builds on

holospaces consumes these by reference; their APIs and internals are authoritative in their own repositories (linked), never restated here.

- [UOR Framework](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/UOR-Framework) — the formal UOR model.
- [Prism](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/prism) / `uor-foundation` — the UOR substrate + standard library.
- [UOR-ADDR](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-addr) — content addressing: a **κ-label** is `<axis>:<hex>` = `H(canonical_form)`.
- [hologram](https://github.com/Hologram-Technologies/hologram) — the substrate holospaces runs on: content-addressed storage, networking, runtime, and a `.holo` executor.

## Concepts every contributor must know

- **κ-label / canonical form** — identity is content (*what*, not *where*).
- **The substrate** — hologram's content-addressed storage, network, and runtime, plus its `.holo` executor; see [hologram](https://github.com/Hologram-Technologies/hologram).
- **Two compute forms** — a Wasm code module (general/system code) or a tensor `.holo` (compute); both run by hologram, both κ-addressed.
- **holospace** — the bootable, κ-addressed unit; provisioned from a holo-file or a devcontainer; managed by the Manager.
- **peer** — an environment (browser / native / bare-metal) that *becomes* the substrate by running a holospace.
- **operator / sign-in** — a self-sovereign identity that syncs an operator's holospaces across instances (not a server account).

## The laws (non-negotiable)

1. **Content, not location** — no servers; no host/path/URL as identity.
2. **Canonical forms only** — operate on canonical forms; hold κ, not objects; canonicalize at the ingest boundary.
3. **The store is the memory** — `KappaStore` is the address space; RAM is a cache.
4. **Everything through the substrate** — no parallel memory/storage/network/runtime.
5. **Verify by re-derivation** — re-derive every received byte against its κ.

## How we work

- **The docs are authoritative.** The specification under `docs/` (arc42 chapters, ADRs in chapter 09, the OPM conceptual model, the ISO 15288 lifecycle) is the **single source of truth**, maintained **without gaps, inconsistencies, or assumptions**. It precedes code, and **every implemented feature and part of the workspace links back to it**.
- **V&V by external ground truth — never self-reference.** Validate against **imported external artifacts**: e.g. native `hologram-exec` outputs as the oracle for the browser engine; the substrate TCK; σ-axis KAT vectors. Imported artifacts are themselves κ-addressed and verified on import.
- **Behavior-driven: the spec is written first.** Every capability is a Conformance row (`CC-*`) in the catalog (arc42 chapter 10), each realizing a process in the OPM conceptual model ([docs/Conceptual-Model.md](docs/Conceptual-Model.md)). A row that is `live` has a green witness in [`vv/suites/`](vv/suites/). **Unfinished work is not narrated — it is encoded** as a *target*: a `CC-*` row marked *target* whose behavioral V&V is written **before** the implementation as an expected-RED suite in [`vv/targets/`](vv/targets/). To find the remaining work, read the *target* rows and run `vv/run.sh` (the target tier lists them). This is how an agent knows what to build and what "done" means — never by inferring state from code or chat.
- **Finish what you start; no LLM half-measures.** Build a target until its suite is green, then **promote** it from `vv/targets/` to `vv/suites/` and turn its row `live`. Never leave a stub, no-op, fallback, placeholder, or partial path; never mark a row `live` without its external witness; never claim parity the V&V does not show. A target whose analysis shows it is **not required** is removed (with the reasoning recorded in the spec), not built. The end state is the GitHub Pages deployment fully realizing the conceptual model, gated green by V&V before deploy.
