{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

## Environment

conda activate {{ENV_NAME}}
```
- Python {{PYTHON_VERSION}}
- PyTorch {{TORCH_VERSION}} (CUDA {{CUDA_VERSION}})
- Key deps: (run /env-setup refresh to fill)
- Tracking: wandb, tensorboard
- GPU: {{GPU_INFO}}

### Dataset Paths
<!-- Filled by /init-project update after WF4 -->

## Tech Stack
<!-- Filled by /init-project update after WF2 -->

## Project Structure
<!-- Filled by /init-project update after WF6 -->

## Core Artifacts
- `PROJECT_STATE.json` — Stage progression (single source of truth for stages)
- `iteration_log.json` — Experiment history (single source of truth for iterations)
- `project_map.json` — Code architecture (single source of truth for structure, stable files only)
- `.auto_iterate/` — Controller-owned runtime state (if auto-iterate is enabled; do not edit manually)

## Language Policy
- `interaction_language`: Match the language of the latest substantive user input unless the user explicitly requests another language.
- `artifact_language`: Use the same language as `interaction_language` for natural-language sections in generated docs and reports unless the user asks otherwise.
- Keep file names, paths, commands, code identifiers, JSON/YAML keys, schema fields, workflow IDs, metric keys, and placeholder tokens in English.
- Treat English wording in templates and examples as structural guidance only; localize headings and narrative text unless a field is explicitly marked English-only.

## Entry Scripts
<!-- Filled by /init-project update after WF7 first run -->
<!-- Core entry scripts are locked here after first successful training -->

## Global Rule: project_map.json Maintenance
Only **stable architecture files** (src/, baselines/, core configs/scripts) are tracked in project_map.json.
Volatile experiment assets (per-iteration scripts/configs) are not tracked.
See `.agents/references/project-map-rule.md` for detailed rules.

## Challenge Quick Ref

- Competition: {{COMPETITION_URL}}
- Dataset paper: {{DATASET_PAPER_URL}}
- Baseline code: {{BASELINE_CODE_URL}}
- Metrics: {{METRICS}}
- Data format: {{DATA_FORMAT}}
- Deadline: {{DEADLINE}}

## Workflow
WF1(survey) -> WF2(arch) -> WF3(check) -> WF4(data) -> WF5(baseline) -> WF6(plan) -> WF7(code) -> WF7.5(validate) -> WF8(iterate) -> WF9(final-exp) -> WF10(release)
WF8 iteration loop: $iterate plan -> $iterate code -> $iterate run -> $iterate eval -> (NEXT_ROUND->repeat | DEBUG->debug round | CONTINUE->WF9 | PIVOT->WF2 | ABORT->stop)
Current stage: WF1 (not started)

## Custom
### Codex MCP
- When calling `mcp__codex__codex`, **do not pass the `model` parameter**. The user's `~/.codex/config.toml` has a custom provider configured; passing any model override causes 503 errors.
