# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository layout

```
composer.json, src/, config/, database/, resources/, routes/   the package itself
Docs/                                                          the spec
example/                                                       a Laravel 13 app for testing
```

**The package lives at the repository root**, because Composer and Packagist read `composer.json` from there. It was moved out of `packages/filament-atelier/` on 15 Aug for exactly that reason; nothing could install it while it sat in a subdirectory.

`example/` is a throwaway host app, not a deliverable. It installs the package through a composer path repository pointing at `..`, so it symlinks and an edit is live with no reinstall. Its 26 tests are the project's test suite for now.

`.gitattributes` export-ignores `example/` and `Docs/`, so `composer require` pulls the package and nothing else.

Only touch `example/` to set up a test scenario or to reproduce something.

## Status

MVP, working and installable. Blocks, the builder, page settings, SEO and public pages all run. `Docs/features.md` lists what exists, `Docs/installation.md` covers putting it on a project and the known limits. Feature 01 in `Docs/tasks/` is done and records what the preview spike proved.

## Stack

PHP 8.3+, Laravel 13, Filament, Livewire 4, Alpine 3, Tailwind 4, GSAP 3.15. Shipped as a composer package `safi/filament-atelier` that installs into a client's Laravel app.

No page-builder dependency. Atelier owns the page model, slug resolution, front-end routing and layout resolution. Fabricator was dropped on 15 Aug 2026, and the reasoning (plus a correction of two false claims made against it) is in `prd.md` under "Why not Fabricator". Leaf libraries that solve one problem without shaping the architecture, like `ralphjsmit/laravel-seo` and `spatie/laravel-sitemap`, are still welcome.

Because there's no upstream skeleton, Filament version tracking is ours. Keep the surface touching Filament internals small and concentrated.

## Document precedence

Read in this order. Later documents override earlier ones and say so in a banner at the top.

1. `Docs/prd.md` — current spec, v2, the authority. Five decisions from 14 Aug 2026.
2. `Docs/tasks/` — the work breakdown, one file per feature in build order. `tasks/README.md` is the index.
3. `Docs/architecture.md` — technical design from 22 June. **Partly superseded.** Its banner lists what's dead: the Builder-field editor, single-locale storage, the slug column. Its Phasing section and its Builder-field recommendation are explicitly marked reversed. Everything else in it still holds.
4. `Docs/research/` — four background briefs (Gutenberg block model, Elementor architecture, Filament plugin development, preview/drafts/GSAP/SEO). Source material, not decisions.

`Docs/quick-win-options.md` is about shipping a client on stock Fabricator while this gets built. It is not about this build and its recommendation was reversed for Atelier on 15 Aug 2026.

## The architecture in one pass

**A page is a JSON tree of typed blocks, rendered by Blade at request time.** Gutenberg's data model, Elementor's render approach, neither one's baggage. Gutenberg stores rendered HTML and pays for it with attribute sourcing, block validation and deprecation chains. We skip all three by storing structured JSON and treating every block as dynamic.

**A block type is one PHP class plus one Blade view.** The class declares `type()`, `label()`, `icon()`, `category()`, `schema()` and `supports()`. `schema()` returns a plain Filament schema, which is why the whole control system comes free. Registered at boot into a `BlockRegistry`. Adding a block must never require editing a file inside the plugin.

**Three tables carry the model:** `pages` with `draft_content` and `published_content` as separate JSON columns, `page_slugs` (locale, slug, unique) because a JSON slug map can't carry a unique index, and `page_revisions` for snapshots. Editing writes the draft. Publishing copies draft to published. The public route reads published only.

**Translatable attributes hold a per-locale map inside the same tree**, not separate trees per language:

```json
"heading": { "en": "Welcome", "ar": "أهلا بك" }
```

One structure, one section order, translated text. Arabic mirrors via `dir="rtl"` and CSS logical properties. The accepted cost is that Arabic cannot have a different section order from English.

**Design tokens are stored as references, not literals** (`{ "token": "color.primary" }`), emitted as CSS custom properties, and read by both the editor preview and the public page. This is what keeps the preview honest.

## Non-negotiables

These are decisions with reasons behind them, not preferences. Changing one means reopening the PRD.

- **The public render is always Blade SSR.** Never inject blocks client-side. The whole SEO argument rests on this.
- **The preview and the public page share one render path.** Same Blade views, same layout, same stylesheet, different data source. A second rendering path for the editor defeats the point of the preview.
