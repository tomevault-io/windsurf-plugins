# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repo.

> **Read `AGENTS.md` first.** This is Next.js 16 — APIs and conventions differ from older versions. Check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing framework code.

## What this is

SystemForge — an open-source system-design interview simulator. Drag infrastructure components onto a React Flow canvas, wire them, simulate production-scale traffic (Kahn's topological sort), and get scored across 5 interview dimensions. 100% client-side; state persists to `localStorage`. No backend.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build    # production build — also runs tsc; must pass before pushing
npm run lint     # eslint
npx tsc --noEmit # type-check only
```

There are no unit tests; verify changes by building and exercising flows in the browser.

## Tech stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, single static `/` route) · React 19 · TypeScript · @xyflow/react v12 (ReactFlow) · Zustand v5 (persisted) · Tailwind v4 · base-ui dialogs/primitives · framer-motion · perfect-freehand (pen) · html-to-image (export). No new runtime deps without good reason.

## Key invariants — don't break these

**Simulation engine (`engine/simulator.ts`).** Called as `runSimulation(componentNodes, allEdges, requestsPerSec)` — text nodes are filtered out but ALL edges are passed, so edges may reference non-component nodes; the engine must skip edges whose source/target isn't a known component node. Entry nodes = in-degree 0 **with** outgoing edges (a fully disconnected node is NOT an entry and must not receive traffic). Sanitize `maxQPS`/`replicas` (finite, positive) before use. Reported throughput never exceeds offered load. Async edges (`edge.data.async`) are excluded from user-facing latency. LBs split traffic evenly; other nodes fan out 100% to each child (intentional).

**Scoring (`scoring/`).** `scorer.ts` builds a shared `ScoringGraph` (cleaned adjacency + reachable-from-entry set) once and passes it to every rule. Presence checks must require reachability — placing a component without wiring it earns no points (with feedback saying so). Each category rule must total **exactly 20** max and never go negative; verify the arithmetic if you touch a rule.

**Stores (`store/`).** Every persisted store uses `version: 1`, `skipHydration: true`, a no-op `migrate`, and `safeLocalStorage` (from `safeStorage.ts`, swallows QuotaExceeded + toasts). Hydration is deferred: `hydration.ts` exports `rehydrateAllStores()` and `useHasHydrated()` — call after mount to avoid SSR mismatch. `canvasStore` persists the active tab with empty nodes/edges (live copies live at the top level; reconstructed on rehydrate) and strips runtime fields (`utilization`/`status`/`isBottleneck`). It also has unpersisted undo/redo history (`undo`/`redo`/`canUndo`/`canRedo`, 50 entries, pushed before mutation) and `deleteEdge(id)`. `interviewStore` timer is timestamp-based (`startedAt`/`accumulatedMs`) so it survives background-tab throttling and refresh — never reintroduce tick-counting.

**Persistence schema.** `SerializedEdge` must carry `data` (label/protocol/async) or edge metadata is lost on save/load. Export/import use a unified envelope `{ schemaVersion, name, problemId, nodes, edges, strokes }`; `importDesign` validates structurally and returns `{ ok, error? }`.

**Canvas/UI.** `nodeTypes`/`edgeTypes` are module-level (never inline — causes remounts). Reference tabs (`tab.readOnly`) must gate dragging/connecting/dropping/delete. Keyboard shortcuts must no-op while typing in inputs; there is one delete path (`deleteKeyCode={null}` on ReactFlow + the AppShell handler covering node AND edge selection). Dialogs go through `ModalShell`. Touch: hover-only affordances are invisible on coarse pointers (Tailwind v4 gates `hover:` behind `@media(hover:hover)`) — gate visibility on `useIsCoarsePointer()` instead.
