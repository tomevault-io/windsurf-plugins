# AGENTS.md

The role of this file is to describe common mistakes and confusion points that agents might encounter as they work on this project. If you even encounter something in the project that surprises or confuses you, please alert the developer and indicate that this is the case in this file to help future agents from having the same issue.

## Maintenance

When changing public-facing APIs in publishable packages, update that package's `README.md` if there is any outdated information.

Do not update package READMEs for backend-only/internal implementation details that do not change package usage, public API, or consumer-facing behavior.

When exposing a new subpath/module that is not already re-exported by an existing entry module, update both:

- `tsup.config.ts` `entry` list in that package (controls what gets built into `dist/*`)
- `package.json#exports` for the new public import path

Do not update only one side. Publishable packages run `check-export-map` in their build scripts, so export map and built outputs must stay aligned.

Expectations for updates:

- Prefer small, precise edits over broad rewrites.
- Keep guidance implementation-anchored (point to concrete files/functions).
- Record facts, not speculation; verify against source before adding.
- Do not add one-off or easily discoverable workflow observations; only document recurring, non-obvious gotchas that are likely to surprise future agents.
- If a discrepancy is uncertain, add it as a clearly-labeled “Open Question” instead of asserting it as fact.
- Do not remove older guidance unless it is confirmed obsolete or incorrect.
- For example package READMEs, avoid duplicating script-level command details that are already defined in `package.json`; keep README text focused on what the example demonstrates.

## Formatting Requirement

After any repository change (including Markdown/docs), agents must run Prettier from the repository root using pnpm before finishing work.

Required command:

- `pnpm format:fix`

Expectations:

- Run formatting after each set of edits and again before handoff if additional edits occurred.
- Treat formatting as mandatory, not optional.

## Lint Requirement

Before handoff, agents must run linting from the repository root:

- `pnpm lint`

If lint reports fixable ESLint issues, agents should automatically apply fixes and rerun lint:

- `pnpm -r --if-present lint -- --fix`
- `pnpm lint`

Do not hand off while lint is failing unless blocked by an explicit environment/tooling issue; in that case, report the exact blocking error and attempted fix commands.

## Worktree Dependency Setup

Agent sessions commonly run in fresh git worktrees where dependencies are not installed yet, and within a sandbox that does not have network access.

Required near the start of each workflow (before any other `pnpm` command):

- `pnpm install --offline`

Also rerun `pnpm install --offline` after changing any workspace `package.json`, adding/removing packages, or changing package `bin`/exports wiring, so workspace links and `.bin` shims are refreshed before validation.

## Sandbox Environment

You're running in a sandboxed environment. If you encounter network connectivity issues (such as with `pnpm install` without `--offline`), prompt the developer to run necessary commands for you to continue rather than attempting network operations that may fail.

## Monorepo Layout

A pnpm & turbo monorepo is used in this repository.

Keep the following list up to date when introducing any new packages:

- `/packages/build-utils`: reusable ArcaneJS build helpers, including CLI/API utilities for project build workflows.
- `/packages/toolkit`: core server runtime, component classes, HTTP/WS server, frontend bootstrap entrypoint.
- `/packages/react-toolkit`: custom React reconciler that renders JSX into `@arcanejs/toolkit` component instances.
- `/packages/toolkit-frontend`: browser React components that render protocol nodes and send user events back.
- `/packages/protocol`: shared message/component TypeScript contracts.
- `/packages/diff`: JSON diff/patch used to sync tree changes efficiently.
- `/examples/*`: various example packages
- `/apps/docs`: Next.js sandbox/simulator for rendering components without live WS.

## Changesets (Required for Package Code Changes)

This repo uses Changesets for release notes and version bumps. Agents must keep `.changeset` entries accurate so release cuts bump all affected versions.

When to add a changeset:

- Add one for code changes in publishable packages.
- Do not add a changeset for changes limited to docs, formatting, CI, or example/apps-only changes.
- Do not add a changeset for private config packages unless explicitly requested (e.g. `@arcanejs/eslint-config`).

How to create it:

1. Run `pnpm changeset` after making package code changes.
2. Select every changed publishable package.
3. Choose bump level based on impact:
   - `patch`: bug fixes, internal refactors, non-breaking behavior changes.
