# MeshCore Signed Plugin Release Flow

When the user provides a signed plugin zip path (TPC/TAK Signed) for **MeshCore**:

1. Verify `main` is current and pushed on `atakmaps/TAK-MESHCORE`.
2. Inspect the zip and extract the signed APK (`ATAK-Plugin-Meshcore-*-tpc-5.5.1-civ-release.apk`).
3. Validate APK: `package: com.atakmaps.meshcore.plugin`, `versionCode` / `versionName` match release intent.
4. Create/push tag `v<version>` on the release commit; create GitHub Release on **TAK-MESHCORE** with signed APK, AAB, and `MeshCore-*-ATAK-5.5.1-source.zip`.
5. **Do not** deploy to `com.uvpro.plugin.apk` — that is UV-PRO only.
6. If publishing to atakmaps.com: add/update a **separate** `generate_infz.py` plugin row for `com.atakmaps.meshcore.plugin` (canonical APK `com.atakmaps.meshcore.plugin.apk`), regenerate `product.infz`, mirror `5.5.1/`, verify URLs return 200.
7. Report release URL, SHA256, and deployed catalog version (if any).

Prefer explicit verification over assumptions.
