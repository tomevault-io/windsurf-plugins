## **HOW TO USE THIS WITH CODEX**

### **When starting a new flow:**

```
You: "Read agents.md and follow those rules. Now create an Instagram story scheduler flow that posts at optimal times."

Codex: [reads agents.md]
       [creates flow definition with proper structure]
       [adds state management with locking]
       [implements retry logic]
       [adds rate limiting]
       [generates tests]
       [adds observability]
       [runs smoke test]
       "Done. All 18 rules satisfied."
```

### **When reviewing Codex's output:**

Check against agents.md:
- ✓ Flow has tests? (Rule 1)
- ✓ State management is atomic? (Rule 2)
- ✓ Error recovery implemented? (Rule 4)
- ✓ Rate limiting respected? (Rule 6)
- ✓ Observability added? (Rule 10)
- ✓ Security checked? (Rule 17)

If all yes -> Ship it.

## **WHAT THIS PREVENTS**

Based on your "goof ups" pattern, this prevents:

### **In social-CLI you had:**
- Tests drift from behavior
- Package bloat
- Handoff sprawl

### **In social-flow you'll prevent:**
- **State corruption** (Rule 2: atomic operations, locking)
- **Race conditions** (Rule 5: agent coordination)
- **Lost data** (Rule 4: error recovery, state persistence)
- **Rate limit violations** (Rule 6: quota tracking)
- **Undebuggable failures** (Rule 10: observability)
- **Security breaches** (Rule 17: credential handling)

These are the failure modes of **flow systems**, not CLI tools.

---

## **ADD THIS TO SOCIAL-FLOW REPO**

```bash
cd /path/to/social-flow
cp agents-social-flow.md agents.md
git add agents.md
git commit -m "Add agent operating rules for flow quality enforcement"
git push
```

Now every time you work with Codex on social-flow:

1. Start with: "Read agents.md and follow those rules"
2. Codex generates quality code automatically
3. You validate behavior, not quality

**Zero infrastructure. Just specification.**

---

**This is the right agents.md for social-flow.** It's tailored to the specific challenges of workflow systems, not CLI tools.

## **PRODUCT ROADMAP (DRAFT, CONTEXT-SIZED PHASES)**

### **Phase 1: Token UX Quick Wins (1-2 sessions)**
1. WhatsApp token hint deep-link + auto-open fallback (already started).
2. Clear “copy/paste token” CTA copy in CLI + TUI.
3. Add a short “Troubleshooting: token not found” hint.

### **Phase 2: Onboarding Flow Slice (1-2 sessions)**
1. Start screen: `Connect WhatsApp`, `Run Doctor`, `Send Test Message`.
2. Single-screen summary of what’s missing (token, WABA ID, phone ID).
3. “Fix now” links for each missing item.

### **Phase 3: WABA Doctor Slice (1-2 sessions)**
1. Make missing scopes/phone ID actionable with precise steps.
2. Add optional test message prompt.
3. Tighten error display for Meta API failures.

### **Phase 4: Agentic TUI Core Slice (2-3 sessions)**
1. Persistent status bar (profile, token, WABA, webhook).
2. OK/FAIL/SKIP badges everywhere.
3. “Fix with agent” for at least 1 failure case (token missing).

### **Phase 5: Reliability Slice (1-2 sessions)**
1. Retry + backoff on transient Meta API failures.
2. Sandbox vs Production confirmation for send actions.
3. Token expiry warnings when close to expiration.

### **Phase 6: Scale Slice (2-3 sessions)**
1. Multi-profile “agency mode” basics (switch + summary).
2. Minimal readiness dashboard per profile.
3. Metrics summary (success/fail counts + last error).

### **Definition of Done (Global)**
1. Each slice ships with tests for happy + expected failure.
2. Every user-facing error includes exact fix steps.
3. No token or secret is logged or persisted in plaintext logs.
4. Docs and CLI help updated for any new flow.

---

## **NEXT SESSIONS ACTION LIST**
1. Studio session: design the onboarding + token capture + guided menu flow (non-technical UX).
2. TUI: add setup progress meter (0–100) with step labels.
3. TUI: polish friendly error suggestions order + copy tone.
4. TUI: workspace carousel view (one panel per workspace).
5. CLI: add `support bundle` command to export diagnostic pack to a file.
6. Docs: update `AGENTS.md` + README with latest hotkeys and flows.
7. QA: run fresh user path (no config) and remove friction points.

## **NEXT SESSION: STUDIO PLAN**
1. Onboarding landing with 3 big choices: `Connect WhatsApp`, `Run Doctor`, `Send Test Message`.
2. Token capture screen with plain-language steps and inline validation.
3. Guided menu as visual cards (no command text).
4. One-screen "What’s missing" summary (token, WABA ID, phone ID).
5. One-click "Fix now" actions per missing item.
6. Confirmation + success screen with suggested next step.

## **ADS INTELLIGENCE ROADMAP (BORROW THE WORKFLOW, NOT THE RUNTIME)**

### **Why This Exists**
1. Social Flow should absorb the best ideas from `meta-ads-kit` without inheriting its runtime assumptions.
2. The value to steal is the operator workflow:
   `briefing -> winners/losers -> fatigue -> budget suggestions -> copy generation -> upload -> approval`.
3. Build it as a Social Flow vertical, not as a separate sidecar product.

### **Phase A: Ads Read-Only Intelligence (1-2 sessions)**
1. Add an `Ads Overview` surface in chat + control UI.
2. Show daily pacing, active campaigns, top spenders, and 7-day trend summary.
3. Add first-pass heuristics:
