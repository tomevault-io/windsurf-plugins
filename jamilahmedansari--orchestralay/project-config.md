# AGENTS.md — OrchestraLay architecture reference

This is the authoritative architecture document for any AI agent or developer working in this codebase. Read this before reading source files.

## What OrchestraLay does

OrchestraLay accepts AI task requests (code generation, debugging, refactoring, analysis, review) from developers via a CLI or REST API. It routes each task to the best available model using a 6-gate decision engine considering cost, health, and task type. It executes the task with automatic failover if a model fails. It runs every proposed code change through a safety layer that computes unified diffs and checks for dangerous operations. It presents results to developers for explicit approval before anything touches their filesystem. Every model call is logged with exact token counts and costs.

The product targets developers on Replit, Vercel, and similar platforms who suffer from two problems: unpredictable AI agent costs and agents that make breaking changes. OrchestraLay solves both.

## Data flow — task submission to file change on disk

```
Developer CLI/SDK
  │
  POST /trpc/tasks.submit (Authorization: Bearer olay_xxx)
  │
  ├─ resolveAuth() → hash token → lookup api_keys → ApiKeyAuth context
  ├─ enforceRateLimit(keyId)             ← throws if over per_minute or per_day
  ├─ enforceBudget(projectId, teamId)    ← throws if team monthly cap exceeded
  ├─ INSERT tasks (status='submitted')
  ├─ queue.send('orchestrate-task', payload)   ← fire and forget
  └─ return { taskId, realtimeChannel: 'task:<id>' }

Developer subscribes to Supabase Realtime channel 'task:<id>'

pg-boss picks up job (teamSize:5, teamConcurrency:3)
  │
  ├─ UPDATE tasks status='routing'
  ├─ broadcastTaskUpdate → Realtime → dashboard updates
  ├─ estimateTokens(prompt)
  ├─ resolveModel(input)          ← 6-gate decision (see below)
  │     reasoning[] stored in tasks.metadata
  ├─ UPDATE tasks status='executing', store routing decision
  ├─ broadcastTaskUpdate with modelName
  │
  ├─ [retry loop]
  │   callModel({ model, prompt, taskType, abortSignal: AbortSignal.timeout(ms) })
  │   │
  │   ├─ success path:

  │   │   INSERT model_results (tokens, cost, content)
  │   │   INSERT cost_logs
  │   │   UPDATE teams SET current_month_spend_cents = current_month_spend_cents + X
  │   │   break loop
  │   │
  │   └─ failure path:
  │       recordFailure(model)             ← may open circuit breaker
  │       INSERT failed model_result
  │       broadcastTaskUpdate 'trying next model...'
  │       resolveFailover() → next candidate or null
  │       if null: UPDATE tasks status='failed', broadcast, return
  │
  ├─ runDiffEngine(taskId, modelResultId, content, projectId)
  │   ├─ parseModelOutput(content)         ← extract <file_changes> XML
  │   ├─ for each ParsedFileOperation:

  │   └─ broadcastTaskUpdate with diff summary
  │
  ├─ UPDATE tasks status='completed'
  ├─ broadcastTaskUpdate status='completed', costCents
  └─ emitEvent('task.completed', payload)  ← fire and forget to n8n

Developer sees diff preview in dashboard or via CLI status
  │
  diffs.approve(diffId)      ← blocked=true cannot be approved here
  │
  CLI: orchestralay apply --task-id <id>
  │
  ├─ diffs.getForTask(taskId)         ← fetch approved, non-applied diffs
  ├─ diffs.getContent(diffId)         ← fetch beforeContent + afterContent
  ├─ fs.promises.writeFile / unlink   ← writes to developer's filesystem
  └─ diffs.markApplied(diffIds[])     ← mark applied in DB
```

## Auth context — union type

```typescript
type AuthContext =
  | { type: 'dashboard'; userId: string; teamId: string; role: string }
  | { type: 'apikey';   projectId: string; teamId: string; scopes: string[]; keyId: string }
  | { type: 'none' }
```

`teamId` is present on both authenticated types. Every downstream cost/billing/rate-limit check uses `teamId` — never `userId` or `projectId` alone.

JWT validation path calls `supabaseAnon.auth.getUser(token)` — server-side, never decode client-side. `req` must be passed into `resolveJwt` to read `req.query.teamId` for multi-team users.

API key validation: SHA-256 hash the raw token, query `api_keys` where `key_hash = hash AND revoked = false AND (expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > now())`. Load `project.teamId` via join.

---

## 6-gate routing decision

`resolveModel(input)` runs 6 gates in sequence. Each gate eliminates candidates; never adds.

```
Gate 1 — Preference
  if preferredModels[] provided + valid → use that order
  else → use DEFAULT_MODEL_RANKING[taskType]

Gate 2 — Budget
  for each candidate: estimateCostCents(model, taskType, promptTokens)
  remove if estimated > budgetCents
  if ALL removed → keep cheapest anyway (never fully block on budget)

Gate 3 — Health
  remove if isModelAvailable(model) === false (circuit open)
  if ALL removed → proceed with first anyway (fail gracefully, not silently)

Gate 4 — Concurrency
  query cost_logs for active requests per model in last 60s grouped by model_name
  remove if count >= spec.maxConcurrentRequests
  if ALL removed → proceed with first anyway

Gate 5 — Select
  first remaining candidate wins

Gate 6 — Return
  { selectedModel, estimatedCostCents, reasoning: string[], fallbackChain: ModelId[] }
  reasoning[] is stored in tasks.metadata — visible in dashboard
```

`resolveFailover(failedModel, fallbackChain, taskType, promptTokens, budgetCents)`: iterate `fallbackChain`, skip models that are over budget or circuit-open, return first viable or `null`.

## Model registry

| Model | Provider | Input ¢/1M | Output ¢/1M | Strengths |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| claude-3-5-sonnet | anthropic | 300 | 1500 | code_generation, refactoring, review |
| claude-3-haiku | anthropic | 25 | 125 | debugging, analysis |
| gpt-4o | openai | 250 | 1000 | analysis, review, debugging |
| gpt-4o-mini | openai | 15 | 60 | analysis |
| perplexity-sonar-pro | perplexity | 300 | 1500 | analysis (web-grounded) |
| perplexity-sonar | perplexity | 80 | 80 | analysis (budget) |

Costs are integer USD cents per 1M tokens. `estimateCostCents` uses pre-measured average output token counts per task type. Real cost uses actual token counts returned by the API.

Perplexity uses the OpenAI SDK pointed at `https://api.perplexity.ai` with `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`.

## Database — 14 tables, relationships

```
users
  └─ team_members ──► teams
                        └─ projects
                             ├─ api_keys
                             │    └─ rate_limit_buckets
                             ├─ tasks
                             │    ├─ model_results
                             │    └─ diffs
                             ├─ integrations
                             └─ webhooks
                        ├─ cost_logs
                        └─ team_billing_history
feature_flags            (standalone, team-agnostic)
audit_logs               (nullable FKs — survives cascade deletes)
```

All FKs use `ON DELETE CASCADE` except `audit_logs` which uses `SET NULL`.
`billing_period` (format: `YYYY-MM`) is the primary dimension for all cost aggregation — always include it in GROUP BY.
`cost_cents` is always integer cents. Never decimal.

---

## Diff engine pipeline — 4 files, 1 responsibility each

```
outputParser.ts     Parse <file_changes> XML → ParsedFileOperation[]
                    sanitizePath() strips ../, leading slash, backslashes
                    Invalid paths are silently skipped

diffComputer.ts     computeDiff(before, after, operation)
                    Uses 'diff' npm package diffLines()
                    Returns { hunks[], linesAdded, linesRemoved, isBinaryFile }
                    Binary detection: null bytes in first 8000 chars

safetyRules.ts      checkSafetyRules(op, projectRules, taskOverrides)
                    Returns SafetyViolation[] — empty array = safe
                    taskOverrides override projectRules (admin scope required)

diffEngine.ts       Orchestrates the above three in sequence
                    Persists one diffs row per file operation
                    Broadcasts preview via Realtime
                    NEVER writes files to disk — that is the CLI's job
```

---

## Safety rules reference

| Rule | File patterns | Default | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `protected_file` | `.env*`, `*.lock`, `*.lockb`, `package-lock.json` | always on | block |
| `file_deletion` | any file | allowFileDeletion=false | block |
| `framework_change` | `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.*`, `next.config.*`, `tailwind.config.*` | allowFrameworkChanges=false | block |
| `config_file_change` | `*.config.*`, `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.*` | always on | warn |
| `test_deletion` | `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/`, `/tests?/` | allowTestFileDeletion=false | block |
| `custom_blocked_path` | `project.safetyRules.customBlockedPaths[]` | empty | block |
| `large_change` | before>50 lines AND ratio>80% | always on | warn |
| `potential_secret` | regex: `api_key=`, `sk-[a-z0-9]{20,}`, JWT, `PRIVATE KEY` | always on | block |

`blocked=true` diffs cannot be approved via `diffs.approve()` — the endpoint throws FORBIDDEN. This is intentional: a human must change the project safety settings.

## n8n integration boundary

n8n is used for outbound integrations only. It is never in the request/response critical path.

The boundary is `server/lib/eventEmitter.ts`. It fires a POST with 3s AbortSignal timeout, catches all errors, and never throws. If `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` is not set, it silently returns.

Events and their downstream workflows:

| Event | n8n workflow responsibility |
|---|---|
| `task.completed` | Customer webhook delivery (with retry), Slack notification, Linear/GitHub comment |
| `task.failed` | Alert to project owner |
| `diff.flagged` | Safety alert to team admin |
| `cost.threshold_exceeded` | Billing alert email |

The n8n instance is at `designtec.app.n8n.cloud`. Workflows are triggered via webhook. All four workflows can be disabled without affecting core product functionality.
