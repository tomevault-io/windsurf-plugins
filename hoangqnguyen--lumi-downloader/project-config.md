# Lumi Downloader — AI Instructions

## Project

Lumi Downloader is a Tauri v2 desktop app (Rust + TypeScript/Vite) that downloads YouTube videos and audio. It auto-downloads yt-dlp, ffmpeg, and ffprobe on first launch.

- **Repo**: https://github.com/hoangqnguyen/lumi-downloader
- **Landing page**: `docs/index.html` (static, hosted via GitHub Pages)
- **Platforms**: macOS (aarch64 + x86_64), Windows (x86_64), Linux (x86_64)

## Release Process

### 1. Version bump

Update the version in **all four files** (they must stay in sync):

| File | Field |
|------|-------|
| `package.json` | `"version"` |
| `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | `version` |
| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | `"version"` |

Then regenerate lock files:
```bash
npm install --package-lock-only
cargo generate-lockfile --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

### 2. Versioning convention

- **Patch** (x.y.Z): bug fixes, CI changes, landing page updates, config changes
- **Minor** (x.Y.0): new features, new platform support
- **Major** (X.0.0): breaking changes, major rewrites

### 3. Commit

- Stage specific files — never use `git add -A` or `git add .`
- Commit message format: `v{version}: short summary`
- Example: `v1.0.3: fix macOS codesigning for yt-dlp, fix Linux deb/rpm ffmpeg conflict`

### 4. Tag and push

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin master --tags
```

### 5. CI workflow

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
- Builds for macOS (aarch64 + x86_64), Linux (x86_64), Windows (x86_64)
- macOS: codesigns bundled binaries, then Tauri signs + notarizes the app (requires `APPLE_*` secrets)
- Linux: uses dummy ffmpeg/ffprobe stubs; system ffmpeg is declared as deb/rpm dependency
- Windows: builds via `vcvarsall.bat`, uploads artifacts manually via `gh release upload`
- Creates a **draft release** on GitHub

### 6. Draft release notes

After tagging, immediately draft the GitHub release notes using this format:

```markdown
## What's new in vX.Y.Z

### Section (e.g. "Bug fixes", "New features", "Improvements")
- Concise bullet describing the change

### Notes (optional)
- Any user-facing caveats (e.g. Linux chmod instructions)
```

Guidelines:
- Review all commits since the last tag (`git log --oneline vPREV..vNEW`)
- Group changes by type, not by file
- Write from the user's perspective — what changed for them, not implementation details
- Keep it short — one line per change
- Skip internal-only changes (CI refactors, code cleanup) unless they affect the user

### 7. After CI completes

After tagging and pushing, automatically:
1. Wait for CI builds to finish — check with `gh run list --repo hoangqnguyen/lumi-downloader --limit 1`
2. Update the draft release notes with `gh release edit`
3. Once all builds succeed, publish the release: `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --draft=false --latest`
4. Delete any stale draft releases from prior versions if they exist

### 8. Rules

- Never amend a published tag — create a new patch version
- Never push without testing locally if code changes are involved
- Never delete a release — create the next patch version instead
- The landing page (`docs/index.html`) auto-fetches latest release assets via GitHub API — no manual URL updates needed

## Architecture Notes

- `src-tauri/src/ytdlp/runner.rs` — yt-dlp command runner, handles ffmpeg discovery
- `src-tauri/src/commands/` — Tauri IPC commands
- External binaries are auto-downloaded on first launch (managed by `src-tauri/src/binaries.rs`)
- ffmpeg resolution order: bundled sidecar dir → PATH → well-known locations (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`)

## GitHub Secrets (for CI)

`APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`
