# Wings core (mandatory)

## Before ANY PR touching editor or saves

1. Read `.cursor/skills/wings-data-safety/SKILL.md`
2. Read `.cursor/skills/wings-ship-gate/SKILL.md` Tier 0
3. Run `bun run test:editor && bun run test:e2e`

## Non-negotiable invariants

- Load: `resolveInitialEditorContent` — empty JSON never beats markdown
- Save: `shouldBlockEmptySave` — never persist empty over ≥20 chars
- Drafts: `shouldApplyDraft` — empty draft never overwrites server content
- Pending: `shouldReplayPendingWrite` — after fetch, before replay
- Editor: one Link; suggestion keys from `suggestionPluginKeys.ts`; WritingExperience priority 200
- Supabase: never DELETE/TRUNCATE entries in migrations without explicit approval

## If user reports missing content

Follow `.cursor/skills/wings-incident-response/SKILL.md` — rollback first, recover second.

## Agent loops

For recurring verify/fix/research: read `.cursor/loops/protocol.md`. Clarify intent before acting. Never assume skills match code — run docs-research loop to verify.
