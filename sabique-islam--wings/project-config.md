description: Playwright E2E and Vitest editor test conventions
---


# Testing rules

- Vitest for wiring/schema; Playwright for keyboard and DOM (Enter, slash, caret).
- E2E: dismiss cookie banner via `focusEditor()` before typing.
- Use `/__editor-e2e` harness; assert parity test IDs when testing serialize path.
- Slash menu in E2E: click menu buttons, not Enter alone.
- CI: `bun run test:ci` with frozen lockfile and Playwright chromium install.
