# Agent guidance

This repo contains a portable Agent Skills based personal advisor OS.

## Rules

- Always use the [`grill-me`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/productivity/grill-me) review pattern for non-trivial product/design changes: interview the plan one question at a time, recommend an answer for each question, inspect the repo instead of asking when code/docs can answer it, and walk the decision tree until the design is clear enough to implement. Keep the questions about the public repo/product, not the user's personal install.
- Keep the repo public-safe: no personal data, real chat IDs, secrets, tokens, local logs, or private runtime config.
- Private state belongs in `$HOME/.life-os` by default, or `LIFEOS_DATA_DIR` when explicitly set. Never commit private state files.
- Life OS is a helper/coordination layer over the active runtime, not the owner of the user's life data. By default, real data stays in Hermes/OpenClaw/external sources; each Life OS skill stores its own source decisions, pointers, access notes, operational state, caches, and Life-OS-specific preferences.
- Runtime credentials, delivery routing, memory, vault, mail/calendar credentials, tasks, contacts, birthdays, and cron ownership belong to the runtime or external source unless the user explicitly created a Life OS note/preference/state item.
- Prefer small skills and lazy loading over one giant prompt.
- Validate Markdown, JSON, YAML, frontmatter, and schemas before committing.
- Add runtime-specific instructions under `runtimes/` only after checking the actual runtime docs or code.
- Treat Hermes and OpenClaw as first-class supported runtimes. For any workflow that mentions skill availability, install/register paths, scheduling, delivery, or global skill visibility, document both runtime paths or explicitly mark the missing runtime path as pending with the fact that must be verified.
- Keep scripts strictly mechanical and deterministic: validation, schema/frontmatter checks, public-safety scans, boring file-layout/state creation, and smoke tests. Do not encode semantic product decisions in scripts.
- Runtime discovery and integration decisions belong to the agent playbooks, not helper scripts. The LLM should inspect the active runtime with runtime-native tools/docs, then decide where tasks, crons/schedules, reminders, memory, delivery routes, birthdays, contacts, or other systems live, and record each domain source decision in the owning skill's data file. Ask the user before changing any runtime-owned system. Generic helpers may report configured pointers and runtime inventory freshness, but must not infer arbitrary runtimes from filesystem/command heuristics.
- When tempted to add a script, first classify it: mechanical guardrail or state helper is acceptable; heuristic discovery, policy choice, prioritization, migration strategy, routing, or integration ownership is agent semantics and should be written as skill instructions instead.
- Treat `skills/life-os/references/data-integrity.md` as the universal runtime contract. Every umbrella or directly invoked subskill must load and preserve its source provenance and uncertainty, correction history, explicit missing-value semantics, read-before-write plus authoritative readback, native concurrency protection where available, and verified backup/recovery before risky data operations. Domain guidance may be stricter but must not weaken that contract or create a competing source of truth.

## Current architecture

- `skills/life-os/SKILL.md` is the umbrella entrypoint.
- `skills/life-os/skill-index.yaml` maps routines/tasks to subskills.
- Subskills live under `skills/life-os/skills/<subskill>/`.
- Subskills are normally reached through the umbrella skill. Any runtime-level visibility/global registration is an explicit runtime adapter decision, not a helper-script side effect.

## Current product decisions

- A Life OS install has two layers:
  - **mechanical install:** repo/private files exist and skills are visible;
  - **semantic install:** source, schedule, delivery, routine, review-cron, and record-keeping decisions have been asked and answered. Horizontal core choices live in global `config.json`; domain-specific choices live in the owning skill data files.
- Do not say Life OS is fully installed unless `lifeos.py doctor` reports `semantic_health.complete: true` and `safe_to_claim_fully_installed: true`. Review meeting crons must be either installed/reused or explicitly declined by the user before setup is complete.
- If `doctor` reports `install_claim: mechanical_only` or `setup_completion.status: incomplete`, say that plainly, show/propose the completion checklist, inspect the active runtime for the next pending item, and continue the setup loop instead of hand-waving. “Looks installed” is not enough.
- Horizontal core choices belong in `$LIFEOS_DATA_DIR/config.json`: task source, memory/context source, routine run records, schedule/delivery policy, and trigger defaults/overrides. Domain-specific answers belong in the owning skill data file. Store pointers and access notes, not full personal data. Avoid mixed prompt context by loading only the active runtime's Markdown adapter, not by splitting config into one file per runtime.
