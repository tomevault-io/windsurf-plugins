title: Build a standalone plugin
---

## Preface

Please read the docs on [panel plugin development](../plugins/panel-plugins) and the [getting started guide](getting-started) before continuing.

## Introduction

In this walkthrough, we'll build a simple plugin that adds a new form component that can be used in forms. This also means it will be available to users in their panels.

You can find the final code for this plugin at [https://github.com/awcodes/headings](https://github.com/awcodes/headings).

## Step 1: Create the plugin

First, we'll create the plugin using the steps outlined in the [getting started guide](getting-started#creating-a-plugin).

## Step 2: Clean up

Next, we'll clean up the plugin to remove the boilerplate code we don't need. This will seem like a lot, but since this is a simple plugin, we can remove a lot of the boilerplate code.

Remove the following directories and files:
1. `bin`
2. `config`
3. `database`
4. `src/Commands`
5. `src/Facades`
6. `stubs`

Now we can clean up our `composer.json` file to remove unneeded options.

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        // We can remove the database factories
        "Awcodes\Headings\Database\Factories\": "database/factories/"
    }
},
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        // We can remove the facade
        "aliases": {
            "Headings": "Awcodes\Headings\Facades\ClockWidget"
        }
    }
},
```

Normally, Filament recommends that users style their plugins with a custom filament theme, but for the sake of example let's provide our own stylesheet that can be loaded asynchronously using the new `x-load` features in Filament v3. So, let's update our `package.json` file to include `cssnano`, `postcss`, `postcss-cli` and `postcss-nesting` to build our stylesheet.

```json
{
    "private": true,
    "scripts": {
        "build": "postcss resources/css/index.css -o resources/dist/headings.css"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "cssnano": "^6.0.1",
        "postcss": "^8.4.27",
        "postcss-cli": "^10.1.0",
        "postcss-nesting": "^13.0.0"
    }
}
```

Then we need to install our dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

We will also need to update our `postcss.config.js` file to configure postcss.

```js
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        require('postcss-nesting')(),
        require('cssnano')({
            preset: 'default',
        }),
    ],
};
```

You may also remove the testing directories and files, but we'll leave them in for now, although we won't be using them for this example, and we highly recommend that you write tests for your plugins.

## Step 3: Setting up the provider

Now that we have our plugin cleaned up, we can start adding our code. The boilerplate in the `src/HeadingsServiceProvider.php` file has a lot going on so, let's delete everything and start from scratch.

We need to be able to register our stylesheet with the Filament Asset Manager so that we can load it on demand in our Blade view. To do this, we'll need to add the following to the `packageBooted` method in our service provider.

***Note the `loadedOnRequest()` method. This is important, because it tells Filament to only load the stylesheet when it's needed.***

```php
namespace Awcodes\Headings;

use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\Package;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\PackageServiceProvider;

class HeadingsServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public static string $name = 'headings';

    public function configurePackage(Package $package): void
    {
        $package->name(static::$name)
            ->hasViews();
    }

    public function packageBooted(): void
    {
        FilamentAsset::register([
            Css::make('headings', __DIR__ . '/../resources/dist/headings.css')->loadedOnRequest(),
        ], 'awcodes/headings');
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Creating our component

Next, we'll need to create our component. Create a new file at `src/Heading.php` and add the following code.

```php
namespace Awcodes\Headings;

use Closure;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Component;
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Concerns\HasColor;

class Heading extends Component
{
    use HasColor;

    protected string | int $level = 2;

    protected string | Closure $content = '';

    protected string $view = 'headings::heading';

    final public function __construct(string | int $level)
    {
        $this->level($level);
    }

    public static function make(string | int $level): static
    {
        return app(static::class, ['level' => $level]);
    }

    public function content(string | Closure $content): static
    {
        $this->content = $content;

        return $this;
    }

    public function level(string | int $level): static
    {
        $this->level = $level;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getColor(): array
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->color) ?? Color::Amber;
    }

    public function getContent(): string
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->content);
    }

    public function getLevel(): string
    {
        return is_int($this->level) ? 'h' . $this->level : $this->level;
    }
}
```
