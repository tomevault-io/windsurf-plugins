# WM3 Digital Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the WM3 Digital repository. This documentation serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for developers and contributors, providing essential information about the architecture, development workflows, and key features of the project.

## Architecture

### Structure

The codebase is organized into several key components:

- **Utils**: Provides utility functions and helpers.
- **Services**: Contains business logic and integrations with external services.
- **Repositories**: Manages data access and persistence.
- **Controllers**: Handles user input and processing.
- **Components**: UI elements built using React.

### Core Exports

Key components and utility functions that you will interact with:

- **Components**: 
  - `AboutSection`: Information section about the application.
  - `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`: UI building blocks for displaying information cards.
  - `ComparisonTable`: Component for displaying side-by-side comparisons.

- **Services**:
  - `AIServiceDefinition`, `AIServiceError`: Definitions and error handling for AI services.
  - `generateBrandSnapshot`, `generateQRCodeHero`: Functions for generating brand snapshots and QR codes.

- **Utils**:
  - `cn`: Utility for handling class names.
  - `appendCorsHeaders`: Function to manage CORS headers for API responses.

## Public API

The following exports are available for use within this project:

- **Components**:
  - `Card`, `FloatingElements`, `ComparisonTable`: UI components for the application's front end.
  
- **Services**:
  - `analyzeRaioX`, `calculateCost`, `generateLandingBlueprint`: Core functions for AI analytics and service costs.
  
- **Types**:
  - Multiple types such as `AIServiceDefinition`, `FinalRequest`, `CheckoutSessionRequest` which define the structure for data being passed around.

## Key Dependencies

This project utilizes various libraries and components. Notable dependencies include:

- **src/lib/service-cache.ts**
- **src/lib/leads.ts**
- **src/lib/ai/tema-360.ts**

These files handle core functionality such as caching, lead processing, and AI integrations.
