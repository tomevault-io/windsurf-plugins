# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Development Commands

**Development server:**
```bash
npm run dev    # Start with nodemon for development
npm start      # Start production server
```

**Testing:**
```bash
npm test       # Run Jest test suite with coverage
```

**License Compliance:**
```bash
npm run license-check       # Show summary of all dependency licenses
npm run license-report      # Generate detailed license reports
npm run license-compliance  # Validate licenses against approved list
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always run `npm run license-compliance` after installing new dependencies to ensure license compatibility with Apache-2.0.

**View logs:**
```bash
pm2 logs codi-api
```

## Project Architecture

This is a CoDi API for generating Mexican payment codes via QR and Push notifications, integrating with Banxico (Mexican Central Bank). 

**Core Architecture:**
- Express.js REST API with middleware for security, validation, and logging
- Digital signature-based authentication with Banxico using RSA certificates
- Supabase for data persistence and API key management
- Comprehensive validation and sanitization layer
- Fallback request handling with multiple endpoint support

**Key Integrations:**
- **Banxico API**: Primary integration for CoDi payment processing with certificate-based authentication
- **Supabase**: Database for API keys, request/response logging, and operational data
- **QR Code Generation**: Dynamic QR code creation for payment requests
- **Push Notifications**: Direct mobile payment requests via phone numbers

**Main Endpoints:**
- `/v2/codi/qr` - Generate QR payment requests
- `/v2/codi/push` - Send push payment notifications
- `/v2/codi/consulta` - Query payment status
- `/v2/resultadoOperaciones` - Webhook for payment results
- `/v2/health` - System health check

**Security Architecture:**
- API key validation (128-char hex keys stored in Supabase)
- Digital signature verification for all Banxico communications
- Certificate comparison and validation (developer + Banxico certs)
- Request sanitization and CORS protection
- Rate limiting and access controls

**Utility Layer (`controllers/utils/`):**
- Certificate handling and signature verification
- Banxico credential management and URL routing
- Request/response logging to Supabase
- Data validation and formatting utilities
- Fallback request mechanisms for reliability

**Database Schema (`/database`):**
- **schema.sql**: Complete Supabase database schema defining core tables:
  - `customers`: Client information and bank details
  - `api_keys`: API key management with Banxico integration
  - `folios_codi`: CoDi payment folio tracking
  - `requests/responses`: Request/response logging for auditing
- **database_schema.png**: Visual diagram of table relationships

**Environment Configuration:**
The `.env` file contains critical credentials including Supabase connection details, Banxico certificates, and API endpoints. The `config/institutions.js` file maps financial institution codes for payment routing.

**Testing:**
Jest test suite with coverage reporting covers all utility functions, validation rules, and core business logic. Tests are located in the `/tests` directory matching the source file structure.

## MCP Server (`mcp/`)

The `mcp/` subdirectory contains a standalone MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives AI assistants structured knowledge of this API for code generation assistance. It is published separately to npm as `codi-api-mcp`.

**Structure:**
```
mcp/
  package.json          # ESM package, own dependencies, bin entry for npx
  index.js              # Server entry point (stdio transport)
  resources/            # Static documentation blobs (no live API calls)
    authentication.js   # API key format, x-api-key header, environments
    qr.js               # QR endpoint: all fields, types, rules, request/response
    push.js             # Push endpoint: all fields including celularCliente
    consulta.js         # Query endpoint: fields, pagination, date rules
    webhook.js          # resultadoOperaciones: payload, resultado codes
    errors.js           # All error codes: edoPet, edoMC, resultado, HTTP
  prompts/              # Code generation conversation starters
    integrateQr.js      # "Generate QR payment integration for [lang/framework]"
    integratePush.js    # "Generate push payment integration for [lang/framework]"
    handleWebhook.js    # "Generate webhook handler for [lang/framework]"
    checkStatus.js      # "Generate payment status polling for [lang/framework]"
  README.md             # Setup instructions for Claude Desktop & Claude Code
```

**Key rules when modifying this API:**
- If you change a validation rule in `validators/`, update the corresponding `mcp/resources/` file to match.
- If you add or remove a field from any endpoint, update the relevant resource AND the prompt that references it.
- The MCP server uses ESM (`import`/`export`) — do not use `require()` inside `mcp/`.
- The MCP server has its own `package.json` and `node_modules` — run `npm install` from `mcp/` when adding dependencies there.
