## Commands

- **Build**: `pnpm build` (builds extension + webview)
- **Watch**: `pnpm watch` (dev mode with hot reload)
- **Test**: `pnpm test` (runs vitest)
- **Single test**: `pnpm test -- path/to/file.test.ts`
- **E2E Tests**: `pnpm test:e2e` (runs playwright e2e tests with AI generation)
- **Package**: `pnpm package` (creates .vsix)
- **UI Kit**: `pnpm uikit` (opens component playground)

## Architecture

VSCode extension with SolidJS webview. Two build targets:

- **Extension** (`src/extension.ts`, `OpenCodeService.ts`, `OpenCodeViewProvider.ts`) - VSCode extension host
- **Webview** (`src/webview/`) - SolidJS chat UI communicating via `@opencode-ai/sdk`

## Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode, no `any` types
- SolidJS for webview components (signals, createMemo, Show/For)
- Functional components with hooks in `src/webview/hooks/`
- CSS files colocated with components (App.css, uikit.css)
- Use VSCode API types from `@types/vscode`
- Prefer explicit imports, avoid barrel files
- Error handling: use VSCode's `window.showErrorMessage` and `LogOutputChannel`

## SolidJS Store Pitfall: createMemo + store proxy

**NEVER wrap a store property lookup in `createMemo` if downstream consumers need to react to in-place mutations (e.g. `produce`, `push`, `splice`).**

`createMemo` compares values with `===`. A store proxy reference stays the same after in-place mutations, so the memo silently swallows the update. Use a plain function instead:

```ts
// ❌ BAD — createMemo returns same proxy ref, suppresses downstream updates
const messages = createMemo(() => store.message[sessionId()] ?? []);

// ✅ GOOD — plain function, consumers track the store proxy directly
const messages = () => store.message[sessionId()] ?? [];
```

`createMemo` is fine for derived computations that produce new values (e.g. `.map()`, `new Map(...)`, arithmetic).

## Publishing

Use the `pnpm run publish` script to publish the extension to the VSCode and OVSX marketplaces.

## Logging into gcloud

CRITICAL: If you try to run a command get an error related to the user not being logged into Gcloud e.g. `{"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"reauth related error (invalid_rapt)","error_uri":"https://support.google.com/a/answer/9368756","error_subtype":"invalid_rapt"}`, then you MUST instruct the user to log into gcloud before you can continue.

## Opencode SDK

This extension uses the Opencode SDK. Opencode (https://opencode.ai, https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) is a coding agent employing a client-server architecture. The frontend for this extension acts as a client. The extension backend spawns the Opencode server as a separate Bun process.

You will frequently find issues where some functionality from the SDK is not wired up correctly. For example, maybe context usage is not showing up properly b/c we're not parsing the right information from the SDK messages.

In these cases, use the Opencode TUI (https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/tree/dev/packages/console) as the reference. This is a reference client implementation that understands and uses the SDK optimally. Use the librarian task to explore and research the TUI client implementation, getting back references to specific files you can use for your implementation.
