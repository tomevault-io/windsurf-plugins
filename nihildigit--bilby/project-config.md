# Bilby

Android client for bilibili, single account, open source. The implementation basis is
`DESIGN.md` in the repository root, which is a local file and not tracked. Read it before
changing structure.

**This is the owner's own repository**, so features and behaviour changes are agreed in
conversation before code, not filed as issues. If a request arrives as "add X" with no agreed
shape, say so and work the design out first. Skipping issues is a consequence of the owner
being in the room — it is not advice for contributors, who should still open one.

## Product constraints

Bilby takes an anti-algorithmic stance: what the user sees comes from their own
subscriptions and from searches they start, never from a ranker deciding on their behalf.
The point is that the content is worth their attention, not that they spend less time in
the app — this is not a screen-time tool, and arguments of the form "that would make the
app too engaging" do not belong here. Every rule below is load-bearing; treat them as
fixed:

- No recommendation feed, no related-videos rail, no autoplay. A list's contents follow from
  what the user already chose (who they follow, which video they opened). Never insert
  anything into a list as the user scrolls.
- The slot where the official app puts related recommendations holds the video's collection
  and the uploader's other work: a finite set the user selected by opening this video. The
  playback queue is built from that set, which makes it a general queue and keeps it free of
  listening-mode special cases.
- A queue plays to the end and stops. No wrapping, no looping, no refilling from a
  recommendation pool. Bounded selection is the whole reason autoplay is permitted here at
  all; refilling deletes the decision point.
- The search assistant's context contains only the user's current request. Never inject
  watch history.
- Report to bilibili honestly (history, heartbeats, coins, favourites, likes). Do no
  personalization locally.

## Fixed conventions

**PiliPlus is the authority on API behaviour.** Its source is in `PiliPlus/`, local and
gitignored. Public documentation lags live behaviour; where they disagree, follow PiliPlus.
**Risk control is per-action**: an endpoint that accepts web cookies tells you nothing about
the next one, and a write path that works over `access_key` tells you nothing about the one
beside it. Never generalise from one action to the next — check what PiliPlus actually sends
for that specific call. The parameter, header and signing facts already paid for live in
`notes/` and at their call sites.

Two paths were built, tested against the live API, and removed. Do not reimplement either:
the cookie-to-`access_key` exchange, which returns `-101`; and web login with cookie
refresh, because the refresh token this app holds comes from TV login and refreshes an
app-side token, which is a different thing from what the web `cookie/refresh` endpoint
wants. PiliPlus implements no cookie refresh either — when credentials expire it asks for
another qrcode scan, and so do we. A refresh path that looks like it works is worse than
none, because it stops anyone from handling expiry.

**Logging.** Every failure swallowed by `runCatching` logs path, code, and message through
`BiliLog`. Credentials never appear in logs: not SESSDATA, `bili_jct`, `access_key`, or the
LLM key. Cookies may be logged by key name only.

**`api/BiliClient.kt` is the only API exit.** Its routes differ in credential, signing and
UA, and each one exists because some endpoint refused the others. A call that needs a shape
none of them has gets a new route there — never a request issued around it.

**Optimistic updates exclude refetching.** Likes, coins, and favourites adjust the count
locally and do not refetch; refetching makes the number flicker twice on popular videos.

## Architecture traps

There is exactly one player. It belongs to `player/AudioPlaybackService`, a
`MediaSessionService`. UI controls it through a `MediaController`, but video must be
attached to the same-process `currentPlayer` reference because `MediaController` has no
`COMMAND_SET_VIDEO_SURFACE`. Leaving a page disconnects the controller and never releases
the player.

Listening mode is a state inside the video page, structurally identical to fullscreen. The
page stays composed, the same player keeps running, and progress stays where it is, so there
is no lifecycle to manage. Three earlier attempts got this wrong by modelling it as a
navigation destination, adding a `listening` flag on the service, and adding a
"popped versus covered" judgement at the nav layer.

Multi-part videos and collections are different things. Shuffle changes play order only; the
displayed list keeps its order and the highlight scrolls.

Navigation 3 has no separate graph: the backstack is a `SnapshotStateList<NavKey>`.

## Toolchain

AGP 9 has built-in Kotlin support, and applying `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` is a hard
error. KGP and KSP versions are overridden in the root `build.gradle.kts` `buildscript`
classpath, where version catalog accessors are unavailable, so changes to
`libs.versions.toml` must be mirrored there.
