# sonarqube-cli conventions

See @CLAUDE.md for the full project guide. Key rules to enforce:

## Never edit `src/index.ts` directly
The entry point is generated. To add or change commands, edit `src/cli/command-tree.ts` and add the implementation in `src/cli/commands/`.

## Always use `runCommand()` for command handlers
Every command action must be wrapped in `runCommand()` from `src/lib/run-command.ts`. Never catch or handle errors manually in command handlers.

## After editing any `.ts` file, format
Run `bun run format` before finishing. Non-negotiable.

## Constants from `config-constants.ts`
All paths and URLs must be imported from `src/lib/config-constants.ts`. Never hardcode paths or URLs inline.

## Keep documentation in sync
When adding, removing, or changing commands, scripts, or project structure, update `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to reflect the change before finishing.
