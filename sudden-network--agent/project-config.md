# AGENTS.md

- Favor immutability, `const` over `let`.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Avoid over-engineering.
- Prefer upgrading runtimes and tooling over pinning older versions for compatibility; only keep an old version when the upgrade is blocked and call out why.
- Pin runtime and tooling majors explicitly; do not use floating aliases like `latest`, `current`, or `lts/*`.
- Avoid configurable Terraform modules unless current usage requires it; no unused knobs.
- Favor existing, battle-tested libraries and tooling over custom implementations unless the task explicitly demands bespoke behavior.
- Group all constants at the top of the module or scope, but only when reused; inline single-use values and one-off helper consts.
- If a value is used once (e.g., base objects for spreads), inline it unless reuse is needed.
- Avoid duplication and keep sources of truth single to reduce maintenance overhead.
- When updating the Codex CLI version, update both `CODEX_VERSION` in `src/agents/codex/codex.ts` and `scripts/bootstrap-codex-auth.sh`.
- Avoid defensive code; write only what requirements or evidence justify.
- Avoid scope creep; no extra changes or state tweaks unless required or asked.
- When changing behavior, check for existing tests covering it; add or update tests to cover the new behavior if missing.
- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- Name mocks with a `Mock` suffix (e.g., `userMock`, not `mockUser`/`mockedUser`), to stay consistent across tests.
- Avoid `any`/type assertions; only use them as a last resort and keep them out of non-test code whenever possible.
