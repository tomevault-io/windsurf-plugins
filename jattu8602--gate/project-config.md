# Score Calculation in every test

- currently the score marking system is not perfect and not same in all the pages
make a universal score system and use this formula  and upload it in db too 


Formula for percentage (with +1 and -0.25 marking):

Marks Obtained = C - 0.25 * W
Maximum Marks = T
Percentage = ( (C - 0.25 * W) / T ) * 100

Where:
T = Total number of questions
C = Number of correct answers
W = Number of wrong answers
U = Number of unattempted answers










Examples:

Case 1:
T = 12, C = 1, W = 1, U = 10
Marks = 1 - 0.25*1 = 0.75
Percentage = (0.75 / 12) * 100 = 6.25%

Case 2:
T = 24, C = 1, W = 1, U = 22
Marks = 1 - 0.25*1 = 0.75
Percentage = (0.75 / 24) * 100 = 3.13%

Case 3:
T = 20, C = 5, W = 5, U = 10
Marks = 5 - 0.25*5 = 3.75
Percentage = (3.75 / 20) * 100 = 18.75%

Case 4:
T = 10, C = 7, W = 3, U = 0
Marks = 7 - 0.25*3 = 6.25
Percentage = (6.25 / 10) * 100 = 62.5%
