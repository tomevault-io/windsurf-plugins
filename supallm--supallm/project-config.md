# Add agent tool instructions

When you are asked to create an agent tool in the frontend, you will follow the following instructions.

You will have to do 5 tasks:

1. Make sure the user provided the tool name and the tool type and the tool form fields. If not, ask the user for the tool name, tool type and tool form fields.

2. Add a tool into the directory frontend/src/components/builder/nodes/agent-tools/<tool-name>/<tool-name.tsx>

- To generate the tool code you will use the template available at [tool-template-for-ai.tsx](mdc:.cursor/templates/tool-template-for-ai.tsx). This template contains some "TODO FOR AI" that will indicate you what lines you have to update based on the user's request.

3. Register the tool into the [available-nodes.tsx](mdc:frontend/src/components/builder/add-node-dialog/available-nodes.tsx) file inside the availableNodes constant. Here you will use the tool name and tool type requested by the user. And you will use a Lucide React Icon that you will also import at the top of the file.

Example node added:
```typescript
  {
    category: "agent-tools",
    type: "sdk-notifier-tool",
    name: "SDK Notifier",
    description: "Allow the AI agent to output information to the SDK",
    logo: <MessageCircle width={20} height={20} />,
    commingSoon: false,
  },

```

4. Add the tool type asked by the user into the ToolNodeTypes constant in the [node-types.ts](mdc:frontend/src/components/builder/node-types.ts) file.

5. Add the tool into the nodeTypes map in the [page.tsx](mdc:frontend/src/app/builder/chat-flow/[id]/page.tsx).

- Import the tool as others at the top of the page
- Then update hte nodeTypes map with the node type as key and the imported tool as value, see example below:

```typescript
  const nodeTypes: Record<NodeType, any> = useMemo(
    () => ({
      // other existing tools
      "e2b-code-interpreter-tool": e2bCodeInterpreterTool,
    }),
    [],
  );
  ```
