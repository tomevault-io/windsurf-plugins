# Add credential provider

When you are asked to create a new credential provider in the frontend use these rules.

You will have to do 4 tasks:

1. Add the credential object to the [provider-card-list.tsx](mdc:frontend/src/components/credentials/provider-card-list.tsx).

Example for a provider named OpenAI, you will update the current ProviderInfoMap without renaming it, simply add one provider:

```typescript
   openai: {
      name: "OpenAI",
      description: "OpenAI is a powerful AI provider",
      logo: <ProviderLogo name="openai" width={30} height={30} />,
      commingSoon: false,
    },

```

Make sure the user provided the provider name.

2. Update the [provider-logo.tsx](mdc:frontend/src/components/logos/provider-logo.tsx) component.

To do so, consider we have a component with the name of the provider. For example if the provider is named OpenAI, use the following import statement:

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "./openai";
```

Then update the switch case in the [provider-logo.tsx](mdc:frontend/src/components/logos/provider-logo.tsx) accordingly.

3. Make sure to update the ProviderTypes constant in the [credential.ts](mdc:frontend/src/core/entities/credential.ts) file.

4. Make sure to update the ProviderTypeLabelMap in the [credential.ts](mdc:frontend/src/core/entities/credential.ts) file.
