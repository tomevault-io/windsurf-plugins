# Global Rules

These rules apply to every project. Project-level CLAUDE.md files override where they conflict.

## Priority order

When goals conflict: **quality > consistent > efficient > fast**. Shipped bugs cost more than slow shipping. Consistency is the entire point of a global config. Token efficiency compounds. Speed of output matters least when shipping serious work.

## Workflow: Research - Grill - Implement - Summarize

1. **Research** (optional): orientation pass when entering unfamiliar code. Read every relevant file, produce a research artifact at `.claude/state/research/`. Skip when the area is already familiar - the grill will explore inline.
2. **Grill**: invoke `/grill-with-docs <topic>` for real-time alignment. The grill walks the decision tree question by question, emits CONTEXT.md updates (domain terms) and ADRs (architectural decisions) inline, and ends by writing a short execution plan to `.claude/state/plans/`. The user's confirmation at grill exit is the approval gate.
3. **Implement**: explicit handoff after grill exits. Invoke `/build` to walk the execution plan task by task. Run typecheck continuously. Build + lint + test must pass before done.
4. **Summarize**: save a session diary entry to `.claude/state/sessions/` when work is complete.

The grill is self-pacing: heaviness scales with alignment complexity, not a separate threshold. When there is nothing to align on, the grill exits in two turns. So the trivial bypass narrows.

Trivial bypass (skip everything, go straight to implement, skip Summarize): typos, single-line fixes, version bumps, config tweaks. Only when you are 100% sure. If in doubt, enter the grill - it is cheap when there is nothing to grill on.

Other intents are first-class workflows with their own shapes, not stripped-down versions of the implementation workflow: `/debug` for incidents, `/zoom-out` for codebase exploration, `/review-pr` for reviewing others' code, `/document` for docs, `/spec` for feature requirements.

## Security

- NEVER read or process files containing secrets, credentials, API keys, or private keys
- Sensitive file patterns: `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `credentials.json`, `service-account*.json`
- Home directory secrets (`~/.aws`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.config/gcloud`, `~/.kube`) are off-limits
- If you need config values for debugging, ask the user to provide only the non-sensitive parts

## Formatting

- Never use em dashes (-) anywhere - in code, text, translations, or documentation. Use a regular hyphen/dash (-) instead.

## Code Standards

- Use the project's formatter/linter (Biome, ESLint, Prettier - whatever is configured)
- Complete code only - no TODOs, no placeholders, no incomplete implementations
- Use Context7 MCP to pull latest docs when working with specific technologies (NestJS, PostgreSQL, Drizzle, etc.) - don't rely on potentially outdated training knowledge
- Never reference issue, PR, or ticket numbers in code comments (no `owner/repo#535`, `PR #561`, `(#545)`, `Fixes #123`, `JIRA-1234`, etc.). They rot as soon as trackers move, and the PR description or git blame is the right place for that context. Comments should describe the WHY in self-contained prose.
- Detailed standards are in rules/ (typescript, tests, database, infrastructure, security)

## Docs Sync

- Engineering docs live in each repo's `/docs/` tree, organized by [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) (explanation, reference, how-to, tutorials) plus an `adr/` folder for Architecture Decision Records
- When code changes affect behavior documented in `docs/`, update the relevant docs in the same PR
- Use the `/document` slash command to create or refresh docs - it embeds the quality rules and Diataxis routing
- Never let docs drift from implementation - if you change it, document it
- Only update docs that describe behavior actually changed in this session - no forward-looking references, planned features, or speculative content
- Diagrams default to Mermaid (text-based, GitHub-rendered, AI-readable). Use drawio when the diagram needs custom shapes, multi-layer architecture, >2 swimlanes, or precise layout - see `rules/diagrams.md` for the policy and `/diagram` skill for the workflow
- ADRs are immutable once Accepted - a reversed decision creates a new ADR that supersedes the old one

## Behavioral Rules

- **Scope**: only implement what was asked - no drive-by refactors, extra features, or unsolicited improvements
- **Minimal fix**: for bug fixes, identify the root cause and state the smallest possible change first (ideally 1-5 lines). Only expand the scope if the minimal fix is provably insufficient. Never introduce new abstractions, files, or patterns as part of a bug fix unless the user explicitly asks
- **Decisions**: ask before making architectural choices - never silently pick a pattern, library, or approach
- **Cost**: warn before any change that increases costs (new cloud resources, paid services, upgraded tiers)
- **Testing**: always write tests when implementing a new feature or fixing a bug - no exceptions
- **Conciseness**: be direct and terse during implementation - save explanations for when asked
- **Existing patterns**: follow the conventions already in the codebase - consistency over personal preference
