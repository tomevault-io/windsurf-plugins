# MDimension Project Rules

## Critical Execution Protocol

### Task Completion Standards
- Always complete all tasks fully - no simplifying approaches or skipping steps
- Keep tests up to date with 100% test coverage
- All tests must pass before task is complete
- Fix bugs in code, never modify tests just to make them pass
- Never run Vitest in watch mode; use `npm test` for automation

### After Implementing New Functionality
1. Create comprehensive tests:
   - Unit tests for logic and components (Vitest)
   - Integration tests for game flow
   - Playwright tests for frontend functionality
2. All tests must be in `src/tests/` or `scripts/playwright/`
3. Run ALL tests before considering task complete

## Code Style & Architecture

### Mandatory Style Guide
Follow `docs/meta/styleguide.md` without exception.

### Shader Requirements
All shaders MUST use WebGL2/GLSL ES 3.00 syntax:
- Use `in`/`out` declarations
- Use `layout` qualifiers
- Never use deprecated `attribute`/`varying`/`gl_FragColor`

## Test Memory Management

### Configuration Safeguards (DO NOT MODIFY)
- `maxWorkers: 4` in `vitest.config.ts` - prevents excessive process spawning
- `pool: 'threads'` - uses memory-efficient threading
- `environment: 'happy-dom'` - fast DOM implementation

### Writing Memory-Safe Tests
**DO:**
- Process data in batches of 100, clear arrays between batches
- Use component tests (`.test.tsx`) only for UI components
- Call `cleanup()` from @testing-library/react in test teardown

**DON'T:**
- Generate 1000+ data points in a single test without batching
- Rely on DOM for pure logic tests if not needed
- Forget to cleanup timers/listeners in afterEach

### Emergency Response
If system becomes unresponsive during tests:
```bash
killall -9 node
node scripts/cleanup-vitest.mjs
```

## Folder Usage Rules

| Activity | Required Directory |
| --- | --- |
| Browser automation (Playwright/Puppeteer) | `scripts/playwright/` |
| Physics, RNG, analytics utilities | `scripts/tools/` |
| Visual artifacts (screenshots, videos, GIFs) | `screenshots/` |
| Documentation, research notes | `docs/` |
| Temporary experiments / sandboxes | `src/dev-tools/` |
| 🚫 **FORBIDDEN** | Project root (keep pristine) |
