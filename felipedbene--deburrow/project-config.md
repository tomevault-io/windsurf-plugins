# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

DeBurrow is a native Android **Gopher protocol client** (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Room). It is a ground-up rewrite of *Pocket Gopher*, a 2010 J2ME/MIDlet client — the protocol logic (menu/URL parsing, the socket request/response dance) was ported to Kotlin; the entire LCDUI layer was replaced with Compose. The original `PocketGopher.java`/`.jar`/`.jad` are kept in the repo root **for reference only** (not built). Many Kotlin files cite the J2ME method they replace in their KDoc.

## Build & test

Requires a full **JDK 21** (with `javac`) and the **Android SDK (platform 35)**. The app itself compiles to JVM 17 bytecode (`compileSdk`/`targetSdk = 35`, `minSdk = 24`).

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Android/Sdk"
export JAVA_HOME="/path/to/a/full/jdk-21"

./gradlew :app:assembleDebug        # -> app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest    # JVM unit tests (protocol + ANSI parser)
./gradlew :app:installDebug         # install on connected device/emulator
```

Run a single test class/method (Gradle test filter):

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "dev.debene.gopher.protocol.GopherParserTest"
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "*GopherUrlTest.parses*"
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest` on push/PR to `main`. Dependencies are pinned in the Gradle version catalog `gradle/libs.versions.toml` — change versions there, not in `build.gradle.kts`.

### Release signing

`assembleRelease` signs with a keystore **only when** the `DEBURROW_KEYSTORE_FILE` / `_PASSWORD` / `DEBURROW_KEY_ALIAS` / `_PASSWORD` env vars are set (CI injects them from secrets). With no keystore the release APK is left **unsigned**; for a locally installable build use the debug variant. See `app/build.gradle.kts`.

That unsigned fallback is for *local* builds only — `release.yml` refuses to run unless all four signing secrets are set, because the published asset is the reference binary F-Droid byte-compares against and its signer is pinned by `AllowedAPKSigningKeys`. An empty `KEYSTORE_BASE64` once produced an unsigned APK that was published over a good one; the workflow now fails instead.

### F-Droid / reproducibility

This app is distributed via F-Droid, which builds it reproducibly from source. Two build settings exist for that and must not be removed:

- `android { dependenciesInfo { includeInApk = false; includeInBundle = false } }` in `app/build.gradle.kts` — omits the AGP dependency-metadata blob (IzzyOnDroid/F-Droid flag this).
- `distributionSha256Sum` in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` — pins the Gradle distribution by checksum; update it alongside the `distributionUrl` whenever the Gradle version changes.

The F-Droid build recipe lives at `fdroid/dev.debene.gopher.yml` (copied into `fdroiddata` for submission — keep this copy in sync with the metadata actually submitted there). Conventions the F-Droid CI enforces, learned the hard way during inclusion (MR [fdroiddata!41663](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/41663)):

- **No `Summary`/`Description` in the recipe** — they're pulled from the upstream Fastlane metadata (`fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/short_description.txt` / `full_description.txt`), which must exist on the release tag.
- **`Builds[].commit` must be a full 40-char commit SHA**, not a `v*` tag or branch (reviewer requirement).
- **`AutoName` must stay in the recipe** — `fdroid checkupdates` regenerates it from the manifest and that CI job fails on any resulting diff. (Only `Summary`/`Description` move to Fastlane; `AutoName` does not.)
- **`AllowedAPKSigningKeys`** is the signing cert's SHA-256 (`apksigner verify --print-certs <signed.apk>`, colons stripped, lowercased) — it opts into Reproducible Builds so F-Droid verifies its build against our key instead of re-signing. One-way door; keep it.
- **`Binaries`** is the URL pattern of our own signed release APK (`https://github.com/felipedbene/deburrow/releases/download/v%v/DeBurrow-v%v.apk`, `%v` = versionName). It's the reproducible-build *reference*: F-Droid downloads this developer-signed APK and byte-compares it against its own from-source build; combined with `AllowedAPKSigningKeys` this is what makes the build "verified reproducible". The `release.yml` workflow publishes exactly this asset name/path on each `v*` tag — keep the two in sync.
