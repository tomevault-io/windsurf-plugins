# Agent Instructions

You are working on the **Camunda 8 Self-Managed Distributions** repository. It hosts Docker Compose configurations for all actively supported Camunda 8 releases (8.4–8.10), along with Playwright E2E tests and CI/CD automation.

## Critical Rules

- NEVER assume Docker Compose configs are identical across versions — always check the target version directory first.
- NEVER edit `.env` files to add real credentials — they are templates; use environment variable exports for local testing.
- ALWAYS open a GitHub issue before submitting a PR (required by contributing guidelines).
- ALWAYS use Conventional Commits for PR titles and commit messages.
- NEVER create a PR that touches multiple Camunda versions unless the change is truly cross-cutting (e.g., a shared workflow fix).
- NEVER create merge commits. Use `git rebase origin/main` to update branches.

## Quick Start

- Identify the target Camunda version before editing (`docker-compose/versions/camunda-X.Y/`).
- Keep changes version-scoped; the release workflow handles each version independently.
- Read `STATE.md` at repo root if it exists (session continuity file, gitignored).

## Commit and Branch Conventions

- Branches: `issueId-description` (e.g., `423-fix-8-10-postgres-config`)
- Commit/PR titles: Conventional Commits — `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `ci`, `deps`, `chore`
- Scope: `docker-compose` for compose file changes, `github-actions` for workflow changes

## State File

Use `STATE.md` (repo root, gitignored) to persist session context across conversations.

**On session start:** Read `STATE.md` if it exists. **During work:** Update whenever you complete a task, make a key decision, or discover something important.
