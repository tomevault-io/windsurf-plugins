description: After Prisma schema changes, create a migration and commit it with the schema. Covers both the PG track (prisma/schema.prisma) and the desktop SQLite track (prisma/schema.local.prisma).

# Prisma schema and migrations

Shogo maintains **two** Prisma schemas because the runtime database
differs between cloud (PostgreSQL) and desktop (SQLite). Each has its
own migration tree:

| Schema                       | Migrations directory               | Used by                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `prisma/schema.prisma`       | `prisma/migrations/`               | Cloud API (`apps/api`)                    |
| `prisma/schema.local.prisma` | `apps/desktop/prisma/migrations/`  | Desktop app + `dev:all` local mode        |

When you change EITHER file, generate a matching migration in the
SAME PR. Schema-without-migration PRs are blocked at pre-commit and at
CI.

## When `prisma/schema.prisma` changes (cloud / PG track)

1. **Generate a migration:**
   ```bash
   bun run db:migrate -- --name <short_descriptive_snake_case>
   ```
   This runs `prisma migrate dev` against your local Postgres dev DB
   and creates a new migration folder under `prisma/migrations/`.
2. **Commit together**: include both `prisma/schema.prisma` and the
   new migration directory in the same change set.

## When `prisma/schema.local.prisma` changes (desktop / SQLite track)

1. **Generate a migration:**
   ```bash
   bun run db:migrate:desktop -- --name <short_descriptive_snake_case>
   ```
   This wraps `prisma migrate diff --from-migrations --to-schema` to
   emit a SQLite migration into
   `apps/desktop/prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql`.

   DO NOT hand-write the SQL by translating from the PG migration —
   that's the human-process bug that bricked v1.7.8 (someone added
   `MarketplaceListing` to `schema.local.prisma` and shipped only the
   follow-up ALTER, never the base CREATE TABLE). The `db:migrate:desktop`
   command uses Prisma's own SQLite SQL generator, which handles
   enums → TEXT, `String[]` → JSON-encoded TEXT, JSONB → TEXT, FK
   inlining into CREATE TABLE (SQLite can't ADD CONSTRAINT), and
   partial indexes correctly.

2. **Commit together**: include both `prisma/schema.local.prisma`
   and the new migration directory in the same change set.

3. The pre-commit hook runs `bun run check:desktop-schema-drift`
   after a schema or migration change. If the generated migration
   doesn't fully cover the schema change you'll see something like
   ```
   [drift] FAIL — 1 table(s) drift between apps/desktop/prisma/migrations
   and prisma/schema.local.prisma that are NOT on the accepted-drift allow-list:
     - [+] Added the `foo_bar` table
   ```
   Fix: re-run `bun run db:migrate:desktop -- --name <name>` (or
   amend the existing migration) so the diff is empty.

## When you change BOTH schemas

Run both generators. The PG track usually leads (the desktop schema
is intentionally a subset). Keep the migration content semantically
equivalent — `bun run check:schema-parity` enforces this at PR time
via the allow-list in `scripts/check-schema-parity.ts`.

## Migration hygiene

- Prefer **`migrate dev` / `migrate diff` / committed SQL** for evolving
  the tracked schemas. Reserve **`db push`** for quick local
  experiments only, never as a substitute for a real migration.
- NEVER edit a shipped migration's SQL in place. If you need to
  correct a previously-shipped migration, ship a NEW migration that
  fixes it forward — old desktop installs have the broken version
  already recorded in `_prisma_migrations` and any in-place edit will
  silently diverge between fresh installs and upgrade installs.
- If a migration cannot be applied interactively in your environment,
  still add the generated SQL to the tree and note the manual deploy
  step in the PR description; do not skip the migration file.

## What the CI gates catch

| Check                              | What it catches                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `check:schema-parity`              | Drift between `schema.prisma` and `schema.local.prisma` (e.g. column added to PG but not mirrored to SQLite).                                             |
| `check:migrations`                 | A SQLite migration that fails to replay against an empty DB or against any of the historical checkpoint scenarios in `scripts/check-migrations.ts`.      |
| `check:desktop-schema-drift`       | A model in `schema.local.prisma` that the desktop migration history doesn't materialise (the v1.7.8 marketplace bug). Wraps `prisma migrate diff`.       |
