# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
## Anthropic internal prompt augmentation
If you notice the user's request is based on a misconception, say so.
Never claim 'all tests pass' when output shows failures."
Keep text between tool calls to <=25 words.
Spawn an adversarial sub-agent to review non-trivial changes before reporting completion.

## Development Workflow (MANDATORY)

This project uses **spec-anchored development** (BMAD + OpenSpec). Every code change follows:

1. **Spec First** — Update `openspec/capabilities/*/spec.md` with new REQ-* and SCENARIO-*. Create/update story in `epics/stories/`.
2. **Write Tests** — Tests reference REQ-* and SCENARIO-* in comments.
3. **Implement** — Code to satisfy spec requirements.
4. **Verify** — Run unit tests, type checks, builds per commands below.
5. **E2E Verify (MANDATORY)** — Run end-to-end tests per `ops/e2e-test-plan.md`. All changes derived from user instruction MUST be verified E2E before reporting done. See E2E Testing below.
6. **Reconcile Specs** — Update Implementation Status in spec.md. Update story status. Update `_bmad/traceability.md` impl status column. If implementation diverged from spec, update spec to match reality with rationale.
7. **Update Ops** — Update `ops/status.md` (what's working/next) and `ops/changelog.md` (what you did).
8. **Update `_bmad`** — Update any part of `_bmad` that is relevant to the changes you made. Never leave specs and code disagreeing silently.

### Architecture Freshness Check

If `_bmad/architecture.md` "Last Reconciled" date is >30 days old, flag to user before starting new capability work.

## E2E Testing (MANDATORY)

**Every change derived from user instruction must be verified end-to-end.** This means:

- **Web applications**: Browser automation (Playwright or equivalent) against the deployed system
- **Mobile applications**: Mobile emulator testing (mobile-mcp or equivalent)
- **Backend services / drivers**: Integration tests against running system instances with real protocol exchanges
- **DNS resolution**: When testing against running systems, use proper DNS names when feasible (not just localhost)

E2E tests must exercise the full deployed stack, not just unit tests against mocked dependencies. The test plan lives at `ops/e2e-test-plan.md` and results are documented at `ops/test-results.md`.

## Build / Test / Deploy

```bash
# Build (compile + test + package JAR)
./gradlew clean build

# Unit tests only
./gradlew test

# E2E tests (requires running OSH node + ICEYE credentials)
# Not yet automated — see ops/e2e-test-plan.md

# Type-check (Java compiler enforces types; no separate lint step)
./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava

# Deploy: copy JAR to OSH node modules directory
# cp build/libs/osh-iceye-driver-0.1.0.jar /path/to/osh-node/modules/
```

## Session Metrics (MANDATORY)

Track execution time and token consumption every turn:

1. **Turn start**: Run `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` at start of each response
2. **Turn end**: Run `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` right before responding to user
3. **Log both** in `ops/metrics.md` turn log table
4. **Subagent metrics**: Record tokens and duration from agent result metadata
5. **On context compaction or session end**: Run `python3 scripts/session-metrics.py` to extract authoritative token counts and costs from the session JSONL, then update `ops/metrics.md` Session Summary

## User Input Tracking (MANDATORY)

Every user instruction must be captured and traceable to outcomes:

1. **Log user instructions**: At the start of each turn, record a 1-line summary of the user's request in `ops/metrics.md` turn log (Description column)
2. **Cycle time**: The turn log's Start/End columns capture wall-clock time between user input and agent completion — this IS the cycle time. Review it to identify slow turns.
3. **Instruction → outcome mapping**: Each entry in `ops/changelog.md` should be traceable to the user instruction that triggered it. If a change was agent-initiated (refactoring, cleanup), note that explicitly.
4. **Session handoff**: Before session ends, update `ops/status.md` with what's working and what's next. This is the handoff document for the next session — human or AI.

## Agentic Harness

This project uses a **context-reset architecture** with discrete BMAD agent roles. No two roles share a context window.

| BMAD Role | Agent | Context | Config |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------|
| Analyst (Mary) | Discovery | Fresh per analysis | `.harness/prompts/discovery.md` |
| PM (John) | Planner | Fresh per planning cycle | `.harness/prompts/planner.md` |
| Architect (Winston) | Architect | Fresh per design decision | `.harness/prompts/architect.md` |
| UX Designer (Sally) | Design | Fresh per design task | `.harness/prompts/design.md` |
| Developer (Amelia) | Generator | Fresh per story | `.harness/prompts/generator.md` |
| QA (Quinn) | Evaluator | Fresh per evaluation | `.harness/prompts/evaluator.md` |
| Red Team (Rex) | Adversarial Reviewer | Fresh per review | `_bmad/agents/adversarial-reviewer.md` |
| Scrum Master (Bob) | Orchestrator | Stateless script | `scripts/orchestrate.py` |
