# 🤖 Devin CLI Agent Guidelines

## Session Management with tmux

Run dev servers, tests, and interactive CLIs inside tmux with the **current directory name as the session name** for easy debugging:

```bash
SESSION=$(basename "$PWD")
tmux new -d -s "$SESSION" 2>/dev/null || true

# Run dev server with portless if available, otherwise fallback to npm
if command -v portless &>/dev/null; then
    tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION" 'portless run npm run dev' Enter
else
    tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION" 'npm run dev' Enter
fi

tmux capture-pane -p -t "$SESSION" -S -20  # check output
```

See @~/.ai-tools/best-practices.md for full details.

## 🔧 AI Tool Guidelines

- Use the fff MCP tools for all file search operations instead of default tools.
- Use the sem MCP tools for semantic version control and git operations.
- When using bash commands for file/content search, prefer `fd` (fdfind) and `rg` (ripgrep) over standard `find` and `grep` for better performance and git-awareness.

## 📋 General Practices

- Follow my software development practice @~/.ai-tools/best-practices.md
- Read @~/.ai-tools/MEMORY.md first — qmd (durable) vs agentmemory (session); follow the decision rule there
- Read @~/.ai-tools/agent-memory.md — auto-capture learnings, persist bug fixes, keep memories concise. After fixing a bug (confirmed by human), introducing a new tech choice, or encountering something important, ask: "Would you like me to record this as a learning?"
- Follow git safety guidelines @~/.ai-tools/git-guidelines.md
- Keep responses concise and actionable.
- Always propose a plan before edits. Use phases to break down tasks into manageable steps.
- Run typecheck, lint and biome on js/ts file changes after finish
- Prefer to use Bun to run scripts if possible, otherwise use tsx to run ts files.
- Ask before destructive operations — don't guess safety
- Code is communication — prefer clarity and simplicity
- Self-documenting code through meaningful names and structure
- Modular design that can evolve
- Comments explain why, not what
