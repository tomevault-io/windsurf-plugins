# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

1. Ask, don't assume. If something is unclear, ask before writing a single line. Never make silent assumptions about intent, architecture, or requirements. When running unattended, pick the most reasonable interpretation, proceed, and record the assumption rather than blocking.

2. Implement the simplest solution for simple problems, better solutions for harder problems. Do not over-engineer or add flexibility that isn't needed yet. 

3. Don't touch unrelated code but please do surface bad code or design smells you discover with me so we can address them as a separate issue.

4. Flag uncertainty explicitly. If you're unsure about something, see point 1 above. If it makes sense to do so, conduct a small, localised and low-risk experiment and bring the hypothesis and results to me to discuss. Confidence without certainty causes more damage than admitting a gap.

5. I'm always open to ideas on better ways to do things. Please don't hesitate to suggest a better way, or one that has long lasting impact over a tactical change. (as a few examples)

## What this is

Thunder Math — an arcade math-practice game for kids. **The entire app is one static file, `index.html`** (~2,800 lines of HTML + CSS in `<style>` + JS in `<script>` blocks). No build step, no package manager, no dependencies to install, no tests, no lint config. three.js (r128) is the only external dependency, loaded from a CDN at runtime.

## Commands

Nothing to build or compile. To run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000   # then open http://localhost:8000
```

Serving is preferred over opening the file directly so Web Audio unlocks cleanly. There is no test or lint tooling — verify changes by playing the game in a browser.

**Deploy:** GitHub Pages serves `main` at the repo root → https://pasuay.github.io/thunder-math/. Pushing to `main` auto-redeploys (allow ~1 min plus CDN cache).

## Reading `index.html` (important)

The file is ~1.24 MB, but **~1.1 MB of that is a single line**: the line beginning `window.SPR = {` (around line 230) is base64-encoded sprite art. **Do not read or print that line** — it will flood your context and choke tools. Locate regions by landmark (line numbers drift as the file is edited):

- **Top of file** — `<head>`, all CSS in `<style>`, and the `<body>` DOM (`#cv`, `#gl`, `#overlay`, `#controls`, answer buttons, etc.).
- **Just before the blob** — a `<script src=...three.js...>` CDN tag, then the one-line `window.SPR` sprite blob (skip it).
- **WebGL overlay `<script>`** — the block that defines `window.__thunderGL = { ready, strike, resize }` (the three.js thunder layer). It **degrades gracefully if three.js fails to load** (the 2D game still runs).
- **Main game `<script>`** — the last and largest block, an IIFE beginning `(function () { "use strict";`. All game logic lives here; sprite art is decoded from `window.SPR` into the `sprites` object near its top.

Use grep or targeted line ranges; never `cat` the whole file.

## Architecture: mode generators + a shared engine

The key structure is the split between **modes** (which only generate problems) and the **shared engine** (which runs everything else). This is why a gameplay change like a new boss-intro screen is one edit, not four.

`MODES = { addsub, mul, place, pattern }` — each is a self-contained problem generator implementing this contract:

- `usesCountAid` — flag for the "count it out" wrong-answer aid (multiply only).
- `DIFFS` — `{ easy, medium, hard }`, each `{ name, pace, boss, stages[] }`. A stage defines `kinds`/`steps`, `max`, `dots` (show the manipulative), `mix`, etc.
- `gen(bossPhase)` → a **problem object** for the current stage (or boss pool).
- `factKey(...)` → a stable dedup key for the adaptive-review queue (signature varies per mode).
- `factFits(f)` → whether a queued review fact suits the current stage.
- `problemFromFact(f)` → re-create a problem from a queued fact.
- `drawAid(t, by, hot)` → draw the mode's concrete manipulative above a monster (ten-frame, array, base-ten blocks, number line).

A **problem object** is `{ ans, disp, op, fa, fb, aidN, key }`: `disp` is the string drawn on the monster, `ans` the correct value, `key`/`op`/`fa`/`fb` feed the review queue, `aidN` drives `drawAid`.

The engine reaches the active mode via `M()` (keyed by the global `mode`). `setMode()` / `startGame()` repoint `DIFFS`, `STAGES`, `pace`, `bossPool`, `MAX_LEVEL`; `curStage()` returns the active stage spec. **To add or change gameplay for a mode, edit only its object in `MODES` — the engine is mode-agnostic.**

## Cross-cutting engine systems

- **Adaptive review** — missed facts go into a per-mode `reviewQueue` (capped at 12); ~1 in 3 problems resurface one via `makeProblem() → pickReviewFact() → M().problemFromFact()`. `recordAnswer()` masters a fact after 2 correct. **Invariant:** the `key` a mode emits must be identical for the same fact whether freshly generated or resurfaced, or mastery never registers. (Place mode encodes the question `kind` into both `key` and `op` so that e.g. "tens in 47" and "47 = 40 + ?" are tracked as different skills.)
