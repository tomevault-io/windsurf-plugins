## Kori Testing Policy

### Goals

- Verify public, observable behavior defined by API contracts across the framework (routing, context, plugins, validation, logging, HTTP, adapters).
- Detect regressions in behaviors that must not break.
- Remain robust against refactoring and internal implementation changes.

### Scope and priorities

- Prefer specification-driven tests over implementation-driven tests.
- Pin critical behaviors that would hurt users if they changed.
- Keep tests small, focused, and clear.

### What to test (spec-driven)

- Public API contracts and invariants
  - Inputs, outputs, and observable side effects
  - Protocol and semantics where applicable (e.g., headers, status, content negotiation)
  - Execution order guarantees (e.g., hook/defer LIFO or well-defined ordering)
  - Configuration defaults and override behavior
- Errors and edge cases
  - Validation errors, malformed input, missing configuration
  - Safe-return variants that must not throw
- Interaction outcomes
  - User-visible effects of combining modules (e.g., plugin-modified context affects handler)
  - Cross-module flows (routing → validation → handler → response build)
- Type contracts
  - Type guards, generic transformations, context type evolution (compile-time)

### What not to test (avoid implementation coupling)

- Object identity or caching internals (e.g., same instance returns, reference equality)
- Specific log message strings or channels; only assert logging occurred
- Internal optimizations (prebuilt structures, clone counts, micro-allocations)
- Control flow details that are not part of public contracts
- Private helper types or inference paths

### Test layering

- Contract unit tests (primary)
  - Validate each public API’s behavior and error handling in isolation
- Narrow integration tests (selective)
  - Validate small, realistic flows across modules (e.g., plugin modifies context then handler observes it)
- System smoke tests (optional and small)
  - Minimal end-to-end paths to catch wiring regressions (router → handler → response)
- Property/fuzz tests (where valuable)
  - Parsing/serialization-heavy paths (cookies, headers, schemas) with focused generators

### Mocking and fixtures

- Use real platform primitives where practical (WHATWG Request/Response, URL, Web Streams).
- Keep mocks minimal. For logging, use a thin spy object and only assert that methods were called.
- Prefer explicit inputs over global state. Avoid implicit environment assumptions.

### Stability and reliability

- Avoid time, randomness, and concurrency flakiness; fix clocks and seeds when needed.
- Streams: assert contract-only (e.g., returns a new stream), not byte-level details unless required.
- Minimize snapshots; use them only for stable shapes that are part of the contract.

### Naming and structure

- One test, one contract. Name tests as short contract sentences.
- Order tests by user journey: start with typical success cases, then edge cases, finally error conditions. Readers should understand basic behavior before seeing failure modes.
- Arrange as: setup, act, assert. Keep assertions close to the behavior under test.
- Fail with actionable messages that describe the broken contract.

### Project conventions for tests

- ESM only; include .js extensions in imports.
- Use type imports for types.
- Source files (including tests) must be ASCII only.
- Prefer functions over classes in helpers/fixtures.
- Follow Kori terminology and naming conventions.

### Type testing

- Validate public, observable type contracts (type guards, generic transformations, context type evolution).
- Prefer compile-time type tests with expectTypeOf as the primary tool.
- Keep assertions small and contract-focused; use `@ts-expect-error` for negative cases.
- Avoid coupling to internal helper types or inference paths.

### Import style

- Always explicitly import test utilities (describe, test, expect, vi, expectTypeOf).
- Avoid vitest globals configuration for explicit dependency management and IDE support.
