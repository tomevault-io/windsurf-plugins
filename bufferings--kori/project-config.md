# Documentation Writing Rules

## Source Code First

**Never write documentation based on assumptions or guesswork.**

Always read and understand the actual source code before writing documentation:

- Read main API functions, type definitions, and existing examples
- Verify all code examples work with the actual implementation
- Base method signatures and behaviors on real source code
- Check test files for usage patterns

Never guess API behavior, copy from other frameworks, or make up configuration options.

## Writing Style

### Structure Over Formatting

Use clear heading hierarchy and natural prose instead of bold text for emphasis:

- ✅ Descriptive subheadings and logical organization
- ✅ Complete sentences that flow naturally
- ❌ Bold text for emphasis (except critical warnings)

### Simple and Direct

- Start with the simplest working example
- Focus on essential value proposition
- Let code examples do the explaining
- Keep explanatory text concise

### Honest Tone

- State capabilities factually without overselling
- Avoid negative comparisons with other frameworks
- Never fabricate testimonials or quotes
- Be positive but realistic about limitations

## Remember

Inaccurate documentation is worse than no documentation. Always verify against source code.
