# CORE GUIDELINES

- Be concise. No unnecessary detail.
- ALWAYS USE TASKS! EVEN FOR SIMPLE 1 BLOCK TASKS! AFTER READING SKILL ADD ALL NEW TASKS TO TASK LIST IMMEDIATELY!
- COMMIT AND PUSH FREQUENTLY!
- NO backward compatibility. Delete unused code completely. Only keep backward compatibility if explicitly requested by the user.
- THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PRE_EXITING ERRORS- IF YOU FIND AN ERROR YOU FIX IT IMMEDIATELY!
- NEVER use `EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode` tools. Use the `/plan` skill instead when planning is needed.
- When working on feature- make sure you used `/create-clone` or `/cd-permanent` to work inside the clone. NEVER work directly in the base repo directory.
- make sure each feature works according to the feature development workflow outlined in the `feature-workflow.md` document.
- NEVER use `sleep` to wait. Use a polling for-loop with 1-sec sleep intervals instead. Each loop must complete in max 10 sec (target avg 3 sec); if the condition isn't met by then, let the loop iterate again — never extend a single loop's timeout.
- If writing bash scripts- add much more comments to explain different steps since nobody really understands bash.
- For interactive auth commands like `gcloud auth login`: run them yourself via Bash (in background if needed). The user will approve in the opened Chrome window and you continue from there. Do NOT ask the user to run these commands themselves.
- When launching long-running background processes from subagents, NEVER use `run_in_background=true` on the Bash tool — the process gets killed when the subagent exits. Instead, use shell-level backgrounding: `<command> </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &` (or redirect to a log file instead of `/dev/null`).

ALWAYS ULTRATHINK
