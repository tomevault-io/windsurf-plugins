# interpath — Development Guide

## Architecture

interpath is a product artifact generator for Claude Code. It synthesizes project documentation from multiple sources:

- **Beads** — issue tracker state (open/closed/blocked counts, priorities)
- **Brainstorms** — design explorations in `docs/brainstorms/`
- **Plans** — implementation plans in `docs/plans/`
- **Flux-drive summaries** — review outputs in `docs/research/flux-drive/`
- **Plugin manifests** — version and component counts from `plugin.json`
- **Git history** — recent commits, tags, activity patterns

### Skill: artifact-gen

The single skill routes to artifact-specific phases:

```
SKILL.md (router)
  → phases/discover.md           (shared source discovery)
  → phases/roadmap.md            (roadmap synthesis)
  → phases/prd.md                (PRD synthesis)
  → phases/vision.md             (vision doc synthesis)
  → phases/changelog.md          (changelog synthesis)
  → phases/cuj.md                (CUJ synthesis)
  → phases/status.md             (status report synthesis)
  → phases/discover-monorepo.md  (monorepo source discovery)
  → phases/roadmap-monorepo.md   (monorepo roadmap synthesis)
  → phases/propagate.md          (propagate to sub-module roadmaps)
```

### Interwatch Integration

interpath is a generator target for interwatch's drift-detection framework. When interwatch detects that a product doc (roadmap, PRD, vision, CUJ) has drifted, it dispatches to `interpath:artifact-gen` with the artifact type. interpath does not know about drift scores or confidence tiers — it receives a generation request and produces an artifact. The contract is:

- interwatch owns detection and dispatch
- interpath owns generation
- Clavain owns when to invoke (via `/interwatch:watch` or `auto-stop-actions.sh`)

interwatch's `signal_templates` in `config/watchables.yaml` declare which signals map to interpath-generated doc types (roadmap, prd, vision, cuj).

#### Architectural cycle (intentional)

The lattice's structural scan flags `interpath ↔ interwatch` as the only plugin cycle that doesn't route through clavain (see `docs/research/2026-05-06-lattice-architectural-findings.md`). The cycle is a **sensor/generator pattern**, not coupling debt:

- **Forward edge** — interwatch dispatches `interpath:artifact-gen` when drift is detected
- **Back edge** — `/interpath:all` reads `.interwatch/drift.json` to know which docs to refresh in batch
- **Shared contract** — `.interwatch/drift.json` is a published file contract, not a code dependency

Refactoring would require introducing a third coordinator owning the drift state, which is strictly more complex without separating any real concern. The cycle should be re-evaluated only if the file contract grows to bind lifecycle semantics (start/stop ordering) — at which point the right move is to extract a `FileContract` entity type into the lattice itself.

## Component Conventions

### Skills

- One skill directory: `skills/artifact-gen/`
- SKILL.md has YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- Phase files in `phases/` subdirectory
- Reference files in `references/` subdirectory

### Commands

- 8 commands in `commands/`: roadmap.md, prd.md, vision.md, changelog.md, cuj.md, status.md, propagate.md, all.md
- Each has YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- Each invokes the `artifact-gen` skill with the artifact type

## Testing

```bash
cd /root/projects/Interverse/plugins/interpath
uv run pytest tests/structural/ -v
```

### Test Categories

- **test_structure.py** — plugin.json validity, directory structure, marker file
- **test_skills.py** — skill count, frontmatter, phase files, reference files
- **test_commands.py** — command count, frontmatter, expected commands exist

## Development Workflow

1. Edit skill/command files
2. Run structural tests: `uv run pytest tests/structural/ -v`
3. Test locally: `claude --plugin-dir /root/projects/Interverse/plugins/interpath`
4. Bump version and publish: `scripts/bump-version.sh <version>`
