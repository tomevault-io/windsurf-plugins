# Markd — agent guide

Local-first markdown notes app for macOS and GNU/Linux. Tauri 2 (Rust) + React 19 + Vite + Tailwind v4 + Tiptap 3 + Zustand.

## Commands

- `bun tauri dev` — run the app (vite on port 1420 + cargo)
- `bun run build` — typecheck (tsc) + vite production build
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` — typecheck only
- `cd src-tauri && cargo test` — Rust unit tests
- `bun run release`: full signed and notarized macOS release (scripts/release.sh)
- `.github/workflows/release-linux.yml`: signed x86_64 AppImage and Debian release

## Architecture

Rust owns the filesystem; the frontend is UI + state only. All IO goes through typed Tauri commands (`src/lib/ipc.ts` is the only file that touches `invoke`).

### Vault model

User picks any folder as a vault:

- `<vault>/` — plain `.md` files live directly in the selected vault root, filename = title, no IDs. Folders are real folders. `.markd/` remains reserved app data. Portable plain-markdown. Frontmatter is optional: Markd preserves external YAML and only authors flat properties after an explicit user action in the Properties UI.
- `<vault>/.markd/` — app data: `todos.json`, `bookmarks.json`, `assets/` (pasted images).
- Vault path + theme persist in the app config dir (`config.json`).

Notes are addressed by path relative to the vault root (e.g. `projects/app.md`), never by ID. Deletes go to OS trash. External edits are picked up on window focus (dirty editor wins).

### Rust (`src-tauri/src/`)

One module per concern, each with unit tests; keep files under ~300 lines:

- `error.rs` — `AppError`/`AppResult`, serialized as `{kind, message}` to the frontend
- `vault.rs` — layout, tree scan, rel-path resolution (rejects traversal)
- `notes.rs` — CRUD, rename/move with collision suffixing ("name 2")
- `search.rs` — case-insensitive title+content search, title hits ranked first
- `todos.rs` / `bookmarks.rs` — JSON stores in `.markd/`
- `link_meta.rs` — fetch page title / og:image / favicon (reqwest + scraper)
- `assets.rs` — save pasted images into `.markd/assets/`
- `commands.rs` — thin `#[tauri::command]` wrappers only; `lib.rs` — wiring only

Blocking dialogs (`blocking_pick_folder`) must run in async commands via `spawn_blocking` — on the main thread they deadlock the app.

### Frontend (`src/`)

- `stores/` — zustand: `vault` (tree, view, theme, recents), `tabs` (open note tabs; active = derived from `vault.view`), `todos`, `bookmarks`, `ui`
- `components/` — by feature: `layout/`, `tree/`, `editor/`, `todos/`, `bookmarks/`, `palette/`, `settings/`, `welcome/`, `ui/`
- Editor: Tiptap with `contentType: "markdown"`; autosave debounced 500ms, flush on unmount; images stored as vault-relative paths, rendered via asset protocol
- Tabs: `NotesWorkspace` keeps one live editor per open tab, inactive panes hidden via `display:none` — tab switch is a CSS toggle, never a remount/re-parse. Keep it that way.
- Session: `lib/session.ts` persists per-vault UI layout (open tabs, active view, todo/bookmark tag filters) to localStorage keyed by vault root, restoring it on launch. Tag filters live in the `todos`/`bookmarks` stores (not component state) so they're subscribable.
- Page links: internal note links are plain markdown links whose href is a vault-relative note path (`[Title](projects/app.md)`). `lib/noteLinks.ts` converts href↔rel and rewrites `[[wiki]]`/`[[target|alias]]` syntax (on type + on load) into those markdown links; clicking one opens the note; `/link` slash command + `NoteLinkPicker` also insert them.
- Frontmatter: `lib/frontmatter.ts` splits a leading `---` YAML block off the body on load and re-attaches it on save. `NoteProperties` can add, edit, and remove flat text or list properties while preserving unrelated YAML. The editor body never contains the raw YAML.

## UI conventions

- Strict monochrome: only the semantic tokens in `styles.css` (`bg`, `panel`, `sunken`, `ink`, `muted`, `faint`, `line`, `hover`, `active`, `invert`…). `sunken` is the recessed surface (tab strip), darker than `panel`. Never hardcode colors; `danger` is the sole exception, for destructive actions.
- Dark mode = `.dark` class on `<html>`; themes: system/light/dark.
- Active/selected rows use inverted style (`bg-invert text-invert-ink`) — the signature look.
- Motion: 100–160ms ease-out only. Fonts: Inter Variable (UI), JetBrains Mono (code).
- No autocorrect anywhere: global `focusin` hook in `main.tsx` handles inputs; editor sets its own attrs.

## Adding beui components

Animated components come from the beui registry (the user's own library). A compatibility layer is already in place so pulled components inherit our monochrome theme unchanged:

- `src/lib/utils.ts` exports `cn()` (clsx + tailwind-merge) — what beui/shadcn files import. Our own components use `cx()`.
- `src/lib/ease.ts` — shared motion tokens (`SPRING_PANEL`, `EASE_OUT`, …). `styles.css` mirrors `--ease-out` and defines the `.press` utility.
