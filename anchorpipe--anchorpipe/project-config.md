# Anchorpipe Backend Rules (Ingestion, Scoring, API/BFF)

- Auth & Integrity
  - Ingestion endpoints require repo token + HMAC `X-FR-Sig` (SHA-256 over payload).
  - Verify idempotency via composite key (repo_id, commit_sha, run_id, framework).
  - Reject unsigned/invalid requests with clear errors; constant-time comparisons.

- Rate Limiting & Throttling
  - Token bucket per repo; default 500 req/hour; include `Retry-After` on 429.
  - Backpressure: respect queue depth; use DLQ and redrive policies.

- Messaging
  - RabbitMQ (MVP): prefetch limits, durable queues, per-message ack, DLX configured.
  - Encapsulate publish/consume in adapters to enable future Kafka migration.

- Data & Storage
  - Postgres: proper indexes (see Architecture/ERD), partition hot tables when needed.
  - Object storage (S3-compatible) for large/raw artifacts; avoid bloating DB.
  - Retention: TestRun 30d (configurable); TelemetryEvent 30d; aggregates 2y.

- Security & Privacy
  - Never log secrets/tokens; structured logs with redaction.
  - Enforce TLS 1.2+; AES-256 at rest; KMS-managed keys.
  - Redact `failure_details` per ADR-0012; PII minimization; honor DNT.

- API Quality
  - REST-first with OpenAPI; validate inputs (Zod/JSON schema); reject unknown fields.
  - Version endpoints; include ETag/Last-Modified for cacheable reads.

- Observability
  - Metrics: RED/USE; trace propagation (ingestion→scoring→API).
  - Correlate by request id; include repo_id (hashed) in context.

- Performance
  - Ingestion: streaming parse (O(bytes)); bounded memory; constant allocations.
  - Scoring: process 10k updates ≤2s; batch; idempotent consumers.

- Change Management
  - Material changes to auth, rate limits, schema, or retention require ADR link in PR.
