# Rules
- All new components should be added to the `components` folder.
- All new pages should be added to the `pages` folder.
- All new stores should be added to the `stores` folder.
- All new hooks should be added to the `hooks` folder.
- All new types should be added to the `types` folder.
- Log everything that happens on the backend.
- Always read & write to `main` branch.
- `VITE_GH_ACCESS_KEY` and `VITE_ANTH_API_KEY` are passed via environment variables when starting the Vite dev server.
- All data is stored in XML files via the Github API.
- Always use `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest` for LLMs.
- Always make the LLM generate JSON only, it's easier to parse.
- Use OAuth to authenticate with github using a static token, no auth workflow.
- Do as much as possible in the frontend. Avoid adding code to the backend at all cost.
- Use built-in DOM APIs to create XML
- The repo name is selected by the user via the drop down
- The repo drop down is always populated from github, and only shows non-fork repos that aren't in an org
- Anthropic API requests all go on the backend
- frontend is on port 3001, backend is on 3002
- Don't use Node.js APIs like Buffer, this runs in the browser.
- Use tsconfig.server.json for server.ts, for all other files always use tsconfig.json
- Use `tsx watch` to launch the server
- NEVER change my .env file
- For LLM responses when you expect JSON, always trim everything before '{' and afer '}'
- For editable text, always use EditableText
- Share code across modules whenever approprite
- Always store XML as human-readable properly indented
- Never rename variables unless requested
- Always add a license header to every new JS/TS file with current year, 2025
- Use https://github.com/tkellogg/resume-curated for testing
- LLM-only: When selecting items from a list, use a short-lived random ID that's
  discarded after the LLM operation completes.
- All prompts ALWAYS go into `prompts.ts`
- Swearing is caring. Swear frequently. Preferred words are "fuck" and "shit".
