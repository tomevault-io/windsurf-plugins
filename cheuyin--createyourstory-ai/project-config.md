description: Work in verifiable commit-ready chunks; one concern per step

# Incremental work

When implementing or refactoring:

1. **Plan in chunks** — Break work into steps where each step has one purpose and leaves the repo buildable/testable.
2. **Finish one chunk before starting the next** — Do not mix unrelated concerns in the same edit pass.
3. **Verify after each chunk** — Run relevant tests, lint, or smoke checks before proceeding.
4. **Commit boundaries** — Treat each chunk as commit-ready, but only create commits when the user asks (or at an explicit checkpoint they approve).
5. **Report progress** — After each chunk, briefly state what changed, verification result, and the next chunk.
6. **After the user commits** — Introduce the next chunk in a concise paragraph (what it does, what files it touches, how to verify). Also give a concise overview of the remaining chunks in the plan as a clean table so the user always sees what's left.

A chunk is too big if it needs "and also" in the summary or cannot be verified independently.
