# FrameYap development

This is an independent project, not a plugin for another application.
Read README.md and docs/design.md before implementation. Dated device evidence is kept
locally in the untracked `docs/archive/`; it records past observations and never proves
current device availability or grants a live run.

- Keep dependencies explicit and small. Do not add a dependency/submodule/symlink
  to an unrelated application's build tree, assets or Python environment.
- External source reuse needs a deliberate, license-reviewed standalone extraction,
  not hidden coupling.
- Preserve the one-command GitHub installation goal: no Steam store AppID, sudo
  or end-user compiler requirement. See docs/install-design.md. Do not publish a
  placeholder installer as functional or conflate an OpenVR app key with a store ID.
- Default builds and tests are offline and hardware-free. No implicit package/model
  downloads, microphone recording, input injection or OpenVR initialization.
- For changes intended for Frame, a local build is not completion: after offline
  checks, upload/install the tested native build on the Frame test device and verify
  the deployed version when device access is authorized. If unavailable, report
  explicitly that the change is local-only; do not imply the headset was updated.
- Live hardware tests remain opt-in and must distinguish API discovery from delivered
  input, transcription quality, performance and human headset acceptance.
- Preserve existing SSH and user sessions; never terminate SSH/session processes or
  use broad cleanup/restart commands. Stop only processes this project owns.
- Keep audio, transcripts, model weights, credentials and private logs out of Git.
  No automatic Enter/submit, speech commands or cloud/desktop ASR fallback.
- Build/check: `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build`, then
  `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` and `git diff --check`.
- Keep docs honest about implemented versus proposed behavior. Review exact diffs
  and create small verified commits.
