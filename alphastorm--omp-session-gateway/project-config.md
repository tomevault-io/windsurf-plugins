# Repository agent instructions

This file applies to the entire repository unless a more specific `AGENTS.md` exists below a
subdirectory.

## Product boundary

OMP Session Gateway is a secure, local-first directory and capability broker for the browser
collaboration pages of currently running interactive Oh My Pi (OMP) processes.

- Reuse OMP's existing `packages/collab-web` client and wire protocol.
- The PWA lists sessions and launches that client; it does not render or mutate transcripts.
- Consume mainline OMP’s discovery/query contract; keep gateway changes independent of OMP internals.
- Do not add terminal injection, terminal or PTY scraping, QR decoding, clipboard monitoring,
  process-memory inspection, or saved-session-file scraping.
- Do not claim affiliation with or endorsement by OMP, and do not reuse OMP artwork without
  permission.

## Sources of truth

Read the documents governing the subsystem before changing it:

- architecture or trust boundaries: `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and
  `docs/SECURITY.md`;
- IPC or HTTP contracts: `docs/PROTOCOL.md`;
- OMP integration: `docs/OMP_INTEGRATION.md` and `UPSTREAM.lock.json`;
- release claims: `docs/TEST_PLAN.md`, `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`, and
  `docs/RELEASE_STATUS.md`.

`UPSTREAM.lock.json` is the exact current OMP baseline. Inspect that source rather than relying on
an older prose snapshot. Update the lock, compatibility data, integration notes, and accepted decisions
together when the baseline or design changes. Keep `bun run check` green.

## Product names

- Product and repository: **OMP Session Gateway** / `omp-session-gateway`
- Management CLI: `omp-gateway`
- Daemon: `omp-gatewayd`
- Optional foreground alias: `omp-gateway serve`
- Service identifier: `omp-session-gateway`
- PWA name: **OMP Sessions**
- Default example tailnet tag: `tag:omp-session-gateway`

## Architecture and security invariants

### Network and IPC

- Production HTTP listeners bind only to `127.0.0.1` and optionally `::1`.
- Tailscale Serve over tailnet HTTPS is the supported remote path. Do not configure or document
  Tailscale Funnel as a normal path.
- Trust Tailscale identity headers only on the loopback backend behind Serve. Production rejects
  missing identity and compares normalized `Tailscale-User-Login` against an exact allowlist.
- Development auth may allow loopback clients without Tailscale, but must reject non-loopback
  sources.
- Require stock mainline OMP `>= 18.1.20`; the controller and local registry shipped in
  PR #11908 (`4999b98bd5`), carried by `v18.1.20`.
- The gateway only reads OMP’s private discovery directory and queries each host’s published endpoint.
  Never write, rename, or unlink discovery files or sockets; never derive the endpoint from a filename.
- Per-host discovery tokens authorize queries to OMP; the gateway’s private readiness token proves
  managed loopback readiness to its CLI and is never an OMP credential.
- The registry is metadata-only and memory-only. A daemon restart begins empty; polling repopulates it.
- Keep metadata records structurally separate from transient launch responses.

### Capabilities

View and Control links are bearer secrets. They may exist only in:

- the live OMP process;
- authenticated per-host query and launch request memory;
- one no-store launch response; and
- volatile collaboration-client JavaScript memory.

They must never enter files, databases, ordinary logs, diagnostics, tracing, metrics, crash reports,
URLs, redirect locations, cookies, browser storage, service-worker caches, analytics, third-party
assets, screenshots, recordings, issue fixtures, or CI artifacts. JavaScript strings cannot be
reliably zeroized; minimize their lifetime and references instead of claiming zeroization.

Session-list and SSE responses contain metadata only. Fetch a capability only after an explicit View
or Control action. Launch requests include the expected generation; stale cards fail rather than
receiving a newer capability. Transfer capabilities to the same-origin pinned client in memory. The gateway fetches each
capability from OMP at launch time and never stores or caches it, even in the registry.
Gateway log fields are numeric or boolean only; never log strings from host queries or metadata.

### HTTP and browser

- Validate exact `Origin` on state-changing requests and evaluate `Sec-Fetch-Site` defensively.
- Do not use wildcard CORS.
- API and launch responses are `no-store`.
- Set strict CSP, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, frame
  protections, and a narrow Permissions Policy.
- The service worker caches only immutable application-shell assets and bypasses navigation,
  non-GET requests, `/api/`, and collaboration-client bootstrap traffic.
- Keep runtime assets first-party; do not add analytics, remote fonts, third-party scripts, or CDNs.

## OMP integration invariants

Manual collaboration commands and automatic startup share one collaboration controller; never
duplicate `CollabHost` ownership or import unstable private APIs from an external plugin.

The supported settings contract is:

```jsonc
{
  "collab": {
    "autoStart": "off" // "off" | "view" | "control"
  }
}
```

- `off` preserves normal OMP behavior.
