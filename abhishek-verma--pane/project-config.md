# Git Workflow: PR-Only

Never push commits directly to `main`. All changes must go through a pull request.

## Workflow

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>`
2. Make changes, commit on the branch
3. Push the branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
4. Create a PR: `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."`
5. Review the PR (run Bugbot or manual review)
6. Merge only after review passes: `gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch`
7. Pull main: `git checkout main && git pull`

## Hard Rules

- Do NOT run `git push origin main` with uncommitted or new changes
- Do NOT commit directly to main — always branch first
- The only commits that land on main are via merged PRs (squash merge)
- Appcast updates and release tags happen AFTER the PR is merged
- If you accidentally push to main, acknowledge the mistake immediately

## Release Flow

1. All code changes go through a PR on a feature branch
2. Once merged, build from main
3. Tag and release only after the build succeeds
4. Appcast update is the final step (commit directly to main is acceptable for appcast-only changes since they're auto-generated metadata)
