# Changelog Standards

## File & Directory Structure

- Major version folder: `docs/community/changelog/<MAJOR>/`
- Per-release file: `docs/community/changelog/<MAJOR>/<version>.md`
- Each major folder must have an `index.md` with a summary table
- Root index: `docs/community/changelog/index.md` lists all series

## Page Format (per-version file)

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Changelog <version>"
description: "Release notes for ArchiPy <version>"
---
```

### H1 & Navigation

```markdown
# <version> — <YYYY-MM-DD>

[← <newer>](<newer>.md) | [<older> →](<older>.md) | [↑ <MAJOR>.x series](index.md)
```

Navigation link rules:
- Newest release in series: `[← <prev>](<prev>.md) | [↑ <MAJOR>.x series](index.md)`
- Oldest release in series: `[<next> →](<next>.md) | [↑ <MAJOR>.x series](index.md)`
- Middle releases: include both prev and next links

## Sections

Use only sections that apply. Always in this order:

1. `## Added`
2. `## Changed`
3. `## Fixed`
4. `## Removed`
5. `## Tests`
6. `## Chore`
7. `## Dependencies`

H3 sub-sections follow the pattern `### <Layer> - <Component>`:

```markdown
## Fixed

### Adapters - Kafka

- **SSL Config Typing** - Improved type safety and optional-field handling for SSL configuration.
    - Replaced dict merge (`|=`) with explicit per-key assignment
    - Optional SSL fields now fall back to `""` when `None`
```

Valid layer names: `Models`, `Adapters`, `Helpers`, `Configs`, `Tests`, `Chore`, `Dependencies`.

## Writing Style

- Entry format: `- **Bold Title** - Prose description.`
- Sub-bullets use 4-space indent for implementation details
- No trailing period on the bold title; use a sentence-ending period on the prose
- No emoji; no bare `print()` calls; always double quotes

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD
- **Organization Management** - Implemented comprehensive organization management functionality.
    - Added `OrganizationAdapter` with CRUD operations
    - Exposed `GET /organizations/{id}` endpoint

# ❌ BAD
- Organization Management: implemented org management  (missing bold, no period, lowercase verb)
```

## Index Updates

After creating a new version file, update **three** files and edit **one existing version file**:

### Previously newest version file

The release that was the latest before your new one had no "newer" link. Add the back-link to it:

```markdown
# ❌ BEFORE (4.3.5 was the newest)
[← 4.3.4](4.3.4.md) | [↑ 4.x series](index.md)

# ✅ AFTER (4.3.6 is now newest; 4.3.5 becomes middle)
[← 4.3.6](4.3.6.md) | [4.3.4 →](4.3.4.md) | [↑ 4.x series](index.md)
```

### `docs/community/changelog/<MAJOR>/index.md` (and root index)

Prepend a row (newest first) to the table:

```markdown
| [<ver>](<ver>.md) | YYYY-MM-DD | <One-line summary of most notable change> |
```

### `docs/community/changelog/index.md`

Update the release count and version range for the affected series:

```markdown
## [4.x Series](4/index.md)

13 releases — from 4.0.0 to 4.3.6
```
