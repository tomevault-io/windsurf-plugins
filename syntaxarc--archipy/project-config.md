# Adapter Conventions

## Required Files per Adapter

Every adapter package must contain at minimum:

```
archipy/adapters/<service>/
├── __init__.py
├── ports.py        # Abstract interface (ABC)
└── adapters.py     # Concrete implementation
```

A `mocks.py` is **optional** — only add it when the adapter is used directly in BDD tests and an in-memory test double is needed (e.g., Redis, Kafka). Do not create mocks for adapters that are tested via real instances or testcontainers.

## Ports (Abstract Interfaces)

`ports.py` defines the contract using `abc.ABC`. Implementations (and mocks, if they exist) must both satisfy this interface.

```python
# ✅ GOOD
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class CachePort(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get(self, key: str) -> str | None: ...

    @abstractmethod
    def set(self, key: str, value: str, ttl: int | None = None) -> None: ...
```

- `ANN401` (Any) is allowed in ports for `**kwargs` parameters.
- `ARG002` (unused arguments) is allowed — interface stubs may not use all params.

## Mocks (Test Doubles) — Optional

Add `mocks.py` only when an in-memory test double is genuinely needed for BDD tests. When present, mocks are exempt from:
- `ARG001`, `ARG002`, `ARG004`, `ARG005` — unused arguments common in mock signatures
- `ANN401` — Any types for compatibility
- `PLR0913` — mock constructors may accept many params

For adapters tested via real service instances (e.g., using `testcontainers`), skip `mocks.py` entirely.

## Session Managers

Database adapters use `session_manager_registry.py` for managing SQLAlchemy sessions. These files use lazy imports (`PLC0415`) to break circular import chains — this is intentional and expected.

```python
# ✅ GOOD — lazy import in session registry
def get_session_manager() -> SessionManager:
    from archipy.adapters.postgres.sqlalchemy.adapters import PostgresAdapter  # noqa: PLC0415
    ...
```

## Async vs Sync Adapters

- Async variants are declared as separate `optional-dependencies` extras (e.g., `sqlalchemy-async`, `starrocks-async`).
- Async adapters use `asyncio` and `sqlalchemy[asyncio]`.
- Sync and async implementations are separate classes — do not mix `async def` into sync adapter classes.

## Exception Handling at Boundaries

Adapters at the infrastructure boundary (Kafka, Redis, ScyllaDB) may use broad `except Exception` (`BLE001`) only at the outermost boundary where converting to domain errors:

```python
# ✅ GOOD — broad catch only at adapter boundary, then re-raise as domain error
try:
    await self._client.produce(topic, message)
except Exception as e:  # noqa: BLE001
    raise KafkaProduceError("Failed to produce message") from e
```

## Optional Dependency Imports

Adapters rely on their optional extra being installed — do **not** use lazy imports to guard third-party dependencies inside adapter classes. If the extra is not installed, the import at module level will fail with a clear `ImportError`, which is the expected behavior.

Lazy imports (`PLC0415`) are only permitted in `session_manager_registry.py` files to break circular import chains, and in `archipy/helpers/` for optional utility dependencies.
