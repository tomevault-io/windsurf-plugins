# Codex Repository Instructions

## Engineering Principles

- Fix the fundamental root cause, not symptoms.
- Do not implement temporary workarounds.
- Prefer the simplest solution that fully solves the current problem.
- Avoid over-engineering, speculative abstraction, and premature optimization.
- Keep changes systematic, durable, and maintainable.
- Introduce design/architecture changes only when required to solve root cause or clear structural risk.
- Validate scalability for expected real workloads, including distributed/non-local execution paths.

## Rule Priority

When instructions conflict, prioritize in this order:

1. Correctness
2. Reliability
3. Performance
4. Developer convenience

## Scalability and Environment Scope

- Design and validate changes for scalability beyond local execution.
- Consider behavior on remote workers, cloud systems, and distributed environments.
- Ensure local-only assumptions are explicit and justified.

## Testing Strategy

- Prioritize functional happy-path test cases first.
- Add edge-case tests after happy paths are covered.
- Add failure-mode and regression tests for the root cause after happy paths and edge cases.
- If a change affects queue/worker/distributed execution, validate at least one non-local path (remote worker, cloud environment, or distributed setup).

## Code Quality and Readability

- Keep code structured, consistent, and easily readable for humans.
- Prefer minimal diffs with clear intent.

## Documentation Maintenance

- When behavior, interfaces, or workflows change, update the nearest relevant docs under `docs/`.
- If doc entry points change, update the `Docs Index (Agent Jump List)` in this file.
- Keep `docs/` root reserved for the docs hub, top-level normative specs, and high-value example/reference artifacts.
- Put prose docs under grouped subdirectories such as `docs/getting-started/`, `docs/experiments/`, `docs/deployment/`, `docs/operations/`, `docs/benchmark-ci/`, `docs/reference/`, `docs/contributors/`, `docs/design/`, and `docs/modules/`.
- Do not add root-level moved-page shims or duplicate canonical docs under `docs/`.

## Design Doc Authoring Policy (Subagents)

- When creating or editing files under `docs/design/`, follow `docs/design/doc-authoring-guidelines.md`.
- Treat `docs/design/` as contract-level documentation (invariants, interfaces, state transitions, failure semantics, deployment behavior), not implementation snapshots.
- Do not paste large implementation code blocks into design docs. If code is needed, keep short pseudocode and link implementation files.
- Do not add checklist-style implementation tracking (`- [ ]`, `- [x]`), commit-hash narratives, or "current shape" snapshots in design docs.
- For distributed/queue/worker/evaluator topics, explicitly document non-local behavior and failure/retry semantics.
- If behavior changes, update the canonical design section in the same PR/commit; do not rely on "historical/outdated" disclaimers.

## Benchmark Change Logging

- Any change under `benchmarks/<benchmark-name>/` must update that benchmark's `.aixcc/CHANGELOG.md`.
- If `.aixcc/CHANGELOG.md` does not exist, create it.
- Each entry should include at minimum: date, changed files, root cause, fix summary, and validation evidence (command + outcome).
- Include actual textual diff content in the changelog entry (key hunks or full diff), not only file-name lists.
- Use benchmark-relative paths in changelog diffs; do not include absolute local filesystem paths.
- If a change is only a large binary blob, summarize it with path + reason instead of pasting binary diff content.
- If multiple fixes are made for the same benchmark, append a new entry (do not rewrite prior history).

## Definition of Done

Before considering work complete:

- Implementation addresses root cause (not a temporary workaround).
- Relevant tests are added/updated and pass (happy path first, then edge/failure/regression as needed).
- Distributed/non-local validation is completed when applicable.
- Relevant docs are updated when behavior or workflows changed.
- Pre-commit quality gate passes: `scripts/ci-tests/run-local.sh checks`.
- Post-commit review loop is completed: commit -> agent-team review -> fixes -> repeat until no findings.

## Development Workflow Loop

- Complete the full implementation loop for each task: implement -> validate -> commit -> review.
- When implementation appears complete, create a commit.
- Run a review with an agent team after each commit.
- Address every bug or issue found by the agent review team.
- Repeat commit + agent-team review until no additional bugs or issues are reported.

## Commit Message Standard

- Follow strict Conventional Commits for every commit (for example: `feat(queue): add worker backoff`).

## Quality Check Quick Guide

Before committing:

```bash
uv run ruff format crsbench/ tests/     # if Python files in these paths were touched
scripts/ci-tests/run-local.sh checks
```

If additional confidence is needed before merge:

```bash
scripts/ci-tests/run-local.sh
```

## Pre-Commit Quality Gate

Before creating any commit, run:

```bash
scripts/ci-tests/run-local.sh checks
```

If this command fails, do not commit until failures are fixed.
