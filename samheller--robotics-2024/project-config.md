# Repository Guidelines

This project contains examples and starter code for programming VEX V5 robots using Python. It is intended for students who are new to programming, so simplicity and readability are the top priorities.

## Style Guidelines

1. Keep the code straightforward and beginner friendly.
2. Avoid advanced Python features such as decorators, metaclasses, and complex comprehensions.
3. Use descriptive variable names and add comments explaining what each section of code does.
4. Provide a short docstring for every function.
5. Break logic into small, focused functions whenever possible.
6. Keep dependencies minimal and stick to the VEX V5 Python API.

## Programmatic Check

Before committing any changes, make sure all Python files compile by running:

```bash
python -m py_compile $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

The command should exit with no output, indicating that all files compiled successfully.
