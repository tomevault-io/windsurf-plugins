# Overview
- Use Swift testing whenever possible. Do not use XCTest
- Run tests using the test commands defined in "Running Tests"

# Swift Testing
- We should prefer to use a struct for the test class unless we need to mutate a variable for some reason.
- Tests are annototated with `@Test`.
- Assertions are done view `#expect(<condition>)`.
- To correctly import the Swift Testing use `import Testing`.
- Test method names should be in the form `method_condition`. You do not need to prefix with test.

Here's an example of a simple swift test:

```
@Test
func videoCommenting() async throws {
    let video = try #require(await videoLibrary.video(named: "A Beach"))
    #expect(video.comments.contains("So picturesque!"))
}
```

# Running Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
swift test
```

To run a specific test:
```bash
swift test --filter "testName"
```

For example, to run only the `inject` test:
```bash
swift test --filter "inject"
```

You can also use partial matches:
```bash
swift test --filter "inject*"  # Runs all tests starting with "inject"
```
