# GlawMail Skill

Format emails for human-in-the-loop Gmail sending.

## Format

```
GLAWMAIL
To: recipient@email.com
Subject: Email subject line
Body:
Your email body here...
```

## Rules

- Start with `GLAWMAIL` on its own line
- `To:` followed by email address
- `Subject:` followed by subject line
- `Body:` followed by the message (can be multiline)
- User forwards your message to GlawMail bot to send
- For multiple emails, send each GLAWMAIL block as a separate message

## Triggers

Use this format when user says:
- "send email"
- "email to"
- "compose email"
- "write email"

## Example

User: "Send email to james@example.com about the meeting tomorrow"

Response:
```
GLAWMAIL
To: james@example.com
Subject: Meeting Tomorrow
Body:
Hi James,

Just a reminder about our meeting tomorrow.

Best regards
```

## Multiple Emails

When asked to send multiple emails, output each as a separate message:

Message 1:
```
GLAWMAIL
To: alice@example.com
Subject: Meeting
Body:
Hi Alice, ...
```

Message 2:
```
GLAWMAIL
To: bob@example.com
Subject: Meeting
Body:
Hi Bob, ...
```

This allows the user to approve each email individually.

## Security

- You cannot send emails directly
- User must forward to GlawMail bot to approve
- Human-in-the-loop design prevents unauthorized sending
