# Terminal MCP Project Instructions

## What This Project Does

**terminal-mcp** is a standalone CLI tool (`tmcp`) that bridges AI coding agents with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers via simple terminal commands.

**Core Purpose:** Enable AI agents (like OpenAI Codex) to access external tools and APIs through MCP servers without requiring native MCP support.

## Key Features

- 🚀 **Zero Dependencies**: Standalone executable that doesn't require Node.js, Python, or any other runtime to be installed
- 🌐 **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux (x64 & ARM64) and macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)
- ⚡ **Fast Startup**: Launches in under 100ms
- 🔧 **Supports mcp.json config**: Support for common configuration files from popular MCP clients (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)
- 🔐 **Authentication**: Support for custom headers and environment variables
- 🎯 **Direct Tool Calls**: Connect to any MCP server without configuration
- 📦 **Agent-Safe Binary**: Zero risk of config changes or bypassing security controls because your agent literally gets a different binary that only allows listing and calling pre-configured tools.

## How It Works

1. **MCP Servers** host tools (APIs, documentation search, code analysis, etc.)
2. **terminal-mcp** connects to these servers and exposes their tools via CLI
3. **AI Agents** call tools using simple terminal commands: `tmcp call tool-name '{"param": "value"}'`

## Key Components

- **`tmcp init`**: Discovers tools from configured MCP servers and generates tools.json with all available tools
- **`tmcp list`**: Shows all enabled tools with their schemas and example usage
- **`tmcp call`**: Executes tools using `server__tool-name` aliases (only enabled tools)
- **`tmcp direct`**: Bypasses configuration for one-off server communication
- **`tmcp upgrade`**: Updates to latest version (developer version only)

## Quick Setup Flow

```bash
# 1. Install (Developer Version)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zueai/terminal-mcp/main/install.sh | bash

# 2. Configure (create servers.json with server URLs)
# Example: ./terminal-mcp/servers.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
    },
    "ref": {
      "url": "http://api.ref.tools/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-ref-api-key": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}

# 3. Initialize and discover tools
tmcp init

# 4. Edit ./terminal-mcp/tools.json to disable unwanted tools (set enabled: false)

# 5. For agents, install agent-safe binary:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zueai/terminal-mcp/main/install-agent.sh | bash

# 6. Use tools
tmcp call context7__resolve-library-id '{"libraryName": "react"}'
```

## Configuration Files Supported

- `./.cursor/mcp.json` - Cursor IDE configuration
- `./mcp.json` - Root level configuration
- `./terminal-mcp/servers.json` - Terminal-mcp specific configuration

## Agent-Safe Binary

The project provides two versions:
- **Developer Version**: Full control with `init`, `direct`, `upgrade` commands
- **Agent Version**: Security-focused binary that only allows `list` and `call` operations

This ensures AI agents stay within the boundaries you've set as a developer while still having full access to the tools they need to be productive.

## Built With

- **Bun** runtime (compiled to standalone binary)
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk** for MCP communication
- **Zero dependencies** in final binary

## Development Workflow

### After Every Task Completion

**1. Check README Updates**
```bash
# Review if README.md needs updates based on changes made
# Update README.md if:
# - New features were added
# - Commands changed
# - Installation process changed
# - Examples need updating
# - Documentation links changed
```

**2. Run Full Test Suite**
```bash
# Always run comprehensive tests after task completion
bun run test

# If tests fail, investigate and fix before considering task complete
# Test suite covers:
# - Direct server communication
# - Configuration-based usage
# - Error handling
# - Help/usage commands
```

### Test Commands Available

- `bun run test` - Full comprehensive test suite (~10-15 seconds)
- `bun run test:ci` - Quick regression tests (~5 seconds)
- Manual testing: `./dist/terminal-mcp-* direct https://mcp.context7.com/mcp list`

### Development Commands

- `bun run dev` - Run in development mode
- `bun run build` - Build for current platform
- `bun run build:all` - Build for all platforms
- `bun run clean` - Clean build artifacts

**Remember:** Every task completion = README check + full test run ✅

### Releases

If I tell you to release a "new minor" or a "new patch", here's what you should do: commit all the changes that are currently made, push it to main, and then  run `./scripts/release.sh minor -y` or `./scripts/release.sh patch -y`. This command will do everything to correctly release the new version using GitHub Actions.
