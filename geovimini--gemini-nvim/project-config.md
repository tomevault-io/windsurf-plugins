## Gemini CLI History

- **2025-07-08**: Initial setup. Created `plan.md` to outline the plugin development and `GEMINI.md` to track decision history.
- **2025-07-08**: Defined plugin name as `frkurpiel/gemini.nvim` and set its description.
- **2025-07-08**: Specified API interaction details: support for `GEMINI_API_KEY` and Vertex AI via environment variables. Decided to use Neovim's built-in `vim.loop` for HTTP requests.
- **2025-07-08**: Decided on the first feature: Code Completion. It will integrate with `nvim-cmp`, using the standard completion menu and preview window. Defined the configuration strategy using a `setup()` function with an `opts` table for `lazy.nvim` users, allowing overrides of environment variables.
- **2025-07-08**: Refined the configuration structure to be more scalable. It now includes a global `auth` block, a `gemini_defaults` block for settings shared across features, and a `features` block for per-feature overrides. This provides a clear and DRY configuration cascade.
- **2025-07-08**: Detailed the `completion` feature to be context-aware. Added a `filetypes` configuration block to allow for different context-gathering strategies (e.g., "surrounding_function") and Gemini parameters on a per-language basis. Set the default model to `gemini-1.5-flash`.
