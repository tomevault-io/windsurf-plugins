# Repository Guidelines

## Goals
This project is meant for Clerk to write publicly viewable evals. These evals test how LLMs perform at writing code using Clerk.

## For AI Agents (default context)
You are operating in a repository whose sole purpose is to evaluate how well LLMs write Clerk code. When a user asks for something like "create a new eval suite for the Waitlist feature", follow the steps below by default.

- Create a new evaluation folder under `src/evals/` using a concise kebab-case slug, e.g. `src/evals/waitlist/`.
- Inside that folder, add two files:
  - `PROMPT.md`: plain-English task and acceptance criteria. Be explicit about the framework (Next.js) and Clerk expectations.
  - `graders.ts`: export a `graders` object using `defineGraders(...)` where each grader returns `boolean`. Prefer deterministic code graders (`contains`, `matches`, `all`, `not`) over LLM judges (`judge()`). Only use `judge()` for semantic checks that can't be expressed as pattern matching.
- Register the new evaluation path in `src/config/evaluations.ts` by appending an entry with `framework`, `category`, and `path`.
- Validate locally:
  - `bun start --eval "<slug>" --smoke --debug` to test with one model
  - `bun start` to run full suite
- Style and structure:
  - Keep files TypeScript ESNext. Use the `@/*` path alias.
  - Use Biome: `bun run lint:fix` before committing.

See `docs/ADDING_EVALS.md` for a concrete, copy-pastable template and end-to-end checklist.

## Common Workflows

```bash
# Run all evals (baseline)
bun start

# Run single eval with debug
bun start --eval "auth/protect" --smoke --debug

# Run with MCP tools
bun start --mcp --model "claude-sonnet-4-5"

# Run with skills
bun start --skills --model "claude-sonnet-4-5"

# Full batch (all 16 models, baseline + MCP, with retry)
./run-evals.sh

# Export to Braintrust
BRAINTRUST_API_KEY=sk-... bun report:braintrust
```

### Agent Evaluations (Multi-Agent)

Agent evals spawn CLI tools as child processes. Install them before running:

- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart) — requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) — requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Both API keys must be set in `.env`.

```bash
# Run agent evals with Claude Code
bun agent:claude
bun agent:claude --eval add-auth --debug

# Run agent evals with Codex
bun agent:codex
bun agent:codex --eval add-auth --debug

# Multi-trial (3 runs per eval, pass@k metrics)
bun agent:claude --runs 3
bun agent:codex --runs 3

# With skills or MCP
bun agent:claude --skills
bun agent:claude --skills --mcp

# Cross-agent leaderboard export
bun export:leaderboard
bun export:leaderboard --since 2026-03-20
```

## Project Structure & Module Organization
`src/index.ts` wires providers, runners, reporters, and every folder under `src/evals`. Keep each evaluation in its own directory with `PROMPT.md`, `graders.ts`, and any fixtures it needs. Use descriptive, numeric-free slugs like `src/evals/new-eval`. Runner logic lives in `src/runners`, shared provider clients in `src/providers`, scoring helpers in `src/scorers`, and reusable utilities in `src/utils`. Diagrams intended for contributor onboarding belong in `docs/`, while transient artifacts like `scores.json` stay gitignored at the root.

## Environment Setup & Secrets
This project requires Bun `>=1.3.0`. Install dependencies with `bun install`, then copy `.env.example` to `.env` and populate `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `V0_API_KEY`. Avoid checking secrets into version control; reference them through `process.env` only.

For MCP evaluations, the runner connects to `https://mcp.clerk.dev/mcp` by default. Override with `MCP_SERVER_URL_OVERRIDE` for local testing.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
`bun start` runs the full evaluation suite and writes reporter output to the console and `scores.json`. Target a single evaluation with `bun start --eval "auth/routes"`, and add `--debug` to capture prompts, responses, and grader decisions. Use `--smoke` to run just one task for quick iteration. Lint and format with `bun run lint`, `bun run lint:fix`, and `bun run format`; `bun run check` applies Biome's autofixes and unsafe rules when you need a full cleanup.

### MCP Evaluations
Run evaluations with MCP tool support using `bun start:mcp`. Connects to `https://mcp.clerk.dev/mcp` by default (zero-config):

```bash
# Production MCP server (default)
bun start:mcp

# Local MCP server override
MCP_SERVER_URL_OVERRIDE=http://localhost:8787/mcp bun start:mcp

# Filter by model or eval
bun start:mcp --model "Sonnet" --eval "organizations" --debug
```

Tools are discovered dynamically via the MCP protocol. The system prompt is identical to the baseline runner.
