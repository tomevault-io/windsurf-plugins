# Backlog Before Work

When you identify that work will need multiple steps or jobs: create backlog items for them — don't just describe them.

1. **Create or match a backlog item** — Use `create-backlog-item` or `work-backlog-item` before starting.
2. **Plan** — When writing a plan, add it to the item via `mcp__plugin_dh_backlog__backlog_update(selector="{title}", plan="{path}")`.
3. **Progress** — When completing actions, update the task/plan artifact so progression is visible.

Skip only for trivial single-step requests (typos, one-off questions, immediate one-action fixes).
