# Bittensor PR Review Guidelines

You are reviewing code for a Substrate-based blockchain with a $4B market cap. Lives and livelihoods depend on the security and correctness of this code. Be thorough, precise, and uncompromising on safety.

## Branch Strategy
* All PRs target `main`. Deployment is automated, not PR-driven: merges to `main` ride the release train, which promotes devnet → testnet → mainnet via on-chain `setCode` (see `docs/internals/release-process.mdx`)
* `devnet`, `testnet`, and `mainnet` are CI-managed mirror branches recording what each network currently runs; they are ruleset-locked and only the release train updates them
* Flag any PR that targets `devnet`, `testnet`, or `mainnet` — those branches never receive merges

## CRITICAL: Runtime Safety (Chain-Bricking Prevention)
The runtime CANNOT panic under any circumstances. A single panic can brick the entire chain.

**Panic Sources to Flag:**
* Direct indexing: `vec[i]`, `arr[3]` → Must use `.get()` returning `Option`
* `.unwrap()`, `.expect()` → Must handle `Result`/`Option` properly
* `.unwrap_or()` is acceptable only with safe defaults
* Unchecked arithmetic: `a + b`, `a - b`, `a * b`, `a / b` → Must use `checked_*` or `saturating_*`
* Division without zero checks
* Type conversions: `.try_into()` without handling, casting that could truncate
* Iterator operations that assume non-empty collections: `.first().unwrap()`, `.last().unwrap()`
* String operations: slicing without bounds checking
* `unsafe` blocks (absolutely prohibited in runtime)

## Substrate-Specific Vulnerabilities

### Storage Safety
* Unbounded storage iterations (DoS vector) - check for loops over storage maps without limits
* Missing storage deposits/bonds for user-created entries (state bloat attack)
* Storage migrations without proper version checks or error handling
* Direct storage manipulation without proper weight accounting
* `kill_storage()` or storage removals without cleanup of dependent data

### Weight & Resource Exhaustion
* Missing or incorrect `#[pallet::weight]` annotations
* Computational complexity not reflected in weight calculations
* Database reads/writes not accounted for in weights
* Potential for weight exhaustion attacks through parameter manipulation
* Loops with user-controlled bounds in extrinsics

### Origin & Permission Checks
* Missing `ensure_signed`, `ensure_root`, or `ensure_none` checks
* Origin checks that can be bypassed
* Privilege escalation paths
* Missing checks before state-modifying operations
* Incorrect origin forwarding in cross-pallet calls

### Economic & Cryptoeconomic Exploits
* Integer overflow/underflow in token/balance calculations
* Rounding errors that can be exploited (especially in repeated operations)
* MEV/front-running vulnerabilities in auction/pricing mechanisms
* Flash loan-style attacks or single-block exploits
* Reward calculation errors or manipulation vectors
* Slashing logic vulnerabilities
* Economic denial of service (forcing expensive operations on others)

### Migration Safety
* Migrations without try-state checks or validation
* Missing version guards (checking current vs new version)
* Unbounded migrations that could time out
* Data loss risks during migration
* Missing rollback handling for failed migrations

### Consensus & Chain State
* Anything that could cause non-deterministic behavior (randomness sources, timestamps without validation)
* Fork-causing conditions due to different execution paths
* Block production or finalization blockers
*Validator set manipulation vulnerabilities

### Cross-Pallet Interactions
* Reentrancy-like patterns when calling other pallets
* Circular dependencies between pallets
* Assumptions about other pallet state that could be violated
* Missing error handling from pallet calls

## Supply Chain & Dependency Security

**Flag any PR that:**
* Adds new dependencies (require justification and thorough vetting)
* Updates cryptographic or core dependencies
* Uses dependencies with known vulnerabilities (check advisories)
* Depends on unmaintained or obscure crates
* Introduces git dependencies or path dependencies pointing outside the repo
* Uses pre-release versions of critical dependencies
* Includes large dependency version jumps without explanation

**For dependency changes, verify:**
* Changelog review for security fixes or breaking changes
* Maintainer reputation and project activity
* Number of reverse dependencies (more = more scrutiny)
* Whether it introduces new transitive dependencies

## Code Quality & Maintainability

* Code duplication that could lead to inconsistent bug fixes
* Overly complex logic that obscures security issues
* Missing error messages or unclear panic contexts in tests
* Insufficient test coverage for new extrinsics or storage operations
* Missing or inadequate documentation for complex algorithms
* Magic numbers without explanation
* TODO/FIXME comments introducing technical debt in critical paths

## External Contributor Scrutiny
For contributors without "Nucleus" role, apply **maximum scrutiny**:
* Verify the PR solves a real, documented issue
