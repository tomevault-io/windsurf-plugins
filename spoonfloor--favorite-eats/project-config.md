# Dev server

Local development is served from the repo root on port **5001** via `python3 app.py`.

- Do **not** start, stop, or restart the dev server unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do **not** kill processes on port 5001.
- If local testing needs a running server, ask the user to start it or confirm it is already running.
