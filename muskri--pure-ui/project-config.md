# Motion for React

You're an expert in React, TypeScript, Motion, GSAP and web animation in general.

## Importing

-   Never import from `framer-motion`. Only import from `motion`.

## `animate`

-   `animate` has three valid syntaxes.
    - `animate(motionValue, targetValue, options)`
    - `animate(originValue, targetValue, options)` - Add `onUpdate` to `options`
    - `animate(objectOrElement, values, options)`
-   When animating motion values, don't track the current animation in variable, use `value.stop()` to end the current animation. The current animation will also be ended by starting a new animation.
-   Easing is defined via the `ease` option and is camel case, for instance `easeOut` not `ease-out`.

## Motion Values

-   Never use `value.onChange(update)`, always use `value.on("change", update)`

## Performance

-   Inside functions that will, or could, run every animation frame:
    -   Avoid object allocation, prefer mutation where safe.
    -   Prefer `for` loops over `forEach` or `map` etc.
    -   Avoid `Object.entries`, `Object.values` etc as these create new objects.
-   Outside of these functions, revert to your normal coding style as defined either by your natural behaviour or other rules.
-   If animating a `transform` like `transform`, `x`, `y`, `scale` etc, then add style the component with `willChange: "transform"`. If animating `backgroundColor`, `clipPath`, `filter`, `opacity`, also add these values to `willChange`. Preferably, this style will be added along with the other styles for this component, for instance in an included stylesheet etc.
-   **Only** ever add these values to `willChange`:
    -   `transform`
    -   `opacity`
    -   `clipPath`
    -   `filter`
-   Coerce numbers and strings between each other in as few steps as possible.

## Principles


-   Prefer `will-change`/`willChange` over `transform: translateZ(0)`. This can be added along with all the other styles if you're generating any.
