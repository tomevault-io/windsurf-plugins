# EffectTS Code Style Guidelines

## Import Style

- Use named imports with curly braces: `import { Effect, Console, Duration } from "effect"`
- Import the `pipe` utility from the main "effect" package
- Import platform-specific modules from their respective packages: `import { NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node"`
- Group related imports together (e.g., keep all Effect imports in one statement)

## Code Structure and Organization

- Prefer generator syntax using `Effect.gen` for sequential operations
- Use `yield*` within generators to invoke effects and bind their results
- Avoid excessive nesting with pipes
- Structure code in a linear, sequential flow for better readability
- Use the `.pipe()` method for pipeline building: `Effect.succeed("task").pipe(Effect.delay("200 millis"))`
- Create helper functions that return Effect values for reusable operations

## Function Implementation Pattern

- Favor generators over "do simulation" and plain pipes for complex operations
- For multi-step operations, use the progression (from most to least preferred):
  1. `Effect.gen` with generators (most recommended)
  2. Plain pipe (least preferred due to nesting)
  3. "Do simulation" with `Effect.Do.pipe`
- Choose the right approach based on operation complexity
- Define small, focused utility functions that operate on effects

## Promise Interoperability

- Use `Effect.promise` to wrap JavaScript Promises in Effect values
- Handle Promise rejections properly through Effect's error channel
- Avoid mixing raw Promise handling with Effect operations
- Always provide explicit error handling for Promise-based operations

## Concurrency Control

- Use `Effect.all` for operating on arrays of effects with concurrency control
- Be explicit about concurrency options when using parallel operations
- Default to sequential execution when order matters
- Use the appropriate concurrency model based on the use case:
  - Sequential (default): One after another
  - Bounded concurrency: Specify a number for maximum concurrent tasks
  - Unbounded: Use "unbounded" for maximum parallelism
  - Inherit: Use "inherit" to inherit concurrency settings from parent

## Time and Duration

- Use the `Duration` module for time-related values instead of raw milliseconds
- Express durations as string literals for readability: `"200 millis"`, `"5 seconds"`
- Use `Duration.toMillis()` to convert to numeric values when needed
- Prefer Effect's timing utilities over raw JavaScript setTimeout/setInterval

## Avoiding Tacit Usage

- Write functions explicitly: `Effect.map((x) => fn(x))`
- Avoid point-free style: `Effect.map(fn)`
- Don't use `flow` from the `effect/Function` module
- Be explicit to ensure proper type inference and clearer stack traces
- Use explicit parameters even when functions could be passed directly

## Application Entry Points

- Use platform-specific `runMain` instead of `runPromise` for production applications
- Select the appropriate runtime for your platform:
  - Node.js: `NodeRuntime.runMain` from `@effect/platform-node`
  - Bun: `BunRuntime.runMain` from `@effect/platform-bun`
  - Browser: `BrowserRuntime.runMain` from `@effect/platform-browser`
- Ensure proper resource cleanup with graceful shutdown support

## Error Handling

- Place teardown logic in the main effect for proper resource release
- Use `Effect.addFinalizer` for cleanup operations
- Ensure graceful teardown when applications are interrupted
- Handle errors at the appropriate level of abstraction

## Type Safety

- Use explicit type annotations when inference is insufficient
- Avoid type assertions when possible
- Leverage Effect's built-in error handling with proper typing
- Define custom error types for domain-specific errors

## Logging and Debugging

- Structure complex operations to make logging and tracing easier
- Log the start and completion of long-running tasks
- Consider wrapping logging in Effect operations for better composition

## Performance Considerations

- Follow Effect's patterns for resource management
- Use appropriate scheduling mechanisms
- Implement proper cancellation and interruption handling
- Optimize for both readability and performance
- Choose the appropriate concurrency model for your use case

## Testing

- Write tests that validate both success and failure paths
- Use Effect's testing utilities for effect-based code, especially the `@effect/vitest` library
- Test interruption handling and resource cleanup
- Verify correct concurrency behavior in multi-task scenarios
