# AGENTS.md

This example is a full contract surface for ota.

- use `ota validate` to verify the contract before relying on it
- use `ota doctor` to inspect readiness and surface the primary blocker
- use `ota workflows` to inspect the declared repo paths before picking one
- use `ota up --workflow app` for the canonical container-backed app path
- use `ota run test` to exercise the main verification path
- keep edits inside the declared writable paths: `src`, `docs`
- avoid casual edits to `ota.yaml`
- rerun the verification task after changes
