# Agent entry point

For requests to search, collect, download, resume, or verify literature, read [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) and use its workflow. Resolve script paths from the repository root. Do not start a download unless requested.

For code changes, retain the CSV schema shared by search and download. Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `npm run check`, and `npm test` when relevant. Keep generated archives, credentials, and browser profiles out of version control.
