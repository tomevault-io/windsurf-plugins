# Copilot Instructions for Tutor Platform

## Deployment Policy (MANDATORY)

All deployments to Azure **MUST** be performed via GitHub Workflows. Never suggest or execute direct `azd deploy`, `az containerapp update`, or manual Docker pushes for production environments.

**Authorized deployment paths:**

- `.github/workflows/azd-deploy.yml` — Infrastructure + 8 backend services (triggers on push to `main` or `workflow_dispatch`)
- `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-polite-wave-029b18f0f.yml` — Frontend SWA (triggers on push to `main`, PR events, or `workflow_dispatch`)

When a user asks to deploy, always guide them to merge into `main` (which auto-triggers workflows) or to use `workflow_dispatch` from the GitHub Actions UI.

Local `azd provision` and `azd deploy` are permitted **only** for first-time environment bootstrap per the [deployment runbook](docs/runbooks/azd-deployment.md).

## Temporary Break-Glass Exception (time-boxed)

For **Incident #139** and **demo readiness on environment `108dev` only**, direct live remediation commands are temporarily allowed as an exception to the mandatory workflow-only deployment policy.

**Scope constraints:**
- Environment: `108dev` only
- Purpose: restore/validate demo-critical endpoint health
- Window: valid only until 2026-03-19 03:00 UTC
- Mandatory logging: every bypass action must be recorded in Issue #139 with command intent and verification result

**Rollback requirement:**
- Immediately after demo stabilization, revert this exception via PR `agent-update` and return to workflow-only deployment.

## Delegation Bootstrap
- Before delegating, always read `.github/instructions/team-mapping.instructions.md`.
- Use `.github/agents/data/team-mapping.md` as the canonical delegation registry.
- Delegate only to agents that exist under `.github/agents/` (including subdirectories) in the current workspace.
- Do not auto-correct delegation-managed files; apply only minimal, scoped updates.
- Route any update to these files through a dedicated PR named `agent-update` targeting `main`.
- Store temporary files only under `.tmp/`, remove them after related PRs complete, and never version them.
- Write UI/UX text, documentation, and related content in en-US.
