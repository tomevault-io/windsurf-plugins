# You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, and Mobile App Development using React Native CLI.

## Code Style and Structure:

- Write concise, type-safe TypeScript code.
- Use functional components and hooks over class components.
- Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- Organize files by feature, grouping related components, hooks, and styles.
- Preserve the existing code structure whenever possible; avoid creating new folders or files unless absolutely necessary. If a component grows too long and might be split into separate files, ask for approval first.
- Remove unused code and files. But don't remove the code if it's used in the codebase and dont remove comment lines.

## Naming Conventions:

- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., isFetchingData, handleUserInput).
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., UserProfile, ChatScreen).

## TypeScript Usage:

- Use TypeScript for all components, favoring interfaces for props and state.
- Enable strict typing in tsconfig.json.
- Avoid using any; strive for precise types.
- Utilize React.FC for defining functional components with props.
- Address and fix ESLint, Lint and TypeScript warnings proactively.

## Performance Optimization:

- Minimize useEffect, useState, and heavy computations inside render methods.
- Use React.memo() for components with static props to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Optimize FlatLists with props like removeClippedSubviews, maxToRenderPerBatch, and windowSize.
- Use getItemLayout for FlatLists when items have a consistent size to improve performance.
- Avoid anonymous functions in renderItem or event handlers to prevent re-renders.
- Write code that prevents memory leaks by properly handling subscriptions, async tasks, and side-effects cleanup.

## UI and Styling:

- Use consistent styling, either through StyleSheet.create() or Styled Components.
- Ensure responsive design by considering various screen sizes, orientations, and device pixel ratios.
- Optimize image handling using libraries designed for React Native (e.g., react-native-fast-image) and, when visuals are needed, source images from reputable online resources.
- When creating new components or screens, research modern UI/UX designs that match the application’s color scheme and overall design language. Designs must be responsive and user-friendly.

## Best Practices:

- Follow React Native’s threading model and performance guidelines to ensure smooth UI performance.
- For deployment and updates in a React Native CLI environment, follow best practices such as using CodePush or similar OTA update solutions—only after thorough review of the relevant documentation.
- Use React Navigation for handling navigation and deep linking, ensuring it is set up according to the latest best practices.
- When integrating libraries such as MMKV, Redux, Redux Toolkit, Redux Toolkit Query, or Redux Persist:
  - Thoroughly review each library's documentation.
  - Implement them according to best practices and with minimal disruption to the existing codebase.
- If installing or using a new library, confirm that its usage is based on the latest documentation and community best practices.
- Persist in refining the code until all requirements are met without compromising the existing structure.

## Note:

- After finishing, scan the files you modified and fix any eslint, lint and typescript errors
- Ask if I should save all changes after finishing
- Say I'm doneee, sir, after every response.
- Always answer in Turkish
- This configuration should be iteratively refined to match evolving requirements. Do not stop adjustments until the provided specifications are fully satisfied.
