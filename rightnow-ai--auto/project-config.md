# CLAUDE.md, Auto (the AGI compiler)

read this fully before touching code. it records the vision, objects, pipeline, stack, norms, and guardrails we hold this project to. everyone working on the repo follows it.

## what this is

Auto converts interpreted cognition into compiled cognition. today an agent run re-derives its plan token by token on a frontier model: brilliant, expensive, unbounded, unauditable. Auto records that behavior, proves what is secretly symbolic, distills what is not, verifies the result against a behavioral contract, and emits a **cognition binary** that is bounded, reproducible, capability-confined, roughly 1000x cheaper and 100x faster. speech, then writing, then computation, then cognition: the fourth compilation event. the interpreter is model-agnostic by design. it is a frontier LLM today, but nothing in the pipeline assumes that, so the same loop compiles the behavior of whatever sits at tier-0 next, world models included. the end state we are building toward: contracts as executable institutions, the IR as the shared language of cognitive work, binaries as the commodity form of expertise, and a tiered runtime where nothing is ever figured out twice.

## the three objects

1. **`auto`, the compiler.** cli + service. `auto record` (attach to a live agent, capture traces) to `auto compile --contract` (lower to IR, run passes, verify) to `task.cbin`.
2. **the runtime.** tiered execution. tier-1: compiled fast path. tier-0: frontier model as interpreter, for novelty. guards on every compiled entry; guard trip to deopt to tier-0 to capture trace to recompile. the ratchet: every novel solve compiles back down. nothing figured out twice.
3. **the artifact + registry.** `.cbin` = code + small models + kernels + **manifest** (eval scores, cost/latency bounds, capability requirements, full provenance: traces, reference model, eval run ids). content-addressed, sigstore-signed. the manifest is the trust layer, it is never aspirational, only measured.

## pipeline

- **frontend:** trace SDK (python/ts shims, agents live there). records prompts, tool calls, args, results, branch decisions, env reads. plus the contract language: examples + properties + eval sets + budgets. the contract IS the type system.
- **IR (crown jewel):** typed task graph. nodes carry: capability effects (net / fs / exec / secrets / payments), memory effects (read / write / append), uncertainty class (`Deterministic | Probabilistic | Generative`), resource bounds. regions group nodes for extraction. progressive lowering, dialect-style, MLIR-inspired in design, custom-built (MLIR's machinery is tensor-shaped; this is effect-shaped). stable ids, versioned schema. whoever owns the IR owns the layer, so the spec is written for the world: `spec/ir.md`.
- **passes:**
  1. *symbolic extraction*, LLM-guided CEGIS on regions traces prove deterministic. most agent behavior is secretly a parser; this is where the 100x lives. candidates verified in sandboxes against traces.
  2. *distillation*, residual fuzzy nodes to small specialists (0.5–3b, or plain gradient boosting when it wins). automated train/eval/accept loop. accept only on measured parity.
  3. *verification*, the contract is the type checker. differential testing vs the reference frontier model, statistical acceptance bounds, property fuzzing. failing contract blocks emit. no exceptions.
  4. *optimization*, semantic caching, speculative execution, quantization, kernel-level work later.
- **backend:** wasm component model + onnx/gguf. wasi capabilities ENFORCE the effect system at runtime, a binary physically cannot exceed its declared capabilities. confinement lives in the artifact.
- **runtime:** guards = embedding-distance OOD + conformal prediction (calibrated abstention). a wrong "stay compiled" decision is a silent correctness failure, guards are a first-class component, never an afterthought.

## stack

- core (compiler, passes, runtime, registry, cli): **rust**. workspace, edition 2024.
- IR serialization: **flatbuffers** (byte-stable round-trip is a hard invariant).
- traces: otel-compatible SDK semantics to local parquet/sqlite first; clickhouse when volume demands.
- synthesis sandbox: **wasmtime** (no network inside sandboxes, ever).
- distillation: pytorch pipeline; serve via onnx-runtime / candle / llama.cpp inside the binary.
- property testing: **proptest**. golden files for every IR construct.
- signing: sigstore. registry content-addressed.
- sdks: plain python + typescript packages first; pyo3/napi bindings later.
