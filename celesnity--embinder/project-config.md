# CLAUDE.md - Embinder operating rules

You are working on **Embinder**: a WebMCP-native SDK that lets an AI agent drive a
web app through declared tools, with a **server-side human approval gate** and a live
action **spotlight**. Monorepo (npm workspaces): `@embinder/relay` (MCP server + gate),
`@embinder/react` (app SDK), `apps/todo` (reference app).

## Before you write any code (every session)

1. Read **`claude-progress.md`** -> "Current Verified State". That is the single source of truth.
2. Read **`feature_list.json`**. Pick up the one feature already `in_progress`, or the lowest
   `priority` number that is `not_started`. Never start a second feature while one is in progress.
3. Run the baseline: **`.\init.ps1`** (install + typecheck + e2e). If it is not GREEN, STOP and
   fix the baseline first - do not build on a red baseline.

## How to work

- **One feature at a time.** Set exactly one feature to `in_progress` in `feature_list.json`.
- Stay inside the selected feature's scope. If you find unrelated issues, note them in
  `claude-progress.md` "Known risks" - do not fix them in the same session.
- Match the existing code: TypeScript, ESM, Zod raw-shape input schemas, per-session `McpServer`.
  Risk is authoritative in `embinder.policy.json` (`read`/`write` pass, `destructive` pauses,
  unknown tools deny-by-default) - `destructiveHint` from the app is only a default.
- Prefer the headless proof over manual clicking: `npm run e2e` exercises the full wire protocol.

## Standard paths (this host: Windows, node 24, PowerShell)

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Startup harness | `.\init.ps1` |
| Install | `npm install` |
| Verify (baseline) | `npm run typecheck` then `npm run e2e` |
| Run the app | `npm run dev`  (relay :7331 + todo :5173) |
| Approvals surface | http://127.0.0.1:7331/approve |

## Definition of done (the most important section)

A feature is `passing` ONLY when ALL of these hold - no exceptions:

1. **It matches the target behavior** in the feature's `user_visible_behavior`.
2. **You ran the verification** in that feature's `verification` steps on THIS host, and it passed.
3. **Evidence is recorded** in the feature's `evidence` field: the exact command run and the
   real output (e.g. "npm run e2e -> 17/17 PASS, E2E + GATE GREEN"). Do not paste claims you
   did not produce this session - do not inherit `BUILD_STATUS.md`'s numbers as your own.
4. `npm run typecheck` is still **exit 0** across all workspaces.
5. **`claude-progress.md` is updated** with a new session record.

If you cannot produce evidence, the feature is not `passing`. Mark it `in_progress` or `blocked`
with the reason, and record what verification is still owed.

## End of session (clean state)

- `.\init.ps1` still GREEN (or the blocker is written down in `claude-progress.md`).
- `feature_list.json` reflects reality - no false `passing` entries.
- No half-finished, unrecorded work. The next session can continue from repo artifacts alone.
- Do not commit unless asked. `audit.jsonl` and `.grabmycursor/` are gitignored runtime output.
