# Procoder

You are working in a repository governed by Procoder — a harness that
gives AI coders the tools and discipline of a senior developer. The
`procoder` binary computes; you act. It never modifies code behind your
back, and a file it could not check is never reported as clean.

## The contract

- Before calling any work finished, run `procoder check` — the commit
  gate. Blocking findings (unformatted files, conflict markers, junk,
  secrets, attribution lines) must be fixed, not argued with.
- `procoder format <file>` prints the formatted result; you review and
  write it. The binary never touches the file.
- Never add AI-attribution lines (Co-Authored-By, "generated with") to
  commits or PRs — `procoder scrub` verifies.
- Deliberate corner-cuts carry a `debt:` comment naming the ceiling and
  the revisit condition; `procoder debt` harvests the ledger.
- Specs live in `.procoder/specs/`, plans in `.procoder/plans/`, tasks
  in `.procoder/todo/` — each has a quality controller (`spec check`,
  `plan check`, `todo close`) that blocks until the work is actually
  complete. Do not game the checkboxes; the controllers ask for evidence.
- Run `procoder test` before claiming anything works. NOT run is never
  green. Where `[test] policy = "block"`, the closes refuse on a red or
  unverifiable suite.

## The work chain

Non-trivial work starts above the code, and each link refuses to advance
until its own gap is closed.

- `procoder spec <sub>` — `template <name> | list | check` in
  `.procoder/specs/`. Check blocks while a section is empty, an `OPEN:`
  question is unresolved, or a criterion is untestable.
- `procoder plan <sub>` — `template | list | check` in
  `.procoder/plans/`. Check blocks on placeholders and on tasks without
  files or steps. Write the plan for a stranger; never say "same as
  task N".
- `procoder backlog <sub>` — the project layer in `.procoder/backlog/`:
  `milestone | epic | story | bug | seed <spec> | list | board | close`.
  Seed decomposes a COMPLETE spec into an epic and its stories. Story
  closes carry todo rigor; epic and milestone closes refuse while a
  child is open.
- `procoder sprint <sub>` — `open`, `pull`, `carry`, `status`, `close`.
  One active sprint at a time. Close refuses while a committed story is
  neither done nor carried back with a reason, and scaffolds the retro
  the next `open` requires.
- `procoder todo <sub>` — `add | list | show | close`. The standalone
  list for work not born from a spec; `close` refuses without checked
  criteria, recorded evidence, and a clean gate.
- `procoder adr <sub>` — `new <title> | list | check` in
  `.procoder/adr/`. Records are immutable: a changed mind supersedes,
  never rewrites. Check refuses hollow records and dangling supersedes.
- `procoder release [<version>]` — the pre-tag controller: version sync
  across `[release] files`, the changelog entry, a clean tree, the
  gate, and the suite. It prints the `git tag` command; it never tags.

## Build principles

Climb this ladder and stop at the first rung that holds: does it need to
exist at all → does this codebase already have it → stdlib → platform →
an installed dependency → one line → only then the minimum code that
works. The ladder runs AFTER you understand the problem — read every
file the change touches first. Bug fix = root cause: find every caller
before editing. Never simplify away input validation, error handling
that prevents data loss, security, or accessibility. Non-trivial logic
leaves one runnable check behind. A repo overrides these wholesale with
`.procoder/PRINCIPLES.md` (`procoder principles` prints the effective
text).

## The toolbox

- `procoder doctor` / `procoder init` — which tools this repo needs and
  how to install the gaps.
- `procoder index <sub>` — the code map: find, search, refs, outline,
  callers, impact, unused, entrypoints. Reach for it before grepping.
- `procoder lint [--types]` / `security [--deep]` / `ci` / `infra` /
  `docs [--external]` / `maintain` — the domain reports; blocking beats
  advisory, honesty beats convenience.
- `procoder test [--coverage]` — every detected ecosystem's canonical
  runner. Coverage is reported, never enforced.
- `procoder bench [--save]` — Go benchmarks against the saved baseline
  (`.procoder/bench/baseline.txt`); regressions past `[bench] threshold`
  exit 1. Go only in this version. `--save` is a deliberate decision.
- `procoder deps` — outdated dependencies per ecosystem, licenses where
  a tool exists. Report-only: the judgment stays yours.
- `procoder audit` — the whole-tree onboarding sweep for a repo procoder
  has not governed before.
- `procoder git` and `procoder templates` — pre-finish status and the
  repo's template files under `.procoder/`.
- `procoder agents` — the per-host rule files derived from this file.
  Regenerate after editing it; drift blocks the gate.
- `procoder lessons` — the ledger of what escaped the gates. A lesson
  with no adaptation is UNLEARNED and exits 1.
- `procoder hook post-tool-use` — the write hook's entry point, wired by
  the plugin. You do not call it by hand.
- `procoder version` — the version, when a report needs to name it.
