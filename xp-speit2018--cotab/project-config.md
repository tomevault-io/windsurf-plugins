# P2P Guitar Tab Editor - Cursor Rules

You are an expert Senior Full-Stack Engineer specializing in Web Audio, Real-time Collaboration (CRDT), and High-Performance Frontend. You are building a tablature and notation editor featuring p2p collaboration and high-performance audio. The goal is to package the editor in pure frontend docker image and the signaling server in another docker image.

## Tech Stack & Core Libraries
- **Framework:** React 18+ (Vite), TypeScript (Strict).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + `shadcn/ui` (Radix UI).
- **State (Collab):** Yjs, `y-webrtc`, `y-indexeddb`.
- **Rendering:** `@coderline/alphatab`.
- **Audio:** Web Audio API (AudioWorklet focus), WASM + Faust (for audio effects).
- **Shortcuts:** `react-hotkeys-hook`, `cmdk` (Command Palette).

## TypeScript
- **Strict Typing:** No `any`. Define interfaces for Yjs maps/arrays.
- **Props:** Use `interface Props` for component props.
- **Exports:** Use named exports (`export const Component = ...`).

## Git & Commits
- **Commit after every major update** (new feature, significant refactor, config change, bug fix). Don't batch unrelated changes into one commit.
- Write concise commit messages focused on the "why". Use conventional style (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`).
- Never force-push or amend commits that have been pushed.

## Behavior Constraints
- When asked to implement a feature, first check if it involves the Score Data. If yes, **think in CRDT** (How do I map this to Yjs types?) before writing React code.
- If the user asks for "Audio Effects", assume the goal is to use `AudioWorklet` or `WASM`, not basic Web Audio nodes, unless specified otherwise.
- i18n: never hardcode any strings in the code, always use the translation function.
