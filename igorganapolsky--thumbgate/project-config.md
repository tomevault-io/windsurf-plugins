# ThumbGate

Pre-action gates that stop AI coding agents from repeating known mistakes.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx thumbgate init
```

This installs the MCP server and wires it into your agent's tool configuration. No API keys required for the free tier.

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g thumbgate
thumbgate init
```

### MCP Configuration

Add to your agent's MCP config (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json` or `.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thumbgate": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "thumbgate"]
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### Feedback Capture

When an agent action succeeds or fails, capture structured feedback:

- **Thumbs up**: Records what worked, tags it, and stores it as a reusable pattern.
- **Thumbs down**: Records the failure context, what went wrong, and what to change. Repeated failures auto-promote into prevention rules.

### Prevention Rules

After a failure pattern repeats (default: 2 occurrences), ThumbGate auto-generates a prevention rule. These rules are injected into agent context before every tool call, blocking the known-bad pattern before it executes.

### Pre-Action Gates

Gates intercept tool calls via the MCP PreToolUse hook. Each gate checks the proposed action against:

1. Prevention rules generated from past failures
2. Thompson Sampling confidence scores (adaptive sensitivity)
3. LanceDB vector similarity to known-bad patterns

If a match is found, the gate blocks execution and surfaces the prior failure context.

### Context Packs

Bounded retrieval of relevant feedback history for the current task. The agent gets exactly the lessons that matter, not the entire history.
