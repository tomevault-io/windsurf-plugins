This repo is for implementing the card game Buraco, it has two folders, the backend which implements the logic for the game and the frontend that implements the functionalities.

The main goal of this project is to create a plataform to play the game online but also to test RL models to play the game.

Therefore the backend must be implemented in python using FastAPI + websockets and the frontend must use React + PixiJS.

Your task is to start building this repo from the ground up, the backlend is already initated your tasks are:

- Search about the rules of the game and write instructions in a file called INSTRUCTIONS.md it must be clear and concise
- Init the frontend (use tailwindcss typescript)
- Create Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend
- Create a docker-compose file to run both backend and frontend
- Create a basic FastAPI app that serves a simple "Hello World" endpoint on top of my existing template of backend code
- Create a github actions for deploying the frontend as a Github Page
- Create a github actions for creating the docs for the backend using mkdocs and deploying it to a gh-pages branch
- Create a GEMINI.md file for each folder exmplaining how to implement the game logic and the frontend logic

## Additional instructions for the code

Focus on a good documentation and well structured code. Methods files and classes must have docstrings. Also add type hints to all methods and functions. Use dataclasses in python and scoped.
