# Skill Discovery

Use the Grep tool to scan all skill descriptions:

```
Grep pattern="^description:" glob=".agents/skills/*/SKILL.md" output_mode="content"
```

## Instructions

1. Run the Grep search above to get all skill descriptions from YAML frontmatter.
2. If the user provided a search term ($ARGUMENTS), filter to skills whose name or description matches.
3. If no search term was provided, display the full list organized by category prefix:
   - `mat-`: Materials science
   - `ml-`: Machine learning / MLIPs
   - `drug-`: Drug discovery
   - `chem-`: Chemistry / molecular
   - `general-`: General utilities
4. Present results as a clean table: skill name and description.
5. If the user wants to run a skill, read its full `SKILL.md` at `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and follow the numbered instructions step by step.
