# gctree Codex integration snippet

- Treat the active gctree branch as a **gc-branch** when you describe it to users.
- gctree init installs SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks that auto-check gc-tree before work.
- Before starting ANY codebase task — new feature, schema change, bug fix, admin work, or any question about how something works — run `gctree resolve` first. Do not assume you know the domain from code alone. Field names, model names, repo names, and feature names are NOT self-explanatory; always verify workflows and cross-repo relationships via gc-tree before touching code.
- Follow this scope-aware protocol before any grep, file read, or code exploration:
  1. Always run `gctree resolve --query "<task or term>"` first. If matched, use the result directly.
  2. Only if the current repo scope is **included** (not unmapped/excluded): if step 1 found nothing, try broader related queries to check if the concept exists in any doc.
  3. If the concept exists in a doc but was not indexed → propose adding it as an Index Entry to that doc.
  4. If it does not exist anywhere → decide whether a new doc is needed and propose it to the user.
  — If the repo is **unmapped** or **excluded**: do step 1 only; if no match, skip and proceed normally.
- When a UserPromptSubmit hook provides `[gc-tree] USE FIRST`, treat matched docs as mandatory grounding before any tool use.
- Do not ignore matched gc-tree docs and jump straight to grep/Explore. Use the listed docs directly, or open the full doc with `gctree resolve --id <id>` if the summary is not enough.
- Only use tools after the matched docs are clearly insufficient for the task.
- If hooks are unavailable or clearly stale, run `gctree status` and `gctree resolve --query "<task>"` yourself before planning or implementation.
- Use `$gc-onboard` only for an empty gc-branch.
- Use `$gc-update-global-context` when durable context in the active gc-branch should change.
