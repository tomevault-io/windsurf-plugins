Read `AGENTS.md` for this workspace's source boundaries and boot invariants.
Skills are shared through `.cursor/skills/` → `.ai/skills/`; prompts are in
`.ai/prompts/`. Use `scripts/env.sh` for paths, and `.ci/README.md` /
`.ai/README.md` for build/CI and agent wiring.
Preserve current GPU rendering and user data when changing build configuration.
Track `qemu/` + `thirdparty/` sources and this variant’s `*.img`; ignore only
compile products under `out/` / `prebuilts/` / `dist/`.
