## 🔴🔴🔴 GROUND RULE: NEVER USE NOHUP. NEVER USE A DAEMON. ALWAYS USE CLOUDCITY-BOOT.app + SYSTEMS.yaml 🔴🔴🔴

**On the Mac Mini (`cloudcity`), the ONLY acceptable way to RUN any long-lived process is Cloudcity-Boot.app driven by `systems.yaml` (`convey/systems.yaml`).**

- **NEVER** `nohup` anything — not a worker (e.g. `fm-worker`/`fm-service`), not a daemon, not a "bounded probe," not as a `timeout` substitute. macOS lacking `timeout` is NOT an excuse.
- **NEVER** start a background daemon, `launchd`/LaunchAgent, SSH-launched `&` process, or any "leave it running" process. SSH-launched daemons don't persist — proof it's the wrong tool.
- **ALWAYS** run via **Cloudcity-Boot.app** (visible iTerm panes, crash-only `while-true` wrappers + guardians) generated from **`systems.yaml`**. Add/change a service: edit `systems.yaml`, regenerate/edit the applet, restart via **`!pk cloudcity restart`** (Discord / file-drop `~/work/comms/queue/pakettibot-inbox/`). Never `open Cloudcity-Boot.app` over SSH. Restart a wedged worker the same way — let Boot relaunch its pane.
- **Acceptable Mini commands are exactly two kinds:** (1) Cloudcity-Boot + `systems.yaml` to run/restart; (2) client calls + read-only inspection (`fm-submit`, `convey`, `cat`, `ls`, `ps`, `git -C <abs>`) — **no `&`, no `nohup`**; bound any probe *inside the process* (`asyncio.wait_for`), never a backgrounded killer loop.

**Why (2026-06-12):** while debugging wedged FM I repeatedly `nohup`'d `fm-worker`/`fm-service` and bounded read-only probes with `nohup … & kill`. Robust wins over brittle. Companions: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `comms/CLAUDE.md`, `convey/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/skills/cloudcity/skill.md`.

## 🔴 GROUND RULE: EVERY APP SHIPS THE SHARED HELP + DONATE PANEL

**Every Apple-native app we make — Guidance, Fleet, Converse, Recburn, AppleToolbox, and every future one — ships the SAME Help, which is the SAME set of ways to donate to Esa.** Do not write a per-app Help or per-app donation list. There is one component and one canonical link list.

- **Component:** `shared/SupportHelp.swift` — `SupportLinks` (the ONE donation list), `AppHelpView(appName:tagline:usage:note:)`, `SupportEsaView`, `AppHelpCommand(appName:)`, and `Notification.Name.showAppHelp`. Change the donation methods HERE, once — never fork them into an app.
- **Canonical donation links** (verified from `rbi-esa.md` + Paketti promo notes; do not invent others): GitHub Sponsors, PayPal, Ko-fi, Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee, Paketti/Gumroad, Lackluster Bandcamp, HLER Bandcamp.
- **Wire-in recipe (3 steps) for any SwiftUI app:**
  1. `build.sh`: compile the shared file → `xcrun swiftc … YourApp.swift ../shared/SupportHelp.swift …`
  2. App scene: `.commands { AppHelpCommand(appName: "YourApp") }` (gives a working Help ▸ YourApp Help + ⌘?, replacing the broken default).
  3. Root view: `@State private var showHelp = false`; a `?` toolbar button with `.popover(isPresented: $showHelp) { AppHelpView(appName: "YourApp", tagline: "…", usage: […], note: …) }`; and `.onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: .showAppHelp)) { _ in showHelp = true }` so the menu item and the button open the same panel.
- **Reference implementations:** `guidance/Guidance.swift` and `fleet/Fleet.swift` (both wired 2026-07-05).
- Established 2026-07-05 at Esa's instruction: *"make this a global Help. from now on, every app we make … they all have the same Help → i.e. same method of donating."*

## Session start

On the first turn in this repo, invoke the `apple` skill via the Skill tool before responding.

When the user says *"what's left"* / *"continue"* / *"boot up Apple skill"*: read the `🎯 Action queue` section at the top of `TODO.md`, separate items blocked-on-physical-action from items pickable unattended, surface those. Don't dump the whole TODO.md.

## Active work fronts (state as of 2026-05-07)

- **Sal archive recovery** — 235 of 359 download/media targets recovered, 3 dead URLs remaining. Sal replied 2026-04-03; hidden `dictationcommands/` subsite mirrored; CitrusPeel255.zip recovered.
- **Sal interview/article discovery** — `bin/sal-discover-interviews.py` probes 17 sources; pass 2 found 159 hits (16 YouTube interviews, 24 Apple Podcasts episodes, 75 cmddconf.com Wayback snapshots).
- **Transcription pipeline** — Track A: `bin/sal-transcribe-youtube.sh` submits via `whisp-submit`. Track B: `bin/sal-resolve-podcast-mp3s.py` resolves Apple Podcasts → MP3 → `bin/sal-transcribe-podcasts.sh`. Runbook: `analysis/sal/transcription-pipeline.md`. Trigger: `!pk cloudcity bash <script>` from Discord.

## Commit + push policy

- Commit logical groupings, not all-at-once dumps.
- Push immediately after committing — don't accumulate unpushed commits.
- HEREDOC commit messages for clean multi-paragraph wording.
- Always include `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
