# CLAUDE.md — WebMux

## Project Conventions (from ai-template)

### Project Structure

Every project MUST have the following top-level directories and files:

- `tests/` — All test files go here (not scattered in `src/__tests__/`, `lib/test/`, etc.)
- `docs/` — All documentation goes here (architecture, setup guides, API docs, etc.)
- `README.md` — Unique to this project (see README section below)
- `Makefile` — With at least the required targets (see Makefile section below)
- `LICENSE` — Project license file

### README.md

Every project README must be **unique to the project** — not the generic ai-template README.
When creating or rewriting a README for a new project:

1. Write a project-specific README covering: what it is, features, quick start, configuration, development, and deployment.
2. **Include the PROVENANCE origin story.** Use the PROVENANCE skill (`skills/PROVENANCE.md`) to write a new chapter in the "Totally True and Not At All Embellished History" chronicle. This is mandatory for every AI-assisted project. The origin story goes near the end of the README, before the License section.
3. Follow the full PROVENANCE checklist: determine the next Part number, update the previous Part's forward links and project count, write the new chapter, and update the chronicle table in `skills/PROVENANCE.md`.

If the README still contains the generic ai-template text ("All skills and AI template files required to implement any of my repositories"), it has not been customized yet — fix it.

### Makefile

Every project MUST have a top-level `Makefile` with at least these targets:

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make` / `make all` | Default build (install deps + compile/bundle) |
| `make start` | Build and start the application |
| `make stop` | Stop the running application |
| `make restart` | Stop then start |
| `make test` | Run all tests |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts, deps, generated files |

Additional targets (`lint`, `status`, `configure`, `help`, etc.) are encouraged but not required.

### Testing

- **All tests MUST go in the `tests/` directory** at the top level of the repository.
- **Code coverage must be at least 70%.** When writing new code, write tests to cover it. When modifying existing code, check coverage and add tests if it falls below 70%.
- **All tests must pass before push.** Do not push code with failing tests. Run `make test` and verify before any push.
- Test files should mirror the source structure (e.g., `webmux/server/internal/session/broker_test.go` for the Go session package).
- Use the project's existing test framework (Jest, Vitest, pytest, etc.) — do not introduce a second test runner.

### Code Quality

- Write safe, secure code. Follow OWASP top-10 guidelines.
- Do not introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.).
- Keep solutions simple. Do not over-engineer.
- Do not add features, refactoring, or "improvements" beyond what was requested.

### Skills

Reusable AI prompt templates live in `skills/`. See `skills/README.md` for the index.
When a skill applies to the current task, use it. Key skills:

- **PROVENANCE** — Write the project origin story chapter (mandatory for every new project)

## WebMux-Specific Notes

- The application source lives under `webmux/` (Go server + frontend workspace).
- Backend: Go HTTP/WebSocket server with Unix PTYs and Windows ConPTY. Frontend: React + xterm.js (TypeScript, Vite).
- Runtime configuration is YAML-based under `WEBMUX_HOME/config/` (default `~/.config/webmux/config/`); `webmux/config.defaults/` contains first-run templates.
- The top-level `Makefile` delegates to `npm` scripts inside `webmux/`.


## GitHub Workflow

Public work enters through GitHub Issues and pull requests. Maintainers use [mac](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/mac) for internal task tracking and work dispatch. This repository does not use beads.

### Quick Reference

```bash
gh issue list                         # Find available work
gh issue view <number>                # View issue details
gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me
gh pr create --fill                   # Open a pull request
gh pr checks                          # Verify CI
```

### Rules

- Track planned work and follow-ups in GitHub Issues.
- Work on a branch and submit changes through a pull request instead of pushing feature work directly to `main`.
- Reference the issue in commits and use `Closes #<number>` in the pull request body when appropriate.
- Run relevant tests, linters, and builds before opening a pull request, and merge only after required checks pass.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
