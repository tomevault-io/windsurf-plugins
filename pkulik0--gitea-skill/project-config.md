- The skill file is `skills/gitea/SKILL.md` -- this is the only required file
- Reference docs go in `skills/gitea/references/` -- these are loaded on demand
- Scripts go in `skills/gitea/scripts/` -- these must be executable
- Do NOT add a `README.md` inside `skills/gitea/` -- repo-level README only
- Keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words; move detail to references/
- All `tea` commands must be accurate for tea v0.15+
- No XML angle brackets in SKILL.md frontmatter
- Folder name must match the `name` field in frontmatter

## For agents USING this skill

The skill is auto-activated when a user mentions Gitea, tea CLI, or asks to manage repos, issues, PRs, releases, actions, or other Gitea resources. Run `tea --version && tea logins ls` to verify setup before executing commands.
