# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, and others) when working in this repository.

## Documentation and Agent Assets

Project documentation lives under `docs/`. Cross-agent workflows and behavior references live under `.agents/`; see `.agents/README.md` for the boundary. Never create standalone `.md` files at the repo root (except this file, `CLAUDE.md`, and `README.md`).

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/TODO.md` | Feature roadmap and checked-off items |
| `docs/ISSUES.md` | Bugs, regressions, and deferred work with status |
| `Pro/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Private Pro architecture index; read only for tasks explicitly scoped to Pro |
| `Pro/docs/REVIEW-TIMELINE.md` | Private Pro roadmap; read only for tasks explicitly scoped to Pro |

## Agent Assets

Shared repository skills live under `.agents/skills/`. This directory is the single source for Codex and OpenCode; Claude Code uses symlinks under `.claude/skills/`.

Before acting on a repository task, read and follow `.agents/references/collaboration-rules.md`, then use `.agents/references/README.md` to load only task-relevant project knowledge. This explicit routing is required because shared references are not platform discovery entry points.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.agents/skills/i18n-completer/SKILL.md` | Scan `Localizable.xcstrings` for missing translations and fill them via the repository scripts while enforcing glossary terminology |
| `.agents/skills/protect-knowledge-boundary/SKILL.md` | Prevent private Pro implementation knowledge from entering public documentation and Agent assets |
| `.agents/skills/verify-build/SKILL.md` | Run the canonical WiFi Lens build and unit-test verification workflow |
| `.agents/references/README.md` | Route tasks to architecture, accessibility, BLE, chart, MCP, regulatory, testing, and windowing references |
| `.agents/references/collaboration-rules.md` | AI assistant behavior rules, enforced prohibitions, and must-follows |

## Edition Documentation Boundary

- Public repository documentation may acknowledge the Pro edition and link to
  documentation in the private `Pro/` submodule.
- Do not copy, summarize, or mirror Pro implementation details into the root
  repository or `.agents/`.
- For work explicitly scoped to Pro, follow `Pro/AGENTS.md` and read the private
  references it routes. Otherwise, do not load Pro documentation.

Use `.agents/skills/protect-knowledge-boundary/` for every documentation or
Agent-asset change that mentions Pro or crosses the root/submodule boundary.

<!-- knowledge-boundary-gate:start -->
Run `.agents/skills/protect-knowledge-boundary/scripts/check_public_knowledge.py` and `.agents/skills/protect-knowledge-boundary/scripts/verify_integrity.py` before completing knowledge-boundary changes.

## Build & Test

```sh
# App — always use xcodebuild, never swift build / swift test
# Build configurations: Debug / Release
xcodebuild -project WiFiLens/WiFiLens.xcodeproj -scheme "WiFi Lens" -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' build
xcodebuild -project WiFiLens/WiFiLens.xcodeproj -scheme "WiFi Lens" -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' -skipPackageUpdates test -only-testing:WiFiLensTests
xed WiFiLens/WiFiLens.xcodeproj                   # open in Xcode GUI

# ChartLens library (standalone Swift Package)
cd ChartLens && swift build                        # build
cd ChartLens && swift test                         # test

# ChartLens Demo app (Xcode project)
xcodebuild -project ChartLensDemo/ChartLensDemo.xcodeproj -scheme "ChartLensDemo" -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' build
xed ChartLensDemo/ChartLensDemo.xcodeproj

# Website — redirect page to wifi-lens.shiinalabs.com (Astro + pnpm, outputs to dist/)
cd web && pnpm install --config.minimum-release-age=0
cd web && pnpm dev                           # dev server at localhost:4321
cd web && pnpm --config.minimum-release-age=0 build
cd web && pnpm preview                       # preview production build
```

The product name is `WiFi Lens.app` (with space). Unit tests use Swift Testing (`@Test`) with `TEST_HOST` — the test bundle is injected into the app process for `@testable import` symbol resolution. All test `.swift` files must be added to the WiFiLensTests target's Sources build phase (in `project.pbxproj`) for `xcodebuild test` to compile and run them. The `WiFiLensTests` scheme must reference the test bundle in both `<Testables>` and `<MacroExpansion>`.

Do not run UI test bundles (`WiFiLensUITests`, `WiFiLensProUITests`) or full scheme test commands that include UI tests unless the user explicitly asks for UI tests. Default verification is build plus `-only-testing:WiFiLensTests`.

When adding new test files, ensure they are:
1. Added as PBXFileReference in project.pbxproj
2. Added to the WiFiLensTests PBXGroup
3. Added as PBXBuildFile (assigned to WiFiLensTests target)
4. Listed in the WiFiLensTests target's Sources build phase (`files = (...)`)
