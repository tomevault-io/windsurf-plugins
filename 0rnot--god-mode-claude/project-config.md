## 🧠 Thinking Rules

1. **Read before write.** Before modifying any file, read it first. Match existing patterns, naming conventions, and code style. Do not introduce new paradigms.
2. **Verify before assuming.** Check actual source files for import paths, function signatures, and type definitions. Never rely on memory or assumptions.
3. **Ask when unsure.** If confidence in understanding the requirement is below 95%, ask clarifying questions before modifying any files. List what you understand and what needs clarification.
4. **Plan before executing.** For tasks touching 3+ files, outline the plan and get approval before making changes.

## 🛡️ Safety Rules

1. **Off-limits files — NEVER modify:**
   - `*.lock` / `*-lock.*` (package lock files)
   - `.env*` (environment/secrets)
   - `src/generated/*`, `prisma/migrations/*`
   - `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `.next/`, `dist/`
2. **Destructive operations require confirmation:**
   - Deleting files or directories
   - Dropping/truncating database tables
   - Force-pushing or modifying CI/CD configs
   - Any operation with `--force` or `sudo`
3. **Never commit secrets.** No API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials in code. Use environment variables.
4. **Handle errors explicitly.** No bare `catch {}` or `except:`. Always catch specific errors with meaningful handling.

## ⚡ Quality Rules

1. **Test everything.** Write tests for new functions. Run the full test suite before AND after changes. If tests fail, fix them before reporting completion.
2. **Keep it small.** Functions: <50 lines. Files: <300 lines. If larger, refactor.
3. **Explicit > clever.** Readable code beats concise code. Name variables descriptively. Avoid nested ternaries and clever one-liners.
4. **One thing per commit.** Each commit addresses one logical change. Use Conventional Commits: `feat|fix|docs|refactor|test|chore(scope): description`.
5. **No dead code.** Don't comment out code "for later." Delete it. Git has history.

## 📦 Output Rules

1. **Be concise.** Show only changed lines with surrounding context. Don't echo back entire files or code the user just showed you.
2. **Diff over dump.** When explaining changes, describe what changed and why — don't reproduce the full file.
3. **Batch related edits.** Group related file changes into a single logical operation. Don't read/write the same file multiple times.
4. **Verify before done.** After implementing, run tests and linting. Only report completion after verification passes.

## 📐 Architecture Notes
<!-- ✏️ CUSTOMIZE: Add your project-specific architecture decisions -->
<!--
Example:
- We use Server Components by default; add 'use client' only for interactivity
- State management: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
- API validation: Zod schemas in src/lib/validators/
- Auth: NextAuth.js v5 with JWT strategy
-->

<!-- 
📏 LINE COUNT CHECK: This file should stay under 200 lines.
    If you need more rules, use .claude/rules/ directory for topic-specific files.
    Current: ~75 lines (excluding comments and blanks)
