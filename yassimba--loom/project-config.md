# skills

A public hub for my favorite agent skills to share with people. Install with `npx skills add` (Vercel)
or through the Claude plugin marketplace.

## Layout

`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — the shared skills, one flat directory per skill.
The category grouping shown by skills.sh lives in `skills.sh.json`, not in
folders. The Claude plugin is the repo root itself: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
plus auto-discovered `skills/`, listed by `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
(`source: "./"`).
`plugins/<name>/` — one flat directory per plugin package: npm workspaces
(Pi extensions, discovered by their `package.json`).
`cli/loom/` — the Rust onboarding CLI installed by the root bootstrap
scripts. `cli/loom/setup-catalog.json` is generated from reviewed skills and opted-in
plugin metadata; the CLI embeds it, copies skills into user-selected agent
trees at global or current-project scope, and delegates Pi package installs
to Pi.
`manifest/loom.toml` — the published tool manifest, the MENU: every
tool this setup can provide, exact-pinned (node, Pi, herdr, gh, the
loom binary, …), with wizard metadata in
`manifest/tools.json`. What lands on a machine is the SELECTION —
`~/.config/mise/conf.d/loom.toml` holds the core block plus
wizard-chosen tools; `loom update` refreshes its pins without changing
the set. Tool versions move only when a manifest change lands on main (the
weekly `mise-bump` PR proposes bumps; release automation owns the
loom pin). The root `mise.toml` is the
contributor dev-env + tasks, a separate file so the consumer manifest never
activates on `cd`. See `ai-docs/adr/0002-distribute-tools-via-mise.md`.
`drafts/` — pulled from a global agent tree, not yet reviewed.
`personal/` — machine-specific skills, not for anyone else. Kept outside
`skills/` so no installer surface (npx, Claude plugin, the CLI) can ever see
them.

## Sync

The repo is the only real copy of each skill. `scripts/sync-skills.sh link`
symlinks `skills/<name>` and `personal/<name>` into the global agent trees
(`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`,
`~/.config/opencode/skills`, `~/.cursor/skills`, and `~/.grok/skills`), so an edit made from
either side is the same file and
syncing means committing. `pull` brings
a diverged or unknown global skill back into the repo (unknown ones land in
`drafts/`), `status` shows the picture, `unlink` materializes a real copy for
testing what installers ship. No command destroys information: link only
replaces dirs proven identical, pull requires a clean git path.

Pi extensions follow the same model. `scripts/sync-pi-extensions.sh link`
discovers the concrete `pi.extensions` entrypoints in `plugins/*/package.json`
and symlinks them into `~/.pi/agent/extensions`. Use `status`, `pull`, and
`unlink` with the same meanings and safety guarantees as the skill sync.
The script skips full Pi packages (ones that also declare `pi.skills` or
`pi.prompts`): those only load correctly through `pi install <path>` package
installs, and a bare extension symlink would drop their skills/prompts and
double-load the extension.

Note: the global `merge` skill is not a rename of `resolving-merge-conflicts`
— it performs a branch merge rather than resolving a conflict in progress.

## Releases

Use Conventional Commits. [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
(`release.yml`, config in `release-please-config.json`) keeps one release PR
per changed component — `cli/loom`, `cli/loom-teams`, `plugins/pi-fast`, `plugins/pi-guardrails` —
with the version bump and changelog. Merging it tags `<component>-vX.Y.Z`,
uploads the binaries, then moves the `manifest/loom.toml` pin to the new tag
and publishes to npm. A skill
change regenerates `cli/loom/setup-catalog.json`, which is what makes it a
loom release. Do not create component tags by hand.

## Quality checks

After finishing code changes (plugins/, scripts/, test/), run
`npm run audit` — it gates on dead code, complexity, and duplication that the
changeset introduced (config in `.fallowrc.json`; `npm run audit:brief` gives
a non-gating orientation report). `npm run check` covers the rest: tests,
tsc, biome lint, catalog, and packaging.

## Rule

Everything under `skills/` is public: npx, the Claude plugin, and the CLI all
discover the flat tree directly. `skills.sh.json` lists shared skills only —
it is the grouping shown by skills.sh, nothing more.

Never move anything from `drafts/` or `personal/` into `skills/` or list it in
`skills.sh.json` without review. All are public install surfaces; drafts are
unreviewed and personal skills hardcode local paths. Promote a draft into
`skills/` first (`sync-skills.sh promote <name>`), then list it.

A skill whose flow invokes another skill (`Run a /grill-me session`, `route
through /diagnosing-bugs`) declares it in a per-skill `deps.yml` next to its
SKILL.md, as a bare skill name, so installers pull deps in transitively (the
catalog generator bakes the graph into `cli/loom/setup-catalog.json` for the CLI).
Declare invocations only — not soft "if installed" mentions or pointers. An
imported skill records immutable provenance in the same file under `upstream`,
with `repository`, repository-relative `path`, and full `commit` SHA; a
