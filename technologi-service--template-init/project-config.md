# Patterns

- Strictly follow the Functional Core, Imperative Shell pattern: separate application logic into two parts: a functional core with pure, side-effect-free functions for business rules and data transformation, and an imperative shell that handles impure actions like database I/O, network requests, or user input, making the core logic easily testable and modular
- Everything is a library: Organize features and domains as self-contained folders in `src/lib/` (e.g., `chat`, `ai`, `db`). Co-locate schema, queries, types, and utilities together. Components go in `components/<feature>/`.
- Use the web platform: Prefer native APIs and standards. Avoid abstractions that hide what the code actually does.

# Coding Guidelines

## Runtime and Package Manager

- Use Bun instead of Node.js, npm, pnpm, or vite.
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`.
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` or `pnpm run <script>`.

## TypeScript

- Avoid `export default` in favor of `export` whenever possible.
- Only create an abstraction if it's actually needed
- Prefer clear function/variable names over inline comments
- Avoid helper functions when a simple inline expression would suffice
- Don't use emojis
- No barrel index files - just export from the source files instead
- No type.ts files, just inline types or co-locate them with their related code
- Don't unnecessarily add `try`/`catch`
- Don't cast to `any`

## React

- Avoid massive JSX blocks and compose smaller components
- Colocate code that changes together
- Avoid `useEffect` unless absolutely needed

## Tailwind

- Mostly use built-in values, occasionally allow dynamic values, rarely globals
- Always use v4 + global CSS file format + shadcn/ui

## Next

- Prefer fetching data in RSC (page can still be static)
- Use next/font + next/script when applicable
- next/image above the fold should have `sync` / `eager` / use `priority` sparingly
- Be mindful of serialized prop size for RSC → child components

## Browser Automation

Use `agent-browser` for web automation. Run `agent-browser --help` for all commands.

Core workflow:

1. `agent-browser open <url>` - Navigate to page
2. `agent-browser snapshot -i` - Get interactive elements with refs (@e1, @e2)
3. `agent-browser click @e1` / `fill @e2 "text"` - Interact using refs
4. Re-snapshot after page changes
