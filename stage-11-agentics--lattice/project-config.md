# Lattice

Stage 11 Agentics' file-based, agent-native task tracker with an event-sourced core.

## Disambiguation: "Lattice" the Codebase vs. "Lattice" the Instance

This project **dogfoods itself**. Two distinct things called "Lattice":

1. **The Lattice source code** — the Python project under `src/lattice/`. This is what `git` tracks.
2. **The `.lattice/` data directory** — a live Lattice instance for tracking dev tasks. Gitignored in this repo (heavy test/dev churn would pollute diffs).

**Rule:** Never confuse changes to `src/lattice/` (source code) with changes to `.lattice/` (instance data). They are independent. Editing source code does not affect the running instance until you reinstall (`uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`).

## Global Tool — Editable Install

The global `lattice` command is installed in editable mode, pointing directly at the source tree:

```bash
uv tool install -e /Users/atin/Projects/Stage11/code/Lattice --force
```

This means **all changes to `src/` are immediately live** — Python code, static files, templates. No rebuild, no publish step, no cache issues. Just edit and run.

The `.pth` file at `~/.local/share/uv/tools/lattice-tracker/` redirects imports to `code/Lattice/src/`. Both `lattice` (bare) and `uv run lattice` read from the same source tree.

**If the editable install ever breaks** (e.g., after moving the repo), reinstall:
```bash
uv cache clean lattice-tracker && uv tool install -e /Users/atin/Projects/Stage11/code/Lattice --force
```

**Note for dashboards:** After editing static files (HTML/JS/CSS), a running dashboard still serves from memory. Restart it to pick up changes (`lattice restart` or stop/start).

## Quick Reference

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Language | Python 3.12+ |
| CLI framework | Click |
| Testing | pytest |
| Linting | ruff |
| Package manager | uv |
| Entry point | `lattice` (via `[project.scripts]`) |

## Key Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ProjectRequirements_v1.md` | Full specification — object model, schemas, CLI commands, invariants |
| `Decisions.md` | Architectural decisions with rationale (append-only log) |
| `docs/architecture/README.md` | Index for all architecture deep dives |

**Read `ProjectRequirements_v1.md` before making any architectural change.**

## Layer Boundaries

- **`core/`** — pure business logic. No filesystem calls.
- **`storage/`** — all filesystem I/O. Atomic writes, locking, directory traversal.
- **`cli/`** — wires core + storage via Click commands. Output formatting.
- **`dashboard/`** — read-only. Reads `.lattice/` files, serves JSON + static HTML.

## Development Setup

```bash
cd lattice
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run ruff format src/ tests/
uv run lattice --help
```

## Dependencies

### Runtime
- `click` — CLI framework
- `python-ulid` — ULID generation
- `filelock` — Cross-platform file locking

### Dev
- `pytest` — testing
- `ruff` — linting and formatting

Minimize dependencies. The dashboard uses only stdlib. Do not add dependencies without justification.

## Coding Conventions

### JSON Output

```python
# Snapshots: sorted keys, 2-space indent, trailing newline
json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True, indent=2) + "\n"

# Events (JSONL): compact separators, one line
json.dumps(event, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":")) + "\n"
```

### Error Handling

- Human-readable errors to stderr, non-zero exit codes.
- `--json` mode: `{"ok": true, "data": ...}` or `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}`.
- Never silently swallow errors.

### Testing

- CLI commands → integration tests (invoke Click, check `.lattice/` state).
- Core modules → unit tests (pure logic, no filesystem).
- Storage → tests with real temp directories (`tmp_path` fixture).

## Where Things Live

- **Task plans** → `.lattice/plans/<task_id>.md`
- **Task notes** → `.lattice/notes/<task_id>.md`
- **Repo `notes/`** — code reviews, retrospectives, working documents NOT tied to a specific task.
- **Repo `docs/`** — user-facing documentation, guides, architecture deep dives.
- **Repo `prompts/`** — prompt templates and implementation checklists.
- **Repo `research/`** — external research, competitive analysis, reference material.
- **Don't duplicate** — a document should live in one place.

## Branching Model

**Two-branch model.**

- **`main`** — development branch. All feature branches merge here.
- **`prod`** — stable release branch. Merges from `main` when a release is ready.
- Feature work: short-lived branches off `main` (`feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `chore/`).
- Conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.).
- Before merging to `main`: all tests pass, ruff clean.
- Before merging to `prod`: same gates + manual confirmation.
- Schema changes: bump `schema_version`, maintain forward compatibility.
- New decisions: append to `Decisions.md`.

## Hosting & Remote

Lattice is a **public project** hosted on **GitHub** (`origin` → `github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/lattice`). Although Stage 11's other projects use Forgejo, Lattice stays on GitHub for public visibility. Push to `origin` (GitHub), not Forgejo.
