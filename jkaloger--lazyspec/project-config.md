description: Use when creating a new document of a configured type at the most manual authorship level -- AI creates the file and frontmatter, surfaces intent and section guidance, then hands the body back to the human.

```
CREATE THE SHELL, HAND THE BODY BACK
```

Scaffold is the floor of the authorship order: AI makes the file and links it, then the human writes the body.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT write the document body. Scaffold creates the file, frontmatter, and links, then surfaces the type's intent and section guidance for the human to fill in.
Read the target type's config from `lazyspec config --json` before creating anything; the type is a parameter, never assumed.
</HARD-GATE>

<NEVER>
- Do NOT hand-edit document files to create or link them. Use `lazyspec create` (seed with `--body`/`--body-file`) and `lazyspec link`. To change body content, use `lazyspec update <id> --body`/`--body-file` -- for EVERY store, filesystem included. (Scaffold itself writes no body; it hands that back to the human.)
- Do NOT edit a document you haven't read. Always `lazyspec show <id> --json` or `Read` first.
- Do NOT skip the workflow pipeline. Respect the configured `parent_type` chain and `rules`.
</NEVER>

<BODY-CONTENT>
Set body at creation: `lazyspec create <type> "<title>" --body "content"` or `--body-file <path>` (`-` reads stdin). Change it later: `lazyspec update <ID> --body "content"` or `--body-file <path>`. Prefer `--body`/`--body-file` over any direct file edit, for ALL stores (filesystem and github-issues alike).
GitHub-issues docs additionally: never edit `.lazyspec/cache/` mirrors (read-only); always reference docs by shorthand ID (e.g. STORY-095), not cache paths.
</BODY-CONTENT>

Always run `lazyspec help <subcommand>` before using unfamiliar commands. Always pass `--json`. On failure, check `--help` before retrying.

## Authorship Ceiling

The authorship order is `scaffold < co-write < generate`. A type's `authorship` value in config (`human`, `assisted`, `generated`) is the *ceiling* -- the highest verb permitted for that type.

Scaffold is the floor of that order, so it is permitted on **every** `authorship` value. **Scaffold never refuses on ceiling grounds.** Even a type whose ceiling is `human` can be scaffolded; that is exactly the manual case scaffold exists for.

## Preflight

1. `lazyspec config --json` -- read the target `<type>` entry: its `intent` (what the doc is for), its `authorship` ceiling (for confirmation only -- scaffold proceeds regardless), its `parent_type`, and the section guidance available from its template.
2. `lazyspec status --json` -- see what already exists and locate the parent document to link to.
3. `lazyspec context --json` -- understand the chain around the user's current position so the new document lands in the right place.

## Workflow

1. **Create the shell:** `lazyspec create <type> "<title>" --author <name>`, where `<type>` is the parameter read from config (e.g. in the shipped default config a type named `rfc`, but never assume that name -- read it).
2. **Link to the parent:** if config gives the type a `parent_type` and a parent exists, `lazyspec link <new-id> implements <parent-id>` -- using the configured relation name from `relationships` (the default config uses `implements`; read it, don't bake it).
3. **Surface intent + guidance:** show the human the type's `intent` from config and the per-section `<!-- guidance -->` comments from the scaffolded body. Tell the human these are the sections to fill in.
4. **Hand back:** stop. The human writes the body. Scaffold does not draft prose.

## Rules

- The `<type>` is always a parameter read from `config --json`. No type name is load-bearing in this prose.
- Scaffold never refuses on ceiling grounds -- it is the floor of `scaffold < co-write < generate`.
- Create and link only; never write the body.
- Read parent/relation/gate facts from config, never from `.lazyspec/` graph files directly.

name: co-write
description: Use when drafting a document of a configured type collaboratively -- AI proposes a draft body, the human edits, iterate -- up to the type's authorship ceiling.
---

```
PROPOSE A DRAFT, THE HUMAN EDITS, ITERATE
```

Co-write is the middle rung: AI scaffolds, then proposes a body toward the type's intent; the human revises and the loop repeats.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT proceed when the target type's `authorship` ceiling is `human` -- that type tops out at scaffold. Read the ceiling from `lazyspec config --json` and refuse, naming the ceiling.
Co-write proposes a draft for human editing; it does not finalise a body unilaterally.
</HARD-GATE>

<NEVER>
- Do NOT hand-edit document files. The CLI is the only writer: `lazyspec create` (seed with `--body`/`--body-file`), `lazyspec link`, and `lazyspec update <id> --body`/`--body-file` to change body content. This holds for EVERY store, filesystem included.
- Do NOT edit a document you haven't read. Always `lazyspec show <id> --json` or `Read` first.
- Do NOT skip the workflow pipeline. Respect the configured `parent_type` chain and `rules`.
</NEVER>
