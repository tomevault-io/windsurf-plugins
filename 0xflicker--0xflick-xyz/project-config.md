# Agent Guide

## Overview

`0xflick_xyz` is a personal portfolio website for Flick (0xflick), built with Next.js 14 App Router, React 18, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The homepage features an interactive Three.js WebGL animation, with content pages for about, projects, resume, and a connect/scheduling page. Production URL: https://www.flick.ing

## Local Setup

1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.
2. Environment files are already provided:
   - `.env.development` — sets `OG_URL=http://localhost:3000` for local OpenGraph metadata.
   - `.env.production` — sets `OG_URL=https://www.flick.ing`.
3. Start the dev server with `yarn dev` (served on `http://localhost:3000`).

## Key Scripts

- `yarn dev` — run the Next.js dev server.
- `yarn build` — production build.
- `yarn start` — serve the production build.
- `yarn lint` — run ESLint (next/core-web-vitals preset).

## Architecture

### Routing

- **App Router only** — all routes live under `src/app/`.
- `/` — WebGL Three.js landing page (full-screen canvas). Falls back to `/~/about` when WebGL is unsupported.
- `/~/about`, `/~/projects`, `/~/cv` — content pages wrapped in a shared layout (`src/app/~/layout.tsx`) that provides the `<Header>`, `<Footer>`, theme provider, and navigation context.
- `/connect` — standalone page for scheduling intro calls, uses its own layout.

The tilde (`~`) prefix in the route path is intentional — it namespaces the portfolio content under a distinctive URL segment.

### Directory Structure

- `src/app/` — Next.js App Router pages and layouts.
- `src/components/` — Shared, reusable UI components (`Header`, `Footer`, `Container`, `Button`, `Card`, `SimpleLayout`, `SocialIcons`, etc.).
- `src/components/three/` — Reusable react-three-fiber components (`Animatable`, `Chevron`, `FitToWidth`, `GridRect`, `GridTunnel`, `ScrollAnimatable`).
- `src/features/home/` — Homepage WebGL experience: Three.js canvas, animation tracks, GLSL shaders, and content overlays.
- `src/hooks/` — Shared React hooks (`useDetectWebgl`, `useNavigationEvent`, `useScroll`).
- `src/shader/` — GLSL shader utilities (`grid`, `outline`).
- `src/lib/` — Utility helpers (`articles`, `formatDate`).
- `src/styles/` — Global styles and Tailwind entry point.
- `src/images/` — Static image assets imported by components.
- `public/` — Public static assets (project screenshots, PDFs, favicons).

### Styling

- **TailwindCSS** is the primary styling approach. Configuration is in `tailwind.config.ts`.
- Brand colors: `brand-light` (#CADCFC) and `brand-dark` (#00246B).
- Dark mode is class-based via `next-themes` with `<ThemeProvider attribute="class">`.
- Global styles in `src/styles/tailwind.css`.

### Three.js / WebGL

- The homepage renders a full-page Three.js scene using `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei`.
- Custom GLSL shaders live in `src/features/home/shaders/` (OpenGL fragment shaders).
- Shader utilities for grid and outline effects are in `src/shader/`.
- WebGL support is detected at runtime via `useDetectWebgl`; unsupported browsers redirect to `/~/about`.
- Mobile detection happens server-side using the `User-Agent` header.

### Context & Theming

- `AppContext` (in `src/app/providers.tsx`) tracks `previousPathname` for navigation transitions.
- `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes` manages light/dark mode with system preference syncing.

## TypeScript

- Strict mode is enabled (`strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`).
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `./src/*`.
- Target: ES2020; module resolution: `bundler`.
- Use explicit type imports: `import type { FC } from "react"`.
- Import hooks and utilities from `react` explicitly, never rely on global `React`.

## Development Practices

- Use functional React components exclusively; no class components.
- Write clean TypeScript — avoid `as any`, `as unknown`, and `"key" in obj` patterns.
- Run `yarn lint` before committing.
- Server components are the default in the App Router. Add `"use client"` only when hooks or browser APIs are needed.
- When working with Three.js components, keep rendering logic in `src/features/home/` or `src/components/three/` as appropriate.

## Deployment

- Deployed on Vercel.
- The `OG_URL` environment variable controls OpenGraph image base URLs and differs between development and production.
