# CLAUDE.md - Apple Mail MCP Server

This file provides guidance for AI agents (Claude, etc.) when using this MCP server.

## Overview

This MCP server enables AI assistants to interact with Apple Mail on macOS via AppleScript. All operations are local - no data leaves the user's machine.

## Critical: Backslash Escaping

**When sending content with backslashes to any tool, you MUST escape them.**

The MCP protocol uses JSON for parameters. In JSON, `\` is an escape character. To include a literal backslash:

| You want    | Send in JSON parameter |
|-------------|------------------------|
| `\`         | `\\`                   |
| `\\`        | `\\\\`                 |
| `C:\Users\` | `C:\\Users\\`          |

### Why This Matters

If you send a single backslash without escaping:

- The JSON parser interprets `\` as an escape sequence
- Invalid sequences like `\ ` (backslash-space) cause silent failures
- The email send/draft may fail with no clear error

### Examples

**Correct - Windows path in email:**

```text
body: "The file is at C:\\Users\\Documents\\report.pdf"
```

**Incorrect - Will fail:**

```text
body: "The file is at C:\Users\Documents\report.pdf"
```

## Tool Usage Tips

### Using Message IDs (Required)

All message operations require an `id` parameter. **Always get IDs first** using `list-messages` or `search-messages`:

```text
# List messages returns IDs
list-messages mailbox="INBOX"
→ Messages with IDs like "12345", "12346", etc.

# Use ID for all subsequent operations
get-message id="12345"
mark-as-read id="12345"
delete-message id="12345"
reply-to-message id="12345" body="Thanks!"
```

### Recipient Arrays

The `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` parameters must always be arrays:

**Correct:**

```json
{
  "to": ["bob@example.com"],
  "subject": "Hello"
}
```

**Incorrect:**

```json
{
  "to": "bob@example.com",
  "subject": "Hello"
}
```

### send-email vs create-draft

- Use `send-email` for immediate sending
- Use `create-draft` when the user should review first
- Both support optional `attachments` parameter (array of absolute file paths)
- **Recommendation**: For important emails, use `create-draft` and tell the user to review in Mail.app

### send-serial-email (mail merge)

- Sends individual personalized emails to a list of recipients
- Use `{{placeholder}}` tokens in subject and body, replaced per-recipient
- Each recipient gets their own email — recipients don't see each other
- Max 100 recipients per batch, delay between sends (default 500ms, max 10000ms)
- Example variables: `{ "Name": "Alice", "Company": "Acme" }`

### reply-to-message

- Set `replyAll: true` to reply to all recipients
- Set `send: false` to save as draft instead of sending immediately
- Default behavior: reply to sender only, send immediately
- Uses `without opening window` internally — no Mail.app compose window is opened, which ensures reliable body delivery from background processes (see [Known Issues](#known-issue-resolved-reply--forward-empty-body-from-background-processes) below)

### forward-message

- Requires message `id` and `to` array
- Optional `body` to prepend a message
- Set `send: false` to save as draft
- Uses `without opening window` internally — same background-process fix as reply-to-message

### Multi-account

- Default account is Mail.app's configured default send account
- `search-messages` searches all accounts when no `account` is specified
- Use `list-accounts` to see available accounts
- Pass `account` parameter to target specific account

## Error Handling

| Error                    | Likely Cause                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| "Mail.app not responding" | Mail.app frozen or not running               |
| "Message not found"      | Message ID is invalid or message was deleted/moved |
| "Permission denied"      | macOS automation permission needed            |
| "Account not found"      | Account name doesn't match exactly (case-sensitive) |
| "Failed to send email"   | Network issue or Mail.app configuration problem |
| Silent failure           | Backslash not escaped in content              |

## Security Considerations

- **Sending emails**: Always confirm with user before sending. Recommend `create-draft` for review.
- **Deleting messages**: Warn user that deletion moves to Trash (can be recovered).
- **Reading emails**: May contain sensitive information - summarize rather than display full content when appropriate.

## Example Workflows

### Check for important emails

```text
1. list-accounts → get available accounts
2. search-messages query="boss@company.com" → find emails from boss
3. get-message id="..." → read the full content
```

### Send a reply safely

```text
1. get-message id="..." → read original message
2. reply-to-message id="..." body="..." send=false → save as draft
3. Tell user to review in Mail.app before sending
```

### Compose and send

```text
1. create-draft to=["recipient@example.com"] subject="..." body="..."
2. Tell user: "I've created a draft. Review it in Mail.app and send when ready."
   OR if user confirms they want to send immediately:
3. send-email to=["recipient@example.com"] subject="..." body="..."
```

### Forward an email

```text
