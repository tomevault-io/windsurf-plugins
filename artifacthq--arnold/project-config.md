## Arnold — Documentation-First Development

This project uses Arnold for doc-centered development.
The `docs/` folder is the source of truth for what this
project should be and how it should behave.

## Before Writing Code

1. Check `docs/` for the relevant feature folder
2. Read the feature overview — understand the rules and flows
3. If docs don't exist for what you're about to build, create them first
4. Check `docs/unknowns.md` — is there an unresolved question that affects this?
5. Check `docs/decisions/` — has a relevant decision already been made?

## After Writing Code

1. If you built something new that isn't documented, note it
2. If you changed behavior described in docs, flag it
3. If you made a significant decision (chose a library, picked an approach),
   create a record in `docs/decisions/`
4. If you discovered something unexpected, add it to the feature's
   edge cases or to `docs/unknowns.md`

## Document Structure

Docs are organized by **feature**, not by document type:

```
docs/
├── overview.md          # Project vision and goals
├── spec.md              # Technical specification (stack, architecture, constraints)
├── status.md            # What's done, in progress, blocked
├── milestones.md        # Phase tracking (if using milestones)
├── [feature-name]/      # One folder per feature
│   ├── [feature-name]-overview.md   # What it does, core rules, acceptance criteria
│   ├── [feature-name]-[flow].md     # Step-by-step user flows
│   └── [feature-name]-edge-cases.md # Error handling and unusual scenarios
├── issues/              # Bug reports (auto-numbered)
│   └── NNN-title.md     # Severity, repro steps, affected feature
├── decisions/           # Why we chose what we chose
│   └── NNN-title.md     # Auto-numbered decision records
├── requests.md          # Feature requests and enhancements
├── unknowns.md          # Open questions and bets
├── archive/             # Stale docs kept for historical record
└── reference/           # Legacy docs, original specs
```

## Conventions

### Feature Folders
- Lowercase, hyphen-separated: `auth/`, `booking/`, `calendar-sync/`
- Named by what the feature IS, not what it does: `auth` not `login`
- Every feature folder has a `[feature]-overview.md` at minimum (e.g., `auth/auth-overview.md`)
- Product requirements are tech-agnostic. Technical decisions live in `docs/spec.md`.
- Feature overviews include acceptance criteria as a baseline, even before flows are written.

### Status Markers
- 🟢 Implemented — working, documented, aligned
- 🟡 In Progress — partially built or partially documented
- 🔵 Not Started — documented but no code yet
- 🔴 Drifted — docs and code don't match (flagged by /arnold:check)
- ❓ Unknown — depends on an unresolved question

### Source Provenance
Track where rules come from:
- **(user-stated)** — the human explicitly said this
- **(domain-derived)** — standard for this kind of application
- **(Arnold-inferred)** — Claude reasoned this should exist
- **(decided)** — deliberate team choice, links to decision record
- **(code-derived)** — extracted from reading the existing codebase

### Decision Records
- Auto-numbered: `001-title.md`, `002-title.md`
- Include: date, who decided, what was chosen, what was rejected, consequences
- Once accepted, decisions are immutable (create a new one to supersede)

### Unknowns
- Each question has an owner and a "decide by" date
- Bets include "risk if wrong" and "how we'll know"
- Resolved questions get moved to the relevant feature doc or a decision record

## What Not to Do

- Don't create docs for trivial implementation details (variable names, import order)
- Don't update docs for every line of code — batch updates per feature
- Don't remove docs without explicit approval from the project owner
- Don't silently change rules — if a rule changes, note why
- Don't create a doc if the content fits naturally in an existing doc

## Arnold Commands

- `/arnold:init` — scaffold docs/ for a new project
- `/arnold:plan` — generate or refine feature specs
- `/arnold:check` — compare docs to code, find drift
- `/arnold:update` — sync docs after a coding session
- `/arnold:status` — quick project overview
- `/arnold:decide` — record a decision in docs/decisions/
- `/arnold:resolve` — fix drift items interactively
- `/arnold:recap` — start-of-session briefing
- `/arnold:diff` — quick drift scan
- `/arnold:spec` — decompose a spec document into feature-based docs
- `/arnold:help` — show all commands, when to use them, and doc structure
- `/arnold:bug` — record a structured bug report in docs/issues/
- `/arnold:milestone` — define and track phased work with feature rollup
- `/arnold:archive` — move stale or reference docs to archive/reference folders
- `/arnold:feature` — feature completeness matrix, deep status, or deep plan
- `/arnold:build` — build code from docs with acceptance criteria verification
- `/arnold:review` — critique docs for usability, product, and technical issues
