description: Prefer JSDoc block comments over line comments
---


# Comment style

Use JSDoc-style block comments (`/** */`) for explanatory comments in application and library source. Do not use `//` line comments for explanations.

```js
// ❌ BAD
// Re-open the XHR and restore headers before retrying.
request.open(method, url, true)

// ✅ GOOD
/** Re-open the XHR and restore headers before retrying. */
request.open(method, url, true)
```

Multi-line:

```js
/**
 * When Range is ignored, complete from the buffered body instead of
 * appending — otherwise coordinates duplicate and the loop never ends.
 */
```

Exceptions (keep `//`):
- Tooling directives: `eslint-disable`, `@ts-expect-error`, `biome-ignore`, `prettier-ignore`
- Temporarily commented-out code
- Shebang lines

Public APIs should still use proper JSDoc tags (`@param`, `@returns`, etc.) inside `/** */`.
