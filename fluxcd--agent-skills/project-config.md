# Agent Instructions

This repository contains AI agent skills for Flux CD, Kubernetes, and GitOps.
Skills follow the [Agent Skills Open Standard](https://agentskills.io/specification.md).

## Repository Layout

```
skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md                          # Agent instructions (frontmatter + workflow)
├── scripts/                          # Helper scripts (bash, awk-only where possible)
├── references/                       # On-demand reference docs (checklists, API summaries)
├── assets/schemas/                   # Bundled OpenAPI schemas for Flux CRDs
└── evals/evals.json                  # Evaluation scenarios with expected behavior
tests/{skill-name}/                   # Test fixtures for offline evaluation
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json       # Skill registry for distribution
Makefile                              # Schema downloads and test targets
```

## Working on Existing Skills

1. Read the skill's `SKILL.md` to understand its workflow and allowed tools
2. Read all files in `references/` and `scripts/` before making changes
3. Keep `SKILL.md` under ~15KB — heavy reference material belongs in `references/`

## Running Skill Evals

Each skill has an `evals/evals.json` file with evaluation scenarios. When asked to run them:

1. Read `evals/evals.json` to get the list of eval prompts and their expectations
2. For each eval, spawn a sub-agent with this prompt template:
   ```
   You are a [skill role]. load the skill from `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
   exactly — read it first, then follow the workflow phases.

   Your task: [eval prompt from evals.json]

   Important:
   - Do not seach the web, use only the skill references and your own reasoning
   - Produce the full structured report as specified in the workflow if there is one
   ```
3. Score each eval output against the `expectations` array — each expectation is a pass/fail check
4. Report results as a scorecard: eval id, pass/fail counts, and any missed expectations

The sub-agent should not be told the expectations — it must produce the correct output by following the skill workflow alone.

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/{skill-name}/` with the structure above
2. Write `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`) and a phased workflow
3. Use the existing skills as templates — read `skills/gitops-repo-audit/SKILL.md` and
   `skills/gitops-cluster-debug/SKILL.md` to match the conventions:
   - Workflows are explicit step-by-step, not open-ended
   - Reference docs are actionable checklists and lookup tables, not tutorials
   - Edge cases section prevents false positives on common patterns
   - Scripts output structured data (JSON) and avoid dependencies beyond awk
   - OpenAPI schemas are for validating generated YAML, not for general reference
4. Add evaluation scenarios in `evals/evals.json` with specific expectations
5. Add test fixtures in `tests/{skill-name}/` covering distinct scenarios
6. Register the skill in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` under `plugins[0].skills`
7. If the skill uses schemas, add its schema directory to `SCHEMAS_DIRS` in the `Makefile`
8. Document the skill in `README.md` with example prompts and usage instructions
