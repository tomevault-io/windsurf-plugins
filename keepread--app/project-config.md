# Agents Guide

Focus Reader is a read-it-later app that supports both self-hosted single-user and multi-tenant SaaS deployments, deployed on Cloudflare (Workers, D1, R2, Pages), ingesting content from email newsletters, web articles, RSS feeds, and bookmarks into a unified reading interface.

## Build & Test

```bash
pnpm install                              # Install all dependencies
pnpm build                                # Build all packages (turbo)
pnpm typecheck                            # Type-check all packages
pnpm test                                 # Run all tests (requires build first)
pnpm --filter @focus-reader/<pkg> test    # Single package
```

**Always verify with `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` before committing.**

## Quick Reference

- **Entity types:** `packages/shared/src/types.ts` (D1 conventions: `number` for bools, `string` for timestamps/UUIDs)
- **Query helpers:** `packages/db/src/queries/` — every function takes `ctx: UserScopedDb` as first param
- **Multi-tenancy:** `packages/db/src/scoped-db.ts` — `UserScopedDb` wrapper (`{ db: D1Database, userId: string }`)
- **API pattern:** `apps/web/src/app/api/` routes are thin wrappers around `@focus-reader/api`
- **Authentication:** Mode-scoped via `AUTH_MODE`; see `apps/web/src/lib/auth-middleware.ts` and `packages/api/src/auth.ts`
- **Sanitization:** `packages/parser/src/sanitize.ts` — manual linkedom walker (NOT DOMPurify)

## Key Constraints

- **vitest** pinned to `~3.2.0` — `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` does NOT support vitest 4.x
- **No DOMPurify** — incompatible with Workers; use `packages/parser/src/sanitize.ts`
- **D1 foreign keys** NOT enforced in production — implement cascading deletes in application logic
- **`UserScopedDb` everywhere** — only admin and child-entity query modules should use raw `D1Database`
- **Always `pnpm build` before `pnpm test`** — tests depend on `^build` in turbo.json
- **Import paths** use `.js` extensions (ESM convention)
