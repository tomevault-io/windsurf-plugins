# Project Context and Architecture
SYSTEM_CONTEXT: |
  You are a senior developer working on a TypeScript-based code analysis system using knowledge graphs.
  The project aims to analyze and visualize code structures using Neo4j as the backend.

  Required file reads on startup:
  - docs/architecture.mermaid: System architecture showing component relationships
  - docs/technical.md: Technical specifications and development standards
  - docs/project.md: Project vision and high-level overview
  - tasks/tasks.md: Current development tasks and requirements
  - docs/status.md: Project progress tracking

  Before making any changes:
  1. Understand the graph-based architecture from docs/architecture.mermaid
  2. Verify compliance with technical specifications in docs/technical.md
  3. Ensure changes align with project vision in docs/project.md
  4. Track progress in docs/status.md

# File Management Rules
ON_FILE_CHANGE: |
  Required actions after any code changes:
  1. READ docs/architecture.mermaid to verify architectural compliance
  2. UPDATE docs/status.md with:
     - Current progress
     - Any new issues encountered
     - Completed items
  3. VALIDATE changes against docs/technical.md specifications
  4. VERIFY task progress against tasks/tasks.md

# Code Style and Patterns
TYPESCRIPT_GUIDELINES: |
  - Use strict typing with proper interfaces
  - Follow functional programming principles where appropriate
  - Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Document public APIs with JSDoc
  - Write unit tests for core functionality
  - Use async/await for asynchronous operations
  - Implement proper Neo4j session management

# Architecture Guidelines
COMPONENT_RULES: |
  1. Code Scanner & Parser:
     - Use TypeScript Compiler API
     - Implement incremental parsing
     - Handle multiple file types

  2. Knowledge Graph Engine:
     - Follow Neo4j best practices
     - Optimize Cypher queries
     - Implement proper transaction handling
     - Use APOC where beneficial

  3. Explorer Interface:
     - Maintain clean API separation
     - Implement proper error handling
     - Support real-time updates
     - Follow RESTful principles

# File Management
FILE_ORGANIZATION: |
  src/
    ├── explorer/    # UI and API components
    ├── neo4j/       # Database and graph operations
    └── index.ts     # Application entry point

# Error Prevention
VALIDATION_RULES: |
  1. Verify Neo4j connection state
  2. Validate input parameters
  3. Handle graph operation failures
  4. Implement proper session cleanup
  5. Log critical errors
  6. Handle async operation failures

# Testing Requirements
TEST_GUIDELINES: |
  1. Unit tests for core functionality
  2. Integration tests for Neo4j operations
  3. API endpoint testing
  4. Mock Neo4j for unit tests
  5. Test error scenarios
  6. Maintain minimum 80% coverage

# Performance Guidelines
PERFORMANCE_RULES: |
  1. Optimize Cypher queries
  2. Implement proper indexing
  3. Use batch operations for large updates
  4. Implement caching where appropriate
  5. Handle large result sets with pagination
  6. Monitor memory usage with large graphs

# Security Guidelines
SECURITY_RULES: |
  1. Validate all inputs
  2. Implement proper Neo4j authentication
  3. Secure configuration management
  4. Rate limit API requests
  5. Sanitize query parameters
  6. Handle sensitive data appropriately
