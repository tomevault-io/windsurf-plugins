# Agent Instructions & Project Standards - RipTune

This document provides context and critical rules for AI agents working on the RipTune project.

## 1. Project Overview
RipTune is a premium music analyzer and downloader built with **Tauri v2** and **React**. The application focuses on providing a high-end, native-like experience across macOS, Windows, and Linux, with professional dark aesthetics and seamless performance.

## 2. Useful Commands
*   `npm run dev` : Starts the full development environment (Vite + Tauri Dev).
*   `npm run build` : Builds production-ready bundles for all platforms.
*   `npm run frontend:dev` : Runs only the Vite frontend for rapid UI prototyping.

## 3. Core Philosophy: "Native-First" (macOS)
*   **System Over Custom**: Never simulate in CSS what the OS can do natively (e.g., window borders, shadows, rounded corners).
*   **Window Configuration**: 
    *   Set `"transparent": false` to preserve the native macOS system border (thin white line) and shadow.
    *   Set `"backgroundColor": "#0a0f1c"` in `tauri.conf.json` to match the app's background and ensure perfect rounded corners.
    *   Set `"titleBarStyle": "Overlay"` to hide the default title bar while keeping native controls.

## 4. Tauri v2 Specifics (macOS)
*   **Traffic Lights Management**: Exclusively use the native `trafficLightPosition` in `tauri.conf.json`. 
    *   **Prohibition**: Never attempt to manipulate window buttons via Rust (`cocoa` or `objc`) as it causes click event interference (the "double-click" bug).
    *   **Standard Setting**: `{"x": 18, "y": 30}` for the current 60px header.
*   **User Interactions**: Use **`onMouseDown`** for interactive elements in the `TitleBar` to bypass macOS system focus delays.

## 5. Design & Code Style
*   **Aesthetics**: "Premium Dark" theme using `#0a0f1c`, `backdrop-blur` for overlays, and subtle micro-animations.
*   **Components**: 
    *   Icons: Use `lucide-react`.
    *   Z-index: The `TitleBar` must always be at the top (`z-[99999]`).
    *   Tooltips: Ensure they are not clipped (avoid `overflow-hidden` on TitleBar parents).
*   **Drag Region**: Strictly isolate `data-tauri-drag-region`. It must never overlap interactive buttons.

## 6. Communication & Workflow
*   **Tone**: Concise, technical, and direct.
*   **Pre-Implementation Analysis**: Always check if a desired feature exists natively in Tauri v2 configuration before writing custom Rust code.
*   **Version-Specific Validation**: Before proposing any configuration or environment variable changes, the agent MUST explicitly check `package.json` or `Cargo.toml` to identify exact dependency versions. 
*   **Version Fidelity**: The agent must exclusively use documentation and best practices corresponding to the versions discovered in the project (Current: **Tauri v2**). Applying "legacy" knowledge (e.g., Tauri v1 conventions) without explicit verification is strictly prohibited.
*   **Documentation First**: For breaking version transitions (e.g., Tauri v1 -> v2), the agent is prohibited from relying on memory. It MUST use research tools to verify the current official documentation for that specific version.
*   **Code Hygiene**: Systematically remove unused imports and debug comments before finalizing a task.
