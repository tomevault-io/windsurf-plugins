# Guidelines for AI Coding Agents

This document provides guidelines for AI coding agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) working on the `wt` project.

## Golden Rule: Use Worktrees!

**IMPORTANT:** As an AI agent, you should practice what this tool preaches - use worktrees for your work!

### ❌ DON'T: Switch branches in the main repository
```bash
# BAD - Don't do this!
cd /path/to/main/wt/repo
git checkout -b feature/new-branch
```

This leaves the user's main working directory on a feature branch.

### ✅ DO: Create worktrees for each task
```bash
# GOOD - Use wt to create isolated worktrees!
wt create feature/new-branch
# This creates: ~/dev/worktrees/wt/feature/new-branch
# Main repo stays on main branch
```

## Agent Workflow

### 1. Starting New Work

When beginning a new feature or fix:

```bash
# Create a worktree for your feature
wt create feat/your-feature-name

# The worktree is automatically checked out to:
# ~/dev/worktrees/wt/feat/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Working in the Worktree

All file operations (Read, Write, Edit) should use paths in the worktree:

```bash
# Work in the worktree location
/Users/username/dev/worktrees/wt/feat/your-feature-name/

# NOT in the main repo:
# /Users/username/src/github/wt/  ❌
```

### 3. Committing and Creating PRs

```bash
# From within the worktree directory
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push -u origin feat/your-feature-name

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "feat: your feature" --body "Description"
```

### 4. Cleaning Up

After the PR is merged:

```bash
# Remove the worktree
wt remove feat/your-feature-name
# or use the short alias:
wt rm feat/your-feature-name
```

## Why This Matters for Agents

### Benefits of Worktree-based Workflow

1. **Non-disruptive:** User's main repository stays on `main` branch
2. **Isolated:** Each feature gets its own directory
3. **Parallel work:** Can work on multiple features simultaneously
4. **Clean state:** No branch switching confusion
5. **Predictable:** Always know where files are located

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Checking out branches in main repo**
```bash
# This disrupts the user's workspace
cd /path/to/main/repo
git checkout feature-branch
```

❌ **Forgetting where you are**
```bash
# Always be aware of your current location
# Are you in main repo or a worktree?
```

❌ **Mixing work across locations**
```bash
# Don't edit files in main repo while working on a worktree feature
```

✅ **Use wt commands consistently**
```bash
# Create worktrees
wt create feat/new-feature

# Check existing worktrees
wt list

# Remove when done
wt rm feat/new-feature
```

## Interactive Commands

When run without arguments, several commands provide interactive selection:

```bash
# Interactively select a branch to checkout
wt checkout

# Interactively select a worktree to remove
wt remove

# Interactively select a PR to work on (requires gh CLI)
wt pr

# Interactively select an MR to work on (requires glab CLI)
wt mr
```

## Working with PRs and MRs

### GitHub Pull Requests
```bash
# List and select from open PRs
wt pr              # Interactive selection

# Or specify PR number/URL directly
wt pr 123
wt pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

This looks up the PR's actual branch name (e.g. `feat/add-auth`) and creates a worktree at `~/dev/worktrees/wt/feat/add-auth` — identical to `wt co feat/add-auth`.

### GitLab Merge Requests
```bash
# List and select from open MRs
wt mr              # Interactive selection

# Or specify MR number/URL directly
wt mr 456
wt mr https://gitlab.com/owner/repo/-/merge_requests/456
```

This looks up the MR's actual branch name (e.g. `fix/api-cleanup`) and creates a worktree at `~/dev/worktrees/wt/fix/api-cleanup` — identical to `wt co fix/api-cleanup`.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Branch Naming
Follow the project's convention:
- `feat/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation
- `refactor/description` - Refactoring
- `chore/description` - Maintenance

### Commit Messages
Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat: add interactive selection`
- `fix: handle edge case in branch filtering`
- `docs: update agent guidelines`

### Before Creating PR

1. ✅ Ensure all tests pass: `go test ./...`
2. ✅ Run E2E tests: `go run e2e/run.go` (see Testing section below)
3. ✅ Run linter: `golangci-lint run` (or let CI do it)
4. ✅ Build succeeds: `go build -o bin/wt .`
5. ✅ Commit messages follow convention

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Standard Go tests in `*_test.go` files:

```bash
go test ./...
```

### E2E Tests (YAML-based)

This project uses a **declarative YAML-based E2E test framework** in `e2e/scenarios/`. Each command has its own YAML file (e.g., `checkout.yaml`, `create.yaml`, `cleanup.yaml`).

**Running E2E tests:**
```bash
# Build first, then run E2E tests
go build -o bin/wt .
go run e2e/run.go

# With verbose output
go run e2e/run.go -verbose
```

**Adding new E2E tests:**

Create or edit a YAML file in `e2e/scenarios/`:

```yaml
name: my-command
description: Test my-command functionality

scenarios:
  - name: basic_test
    description: Test basic functionality
