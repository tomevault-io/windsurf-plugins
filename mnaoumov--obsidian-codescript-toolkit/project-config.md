## What's done

- 35 integration tests across 7 files, all passing
- Bug fix: ScriptFolderWatcher missed initial loadSettings event (component load ordering)
- Bug fix: broken relative links in docs/code-button-config.md and docs/code-button-context.md
- Workaround: afterAll detaches markdown leaves to avoid CLI eval interference
- Added dedent dependency for multiline strings
- Added strictProxy rule to global TypeScript rules

## Integration test coverage (135 tests)

## Coverage status

All features are now fully covered across code, docs, demo vault, and integration tests (135 tests).

- ~~Integration test gaps (WASM, ASAR, node binaries)~~ — **Done**
- ~~Demo vault gap (`requireAsyncWrapper()`)~~ — **Done**
- ~~Docs gap (plugin integrations)~~ — **Done** (added demo vault link to `docs/usage.md`; dedicated guide pages intentionally out of scope)

## Known Issues

None.
