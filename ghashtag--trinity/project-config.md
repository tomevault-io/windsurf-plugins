description: Canonical maintainer / author — do not change without explicit human approval
---


# Author attribution lock

**Canonical maintainer and author string:** **Dmitrii Vasilev** / GitHub **@gHashTag**.

## Rules for agents and editors

1. **Do not** replace this name or handle with placeholders (`Trinity Research Group`, `Abbie`, generic “Trinity Project”, etc.) in locked paths.
2. **Do not** edit `tools/config/author_attribution_guard.manifest` to remove paths **unless** the corresponding file is deleted or ownership is explicitly changed by the repository owner.
3. **Do not** weaken or delete `src/tri/author_attribution_guard.zig` or its `build.zig` `test_step` dependency without explicit human approval.

## Enforcement

- `zig build test` runs `src/tri/author_attribution_guard.zig` and fails if any listed file is missing **Dmitrii Vasilev** and **gHashTag**, or still contains **Trinity Research Group** / **Trinity Research Team**.
- To add a new document that must carry the same attribution, append its repo-relative path to `tools/config/author_attribution_guard.manifest`.

## When changes are allowed

Only when the **human maintainer** explicitly requests a different attribution or adds co-authors. Then update the manifest, the guard constants if needed, and the tests in the same change.
