description: - Load `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `.agent/INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `.agent/LESSONS.md` into your brain
---

### 1. Plan

- Load `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `.agent/INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `.agent/LESSONS.md` into your brain
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately, don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity
- Double-check your work before executing any changes
- Ask questions upfront before executing any changes
- As best as you can, ask for execution permissions upfront before executing any changes

### 2. Subagent Strategy

- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After ANY correction from the user: update `.agent/LESSONS.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until the mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for a relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between the `main` branch and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness
- Write new tests for new features, bug fixes, and refactors — no exceptions
- New services and classes must have dedicated unit tests (e.g. `TextSymbolMapper` → `TextSymbolMapperTests`)
- Tests live in `tests/CodeToNeo4j.Tests/` mirroring the `src/` folder structure

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes, don't overengineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Create a plan before starting
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Capture Lessons**: Update `.agent/LESSONS.md` after corrections
6. **Refine Instructions**: Update `.agent/INSTRUCTIONS.md` with any helpful information discovered during execution

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
- **S.O.L.I.D**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
