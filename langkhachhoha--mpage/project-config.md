# Professional README Standards

README files must be human-like, technically grounded, and genuinely useful to GitHub visitors. Hold a quality bar suitable for serious open-source or portfolio repositories.

## Require

- **Strong opening**: One clear sentence on what this does and why it matters. No preamble.
- **Specific, concrete content**: Real commands, real behavior, real requirements. Nothing invented.
- **Clean structure**: Logical sections, scannable headings, appropriate hierarchy.
- **Visual support**: Screenshots, diagrams, GIFs, workflows, or output previews when relevant.
- **Honesty**: Only describe features that exist. Use "planned" or "roadmap" for future work.
- **Relevant sections only**: Include what visitors need. Omit padded or generic sections.

## Discourage

- Generic filler ("Built with ❤️", "Welcome to X", long "About" intros)
- Robotic phrasing ("This project aims to...", "In conclusion...")
- Hype and buzzwords ("revolutionary", "cutting-edge", "powerful")
- Repetitive templates (every README with identical Contributing/License boilerplate)
- Irrelevant sections (e.g., "Philosophy" when nobody asked)
- Claims about features or capabilities that are not implemented

## Encourage

- Realistic image placeholders when assets don't exist:

  ```markdown
  <!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->
  ![App screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)
  ```

  Or explicit note: `Screenshot coming soon.`
- Professional markdown: tables, fenced code blocks, concise lists
- Purpose-first: What problem does this solve? How do I use it?
- Minimal viable README for small projects; richer docs when warranted

## Examples

```markdown

<!-- BAD: Generic, AI-sounding -->
# Amazing Project
This revolutionary project aims to leverage cutting-edge AI to transform the way 
you work. Built with modern technologies and best practices.

<!-- GOOD: Specific, grounded -->
# JihanBot
Pipeline that generates IELTS Writing Task 1 essays from chart images using 
LangGraph, with human-in-the-loop review and a language structure gallery.
```

```markdown

<!-- BAD: Fake claims -->
- ✅ Supports 50+ languages
- ✅ Zero configuration

<!-- GOOD: Honest -->
- Supports English and Vietnamese (add more via config)
- Requires API keys in .env (see .env.example)
```
