# Binky — Agent Rules

## App Size (Non-negotiable)

Binky still ships legacy compression engines from the Dinky era (image/video encoders plus bundled **qpdf** and dylibs). Before adding **anything** — a framework, dependency, asset, font, or feature — mentally check its bundle size impact first.

**Rules:**
- Prefer Apple frameworks always: SwiftUI, Foundation, AppKit, UserNotifications, AVFoundation, etc. They're free — already in the OS, zero bundle cost.
- Never add an SPM or CocoaPods dependency without explicit approval from Derek AND a clear size justification.
- If a feature would meaningfully grow the binary (>100 KB), find a lighter native implementation or skip it.
- No Electron, no web views, no bundled runtimes, no embedded web engines. Ever.
- Assets (images, fonts) should be SVG/SF Symbols where possible. Raster assets must be justified.

**Current footprint reference:** Keep install weight honest vs Optimage / ImageOptim; slimming dead compression assets from the bundle is an ongoing goal now that v1 is organizer-first.

## Project Context

- macOS app, SwiftUI + AppKit; deployment target **macOS 14 Sonoma**; Liquid Glass (`.glassEffect()`) on **macOS 26 Tahoe** with `.ultraThinMaterial` fallback
- Built by Derek Castelli — full-time freelance web designer (Webflow/Figma) at heyderekj.com
- **v1 product:** Named **Automations** that calm any fussy folder (watch, classify, route, optional Finder tags, Review folder, history / undo moves). Downloads remains the default global inbox; Desktop and other sources are first-class.
- Legacy compression stack still present for backward compatibility paths; **UX is organizer-led**.

## Brand Voice

**Core metaphor:** A binky is a pacifier — it soothes, quiets, and calms fussy things. Binky (the app) does the same for a chaotic Downloads folder. Lean into that: the inbox is the fussy baby, Binky is the thing that makes it stop screaming.

**Tone:** Dry, warm, one-liner delivery. Short sentences. Never corporate. Never precious. Rhymes and wordplay welcome if they land — if they don't, cut them.

**Vs. Dinky:** Dinky's voice is about smallness ("Dinky makes files smaller", "tiny", size puns). Binky's voice is about calm and order — soothing, routing, tidying. Same deadpan register; different metaphor family.

**Writing patterns that work:**

- Treat the inbox like a toddler throwing a tantrum: "Fussy inbox. Meet Binky." / "Files were screaming. Binky helped."
- Short imperative or declaration: "Give it to Binky." / "Sh. Binky's handling it."
- Noun → past-tense verb form: "Sorted. Routed. Binky'd."
- Pacifier-literal crossover: "The pacifier for your Downloads." / "Downloads acting up? Pop in a Binky."
- Calm-outcome framing: "Quiets the mess right down." / "Your inbox, quietly handled."

**Avoid:**

- Exclamation points (too chipper).
- Explaining the metaphor (trust the reader).
- Long sentences — if it doesn't fit on one line in a UI label, cut it.
- Generic productivity-app language ("Streamline your workflow", "Boost productivity", etc.).
