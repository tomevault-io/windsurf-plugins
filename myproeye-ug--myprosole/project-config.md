# Git Hygiene

- After successful checks, commit relevant code, documentation, and test changes, then push them to GitHub.
- Review `git status` and `git diff` before committing; stage only files related to the task.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, local data files, generated caches, or shortcuts.
- Do not force-push unless the user explicitly requests it and the target branch is safe.
