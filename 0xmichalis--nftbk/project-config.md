# General Rules

## General Guidelines

* Every time you provide a code change, you need to ensure it
  follows project standards:
  * code is formatted
  * tests pass
  The best way to ensure that is to run `make all`.
* Never remove comments unless the code you update renders the comment
  invalid.
* Never refactor or rename code unless you are explicitly being told so.
* When removing code, do not add a comment to note the deletion of the code,
  simply delete the code.
* When providing a solution, give me a score on a scale of 1-10 about how
  confident you are in the solution.

## GitHub Guidelines

* When you cannot access a GitHub link via a web search, try using the `gh` command.
* Read an issue and all its comments with `gh issue view <id> --comments`.
  When you read an issue, always read all the comments.
* List reviews on a PR:
  `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<pr_number>/reviews`
* Fetch all review comments for a specific review:
  `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<pr_number>/reviews/<review_id>/comments`
* For quick inspection, you can pipe JSON through `jq`, for example:
  * `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/105/reviews | jq '.[].id, .[].user.login'`
  * `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/105/reviews/<review_id>/comments | jq '.[].body'`

## Security Practices

* Never commit sensitive files.
* Use environment variables for secrets.
* Keep credentials out of logs and output.

## Debugging

* When you see `error communicating with database` error then that means that
some of the tests are trying to communicate with a real database. Avoid these
errors by running tests with `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` or use the Makefile target
for running tests `make test` that already sets `SQLX_OFFLINE`.

## Testing

* When adding unit tests for a function, create a test module dedicates to that
function named `mod <function_name>_tests`
* In unit tests avoid trying to connect to real or dummy databases. Instead write
production code that uses traits to mock database connectors. For blockchain APIs,
IPFS APIs, or any other external APIs, use `wiremock` to mock them.
