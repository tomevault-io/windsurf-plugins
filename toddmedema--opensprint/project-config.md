# Agent Instructions — Open Sprint

## Project Overview

Open Sprint is a web application that guides users through the full software development lifecycle using AI agents. It has five phases — SPEED: Sketch, Plan, Execute, Evaluate, and Deliver. The active product spec is `SPEC.md` at the repo root.

**Tech stack:** Node.js + TypeScript (backend), React + TypeScript (frontend).

## Open Sprint Runtime Contract

Task tracking is handled internally by `TaskStoreService` backed by **SQLite (default)** or **PostgreSQL**. The connection is resolved in order: **`DATABASE_URL`**, then **`databaseUrl`** in `~/.opensprint/global-settings.json`, then the default SQLite path (`~/.opensprint/data/opensprint.sqlite`). There is no external task CLI.

**Integration token encryption:** Integration OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest. Without **`INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** (base64-encoded 32-byte key), the backend derives a key from the hostname and `~/.opensprint/encryption-salt`, which is acceptable for typical local single-user use but **not** for shared hosts where other users might read `~/.opensprint`. For those deployments, set `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the environment; the backend emits a startup warning when it is unset.

When Open Sprint spawns an Execute agent:

1. The task branch and worktree are already prepared. Do not create or switch branches unless the task prompt explicitly tells you to recover git state.
2. Implement the requested change and run the smallest relevant non-watch verification for touched workspaces while iterating. Use scoped tests first, add scoped build/typecheck and lint commands when your changes could affect them, and leave the branch in a state where the project’s configured merge quality gates are expected to pass before you report success. The orchestrator **re-runs those merge gate commands server-side** after `result.json` reports success (unless the project disables `enforceMergeGatesOnCodingSuccess`); failures there reject the success path even if the agent believed it was done.
3. **Dependencies:** If you add, remove, or upgrade dependencies, follow the repository’s documented install workflow from the **repository root**. Keep manifests and lockfiles in sync for the project’s package/dependency ecosystem, and commit metadata updates in the same commits as code that introduces new imports.
4. **Build/typecheck compatibility:** If test files are included in the project’s build/typecheck, ensure test-runner globals and typing/runtime configuration are set so build/typecheck still succeeds after your changes.
5. Commit incremental logical units while working so crash recovery can preserve progress.
6. Report completion only by writing the exact `result.json` payload requested in the task prompt. Do not call `TaskStoreService.close()` from feature code.
7. If blocked by ambiguity, return `status: "failed"` with `open_questions` instead of guessing.
8. Do not push, merge, or close tasks manually. The orchestrator handles validation, task state, merging, and remote publication.

## Orchestrator Recovery (GUPP-style)

Work state is persisted before agent spawn via `assignment.json` in `.opensprint/active/<task-id>/`. If the backend crashes, recovery reads the assignment and re-spawns or resumes the agent. **Always write assignment before spawn; never spawn then write.**

## Loop Kicker vs Watchdog

- **Loop kicker** (60s): Restarts the orchestrator loop when idle. Runs inside the orchestrator.
- **Watchdog** (5 min): Witness-style health patrol — stale heartbeats, orphaned tasks, stale `.git/index.lock`. Runs in a separate `WatchdogService`.

## Task Store

Tasks are stored in the configured database (SQLite or PostgreSQL). Schema is applied on init via `runSchema(client, dialect)` in `packages/backend/src/db/schema.ts`. The same `DbClient` abstraction is used for both; dialect is chosen from the database URL.

**Tests and production:** Backend tests use a separate test DB (`opensprint_test` or `TEST_DATABASE_URL` for Postgres). The app never reads `TEST_DATABASE_URL`. For future test-only or prod-only behavior, run tests with `NODE_ENV=test` and gate logic so production never runs test-only code.

The `TaskStoreService` provides:

- `create()` / `createMany()` — Create tasks with optional parent IDs
- `update()` / `updateMany()` — Update task fields (status, assignee, priority, etc.)
- `close()` / `closeMany()` — Close tasks with a reason
- `show()` — Get a single task by ID
- `listAll()` — List all tasks
- `ready()` — Get priority-sorted tasks with all blockers resolved
- `addDependency()` — Add dependency between tasks (blocks, parent-child, etc.)

## Task ID Format

- `os-xxxx` — Top-level task (random hex)
- `os-xxxx.1` — Child task under parent
- `os-xxxx.1.1` — Sub-task

## Merge Conflicts and Merger Agent

When a merge to main fails with **code conflicts** (after infra-only auto-resolve), the **merge-coordinator** tries once to fix it automatically:

1. **Rebase** the task branch onto main in the worktree (conflicts may appear).
