# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **First-read file:** `README.md` — project intent (coverage-hole → covIR → UVM case → run-local verdict), quick-start, and typical CLI pipeline. This file supplements the README; it does **not** repeat its content.
>
> Scope: this repo *is* the `cov_hunter` Python project (standalone, at `~/Projects/cov_hunter/`). It is an external CLI used against arbitrary UVM verification projects via `--project-root`. Keep the package self-contained — do not import from any target verification project, and do not have target projects import from `cov_hunter`.

## Install / test / run

Install editable into user site-packages — same convention as the sibling `take_root` project. Entry point lands at `~/.local/bin/cov-hunter` and is available from any cwd as long as `~/.local/bin` is on `$PATH`.

```bash
cd /home/robin/Projects/cov_hunter
python3.11 -m pip install -e .          # runtime only
python3.11 -m pip install -e .[dev]     # adds pytest for in-repo development

pytest                                   # all tests
pytest tests/test_parse_vcs_urg.py -k vcs_urg   # one file / one test
pytest -x --lf                           # stop on first fail, then rerun last-failed

cov-hunter <subcommand> --help           # installed as project.scripts entry point
python -m cov_hunter <subcommand> ...    # equivalent; useful when ~/.local/bin is not on PATH
```

The `cov-hunter` CLI also runs from a checkout without installing as long as `src/` is on `PYTHONPATH` (`PYTHONPATH=src python -m cov_hunter ...`).

Runtime deps are intentionally minimal: `PyYAML`, `jsonschema`. Dev only adds `pytest`. Python ≥ 3.10.

## Architecture — what the README's pipeline hides

The CLI verbs (`configure`, `doctor`, `init`, `parse`, `classify`, `review`, `report`, `case-gen`, `close-loop`, plus `run` as umbrella) are all thin wrappers. The actual layout is:

- **`cli.py`** — single argparse entry. Each subcommand's `set_defaults(handler=...)` points at a `phases/<name>.py` function. That's the only place new verbs get registered.
- **`phases/<name>.py`** — CLI glue only: resolve args, call into a domain module, write output. Keep business logic OUT of `phases/`.
- **Domain modules** (siblings of `cli.py`):
  - `covir.py` — the covIR dataclasses + JSON (de)serialization. covIR is the **single IR** that every later phase consumes; `schemas/covir.schema.json` is authoritative.
  - `adapters/__init__.py` — coverage adapter detection/dispatch. Current adapters are VCS `urg` HTML (`adapters/vcs_urg.py`) and Xcelium `xrun` IMC HTML (`adapters/xrun_imc.py`). New simulators/formats plug in as sibling adapters and must emit covIR; do not leak adapter-specific types past this boundary.
  - `scope_filter.py` — shared `coverage.dut_scopes` parsing and matching for adapters. Both VCS and XRUN accept `scope` for all descendants or `scope depth`, where depth `1` means current scope only, `2` means current plus one child level, and larger non-negative integers continue the same rule.
  - `classify_engine.py` — rule-based classification plus severity assignment driven by `profile.yml`. `severity_rules` only assign `S1-S4` to holes already marked `reachable`; they do not decide `reachable/deadcode/unr`.
  - `structural_unr.py` — conservative RTL/TB structural constant analysis used by classification. It indexes configured `rtl_roots` + `tb_roots`, propagates constant ties/assigns across module inputs, and fails closed on ambiguous or multiple drivers.
  - `review_engine.py` — optional LLM reviewer pass that annotates classified holes with `human_review` summaries, severity advice, and waive suggestions. It writes/reuses `review_shards/` when a run directory is provided.
  - `case_generation.py` — produces UVM test source and injects it into `test/uart_test_lib.sv` + `test/sv_list`, bounded by `marker_begin`/`marker_end` from the profile. Anything outside those markers is treated as human-owned and must not be touched.
  - `source_protection.py` — SHA-256 digest over RTL/TB files with AI-generated marker blocks stripped. `close_loop_engine.py` snapshots this digest before and after a rerun; mismatch ⇒ verdict fails (the loop is not allowed to mutate protected source).
  - `close_loop_engine.py` — invokes build/run/report commands under `build.build_dir` via `bash -lc` (typically after `setup_cmd`), captures per-case artifacts, and emits a **run-local** verdict. It intentionally does not merge or promote coverage — that's the outer project's job.
  - `doctor.py` — validates configured provider roles and optionally performs a minimal provider call, writing reports under `<project>/.cov_hunter/doctor/`.
  - `run_engine.py` — orchestrates `init → parse → classify → review → report → case-gen → close-loop` for one hole; used by `cov-hunter run`. `--report-only` stops after report, and `--skip-review` removes the review phase.
  - `reporting.py` — Markdown + JSON renderers from covIR.

- **Config layers** (three distinct files — don't conflate):
  1. `~/.cov_hunter/config.yaml` — global, provider + role mapping. Written by `configure`. Schema: `schemas/config.schema.json`.
