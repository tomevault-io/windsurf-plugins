- Tech stack: Next.JS, React, Tailwind, ShadCN, Supabase postgres, npm
- Use `npx shadcn add` to add new shadcn components.
- You are not able to see or modify .env files directly - so tell the user what they should add to the file if needed.
- Avoid classes/OOP and use a functional programming style.
- Never try to start the app itself (I have it running in a separate terminal)
- Recommend frequent GitHub commits but never execute without user approval 

- Interact with Supabase, Posthog and Notion directly via MCP
- Interact with GitHub using CLI commands

- Follow @coding-principles.md and @design-system.md when proposing implementation plans

### CODING INSTRUCTIONS ###
- Write the absolute minimum code required
- No sweeping changes
- No unrelated edits - focus on just the task you're on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Don’t break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything (e.g. Supabase/AWS config), tell me clearly
- Avoid custom components as much as possible. Default to shadcn/ui components and reuse existing components before creating new ones
