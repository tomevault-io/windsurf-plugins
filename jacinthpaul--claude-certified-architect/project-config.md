# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and human contributors) working in this repo.

## What this repo is

One repo hosting **multiple independent exam-prep consoles** for Claude
certifications, deployed together as a single GitHub Pages site:

| Console | Live path | App code | Content source of truth | Data generator |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Certification Hub (landing page) | `/` | `ui/hub/` | `ui/hub/index.html` (static, self-contained) | — |
| Architect – Foundations | `/architect-foundations/` | `ui/console/` | `exam/*.py` + `domains/*` runnable demos | `python3 ui/console/build_data.py` |
| Associate – Foundations (CCAO-F) | `/associate-foundations/` | `ui/console-associate/` | `associate/content/*.py` | `python3 ui/console-associate/build_data.py` |

More consoles (Developer – Foundations, Architect – Professional) are planned —
follow the same pattern: one `ui/console-<name>/` folder + one content package
per cert, deployed at `/<cert>-<tier>/`, then flip that cert's hub card from
`soon` to `active`.

Each console is a single-file React app (CDN React + Babel Standalone, no build
step) rendering a generated `assets/data.js`. They are **full forks, not shared
code**: separate `app.jsx`, `styles.css`, JS globals (`CCA` vs `CCAF`), and
localStorage namespaces (`cca-*` vs `ccaf-*`). Editing one console never
affects the other.

## Multi-console change strategy (IMPORTANT)

When asked for an enhancement, first determine the scope — ask if unclear:

1. **Content changes are always per-console.** The courses are different;
   lessons, questions, scenarios, and cheat facts never sync across consoles.
   Edit the content package, rerun that console's `build_data.py`, commit the
   regenerated `data.js` together with the content change. Never hand-edit
   `assets/data.js`.

2. **Single-console UI feature:** edit only that console's `app.jsx` /
   `styles.css`. Do not "helpfully" port it to the other console unless asked.

3. **Shared UI feature (both consoles):** implement and verify it in one
   console first, then port the same diff to the other. The `app.jsx` files
   are kept structurally parallel (same component names and ordering) so the
   port is usually near-verbatim. Verify each console independently after
   porting.

4. **Keep the forks parallel, not identical.** Functional drift is fine
   (chat walkthroughs vs terminal demos); structural/stylistic drift makes
   porting expensive. When touching shared structure, keep names and layout
   aligned across both files.

5. **Never hard-code course identity in app code.** No
   "if this is the associate console…" branches inside `app.jsx` — anything
   course-specific (branding, counts, weights, labels, demo type) belongs in
   the data model or config. This keeps the planned refactor cheap: at 3–4
   consoles, extract a shared engine
   (`ui/shared/`) that renders any cert's data package, with per-console
   config for branding/namespace/accent. Until then, fork-and-port is the
   deliberate trade-off — do not extract shared code prematurely.

## Tutorial PDFs

Downloadable handbooks live **per course**, in that console's own folder:
`ui/console/tutorials/`, `ui/console-associate/tutorials/`, and so on. The Pages
workflow already copies each console folder wholesale, so a PDF dropped there is
served at `/<course>/tutorials/<file>.pdf` with no workflow change.

Naming: `claude-certified-<cert>-<tier>-tutorial-<n>.pdf`.

The console learns about its PDFs only from the `tutorials` array in its
`assets/config.js` (title, blurb, relative `file`, `meta`) — per rule 5 above,
never from `app.jsx`. An empty array hides the console's Downloads section.
Adding a tutorial is: drop the file, add the config entry, add one `<li>` to the
downloads list in `ui/hub/index.html`, bump the console's cache-bust query.

## Build & verify

```bash
# regenerate a console's data.js after editing its content package
python3 ui/console/build_data.py             # architect
python3 ui/console-associate/build_data.py   # associate (validates blueprint
                                             # coverage/distribution, fails loudly)

# repo smoke test (CI runs this on every push)
python3 run_all.py --check
```

Quiz/mock explanations (`why`) must stay **letter-free** ("the correct
option…", never "option B") — generators shuffle options with a per-question
seeded order.

To verify a console end-to-end, stage the site and drive it with the local
Chromium (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium` in Claude Code remote sessions):

```bash
mkdir -p _site/architect-foundations _site/associate-foundations
cp ui/hub/index.html _site/index.html
cp -r ui/console/. _site/architect-foundations/
cp -r ui/console-associate/. _site/associate-foundations/
cd _site && python3 -m http.server 8931
```

Note for sandboxed sessions: unpkg.com/github.io may be blocked; vendor
React/Babel locally into the staged copy for testing only — never change the
CDN references in the committed `index.html`.

## Deploy

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` stages the hub and every console into one Pages
artifact (hub at `/`, architect at `/architect-foundations/`, associate at
`/associate-foundations/`) and deploys on push to the branches listed in its
trigger. When adding a new console or deploy branch:
