Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Project

AnyaDance is a Windows-only toolkit for driving and animating a VRChat avatar's
full body (pose by hand, live drive, or MMD dance playback). At its core is a
SteamVR/OpenVR virtual-device driver plus a Dear ImGui companion UI. The driver
exposes six virtual devices (HMD, two controllers, hip and two foot trackers) and
receives pose/input frames over loopback UDP JSON at `127.0.0.1:39570`. The
companion UI (`AnyaDance.exe`) streams a six-device T-pose at 60 Hz.
Released under the Apache License 2.0 as part of Project Anya.

## Layout

- `src/core/` — shared, platform-light logic: protocol, frame state, freshness,
  T-pose math, manipulation, input state, UDP log, a small JSON DOM (`json`), and
  the MMD dance remap (`solved_motion` parses the Blender solve JSON,
  `mmd_retarget` remaps it onto the six devices), and the `.nya` clip format
  (`nya_format` serializes/parses device-level `DanceMotion` frames; a pose is a
  one-frame clip, an animation is many). Built as `anyadance_core` and exercised
  by the tests. Keep it free of OpenVR and Win32 so tests build it.
- `src/driver/` — the SteamVR driver DLL (`server_driver`, `virtual_device`,
  `udp_pose_receiver`). Links OpenVR.
- `src/ui/` — the Dear ImGui Win32/DX11 UI (`main.cpp`, `localization`,
  `driver_control`, `mmd_dance`). `mmd_dance` launches Blender headless with
  `scripts/blender_export_mmd.py` to solve a VMD against a model and reads back the
  single solved-motion JSON. `driver_control` registers/unregisters the driver by editing
  `openvrpaths.vrpath` and `steamvr.vrsettings` directly (no `vrpathreg` process),
  and restarts SteamVR (stops the vrserver/vrmonitor/vrcompositor processes, then
  relaunches via `steam://run/250820`). The driver root is the exe's own folder,
  so the UI ships inside the driver bundle and registers that folder; OpenVR
  loads `bin/win64/driver_anyadance.dll` (it cannot be a loose root DLL). The
  build outputs the exe into `out/anyadance/` for this reason, and the
  `package_driver` target zips that folder into `out/AnyaDance.zip`.
- `driver/resources/` — `default.vrsettings`, input profiles, and images shipped
  with the driver.
- `scripts/` — PowerShell helpers (build, register, unregister, restart).
- `docs/` — architecture, device model, protocol, building, installation,
  troubleshooting, MMD dance (`mmd-dance.md`).
- `tests/` — single-binary test runner (`anyadance_tests`).

## Build / test

Windows, PowerShell, CMake + Visual Studio 2022, C++17.

```powershell
.\scripts\build_driver.ps1                                   # configure + build (fetches OpenVR + ImGui)
cmake --build build --config Release --target anyadance_tests
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

Pass `-OpenVRSdkRoot` / `-ImguiRoot` to build against local checkouts; supplying
a root turns off fetching for that dependency.

## SteamVR

```powershell
.\scripts\register_driver.ps1     # register + write the fully-virtual vrsettings (backs up first)
.\scripts\unregister_driver.ps1   # unregister + restore the backup
.\scripts\restart_steamvr.ps1     # restart SteamVR
```

## CI / release

- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) configures, builds, and runs
  CTest on every push and pull request. It pins `runs-on: windows-2022` on
  purpose — `windows-latest` now resolves to an image without Visual Studio 2022,
  which breaks the `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator. Do not switch it back.
- Pushing a `v*` tag triggers the release workflow
  (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): it builds, tests, then publishes a GitHub
  Release with `AnyaDance-<tag>-windows-x64.zip` (the packaged
  `out/AnyaDance.zip`, renamed). It is idempotent — it uploads the asset
  even if the release already exists.

## Conventions

- C++17, Windows-only. Define `NOMINMAX` before `windows.h` (the UI does) so
  `std::min`/`std::max`/`std::clamp` are not shadowed.
- UDP protocol is version 1; keep it backward compatible unless
  `kProtocolVersion` changes. Shared constants live in `src/core/constants.h`.
- Preserve OpenVR-required names: `HmdDriverFactory`, `driver.vrdrivermanifest`,
  `knuckles`, and OpenVR input paths.
- Only fully-virtual mode is supported (the virtual HMD is the active HMD); there
  is no physical-HMD mode.
- All six devices start connected and valid at neutral poses. Accepted packets
  update the latest pose and controller inputs. If packets stop, SteamVR
  continues seeing each device connected, valid, and `TrackingResult_Running_OK`
  at the last accepted pose. The HMD reports pose only, and is the active
  virtual HMD in fully virtual mode.
- All devices set `Prop_IgnoreMotionForStandby_Bool` so SteamVR does not idle a
  held-still virtual device into standby/powersave.
- All device Y is clamped to `2.0 m` (`kMaxDeviceY`) — in the UI before sending
  and in the driver after packet validation.
- The UDP log is always recorded in English. UI strings are localized through the
  row-per-string table in `src/ui/localization.*`; access with `Tr(Text::...)`.
  Adding a string is one enum value plus one table row (a `static_assert` guards
  the row count).
- Add focused tests in the relevant `tests/test_*.cpp` file for protocol,
