# Repository conventions for coding agents

Guidance for AI coding agents (and humans) working in this repo. Keep changes consistent
with these unless a maintainer says otherwise.

## Pre-validating a commit

The routine pass, both parts, ~20s total:

```bash
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/ -m "not expensive" -q   # ~10s
uv run --no-sync pyright                               # ~7s, must report 0 errors
```

Expect `N passed, M deselected`. `pyright` needs no arguments — `pyrightconfig.json` already
names the packages it checks (`tests/` is deliberately not among them, so test stubs may be
loose). Both flags matter:

- **`-m "not expensive"` — do not omit this.** The `expensive` marker is *registered* in
  `pyproject.toml` but **not** deselected by `addopts`, so a bare `pytest tests/` runs the
  expensive tests, and those submit real jobs to the **live Certora cloud prover**. That costs
  real money and ~6 minutes per test. Never run the suite without this filter unless a
  maintainer asked for an expensive run specifically.
- **`--no-sync`.** A bare `uv run` re-syncs first, and a default sync *prunes* this venv:
  `pytest`/`testcontainers` (group `test`), `pyright` (group `ci`), `sentence-transformers`
  (group `ragbuild`) and `certora_cli`/`torch` (extras) all live outside uv's default groups, so
  syncing uninstalls them and the next run dies at collection with `ModuleNotFoundError: No
  module named 'certora_cli'`. To (re)build the env deliberately, sync everything at once —
  every non-default group the two commands above need, `ci` (pyright) included, or the sync
  that fixes one of them breaks the other:
  `uv sync --group test --group ci --group ragbuild --extra cpu --extra certora-cli`.
- **The Rust toolchain.** That sync's default `dev` group builds the maturin crates under
  `rust/`, so it needs cargo. If the toolchain `rust-toolchain.toml` pins is not installed
  yet, install it first and on its own — `rustup toolchain install --no-self-update`, no
  argument, so rustup reads the channel, profile and components from that file. uv builds
  those crates concurrently and rustup's on-demand install is not concurrency-safe, so
  letting the build trigger it races.

## Python

### Do NOT use `from __future__ import annotations`

Never add `from __future__ import annotations` to a module. If you touch a file that has it
and it's reasonable to do so, remove it.

Why:
- It's a dead-end feature. PEP 563 (the string-annotations behaviour this import enables) was
  never made the default and has effectively been superseded by PEP 649 / PEP 749 (lazy
  evaluation) from Python 3.14 on. Relying on the `__future__` behaviour is betting on a path
  the language is moving away from — it will change/break under you in future versions.
- It doesn't actually solve the problem it's reached for. Stringizing *all* annotations breaks
  anything that introspects them at runtime — pydantic, dataclasses, `typing.get_type_hints`,
  and our own annotation-driven graph wiring (see `composer/rustapp/_llm_agent.py`, which had
  to stay eager precisely because stringized `NotRequired[T]` broke pydantic unwrapping). It
  trades one set of problems for a subtler set.

What to do instead (we target Python 3.12+):
- Modern syntax works at runtime without the future import: `X | None`, `list[str]`,
  `dict[str, int]`, `tuple[int, ...]`, PEP 695 generics (`class Foo[T]:` / `def f[T]()`).
- For a genuine forward reference (a name not yet defined where the annotation is evaluated —
  e.g. a dataclass field typed as a class defined later in the file), quote just that one
  annotation: `backend: "RustBackend"`. Quote the specific ref; don't stringize the whole module.
