# Communiqué Development Guide

## GitHub Interactions

When AI contributes GitHub content—including a pull request description, review, pull request
comment, or discussion post—append this disclosure:

`*AI-assisted — Tool: <tool>; model: <provider>/<model>; version: <version-or-unavailable>.*`

Use the exact model and version identifiers exposed by the runtime. Never infer or guess them; use
`unavailable` when either value is not exposed.
