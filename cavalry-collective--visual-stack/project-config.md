# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Visual Stack — a coding-agent plugin for interactive wireframing and UI review.
The user comments directly on a wireframe (or a running app) in a browser
workspace; the agent applies the feedback and publishes the next version into
the same workspace. The repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace
(`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) with one plugin, `plugins/vstack/`, which
also ships a Codex manifest (`.codex-plugin/`) and a Grok host adapter
(`skills/review/hosts/grok.md`).

**This repo is the thing people install; nothing is installed into it.** No
`.grok/skills/`, no `.claude/skills/`, no vendored copy of our own plugin — a
host that discovers skills from a project directory gets instructions in its
host adapter, not a checked-in skill directory that then has to be kept in sync.

Plain Node ≥ 18 ES modules, standard library only. There is no package.json,
build step, bundler, or linter. (`node_modules/` at the root appears only when
recording the README demo, which installs playwright-core.)

## Commands

Tests are standalone Node scripts — run them directly, one file per suite:

```bash
node plugins/vstack/skills/review/tests/review-lifecycle.mjs   # end-to-end review server round-trip
node plugins/vstack/skills/review/tests/host-profiles.mjs      # host profiles conform to host.schema.json
node plugins/vstack/skills/review/tests/workdir.mjs            # .vstack/local working-dir resolution
```

The shared UI shell is stamped into pages, not linked (see below):

```bash
node plugins/vstack/lib/build-shell.mjs stamp    # write lib/shell/ into every page
node plugins/vstack/lib/build-shell.mjs check    # exit 1 if any page has drifted
```

The manifests are validated by the same tool the community-marketplace review
pipeline runs:

```bash
claude plugin validate . --strict                # .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
claude plugin validate ./plugins/vstack --strict # the plugin manifest
```

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs all of the above on every pull request.

CI cannot install the plugin, so rehearse that locally before a release.
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` keeps it out of the real config: without it, a local-path
marketplace is written to user settings and shadows the published
`cavalry-collective` until it is removed. The source must be `./`, not `.`.

```bash
SANDBOX=$(mktemp -d)
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$SANDBOX/.claude claude plugin marketplace add ./
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$SANDBOX/.claude claude plugin install vstack@cavalry-collective
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$SANDBOX/.claude claude plugin details vstack   # what a user sees
rm -rf $SANDBOX
```

Nothing above runs a review end to end. For that, load the plugin from disk and
drive the skill in a real project:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/vstack
```

## Architecture

### Contracts / engine / adapters / profiles

The layering rule that everything else follows (`plugins/vstack/contracts/README.md`):

- **Contracts** (`plugins/vstack/contracts/`) define what a coding-agent host
  must provide (`host.md`), the review protocol (`review-loop.md`), and the
  bridge protocol (`bridge-loop.md`). The engine and skills depend only on these.
- **The engine speaks contracts.** `review-server.mjs`, the workspace pages, and
  the shared shell never name a product (Claude, Codex, Grok) except as data
  from a Host profile.
- **Adapters speak hosts.** Only `skills/review/hosts/*.md` may mention
  host-specific tools (Monitor, Artifact, etc.). A SKILL.md references Host ops
  (`background`, `watch_stream`, `share`, …); the adapter maps them to tools.
- **Profiles are data.** `host-profiles/<id>.json` carries UI labels, install steps, and
  capability flags; servers inject it as `window.__VSTACK_HOST__`, selected by
  `--host` / `VSTACK_HOST` (default `claude`). Loaded via `lib/host.mjs`.
- **On-disk roles are stable:** review threads use `by: "agent" | "reviewer"`.
  Older files may say `"claude"`; readers treat that as `"agent"`.

### Two engines, one live-link protocol

- `skills/review/assets/review-server.mjs` — the wireframe review loop. Serves
  a self-contained HTML page inside the workspace, or reverse-proxies a running
  app (`--app`) so the workspace shares an origin with what it annotates (that
  origin-sharing is why comments can attach to elements, not coordinates). CLI
  subcommands (`publish`, `claim`, `reply`, `ack`, `share`, `status`,
  `check`, `watch`) drive the protocol; sentinels and round records live on disk.
- `lib/json-bridge.mjs` — the live link for JSON-document pages (user-story-map,
  plus the experimental spec and phase-build tools): the page POSTs saves and
  bumps a seq counter the agent's watcher wakes on; agent edits are pushed back
  over SSE.

Both share `lib/live-link.mjs`: a `watching` heartbeat file that says an agent
session is listening, atomic write-then-rename, and one protocol-wide staleness
constant — so the invariants can't drift between engines. Servers bind to
`127.0.0.1` only and close themselves when the browser tab goes away
(SSE idle timeout).

### Self-contained pages and the stamped shell
