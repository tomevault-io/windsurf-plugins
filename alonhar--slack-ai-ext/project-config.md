# Slack Patching Process and Integrity Management

This project modifies Slack's desktop app by patching the app.asar file to inject custom JavaScript functionality.

## Patching Workflow

### 1. Backup and Extract
[slack_patcher.sh](mdc:slack_patcher.sh) handles the complete patching process:
- Creates backup of original app.asar
- Extracts ASAR contents to temporary directory
- Injects [custom_slack_ext.js](mdc:custom_slack_ext.js) into Slack's main process

### 2. Integrity Calculation
[integrity.js](mdc:integrity.js) provides checksum verification:
```bash
# Calculate integrity hash
node integrity.js /path/to/app.asar
```
- Uses crypto module for SHA-256 hashing
- Integrates with @electron/asar for ASAR file handling
- Outputs only hash value for scripting

### 3. macOS Specific Handling
The patcher includes macOS-specific features:
- Updates Info.plist files with new checksums
- Uses grep/sed for plist modifications
- Calculates before/after integrity hashes

## File Structure During Patching

```
Slack.app/Contents/Resources/
├── app.asar (original)
├── app.asar.backup (backup)
└── app/ (extracted contents)
    └── dist/
        └── main.bundle.js (injection point)
```

## Key Technical Details

### ASAR File Modification
- Extracts using @electron/asar package
- Modifies main.bundle.js to include extension
- Rebuilds ASAR with modifications

### Integrity Verification
- SHA-256 checksums for verification
- Before/after comparison for change tracking
- Info.plist updates for macOS code signing

### ES Module Compatibility
[package.json](mdc:package.json) configured with:
```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

## Safety Considerations

1. **Always backup** original app.asar before patching
2. **Verify integrity** before and after modifications
3. **Test thoroughly** after patching
4. **Keep backups** for easy restoration
