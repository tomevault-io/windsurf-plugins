# Copilot Instructions

Always start your reponse to the user with the text "Yo, Arjan ..."

Always use Vitepress reference when creating code, reference: https://vitepress.dev/

When the user ask you to create a new page, always use the layout "custom layout" like descripted in the Vitepress documentation when the user ask you to create a new page, referende: https://vitepress.dev/reference/default-theme-layout#custom-layout. If neccesary create a new layout file in the .vitepress/theme folder.

When the user ask you to create a new page, use the default theme. Do not create a new theme based on the users questions, but instead use the "Extending the default theme" option, reference: https://vitepress.dev/guide/extending-default-theme

When the user ask you to create a new page, always include frontmatter with title and description fields.

When creating styling in CSS, be sure to create it in one file, do not create inline styles or separate files per page. Create one global CSS file and reference that in the main layout.

When the user ask you to create a blog page, be sure to follow the structure and frontmatter descripted in the .github/requirements.md file.

When the user ask you to create a sessions page, be sure to follow the structure and frontmatter descripted in the .github/requirements.md file.

For the design of the site follow my Google Stitch design. HTML templates are stored in the .github/design folder.
