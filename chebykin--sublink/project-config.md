## Instructions

* Specifications should live at `specs/spec-{timestamp}.md` with the most recent
  spec available at `specs/spec.md`.
* Spec headers should include the date and hour:minute derived from the
  filename timestamp. Example:
  `specs/spec-20260404143823.md` -> `2026-04-04 14:38`.
* If we redesign something there should be a new complete spec created with a
  current timestamp. Thus we cann see the decision flow over the time.
