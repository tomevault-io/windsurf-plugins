# PM Toolkit - Cursor Rules

## Project Context

PM Toolkit is a Cursor extension for visual markdown editing, kanban boards, and file viewing. Target users are product managers and non-developers.

## Versioning

Uses CalVer: `YYYY.MM.MICRO` (e.g., `2026.02.0`)
- Bump MICRO for features/fixes within a month
- Reset to `YYYY.MM.0` for first release of a new month
- Version is in `package.json`

## Architecture

- `src/` - Extension code (Node.js, VS Code API)
- `webview/` - Browser code (Tiptap, dnd-kit, Mermaid)
- `tests/e2e/` - Playwright tests

## Code Style

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Support light/dark themes via `document.body.classList.contains('vscode-dark')`
- Use Lucide icons
- Inline styles when CSS doesn't work reliably in webviews
- Write E2E tests for new features

## Key Libraries

- Tiptap (editor)
- dnd-kit (drag-drop)
- Mermaid (diagrams)
- Lucide (icons)
- Playwright (tests)

## Important

- Target Cursor, not VS Code
- Keep data in plain markdown
- User-focused documentation

## Commands

```bash
npm run compile      # Build
npm run watch        # Dev mode
npm run test:e2e     # Run tests
```
