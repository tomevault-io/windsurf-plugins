# Nano Banana Image Skill

This repository contains a portable image-prompting skill pack.

@./SKILL.md

## Additional context

- `README.md` explains installation and cross-agent usage.
- `schemas/authoring-base.json` defines the rich authoring contract.
- `schemas/runtime-compact.json` defines the compact runtime payload.
- `skills/core/` contains modular prompting logic.
- `examples/` provides valid sample inputs and outputs.

## Guidance

- Keep responses concrete and model-aware.
- Prefer explicit composition, lighting, and layout instructions over generic quality filler.
- For edits, preserve unchanged elements explicitly before describing changes.
- When modifying the repo, keep `docs/` intact and update examples with schema changes.
