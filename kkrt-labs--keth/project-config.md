# Cairo Coding Standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for function names: `func is_not_zero(value) -> felt {`
- Use PascalCase for struct names: `struct EthereumException`
- Use snake_case for variables: `let current_value = x`
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants: `const MAX_STACK_SIZE = 1024`

## Code Organization
- Group related functions and types in the same file
- Follow the directory structure of the Ethereum Execution Specs
- Separate interface from implementation where appropriate
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility

## Testing
- Write tests in Python using the `cairo_run` fixture in @conftest.py
- Test both success and error cases
- Use hypothesis for property-based testing
- Mirror the source directory structure in the test directory
- Compare Cairo results with Python reference implementations
