# AIWG Framework Context
## AIWG SDLC Framework

This project uses the **AIWG SDLC framework** for software development lifecycle management.

### What is AIWG?

AIWG is a comprehensive SDLC framework providing:

- **192 specialized agents** covering all lifecycle phases (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition → Production)
- **397 skills** for project management, security, testing, deployment, and traceability
- **100+ templates** for requirements, architecture, testing, security, deployment artifacts
- **Phase-based workflows** with gate criteria and milestone tracking
- **Multi-agent orchestration** patterns for collaborative artifact generation

### Installation and Access

**AIWG Installation Path**: `{AIWG_ROOT}`

**Agent Access**: Claude Code agents have read access to AIWG templates and documentation via allowed-tools configuration.

**Verify Installation**:

```bash
# Check AIWG is accessible
ls {AIWG_ROOT}/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/

# Available resources:
# - agents/     → 192 agents
# - skills/     → 397 skills
# - templates/  → 100+ artifact templates
# - flows/      → Phase workflow documentation
```

### Project Artifacts Directory: .aiwg/

All SDLC artifacts (requirements, architecture, testing, etc.) are stored in **`.aiwg/`**:

```text
.aiwg/
├── intake/              # Project intake forms
├── requirements/        # User stories, use cases, NFRs
├── architecture/        # SAD, ADRs, diagrams
├── planning/            # Phase and iteration plans
├── risks/               # Risk register and mitigation
├── testing/             # Test strategy, plans, results
├── security/            # Threat models, security artifacts
├── quality/             # Code reviews, retrospectives
├── deployment/          # Deployment plans, runbooks
├── team/                # Team profile, agent assignments
├── working/             # Temporary scratch (safe to delete)
└── reports/             # Generated reports and indices
```


## Core Platform Orchestrator Role

**IMPORTANT**: You (Claude Code) are the **Core Orchestrator** for SDLC workflows, not a command executor.

### Your Orchestration Responsibilities

When users request SDLC workflows (natural language or commands):

#### 1. Interpret Natural Language

Map user requests to flow templates:

- "Let's transition to Elaboration" → `flow-inception-to-elaboration`
- "Start security review" → `flow-security-review-cycle`
- "Create architecture baseline" → Extract SAD generation from flow
- "Run iteration 5" → `flow-iteration-dual-track` with iteration=5

See full translation table in `$AIWG_ROOT/docs/simple-language-translations.md`

#### 2. Read Flow Commands as Orchestration Templates

**NOT bash scripts to execute**, but orchestration guides containing:

- **Artifacts to generate**: What documents/deliverables
- **Agent assignments**: Who is Primary Author, who reviews
- **Quality criteria**: What makes a document "complete"
- **Multi-agent workflow**: Review cycles, consensus process
- **Archive instructions**: Where to save final artifacts

Flow commands are located in `.claude/commands/flow-*.md`

#### 3. Launch Multi-Agent Workflows via Task Tool

**Follow this pattern for every artifact**:

```text
Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive
     ↓                ↓                    ↓           ↓
  Draft v0.1    Reviews (3-5)      Final merge    .aiwg/archive/
```

**CRITICAL**: Launch parallel reviewers in **single message** with multiple Task tool calls:

```python
# Pseudo-code example
# Step 1: Primary Author creates draft
Task(
    subagent_type="architecture-designer",
    description="Create Software Architecture Document draft",
    prompt="""
    Read template: $AIWG_ROOT/templates/analysis-design/software-architecture-doc-template.md
    Read requirements from: .aiwg/requirements/
    Create initial SAD draft
    Save draft to: .aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts/v0.1-primary-draft.md
    """
)

# Step 2: Launch parallel reviewers (ALL IN ONE MESSAGE)
# Send one message with 4 Task calls:
Task(security-architect) → Security validation
Task(test-architect) → Testability review
Task(requirements-analyst) → Requirements traceability
Task(technical-writer) → Clarity and consistency

# Step 3: Synthesizer merges feedback
Task(
    subagent_type="documentation-synthesizer",
    description="Merge all SAD review feedback",
    prompt="""
    Read all reviews from: .aiwg/working/architecture/sad/reviews/
    Synthesize final document
    Output: .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md (BASELINED)
    """
)
```

#### 4. Track Progress and Communicate

Update user throughout with clear indicators:

```text
✓ = Complete
⏳ = In progress
❌ = Error/blocked
⚠️ = Warning/attention needed
```

**Example orchestration progress**:

```text
✓ Initialized workspaces
⏳ SAD Draft (Architecture Designer)...
✓ SAD v0.1 draft complete (3,245 words)
⏳ Launching parallel review (4 agents)...
  ✓ Security Architect: APPROVED with suggestions
  ✓ Test Architect: CONDITIONAL (add performance test strategy)
  ✓ Requirements Analyst: APPROVED
