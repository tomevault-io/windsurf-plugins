# AGENTS.md

The project instructions for coding agents live in **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** — read that file.

It is the single source of truth for:

- the hard constraints (pure-Rust single static binary, rustls-only, startup/size budget),
- the **license: Apache-2.0** since 2026-08-03 — *not* PolyForm Noncommercial — and the **CLA**
  every contributor agrees to (`CLA.md`, enforced by `.github/workflows/cla.yml`; the DCO sign-off it
  replaced is gone),
- the **two git remotes** (`origin` = private `dawnofcd/Aizen_agent`, `public` = `aizen-stack/aizen`)
  and which slug belongs in user-facing URLs,
- build/verify commands and the known distribution gaps.

Keep this file as a pointer only; put the actual content in `CLAUDE.md` so the two never disagree.
