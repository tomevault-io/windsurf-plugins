description: After a GitHub release, delete experimental temp artifacts

# Cleanup after release

Whenever a **GitHub release** (tag + `gh release create` / push of versioned APK·FAP) finishes successfully, immediately delete **experimental temporary files** from this workspace.

## Remove

- `dist/local-test/` and any `*-local.apk` / `*-local.aab`
- One-off experiment APKs/FAPs (names like `lang-detect`, `dual-labels`, `stack-arrows`, scratch builds)
- Ad-hoc staging dirs under `dist/` that are not the just-published version folder (e.g. `dist/v0.5.4-release-fw`)
- Other scratch outputs created only for that experiment (temp scripts, dump folders), unless the user asked to keep them

## Keep

- The release staging folder for the version just shipped (e.g. `dist/v0.5.6/`) unless the user asks to wipe `dist/` entirely
- Generator caches such as `tools/.cache/` (not experiment leftovers)
- Normal Android/Gradle build dirs (`android/**/build/`) — do not force-clean unless asked

## When

- End of the same turn/session as the release, without waiting for the user to remind
- Also clean leftover experiment artifacts found later if a prior release skipped cleanup
