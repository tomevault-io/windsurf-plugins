# dynamic-views

- **Error surfacing**: `new Notice()` ONLY for user-initiated action failures and confirmations. Internal and background failures MUST use `console.error`/`console.warn` — NEVER surface notices for operations the user did NOT trigger.
- **`--size-*` over `px`**: Use Obsidian's `--size-*` CSS variables (e.g., `var(--size-2-2)`) instead of hardcoded pixel values whenever a matching token exists.
- **No `:has()` in card selectors**: NEVER use `:has()` on elements inside `.dynamic-views` that exist in quantity (cards, properties, covers, previews) or re-evaluate on interaction. `:has()` causes upward style invalidation — with N cards × M properties, a single class toggle triggers O(N×M) recalculation. Use render-time CSS classes instead (e.g., `.has-label`, `.has-poster`).

## Terminology

- **Plugin name**: NEVER abbreviate the plugin name to 'DV' in the codebase, stylesheet, or any user-facing text. ALWAYS use the full name 'Dynamic Views'. The 'DV' shorthand is acceptable in fleeting chat contexts ONLY.
- **Prefix**: NEVER use the `dv-` prefix as a shorthand for Dynamic Views. ONLY use the full `dynamic-views-` prefix in ALL contexts.
- **View names**: ALWAYS capitalize plugin view names: 'Grid', 'Masonry', 'List' NOT 'grid', 'masonry', 'list'. Do NOT capitalize when referring to the layout itself rather than the view as a whole.
- **Card views**: NEVER use the term 'card view' (singular). Use 'Grid' or 'Masonry' instead. To refer to both collectively, use 'card views' (plural).
- **Avoid 'base'**: NEVER use 'base' to mean 'default' in comments, docs, file names, function/class/variable names, or any user-facing text — ambiguous with Obsidian's Bases core plugin. Use synonyms like 'standard', 'core', and 'initial' instead.
- **Style Settings**: NEVER abbreviate to 'SS' in comments, docs, or user-facing text. ALWAYS use the full name 'Style Settings'. To refer to a singular option, use 'style setting' (lowercase).
- **Text preview**: When referring to the Markdown-stripped text shown on cards, ALWAYS use 'text preview' NOT 'preview'. Use 'previews' (plural) ONLY when referring to both text preview and thumbnail image format collectively.
- **Properties**: In user-facing text, use 'properties' (NOT 'frontmatter', 'front-matter', or 'YAML') when referring to YAML metadata at the top of Markdown files. 'Frontmatter' and 'YAML' are acceptable in code, comments, docs, and tests.
- **Markdown**: 'Markdown' is a proper noun and MUST be capitalized.
- **Pane vs viewport**: Use 'pane' when referring to the scroll container's visible dimensions (`scrollEl.clientHeight`/`clientWidth`). Reserve 'viewport' for the full app window (`window.innerHeight`/`innerWidth`).
- **WebKit over iOS/iPadOS**: In comments, identifiers, docs, and chat, use 'WebKit' when code targets both iOS and iPadOS (both use WKWebView). Use 'iOS' or 'iPadOS' ONLY when targeting one platform specifically. `Platform.isIosApp` and other external Obsidian API names are exemptions. NEVER use 'WebKit' in user-facing text (README, wiki, settings, notices) — use 'iOS' and 'iPadOS' instead.

## Popout window safety

- **Derive from DOM**: In `src/shared/`, `src/bases/`, and `src/datacore/`, NEVER use bare `document`, `window`, `new ResizeObserver`, `new IntersectionObserver`, `getComputedStyle`, `matchMedia`, `navigator`, or `document.createElement`. ALWAYS derive from the nearest DOM element via `getOwnerWindow(el)` (`src/utils/owner-window.ts`) or `el.ownerDocument`. `ResizeObserver` from the wrong window silently fails on popout elements.
- **Module-level code**: When module-level code needs all open documents (no DOM element in scope), use the `setDocumentProvider` pattern — a module-level setter registered from `main.ts` onload via `getAllPopoutDocuments()`.
- **Safe exceptions**: `document.body.classList` reads for config classes (Style Settings syncs to all documents), `setTimeout`/`setInterval`/`requestIdleCallback` (process-level), `new Image()` for network validation (never inserted into DOM), offscreen `document.createElement('canvas')` for measurement.
- **Reference**: See `knowledge/electron-popout-quirks.md` for the full list of cross-window pitfalls, safe patterns, and mitigations.

## Datacore parity

- **Current state**: Datacore card views display ONLY hardcoded properties (`file.tags`, `file.mtime`). Custom user-defined properties are NOT yet supported.
- **Future work**: Datacore will gain full property display parity with Bases — configurable property lists, custom timestamp properties, labels, icons, and ALL rendering features. Shared helpers in `render-utils.ts` (`isTimestampProperty`, `getTimestampIcon`) already accept both `BasesResolvedSettings` and `ResolvedSettings`.
- **Lay the foundation**: When working on shared infrastructure (helpers, types, rendering logic), ALWAYS design it to work with both backends. Wire up Datacore call sites even when the feature is NOT yet observable there.
