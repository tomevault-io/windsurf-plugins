# Overview
This project is a Node.js tool to generate markdown descriptions for files using Cloudflare. The main entry point is [dist/index.js](mdc:dist/index.js), built from TypeScript sources. All code must be written in English, including comments and documentation.

# Essential Code Elements
- Use TypeScript for all source files.
- Always include type annotations for function parameters and return values.
- Use the latest version of the @modelcontextprotocol/sdk as specified in [package.json](mdc:package.json).
- Use dotenv for environment variable management.
- Use zod for schema validation.
- All code, comments, and documentation must be in English.

# Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class and type names.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.

# Deprecated Patterns
- Do NOT use JavaScript files in the source directory; always use TypeScript.
- Do NOT use default exports; always use named exports.

# Example Patterns
```ts
// Good: Named export
export function generateMarkdownDescription(filePath: string): string {
  // ...implementation
}

// Bad: Default export
export default function generateMarkdownDescription() {}
```

# Verification Steps
- Ensure all new or modified files pass TypeScript compilation (`npm run build`).
- Ensure all code is commented in English.
- Check that all dependencies are listed in [package.json](mdc:package.json).
- Verify that no deprecated patterns are used.

# Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to use type annotations.
- Using default exports instead of named exports.
- Writing comments or documentation in non-English languages.

# Updating Rules
Keep this file updated with any changes to project structure, dependencies, or coding standards.
