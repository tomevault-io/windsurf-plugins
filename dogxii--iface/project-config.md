# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

iFace is a Vite React 19 + TypeScript app. Main code lives in `src/`:

- `src/pages/` contains route screens such as `Dashboard`, `Practice`, and `QuestionDetail`.
- `src/components/layout/` holds shell UI; `src/components/ui/` holds reusable widgets.
- `src/store/` contains app stores, and `src/hooks/` contains React hooks.
- `src/lib/` contains IndexedDB, question loading, and sync helpers.
- `src/types/` and `src/data/` hold shared types and schemas.
- `public/questions/` stores bundled question JSON assets by category.
- `api/auth.js` is the Vercel auth endpoint.

Keep generated or temporary source material in `tmp/` unless it becomes product content.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use Bun for package and script commands.

- `bun install` installs dependencies from `bun.lock`.
- `bun dev` starts the Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173`.
- `bun run build` runs TypeScript checks and creates the production Vite build.
- `bun run preview` serves the built app.
- `bun run check` runs Biome without writing changes.
- `bun run lint` runs `biome check --write .` and may modify files.
- `bun run format` formats files with Biome.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Biome is the source of truth. Use 2-space indentation, 100-character lines, single quotes, no required semicolons, trailing commas in JavaScript/TypeScript, and no trailing commas in JSON. Name components and pages in `PascalCase`, hooks as `useSomething`, and stores as `useSomethingStore`. Keep route screens in `src/pages/` and reusable pieces in `src/components/`.

## Testing Guidelines

There is no dedicated test runner configured. Before submitting changes, run `bun run check` and `bun run build`. For UI changes, manually verify importing bundled questions, practicing, viewing details, settings, and AI configuration paths. If adding tests, place them near the code under test and add a package script.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Git history and README use Conventional Commits, for example `feat: update content and fix lint build issues`, `fix: fix synchronization issues`, and `chore: refactor gistSync`. Keep messages imperative and scoped to one concern.

Pull requests should include a short summary, validation commands run, linked issues when applicable, and screenshots for visible UI changes. Mention data migration, IndexedDB, localStorage, or bundled question JSON changes explicitly.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit secrets. Use `.env.example` as the public template, and keep API keys in local browser settings or environment-specific configuration. Treat imported question JSON as untrusted input and validate changes against the existing schema before publishing.
