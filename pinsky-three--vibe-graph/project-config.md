# Vibe-Graph Code Intelligence

This project has an MCP server (`vg serve --mcp`) that provides semantic code
analysis tools. Use these tools instead of manual file exploration when
possible.

## Available Tools

| Tool               | Use When                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `search_nodes`     | Finding files/modules by name or path pattern              |
| `get_dependencies` | Understanding imports and dependents of a file             |
| `impact_analysis`  | Before modifying files, to see what might break            |
| `get_node_context` | Getting detailed info about a specific file with neighbors |
| `list_files`       | Browsing directory contents with filtering                 |
| `get_git_changes`  | Checking current uncommitted changes                       |

## Available Resources

| Resource             | Contents                                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `vibe://graph`       | Full codebase graph (nodes + edges)     |
| `vibe://graph/nodes` | All nodes (files, modules, directories) |
| `vibe://graph/edges` | All edges (dependencies, containment)   |
| `vibe://git/changes` | Current git working tree status         |

## When to Use These Tools

### Exploring the Codebase

Instead of reading multiple files to understand structure:

```
1. search_nodes with query to find relevant files
2. get_dependencies to understand relationships
3. get_node_context for detailed view with neighbors
```

### Before Making Changes

ALWAYS run `impact_analysis` before modifying any source file:

```
impact_analysis(paths: ["crates/vibe-graph-core/src/lib.rs"], depth: 2)
```

This reveals:

- Files that depend on what you're changing
- Test files that might need updates
- Transitive impact through the dependency graph

### Finding Related Code

Use `get_dependencies` with both incoming and outgoing:

```
get_dependencies(node_path: "src/lib.rs", incoming: true, outgoing: true)
```

### Understanding Module Structure

Use `list_files` with filters:

```
list_files(path: "crates/", extension: "rs", kind: "file")
```

## Project-Specific Context

This is a Rust workspace with multiple crates:

- `vibe-graph-core` - Core graph types (SourceCodeGraph, GraphNode, GraphEdge)
- `vibe-graph-ops` - Operations and scanning logic
- `vibe-graph-mcp` - MCP server implementation (this is the tool provider)
- `vibe-graph-cli` - CLI (`vg` command)
- `vibe-graph-viz` - Visualization (WASM + native)
- `vibe-graph-automaton` - Cellular automaton framework

The graph represents the codebase as nodes (files, directories, modules)
connected by edges (contains, uses/imports).

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Use `search_nodes` first, then
   `get_node_context` on specific results
2. **Check impact before edit**: Run `impact_analysis` to avoid breaking
   dependents
3. **Use graph over grep**: The graph captures semantic relationships, not just
   text patterns
4. **Refresh awareness**: After significant edits, the graph may be stale until
   `vg sync` or server restart
