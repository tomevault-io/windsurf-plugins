# shiny-prep

Preparation environment for R Shiny development in a pharma/clinical context. Contains Claude Code tooling (agents, rules, skills), a RAG knowledge base, and reference examples.

## Knowledge Base & Skills (use these first)

Two curated assets back all work in this repo. Reach for them before relying on training memory — they are the project's highest-value resources, and every agent is wired to consult them.

- **RAG knowledge base** — search it with the `mcp__shiny-rag__rag_search` MCP tool; list what's ingested with `mcp__shiny-rag__rag_list_sources`. It holds authoritative, version-pinned docs for the packages this project uses (bslib, plotly, DT/gt, shinytest2, mirai, log4r, renv, R6, shinydashboard/bs4Dash, the CDISC SDTM/ADaM IGs, and more). Trust the RAG over memory when they disagree — it reflects the exact package versions targeted here. The server is `rag/mcp_server.py`, registered in `.mcp.json`.
- **`.claude/skills/`** — 23 auto-invoked skill files, each encoding the house-standard pattern for a specific task (layout, tables, modules, reactivity, async, testing, error-handling, CDISC validation, app frameworks). The relevant skill overrides any generic approach. Read it before writing the code it governs.

## Agent Workflow

For new features, follow this pipeline in order:

1. **shiny-feature-planner** -- requirements intake, clarifying questions, parallelizable implementation plan
2. **shiny-ux-arbiter** -- UI/UX design decisions (layout, components, CSS, interaction patterns)
3. **shiny-r-architect** -- R/Shiny code implementation, architecture decisions, R6 design
4. **r-test-developer** -- unit tests, testServer(), AppDriver tests, roxygen updates
5. **r-code-reviewer** -- final quality gate (style, performance, codebase impact)

Plus a sixth, on-demand agent:

- **shiny-debugger** -- diagnoses broken behavior: cryptic R errors, blank/non-updating outputs, reactive-graph problems (loops, over-firing), namespace/ID mismatches, and deployment failures. Invoke it whenever something is broken, at any point in the workflow.

Not every task needs all 5 pipeline steps. Small bug fixes can go straight to the architect (or the debugger if something is broken). But for new features, start with the planner. Each agent keeps persistent notes in `.claude/agent-memory/<agent-name>/`.

### Definition of Done — the Acceptance Gate (non-negotiable)

A feature is **not done because the code reads correctly and the unit tests pass.**
It is done when **the actual application runs and every user-facing surface works.**
Reading code, writing `testServer()` tests, and a green test count are all proxies —
they have repeatedly passed while the real app crashed on first launch (a bad
`actionButton(icon=)`, a NULL client cascading into "closure is not subsettable",
a tab that errors on render). Before any feature is reported complete:

1. **Launch the real app in a fresh, renv-activated process** — the way a user runs
   it, not a sourced/parsed session. From the repo root:
   `NOT_CRAN=true Rscript -e 'source("renv/activate.R"); shiny::runApp("<app>")'`.
2. **Exercise every user-facing surface** — every tab/screen, not just the one the
   headline feature lives on. An `AppDriver` all-tabs smoke test
   (`testing` rule 6) is the cheap way: visit each nav panel, assert the app log has
   no `FATAL`/`ERROR` and the browser console is clean.
3. **Report coverage honestly** — state which surfaces were actually exercised and
   which were not. "97 tests pass" is not a coverage statement; "all 5 tabs opened
   clean, streaming verified end-to-end, export untested" is.
4. **Re-run after every fix** — including fixes applied during code review. A fix is
   not trusted until the app has been relaunched with it in place.

This gate is owned by **r-test-developer** (builds the smoke coverage) and enforced
by **r-code-reviewer** (cannot issue an "approved" verdict without evidence the app
was launched and every surface exercised). See `.claude/rules/testing.md` rules 6–7.
