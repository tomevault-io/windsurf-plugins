# CTOAi Workspace Instructions

## Scope
These instructions apply to all work in this repository.
When constraints overlap, apply sections in this priority order:
1. Architecture Defaults
2. Canonical Commands
3. Coding Conventions
4. Agent Routing
5. CI And Core Integrity
6. Operational Pitfalls
7. Link, Do Not Embed
8. Agent Response Rules
If instructions conflict within the same section, follow the most specific instruction.
If ambiguity remains, choose the safest reversible action and state at most one explicit assumption before proceeding.

## Architecture Defaults
- Treat the project as four coordinated layers: agent definitions, prompt/scoring engine, runner orchestration, and governance policy.
- Keep boundaries clear:
  - agent model and capabilities: `agents/`
  - prompt templates and tool scoring: `prompts/`, `scoring/`
  - orchestration runtime: `runner/`
  - release and approval policy: `policies/`, `workflows/`
- Preserve BRAVE(R)-driven structure when editing agent execution logic: keep phases explicit—Background (context setup), Role (agent persona and constraints), Action (tool execution steps), Values (decision criteria and guardrails), Examples (few-shot evidence), Result (structured output schema). See `docs/AGENT_PROMPT_DEFINITIVE.md` for canonical terminology.

## Canonical Commands
- Use the workspace tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json` as first choice.
- Core local loop:
  - `CTOA: Bootstrap Product Config`
  - `CTOA: Check Update Gate`
  - `CTOA: Run All Tests`
  - sprint-specific `CTOA: Sprint-XXX Validate ...`
  - `CTOA: Launch Pack`
- Default test command: `python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e -v`
- Lint (auto-fix): `ruff check --fix . && ruff format .`
- Core integrity check: `python scripts/ops/core_guard.py --check`
- Core manifest update (after intentional protected-file changes): `python scripts/ops/core_guard.py --update`

## Coding Conventions
- Keep changes minimal and scoped; do not refactor unrelated modules.
- Prefer deterministic, auditable outputs for runner and governance changes.
- Preserve status/gate semantics in orchestration flows (`NEW -> IN_PROGRESS -> IN_QA -> IN_CI_GATE -> WAITING_APPROVAL -> RELEASED|BLOCKED`).
- Use atomic write patterns for runtime state files where already established.

## Agent Routing
Route tasks to the owning agent before implementing. Quick reference (see `agents/ctoa-agents.yaml` for full registry):

| Domain | Owning Agent |
|---|---|
| Sprint planning, GO/NO-GO decisions, escalation | `queen-ctoa` |
| Backlog, roadmap, Definition of Done | `pm-roadmap` |
| Prompt design, A/B testing, prompt tuning | `prompt-forge` |
| Tool/model selection, cost-risk tradeoffs | `tool-advisor` |
| UX/UI design, frontend infrastructure | `design-infra-lead` |
| MMO/Tibia domain intelligence | `mmo-intel` |
| Lua scripting and automation | `lua-scripter` |
| Bot system architecture | `bot-architect` |
| Source code implementation | `builder-engine` |
| Quality, regression, security validation | `qa-safety` |
| Release packaging, gate enforcement | `ci-publisher` |
| Failure diagnosis, root cause analysis | `debugger` |
| Runbooks, API docs, architecture diagrams | `documenter` |

## CI And Core Integrity
- `core/` guardrails are mandatory for protected assets.
- If protected files change intentionally, update manifest with `python scripts/ops/core_guard.py --update` in the same change set.
- For verification or pre-PR checks, run `python scripts/ops/core_guard.py --check`.

## Operational Pitfalls
- In PowerShell+SSH flows, avoid unescaped `$` interpolation in remote commands; use existing scripts in `scripts/ops/ctoa-vps.ps1` when possible.
- Keep secrets in environment variables or local `.env` files, never in committed source.
- Treat `runtime/` as transient evidence/state unless specific artifacts are intentionally versioned.

## Link, Do Not Embed
- For detailed procedures, link to canonical docs instead of duplicating content:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md`
  - `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
  - `docs/SPRINT_GOVERNANCE.md`
  - `docs/CORE_GUARDRAILS.md`
  - `docs/REPO_HYGIENE_POLICY.md`
  - `docs/MOBILE_CONSOLE.md`

## Agent Response Rules
- Keep responses concise, direct, and implementation-oriented.
- Do not expose internal reasoning or chain-of-thought markers (e.g., `<think>`, `</think>`).
- Do not narrate self-correction or apology loops; replace with one direct corrected answer.
- Do not end with a generic follow-up question unless a concrete decision or next step is required from the user.
- When correcting output, correct once and proceed.
- When the user sends `/analyze-prompt`, analyze the prompt content first, then return: objective, constraints, ambiguities, likely failure modes, and a tightened prompt rewrite.
- When a user asks for help interpreting an Azure Activity Log, first summarize: timeline, `operationName`, `status` and `subStatus`, affected `resourceId`, `caller`, and `correlationId`.
- Highlight security-sensitive or high-impact changes explicitly (for example role assignments, policy changes, deletes, networking changes, Key Vault access, or resource creation failures).
