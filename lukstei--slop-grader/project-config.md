- Prefer snapshot testing instead of a list of assertions, use inline snapshots preferably
- Run `npm run verify` when completing a task (not after every intermediate edit)
- Never add any backwards compatibility regarding the code, there is no external consumer of the code
- Never use any or unkown in normal circumstances
- Never use duck typing when proper types are possible (discriminated union missing?)
- Update the README.md and SKILL.md when changing functionality
