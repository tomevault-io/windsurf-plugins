- Tech stack: React (vite), Tailwind, ShadCN, Firebase Auth, Supabase postgres, pnpm, Node.JS, Hono API
- Use `pnpm add` when installing new packages.
- Use `npx shadcn add` to add new shadcn components.
- You are not able to see or modify .env files directly - so tell the user what they should add to the file if needed.
- Avoid classes/OOP and use a functional programming style.
- Never try to start the app itself (I have it running in a separate terminal) 
- When conducting data schema changes that impact the database, just write the sql to a file and I will run it myself. Don't write any foreign key constraints or cascades.
- Don't ever use sonner, toast, or notifications
- Don't use mkdir - directories will be created automatically when you make files
- Any imports should be at the top of the file (no inline dynamic imports)
