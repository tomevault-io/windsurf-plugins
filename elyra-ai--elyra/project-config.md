# Elyra - AI Agent Guidelines

## Project Overview

Elyra is a set of AI-centric extensions to JupyterLab Notebooks. It provides
a visual pipeline editor, batch job execution for notebooks/scripts, reusable
code snippets, AI assistant integration, and hybrid runtime support.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.10+, Jupyter Server, Tornado
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, JupyterLab 4.x, React
- **Build:** Hatchling (Python), Lerna + Yarn (JS), Makefile orchestration
- **Testing:** pytest (backend), Jest (frontend unit), Cypress (integration)
- **Linting:** ruff/black (Python), ESLint + Prettier (TypeScript)
- **Runtimes:** Apache Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install all dependencies and build
make install-all-dev

# Run backend tests
make test-server

# Run frontend unit tests
make test-ui-unit

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Lint all code
make lint
```

## Coding Conventions

### Python

- Follow PEP 8; use `black` for formatting and `ruff` for linting
- Type annotations are required for all public functions
- Use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` instead of `print()`
- Catch specific exceptions; avoid bare `except:`
- Use Google-style docstrings for public classes and methods
- Tests use `pytest` with fixtures; prefer `@pytest.mark.parametrize`

### TypeScript / JupyterLab

- Follow the existing ESLint + Prettier configuration
- JupyterLab extensions follow the `@elyra/<extension-name>` namespace
- Frontend packages are managed via Lerna monorepo in `packages/`

### Dependency Constraints

- **`uuid` (in `packages/pipeline-editor`):** Pinned to `^3.4.0`. The
  pipeline-editor package is CommonJS (no `"type": "module"` in its
  `package.json`) and the build uses TypeScript `module: Node16` /
  `moduleResolution: Node16`. uuid v7+ removed the `./v4` subpath
  export, and uuid v11+ is ESM-only — both shapes conflict with the
  package's CJS+Node16 setup. **Do not bump `uuid` past `^3.x`** in
  this package unless the pipeline-editor is first migrated to ESM
  (`"type": "module"`) or the tsconfig is switched to a bundler-aware
  module resolution. If Dependabot opens a uuid major bump PR for
  this package, close it with a reference to this constraint.
- The same constraint applies to any other dependency in this
  package that goes ESM-only; verify CJS support before accepting
  major version bumps.

### General

- Copyright header required on all source files (Apache 2.0)
- **MANDATORY:** Every commit MUST be signed off with `git commit -s`
  (or `git commit --signoff`) to comply with the
  [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).
  Commits without a `Signed-off-by:` trailer will be rejected by the
  DCO check and cannot be merged. Configure `git config commit.gpgsign`
  separately if cryptographic signing is also desired; the DCO sign-off
  is a distinct, always-required text trailer.
  - **AI agents:** the project's "signing" requirement is the DCO
