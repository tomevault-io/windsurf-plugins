# Bro framework

Bro is the agent system:
independent specialised agents (a "Bro") each run as a stateless LLM loop with their own system prompt and MCP-tool access.
The conceptual model is `README.md`;
this file maps the repository and carries the rules every change follows.
Every subsystem carries its own `AGENTS.md`, titled after what the subsystem is rather than the path it sits at:
read the one for each subsystem you touch, and follow its pointers as questions arise rather than reading ahead.
Run any script with `--help` for flags.

## Map

The repository is a uv workspace.
All published members depend on `bro`;
core imports none of them, and `bro-ride` spawns rather than imports `bro-native`.

| Directory | Distribution | What it is | Map |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bro/`, `bros/bro/` | `bro` | the framework core: the persona declaration and what composes and runs one, the declaration vocabulary, and the minimal `bro` persona with the spells every bro inherits | `bro/AGENTS.md` |
| `native/` | `bro-native` | the native engine and `bro` command | `native/AGENTS.md` |
| `dev/` | `bro-dev` | the `bro.dev` and `bro.workflow` packages, `poll-pr` and `pr-state`, and the development personas | `dev/AGENTS.md` |
| `ride/` | `bro-ride` | top-level `ride`, the managed-workspace runtime and both harness adapters | `ride/AGENTS.md` |
| `oops/` | `bro-oops` | consumer-neutral deployment and operations machinery | `oops/AGENTS.md` |
| `oops/cdk/` | `bro-oops-cdk` | the AWS CDK stacks `bro-oops` deploys, and this repository's CDK app; deliberately **not** a member, it locks, syncs and tests in an environment of its own | `oops/cdk/AGENTS.md` |
| `bench/` | `bro-bench` | the launcher-side benchmark credentials, registered worker type, and session commands | `bench/AGENTS.md` |
| `webview/` | `bro-webview` | the registered browser worker type, owner and profile-setup commands, image, daemon, and capture process | `webview/AGENTS.md` |
| `local/` | `bro-local` | this checkout's own personas and policy scripts, kept out of every published wheel by riding the root's `dev` dependency group | `local/AGENTS.md` |
| `benchmark/` | `bro-benchmark` | the Terminal-Bench harness adapter; deliberately **not** a member, it locks, syncs and tests in an environment of its own | `benchmark/AGENTS.md` |

The root also carries `pyproject.toml` (core distribution metadata, the workspace table, and the tool config every member runs under),
`conftest.py` (test isolation: `local/AGENTS.md`, "Test gate"),
and `README.md` (the front page: the framework's features and limits, shown on one example crew, linking into the references).
Reference docs for framework users live in `bro/reference/` and ship in the wheel:
`extending.md` (declaring and registering a bro, adding a data source or a toolset, the entry-point groups), `conditions.md` and `template.md` (conditioning in code and in text), `ride.md` (the runtime), and `dive_in.md`.
`BOOTSTRAP.md` is the executable checklist for adopting the framework in another repository.

## Development

`./setup.sh` syncs the workspace and installs the repository hooks;
it leaves the environments of the projects outside the workspace (`benchmark/.venv`, `oops/cdk/.venv`) alone, which are synced on demand, by their gate stages or by hand.
Run the repository's console scripts and its own shell scripts through `uv run -q <command>` (`uv run -q ./format.sh`, `uv run -q run-tests --changed`) or `.venv/bin/<command>`;
`-q` keeps uv's own sync report out of the command's output.
A session that carries a `bro::banner` tool runs on a frozen runtime bundle whose `PATH` publishes these same command names;
activating the checkout's venv over it would shadow them with the code being edited.
The root owns the formatter, lint, and ruff/pytest/pyright/dependency policy for every member, and the test gate for all of them:

- `./format.sh` — format and autofix the whole repository
- `run-tests --changed --base origin/<base>` — the pre-push gate, narrowed to what the diff against the pull request's base can reach;
  the whole gate is the pull request's CI.
  The stages, the narrowing, and the opt-in and host-only stages: `local/AGENTS.md`, "Test gate"
- `sync-scripts --project <directory>` — regenerate a distribution's `[project.scripts]` and committed `_entrypoints.py`, then `uv sync --all-packages --all-groups --all-extras`
- `uv build --package <distribution>` — build a member's wheel;
  `benchmark/`'s and `oops/cdk/`'s are `uv build --directory <directory>`, since neither is a member to name with `--package`

The development style policy is `dev/bro/prompts/dev/style.md`, tool-served to dev sessions as `dev-style-source::read`;
shell scripts follow `dev/bro/dev/shell_policy.py` (prelude sourcing, shebang), enforced repository-wide by `local/bro/local/shell_policy_test.py`,
and pass ShellCheck, which reads each file's dialect off its shebang and follows the sourced libraries through the root `.shellcheckrc`;
markdown prose follows the semantic line breaks of `dev/bro/dev/markdown_policy.py`, enforced repository-wide by `local/bro/local/markdown_policy_test.py` and checked over a reflow by `check-markdown`;
