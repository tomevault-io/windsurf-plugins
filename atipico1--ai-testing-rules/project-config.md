# Testing Rules

Rules for any agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) writing or modifying tests in this repo.
Drop this file at the project root. Agents read it automatically.

## Core Philosophy

1. Test behavior, not implementation. Pure refactors must not break tests.
2. Mock only at the system boundary. Everything inside is real.
3. Prefer Classist (Chicago) TDD. Mockist (London) rots fast in AI-driven codebases.
4. Fewer meaningful tests beat many leaky ones.

## Mocking Rules

**Mock these** — and only these:
- Database / ORM
- Third-party HTTP APIs
- Filesystem, clock, randomness, network
- Anything crossing a process boundary

**Never mock these:**
- Value objects, DTOs, entities you own
- Pure functions and utilities
- Internal collaborators (services/modules in the same codebase)
- The unit under test (if tempted, your unit boundary is wrong)

Prefer an HTTP-level fake (e.g. `wiremock`, `msw`, `nock`) over a trait/interface mock.
Prefer a real temp filesystem (`tempfile`, `tmp.dirSync()`) over a mocked `fs`.

## Assertion Rules

- Assert on **return values** and **observable state**.
- Do not make `toHaveBeenCalledWith(...)` / `verify(...)` / `expect(spy).toBe(...)` the primary verification.
- Compare whole objects over field-by-field assertions (`expect(result).toEqual(expected)`).
- Never snapshot non-deterministic output (LLM text, timestamps, ordering-free sets).

## Naming Rules

Test names state observable behavior. Never method names or internal calls.

```
// Bad — implementation-flavored
test_findUnique_called_once()
test_calls_upsert_then_emits_event()
should_work()

// Good — behavior
returns_cached_result_when_fetched_within_ttl()
rejects_login_when_password_is_expired()
charges_full_price_for_non_vip_users()
```

Template: `<subject>_<expected_behavior>_when_<condition>`

## Structure Rules

| Layer | Purpose | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | Pure logic, entities, utils | Many, in-memory, milliseconds |
| Integration | Module + real DB/queue | Moderate, per critical module |
| E2E | Critical user journeys | Few, one per journey |
| Regression | One per past incident | As bugs happen |

- One E2E per critical journey. A handful of integration tests per domain.
- Unit tests only where logic is non-trivial. No unit tests for getters, DI wiring, or framework glue.
- Colocate unit specs next to source. Keep integration/E2E in a separate tree.
- Gate expensive live tests behind an env flag (`LIVE_TEST=true`, `RUN_EXPENSIVE=1`).

## Domain Entity Rules

Extract a domain entity when **any** of these are true:
- Business logic is scattered across 2+ services on the same data.
- A service does arithmetic or state transitions on a plain DB row.
- You need to spin up a DB to test logic that is secretly pure.

```
# Before — logic in the service, tied to ORM
user.hunger = user.hunger - EAT * 2
user.energy = user.energy + SLEEP * 2
db.user.update(user)

# After — logic in the entity, service only persists
user.eat()
user.sleep()
user_repo.save(user)
```

Then `User.eat()` is a pure in-memory unit test. Milliseconds, no mocks, no drift.

## Property-Based Testing

For anything with a clear invariant over a large input space (parsers, encoders,
sorters, validators, state machines), use property-based tests in addition to
example tests. Libraries: `fast-check` (TS), `hypothesis` (Python), `proptest` (Rust).

Rule: if you're writing the 4th example test for the same function, switch to a property.

## Flaky Test Rules

1. Never commit a flaky test. If one lands, quarantine within 24h.
2. Quarantine means: skip with a linked issue, owner, and deadline. No owner = delete.
3. Fix flakiness at the root — never by retry loops, `sleep()`, or higher timeouts.
4. Common roots: shared global state, real clock, test ordering, unseeded randomness, network. Fix the root, not the symptom.

## Migration Rules (existing Mockist codebase)

Do not rewrite existing tests for sport. Apply incrementally:

1. **New tests** from today onward follow these rules fully.
2. **Touched files**: when editing a test, convert its mocks at the boundary only.
3. **Worst offenders first**: identify top 3-5 files with the most `toHaveBeenCalledWith` — rewrite those one domain at a time.
4. Introduce a real database (Testcontainers / docker-compose) for **one** high-risk domain first. Expand only after the pattern is proven.
5. Delete snapshot tests on non-deterministic outputs. Replace with structural assertions or delete.

## Workflow Rules

- Write the failing test from the spec **first**, then implement against it.
- Never generate code first and ask an agent to "write tests for this file" — that produces coverage theater locked to the current implementation.
- One behavior per test. If you need three `expect()` to describe one behavior that is fine; if you are testing three behaviors, split into three tests.

## PR Red Flags — Reject or Rework

- More `mock.*` calls than real assertions.
- `toHaveBeenCalledWith` / `verify()` as the only assertion.
- Imports reaching into `_internal/` or private module paths.
- Snapshots of LLM, timestamp, or network output.
- `it.skip` without a linked issue and owner.
- Tests renamed every time the function under test is renamed (leakage).
