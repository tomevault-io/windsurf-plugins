# Documentation Guidelines

## Purpose
This rule defines where different types of documentation should be placed and what should be committed to version control.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Private Planning & Development Notes
**Location**: `docs/cursor/` (gitignored)

**Purpose**: Per-session notes, design decisions, and planning docs for AI/developer reference during active development.

**Rules**:
- Use ALL CAPS with underscores (e.g., `PLAN_FEATURE_X.md`, `UI_DESIGN.md`)
- These files are for internal reference only and should NOT be committed
- They are automatically ignored by git via `.gitignore`

**Examples**:
- `docs/cursor/PLAN_MULTI_MODAL_AI_STUDIO.md`
- `docs/cursor/UI_DESIGN.md`
- `docs/cursor/IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md`

### 2. Public Documentation
**Location**: `docs/` (committed to git)

**Purpose**: Documentation for fellow developers, users, and contributors.

**Rules**:
- Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `session-management.md`, `api-reference.md`)
- Must be useful for other developers or users
- Should be maintained and kept up-to-date
- Focus on "how to use" rather than "why we decided"

**Examples**:
- `docs/SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md` - How session recording works
- `docs/AUDIO_MODES.md` - Guide to audio device options
- `docs/TIMELINE_DESIGN.md` - Timeline visualization concepts

### 3. Root-Level Temporary Docs
**Location**: `./` (project root)

**Rules**:
- **DO NOT** create CAPITAL LETTER markdown files in the root directory for one-time development information
- **DO NOT** commit files like `WEBUI_READY.md`, `PHASE1_PROGRESS.md`, `PROJECT_STATS.txt`, etc.
- These types of notes should go in `docs/cursor/` instead
- Exception: Standard project files like `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md` are fine

**Wrong** ❌:
```
/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
/WEBUI_IMPROVEMENTS.md
/SESSION_SUMMARY.md
/UNIFIED_CHAT_PANEL_STRUCTURE.md
```

**Right** ✅:
```
/docs/cursor/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
/docs/cursor/WEBUI_IMPROVEMENTS.md
/docs/cursor/SESSION_SUMMARY.md
/docs/cursor/UNIFIED_CHAT_PANEL_STRUCTURE.md
```

### 4. Standard Root Files (Allowed)
These are the only documentation files that should exist in the project root:
- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `LICENSE` - License information
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and changes
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines (if needed)

## Git Workflow

Before committing:
1. Check for CAPITAL LETTER `.md` files in root: `ls *.md | grep -E '^[A-Z_]+\.md$'`
2. Move any found files to `docs/cursor/` if they're development notes
3. Delete them if they're no longer needed
4. Only commit files from the approved list above

## AI Assistant Behavior

When creating documentation during development:
- Always place development/planning notes in `docs/cursor/`
- Ask before creating any new markdown files in the root directory
- Suggest moving existing root markdown files to `docs/cursor/` when encountered
- Only create user-facing docs in `docs/` when explicitly requested
