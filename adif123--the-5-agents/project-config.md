# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project is a multi-agent content creation system. A primary "CEO" agent orchestrates a team of specialized sub-agents, each responsible for a different aspect of content production. The agent roster and their roles will be defined as the project evolves.

## Project Structure

Custom Claude configuration lives under `.claude/`:

- `.claude/agents/` — sub-agent definitions for the content team
- `.claude/skills/` — reusable skills available to agents in this project
- `.claude/commands/` — custom slash commands for this project
