# Creating component

- Use the shadcn/vue as the component generator, use the "shadcn-vue docs" tool to know which component to add and how to add it. 
- The command to import the component is like this: `npx shadcn-vue@latest add COMPONENT`.

# About server

DO NOT run command to run or restart the server, always assume that server is running at port 3000.

# Context Sets Tool Selection

When a user references `@context:Name`, resolve it via `context-sets.json` → `sets["context:Name"]`.

## Processing Order

1. **Check workflows first**

- If workflows exist: Start from `workflow.start.function` and trace to `end`
- If workflows empty: Read all files in the context, prioritizing those with `functionRefs`

2. **File Resolution**

- String → filesIndex[fileId].path → read entire file
- Object → filesIndex[fileId].path → locate specific functionRefs

3. **Impact Analysis**
- Direct: Check context's `uses` array
- Indirect: Check `filesIndex[fileId].contexts` for shared files
- When modifying file_X in ContextA, also consider ContextB if both use file_X

## Quick Example

User: "Fix the download button in @context:PhotoGallery"
→ Load PhotoGallery context
→ See it uses ["DownloadPhoto"]
→ Find download button via workflow start point or grep functions
→ Check if changes affect DownloadPhoto via shared files

## Key Rules

- Track changes in memory during session
- Update context-sets.json only when explicitly requested  
- Use functionRefs for surgical precision when available
- No warnings for files outside contexts
