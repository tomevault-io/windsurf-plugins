# Klangk agent instructions

Project-specific guidance for coding agents working in this repo.

## Prefix most commands with `devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell --`

Klangk uses [devenv](https://devenv.sh) (Nix-based) for its dev environment. **Every command that touches the project toolchain must be run through the devenv shell**, including git. The toolchain — Python venv, Node, Dart/Flutter, podman, pre-commit hooks, etc. — only exists inside the shell.

```bash
devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- git commit -m "..."
devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- pytest
```

The flags: `--quiet` suppresses noisy devenv output; `-O dotenv.enable:bool false` prevents devenv from loading `.env` (which can interfere with test environments that set their own env vars via monkeypatch). `shell --` launches an ephemeral shell with the full environment, runs the command, and exits — this is the pattern agents should use for one-off commands. (`devenv shell` with no `--` drops into an interactive shell; not useful for non-interactive agents.) This applies to **all** commands: builds, tests, lint, `git`, `podman`, `flutter`, `gh`.

A long-running interactive `devenv up` (backend + nginx + workspace image build) is a human-facing workflow; agents generally don't run it. If you need the backend up for something, ask.

## Running tests (match CI)

Always run the test suites **the way CI runs them**. The exact invocations
are:

```bash
# Backend (100% coverage gate)
devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- python -m pytest src/backend/tests -v -n auto

# CLI (100% coverage gate)
devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- python -m pytest src/cli/tests -v -n auto

# Frontend
devenv --quiet -O dotenv.enable:bool false shell -- flutter test --coverage
```

`-n auto` (pytest-xdist) is **not optional** for the Python suites — it's how
CI runs them, and for the backend it is the difference between a real and a
bogus coverage number. The backend `conftest.py` sets
`COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon` specifically so that code executed inside
SQLAlchemy's greenlet context is tracked **in each xdist worker**; without
`-n` (a single-process run) that tracking under-counts and you'll see a
false ~93% total with heavy files like `api/auth.py` reported at ~55%.
Run with `-n auto` and coverage matches CI (100%, every module). Don't try
to "reproduce" a coverage drop from a single-process run — re-run with
`-n auto` first.

The 100% coverage gate is enforced in both Python suites; a new code path
with no test will fail the build. When iterating fast on one file you can
scope with `-k` / a path and add `--no-cov`, but re-run the full suite
**with** coverage (and `-n auto`) before committing.

## Process manager: devenv 2.x native (not process-compose)

`devenv processes up` / `devenv up` use **devenv 2.x's built-in process manager**,
not process-compose. Consequences when debugging a managed stack:

- `devenv processes list|status|logs|restart <NAME>` work without a separate
  `process-compose` daemon running — there is no `process-compose` binary or
  socket to look for. `ps` will **not** show a `process-compose` process; the
  manager is devenv itself.
- A crashed process is restarted by devenv's own supervisor (the journal shows
  `Process exited (Failure), restarting` / `Restarted (attempt N)`), and after
  enough attempts the whole `devenv processes up` invocation exits.
- On hosts that run the stack under systemd, the unit's `ExecStart` is
  `devenv processes up` (foreground, `DEVENV_TUI=false`); a crash loop in one
  process takes the unit down. Debug by running the suspect process directly
  under the devenv shell (bypassing the supervisor) to see its real stderr.

## Changelog (`docs/changes.md`)

`docs/changes.md` is the single source of truth for human-authored release notes,
formatted as [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). It has two
rendering surfaces:

- **Docs site** — the whole file renders as one page at `/changes/`, sidebar entry
  "Changelog" (nav is in `zensical.toml`). Includes the `## [Unreleased]`
  section, so in-flight work is visible.
- **Release tab** — when a `v*` tag is pushed, `release.yml` checks out the code
  **at the tag**, extracts that version's `## [<version>]` section, and prepends it
  to GitHub's auto-generated notes (PR list + compare link).

### When to add an entry

Add a bullet under `## [Unreleased]` **in the same PR that introduces the change**
(not as an afterthought, not after merge). Use the matching subsection:

- **Added** — new feature, config var, CLI flag, endpoint.
- **Changed** — change to existing behavior, default, or signature.
- **Deprecated** — soon-to-be-removed.
- **Removed** — now removed.
- **Fixed** — notable bug fix.
- **Security** — vulnerability fix.
- **Breaking** — sub-section under any version for changes requiring operator/integrator
  action on upgrade. Call out the migration.

Each entry: one line, reference the issue/PR (`(#1375)`), enough context that an
operator skimming the changelog understands the impact.

Add an entry for anything an **operator, integrator, or end user** would notice:
new/changed config or defaults, behavior changes, security fixes, notable fixes,
new features.
