# Svelte 5 Component Library Development Instructions

Instructions for building high-quality Svelte 5 component libraries with modern runes-based reactivity, TypeScript, and performance optimization.

## Project Context
- Svelte 5.x component library (not SvelteKit/full application)
- Runes system for all reactivity ($state, $derived, $effect, $props, $bindable)
- TypeScript with strict mode for type safety
- Component-scoped styling with CSS custom properties
- Rollup for bundling library components
- Playwright for end-to-end component testing

## Development Standards

### Architecture
- Use Svelte 5 runes system for all reactivity instead of legacy stores
- Design components to be reusable and composable
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Create base/wrapper components for shared functionality
- Extract reusable logic into composable functions
- Use slots and snippets for flexible component composition
- Export all public components from a central index file

### TypeScript Integration
- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json` for maximum type safety
- Define interfaces for component props using `$props()` syntax
- Extend appropriate HTML element types (e.g., `HTMLAnchorAttributes`, `HTMLButtonAttributes`)
- Use `Omit<>` utility type to exclude conflicting attributes
- Type event handlers and callbacks properly
- Use generic types for reusable components
- Generate TypeScript declarations for library consumers
- Implement proper type checking with `svelte-check`

### Component Design
- Follow single responsibility principle for components
- Use `<script lang="ts">` with runes syntax as default
- Keep components small and focused on one concern
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript
- Use slots and snippets for flexible composition
- Design components to be testable and reusable

### Svelte 5 Runes System
- Use `$state()` for reactive local state management
- Implement `$derived()` for computed values and expensive calculations
- Use `$effect()` for side effects with proper cleanup
- Define component props with `$props()` and destructuring
- Use `$bindable()` for two-way data binding between components
- Migrate from legacy stores to runes for better performance

### State Management
- Use `$state()` for local component state
- Use `$derived()` for computed values that depend on props or state
- Use `$effect()` for side effects with proper cleanup
- Keep component state minimal and focused
- Implement context API with `setContext`/`getContext` for component hierarchies
- Avoid external state management libraries when possible

### Styling
- Use component-scoped styles with `<style>` blocks
- Implement CSS custom properties for theming and design systems
- Use `class:` directive for conditional styling
- Follow BEM or utility-first CSS conventions
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use `:global()` sparingly for truly global styles

### Performance Optimization
- Use keyed `{#each}` blocks for efficient list rendering
- Implement lazy loading with dynamic imports and `svelte:component`
- Use `$derived()` for expensive computations to avoid unnecessary recalculations
- Leverage SvelteKit's automatic code splitting and preloading
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking and proper imports
- Profile with Svelte DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks

### Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for operations that may fail
- Provide meaningful error messages to component consumers
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Handle edge cases and invalid prop values gracefully
- Consider error boundaries for complex component trees

### Testing
- Write tests for component rendering and behavior
- Use Playwright for end-to-end component testing
- Test component behavior, not implementation details
- Verify proper accessibility attributes and structure
- Test that components accept and handle all props correctly
- Use data-testid attributes for reliable test selectors
- Test custom class and style prop overrides
- Verify SVG icons and visual elements render correctly

### Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Use `@html` directive carefully and validate HTML content
- Properly encode URLs and query parameters (use `encodeURI()`, `encodeURIComponent()`)
- Validate prop values and handle invalid input gracefully
- Be cautious with dynamic href and src attributes
- Ensure external links use `target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements and proper heading hierarchy
- Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Provide proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG guidelines
- Test with screen readers and accessibility tools
- Implement focus management for dynamic content

## Implementation Process for Component Libraries
1. Set up project structure with proper folder organization
2. Configure build tooling (Rollup/Vite) for library bundling
3. Define TypeScript interfaces for component props
4. Create base/wrapper components for shared functionality
5. Implement specific components with Svelte 5 runes
6. Add component-scoped styling with proper class naming
7. Export all public components from index file
