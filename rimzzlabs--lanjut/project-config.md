# AGENTS.md

## Lanjut -> Resume -> Résumé.

An ATS Builder. Free, Open-Source, local-first resume builder. Customizable presentation layer, constrained structural layer for ATS parseability.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- open-next on Cloudflare (hosting only, no server-side handling of user resume data)
- shadcn (base-ui variant)
- Tailwind CSS
- [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/docs) (rich text editing, restricted extension set)
- motion/react (animation)
- zustand (in-memory state)
- IndexedDB via idb (persistence layer)
- date-fns
- @mobily/ts-belt (general utilities)
- commitlint + commitizen (commit message enforcement)
- husky + lint-staged (pre-commit hooks)
- nuqs (search params state)

@mobily/ts-belt is the single utility library. Do not introduce radash or any second utility library with overlapping purpose.

## Architecture Rule: Two Layers

1. Structural layer. Fixed section types (header, summary, experience, education, skills, custom sections from an approved list). Each field has a restricted TipTap schema: bold, italic, bullet list, ordered list, link. No tables, no multi-column layout, no text boxes, no inline images, no custom heading levels beyond what the section template defines.

2. Presentation layer. Typography, spacing, color, accent styles, section visual ordering. Fully customizable. Must never alter the underlying linear text structure used for parsing or export.

Any feature request that adds structural freedom (tables, columns, floating elements, decorative icons in text runs) is out of scope unless it is presentation-only and degrades gracefully to plain text in export.

## Data and Storage


- zustand holds working state, synced to IndexedDB on change (debounced).
- No resume content is sent to any server, API route, or open-next function. Confirm this on every PR touching data flow.
- Schema for a resume document: versioned. Add a schema version field. Write a migration path before changing field shapes, do not silently break old saved resumes.


## Reordering

- Section and entry reordering (if/when built) changes ordering metadata only. It does not alter content schema.

## Export

- PDF export must preserve linear reading order. Do not use a method that achieves visual layout via absolute positioning that breaks text extraction order. Verify with a text-extraction test (e.g., pdftotext) after any change to the PDF generation path.
- Provide a plain text or .docx export path in addition to PDF. This is the actual ATS-safe submission format for many applicant tracking systems.
- Before marking export work done, run output through at least one real parser test (Workday/Greenhouse test upload, or an open-source resume parser) and confirm fields map correctly.

## Commits

- Use commitizen format via commitlint config. Do not bypass with --no-verify.
- husky pre-commit runs lint-staged. Do not commit with failing lint or format checks.

## Build Order (do not reorder without reason)

1. Resume data schema + IndexedDB layer
2. zustand store wired to persistence
3. TipTap fields with restricted schemas
4. Presentation layer (themes, typography, spacing)
5. Export pipeline (PDF, then docx/txt)
6. Parser validation pass

## Non-Goals

- No backend account system. No server-side storage of resume content.
- No structural customization that compromises ATS parseability, regardless of how the request is framed (templates, themes, layouts).
- No second utility library duplicating @mobily/ts-belt.

## Code Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode on.
- No `any` without inline justification comment.
- Components live in `./src/components/<domain-name>/*`, grouped by their domain (e.g. `./src/components/landing/landing-hero.tsx`). Never a global `components/` dump by type, and never colocated under `src/app/` route folders.
- Shared non-primitive components (used across domains, but not base UI primitives) live in `./src/components/shared/*`.
- Shared UI primitives only in the shadcn-managed `./src/components/ui` directory.
- No comments restating what code does. Comment only on complex logic where intent is not recoverable from reading the code (e.g., a non-obvious mathematical computation, a workaround for a library bug, a non-standard algorithm).
- Do not reach for `useEffect` as a default tool for state synchronization, computed values, or event response. Before adding a `useEffect`, check whether the case matches one of the patterns in https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect. Valid `useEffect` use is limited to synchronizing with an external system (IndexedDB writes, subscriptions, third-party widget instances). Derived state belongs in render or in zustand selectors, not in an effect that copies state into state.
