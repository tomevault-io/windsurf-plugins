# Project Skills

Read and apply the following skill files before processing any request:

- [\_claude/skills/caveman-mode.md](_claude/skills/caveman-mode.md) — Terse output mode. Activated with `/caveman` or "caveman mode". Cuts ~75% of output tokens.
- [\_claude/skills/terse-commits.md](_claude/skills/terse-commits.md) — Ultra-compressed commit messages. Conventional Commits format, 50 char subjects.
- [\_claude/skills/terse-reviews.md](_claude/skills/terse-reviews.md) — One-line code review comments. Location + severity + problem + fix.
- [\_claude/skills/compress-docs.md](_claude/skills/compress-docs.md) — Compress .md/.txt files into terse format. Backs up originals.

Caveman mode is **off by default**. Activate it by saying "caveman mode" or `/caveman`. Other skills activate when relevant (commits, reviews, doc compression).
