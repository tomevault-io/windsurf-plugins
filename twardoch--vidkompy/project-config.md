## 1. Coding style

<guidelines>
# When you write code

- Iterate gradually, avoiding major changes
- Minimize confirmations and checks
- Preserve existing code/structure unless necessary
- Use constants over magic numbers
- Check for existing solutions in the codebase before starting
- Check often the coherence of the code you’re writing with the rest of the code.
- Focus on minimal viable increments and ship early
- Write explanatory docstrings/comments that explain what and WHY this does, explain where and how the code is used/referred to elsewhere in the code
- Analyze code line-by-line
- Handle failures gracefully with retries, fallbacks, user guidance
- Address edge cases, validate assumptions, catch errors early
- Let the computer do the work, minimize user decisions
- Reduce cognitive load, beautify code
- Modularize repeated logic into concise, single-purpose functions
- Favor flat over nested structures
- Consistently keep, document, update and consult the holistic overview mental image of the codebase.

Work in rounds:

- Create `PLAN.md` as a detailed flat plan with `[ ]` items.
- Identify the most important TODO items, and create `TODO.md` with `[ ]` items.
- Implement the changes.
- Update `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` as you go.
- After each round of changes, update `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes.
- Update `README.md` to reflect the changes.

## 2. Keep track of paths

In each source file, maintain the up-to-date `this_file` record that shows the path of the current file relative to project root. Place the `this_file` record near the top of the file, as a comment after the shebangs, or in the YAML Markdown frontmatter.

## 3. When you write Python

- Use `uv pip`, never `pip`
- Use `python -m` when running code
- PEP 8: Use consistent formatting and naming
- Write clear, descriptive names for functions and variables
- PEP 20: Keep code simple and explicit. Prioritize readability over cleverness
- Use type hints in their simplest form (list, dict, | for unions)
- PEP 257: Write clear, imperative docstrings
- Use f-strings. Use structural pattern matching where appropriate
- ALWAYS add "verbose" mode logugu-based logging, & debug-log
- For CLI Python scripts, use fire & rich, and start the script with

```
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run -s
# /// script
# dependencies = ["PKG1", "PKG2"]
# ///
# this_file: PATH_TO_CURRENT_FILE
```

Ask before extending/refactoring existing code in a way that may add complexity or break things.

When you’re finished, print "Wait, but" to go back, think & reflect, revise & improvement what you’ve done (but don’t invent functionality freely). Repeat this. But stick to the goal of "minimal viable next version". Lead two experts: "Ideot" for creative, unorthodox ideas, and "Critin" to critique flawed thinking and moderate for balanced discussions. The three of you shall illuminate knowledge with concise, beautiful responses, process methodically for clear answers, collaborate step-by-step, sharing thoughts and adapting. If errors are found, step back and focus on accuracy and progress.

## 4. After Python changes run:

```
./cleanup.sh;
```

Be creative, diligent, critical, relentless & funny! </guidelines>

# `vidkompy`

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/vidkompy.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/vidkompy/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/twardoch/vidkompy.svg)](

**Intelligent Video Overlay and Synchronization**

`vidkompy` is a powerful command-line tool engineered to overlay a foreground video onto a background video with exceptional precision and automatic alignment. The system intelligently handles discrepancies in resolution, frame rate, duration, and audio, prioritizing content integrity and synchronization accuracy over raw processing speed.

The core philosophy of `vidkompy` is to treat the **foreground video as the definitive source of quality and timing**. All its frames are preserved without modification or re-timing. The background video is dynamically adapted—stretched, retimed, and selectively sampled—to synchronize perfectly with every frame of the foreground content, ensuring a seamless and coherent final output.

## 5. Features

### 5.1. Video Composition

- **Automatic Spatial Alignment**: Intelligently detects the optimal x/y offset to position the foreground video within the background, even if they are cropped differently.
- **Advanced Temporal Synchronization**: Aligns videos with different start times, durations, and frame rates, eliminating temporal drift and ensuring content matches perfectly over time.
- **Foreground-First Principle**: Guarantees that every frame of the foreground video is included in the output, preserving its original timing and quality. The background video is adapted to match the foreground.
- **Drift-Free Alignment**: Uses optimized sliding window algorithms to create globally optimal, monotonic alignment, preventing the common "drift-and-catchup" artifacts.
- **High-Performance Processing**: Leverages multi-core processing, direct pixel comparison, and optimized video I/O to deliver results quickly.
- Sequential video composition is 10-100x faster than random-access methods.
