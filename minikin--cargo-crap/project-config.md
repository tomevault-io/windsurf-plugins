# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Specs (THE LAW)

All feature specs live in `specs/`. They are written in Gherkin style (Given/When/Then).

- **Never modify a spec file without explicit permission from the user.**
- When implementing a feature, treat its spec as the acceptance criteria.
- When a spec needs to change (scope change, new edge case), propose the change and wait for approval before editing the file.

## Before committing

1. Run `just dev` — fmt, clippy, tests, and the dogfood run (score the tool against its own source).
2. If it passes, run `just dev-mutants-diff` — mutation tests on the `src/**/*.rs` files changed vs HEAD (it re-runs `just dev` first). Skip this step only when the diff touches nothing but `.md` and/or `.yml` files.

Both must be clean before any commit. Never commit with a failing dogfood run or surviving mutants.

Exception: if the diff touches only `.md` files (docs, specs), no pre-commit check is needed — `just dev` / `just dev-mutants-diff` can be skipped.

## Commands

```bash
# Build
cargo build --all-targets

# Run tests (all)
cargo test --all-targets

# Run a single test by name
cargo test <test_name>

# Run doc tests
cargo test --doc

# Format check (CI enforces this)
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Apply formatting
cargo fmt --all

# Lint (warnings are errors in CI: RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings")
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Run the tool against this repo (dogfood)
cargo llvm-cov --lcov --output-path lcov.info --workspace
cargo run --release -- --lcov lcov.info --workspace --threshold 15 --fail-above
```

## Architecture

The tool has six orthogonal modules that feed into a pipeline:

```

         │                                        │

    file, name, start_line,              FileCoverage { lines: BTreeMap<u32, u64> }
    end_line, cyclomatic }

```

**`src/score.rs`** — Pure formula: `CRAP(m) = comp(m)² × (1 − cov(m)/100)³ + comp(m)`. No I/O, no dependencies on other modules.

**`src/complexity.rs`** — Uses `syn` to walk the Rust AST and extract `FunctionComplexity` tuples. Handles `ItemFn` (free functions) and `ImplItemFn` (methods) via the `Visit` trait. Closures are not recursed into — their decision points belong to their own scope. Uses the `ignore` crate to respect `.gitignore` during `analyze_tree`. The `proc-macro2` dependency must have the `span-locations` feature enabled to call `Span::start()`/`Span::end()` at runtime.

**`src/coverage.rs`** — Parses LCOV files using the `lcov` crate. Only consumes `SF` (source file), `DA` (line data), and `end_of_record` records. Path normalization is deliberately absent here — that responsibility belongs to `merge`.

**`src/merge.rs`** — The critical join layer. Uses `PathIndex` with two-level lookup:
- **Fast path**: canonicalized absolute paths → direct hash lookup.
- **Slow path**: component-wise suffix matching for relative LCOV paths (e.g., `src/foo.rs` matches `/home/alice/project/src/foo.rs`).
- **Critical invariant**: relative paths are never canonicalized against CWD (regression test `relative_coverage_paths_are_not_resolved_against_cwd` pins this).

**`src/delta.rs`** — Baseline comparison. `load_baseline` deserializes a previous `--format json` run; `compute_delta` runs a two-pass match (spec 13): pass 1 joins by exact `(file, function)` key, pass 2 falls back to function-name-only matching for any unpaired entries on both sides — when the name appears exactly once on each side it's reported as a move (`DeltaStatus::Moved` for pure relocations; `Regressed` / `Improved` keep their score-status, with `previous_file` set so renderers can show "moved from X"). Ambiguous names (multiple of the same name) stay unpaired. The `DeltaStatus` set is `Regressed / Improved / New / Unchanged / Moved`; baseline functions never paired land in `removed`.
