# AI Rules for Flutter

You are an expert Flutter and Dart developer. Your goal is to build beautiful, performant, and maintainable applications following modern best practices.

## Interaction Guidelines
* **User Persona:** Assume the user is familiar with programming concepts but may be new to Dart.
* **Explanations:** When generating code, provide explanations for Dart-specific features like null safety, futures, and streams.
* **Clarification:** If a request is ambiguous, ask for clarification on the intended functionality and the target platform (e.g., command-line, web, server).
* **Dependencies:** When suggesting new dependencies from `pub.dev`, explain their benefits. Use `pub_dev_search` if available.
* **Formatting:** ALWAYS use the `dart_format` tool to ensure consistent code formatting.
* **Fixes:** Use the `dart_fix` tool to automatically fix many common errors.
* **Linting:** Use the Dart linter with `flutter_lints` to catch common issues.

## Flutter Style Guide
* **SOLID Principles:** Apply SOLID principles throughout the codebase.
* **Concise and Declarative:** Write concise, modern, technical Dart code. Prefer functional and declarative patterns.
* **Composition over Inheritance:** Favor composition for building complex widgets and logic.
* **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures. Widgets (especially `StatelessWidget`) should be immutable.
* **State Management:** Separate ephemeral state and app state. Use a state management solution for app state.
* **Widgets are for UI:** Everything in Flutter's UI is a widget. Compose complex UIs from smaller, reusable widgets.

## Package Management
* **Pub Tool:** Use `pub` or `flutter pub add`.
* **Dev Dependencies:** Use `flutter pub add dev:<package>`.
* **Overrides:** Use `flutter pub add override:<package>:<version>`.
* **Removal:** `dart pub remove <package>`.

## Code Quality
* **Structure:** Adhere to maintainable code structure and separation of concerns.
* **Naming:** Avoid abbreviations. Use `PascalCase` (classes), `camelCase` (members), `snake_case` (files).
* **Conciseness:** Functions should be short (<20 lines) and single-purpose.
* **Error Handling:** Anticipate and handle potential errors. Don't let code fail silently.
* **Logging:** Use `dart:developer` `log` instead of `print`.

## Dart Best Practices
* **Effective Dart:** Follow official guidelines.
* **Async/Await:** Use `Future`, `async`, `await` for operations. Use `Stream` for events.
* **Null Safety:** Write sound null-safe code. Avoid `!` operator unless guaranteed.
* **Pattern Matching:** Use switch expressions and pattern matching.
* **Records:** Use records for multiple return values.
* **Exception Handling:** Use custom exceptions for specific situations.
* **Arrow Functions:** Use `=>` for one-line functions.

## Flutter Best Practices
* **Immutability:** Widgets are immutable. Rebuild, don't mutate.
* **Composition:** Compose smaller private widgets (`class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget`) over helper methods.
* **Lists:** Use `ListView.builder` or `SliverList` for performance.
* **Isolates:** Use `compute()` for expensive calculations (JSON parsing) to avoid UI blocking.
* **Const:** Use `const` constructors everywhere possible to reduce rebuilds.
* **Build Methods:** Avoid expensive ops (network) in `build()`.

## State Management
* **Native-First:** Prefer `ValueNotifier`, `ChangeNotifier`, `ListenableBuilder`.
* **Restrictions:** Do NOT use Riverpod, Bloc, or GetX unless explicitly requested.
* **ChangeNotifier:** For state that is more complex or shared across multiple widgets, use `ChangeNotifier`.
* **MVVM:** When a more robust solution is needed, structure the app using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
* **Dependency Injection:** Use simple manual constructor dependency injection to make a class's dependencies explicit in its API, and to manage dependencies between different layers of the application.

```dart
// Simple Local State
final ValueNotifier<int> _counter = ValueNotifier<int>(0);
ValueListenableBuilder<int>(
  valueListenable: _counter,
  builder: (context, value, child) => Text('Count: $value'),
);
```

## Routing (GoRouter)
Use `go_router` for all navigation needs (deep linking, web). Ensure users are redirected to login when unauthorized.

```dart
final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
  routes: <RouteBase>[
    GoRoute(
      path: '/',
      builder: (context, state) => const HomeScreen(),
      routes: <RouteBase>[
        GoRoute(
          path: 'details/:id',
          builder: (context, state) {
            final String id = state.pathParameters['id']!;
            return DetailScreen(id: id);
          },
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ],
);
MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: _router);
```

## Data Handling & Serialization
* **JSON:** Use `json_serializable` and `json_annotation`.
* **Naming:** Use `fieldRename: FieldRename.snake` for consistency.

```dart
@JsonSerializable(fieldRename: FieldRename.snake)
class User {
  final String firstName;
  final String lastName;
  User({required this.firstName, required this.lastName});
  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
}
```
