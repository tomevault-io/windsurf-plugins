# AGENTS.md

## Project scope

- Unofficial, macOS-only public beta for **Codex Third-Party Subagents**
  (`codex-third-party-subagents`):
  a provider-pack-based Codex Desktop fallback routing stack.
- Text, code, research synthesis, and local validation only. No image, audio,
  video, desktop, or browser handling. DeepSeek V4 Pro is explicit-only: never
  auto-route to it or broaden its controlled maintainer runtime evidence into a
  public-installer, independent-user, or general support claim.
- Node.js `>=20`, standard library only. No third-party runtime dependencies.

## Rules for agents working here

- Do not hardcode, commit, or log secrets. API keys live in the macOS Keychain
  and are read at runtime only.
- Do not execute any official provider setup script. Catalog data is retrieved at
  install time as inert text (documented, never executed) with a local
  catalog-source override; do not vendor official catalog or prompt files.
- CLI changes must keep dry-run as the default; writes require an explicit
  `--apply`.
- Custom Agent identity comes from the official TOML `name` field in
  `~/.codex/agents`; routing policy must not be documented as Host registration.
- The task bridge allows exactly one active provider task. Active slot and task
  file are owner-only (`0700` / `0600`), reject symlinks, and are atomically
  archived to `completed-*` or `failed-*`. Never overwrite or delete archives.
- Desktop preflight is a policy-assisted guardrail, not guaranteed native
  automatic interception. Document it as defense-in-depth.
- Preserve unrelated local changes. Make minimal, scoped diffs.
- Keep files small: JS/TS under 300 lines, docs concise.
- Update `docs/current-state.md` and `docs/tasks.md` on durable changes.
  Documented capabilities must match the implementation.
- GitHub Actions workflows must use read-only permissions and no secrets.

## Layout

- `src/`, `scripts/`, `tests/` — implementation and generated-file templates.
- `docs/` — architecture, configuration (中文), troubleshooting, state, tasks.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — read-only test workflow.

## Validation

- Run `npm test` (`node --test`) after changes.
- Confirm `package.json` metadata (version, license, engines) matches releases.
