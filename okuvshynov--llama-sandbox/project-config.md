## Mistakes

These are the mistakes which were encountered in the past while working on this project. You MUST try hard to avoid these mistakes in the future.

- **Documentation drift during /commit**: When using `/commit`, README.md and TECHNICAL.md were not checked for staleness. Over multiple commits (file format changes, new subcommands, BF16 reference migration, prompt restructuring), the docs fell far behind — referencing old file formats (v3 trace files instead of stats files), old subcommand interfaces (`compare -a -b` instead of `compare -f`), stale prompt counts (12 instead of 19), and Q8 as reference when BF16 was adopted. Fix: during `/commit`, always check if key documentation files (README.md, TECHNICAL.md) reference concepts that were changed in the committed code. If the commit changes file formats, CLI interfaces, model configurations, or experiment methodology, update the docs in the same commit.

- **Piping long-running commands through `tail -N`**: Smoke / sweep commands like `python validation_bench_openai.py ... 2>&1 | tail -20` were used to keep the displayed output short. The downside: while the run is active you can't see streaming progress (turn-by-turn lines); and if something interesting happened in the discarded prefix, you have to rerun the whole thing to recover it. Fix: capture full output by redirecting to a file (or use `run_in_background: true` and read the output file the harness already creates), then `head`, `tail`, or `grep` against the saved file as needed. This preserves both progress visibility and the full transcript for later inspection.

- **Scoring-contract bugs ship without scorer unit tests**: Two scoring loopholes in validation-bench's contract evolution (vb_version 0.0.7 → 0.0.8 → 0.0.9) were missed in review and only surfaced via manual reproduction during ad-hoc validation. The 0.0.7 exit-code rule credited any timeout on an invalid input as a correct rejection (`rc != 0 → TN`); the 0.0.8 verdict-only rule credited "print right verdict, then crash" as a success. In both cases the "obvious" mental model held, but the rule's full input cross-product had untested holes. Fix: any change to `run_tests` scoring or `_fail_detail` formatting needs a test that exercises (right/wrong verdict) × (clean/dirty exit) × (timeout/crash/signal/no-output). The `_FakeSandbox` stub in `test_validation_bench.py` (no docker, no live model) makes adding scorer tests cheap — the bar to extending coverage when the contract changes should be near zero.

- **Alpine-based env Dockerfiles must `apk add coreutils`**: busybox's `timeout` (the alpine default) leaks one zombie process per invocation under the harness's `sh -c "timeout -s KILL Ns ./solution"` wrapper. The zombie is reparented to PID 1 (`sleep infinity`), which doesn't reap. With `--pids-limit=256`, a 678-test corpus saturates the cgroup at test ~#250; every subsequent test fails with `timeout: vfork: Resource temporarily unavailable`, which the harness records as `no output (exit=1)`. Symptom in the data: confusion matrices clustered like `TP=0, FN=205, FP=220, TN=253` — perfectly tracking the alphabetical test order in `tests.jsonl` (invalid first, valid second), with the cgroup saturating between the two halves. *Not* a model failure, *not* a parser bug — purely the combination of alpine + `--pids-limit=256` + 678 tests + busybox timeout. Verified opus's toml-1.0-zig validator scores MCC=+1.0000 once GNU coreutils' `timeout` (`apk add coreutils`) replaces busybox's. Same fix applies to any future alpine-based env (currently `data/envs/zig/`, `data/envs/go/`). Debian-based envs (cpp17, lua, erlang) ship GNU coreutils by default and are unaffected. The `validation_bench_lib.py:569` "Go runtime maps goroutines to OS threads" hypothesis was misdiagnosing this same root cause for Go.
