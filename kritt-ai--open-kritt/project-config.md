# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI/code agents (and humans skimming for the essentials) working in the
open·kritt repo. This is the canonical agent guide; `CLAUDE.md` points here.

Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contributor flow — this file is
the fast, do/don't version.

## What this is

open·kritt is an AI-driven security vulnerability scanner. It's a **polyglot
monorepo** of cooperating services:

| Path             | What                                          | Stack                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `frontend/`      | Web UI                                        | React 18 + Vite (npm)         |
| `backend/`       | HTTP API                                      | Node + Express + Prisma (npm) |
| `engine/`        | Scan worker running the AI harnesses          | Python 3.11+ (Ruff)           |
| `database/`      | Postgres image + `init/*.sql` migrations      | Postgres 16                   |
| `executor-view/` | Executor viewer                               | Python                        |
| `scripts/`       | Repo tooling and CLI implementation           | Node                          |

The whole product ships as **one version** — the repo-root [`VERSION`](VERSION) file.

## Run / build / test

Fastest full stack: `cp .env.example .env && docker compose up --build`
(add `-f docker-compose.dev.yml` for human-readable backend logs).

For guided local onboarding, run `./kritt` for the full-screen Arrow-key menu, or use
`./kritt setup` and `./kritt start` directly (Node.js 20+ required; no npm install needed
for the CLI).

Per component:

```bash
# frontend
cd frontend && npm install
npm run dev | npm run build | npm run lint | npm run format | npm test   # Vitest

# backend  (needs DATABASE_URL; see .env.example)
cd backend && npm install
npx prisma generate && npm run migrate     # apply database/init/*.sql (idempotent)
npm run dev | npm run lint | npm run format | npm test                   # node:test

# engine
cd engine && pip install -r requirements.txt
ruff check . | ruff format . | pytest
python -m open_kritt_engine                # run the worker
```

## House rules (do)

- **Conventional Commits** for every commit: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`,
  `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`. Scope optional (`feat(frontend): …`).
- **Sign off every commit** (DCO): `git commit -s`. A CI check enforces it.
- **Lint & format before proposing changes** (ESLint/Prettier for JS, Ruff for
  Python). Match the existing style; don't reformat unrelated code.
- **DB changes are additive, idempotent, forward-only**: a new
  `database/init/NNN_*.sql` using `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` / `ADD COLUMN IF NOT
  EXISTS`, then update `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` to match. CI runs `migrate.js`
  twice to prove idempotency.
- **One version, one source of truth**: change [`VERSION`](VERSION), then run
  `node scripts/sync-version.mjs`. Never hand-edit a component's version.
- **Pin Docker image tags** (never `:latest`).

## Gotchas (don't get bitten)

- **Prisma engine is platform-specific.** A `node_modules` generated on macOS won't
  run Prisma on Linux (and vice-versa). Don't run backend/DB code against a client
  built for another OS; regenerate with `npx prisma generate` on the target platform.
- **Frontend native optional dependencies.** Rollup and esbuild ship separate
  packages per OS, architecture, and libc. Regenerate `frontend/package-lock.json`
  only from a clean dependency graph (no old lockfile or `node_modules`) so npm
  records every platform package. CI runs both `npm ci` and an Alpine/musl image
  smoke test to catch a platform-pruned lockfile.
- **Frontend version at build time** comes from `frontend/package.json` (kept in sync
  with `VERSION`), NOT `../VERSION` — the repo root isn't in the frontend Docker image.
- **Engine tests are disabled in CI for now.** Several assume a writable `/root` home
  (`~/.codex`, `~/.claude`) and one has an outdated assertion; they fail on CI runners.
  Lint-only for the engine until fixed.
- **Reserved key patterns** in scan/enrichment results are meaningful, not arbitrary:
  `_reserved_report` / `_reserved_poc` (rendered as markdown tabs) and `_chip_*`
  (post-script chips). Don't rename or strip them.
- **Custom, dependency-free Markdown renderer** lives at
  `frontend/src/components/Markdown.jsx` (escapes untrusted report/PoC text). Prefer it
  over adding a markdown dependency.
- **This is a security tool.** It runs AI agents over untrusted code and holds provider
  API keys / `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Never commit secrets (a `gitleaks` pre-commit hook helps),
  and be careful with anything that changes what data leaves the machine.

## CI / merge flow

- **CI** runs on PRs to `main` (`frontend`, `backend`, `engine`, `database`, version
  sync, DCO). It's a required check — `main` only receives CI-passing code.
- **Release** runs on push to `main` via release-please (see [`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md)).
- Lint/format steps are currently `continue-on-error` until a one-time cleanup PR; keep
  new code clean so they can become hard gates.
