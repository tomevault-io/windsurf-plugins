## Coding Standards

## DON'T DO THIS
Unless the user specifically requests it, **NEVER** perform:
- Git add or commit (fine if the user requests)
- Destructive git operations
- Render tests ineffective (make them less rigorous, skip them, delete them, etc)
Instead of performing these actions, only recommend them, and have the user confirm.

### General Guidelines
- **write ad-hoc scripts in Python**
- **Use bash** unless there's a specific reason to use powershell
- **Mind the venv**: In bash, use `.venv-wsl`; on PowerShell or CMD, use `.venv`. Both live in this repo—activate the one that matches your shell.
- **Always run tests after changes**: on Windows run `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests`; on WSL/bashe use `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.venv-wsl uv run pytest`
- **Follow coding standards**: Write code that will pass ruff and mypy

### Python Standards
- **Error Handling**: Fail fast, no silent failures, log all errors
- **Configuration**: No fallback values - fail cleanly if something is missing
- **No Unicode in Scripts**: NEVER use unicode characters (✓ emoji, etc.) in Python scripts; they FAIL in windows
- **Path Handling**: Always use `pathlib.Path()` for cross-platform paths

#### Writing and maintaining tests
- **New functionality**: Add and then run tests that cover the primary behavior, error paths, and edge cases. 
- **When modifying existing functionality**: Run tests. If they fail, read them to decide whether to update the tests to match the new contract OR fix the code. Add new tests if gaps exist.
- **Avoid brittle config assumptions**: Do not hardcode values in tests that live in config files (e.g., `config.yaml`) or environment-specific settings. They change often. Use fixtures/helpers to load config or mock via settings/env overrides instead of relying on constants.

## Setup and Run Commands

### Backend (Python)
- **IMPORTANT**: Always modify `pyproject.toml` and use `uv sync` to manage the environment, NOT `uv pip install`
  - Use `uv run`
- Before running `uv`, set `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` so it picks the right virtualenv:
  - PowerShell/CMD: `$env:UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT = ".venv"` (add to your profile for persistence).
  - WSL/Bash: `export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.venv-wsl` (add to `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`).

### Deployment (Cloud Run)
- From the repo root, activate the matching virtual environment (`.venv` on PowerShell/CMD, `.venv-wsl` on bash).
- Make sure `gcloud auth application-default login` is already configured for the `danbot-twilio` project.
- Run `python cloudrun-deploy.py` and wait for it to finish; it builds the image, updates secrets, and redeploys the service.
- The deploy script can exceed the default 2‑minute timeout in the Codex harness—if it gets killed mid-run, rerun it from a local shell outside the harness or split the workflow into smaller steps.
- Always run ``live_test_all_functions.py`` after every deploy to confirm things work.

## Helpful tools
- `gh` for github work including CI status
- `gcloud` for google cloud work including checking logs
- Twilio logs: to debug Twilio, use the helper that can be found in the file  `tests/live_test_all_functions.py`
