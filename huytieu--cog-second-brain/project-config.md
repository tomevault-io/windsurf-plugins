# COG Second Brain — Cursor Rules
# This is the Cursor-compatible version of CLAUDE.md
# COG: Cognition + Obsidian + Git — a self-evolving agentic second brain
# Inspired by Garry Tan's gstack and gbrain patterns

## Skills

COG exposes 17 skills via `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`. Each skill has a `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter. Use AGENTS.md as the universal command reference.

## Worker Agents

6 worker agents live in `.claude/agents/`. Workers handle data-heavy tasks; the lead session handles reasoning and synthesis.

- worker-data-collector: Structured extraction from GitHub, Slack, Jira, Linear
- worker-researcher: Web research with source citations
- worker-file-ops: Vault file operations, metadata, profiles
- worker-executor: Pre-approved mutations (Jira, Linear, APIs)
- worker-publisher: Publishing to Slack, Confluence, Notion
- brief-people-updater: Batch-update people profiles

## Brain-First Protocol

Before answering questions about people, projects, strategy, or decisions:
1. Read relevant notes from `05-knowledge/` first
2. If project-specific, read `04-projects/<project>/`
3. Then synthesize an answer

## Integration Preferences

Check `00-inbox/MY-INTEGRATIONS.md` before using any external integration:
- Active: use normally
- Disabled: skip silently
- Unknown: ask the user

## Vault Structure

```
00-inbox/          — Profiles, interests, integrations
01-daily/          — Briefs and check-ins
02-personal/       — Personal braindumps (private)
03-professional/   — Professional braindumps and strategy
04-projects/       — Per-project tracking
05-knowledge/      — Consolidated insights, people CRM, patterns
06-templates/      — Document templates
```

## Citation Rule

For factual statements in durable notes, include:
`[Source: [[path/to/note]] | YYYY-MM-DD | confidence: high|medium|low]`
