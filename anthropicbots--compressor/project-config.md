# Agents.md — E-commerce

## Project structure

Two independent packages (no monorepo tooling):

- `backend/` — Express 5 + MySQL2 (JWT auth, helmet, rate-limit)
  Entrypoint: `backend/server.js`
  Port: 5000 (default)
- `frontend/` — Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no framework, no build step
  Served via VS Code Live Server on port 5500

## Commands (run from `backend/`)

| Action                    | Command                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Dev server (nodemon)      | `npm run dev`            |
| Start production          | `npm start`              |
| Apply DB migrations       | `npm run migrate`        |
| Show applied vs pending   | `npm run migrate:status` |
| Adopt baseline (existing) | `npm run migrate:baseline` |

## Database

- MySQL 8.0 via docker-compose (`backend/docker-compose.yml`) or local install
- Five tables: `users`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`, `wishlist_items`
- Schema comes from the ordered sequence in `migrations/`, applied by
  `backend/scripts/migrate.js`. Never pipe SQL into `mysql` by hand — the runner
  records what it applied and checksums it, so out-of-band SQL desynchronises it.
- `migrations/0001_baseline_schema.sql` is the adopted baseline and is immutable
- `migrations/README.md` records the key strategy, which definition won for each
  table that used to be declared more than once, and what is still unreconciled
- Keys: `users`, `products` and `orders` use `CHAR(36)` UUIDs minted by the app;
  every other table uses `AUTO_INCREMENT` integers. Any column referencing those
  three must be `CHAR(36)`
- `backend/sql/` holds feature schemas not yet folded into the sequence; they are
  not applied by the runner. New schema changes go in `migrations/`
- `docs/legacy/ecommerce-mysql-dump.sql` is a historical dump, not a setup step
- DB uses utf8mb4 charset, connection pool with auto-retry and exponential backoff

## Setup

1. `cd backend && cp .env.example .env` — edit DB_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET, FRONTEND_URL
2. `npm install` in `backend/`
3. Start MySQL, create an empty `ecommerce` DB, then `npm run migrate`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Open frontend with Live Server (right-click `frontend/index.html` → Open with Live Server)

## Backend conventions

- All responses use envelope: `{ success: boolean, message: string, ... }`
- Always use safe wrappers from `utils/helpers.js` (safeNumber, safeArray, sanitizeString, escapeHTML) for input handling
- Auth: JWT Bearer token in `Authorization` header (cookie fallback via `accessToken`)
- Admin routes require `authMiddleware` + `authorizeRoles("admin")`
- Rate limits: auth endpoints 20 req/15min, API 120 req/min
- CORS allows: localhost:5500-5502, specific production URLs
- Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM; exits on unhandled rejection/exception
- Transactions: always `withTransaction(async (connection) => { ... })` from
  `config/db`. Use the connection it hands you for every statement in the
  transaction; returning commits, throwing rolls back, and the connection is
  released either way. Never issue `START TRANSACTION` as a pool query — the
  statements after it can land on other connections, so concurrent transactions
  interleave. Repositories expose the same thing as `repo.transaction(fn)`, which
  hands the callback a repository bound to the transaction's connection.

## Frontend conventions

- Shared API client: `window.CONFIG.API_BASE` (auto-detects localhost vs production)
- Utility helpers in `scripts/utils.js`: `notify(msg, type)`, `apiRequest(url, opts)`, `formatPrice(price)`, `getJSON`/`setJSON`
- Cart, wishlist, recentlyViewed stored in localStorage
- Deployed on Vercel; config in `frontend/vercel.json`

## Installed skills

| Skill                        | Usefulness in this repo                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `modern-javascript-patterns` | Vanilla JS frontend + Node.js backend; no framework or build step, so JS patterns matter |
| `responsive-design`          | E-commerce frontend in vanilla HTML/CSS must be mobile-friendly                          |
| `css`                        | Vanilla CSS, no framework; useful for consistent styling patterns                        |
| `semantic-html`              | Vanilla HTML frontend; semantic markup aids SEO and accessibility for product/cart pages |
| `accessibility-compliance`   | E-commerce checkout/forms need ARIA and keyboard support                                 |
| `wcag-audit-patterns`        | Audit companion to accessibility-compliance; useful before release                       |

## What's not here

- No test framework, no lint config, no typecheck, no CI workflows, no formatter config
- No build step for frontend
- No package manager at root (root `package.json` is a leftover with express-rate-limit only)

## Conventions from CONTRIBUTING.md

- Branch: `main` (production), `develop` (latest), `feature/*`, `fix/*`
- PRs target `develop`, include screenshots for UI changes
- No convenventional commits needed — `CONTRIBUTING.md` says nothing about commit format
