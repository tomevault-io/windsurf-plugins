# Cosmic Intelligence — Brand System

You are working on a project within the **Cosmic Intelligence** portfolio ecosystem.
All visual work must follow this brand system. When in doubt, refer back to these tokens and principles.

---

## Design Philosophy

Cosmic Intelligence is a personal portfolio brand. The aesthetic is **deep space meets clean engineering** — dark, vast, minimal surfaces punctuated by teal light and subtle cosmic motion.

**Quality bar:** Think high-end macOS screensaver. Slightly alive, shimmery, with hints of space/planets/stars. Not in your face — quietly stunning. The kind of thing that makes someone pause and say "wow" without understanding why.

**Core tension:** Precision vs. wonder. Data-driven interfaces with an undercurrent of cosmic depth.

## Design Tokens

### Colors

| Role | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Background | `#080C14` | Primary dark background — deep space |
| Surface | `#0C121E` | Cards, panels, elevated containers |
| Surface alt | `#111827` | Secondary surface, hover states |
| Border | `#1E293B` | Subtle dividers, card edges |
| Accent | `#2DD4BF` | Primary interactive — teal glow, CTAs, links |
| Accent hover | `#14B8A6` | Hover/active state for accent |
| Accent muted | `rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.15)` | Teal tint for backgrounds, glows |
| Text primary | `#E4E4E7` | Body text |
| Text muted | `#A1A1AA` | Secondary text, labels |
| Text faint | `#52525B` | Placeholder, tertiary |

### Category Accent Colors

Each project category has a designated accent. Use these for tags, indicators, and category-specific highlights — never as primary UI color.

| Category | Hex | Name |
|---|---|---|
| Finance | `#2DD4BF` | Teal (same as primary accent) |
| AI / ML | `#A78BFA` | Violet |
| OSINT / Intel | `#FBBF24` | Amber |
| Data / Analytics | `#38BDF8` | Sky |
| Infrastructure | `#F472B6` | Pink |
| Apps / Tools | `#34D399` | Emerald |

### Typography

| Role | Font | Weight | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Display / Headings | Space Grotesk | 500–700 | system-ui, sans-serif |
| Body | Inter | 400–500 | system-ui, sans-serif |
| Code / Mono | JetBrains Mono | 400 | Consolas, monospace |

**Sizes (web):**
- Hero: 48–72px, Space Grotesk 700
- Section heading: 24–32px, Space Grotesk 600
- Body: 16–18px, Inter 400
- Caption / label: 12–14px, Inter 400, text-muted color
- Code: 14px, JetBrains Mono 400

### Spacing & Layout

- Base unit: 4px
- Section padding: 64–96px vertical, 24–48px horizontal
- Card padding: 24–32px
- Card border-radius: 12–16px
- Max content width: 1200px
- Card gap: 24px

### Motion & Cosmic Effects

This is the soul of the brand. Every page should feel slightly alive.

**Background:**
- Subtle animated gradient: slow drift across deep blues and purples (`#080C14` → `#0C1220` → `#10081E`)
- Faint star field: tiny white/teal dots with gentle twinkle (opacity oscillating 0.3–0.8 over 3–6s, staggered)
- Optional: very slow-moving nebula wisps at low opacity (0.03–0.08)

**Interactive elements:**
- Teal glow on hover: `box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.15)`
- Cards lift on hover: `transform: translateY(-2px)` with 300ms ease
- Accent underlines animate width on hover (0 → 100%, 200ms)

**Transitions:**
- Default: 300ms ease for all interactive state changes
- Page/section entrance: fade-in + translateY(20px → 0) with stagger (100ms per element)
- Number counters: count-up animation on scroll-into-view (800ms)

**Performance:**
- All animations must use `transform` and `opacity` only (GPU-composited)
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — disable star field, gradient animation, and entrance animations
- Star field: use CSS or lightweight canvas, never heavy WebGL unless the project specifically warrants it

### Iconography

- Style: Lucide icons (outline, 1.5px stroke)
- Size: 16–24px depending on context
- Color: inherit from text or accent

## Per-Project Variation Rules

The brand is a **center Venn diagram** — all projects share the core tokens above, but each has wiggle room for its own personality.

**What's shared (never deviate):**
- Background color (#080C14)
- Accent teal (#2DD4BF) as primary interactive color
- Typography stack (Space Grotesk / Inter / JetBrains Mono)
- Dark-first design
- Cosmic motion (star field, subtle gradients, hover glows)
- Card-based layouts with the spacing tokens above

**What can flex per project:**
- Category accent color for highlights and secondary emphasis
- Density of cosmic effects (data dashboards = more restrained; landing pages = more expressive)
- Additional data-viz colors (follow the category palette, not random)
- Layout structure (grid vs. list vs. dashboard vs. editorial)
- Content-specific iconography

---

## Exclusions

- **Bartlett Roofing projects** (BartlettBot, bartlett-permits) do NOT use Cosmic Intelligence branding. They use their own teal + roof-industry theme. Do not apply cosmic tokens to these repos.
