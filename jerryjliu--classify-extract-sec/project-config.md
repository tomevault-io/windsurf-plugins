## What is LlamaIndex?

LlamaIndex enables developers to build AI applications that combine Large Language Models with real-world data sources. The framework is specifically designed for applications that need to work with private, proprietary, or domain-specific data.

LlamaIndex addresses the fundamental challenge that LLMs are trained on public data with knowledge cutoffs, but most valuable business applications require access to private documents, databases, APIs, and real-time information. LlamaIndex bridges this gap through agentic workflows and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.

## Agentic Applications

When an LLM is used within an application to make decisions, take actions, and/or interact with the world, this is the core definition of an **agentic application**.

Key characteristics of agentic applications include:

- **LLM Augmentation**: The LLM is augmented with tools (arbitrary callable functions in code), memory, and/or dynamic prompts
- **Prompt Chaining**: Several LLM calls are used that build on each other, with the output of one LLM call being used as the input to the next
- **Routing**: The LLM is used to route the application to the next appropriate step or state
- **Parallelism**: The application can perform multiple steps or actions in parallel
- **Orchestration**: A hierarchical structure of LLMs is used to orchestrate lower-level actions and LLMs
- **Reflection**: The LLM is used to reflect and validate outputs of previous steps or LLM calls

**Agents**: An agent is a piece of software that semi-autonomously performs tasks by combining LLMs with other tools and memory, orchestrated in a reasoning loop that decides which tool to use next. An agent receives a user message, uses an LLM to determine the next appropriate action using previous chat history and tools, may invoke tools to assist with the request, interprets tool outputs, and returns the final output to the user.

**Workflows**: A Workflow in LlamaIndex is an event-driven abstraction that allows you to orchestrate a sequence of steps and LLM calls. Workflows can be used to implement any agentic application, and are a core component of LlamaIndex.

## Core Use Cases

LlamaIndex applications can be grouped into four main categories:

[**Agents**](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/framework/module_guides/deploying/agents/index.mdx): An automated decision-maker powered by an LLM that interacts with the world via a set of [tools](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/framework/module_guides/deploying/agents/tools.md). Agents can take an arbitrary number of steps to complete a given task, dynamically deciding on the best course of action rather than following pre-determined steps.

[**Workflows**](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/framework/module_guides/workflow/index.mdx): A Workflow in LlamaIndex is a specific event-driven abstraction that allows you to orchestrate a sequence of steps and LLMs calls. Workflows can be used to implement any agentic application, and are a core component of LlamaIndex.

[**Query Engines**](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/framework/module_guides/deploying/query_engine/index.mdx): A query engine is an end-to-end flow that allows you to ask questions over your data. It takes in a natural language query, and returns a response, along with reference context retrieved and passed to the LLM.

[**Chat Engines**](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/framework/module_guides/deploying/chat_engines/index.mdx): A chat engine is an end-to-end flow for having a conversation with your data (multiple back-and-forth instead of a single question-and-answer).

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a core technique for building data-backed LLM applications with LlamaIndex. It allows LLMs to answer questions about your private data by providing it to the LLM at query time, rather than training the LLM on your data. To avoid sending all of your data to the LLM every time, RAG indexes your data and selectively sends only the relevant parts along with your query.

### RAG Pipeline Stages

There are five key stages within RAG:

1. **Loading**: Getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database, or an API - into your workflow. [LlamaHub](https://llamahub.ai/) provides hundreds of connectors to choose from.

2. **Indexing**: Creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies.
