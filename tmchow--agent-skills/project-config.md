# agent-skills

A personal, multi-skill collection of cross-platform AI agent skills
(`SKILL.md` format), installable à la carte via `npx skills`.
Each skill is self-contained and works on any Agent-Skills-compatible runtime
(Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, Cursor, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, …). The
point of this repo: distribute skills without maintaining a separate plugin
per platform — people install the whole repo or pick individual skills.

This guide is for anyone (human or agent) editing the repo. Keep it accurate
when conventions change.

## Repo layout

- `<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — required. The agent-facing instructions.
- `<skill-name>/README.md` — required. The human-facing landing page (below).
- `<skill-name>/references/` — optional. Deep material loaded on demand.
- Root `README.md` — the catalog: one row per skill.
- Root `LICENSE` — MIT.

## Adding or editing a skill

1. Directory name == the skill's `name:` frontmatter, lowercase kebab-case
   (`[a-z0-9-]`, no leading/trailing/double hyphens, 1–64 chars).
2. Write `SKILL.md` (frontmatter + body rules below).
3. Write `README.md` (human landing page — rules below).
4. Put deep or optional material in `references/`, not in `SKILL.md`.
5. Add a one-line row to the root `README.md` skill table.
6. Validate (below) before committing.

## SKILL.md frontmatter

Required: `name`, `description`, `version`.

- `name` — matches the directory; lowercase kebab-case.
- `description` — third person ("This skill should be used when…"), ≤1024
  characters, with **specific** trigger phrases. Make it tool/task-specific,
  not generic: a skill wrapping tool X must not trigger on bare "do
  X-category work" when X isn't named. Add an explicit "Do NOT use for …"
  clause when the skill could be confused with a broader category.
- `version` — semver; bump on meaningful change.

Per-runtime metadata is **optional and additive**. Unknown frontmatter fields
are ignored by runtimes that don't understand them, so these blocks are safe
to include side by side:

- `metadata.openclaw` — install directive, env vars, homepage, emoji.
- `metadata.hermes` — tags, category, required toolsets.

**Verify every runtime-specific field against that runtime's own docs before
adding it. Do not fabricate frontmatter schemas** — a wrong field can break
the skill silently in that runtime. The same goes for any CLI/command syntax
quoted in a skill: confirm it against the tool's `--help`, don't guess.

## SKILL.md body

- Imperative/infinitive voice ("Run X", "Confirm Y"), not second person.
- Progressive disclosure: keep the body focused; move long schemas, advanced
  patterns, and edge cases to `references/`.
- **No duplication across files.** A fact lives in `SKILL.md` *or* a
  reference, never both — duplicated content drifts.
- When a reference is mandatory before acting, gate it explicitly in the body
  (a capsule summary + a "read `references/X.md` in full before …" stop).

## Per-skill README.md

The human-facing landing page. GitHub renders it when someone browses the
skill directory, and it's what a person reads to decide whether to install.
It is **not** the agent instructions — that's `SKILL.md`. Include:

- One-paragraph what-it-is, in human framing.
- **Prerequisites** — external tools, accounts, or credentials the skill
  needs. This is the highest-value section; `SKILL.md` buries it.
- The single install command for *this* skill (`npx skills`).
- A few capability bullets and a link to the upstream tool/API.
- An explicit line: "SKILL.md is the agent-facing instructions; you don't
  need to read it to use the skill."

**Do not** restate the workflow, schema, exit codes, or step-by-step
procedure from `SKILL.md` — that duplicates the agent doc and drifts. Keep the
README to slow-changing metadata (purpose, prerequisites, install).

## Validate before committing

- Frontmatter parses as valid YAML.
- `name` == directory name, lowercase kebab-case.
- `description` ≤ 1024 characters.
- Any install/command syntax in `README.md` or `SKILL.md` is real — checked
  against the tool's `--help`, not guessed.
- The installer (`npx skills`) keys off `SKILL.md`; a sibling `README.md` is
  for humans and must never be required for the skill to run.
