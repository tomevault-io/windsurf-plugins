In this repository, do not persist anything to your per-user, per-machine
memory store. When you would normally write to it — a learning, convention,
gotcha, project fact, user preference, or anything else worth remembering
between sessions — route the write through the `spek-knowledge` skill
instead. The skill handles scope selection, search-before-write, and
propose-then-confirm.

Outside this repository, continue using your per-user memory store as normal.
