# claude-abap-skills

This repository contains **two independent Claude Code plugins** for modern ABAP development. It does not contain any MCP server code — it contains the rules, prompt templates, and slash commands that turn raw model output into **production-quality modern ABAP**.

> The official SAP ABAP MCP Server (`SAPSE.adt-vscode`) gives Claude **hands and eyes** into the system.
> This library gives Claude the **brain**: how to write good code, not just what to access.

This file describes the library for anyone working **on** it. End users install the plugins via `claude plugin marketplace add` — see `README.md`.

---

## Target systems

This library targets **modern ABAP only**:

- **SAP BTP ABAP Environment** (Steampunk)
- **SAP S/4HANA on-prem**, when developed in the **ABAP Cloud development model**

Everything in this library assumes those two scopes. The guidance is opinionated and intentionally narrow.

---

## Out of scope — never suggest

When working with this library, **never** generate code, refactorings, or recommendations that depend on any of the following:

- SAP ECC
- Classic non-Cloud ABAP development model (any release)
- Classic dynpro (SE51), screen exits, GUI status programming
- Logical databases, SAP Query, classic batch input
- Unreleased SAP APIs, function modules, classes, or CDS entities
- `SELECT` directly from SAP-owned application tables (e.g. `VBAK`, `MARA`)
- BAPI-style RFM modules where a released cloud API exists
- `FORM`/`PERFORM` routines, includes-only programs, classic exception groups
- `CALL FUNCTION ... DESTINATION` patterns over released communication scenarios

If existing legacy code is provided, your job is to **recognise the legacy pattern, name it, and propose a modern Cloud-compatible alternative** — not to maintain or extend the legacy pattern.

---

## Tooling assumption — the SAP ABAP MCP Server

All system access (read object source, write source, run ATC, run unit tests, browse repository, inspect releases) is assumed to go through the **official SAP ABAP MCP Server** distributed as part of `SAPSE.adt-vscode`.

- Do **not** invent your own ABAP read/write tooling
- Do **not** ask the user to paste source code if the MCP can fetch it
- When you write code back to the system, do it via the MCP and confirm changes succeeded
- For setup instructions, see `docs/mcp-setup.md`

Known MCP limitations at the time of writing (`SAPSE.adt-vscode` 1.0):
- No object-source read tool — the source of an existing class/CDS/BDEF cannot be fetched
- No repository search
- No ATC tool

Skills that need read access (review, refactor, atc-remediation, clean-core-check) currently work on **pasted** source.

### How rules reach a skill at runtime

Each plugin's `CLAUDE.md` holds the **rule set**. It is **not** auto-loaded by Claude Code (the validator warns about this — by design). Each `SKILL.md` is responsible for explicitly reading the rule files it needs:

- `clean-abap` skills read `../CLAUDE.md` (their own plugin's rules)
- `abap-cloud-rap` skills read `../CLAUDE.md` (their own plugin's rules)

The two plugins are **independent** — neither reads the other's `CLAUDE.md` at runtime. This is intentional: when plugins are installed via Claude Code's plugin system, each lives in its own versioned subdirectory (e.g. `~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-abap-skills/clean-abap/0.2.2/`), so cross-plugin relative paths cannot reliably resolve. If a contributor wants a Cloud/RAP skill to also surface Clean ABAP findings, embed the relevant rule inline in `abap-cloud-rap/CLAUDE.md` — do not reach for `../../clean-abap/CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Default behaviour

- **Always prefer released APIs.** Before suggesting any SAP object (CDS entity, class, interface, function module), assume it must have a C1 release contract. If unsure, ask Claude to verify the release state via the MCP before using it.
