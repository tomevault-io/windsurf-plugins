description: Overall project context and goals
---


This project is focused on making Nostr data easy to **archive**, **explore**, and **analyze** at network scale.
1. Right now Nostr data is spread around many relays, which makes it hard to answer basic aggregate questions (active users, activity by kind, trends) without heavy bespoke crawling.
1. Primary user: any person or application that needs to explore or consume **aggregate** Nostr data (analytics, counts, trends, datasets), not “read/write” relay behavior.
1. Non-goal: Pensieve is **not** a normal Nostr relay. It prioritizes correctness, deduplication, and analytics-friendly storage over serving realtime client subscriptions.
1. This project consists of several different crates:
    1. `pensieve-core`: core types, validation utilities, and shared helpers used across the system.
    1. `pensieve-ingest`: an ingester that connects to many relays, validates events, and writes to long-term storage + ClickHouse. See `docs/ingestion_pipeline.md` for detailed design rationale.
        1. **Architecture**: archive-first. The archive is an append-only log (source of truth); ClickHouse is a derived index built by consuming the archive.
        1. **Relay coverage**: start from a configured seed list, then discover additional relays via **NIP-65** relay lists. Relays requiring authentication (e.g., **NIP-42**) can be skipped initially. Coverage is best-effort.
        1. **Correctness**: on ingestion, recompute and validate **event IDs and signatures** (per **NIP-01**). Invalid events must not be stored.
        1. **Deduplication**: use an embedded **RocksDB** index keyed by event ID. Dedupe by event id (same event seen on multiple relays). Replaceable events are stored as distinct events because they have distinct ids.
        1. **ClickHouse correctness**: prefer **at-most-once** insertion per event id. Checkpoint at the segment level; on restart, reconcile the uncommitted tail against ClickHouse.
        1. **Deletions**: store deletion events (e.g., **NIP-09**) as normal events; do not remove referenced events from the archive. In ClickHouse, maintain a way to mark/filter "deleted" events for analytics queries.
        1. **Archive format**: length-prefixed segments (`[u32 length][event]...`), partitioned by **ingestion time**. Sealed segments are synced to remote storage (Hetzner Storage Box via rclone). The archive stores canonical Nostr events only (no ingestion-specific metadata). Event encoding uses **[notepack](https://docs.rs/notepack/)** (Nostr-specific, ~128 bytes smaller per event than CBOR).
        1. **Reliability**: the local archive log buffers events through downstream outages (ClickHouse, object storage).
    1. `pensieve-serve`: an HTTP API for analytics-oriented queries against ClickHouse (details TBD; optimized for aggregate/counted queries).
1. ClickHouse schema: `docs/clickhouse_self_hosted.sql` (starting point; will evolve to cover more common Nostr analytics use cases).
1. Observability: all parts of the system should be well instrumented with **Prometheus metrics** and **distributed tracing** (OpenTelemetry), focused on service health and performance (avoid high-cardinality labels).
1. Operations: designed to run self-hosted and deployable via Docker + configuration management (Ansible or similar).
