# Agent guide

This is a [pocopine](https://github.com/mambisi/pocopine) app — reactive Rust
compiled to WebAssembly. A **component** is a `#[component]` struct paired with a
same-named `.poco` template (`Counter` ⇄ `src/Counter.poco`).

## Commands

This project uses [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as the task runner —
run `just` to list recipes. The common ones:

| Recipe        | What it does                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `just dev`    | build + serve with live reload (everyday loop)|
| `just build`  | release build — wasm bundle + Pine Stylekit CSS|
| `just serve`  | serve the built app                           |
| `just check`  | `cargo check` (no wasm build)                 |
| `just clippy` | clippy + project architecture warnings         |
| `just fmt`    | `cargo fmt`                                   |
| `just doctor` | check the local toolchain + project config    |
| `just setup`  | one-time: add the wasm target + wasm-pack     |
| `just skills` | refresh the agent guides in `.claude/skills/` |

(All wrap the `pocopine` CLI; you can call it directly too — `pocopine dev`.)

## Conventions

- **Register** every component in `main()` via `App::new().register::<T>()`.
- `#[prop]` fields are seeded from host-element attributes
  (`<counter label="clicks">`); `#[model]`/state fields are reactive.
- `#[handlers]` methods fire from `@event` / `pp-on:` bindings.
- A `.poco` template needs a **single root element** (RFC-045).
- Interpolate with `{{ expr }}` (RFC-040) or `pp-text="expr"`; `<slot>` projects
  child content.
- Styling is **Pine Stylekit** (RFC-092): utility classes (`flex`, `p-4`,
  `bg-card`, `rounded-lg`, `hover:bg-ink-10`) backed by `@theme` tokens in
  `app.css`, compiled to `pkg/stylekit.css`.
- The `pp-init` / `pp-cloak` / `pp-data` directives were **removed** (RFC-063) —
  don't reach for them.
- Target-specific code should be isolated behind cfg-gated modules. Do not add
  `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` to every function/import/block in a shared
  module; split normal files such as `mod.rs`, `client.rs`, `host.rs`, and
  `shared.rs`, then call through that boundary. Do not use `#[path = "..."]`
  aliases to hide the split. Do not add empty host functions for browser-only
  behavior; if the host only returns a default/no-op so code compiles, the
  ownership boundary is wrong. `just lint-structure` runs the ast-grep guard.
- As the app grows, use the structure in `docs/structure.md`: `src/app/` for
  wasm UI/runtime, `src/server/` for host code, `src/storage/` and `src/sync/`
  for client/host/shared boundaries, `src/app/store/` for shared browser state,
  and `src/app/store/local/` for simple browser persistence.

## Shaping a real app (beyond the demo)

The `Counter` / `WelcomeApp` files are a throwaway demo — delete them once you
start. For anything past a toy (e.g. an app built from a design), structure the
code around clear ownership rather than one growing root module:

- **Stores own shared domain state only.** Read store fields in templates as
  `$store.<name>.<field>`; mutate from component handlers via
  `pocopine::store::<MyStore>().update(|s| s.action(...))`. Keep derived/display
  state as plain fields recomputed by a `rebuild()` the store calls at the end of
  each action, or as `#[computed]` fields. → skill: `reactivity-and-stores`.
- **Component-local state first.** Popovers, hover/reveal state, toolbar modes,
  input/editor text, local dialogs, lightboxes, timers, canvas animation handles,
  and one-component async loading/error state belong on the component that owns
  the UI.
- **Components are layout or leaf.** Layout/shell components compose children and
  read stores; leaf components are presentational — a `#[prop]` struct passed
  with `pp-bind:prop="value"` and/or store reads, plus thin handlers that forward
  to the owner. → skills: `pocopine-components`, `slots-and-composition`.
- **`#[component(display = "contents")]`** makes a component's inner root govern
  the parent's flex/grid layout — use it for any component that's a layout child.
- **`uses` is mandatory** for child custom tags: list every `<my-child>` /
  `<pine-icon>` / `<pine-splitter-*>` a template renders in
  `#[component(uses = [..])]`, or the macro errors.
- Organize by area: `src/model.rs`, `src/app/store/`, and
  `src/app/components/<area>/<Name>.{poco,rs}`; register components in the app
  entrypoint.

## Basic Skill: Structure And Refactoring

Use this checklist before moving code or adding target-specific behavior:

1. Classify the code: shared contract, wasm app implementation, host server
   implementation, storage/sync boundary, or utility.
2. Move browser-owned code under `src/app/`; move host-owned code under
   `src/server/`; keep only serializable contracts at the crate root.
3. Split features that cross runtimes into `mod.rs`, `client.rs`, `host.rs`, and
   `shared.rs` instead of adding cfgs to functions.
4. Reject empty host/wasm shims and `#[path = "..."]` aliases; fix the module
   ownership instead.
5. Keep component-only state local. Use a store only when multiple independent
   areas read or mutate the same domain state.
