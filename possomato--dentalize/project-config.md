# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Dentalize is a task management web application tailored for small dental practices. Built with Next.js 15, it features user authentication, a 7-day calendar interface, and management for Services, Clients, and Tasks. The entire UI is in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM (easily migrated to PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 with credentials provider
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components + Tailwind CSS
- **Date handling**: date-fns with pt-BR locale
- **Validation**: Zod schemas

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Database operations
export $(cat .env.local | xargs) && npx prisma studio  # Open Prisma Studio
export $(cat .env.local | xargs) && npx prisma migrate dev  # Create migration
export $(cat .env.local | xargs) && npx prisma generate  # Generate Prisma client
```

Note: SQLite requires environment variables to be loaded. Prefix Prisma commands with `export $(cat .env.local | xargs) &&`.

## Architecture Overview

### Data Model

Three core entities with relationships:

- **User**: Authentication and task ownership
- **Client**: Dental practice patients (optional relationship to tasks)
- **Service**: Procedures with duration, price, and color coding (optional relationship to tasks)
- **Task**: Scheduled appointments/events with startTime, endTime, status, and optional client/service

Task statuses: SCHEDULED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED

```

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Server Actions**: All data mutations use Next.js Server Actions instead of API routes. This provides type-safe mutations with automatic revalidation.

2. **Protected Routes**: Middleware checks authentication for `/dashboard/*`, `/clientes/*`, `/servicos/*`, and `/tarefas/*` routes. Redirects to `/login` if unauthenticated.

3. **Route Groups**: `(auth)` and `dashboard` group routes with shared layouts without affecting URL structure.

4. **Prisma Singleton**: `lib/prisma.ts` ensures a single Prisma client instance in development to avoid connection exhaustion.

5. **Optimistic UI**: Dashboard pages fetch data client-side for interactivity, then revalidate after mutations using `revalidatePath()`.

## Calendar Implementation

### 7-Day Week View Logic

- **Week Start**: Sunday (Brazilian standard) calculated via `startOfWeek(date, { weekStartsOn: 0 })`
- **Business Hours**: 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM (12 hours)
- **Time Slots**: 30-minute intervals (24 slots per day)
- **Task Positioning**: Tasks are absolutely positioned within their time slot based on `startTime`, with height calculated from duration (`endTime - startTime`)
- **Color Coding**: Tasks inherit color from associated Service, or default to blue
- **Interactions**:
  - Click empty slot → Opens TaskForm with pre-filled date/time
  - Click task → Opens TaskForm in edit mode
  - Week navigation → Refetches tasks for new date range

### Week Calculation Flow

1. Get current date
2. Calculate `startOfWeek` (Sunday)
3. Generate array of 7 days: `[Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday]`
4. Fetch tasks where `startTime >= weekStart && startTime <= weekEnd`
5. Render grid: 7 columns (days) × 24 rows (30-min slots)

## Authentication Flow

1. **Register**: User submits form → `registerUser` action hashes password with bcrypt → Creates user in DB → Redirects to login
2. **Login**: User submits credentials → NextAuth validates via Credentials provider → Compares hashed password → Creates JWT session → Redirects to `/dashboard`
3. **Logout**: User clicks logout → `logoutUser` action → Session cleared → Redirects to `/login`
4. **Session Management**: Middleware checks `req.auth` on protected routes

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Server Action

1. Create action in `actions/` directory
