# What this project is

Hawk is an open-source platform for running AI agent evaluations. This monorepo contains the application code and infrastructure-as-code for deploying Hawk on AWS with Pulumi.

# Guidelines

Use modern best practices for Python, Pulumi, AWS, linting, and type checking. Use the latest stable modules and APIs.

Commit and push often. Multiple people are working on this and need to stay in sync.

# Legacy code

We are porting over some old code and infra. Most of the Vivaria and MP4 stuff is deprecated — avoid investing in it.

# Secrets

- Application secrets go in AWS Secrets Manager.
- Deploy-time secrets go in GitHub Actions secrets.
- No secrets in SSM Parameter Store (consolidate to Secrets Manager).
- No secrets in .env files checked into repos.

# Observability

- Use Datadog for metrics, logs, and dashboards (optional — can be disabled).
- Use Sentry for error monitoring.
- Use distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry or X-Ray, whichever fits the service).
- When possible, also emit CloudWatch metrics so you have AWS-native visibility.

# Dev environments

Each developer gets isolated dev environments that share the staging stack's VPC, ALB, and EKS cluster but have their own Aurora PostgreSQL databases and Hawk deployment.

- **Create and deploy:** Run `scripts/dev/new-dev-env.sh <name>` (e.g., `./scripts/dev/new-dev-env.sh alice`). This creates a Pulumi stack named `dev-<name>`, configures it, and prompts to deploy. Requires an existing `stg` stack in the Pulumi backend to clone config from.
- **Bring up an existing env:** `pulumi stack select dev-<name> && pulumi up`
- **Updating a stack with no local config:** If you're asked to update a Pulumi stack and its `Pulumi.<stack>.yaml` doesn't exist yet, run `scripts/dev/new-dev-env.sh <name>` first to create it. The script is idempotent, so it's safe to re-run on an existing env — it will create the stack config if missing and leave existing config in place. Dev stacks inherit org-specific config (OIDC, domain, etc.) from the `stg` stack, so the local config only needs a few values (see #409).
- **Tear down:** `pulumi destroy --yes` — always wait for this to complete fully before running `pulumi stack rm`. If destroy fails partway, fix the errors and re-run it. Never `stack rm` before destroy completes, or you'll orphan AWS resources that require manual cleanup.

# Pulumi

State is stored in S3, not Pulumi Cloud. **Always run `pulumi login` before any Pulumi command** — `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` is not used here.
We use S3 + KMS for state storage. Not passphrases.

```bash
# Login (required before any pulumi command — run once per shell session)
# &profile= is optional; omit it if AWS_PROFILE is set.
pulumi login "s3://<your-pulumi-state-bucket>?region=<region>&awssdk=v2&profile=<aws-profile>"

# Then deploy normally
AWS_PROFILE=<aws-profile> pulumi up -s <stack>
```

The `scripts/dev/new-dev-env.sh` script handles login automatically. For manual operations, run the login command first.

See `Pulumi.example.yaml` for the full set of configuration options.

All infrastructure is defined in Python using Pulumi (in `infra/`).

When deploying, if the state is locked, DO NOT UNLOCK IT without manual confirmation!

# Hawk CLI authentication

In headless environments (containers, devcontainers, SSH sessions), the default PKCE login flow won't work because it needs a localhost callback. Use `--device` to force the device code flow instead:

```bash
hawk login --device
```

This prints a URL and a user code. The user opens the URL in any browser to complete authentication. **The command must run to completion** (do not background it or let it time out) — the token is stored in the system keyring only after the flow finishes.

# Organization-specific configuration

If you're deploying Hawk for your organization, create an `AGENTS.local.md` file (gitignored) with your org-specific values: AWS account IDs, Pulumi state bucket, domains, OIDC provider details, etc. See `AGENTS.local.example.md` for a template.

# Subproject docs

Each subproject has its own `CLAUDE.md` with detailed development instructions:

- `hawk/CLAUDE.md` — Hawk platform: API, CLI, runner, testing, infrastructure

# Smoke tests

See `hawk/tests/smoke/README.md`. Quick start: `scripts/dev/smoke`

# CI/CD

- Use GitHub Actions for all CI/CD.
- Environments: dev, stg, prd.
- Pulumi plans should be reviewable in GitHub PR comments.

# Lock files

You can update all uv.lock files with scripts/dev/uv-lock-all.sh
