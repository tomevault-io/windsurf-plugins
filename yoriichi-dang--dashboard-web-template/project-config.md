# Skill Selection Guide (Chain of Thought)

Use a skill **only when** the current feature, coding task, or explicit user/design mention requires it. Do not invoke skills by default.

**Scope:** All skills are under `.cursor/skills/`. Paths are relative to the project root.

---

## When to use a skill (important)

Use a skill **only when one of the following is true**:

1. **The current case/task matches** — The work you are doing (e.g. writing a component, setting up TanStack Query, styling with Tailwind) clearly falls under the “Use when” of that skill. Do not load a skill “just in case”; only when the task actually needs it.

2. **The user explicitly mentions or requests it** — The user names a technology (e.g. “use Zustand”, “follow TanStack Query best practices”), asks to apply a pattern (e.g. “compound components”), or asks for a review (e.g. “check accessibility”). Then use the corresponding skill.

**Do not:** Load skills by default, or load multiple skills “to cover everything.” Pick at most the one skill that fits the current case or the user’s mention.
