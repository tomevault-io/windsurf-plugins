# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository layout

Quiro is a Turborepo + npm-workspaces monorepo (Node >= 22):

- `apps/desktop` (`@quiro/desktop`) — the product: an Electron screen recorder/editor (React 19, TypeScript, Vite, PixiJS, FFmpeg). Almost all work happens here.
- `apps/web` (`@quiro/web`) — Next.js marketing/download site.
- `packages/shared` (`@quiro/shared`) — shared types (GitHub release types, platform detection).

React 19 is pinned via root `overrides`; the desktop app's `@types/react` are still v18 — don't "fix" that mismatch casually, hoisting is deliberate.

Note: the root `README.md` predates the monorepo move and still shows paths like `electron/`, `src/` — those now live under `apps/desktop/`.

## Commands

Root (turbo wrappers): `npm run dev:desktop`, `build:desktop`, `typecheck`, `test`, `lint`.

Inside `apps/desktop` (preferred for iteration):

```bash
npm run dev            # Vite + Electron dev app
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
npm run test:unit      # all Vitest unit tests
npx vitest run src/components/editor/videoPlayback/videoEventHandlers.test.ts   # single test file
npm run test:feature   # Playwright Electron tests (runs build:app first; slow)
npm run lint           # eslint, --max-warnings 0
npm run build:app      # typecheck + vite build, no packaging
npm run build          # full packaged build (electron-builder → release/<version>/)
```

Unit tests are colocated `*.test.ts` next to sources. Feature tests live in `apps/desktop/tests/feature/` and generate fixtures under `tests/fixtures/generated/`.

Native Windows helpers (cursor monitor, WGC capture, GPU export, whisper runtime) have prebuilt binaries **committed** at `electron/native/bin/win32-x64/`. Only rebuild them (`npm run build:platform-native-helpers`, needs VS2022 + CMake) if you changed their C++ sources; otherwise leave the binaries alone.

## Architecture

### Process split

- `electron/` — main process. IPC handlers live in `electron/ipc/` and are registered via `electron/ipc/register/*`; `electron/ipc/handlers.ts` is the hub. Media files are served to the renderer over local HTTP servers (`electron/utils/mediaServer.ts`, `electron/renderer-server.ts`), not `file://`.
- `electron/preload.ts` exposes the API as `window.electronAPI`. Its type lives in **two places that must stay in sync**: `electron/electron-env.d.ts` and `src/types/electron-env.d.ts`. Adding an IPC channel means touching: handler, register file, preload, both d.ts files.
- `src/` — renderer. Two windows: launch/HUD (`src/components/launch/`) and the editor (`src/components/editor/`).

### The editor (where most complexity lives)

`src/components/editor/window.tsx` (~7k lines, `EditorWindow`) owns nearly all editor state — regions (zoom/trim/clip/speed/audio/annotation), settings, project persistence — and passes it down to:

- `playback.tsx` (`VideoPlayback`) — PixiJS preview: WebGL app, video texture, zoom/camera springs, cursor overlay, motion-blur filters. Per-frame work happens in the Pixi ticker, not React.
- `timeline/TimelineEditor.tsx` — dnd-timeline based timeline.
- `SettingsPanel.tsx` — right-hand settings.

Playback time flows through `videoPlayback/videoEventHandlers.ts`: `requestVideoFrameCallback` drives time updates and applies trim-skips and speed regions there.

Export is a **separate** pipeline from preview: `src/lib/exporter/` (frame renderers, MP4/GIF, audio muxing) plus FFmpeg/native paths via IPC.

Other subsystems: extensions host (`src/lib/extensions/` + `electron/extensions/` marketplace), captions (whisper.cpp runtime; model auto-downloaded from Hugging Face per `electron/utils/constants.ts` to `<userData>/whisper/`).

### Performance-critical render architecture — do not break

The editor had severe playback stutter caused by React re-rendering the whole `EditorWindow` tree (~30ms+ render, ~100ms with effects/layout) on high-frequency updates. The current design that fixed it:

1. **`src/lib/playbackTimeStore.ts` is the live time channel.** During playback the React `currentTime` state in window.tsx is **frozen** — `handlePlaybackTimeUpdate` writes only to the store; state is flushed on pause/seek. Never reintroduce per-frame (or even throttled) `setCurrentTime` while playing.
2. Per-frame consumers subscribe to the store individually (`useSyncExternalStore`): the timeline playhead, `LiveTimecode` (header clock), and `VideoPlayback` itself (`effectiveCurrentTime` = live store value, falling back to the prop when paused — drives captions, bg/webcam drift sync, annotations). Audio drift correction in window.tsx ticks on a 250ms interval while playing, since it gets no time-driven re-runs.
3. Anything reading "the playhead position" inside an interaction handler must read the store at call time (see `getPlayheadMs()` in TimelineEditor), because React time props are stale during playback.
