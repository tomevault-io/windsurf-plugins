# XenolithGraph

Open-source embeddable node-graph editor for the web with **a polished, opinionated node-editor design system as first-class** — not a theme layered on top of a generic flowchart library. The default theme is **Xen**, an original dark/gold design language defined in Figma.

Working name: **XenolithGraph** (subject to change before v0.1).

## 🚨 TDD IS MANDATORY — NOT OPTIONAL

**Every feature in this repo is written test-first. No exceptions.**

The cycle is **red → green → refactor**:

1. Write a failing Vitest (unit) or Playwright (interaction) test that describes the behaviour you want. Run it. **It must fail for the right reason.**
2. Write the minimum implementation to make the test pass. Run the full test suite. **All tests must be green.**
3. Refactor with the test suite as a safety net. Tests stay green throughout.

Concrete rules:

- **No production code without a failing test first.** If you find yourself writing implementation before a test exists, stop and write the test.
- **Commit message convention:** test-only commits use `test:` prefix; the implementation commit that makes them pass uses `feat:` / `fix:`. The two are usually separate commits so the red→green transition is visible in history.
- **Public API change ⇒ Vitest test.** No exceptions.
- **Interaction change ⇒ Playwright test.** Drag, pan, zoom, pin connect, keyboard — all covered.
- **Visual change ⇒ renderer snapshot test.** PIXI render → PNG → image-diff against committed baseline.
- **Bug fix ⇒ regression test first.** Reproduce the bug as a failing test, then fix.
- **Refactor with zero test changes is the cleanest signal everything is fine.** If a refactor forces a test rewrite, the test was probably coupled to implementation, not behaviour — flag it in the PR.

CI is configured to reject PRs where coverage drops or where any test was skipped/disabled without an issue link.

When Claude works in this repo: **read this section before writing any code in `packages/` or `apps/`.** If a task seems to require implementation without a test, push back and ask. This is the single most important rule in the project.

## Why this exists

The web node-graph space in 2026 is split between two camps:

- **Generic flowchart libraries** (xyflow / React Flow ~36k★, Rete.js ~12k★, Drawflow ~6k★) — framework or framework-agnostic, but visually neutral. Every LLM-workflow tool (LangFlow, Flowise, Dify) looks identical because they all sit on React Flow.
- **One semi-Blueprint library** — LiteGraph.js (~8k★, the engine behind ComfyUI). Declares "UDK Blueprint-like" but the aesthetic is mid-2010s, Canvas2D-only, no TypeScript, single maintainer, no framework adapters.

There is **no open-source library that ships a finished, distinctive node-editor design language out of the box** while being modern (TypeScript, ESM, WebGL, framework-agnostic, plugin-based). XenolithGraph aims to fill that gap with the Xen design system.

Primary target users: AI/LLM workflow builders, audio/DSP graph editors, shader/material editors, gameplay-logic editors, anyone who wants a node UI that looks like a tool rather than a diagram.

## Non-goals

- Not a generic flowchart library. Blueprint semantics (typed pins, exec vs data, type-color system, K2-style search palette) are first-class, not opt-in.
- Not a runtime. The library renders and edits graphs; executing them is a separate concern handled by the host application.
- Not coupled to any external engine, file format, or product. The Xen design system is original; references to blueprint-style editors are influence, not reproduction.
- Not React-only. React/Vue/Svelte get adapters; the core is framework-agnostic.

## Architecture (planned)

Layered, headless-first:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Framework adapters (React / Vue / Svelte / vanilla)          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Editor — composes Renderer + Interaction + Commands + Plugins│
├─────────────────────┬────────────────────┬───────────────────┤
│ Renderer (PIXI v8)  │ Interaction        │ Plugin host       │
├─────────────────────┴────────────────────┴───────────────────┤
│ Core (headless: model · types · commands · events · zero-dep)│
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The strict rule: a layer may know about layers below it, never above. The core has zero runtime dependencies and zero references to DOM, Canvas, or PIXI.

### Planned packages (pnpm monorepo)

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `@xenolithengine/graph-core` | Headless graph model, type system, command bus, events. Zero deps. |
| `@xenolithengine/graph-render-pixi` | PIXI v8 renderer. PIXI is a peer dependency. |
| `@xenolithengine/graph-editor` | Wires core + renderer + interaction + plugins into a usable editor. |
| `@xenolithengine/graph-react`, `@xenolithengine/graph-svelte`, `@xenolithengine/graph-vue` | Thin adapters. |
