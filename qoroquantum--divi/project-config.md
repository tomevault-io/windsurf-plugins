# AGENTS.md

## Project overview

- Divi is a Python library for generating and executing quantum programs at scale.
- Core source lives in `divi/`, tests in `tests/`, docs in `docs/`.
- Tutorials are in `tutorials/`; UI/demo tooling is in `visualizations/`.

## Dev environment

- Python: `>=3.11,<3.13` (see `pyproject.toml`).
- Always use the virtual environment in `.venv/` or `venv/` when running commands.
- If neither exists, do not run any Python code until the human specifies which Python executable to use.
- uv is the primary workflow:
  - Install: `uv sync`

## Code style and formatting

- Use `black` and `isort` for formatting; `isort` must use the Black profile; `autoflake` is used to remove unused imports.
- Recommended checks:
  - `uv run black .`
  - `uv run isort .` (uses Black profile, see `pyproject.toml`)
  - `pre-commit run -a`
- New/updated `.py` files (outside `docs/`) should include the license header from `LICENSES/.license-header` (pre-commit enforces this).
- Hook configuration lives in `/.pre-commit-config.yaml`; keep any new files compatible with these hooks.
- If the human is asking an inquisitive or brainstorm-style question, do not change code; respond with analysis or ideas only.

## Testing

- Run full suite: `uv run pytest -n auto`
- Coverage: `uv run pytest -n auto --cov=divi`
- Write spec-driven tests first (behavior-focused) before adding critical low-level mocking.
- Use pytest ecosystem tools (e.g., `pytest-mock`) only; avoid `unittest` unless no alternative exists and the human agrees.
- Markers:
  - `requires_api_key` for cloud API tests (do not run these as an agent unless explicitly asked)
  - `algo` for algorithm tests
  - `e2e` for slow integration tests (avoid during development; run only when explicitly requested)
- API tests require a Qoro API key:
  - `QORO_API_KEY=... uv run pytest -n auto --run-api-tests`
  - or `uv run pytest -n auto --run-api-tests --api-key your-key-here`
- Never inline imports nor classes in test functions. If you are facing errors due to circular imports, ask for approval before inlining imports to fix it.
- Do not leave meta comments in source or tests that explain where other code moved (e.g. "tests live in …", "keep one smoke here"). Relocations should be obvious from module layout and test names; use docstrings only when they document behaviour under test.
- Use simulator fixtures from `tests/conftest.py`: `dummy_simulator` when a real backend is not needed (returns fake counts), `default_test_simulator` for actual circuit execution (QASM→shots), `dummy_expval_backend` for expval-mode tests. Do not create new `QiskitSimulator` instances in tests.
- **Test layout mirrors `divi/`** — one `test_<module>.py` per source module (see `docs/source/development/testing.rst`).
- **Shared test infrastructure** (do not mix roles):
  - `conftest.py` — pytest **fixtures** and hooks only (`@pytest.fixture`, `pytest_addoption`). Auto-discovered; never import from conftest in test code.
  - `_helpers.py` — **explicit-import** builders, assertion helpers, constants, and shared test doubles (e.g. `DummySpecStage`, backend spies). Use `from tests.<pkg>._helpers import …`.
  - `_contracts.py` — shared **`verify_*`** behavioural checks imported across multiple `test_*.py` files in the same package. Use a descriptive name such as `_circuit_runner_contracts.py` when the scope is narrower than the whole package.
  - Fixtures used by a **single** test file may stay in that file; promote to `conftest.py` when reused within the package or subtree.

## Documentation

- **Always use the Makefile** in `docs/` for documentation tasks; do not invoke `sphinx-build` or other Sphinx commands directly.
- From the repo root: `cd docs` then run the desired target (e.g. `make build`, `make dev`).
- Install doc deps: `make install` (from `docs/`) or `uv sync --group docs`
- Build: `cd docs` then `make build`
- Live reload: `cd docs` then `make dev`
- Serve built docs: `cd docs` then `make serve`
- Always `make clean` before `make build` — stale generated stubs and build state can hide or spuriously produce warnings.
- Nitpick mode is always on (`nitpicky = True` in `conf.py`). No need to pass `-n`.

### API reference pages

API pages use `sphinx-automodapi` — one `.. automodapi::` directive per submodule, not hand-rolled `autoclass`/`autofunction` blocks. Every submodule that automodapi documents must have an `__all__` list controlling which names are public (otherwise stdlib imports leak into the generated stubs).

### Cross-reference conventions (avoid nitpick warnings)

- **Use the submodule path, not the top-level re-export.** Write `:class:\`~divi.qprog.algorithms.VQE\`` (resolves), not `:class:\`~divi.qprog.VQE\`` (doesn't). The `~` prefix still renders just `VQE` in the output.
- **Don't put types in `Attributes:` / `Args:` docstring sections.** `sphinx-autodoc-typehints` reads types from the Python signature; duplicating them in the docstring causes Napoleon to emit unresolvable cross-references. Write `cost_history: Optimization cost history.` not `cost_history (list[dict]): ...`.
