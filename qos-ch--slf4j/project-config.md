# Agent Rules

**Never commit or push changes.**

### Strict Rules:

- Do not run `git commit`, `git push`, `git add`, or any git command
  that modifies the repository history.

- You may edit files multiple times in one session.

- You may run tests, build commands, invoke linters to validate
  changes or check your work as needed.

- If you believe a commit or any other git action is needed, ask me
  first.

- The code is widely used. Thus, any changes must preserve backward
  compatibility, especially changes in interfaces or super classes.

Follow these rules at all times.
