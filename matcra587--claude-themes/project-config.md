# claude-themes

Marketplace of Claude Code theme plugins: `plugins/<family>/themes/*.json`
validated against `schemas/theme.schema.json`.

## Commands

- Validate: `uv run scripts/schema-validation.py --changed <file>` (or `--all`)
- Install locally: `uv run scripts/themes.py install <family>` (symlinks into
  `~/.claude/themes`; `list` / `uninstall` too)

## Key facts

- Tokens absent from `overrides` fall through to the `base` preset. Override
  only what differs — never copy a full preset.
- Unknown/misspelled tokens are silently ignored at runtime; validation is the
  only thing that catches them.
- Prefer `uv run` over bare python, `jq` over `python -m json.tool`.
