# AGENTS.md

Read `CLAUDE.md` in full first — it is the authoritative source for coding principles, commands, constraints, layering, and branch/PR/issue workflow. This file only captures high-signal facts an agent would otherwise get *wrong* that aren't obvious from filenames or `CLAUDE.md`.

- Single package: `go test ./internal/store/...`. Single test: `go test ./internal/store -run TestName`.
- Before claiming work is done, run the full CI sequence: `gofmt -l .` (it must print nothing), `go vet ./...`, `make test`, then `make cross`. `make test` and `make cross` alone do not catch formatting or vet failures.
- For unit tests of code that depends on `runtime.Runtime`, use `internal/runtime.FakeRuntime` from `internal/runtime/fake.go`. Real Docker is reserved for Docker integration and e2e tests, which must skip cleanly when Docker is unavailable.
- Runtime environment configuration belongs in `internal/config`; production packages must not call `os.Getenv` inline.
- `TestEndToEndDeploy` failing with "no response through Caddy" is usually **not** a code bug: any other Caddy holding `:80`/`:2019` serves the request from its own empty route table, and Caddy's `SO_REUSEPORT` lets piperd's embedded instance bind alongside it with no error. Run `lsof -nP -iTCP:80 -iTCP:2019 -sTCP:LISTEN` and kill any stray `caddy`/`piperd` first.
- The layering rule is enforced by `test/arch`. Adding an `internal/` package means giving it a rank there; if a change needs that map edited to pass, check whether the new import is the actual mistake.
