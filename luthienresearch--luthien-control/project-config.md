# Configuration and Secrets Management

1.  **Environment Variables:** ALL configuration values that differ between environments (development, testing, production) or are sensitive MUST be loaded from environment variables. This includes:
    *   Backend API endpoints (e.g., OpenAI URL)
    *   Backend API keys
    *   Proxy authentication keys/tokens
    *   Database connection details (host, port, user, password, database name)
    *   Any other external service credentials or configurations.

2.  **`.env` File:**
    *   Use a `.env` file in the project root for *development* environment variables.
    *   This file MUST NOT be committed to Git.
    *   Ensure `.env` is listed in the `.gitignore` file.

3.  **No Hardcoding:** Absolutely NO secrets, API keys, or environment-specific configurations should be hardcoded directly into the source code.
