# AI Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

This rule outlines the strict Test-Driven Development process to be followed by the AI assistant when implementing new features or fixing bugs. This complements the broader `development_workflow` by providing specific TDD execution steps for the AI.

## Core TDD Cycle (AI Execution Steps)

1.  **Step 1: Understand Requirements & Plan**
    *   Clarify the task, inputs, outputs, and expected behavior.
    *   Briefly outline the classes/functions/modules to be created or modified.

2.  **Step 2: Create Minimal Skeleton (No Logic)**
    *   Create the necessary new files (e.g., `example_module.py`, `test_example_module.py`).
    *   Define class structures and function/method signatures.
    *   **Crucially, implement NO functional logic at this stage.** Use `pass`, `return NotImplemented`, or raise `NotImplementedError` in method bodies.
    *   Example:
        ```python
        # In my_module.py
        class MyService:
            def __init__(self):
                pass

            def perform_action(self, data: str) -> bool:
                raise NotImplementedError("Logic not yet implemented.")
        ```

3.  **Step 3: Write Unit Test(s) (Red Phase Target)**
    *   In the corresponding test file (e.g., `test_example_module.py`), write one or more unit tests that define the expected behavior of the code outlined in Step 2.
    *   Cover success cases, failure cases, edge cases, and invalid inputs.
    *   These tests should target the *intended functionality* of the skeleton code.

4.  **Step 4: Run Tests - EXPECT FAILURES (Red Phase Verification)**
    *   Execute the unit tests (e.g., `poetry run pytest path/to/test_file.py | cat`).
    *   **The tests MUST fail at this point.** This is critical:
        *   It verifies that the tests are correctly set up and are testing the intended code.
        *   It ensures that the tests will actually pass due to the new code, not due to an issue with the test itself.
    *   If tests pass unexpectedly, re-evaluate the tests or the minimality of the skeleton.

5.  **Step 5: Implement Functional Code (Green Phase Target)**
    *   Write the *minimum amount of code* in the implementation file (e.g., `example_module.py`) required to make the failing test(s) from Step 4 pass.
    *   Focus solely on fulfilling the requirements defined by the current failing test(s).

6.  **Step 6: Run Tests - VERIFY PASS (Green Phase Verification)**
    *   Execute the unit tests again.
    *   All tests written for the current piece of functionality should now pass.
    *   If tests still fail, debug and modify the functional code (Step 5) until they pass.

7.  **Step 7: Refactor (Optional but Recommended)**
    *   With passing tests as a safety net, refactor both the implementation code and the test code for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.
    *   Ensure that tests continue to pass after refactoring.

8.  **Repeat for Additional Functionality**
    *   If the feature requires more functionality, return to Step 3 (or Step 2 if new skeletons are needed) to write the next test for the next piece of behavior, and repeat the cycle.

## Adherence
Failure to follow these steps, particularly skipping the "Red" phase (Step 4) by writing implementation logic before test failure confirmation, is a deviation from the required TDD practice.
