# Test Writing Guidelines

## Mocking: Use Real Objects First

**Default to real objects.** Only mock when you have:
- External dependencies (network, file I/O, databases)
- Non-deterministic behavior (time, randomness)
- Expensive/slow operations
- Hard-to-reproduce error scenarios
- Not-yet-implemented dependencies
- Interactions where using mocks significantly simplifies testing

**Red flags:** Mock factories for simple objects, complex mock setup taking more lines than test logic.

## Test Failures: Fix Root Cause, Not Symptoms

**NEVER modify application code just to make tests pass without understanding why they're failing.**

Before changing application code:
1. **Verify test intent** - Is the test correct and testing the right thing?
2. **Analyze the failure** - Is it a real bug or test issue?
3. **Consider scope** - Don't modify base classes to fix one subclass's test
4. **Prefer specific fixes** - Change the most specific scope possible
5. **Justify base class changes** - Only if there's a demonstrable flaw affecting all users

Tests validate requirements. Modifying code solely to pass tests without understanding the root cause hides bugs.


## Unit Test Logging Guidelines

Unit tests should focus on **behavior and outcomes**, not exact message wording.

### ✅ Good: Test logging behavior, not exact text

<goodcode>
```python
# Test that appropriate log level is used
with caplog.at_level(logging.WARNING):
    result = some_function()
    assert len(caplog.records) == 1
    assert caplog.records[0].levelname == "WARNING"

# Test that key information is present (not exact wording)
with caplog.at_level(logging.ERROR):
    result = some_function()
    assert "transaction" in caplog.text.lower()
    assert transaction_id in caplog.text
```
</goodcode>

### ❌ Avoid: Testing exact log message text

<badcode>
```python
# Brittle - breaks when message wording changes
assert "RequestHeadersSpec: No request found in RequestHeadersSpec for transaction" in caplog.text

# Brittle - exact error message matching
assert "Error in OpenAIRequestSpec generating log data: Failed to get headers" in caplog.text

```
</badcode>

### Guidelines

1. **Test log levels** (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) rather than exact messages
2. **Test presence of key data** (IDs, critical values) in logs
3. **Use partial matching** for essential keywords, not full sentences
4. **Focus on behavior**: Was an error logged? Was the right level used?
5. **Avoid exact string matching** for user-facing messages

**Exception:** Only test exact messages when the message format is part of a public API contract, used for parsing by external systems, or required by regulatory/compliance.
