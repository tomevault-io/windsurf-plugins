# Security Best Practices

1.  **Input Validation:**
    *   Treat all external input as untrusted. This includes client HTTP requests, data loaded from configurations, and inputs to policies.
    *   Use Pydantic models rigorously to validate the structure and types of incoming data.
    *   Perform semantic validation where necessary (e.g., checking allowed values, lengths).

2.  **Security Scanning:**
    *   Run `bandit` regularly (e.g., before commits or as part of CI) to identify common security vulnerabilities: `poetry run bandit -r luthien_control/`
    *   Address or explicitly acknowledge (with `# nosec` comments and justification) issues reported by `bandit`.

3.  **Secrets Handling:**
    *   Adhere strictly to the `config_and_secrets.mdc` rule.
    *   Ensure logs do not inadvertently expose sensitive information. Consider redaction mechanisms if necessary.

4.  **Dependency Security:**
    *   Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using tools like `pip-audit` or GitHub's Dependabot in the future.

5.  **HTTPS:** Ensure all communication with external services (backend APIs) uses HTTPS.
