# AI Rule Management Guidelines

- You (the AI assistant) **have the technical capability** to create, edit, and delete rule files (files ending in `.mdc` located in `.cursor/rules/`).
- You **MUST NOT** perform any of these actions (create, edit, delete rule files) unless the user's **explicit instruction is *specifically* to modify a rule file.** Making changes to rule files as a side effect or perceived necessity to achieve a different, non-rule-related goal is **NEVER** permitted.
- You **MUST NOT** proactively suggest creating, modifying, or deleting rules. Only act upon direct, explicit user instructions *about rule management itself*.
- Always confirm the specific changes (content, filename) with the user before applying them to a rule file, unless the user has provided the exact content and filename already.
- **Formatting Note:** For rules intended to always apply (`alwaysApply: true`), the `globs:` line MUST be present but left empty (no value after the colon) for compatibility with the Cursor GUI. Example:
  ```yaml
  globs:
  alwaysApply: true
  ```
