### Project Overview

The project implements a web application designed to run as a **Databricks App**. Databricks Apps are Python web applications configured via an `app.yaml` file (Databricks Asset Bundle format). This app provides Unity Catalog and general Databricks-related services, focusing on metadata management, governance, and operational tools.

**Core Features:**

- **Data Contracts:** Instrument Data Products with technical metadata based on the Open Data Contract Standard. Managed by `DataContractsManager`. Includes schema validation, quality checks, access control verification, sample data display, etc.
    - Data Contracts can be written in any text format, like plain text, YAML, JSON. For structured formats, like JSON, we support also existing standards, such as the BITOL ODCS (source: https://github.com/bitol-io/open-data-contract-standard/blob/main/schema/odcs-json-schema-latest.json)
- **Data Products:** Group Databricks assets (tables, views, functions, models, dashboards, jobs, notebooks) using tags (e.g., `data-product-name`, `data-product-domain`). Managed by `DataProductsManager`.
    - Data Products follow the BITOL ODPS specification (source: https://github.com/bitol-io/open-data-product-standard/blob/main/schema/odps-json-schema-latest.json)
- **Business Glossaries:** Hierarchical glossaries per organizational unit (company, LOB, department, team, project). Merged bottom-up for users, allowing overrides. Terms have tags, markdown descriptions, lifecycle status, assigned assets. Managed by `BusinessGlossariesManager`.
- **Master Data Management (MDM):** Integrates with Zingg.ai for MDM capabilities. Managed by `MasterDataManagementManager`.
- **Entitlements:** Combines access privileges into personas (roles) and assigns them to directory groups. Managed by `EntitlementsManager`.
- **Security:** Enables advanced security features (e.g., differential privacy) on assets. Managed by `SecurityFeaturesManager`.
- **Compliance:** Define and verify compliance rules, calculating an overall score. Managed by `ComplianceManager`.
- **Catalog Commander:** Norton Commander-inspired dual-pane explorer for managing catalog assets (copy/move tables/schemas). Managed by `CatalogCommanderManager`.
- **Data Asset Reviews:** Workflow for reviewing and approving assets (tables, views, functions). Managed by `DataAssetReviewManager`. Includes notifications for reviewers/requesters.
- **Settings:** Configure app settings, Databricks connection, Git integration, background jobs, and RBAC (Roles). Managed by `SettingsManager`.
- **About:** Application summary and links.

**General Usage:**

- Users see **different features** in the UI based on their group memberships. For example, an Admin sees and has read/write access to everything. A Data Producer has read/write access to Data Contracts and Products (among other related things). A Data Consumer has read-only access to the Data Products and Contracts.
- **Creating Data Products** entails these steps:
    - Data Producer and Consumers use the app to design an initial version of a Data Contract in draft status.
    - This contract is refined until both parties agree on the overlapping details, such as the schema(s), data quality checks, etc.
    - The Data Producer enhance the contract with further information, such as owner (likely themselves), access control requirements, business semantics, and so on
    - Eventually they contract is released with a specific version and status
    - Data Producer either subsequently, or asynchronously, build a Data Product that uses the contract for a specific output port of the product
    - Once the Data Product is released with a specific version and status consumers can "purchase" (or "check out"/"subscribe") the product, creating a linkage between contract via the product and the consumer
    - This creates an implicit Compliance check that verifies the contract regularly via a background job
    - If a violation is detected, the owner and subscribers are alerted via the built-in ITSM notification feature
    - App users with the Data Governance role maintain Data Domains and Business Glossaries, which are used to assign specific values to Data Products and Data Contracts
- The **Home Page** differs for each app user role, for instance, for Data Consumers, they find an easy discovery option (like a marketplace) for Data Products to subscribe to. For Data Producers, they find the options to create Data Products or continue working on draft products and contracts.

### General Data Product Details

#### 1. Inception
- **Start with desired business outcomes**
  - Clearly define what the business aims to achieve with the data product.
- **Assign owner**
  - Appoint a responsible product owner for governance and delivery.
- **Assign resources**
  - Allocate the necessary team members and budget.
- **Define business metrics**
  - Set measurable objectives for success.

#### 2. Design
- **Create a data contract**
