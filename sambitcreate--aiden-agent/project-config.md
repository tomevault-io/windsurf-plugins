# Aiden Agent

Aiden Agent is a privately owned Electron application. Its only source repository is `https://github.com/sambitcreate/aiden-agent`.

## Project memory

The `.memory/` folder contains context and history from previous work on this project. Read the relevant files there before making changes, and keep them updated when work changes the implementation, architecture, decisions, or status.

## Plans

The current plan inventory and status live in [`docs/plans/README.md`](docs/plans/README.md). Update that index when a plan's status changes, and move completed plans into its `completed/` archive.

## UI design references

Follow `docs/design-guide.md` for reusable action shapes, semantic tokens, and accessibility. Reuse the shared squircle button treatment for new and existing actions rather than introducing per-screen button geometry.

Before adding or materially restyling any UI element or component, always review both `docs/chatgpt-desktop-ui-inspiration.md` and `docs/chatgpt-ui-element-specimen.html` for interaction, styling, state, motion, and accessibility inspiration. Adapt the references to Aiden's existing visual language rather than copying them blindly, and use the semantic design tokens in `renderer/styles.css` and `renderer/shared/appearance.ts` instead of introducing one-off colors.

Do not put decorative borders or outlines around radio-button choice cards. Communicate selection with the radio control and existing background-state tokens instead. Always preserve visible keyboard `focus-visible` rings or outlines for accessibility.

Keep status colors in soft semantic fills, labels, and icons. Do not add decorative colored borders or outlines to badges, alerts, selection cards, or controls. Non-text keyboard focus uses the neutral focus-ring token.

Text-entry controls must not add an accent border, outline, or ring when focused. Keep their resting border unchanged and communicate focus with the existing input-background and caret states. This rule applies to inputs, textareas, and search-field wrappers, not to non-text keyboard controls that still require a visible `focus-visible` treatment.

Settings must follow [`docs/settings-design-system.md`](docs/settings-design-system.md): use the shared page headings, grouped card surfaces, inset separators, and trailing controls derived from Appearance. Use the SD-card `MemoryCardIcon` for Memory. Never introduce brain icons or brain illustrations anywhere in the app.

## Release model metadata

models.dev may be contacted only by `npm run models:refresh`, the release refresh invoked by `npm run dist`, the scoped post-merge catalog workflow, or the user-initiated foreground **Update model catalogs** action in Settings → Providers. The live action may request only the fixed `https://models.dev/api.json` endpoint without credentials, cookies, prompts, chats, selections, custom endpoints, or a device identifier; its validated device-local cache is display-only and must never change runtime limits, routing, or selectable inventory. Never add a models.dev call to startup, normal development, unpacked builds, ordinary live-app reads, onboarding navigation, or background polling. Artificial Analysis data and credentials must never be bundled: the live Electron app may contact its fixed Free endpoint only after the user explicitly chooses Connect & fetch or Fetch latest with their own key, then reads the normalized device-local cache offline.

OpenRouter benchmark insights are also manual-only. The live app may contact only the fixed `/api/v1/benchmarks?source=artificial-analysis&max_results=100` endpoint after the user explicitly chooses Connect & fetch or Fetch latest, using the dedicated encrypted Model Pad credential rather than any inference-provider credential. Never send prompts or model traffic during that action, never import OpenRouter's model catalog, never bundle the returned data, and serve ordinary model-info reads only from the normalized device-local cache.

## Papercuts

For complex workflows, record concise implementation friction in `.papercuts/troubleshooting.md` as it occurs.

## Tests

When adding a feature or changing behavior, layout, configuration, or contracts, always check whether existing tests need updating and add or extend tests when coverage is missing. Run the relevant suites before finishing (`npm run test`, or the narrower scripts in `package.json` when the change is scoped). If a new test file is added, register it in the appropriate `package.json` test script so CI picks it up.

Changes to shared server contracts or transcript/activity UI must also be checked against both native clients. Inspect iOS and Android consumers, update their implementations and focused tests when behavior is shared, and run the applicable mobile suites even when the originating change is on desktop or server.
