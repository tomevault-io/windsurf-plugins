# Juggler

## Build / Test / Lint / Dev

```bash
make build          # Lint + build Go binaries (bin/juggler, bin/juggler-app, bin/juggler-test)
make test           # All tests (unit + integration + browser); RUN='<name>' runs one
make go-build       # Build Go binaries only (skip linting)
make test-full      # Lint + tests. Run before opening a PR.
make lint           # All linters (Go + JS + CSS) — the only way to lint everything
make fix            # Auto-fix what the linters can (gofmt, eslint/stylelint --fix); then re-lint
make dev            # Build and run server
make build-windows  # Cross-compile bin/windows/*.exe (pure-Go, no cgo)
```

`make build` and `make test` **must** pass before any task is complete.

## Linting

- **`make lint` and `make lint-files` are the only sanctioned ways to lint.**
  Never invoke `golangci-lint`, `go vet`, `gofmt`, `eslint`, or `stylelint`
  directly — every config, flag, ignore pattern, and pinned tool version lives
  in the `Makefile` / `scripts/lint-files`, and a hand-rolled invocation
  silently diverges from what CI enforces.
- To lint specific files (routed by extension to the same linters):
  ```bash
  make lint-files FILES="cmd/juggler/worker/foo.go web/js/bar.js"
  ```
- **Before fixing lint failures by hand, run `make fix`** — it applies every
  auto-fix the linters can (gofmt, `golangci-lint --fix`, `eslint --fix`,
  `stylelint --fix`) using the same configs and globs as `make lint`, then tells
  you to re-lint. It never fixes type errors (lint-types) or dead code
  (lint-deadcode) — those still need a human. `make fix` and `make fix-files`
  are the only sanctioned ways to auto-fix; don't run `gofmt -w`, `eslint --fix`,
  or `stylelint --fix` directly (same drift reason as lint). Per-file:
  ```bash
  make fix-files FILES="cmd/juggler/worker/foo.go web/css/bar.css"
  ```

## Tests

- `make test` runs the whole suite (Go unit + integration + browser) without
  `-v`, so its output already is the summary; it is also teed to `bin/test.log`.
- **To run one specific test, pass `RUN='<regex>'`** — a `go test -run` pattern
  matched against test-function names. It also turns on `-v` so you see that
  test's own output. This is the sanctioned way to iterate on a single test;
  **don't run `node`, the browser harness, or `go test` by hand** — the target
  builds the right binary, sets the flags CI uses, and tees the log for you.
  ```bash
  make test RUN='TestDiffView'            # one test, whichever layer it's in
  make test RUN='TestDiffView/collapsed'  # one subtest
  make test-go RUN='TestWorker'           # restrict to the fast unit layer
  ```
- Browser tests launch `bin/juggler --assets-from-disk`, serving the local
  `web/` tree. Once `bin/juggler` exists, web-only edits don't need a rebuild —
  rerun `make test RUN='<name>'` (Go builds are incremental, so this is cheap).
  Rebuild only for Go / embedded-asset / build-file changes.

## Git commits

- Commit messages: **one line, minimal, past tense**
  (e.g. `Fixed cross-conversation cancel leak`).

## Changelog

- Add entries under `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` as you make user-facing
  changes; release tooling rolls that section into a dated version section when
  a release is cut.
- **Each release is a single flat list of changes** — no `Added`/`Changed`/
  `Fixed` subsection headers.
- **Entries are terse one-liners**: ~12 words, the user-visible headline only.
  Match the length of the existing entries.

## Conventions

- **No mutexes.** Use goroutines + channels. The one sanctioned `sync.Mutex` is
  `ycrdtMu` in `cmd/juggler/worker/document.go` (y-crdt C binding isn't
  goroutine-safe). Any other mutex is a regression.
- **`docs/` is published user-facing docs only.** Assistant plans, notes, and
  scratch go in `scratch/` (git-ignored); promote to `docs/` only when it's for
  users.
- Refer to code locations as `file_path:line_number`.

## Architecture

Two binaries, not one:

- **`cmd/juggler` — the server.** Headless terminal process doing all the work:
  HTTP/WebSocket server, session store, and the hidden engine WebView (backend
  JS — tool execution, prompt building). Strictly windowless in production
  (macOS accessory app, `Mac.ActivationPolicy: Accessory`). Never create a
  visible window in the server's production path.
- **`cmd/juggler-app` — the desktop app** (`bin/Juggler.app`). One long-lived
  process owning many visible windows, each a pure viewer pointed at a server
  over HTTP/WebSocket. Connects to a running server (`--url`) or
  spawns/discovers a local one.

Key invariants:

- **Engine is the single place tools execute**, but the **worker decides when**.
  The worker observes the doc and commands the engine per tool-action
  (`evaluate-tool` / `execute-tool` / `cancel-tool`); the engine has no reactive
  tool reducer. State is pushed ahead of each command on one ordered mailbox.
- **Durable state lives in the Go worker's Yjs doc** (source of truth); the
  engine carries no decision state. When two pieces of Yjs state must co-vary,
  maintain it in a reactive observer, not in click handlers.
- **Window geometry is per-project session state**, stored server-side in the
  session and exposed at `GET/PUT /api/session/window-state`.
