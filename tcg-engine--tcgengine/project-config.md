# TCGEngine — Repo Instructions & Developer Guide

This document provides a concise developer-oriented guide to the repository, with focused guidance for editing Decision Queue and Turn / Next-Turn code paths. Keep this file updated as you change behavior or generator outputs.

## Quick links (files to know)
- `Core/DecisionQueueController.php` — server-side logic that executes static decision-queue entries and invokes custom handlers.
- `Core/UILibraries.js` — client-side rendering pipeline used by the generated UI (PopulateZone, createCardHTML, card injection points).
- `zzGameCodeGenerator.php` — schema parser + code generator that produces server helpers and a `GeneratedUI_*.js` client helper.
- `Schemas/<RootName>/GameSchema.txt` — schema defining zones, overlays, counters and display properties.
- `<RootName>/GeneratedUI_*.js` — generated client helpers (watch for the timestamped filename in the game folder).
- `<RootName>/ZoneAccessors.php`, `ZoneClasses.php`, `GamestateParser.php` — generated server-side gamestate helpers.
- `<RootName>/GetNextTurn.php`, `NextTurnRender.php`, `InitialLayout.php` — important generated files used by runtime.
- `<RootName>/Custom/*` (e.g. `RBSim/Custom/GameLogic.php`) — custom game logic where customDQHandlers are normally registered.

## High-level flow
1. Authoritative schema: `Schemas/<Root>/GameSchema.txt`.
2. Run the generator: `zzGameCodeGenerator.php?rootName=<Root>` (open via your dev host or run via CLI if you have a local PHP webserver). The generator parses the schema and writes the generated PHP files and the client `GeneratedUI_<timestamp>.js` into `./<Root>`.
3. The frontend includes `InitialLayout.php` and the generated `GeneratedUI_*.js`. The `GeneratedUI_*.js` contains `GetZoneData()`, `OverlayRules`, `CounterRules`, and other generated helpers.
4. `Core/UILibraries.js` (client) uses those helpers to render zones (`PopulateZone`) and per-card HTML (`createCardHTML`). We inject counters and overlays at well-known insertion points in `createCardHTML`.

If you change the schema or generator, re-run the generator and hard-refresh the browser so the client receives the updated `GeneratedUI_*.js` (the generator deletes old `GeneratedUI_*.js` files and writes a new timestamped one).

## Decision Queue — server-side (how it works)
- File: `Core/DecisionQueueController.php`.
- Core concept: each player has a `DecisionQueue` zone (parsed from schema). Objects placed into that zone are processed by `DecisionQueueController::ExecuteStaticMethods()` to perform static, immediate actions that do not require interactive input.

Key points:
- `ExecuteStaticMethods($player, $lastDecision)` iterates the player's queue and handles specific decision Types (e.g., `MZMOVE`, `CUSTOM`).
- For `CUSTOM` decisions the code currently does:

  - split the `Param` string on `|` to produce parts
  - `array_shift` the first element to get the handler name
  - call the registered handler with signature: `$customDQHandlers[$handlerName]($player, $parts, $lastDecision)`

  So: the handler receives `$player` (int), `$parts` (an array of the remaining params — reindexed starting at 0), and `$lastDecision` (string|null). This is the canonical place to add short, non-interactive flows.

How to add a custom handler
1. Register handlers in your game's custom logic file (e.g. `RBSim/Custom/GameLogic.php`) near where `$customDQHandlers` is defined. Example:

```php
$customDQHandlers = [];
$customDQHandlers["DealDamage"] = function($player, $params, $lastDecision) {
    // $params is an array of strings (the parts after the handler name)
    // Example usage: $targetZone = $params[0]; $amount = intval($params[1]);
    // Implement small, stateless actions here. Keep them short and idempotent.
};
```

2. When you queue the decision (AddDecision) ensure the `Param` string format matches how the handler expects it: e.g. `DealDamage|myBattlefield-3|2` (handlerName|targetMZ|amount). The generator/renderer may serialize things differently; inspect how decisions are enqueued in your game flow.

Important notes and gotchas
- `ExecuteStaticMethods` will `PopDecision($player)` after executing the recognized static action — make sure handlers do not assume the decision remains in the queue.
- Only use `CUSTOM` static handlers for short immediate changes; interactive decisions should use other decision Types (YESNO, MZCHOOSE, etc.).
- Handlers must be tolerant of malformed parameters (validate array indexes, numeric conversion). Prefer failing silently and logging rather than throwing unhandled exceptions that could kill the loop.

## Turn controller / generator notes
- The generator (`zzGameCodeGenerator.php`) outputs a number of server files and a key client JS file (`GeneratedUI_<timestamp>.js`). Important generator behaviours:
  - It emits `OverlayRules` and `CounterRules` as `const` JS objects in the generated JS. Client code reads these constants for overlays/counters.
  - It emits zone metadata accessible by `GetZoneData(zoneName)` on the client.
