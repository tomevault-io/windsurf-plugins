# Brah

Electron desktop voice assistant that uses the OpenAI Realtime API to listen, view the screen, control the computer (browser + OS), and manage a local planner — all in realtime.

## Layout

- `src/main.js` — Electron main process: window modes, OpenAI OAuth, IPC handlers, screenshots, auto-update.
- `src/preload.js` — context-isolated bridge; exposes the `window.brah` API to the renderer. All renderer↔main communication goes through these `ipcRenderer.invoke` channels.
- `src/os-permissions.js` — macOS/Windows OS permission status + settings deep-links.
- `src/renderer/` — UI: `index.html`, `renderer.js`, `panel.js`, `styles.css`, plus realtime playback/tool-handler glue.
- `src/realtime/prompts.js` — builds the realtime session instructions.
- `src/realtime/tool-permissions.js` — per-tool permission metadata (read/low/write/destructive/network levels).
- `src/realtime/tools/` — tool implementations dispatched by `tools/index.js` (`executeRealtimeTool`): planner, web, screenshot, computer-use, session.
- `test/` — `node --test` suites (one per tool module).

## Architecture notes

- **Tool dispatch:** `executeRealtimeTool(name, args, options)` in `src/realtime/tools/index.js` tries each module's executor in order; each returns a falsy value when it does not own the tool name. New tools must be wired into both `tool-schemas.js` (definition) and a module executor.
- **Storage:** planner + activity persist in SQLite via `node:sqlite` (`brah.db`), not JSON. Schema lives in `src/realtime/tools/database.js`. `database.js` defaults the user-data dir to `os.tmpdir()/brah-user-data` unless `setDatabaseUserDataPath()` is called (main.js sets it to Electron `userData`). Legacy JSON stores are auto-migrated once.
- **Computer use:** browser mode via Playwright (`computer-use-browser.js`), OS mode via `@nut-tree-fork/nut-js` (`computer-use-os.js`); driven through `computer-use-tools.js`.
- **Credentials:** OpenAI auth tokens are encrypted with Electron `safeStorage` (system keychain). OAuth callback uses a local server on port `1455`.
- **Known Realtime OAuth issue:** Brah intentionally uses ChatGPT/Codex OAuth for Realtime; do not suggest API-key fallback as a fix. Status verified 2026-06-06 by decrypting stored creds via Electron `safeStorage` and probing the live endpoints; the failure is now two-stage:
  - **Mint works:** `POST api.openai.com/v1/realtime/client_secrets` returns **200** with a valid `ek_…` for `gpt-realtime-2`/`gpt-realtime`/`gpt-4o-realtime-preview`. (This was the call that 401'd around 2026-06-03/04; that part of the regression has cleared.)
  - **Call fails:** `POST api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls` with that `ek_` returns **500 Internal Server Error** for every model — reproduced in the real app (renderer.js:712, genuine `RTCPeerConnection` offer) and via synthetic SDP. The response still carries a `Location: …/rtc_…` header, so the call object is created and OpenAI 500s while producing the answer SDP. Most likely an OAuth-subscription entitlement gap surfacing late (allowed to mint a session, not allowed to run the call), not a client bug.
  - **Codex's backend realtime route 404s for Brah (verified 2026-06-06):** current `openai/codex` (`codex-rs/codex-api/src/endpoint/realtime_call.rs`) does realtime over OAuth via `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/realtime/calls` (ChatGPT backend, JSON `{sdp,session}` body + sideband WS join by `call_id`), not the public API. This is NOT an identity wall: Brah uses the same OAuth `client_id` as the Codex CLI (`app_EMoamEEZ73f0CkXaXp7hrann`, main.js:70), and Brah's token authenticates to the backend fine — sending Codex's exact headers (`originator: codex_cli_rs`, `chatgpt-account-id`, Codex `User-Agent`) to `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` returns a semantic **400** ("model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account"), proving auth/identity are accepted. But `.../codex/realtime/calls` returns **404 `{"detail":"Not Found"}`** with or without those headers (also tried `openai-alpha: quicksilver=v1`/`=v2` and `OpenAI-Beta: realtime=v1` — still 404). The route simply isn't deployed/enabled for this account. The client code is ahead of the server; reusing Codex's identity does not help.
