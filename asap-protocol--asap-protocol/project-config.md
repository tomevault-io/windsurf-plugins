# Agent Clean Code

The primary reader of this code is an AI agent. Optimize for grep navigation, single tool-call comprehension, and headless test loops.

## SOLID principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module should have one reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation**: Prefer focused interfaces over one general-purpose interface.
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

## Size and structure

- Functions: **5–40 lines**; split if longer.
- Files: under 500 lines; ideal 200–300. Split by responsibility.
- One responsibility per module (SRP).
- Follow framework conventions (Rails, Django, Next.js, etc.) so paths are predictable.
- Prefer small focused modules over god files.
- If logic is used more than twice, extract a reusable component.

## Grep-friendly names

- Names must reveal intent and be distinct in the codebase.
- Avoid generic names: `data`, `process`, `handler`, `Manager`, `Service`, `util`, `helper`.
- Prefer specific names: `UserRegistrationValidator`, `InvoiceLineItemTotal`.
- Target: `rg "<symbol>"` returns fewer than 5 hits; if not, rename or namespace.

## Types

- Explicit types everywhere the language supports them.
- No untyped public APIs (`any`, bare `Dict`, untyped function signatures).
- Typed code gives the agent immediate contracts and reduces inference errors.

## DRY and control flow

- No duplicated logic across files — extract shared functions or modules.
- Named constants instead of magic numbers.
- Early returns and guard clauses; max 2 indentation levels.
- Prefer pattern matching / guard clauses over deep nesting.

## Comments (provenance, not narration)

- Write **WHY** and **provenance**, not WHAT the syntax does.
- Keep agent-written comments on refactor — do not strip them.
- Document non-obvious constraints: upstream bugs, business rules, protocol quirks.
- Reference issue numbers when logic exists because of a specific bug or decision.
- Docstrings on public APIs: intent + one usage example.
- Skip obvious comments (`// increment counter` above `count++`).

## Errors

- Error and exception messages must include the offending value and expected shape.
- Bad: `raise ValueError("invalid input")`
- Good: `raise ValueError(f"invalid input: received {x!r}, expected non-empty string of digits")`

## Test policy

| Situation | Test required? |
|-----------|----------------|
| Bug reported | **Yes** — write a failing regression test first (TDD) |
| New public function in `src/asap/` | **Yes** |
| Refactor without behavior change | No — existing tests must still pass |
| Docs, typos, comments only | No |
| Trivial private helper with coverage via caller | Optional — prefer testing through the public API |

For pytest structure, fixtures, and CI commands, see `testing-standards.mdc` and `.cursor/README.md`.

## Testability

- Inject dependencies through constructor, parameter, or context — not hidden globals.
- Wrap third-party libraries behind a thin project-owned interface when they may be swapped.
- Mock external I/O (API, DB, filesystem) with named fakes, not scattered inline stubs.

## Tests (agent loop)

- Single documented command to run tests (`.cursor/README.md` or `AGENTS.md`).
- Tests must run headless: no manual setup, no secrets, no interactive prompts.
- F.I.R.S.T: fast, independent, repeatable, self-validating, timely.

## Formatting

- Use the project formatter/linter (`prettier`, `black`, `ruff`, `gofmt`, `cargo fmt`, etc.).
- Do not debate brace style or column width — the formatter decides.

## Logging (when applicable)

- Structured JSON for debugging and observability.
- Plain text only for user-facing CLI output.

## Code modification format

When proposing changes:

- Include a `# file: path/to/file.py` (or equivalent) before each code block.
- Provide enough surrounding context for the change to be unambiguous.
- Stick to architecture choices in `pyproject.toml` unless a change is explicitly discussed.
