GitHub Copilot is configured to automatically load all `*.instructions.md` files in that directory.

## Summary of Standards
- **Python**: PEP8 + Black, Sphinx-style docstrings, mandatory type annotations.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage, functional over class-based tests, `make test`.
- **Commits**: 40-character subject line, imperative mood, 72-character body.
