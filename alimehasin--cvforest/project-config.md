# i18n Two-Level Nesting Rule

## Overview

This rule enforces a strict two-level nesting structure for all i18n translation keys across the project. Translation keys must follow the pattern `category.key` and cannot exceed two levels of nesting.

## Rule Details

### ✅ Allowed Patterns

- `product.name` - Two levels: category and key
- `user.email` - Two levels: category and key
- `auth.login` - Two levels: category and key
- `dashboard.title` - Two levels: category and key
- `sidebar.home` - Two levels: category and key

### ❌ Rejected Patterns

- `reservation.statuses.canceled` - Three levels: category, subcategory, and key
- `auth.errors.invalidCredentials` - Three levels: category, subcategory, and key
- `dashboard.metrics.totalReservations` - Three levels: category, subcategory, and key
- `user.profile.settings.theme` - Four levels: too deep nesting

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Key Structure

- **First level**: Represents the main feature/component (e.g., `reservations`, `users`, `auth`)
- **Second level**: Represents the specific property/action (e.g., `name`, `email`, `login`)

### 2. Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for both levels
- First level should be plural for collections (e.g., `reservations`, `users`)
- Second level should be descriptive and specific

### 3. File Organization

- All translation files must follow this structure
- Both `en.json` and `ar.json` files must maintain identical key structures
- Keys should be organized logically by feature/component

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Structure

```json
{
  "reservations": {
    "add": "Add Reservation",
    "edit": "Edit Reservation",
    "delete": "Delete Reservation",
    "status": "Status",
    "pending": "Pending",
    "attended": "Attended",
    "cancelled": "Cancelled"
  },
  "users": {
    "name": "Name",
    "email": "Email",
    "phone": "Phone",
    "add": "Add User",
    "edit": "Edit User"
  },
  "auth": {
    "login": "Login",
    "logout": "Logout",
    "email": "Email",
    "password": "Password"
  }
}
```

### ❌ Incorrect Structure

```json
{
  "reservations": {
    "statuses": {
      "pending": "Pending",
      "attended": "Attended"
    },
    "actions": {
      "add": "Add",
      "edit": "Edit"
    }
  },
  "auth": {
    "errors": {
      "invalidCredentials": "Invalid credentials",
      "sessionExpired": "Session expired"
    }
  }
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Violations

If you encounter existing three-level nesting, refactor as follows:

**Before:**

```json
{
  "qrcode": {
    "notFetched": {
      "title": "Scan QR Code",
      "subtitle": "Enter a reservation ID",
      "description": "Use the search form above"
    }
  }
}
```

**After:**

```json
{
  "qrcode": {
    "notFetchedTitle": "Scan QR Code",
    "notFetchedSubtitle": "Enter a reservation ID",
    "notFetchedDescription": "Use the search form above"
  }
}
```

## Validation

### Automated Checks

- Use JSON schema validation to enforce structure
- Implement pre-commit hooks to validate i18n files
- Add ESLint rules to catch violations in TypeScript/JavaScript files

### Manual Review

- Review all translation files before commits
- Ensure both `en.json` and `ar.json` maintain identical structure
- Verify that refactored keys are updated in all usage locations

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Uniform structure across all translation files
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to locate and update translations
3. **Performance**: Faster key resolution with fewer nesting levels
4. **Developer Experience**: Clearer mental model for translation organization
5. **Tooling**: Better support from i18n tools and IDEs

## Enforcement

This rule should be enforced through:

- Code review processes
- Automated validation scripts
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD pipeline checks

Any violations should be caught and fixed before merging to main branch.
