# TypeScript Best Practices

## Type System

- Prefer interfaces over types for object definitions
- Use type for unions, intersections, and mapped types
- NEVER use `any` or `as any` types or coercion
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Leverage TypeScript's built-in utility types
- Use generics for reusable type patterns
- Use `unknown` for variables that are not yet typed
- Use `Zod` for schema validation
- Use the type guards pattern for runtime type checking
- Use `assertString` for runtime string checking

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for type names and interfaces
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix interfaces for React props with 'Props' (e.g., ButtonProps)

## Code Organization

- Keep type definitions close to where they're used
- Export types and interfaces from dedicated type files when shared
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for organizing exports
- Place shared types in a `types.ts` file
- Co-locate component props with their components
- Prefer to use multiple files.
- Never place two classes or components in the same file.

## Functions

- Use explicit return types for public functions
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and methods
- Use function overloads for complex type scenarios
- Prefer async/await over Promises
- Prefer function declarations over function expressions.
- Prefer functional programming over classes.

## Best Practices

- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Use readonly for immutable properties
- Leverage discriminated unions for type safety
- Implement proper null checking
- When making changes, don't worry about backwards compatibility. For example, don't alias types.

## Imports

- ALWAYS use `@/` style imports vs relative imports, except when importing from the same directory.

## Error Handling

- DO NOT proactively add error handling
