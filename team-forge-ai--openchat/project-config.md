Context:

- Conventions: small files, single-responsibility, testable interfaces, providers+hooks for state, one component per file, '@/' imports, zod for parsing/validation, no any.
- Events: define event name constants; payloads are discriminated unions; normalize snake_case (Rust) → camelCase (TS).
- Rust: offload blocking work with spawn_blocking; emit structured serde-tagged payloads; keep interfaces minimal.
- Quality gates: Propose a plan first; after edits run cargo check, pnpm typecheck, pnpm lint; fix issues; ensure hooks rules respected.

Do this:

1. Propose a concise plan (files to add/edit, public APIs, event names, schemas).
2. After approval, implement:
   - Keep modules small and composable.
   - Add zod schemas for all incoming data; normalize to camelCase once in a bridge layer.
   - Use discriminated unions and type guards; export helper predicates (e.g., isTerminalEvent).
   - Centralize constants (event names, keys) in a types or constants file.
   - In React, create a provider and a small hook for state; avoid conditional hooks.
   - In Rust, use spawn_blocking for blocking ops; include identifiers like repo_id in every event.
3. After coding, run:
   - cargo check
   - pnpm typecheck
   - pnpm lint
     Fix issues immediately.
4. Summarize the changes succinctly and note any follow-up suggestions.

Non-negotiables:

- No any. Use zod for runtime validation.
- Normalize casing at boundaries; TS types are camelCase.
- Small, testable modules; clear public APIs.
- Don’t call hooks conditionally.
- Prefer to split out logic into smaller files.
- Never use `any` or `as any` in Typescript.
- Never use single character variable names.
- Always write documentation for all public APIs.
- Always run build/typecheck/lint before declaring done.
