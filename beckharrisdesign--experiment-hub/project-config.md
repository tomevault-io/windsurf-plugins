# PRD template

Keep PRDs lean and decision-focused. This is a working document for a solo builder, not a spec for a team. Write what's needed to start building and validating — nothing more.

**Target length**: 100–150 lines. If you're going longer, cut.

**Sections to include** (in this order, no others):

1. Overview
2. Problem Statement
3. Goals & Objectives
4. Target User
5. Core Features
6. Success Metrics
7. Validation Plan (Landing Page)

**Sections to exclude** — do not generate these:
- User Stories (implicit in Core Features)
- Technical Requirements (too speculative pre-build)
- Data Model (too speculative pre-build)
- Non-Requirements / Out of Scope (keep a single note in Core Features if needed)
- Future Considerations (not needed until post-validation)
- Market Context (already in market-research.md — don't repeat it)
- Implementation Approach / Phase breakdown (belongs in the validation plan, briefly)

## Template

```markdown
# {Experiment Name} - PRD

## Overview

[2–3 sentences: what is this, who is it for, what core job does it do. This is the elevator pitch for the build.]

---

## Problem Statement

[The specific problem being solved. What does the user struggle with today? What do existing solutions miss? Keep to 3–5 bullet points or 2 short paragraphs.]

---

## Goals & Objectives

1. [Primary goal — the one thing this must do well]
2. [Secondary goal]
3. [Tertiary goal, if genuinely distinct]

---

## Target User

**Primary**: [One sentence description — who they are, what context they're in, what they need]

**Secondary** (optional): [One sentence if there's a meaningfully different second audience]

**Not for**: [One sentence on who this is explicitly not for — helps keep scope honest]

---

## Core Features

### MVP scope

- **[Feature 1]**: [What it does and why it matters — 1–2 sentences]
- **[Feature 2]**: [What it does and why it matters]
- **[Feature 3]**: [What it does and why it matters]
- **[Feature 4]** (if needed): [What it does and why it matters]

**Out of scope for MVP**: [comma-separated list of the most tempting things to exclude]

---

## Success Metrics

**Validation phase:**
- [Metric]: [target, e.g. "Landing page email signup rate: > 5%"]
- [Metric]: [target]
- **Go/no-go threshold**: [what result triggers a build decision]

**MVP phase:**
- [Metric]: [target, e.g. "Time to first print: < 60 seconds"]
- [Metric]: [target]

---

## Validation Plan (Landing Page)

[2–4 sentences: what the landing page tests, what traffic source, what the buy/signup CTA is, and how long to run it before deciding.]
```
