# Go Development Rules for Cursor

## Project Structure
- Use `cmd/${program}/main.go` for main applications
- Use `pkg/**/*.go` for shared libraries and packages
- Keep packages focused and cohesive

## Build and Run Commands
- NO Make - use simple Go commands only
- Build: `go build ./cmd/har-mcp`
- Run: `go run ./cmd/har-mcp`
- Test: `go test ./...`
- Format: `go fmt ./...`
- Vet: `go vet ./...`
- Tidy dependencies: `go mod tidy`

## Code Style
- Follow standard Go formatting with `gofmt`
- Use standard Go naming conventions (PascalCase for exported, camelCase for unexported)
- Keep functions and methods small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid unnecessary else clauses when using early returns

## Coding
- You should have access to a godoc tool. Use it as much as possible
- Don't guess interfaces. Use the tools that you have to doublecheck what you are doing is correct

## Testing
- Use github.com/stretchr/testify for assertions
- NO table-driven tests - use test helpers instead
- Test file naming: `*_test.go`
- Test function naming: `TestFunctionName`
- Use `require` for test setup that must succeed, `assert` for actual test assertions
- Create helper functions to reduce test duplication
- Test one thing per test function

## Error Handling
- Always handle errors explicitly
- Use meaningful error messages
- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- Return errors as the last return value

## Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Use standard library when possible
- Pin dependency versions in go.mod

## Comments
- Use godoc style comments for exported functions and types
- Comment explains WHY, not WHAT
- Keep comments concise and up-to-date

## Performance
- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures
- Be mindful of memory allocations in hot paths

## Concurrency
- Use channels for communication between goroutines
- Avoid shared mutable state
- Use context.Context for cancellation and timeouts
- Prefer composition over inheritance
