# Debugging (Android)

Guide for diagnosing common issues with DAT SDK integrations.

## Quick diagnosis

```text
Device not connecting?
|
+-- Is Developer Mode enabled? -> Enable in Meta AI app settings
|
+-- Is device registered? -> Check registrationState
|
+-- Is device in range? -> Bluetooth on, glasses powered on
|
+-- Did you call initialize()? -> Must call Wearables.initialize(context) first
|
+-- Stream not receiving frames? -> Check device connection state
```

## Developer Mode

Developer Mode must be enabled for 3P apps to access device features.

### Enabling Developer Mode

1. Open Meta AI app on phone
2. Go to Settings -> (Your connected glasses)
3. Find "Developer Mode" toggle
4. Toggle ON
5. Device may restart

### Symptoms of Developer Mode disabled

- Registration completes but device never connects
- StreamSession stuck without streaming
- Permission requests fail or never appear

### Common gotchas

- Developer Mode toggles **off** after firmware updates — re-enable it
- Developer Mode is per-device — enable for each glasses pair
- Some features need additional permissions beyond Developer Mode

## StreamSession state issues

### Expected flow

```text
STARTING -> STARTED -> STREAMING -> STOPPING -> STOPPED -> CLOSED
```

### Not receiving frames

- Check that `Wearables.initialize(context)` was called
- Verify device is connected and in range
- Ensure camera permission was granted
- Check that the device selector matches an available device

### Unexpected stop

- Device disconnected (out of range, battery died)
- Channel closed by device
- Error in frame processing

## Version compatibility

Ensure compatible versions of SDK, Meta AI app, and glasses firmware:

| SDK | Meta AI App | Ray-Ban Meta | Meta Ray-Ban Display |
|-----|-------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 0.6.0 | Check [version dependencies](https://wearables.developer.meta.com/docs/version-dependencies) | Check docs | Check docs |
| 0.4.0 | V254 | V20 | V21 |
| 0.3.0 | V249 | V20 | — |

## Known issues

| Issue | Workaround |
|-------|-----------|
| No internet -> registration fails | Internet required for registration |
| Streams started with glasses doffed pause when donned | Unpause by tapping side of glasses |
| `DeviceSession` unreliable with camera stream | Avoid using `DeviceSession` |

## Adding debug logging

```kotlin
import android.util.Log

private const val TAG = "DATWearables"

// In your streaming code:
Log.d(TAG, "Stream state changed to: $state")
Log.e(TAG, "Stream error", exception)
```

## Checklist

- [ ] `Wearables.initialize(context)` called before any API use
- [ ] Developer Mode enabled in Meta AI app
- [ ] Meta AI app updated to compatible version
- [ ] Glasses firmware updated to compatible version
- [ ] Internet connection available for registration
- [ ] Bluetooth permissions granted (`BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`)
- [ ] Correct URL scheme in AndroidManifest.xml intent filter
- [ ] `APPLICATION_ID` meta-data set in manifest
