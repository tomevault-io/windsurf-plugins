# Session Lifecycle (Android)

Guide for managing device session states in DAT SDK integrations.

## Overview

The DAT SDK runs work inside sessions. Meta glasses expose two experience types:
- **Device sessions** — sustained access to device sensors and outputs
- **Transactions** — short, system-owned interactions (notifications, "Hey Meta")

Your app observes session state changes — the device decides when to transition.

## Session states

| State | Meaning | App action |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `STOPPED` | Session inactive, not reconnecting | Free resources, wait for user action |
| `RUNNING` | Session active, streaming data | Perform live work |
| `PAUSED` | Temporarily suspended | Hold work, may resume |

## Observing session state

```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
    Wearables.getDeviceSessionState(deviceId).collect { state ->
        when (state) {
            SessionState.RUNNING -> onRunning()
            SessionState.PAUSED -> onPaused()
            SessionState.STOPPED -> onStopped()
        }
    }
}
```

## StreamSession state transitions

```text
STARTING -> STARTED -> STREAMING -> STOPPING -> STOPPED -> CLOSED
```

```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
    session.state.collect { state ->
        // React to state changes
    }
}
```

## Common transitions

The device changes session state when:
- User performs a system gesture that opens another experience
- Another app starts a device session
- User removes or folds the glasses (Bluetooth disconnects)
- User removes the app from Meta AI companion app
- Connectivity between companion app and glasses drops

## Pause and resume

When a session is paused:
- The device keeps the connection alive
- Streams stop delivering data
- The device may resume by returning to `RUNNING`

Your app should **not** attempt to restart while paused — wait for `RUNNING` or `STOPPED`.

## Device availability

```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
    Wearables.devices.collect { devices ->
        // Update list of available glasses
    }
}
```

Key behaviors:
- Closing hinges disconnects Bluetooth -> forces `STOPPED`
- Opening hinges restores Bluetooth but does **not** restart sessions
- Start a new session after the device becomes available again

## Implementation checklist

- [ ] Handle all session states (`RUNNING`, `PAUSED`, `STOPPED`)
- [ ] Monitor device availability before starting work
- [ ] Release resources only after `STOPPED`
- [ ] Don't infer transition causes — rely only on observable state
- [ ] Don't restart during `PAUSED` — wait for system to resume or stop
