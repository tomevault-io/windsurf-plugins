# Repository Guidance for Coding Agents

## Project purpose

JS Eyes is a local-first browser capability and site-skill runtime for AI
agents. The browser extension, server, SDK, CLI, MCP facade, and optional host
adapters are separate layers over the same protocol and policy model.

CLI, MCP, and OpenClaw are peer host surfaces. Do not make a host-specific
adapter the owner of behavior that belongs in the host-neutral runtime.

## Repository map

- `apps/cli` contains the public `js-eyes` command.
- `apps/native-host` contains the browser Native Messaging host.
- `packages/protocol` owns shared protocol constants, browser-operation
  metadata/handlers, and browser-operation catalogs. Install helpers live in
  `@js-eyes/skill-install` (not under `protocol`).
- `packages/skill-install` owns skill discovery, install, trust, ZIP/npm, and
  registry helpers (formerly under `protocol`).
- `packages/policy` owns `PolicyContext` and related egress/taint/task-origin
  policy primitives used by server-core and the client SDK.
- `packages/client-sdk` owns the Node.js browser client (may re-export selected
  policy symbols from its main entry; prefer `@js-eyes/policy` directly).
- `packages/server-core` owns the local HTTP and WebSocket server.
- `packages/mcp-server` is the native stdio MCP facade.
- `packages/skill-contract` validates Skill metadata; `packages/skill-runtime`
  owns host-neutral Skill Runtime V2, including isolated worker execution.
- `openclaw-plugin` (`@js-eyes/openclaw-plugin`) is an optional OpenClaw
  adapter workspace. Core packages must not import it.
- `extensions/shared` is the canonical source for cross-browser extension
  behavior. Chrome and Firefox copies are generated from it.
- `skills/*` are independently versioned site skills.
- `packages/devtools` owns builds, release staging, and generated artifacts.
- `distribution` contains source templates for distributable artifacts.
- `src` contains the public website source.
- `dist` contains generated output and must not be edited by hand.

## Architecture boundaries

Preserve these dependency directions:

```text
browser extension
        |
  server-core
        |
   client-sdk
        |
host-neutral runtime
        |
CLI / MCP / optional OpenClaw adapter
```

- Keep host discovery, trust, invocation, configuration, cancellation, and
  disposal in the host-neutral Skill Runtime.
- Keep OpenClaw configuration migration, registration, consent presentation,
  and watcher integration inside `openclaw-plugin`.
- Skill discovery must inspect static metadata only. Never execute a skill
  entry module during discovery.
- A V2 skill must declare its tools, schemas, risks, and capabilities in
  `skill.manifest.json`.
- Browser permissions granted to a skill must be intersected with the
  capabilities declared by the invoked tool.
- Prefer first-class protocol operations over implementing ordinary browser
  actions through arbitrary JavaScript.
- Avoid adding compatibility aliases silently. If compatibility is necessary,
  document its lifetime and test it explicitly.

## Browser extension changes

- Edit shared cross-browser behavior in `extensions/shared` first.
- Do not independently patch injected Chrome and Firefox runtime copies.
- After shared changes, prepare staging with `npm run sync:extension-shared`
  (writes `dist/extensions-stage/{chrome,firefox}`); builders inject shared
  the same way. Load unpacked extensions from the staged directories.
- Keep Chrome MV3 and Firefox MV2 loading differences in their platform entry
  modules.
- Treat authentication, request validation, deduplication, rate limiting,
  reconnection, uploads, screenshots, and sender validation as security- or
  reliability-sensitive behavior.

## Skill changes

- Each directory under `skills/` is an independent package with its own
  version and compatibility range.
- Keep `skill.manifest.json`, `skill.entry.js`, `skill.definition.js`,
  `package.json`, and `SKILL.md` consistent for official V2 Skills. Treat
  `skill.contract.js` is no longer activated by the runtime (V1 removed).
- New tools must have a stable name, JSON Schema input, risk classification,
  and the minimum capabilities required.
- `read`, `interactive`, `destructive`, and `administrative` are meaningful
  policy inputs; do not downgrade a risk to make a tool easier to expose.
- Prefer structured, site-semantic operations over exposing low-level page
  scripts to callers.
- Document login requirements and unavailable or experimental commands
  accurately.
- Do not assume Worker execution is an operating-system sandbox. Direct
  filesystem, process, and network access remain trust decisions.

## Security invariants

- Never print or persist authentication tokens, cookie values, script bodies,
  CSS payloads, uploaded file contents, full HTML, or screenshot base64 in
  ordinary logs or error summaries.
- Keep the default MCP profile safe. Sensitive tools must remain absent from
  discovery unless the operator explicitly selects a broader profile.
- Preserve loopback binding, origin validation, token authentication, audit
  logging, task-origin tracking, taint checks, and egress policy unless the
  change explicitly targets one of those controls.
