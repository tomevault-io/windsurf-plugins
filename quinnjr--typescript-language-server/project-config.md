# Git Workflow

This project uses **git-flow** for branch management.

## Branch Structure

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Production-ready code, tagged releases only |
| `develop` | Integration branch for features |
| `feature/*` | New features (branch from `develop`) |
| `release/*` | Release preparation (branch from `develop`) |
| `hotfix/*` | Production fixes (branch from `main`) |
| `bugfix/*` | Bug fixes (branch from `develop`) |

## Branch Naming

- `feature/short-description` - New features
- `release/v1.2.0` - Release candidates
- `hotfix/v1.2.1` - Production hotfixes
- `bugfix/issue-123-description` - Bug fixes

## Workflow Rules

1. **Never commit directly to `main` or `develop`**
2. All changes go through pull requests
3. Feature branches merge into `develop`
4. Release branches merge into both `main` and `develop`
5. Hotfix branches merge into both `main` and `develop`

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Formatting, no code change
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

Examples:
```
feat(parser): add support for JSX fragments
fix(completions): handle undefined symbol table
docs(readme): update installation instructions
chore(deps): update tree-sitter to v0.22
```

## Release Process

1. Create release branch: `git flow release start v1.2.0`
2. Update version numbers
3. Update CHANGELOG
4. Finish release: `git flow release finish v1.2.0`
5. Push tags: `git push origin --tags`

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Start a feature
git flow feature start my-feature

# Finish a feature (merges to develop)
git flow feature finish my-feature

# Start a release
git flow release start v1.0.0

# Finish a release (merges to main and develop, creates tag)
git flow release finish v1.0.0

# Start a hotfix
git flow hotfix start v1.0.1

# Finish a hotfix (merges to main and develop, creates tag)
git flow hotfix finish v1.0.1
```
