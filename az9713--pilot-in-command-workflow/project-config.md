# PIC Agentic Organizational System

## What Is This?

The **PIC (Pilot in Command) Agentic Organizational System** is a workflow management framework that coordinates multiple AI agents to solve problems systematically. Inspired by NVIDIA's Nemotron project management model, it breaks complex tasks into phases, each owned by a specialized "Pilot in Command."

Think of it like an airplane cockpit: there's always one pilot in command at any moment, with clear authority and responsibility. When their phase is complete, they hand off to the next pilot.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize the system (first time only)
bash scripts/pic-init.sh

# 2. Start a workflow with your problem
# Type in Claude Code:
/pic-start Build a user login system

# 3. Watch the agents work through each phase
# 4. Check status anytime with:
/pic-status
```

## Core Concepts

### The Six Phases

Every workflow goes through six phases in order:

```
1. Research    → Gather information about the problem
2. Planning    → Create a strategy and roadmap
3. Design      → Define technical architecture
4. Implementation → Write the code
5. Testing     → Verify everything works
6. Review      → Final quality check
```

### Key Principles

1. **Decentralized Ownership** - Each phase has one owner with full authority
2. **Data-Driven Decisions** - All decisions require evidence
3. **Clear Handoffs** - Explicit transitions between phases
4. **Conflict Resolution** - Structured process when agents disagree

## Available Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/pic-start [problem]` | Start a new workflow |
| `/pic-status` | Show current progress |
| `/pic-decide [title]` | Record a formal decision |
| `/pic-handoff [notes]` | Move to next phase |
| `/pic-conflict [summary]` | Escalate a disagreement |
| `/pic-integration [components]` | Test components together |
| `/pic-audit` | View detailed audit trail |
| `/dependency-risk-planner [lib]` | Pre-flight dependency risk assessment (use BEFORE writing code) |

## Agent Mapping

Each PIC role uses a Claude Code built-in agent:

| PIC Role | Agent Type | What They Do |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Research | `Explore` | Search, read, gather information |
| Planning | `planner` | Create strategies and plans |
| Design | `planner` | Define architecture |
| Implementation | `builder` | Write code |
| Testing | `test-writer` | Write and run tests |
| Review | `reviewer` | Check quality |
