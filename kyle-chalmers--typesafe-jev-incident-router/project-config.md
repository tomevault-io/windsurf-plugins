## Project overview

This is a public demonstration repository for TypeSafe Jev. Its primary artifact and main reader value is [`docs/data-team-use-cases.md`](./docs/data-team-use-cases.md), a guide to practical decision-engine use cases across data engineering, analytics engineering, data analytics, and data science. Keep that guide easy to find from the top of the README and preserve its concise, public-facing format.

The runnable Python incident router supports the guide with one concrete implementation. It checks an exact response-team registry first, uses TypeSafe Jev for bounded semantic judgments when exact data is unavailable, and sends uncertain or consequential cases to a durable review queue.

Intended users are data professionals and Python developers evaluating probabilistic routing inside operational workflows.

## Available tools

- `uv sync`: install the pinned environment.
- `uv run pytest -q`: run the offline test suite.
- `uv run python -m scripts.route_incident --help`: inspect routing commands.
- `uv run python -m scripts.evaluate_calibration --help`: inspect calibration metrics.
- `uv run python -m scripts.assess_use_case_boundaries`: repeat the guide's live Jev boundary check; requires `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` and makes billed API requests.

## Environment

- Python 3.11 or newer.
- `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is required only for live requests.
- Export `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the current shell or load it from a local `.env`. Never commit `.env`.
- Concrete private values belong in `.internal/OWNER_CONFIG.md`.

## Code conventions

- Keep questions and policy constants in `tools/questions.py`.
- Keep TypeSafe transport behind the client interface in `tools/clients.py`.
- Keep routing policy pure and independently testable.
- Preserve complete probability distributions in decision evidence.
- Treat thresholds as illustrative until they are calibrated on representative labeled cases.
- Use synthetic tracked data only.

## Workflow

1. Validate the incident input.
2. Check the exact response-team registry.
3. Evaluate bounded judgments when exact ownership is unavailable.
4. Apply policy in Python.
5. Persist review decisions when automatic routing is unsafe.
6. Verify every behavior with offline fixtures before making a live request.

## Working principles

Explain non-obvious design choices briefly. Fail safely when the service is unavailable. Keep sensitive data out of logs and fixtures. Verify results with commands and tests before reporting success.
