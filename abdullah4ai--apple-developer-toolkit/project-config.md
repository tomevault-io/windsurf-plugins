# Apple Developer Toolkit Agentic Engineering Rules

Apply these rules whenever Cursor works in this repository.

## Route Tools Explicitly

- Apple docs and WWDC lookup: use `node cli.js` from the repo.
- App Store Connect work: use `appledev store`.
- App scaffolding and fix loops: use `appledev build`.
- Design/platform rules: read only the relevant `references/`, `skills/ios-rules/`, or `skills/swiftui-guides/` files.

## Side Effects Need Approval

Read-only commands are safe by default: docs search, symbols, doc, overview, samples, WWDC lookup, status, validate, diff, docs, doctor, and reference reads.

Ask before any mutation: App Store Connect writes, uploads, TestFlight/App Store publish, pricing, IAP, subscriptions, signing, devices, webhooks, notarization, Xcode Cloud runs, local project writes, simulator launches, hook installation, commits, pushes, PRs, merges, releases, or tags.

Never post to X/Twitter from this repository or skill.

## Memory and Observability

- Do not persist raw task logs, App Store state, generated code, build errors, credentials, or temporary decisions to long-term memory.
- Keep run artifacts in repo-local files when needed.
- Summarize what was checked, what changed, what did not change, and remaining risks.

## Upstream Sync

After upstream sync commits, run:

```bash
bash scripts/apply-agentic-engineering.sh
```

Then check:

```bash
git diff --check -- README.md SKILL.md skills/apple-developer-toolkit/README.md
npx skills add . --list --full-depth
```
