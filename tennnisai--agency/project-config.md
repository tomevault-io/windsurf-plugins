# Working in this repo

Agency is a Tauri 2 desktop app: a Rust backend in `crates/` and a React + Vite
frontend in `ui/`. See `README.md` for the layout and build instructions, and
`docs/` for the design record.

## Git hygiene

These two rules exist because both have already been broken here, and both are
expensive to fix after the fact.

- **No AI attribution, ever.** No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, no
  "Generated with" line, no session URL, in a commit message or a PR body. Write
  the message and stop. Every commit has to be attributable to a person who can
  license it, and an agent cannot; a trailer is a claim against that. It applies
  to the **author and committer fields** as much as the message — eight commits
  authored by an agent reached `main` through merged PRs before anyone noticed,
  because `commit-msg` is never passed those fields. The `authorship` job in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` checks them on every PR; the hook cannot.
- **No competitor product name anywhere in the repo.** Not in a commit message,
  a branch name, a PR title, or a document. This was once scoped to git metadata
  alone, on the grounds that the design record was private and could name names
  freely. Publishing the repo removed that exemption, and the named readings
  moved out of the tree entirely. Describe the observation, not who it is about:
  "a self-hosted alternative to the hosted agent runners", never the product's
  name.

`.githooks/commit-msg` enforces both in messages, and `./dev.sh` points
`core.hooksPath` at it. The hook only knows the distinctive names. Competitors
whose names are ordinary English words are deliberately left out of it: a guard
that trips on everyday prose is a guard that gets bypassed into uselessness.
Those are your judgment call, not the hook's.

Commit subjects are imperative and lower-case after the first word. Branch names
describe the work.

## Build and test

```sh
cargo fmt                                  # rustfmt.toml: max_width 100, small_heuristics Max
cargo test -p agency-core -p agency-app
./dev.sh                                   # builds the termd sidecar, then tauri dev
```

Frontend, from the repo root:

```sh
pnpm --dir ui install
ui/node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
ui/node_modules/.bin/vite build
```

- **Use `pnpm`, never `npm`.** The lockfile is pnpm's, and npm churns it.
- **Invoke the frontend binaries directly**, as above. pnpm 11's
  `exec`/`test`/`build` wrappers exit 1 on an esbuild ignored-build even when the
  underlying command succeeded, so a green build looks red.
- **`./dev.sh`, not `tauri dev`.** Tauri's `beforeDevCommand` starts Vite only;
  it does not build the `agency-termd` daemon, and `AppState::new()` fails
  without it. A *stale* `target/debug/agency-termd` is worse than a missing one:
  it runs old daemon code silently. Rebuild it when you touch anything under
  `crates/agency-core/src/term/`.
- Tests leak orphan `agency-termd` processes. Never kill the one under
  Application Support; that is the user's live daemon.
- **Regenerate the notices after any dependency change.** `python3
  scripts/third-party.py` (needs `ui/node_modules` installed) rewrites
  `THIRD-PARTY.md`, which reproduces the licence of every crate and package the
  .app ships. MIT wants its notice in every copy and Apache-2.0 s4(a) wants the
  licence to travel with the binary, and a linked binary is both; before this
  existed the bundle carried 315 crates and 111 packages and not one of their
  copyright notices. The `app` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` fails a PR
  whose notices file has fallen behind.

## User-facing copy

- **No emoji anywhere in the UI.** Icons are monochrome text glyphs (`◈ ⇋ ≳ ∥`).
  If a glyph has an emoji presentation, pin it with U+FE0E.
- **No em dashes in UI copy.** Split the sentence, or use a comma, semicolon,
  colon or parentheses. Docs are exempt; strings the user reads are not.
- Sentence case, second person, present tense.
- Say "no first-party data collection", never "nothing leaves your machine".
  Wherever the claim appears, say in the same breath that the agents are third
  party and talk to their own providers; the app's whole job is launching them,
  so a claim that omits them is the one a reader catches. On the site, where the
  claim is made in full, the GitHub update check appears with it too. In the app
  it does not have to: it is one toggle in Settings, and a starter note is not a
  privacy page. `guide.rs` holds the canonical wording as `OPENING`, and a test
  pins it; that const is the reference, not any prose elsewhere.

## Code conventions

The house style is a pure, heavily unit-tested transition function with the side
effects hoisted to the caller: `looper.rs`, `notifier.rs`, `activity.rs` and
`mcp.rs` are the models to copy. If new logic needs a repo, a daemon or a running
app to test, it is probably in the wrong layer.

- **Name the observed failure in the comment above the fix.** Not "handle the
  edge case" but what actually happened, with the number if there is one: "2,417
  duplicate rows observed", "claude does not exit on resume-failure in a PTY, so
  the daemon's early-exit fallback cannot recover it". The code then reads as a
