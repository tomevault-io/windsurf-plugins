# Operating rules for this repo

This repo is a skills + agents library. Work here is rarely a single edit — it is research, planning, and dispatch across many specialists. Two capabilities make that tractable: **persistent memory** and **subagents**. Use them aggressively and correctly.

The doctrine is split into focused rule files under `.claude/rules/`, imported below. Edit those files, not this list. (These imports are repo-local editing ergonomics; `install.sh` never ships `CLAUDE.md` or `rules/` to consumers.)

@.claude/rules/factual-correctness.md
@.claude/rules/memory-discipline.md
@.claude/rules/subagent-dispatch.md
@.claude/rules/briefing.md
@.claude/rules/grounding.md
@.claude/rules/review-tiers.md
@.claude/rules/verification.md
@.claude/rules/anti-patterns.md
@.claude/rules/communication.md
