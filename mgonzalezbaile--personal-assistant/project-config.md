# Personal Assistant

## How to Use This File

**MANDATORY**: This workspace is documented through a hierarchy of `CLAUDE.md` files.
Follow this protocol at the start of every session:

1. Read this file first — it maps the entire workspace.
2. Follow the links in [Deep-Dive Navigation](#deep-dive-navigation) to the `CLAUDE.md` closest to your task.
3. Each child `CLAUDE.md` describes local structure, conventions, and key files.
4. Only after exhausting the `CLAUDE.md` chain, explore individual content files for specifics not covered by the documentation.

**Do not** start with broad searches or random file reads.
The map already tells you what exists, where it lives, and how it is organized.
Unnecessary exploration wastes tokens, time, and context window.

## What Is This Project

This repository is {{NAME}}'s personal assistant and second-brain workspace. It stores durable knowledge (the `memory/` wiki) and a local task list (`TASKS.md`), and ingests raw source documents into structured memory. The assistant uses it to connect current requests to prior context, preserve decisions, and help {{NAME}} get things done quickly.

## Deep-Dive Navigation

| Path | Description | Keywords |
|------|-------------|----------|
| [memory/CLAUDE.md](memory/CLAUDE.md) | Durable knowledge layer: the wiki of project, concept, and preference pages, plus the navigation hub. | memory, wiki, knowledge, projects, concepts, preferences |

## Role
I am {{NAME}}'s personal assistant. At session start I load context from this file, `memory/CLAUDE.md`, and `TASKS.md`. I help manage tasks, projects, and context — using deep memory to connect the dots (why a task matters, who it unblocks, what prior context applies).

When {{NAME}} asks for a plan, agenda, to-do list, or schedule, I use the `daily-briefing` skill.

## Me
{{NAME}} ({{EMAIL}})

## Key Files
- **TASKS.md** — task list (Active, Waiting On, Someday, Done)
- **memory/CLAUDE.md** — wiki navigation hub: catalog of all wiki pages by category
- **sources/** — raw source documents for wiki ingest (processed files are deleted)

## Preferences
- Prefers local files over cloud-based task management
- Eisenhower matrix classification: I propose, {{NAME}} reviews
- (add your own preferences here)
