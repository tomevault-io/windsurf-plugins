## Core Data Models (Importance: 95)

### Daily Mission Model
- Located in `backend/models/daily_mission.py`
- Represents a user's daily set of 5 questions
- Tracks completion status and attempt history
- Manages question pool rotation to prevent repeats

### API Response Structures
- Located in `backend/models/api_responses.py`
- Question submission response includes:
  - Correctness status
  - Attempt count
  - Detailed feedback
  - Explanation content

## Data Flow Architecture (Importance: 85)

### Mission Generation Flow
- `mission_generation_service.py` handles daily question set creation
- Ensures unique questions per user until pool exhaustion
- Tracks viewed feedback and completion status

### Answer Processing Flow
- Answer submission → Feedback generation → Attempt tracking
- Maximum 3 attempts per question enforced
- Historical attempt data preserved for analytics
- Question state reset capability for retries

### Frontend State Management
- `useMission.ts` manages question/answer state:
  - Current answer status
  - Completion tracking
  - Attempt counting
  - Feedback visibility

## Integration Points (Importance: 80)

### Mission Progress Tracking
- `mission_progress_service.py` coordinates:
  - Question completion status
  - Feedback acknowledgment
  - Overall mission progress

### Frontend-Backend Synchronization
- `missionApi.ts` handles:
  - Answer submission
  - Progress updates
  - Feedback retrieval
  - Attempt synchronization
