# Roo Agent Rules for Code Modification

Constraint: Do NOT add comments explaining import statements, type definitions derived from schemas/models, or basic code structure. Focus ONLY on the 'why' for non-obvious logic

Zero Tolerance Rule: "Code comments are FORBIDDEN unless they explain the 'why' behind a piece of non-obvious logic. Comments explaining the 'what' of the code are never allowed. If in doubt, DO NOT add a comment."
Explicit Review Step: "Before submitting any code (via write_to_file or apply_diff), perform a final check: read every comment and delete it if it merely describes the code below it or the task at hand."
Keyword Ban: "Do not use comments like '// Import ...', '// Define ...', '// Call ...', '// Return ...', '// Instantiate ...', '// Map ...', '// Access ...', '// Create ...', '// Use foo directly', etc."

STRICT Requirement for ALL edits: Read your edit before writing it to a file. Ensure it complies with the comment rules above. If it does not, revise it until it does.

Do NOT add comments solely to describe the change being made in a diff or to explain standard code patterns (like defining a method). Comments must strictly adhere to explaining the 'why' of non-obvious logic.

## 1. Pre-Edit Analysis Requirements

BEFORE making any code changes, MUST:

- Use `mcp__get_document_symbols` on the target file to understand its structure
- Use `mcp__find_usages` on any symbol being modified to identify all affected locations
- Use `mcp__get_type_definition` and/or `mcp__go_to_definition` for any types or symbols being modified
- Use `mcp__get_hover_info` to verify function signatures and type information

## 2. Impact Analysis Rules

BEFORE proceeding with changes:

1. If `mcp__find_usages` reveals usage in multiple files:

   - Must analyze each usage context
   - Must verify type compatibility across all uses
   - Must plan changes for all affected locations

2. If modifying interfaces or types:
   - Must use `mcp__find_implementations` to locate all implementations
   - Must ensure changes won't break implementing classes
   - Must verify backward compatibility or plan updates for all implementations

## 3. Type Safety Rules

MUST maintain type safety by:

1. Using `mcp__get_type_definition` for:

   - All modified parameters
   - Return types
   - Interface members
   - Generic constraints

2. Using `mcp__get_hover_info` to verify:
   - Function signatures
   - Type constraints
   - Optional vs required properties

## 4. Code Modification Sequence

When making changes:

1. First gather context:

```typescript
// Example sequence
await mcp__get_document_symbols(file)
await mcp__find_usages(symbol)
await mcp__get_type_definition(symbol)
await mcp__get_hover_info(symbol)
```

2. Then analyze impact:

```typescript
// For each usage found
await mcp__get_hover_info(usage)
await mcp__get_type_definition(relatedTypes)
```

3. Only then use `edit_file`

## 5. Post-Edit Verification

After making changes:

1. Use `mcp__get_document_symbols` to verify file structure remains valid
2. Use `mcp__find_usages` to verify all usages are still compatible
3. Use `mcp__get_hover_info` to verify new type signatures

## 6. Special Cases

### When Modifying React Components:

1. Must use `mcp__find_usages` to:

   - Find all component instances
   - Verify prop usage
   - Check for defaultProps and propTypes

2. Must use `mcp__get_type_definition` for:
   - Prop interfaces
   - State types
   - Context types

### When Modifying APIs/Functions:

1. Must use `mcp__get_call_hierarchy` to:
   - Understand the call chain
   - Identify dependent functions
   - Verify changes won't break callers

### When Modifying Types/Interfaces:

1. Must use `mcp__find_implementations` to:
   - Locate all implementing classes
   - Verify compatibility
   - Plan updates if needed

## 7. Error Prevention Rules

1. NEVER modify a symbol without first:

```typescript
await mcp__find_usages(symbol)
await mcp__get_type_definition(symbol)
```

2. NEVER modify a type without:

```typescript
await mcp__find_implementations(type)
await mcp__get_hover_info(type)
```

3. NEVER modify a function signature without:

```typescript
await mcp__get_call_hierarchy(function)
await mcp__find_usages(function)
```

## 8. Documentation Requirements

When explaining changes, must reference:

1. What tools were used to analyze the code
2. What usages were found
3. What type information was verified
4. What impact analysis was performed

Example:

```markdown
I analyzed the code using:

1. mcp\_\_find_usages to locate all 5 usages of handleSubmit
2. mcp\_\_get_type_definition to verify the function signature
3. mcp\_\_get_hover_info to check parameter types
4. mcp\_\_get_document_symbols to understand the component structure
```

## 9. Change Abort Conditions

Must ABORT changes if:

1. `mcp__find_usages` reveals unexpected usages
2. `mcp__get_type_definition` shows incompatible types
3. `mcp__find_implementations` shows breaking changes
4. Unable to verify full impact using available tools

## 10. Tool Priority Order

When analyzing code, use tools in this order:

1. `mcp__get_document_symbols` (understand structure)
