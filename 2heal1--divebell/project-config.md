# Divebell Agent Guide

## Project goal

Divebell is an extensible web development and debugging tool for Coding Agents. It provides ready-to-use workflows for real web scenarios and lets teams connect their own accounts, environments, internal platforms, diagnostic methods, and acceptance criteria through Extensions.

The Coding Agent reads and changes code; Divebell connects user entry points with the team's existing domain capabilities. An Extension can identify applications, environments, deployments, and other resources from the current page, call existing SDKs, OpenAPIs, CLIs, or internal platforms, and then verify changes with the same account, environment, and user path. When application-internal facts are needed, expose states, events, declared actions, and wait conditions through the Runtime SDK API.

## Authoritative documentation

Use these sources in descending priority:

1. `README.md`: current product positioning, capability boundaries, and documentation index.
2. `docs/agent-devloop.md`: the real development and debugging loop and minimal-intervention principles.
3. `docs/cli-extensions.md`: Extensions and the Extension API.
4. `docs/runtime-sdk-api.md`: Runtime SDK boundaries and public integration.
5. `skills/divebell-runtime/references/api.md` and `skills/divebell-runtime/references/integration.md`: complete Runtime SDK fields, behavior, and integration.
6. `.codex/skills/mf/SKILL.md`: use this skill first for Module Federation, remotes, shared dependencies, manifests, observability, and runtime errors.

## Current core design

- The Runtime SDK is an optional enhancement. It is not required for the Divebell CLI, browser debugging, agent-browser authentication, or Extensions.
- Extensions organize accounts, environments, specialized diagnostics, and verification outside the page. The Runtime SDK provides facts and declared actions inside the page.
- The Runtime SDK has no built-in target types or statuses. Each target's `type` and `statuses` are declared by `registerTarget`.
- The Target Registry describes what the page exposes for reference or waiting.
- Snapshot describes the page's current state.
- Event Log describes how states and actions changed.
- Action Registry describes the actions the page allows an Agent to run.
- `runAction` only executes an action and records an action event; it does not update Snapshot automatically. Continue verification with `waitFor`.
- `dependsOn` only describes blocking clues in the current state and belongs primarily in Snapshot. An Event records the change only through the `snapshot.updated` payload.

## Modern.js and MF integration direction

Future Modern.js integration must be implemented as a Modern.js plugin, not as a standalone external adapter. The plugin registers and updates targets Modern.js can know directly, including apps, routes, loaders, route components, SSR, hydration, and navigation.

`@divebell/modern-plugin` is currently a work in progress. It depends on Modern.js lifecycle hooks that have not been released in a stable version. Do not recommend it to regular projects until a Modern.js version containing those hooks is released and compatibility has been verified. Do not infer availability from a version number or preview label. Use `@divebell/core` when page-internal facts are needed. `@divebell/modern-plugin/chunk-map` is an independent build-time capability and does not depend on these runtime hooks.

Future Module Federation integration should be implemented in the MF repository's observability plugin and should reuse MF observability capabilities first. It registers and updates targets MF can know directly, including consumers, remotes, manifests, remote entries, exposes, shared dependencies, and runtime errors.

These plugins depend on hooks exposed by Modern.js or MF. If the available hooks are insufficient, add the hook to Modern.js or MF instead of adding fragile detection inside Divebell.

## Modern.js context

Read facts from the local repository first:

- Modern.js local repository: `/Users/bytedance/fork_repo/modern.js`
- Application framework entry: `packages/solutions/app-tools`
- Routing, runtime, and SSR: `packages/runtime/plugin-runtime`
- Loaders and redirects: `packages/cli/plugin-data-loader`
- Server and BFF: `packages/server/*`
- Early MF evaluation demo: `tests/integration/agent-runtime-mf`

If the local repository does not provide enough context, consult the official documentation at `https://modernjs.dev/guides/get-started/introduction`.

## GitHub pull request operations

- When creating or updating a pull request, use local Git to create the branch, commit, and push. Use an authorized GitHub connector or plugin to create, read, and update the pull request.
- An unauthenticated result from `gh auth status` is not by itself a reason to stop, and does not justify asking the user to log in to `gh`.
