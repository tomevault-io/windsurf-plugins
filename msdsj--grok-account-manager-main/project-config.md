# Repository Guidelines
 
## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository contains the MSDSJ `grok-account-manager` Python automation
package with a React control panel. Python source lives in
`src/grok_account_manager/`: `cli.py` is the CLI entry, `webapp/server.py`
serves the local API/UI, `providers/` contains registration flows such as
`grok.py`, and `sinks/` contains output targets such as TXT, JSON credentials,
and Sub2API. The React app lives in `web/src/`, with Vite configuration in
`web/vite.config.ts`. Browser patch assets are in `extensions/turnstile_patch/`.
Runtime output is written under `output/` and should not be treated as source.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `uv sync`: install Python dependencies from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
- `uv run grok-account-manager grok --count 1 --sink json+txt`: run one local
  registration round and write JSON plus TXT outputs.
- `uv run grok-account-manager-web`: start the Python API and static UI host on
  `127.0.0.1:8765`.
- `cd web && npm install`: install frontend dependencies.
- `cd web && npm run dev`: start the React dev server on `127.0.0.1:5173`.
- `cd web && npm run build`: run TypeScript checks and produce the Vite build.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use Python 3.12 or 3.13; the project explicitly excludes 3.14. Follow existing
Python style: 4-space indentation, type hints for public interfaces, small
provider/sink classes, and clear snake_case names. Keep provider modules named
after their platform, for example `providers/grok.py`. Frontend code uses
strict TypeScript, React function components, PascalCase component names, and
camelCase state/helpers. Keep UI text consistent with the existing Chinese
interface.

## Testing Guidelines

No dedicated test suite is currently present. Before submitting backend
changes, at minimum run `uv run python -m compileall src`. For frontend changes,
run `cd web && npm run build`. If adding tests, place Python tests under
`tests/` mirroring `src/grok_account_manager/`, and name files `test_<module>.py`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

This checkout does not include Git history, so no existing commit convention can
be inferred. Use concise, imperative commits with an optional scope, for example
`providers: add retry around Grok quota fetch`. Pull requests should describe
the behavior change, list verification commands, link related issues when
available, and include screenshots for visible `web/src/` UI changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Never commit `.env` or generated credentials from `output/`. Use `.env.example`
for documented configuration names, especially `SUB2API_BASE_URL` and
`SUB2API_ADMIN_API_KEY`. Treat browser cookies, SSO tokens, and JSON credential
exports as secrets.
