# Commit Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for creating clean, logical commits and
managing the commit workflow.

## 1. Commit Quality Principles

- **Atomic Commits:** Each commit should represent a single logical change or
  feature.
- **Clear Messages:** Use conventional commit format: `type: description`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`
  - Description should be concise but descriptive
- **Logical Grouping:** Group related changes together. Separate unrelated
  changes into different commits.
- **No Broken States:** Never commit code that breaks the build or tests.

## 2. Pre-Commit Validation

Before committing, ensure:

- **Build Success:** Run `mvn clean package` to verify the project compiles and
  builds successfully.
- **Tests Pass:** Run `mvn test` to ensure all tests pass.
- **No Lint Errors:** Check for any linter errors or warnings that should be
  addressed.
- **Logical Completeness:** Ensure all related changes for a feature/fix are
  included together.
- **No Debug Code:** Remove any debug statements, commented-out code, or
  temporary files.

## 3. Commit Workflow

### Step 1: Stage Changes

```bash
git add <files>
# Or use git add -p for interactive staging to review changes
```

### Step 2: Review Staged Changes

```bash
git diff --cached
# Review what will be committed to ensure it's logical and complete
```

### Step 3: Commit

```bash
git commit -m "type: clear and descriptive message"
```

### Step 4: Validate Commit

After committing, validate:

```bash
# Check the commit looks correct
git log -1 --stat

# Verify build still works
mvn clean package

# Verify tests still pass
mvn test
```

### Step 5: Amend if Needed

If you discover issues or want to add related changes:

```bash
# Make additional changes
git add <files>
git commit --amend --no-edit  # Keep same message
# OR
git commit --amend -m "type: updated message"  # Update message
```

**When to Amend:**

- Adding forgotten files that are part of the same logical change
- Fixing typos or small issues in the same commit
- Improving commit message clarity
- Adding related changes that should be grouped together

**When NOT to Amend:**

- After pushing to a shared branch (unless you're the only one using it)
- If the commit is already part of a PR or review
- If it would rewrite history that others have based work on

### Step 6: Final Validation Before Push

Before pushing, ensure:

- All commits are logical and complete
- Build succeeds: `mvn clean package`
- Tests pass: `mvn test`
- No obvious issues or incomplete work
- Commit messages are clear and follow conventions

### Step 7: Push

```bash
git push origin <branch>
```

## 4. Amending Before Push

**Always amend commits before pushing if:**

- You're still on a local branch (not yet pushed)
- You discover related changes that belong in the same commit
- The commit message needs improvement
- You want to add files that were part of the same logical change

**Amend workflow:**

```bash
# Make additional changes
git add <files>

# Amend the last commit (keeps it as one logical unit)
git commit --amend --no-edit  # If message is fine
# OR
git commit --amend -m "type: improved message"  # If updating message

# Validate again
mvn clean package
mvn test

# Then push
git push origin <branch>
```

## 5. Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (version bumps, dependency updates)
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system changes

**Examples:**

```
feat: add pagination to FindReferencesTool
fix: correct error handling in DecompileCodeTool
docs: update README with latest features
refactor: migrate tools to use new schema builders
test: add comprehensive tests for JSON Schema builders
chore: bump version to v0.5.0
ci: update workflow to use mvn clean package
```

## 6. Multiple Related Commits

If you have multiple related commits that should be grouped:

1. Make all commits locally
2. Review the commit sequence: `git log --oneline`
3. Use interactive rebase to squash or reorder if needed: `git rebase -i HEAD~N`
4. Validate the final result
5. Push once everything is validated

## 7. Checklist Before Pushing

- [ ] All changes are staged and committed
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventions
- [ ] Build succeeds (`mvn clean package`)
- [ ] Tests pass (`mvn test`)
- [ ] No obvious issues or incomplete work
- [ ] Related changes are grouped logically
- [ ] No debug code or temporary files
- [ ] Ready for review/deployment

## 8. Best Practices

- **Commit Often:** Make small, logical commits rather than large monolithic
  ones.
- **Review Before Committing:** Use `git diff` to review changes before staging.
- **Amend Freely Before Push:** Don't hesitate to amend commits that haven't
  been pushed yet.
- **Validate Before Push:** Always run build and tests before pushing.
- **Keep History Clean:** Use interactive rebase to clean up commit history
  before pushing.
- **One Logical Change Per Commit:** If a commit does multiple unrelated things,
  split it.
