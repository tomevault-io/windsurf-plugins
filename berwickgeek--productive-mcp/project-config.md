# CLAUDE.md

This file provides comprehensive guidance to Claude Code when working with Next.js 15 applications with React 19 and TypeScript.

## Core Development Philosophy

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

### Design Principles

- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Vertical Slice Architecture**: Organize by features, not layers
- **Component-First**: Build with reusable, composable components with single responsibility
- **Fail Fast**: Validate inputs early, throw errors immediately

## 🤖 AI Assistant Guidelines

### Context Awareness

- When implementing features, always check existing patterns first
- Prefer composition over inheritance in all designs
- Use existing utilities before creating new ones
- Check for similar functionality in other domains/features

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Creating duplicate functionality
- Overwriting existing tests
- Modifying core frameworks without explicit instruction
- Adding dependencies without checking existing alternatives

### Workflow Patterns

- Preferably create tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
- Use "think hard" for architecture decisions
- Break complex tasks into smaller, testable units
- Validate understanding before implementation

### Search Command Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Always use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of traditional `grep` and `find` commands:

```bash
# ❌ Don't use grep
grep -r "pattern" .

# ✅ Use rg instead
rg "pattern"

# ❌ Don't use find with name
find . -name "*.tsx"

# ✅ Use rg with file filtering
rg --files | rg "\.tsx$"
# or
rg --files -g "*.tsx"
```

**Enforcement Rules:**

```
(
    r"^grep\b(?!.*\|)",
    "Use 'rg' (ripgrep) instead of 'grep' for better performance and features",
),
(
    r"^find\s+\S+\s+-name\b",
    "Use 'rg --files | rg pattern' or 'rg --files -g pattern' instead of 'find -name' for better performance",
),
```

## 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity

### File and Component Limits

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If approaching this limit, refactor by splitting into modules or helper files.
- **Components should be under 200 lines** for better maintainability.
- **Functions should be short and focused sub 50 lines** and have a single responsibility.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.

## 🚀 Next.js 15 & React 19 Key Features

### Next.js 15 Core Features

- **Turbopack**: Fast bundler for development (stable)
- **App Router**: File-system based router with layouts and nested routing
- **Server Components**: React Server Components for performance
- **Server Actions**: Type-safe server functions
- **Parallel Routes**: Concurrent rendering of multiple pages
- **Intercepting Routes**: Modal-like experiences

### React 19 Features

- **React Compiler**: Eliminates need for `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo`
- **Actions**: Handle async operations with built-in pending states
- **use() API**: Simplified data fetching and context consumption
- **Document Metadata**: Native support for SEO tags
- **Enhanced Suspense**: Better loading states and error boundaries

### TypeScript Integration (MANDATORY)

- **MUST use `ReactElement` instead of `JSX.Element`** for return types
- **MUST import types from 'react'** explicitly
- **NEVER use `JSX.Element` namespace** - use React types directly

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Modern React 19 typing
import { ReactElement } from "react";

function MyComponent(): ReactElement {
  return <div>Content</div>;
}

// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Legacy JSX namespace
function MyComponent(): JSX.Element {
  // Cannot find namespace 'JSX'
  return <div>Content</div>;
}
```
