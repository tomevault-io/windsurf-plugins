# Agent Instructions

## Current Scope

- The retained product is the SvelteKit portal in `apps/portal`, plus the Eve
  agent under `apps/portal/agent` (durable chat, policy, and server-side
  execution). There is no separate backend service repo in this tree.
- Market data uses read-only public feeds plus the configured Harness edge API
  where available. Public read routes should use plain `/api/read/<routeKey>`
  APIs; auth-gated routes must be shown as gated rather than replaced with
  fake rows.
- Privy authenticates the user in the browser. Manual terminal LIVE tickets
  sign with the Privy embedded Solana wallet. Eve live agent trades use a
  separate **server-custody** wallet derived from
  `AGENT_WALLET_MASTER_SECRET` + Privy principal (see
  `docs/adr/0001-server-authoritative-trading-harness.md`). Never treat the
  two wallets as the same account in UI or copy.
- Live agent execution requires the server live-access record and an explicit
  agent-wallet ack; live Auto always parks for user approval. SOL evacuate
  from the agent wallet may only go to the Privy-linked owner address
  (`/api/agent/custody-wallet`).
- Do not add or restore Cloudflare Worker, x402, database, payment, or
  React/Next surfaces without another explicit scope change. Expanding
  custody (e.g. Privy delegated signing, program allowlists, durable PAUSE)
  is in-scope only when the order/ADR says so — do not invent a new signer
  path casually.
- Paper trading is a local simulation on live market data (perps + spot), no
  chain signing. Keep PAPER labeling obvious so it never looks live.

## Design System (packages/ui)

- `@harness-trade/ui` is a bun-workspace package consumed source-direct: the
  `"svelte"` export condition points at `src/index.ts` and there is no build
  step. Portal's `vite.config.ts` sets `ssr: { noExternal: ["@harness-trade/ui"] }`
  so the `.svelte` files are compiled by the app's Vite/Svelte pipeline.
- Entry-point invariant: server-side code (`apps/portal/src/lib/server/`,
  `routes/og/`) imports ONLY `@harness-trade/ui/tokens` or
  `@harness-trade/ui/format` (pure TS, no `.svelte`). The component barrel
  `@harness-trade/ui` and `tokens.css` are client/SSR-component territory.
- Palette single source of truth: `packages/ui/src/tokens/colors.ts` (TS,
  canonical) mirrored by hand in `packages/ui/src/tokens.css`; `colors.test.ts`
  is the drift guard (`bun run --cwd packages/ui test`).
- Palette hexes outside packages/ui: only the terminal's lightweight-charts
  theme (`apps/portal/src/routes/terminal/+page.svelte`), which must pass
  concrete strings to the charting library and mirrors `colors.ts` by hand
  (its `--chart-bg` is consumed via the imported `colors.chartBg` value), plus
  `static/brand` assets with baked accent/ink hexes. Every other surface uses
  tokens.
- Neo-brutalist layer: `--shadow-hard` / `--shadow-hard-sm` tokens and
  `--radius: 0`. Hard shadows and press mechanics (Button hover/active
  translate, 3px offset shadow; TabNav 3px underline) are marketing-surface
  only. The terminal stays flat and dense with its own hard-coded metrics
  (its radii are squared in place; circles stay 50%).
- Two formatter dialects by design: `@harness-trade/ui/format` renders "—"
  for null (marketing/OG); `apps/portal/src/lib/utils.ts` renders "--"
  (terminal). Different null/digit semantics — do not merge them.
- Scoped-style pitfall: when extracting or moving a component, move the
  `<style>` block with the markup. The build emits `unused css selector`
  warnings when a selector loses its markup and must stay at 0 — but it does
  NOT warn about markup classes that lost their styles, so check that
  direction manually.

## Hosting Org Mapping

- Vercel hosting org/team: `guivercelpro`.
- Cloudflare account/org, if a future scope change requires it: personal
  account owned by `gui.bibeau@solana.org`.
- Do not use the Solana Foundation Cloudflare org/account for this repo.

## Environment and Domains

- Production branch: `main`.
- Production domain: `harness.trade`; the legacy `traderralph.com`,
  `trader-ralph.com`, and `www.trader-ralph.com` redirect to it.
- Lower environment: `dev` branch -> `dev.trader-ralph.com` (legacy alias,
  still live — migrates with the domain cutover).
- There is no frontend requirement for an `api.` subdomain in the current
  repo shape.

## Promotion Guardrails

- Promotion flow is `feature/*` or `codex/*` -> PR preview -> `main`.
- `dev` remains available as an optional soak lane and is not a required
  promotion step.
- Vercel is the only expected hosting target for the current portal + Eve app.
- Do not manually remap custom domains outside CI unless production is degraded
  and an emergency fix is required.

## Required Validation

- Run `bun run typecheck` and `bun run build` for code changes. Root
  `bun run typecheck` chains `packages/ui` then `apps/portal`; root
  `bun run test` runs typecheck plus the `packages/ui` drift test.
- For visible UI changes, run a browser smoke check at
  `http://localhost:3000/terminal`.

## Agentic Execution Checklist

- Keep changes scoped to `apps/portal`, `packages/ui`, frontend config, or docs
  unless the user explicitly expands the repo scope.
