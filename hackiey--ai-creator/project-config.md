# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents working in this repository.

## Build & Dev Commands

```bash
pnpm install                          # Install all dependencies
pnpm build                            # Build all workspaces / check TypeScript
pnpm dev:all                          # Start server (3001) + web (5173)
pnpm dev:server                       # Backend only
pnpm dev:web                          # Web only
pnpm --filter @ai-creator/mobile dev  # Expo mobile app
```

No dedicated automated test suite is configured. Validate changes with `pnpm build`.
`apps/mobile` currently has a placeholder `build` script, so `pnpm build` is mainly useful as a TypeScript/package build check for the server, web app, and shared packages.

## Architecture

Turborepo + pnpm workspaces monorepo. Three apps and four shared packages.

Core content hierarchy: `World -> Project (Novel) -> Chapter`.
Characters and world settings live at the world level. Drafts can belong to either a world or a project.

**Apps:**
- `apps/server` — Fastify + tRPC v11 backend with MongoDB native driver. Registers `/trpc`, `POST /api/agent/chat` for SSE streaming, `POST /api/world/import-file` plus `DELETE /api/world/import-file/:fileHash` for resumable file import, and `/health`. JWT auth and permission groups control access.
- `apps/web` — React 19 + Vite + TailwindCSS v4 SPA. Uses TanStack Router with an explicit route tree in `src/router.tsx`, TanStack Query, and `i18next` (`zh-CN` + `en`). Main routes cover auth, home, world workspace, immersive writing, and admin.

- `apps/mobile` — Expo 54 + React Native 0.81 + Expo Router. Uses tRPC + TanStack Query, AsyncStorage-backed auth/config/theme state, StyleSheet-based UI, markdown rendering for assistant output, and themed rain/starfield backgrounds.

**Packages:**
- `packages/types` — Shared Zod schemas for users, permission groups, worlds, projects, characters, world settings, drafts, chapters, file imports, agent sessions, and search results.
- `packages/agent` — `CreatorAgentSession` built on `@mariozechner/pi-ai` + `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`. Exposes 19 tools across semantic search, CRUD, continuation, synopsis generation, and world/project memory. Supports locale-aware prompts/tool descriptions and model specs in `provider:modelId[/reasoning]` format.
- `packages/editor` — Reusable `CreatorEditor` TipTap package for the web writer. Includes 2s auto-save debounce, append/delete hooks, font controls, immersive mode, and CJK-aware stats.
- `packages/core` — OpenAI-compatible embedding wrapper and chunking utilities. Default chunking is 1000 characters with 200-character overlap.

## Web App Structure

- `src/router.tsx` — Route tree, auth gate, global shell, theme switching, and breadcrumb/immersive state wiring.
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` — World list and entry point after login.
- `src/pages/WorldPage.tsx` — World workspace with project strip, semantic search, character/world-setting/draft tabs, import dialog, and inline AI chat.
- `src/pages/WritePage.tsx` — Immersive project writer with `CreatorEditor`, chapter selection, diff review for conflicting edits, and floating chat/theme controls.
- `src/pages/AdminPage.tsx` — Admin-only permission-group management and user role assignment.
- `src/components/FileImportDialog.tsx` — Web UI for streaming file import progress and chunk-level tool activity.
- `src/contexts/WriteThemeContext.tsx` — Shared immersive theme/font state for the writing experience.

## Mobile App Structure

Expo Router file-based routing:
- `app/_layout.tsx` — Providers, auth guard, tRPC client wiring, theme provider, and app-level stack configuration.
- `app/(auth)/` — Login and register screens.
- `app/(tabs)/` — Home (world list) and Settings (server URL, theme, user info, logout).
- `app/world/[worldId].tsx` — World detail with project strip, search, and tabs for characters, world settings, and drafts.
- `app/project/[projectId].tsx` — Block-based mobile chapter editor with inline markdown formatting, font selection, stats, and auto-save.
- `app/chat/[worldId].tsx` — AI chat screen with streaming messages, tool-call display, session history, model picker, and memory editor.
- `components/backgrounds/` — Rain/starfield visual backgrounds driven by theme selection.
- `contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` — Mobile theme + font persistence.
- `lib/useAgentChat.ts` — React Native SSE client built on `XMLHttpRequest` because RN `fetch` does not expose a readable stream.

## Key Patterns

- **End-to-end type safety**: tRPC routers in `apps/server/src/routers/` share Zod-backed types from `packages/types` with the clients.
- **Model access control**: Available models come from `AVAILABLE_MODELS`, are filtered by permission groups, and may include optional reasoning suffixes like `openai:gpt-5.4/medium`.
- **Agent streaming + persistence**: `/api/agent/chat` streams incremental text/tool events over SSE while persisting `agent_sessions` and `agent_messages` in MongoDB.
- **Locale flow**: Web can run in Chinese or English, mobile currently ships Simplified Chinese only, and the server resolves client locales to `zh` or `en` for prompts/tool descriptions/world summaries.
