# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

claude-fsd is an automated development system that runs continuous AI agent-driven development cycles. It operates like "Tesla FSD for code" - multiple specialized AI agents (Developer, Planner, Reviewer, Tester) work together autonomously to build projects while allowing human oversight and intervention.

## Core Commands

```bash
# Main entry points
claude-fsd              # Interactive mode with guided setup
claude-fsd dev          # Jump directly to development mode
claudefsd-dev           # Main development script with intelligent loop

# Planning and setup
claudefsd-interview     # Interactive expert Q&A to gather requirements (uses opus with ultrathink)
claudefsd-create-plan   # Create development plan from interview results (uses opus with ultrathink)

# Testing and validation
./test-failure-detection.sh  # Test failure detection mechanisms
```

## Model Selection Strategy

The system uses Claude Opus throughout with strategic ultrathinking for complex work:

- **Opus + Ultrathink**: Used for complex architectural work requiring deep thinking
  - Requirements gathering (`claudefsd-interview`)
  - Architecture planning (`claudefsd-create-plan`)
  - Megathinking mode (every 4th iteration in development cycle)

- **Opus (Standard)**: Used for regular development iterations
  - Standard development tasks (iterations 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, etc.)
  - All agents (Developer, Verifier, Tester) use opus consistently

## Development Mode

The system uses an intelligent development loop that combines task planning with parallel execution:

- **Architecture**: Intelligent task selection with parallel Task agents
- **Features**: Loop-based with failure detection, megathinking every 4th iteration, adaptive execution
- **Approach**: Builds bulletproof systems while staying focused on the plan
- **Adaptability**: Automatically adjusts approach based on task complexity - can use single agent for complex sequential work or multiple parallel agents for independent tasks

### Command Line Options

```bash
claudefsd-dev [--working-dir=DIR] [--max-time=MINUTES]
```

- `--working-dir=DIR` - Directory containing BRIEF.md and PLAN.md (default: `docs`)
- `--max-time=MINUTES` - Maximum total runtime in minutes (default: `120`)

### @STOP Checkpoint Marker

Add `@STOP` on its own line in PLAN.md to create a checkpoint. When all tasks before `@STOP` are complete, the system pauses for human review, deployment, or intervention. To continue, remove or move the `@STOP` marker and restart.

Example:
```markdown
## Phase 1: Core Implementation
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Implement database models

@STOP

## Phase 2: Integration (requires Phase 1 deployment)
- [ ] Add API endpoints
- [ ] Connect to external services
```

## Architecture

### Development Loop Design (Three-Agent Flow)
Each iteration runs three specialized agents in sequence:

```
Developer (TDD) → Verifier (code review) → Tester (test execution)
```

1. **Developer Agent**: Implements tasks using TDD (test-first)
2. **Verifier Agent**: Code review only, creates git commits
3. **Tester Agent**: Runs unit tests (every iteration) + acceptance tests (every 4th)

### Key Files Structure
```
docs/
├── BRIEF.md         # Project description (preferred location)
├── PLAN.md          # Development roadmap (see structure below)
├── CLAUDE-NOTES.md  # AI architect analysis
├── QUESTIONS.md     # Clarification questions
├── IDEAS.md         # Future improvements
└── FEEDBACK.md      # Human feedback (temporary, archived after processing)
logs/                # AI session logs with timestamps
PAUSE                # Create to pause development (project root)
```

### PLAN.md Required Structure
```markdown
## Tasks
- [ ] Task description here
- [ ] Another task

## Test Infrastructure
<!-- Required - Tester uses these commands -->
- Unit tests: `pytest tests/`
- Lint: `ruff check .`
- Type check: `mypy src/`
- Acceptance: `playwright test`

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Tester checks every 4th iteration -->
- [ ] Feature X works end-to-end
- [ ] API returns correct data
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
```

### Human Intervention

**PAUSE file**: Create `PAUSE` in project root to pause the loop. Remove to resume.
```bash
touch PAUSE    # Pause development
rm PAUSE       # Resume development
```

**FEEDBACK.md**: Add urgent feedback for the next iteration.
- Create `docs/FEEDBACK.md` with instructions/corrections
- Developer reads it as HIGH PRIORITY
- Archived to `logs/` after processing

### Failure Detection System
- Monitors iteration timing (minimum 5 minutes expected)
- Tracks consecutive fast iterations (< 5 minutes)
- Exits after 3 consecutive fast iterations (indicates API throttling)
- Implements exponential backoff delays

## Development Workflow

### Loop Mechanics in claudefsd-dev
1. **Developer Phase**: TDD - write test first, then implementation
2. **Verifier Phase**: Code review, cheating detection, git commit
3. **Tester Phase**: Run unit tests, check acceptance criteria (every 4th)
4. **Human Check**: Process PAUSE file, archive FEEDBACK.md
