# functional.js Development Rules

## Code Style

- Use data-last parameter order for all utilities
- Prefer `pipe` for immediate evaluation and `flow` for reusable pipelines
- Keep functions pure and avoid mutation
- Prefer point-free style when it improves readability
- Use 4-space indentation and double quotes

## TypeScript

- Prefer inference, add types only when needed
- Keep callback types implicit unless inference fails
- Avoid explicit types for intermediate values

## Imports

- Named imports only: `import { pipe, map, filter } from "functional.js"`
- Use grouped imports by category when practical

## Common Mistakes To Avoid

- Do not pass data as the last argument to `pipe`
- Avoid mutating inputs inside callbacks
- Do not add explicit types to callbacks unless inference fails

## Common Patterns

- Use `pipe` for data-first pipelines
- Use `flow` to build reusable pipelines
- Curry custom utilities for consistency

## Testing

- Test both curried and uncurried usage
- Verify type inference in test files
- Ensure inputs are not mutated
- Prefer vitest-style assertions and suites

## Examples

- Keep examples self-contained and copy-paste ready
- Use realistic data and small datasets
