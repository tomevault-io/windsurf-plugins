# CLAUDE.md: GRAIN monorepo

## What this is

The Bun-workspace monorepo for the **GRAIN family**: four published layers that build on each other,
plus a workspace-only MCP server over their built output, each its own package, no build step,
everything runs on Bun straight from TypeScript. An app can adopt just the design system or the
whole stack.

| Package | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`@tjakoen/grain`](packages/grain) | The AI-interaction design system + default theme. Every surface is operable by a human or an AI through one shared vocabulary, with the AI's presence shown as a visible signal (grain = AI). |
| [`@tjakoen/mill`](packages/mill) | Markdown In, Living Layouts. A Markdown to GRAIN-pages CMS. |
| [`@tjakoen/proof`](packages/proof) | The AI plan board. Plans are markdown; the board is a live projection that never writes back. |
| [`@tjakoen/crumb`](packages/crumb) | The guided-tour, demo-mode, and AI-review layer. Published and live on tjakoen.github.io. |

**Dependency direction runs one way:** a substrate (BATCH is the reference) sits below grain, mill
builds on grain, proof builds on mill, crumb builds on grain and mill. grain imports nothing from
the substrate except one port. Never reach across or upward; add a port instead.

**Each package carries its own `CLAUDE.md` and `PLAN.md`** with that layer's rules, non-negotiables,
and hard-won lessons. Working inside a layer? Read its file first. This root file is the workspace
front door.

## How I work here (non-negotiables)

The full rulebook is [`AI-DEVELOPMENT.md`](https://tjakoen.github.io/standards/ai-development) plus
[`SESSION-LOOP.md`](https://tjakoen.github.io/standards/session-loop) (session mechanics, memory,
handoff, model economy). The short version:

- **I build with AI, out loud, on purpose.** Co-authored with Claude as a practice, not a git
  trailer. No `Co-Authored-By` lines. The receipt is the README badge and the flagship note.
- **AI multiplies, it doesn't add.** The AI types; I engineer. If I can't explain it, I didn't
  build it.
- **One vocabulary, one door.** Surfaces and verbs live in the contract; reference the registry,
  never magic strings. No privileged AI-to-DOM back channel.
- **Tokens only:** no hardcoded colors; components read semantic tokens. Re-skin by overriding
  tokens, never editing components.
- **Definition of done = code + the right test tier + docs synced + `tsc` and `bun test` green +
  a memory if a decision was made.** All of them.
- **Hand off when a task finishes** (SESSION-LOOP §5).

## Commands

```bash
bun install     # one root install, one lockfile
bun run check   # tsc across every package (must stay green)
bun run test    # bun test across every package
```

Each package also carries its own `check` and `test` scripts; run them when working in one layer.

## Voice (for any prose in my name)

Follow [VOICE.md](https://tjakoen.github.io/standards/voice): honest, concrete,
opinionated-with-the-why; no backticks in prose; no em-dashes; money stays vague. Any published
docs or design copy also follow [FIGURES.md](https://tjakoen.github.io/standards/figures) for
diagrams and charts.

## README presentation

Follow [README-STANDARD.md](https://tjakoen.github.io/standards/readme-standard). The README already
carries the curated badge row led by the `Made with Claude` badge and the text footer; keep it that
way.

## Commit convention

No AI attribution trailers on commits (`Co-Authored-By: Claude` etc.). The receipt is the README
badge and footer and the flagship note, not commit metadata.

## Docs / structure

`packages/{grain,mill,proof,crumb,grain-mcp}`. grain, mill and proof each carry a `CLAUDE.md` and a
`PLAN.md`, crumb carries a `PLAN.md`, and grain-mcp carries only its README. Consuming a layer in
another app: see the README (published on npmjs — a version range, no `.npmrc`, no token) and
[how to consume a layer](https://github.com/tjakoen/tjakoen.github.io/blob/main/docs/batch/CONSUME-AS-GIT-DEPS.md).

## Evidence: where a run lands its findings (LOOP section 4a)

A run closes with a report in `artifacts/runs/`, one file per run, `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`. Gate output
pasted verbatim rather than summarized, what was **not** done named, and what needs human eyes named
separately. The README in that directory carries the frontmatter shape and explains why the directory
came before the checks did. A claim of "verified" with no report attached is treated as unverified.

Plans live in `plans/`, one file per plan, claimed before the editing starts rather than after.

## Running the gates

The gates run in a container rather than against whatever is installed on the host, driven from
the bread repo checked out beside this one, which holds the compose file:

```sh
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose --profile gates run --rm gates-grain
```

It installs from the frozen lockfile, then runs the typecheck, the tests and the linter. The
