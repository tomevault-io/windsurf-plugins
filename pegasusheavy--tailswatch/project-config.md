# Commit After Work

After completing a task or set of changes, always commit the work to git with a descriptive commit message.

## Guidelines

1. **When to commit**: After finishing any task, feature, bug fix, or meaningful set of changes
2. **Commit message format**: Use conventional commit format when appropriate:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `style:` for formatting/styling changes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
3. **Commit scope**: Group related changes together in a single commit
4. **Don't forget**: Stage all relevant files before committing

## Example

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add scrollable side navigation"
```
