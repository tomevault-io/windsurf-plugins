# Nix Configuration

This repo contains all machine setup and configuration since this is a NixOS system - system packages, services, dotfiles, and home-manager config are all declared here. Sometimes they are suffixed with a .hbs (use `*.ext*` glob to match both).

Assume this config is the configuration for all machines we discuss, unless I say otherwise.

Use the `.justfile` for common tasks and commands.


Changes in `./flake`: run `just switch` after making changes to directly deploy changes (builds and activates the new configuration). Only skip this if the change is particularly dangerous, but home dir changes are fine.
Changes in `./out-of-store-config`: no need to run `just switch` changes are picked up immediately after re-launching the affected program  

To edit my dot files in `~/` they are actually symlinked from `flake/modules/home-manager/shared/headless/dot-files.nix` so search there. 

We prefer keeping them as text files on disk with handlebar templating when needed.

When adding new persistence directories/files for impermanence, they need to be added in:
- `flake/modules/system/nixos/headless/impermanence.nix`

If build fails with "Path X already exists", move conflicting files to persistence first:
`sudo mkdir -p /persistent/home/$USER/<folder>; sudo mv /home/$USER/<file> /persistent/home/$USER/<folder>/; sudo chown -R $USER:users /persistent/home/$USER/<folder>`

To debug scripts in `flake/modules/home-manager/dot-files/Scripts/`, run them directly from the repo rather than from `~/Scripts/`.

my aliases are in my zshrc file

Custom hapi fork lives at `~/code/hapi/richard-custom`. Run `~/code/hapi/richard-custom/scripts/build-local.sh` to rebuild the binary. It's on PATH (via `bun-linux-x64-baseline` dir) in `flake/modules/home-manager/nixos/headless/home.nix`.
