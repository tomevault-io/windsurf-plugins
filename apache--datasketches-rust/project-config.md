# Repository instructions for agents

Before planning or modifying this repository, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) in full and treat its build, test, integration-test layout, and serialization snapshot guidance as repository requirements.

For test changes, pay particular attention to the "Integration test layout" and "Serialization snapshots" sections. Keep the documented workflow synchronized with structural changes, and run the applicable `cargo x check`, `cargo x test`, and `cargo x lint` commands before handing work back.

For every change, follow the [changelog guidance](CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog) in `CONTRIBUTING.md` as the single source of truth.
