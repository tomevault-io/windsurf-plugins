# Omarchy Arcade

- One repository, one native app window, one desktop entry and one package/release. Keep games as ordinary subdirectories.
- Use Rust for new application code. Preserve the upstream C++ Pinball engine and approved artwork. Do not replace existing games with simplified rewrites.
- Existing save locations and character/deck choices must survive upgrades. Never delete user data during installation.
- Preserve imported history and per-game licences. Record material integration choices in DECISIONS.md.
- Use a feature branch and reviewable commits. Check workspace fmt, Clippy, game tests, native switching and packaging; report headless evidence separately from Omarchy desktop acceptance.
