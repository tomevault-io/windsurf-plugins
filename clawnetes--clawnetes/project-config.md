# AGENTS.md

This is an instruction file for AI coding agents (OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Gemini)

## Clarifications

If the request is not clear, or is ambigious, ask for clarifications before making changes to code.

## Stability

When asked to do one thing, make code changes ONLY related to that thing. If something else needs to change along with it, be upfront and ASK about it before making the change.

Whenever changing code, take extra care that code addition or removal does not break working functionality.

## Planning

Always make a thorough plan and write it to file. Also track progress on file.

## Test driven development

When adding feautures, always add extensise unit tests.

## Running tests

After implementing a feature, or making code changes, always run tests.
Fix test failures. Do not stop until all tests pass.

## Validating work

Always run `npm run tauri dev` after making code change. If there are issues, fix them based on the output.
Do NOT stop working until all issues are addressed.

## Commiting

ALWAYS ask before commiting changes to git and pushing to remote branch.
