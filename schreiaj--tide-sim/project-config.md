This project uses UV for package management and running

instead of using pip directly you can do `uv add package-name`

you can also use `uv run python_file.py`

as well as `uv run pytest` to run tests


As a general rule of thumb we like to adhere by the DRY principle.  If you can find common abstractions that will improve clarity and testability then that refactor is likely worth it.
