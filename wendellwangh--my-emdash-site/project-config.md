This is an EmDash site -- a CMS built on Astro with a full admin UI.

## Commands

```bash
npx emdash dev        # Start dev server (runs migrations, seeds, generates types)
npx emdash types      # Regenerate TypeScript types from schema
```

The admin UI is at `http://localhost:4321/_emdash/admin`.

## Key Files

| File                     | Purpose                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `astro.config.mjs`       | Astro config with `emdash()` integration, database, and storage                    |
| `src/live.config.ts`     | EmDash loader registration (boilerplate -- don't modify)                           |
| `seed/seed.json`         | Schema definition + demo content (collections, fields, taxonomies, menus, widgets) |
| `emdash-env.d.ts`        | Generated types for collections (auto-regenerated on dev server start)             |
| `src/layouts/Base.astro` | Base layout with EmDash wiring (menus, search, page contributions)                 |
| `src/pages/`             | Astro pages -- all server-rendered                                                 |

## Skills

Agent skills are in `.agents/skills/`. Load them when working on specific tasks:

- **building-emdash-site** -- Querying content, rendering Portable Text, schema design, seed files, site features (menus, widgets, search, SEO, comments, bylines). Start here.
- **creating-plugins** -- Building EmDash plugins with hooks, storage, admin UI, API routes, and Portable Text block types.
- **emdash-cli** -- CLI commands for content management, seeding, type generation, and visual editing flow.

## Documentation

The EmDash docs are available as an MCP server at `https://docs.emdashcms.com/mcp`. When you need to verify an API, hook, config option, field type, or pattern, call `search_docs` against the live documentation rather than relying on training-data recall. The docs reflect current behaviour; assumptions may not.

This template ships with `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, and `.vscode/mcp.json` so Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code auto-discover the docs server. Other tools (OpenCode, Windsurf, etc.) need a manual one-time setup -- see [docs.emdashcms.com/docs-mcp](https://docs.emdashcms.com/docs-mcp).

## Rules

- All content pages must be server-rendered (`output: "server"`). No `getStaticPaths()` for CMS content.
- Image fields are objects (`{ src, alt }`), not strings. Use `<Image image={...} />` from `"emdash/ui"`.
- `entry.id` is the slug (for URLs). `entry.data.id` is the database ULID (for API calls like `getEntryTerms`).
- Always call `Astro.cache.set(cacheHint)` on pages that query content.
- Taxonomy names in queries must match the seed's `"name"` field exactly (e.g., `"category"` not `"categories"`).

## This Template

A blog with posts, pages, categories, tags, full-text search, and RSS. Designed for personal writing, technical writing, indie newsletters, and anything where the writing is the product. Editorial-tech aesthetic: confident sans-serif, restrained accent, real article structure with bylines and reading time.

## Pages

| Page        | Path               | What it shows                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| All posts   | `/posts`           | Article count, full post list with excerpts and tag chips                                              |
| Post detail | `/posts/[slug]`    | Featured image, title, body, left meta column (authors + date), right TOC + search + categories gutter |
| Search      | `/search`          | Full-text search UI                                                                                    |
| Page        | `/pages/[slug]`    | Static page content (Portable Text)                                                                    |
| Category    | `/category/[slug]` | Posts filtered by category                                                                             |
| Tag         | `/tag/[slug]`      | Posts filtered by tag                                                                                  |
| RSS         | `/rss.xml`         | Generated feed                                                                                         |

## Schema

- `posts` collection: `title`, `featured_image`, `content` (Portable Text), `excerpt` (text).
- `pages` collection: `title`, `content` (Portable Text). Used for `/about` etc.
- Taxonomies: `category`, `tag`.
- Single `primary` menu (Home, About, Posts by default).

Site settings have `title` and `tagline` -- both render in the header / footer.
