# Agentic-stack brain

This project uses a portable brain in `.agent/`. Treat it as authoritative.

## Before acting
1. Read `.agent/AGENTS.md` (the map).
2. Read `.agent/memory/personal/PREFERENCES.md` (how the user works).
3. Read `.agent/memory/semantic/LESSONS.md` (what we've learned).
4. Read `.agent/protocols/permissions.md` (what you can and cannot do).

## Recall before acting
For any task involving deploy, ship, release, migration, schema change,
timestamp / timezone / date, failing test, debug, investigate, or refactor,
FIRST run:

```bash
python3 .agent/tools/recall.py "<short description of the task>"
```

If it surfaces lessons, show them in a `Consulted lessons before acting:`
block and obey them. Without this, graduated lessons stay invisible and the
brain stops compounding.

## While working
- Check `.agent/skills/_index.md`; load full skills only when triggers match.
- Update `.agent/memory/working/WORKSPACE.md` as the task evolves.
- After significant actions, run:
  `python3 .agent/tools/memory_reflect.py <skill> <action> <outcome>`
- Quick state: `python3 .agent/tools/show.py`.
- Teach a rule in one shot:
  `python3 .agent/tools/learn.py "<rule>" --rationale "<why>"`.

## Hard rules
- Never force push to protected branches.
- Never delete memory entries; archive only.
- Never modify `.agent/protocols/permissions.md`.
