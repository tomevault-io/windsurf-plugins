# Basecamp CLI Development Context

## Getting Started

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build setup, testing, and PR workflow.

The standard development loop in this repo: make changes, run `bin/ci`, fix
what it catches, repeat until green, then push. Treat `bin/ci` as your
inner-loop companion, not a final hurdle.

## Basecamp API Reference

API documentation: https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api

Key endpoints used by the CLI:
- `/projects.json` - List projects
- `/buckets/{id}/todolists/{id}/todos.json` - Todos in a list
- `/buckets/{id}/todos/{id}/completion.json` - Complete todo
- `/people.json` - List people
- `/my/profile.json` - Current user

**Search:** Use `basecamp search "query"` for full-text search across projects. The Recordings API (`basecamp recordings`) is for browsing by type/status without a search term.

## Testing

`bin/ci` is the local CI gate. It runs every check that remote CI runs:
formatting, vetting, linting, unit tests, e2e tests, naming conventions,
CLI surface snapshots, skill drift detection, SDK provenance, and go mod tidy.
Run it early and often — after finishing a feature, after fixing a bug, before
pushing. If you're about to `git push` and haven't run `bin/ci` in this
session, stop and run it first.

**Skill drift**: when you change CLI commands or flags, `check-skill-drift`
verifies that `skills/basecamp/SKILL.md` still references valid commands and
flags from the `.surface` snapshot. If you add, rename, or remove commands/flags,
update the skill to match.

```bash
bin/ci                # The single command — run this
```

When iterating on a specific area, use targeted make targets for faster
feedback, then finish with `bin/ci` before pushing:

```bash
make build            # Build binary to ./bin/basecamp
make test             # Go unit tests
make test-e2e         # BATS end-to-end tests
make lint             # Linter
make check            # All checks (what bin/ci runs)
```

Requirements: Go 1.26+, [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for e2e tests.

## OAuth Development

For local development against BC3:
```bash
BASECAMP_BASE_URL=http://3.basecamp.localhost:3001 basecamp auth login
```

OAuth endpoints are discovered via `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.

## Benchmarks

```bash
make bench            # Run all benchmarks
make bench-cpu        # Run with CPU profiling
make bench-mem        # Run with memory profiling
make bench-save       # Save baseline for comparison
make bench-compare    # Compare against baseline
```

## SDK Sync

The CLI depends on the Basecamp SDK (`github.com/basecamp/basecamp-sdk/go`). When the
SDK adds new API operations, the CLI must add corresponding commands.

**Tracking**: `internal/version/sdk-provenance.json` records the SDK version +
API revision the CLI is built against. `API-COVERAGE.md` tracks endpoint coverage.

**Workflow** (see also `.claude/skills/sdk-bump.md`):
1. `make bump-sdk` — updates go.mod + provenance (never edit go.mod directly)
2. `go build ./...` — detect breaking changes
3. Fix any compilation errors in `internal/commands/` and `internal/sdk/`
4. Check for new SDK services/methods → create corresponding CLI commands
5. `make test` — verify all pass including catalog parity
6. Update `API-COVERAGE.md` with new endpoint coverage

**Completeness bar**: every new SDK service method needs:
- Command file in `internal/commands/`
- Catalog entry in `commands.go`
- Registration in `root.go` + `commands_test.go`
- API-COVERAGE.md row

**Andon cord**: if the SDK lacks a Go service wrapper for a generated endpoint,
stop and open an issue on [basecamp-sdk](https://github.com/basecamp/basecamp-sdk) —
never call the raw generated client from CLI code.
