## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.

## Verify before publishing agent-walk claims

When a subagent (`Agent(Explore, …)` walk, or any out-of-band
investigation) returns claims with **specific file paths or line
numbers**, do **not** copy those claims into reports, ADRs, or PR
descriptions without first opening the named files yourself.

Specific claims look authoritative; that does not make them correct.
A walk in this repo has produced false claims like *"struct X is
separate per engine"* (when the struct was already shared), *"function
Y exists twice"* (defined once as a method on a shared struct),
*"callers check Z() before each emission"* (when the dispatcher
already centralised the check). Each of these was a `grep` away from
falsification but landed in an HTML architecture report unverified.

Process rule: **for any specific structural claim** (file path, line
number, "exists twice", "duplicated across N callers") **the next
tool call after the walk's report is a `Read` / graph query on the
named site**. Only then write the claim into a deliverable.

The grep is cheap. The wrong claim in a report wastes a future
contributor's day chasing a smell that does not exist.

## Remediation hints must recover from the degraded state

When emitting a fix-it suggestion — a `cast_sql`, a repair query, a
"run this to recover" hint — verify it actually works **from the
already-degraded state**, not from the original value. If the
degradation is lossy (integer overflow, truncation, a naive-vs-instant
timestamp ambiguity, a dropped logical type) no post-hoc cast can
recover it: the only valid remediation is upstream (a declared load
schema / target-native column), and the hint must say exactly that —
never a SELECT-time cast that silently runs on corrupted data.

This bit the target resolver (`src/types/target.rs`): a `UINT64`
column was given `cast_sql = CAST(col AS NUMERIC)`, but once it
autoloads as `INT64` it has already overflowed, so the cast recovers
nothing. The fix: `cast_sql` is `Some(..)` **only** when the autoloaded
value still holds the information losslessly (JSON bytes → `PARSE_JSON`,
UUID bytes → `TO_HEX`); for overflow (`UINT64`) and naive-timestamp the
value is gone at autoload, so `cast_sql` is `None` and the note points
to the load schema.

Process rule: **every lossy degradation that surfaces a remediation
gets a regression edge-case test** asserting the recovery is real — a
post-load cast only where it is lossless, otherwise `None` + an
upstream (load-schema) note, and never a silent no-op. When self-review
catches a bug of this shape, add the edge-case test alongside the fix,
not just the fix.
