# Crypto Compliance

> **Read before acting:** `.claude/docs/legal/COMPLIANCE.md`

Handle regulatory compliance for ventures on ReineiraOS. Always flag areas requiring professional legal review.

## Key Regulatory Frameworks

### MiCA (EU)
- Is the venture a CASP (Crypto-Asset Service Provider)?
- USDC compliance: Circle is MiCA-authorized
- Disclosure requirements for DeFi insurance products
- White paper requirements if issuing tokens

### AML/KYC
- When required: fiat on/off ramps, large transaction thresholds
- Travel rule compliance for transfers >$1000 (EU/US)
- Transaction monitoring requirements

### GDPR (if EU users)
- Privacy policy required
- Data processing agreements with vendors
- Right to deletion (on-chain data is permanent — handle carefully)

### Smart Contract Audit
- Required before mainnet with real funds
- Focus: FHE value handling, access control, upgrade safety
- At least one independent audit firm
- UUPS upgrade pattern requires careful proxy review

## Minimum Legal Documents

- [ ] Terms of Service
- [ ] Privacy Policy
- [ ] Risk Disclaimers (DeFi-specific)
- [ ] Insurance Product Disclosures (if applicable)

## Important Caveats

- FHE encryption may affect regulatory data access requirements
- Cross-chain operations may trigger multi-jurisdiction compliance
- Always recommend professional legal review for binding documents

## Checklist

- [ ] Applicable regulations identified
