## CI and automated review workflow

- When addressing CI and automated review feedback, start fixing each issue as soon as it appears; do not wait for every bot or check to finish before making progress. Accumulate and resolve feedback locally as it arrives, but do not push after every individual fix. Batch multiple fixes from the same review cycle into a single push whenever practical. Push when a meaningful batch of fixes is ready, when the current round of major feedback has been addressed, or when a new push is actually required to obtain further feedback. Avoid frequent small pushes that unnecessarily retrigger CI, CodeRabbit, and other automated review cycles.

- Treat CI and automated review feedback as engineering input that requires independent judgment. Evaluate each comment against the code context, actual behavior, test results, and the goal of the change. Do not assume every automated comment must be accepted, and do not repeatedly modify code solely to make every bot report no issues at the same time. Prioritize real functional defects, regressions, security concerns, failing tests, and well-supported engineering issues. It is acceptable to leave code unchanged for purely stylistic preferences, low-impact suggestions, duplicate or conflicting feedback, or changes whose benefit does not justify the churn or regression risk. Do not use “all bots have no comments” as the completion criterion. Stop iterating once the PR goal is satisfied, material issues are resolved, relevant tests pass, and the remaining feedback does not materially affect correctness, stability, or maintainability.
