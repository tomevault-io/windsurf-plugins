# Global Guiding Principles & Preferences

## Guiding Principles
1. Observability: add excessive logging
2. Micro-milestones: perform work in commit-sized chunks. Optimize for rewinding.

## Package Managers
 Default to `pip` for backend unless otherwise specified

## Prefered Libraries
## Preferred Libraries for frontend
- Testing: `vitest` 
- Formatting/Linting: `Ruff`

## Preferred Libraries for backend
- Testing: `pytest` 
- Formatting/Linting: `Ruff`


## Running Terminal Commands
**Important:** Avoid newline characters within single arguments or strings passed to the terminal tool, as they can cause parsing issues.



## Git
- AVOID --no-verify
- Never push a failing test to the repo

## Project and Config Initialization
Use popular CLIs for creating projects and configurations whenever possible.

Examples: 
- conda create --name <your_env_name> python=3.11
- conda activate <your_env_name>
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- uvicorn main:app --reload
