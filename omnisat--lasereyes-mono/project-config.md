# Project Rules for `@omnisat/lasereyes-react`

This document outlines the guidelines and standards for contributing to the `@omnisat/lasereyes-react` package. Following these rules will ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality throughout the React-specific implementation.

## 🌟 Overview

`@omnisat/lasereyes-react` is a React-specific package built on top of `@omnisat/lasereyes-core`. It provides React hooks, context providers, and wallet icon components to make it easy to integrate Bitcoin wallet support into React applications.

## 📋 General Code Guidelines

1. **React + TypeScript**: All components must be written in TypeScript with proper type definitions.
2. **Functional Components**: Use functional components with hooks, not class components.
3. **ESLint & Prettier**: All code must pass ESLint checks and follow the project's Prettier configuration.
4. **No `any` Types**: Avoid using `any` type. Use proper typing or `unknown` when necessary.
5. **Documentation**: All components, hooks, and utilities must be properly documented with JSDoc comments.
6. **Performance**: Consider React rendering optimization techniques where appropriate.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

1. **Module Organization**:
   - `/lib/providers`: React context providers and hooks
   - `/lib/icons`: Wallet icon components
   - `/lib/utils`: React-specific utilities
   
2. **Exports**:
   - Export only what's necessary in `index.ts`
   - Keep internal utilities and components private

## 📐 Architecture Guidelines

1. **Context Provider Pattern**:
   - Use React Context for state management
   - Provide a clean provider interface with `LaserEyesProvider`
   - Keep provider implementation details hidden from consumers

2. **Hook Implementation**:
   - Create custom hooks that encapsulate wallet functionality
   - Follow React hooks naming convention (`use*`)
   - Make hooks composition-friendly

3. **Core Integration**:
   - Maintain a clean separation between React components and core functionality
   - Use the core API through properly typed interfaces
   - Don't duplicate core logic in React components

## 🎨 UI Component Guidelines

1. **Icon Components**:
   - All wallet icons should be implemented as React components
   - Support size and color customization via props
   - Implement proper accessibility attributes

2. **Component Props**:
   - Use proper TypeScript interfaces for component props
   - Include default values for optional props
   - Extend from standard HTML element props where appropriate

3. **Styling**:
   - Keep components unstyled or minimally styled by default
   - Allow style customization via className props
   - Avoid direct styling dependencies (like styled-components)

## 🔄 State Management

1. **Context Usage**:
   - Use React Context to provide wallet state
   - Memoize context values to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Structure context to allow for partial state updates

2. **NanoStores Integration**:
   - Properly integrate with nanostores from the core package
   - Use `useStore` hook from `@nanostores/react` for efficient state access
   - Implement batched updates for performance

## 🪝 Hook Guidelines

1. **`useLaserEyes` Hook**:
   - Make the main hook intuitive and easy to use
   - Support TypeScript inference for hook return values
   - Allow for selective state access to prevent unnecessary re-renders

2. **Hook Responsibilities**:
   - Each hook should have a single responsibility
   - Hooks should compose well with other hooks
   - Document hook dependencies and side effects

## 🧪 Testing Standards

1. **Component Tests**:
   - Test all React components with React Testing Library
   - Focus on testing component behavior, not implementation details
   - Mock context providers for isolated component testing

2. **Hook Tests**:
   - Test custom hooks with renderHook
   - Verify hook behavior with different inputs
   - Test edge cases and error handling

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Component Development**:
   - Develop components in isolation first
   - Then integrate with actual wallet functionality
   - Document component usage examples with code samples
   - Test components in a real application environment

## 📦 Package Management

1. **Dependencies**:
   - Keep React dependencies as peer dependencies
   - Keep bundle size minimal
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies

2. **Versioning**:
   - Sync versions with the core package
   - Document breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md

## 🔒 Framework Compatibility

1. **React Versions**:
   - Support the last two major versions of React
   - Test with different React versions
   - Document minimum required React version

2. **Next.js Support**:
   - Ensure compatibility with Next.js (both Pages and App Router)
   - Include `'use client'` directives where needed
   - Test with both client and server components

## 📃 Documentation Requirements

1. **API Documentation**:
   - Document all hooks, components, and context providers
   - Include TypeScript types in documentation
   - Provide usage examples for each hook and component

2. **README**:
