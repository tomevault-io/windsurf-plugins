# Mayara Server

Mayara Server is the reference implementation of a [Signal K](https://signalk.org/) radar API server. 

Key components:

- **Core server**: Express-based HTTP/WebSocket server (Rust and JS for the GUI)

## Code Quality Principles

### Scope and Complexity

Follow YAGNI, SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles. Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused.

Do not add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked. A bug fix does not need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature does not need extra configurability.

Do not add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that cannot happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs).

### General Standards

- Write self-documenting code; comments explain "why", not "what" - no echo comments restating what the code already says
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Handle errors explicitly at system boundaries
- No magic numbers; use named constants
- Documentation describes current state, not development history - avoid changelog-style language that will become stale
- Prefer minimal visibility: use `pub(crate)` or private over `pub` unless the item is part of the public API

### Type Safety

- Validate external inputs at system boundaries
- Prefer immutable data structures where practical

### Testing

- All new code requires tests
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Unit tests for business logic; integration tests for boundaries
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not arbitrary percentages

## Git Commit Conventions

Use conventional format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` where type = feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore|perf|ci. Subject: 50 chars max, imperative mood ("add" not "added"), no period. For small changes: one-line commit only. For complex changes: add body explaining what/why (72-char lines) and reference issues.

Keep commits small and atomic - one logical change per commit. Split unrelated changes into separate commits. The commit history tells a story; each commit should be a meaningful, self-contained step.

**DO NOT** edit CHANGELOG.md — it is auto-generated from conventional commits at release time by git-cliff.
**MANDATORY:** Never amend commits that have already been pushed to GitHub. Only amend local, unpushed commits.
**MANDATORY:** Always rebase and clean up commit history before creating a PR or pushing changes. Amend fixes and corrections to the relevant existing commit instead of creating chains of "fix typo" or "oops" commits. The final history should contain only intentional, complete commits - no work-in-progress artifacts.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before opening a PR:

- Branch from latest `main`
- Run `cargo test` - all tests must pass
- Optionally, if `cr` (CodeRabbit CLI) is available, run `cr review --plain` against your branch to catch findings before pushing. This is good practice for non-trivial code changes but not required — CodeRabbit runs on every PR automatically via the GitHub App, so the findings arrive either way. Skip it for docs-only PRs, formatting fixes, or one-liners.
- Rebase and clean up commit history (squash intermediate commits)
- Self-review your changes
- **NEVER change version numbers** - maintainers will update versions when publishing releases

PR titles are used to auto-generate the changelog and release notes. They **must** follow the same conventional commit format as commits: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (e.g., `feat(furuno): add guard zone support`). With squash merge, the PR title becomes the commit message on `main`, so it directly becomes the changelog entry. Make them **descriptive, informative, and easy to understand**. Ask yourself: "If someone only read the title, would they understand what this PR does?"

PR descriptions must be **succinct and straight to the point**. Explain the motivation (why) and summarize the solution approach (how), but not the mechanics (what) - the diff shows what changed. Do not pad descriptions with unnecessary detail, verbose explanations, or self-congratulatory comments. If there are breaking changes, mention them explicitly. If a PR description includes a test plan with checkboxes, **all items must be checked** before the PR is ready for review - remove or complete any unchecked items.

When referencing issues, use `closes`, `fixes`, or `resolves` followed by the issue number (e.g., "closes #18", "fixes #21 and resolves #23").

**MANDATORY:** One logical change per PR. Refactoring and behavior changes belong in separate PRs. If changes would result in multiple changelog entries, they should be separate PRs. Even if you have made multiple changes together locally, split them into separate PRs.
