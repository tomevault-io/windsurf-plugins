description: Project-wide engineering principles for this repo
---


### **Step-by-step delivery**
- **Backend first**, then frontend once the backend compiles, runs, and basic checks are green.
- After any backend edit: build + run smoke checks before moving on.

### **Never over-engineer**
- Prefer the simplest viable approach. If complexity is necessary, call it out and get approval first.

### **Minimal dependencies**
- Avoid adding deps unless justified. If a new dep is truly needed, pause and request confirmation first.

### **Critical file creation protocol**
- Before creating any file: list target folder, search repo for similar names, check related folders/imports, and prefer editing existing files.
- Ask for explicit confirmation when in doubt.

### **Code style**
- Naming: descriptive, full words, clear intent. No 1–2 letter identifiers.
- Control flow: early returns, handle edge/error cases first, shallow nesting.
- Errors: do not swallow exceptions; return meaningful responses.
- Comments: explain “why”, not “how”. Keep code self-explanatory.
- Formatting: match local style; avoid large unrelated refactors.

### **Testing/build hygiene**
- After edits: run build/lint/tests where applicable. Keep CI green.

### **Vertical-slice architecture**
- Backend and frontend both follow vertical slices: group related UI, data hooks, types, and API calls by feature, not by layer.
- Keep orchestration thin at the edges (controllers/pages); put logic where it belongs (handlers/hooks/services).
