# TaskNotes app

Read `PRODUCT.md` and `DESIGN.md` before changing user-facing behaviour or
visuals. The application is web-first and packaged for Android and iOS through
Capacitor.

All durable collection access goes through the provider-neutral mdbase
`TaskRepository`. UI and application code must not branch on hosted versus
connected-computer storage. TaskNotes does not open device folders and does not
maintain an IndexedDB task replica; IndexedDB is permitted only for bounded
application state such as a delayed deletion's undo window.
