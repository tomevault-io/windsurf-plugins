# AI Token Meter Development Guide

## Project Shape

- This is a native macOS menu bar app built directly with `swiftc`.
- The app entrypoint lives in `Sources/CodexTokenMeter/main.swift`; supporting code is split into focused files under the same directory.
- The companion Task Bar app lives in `Sources/CodexPetBar/main.swift` and is part of the same product family, not a separate design surface.
- `build.sh` compiles every Swift file under `Sources/CodexTokenMeter`, so future file splits do not need build-script changes.
- Prefer small, behavior-preserving changes unless you are explicitly doing a planned refactor.
- Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before changing parser, quota, cost, or UI behavior.

## Build And Verification

- Compile check: `./build.sh`
- CLI parser check: `"./build/AI Token Meter.app/Contents/MacOS/CodexTokenMeter" --print --window=week --quota=all`
- Live quota check: `"./build/AI Token Meter.app/Contents/MacOS/CodexTokenMeter" --print-live`
- Service-status check: `"./build/AI Token Meter.app/Contents/MacOS/CodexTokenMeter" --print-service-status`
- Dashboard render check for UI changes: `"./build/AI Token Meter.app/Contents/MacOS/CodexTokenMeter" --render-dashboard=/tmp/ai-token-meter-dashboard.png`

`--print-live`, `--print-profile`, `--print-service-status`, and dashboard rendering can depend on Codex login state or network availability. Do not treat their unavailability as a compile regression unless the failure is caused by local code.

## Git Workflow

- Prefer merging changes through pull requests. Do not merge directly into `main` unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- All source, behavior, or UI changes must use this sequence: a focused branch → PR → merged `main` → fetch `origin/main` → build and install from that exact merged revision. Do not install an unmerged working-tree build as the delivered app.
- Before calling a change complete, verify the PR merge, confirm local `HEAD` equals `origin/main`, then run the relevant checks and validate the installed `/Applications/AI Token Meter.app` surface.

## AI Token Meter Test Loop

- The user has granted standing authorization for the current local AI Token Meter test loop. After an AI Token Meter bug or UI fix passes `./build.sh` and its relevant render or interaction checks, automatically preserve the current `/Applications/AI Token Meter.app` at a timestamped `.pretest-*` path, install the new test build at the original path, launch it, and verify the running path, executable hash, build metadata, strict code signature, and installed UI surface. Do not wait for a separate “install test build” command on each iteration.
- This is a recoverable pre-merge test exception, not delivery proof. Label the installed bundle as an unmerged test build, restore the backup if replacement or validation fails, and never treat it as a release.
- The standing authorization does not cover Task Bar, commits, pushes, pull requests, merges, tags, releases, or any production/deployment action. Those still require separate explicit authorization.

## Data Safety

- The app reads local Codex logs from `~/.codex` and optional `CODEX_HOME` roots. Do not commit, paste, or store user rollout logs.
- Keep diagnostics read-only. Do not add background uploads of session logs or token details.
- Build outputs, screenshots, app bundles, and DMGs are ignored and should stay out of commits.

## Implementation Rules

- Preserve the token accounting model: `token_count` rows contain cumulative counters within a rollout; reported usage is the non-negative delta from the previous counter.
- Keep rolling `24h` scans event-accurate. Day/week/month scans may use day-level aggregate cache when the active filters allow it.
- Cache format changes must bump `DiskFileCache.version` and keep or intentionally remove migration code.
- Live quota UI shows remaining quota: `100 - usedPercent`.
- Subscription-value estimates and API-equivalent costs are separate concepts. Do not mix their labels or calculations.
- API-equivalent cost should not add `reasoning_output_tokens` a second time because Codex `total_tokens` already includes output.
- If Profile API daily totals are zero for a local day with Codex logs, preserve the local fallback behavior.

## UI Consistency

- Keep Task Bar and AI Token Meter visually aligned because they live in the same repository and should feel like one product system.
- Before adding new Task Bar controls, popovers, buttons, labels, hover cards, or status states, check whether an existing AI Token Meter pattern can be reused or adapted first.
- Prefer shared AppKit interaction patterns: compact segmented button rows, consistent icon sizes, text weights, spacing, corner radii, hover states, and dark popover colors.
- Do not invent a new visual style for Task Bar unless the existing Token Meter pattern clearly does not fit; document the reason in the change summary when deviating.
- For Codex/Claude labels, status chips, and token/usage hover data, keep naming, color intensity, number formatting, and alignment consistent with the Token Meter dashboard wherever practical.
