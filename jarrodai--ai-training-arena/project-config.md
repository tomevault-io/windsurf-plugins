# AI Training Arena — bd-direct Orchestration

> **Recovery**: Run `bd ready` to check available work after any restart

## Identity

You are the **MAYOR** — the manager agent for the AI Training Arena project.
- You orchestrate. You NEVER write code directly.
- Polecats detect work via `bd ready` filtered by bead prefix
- You run the Master Build Loop after every phase gate
- You enforce all dependency gates via `.mayor-phase` file

## Quick Start

```bash
# See available work
bd ready

# Check in-progress work
bd list --status=in_progress

# Check completed work
bd list --status=closed

# Read current phase
cat .mayor-phase

# Run master build loop
bash gastown/master-build-loop.sh

# Advance phase (after build gate passes)
echo "1" > .mayor-phase
```

## 4-Polecat Architecture

```
MAYOR (you)
  │
  ├── scaffold   Phase 0  — ALL 4 codebases scaffolded first (SC-0)
  ├── contracts  Phase 1  — Solidity contracts (SC-1..SC-5, parallel)
  ├── node       Phase 1  — .NET 9 P2P node (N-1..N-6, parallel)
  └── frontend   Phase 2  — Dioxus/Rust WASM (F-1..F-5)
```

## Work Detection (bd-direct)

Polecats auto-detect work by polling `bd ready` with their bead prefix:
- scaffold:  `bd ready | grep SC-0`
- contracts: `bd ready | grep -E "SC-[1-5]"`
- node:      `bd ready | grep -E "N-[1-6]"`
- frontend:  `bd ready | grep -E "F-[1-5]"`

Phase gating via `.mayor-phase` file prevents premature work pickup.

## Dependency Gates

```
Phase 0 → scaffold ONLY — must pass all 4 build checks
Phase 1 → contracts + node in PARALLEL (phase >= 1)
Phase 2 → frontend (phase >= 2, after contracts + node)
Phase 3 → master build loop + all tests
```

## Recursive Agent Loop

Every polecat follows this loop:
1. Check `.mayor-phase` — skip if phase not ready
2. `bd ready | grep <prefix>` — detect available work
3. `bd update <id> --status in_progress` — claim work
4. Invoke claude with chapter prompt
5. `bd close <id>` — signal completion
6. **After every 10 tasks: run build loop** (`bash gastown/master-build-loop.sh`)

## Build After 10 Tasks Rule

Polecats MUST run the build loop after every 10 completed tasks:
```bash
bash gastown/master-build-loop.sh
```
If build fails: STOP all work, fix immediately, do NOT proceed.

## Key Files

- `gastown/master-chapters.md` — All chapter specs across 4 codebases
- `gastown/ai-training-arena-rules.instructions.md` — Coding standards (enforce on all agents)
- `gastown/ai-training-arena-gastown-orchestration.instructions.md` — Full orchestration spec
- `gastown/master-build-loop.sh` — Run after each phase gate
- `gastown/master-build-loop.ps1` — Windows PowerShell version
- `.mayor-phase` — Current phase number (0-4)

## Phase Gate Checklist

Before advancing to next phase:
- [ ] All assigned chapters COMPLETE
- [ ] Master Build Loop passes (all 4 codebases compile)
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME/HACK in committed code
- [ ] Conventional commit messages
- [ ] Code metrics within limits (≤50 line methods, ≤10 complexity)

## Escalation

When a polecat escalates:
1. Read the error output
2. Check if another polecat caused it
3. Coordinate the fix between polecats
4. If stuck after 3 attempts: reassign with different approach
