description: Which coding agents support the llm-wiki skill, how to install for each, and the agent-memory file to use.

# Agents

The `llm-wiki` skill uses the standard [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) format, so it runs in every agent below. The wiki operations are available through the installed skill: init/runtime setup, hybrid or lexical search, structural lint, stats, graph lint, graph extraction, and graph query. Dependency-bearing scripts use pinned PEP 723 environments through `uv run --script`.

## Support matrix

| Agent | `--agent` value | Invoke via | Scripts run |
| --- | --- | --- | :---: |
| Claude Code | `claude-code` | `/wiki:*` slash commands (bundled) or natural language | ✅ |
| Codex (OpenAI) | `codex` | `/skills` or `$llm-wiki` / natural language | ✅ |
| Cursor | `cursor` | `/llm-wiki` or natural language | ✅ |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini-cli` | `/skills` management commands / natural language | ✅ |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | natural language (agent invokes the native `skill` tool) | ✅ |
| OpenClaw | `openclaw` | auto-exposed as a user command | ✅ |
| Pi Agent | `pi` | `/skill:llm-wiki` or natural language | ✅ |
| OMP ("Oh My Pi") | manual (see below) | natural language (skills auto-surface via `skill://`) | ✅ |
| Hermes Agent | manual (see below) | natural language | ✅ |

OpenCode also reads `.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/skills/`, so a Claude Code install works there without a second install.

## Install snippets
Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) first. Every agent invokes the same pinned local runtime; no agent-specific Python environment is required.


**Claude Code** gets the full plugin (skill + slash commands + manifest):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add praneybehl/llm-wiki-plugin
/plugin install llm-wiki@llm-wiki
```

**Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Pi** install the skill through the `skills` CLI — substitute the matrix's `--agent` value:

```bash
npx skills add praneybehl/llm-wiki-plugin -a codex -g
npx skills add praneybehl/llm-wiki-plugin -a cursor -g
npx skills add praneybehl/llm-wiki-plugin -a gemini-cli -g
npx skills add praneybehl/llm-wiki-plugin -a opencode -g
npx skills add praneybehl/llm-wiki-plugin -a openclaw -g
npx skills add praneybehl/llm-wiki-plugin -a pi -g
```

Drop `-g` to install into the current project only.

**OMP ("Oh My Pi")** and **Hermes Agent** aren't yet in the `npx skills` registry — clone the repo and symlink the skill into the agent's skills directory. OMP reads managed/user skills from `~/.omp/agent/skills/` and surfaces them via `skill://`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/praneybehl/llm-wiki-plugin.git
mkdir -p ~/.omp/agent/skills ~/.hermes/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/llm-wiki-plugin/skills/llm-wiki" ~/.omp/agent/skills/llm-wiki
ln -s "$(pwd)/llm-wiki-plugin/skills/llm-wiki" ~/.hermes/skills/llm-wiki
```

## Agent-memory file

After a wiki is bootstrapped, add a short stanza so the agent remembers its location. Put a stable user-level path such as `~/wiki/` in the agent's global instructions for one personal wiki across projects, or a relative path in the project's memory file for a project-only wiki. The filename depends on the agent:

| Agent | Memory file |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Codex (OpenAI) | `AGENTS.md` |
| Cursor | `AGENTS.md` (or `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) |
| OpenCode | `AGENTS.md` (also reads `CLAUDE.md`) |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` |
| Pi Agent | `AGENTS.md` |
| OpenClaw | `AGENTS.md` |
| OMP (Oh My Pi) | `AGENTS.md` |

Running multiple agents? Prefer `AGENTS.md` as the canonical file where supported and symlink `CLAUDE.md` to it. The skill never writes a memory file without your approval. Global and project stanza variants live in `skills/llm-wiki/references/agent-memory-integration.md`.

::: info
Slash commands are Claude Code–only. Everywhere else, invoke the skill by natural language: "add this paper to the wiki", "what does the wiki say about X", "lint the wiki". The wiki itself is agent-agnostic — ingest with one agent, query with another.
:::

## Experience and procedure improvements

All listed skill-compatible agents can run `/wiki:learn` and `/wiki:evolve` workflows through natural language using the installed `references/evolution-workflow.md` and `scripts/wiki_evolve.py`. Only Claude Code has the literal slash commands. Capture and lifecycle tooling use Python stdlib. The shared evaluation adapter includes all nine hosts. Their installed versions, authentication, permitted tools and reported accounting differ; see the evolution execution requirements and live-study report. No new agent integration is required to capture lessons. See [Learning and skill evolution](/evolution).
