# Cursor Rules

## Main Purpose

- **Primary Goal**: This website is a landing page for an iOS app that helps users to increase volume for audio and video files (https://apps.apple.com/app/id6741472421). All content, design, and functionality should be optimized to promote and drive downloads of the iOS app.

## File Modification Rules

- **DO NOT** modify `index.html` - it is a generated file. All HTML changes should be made in `build/template.html` instead.
- When making changes to the template, update `build/template.html` and regenerate the HTML files using the build script.

## Project Structure

- `build/template.html` - Main template file for generating HTML
- `build/build.js` - Build script that generates HTML from template
- `build/*.json` - Translation files for multiple languages (en, ru, de, es, fr, it, pt)
- `index.html` - Generated file for English (do not edit directly)
- `*/index.html` - Generated files for language-specific pages (de, es, fr, it, pt, ru) - do not edit directly
- `style.css` - Main stylesheet
- `privacy.html` - Privacy policy page
- `terms.html` - Terms of service page
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and scripts
