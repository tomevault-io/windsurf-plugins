# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an HLedger MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation built with TypeScript. The project creates a bridge between HLedger accounting software and MCP-compatible applications using the Model Context Protocol SDK.

## Commands

### Building

- `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript and makes the output executable

### Development

- Node.js version: v24.7.0 (specified in .nvmrc)
- Use `nvm use` to set correct Node version

## Architecture

### Core Structure

- **Entry Point**: `src/index.ts` - Main server implementation
- **Output**: `build/index.js` - Compiled executable with shebang
- **Binary**: Available as `hledger-mcp` command after build

### Key Components

- **MCP Server**: Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for Model Context Protocol implementation
- **Transport**: StdioServerTransport for stdio-based communication
- **Validation**: Zod library for schema validation
- **Configuration**: Configurable via CLI flags for read/write behaviour
- **Write Tools**: `hledger_add_transaction`, `hledger_import`, `hledger_rewrite`, `hledger_remove_entry`, `hledger_replace_entry`, and `hledger_close` all write through temporary copies with optional backups
- **Read Tools**: new commands such as `hledger_notes` extend the reporting surface while reusing query + output-format helpers

### Server Structure

The server is configured as:

- Name: "hledger-mcp"
- Version: "1.0.0"
- Capabilities: tooling plus resource discovery (we call `hledger files` and register every reported ledger as an MCP resource before the transport connects)
- Transport: Stdio-based communication

The server runs on stdio and logs startup message to stderr to avoid interfering with the MCP protocol communication on stdout.

### Runtime flags

- `--read-only`: disable the add-transaction tool (all attempts return a validation error). Default: off.
- `--skip-backup`: skip creating `.bak` files when appending to an existing journal. Default: off.
- Journal path remains the first non-flag argument; flags can be passed before or after it.
