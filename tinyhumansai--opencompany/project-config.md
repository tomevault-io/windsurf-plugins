# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

OpenCompany is a Rust 2024 crate rooted at `Cargo.toml`. Rust source lives
under `src/`. Public module surfaces live in source module directories:

- `src/app/`: runtime configuration and shared Axum state
- `src/server/`: Axum router and HTTP handlers
- `src/openhuman/`: launcher and integration seams for the vendored OpenHuman checkout
- `src/tiny/`: optional TinyAgents crate feature/status surface

The command-line entrypoint lives in `src/bin/opencompany.rs`. Business types
are data-only definitions under `companies/` (a `company.toml` manifest plus a
`README.md` — not Cargo crates), loaded at runtime via `opencompany serve
--company companies/<name>`. The operator console is a Vite/React app under
`frontend/`. Design notes and module specifications live in `docs/`, with
`docs/spec/README.md` as the top-level architecture reference and
`docs/modules/` holding per-surface design docs.
Vendored runtime sources live under `vendor/` as Git submodules:

- `vendor/openhuman/`
- `vendor/tinyagents/`

Prefer small modules with focused responsibilities. Keep core type definitions
in a dedicated `types.rs` file and package-local tests in the module file or a
dedicated `test.rs` file when they grow.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`: verify Rust formatting without changing files.
- `cargo fmt`: format Rust source files.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`: run lint checks.
- `cargo build --all-targets`: compile library, binary, tests, and examples.
- `cargo test`: run the full test suite.
- `cargo run --bin opencompany`: run the CLI.
- `cargo run --bin opencompany -- serve`: run the Axum HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:8080`.
- `git submodule update --init --recursive`: initialize OpenHuman and TinyAgents.
- `cargo check --features tiny`: compile against vendored TinyAgents.

Run commands from the repository root unless a future workspace layout changes
the module location.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use standard `rustfmt` output and Rust 2024 idioms. Module and file names should
be `snake_case`; public types should be `PascalCase`; functions, methods,
fields, and local variables should be `snake_case`. Return `Result<T>` using
the crate error type from `src/error.rs`.

## Testing Guidelines

Add focused tests with every behavior change. Keep tests near the module they
exercise unless they verify cross-module behavior, in which case place them in
the consuming module or a future `tests/` directory.

Maintain at least 80% coverage for meaningful library behavior. Document any
intentionally untested edge case in the PR description.

## Documentation Expectations

Keep `README.md`, `docs/spec/README.md`, and module docs in `docs/modules/`
aligned with code changes. Prefer concrete examples over vague descriptions,
especially for Axum routes, OpenHuman launcher behavior, and `tiny*` feature
integration.

Keep every Markdown file, including this one, at 500 lines or fewer. When a
topic grows past that limit, split it into focused files and link them from the
module's `README.md`.

## Running under the platform harness (hosted mode)

This repo is also the tenant workload of the OpenCompany hosting platform:
the `opencompany-manager` control plane (the superproject at
`tinyhumansai/opencompany-microservices`, where this repo is the
`opencompany/` submodule) builds this crate into a per-tenant container and
injects its environment. When developing hosted behavior, know the seams:

- The manager injects `OPENCOMPANY_COMPANY`, `OPENCOMPANY_BIND=0.0.0.0:8080`,
  `OPENCOMPANY_DATA_DIR=/data`, and `OPENCOMPANY_PUBLIC_URL` into every
  tenant container, plus — when database-per-tenant storage is enabled —
  `OPENCOMPANY_STORAGE=mongodb`, `OPENCOMPANY_MONGODB_URI` (credentials
  scoped to that tenant's database only), and `OPENCOMPANY_MONGODB_DB`.
- In the alternative **shared-single-DB** mode (all tenants on one logical
  MongoDB), the manager also injects `OPENCOMPANY_TENANT_ID=<tenant-slug>`.
  The workload then namespaces company ids with `<tenant>--` and records
  `owners` rows so tenants stay apart in the shared database. Isolation is
  application-layer only in this mode — a compromised container can reach
  every tenant's documents; db-per-tenant stays the security default. See
  `docs/spec/runtime/storage.md`. Unset (the default) is a full no-op.
- Storage backend selection and the MongoDB backend are documented in
  `docs/spec/runtime/storage.md`; the port traits it implements are the
  entire persistence contract (`docs/spec/runtime/ports.md`).
- The container must serve `/healthz` on `:8080` quickly — the manager's
  wake-on-request proxy blocks on it and gives up after its startup timeout.
- Run the full platform locally by following
  `docs/local-development.md` in the superproject.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use concise, imperative commit subjects. Keep the first line specific to the
change and avoid bundling unrelated work.

Keep commits small and concise. Commit each coherent, validated slice on its
own rather than batching many changes together, and keep the message short and
focused on that one change.
