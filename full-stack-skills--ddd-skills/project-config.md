## Project Overview

`ddd-skills` is a plugin collection of **16 Agent Skills** for Domain-Driven Design architecture — part of the [Full Stack Skills](https://github.com/partme-ai/full-stack-skills) ecosystem by PartMe.AI. Each skill is a self-contained `SKILL.md` file that AI agents load on-demand.

- **Install**: `npx skills add full-stack-skills/ddd-skills`
- **License**: Apache-2.0

## SKILL.md Authoring Conventions

Each `SKILL.md` follows this pattern:

```yaml
---
name: ddd-skill-name           # kebab-case, matches directory name
description: <one-line summary> # SHOULD include "Use when user asks about ..." triggers
license: Apache-2.0
---
```

Body sections (in order):
1. **H1 heading** — Skill title (English or bilingual)
2. **Workflow** — Numbered step-by-step process
3. **When to Use** — Table: ALWAYS use column (trigger keywords) vs Skip column (exclusions)
4. **Detailed guidance** — Architecture diagrams, code examples, templates, checklists
5. **Related skills** — Cross-references to other skills in the collection

- Lines per SKILL.md: ~168–470 (most ~200); keep under 500 — move long sections into `references/`
- Use Chinese for domain terminology when skill targets Chinese-speaking audience
- Skills reference each other (e.g., domain-designer references event-storming)

## Key Files

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Add new skills to the `skills` array here
- `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` — Update the skills table when adding/removing skills
- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — The actual skill content loaded by agents
