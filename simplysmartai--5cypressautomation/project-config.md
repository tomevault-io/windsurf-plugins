# 5 Cypress Automation — Operations Bible

**Brand:** 5 Cypress Automation | **Website:** www.5cypress.com | **Contact:** nick@5cypress.com

**Mission:** Deliver two high-value services to small B2B businesses:
1. **Marketing Services** — Strategy, email campaigns, reporting, social content (see `marketing-team/`)
2. **Automation Services** — QuickBooks invoicing, ShipStation, SEO, lead gen, missed-call text-back

**Target clients:** Small B2B tech and medical companies with relationship-driven sales cycles.
**Tech:** Node/TS or Python. APIs: QuickBooks Online, ShipStation, Stripe, Zoho.

## Choosing the Right System

| Task | Go to |
|------|-------|
| Strategy brief, email campaign, social content, reporting | `marketing-team/CLAUDE.md` |
| QBO invoice, ShipStation shipping, lead gen, SEO | `directives/` + `execution/` (this file) |
| New client onboarding | `directives/onboard_client.md` |
| Proposal or contract | `directives/create_proposal.md`, `directives/send_contract.md` |

---

## The 3-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: Directive (What to do)**
- SOPs written in Markdown, live in `directives/`
- Define goals, inputs, tools/scripts to use, outputs, and edge cases
- Natural language instructions, like you'd give a mid-level employee

**Layer 2: Orchestration (Decision making)**
- This is you. Your job: intelligent routing.
- Read directives, call execution tools in the right order, handle errors, update directives with learnings
- You are the glue between intent and execution. Example: read `directives/sales-to-qbo.md`, then run `execution/qbo_invoice.py`

**Layer 3: Execution (Doing the work)**
- Deterministic scripts in `execution/` (Python, with some TypeScript)
- Environment variables and API tokens stored in `.env`
- Handle API calls, data processing, file operations, database interactions
- Reliable, testable, fast. Use scripts instead of doing things manually.

**Why this works:** Errors compound. 90% accuracy per step = 59% success over 5 steps. Pushing complexity into deterministic code leaves you focused on decision-making only.

---

## Operating Principles

**1. Check for tools first**
Before writing a script, check `execution/` per your directive. Only create new scripts if none exist.

**2. Self-anneal when things break**
- Read error message and stack trace
- Fix the script and re-test (check with user first if it uses paid API credits)
- Update the directive with what you learned (API limits, timing, edge cases)

**3. Update directives as you learn**
Directives are living documents. Update them when you discover API constraints, better approaches, or common errors. Do not create or overwrite directives without asking unless explicitly instructed.

---

## Safety Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- **Financial:** QBO sandbox first, inventory check before invoice
- **Data:** Zod/Pydantic validation on ALL inputs
- **Client:** `.env.example` only, no stored credentials ever
- **Errors:** Log every API call, notify on failure
- **Testing:** Dry-run + 80% coverage before delivery

---

## Self-Annealing Loop

When something breaks:
1. Fix it
2. Update the script/tool
3. Test the fix
4. Update the directive with the new flow
5. System is now stronger

## Core Automation Workflows

| Workflow | Directive | Scripts |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Sales Form → QBO Invoice | `directives/sales-to-qbo.md` | `execution/create_qbo_invoice.py` |
| QBO Invoice → ShipStation | `directives/form_to_invoice_shipping_inventory.md` | `execution/create_shipping_order.py` |
| SEO outreach machine | `directives/seo_sales_machine.md` | `execution/seo_outreach_prepper.py` |
| Lead research | `directives/lead_research_service.md` | `execution/lead_research_orchestrator.py` |
| Missed-call text-back | `directives/workflow_packages.md` | — |
| Monthly insights report | `directives/deliver_monthly_insights.md` | `execution/generate_monthly_insights.py` |
| Client onboarding | `directives/onboard_client.md` | `execution/onboard_client.py` |
| Proposal creation | `directives/create_proposal.md` | `execution/create_proposal.py` |
| Invoice sending | `directives/send_invoice.md` | `execution/create_invoice.py` |

---

## Tech Stack (MANDATORY)

- **Language:** Python/FastAPI (primary), TypeScript/Node.js (secondary)
- **DB:** SQLite/Postgres (dev → client PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **APIs:** QuickBooks Online OAuth, ShipStation, Stripe, Zoho Calendar
- **Validation:** Pydantic (Python) / Zod (TypeScript) on ALL inputs
- **Hosting:** Client server — Heroku/Vercel/Railway/Docker as needed
- **Testing:** Pytest + dry-run scripts, 80% coverage before delivery
- **Never:** Hard-coded secrets, auto-prod API calls, Google Sheets as the primary DB
