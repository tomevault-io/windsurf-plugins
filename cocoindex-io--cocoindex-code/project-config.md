## Build and Test Commands

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for project management.

```bash
uv run mypy .           # Type check Python code
uv run pytest tests/    # Run Python tests
```

## Code Conventions

### Internal vs External Modules

We distinguish between **internal modules** (under packages with `_` prefix, e.g. `_internal.*` or `connectors.*._source`) and **external modules** (which users can directly import).

**External modules** (user-facing, e.g. `cocoindex/ops/sentence_transformers.py`):

* Be strict about not leaking implementation details
* Use `__all__` to explicitly list public exports
* Prefix ALL non-public symbols with `_`, including:
  * Standard library imports: `import threading as _threading`, `import typing as _typing`
  * Third-party imports: `import numpy as _np`, `from numpy.typing import NDArray as _NDArray`
  * Internal package imports: `from cocoindex.resources import schema as _schema`
* Exception: `TYPE_CHECKING` imports for type hints don't need prefixing

**Internal modules** (e.g. `cocoindex/_internal/component_ctx.py`):

* Less strict since users shouldn't import these directly
* Standard library and internal imports don't need underscore prefix
* Only prefix symbols that are truly private to the module itself (e.g. `_context_var` for a module-private ContextVar)

### Imports

Prefer top-level imports. Only use local (in-function) imports when truly necessary — e.g. to break circular dependencies or to defer a heavy import that isn't always needed.

### Type Annotations

Avoid `Any` whenever feasible. Use specific types — including concrete types from third-party libraries. Only use `Any` when the type is truly generic and no downstream code needs to downcast it.

### Multi-Value Returns

For functions returning multiple values, use `NamedTuple` instead of plain tuples. At call sites, access fields by name (`result.can_reuse`) rather than positional unpacking — this prevents misreading fields in the wrong order.

### Single Source of Truth

When the same value or logic appears in multiple places, consolidate it into one canonical definition. Don't scatter literals, constants, or path construction across files.

### Dead Code

When changes make code unreachable or unused, delete it along with its tests. Don't leave orphaned modules around.

### Testing Guidelines

We prefer end-to-end tests on user-facing APIs, over unit tests on smaller internal functions. With this said, there're cases where unit tests are necessary, e.g. for internal logic with various situations and edge cases, in which case it's usually easier to cover various scenarios with unit tests.

When tests fail, fix the underlying issue. Don't skip, ignore, or exclude to get a green result.
