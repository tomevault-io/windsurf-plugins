# Agent Guidelines

Coding standards for AI agents working on this codebase.

## License header

Every `.py` file must begin with this Apache 2.0 header:

## Type annotations

All function and method signatures must have full type annotations for every
parameter and the return type. No exceptions.

## Documentation

- Use Google-style docstrings on all **public** classes, functions, and
  constants.
- Do NOT add docstrings to private/internal symbols (prefixed with `_`).
- Do NOT add file-level module docstrings. Packages, files, functions,
  variables, and classes should be named clearly enough to be
  self-documenting.

## Comments

Do NOT write code comments unless documenting a non-obvious hack,
workaround, or performance trick (e.g. "exploiting numpy broadcast to
avoid a loop"). Never narrate what the code does.

## Naming

- Names must be short, concise, and easy to understand.
- No abbreviations. Favor clarity over brevity.
- Prefix private symbols with `_` (functions, classes, constants, methods).
- Use `snake_case` for functions, methods, and variables.
- Use `PascalCase` for classes.
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for module-level constants.

## Style

- No emoji in code or documentation.
- Run `ruff check` and `ruff format` before committing.
- Keep imports sorted (enforced by ruff `I` rules).

## Benchmark results

- Only commit full-dataset benchmark runs to `results/`. It is the single
  source of truth aggregated by `report`, `leaderboard`, and
  `detection-report`, which glob every file in the directory.
- Never commit partial or smoke runs (e.g. any run produced with
  `--max-samples`). Their noisy, non-comparable numbers would corrupt the
  leaderboards. Keep such runs local or write them elsewhere.
- Keep `--effort` consistent with existing runs when adding a model to a
  task, so results stay comparable on shared leaderboards. All committed
  runs currently use `--effort low`; do not mix effort levels within a
  task's leaderboard unless the run is explicitly an effort comparison.
- Images are EXIF-transposed on load before being sent to any provider.
  Datasets whose images carry EXIF orientation tags will therefore produce
  runs that are not comparable to runs made before this behavior existed;
  re-run all models on such a dataset rather than mixing old and new runs.

## Reference models

- SAM 3, YOLO-E, and future local reference detectors are comparison
  baselines, not VLM benchmark entries. Their code, environments, results,
  prompts, documentation, and rendered leaderboards live under `reference/`
  or `src/vlm_exam/reference/`.
- Never put reference run files in `results/`, add reference model keys to
  `src/vlm_exam/configs/models.yaml`, or include reference rows in the main
  VLM leaderboard or `web/benchmark_summary.json`.
- Full reference runs use effort `reference` and belong in
  `reference/results/`. Partial and smoke runs remain local.
- The committed reference prompt modes are class names, image-conditioned v1,
  v2 none, and v2 overlay. Treat other prompt-generation experiments as local
  scratch work unless their scope is explicitly approved.
- Regenerate the separate mixed comparison charts with
  `vlm-exam reference-detection-leaderboard`; output belongs in
  `reference/leaderboards/`.
- Keep model-specific dependencies and adapters in each model's isolated
  project under `reference/<model>/`. The main package must not depend on
  PyTorch, Transformers, Ultralytics, or model weights.

## Web summary

- Regenerate `web/benchmark_summary.json` and commit it in every PR so the
  website payload never drifts from `results/` and `configs/models.yaml`.
- Rebuild it with the detection dataset so detection mAP is included:

```bash
vlm-exam summary --dataset-directory data/detection/train
```

- The command compiles all efforts by default, emitting one entry per
  `(model, effort)` pair; pass `--effort` only to restrict to one level.
- The output is deterministic given `results/`: `generated_at` derives
  from the newest included run, so an unchanged diff after regeneration
  means the results did not change.
- The file is a generated artifact; never hand-edit it.

## Leaderboard charts

- Regenerate the leaderboard charts in `visualizations/leaderboards/` and
  commit them in every PR that changes `results/`, so the tracked PNGs
  never drift from the underlying runs:

```bash
vlm-exam leaderboard --dataset-directory data/detection/train
vlm-exam efficiency-report
```

## Adding and benchmarking models

- In `configs/models.yaml`, each model has an ordered `routes` list (or
  legacy single `provider` field). The vlm-exam model **key** is used in
