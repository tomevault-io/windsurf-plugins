# Trade Ops — Codex Instructions

Trade Ops is Benjamin Spencer's retail trading operating system.
TradingView is the cockpit. This repo is everything around it.

Do not build or behave as if this repo is a replacement for TradingView.
Use it to add memory, structure, research, and discipline.

## Mission

Use Codex to help Benjamin research better, trade more deliberately, and learn faster.
The system is exploratory and human-in-the-loop.
It is not an autonomous trading bot.

## Non-Negotiables

- Paper before live. Never place a live order without explicit user confirmation.
- Every trade needs a thesis, entry, stop, and target before opening.
- Stop means plan stop. Do not widen it after entry unless the user explicitly changes the plan.
- Prefer no trade over a forced trade.
- Keep the repo state honest. Do not let watchlists, journal state, or wiki notes drift silently from TradingView.
- Prefer small, composable tool calls over giant one-shot scripts that hide the reasoning.

## Start of Session

Before doing substantial trading work:

1. Check TradingView account state.
2. Check whether any open positions or working orders already exist.
3. Read open journal records for any repo-tracked paper trades or manual positions.
4. Read local market context and wiki memory rules if the task is broader than one symbol.
5. For any symbol you are about to analyze deeply, read its local symbol wiki file first if it exists.

Use these files first:

- `watchlists/universe.json`
- `wiki/README.md`
- `wiki/market/context.md` if present locally
- `wiki/symbols/<SYMBOL>.md`
- `config/risk.json`
- `config/taxonomy.json`

## Source of Truth

Prefer these repo files over older external notes:

- Active account state: TradingView account, positions, and orders
- Repo-tracked active trades: `journal/open/`
- Universe: `watchlists/universe.json`
- Closed journal records: `journal/closed/`
- Knowledge base: `wiki/`
- Risk rules: `config/risk.json`
- Setup and mistake taxonomy: `config/taxonomy.json`

Treat older files under `/Users/benjaminspencer/.codex/trading-journal/` as legacy context unless the user explicitly asks to use them.

## TradingView Rules

Use the local wrapper first:

- `npm run tv -- account`
- `npm run tv -- positions`
- `npm run tv -- orders`
- `npm run tv -- history`
- `npm run tv -- symbol <symbol>`
- `npm run tv -- timeframe <timeframe>`
- `npm run tv -- chart`
- `npm run tv -- indicators`

When using TradingView:

- Equity symbol switching is stateful. Run symbol checks sequentially, not in parallel.
- Verify post-action state after every paper write. A clicked button is not the same as a materialized order.
- Prefer limit-order tests and explicit verification over blind market-order loops.
- If the chart state looks polluted or stale, re-check before drawing conclusions.
- Keep paper execution and research clearly separated in your reasoning.

## Risk and Position Discipline

Default risk rules live in `config/risk.json`.
Use them unless the user explicitly overrides them.

Important defaults:

- Max simultaneous positions: `5`
- Max risk per trade: `1%` or `$200`, whichever is stricter in context
- Max portfolio heat: `5%`
- Daily loss limit: `$500` or `2%`
- Default sizing model: fixed-dollar-risk
- Paper mode is the default

If a proposed trade violates these limits, say so clearly.

## Watchlist Review Style

When reviewing the board:

1. Scan the relevant universe, not just favorite names.
2. Use the right adapter for the asset class.
3. Distinguish clearly between `interesting`, `stalk`, and `trade now`.
4. Call raw tools individually instead of relying on a bundled survey or scanner to decide the board.
5. Build an opportunity exploration queue of 3-5 pockets before making the final call.
6. Explore at least one long, one short/hedge, one event/model-vs-market, and one high-beta/speculative expression when the data is available.
7. If no expression is attractive after focused investigation, explain whether that is a true market conclusion or a search/data failure.

Source preferences:

- Equities, ETFs, many futures, FX, majors: Yahoo
- Fundamentals and metadata: Massive
- Options chain, Greeks, IV, unusual options activity: Massive (paid plan required)
- Filings and company facts: SEC EDGAR
- Positioning context: CFTC
- On-chain or Yahoo-missing crypto: GeckoTerminal, DexScreener, Jupiter
- Chart confirmation and paper execution: TradingView

## SEC Usage

Use raw SEC commands when broad exploration is appropriate:

- `npm run sec -- submissions <ticker>`
- `npm run sec -- filings <ticker> --forms 10-K,10-Q,8-K --limit 5`
- `npm run sec -- facts <ticker>`

Use focused helpers when the raw output is too large:

- `npm run sec -- latest-10k <ticker>`
- `npm run sec -- latest-10q <ticker>`
- `npm run sec -- recent-8k <ticker> --limit 3`
- `npm run sec -- facts-concept <ticker> <concept> --limit 5`

Helpers are allowed because they improve signal. They do not replace exploration.

## Journaling and Review

When a paper trade is opened, changed, cancelled, or closed:

- update the journal if the workflow calls for it
- keep the watchlist state consistent
- keep notes factual and concise
- use the taxonomy in `config/taxonomy.json`

After a closed-trade review:
