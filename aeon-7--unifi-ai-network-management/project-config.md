# Agent Integration Guide

This repository packages a UniFi API skill plus owner-operated setup and safety tooling. It supports OpenClaw and Hermes Agent directly, and the same `SKILL.md` directory can be adapted to any agent framework that supports filesystem skills or tool instructions.

## Canonical Skill Directory

The skill is contained in:

```text
skill/unifi-api/
```

Install it as a directory, not as a single markdown file. The directory must keep this shape:

```text
unifi-api/
|-- SKILL.md
|-- scripts/unifi_api.py
|-- references/api-surfaces.md
|-- references/endpoints.md
|-- references/task-recipes.md
|-- references/troubleshooting.md
`-- agents/openai.yaml
```

The helper script is part of the skill contract. The agent should prefer deterministic helper calls over hand-written curl commands.

## OpenClaw Install Path

Default OpenClaw path:

```text
~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/unifi-api/
```

The provided installer does this automatically:

```bash
./setup.sh --target openclaw
```

Manual install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills
cp -a skill/unifi-api ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/unifi-api
chmod -R u+rwX,go-rwx ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/unifi-api
python3 -m py_compile ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/unifi-api/scripts/unifi_api.py
```

Then run your agent framework's skill refresh/check command, for example:

```bash
openclaw skills check --agent <agent-name>
```


## Hermes Agent Install Path

Hermes Agent supports `SKILL.md` skills under:

```text
~/.hermes/skills/<skill-name>/
```

Install this package for Hermes with:

```bash
./setup.sh --target hermes
source ~/.bashrc
unifi-setup-openclaw
unifi-status-openclaw
hermes doctor
```

The installer copies:

```text
skill/unifi-api/ -> ~/.hermes/skills/unifi-api/
env.example      -> ~/.hermes/unifi.env
scripts/*        -> ~/.local/bin/
```

For Hermes, start a fresh session after installation so the skill catalog reloads. The skill should become available by name/description and, in Hermes interfaces that expose skill slash commands, as the `unifi-api` skill.

Hermes references used for this layout: Hermes documents skills as `SKILL.md` files in `~/.hermes/skills/`, and its install diagnostics use `hermes doctor`.

## Other Agent Frameworks

For non-OpenClaw/non-Hermes frameworks:

1. Copy `skill/unifi-api/` into the framework's skill/tool directory.
2. Make sure the framework can read `SKILL.md`.
3. Preserve `references/` and `scripts/` next to `SKILL.md`.
4. Expose Python 3 to the agent runtime.
5. Set credentials in a private env file or process environment.
6. Instruct the agent to load `SKILL.md` when the user mentions UniFi, Ubiquiti, UDM, Network Application, clients, APs, switches, VLANs, SSIDs, firewall rules, or network diagnostics.

## Credential File

Default env locations:

```text
~/.openclaw/unifi.env  # OpenClaw
~/.hermes/unifi.env    # Hermes
```

The helper also checks:

```text
~/.openclaw/.env
~/.openclaw/openclaw.env
~/.openclaw/workspace/.env
~/.hermes/unifi.env
~/.hermes/.env
~/.hermes/skills/unifi-api/.env
<skill-dir>/.env
```

Use `env.example` as the template. The repository should not contain a committed `.env`; copy `env.example` to the selected private runtime env path or let `setup.sh` do it. Never commit a real env file.

## Operational Commands And Agent Boundaries

The repository installs explicit target commands such as:

```bash
# OpenClaw
unifi-setup-openclaw
unifi-status-openclaw
unifi-backup-openclaw
unifi-restore-openclaw

# Hermes
unifi-setup-hermes
unifi-status-hermes
unifi-backup-hermes
unifi-restore-hermes
```

`unifi-setup-openclaw`, `unifi-setup-hermes`, the matching status aliases, and break-glass local access-control commands are owner/operator commands.

The matching backup and restore commands are part of safe network change management and are included in `SKILL.md`. Agents may run backups on demand or before major changes. Agents may run restore dry-runs after the user asks for rollback. Agents must ask which backup date/time to use when multiple restore points exist, summarize the dry-run, and apply only after explicit user confirmation.

## Agent Behavior Contract

A safe UniFi agent should:

1. Prefer read-only API calls first.
2. Prefer official APIs over legacy private endpoints.
3. Use exact object identity before writes: site, name, MAC/IP/model/id.
4. Avoid broad changes based on vague requests.
5. Run the matching backup command (`unifi-backup-openclaw` or `unifi-backup-hermes`) before major changes and report the backup path.
6. For restore requests, list backup date/time folders and ask which restore point to use when multiple exist.
7. Run restore dry-run first, then apply only after explicit confirmation.
8. Explain intended endpoint/action before high-impact writes.
9. Verify after every write.
10. Never reveal API keys, passwords, cookies, CSRF tokens, or raw sensitive config.
11. Report failures with endpoint path and HTTP status, not secrets.
