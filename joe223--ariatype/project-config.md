# Agent Operating Contract

**Mission**: Convert user intent into complete, verified software changes with minimal back-and-forth.

**Documentation map**: [`context/README.md`](context/README.md) — progressive disclosure, not encyclopedia. Start there, follow links for depth.

## Default Execution Strategy

Use a superpowers-style iteration loop for all non-trivial work. The default mode is not "big-bang implementation"; it is rapid, evidence-driven convergence.

### Core Loop

1. **Frame** — Restate the user goal as an observable outcome, not an implementation guess
2. **Reduce** — Shrink scope to the smallest vertical slice that proves progress
3. **Locate** — Find the spec, affected boundaries, existing contracts, and canonical docs
4. **Test First** — Add or identify the failing check that proves the gap
5. **Implement** — Change the minimum code needed to make the check pass
6. **Verify** — Run the strongest relevant verification, not the cheapest plausible command
7. **Extract** — Update docs, invariants, and follow-up risks before handoff

### Iteration Rules

- **Prefer vertical slices** — Ship one end-to-end behavior at a time instead of editing many layers speculatively
- **Prefer evidence over intuition** — Logs, tests, contracts, and code paths outrank guesses
- **Prefer existing seams** — Reuse current traits, managers, commands, and document entry points before introducing new structure
- **Prefer small batches** — One user-visible outcome or one invariant per iteration
- **Checkpoint frequently** — After each slice, reassess whether the remaining plan is still the right plan
- **Surface uncertainty early** — State assumptions, missing specs, and external risks before they compound
- **Escalate before drift** — If the task starts widening, stop and reframe instead of silently expanding scope

### Planning Threshold

Create or update a plan before coding when work is multi-file, cross-layer, ambiguous, risky, or likely to take more than one tight iteration.

Use plans to:

- define the target behavior and proof of completion
- split work into atomic implementation units
- record risks, dependencies, and deferred follow-ups
- preserve momentum across agent handoffs

See [`context/plans/README.md`](context/plans/README.md) for lifecycle and format.

### Definition of Progress

Progress is only real when it leaves behind at least one of:

- a passing failing-first test
- a verified behavioral fix
- a narrowed root cause with concrete evidence
- a cleaned-up invariant or canonical document

Code churn without stronger evidence is not progress.

## Brainstorm Output Directory

Brainstorm requirements documents go to `context/brainstorms/` (not `docs/brainstorms/`).

## Architecture Principles

### Headless Backend Architecture

The application follows a strict **backend-driven architecture** where the Rust backend is the complete product implementation:

| Layer | Responsibility | Constraint |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| **Backend (Headless)** | Complete product logic, all functionality, state management, business rules | Must work independently without frontend. Given correct config files, the backend should be fully functional. |
| **Frontend (UI Layer)** | State display, user interaction, visual feedback | Only renders what backend emits. No business logic, no state decisions, no functional control flow. |

**Implications:**

1. **Backend owns all state** — Recording state, transcription state, settings, history, and any product state must be managed entirely in Rust. Frontend only observes via IPC events and queries.
2. **Backend owns all control** — Recording start/stop/cancel, transcription retry, model download, settings changes — all triggered via IPC commands, executed entirely in backend.
3. **Frontend is reactive** — UI components respond to backend events (`RECORDING_STATE_CHANGED`, `TRANSCRIPTION_COMPLETE`, etc.) and render accordingly. No proactive state mutations.
4. **CLI/Headless capability** — The backend should be usable from CLI or scripts without any frontend process. All features accessible via Tauri commands alone.
5. **Config-driven independence** — Given a valid config file and environment, backend should produce correct behavior without frontend guidance.

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**

- Frontend deciding "recording is too short, skip saving" → Backend should handle this.
- Frontend calculating "next retry delay" → Backend decides retry policy.
- Frontend managing "current hotkey state" → Backend tracks hotkey registration lifecycle.
- Frontend interpreting "error means show retry button" → Backend emits structured events, frontend renders.

**Verification:**

When adding a new feature, ask: "Can this work from CLI/headless mode?" If no, the logic belongs in frontend and violates this architecture.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

| # | Rule | Enforcement |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Spec-first** — Never code from vague intuition. Find the spec at `context/feat/[name]/[ver]/prd/erd.md` first. | Blocker |
| 2 | **TDD/BDD** — `spec → failing test → implement → refactor → verify`. Regressions ship with test first. | Blocker |
