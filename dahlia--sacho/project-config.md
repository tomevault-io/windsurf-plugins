Prerequisites
-------------

This repository is managed through [mise]. Use the tasks defined in
*mise.toml* instead of calling individual project tools directly when possible.
That keeps the Rust toolchain, auxiliary tools, dependency fetching, formatting,
and checks consistent across local development and CI.

Install mise first, then install the repository tools:

~~~~ sh
mise install
~~~~

The project requires the Rust toolchain configured in *mise.toml*. The mise
installation also provides supporting tools such as Hongdown, Nushell,
cargo-mutants, Jujutsu, Mercurial, Node.js, and npm.

After installing tools, mise runs the repository post-install hook. This fetches
Cargo dependencies and writes a Git pre-commit hook that runs the `check` task.
If you need to refresh that setup manually, run:

~~~~ sh
mise deps
mise generate git-pre-commit --write --task=check
~~~~

[mise]: https://mise.jdx.dev/


Development
-----------

Use the mise tasks as the project interface:

~~~~ sh
mise run check
~~~~

Runs the full local verification suite:

 -  `cargo check`
 -  `cargo clippy`
 -  `cargo fmt --check`
 -  `hongdown --check`
 -  `mise fmt --check`
 -  `npm test`
 -  `npm pack --dry-run`

Format code and Markdown before committing:

~~~~ sh
mise run fmt
~~~~

Build the workspace:

~~~~ sh
mise run build
~~~~

Run tests:

~~~~ sh
mise run test
~~~~

Run the ignored smoke tests against Git plus the mise-managed Jujutsu and
Mercurial executables. These cover VCS repository discovery and repository URL
inference:

~~~~ sh
mise run test:vcs
~~~~

Use mutation testing for changes to core Rust logic and the tests that protect
it.  This includes parsing, ordering, normalization, reference resolution,
repository discovery, changelog compilation, VCS checks, and repository
mutations:

~~~~ sh
mise run mutants
~~~~

This runs cargo-mutants, which checks whether the test suite catches small
changes injected into the Rust code.  A full workspace run can take tens of
minutes or longer, depending on the machine and the number of mutants.  Treat
it as a finishing-stage check after the implementation and normal tests are
stable, not as part of the edit-compile-test loop.

During active development, skip mutation testing or limit it to the code being
worked on.  Pass cargo-mutants filters through the mise task, for example:

~~~~ sh
mise run mutants -- --file 'crates/sacho/src/fragment.rs'
mise run mutants -- --in-diff HEAD~1
mise run mutants -- --re 'fragment'
~~~~

The `--iterate` option skips mutants caught by previous runs.  Once the change
is ready for final review, run the full workspace mutation suite without
development-only filters.  A successful run must report zero missed mutants and
zero timed-out mutants.  Unviable mutants are acceptable; missed or timed-out
mutants mean the test suite or implementation needs more work.

On a machine with spare CPU and memory, pass `-j` through the mise task to test
several mutants in parallel:

~~~~ sh
mise run mutants -- -j 3
~~~~

Choose the job count to fit the machine.

Run the Sacho binary during development:

~~~~ sh
mise run run
~~~~

Run the documentation site locally:

~~~~ sh
mise run docs:dev
~~~~

Build or preview the production documentation site:

~~~~ sh
mise run docs:build
mise run docs:preview
~~~~

The documentation package and its lockfile live under *docs/*.  The mise tasks
install its npm dependencies when needed.


Contribution guidelines
-----------------------

Keep changes focused and small enough to review comfortably. Include tests when
the change affects behavior, parsing, output, or error handling.

Develop behavior changes test-first when practical: write the failing test that
captures the intended behavior, watch it fail for the right reason, then
implement the smallest change that makes it pass.  Keep the test as the
regression guard.

Use property-based testing wherever the behavior can be expressed as generated
inputs plus invariants.  This is especially important for parsing, ordering,
deterministic output, reference resolution, path discovery, format
normalization, and error classification.  Use example-based unit tests or
integration tests when property-based testing does not fit the behavior, for
example CLI help text, a fixed regression fixture, or a workflow that needs a
specific user-visible transcript.

Sacho is intentionally opinionated. Before adding configuration or broadening
behavior, check whether the change fits the project philosophy in
*PHILOSOPHY.md*. Configuration should describe a repository, not turn Sacho into
a general-purpose changelog framework.
