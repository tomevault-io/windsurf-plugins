# AI Knowledge Base Index

Use this map to pick the **right** source of truth. Prefer these over guessing from memory.

## Canonical sources (trust these)

| Document | Role |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Repo-root entry for all AI tools |
| `docs/ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md` | Full team engineering standards (44 sections) |
| `docs/ai/ZIZKADB_MAPPINGS.md` | How standards map to this repo's folders |
| `docs/ai/README.md` | AI-assisted development map |
| `docs/ai/MAINTAINER.md` | Maintainer-only PR/issue metadata |
| Root `CLAUDE.md` | Stack, module map, test commands |
| `dashboard/DASHBOARD_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` | Dashboard flows, API contract, per-screen behavior |
| `core/CLAUDE.md` | Router map, auth tree, asyncpg patterns |
| `examples/CLAUDE.md` | Runnable example agents |
| `docs/adr/` | Architectural decisions (incl. ADR-008 AI workflow) |
| `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | Focused agent guides (always-on + globs) |
| `.cursor/skills/zizkadb-*/SKILL.md` | Setup, test, release workflows |

## OSS repo scope (important)

This open-source tree ships the **tenant dashboard**, API, SDKs, MCP, and marketing/community surfaces. It does **not** include the managed-cloud **operator admin console** (`/admin`, `/v1/admin/*`). Do not implement admin routes here.

## Keep docs accurate

When your change affects behavior listed in a KB section, update that doc **in the same PR**.

## Billing reality

No Stripe/checkout gate. Signup uses `selectBillingPlan` after OTP. `billing_status_payload()` always returns `has_access: true`.
