# Agents.md - Comprehensive Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed documentation for each package in the MagicAppDev project, covering architecture, dependencies, usage guidelines, and integration points. MagicAppDev is a comprehensive monorepo-based fullstack app building platform inspired by Expo, utilizing Turborepo for efficient monorepo management, enabling rapid development, customization, and deployment of apps across web and mobile with no-code capabilities.

## Mobile Repo Boundary

- Treat `apps/mobile` as its own independent repo/workflow surface inside this repository.
- When a task is scoped to mobile, interpret paths, commands, and docs relative to `apps/mobile` unless the task explicitly says it spans the root workspace.
- Mobile GitHub Actions live under `apps/mobile/.github/workflows/` in this repository. When operating as the mobile repo, treat that directory as the workflow root rather than the monorepo root `.github/workflows/`.
- Do not assume root-only commands, root `.env` files, or root workflow paths apply to mobile-only work.

## Tech Stack Overview

- **Monorepo Management**: Turborepo with pnpm for package management, including local/remote caching
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers with Hono framework
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 with Drizzle ORM
- **Frontend (Web)**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Frontend (Mobile)**: Ionic with Capacitor
- **Authentication**: GitHub OAuth with JWT session management
- **AI Integration**: Cloudflare AI Gateway for optimized model access
- **Build System**: Hybrid Nx + Turborepo setup (in progress of consolidation)
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests (planned)
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers platform with GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Discord Bot Configuration

For the community Discord server, configure the following bot settings:

- **Interactions Endpoint URL**: <https://nice-example.local/api/interactions>
  - Used to receive interactions via HTTP POSTs rather than over Gateway with a bot user.
- **Linked Roles Verification URL**: <https://nice-example.local/verify-user>
  - Configured to enable the application as a requirement in a server role's Links settings.
- **Terms of Service URL**: <https://my-cool-app.com/terms-of-service>
  - A link to the application's Terms of Service.
- **Privacy Policy URL**: <https://my-cool-app.com/privacy-policy>
  - A link to the application's Privacy Policy.

## Conclusion

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, dependencies, usage guidelines, and integration points for each package and application in the MagicAppDev project. Use this documentation to ensure consistency and maintainability across all components. The project is focused on building a full-stack framework for people to build mobile and web apps with no-code capabilities, including a website with agent chat, mobile app, and CLI to generate code setups, all hosted on Cloudflare Workers and designed to be free-tier compatible.

## Development Guidelines for Agentic Coding

### 1. Build, Lint, and Quality Commands

Always run these commands from the root directory using `pnpm`.

- **Build Everything**: `pnpm build` (uses Turborepo)
- **Build Package**: `turbo build --filter=@magicappdev/<package-name>`
- **Format Code**: `pnpm format` (runs Prettier)
- **Fix Linting**: `pnpm lint:fix` (runs ESLint)
- **Typecheck All**: `pnpm typecheck` (runs Nx/TypeScript)
- **Full Check**: `pnpm check` (format + lint:fix + typecheck + build)

### 2. Code Style Guidelines

#### Formatting (Prettier)

Adhere to the `.prettierrc` configuration:

- **Width**: 80 characters
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (no tabs)
- **Semicolons**: Required
- **Quotes**: Double quotes
- **Trailing Commas**: All (arrays, objects, imports)
- **Arrow Functions**: Avoid parentheses for single parameters (`x => x`)

#### Imports & Modules

- **Extensions**: Always use explicit `.js` extensions for local imports in TypeScript files (e.g., `import { foo } from "./foo.js"`).
- **Organization**: Imports are automatically sorted (External > Workspace > Relative).
- **Workspace Packages**: Use `@magicappdev/` prefix for internal dependencies.

#### TypeScript & Types

- **Strict Mode**: `strict: true` is enabled. Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- **Inference**: Use Type Inference for local variables.
- **Schema Types**: Export inferred types from Drizzle schemas:
  ```typescript
  export type User = typeof users.$inferSelect;
  export type NewUser = typeof users.$inferInsert;
  ```
- **Interfaces**: Prefer `interface` for public APIs and props.
- **Utility Types**: Use `Record<string, unknown>` for generic objects instead of `object` or `any`.

#### Naming Conventions

- **Variables/Functions**: `camelCase`
- **Components/Types/Interfaces**: `PascalCase`
- **Files**: `kebab-case.ts` or `kebab-case.tsx`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Database Tables/Columns**: `snake_case`

#### Error Handling

- **API Requests**: Always check `response.ok` before parsing JSON.
- **Error Extraction**: Parse error messages from the backend response:
  ```typescript
  const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({}));
  const message = errorData.error?.message || "Request failed";
  throw new Error(message);
  ```
- **API Format**: Backend errors follow `{ success: false, error: { code, message } }`.
- **Validation**: Use Zod schemas for request body validation.

#### React Patterns (Web & Mobile)

- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks.
- **Ref Forwarding**: Use `forwardRef` for UI components:
  ```typescript
  export const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(...)
  ```
- **Styling**:
  - **Web**: Tailwind CSS utility classes with `cn()` helper. Avoid inline styles.
  - **Mobile**: `StyleSheet.create()` for native components. Use theme constants from `@magicappdev/shared`.
- **Context**: Use React Context for global state (Auth, Theme).

#### Database & API (Cloudflare)

- **Drizzle**: Define schemas in `packages/database/src/schema/`. Export the combined schema object in `index.ts`.
- **Hono API**: Use the middleware pattern for auth: `app.use("/path/*", authMiddleware)`.
- **Auth**: Access the authenticated user via `c.get("userId")` in Hono.
- **Environment**: Access variables through `c.env` (e.g., `c.env.DB`, `c.env.JWT_SECRET`).

#### Comments

- **Minimalism**: Write self-documenting code. Use comments only for "why", not "what".
- **JSDoc**: Use sparingly for complex exported utilities.

### 3. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Framework**: Vitest is used for unit and integration tests.
- **Execution**: Run `pnpm test` to execute all tests in the workspace.
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions runs linting, typechecking, and tests on every push.
- **Pre-commit Workflow**: Husky and lint-staged ensure code quality before commits.
