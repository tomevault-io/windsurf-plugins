# AGENTS.md — rules for AI agents working on mcptoon

Any AI agent (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, DSH, ...) writing code, docs, or cutting
releases in this repo follows the rules on this page. They exist because mcptoon is
now carried by external automation: numtide/llm-agents.nix packages this project and
an official bot auto-bumps it on every PyPI release. A careless release breaks that
channel; these rules keep it clean. Human contributors: see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Hard rules

1. **Zero dependencies, always.** The `dependencies` field in `pyproject.toml` stays
   empty. Standard library only. CI enforces this via `scripts/check_zero_deps.py` —
   treat a red zero-deps job as a broken build, not a suggestion.
2. **Tests gate every change.** New behavior ships with tests in `tests/`. Run
   `python -m pytest tests/` and paste the real green output before claiming done.
3. **Windows is a first-class target.** Anything touching paths, subprocess, or npx
   must work on Windows; the CI matrix runs it on every PR.
4. **Conventional Commits** for every commit (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`).

## Release discipline

A release is complete only when all five land together:

1. version bumped in `pyproject.toml`
2. `CHANGELOG.md` entry written for the new version
3. full test suite green
4. git tag `vX.Y.Z` pushed
5. PyPI publish green (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`)

The numtide bot turns PyPI releases into Nix bump PRs automatically. A version that
exists on main but not on PyPI (or the reverse) leaves a broken bump in that channel.
Breaking changes must land as deprecation warnings one minor version before removal.

Details that bit us during v0.7.4 (2026-09-05), so they are now part of the ritual:

- **The version lives in five places.** `pyproject.toml`, `server.json`
  (twice: top level and `packages[]`), the hardcoded `__version__` in
  `src/mcptoon/__init__.py`, and `gemini-extension.json`. 0.7.6 shipped with
  `mcptoon --version` printing 0.7.5 because the last one was missed — caught
  only by the post-release smoke test. `tests/test_registry_sync.py` pins the
  registry set and `tests/test_gemini_manifest.py` pins the extension; update
  every one on every bump and run both suites green.
- **The publish workflows used to race each other.** `publish.yml` and
  `publish-mcp.yml` start on the same release event; the registry run
  validated the PyPI version while the wheel was still uploading and failed
  with 400. This happened on both 0.7.6 and 0.7.7. Root cause fixed in
  `publish-mcp.yml`: a wait step now polls PyPI's JSON API for the released
  version (up to 5 minutes) before pushing the registry record. If the wait
  step ever times out, retry with `gh workflow run publish-mcp.yml -f reason=...`.
- **Pushing a tag does not publish.** `publish.yml` triggers on `release: [published]`,
  so a GitHub Release must be created (`gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes-file …`).
- **Verify against the real index.** This machine's pip points at a mirror that lags —
  and its global `ALL_PROXY=socks5://` breaks fresh venvs (no PySocks). Confirm a fresh
  release with a clean venv, proxy vars cleared:
  `python -m venv .scratch/check && .scratch/check/Scripts/python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ mcptoon`,
  then run `mcptoon --version` from that venv and compare with the tag.
- **Run the lint job locally** (`python -m ruff check src/mcptoon/ tests/`, ruff 0.15.20)
  before pushing — unpushed commits never see CI, and one UP037 turned the release red.
- **Update the `Tests-<n> passed` badges** in `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` (and the
  matching comment in their contributor sections) to the suite total of the release.
- **The MCP Registry record used to be pushed by hand.** 0.7.0 and 0.7.2 were published
  from a laptop; 0.7.3–0.7.5 never reached it, and `server.json`'s package version had
  drifted a release behind its own top-level version. `publish-mcp.yml` now publishes on
  every release, and `tests/test_registry_sync.py` fails CI if the versions, the
  `mcp-name:` marker in the PyPI README, or the workflow drift apart. Do not remove that
  marker when rewriting the README — it is invisible when rendered and load-bearing.

## Ecosystem channel ledger

What mcptoon has earned externally, and the standing obligation each one creates:

| Channel | Standing | Our obligation |
|---|---|---|
| numtide/llm-agents.nix | S-tier: packaged; bot auto-follows since init PR #7839 (zimbatm) | Release discipline above; after each release, confirm the bot PR merged |
| PyPI | every release | publish workflow green before announcing |
| MCP Registry (`server.json`) | listed; published automatically by `.github/workflows/publish-mcp.yml` on every release (OIDC) | keep `server.json` in sync — CI enforces the versions, the `mcp-name:` README marker and the workflow itself via `tests/test_registry_sync.py` |
| apify/mcpc client comparison | listed in comparison table | none — leave the table alone |
| awesome-mcp-clients PR #283 | pending | do not nag maintainers until ≥500 stars |
| striki18/benchmark | third-party benchmark harness running mcptoon | external repo — read for intel, do not touch |
