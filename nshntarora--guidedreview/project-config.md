# AGENTS.md

Chrome MV3 extension: GitHub PR diff → user's LLM → ordered **review units** in a Shadow DOM overlay. pnpm workspaces, Node ≥ 22.

| Path             | What                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/extension` | Chrome MV3 product — load unpacked from **`apps/extension/dist` only**       |
| `apps/cli`       | Local git review — CLI server + browser UI                                   |
| `apps/web`       | Marketing + docs (Next.js static export → `out/`)                            |
| `packages/core`  | Review engine — parse, cluster, summarise, providers; no `chrome.*` or React |
| `packages/ui`    | Shared tokens/UI — source-only; no `chrome.*` or extension imports           |

## Import aliases

Prefer absolute imports over deep `../../` relatives:

| Alias                 | Resolves to            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `@extension/*`        | `apps/extension/src/*` |
| `@web/*`              | `apps/web/*`           |
| `@guided-review/core` | `packages/core/src`    |

Same-directory `./foo` is fine. Cross-folder imports should use the alias.

## Commands

`pnpm dev` · `dev:web` · `dev:cli` · `build` · `build:extension` · `build:cli` · `typecheck` · `test` · `test:e2e` · `test:e2e:web` · `test:e2e:cli` · `lint` · `format`

After CLI edits: `pnpm --filter @guided-review/cli test`, then `pnpm build:cli && pnpm review`. Published npm package is `@guided-review/cli` (`npx @guided-review/cli`). `npx guided-review` is a different tool.

After extension edits: `build:extension`, reload in `chrome://extensions`, refresh the PR tab. Tests live next to source (`*.test.*`); e2e under each app's `e2e/`.

## Extension

Contexts talk only via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`: **content** (DOM/overlay), **background** (fetch/keys/LLM), **options**. Types: `src/lib/types.ts`.

**Pipeline:** `parseDiff` → `buildPrompt` (chunk by file, never split a file) → `annotateReview` → overlay from the **real** diff. The engine lives in `@guided-review/core`; the extension is a GitHub host on top of it.

**Invariant:** LLM plans structure + commentary only; never supplies code shown to the user.

Sessions: `chrome.storage.session`, key `owner/repo#number` (`buildSessionKey`). Providers: `@guided-review/core` (`ProviderClient`).

## packages/ui · apps/web

- **ui:** transpile via `transpilePackages`. Tokens `@guided-review/ui/theme.css`. Tailwind v4 that uses ui must `@source packages/ui/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`.
- **review UI:** `@guided-review/ui/review` contains the overlay, store, and host contract. GitHub, CLI, and the landing preview supply their own hosts; shared review code must not import from an app. Import `review/styles/review.css` alongside the theme in a document, or `review/styles/overlay.css?inline` for the extension Shadow DOM.
- **web:** docs MDX in `content/help/`, legal in `content/legal/`. Register every docs page in `config/docs.ts` (sidebar, routes, metadata, sitemap).

## Building UI

- There might already exist some components which we should use before we go ahead and use native elements or build our own. For example, always use the Button component instead of using the <button> element directly. If a relevant component exists but it needs significant rewrite to support the new change confirm the change with the user.
- Think about accessibility and make sure all components we create are accessible.

## Tailwind

- Tokens live in `@guided-review/ui/theme.css`. Use semantic utilities (`bg-background`, `text-muted`, `text-warning`) — not raw hex or one-off arbitrary colors.
- Prefer utilities. Custom CSS only when Tailwind cannot own the markup (Shadow DOM reset, highlight.js, `.markdown-body`, MDX/legal prose, grain `::before`). Import the theme once; it already pulls in Tailwind.
- Text links use the document chrome (`a:not(.inline-flex)` → accent + bottom border on hover). Button-looking anchors use `buttonClassName`. No `cva` / `@apply`. Do not reconstruct `Button` when it already matches.

## Voice

Match `apps/web` landing copy — peer engineer, specific, dry.

- AI **structures** the review; humans decide. Never auto-approve / "reviews for you."
- BYO key; no product backend. Traffic: GitHub + user's provider only.
- Name **Guided Review**. CTA **Start Guided Review**. Terms: review units, cluster, overlay, keyboard-first.
- Errors: what failed + what to try. No SaaS clichés or overclaiming model accuracy.

## Tests

Goal is **not** coverage. Goal is the fewest tests that still give confidence to ship. Every test is guilty until proven useful; if deleting it does not reduce shipping confidence, delete it. Prefer one meaningful integration test over ten tiny implementation tests.

**Unit:** test observable business logic, not rendering or React internals. Avoid mocks unless isolation is required.
**E2E:** executable journeys a user would care about. Do not E2E static marketing pages, "button exists," or exact wording.
**a11y:** interactive paths only (keyboard, focus trap, dialogs, forms) — not decorative markup.
