# AgentRuntime Guide

`Sources/AgentRuntime/` is the orchestration core. All types are `actor`-based for concurrency safety.

## Component overview

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `RuntimeSystem.swift` | Facade — entry point for CoreService to start/stop sessions and workers |
| `WorkerRuntime.swift` | Executes a single agent worker loop |
| `ChannelRuntime.swift` | Manages a channel session lifecycle |
| `BranchRuntime.swift` | Manages a branched sub-session |
| `EventBus.swift` | Pub/sub event routing between runtime components |
| `Visor.swift` | Observes and records runtime state snapshots |
| `Compactor.swift` | Compresses long conversation history |
| `MemoryStore.swift` | In-memory session state |

## RuntimeSystem — primary interface

`CoreService` accesses the runtime exclusively through `RuntimeSystem`:

```swift
// Start a session
await runtime.startSession(agentID: agentID, sessionID: sessionID, config: config)

// Stop a session
await runtime.stopSession(sessionID: sessionID)

// Send a message into a channel
await runtime.deliverMessage(channelID: channelID, message: message)
```

Do not reach into individual `WorkerRuntime` or `ChannelRuntime` actors directly from outside `AgentRuntime`.

## EventBus

Inter-component communication uses `EventBus`. Publish typed events; subscribe with a handler closure:

```swift
// publish
await eventBus.publish(SomeEvent(sessionID: sessionID, payload: data))

// subscribe (within an actor)
await eventBus.subscribe(to: SomeEvent.self) { event in
    // handle
}
```

## Visor

`Visor` periodically snapshots worker state. It is read-only from outside — `CoreService` calls `await runtime.visorSnapshot()` to get the current state. Do not write to Visor directly.

## Concurrency rules

- All `AgentRuntime` actors use `async`/`await`. No locks, no `DispatchQueue`.
- Data passed between actors must be `Sendable`. Use value types (`struct`) for all cross-actor payloads.
- Never capture `actor`-isolated mutable state in a detached `Task` without re-isolating.

## Testing AgentRuntime

Tests in `Tests/AgentRuntimeTests/` instantiate `RuntimeSystem` directly with injected fakes. See `RuntimeFlowTests.swift` for the setup pattern.

Run:
```bash
swift test --filter AgentRuntimeTests
```
