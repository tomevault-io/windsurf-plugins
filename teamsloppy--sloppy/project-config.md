# Swift Testing Conventions

## Framework

This project uses **Swift Testing** — not XCTest. Always import:

```swift
import Testing
@testable import sloppy       // or the module under test
@testable import Protocols
```

## Test declaration

```swift
// Simple test function (no suite)
@Test
func projectRecordDefaultsToNotArchived() throws {
    let record = ProjectRecord(id: "x", name: "X", description: "", channels: [], tasks: [])
    #expect(record.isArchived == false)
}

// Grouped in a suite
@Suite
struct XxxTests {
    @Test
    func createsSuccessfully() async throws {
        // arrange
        let service = makeCoreService()
        // act
        let result = try await service.createXxx(request: .init(name: "test"))
        // assert
        #expect(result.name == "test")
    }
}
```

## Assertion macros

```swift
#expect(value == expected)
#expect(throws: XxxError.notFound) { try doSomething() }
#expect(collection.count == 3)
```

For async throwing code:
```swift
await #expect(throws: CoreService.ProjectError.notFound) {
    try await service.getProject(id: "missing")
}
```

## Test file location

| Module under test | Test target |
|---|---|
| `Sources/sloppy/**` | `Tests/sloppyTests/` |
| `Sources/AgentRuntime/**` | `Tests/AgentRuntimeTests/` |
| `Sources/Protocols/**` | `Tests/ProtocolsTests/` |

Name test files after the component they test: `XxxTests.swift`.

## Running tests

```bash
# Run only a specific test suite
swift test --filter sloppyTests.XxxTests

# Run a single test by exact name
swift test --filter sloppyTests.XxxTests.createsSuccessfully

# Run a whole test group (e.g. all CoreTests)
swift test --filter CoreTests
```

Never run `swift test` without `--filter` unless verifying the full suite — prefer targeted runs.

## Test setup helpers

A shared helper for creating a `CoreService` with in-memory stores lives in `Tests/sloppyTests/CoreConfig+Testing.swift`. Prefer reusing it over duplicating setup logic.

## Test isolation

- Each test must be independent — no shared mutable state between tests.
- Use fresh service instances per test case.
- Avoid `sleep` / `Task.sleep` in tests; prefer deterministic async flows.
