# CoreService Guide

`Sources/sloppy/CoreService.swift` is an `actor` (~8551 lines, 337 functions). It is the central business logic layer between the HTTP routers and the runtime/persistence layer.

## Architecture position

```
Transport (CoreHTTPServer)
  → Router (CoreRouter / XxxAPIRouter)
    → CoreService  ← you are here
      → SQLiteStore (PersistenceStore)
      → RuntimeSystem (AgentRuntime)
```

## Domain sections (MARK map)

| Section | Approx. line |
|---|---|
| Gateway Plugin Lifecycle | ~455 |
| Cron Tasks | ~943 |
| Task Clarifications | ~1518 |
| Skills | ~2255 |
| Channel Plugins | ~2470 |
| Review Flow | ~5344 |
| Task Comments | ~5574 |
| Task Activity | ~5643 |
| Channel Access Approvals | ~7827 |
| Channel Model | ~7903 |
| InboundMessageReceiver | ~8059 |
| ProjectToolService conformance | ~8339 |
| Debug API | ~8387 |

Use `swift test --filter` or editor search to jump directly to the relevant MARK section.

## Adding a new method

1. Find the correct domain section by MARK header.
2. CoreService is an `actor` — all methods are implicitly `@isolated`. Call site must `await`.
3. Access persistence via `store` (`any PersistenceStore`), runtime via `runtime` (`RuntimeSystem`).
4. Throw typed domain errors, not generic ones:

```swift
enum XxxError: Error {
    case notFound
    case invalidState(String)
}

func getXxx(id: String) async throws -> XxxRecord {
    guard let record = await store.fetchXxx(id: id) else {
        throw XxxError.notFound
    }
    return record
}
```

5. Do not add `public` unless the method is part of a protocol conformance declared in another module.

## Protocols CoreService conforms to

- `ProjectToolService` — project/task operations used by agent tools (see ~line 8339)
- `RuntimeConfigToolService` — runtime config read/write
- `SkillsToolService` — skills registry operations
- `InboundMessageReceiver` — channel message delivery (~line 8059)

When adding operations that tools need, add to the relevant protocol in `Sources/sloppy/Tools/AgentTools/CoreTool.swift`.

## Do not read the whole file

The file is too large to read in full. Use:
- `rg "func methodName"` to jump to a function
- `rg "// MARK:" Sources/sloppy/CoreService.swift` to see domain sections
- Read only the relevant section (50–150 lines around the target)
