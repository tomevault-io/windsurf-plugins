# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents working in Panerelay.

## Project phase

Panerelay publishes lockstep stable and beta releases. Its Extension connection, Codex/Qoder side-panel providers, cross-platform setup flow, and browser-level agent-browser Provider are available for development and release-candidate testing.

Read the relevant documents in `docs/rfcs/` before changing browser attachment, CDP behavior, agent sessions, permissions, control ownership, or other cross-package boundaries. RFC-0001 and RFC-0002 are accepted. Keep accepted decisions stable unless a new RFC explicitly supersedes them.

## Package management

- Use pnpm.
- Require Node.js 20.19 or newer for workspace development. Published runtime packages keep a Node.js 20 or newer compatibility floor.
- Keep publishable packages under the `@panerelay` npm scope.
- Add applications under `apps/` and reusable packages under `packages/`.

## Architectural boundaries

- Keep browser automation semantics in automation engines such as agent-browser.
- Keep browser-specific and agent-provider-specific behavior outside the shared protocol.
- The Bridge is the local routing and policy boundary.
- The Extension must not store model credentials or spawn native agent processes.
- Protocol identifiers are opaque; do not expose raw Chrome tab IDs as stable public IDs.

## Security invariants

- Site permission and tab control are separate decisions.
- Focus never grants authorization.
- Mutating actions require a current control lease.
- Controlled state and revocation must remain visible and available to the user.
- Unsupported or unauthorized actions fail closed.
- Do not log page content, cookies, credentials, prompts, screenshots, or request bodies by default.
- Bind local services to loopback or user-scoped operating-system transports.

## Documentation

- Update the relevant RFC when implementation changes an accepted architecture or protocol decision.
- Record meaningful alternatives and compatibility limitations.
- Commit RFCs with the implementation they govern. `docs/rfcs/` is the durable record for cross-cutting architecture, protocol, security, and ownership decisions.
- Commit spike reports and source fixtures when they make a technical conclusion reproducible. `docs/spikes/` is for bounded experiments, compatibility probes, and their reusable test pages.
- Do not commit generated screenshots, browser logs, credentials, or machine-specific verification output. Store those outside the repository and link or summarize the result when useful.
- Keep version-specific integration coverage in `docs/compatibility/`.
- Use current-state comments in code; do not narrate changes from previous implementations.

## Change workflow

OpenSpec and RFCs serve different scopes:

- An OpenSpec change, when OpenSpec is present, describes one unit of product or engineering work: intent, behavior deltas, design, tasks, and verification.
- An RFC records a decision that must remain understandable and authoritative across many future changes.
- A spike reduces uncertainty before either document claims a design is viable.

For non-trivial work:

1. Read the relevant accepted RFCs and compatibility documents.
2. If `openspec/` exists, or the user explicitly requests OpenSpec, create or continue one focused OpenSpec change before implementation. Keep its proposal, specs, design, and tasks aligned with discoveries made during coding.
3. Use a spike first when browser or third-party behavior is uncertain and a small executable probe can answer the question.
4. Add or update an RFC when the work introduces or changes a durable cross-package architecture, protocol, security, permission, or ownership decision. Link the OpenSpec change and RFC instead of duplicating their full content.
5. Implement and validate against explicit acceptance criteria. Update compatibility matrices for version-dependent integrations.
6. Archive an OpenSpec change only after its implementation and verification are complete. Mark an RFC `Implemented` only when its code has been released, not merely merged or tested locally.
7. When the user asks to commit a completed OpenSpec-backed change, sync its delta specs into the main specs, archive the change, and include the archive result in the commit unless the user explicitly asks to keep the change active.
8. When the user asks to archive a completed OpenSpec change, validate it and commit the archive result together with any synced main-spec updates unless the user explicitly asks not to commit yet.

Small fixes, dependency maintenance, formatting, and documentation corrections do not require an OpenSpec change or a new RFC unless they alter specified behavior or an accepted decision.

## Validation

At minimum:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run check
git diff --check
```

During development, use `pnpm run format`, `pnpm run lint:fix`, and package-scoped typechecks or tests for faster feedback. Run the full check before finishing.

## Git

- Use Conventional Commit messages written in English.
- Keep commits scoped to one coherent change.
- Do not publish packages or create releases unless explicitly requested.
