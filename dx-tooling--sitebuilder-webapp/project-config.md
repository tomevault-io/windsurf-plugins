# Rule Acknowledgment

**CRITICAL**: Before starting any task, you MUST explicitly acknowledge which rules from this `.cursor/rules/` folder apply to the current work.

## Required Format

At the start of your response, state:

```
**Applying rules**: [list of rule file names that are relevant]
```

Examples:
- `**Applying rules**: 00-rule-acknowledgment.md, 01-architecture-boundaries.md, 02-code-standards.md`
- `**Applying rules**: 00-rule-acknowledgment.md, 03-type-safety.md, 05-frontend.md`

## When to Acknowledge

- **Always** acknowledge at least `00-rule-acknowledgment.md` itself
- Acknowledge all rules that are relevant to the task at hand
- If unsure, err on the side of acknowledging more rules rather than fewer
- Re-acknowledge when switching between different types of work (e.g., from backend to frontend)

## Purpose

This rule ensures:
1. You are aware of the applicable constraints
2. The user can verify you're following the right guidelines
3. Rule violations can be traced back to acknowledged rules
