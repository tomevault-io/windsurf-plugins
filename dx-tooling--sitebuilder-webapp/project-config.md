## PLAN FORMAT

EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) is used in plans for specifying *system behavior* (requirements), not for describing the agent's implementation to-do list.

Use the structure below for code-change plans.

### REQUIREMENTS FORMAT (EARS)

Write compact, testable requirements about the system/component under change (not the agent). Name the system explicitly (e.g. `InkNewWizard`, `bep new`, `WizardState`).

- Ubiquitous (always true): `The <system> shall <response>.`
- State-driven: `While <precondition(s)>, the <system> shall <response>.`
- Event-driven: `When <trigger>, the <system> shall <response>.`
- Optional feature/scope: `Where <feature/scope applies>, the <system> shall <response>.`
- Unwanted behavior: `If <unwanted condition>, then the <system> shall <mitigation>.`
- Complex: `While <precondition(s)>, when <trigger>, the <system> shall <response>.`

Practical rules:

- Use requirement IDs (`R1`, `R2`, ...) so implementation and verification can reference them.
- Prefer observable behavior and invariants; avoid file/function names unless they are part of the external contract.

### IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FORMAT

Describe *how* you'll satisfy the requirements as concrete steps (agent actions), chunked into small git-committable units when appropriate.

- Size the steps to the change: use as few steps as needed for small fixes, and break larger changes into multiple git-committable chunks.
- Keep one concrete outcome per step (code change, test addition, verification, or user checkpoint).
- Include a USER checkpoint step for major or risky changes, consistent with the workflow above.

### VERIFICATION FORMAT

Include explicit checks that map back to the requirements.

- Each verification item should reference one or more requirement IDs (`R#`) and name the check (`npm test`, `npm run build`, or targeted manual validation).

Template (shape only):

- Requirements:
- `R1: When <trigger>, the <system> shall <response>.`
- `R2: While <state>, the <system> shall <response>.`
- Implementation:
- `S1: <edit(s) that satisfy R1/R2>.`
- `S2: USER checkpoint: review/commit chunk 1.`
- Verification:
- `V1 (R1,R2): npm test`
