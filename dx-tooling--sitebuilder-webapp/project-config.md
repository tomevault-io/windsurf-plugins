# Architecture and Vertical Boundaries

**Reference**: See `docs/archbook.md` for complete architecture documentation.

## Vertical Structure

- Each feature is a **vertical** (top-level folder under `src/`)
- Verticals contain layers: `Domain/`, `Facade/`, `Infrastructure/`, `Api/`, `Presentation/`
- `Common/` is a shared vertical for cross-cutting concerns (excluded from boundary tests)

## Cross-Vertical Communication

**CRITICAL RULE**: Verticals can only communicate through **Facades**.

- ✅ **Allowed**: `App\Foo\Domain\Service` → uses `App\Bar\Facade\BarFacadeInterface`
- ❌ **Forbidden**: `App\Foo\Domain\Service` → uses `App\Bar\Domain\Entity`
- ❌ **Forbidden**: `App\Foo\Presentation\Controller` → uses `App\Bar\Domain\Service`

## Facade Usage

- Facades expose **interfaces** and **DTOs** in `Facade/` namespace
- Facades are for **cross-vertical** use only
- Within the same vertical, use Domain services directly
- Facade implementations are thin orchestrators

## Layer Responsibilities

- **Facade**: Interfaces + DTOs + orchestration for other verticals
- **Domain**: Entities, enums, value objects, domain services, repositories (pure business logic)
- **Infrastructure**: External integrations, adapters
- **Api**: HTTP endpoints, serialization, request/response DTOs
- **Presentation**: Controllers, UI services, Twig templates, UX components

## When Creating New Features

1. Create a new vertical: `src/FeatureName/`
2. Add layers as needed (not all verticals need all layers)
3. Only add a `Facade/` when another vertical needs to access this feature
4. Keep `Common/` small and for truly cross-cutting concerns only

## Boundary Enforcement

The architecture test (`tests/Architecture/FeatureBoundariesArchTest.php`) enforces these rules. If you violate boundaries, the test will fail.
