# Agent Guidelines for Silverfir-nano

## Dev CI soft-fail is not a pass

Jobs in `.github/workflows/performance-regression.yml` use
`continue-on-error` on `dev/**` branches only to suppress GitHub failure email
during rapid development. A failed step or an `ACTION REQUIRED` / `SOFT-FAIL`
summary on a dev branch is still a real CI failure that must be investigated
and corrected.

Never describe such a run as passing, green, acceptable, or complete. Inspect
the individual job steps and summaries rather than relying on the workflow's
overall conclusion. Pull requests and `main` remain hard-fail gates.

## Warnings and lint suppressions

Correctness has one behavior: every compiler warning fails `ci/correctness.py`;
there is no strict/lenient switch. Performance jobs may continue compiling so
they can finish measuring, but must leave warnings visible and mark the
warning audit as action-required. CI runs `ci/lint_policy.py`
before either workflow; it rejects unreviewed `allow` / `expect` attributes
for `warnings`, `dead_code`, and `unused*`, lint-lowering compiler flags or
Cargo lint settings, and stale exception entries.

Fix the cause. Remove genuinely dead code and unnecessary fields or imports.
Do not add `#[allow(dead_code)]`, `#[allow(unused)]`, broad `cfg` gates,
underscore/`let _` band-aids, or edit `ci/lint_suppressions.toml` merely
to get a green run. A new exception requires an explicit human design decision
and an inline reason.

`reason = "..."` is not a fix. The policy script exists to expose every
suppression so it gets fixed properly — deleted, restructured, or gated
precisely — and annotating a finding with a reason merely launders it
through the audit, however accurate the reason reads.

The checker cannot stop you. An inline `reason` is all it requires, and it
cannot tell a reviewed exception from an invented one: a plausible sentence
is exactly what an agent would write. It guarantees only that every
suppression is stated and greppable. So this rule, not the tool, is what
holds — agents never author a `reason=` attribute on their own judgment,
however true the reason would be, and each exception is blessed by the user
individually, site by site. "The audit passes now" is not evidence the
suppression was warranted.

`ci/lint_suppressions.toml` is only for attribute positions that cannot
carry an inline reason; an entry there claims no inline reason is possible,
and is not a second place to record an ordinary exception. When you do have
approval, make the reason checkable: name the build or cfg in which the item
is unreachable and how you verified it. A finding with no visible proper fix
is left red and reported as a question, not made green.

## cfg follows meaning

Use each `sf_*` cfg only for what it means: `sf_backend_*` for per-ISA
surface, `sf_ir_dump`/`sf_jitdump`/`sf_call_trace` for JIT debug tooling,
`sf_has_*` for target capabilities — anywhere that meaning applies.
`sf_jit`/`sf_interp` mean "one engine's own code": the engines split at a
few declared gates (module declarations, engine selector, instance
dispatch, exports) and are on their own past it. Engine-only code found
in a shared file is misplaced — move it into the engine's subtree; never
gate it in place with `sf_jit`/`sf_interp`.

When warnings cluster only in a feature combination and suggest unclear
engine ownership or shared-runtime architecture, keep the CI failure visible
and report the cluster. Do not turn every diagnostic into a local suppression;
the architecture must be decided first.

A red warning audit is not blanket authorization to edit the affected code.
First reproduce and group every diagnostic by configuration and likely owner.
The default result of that audit is a report with the failures left intact.
Only fix an item immediately when it is clearly local, has no ownership or
feature-boundary implications, and does not require new `cfg` structure.
