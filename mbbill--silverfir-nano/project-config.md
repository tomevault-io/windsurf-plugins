# Claude Code Guidelines for Silverfir-nano

## Dev CI soft-fail is not a pass

Jobs in `.github/workflows/performance-regression.yml` use
`continue-on-error` on `dev/**` branches only to suppress GitHub failure email
during rapid development. A failed step or an `ACTION REQUIRED` / `SOFT-FAIL`
summary on a dev branch is still a real CI failure that must be investigated
and corrected.

Never describe such a run as passing, green, acceptable, or complete. Inspect
the individual job steps and summaries rather than relying on the workflow's
overall conclusion. Pull requests and `main` remain hard-fail gates.

## When implementation hits obstacles, stop and discuss

When implementing an agreed design, if you run into a structural problem that
forces a deviation from the plan — a dependency you didn't account for, a
signature change that cascades too widely, or a workaround that compromises the
design — **stop and discuss** instead of silently working around it.

Do not:
- Silently diverge into workarounds (RefCell hacks, threading extra params, etc.)
- Make increasingly invasive changes trying to force the original plan to work
- Revert back and forth when approaches don't pan out
- Suppress problems with `#[allow(dead_code)]` or `let _ = ...` instead of
  removing dead code properly

Instead, state clearly: "I hit [specific problem]. The original plan assumed X
but actually Y. Here are the options I see." Then wait for direction.

The user has deep context about the design. A short discussion often reveals a
simpler solution that workarounds would never reach.

## Do not suppress warnings or errors with band-aids

Correctness has one warning behavior: `ci/correctness.py` always fails when a
compiler warning appears. There is no `--strict` mode and no warning-ignore
mode. Performance builds may compile through a warning so measurement can
still finish, but the warning must remain visible and its audit is
action-required. CI also runs `ci/lint_policy.py`, which rejects
unreviewed `allow` / `expect` attributes for `warnings`, `dead_code`, and
`unused*`, compiler flags or Cargo lint settings that lower those lints, and
stale exception entries.

When fixing a warning or build error, do not blindly add `_` prefixes,
`#[allow(dead_code)]`, `#[allow(unused)]`, or — worst case — `unsafe` blocks
just to make the compiler quiet. These hide real problems.

If code is unused, remove it. If a parameter is unused, remove it from the
signature and fix the call sites. If you believe a suppression is genuinely
the right call, always ask the user for permission first and explain why.
Do not add or modify `ci/lint_suppressions.toml` merely to make CI green.
That file records human-reviewed exceptional compilation boundaries; it is
not an agent-owned allowlist.

### `reason = "..."` is not a fix — never annotate your way past the audit

`ci/lint_policy.py` exists to EXPOSE every `allow`/`expect` hack so it gets
fixed **properly**: delete the dead code, restructure so the code is not
dead, or gate it precisely. Responding to an audit finding by writing an
inline `reason = "..."` fixes nothing — it launders the hack through the
audit's escape hatch and neuters the tool. This applies no matter how
accurate or well-written the reason is.

**Read this next part carefully, because the tool cannot enforce it.** An
inline `reason` is all the checker requires: write one and the audit goes
green. It cannot tell a reviewed exception from one an agent invented,
because a plausible sentence is exactly what an agent would produce. The
checker guarantees only that every suppression is *stated and greppable*.
The rest is this rule, and review.

Hard rules:

- An agent NEVER writes a `reason = "..."` attribute on its own judgment —
  not even for sites it believes are legitimate boundaries, not even when
  the reason it would write is true, and not even when the user has
  approved a cleanup task in general terms. Each exception is blessed by
  the user individually, site by site. "The audit passes now" is not
  evidence that the suppression was warranted.
- The same rule covers `ci/lint_suppressions.toml`, which exists only for
  attribute positions that cannot carry an inline reason at all. Adding an
  entry there is a claim that no inline reason is possible; it is not a
  second place to record an ordinary exception.
- A finding with no proper fix you can see is left RED and reported as a
  question. A red audit is the ratchet working; making it green without
  fixing the cause is the failure mode this file exists to prevent.
- When you do get approval, the reason must be *checkable*: name the build
  or cfg in which the item is unreachable, and how that was verified. A
  reason that cannot be falsified is how a stale suppression outlives the
  thing it was added for.

If a feature-only build exposes a cluster of dead code that points to unclear
engine ownership, shared runtime state, or another architecture question,
leave the failure visible and report the cluster. Do not scatter `cfg`,
`expect`, or manifest entries across individual items before the ownership
decision is made.

Treat a failing warning audit as a request to reproduce and classify the
diagnostics, not as blanket authorization to edit every reported item. Leave
