# Repository guidance

`pmndrs/glyph` is an ESM-only monorepo for portable font baking, universal shaping, paragraph layout, and optional raster renderers. The benchmark application lives at `benches/`. Other packages and applications belong under `packages/` or `apps/`.

Before writing or reviewing Rust, TypeScript, React, Wasm boundaries, or tests, read the canonical [engineering standard](.agents/docs/engineering/code-style.md). Use the repository-local `maintainability-review` skill for a deliberate cleanup, pre-release review, or milestone-wide audit; the skill owns the procedure, while the engineering standard owns the rules.

Classify validation by who can author the value, not by module, package, Worker, language, or Wasm crossings. Validate
public caller input, third-party callback results, and genuinely external data once; retain raw memory-safety and work
bounds. Trust package-owned TypeScript/Rust/baker/serializer/Worker output and prove it at the producer with unit, ABI,
property, fuzz, and product tests. Never justify a runtime guard with a test that forges an internal value no production
caller can supply. During validation cleanup, remove one internal check, strengthen its producer proof, run the focused
test, and then continue.

Use the repository-local `tsl` skill before implementing or reviewing Three.js Shading Language materials, compute work, post-processing, or GLSL-to-TSL migrations. Verify examples against the repository's installed Three.js version rather than relying on remembered APIs.

Use the repository-local `engine-call-contract` skill before adding, moving, or removing anything on a published entry point, before giving an engine call an error path or a result type, and when deciding whether a failure belongs to the caller or to this package. It carries the two rules the API is built on: a call answers or throws where it was written, and application-encountered values and types live at the root while integrator construction helpers live on `/core`.

Use the vendored `typegpu` skill from TypeGPU's own maintainers before writing or reviewing TypeGPU shaders, buffers, bind groups, or pipelines, exactly as the `tsl` skill governs Three.js Shading Language work. It was installed with the upstream installer (`skills add software-mansion-labs/skills -s typegpu`) and targets TypeGPU 0.12, matching the pinned dependency. Its `references/` cover shaders, textures, types, pipelines, and the standard library.

Use the repository-local `gh-stack` skill for every dependent branch or pull-request workflow. Root stacks on the remote
default branch and preserve their state through non-interactive `gh stack` commands; ordinary push and PR commands are
not substitutes.

Consult the repository-local `evidence-first` skill as the default style guidance for human-facing engineering communication, including chat updates and final answers, reports, reviews, handoffs, PR and issue prose, READMEs, and technical documentation. It offers situational cues rather than a fixed template. Domain skills still determine the work and valid evidence, `open-knowledge-format` governs bundle structure and provenance, and `diataxis-docs` governs the purpose and top-level structure of reader-facing documentation.

Start at `.agents/docs/index.md` and follow its linked indexes for self-discovery. Use these canonical sources instead of creating shadow plans or duplicate status prose:

- `.agents/docs/roadmap/roadmap.md` for milestone order and checkbox status;
- `.agents/docs/planning/decision-register.md` for architectural decisions;
- `.agents/docs/packages/*.md` for current package ownership, boundaries, and evidence;
- `.agents/docs/log.md` for knowledge-bundle chronology.

Update affected canonical documentation in the same change as source. Package source or configuration changes require reviewing the matching package concept, re-pinning its `source_digest` with `mise exec -- pnpm scripts run docs:update`, and verifying with `mise exec -- pnpm scripts run docs:check`.

Use the exact root toolchain pins through mise. Agent commands must enter that environment explicitly with `mise exec -- pnpm ...` or `mise exec -- <tool> ...`; do not depend on `mise activate` surviving across non-interactive commands. Mise owns tool selection, while pnpm remains the only repository workflow surface. Install workload-scoped mise tools only when their documented pnpm workflow requires them. The dated nightly under `packages/glyph/rust/font-baker-fuzz` is isolated to cargo-fuzz. Verify narrowly first, then run the relevant package and repository checks. Keep tests deterministic; do not use sleeps, timer cushions, arbitrary retries, or regenerated goldens as correctness mechanisms.
