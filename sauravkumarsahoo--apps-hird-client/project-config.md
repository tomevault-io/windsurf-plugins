# GitHub Copilot Instructions — HIRD Client

## Project Overview

**HIRD** (HWiNFO Remote Display) Client is a Flutter mobile app (Android + iOS) that
streams real-time PC hardware sensor data from the
[HIRD Server](https://github.com/clicksrv/Apps.HIRD.Server) over a local Wi-Fi network.
Communication uses **gRPC with Protocol Buffers**. The app discovers servers by scanning
the local subnet, lets the user pick one, then displays a live-updating dashboard of CPU,
GPU, RAM, storage, and system readings.

## Architecture & Data Flow

1. **Startup**: `main.dart` checks network connectivity. Wi-Fi or Ethernet → `SelectServerPage`;
   anything else → `NoConnectivityPage`.
2. **Server Discovery**: `ServerScannerService` (singleton via factory constructor) starts a
   periodic LAN ping scan (`ping_discover_network`) on port `25151`. Each discovered IP gets a
   gRPC `getComputerInfo` call. Results are emitted over a broadcast stream.
3. **Server Selection**: `SelectServerPage` is a `StreamBuilder` on
   `ServerScannerService.stream`. Tapping a server navigates to `DataVisualizerPage`.
4. **Live Dashboard**: `DataVisualizerPage` calls `SensorServiceClient.monitor()` and wraps
   the response stream in a `StreamBuilder`. On each tick, five expandable cards rebuild:
   CPU, GPU, RAM, System, Storage. The stream has a 10-second timeout per call.
5. **Theme**: `animated_theme_switcher` wraps `MaterialApp`. Theme brightness is toggled on
   `SelectServerPage`.

### Dependency Injection

`GetIt` is registered in `main.dart` via `setup()`, but only `DeviceHelper` is currently
registered. Services use manual factory-based singletons instead of GetIt.

## Key Dependencies

| Package | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `grpc` ^3.0.2 | gRPC communication with HIRD Server | Core – keep |
| `protobuf` ^2.0.1 | Protobuf serialisation | Core – keep |
| `get_it` | Service locator / DI | Partially used |
| `connectivity_plus` | Network state detection | Migrate to latest |
| `network_info_plus` | Get device Wi-Fi IP | Migrate to latest |
| `device_info_plus` | Device name for gRPC requests | Migrate to latest |
| `wakelock` | Keep screen awake while viewing dashboard | **Deprecated** → replace with `wakelock_plus` |
| `syncfusion_flutter_gauges` | Radial & linear gauge widgets | **Target for replacement** with custom widgets |
| `syncfusion_flutter_sliders` | Slider widgets (currently unused in UI) | **Remove** |
| `animated_theme_switcher` | Animated light/dark theme toggle | Consider replacing with standard `ThemeMode` |
| `expandable` | Expandable card panel | Consider replacing with standard `ExpansionTile` |
| `back_button_interceptor` | Android back-button handling | Consider replacing with `PopScope` (Flutter 3.x) |
| `fading_edge_scrollview` | Fading scroll edges | Minor visual polish |
| `ping_discover_network` | Subnet ping scan (git dependency) | Keep; no pub.dev alternative |
| `freezed_annotation` / `freezed` | Code generation for immutable models | Set up but **not yet used** |

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Flutter/Dart Version

- `pubspec.yaml` SDK constraint is `>=2.17.0 <3.0.0` — **must be upgraded to Flutter 3.x**.
- Many deprecated Flutter 2.x APIs are in active use (see below).
