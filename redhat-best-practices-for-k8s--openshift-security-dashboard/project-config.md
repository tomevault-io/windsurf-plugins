# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with this repository.

## Overview

OpenShift Security Dashboard is a Next.js web application for exploring and managing the security posture of an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster. Users upload a kubeconfig file to visually analyze RBAC, Security Context Constraints (SCCs), Network Policies, Pod Security Admission, Workloads, Service Accounts, Secrets, OAuth/Identity, and TLS certificates -- all from the browser with built-in tooltips and an optional local AI assistant.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack) -- Fullstack React framework
- **React 19** -- UI library
- **TypeScript 5** -- Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS 4** -- Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** + **Radix UI** -- Accessible, composable UI components
- **@kubernetes/client-node** -- Official Kubernetes JavaScript client (server-side only)
- **@xyflow/react** (React Flow) -- Interactive node-based graph visualization
- **Zustand** -- Lightweight client-side state management
- **Zod** -- Schema validation
- **Lucide React** -- Icon library
- **Ollama** -- Local LLM inference for the AI assistant (optional)

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: 18+ LTS required
- **npm**: 9+ (ships with Node.js)
- **Ollama**: Optional, only needed for the AI assistant feature (`ollama pull qwen3:32b`)

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm install` | Install all dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with Turbopack (http://localhost:3000) |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build |
| `npm start` | Serve the production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint across the codebase |

## Features

- **Dashboard** -- Security posture score, top risk findings, domain quick-stats
- **RBAC Explorer** -- Interactive graph of Subject-Binding-Role-Resource chains, permission matrix, "Who Can?" queries
- **SCC Manager** -- Side-by-side comparison of Security Context Constraints with traffic-light risk indicators; full editing support
- **Network Policies** -- Topology visualization, namespace-level segmentation, policy creation by drawing links
- **Pod Security Admission** -- Namespace grid showing enforce/audit/warn levels with comparison and editing
- **Workloads** -- All workload types with per-container security context editing, port analysis, applied/available SCCs
- **Service Accounts** -- Permission rollup, cluster-admin detection, linked secrets/roles, unified SCC resolution
- **Secrets** -- Metadata-only view categorized by type with age/rotation warnings (values never displayed)
- **OAuth & Identity** -- Identity providers, OAuth clients, users, and groups browser
- **TLS Compliance** -- Node-level TLS scanning producing openshift/tls-scanner compatible output
- **Analysis** -- PSA compliance checker, cross-namespace access matrix, risk scoring
- **AI Assistant** -- Ollama-powered contextual assistant on every resource detail page (optional)
- **Change Staging** -- All modifications are previewed before applying; staged changes can be reviewed, edited, or discarded

## Architecture Notes

- The kubeconfig is processed entirely on the local machine and is only sent to the local Next.js server process (localhost)
- `@kubernetes/client-node` is server-side only (configured via `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts`)
- The AI assistant runs locally via Ollama -- no data is sent to cloud APIs
- Secret values are never displayed in the browser -- only metadata (names, types, keys, age)
- All cluster modifications go through the change staging system for review before applying
