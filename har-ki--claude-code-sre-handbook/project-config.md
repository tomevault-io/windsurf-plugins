# CLAUDE.md — Conventions for this repo

This file is read by Claude Code at the start of every session in this repository.
Follow these conventions without being asked.


## Repository layout

- **Site content** lives in `docs/`. This is the MkDocs source; everything here
  compiles to the GitHub Pages site.
- **Technical artifacts** live at the repo root in named directories:
  - `scenarios/` — Kubernetes scenario manifests + setup/teardown scripts
  - `benchmark/` — benchmark runner and collected data
  - `otel-demo/` — ClickHouse + OpenTelemetry demo (Posts 2 and 8)
  - `watcher-example/` — reference watcher implementation (Post 5)
  - `skills/` — packaged Claude Code Skills (e.g., k8s/SKILL.md)
  - `shared/` — cluster bootstrap scripts and Ollama configuration

## Branching

- `main` — stable, always deployable. Every push triggers the GitHub Pages deploy.
- `drafts/0N-slug` — work-in-progress branches for unreleased posts.
  Example: `drafts/03-air-gapped`. Open a PR to `main` only when the post is
  ready to publish.
- Never commit directly to `main` for new posts — use a draft branch + PR.

## Scenario conventions

Every scenario directory under `scenarios/` must contain:
- `manifests/` — the scenario Kubernetes manifests
- `README.md` — problem description, expected error, and fix summary
- `setup.sh` — idempotent script to apply the scenario state to a cluster

## Benchmark conventions

- Every benchmark run must commit raw results as JSONL to `benchmark/data/raw/`.
- Filename format: `YYYYMMDD-T-<model-slug>-<scenario>.jsonl`
- Never post-process in place; transformations go in `benchmark/analysis/`.

## Security

- Never commit API keys, tokens, credentials, or model weights.
- Never embed secrets in CLAUDE.md, mkdocs.yml, or any tracked config file.
- If a scenario legitimately needs a secret at runtime, document it in the
  scenario README and load it from environment variables.

## MkDocs / docs conventions

- All docs pages must have a single top-level H1 matching the nav title.
- Use MkDocs Material admonitions (`!!! note`, `!!! warning`, etc.) for callouts.
- Code blocks must specify a language for syntax highlighting.
- Internal links use relative paths (e.g., `../reference/benchmark-methodology.md`).

## Commit style

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`.
- Scope is optional but encouraged for large repos: `docs(handbook):`, `feat(scenarios):`.
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters.

## Skills

Three operational skills live in `.claude/skills/`. Load them at the start
of any investigation session by calling the Skill tool, e.g.
`Skill(skill="k8s")`, `Skill(skill="clickhouse")`, `Skill(skill="gh")`:

- **clickhouse** — OTel log/trace/metric queries. Use `clickhouse client`
  (two words, not hyphenated). Tables: `otel_logs`, `otel_traces`,
  `otel_metrics_gauge`, `otel_metrics_sum`, `otel_metrics_histogram`.
- **k8s** — Kubernetes diagnosis and remediation via kubectl.
- **gh** — GitHub CLI for commits, issues, and PRs.

Always load the relevant skill before starting work. If the user mentions
GitHub, PR, pull request, commits, or gh cli, call `Skill(skill="gh")`
before proceeding. If the user mentions Kubernetes, pods, or kubectl, call
`Skill(skill="k8s")`. If the user mentions ClickHouse, otel, logs, or
traces, call `Skill(skill="clickhouse")`.

## Tool call budget

Complete tasks in under 20 tool calls per user prompt. If you reach 20,
STOP and summarize what you have so far. Prefer fewer, targeted tool calls
over many exploratory ones.

## Investigate vs Fix

When asked to "investigate", "diagnose", or "summarize" — ONLY diagnose
and report findings. Do NOT edit files, create branches, or open PRs
unless the user explicitly asks for a fix. Wait for the user to request
code changes before making them.
