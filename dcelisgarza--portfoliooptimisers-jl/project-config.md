# Copilot Instructions for PortfolioOptimisers.jl

## Project Overview

PortfolioOptimisers.jl is a modular, extensible Julia package for advanced portfolio optimization, risk management, and financial analytics. The codebase is organized around composable estimators, algorithms, and result types, supporting a wide range of statistical, econometric, and optimization techniques.

## Architecture & Key Patterns

- **Modular Design:** The main module (`src/PortfolioOptimisers.jl`) includes a large set of submodules, each focused on a specific aspect (moments, risk, priors, constraints, optimisation, etc.). Each submodule is further split into fine-grained files (e.g., different covariance estimators, risk measures, etc.).
- **Abstract Types:** All estimators, algorithms, and results are built on a hierarchy of abstract types (e.g., `AbstractEstimator`, `AbstractAlgorithm`, `AbstractResult`). New functionality should extend these types for consistency and dispatch.
- **Composability:** Estimators and algorithms are designed to be composed. For example, a covariance estimator can be wrapped with a matrix post-processing estimator, or a mean estimator can be combined with a shrinkage algorithm.
- **Validation:** The codebase uses `@argcheck` (from ArgCheck.jl) extensively for input validation and defensive programming. Always validate arguments in new methods.
- **Documentation:** All public types and methods are documented with docstrings, including usage examples and references to related types.

## Developer Workflows

- **Contributing and development:**

  - Follow the guidelines in [`1-contributing.md`](../docs/src/contribute/1-contributing.md) and [`2-developer.md`](../docs/src/contribute/2-developer.md).

- **Examples:**

  - Example scripts and notebooks are in `examples/`. Use these as references for end-to-end workflows.

### Required Before Each Commit

- **Linting and Formatting:**

  - **ALWAYS** run `pre-commit run -a` before committing changes.
  - The repository uses pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting.
  - Julia code is formatted using JuliaFormatter.jl.
  - **Commits will be rejected if pre-commit tests fail.**
  - Install pre-commit hooks once: `pre-commit install` (requires `pre-commit` via pipx).

- **Testing:**

  - **ALWAYS** run tests after making code changes and before committing.

  - From Julia REPL:

        ```julia
        using Pkg
        Pkg.activate(".")
        Pkg.test()
        ```

  - Add new tests as `test-*.jl` in `test/`.
  - Tests must pass before creating a pull request.

### Build and Development Commands

- **Formatting:**

  - Run linters and formatters: `pre-commit run -a`
  - Manual Julia formatting: Install JuliaFormatter.jl globally, then format as needed.

- **Testing:**

  - Run all tests: From Julia REPL, activate environment (`] activate .`) then run tests (`] test`).
- **Documentation:**

  - Build docs locally:

         1. `julia --project=docs`
         2. `] dev .` (first time only)
         3. `using LiveServer`
         4. `servedocs()`

## Project-Specific Conventions

- **Naming:**

  - Abstract types are always prefixed with `Abstract` (e.g., `AbstractCovarianceEstimator`).
  - Concrete types are descriptive and often parameterized (e.g., `SimpleExpectedReturns{T1}`).
  - Algorithms are suffixed with `Algorithm` or named after the method (e.g., `SpectralDenoise`, `PCA`).

- **File Naming:**

  - Source files are prefixed numerically to indicate load order and logical grouping.
- **Extensibility:**

  - To add a new result, estimator or algorithm type, subtype the relevant abstract type and provide the necessary interfaces.
  - For new matrix processing or post-processing steps, implement the appropriate interface and document usage.
- **Validation:**

  - Use `@argcheck` for all input validation, especially in constructors and public methods.
- **Dispatch:**

  - Prefer multiple dispatch over conditionals for algorithm selection and extension.
- **Commit/PR Practices:**

  - Use imperative, informative commit messages.
  - Keep commits atomic and rebase on `main` before PR.
- **Releases:**

  - Use a `release-x.y.z` branch, update `Project.toml` and `CHANGELOG.md`, and follow the release checklist in `2-developer.md`.

## Integration & Dependencies

- **Julia dependencies:**

  - Managed in `Project.toml` and loaded in the main module.

- **Python dependencies:**

  - (for PythonCall) are managed in `CondaPkg.toml`.
- **Package extensions:**

  - via extensions in `ext/`.
- **Cross-Component Patterns:**

  - Estimators and algorithms are passed as arguments to higher-level routines (e.g., an optimizer receives a covariance estimator, which itself may wrap a denoiser or detoner).
  - Matrix processing and post-processing are always explicit and composable.

## Examples

- To implement a new covariance estimator:

     1. Subtype `AbstractCovarianceEstimator`.
     2. Provide a constructor with argument validation.
     3. Add docstrings with usage and related types.
