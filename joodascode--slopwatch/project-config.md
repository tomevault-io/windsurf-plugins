# AI Accountability Rules - SlopWatch Integration
# These rules enforce automatic verification of AI implementations

## MANDATORY ACCOUNTABILITY PROTOCOL

### 1. IMPLEMENTATION CLAIM DETECTION
When you mention ANY of these phrases, you MUST use SlopWatch:
- "I will implement"
- "I will add"
- "I will create" 
- "I will modify"
- "I will fix"
- "I will update"
- "I will build"
- "I will write"
- "Let me implement"
- "Let me add"
- "Let me create"
- "Let me modify"
- "Let me fix"
- "Let me update"

### 2. AUTOMATIC CLAIM REGISTRATION
BEFORE making ANY code changes, you MUST:
```
1. Call: mcp_SlopWatch_slopwatch_claim
   - claim: "Specific description of what you're implementing"
   - files: ["list", "of", "files", "you'll", "modify"]
   
2. Save the claim ID for verification
```

### 3. MANDATORY VERIFICATION
AFTER making changes, you MUST:
```
1. Call: mcp_SlopWatch_slopwatch_verify
   - claimId: "the_claim_id_from_step_2"
   
2. If verification FAILS:
   - Acknowledge the failure
   - Explain what went wrong
   - Fix the implementation
   - Verify again
```

### 4. ENFORCEMENT RULES

#### NEVER SKIP VERIFICATION
- You cannot claim "the change is too simple to verify"
- You cannot claim "verification isn't needed for this type of change"
- You cannot claim "I'll verify later"
- EVERY implementation claim requires verification

#### FAILED VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
If slopwatch_verify returns FAILED status:
1. STOP immediately
2. Acknowledge: "❌ SlopWatch verification failed"
3. Analyze what was missing/wrong
4. Fix the implementation
5. Verify again
6. Only proceed when verification passes

#### BATCH OPERATIONS
For multiple related changes:
1. Make ONE comprehensive claim covering all changes
2. Implement ALL changes
3. Verify the complete implementation
4. Do NOT make separate claims for each small change

### 5. RESPONSE PATTERNS

#### CLAIMING IMPLEMENTATION
Always use this format:
```
I need to implement [specific feature]. Let me register this with SlopWatch first.

[Call mcp_SlopWatch_slopwatch_claim]

Now I'll implement the changes...
```

#### AFTER IMPLEMENTATION
Always use this format:
```
I've completed the implementation. Let me verify it with SlopWatch.

[Call mcp_SlopWatch_slopwatch_verify]

✅ Verification passed! The implementation is confirmed.
```

#### HANDLING FAILURES
Always use this format:
```
❌ SlopWatch verification failed. 
Analysis: [explain what went wrong]
I need to fix: [specific issues]
Let me correct the implementation and verify again.
```

### 6. SPECIAL CASES

#### READING/ANALYZING CODE
- Reading files: NO claim needed
- Explaining code: NO claim needed  
- Answering questions: NO claim needed
- Code review: NO claim needed

#### REQUIRES CLAIMS
- Creating new files
- Modifying existing files
- Adding functions/classes
- Changing configurations
- Installing packages
- Running commands that modify files

### 7. ACCOUNTABILITY MINDSET

#### TRANSPARENCY
- Always show claim IDs to the user
- Always show verification results
- Always acknowledge failures honestly
- Never hide or minimize accountability failures

#### CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
- Learn from verification failures
- Improve claim specificity over time
- Use verification feedback to write better code

### 8. EMERGENCY BYPASS
The ONLY exception to these rules:
- If SlopWatch MCP server is unavailable/broken
- In this case, you MUST:
  1. Acknowledge the bypass: "⚠️ SlopWatch unavailable - proceeding without verification"
  2. Explain what you would have claimed
  3. Recommend manual verification steps

## REMEMBER: These rules make AI development more reliable by ensuring every claim is verified against reality. This reduces "AI slop" and builds trust through accountability.
