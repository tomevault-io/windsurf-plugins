# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**deja** is a Claude Code plugin that provides zero-config persistent memory across sessions. It captures file reads, edits, bash commands, and decisions via Claude Code hooks, compresses them locally, and injects context into future sessions. Everything lives in a single SQLite file (`~/.deja/memory.db`) with no external services required.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Bun (>= 1.3.6) — required for native `bun:sqlite` bindings and fast startup
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Database:** SQLite via `bun:sqlite` with WAL mode and FTS5 for full-text search
- **Tests:** `bun:test`
- **IPC:** Unix domain socket (macOS/Linux), TCP localhost:19532 (Windows)
- **MCP:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (only npm dependency at Tier 0)

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
bun test                    # Run all tests
bun test <file>             # Run a single test file
bun run build               # Build to dist/
bun run src/worker/main.ts  # Run the worker directly
```

## Architecture

### Micro-kernel + Pipelines

A thin kernel owns the SQLite database and Unix socket. Everything else is a pipeline stage — small, pure functions that the kernel orchestrates:

```
Hook event → Queue → [Debounce] → [Classify] → [Normalize] → [Extract] → [Store + Index]
```

### Key Process Boundaries

Three separate processes access `memory.db`:

| Process | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Worker** (long-running) | Read-write | Observation processing, indexing, session summaries |
| **SessionStart hook** | Read-write | Context injection (reads DB directly), stats counters |
| **MCP server** (stdio) | Read-only | In-session search via `deja_search`/`deja_timeline`/`deja_observe` tools |

The worker and MCP server never communicate directly. Hooks send events to the worker via Unix socket; the MCP server reads the DB independently. All concurrent access is safe under WAL journal mode.

```

### Dependency Tiers

The codebase uses progressive enhancement tiers. Tier 0 is the full product, not a degraded mode:

| Tier | What it adds | Key files |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 0** | Heuristic extraction + FTS5 search | `extract/heuristic.ts`, `index/fts.ts` |
| **Tier 1** | tree-sitter AST parsing | `extract/ast.ts` |
| **Tier 2** | sqlite-vec + ONNX local embeddings | `index/vector.ts`, `search/rerank.ts` |
| **Tier 3** | LLM extraction (opt-in API calls) | `extract/llm.ts` |

### Pipeline Stage Contract

Each pipeline stage after debounce is a pure function: input → output, zero side effects, independently testable with no mocking. Target: ~50-100 lines per stage.

### Event Classification

The classifier (`classify.ts`) is the cost-saver — 30-40% of events are tagged `skip` and never stored. Significance levels: `skip | low | medium | high | critical`. First match wins (rules evaluated top-to-bottom). The classifier is a pure function; the pipeline orchestrator handles counter increments.

### Content Normalization

The normalizer (`normalize.ts`) caps `content_summary` at 2000 characters. Truncation cuts at the last complete line. For Write tool events, content is in `input.content` (not `output`). For Read tool events, content is in `output.content`.

### Context Injection (SessionStart)

SessionStart reads the DB **directly** (not through the worker) to stay under 200ms. Budget: 8000 chars default, split 40/50/10 across last session summary, high-significance observations, and cross-project insights. Token estimation: 4 chars ≈ 1 token.

### WAL Failover

Any socket error triggers WAL fallback — the hook appends to `~/.deja/pending.wal` and returns. The worker drains the WAL on startup. WAL uses a lockfile protocol (`flock`) because payloads can exceed `PIPE_BUF`.

## Data Model

Key tables: `observations` (main data), `sessions` (lifecycle), `observations_fts` (FTS5 virtual table with triggers for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE sync), `stats` (counters), `schema_version`.

- `significance` field on observations: `skip | low | medium | high | critical`
- `kind` field: `file_read | file_edit | file_write | bash_cmd | decision | prompt`
- `raw_event` column stores original hook JSON for future reprocessing
- `embedding` column is nullable BLOB (only populated when Tier 2 is active)
- Timestamps are epoch-only integers (`created_at_epoch`), human-readable derived via SQL
