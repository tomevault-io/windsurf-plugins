# Working in this repository

## Documentation is part of the change, not a follow-up

**Before every commit, update the documentation that the change makes stale.**
Not "later", not a separate tidy-up commit — in the same commit as the code.
Check each of these and update the ones the change touches:

- `README.md` — user-facing behaviour, flags, config, endpoints, quickstarts.
- `docs/architecture.md` — the component and flow diagrams. If a change adds a
  component, a role, an endpoint that crosses a plane boundary, or alters how
  the snapshot moves, the diagram is now wrong and must be redrawn.
- `deploy/README.md` and `deploy/*.yaml` comments — anything an operator does.
- `TODO.md` — mark work done; delete claims that are no longer true.
- The doc comment on any function whose behaviour or contract you changed.

A comment that describes behaviour the code no longer has is worse than no
comment: it actively misleads the next reader. This has bitten this repo
repeatedly — a doc claiming credentials were encrypted before they were, a
manifest comment claiming the admin API was token-gated when it was gated on
nothing, a field comment promising a live-swapped snapshot that was set once
at startup. Every one of those was found by review, not by the author.

If a change makes a security claim in the docs false, fixing the claim is the
_minimum_; consider whether the code should be made to match the claim
instead.

## Never edit a migration that has been applied

`sqlx` checksums every migration file and refuses to start when an applied one
changes — including a comment. Correcting a stale comment in
`migrations/0014_prompt_classes.sql` failed every database test with
"migration 14 was previously applied but has been modified", and it failed in
CI rather than locally because the checksum lives in the database, not the
repo.

If a migration's comment is wrong, fix it where the code lives and leave the
migration alone, or add a new migration.

## Environment

- **Never use Docker on this machine.** It is not the workflow. Do not run
  `docker`, do not try to start Docker Desktop, do not propose
  `docker compose` as the way to get a dependency running locally.
- **The `kw` Kubernetes cluster is the dev environment.** Build there, test
  there, deploy there. Dependencies a test needs get deployed to kw. CI already
  builds on in-cluster ARC runners — follow that pattern.
- Postgres for local test runs lives on kw and is reachable directly at a LAN
  VIP; the connection URL is kept in `/tmp/dburl`.
- Do not be precious about the dev cluster. Deploy and test on it freely.

## Conventions this codebase holds to

- **Doc comments explain _why_, not _what_.** The reasoning is the valuable
  part; the code already says what it does.
- **The request path performs no I/O.** No database call, no network call, no
  file read while serving a request. `tests/no_io_on_hot_path.rs` guards this
  and must be extended whenever new work lands on that path.
- **API keys hash with SHA-256; user passwords with Argon2id.** These are
  deliberately different: keys are high-entropy random, passwords are
  low-entropy and human-chosen. Do not unify them.
- **`AppState::apply_snapshot` is the single write path** for the snapshot. It
  rebuilds the routing registry in the same call so the two cannot diverge.
  Never write to the snapshot cell directly.
- Performance claims need a measurement. `docs/performance.md` records what was
  tried and rejected, with numbers, so nobody re-litigates it from intuition.

## Before you claim something works

Run it. `cargo test` passing is not the same as the feature working end to
end, and several real bugs on this branch — usage silently dropped for
non-streaming responses, readiness checks that treated 503 as "not started" —
passed the unit tests and failed the moment a real request went through.
