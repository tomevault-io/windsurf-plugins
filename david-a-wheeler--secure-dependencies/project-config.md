## Size and reuse

Try to keep implementation short and simple
while still providing functionality and security.

In particular, define and use methods instead of repeating
code constructs where reasonable.

## Ecosystem sharing

Try to share constructs between ecosystems, such as patterns to search for
or processes to apply.

As much as practical, we want a lesson learned from any ecosystem
to be applied to all ecosystems.

## Verification

Run `make` to locally run all verification steps
(tests, typechecking, linting, etc.).

## Citations

Record citations of external material, especially when doing research.
Use [AuthorDate] citation reference format, and in the list of citations
use the format `[AuthorDate] [Author(s), Date, "Title", Publication](URL)`
where `Author` the primary author's last name.
If no individual author is found, use publishing organization name.
Double-check all URLs to prevent hallucination of citations or URLs.

## Style

Do not use long dashes (em dashes or en dashes).
A `--` should only be used to introduce long-name options.
Instead use other constructs such as colons, semicolons, or parentheses.

Where reasonable, keep text lines at 78 or fewer characters.

## Command injection prevention (verify on every subprocess call)

All subprocess calls MUST pass arguments as a Python list (never as a
shell string), and MUST NOT use `shell=True`. Use `['cmd', 'arg1', 'arg2']`
form. Place all options before `'--'` and put untrusted values (package
names, versions, URLs) after `'--'`, so the tool cannot interpret them as
flags. Validate package names against a strict allowlist regex before use.
This is the primary defence against command injection (CWE-78).

## Regular expression safety (ReDoS prevention)

All regular expressions used for scanning MUST be written to avoid
catastrophic backtracking (ReDoS, CWE-400). Rules:

- Prefer anchored patterns and character classes with bounded quantifiers
  such as `{0,200}` to limit the search space on any single match.
- Never use nested unbounded quantifiers such as `(a+)+` or `(a|ab)*`
  that allow exponential backtracking.
- Prefer mutually exclusive character classes (e.g. `[^)]{0,200}`) over
  overlapping alternatives on the same position.
- When adding a new pattern, mentally trace the worst-case input and
  confirm the engine visits O(n) or O(n^2) states at most per line.
