# DeepSafe Scan — Cursor Integration

This project includes deepsafe-scan, a preflight security scanner for AI agent environments.

## Security scanning

When the user asks to audit, scan, or check security of their AI agent setup, skills, or MCP servers, run the scanner:

```bash
python3 scripts/scan.py --modules posture,skill,memory,hooks --scan-dir . --no-llm --format markdown
```

For a full scan with LLM analysis (if OPENAI_API_KEY is set):
```bash
python3 scripts/scan.py --modules posture,skill,memory,hooks,model --scan-dir . --format markdown
```

## When to suggest scanning

- User installs a new MCP server or Cursor extension
- User clones a project with .cursorrules or agent config files
- User asks about security of their AI setup
- User reports unexpected AI behavior that might indicate injection

## Findings

Present findings by severity (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW).
For each finding, show: what the risk is, the evidence, and how to fix it.
Offer to fix CRITICAL and HIGH issues immediately.
