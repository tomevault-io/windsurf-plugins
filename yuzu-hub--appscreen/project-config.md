# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

App Store Screenshot Generator - a browser-based tool for creating App Store marketing screenshots. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, Three.js, and CSS. No build process required.

## Agent Instructions

**Development Server:**
- The agent should automatically start the local development server when needed using `python3 -m http.server 8000` (or `npx serve .` as fallback)
- The agent should run the server in the background and inform the user which URL to open (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
- The agent should NOT ask the user to start the server manually
- The agent should monitor server logs to detect and report any errors or problems to the user

**Git & Commits:**
- The agent should handle all git operations automatically (add, commit, push)
- Before creating a commit, the agent MUST show the proposed commit message to the user and wait for approval
- Only after user approval should the agent proceed with the commit
- The agent should follow standard git commit message conventions

## Development

To run locally, serve via a web server (required for IndexedDB persistence):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in browser. Opening `index.html` directly from filesystem will break persistence.

## Architecture

**Main files:**

- `index.html` - UI structure with modals for settings, about, project management, translations, and language selection
- `styles.css` - Dark theme styling, responsive layout with CSS Grid (3-column: left sidebar, canvas, right sidebar)
- `app.js` - All application logic (~4400 lines)
- `three-renderer.js` - Three.js 3D rendering for iPhone mockups (~1000 lines)
- `language-utils.js` - Language detection, localized image management, and translation dialogs (~500 lines)

**Key patterns in app.js:**

- `state` object at top holds all application state (screenshots, settings, text, background config)
- `updateCanvas()` is the main render function - call after any state change
- `saveState()` persists to IndexedDB, called automatically in `updateCanvas()`
- `syncUIWithState()` updates all UI controls to reflect current state
- Project management uses IndexedDB with two stores: `projects` (data) and `meta` (project list)
- Per-screenshot settings: each screenshot stores its own background, device, and text settings

**Canvas rendering pipeline (in updateCanvas):**
1. `drawBackground()` - gradient/solid/image with optional blur and overlay
2. `drawScreenshot()` - positioned, scaled, rotated screenshot with shadow and border
3. `drawText()` - headline and subheadline with multi-language support
4. `drawNoise()` - optional noise texture overlay

**3D rendering (in three-renderer.js):**
- Uses Three.js with GLTFLoader for iPhone 15 Pro Max model
- `initThreeJS()` - initializes scene, camera, renderer, and lights
- `loadPhoneModel()` - loads the 3D iPhone model from `models/iphone-15-pro-max.glb`
- `renderThreeJSToCanvas()` - renders 3D scene to export canvas with full resolution
- `renderThreeJSForScreenshot()` - renders 3D for specific screenshot (side previews)
- Drag-to-rotate interaction on the 3D preview canvas

**Multi-language text:**
- `state.text.headlines` and `state.text.subheadlines` are objects keyed by language code
- `getTextSettings()` returns either global or per-screenshot text depending on toggle state
- AI translation calls Claude/OpenAI/Google API directly from browser (requires API key in settings)

**Localized screenshots (in language-utils.js):**
- Each screenshot has `localizedImages` object keyed by language code (e.g., `{ 'en': {...}, 'de': {...} }`)
- `detectLanguageFromFilename()` - parses suffixes like `_de`, `-fr`, `_pt-br` from filenames
- `getScreenshotImage(screenshot)` - returns image for current language with fallback chain
- `findScreenshotByBaseFilename()` - matches uploads to existing screenshots by base name
- Duplicate detection shows dialog with Replace/Create New/Skip options when uploading matching files

**UI Components:**
- Right sidebar has three tabs: Background, Device, Text
- Collapsible toggle sections for Noise, Shadow, Border, Headline, Subheadline
- Device tab has 2D/3D mode selector with different controls for each mode
- Side preview carousel with sliding animation between screenshots
- Project selector dropdown with screenshot counts
- Gradient editor with draggable color stops

## Key Functions

**Project & Screenshots (app.js):**
- `createProject()` / `deleteProject()` / `switchProject()` - async, must await and call `updateProjectSelector()` after
- `handleFiles()` - processes uploaded images, detects language, shows duplicate dialog if needed
- `createNewScreenshot()` - creates screenshot entry with localized image support
- `exportCurrent()` / `exportAll()` - generates PNG downloads from canvas (ZIP for batch export)
- `applyPositionPreset()` - applies preset screenshot positioning (centered, bleed, tilt, perspective, etc.)
- `transferStyle()` - copies style settings from one screenshot to another
- `slideToScreenshot()` - animates carousel transition between screenshots
