# Copilot Instructions

This repository ships one canonical Conductor contract: `skill/SKILL.md`.

- Read `skill/SKILL.md` before changing doctrine, workflow, or host compatibility behavior.
- Keep Copilot-facing files thin. They exist to route Copilot to `skill/SKILL.md`, not to redefine Conductor.
- If `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, or `.github/agents/*.agent.md` drift from `skill/SKILL.md`, update them to match `skill/SKILL.md`.
- `gemini-extension.json` is host metadata, not doctrine.
