# Agents Guide

This document provides guidelines for AI agents working on this project.

## Core Principles

### High Code Quality

- Maintain the highest standards of code quality.
- Ensure code is readable, maintainable, and well-documented.
- Follow existing code styles and patterns found in the project.

### Design Principles

- **SOLID**: Adhere to SOLID principles:
  - **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
  - **O**pen/Closed Principle
  - **L**iskov Substitution Principle
  - **I**nterface Segregation Principle
  - **D**ependency Inversion Principle
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself. Refactor duplicated logic into reusable functions or components.

### Code Hygiene

- **Remove Unused Code**: Aggressively remove dead code, unused imports, and commented-out blocks.
- Keep the codebase clean and lean.

### Security

- **Network Binding**: Always bind internal services and APIs to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) rather than `0.0.0.0` unless external network access is explicitly intended and authenticated. This prevents Local Area Network (LAN) DDoS attacks and unauthorized access.
  - E.g., FastAPI host in `config.py` should default to `127.0.0.1`.
  - E.g., Docker container ports in `docker-compose.yml` should be prefixed with `127.0.0.1:` (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8108:8108`).

### Data Accuracy

- **No Hallucinations**: Never hallucinate URLs, credentials, or similar data. Always extract them from existing configuration files (like `pyproject.toml`) or ask the user to supply them if they are not explicitly mentioned in the project.

### Dependency Management

- **Update Lock File**: Whenever you modify `pyproject.toml` (e.g., adding/removing dependencies), you MUST run `poetry lock` to update the `poetry.lock` file. Failure to do so will break CI/CD workflows.
- **Use Poetry for Commands**: ALWAYS use `poetry run` prefix when running tests, scripts, or any Python commands in the backend. For example:
  - `poetry run pytest tests/` (NOT `pytest tests/`)
  - `poetry run python -m file_brain.main` (NOT `python -m file_brain.main`)
  - This ensures you're using the correct virtual environment with all dependencies installed.

### Project Scripts

- **Use NPM Scripts**: For high-level application tasks, prefer the scripts defined in `package.json` at the root.
  - `npm run dev:app`: Run the app in development mode
  - `npm run build:app-frontend`: Build the frontend
  - `npm run clean:*`: various cleanup commands
  - `npm run db:*`: Database migration commands
- **Maintain Scripts**: Keep `package.json` scripts updated. If you introduce new common workflows or change existing ones, update `package.json` accordingly.

### Testing

- **Run Full Test Suite**: Before submitting changes, run the full test suite:
  ```bash
  cd apps/file-brain
  poetry run pytest tests/ -v
  ```
- **Verify All Tests Pass**: Ensure all tests pass before considering your work complete. The project maintains 100% test pass rate.

### Frontend/Backend API Consistency

**CRITICAL**: The frontend and backend must always be kept in sync when making API changes. Mismatches between TypeScript interfaces and Python response models cause runtime bugs that are hard to detect.

#### When Modifying API Endpoints

1. **Backend Changes First**: When modifying an API endpoint response:
   - Update the Pydantic `BaseModel` in the backend endpoint file (e.g., `file_brain/api/v1/endpoints/*.py`)
   - Run backend tests to ensure the change works
2. **Frontend Changes Second**: Immediately update the corresponding TypeScript interface:
   - Update the interface in `frontend/src/api/client.ts`
   - Update any components that use this interface
   - Build the frontend to catch TypeScript errors: `npm run build`

3. **Common Pitfall - Incomplete Reverts**: When reverting backend changes:
   - **ALWAYS check if frontend code references the removed fields**
   - Search for the field name across the frontend codebase
   - Remove or update all references to maintain consistency

   **Example Bug**: In v0.1.18a3, the backend removed the `running` field from `DockerCheckResponse`, but the frontend still checked `result.running`, causing the wizard to hang because the field was `undefined`.

#### Verification Checklist

When making API changes, verify:

- [ ] Backend Pydantic model updated
- [ ] Backend tests pass
- [ ] Frontend TypeScript interface updated in `client.ts`
- [ ] All frontend components using this interface updated
- [ ] Frontend builds without TypeScript errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] No references to removed fields remain in frontend code

#### Search for Frontend References

Before removing a field from a backend response, search the frontend:

```bash
cd apps/file-brain/frontend
grep -r "fieldName" src/
```

Replace `fieldName` with the actual field you're removing. Update or remove all occurrences.

## Technology Stack

When working on this project, strictly adhere to the following technologies and patterns. Do not introduce new libraries or frameworks without explicit permission.

### Frontend (`apps/website`, `apps/file-brain/frontend`)

- **Framework**: Next.js (Website), React (App)
