# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`ephemeral-roles` is a Discord bot (Go) that watches voice channel presence and auto-assigns/revokes
"ephemeral roles" (prefixed, e.g. `{eph} General`) matching the channel a member is currently in. It runs
as a StatefulSet of shards in Kubernetes; each pod is one shard of the same Discord application.

## Commands

All common tasks go through the `Makefile` (uses `go tool -modfile=tools/go.mod` to run pinned tool
versions from `tools/go.mod`, separate from the main module):

```
make tidy    # go mod tidy for both the root module and tools/ module
make fmt     # gofmt -s -w + goimports (local-prefix github.com/ewohltman/ephemeral-roles/), runs tidy first
make vet     # go vet ./...
make lint    # vet + golangci-lint run ./... (config: .golangci.yml, "all" linters minus an explicit disable list)
make test    # gotestsum with -race and coverage, excludes ./cmd/...; prints total coverage
make build   # CGO_ENABLED=0 trimpath build -> build/package/ephemeral-roles/ephemeral-roles
make image   # podman build of the Docker image (build/package/ephemeral-roles/Dockerfile)
```

Run a single test package/test the normal Go way, e.g.:
```
go test ./internal/pkg/callbacks/... -run TestHandler_VoiceStateUpdate -race
```

CI (`.github/workflows/pullRequest.yml`) runs `make tidy`, `make vet`, `golangci-lint` (golangci-lint-action v9, golangci-lint v2.12.2), `make test`,
`make build`, `make image` on every PR targeting non-master branches. `pullRequestMaster.yml` covers PRs into
master. Development happens on `develop` (the repo's default branch); contributions target `develop` per
CONTRIBUTING.md, and merges to `master` auto-deploy.

## Architecture

The Discord library is `github.com/disgoorg/disgo` (a `*bot.Client` composed of `gateway`/`sharding`/
`cache`/`rest`/`events` subpackages; IDs are `snowflake.ID`, not strings). The client is threaded through
constructors in place of a session.

Entry point: `cmd/ephemeral-roles/ephemeral-roles.go`. On startup it: parses env vars (via `caarlos0/env`,
see `environmentVariables` struct), derives a shard ID from `INSTANCE_NAME` (expects a trailing
`-<N>` from the StatefulSet pod name), builds a `logging.Logger` and an HTTP client, builds the disgo
`*bot.Client` (`disgo.New` with sharding config, gateway intents — only `IntentGuilds`,
`IntentGuildVoiceStates`, and `IntentGuildMembers` — cache flags, the HTTP client, and the
`logging.Logger` via `bot.WithLogger`), registers callback event listeners, opens the shard manager,
starts the Prometheus monitoring goroutine, and starts the HTTP server. Shutdown is on SIGINT/SIGTERM.

Package layout under `internal/pkg/`:

- **callbacks** — `Handler` holds bot config/dependencies and the Discord event listener methods
  (`Ready`, `VoiceStateUpdate`, `ChannelDelete`), registered via `bot.NewListenerFunc`. Each takes a single
  `*events.*` argument and reaches the client through `event.Client()`. `VoiceStateUpdate` is the core flow:
  the `*events.GuildVoiceStateUpdate` carries the `discord.Member`; look up guild/channel/role from the
  client cache (`client.Caches`), resolve or create the `{prefix} <channel name>` role, remove any other
  ephemeral roles the member holds (by prefix match), then add the new one. Errors from this parse/lookup
  step are wrapped in `EventError` (`errors.go`), which carries an `ErrorKind` enum (member/channel not
  found, insufficient permissions, max roles, deadline exceeded) plus the guild/member/channel context
  available at the failure point, so the handler can branch on `Kind` and attach structured log fields
  without repeating plumbing.
- **operations** — `Gateway` (backed by `golang.org/x/sync/singleflight`) de-duplicates Discord
  API-mutating requests: `Gateway.CreateRole` collapses concurrent `VoiceStateUpdate` callbacks racing to
  create the same role into a single API call. Also holds guild/role/member lookup and permission-check
  helpers used directly by callbacks (`LookupGuild`, `AddRoleToMember`, `RemoveRoleFromMember`,
  `BotHasChannelPermission` via the disgo cache), plus classifiers for specific Discord REST errors
  (`IsForbiddenResponse`, `IsMaxGuildsResponse`, `IsDeadlineExceeded`, `ShouldLogDebug`) based on
  `*rest.Error` and its `JSONErrorCode`. Guild data comes from the disgo gateway-populated cache (there is
  no manual state repopulation).
- **monitor** — `Metrics.Monitor` starts a background goroutine that periodically polls the client cache
  and updates Prometheus gauges/counters (guild count, member count, Ready/VoiceStateUpdate event totals),
  namespaced `ephemeral_roles`.
- **http** — the bot's own HTTP server (`NewServer`): `/` health root, `/guilds` (JSON list of guilds
  sorted by member count), `/metrics` (Prometheus), and pprof endpoints. Also provides the outbound
  `http.Client`/`http.Transport` constructors (`NewClient`, `NewTransport`) for Discord API calls, plus
  `ErrorLogger`, an `slog`-backed `*log.Logger` used for the server's `ErrorLog`.
- **logging** — wraps the standard library `log/slog`. `New` returns a `*Logger` (embedding
