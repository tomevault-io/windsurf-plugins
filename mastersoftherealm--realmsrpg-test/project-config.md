description: Codex / reference-data edits — owner review before database writes

# Codex & Reference Data (Supabase)

Applies to **`codex_*`**, **`core_rules`**, and any bulk edits to official library reference content.

## Read freely; write only after review

| Allowed without prior approval | Requires owner review first |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `SELECT` / audits / counts / previews | `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE` on codex tables |
| Draft SQL in `sql/*.sql` | `execute_sql` / `apply_migration` that mutates codex data |
| Repo-only seed/CSV edits (not live DB) | Supabase MCP writes that change live reference data |

## Workflow for bulk or policy changes (tags, categories, merges, migrations)

1. **Audit** — query or export current state; cite counts and examples.
2. **Propose** — mapping plan, sample before/after rows, SQL file in `sql/` (no trailing `UPDATE` until approved).
3. **Wait** — owner reviews and approves, corrects mappings, or says "apply".
4. **Apply** — run approved SQL once; report rows affected and post-migration counts.

Do **not** chain Phase 1 → Phase 2 → live DB in one turn without an explicit apply step from the owner.

## Explicit owner direction

When the owner gives a **specific correction in the current message** (e.g. "use Skill Roll not Skill Check", "apply phase 2"), implement that scope only — still prefer a preview for bulk updates when practical.

## Terminology

Match **`src/docs/GAME_RULES.md`** for game terms in codex fields (e.g. **Skill Roll**, not Skill Check).

## After approved codex data changes

- Keep `sql/` migration files in sync with what was applied.
- Note in `src/docs/ai/AI_CHANGELOG.md` when reference data meaningfully changes.
- Re-export or align `scripts/seed-data/` / `codex_csv/` if those remain parity sources (ask if unsure).
