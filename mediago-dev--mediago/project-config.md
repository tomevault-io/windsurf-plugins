# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

MediaGo is a pnpm/turborepo monorepo. Feature apps live in `apps/` (`frontend-main`, `frontend-mobile`, `backend-web`, `backend-electron`) for the user surfaces and API. Reusable logic stays in `packages/` (`shared` for cross-runtime helpers, `backend` for orchestration, `main` for Electron packaging). Long-form docs and assets sit in `docs/`, `images/`, and `docker/`. End-to-end checks live in `tests/`.

## Tooling and Script Placement

Repository automation is centralized in `packages/tooling`.

- Do not create app-local or package-local `scripts/` directories.
- Put build, development, release, migration, code-generation, and verification entrypoints under `packages/tooling/src/<domain>/` and invoke them from `Taskfile.yml` or package scripts.
- Before adding a new tooling entrypoint, search `packages/tooling` and extend an existing domain module when practical.
- Keep product runtime code in its owning app or package; this rule applies to repository automation and one-off executable tooling, not application features.

## Documentation Site Safety

`docs/` is the production VitePress source directory. Its contents are packaged and deployed to the public documentation site.

- Never create agent planning or working artifacts anywhere under `docs/`. This includes `docs/plans/`, `docs/superpowers/`, design or implementation plans, audit reports, task logs, handoff notes, scratch Markdown, generated prompts, and session notes.
- Only add or edit files under `docs/` when they are intentional public documentation, documentation assets, VitePress source/configuration, or tests required for the documentation site.
- Store persistent internal planning artifacts under `.agents/plans/`. Store disposable artifacts in the system temporary directory.
- This rule overrides any skill, tool, or template that defaults to writing plans under `docs/` or `docs/plans/`.
- Before finishing a task that touches documentation, inspect `git status --short -- docs` and remove accidental internal artifacts without deleting legitimate documentation content.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Run `pnpm install` once per clone. Use `pnpm dev` for the unified desktop + web experience, or scope to `pnpm dev:web` / `pnpm dev:electron`. `pnpm build` triggers the production Turborepo pipeline; `pnpm build:web-release` plus `pnpm build:docker` produce the deployable web bundle. Keep the codebase healthy with `pnpm lint`, `pnpm lint:fix`, `pnpm format`, and verify types through `pnpm types`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Target modern TypeScript with ES modules, two-space indentation, UTF-8, and LF endings per `.editorconfig`. Components, hooks, and services adopt PascalCase (e.g. `UserPreferencesPanel.tsx`). Utilities and helpers stay camelCase, and constants use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. Always run `pnpm format` before committing; reserve comments for clarifying complex logic.

## UI Interaction and Cursor Semantics

Mouse cursors must communicate what an element will do. Define cursor behavior in shared UI primitives whenever possible so every consumer inherits it.

| Interaction                                                                      | Cursor                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Enabled buttons, links, menu items, select options, toggles, and clickable cards | pointer                                   |
| Disabled or unavailable controls                                                 | not-allowed                               |
| Editable text                                                                    | text                                      |
| Draggable content                                                                | grab, changing to grabbing while dragging |
| Horizontal or vertical resize handles                                            | col-resize or row-resize                  |
| Work continuing in the background                                                | progress                                  |
| Blocking work where the UI cannot accept input                                   | wait                                      |
| Non-interactive content                                                          | default                                   |

Do not use cursor-default on an enabled interactive element. Avoid pointer-events: none on disabled controls when it prevents the not-allowed cursor from being shown; use native disabled, aria-disabled, or the component library's disabled state to block the action. Cursor styling does not replace semantic HTML, keyboard interaction, focus states, or accessible names.
