# Claude Code Prompt for Plan Mode

#prompts

Review this plan thoroughly before making any code changes. For every issue or recommendation, explain the concrete tradeoffs, give me an opinionated recommendation, and ask for my input before assuming a direction.
My engineering preferences (use these to guide your recommendations):

- DRY is important--flag repetition aggressively.
- Well-tested code is non-negotiable; I'd rather have too many tests than too few.
- I want code that's "engineered enough" -- not under-engineered (fragile, hacky) and not over-engineered (premature abstraction, unnecessary complexity).
- I err on the side of handling more edge cases, not fewer; thoughtfulness > speed.
- Bias toward explicit over clever.

1. Architecture review
   Evaluate:

- Overall system design and component boundaries.
- Dependency graph and coupling concerns.
- Data flow patterns and potential bottlenecks.
- Scaling characteristics and single points of failure.
- Security architecture (auth, data access, API boundaries).

2. Code quality review
   Evaluate:

- Code organization and module structure.
- DRY violations--be aggressive here.
- Error handling patterns and missing edge cases (call these out explicitly).
- Technical debt hotspots.
- Areas that are over-engineered or under-engineered relative to my preferences.

3. Test review
   Evaluate:

- Test coverage gaps (unit, integration, e2e).
- Test quality and assertion strength.
- Missing edge case coverage--be thorough.
- Untested failure modes and error paths.

4. Performance review
   Evaluate:

- N+1 queries and database access patterns.
- Memory-usage concerns.
- Caching opportunities.
- Slow or high-complexity code paths.

For each issue you find
For every specific issue (bug, smell, design concern, or risk):

- Describe the problem concretely, with file and line references.
- Present 2-3 options, including "do nothing" where that's reasonable.
- For each option, specify: implementation effort, risk, impact on other code, and maintenance burden.
- Give me your recommended option and why, mapped to my preferences above.
- Then explicitly ask whether I agree or want to choose a different direction before proceeding.

Workflow and interaction

- Do not assume my priorities on timeline or scale.
- After each section, pause and ask for my feedback before moving on.

BEFORE YOU START,
Ask if I want one of two options:
1/ BIG CHANGE: Work through this interactively, one section at a time (Architecture -> Code Quality -> Tests -> Performance) with at most 4 top issues in each section
2/ SMALL CHANGE: Work through interactively ONE question per review section

FOR EACH STAGE OF REVIEW: output the explanation and pros and cons of each stage's questions AND your opinionated recommendation and why, and then use AskUserQuestion. Also NUMBER issues and then give LETTERS for options and when using AskUserQuestion make sure each option clearly labels the issue NUMBER and option LETTER so the user doesn't get confused. Make the recommended option always the 1st option.

# Ultracite Code Standards

This project uses **Ultracite**, a zero-config preset that enforces strict code quality standards through automated formatting and linting.

## Quick Reference

- **Format code**: `pnpm dlx ultracite fix`
- **Check for issues**: `pnpm dlx ultracite check`
- **Diagnose setup**: `pnpm dlx ultracite doctor`

Oxlint + Oxfmt (the underlying engine) provides robust linting and formatting. Most issues are automatically fixable.

## Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Type Safety & Explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
- Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### React & JSX

- Use function components over class components
- Call hooks at the top level only, never conditionally
- Specify all dependencies in hook dependency arrays correctly
- Use the `key` prop for elements in iterables (prefer unique IDs over array indices)
