description: Prefer live-browser Chrome DevTools MCP for localhost and manual debugging; keep Playwright as deterministic fallback.

# Browser Debugging Preference

When browser automation or debugging is needed:

- Prefer `chrome-devtools-live` when the user already has Chrome open, is logged in, or wants the agent to inspect the current browser state.
- Prefer `chrome-devtools-port` when testing localhost repeatedly or when a reusable dedicated debug browser is better than the user’s normal browsing session.
- Use Playwright when isolation, deterministic repro, or fresh auth state is the actual goal.
- Do not default to Playwright if the user clearly wants the current browser session or selected DevTools state.
- For localhost work, favor going straight into the browser via Chrome DevTools MCP before spinning up a fresh browser automation lane.

Operational rules:

- `chrome-devtools-live` requires remote debugging enabled at `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` and a user approval prompt.
- `chrome-devtools-port` assumes Chrome was launched with a remote debug port, for example via `/Users/kevinliu/.codex/bin/open-chrome-debug.sh http://localhost:3000`.
- Playwright is fallback, not the first move, for manual browser debugging.

Cleanup rules:

MCP processes (chrome-devtools-mcp, playwright-mcp) and Playwright-managed Chrome instances accumulate across sessions and waste memory. When the user asks to clean up, shut down, or wrap up:

- Kill stale MCP processes: `pkill -f "chrome-devtools-mcp"` and `pkill -f "playwright-mcp"`
- Kill Playwright-managed Chrome: `pkill -f "ms-playwright/mcp-chrome"`
- Verify nothing remains: `ps aux | grep -iE "chrome-devtools-mcp|playwright-mcp|ms-playwright" | grep -v grep | wc -l`
- Never kill the user's normal Chrome browser or Cursor processes.
- Report what was cleaned up and confirm zero remaining.
