# External Frontend Skill Routing

When frontend work becomes specialized, route to the imported skill that matches the problem instead of giving generic advice.

Preferred routing:

- use `modern-web-design` for broad contemporary design direction
- use `motion-framer` for React component motion, layout transitions, menus, overlays, and most UI animation
- use `gsap-scrolltrigger` for scrollytelling, pinning, scrubbed sections, and cross-surface choreography
- use `react-three-fiber` for React-based 3D scenes
- use `threejs-webgl` for lower-level or non-React Three.js work
- use `web3d-integration-patterns` when multiple motion/3D libraries need to work together coherently
- use `rive-interactive` for stateful designer-authored runtime animations
- use `lottie-animations` for After Effects exported motion assets
- use `pixijs-2d` for GPU-accelerated 2D graphics and particle layers
- use `spline-interactive` when a visual-editor 3D workflow is the right fit
- use `aframe-webxr` for browser VR/AR or WebXR work
- use `lightweight-3d-effects` when decorative depth is enough and a full engine is overkill
- use `animejs` for framework-agnostic timeline/SVG animation
- use `barba-js` for multi-page transition systems
- use `scroll-reveal-libraries` only for simple reveal-on-scroll work
- use `blender-web-pipeline` and `substance-3d-texturing` for 3D asset and material pipelines
- use `babylonjs-engine` or `playcanvas-engine` when the work is closer to game-engine style interactive 3D

Routing priorities:

- prefer `motion-framer` over ad hoc React animation code
- prefer `gsap-scrolltrigger` over generic scroll-effect improvisation
- prefer `react-three-fiber` over low-level Three.js in React unless low-level control is required
- prefer `rive-interactive` over Lottie when runtime state and interactivity matter
- prefer `lightweight-3d-effects` over full 3D engines when only mild decorative depth is needed

Exceptions:

- do not force imported skills when the existing codebase already standardizes on another well-chosen stack
- do not use `locomotive-scroll` as a new default; prefer Lenis unless maintaining existing Locomotive work or explicitly requested
- do not use `scroll-reveal-libraries` for brand-defining motion systems
