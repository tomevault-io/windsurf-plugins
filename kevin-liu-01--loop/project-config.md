# High-Signal Frontend System

When generating or editing frontend code:

- Start by choosing an explicit art direction. Do not default to generic SaaS.
- Choose a methodology lens before choosing tactics: discovery, system, and evaluation.
- Pick one primary visual thesis: editorial technical, premium AI SaaS, cinematic 3D, architectural blueprint, neo-brutalist, or experimental.
- Build or extend a real design system before adding one-off styling.
- Default to Tailwind CSS v4 `@theme` plus runtime CSS variables for token transport.
- Use tokens for color, spacing, radii, shadows, blur, z-index, and motion.
- Prefer OKLCH when authoring custom color scales.
- Reject raw hex colors, arbitrary spacing, and accidental radius/shadow drift.
- Prefer a type triad: display, sans, mono.
- Avoid Inter, Roboto, default shadcn aesthetics, and generic purple gradients unless the existing product already uses them or the user explicitly asks for them.
- Keep the primary UI to 3 active colors or fewer plus neutrals.
- Use authored line breaks in headlines.
- Use `text-wrap: balance` for headings and important short copy when helpful.
- Use `antialiased` at the app layout level when it improves the chosen fonts.
- Use `tabular-nums` for metrics, dates, prices, and changing numeric UI.
- Make the product shot, dashboard mock, or diagram obey the same token system as the rest of the page.
- Keep navigation, CTA hierarchy, and proof blocks simple and obvious.
- Favor optical alignment over perfect geometry when they conflict.
- Default to bold but coherent decisions, not safe average ones.
- When the problem is craft quality, learn from manual-grade references like `userinterface.wiki`, Rauno, Devouring Details, Interface Craft, and UI Playbook, not only from spectacle-heavy marketing sites.
- Preserve concentric radii on nested surfaces: outer radius = inner radius + padding.
- Prefer subtle layered shadows over hard borders when the goal is depth.
- Give images and screenshots a low-opacity outline when they need a cleaner edge.
- CSS is the substrate for layout, tokens, and fallbacks. Do not default to raw CSS as the primary motion architecture.
- For React frontends, prefer Motion, GSAP, Lenis, R3F/drei, OGL, and React transitions where appropriate.
- If the product touches auth, user data, or public forms, include trust checks in the implementation: Supabase RLS where relevant, tested auth flows, rate limits, server-side validation, locked-down env vars, CAPTCHA on public forms when needed, CORS restrictions, and error handling that does not leak internals.

Composition rules:

- One hero focal point.
- One dominant CTA.
- One proof pattern near the claim.
- One repeated motif across the page.

Tactic rules:

- choose tactics intentionally: shell, density, motion, 3D/shaders, forms, data display, wait UX, resilience, search, AI, or docs
- do not cargo-cult patterns because they were trendy on one reference site

Ban these by default:

- centered-everything landing pages
- blur blobs with no material logic
- glassmorphism on white for no reason
- several competing accents
- five unrelated section styles on one page
- mismatched nested border radii
- important headlines left to accidental wrapping
- JS-only token systems when Tailwind v4 runtime vars would do the job better

If the task is docs-heavy, preserve docs usability first and add taste second.
