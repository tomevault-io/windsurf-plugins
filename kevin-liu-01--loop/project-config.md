# Frontend Prompting Rules

When asked to design or generate frontend work, prompts should specify:

- product and audience
- methodology lens
- art-direction thesis
- palette
- type pairing
- material language
- component inventory
- tactic families
- motion budget
- runtime stack
- performance constraints
- banned defaults

Good prompts ask for proposals first.

Default exploration pattern:

1. propose 3 distinct directions
2. explain type, palette, layout, and motion thesis for each
3. choose one direction
4. implement with tokens and constraints

When using screenshots:

- decompose into background, UI, and texture layers
- recreate assets separately
- recompose in code

Useful bans:

- no generic SaaS gradients
- no Inter/Roboto unless requested
- no default shadcn look
- no plain CSS animation architecture as the default
- no motion without hierarchy
- no centered-by-habit layouts

When generating video or image backgrounds:

- first frame must work as a poster
- motion must loop cleanly
- preserve negative space for copy
- avoid noisy movement behind text
