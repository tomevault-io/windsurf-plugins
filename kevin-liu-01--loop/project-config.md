# Motion and 3D Rules

Motion is a system with three layers:

- ambient: slow loops, shader drift, environmental life
- interaction: hover, press, open, focus
- narrative: scroll and route choreography

Apply these rules:

- One strong hero move beats many small distractions.
- If a page has a heavy 3D or shader hero, quiet the rest of the UI.
- Do not propose plain CSS as the primary animation system by default.
- Use CSS only for tiny hover/focus states, tokenized fallbacks, native progressive enhancement, and view-transition class styling.
- Use Motion for component and layout animation.
- Use GSAP for orchestration, mixed-surface sequences, and ScrollTrigger narratives.
- Pair GSAP with Lenis when synchronized scroll is part of the concept.
- Use React Three Fiber plus drei for React 3D scenes.
- Use OGL or shader-first pipelines when the surface itself is the product.
- Use shaders when the surface itself is the brand move, not as filler.
- Prefer interruptible transitions for interaction states and keyframes for staged one-shot sequences.
- Animate contextual icon swaps with small opacity, scale, and blur changes instead of hard replacing them.
- Split enter animations into semantic chunks and stagger them lightly.
- Make exit animations subtler than enter animations.
- Treat sound, haptics, and toasts as optional feedback layers for the interaction system, not random garnish.
- Use React `startTransition`, `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, and `useEffectEvent` to keep animated UIs responsive.
- Use React or browser view transitions as progressive enhancement when the support matrix and framework version allow it.

Performance rules:

- Prefer animating `transform` and `opacity`.
- Be careful with `filter`, `backdrop-filter`, large blur, and animated shadow.
- Narrow `will-change` usage.
- Ship a readable poster frame before heavy canvas or video fully hydrates.
- Degrade aggressively on mobile and under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Above-the-fold copy and CTA must remain readable while motion runs.
- Do not animate large blur or shadow changes across big surfaces unless profiling says it is fine.
- Do not hide expensive animation behavior behind giant CSS keyframe stacks.

Parallax rules:

- Keep pointer movement small and clamped.
- Foreground moves more than background.
- Do not put independent drift on every layer.
- Never let text feel detached from its container.
- Keep text and CTA zones on calmer layers than decorative motion.

Scroll rules:

- Every pinned or scrubbed section must explain something.
- Avoid long scroll-jacking sequences.
- Test touch devices before committing to choreography-heavy storytelling.
- Do not drop Lenis into dense docs or dashboards just because it sounds premium.
