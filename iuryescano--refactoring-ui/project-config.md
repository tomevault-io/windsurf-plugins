# Agent Instructions

This repository packages the `refactor-ui` skill for reuse across agent environments.

When a task involves UI review, visual polish, frontend refactoring, dashboard/form/product-screen redesign, or screenshot-based interface critique:

1. Read `refactor-ui/SKILL.md` first.
2. Read `refactor-ui/references/heuristics.md` when a full screen or component audit is useful.
3. Read `refactor-ui/references/recipes.md` when a common weak UI pattern needs concrete repair moves.
4. Preserve functional behavior, accessibility semantics, test selectors, and local design-system conventions.
5. Verify the result at desktop and mobile widths whenever a browser or renderer is available.

Do not treat the root README as operational skill context unless the user asks about installation, packaging, or repository usage.
