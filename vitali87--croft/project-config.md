# Code review guidelines

When reviewing pull requests:

- Only leave comments for critical, major, or high-severity issues: logic
  bugs, security vulnerabilities, data loss or corruption, race conditions,
  and breaking API changes.
- Do NOT comment on code style, formatting, naming, comments/docstrings, or
  minor/optional refactoring suggestions — linters handle those.
- If no issue meets that bar, do not leave any inline comments.
