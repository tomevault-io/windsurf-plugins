## Running the Web Application

### For Automated Testing (Playwright, CI/CD)

**Always use `--no-browser` when running Playwright tests or any automated browser testing:**

```bash
# Correct: Start server without opening a browser tab
python run_app.py --web --port 8080 --no-browser

# Incorrect: This will pop up a browser tab on your default browser
python run_app.py --web --port 8080
```

**Why this matters:**
- When an AI agent runs Playwright or automated tests, it controls its own browser instance
- Without `--no-browser`, the app will open a tab in the user's default browser every time
- This causes random browser popups during test runs, which is disruptive
- The Playwright-controlled browser is separate from the user's browser

**Rule:** If you are writing or running automated tests that involve the web interface, always include `--no-browser` in the server start command.

### For Manual Testing

When you want to manually interact with the UI:
```bash
python run_app.py --web --port 8080
```
This will start the server AND open a browser tab automatically.
