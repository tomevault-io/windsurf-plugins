# agent-skills-platform

Turn any workflow into a reusable, cross-platform agent skill. The user
describes what they do — in plain English, or by handing over a PDF, a link, a
script, a transcript — and this skill builds a complete, validated,
security-scanned agent skill with functional code, its own eval suite, and a
cross-platform installer.

## Activation

Invoke with `/agent-skills-platform <description or material>`, or naturally:

- "Create a skill for analyzing CSV files"
- "Every day I process invoices manually, automate this"
- "Validate this skill" / "Export this skill for Cursor"

## How to use this file

This is the cross-tool companion file (AAIF format). The full factory
instructions — the five-phase pipeline, quality gates, eval emission, and
cross-platform export — live in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) at this repo root. Read
SKILL.md and follow it; treat this file as the pointer, not the instructions.

## What generated skills carry

Every skill this factory produces ships with: spec-compliant SKILL.md +
AGENTS.md, functional scripts, an eval spec with golden cases and a regression
gate (scripts/run_evals.py), a self-maintenance loop (scripts/evolve.py),
plugin manifests for native in-tool installs, and a 17-platform installer.
