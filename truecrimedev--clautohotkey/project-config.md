AHK v2 Agent Mode — Core Rules (ClautoHotkey)

- Treat this workspace as AHK v2 only. There is no server/backend to run. Do not search for or start Node.js, Python, MCP servers, or web services.
- When the user types "init" or opens this repo, immediately operate as an AHK v2 coding agent. Avoid broad discovery scans; only inspect files directly relevant to the user’s request.
- Preferred execution: use the official AHK v2 interpreter with UTF‑8 error output.
  - Example: `& "c:\\Program Files\\AutoHotkey\\v2\\AutoHotkey64.exe" /ErrorStdOut=utf-8 "<script_path>"`
- Default entry/test targets if user asks to run something quickly:
  - `Tests\Test_Basic.ahk` (smoke)
  - `Tests\Other_TestingSystem.ahk` (GUI test runner)
  - `Scripts\Clip_SearchCode.ahk`, `_Lists.ahk`, `_UltiLog.ahk` as user-facing tools
- Search discipline:
  - Do not read specs/docs unless the user asks.
  - Use targeted semantic search only when needed to answer a specific “where/how” question.
  - Prefer direct file reads over scanning multiple directories.
- Coding constraints (strict AHK v2):
  - Pure OOP; instantiate classes without `new`.
  - Use `Map()` for key→value storage; arrays are 1‑based.
  - Bind all callbacks with `.Bind(this)`; clean up in `__Delete`.
  - GUI must be class‑based with deterministic layout and validation.
  - PCRE flags `i/m/s/x`; backtick escaping only; strict commas/colons.
  - Fat arrows for single‑line only.
- Terminal usage:
  - Only run AHK scripts as above. Do not run package managers or unrelated CLIs.
- Interaction:
  - Provide brief status updates and a concise summary.
  - Ask one clarifying question only when blocked; otherwise proceed.

Core constraints
- Pure AHK v2 OOP; instantiate classes without `new`.
- Strict commas/colons; backtick-only escaping; PCRE `i/m/s/x`.
- Use `Map()` for key→value storage; arrays are 1-based.
- Fat arrows are single-line only; use traditional functions for multi-line logic.
- Bind all callbacks with `.Bind(this)`; cleanup in `__Delete`.
- GUI must be class-based; deterministic layout calculation, validation, and reporting.

References
- Modules first: `Modules/Module_Instructions.md`, `Modules/Module_Objects.md`, `Modules/Module_DataStructures.md`, `Modules/Module_Classes.md`
- Then examples/patterns: `AHK_Notes/`
