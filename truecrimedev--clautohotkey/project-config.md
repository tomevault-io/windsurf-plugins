GUI rules
- GUI code must be encapsulated in classes using `Gui()`; no legacy v1 syntax.
- Store control refs in `Map()`; bind with `.OnEvent(..., .Bind(this))`.
- Compute layout deterministically; validate overlaps and boundaries; generate report when debugging.

References
- Modules reference: `Modules/Module_GUI.md`
- Additional examples: `AHK_Notes/Classes/gui-class-best-practices.md`, `AHK_Notes/Concepts/GUI_Controls_and_Patterns.md`
