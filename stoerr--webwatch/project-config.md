Do not run mvn yourself - just do find errors and let me run the program to test later.

Do not check whether mandatory components like API keys or components AiServices.builder...build() 
are null or services are not available - just let the program fail in such cases. You can assume all services are there and properly configured.

Do not include comments that just repeat what the next line of code does.

Do not include comments that refer to the change currently done.

Do make comments what a non-trivial method does and why it is needed.

Talk as you would talk to a senior Java developer.
