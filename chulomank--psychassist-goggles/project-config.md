# Copilot Instructions

When working in this repository:

1. Treat `architecture/architecture-final.md` and `architecture/adr/*.md` as authoritative once they exist.
2. For architecture work, follow:
   - `ai/workflows/architecture-workflow-architecture-doc-only.md`
3. For implementation work, follow:
   - `ai/workflows/engineering-workflow.md`
4. Use `ai/project-context.md` as additional context.
5. Prefer vertical slices.
6. Prefer modular monolith unless another pattern is explicitly justified.
7. Do not introduce new architecture without review.
8. Respect TDD and decomposition / execution skills.
9. If a feature spec exists for the selected slice, treat it as a primary input for decomposition and implementation.
10. See `ai/guides/glossary.md` for definitions of key terms used throughout the toolkit.
