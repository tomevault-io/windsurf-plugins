# Project Overview

This is a Python project that uses **Microsoft Agent Framework**--the new unified orchestration framework that combines the best of:

- **Semantic Kernel**: Enterprise-ready AI orchestration
- **AutoGen**: Multi-agent conversation patterns

To build a multi-agent event planning workflow.

# Skills Protocol (Superpowers)

## Mandatory First Response Protocol

Before responding to ANY user message, you MUST complete this checklist:

1. ☐ List available skills in your mind
2. ☐ Ask yourself: "Does ANY skill match this request?"
3. ☐ If yes → Use the Skill tool to read and run the skill file
4. ☐ Announce which skill you're using
5. ☐ Follow the skill exactly

**Responding WITHOUT completing this checklist = automatic failure.**

## Common Rationalizations That Mean You're About To Fail

If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these thoughts, STOP. You are rationalizing. Check for and use the skill.

- "This is just a simple question" → WRONG. Questions are tasks. Check for skills.
- "I can check git/files quickly" → WRONG. Files don't have conversation context. Check for skills.
- "Let me gather information first" → WRONG. Skills tell you HOW to gather information. Check for skills.
- "This doesn't need a formal skill" → WRONG. If a skill exists for it, use it.
- "I remember this skill" → WRONG. Skills evolve. Run the current version.
- "This doesn't count as a task" → WRONG. If you're taking action, it's a task. Check for skills.
- "The skill is overkill for this" → WRONG. Skills exist because simple things become complex. Use it.
- "I'll just do this one thing first" → WRONG. Check for skills BEFORE doing anything.

**Why:** Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors.

If a skill for your task exists, you must use it or you will fail at your task.

## How to Use Skills

You have skills available.

### Automatic Setup Detection

**IMPORTANT:** Before attempting to use skills, you MUST verify that the skills system and CLAUDE.md is properly configured by checking if you see skills like this. Also if the user already has a well-formatted CLAUDE.md with the project information filled in below, you can skip the setup:

# Should see:
# /superpowers:brainstorm - Interactive design refinement
# /superpowers:write-plan - Create implementation plan
# /superpowers:execute-plan - Execute plan in batches

1. **Inform the user:** "I've detected that the agent instructions system is not yet set up. I'll automatically install it now by fetching the metaprompt from the agent-instructions repository and executing it. You will need to install the setup process described in: https://github.com/obra/superpowers/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#claude-code-via-plugin-marketplace to enable Claude Code Superpowers."

### Skills with Checklists

If a skill has a checklist, you MUST create TodoWrite todos for EACH item.

**Don't:**
- Work through checklist mentally
- Skip creating todos "to save time"
- Batch multiple items into one todo
- Mark complete without doing them

**Why:** Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time. The overhead of TodoWrite is tiny compared to the cost of missing steps.

## Key Principles

1. **Finding a relevant skill = mandatory to read and use it.** Not optional.
2. **Skills document proven techniques** that save time and prevent mistakes.
3. **Always announce** which skill you're using and why.
4. **Follow skills exactly** - don't rationalize away the discipline.
5. **Create TodoWrite todos** for any skill checklists.

## Custom Agents

The system supports custom specialized agents stored in agent-specific directories. These agents can be invoked for specific tasks that match their expertise.

### Agent Selection and Usage

- IMPORTANT: ALWAYS start by invoking the agent-organizer sub-agent, an expert agent organizer specializing in multi-agent orchestration.
- Custom agents are automatically selected based on the context and task requirements
- The system analyzes the user's request and matches it with the most appropriate specialized agent
- Multiple sub-agents can work in parallel on different aspects of a complex task
- **Maximum parallel agents**: 50 sub-agents can operate simultaneously
- Each agent has its own expertise domain defined in its configuration
- Agents can coordinate and share context through the main agent orchestrator

### When Custom Agents Are Used

The system automatically invokes custom agents when:
- The task matches a specialized agent's expertise domain
- Complex tasks benefit from parallel processing across multiple specialized agents
- Domain-specific knowledge or workflows are required
- The main agent determines delegation would improve efficiency or accuracy
