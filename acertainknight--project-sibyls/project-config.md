 --- General Style & Formatting ---
 • Adhere strictly to PEP 8 and Ruff formatting standards.
 • Use descriptive variable names and avoid unnecessary abbreviations.
 • Prefer early returns for clarity and minimal nesting.
 • Always generate complete, working code with no TODOs or placeholders.
 • Format code using standard Python conventions with minimal manual adjustments.

 --- Type Hints & Documentation ---
 • Automatically include Python type hints for every function and method.
 • For every function or class, generate a Google-style docstring that includes:
    - A brief description of the function’s purpose.
    - A Parameters section with types and descriptions.
    - A Returns section with type and explanation.
    - An Example section when applicable (especially for data manipulation functions).
 • When handling DataFrame operations, include a section detailing the expected structure (e.g., column names and data types).
 • Ensure that all generated docstrings are copy-paste ready for integration with Google Docs.

 --- Code Generation & Refactoring ---
 • Always produce code that is modular and broken into logical functions or classes.
 • If generating data science code, default to using libraries such as pandas, numpy, and plotly.
 • When handling statistical or machine learning tasks, include basic logging and error handling.
 • If code is complex, add inline comments (describing the “why” behind key operations) to facilitate future documentation.
 • Generate complete code blocks including all necessary imports at the top.
 • When suggesting refactoring, ensure that the revised code remains fully functional and improves readability.

 --- Context Awareness & Integration ---
 • Assume a data science context. When generating functions, check if the operation is on dataframes or numerical arrays.
 • Automatically integrate typing hints and Google-style documentation in every generated snippet.
 • When referencing external documentation (e.g., for Google Docs integration), include a comment explaining the integration process.
 • For multi-file projects, support context via the "@" syntax so that code spanning multiple modules is well-coordinated.
 • Use contextual cues to tailor examples: if the function involves CSV reading, generate code that uses pandas.read_csv with proper error checks.

 --- Special Instructions for Data Science & Python Development ---
 • Default to generating code that uses:
       import pandas as pd, numpy as np, plotly.express as px
 • When a function deals with data cleaning or analysis, include an explanation of assumptions (e.g., missing values handling).
 • If generating machine learning code, assume a PyTorch workflow (with device settings using torch.device(...) as needed).
 • When generating code snippets that involve documentation export (e.g., to Google Docs), include instructions as comments.
 • Prioritize readability: if a more concise or vectorized solution exists (e.g., using list comprehensions or pandas vectorized methods), use it.

 --- Example Rule for Automatic Documentation ---
 "When generating a new Python function:
   - Always provide a docstring in the following format:

       def function_name(param1: Type, param2: Type) -> ReturnType:
           \"\"\"
           Brief one-sentence description.

           Args:
               param1 (Type): Description.
               param2 (Type): Description.

           Returns:
               ReturnType: Description of the returned value.

           Example:
               >>> function_name(example_param1, example_param2)
           \"\"\"
           ... (function body) ...
 "

 This rule should be applied universally to all functions and methods.
