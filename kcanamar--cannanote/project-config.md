# CannaNote Development Roadmap

## Core Philosophy: Kina'ole Development

The primary metric for success is reducing cannabis session logging to under 30 seconds on mobile devices. All features and infrastructure decisions must align with our privacy promises—kina'ole development where our actions match our values.

## 🌱 GERMINATION CYCLE: Privacy Foundation

**Status**: Our privacy promises exceed our technical implementation. This foundation must be established before other cultivation can begin.

**Historical Context**: After performance optimization work (Alpine.js → vanilla JS, Tailwind v4 migration), we recognized that true privacy requires architectural changes, not just framework choices.

### Data Encryption & Local-First
- **Local Storage Primary** - Web: IndexedDB, Mobile: Drift as primary storage
- **Encrypted Cloud Sync** - Sync only encrypted blobs and metadata (paid feature)
- **Human-Controlled Keys** - Keys from human credentials, never server-side
- **Data Export** - Complete portable data export

### True Consent Management
- **Granular Permissions** - Specific, revocable consent per data type
- **Local-Only Default** - Cloud sync as explicit opt-in (premium feature)
- **Transparency Dashboard** - Real-time view of data storage locations
- **Complete Deletion** - Full data purging including backups
- **Consent History** - Audit trail of permission changes

### Privacy Validation Through Beta
- **Beta Launch as Privacy Test** - Real humans testing local-first architecture
- **Automated Privacy Tests** - Verify encryption and access controls
- **Data Flow Mapping** - Document all personal data paths
- **Encryption Test Suite** - Comprehensive client-side crypto testing
- **Cross-Platform Consistency** - Identical privacy on web and mobile

**Goal**: Technical delivery of "radical data transparency" promise validated by real cannabis community members.

## 🌿 SEEDLING CYCLE: PWA-First Beta Launch

**Strategic Decision**: PWA-first approach validates core experience and API design before Flutter investment, getting cannabis community feedback faster.

**Business Model Foundation**: Local-first with optional premium sync establishes sustainable revenue while respecting human autonomy.

### Authentication Foundation

#### Supabase Integration (Auth Only - No Cannabis Data)
- **Email Signup Flow** - Email verification → profile creation → beta status
- **Database Schema**:
  ```sql
  profiles (
    id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    email TEXT,
    beta_joined_at TIMESTAMP,
    subscription_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'beta_grandfathered',
    beta_status TEXT DEFAULT 'waitlist', -- waitlist, invited, active
    referral_code TEXT UNIQUE,
    invited_at TIMESTAMP,
    activated_at TIMESTAMP
  )
  ```
- **Row Level Security** - Humans can only access their own profile data
- **Beta Grandfathering** - Lifetime sync access for early community members

#### Email System Setup (Resend + cannanote.org)
- **Welcome Email** - Immediate signup confirmation with privacy commitment
- **Beta Invitation** - Personal access link when spots available

  ```javascript
  sessions: {
    id: uuid,
    timestamp: datetime,
    strain: { name, type, thc_percent, cbd_percent },
    consumption: { method, amount, unit },
    setting: { location_type, mood_before, social_context },
    effects: { onset_minutes, duration_hours, intensity_1_10, feelings: [] },
