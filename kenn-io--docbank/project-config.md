# AGENTS.md

Instructions for autonomous coding agents working in this repository.

## Build and Test

- Go 1.26+ (go.mod is authoritative). Go 1.26 language features — e.g.
  value-form `new(v)` — are in use; verify against the toolchain before
  treating unfamiliar syntax as an error.
- Every build and test needs the fts5 tag: `make test` or
  `go test -tags fts5 ./...`. CGO builds use mattn SQLite; the supported
  pure-Go path uses `CGO_ENABLED=0` and modernc SQLite. Keep the complete suite
  passing in both modes.
- Lint with `make lint` (golangci-lint, fts5 tag). Docs build strict with
  `make docs-build`; fix every warning.
- Linux, macOS, and Windows are supported. Windows CI runs the complete CLI,
  daemon, lock, backup, and restore suite on amd64 and arm64; do not replace
  real platform behavior with compile-only stubs.

## Private Data Boundary

- Never put private developer information in tracked files. Tests, fixtures,
  golden files, examples, and documentation must use synthetic data—not files,
  filenames, directory structure, document contents, credentials, session
  transcripts, hashes, or metadata copied from a developer's home directory or
  personal corpus.
- Access a real personal corpus only with explicit authorization for that
  validation. Keep the source read-only, work in an owner-private isolated
  directory outside the repository, and emit only aggregate evidence unless
  the user explicitly requests otherwise.
- Before handing off a real-corpus validation, stop its processes and remove
  every temporary vault, backup, restore, binary, report, mismatch list, log,
  and cache created for the run—even when the validation fails. Confirm the
  cleanup rather than assuming a deferred cleanup ran.

## Git Rules

1. Commit every turn that changes tracked files; never amend.
2. Never push to or commit on main — feature branches and PRs only.
3. Do not merge pull requests; opening and reporting them is the agent's
   job, merging is the user's.
4. Run `prek run` before committing.
5. Write pull request descriptions for humans. Lead with the user-visible
   outcome in plain language and, when useful, one concrete example. Explain
   the important safety boundary or tradeoff without making the reader decode
   internal types, record names, endpoints, or implementation chronology.
   Keep the rationale, but avoid robotic implementation inventories.
6. Do not add routine `Validation`, `Testing`, or checklist sections for
   `make test`, lint, docs, vet, `prek`, CI, or ordinary conformance suites;
   report those results in the handoff instead. Include validation in the PR
   body only when it is novel evidence that materially informs review, such as
   a migration rehearsal, benchmark, real-vault hardening run, or compatibility
   experiment.

## Releases

- Cut releases only from a clean local `main` that exactly matches
  `origin/main`.
- Preview notes with `scripts/changelog.sh <version>`; publish with
  `scripts/release.sh <version> [extra_instructions] [start_tag]`. Supply the
  optional start tag only when notes must span an intervening tag that did not
  publish.
- The release script creates and pushes an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag. The release
  workflow uses the tag body as GitHub release notes and falls back to generated
  notes only for a lightweight or empty tag.

## Design Invariants

- Standalone CLI operation is daemon-first: CLI commands are HTTP clients
  (`client.Ensure`) and never open a vault directly. Go applications may use
  the public embedded API to own separately rooted vaults in-process. Embedded
  and daemon ownership share the same exclusive hierarchy lock; never create a
  privileged path into a daemon-owned vault.
- The daemon always enforces an API key (ephemeral per-run when none is
  configured, published via the runtime record). Binds are loopback-only.
- Packed storage is managed, not a user-selected format. The ordinary operator
  surface is status, pack, and repack. Do not expose Kit's unpack primitive as
  a general API or CLI command; reserve it for tests, migrations, or a
  purpose-built emergency recovery workflow with a demonstrated need.
- Documentation is not the implementation tracker. User- and agent-facing
  pages describe shipped capabilities and current limitations. Architecture
  and internal pages may preserve durable future design under explicit
  `!!! info "Planned"` admonitions, but must not carry task breakdowns,
  sequencing, ownership, or completion criteria. `docs/roadmap.md` is the one
  high-level public product-status view; kata is the sole source of truth for
  actionable work and its status.
- No storage compatibility boundary exists before the first public release.
  Keep the live schema and deterministic JSONL authority at format v1, make
  breaking pre-release changes directly, and treat vaults created by earlier
  development commits as disposable. Do not build migrations, logical
  cutovers, compatibility decoders, downgrade fences, or old-binary matrices
  for unreleased layouts. After the first public release, define compatibility
  work only when an actual released-format change requires it.
