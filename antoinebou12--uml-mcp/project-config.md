## Learned User Preferences

- In documentation and attributions, spell the maintainer name as Antoine Boucher; do not abbreviate it to "Antoine Bou".
- Pin `astral-sh/setup-uv` in GitHub Actions to a full release tag (for example `v8.1.0`) or an explicit commit SHA; do not use a bare `@v8` ref, because that action is not published as a floating major tag and Actions fails to resolve it.
- For the root `README.md`, prefer compact markdown tables for reference-style blocks (for example environment variables with defaults, deployment URLs, MCP tools and `uml://` resources) when improving scanability; keep deeper topics such as the diagram fallback pipeline in `docs/` rather than duplicating them in the README unless asked.

## Learned Workspace Facts

- Python dependencies and the lockfile are driven by `uv` (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`); after constraint changes, expect `uv lock` / `uv sync` and CI parity with `uv lock --check` where applicable; when the checked-in `requirements.txt` / `requirements-dev.txt` pins are maintained, regenerate them with `uv export` so they match the lockfile.
- `tests/test_diagram_prompts.py` expects `.cursor/skills/uml-mcp-diagrams/SKILL.md` in the clone; `.gitignore` ignores `.cursor/*` except that path so CI can read it—keep the file in sync with `.skill/skills/uml-mcp-diagrams/SKILL.md`.
- Multi-version Python work in this repo has treated 3.12 as the primary baseline while also exercising 3.14 in CI matrices when supported; widening `requires-python` and regenerating the lock goes with that pattern.
