# AGENTS.md

This repository is designed primarily for autonomous coding and operations agents. These rules
are normative.

## Mission

Build the most efficient, reliable, inspectable, and economically scalable semantic control
plane for Dwarf Fortress. Treat the game as a partially observed evolving civilization, not a
keyboard-and-screen toy. State must be versioned explicitly; authority must be scoped; mutations
must be planned, witnessed, authorized, committed, observed, and proved.

## Required reading order

1. `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
2. `README.md`
3. `FRANKENSTACK_DEEP_DIVE.md`
4. `COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_DWARF_FORTRESS_MCP.md`
5. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
6. `docs/WORLD_STATE_MVCC.md`
7. `docs/FORTRESS_GRAPH_ALGORITHMS.md`
8. `docs/ATP_STATE_AND_EVIDENCE_PLANE.md`
9. `docs/DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md`
10. `MCP_SURFACE.md`
11. `docs/FASTMCP_INTEGRATION.md`
12. `docs/DOGFOODING_FASTMCP.md`
13. relevant machine registries under `architecture/` and `design/registries/`

## Constitutional engineering rules

- Rust 2024 on the latest nightly toolchain.
- Safe Rust throughout the Rust workspace: `unsafe_code = "forbid"`.
- The dependency universe is closed. Use `asupersync`, owned Franken-suite crates, the owned
  `fastmcp_rust` MCP plane (modern-only MCP 2026-07-28, exact-revision pinned; ADR-013), and only
  the explicitly admitted fundamental crates. Do not introduce Tokio, async-std, petgraph,
  rusqlite, reqwest, axum, tonic, prost, any non-owned MCP framework, or another hidden runtime.
  The transport adds no authority: no fastmcp type crosses the intent, world, or adapter seams.
- MCP is 2026-07-28, modern-only, forever. Never enable the `legacy-2024-11-05` graph. Transport
  defects are filed upstream against `Dicklesworthstone/fastmcp_rust` and fixed here only by
  recorded pin bumps with conformance notes (`docs/DOGFOODING_FASTMCP.md`); masking them
  dfmcp-side is a bug in this repository.
- `asupersync` is the sole asynchronous runtime, structured-concurrency substrate, cancellation
  model, deterministic laboratory, and ATP foundation.
- No detached task, thread, watcher, cache maintainer, bridge request, checkpoint writer, or
  evidence publisher. Every unit of work belongs to a supervised region whose close implies
  quiescence.
- Every function that can block, perform I/O, acquire shared resources, or consume a bounded
  budget carries explicit context/authority.
- No direct memory scraping or C/C++ FFI in the Rust trust domain. The DFHack integration is an
  out-of-process, bounded, versioned bridge using supported DFHack facilities.
- No arbitrary shell, Lua, DFHack command, or path execution through the default MCP surface.

## State and transaction rules

- The canonical world is multi-version. Never replace it with one mutable “current snapshot.”
- Every plan records positive reads, relation/range reads, aggregate reads, negative reads,
  adapter/schema/topology epochs, and intended writes at the coarsest sound granularity.
- Witness refinement may reduce false conflicts but may never introduce a false negative. Budget
  exhaustion means conservative replan, not guessed safety.
- Leases fence ownership; witnesses validate knowledge. A mutating commit requires both when both
  apply.
- Observation is cursor-anchored. Never silently bridge a gap or cross a restore epoch.
- Entity generation prevents ABA reuse; revision orders updates within a generation.
- Semantic rebase attempts intent replay first, stable-key structural merge second, and explicit
  rejection third. Raw-byte merge of structured state is forbidden.
- A successful merge emits a deterministic certificate covering normal form, tie-break policy,
  read/write witnesses, and resulting state digest.
- Derived graph/search/index generations are immutable. Publish artifacts first, validate them,
  and swap the tiny root last. Partial publication is not a generation.

## Effects, obligations, and evidence

- A transport acknowledgment is not game mutation success, and game mutation success is not goal
  completion.
- Mutations use prepare, revalidate, commit, observe, and prove.
- Every mutating request has a stable idempotency key and an effect-journal identity.
- Two-phase effects apply to bridge mutation, observation publication, evidence publication, and
  checkpoint publication where partial completion would be ambiguous.
- Long-running work is a bounded obligation with terminal and failure predicates, game-time
  deadline, cadence, stability requirement, evidence, and cancellation policy.
- Cancellation is request, measurable drain progress, and finalize. It is not forgetting the
  operation.
- Indeterminate effects remain indeterminate until reconciled.
- Negative evidence can reject a claim but cannot certify success.
- ATP may move checkpoints, evidence, immutable generations, and state deltas. It may never become
  an alternate mutation authority.

## Determinism and graph rules

- Same canonical state, request, policy, seed, and budget must produce byte-identical eligible
  results, including order.
- Every graph algorithm with multiple valid outputs declares a canonical tie-break policy.
- Load-bearing graph decisions emit complexity and decision-path witnesses.
