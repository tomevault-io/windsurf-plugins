# Sailfish Pool Agent Guide

## Purpose

This repository is a very small, header-only C allocator.

- Product: `sfpool`, a secure-ish small-block memory pool with fallback to system allocation.
- Primary artifact: [`sfpool.h`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/sfpool.h)
- Main consumers in this repo: the stress test [`sfpool_test.c`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/sfpool_test.c) and the Lua allocator integration test [`test_lua.c`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/test_lua.c)
- Non-code support: [`README.md`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/README.md), [`GNUmakefile`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/GNUmakefile), CI workflows under [`.github/workflows`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/.github/workflows)

The entire meaningful codebase is under 650 lines. Do not invent layers, wrappers, or abstractions unless explicitly asked. Preserve the header-only design.

## Context Loading Order

Load files in this order and stop as soon as you have enough context:

1. [`README.md`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/README.md) for intent, portability claims, and supported usage.
2. [`GNUmakefile`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/GNUmakefile) for the real test/build entrypoints.
3. [`sfpool.h`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/sfpool.h) because it contains both API and implementation.
4. [`sfpool_test.c`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/sfpool_test.c) if the task touches allocator semantics or regressions.
5. [`test_lua.c`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/test_lua.c) if the task touches embedded-Lua integration or long-running allocator behavior.
6. [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/.github/workflows/main.yml) only for CI-specific work.

Usually you do not need anything else.

## Repository Map

- [`sfpool_test.c`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/sfpool_test.c): randomized stress test for allocate/free/realloc patterns.
- [`test_lua.c`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/test_lua.c): plugs `sfpool` into Lua via `lua_newstate`.
- [`GNUmakefile`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/GNUmakefile): local QA commands, Lua download/build, WASM build.

- [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/.github/workflows/main.yml): CI matrix.
- [`.github/workflows/doxygen-gh-pages.yml`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/.github/workflows/doxygen-gh-pages.yml): docs deployment.

Ignore downloaded Lua artifacts unless the task is about `check-lua`.

## Mental Model

`sfpool` is a fixed-block allocator:

- One `sfpool_t` owns one preallocated arena.
- `block_size` must be a power of two.
- The pool embeds a singly linked free list inside free blocks.
- Allocations `<= block_size` come from the pool while free blocks remain.
- Larger allocations, or small allocations after exhaustion, fall back to system `malloc` when `FALLBACK` is enabled.
- `sfpool_free` decides between pool return and system `free` via pointer-range membership.
- `sfpool_realloc` keeps in-pool pointers in place when the new size still fits; otherwise it migrates to system allocation.

This is not a general allocator replacement:

- callers must explicitly create and tear down `sfpool_t`
- a pool is not thread-safe
- intended workload is many small allocations, especially sub-256-byte objects

## Core Data And API

Important fields in `sfpool_t`:

- `buffer`: raw allocation returned by platform allocator
- `data`: aligned pool base used for blocks
- `free_list`: head of embedded free-list
- `free_count`, `total_blocks`, `total_bytes`, `block_size`: allocator state
- profiling counters behind `PROFILING`

Public high-level API:

- `sfpool_init`
- `sfpool_teardown`
- `sfpool_malloc`
- `sfpool_free`
- `sfpool_realloc`
- `sfpool_contains`
- `sfpool_status`

Utility API exposed publicly:

- `sfutil_zero`
- `sfutil_memalign`
- `sfutil_secalloc`
- `sfutil_secfree`

## Platform Behavior

Allocation backend varies by target:

- Emscripten: `malloc` / `free`
- Windows: `VirtualAlloc` / `VirtualFree`
- Apple: `mmap` plus `mlock`
- Other POSIX: `mmap`, optionally `MAP_LOCKED` if `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` allows it

Pointer-size configuration is compile-time:

- 64-bit targets use `uint64_t`, 8-byte pointer alignment, 16-byte struct alignment
- 32-bit targets use `uint32_t`, 4-byte pointer alignment, 8-byte struct alignment

## Compile-Time Switches

These macros are enabled by default inside [`sfpool.h`](/home/jrml/devel/sailfish-pool/sfpool.h):

- `SECURE_ZERO`
- `FALLBACK`
- `PROFILING`

They materially change behavior. Do not remove or redefine them casually in downstream code without checking tests and expected stats output.

## Tests And Commands

Primary local commands:

- `make sfpool_test`: build the standalone stress test with sanitizers
- `make check`: run six stress-test parameter combinations
- `make check-lua`: download/build Lua 5.4.7, compile `test_lua`, run Lua upstream tests with `sfpool`
