# Coding Instructions for GitHub Copilot

- Always use primary constructors in C#
- Always run dotnet build after making a change
- Always use System.Text.Json over Newtonsoft
- Always put new classes and interfaces in separate files
- Always make members static if they can be
- All generated code needs to be AOT safe
- Always review your own code for consistency, maintainability, and testability
- Always ask for clarifications if the request is ambiguous or lacks sufficient context.

## Engineering System

- Use `./eng/scripts/Build-Local.ps1 -UsePaths -VerifyNpx` to verify changes to powershell, c# project files and npm packages
- Don't run local builds to check pipeline YAML files (e.g., files in `eng/pipelines/` with `.yml` extension)

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure all tests pass
- Follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Include appropriate documentation
- Include tests that cover your changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
- Run `.\eng\common\spelling\Invoke-Cspell.ps1`
- Create the auto-generated PR body as normal, but `copilot` should add an additional section after all of its regular PR body content. The contents should be:
  ```
  ## Invoking Livetests

  Copilot submitted PRs are not trustworthy by default. Users with `write` access to the repo need to validate the contents of this PR before leaving a comment with the text `/azp run mcp - pullrequest - live`. This will trigger the necessary livetest workflows to complete required validation.
  ```

## Transitioning Live Tests to Recorded Tests

- Always convert `tool` services to inject `IHttpClientFactory` into its clients and use `IHttpClientFactory.CreateClient` method to instantiate the `HttpClient` for usage in the tool classes' methods.
  - If `IHttpClientFactory` is already injected into the client, ensure that `IHttpClientFactory.CreateClient` is used to instantiate the `HttpClient`. If this is done, then no further action is needed.
- Always re-parent test classes parented by `CommandTestsBase` to `RecordedCommandTestsBase`. This will require minor fixture adjustments.
- Always generate a new `assets.json` file alongside the livetest csproj file if one does not exist. This file should contain the following content:
  ```jsonc
  {
    "AssetsRepo": "Azure/azure-sdk-assets",
    "AssetsRepoPrefixPath": "",
    "TagPrefix": "<LiveTestCsProjFileNameWithoutExtension>", // e.g., "Azure.Mcp.Tools.KeyVault.Tests"
    "Tag": ""
  }
  ```
- Copilot should utilize the [recorded test documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/docs/recorded-tests.md) in `docs/recorded-tests.md` for more details on how to convert and validate recorded tests.
