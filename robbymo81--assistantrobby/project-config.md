# Gemini Diagnostics Log - 2026-02-14

This log summarizes the state of the environment and codebase during a diagnostic session.

## Key Findings

### 1. Build Environment (Node.js)

- **Problem**: The `pnpm build` command fails because the `bash` script runner cannot find the `node` executable (`node: command not found`).
- **Diagnostics**:
    - `node -v` succeeds (`v22.13.1`), confirming Node.js is installed and available in the interactive shell.
    - `Get-Command node` in PowerShell reveals the path: `C:\Users\RobMo\dev	ools
ode.exe`.
- **Conclusion**: The `PATH` to the Node.js executable is not being correctly propagated to the non-interactive `bash` environment used by the build scripts.

### 2. Build Environment (Docker)

- **Problem**: `docker build` commands fail.
- **Diagnostics**: `docker info` confirms that the Docker daemon is not running.
- **Conclusion**: The Docker Desktop application needs to be started.

### 3. Codebase State (`src/security` module)

- **Problem**: The project's recovery plan aimed to restore a synchronous authentication flow, but the build was failing.
- **Diagnostics**:
    - The recovery documentation (`docs/security/task.md`) explicitly mentions the goal of restoring a "**Synchronous Call Chain**".
    - The actual code restored in `src/security/` (e.g., `src/security/audit.ts`) is **asynchronous**, making heavy use of `async`/`await` and `Promise`.
- **Conclusion**: A contradiction exists. The `git checkout` command restored the last committed version of the code, which was the asynchronous implementation, not the intended synchronous baseline. The "async infection" is still present in the codebase.
