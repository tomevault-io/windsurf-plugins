description: Require explicit user authorization for Git mutations

# Git mutation policy

- Never automatically commit, amend, push, force-push, or create/update a pull request.
- Leave ordinary fixes as working-tree changes unless the user explicitly requests the specific Git or GitHub action.
- A request to implement or fix code alone does not authorize a commit or push.
