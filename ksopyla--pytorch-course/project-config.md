### Jupyter Notebook Rules for Cursor:


1.  **Investigation Strategy:**
    *   A comprehensive suite of tools is available to inspect notebooks. If the user mentions an issue, a specific cell, or asks for a modification, first attempt to gather context independently.
    *   Use the available tools to examine the notebook structure, content, metadata, and outputs to locate the relevant context or identify the problem.
    *   Ask the user for clarification only if the necessary information cannot be determined after using the investigation tools.

2. **Links and References:**
    *   Use relative links to reference other notebooks.
    *   Use the `../` prefix to navigate up one level in the directory structure.
    *   Do not include the `.ipynb` extension in the link. 
    *   Check the folder structure and the links in the notebook to make sure the link is correct, add the parent folder to the link if needed.

3.  **Math Notation:** For LaTeX in Markdown cells, use `$ ... $` for inline math and `$$ ... $$` for display math. Avoid `\( ... \)` and `\[ ... \]`.

4.  **Cell Magics:**
    *   Avoid unsupported cell magics like `%%bash`, `%%timeit`, and `%%writefile`.
    *   Use `!command` for shell commands instead of `%%bash`.
    *   Use `%timeit` (line magic) for timing single statements.
    *   `%%html` works for rendering HTML output.
    *   `%%javascript` can execute (e.g., `alert`), but avoid relying on it for manipulating cell output display.

5.  **Rich Outputs:** Matplotlib, Pandas DataFrames, Plotly, ipywidgets (`tqdm.notebook`), and embedded HTML in Markdown generally render correctly.

6.  **Mermaid:** Diagrams in ` ```mermaid ``` ` blocks are not rendered by default.

7.  **Character Escaping in `source` Parameter:**
    *   When providing the `source` string for `add_cell` or `edit_cell`, ensure that backslashes (`\`) are handled correctly. Newline characters **must** be represented as `\n` (not `\\n`), and LaTeX commands **must** use single backslashes (e.g., `\Sigma`, not `\\Sigma`).
    *   Incorrect escaping by the tool or its interpretation can break Markdown formatting (like paragraphs intended to be separated by `\n\n`) and LaTeX rendering.

    *   After adding or editing cells with complex strings (especially those involving newlines or LaTeX), consider using `read_cell` to verify the content was saved exactly as intended and correct if necessary.
