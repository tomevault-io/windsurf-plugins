## Cursor Skills Repository

This is a **skills distribution repository** - a curated collection of skills for Cursor AI agents.

### Repository Purpose

Users import skills from this repo into their projects via:
1. **Cursor Settings** (recommended) - Add as Remote Rule from GitHub
2. **Manual copy** - Clone and copy `skills/` to `.cursor/skills/`
3. **MCP Server** (advanced) - Global skill access via `mcp/skills_mcp.py`

### When Working in This Repo

**Creating/Editing Skills:**
- Each skill lives in `skills/{skill-name}/`
- Skill must have `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
- Use `skill-creator` for guidance on new skills
- Optional: `scripts/`, `references/`, `LICENSE.txt`

**Maintaining the Repo:**
- Standard Cursor behavior - read files, write code, fix bugs
- Keep README.md updated with new skills
- Maintain MCP server in `mcp/` for advanced users
