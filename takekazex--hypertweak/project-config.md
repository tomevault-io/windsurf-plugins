# Coding Agent Guide

HyperTweak keeps agent operating rules in this file and project facts in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). Read both before changing code. When they differ from
the repository, trust the repository and update the reference documentation if
needed.

## Workflow and Boundaries

1. Inspect the working tree and the relevant implementation, tests, and build
   files before editing.
2. Make the smallest change that satisfies the request. Reuse existing
   architecture, components, and helpers; avoid unrelated refactors.
3. Preserve user changes already present in the worktree. Do not use
   destructive Git commands such as `reset --hard` or `checkout --`.
4. Confirm before deleting material, publishing externally, changing access or
   permissions, or expanding the task beyond the repository.
5. Validate in proportion to risk, then report changed files, checks run, and
   any remaining limitations.

## Android and Hook Safety

- Isolate exceptions in cross-process hooks, reflection, and system-host
  callbacks so a failure cannot crash the hooked process.
- Prefer safe casts and null-aware handling at platform boundaries.
- Cache reflection fields, methods, and class resolutions on hot paths; do not
  repeat lookups during animations or frequent callbacks.
- Access runtime settings through `Preferences`, including cross-process state,
  rather than bypassing the project preference abstraction.

## Reverse Engineering

- Keep extracted platform APK/JAR files and decompiler output outside the
  repository in `/Users/ink/developer/reverse`. Extract only the components
  needed for the current investigation.
- Store source artifacts at the reverse-workspace root with version or build
  information in the filename. Do not assume an unversioned artifact such as
  `SystemUI.apk` is the current device build; use the current baseline recorded
  in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).
- Store all derived output under `/Users/ink/developer/reverse/cache`, never in
  the repository or beside the source artifact. New caches should use
  `<component>-<first-16-SHA-256>` and contain the applicable `input/`, `jadx/`,
  `apktool/`, and `SHA256SUMS` entries.
- Verify the complete source SHA-256 before reusing a cache. Preserve older
  artifacts and caches unless the user explicitly approves their removal.
- Use JADX output for source navigation and APKTool output for manifests,
  resources, and smali. A JADX decompilation failure is not evidence that a
  class or method is absent; confirm uncertain behavior in smali or runtime
  logs.

## Root-Cause Audit Before Implementation

For every new feature, new implementation, or bug fix in a hooked app, audit
the root cause in the target's decompiled sources before writing any hook:

1. Trace the complete mechanism end to end — entry/UI gate, persistence,
   parse/dispatch, and final render/application. Record the exact classes,
   methods, and fields at every layer, and which process runs them (manifests
   may declare secondaries such as `:keyguardeditor`; hooks must attach there
   too).
2. Verify the capability exists at the final layer. A gate being UI-only does
   not mean the effect is implementable elsewhere: the 时钟玻璃 attempt showed
   an editor-only unlock saves fine while the material rendering exists solely
   inside one template family's custom view (see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)).
   If the last layer cannot be reached by hooking, report that and confirm the
   scope with the user instead of shipping a no-op.
3. Implement against the shapes verified in that exact build: resolve classes
   and methods by the names/signatures found during the audit, hook funnels
   confirmed by call-site analysis (not assumed funnels), and re-verify after
   every device OTA.

## Stage Delivery And installRelease

Deliver in testable stages. After completing each coherent stage:

1. Run the checks (`compileDebugKotlin`, unit tests, lint as warranted) and
   then `assembleRelease`.
2. Install with `adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/<apk>` — the
   user tests release builds; debug-only testing once masked an R8 breakage.
   When reflection touches bundled-library class names, verify those constants
   survived R8 in the built APK before handing over.
3. Force-stop the affected scoped processes so the new hooks load, then hand
   over with concrete on-device test steps and the log tags to capture if it
   fails.

## Compose and UI

Keep the existing Compose and Miuix visual language. Verify narrow screens,
large font scales, scrolling, loading and empty states, and state retention
when changing UI or navigation.

## Comments and Verification

Add short comments only for complex or non-obvious logic. Use the narrowest
useful checks first (compile or focused tests), then add unit tests, lint, and
Debug/Release builds when the change warrants them. Use the commands and
constraints in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) as the project reference.

- Do not run `screencap` or otherwise capture, pull, store, or inspect
  screenshots during development or verification unless the user explicitly
  requests it. Leave visual inspection to the user and rely on logs, state
  queries, and functional checks instead.
