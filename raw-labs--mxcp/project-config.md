# Development Practices

- Do not create "backward compatibility" support in the code unless explicitly asked; this is a new s/w stack being used and it has no users yet, so backward compat is not a concern
- Do not create re-export modules or wrapper functions just to maintain old import paths - update imports directly to use the new locations
- When consolidating or refactoring modules, always update all imports to use the new structure rather than preserving old import paths

## Module Naming Conventions
- Use underscore prefix ONLY for `_types.py` because `types` is a Python built-in module
- DO NOT use underscore prefix for other module names (e.g., use `config.py` not `_config.py`)
- The underscore convention is NOT for marking "internal" modules - it's only to avoid name conflicts with Python built-ins

## Import Organization
- ALL imports must be at the top of the file, not in the middle of functions or methods
- The ONLY exception is when the import is for a truly optional dependency (defined as optional in pyproject.toml)
- Never put imports inside functions unless it's absolutely necessary for optional dependencies

## Logging Security Guidelines

### NEVER Log Sensitive Data
- **Tokens/Keys**: Never log tokens, API keys, or secrets (not even truncated)
- **Credentials**: No passwords, client secrets, or auth tokens
- **PII**: Avoid logging email addresses, usernames, IP addresses
- **Query Content**: Don't log SQL queries or their parameters
- **Response Data**: Never log actual data returned from queries

### What TO Log
- Operation names and types
- Timing and performance metrics
- Status codes and error types
- Counts and aggregates
- Provider/service names (not user identities)

### Log Level Guidelines
- **ERROR/WARNING**: Only operational context, no data
- **INFO**: High-level operations without sensitive details
- **DEBUG**: May include more context but still no secrets

### Examples
```python
# BAD - Logs sensitive data
logger.info(f"Found token: {token[:10]}...")  # Even truncated tokens are sensitive
logger.info(f"User {email} logged in")         # PII
logger.debug(f"Executing SQL: {query}")        # Query content

# GOOD - Logs operational context only  
logger.info("Authentication token validated")
logger.info(f"User authenticated (provider: {provider})")
logger.debug("Executing SQL query (type: SELECT)")
