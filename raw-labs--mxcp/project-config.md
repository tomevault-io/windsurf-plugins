# CLI Command Stability

## Command Names and Structure
- NEVER change the names of existing CLI commands unless explicitly asked
- NEVER rename CLI subcommands without explicit user request
- NEVER restructure the command hierarchy (e.g., moving from `mxcp log` to `mxcp audit log`) without explicit approval
- If suggesting CLI improvements, always present them as proposals, not implementations

## Command Output
- NEVER change the output format of existing CLI commands unless specifically requested
- Preserve existing formatting, column structure, and data presentation
- JSON output structures must remain backward compatible
- Exit codes must remain consistent

## Command Parameters
- NEVER remove existing command-line options or flags
- New options can be added but must not change the behavior of existing options
- Default values for existing parameters must not change
- Parameter types (string, int, bool) must remain consistent

## Examples of What NOT to Do
- Don't change `mxcp log` to `mxcp audit log`
- Don't change `mxcp log-cleanup` to `mxcp audit cleanup`
- Don't modify table formatting in CLI output
- Don't change JSON response structures
- Don't alter the order or presence of output fields

## When Making CLI Changes
- Always ask for confirmation before changing command names
- Document any breaking changes explicitly
- Preserve backward compatibility where possible
- Consider adding aliases rather than renaming commands
