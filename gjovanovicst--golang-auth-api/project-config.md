# Security Patterns and Best Practices

## Authentication Flow

### JWT Token Management
- Access tokens: Short-lived (15 minutes default)
- Refresh tokens: Long-lived (720 hours default)
- Token rotation on refresh
- Redis-based session management

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) implementation
- QR code generation for authenticator apps
- Recovery codes for backup access
- Secure secret generation and storage

### Social Authentication
- OAuth2 flow with state verification
- Secure provider callback handling
- User account linking/creation
- Scope validation

## Security Configuration

### Security Scanning
Configuration in [.gosec.json](mdc:.gosec.json):
- Medium severity and confidence thresholds
- Excludes vendor and node_modules directories
- Includes test files in scanning
- JSON output format for CI/CD integration

### Environment Security
- Never expose sensitive data in responses
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Hash passwords with bcrypt
- Secure session management with Redis

## Authorization Patterns

### Middleware Protection
- JWT validation in `middleware.AuthMiddleware()`
- User context extraction
- Route-level protection in [cmd/api/main.go](mdc:cmd/api/main.go)

### Role-Based Access Control (Future)
- Admin routes prepared for role checking
- Extensible middleware pattern
- User role management ready

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Request Validation
- Use `go-playground/validator` tags in DTOs
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### Rate Limiting (Recommended)
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Protect against brute force attacks
- Monitor suspicious activity patterns

## Security Event Logging

### Activity Logging System
- Log all authentication events
- Track user activities with context
- Include IP address, user agent, timestamps
- Pagination and filtering for security analysis

### Security-Relevant Events
- Login attempts (success/failure)
- Password changes
- 2FA enable/disable
- Account modifications
- Suspicious activity detection

## Data Protection

### Password Security
- Bcrypt hashing with appropriate cost
- Password complexity requirements
- Secure password reset flow
- Protection against timing attacks

### Sensitive Data Handling
- Never log sensitive information
- Secure token storage and transmission
- Proper secret rotation procedures
- Clean error messages (no information leakage)

## Network Security

### HTTPS Requirements
- Enforce HTTPS in production
- Secure cookie settings
- CORS policy implementation
- Security headers configuration

### Database Security
- Connection pooling with limits
- Secure connection strings
- Database access control
- Regular security updates

## Vulnerability Management

### Security Scanning Tools
- gosec for Go-specific security issues
- nancy for vulnerability scanning
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated security checks in CI/CD

### Security Testing
- Include security test cases
- Test authentication flows
- Validate authorization controls
- Test input validation boundaries

## Production Security Checklist

### Deployment Security
- Environment variable protection
- Secure container images
- Network isolation
- Monitoring and alerting
- Regular security audits
- Incident response procedures
