# ✅ COMPLETED: Character Build Flow (Tabs + Navigation)

## Status: IMPLEMENTED ✅

The Character Build Flow has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### ✅ Implemented Features

#### 1. **CharacterBuildLayout Component**

- Created `src/shared/components/playerCreation/CharacterBuildLayout.tsx`
- Uses React Router's `Outlet` for nested route rendering
- Automatically wraps all character build step pages

#### 2. **CharacterFlowNav Component**

- Created `src/shared/components/playerCreation/CharacterFlowNav.tsx`
- **Enhanced tab navigation** with ShadCN styling
- **Prev/Next buttons** positioned left and right of tabs
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices
- **Keyboard navigation** support (arrow keys, home/end)
- **Accessibility features** with proper ARIA labels

#### 3. **7-Step Character Build Flow**

- Build → Race → Birth Signs → Traits → Religion → Destiny → Perks
- Each step has its own route under `/build/*`
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy routes

#### 4. **Router Integration**

- Updated `src/app/router.tsx` with nested routing structure
- All character creation pages now use the new layout
- Sidebar navigation updated to use new nested routes

#### 5. **Key Features**

- **Tab-based navigation**: Quick jump between any step
- **Linear navigation**: Prev/Next buttons for step-by-step progression
- **Visual feedback**: Active states, hover effects, focus rings
- **Mobile responsive**: Horizontal scrolling, abbreviated labels
- **Build state integration**: Works with existing character build system

### 🎯 Technical Implementation

#### File Structure

```
src/shared/components/playerCreation/
├── CharacterBuildLayout.tsx    ✅ Layout wrapper
├── CharacterFlowNav.tsx        ✅ Navigation component
└── index.ts                    ✅ Updated exports
```

#### Router Structure

```tsx
<Route path="/build" element={<CharacterBuildLayout />}>
  <Route index element={<BuildPage />} />
  <Route path="race" element={<AccordionRacesPage />} />
  <Route path="birth-signs" element={<AccordionBirthsignsPage />} />
  <Route path="traits" element={<AccordionTraitsPage />} />
  <Route path="religions" element={<AccordionReligionsPage />} />
  <Route path="destiny" element={<UnifiedDestinyPage />} />
  <Route path="perks" element={<UnifiedPerksPage />} />
</Route>
```

### 🚀 Usage

The character build flow is now active and accessible at:

- **Main flow**: `/#/build` (with navigation)
- **Individual steps**: `/#/build/race`, `/#/build/traits`, etc.
- **Legacy routes**: Still work for backward compatibility

### 📱 Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: Full tab labels, larger buttons, expanded layout
- **Mobile**: Abbreviated labels, compact buttons, horizontal scrolling
- **Touch-friendly**: Proper touch targets and gesture support

### ♿ Accessibility

- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys, home/end, tab order
- **Screen reader support**: ARIA labels, roles, descriptions
- **Focus management**: Visible focus indicators
- **Progress tracking**: Text-based progress indicator
