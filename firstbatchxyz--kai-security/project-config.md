# Development Guidelines

This document contains critical information about working with this codebase. Follow these guidelines precisely.

## Core Development Rules

1. Package Management
   - ONLY use uv, NEVER pip
   - Installation: `uv add package`
   - Running tools: `uv run tool`
   - Upgrading: `uv add --dev package --upgrade-package package`
   - FORBIDDEN: `uv pip install`, `@latest` syntax

2. Code Quality
   - Type hints required for all code
   - Public APIs must have docstrings
   - Functions must be focused and small
   - Follow existing patterns exactly
   - Line length: 88 chars maximum

3. Testing Requirements
   - Framework: `uv run pytest`
   - Async testing: use anyio, not asyncio
   - Coverage: test edge cases and errors
   - New features require tests
   - Bug fixes require regression tests

4. Code Style
    - PEP 8 naming (snake_case for functions/variables)
    - Class names in PascalCase
    - Constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
    - Document with docstrings
    - Use f-strings for formatting

- For commits fixing bugs or adding features based on user reports add:
  ```bash
  git commit --trailer "Reported-by:<name>"
  ```
  Where `<name>` is the name of the user.

- For commits related to a Github issue, add
  ```bash
  git commit --trailer "Github-Issue:#<number>"
  ```
- NEVER ever mention a `co-authored-by` or similar aspects. In particular, never
  mention the tool used to create the commit message or PR.

## Development Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Write simple, straightforward code
- **Readability**: Make code easy to understand
- **Performance**: Consider performance without sacrificing readability
- **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to update
- **Testability**: Ensure code is testable
- **Reusability**: Create reusable components and functions
- **Less Code = Less Debt**: Minimize code footprint

## Coding Best Practices

- **Early Returns**: Use to avoid nested conditions
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear variable/function names (prefix handlers with "handle")
- **Constants Over Functions**: Use constants where possible
- **DRY Code**: Don't repeat yourself
- **Functional Style**: Prefer functional, immutable approaches when not verbose
- **Minimal Changes**: Only modify code related to the task at hand
- **Function Ordering**: Define composing functions before their components
- **TODO Comments**: Mark issues in existing code with "TODO:" prefix
- **Simplicity**: Prioritize simplicity and readability over clever solutions
- **Build Iteratively** Start with minimal functionality and verify it works before adding complexity
- **Run Tests**: Test your code frequently with realistic inputs and validate outputs
- **Build Test Environments**: Create testing environments for components that are difficult to validate directly
- **Functional Code**: Use functional and stateless approaches where they improve clarity
- **Clean logic**: Keep core logic clean and push implementation details to the edges
- **File Organsiation**: Balance file organization with simplicity - use an appropriate number of files for the project scale

## System Architecture

RLM (Recursive Language Models) replaces `llm.completion(prompt)` with an
agentic loop: the LLM gets a Python REPL where context is loaded as a
variable, writes code to inspect/process it, and can make sub-calls to
other LLMs. This is a ReAct-style loop (reason → act → observe → repeat).

```
RLM.completion(prompt)
│
├── LMHandler (TCP socket server on 127.0.0.1:<auto-port>)
│   ├── default_client (depth=0, primary model)
│   ├── other_backend_client (depth=1, cheaper model)
│   └── clients dict (named model overrides)
│
├── Environment (REPL)
│   ├── LocalREPL — exec() in sandboxed namespace
│   ├── DockerREPL — container with HTTP proxy
│   └── ModalREPL — cloud sandbox with HTTP broker
│
└── Iteration Loop (core/rlm.py)
    ├── LLM call via lm_handler.completion()
    ├── Code extraction via find_code_blocks()
    ├── Code execution via environment.execute_code()
    ├── Answer detection via find_final_answer()
    └── History formatting via format_iteration()
```

**Agentic sub-agents**: Root orchestrator (depth=0) can spawn typed
sub-agents via `spawn_*()` functions injected into the REPL. Each
sub-agent is a fully agentic RLM at depth=1 with its own system prompt,
tools, and iteration budget. `llm_query()` calls from sub-agents go to
depth=2 (single-shot). See `docs/rlm.md` for the full design.

## Core Components

- `core/rlm.py`: Main RLM class — iteration loop, completion lifecycle,
  persistent mode
- `core/lm_handler.py`: TCP socket server routing LM requests by
  model/depth
- `core/comms_utils.py`: Socket protocol — LMRequest/LMResponse,
  send/recv utilities
- `core/types.py`: Dataclasses — UsageSummary, RLMIteration,
  RLMChatCompletion, REPLResult, CodeBlock
- `environments/local_repl.py`: LocalREPL — sandboxed exec(),
  llm_query, persistent namespace
- `environments/base_env.py`: BaseEnv abstract class, NonIsolatedEnv,
  IsolatedEnv, SupportsPersistence protocol
- `environments/docker_repl.py`: Docker-based isolated REPL
- `environments/modal_repl.py`: Modal cloud sandbox REPL
- `clients/`: LM client implementations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini,
