# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Pagode** is a full-stack web application starter kit combining Go backend with React + InertiaJS frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui components. It uses SQLite for data storage and provides a complete foundation for building modern web applications.

## Key Technologies

- **Backend**: Go 1.24, Echo v4 web framework, Ent ORM, SQLite database
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, InertiaJS, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui
- **Build Tools**: Vite (frontend), Air (Go hot reload)

## Common Development Commands

### Essential Commands
- `make run` - Start the application (default: http://localhost:8000)
- `make watch` - Start with hot reload (requires `make air-install` first)
- `make test` - Run all tests
- `go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/web` - Test compilation without generating binaries
- `make admin email=user@example.com` - Create admin user account

### Database & ORM
- `make ent-gen` - Generate Ent ORM code (run after schema changes)
- `make ent-new name=Entity` - Create new Ent entity
- `make ent-install` - Install Ent code generation tools

### Frontend Development
Frontend assets are built automatically when the app starts. Vite handles hot module replacement for React components.

## Architecture Overview

### Service Container Pattern
All application dependencies are managed through a service container (`pkg/services/container.go`) that houses:
- Database client, Cache, Authentication, Mail, Tasks, Files, Configuration
- Use `services.NewContainer()` to initialize, `container.Shutdown()` to cleanup
- Available in handler `Init()` methods for dependency injection

### Directory Structure
- `cmd/` - Application entry points (`web/` for main app, `admin/` for CLI tools)
- `pkg/handlers/` - HTTP request handlers with route registration
- `pkg/middleware/` - Custom middleware
- `pkg/services/` - Service container and business logic
- `ent/` - Ent ORM generated code and schemas (`ent/schema/` for entity definitions)
- `resources/js/` - React/TypeScript frontend code
- `resources/js/Pages/` - InertiaJS page components
- `config/` - Configuration management (YAML + environment overrides)

### Frontend Architecture
- **InertiaJS** bridges Go controllers with React components
- No separate API layer - controllers return JSON "page props"
- Server-side routing with client-side interactivity
- Pages in `resources/js/Pages/`, components in `resources/js/components/`

### Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based auth with JWT email verification
- `middleware.RequireAuthentication()` and `middleware.RequireAdmin()` for route protection
- `middleware.RequirePaidUser()` for premium content protection
- User entity has `Admin` boolean field for admin access
- Admin panel auto-generated for all Ent entities

### Payment Integration
- Comprehensive Stripe integration for subscriptions and one-time payments
- Provider abstraction pattern allows easy switching between payment processors
- Database entities: PaymentCustomer, PaymentMethod, Subscription, PaymentIntent
- PCI-compliant payment processing using Stripe Elements
- Premium content access control based on payment status

### Database
- SQLite with automatic migrations on startup
- Separate in-memory test database when `PAGODE_APP_ENVIRONMENT=test`
- WAL mode enabled for better concurrent access

## Development Patterns

### Adding New Routes
1. Create handler in `pkg/handlers/` 
2. Embed required services in handler struct
3. Use `Register(new(YourHandler))` in `init()` 
4. Implement `Init(c *services.Container)` for dependency injection
5. Add routes in `Routes(g *echo.Group)` method with named routes
6. Route names should be defined in `routenames` package

### Testing
- Use `config.SwitchEnvironment(config.EnvTest)` before creating container
- Test helpers in `pkg/handlers/router_test.go` for HTTP testing
- goquery available for HTML response testing
- **IMPORTANT**: Always run `make test` after making changes to ensure all tests pass

### Background Tasks
- Uses Backlite (SQLite-based task queues)
- Register queues in `pkg/tasks/register.go`
- Admin UI available for monitoring tasks
- Task dispatcher starts automatically with app

### Forms & Validation
- Embed `form.Submission` in form structs
- Use struct tags: `form:"field_name" validate:"required"`
- `form.Submit()` handles parsing and validation
- Inline validation errors automatically displayed

## Configuration

Configuration uses Viper with `config/config.yaml` as base. Environment variables override config using `PAGODE_` prefix (e.g., `PAGODE_HTTP_PORT` overrides `http.port`).

Key config paths:
- `Config.App.Environment` - Controls behavior (Local/Test/Production)
- `Config.Database.Connection` - SQLite database path
- `Config.App.EncryptionKey` - Must change for production (sessions/JWT)

## File Generation

When modifying Ent schemas:
1. Edit schema files in `ent/schema/`
2. Run `make ent-gen` to regenerate all Ent code
3. Admin panel code auto-generates for all entities

## Payment System

### Configuration
Payment settings are configured in `config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
payment:
