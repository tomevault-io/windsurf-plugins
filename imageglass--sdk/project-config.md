# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`ImageGlass.SDK` is a single .NET 10 class library (`net10.0`, C# `Preview`) that defines the two public extension contracts for **ImageGlass 10**. It contains *contracts and helper base classes only* – no host implementation, no concrete plugins/tools. ImageGlass is the host; third parties consume this DLL to build extensions. There are no tests in this repo.

The two extension surfaces are independent and must not be conflated:

- **Plugins** (`source/Plugins/`, namespace `ImageGlass.SDK.Plugins`) – *native, in-process* image codecs loaded via `NativeLibrary.Load`. Communication is a hand-rolled **C ABI** (function-pointer tables), not .NET interfaces.
- **Tools** (`source/Tools/`, namespace `ImageGlass.SDK.Tools`) – *out-of-process* external programs the host launches and talks to over a **named pipe** using newline-delimited JSON.

## Build

```pwsh
dotnet build source/ImageGlass.SDK.slnx        # or restore/pack as needed
```
Platforms: `x64;ARM64;AnyCPU`. Requires the .NET 10 SDK. Only dependency is `SkiaSharp`. There is no separate lint step and no test project.

## AOT / trimming constraints (applies to ALL changes)

The library sets `IsAotCompatible=true` and `EnableTrimAnalyzer=true` because plugins/tools may publish Native AOT. Consequences you must respect:

- **No runtime-reflection JSON.** All serialization goes through source-generated contexts: `ToolJsonContext` (Tools) and `PluginJsonContext` (Plugins). Any new type that crosses the wire must be added as a `[JsonSerializable(...)]` entry there, or it will fail at runtime in AOT.
- When you must call reflection-y APIs, follow the existing pattern of `[UnconditionalSuppressMessage("AOT"/"Trimming", ...)]` with a justification pointing at the source-gen context (see `Tools/Internal/ToolClient.cs`).

## Plugin ABI architecture (the hard part)

Native codec plugins talk to the host through versioned, `[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]` `unsafe struct`s full of `delegate* unmanaged[Cdecl]<...>` pointers. The flow:

1. Host calls the plugin's single C export `ig_plugin_get_api` (`IGNativeAbi.ENTRY_POINT_NAME`), passing the host ABI version and an `IGHostApi*`.
2. Plugin returns an `IGPluginApi*` (identity + `GetCodec`/`Initialize`/`Shutdown`/`SelfTest`).
3. Per codec, `IGCodecApi` exposes `GetCapability` (plugin-allocated, returned by pointer), extension/signature matching, `LoadMetadata`, `DecodeStaticRaster`, the animation-decode entry points, `EncodeStaticRaster`, the multi-frame encode session, and the buffer-freeing callbacks.

Rules baked into the contract – preserve them when editing:

- **ABI versioning:** `IG_PLUGIN_ABI_VERSION` is `MAJOR*1_000_000 + MINOR*1_000 + PATCH`. A **major** bump is a breaking change and the host rejects mismatched plugins. Reordering/inserting/removing fields is breaking. Appending to the end of a struct is only compatible where that struct has a `StructSize` **and the allocating side sets it** – that is what bounds the reader; where the allocating side has none (`IGAnimationFrameInfo`, whose array the plugin allocates and the host strides), appending is breaking too. Keep and set every `StructSize`, always to your own `sizeof`.
- **Only readers from 1.2.0 tolerate a longer table.** Before that the host range-checked `IGCodecApi.StructSize` against its own `sizeof` and refused anything larger, so an appended member is compatible only with hosts at or after the version that added it. Treat the minimum host ABI as part of what a new member costs, and do not work around it plugin-side: a reader that clamps is the fix, and it shipped in 1.2.0.
- **The v1 contract was revised in place for encoding** (new `StructSize` on `IGCodecApi`/`IGCodecCapability`, pointer-returning `GetCapability`, renamed capability flags) with **no version bump**, so every plugin must be rebuilt. Stale libraries are refused per codec by the `IGCodecApi.StructSize` check.
- **Memory ownership:** whoever allocates frees. The plugin allocates decode pixel/animation buffers and the host calls back into the plugin's `FreePixelBuffer`/`FreeAnimationInfo`. `FreePixelBuffer` **must be thread-safe** – SkiaSharp may invoke the release delegate from any thread when an `SKImage` is disposed. **Encode input buffers are host-owned**, call-scoped, and must never reach `FreePixelBuffer`.
- **Animation:** decoded animation frames must be **fully composed RGBA at full canvas size**. The host does not do sub-rect composition or disposal/blend replay – GIF/APNG plugins composite internally.
- **Encoding:** capabilities are a 2x2 over {static raster, multi-frame} x {decode, encode}, each quadrant independently optional. One multi-frame session covers animated formats and page containers alike, split by `IGMultiFrameEncodeInfo.IsAnimated`. The host passes a temp destination path it owns and moves the result into place; the plugin must write that path completely and close its handle on every return path.
- **Cancellation:** is an opaque `void*` token; plugins poll `IGHostCoreApi.IsCancellationRequested` and return `IGStatus.Canceled`.
