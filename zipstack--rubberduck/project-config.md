Remember that the basic idea for this project is in prompting/idea.md, the spec is in prompting/spec.md and the prompt plan, which serves as the implementation plan is in prompting/prompt_plan.md. Always read these files to get a good idea about how the implementation is to be carried out. Also, remember that after the implementation, tests need to be written and run successfully before moving on to the next step. Once a step has been implemented, always mark it as done in the prompting/prompt_plan.md file.

## Default User Credentials

A default user is automatically created on first startup if no users exist in the database:

- **Email**: admin@example.com
- **Password**: admin

This allows immediate access to the application without requiring registration. The default user has the same capabilities as any other user and can create and manage proxy instances.

## Notes

- For Rubberduck, use the venv in the project root. For the testing script, use the venv at scripts/proxy_testing/. Do not use the system Python.
- Do not start the backend or frontend servers yourself. I will run them with stdout and stderr redirected to <project_root>/backend.log and <project_root>/frontend/frontend.log. You can read these files to understand what's going on.
- Whenever the user asks you to commit / push to git, always do it from the project's root directory and never commit or push without first confirming with me.
- The Django backend listens on port 9000, while the frontend listens on port 5173.
