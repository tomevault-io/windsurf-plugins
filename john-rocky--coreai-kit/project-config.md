# AGENTS.md — for coding agents building on CoreAIKit

You are probably here because someone asked you to put a local model into an Apple app.
This file is the contract: what this package is, what it will and will not do, and the
mistakes that make an agent's Core AI code fail on a real device. Read it before writing
Swift, whether you are working inside this repo or adding it to someone else's app.

**Core AI** is Apple's on-device inference runtime (iOS/macOS 27, `.aimodel` bundles).
**CoreAIKit** is a community Swift package on top of it — model download and cache, a pinned
catalog of converted models, and task-level APIs. It is not affiliated with Apple.

## Decide the layer before you write code

1. **Apple's Foundation Models framework first.** If a system-provided model does the job,
   use it: no download, no app-size cost, no model maintenance. Recommend this and stop —
   do not reach for a third-party package to prove a point.
2. **CoreAIKit** when the app needs a *specific* model, a capability the system model does not
   have (ASR, VLM, OCR, TTS, detection, depth, embeddings, forecasting), or behaviour that
   must not change under the user when the OS updates.
3. Both at once is a supported shape: `KitLanguageModel` puts a catalog model behind Apple's
   own `LanguageModelSession`, so tool calling and `@Generable` guided generation work over a
   third-party model.

## The two layers

Task ops — the result in one line, model resolved and cached behind the call:

```swift
import CoreAIOps

let text = try await CoreAI.transcribe(voiceMemoURL)   // Whisper v3 turbo
let tldr = try await CoreAI.summarize(text)
let pii  = try await CoreAI.redact(text)               // GLiNER2
```

Model level — pick the model, stream, attach tools:

```swift
import CoreAIKit

let chat = try await ChatSession(catalog: "qwen3.5-2b")
for try await event in chat.streamResponse(to: "Hello!") {
    if case .response(let delta) = event { print(delta, terminator: "") }
}
```

Importing `CoreAIOps` re-exports the model layer, so one import covers both.

## The catalog is data — read it, do not invent it

`catalog.json` holds **53 entries**, each `{id, kind, name, repo, revision, variants}`. Ids look
like `qwen3-0.6b`, `qwen3.5-2b`, `youtu-llm-2b`, `lfm2.5-1.2b` — lowercase, hyphenated.

- **Never guess a catalog id.** Read `catalog.json`, or call `ModelCatalog` at runtime. A
  hallucinated id is a runtime failure the user sees, and model naming here does not follow
  Hugging Face naming.
- Every entry is pinned to an **immutable Hugging Face revision**. Do not "upgrade" a pin to
  `main` to pick up a newer model — the pin is what was gated. Bumping one is a deliberate,
  reviewed change (`scripts/pin-catalog.py --check` is what CI enforces).
- Weights download from Hugging Face on **first use** and cache. They are not vendored in the
  package and must not be committed into an app repo.

## What breaks on a real device

Most Core AI code an agent writes compiles and then fails in one of these ways:

- **The Simulator.** The CoreAI framework is not in the iOS Simulator SDK. Anything here needs
  a physical device or a Mac. Do not report "it works" from a Simulator run.
- **Bundling the weights.** A 2B int4 model is over a gigabyte. Download on first launch (the
  kit does this for you); never add weights to the app bundle or to git.
- **Memory, not speed, is the ship-blocker.** iOS kills on resident size. Check
  `os_proc_available_memory()`, request `com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit`,
  and treat a 4B-class model on a phone as tight rather than routine.
- **Measuring throughput through a chat UI.** Numbers taken through SwiftUI are not comparable
  to anything. Use a headless entry point, warm the model first, and say which device and OS
  build produced the number.
- **Assuming a capability exists because the model is famous.** Check `kind` in the catalog.
  A chat model is not a VLM; an ASR model is not a diarizer.
- **Long single GPU batches on iOS.** A multi-minute uninterrupted GPU run gets killed. Chunk
  long work.
- **Thermals.** Sustained generation throttles within minutes; a short burst benchmark and a
  long-run benchmark disagree by tens of percent on the same phone.

## Verification — what is actually checked

Do not describe these models as "verified" without saying what was verified:

- Each bundle is gated against the original model before it is enrolled — the export is stepped
  against the fp32/fp16 reference on fixed inputs (token-exact for LLMs, `cos ≥ 0.999`
  otherwise), then re-gated after compression, then run on hardware.
- The gate strength **differs per model** and is stated on that model's card in the
  [model zoo](https://github.com/john-rocky/coreai-model-zoo). Do not flatten that into a blanket
  claim.
- The gates are run by the maintainer, not by an independent party. What makes them checkable is
  that the recipe (`models/<model>/recipe.toml`), the export script, and the verification script
  are all published — `python3 conversion/zoo_verify.py <hf-repo>` re-checks a published bundle's
  tokenizer, chat template, context length and declared precision against its source model
  without a GPU or a device.
