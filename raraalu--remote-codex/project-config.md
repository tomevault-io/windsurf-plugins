# Project Working Rules

## Workflow

- Read the relevant implementation and tests before changing behavior.
- Keep fixes scoped to one verified problem at a time.
- After a fix passes its relevant tests, create an intentional Git commit for that fix instead of accumulating unrelated changes.
- Use Chinese commit subjects and bodies. Include the behavioral change and verification performed; do not add signatures or sign-offs.
- Do not push a fix until its real VS Code/Remote SSH behavior has been verified when the change affects that integration.
- Version updates in the current `0.x` development series follow implementation scope rather than
  generic stable-SemVer feature labels. Complete one independently verifiable implementation
  target before incrementing the third segment (`0.x.1 -> 0.x.2`); complete a coherent batch of
  targets before incrementing the second segment (`0.1.x -> 0.2.x`). Do not bump once per edit or
  before the target is implemented. Update the matching lockfile and release evidence in the same
  target commit, and never publish changed behavior under a previously used version. Bump
  `remote-executor/package.json` only when the Remote Executor implementation or its protocol
  changes; Controller/Shim-only targets bump the root package.

## Documentation Lifecycle

- Keep the root `README.md` focused on the current product: purpose, architecture, supported
  behavior, installation, operation, configuration, development, and current support boundary.
  Do not accumulate historical implementation plans, acceptance transcripts, completed TODOs,
  or per-patch release evidence in the root README.
- Keep a `## TODO` section as the literal final section of the root `README.md`. It is the single
  authoritative index of every active implementation, compatibility, verification, and release
  TODO. Add each newly accepted or discovered TODO there before ending the work turn; detailed
  analysis may live elsewhere, but the README entry must remain complete enough to identify the
  scope and exit condition.
- When a TODO is completed or cancelled, remove it from the active README list in the same change
  and record the outcome in `docs/implementation-status.md`, active manual results in
  `docs/manual-acceptance-backlog.md`, or immutable evidence in `docs/acceptance/`. Never place
  content after the README TODO section.
- Before replacing a milestone README, preserve it verbatim under `docs/archive/`. Name a
  development-series archive by its series entry version, for example
  `docs/archive/README-0.3.0.md` for the complete `0.3.x` development history.
- Archive files are immutable historical records. Never overwrite or rewrite an existing archive;
  create a new archive for the next series or milestone.
- Put implementation evolution in `docs/implementation-status.md`, active manual verification in
  `docs/manual-acceptance-backlog.md`, and dated immutable evidence in `docs/acceptance/`.
- When a README archive is created, verify that the archived bytes match the pre-replacement root
  README and keep a link to the archive from the new root README.

## Remote SSH Safety

- The user performs Remote SSH connection, password entry, and window reload steps manually, then reports when the window is connected.
- Reuse the active VS Code Remote SSH transport by default. Do not start a second SSH authentication flow unless the user explicitly selects the OpenSSH fallback.
- Never store, log, repeat, or commit passwords, private keys, tokens, or session transport tokens.
- Do not rewrite, replace, or synthesize the VS Code workspace folder URI to satisfy Codex UI validation. It can break normal workspace loading.
- Keep the canonical remote workspace root as a POSIX absolute path and validate it against the open Remote SSH workspace.

## Compatibility

- Treat the official `openai.chatgpt` extension, Codex CLI/app-server protocol, Bridge Controller, and Remote Executor as a compatibility set.
- Component, package, extension, CLI, app-server, and Executor protocol version values are
  diagnostic evidence and regression-test triggers only. Never use one of those version values,
  version equality, or a missing diagnostic version as a runtime admission gate. Gate only on the
  actual executable, required capability set, message shape, or a failed operation. A serialized
  format's schema discriminator may select its parser, but rejection must be grounded in an
  unsupported message shape. Enter `incompatible` only after a concrete capability or protocol
  behavior fails.
- Record observed official extension and bundled Codex versions in dated acceptance evidence; do
  not designate an exact pair as a permanent required version. The latest Linux Remote SSH
  evidence is recorded in `docs/acceptance/2026-07-23-release-0.3.3-remote-cli-acceptance.md`;
  Windows keeps its own last fully verified baseline until rerun.
- Newer official extension versions must be tested for task-creation behavior before being declared supported; `26.715.31925` rejects the Windows UI representation of a Remote SSH root as `Unknown local project`.
