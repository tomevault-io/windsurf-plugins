# Write Good Code

Define success criteria before writing code
Write simple, minimal solutions
Minimize the state space of the program

## Write Good Commits

Use the canonical atomic-changes format for git commit messages, wrapped at
72 characters
Use Conventional Commit syntax for pull request titles
Document the Why, What and How: What changed, Why the commit exists, and How
the approach works when not obvious

## Work Effectively and Efficiently

Pay attention to dependencies between tasks, code and data
Work on tasks in topologically sorted order
Run independent tasks in parallel using available tools or subagents
Execute multiple tool calls per turn
Chain commands when possible

## Know When to Ask

Confirm before destructive or irreversible actions
Ask when intent is ambiguous; proceed when it is not
Stay within the requested scope
For unexpected results, trace up to 5 whys until the root cause is identified

## Avoid Mistakes

Do not write speculative code
Do not suppress warnings
Do not suppress coverage with annotations
