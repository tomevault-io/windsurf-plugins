# Untether — Copilot Instructions

Untether is a Telegram bridge for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Gemini CLI, Amp). It runs on the user's machine and bridges agents to Telegram, so users can send tasks by voice or text, approve changes, and read results from their phone — while agents work in the background.

## Stack

- Python 3.12+, anyio (async), msgspec (JSONL parsing), structlog (logging)
- Ruff (linting/formatting), pytest + anyio (testing), 80% coverage threshold
- pydantic-settings for config, httpx for HTTP, typer for CLI

## Code style

- Australian English in user-facing strings (realise, colour, behaviour, licence)
- Type hints on all public functions
- Use `match/case`, `type | None` unions, and other Python 3.12+ features
- Use `anyio` for async (not raw asyncio)
- Use `msgspec.Struct` for data classes (not dataclasses or pydantic models for schemas)
- Use `structlog` for logging (not stdlib logging)

## Architecture

Runners (`src/untether/runners/`) manage engine subprocesses, emit events via the 3-event contract (StartedEvent → ActionEvent(s) → CompletedEvent). RunnerBridge connects runners to the TelegramPresenter which handles message rendering and inline keyboards.

All Telegram writes go through `TelegramOutbox` — never call Bot API directly.

## Testing patterns

- Stub subprocess runners with fake CLI scripts for engine tests
- `FakeTransport` protocol doubles instead of real Telegram clients
- Verify the 3-event contract: `StartedEvent` → `ActionEvent(s)` → `CompletedEvent`
- Use `pytest-anyio` for async tests

## Commit conventions

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Feature branches: `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`
- Every bug fix references a GitHub issue
- Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes

## Commands

Key Telegram commands: `/cancel`, `/agent`, `/model`, `/planmode`, `/usage`, `/stats` (session statistics), `/auth` (Codex re-auth), `/export`, `/browse`, `/config`, `/verbose`, `/restart`.
