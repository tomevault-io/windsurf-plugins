# Cursor Rules

## HARD CONSTRAINT: Pattern Tool Usage

**CRITICAL RULE**: If the user mentions "patterns", asks "how to" in Effect, or requests Effect-TS guidance, you are **FORBIDDEN** from using filesystem tools to find patterns.

### FORBIDDEN Tools for Pattern Queries:
- ❌ `grep` - Never search pattern files
- ❌ `read_file` - Never read pattern files directly
- ❌ `codebase_search` - Never search codebase for patterns
- ❌ `glob_file_search` - Never search for pattern files
- ❌ `list_dir` on pattern directories - Never browse pattern directories

### REQUIRED Tool for Pattern Queries:
- ✅ `mcp_Effect-Patterns-effect-patterns_search_patterns` - **MUST** use this tool
- ✅ Display results verbatim - **DO NOT** summarize or rewrite

### Why This Rule Exists:
- The `search_patterns` tool provides production-tested code and rich-UI blocks
- Manual file searching misses critical context, examples, and structured guidance
- Pattern files contain implementation details that should not be exposed directly
- The MCP tool ensures consistent, authoritative pattern presentation

### Violation Consequences:
Manual summarization of pattern files is a **violation of project safety standards**. Always use the authorized MCP tool.
