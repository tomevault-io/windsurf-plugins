# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Environment

All scripts and commands from this repo must be run inside a Docker container started with
`./docker/run_docker.sh` (or `./docker/run_docker.sh -c` for cuRobo). Users must start the container manually; if
no container started by the appropriate command exists, prompt the user to start it.

## Common Commands

### Linting, Formatting, and Coding Style

Pre-commit hooks enforce the style guide: black (line length 120), flake8, isort, pyupgrade (py312+), and codespell. Run checks manually **before** committing — not after:

```bash
# Run all checks (if hooks modify files, stage them and re-run before committing)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Coding Style

- Prefer `assert` over `if-then-raise ValueError` for internal invariant checks. Use `assert condition, "message"` instead of `if not condition: raise ValueError("message")`.
- Follow **PEP 8**. Method names and CLI arguments are `snake_case`.
- Use **modern type hints**: PEP 604 unions (`x | y`, `x | None`); do not use `typing.Union` or `typing.Optional`. Annotate concrete types on public interfaces (e.g. `torch.Tensor`, `wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3)`).
- Keep parameter names consistent across base/override APIs.
- **Name for autocomplete discoverability**:
  - Classes group by domain concept — `ActuatorNetLSTM`, not `LSTMActuatorNet`.
  - Methods put noun before modifier — `set_joint_position_target()`, not `set_target_joint_position()`.
- Prefer **nested classes** for helpers or enums only meaningful inside one parent class.
- Use **Google-style docstrings** on public APIs:
  - `Args:` entries use `name: description` (types live in annotations, not docstrings).
  - State SI units inline as `[unit]` for physical quantities (e.g. `positions [m]`, `[N, N·m]`). Skip non-physical fields (indices, counts, flags).
  - Use Sphinx roles (`:class:`, `:meth:`, `:attr:`) with short local references; avoid `_src` or private module paths.
- **File headers**: new files use the current-year SPDX copyright header; do not change the year on existing files.

## Guardrails (MUST FOLLOW, DO NOT DEVIATE FROM GUARDRAILS)

- Do not change or modify anything in the submodules. All git-related operations in submodules are read-only: do not commit or push code or create branches in a submodule.
- Don't mutate the `autodata` conda env. No `pip install/uninstall`, `conda install/remove`, or version upgrades. If a dependency is missing, surface the exact command and let the user run it.
- Don't re-run, modify, or work around `conda_installer.sh`. No env recreate/rename/delete, no channel or conda config changes. Installer issues get reported, not patched in-flight.
- Don't change any existing design docs or diagrams in /docs, that is only for human created files. If you need to add any new diagrams or designs, add them to the /agentic_design directory.
