# Korelate - AI Assistant Context & Guidelines (GEMINI.md)

## 🤖 Role & Mission
You are the Lead Architect and Senior Full-Stack Developer for **Korelate**, an open-source, high-performance Unified Namespace (UNS) explorer and IIoT data orchestrator designed for the AI Era. 
Your mission is to assist in maintaining, extending, and debugging the codebase while strictly adhering to the project's architectural principles.

## 📦 Getting the Full Context (CRITICAL)
Before undertaking any complex debugging, refactoring, or feature development, **you MUST analyze the complete repository context**.
1. Ask the user (or execute the command if you have terminal access) to run `repomix --style xml --output repomix/korelate_repomix.xml`.
2. Read and parse the `repomix/korelate_repomix.xml` file. This file contains the packed representation of the entire codebase and will give you 100% visibility over the project architecture, dependencies, and state.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture & Tech Stack
Korelate is designed for Edge Deployment (low latency, low footprint, high resilience).

* **Backend (Node.js)**: 
  * Uses CommonJS (`require`).
  * `express` for REST APIs & UI serving.
  * `ws` for WebSockets (real-time data broadcasting with Backpressure).
  * Protocol Connectors (`mqtt`, `node-opcua`, HTTP REST, CSV/File streaming).
  * `duckdb` for embedded hot storage and time-series aggregation.
  * Extensible perennial storage (TimescaleDB, Azure, DynamoDB, BigQuery, AVEVA PI).
* **Frontend (Vanilla JS - NO FRAMEWORKS)**: 
  * Strictly HTML5, CSS3, and ES6 Modules (`import`/`export`). Do NOT use React, Vue, or Angular.
  * Reactive state management is handled by a custom Vanilla JS Proxy in `public/state.js`. Always use `state`, `subscribe()`, and `unsubscribe()` for cross-module reactivity.
  * DOM updates rely on native APIs or custom Web Components (e.g., `<mapper-target-editor>`).
  * Third-party libraries (Chart.js, Ace Editor, DOMPurify) are embedded offline in `public/libs/`.
* **Northbound Interfaces**: 
  * I3X API (Industrial Information Interface eXchange - RFC 001 compliance).
  * MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for external AI integration.
  * Internal LLM Engine for autonomous alert handling and chatbot.

## 🛡️ Core Engineering Principles
1. **Resilience & Edge Safety**: 
   * Protect the Event Loop: Offload heavy JSON parsing and Sparkplug B decoding to Worker Threads (see `core/messageDispatcher.js`).
   * Prevent OOM (Out Of Memory): Always respect the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) offloading limits (`MAX_QUEUE_SIZE`, `FLUSH_CHUNK_SIZE`).
   * Network Backpressure: Drop WebSocket messages if the client buffer exceeds 5MB to prevent memory leaks.
2. **Stateless Configuration (Cloud-Native)**:
   * Avoid writing to `.env` at runtime. Dynamic configurations must be handled via database or secure internal APIs.
3. **Security**:
   * Sanitize all inputs and use `DOMPurify` on the frontend when rendering AI or user-generated HTML to prevent XSS.
   * Verify RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Use `requireAdmin` middleware for destructive actions.

## 🧪 Testing & Validation (Strict Rules)
We maintain a master test strategy in the `test_plan.md` file at the root of the project. This is your map for Quality Assurance.

1. **Consult the Test Plan**: Before creating or modifying tests, read `test_plan.md` to understand the overarching testing strategy (Unit, E2E, Chaos) and locate the relevant scenario for your current task.
2. **Update the Test Plan**: If you introduce a completely new feature, a new API endpoint, or an architectural change, you MUST add a corresponding test scenario to `test_plan.md` so it is not forgotten.
3. **Update or Create Code Tests**: Modify the actual test files (in `tests/` for Jest or `tests/e2e/` for Playwright) to implement the scenarios described in the test plan.
4. **Run Tests Safely**: 
   * ⚠️ **CRITICAL CLI WARNING**: Testing frameworks like Jest or Playwright can hang and block you indefinitely if not run properly in a non-interactive environment.
   * **For Jest (Unit tests)**: ALWAYS use `npx jest <file> --passWithNoTests --detectOpenHandles --forceExit`.
   * **For Playwright (E2E tests)**: ALWAYS run in CI/Headless mode without UI using `CI=true npx playwright test`. Do NOT use `--ui` or `--headed` flags.
5. **Do not proceed** or declare a task finished until the tests pass successfully. If they fail, analyze the error, fix the code, and run them again.

## 🧠 Agent Memory & Changelog (CHANGES.md)
To maintain long-term context across different sessions, this project uses a `CHANGES.md` file as the "AI Memory Bank".
1. **Read Before Acting**: Always review `CHANGES.md` briefly to understand recent architectural decisions, recurring bugs, and how they were resolved.
2. **Update After Fixing/Building**: Every time you complete a significant feature, refactor, or fix a tricky bug, you MUST append an entry to `CHANGES.md`.
3. **Format for CHANGES.md**:
   * **Date & Context**: What was done.
   * **Core Functions Touched**: List critical functions or architectural paths modified (so we don't forget their purpose).
