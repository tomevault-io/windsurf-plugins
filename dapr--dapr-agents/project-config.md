## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["drasi_trigger"] --> R["register_message_routes"]
    R --> S["Pub/sub router"]
    S <--> T["Dapr streaming subscription"]
    S --> D["DurableAgent"]
    T <--> C["Dapr sidecar (gRPC)"]
```

The extension is intentionally thin:

- `drasi_trigger` resolves and validates configuration at activation time.
- Configuration is used to customize filtering/mapping/routing logic to be executed by the core pub/sub routing infrastructure via the `register_message_routes` interface.
- Drasi change events arrive through Dapr pub/sub, pass through the core pub/sub routing infrastructure, and trigger agent workflows.

## Public API

All public symbols are exported from `dapr_agents.ext.drasi`:

```python
from dapr_agents.ext.drasi import (
    drasi_trigger,      # Register Drasi query subscriptions for an agent
    DrasiChangeEvent,   # Drasi change event model emitted by a query
    DrasiOperation,     # Drasi operation enum: i, u, or d
)
```

Notes:

- `dapr_agents.ext.drasi.__init__` re-exports the full public surface shown
    above.
- `types.py` re-exports generated Drasi schema models under extension-specific
    public names, including `DrasiChangeEvent` and `DrasiOperation`.
- Anything under `activations.py` or `utils/` should be treated as internal
    unless it is explicitly re-exported or documented here.

## Gotchas

- `dapr_agents.ext` is a PEP 420 namespace package. Do not add an
    `__init__.py` to `dapr_agents/ext/`; that would change import behavior.
- `drasi_trigger` is activation-time wiring only. It does not start the agent
    runtime by itself; it registers pub/sub routes on the target `DurableAgent`.
- The default topic is derived from the query ID as
    `drasi-events-<query_id>`.
- If `pubsub` is omitted, the extension falls back to the agent's configured
    pub/sub. Activation fails if no pub/sub is available, or if the resolved
    `(pubsub, topic)` matches the agent’s own `(pubsub, topic)`.
- `operations` is normalized to a list and only Drasi operations `i`, `u`, and
    `d` are supported.
- `change_model` must be a supported dict, dataclass, or Pydantic model.
- Dedupe is best-effort. If `cachetools` is unavailable, duplicate detection is
    disabled and the extension logs a warning.
- Generated schema files under `schemas/unpacked/` should be regenerated via
    `scripts/generate-drasi-models.sh`; do not hand-edit them.

## Testing and development

- For shared setup, testing, code quality, and PR guidance, use the root
    [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).
- To install the extension in a consuming project:

    ```bash
    uv add dapr-agents[drasi]
    ```

- To install the extension in editable mode from the repo root:

    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv sync --active --group dev --group test --extra drasi
    ```

- To run extension tests from the repo root:

    ```bash
    uv run --group test pytest ext/dapr-agents-ext-drasi -m "not integration" -v
    ```

- Extension tests currently live in:
