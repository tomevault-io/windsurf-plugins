# clsh.dev — Agent Instructions

You are an AI agent working on the clsh.dev project vault. This file is your primary reference.

## What Is clsh?

**clsh** (clsh.dev) is a phone-first, open-source tool that gives developers real terminal access to their machine from any device. The primary experience is on your phone — a pixel-perfect MacBook-style keyboard (not the iOS keyboard), tmux-style session grids you can zoom into, and customizable keyboard skins. Desktop is supported too, with a MacBook Pro frame housing three live terminal panes.

**Core value prop**: Your Mac, in your pocket. But way more than that. One command to start: `npx clsh-dev`.

**Vision**: See `02_Product/Vision.md` for the full product vision — phone UI, MacBook keyboard, keyboard skins, remote machines, Claude bootstrap, solo→teams progression.

## Target Users

- Developers who want terminal access from their phone/tablet
- Claude Code users who want to monitor sessions remotely
- Developers working across multiple devices
- Mobile-first developers who want real terminal access on the go

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Frontend | React 18, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS v4 | Fast dev, modern tooling |
| Terminal | xterm.js v5.5+ (WebGL renderer) | Industry-standard terminal emulator |
| Backend | Node.js 20+, Express, ws | Lightweight, WebSocket-native |
| PTY | node-pty | Real terminal sessions, not simulation |
| Tunnel | @ngrok/ngrok SDK | Programmatic HTTPS tunnels + QR code |
| Auth | jose (JWT), Resend (magic link) | Secure, one-time bootstrap tokens |
| Database | better-sqlite3 | Local, zero-config, WAL mode |
| Monorepo | Turborepo, npm workspaces | Parallel builds, shared deps |
| Landing | Cloudflare Pages | Static hosting, edge CDN |

## Vault Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `00_Company/` | Identity, vision, mission |
| `01_RnD/` | Architecture, frontend, backend, infra, devops, docs |
| `02_Product/` | MVP definition, roadmap, features |
| `03_Marketing/` | Social media, content, GTM, branding, SEO |
| `04_Community/` | Discord, GitHub community, contributors, growth |
| `05_Business/` | Competitors, market intel |
| `06_Legal/` | Open source licensing, security policy, privacy |
| `Handoffs/` | Session handoff notes (one per session, dated) |
| `Templates/` | Reusable note templates |
| `Docs/` | Source documents (Complete Technical Plan) |
| `.claude/agents/` | Agent persona files |
| `.claude/commands/` | Custom Claude Code commands |

## Project Context

- **Product**: clsh — phone-first terminal access to your machine
- **Primary UX**: Phone with MacBook keyboard (not iOS keyboard), tmux grid, keyboard skins
- **Secondary UX**: Desktop with MacBook Pro frame, three-pane layout
- **Business model**: Open source (MIT) → future cloud-hosted remote machines (paid SaaS)
- **Architecture**: Local-first MVP with ngrok tunneling → remote machines with Claude bootstrap → teams
- **MVP scope**: Agent (PTY + WebSocket + auth) + Web (xterm.js + MacBook UI) + Landing page + Demo mode
- **Monorepo**: `packages/agent`, `packages/web`, `packages/cli`, `apps/landing`
- **Domain**: clsh.dev
- **GitHub**: my-claude-utils/clsh
- **Stage**: Phase 4 (Launch) — 88% complete (21/24 steps)

## Research Sources

1. `Docs/compass_artifact_*.md` — **PRIMARY** — Complete production technical plan

## Rules for Agents

1. **Always use `[[wikilinks]]`** for cross-references between notes
2. **Keep files concise** — index files are navigational (20-40 lines), content files are substantive
3. **Use templates** from `Templates/` for new notes
4. **Tag with department hashtags**: #rnd, #product, #marketing, #community, #business, #legal
5. **Reference the Execution Plan** as the primary source of truth for build order
6. **Respect the architecture**: local-first now, cloud later
7. **Read VAULT-INDEX.md first** when starting work on any task
8. **Open source mindset**: Everything we build should be contributor-friendly
9. **Always update Execution-Plan.md** when completing or progressing any step
10. **Always create a handoff** in `Handoffs/` when wrapping up a session

## Team Workflow (Parallel Execution)

The Execution Plan defines **Parallel Groups** — steps that can run simultaneously via agent teams.

### How It Works

1. **`/resume-clsh`** identifies all currently unblocked steps and their parallel groups
2. A team is created with `TeamCreate` (e.g., `team_name: "clsh-phase1b"`)
3. Tasks are created with `TaskCreate` for each parallel step
4. Agents are spawned with the `Task` tool using:
   - `team_name` matching the team
   - `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` for implementation work
   - `isolation: "worktree"` when multiple agents edit the same repo (prevents conflicts)
5. Agents work independently, mark tasks complete via `TaskUpdate`
6. Leader merges worktrees and updates the Execution Plan

### Worktree Rules

- Use `isolation: "worktree"` when 2+ agents edit code in the same repo simultaneously
- Each worktree gets a descriptive name (e.g., `backend-core`, `frontend-core`)
- After agents complete, merge worktrees back to main branch
- Do NOT use worktrees for non-code work (marketing, social channels, domain setup)
