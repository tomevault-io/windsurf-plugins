# Repository instructions for agents

- Treat every launch claim as unproven until supported by current-state evidence.
- Never copy credentials, tax data, banking data, home addresses, phone numbers, private email addresses, API keys, App Store Connect private keys, signing certificates, or provisioning profiles into the repository.
- Browse current Apple primary sources before completing a submission or advising on a rule that may have changed.
- Preserve unrelated user changes. Use a feature branch and explicit staging.
- Record assumptions, unknowns, owner, evidence, and next action in the launch dossier.
- Do not submit legal, tax, banking, DSA trader, export-control, or regulated-professional attestations for the human.
- Do not claim product-market fit from idea scores, downloads, one purchase, approval, or positive feedback.
- Do not market a feature until the exact release build proves it.
- Use real app UI in screenshots and demos. Label synthetic media and never fabricate testimonials, customers, reviews, or results.
- When a skill references another skill, invoke it if available; otherwise implement the referenced evidence gate directly.
- For release work, follow `docs/executable-release-flow.md` and verify the exact IPA that will be uploaded; never verify one archive and recreate another for delivery.
- Treat `.mcp.json` as a pinned convenience, not a trust decision. Review tool source, permissions, telemetry, and release notes before changing its version.
