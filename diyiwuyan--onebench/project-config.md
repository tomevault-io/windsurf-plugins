# Prototype Instructions

Run the local server yourself and open the preview in the browser available to this environment. Do not give the user server-start instructions when you can run it.

Before making substantial visual changes, use the Product Design plugin's `get-context` skill when the visual source is unclear or no longer matches the current goal. When the user gives durable prototype-specific design feedback, preferences, or decisions, record them in `AGENTS.md`.

When implementing from a selected generated mock, treat that image as the source of truth for layout, component anatomy, density, spacing, color, typography, visible content, and hierarchy.

Build app UI in `src/`. Keep `.openai/hosting.json`, `worker/index.js`, `scripts/prepare-sites-build.mjs`, and `tests/sites-worker.test.mjs` intact so the same local prototype can be handed to Sites. Before a Sites handoff, run `npm run build` and `npm run test:sites`; the build must leave `dist/client/index.html`, `dist/server/index.js`, and `dist/.openai/hosting.json`.

## Durable OneBench product direction

- The lifestyle flagship is held to a six-screen reference-matrix standard. Do not call it complete because it has similarly named modules; each captured reference screen must have a matching OneBench route, hierarchy, primary controls, persisted state, and browser QA evidence before release.

- The actual daily workbench is the product. Studio, onboarding, module management, sync, and help belong in secondary panels instead of dominating the home screen.
- Default visual direction: warm paper texture, calm lifestyle feeling, strong role identity, mobile-first hierarchy, and a denser responsive desktop layout. Avoid generic dark admin dashboards.
- Every visible module must be usable. Never represent a promised feature only as an English module ID or an “installed” badge.
- The Demo, downloaded offline HTML, PWA, and browser new-tab extension must run the same app code and show the same workbench. Do not maintain a reduced export-only dashboard.
- First use should already contain realistic role-specific sample content so a beginner understands what to do without configuring anything.
- Keep technical concepts such as GitHub tokens, repository paths, registries, and update sources out of the default beginner flow.
- Keep the homepage intentionally selective: use the left rail for app/module entrances and the home area for a user-curated widget canvas.
- Homepage widgets must support persistent reordering and size changes. Role-pack sample content is only a first-use seed; every visible item must later be editable or removable by the user.
- Treat calendar and weather as first-class shared widgets. Weather may refresh from the network but must keep a useful local cache and never block the offline workbench.
- Community contributions are not one generic “template”: distinguish career packs, workspace layouts, theme packs, module bundles, and individual modules.
- Professional editions must not expose a version switcher in the main top bar. Put switching, returning to the basic edition, profile/display controls, and data backup in the bottom-left Settings entry.
- A professional edition is a distinct workflow and data model, not a recolored shared page. Exam, teacher, lifestyle/creator-reference, and content-creator editions need role-specific create/update/delete flows and independently persisted data.
- Every edition is a first-class deliverable: its Settings must expose a beginner-safe local download, the exported HTML must carry the chosen edition and its professional data, and a user-owned online repository must first-open the selected edition through `public/onebench-seed.json`.
