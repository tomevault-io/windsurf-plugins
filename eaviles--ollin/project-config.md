# Ollin for coding agents

Ollin is a creative-coding framework for Swift and Metal on Apple platforms, aiming for p5.js ergonomics on an OPENRNDR-grade core. If you're an AI coding agent working in this repo, start here.

## Writing a sketch rather than working on Ollin

The rest of this file is for changing the framework. If you are helping somebody write a sketch *with* it, you need much less. Read [`Docs/QuickReference.md`](Docs/QuickReference.md) once: the lifecycle, the calls by area, their units, the command line, and the mistakes that fail with no error. Then look details up from this checkout rather than reading pages whole:

```sh
Scripts/ollin api drawCircle       # a public name: its declarations, its comment, its pages, examples that use it
Scripts/ollin docs Drawing/Color   # one page, or Drawing/Color#ramp for one section
Scripts/ollin examples flocking    # the examples that match; --source prints one
```

[`llms.txt`](llms.txt) maps every page in one line each. The listings under [`API/`](API/README.md) are the public surface, so a name that is not there cannot be reached from a sketch. `CLAUDE.md` and the gates below are for changing Ollin, not for using it.

## Read this first

The full development guidance lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). It's the single source of truth for how the project is built and the conventions that hold it together, so read it before making changes. This file is a short orientation that points there rather than restating it. When you're about to change one of the larger systems (the renderer, the effects, the 3D path), [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) is the companion that explains how it works inside, the how-and-why behind the terse invariants in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Build and verify

Building and running needs **macOS 26+ and a Metal-capable GPU**. The Swift toolchain and Metal are the hard requirements, so changes are verified on a Mac.

```sh
swift build                       # compile the framework (the examples are a separate package)
swift build --package-path Examples   # compile every example
swift run --package-path Examples Example-Basic-HelloCircle     # open a window running an example
Scripts/test.sh <SuiteName>       # the tests for the area you touched (seconds)
Scripts/test.sh quick             # the sub-minute pass, no GPU snapshots or nested builds
Scripts/test.sh                   # the whole suite, phased (many minutes; background it)
```

A change isn't verified until it builds and runs. If `swift --version` and `xcrun --find metal` both succeed, you're on a Mac with the toolchain, so build and run directly instead of adding caveats about being unable to compile.

On a fresh clone, run `Scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` once: it links the pre-commit hook that lints staged Swift with SwiftFormat and SwiftLint (both from brew; a missing tool blocks the commit rather than skipping). Before committing, `Scripts/preflight.sh` runs the doc and figure gates the diff calls for.

Three test-running rules:

- **The full suite takes many minutes.** Never run it as a plain foreground call with a default command timeout; run it in the background or with an explicit long timeout, and use the filtered forms for the edit loop.
- **A full-run failure in a wall-clock suite earns an isolation rerun, not a diagnosis.** `DataFeedTests` and `ListeningTests` measure elapsed time or wait on a system model, and `SpatialVideoTests` wants the video decoder to itself, so `Scripts/test.sh` runs them first on a quiet machine. If one fails inside a plain `swift test`, rerun it alone (`Scripts/test.sh <SuiteName>`) before treating it as a signal, and say which tests failed rather than reporting the suite red. **What that rerun must not become is "so it was load."** A suite can starve *with its target running alone*, or freeze by parking every cooperative-pool thread itself. Phase 1 only helps a suite competing with *other targets* for a device; a suite that fails while running alone has a defect, and a timeout while the process burns 2% CPU is a parked thread pool rather than a busy machine.
- **Skip patterns are unanchored regexes over the full test ID.** Write `OllinTests.SnapshotTests`, never a bare `SnapshotTests`, which also matches `PhysicsSnapshotTests` and silently drops 46 real tests.

If another session or agent is working in this repo at the same time: work in a git worktree, expect a second SwiftPM invocation in the same checkout to block on the `.build` lock rather than fail, and never run `OLLIN_RECORD_SNAPSHOTS` or a full test pass while the other session is mid-build (the load makes the wall-clock suites fail, and recording rewrites the tracked reference images under them).

## A few load-bearing rules

These come up most often. `CLAUDE.md` has the full reasoning; the short version:

- **Typed core first, bare call second.** The p5-style calls (`background`, `drawCircle`) are sugar over a public, typed core; they forward to an internal `Drawer`. Build a feature on the core, then add the bare call, so nothing is reachable only through the facade.
