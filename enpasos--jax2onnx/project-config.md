# AGENTS.md

This page is the quick briefing for automated agents (or humans) dropping into the repo. It highlights what matters immediately and points to the longer-form docs when you need depth.

---

## Project Snapshot

- **Pipeline:** Everything runs through the IR-only converter. `converter/` builds `onnx_ir` graphs; `plugins/` land primitive-specific lowering; `tests/` cover both policy and regression cases.
- **Docs map:** Start with `docs/developer_guide/architecture.md` for the architecture overview. Technical playbooks live under `docs/developer_guide/advanced_topics/` (builder etiquette, expect_graph usage, control-flow wiring, IR optimizer, reflection guardrails, etc.). Release history lives under `docs/about/`; coverage pages and examples live under `docs/user_guide/`.
- **Tooling:** Python 3.11+, Poetry, Ruff, Black, mypy, pytest. Supported runtime stack is **JAX ≥0.7.2** and **Flax/NNX ≥0.12.0**.
- **Recent heads-up (2025-10-02):**
  - NNX examples construct RNGs via `with_rng_seed(...)`; avoid inline lambdas so callables stay hashable under JAX 0.7.
  - Attention plugins normalise masked weights to avoid float32 NaNs; tests rely on that behaviour.

## Where to Read Next

- Architecture: `docs/developer_guide/architecture.md`
- IR builder rules: `docs/developer_guide/advanced_topics/onnx_ir_builder.md`
- Structural tests (`expect_graph`): `docs/developer_guide/advanced_topics/expect_graph_reference.md`
- Control-flow body wiring: `docs/developer_guide/advanced_topics/subgraph_input_handling.md`
- IR optimizer passes: `docs/developer_guide/advanced_topics/ir_optimizer.md`
- Coverage matrices & history: `docs/user_guide/supported_components.md`, `docs/about/past_versions.md`

Keep these handy—most deep-dives live there instead of here.

## Toolchain & Compatibility

- Install: `poetry install -E all`
- Preferred checks:
  - `poetry run ruff check .`
  - `poetry run black .`
  - `./scripts/check_typing.sh`
  - `poetry run pytest -q`
  - `poetry run mkdocs build --strict` for doc changes
- Debug flags exist for the IR optimizer (`JAX2ONNX_*_DEBUG`); see the optimizer dev guide for the full matrix.
- JAX 0.7.x specifics:
  - No `jax_dynamic_shapes` auto-toggle.
  - Primitive parameters must be hashable; `construct_and_call(...).with_dtype(...)` constructs modules once per dtype.
  - Flax NNX requires attributes that hold arrays to be wrapped in `nnx.List` / `nnx.data`.

## Core Rules (Do Not Break)

- **IR-only** inside `converter/` and `plugins/`. Importing ONNX protobuf types here fails CI (`tests/extra_tests/framework/test_no_onnx_in_converter_plugins.py`).
- **Deterministic module construction:** never seed at import. Use `construct_and_call(...).with_requested_dtype()` and `with_rng_seed(...)` helpers so tests can rebuild deterministically for both f32/f64 variants.
- **Single-use PRNG keys:** split before handing keys to separate consumers. Turn on `jax.config.update("jax_debug_key_reuse", True)` while developing if you suspect violations.
- **Metadata parity:** tests expect `expect_graph` specs to mirror real lowering. Keep structural expectations beside metadata entries and regenerate via `scripts/emit_expect_graph.py` when behaviour changes.
- **Follow the dev guides:** IR builder, subgraph wiring, optimizer, and plugin guardrails are enforced by policy tests—read the relevant guide before editing those areas.
- **Do not commit ONNX artifacts:** `.onnx` / `.onnx.data` files (including under `docs/onnx/`) must not land in git. Keep generated models local; they bloat the repo.

## Working Rhythm

1. Sync dependencies (`poetry install -E all`).
2. Make the change.
3. Run the focused test (e.g. `poetry run pytest -q tests/path/test_file.py::TestClass::test_case`).
4. Run the full suite before shipping.
5. Apply formatting/lints/mypy; they’re fast.

> ✅ Rule of thumb: if tests aren’t green locally, you’re not done.

## Policy & Checklist

- Respect repo conventions (see quick bullet list above); when in doubt, consult the dev guide for that subsystem.
- Don’t ship public API changes without updating docs, tests, and changelog.
- Prefer deleting obsolete assets in small, focused diffs.
- Before requesting review:
  - [ ] `poetry run pytest -q`
  - [ ] Added/updated tests
  - [ ] `poetry run ruff check .` & `poetry run black .`
  - [ ] `./scripts/check_typing.sh`
  - [ ] Docs/notes updated if behaviour changed

---

## Handy Commands

- Focused pytest: `poetry run pytest -q tests/path/test_file.py::TestClass::test_case`
- Format touched Python files: `git diff --name-only -- '*.py' | xargs -r poetry run black`
- Emit expect_graph snippets: `poetry run python scripts/emit_expect_graph.py <testcase>`

---

## When You’re Stuck

- Capture minimal reproductions under `tests/extra_tests/framework/`.
- Enable the relevant `JAX2ONNX_*_DEBUG` env while running the failing test.
- Verify mutations persist across graph mirrors (`graph.nodes`, `_nodes`, etc.) if you’re editing IR.
- Revisit the dev guide for the subsystem you’re touching—chances are the guardrail is documented there.
