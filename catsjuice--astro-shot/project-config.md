# Repository Guidelines

## Language

- Use English for all repository content and collaboration.
- Write source code identifiers, comments, documentation, tests, configuration,
  commit messages, branch names, issue content, pull request content, review
  comments, and release notes in English.
- Keep `README.md` entirely in English.
- Product localization strings may use the languages required by the interface,
  but the surrounding code and developer-facing explanation must remain in
  English.

## Documentation

- Keep the README concise and focused on what the project does, how to run it,
  and how to deploy it.
- Keep acknowledgments short and clear. Do not turn acknowledgments into
  implementation diaries or lists of tuning values.
- Put implementation details in code or focused technical documentation only
  when they are genuinely useful to maintainers.

## Temporary Files

- Store all project-specific temporary files under the repository's `tmp/`
  directory.
- Do not place generated previews, scratch scripts, or other disposable artifacts
  in production source or public asset directories.
