## 🎯 CRITICAL PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. ✅ **STRICT TDD**: Write failing test FIRST (RED), then implement (GREEN), then refactor
2. ✅ **NO MOCKS**: Test real behavior, real code, real libs - NO MOCKS EVER
3. ✅ **NO LEGACY**: Delete old code completely - NO backward compatibility, NO fallbacks
4. ✅ **NO HARDCODED VALUES**: All config from YAML - NO magic numbers/strings in code
5. ✅ **100% CONFIGURABLE**: Every behavior must be configurable via YAML
6. ✅ **DRY**: Zero code duplication - extract to shared utilities
7. ✅ **SOLID**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
8. ✅ **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - no over-engineering
9. ✅ **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - remove speculative features
10. ✅ **LONG-TERM MAINTAINABLE**
11. ✅ **UN-DUPLICATED & REUSABLE**: DON'T REINVENT THE WHEEL. Before implementing any logic/lib/etc, analyse the current source code and look for potential already existing feature/implementation/function/class/lib that you could reuse/extend instead.
12. ✅ **STRICT COHERENCE AND UNITY**: Our WHOLE code/lib/implementation/structure should be and stay coherent and unified. BEFORE implementing anything, look for similar patterns in our implementation/files/structure and understand EXACTLY how our current project/code/files/libs/scripts are structured and implemented, and implement it in a same/similar way, ensuring that anyone looking at our code/structure can easily understand everything and that our full implementation is looking like ONE coherent system
13. ✅ **ALWAYS FINDING AND FIXING ROOT ISSUES/ROOT CAUSES**: We should NEVER apply dirty fixes or remove/simplify some logic/tests JUST to make some tests pass or bypass an issue. We must ALWAYS find the ROOT CAUSES of all issues and FIX THEM instead.
14. ✅ **REFACTORING ESSENTIALS**: When refactoring, ALWAYS update ALL related code/callers, including CLIs/tests/e2e tests/unit tests/integration tests and ALL calls/usage sites. DO NOT KEEP or implement legacy fallbacks/backward-compatibility/deprecated code/logic, ALWAYS refactor and update EVERYTHING.
15. ✅ **SELF VALIDATION**: When you think your task is done, do not mark it as done yet. You MUST self-validate and re-analyse EVERYTHING from a new fresh set of eyes, like if a colleague looked at the work you just had done to make sure you had not forgotten anything and that EVERYTHING has correctly been implemented and follows our CRITICAL PRINCIPLES.
16. ✅ **GIT**: NEVER use `git reset`/`git checkout` or any similar commands, except if the user specifically asks you to. THIS IS CRITICAL! 

## Testing
- When updating code, ALL related tests should be updated, including unit, integration, e2e, etc
- When a test fails, we should ALWAYS analyse and fix the ROOT CAUSE of the failure. It could be that our code is wrong and we need to update/fix the logic, OR that the test is wrong or has issues, but we should NEVER simplify/skip/remove tests just to make them pass, or change tests just to work around an issue, and ALWAYS analyse deeply and fix the ROOT CAUSE of all issues.
- The test suite can take long to execute and produce a lot of output. When running it (except if tightly scoped), always use a long timeout (eg. 30min) AND redirect all output/errors to a temporary file, to which you should then delegate a subagent to read completely and analyse deeply to extract all issues. Then, delegate multiple parallel subagents to analyse deeply the ROOT CAUSE of all issues and fix them in parallel.
