# MCPHub — Agent Guide

Authoritative instructions for AI agents and contributors working in this repo. Trust this file first; only fall back to wider search when something here is missing or contradicts the code. When you discover a contradiction, **fix the code or fix this file** — never let them drift.

This guide is intentionally short. It points to where the details live rather than restating them. Read the linked file when you need depth.

## 1. What this repo is

`@samanhappy/mcphub` is a TypeScript/Node (ESM) hub that aggregates multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers behind a single HTTP surface, with a React/Vite dashboard.

| Layer    | Entry                                   | Notes                                        |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Backend  | [src/index.ts](src/index.ts) → [src/server.ts](src/server.ts) | Express + TypeORM (optional) + MCP SDK       |
| Frontend | [frontend/src/](frontend/src/)          | Vite + React + Tailwind, i18n via react-i18next |
| Config   | [mcp_settings.json](mcp_settings.json)  | MCP server defs, users, groups, OAuth state  |
| Docs     | [docs/](docs/)                          | Public docs (Mintlify). See [docs/development/](docs/development/) for architecture |

Layout map (read the directory when you need specifics, don't expand it here):

- `src/{routes,controllers,services,dao,db,middlewares,models,utils,types,config,clients}/`
- `src/services/mcpService.ts` — **core** MCP connection/lifecycle logic
- `src/dao/` + `src/db/` — dual datasource (JSON file by default, PostgreSQL when `USE_DB=true`)
- `tests/` mirrors `src/`; colocated `*.test.ts` also picked up
- `locales/{en,fr,tr,zh}.json` — i18n strings
- `dist/`, `frontend/dist/`, `coverage/` — generated; never hand-edit

## 2. Workflow contract

### Commands (canonical list — don't duplicate elsewhere)

| Purpose          | Command               |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Install          | `pnpm install`        |
| Dev (both)       | `pnpm dev`            |
| Dev backend only | `pnpm backend:dev`    |
| Dev frontend     | `pnpm frontend:dev`   |
| Lint             | `pnpm lint`           |
| Format           | `pnpm format`         |
| Test (CI mode)   | `pnpm test:ci`        |
| Test (watch)     | `pnpm test:watch`     |
| Build all        | `pnpm build`          |
| Verify dist      | `node scripts/verify-dist.js` |
| Start prod       | `pnpm start`          |

Backend listens on `:3000` (or `$PORT`). Frontend dev server `:5173` proxies API calls to the backend.

### Pre-commit gate (must all pass)

```bash
pnpm lint && pnpm test:ci && pnpm build
```

CI runs the same on Node 20.x. If a hook fails, fix the root cause — do **not** bypass with `--no-verify`.

### Post-change manual checks (when relevant)

- Touched backend startup / MCP wiring → `pnpm dev`, hit `GET /health`, scan logs for `Successfully connected client for server: …`.
- Touched frontend UI → open the page in `pnpm frontend:dev` and exercise the path; tests don't catch UX regressions.
- Some MCP servers fail to connect without API keys — that is expected locally and not a regression signal.

---

## 3. Conventions (hard rules)

- **ESM imports**: always use `.js` extensions for relative imports (e.g. `import { x } from './foo.js'`). TS files included.
- **TypeScript strict** is on; do not weaken it. Don't paper over types with `any` — narrow or define a type.
- **Comments in English only.**
- **Formatting**: 2-space indent, single quotes — let Prettier decide (`pnpm format`). ESLint config is the flat [eslint.config.mjs](eslint.config.mjs).
- **Naming**:
  - Services / DAOs: `XxxService`, `XxxDao` (suffix-based).
  - React components & their files: `PascalCase`.
  - Utility modules: `camelCase`.
- **Shared types live in [src/types/](src/types/)**. Don't redefine DTOs locally.
- **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, …), imperative present tense.
- **PRs**: describe behavior change, list manual + automated tests, attach before/after for UI work, link issues. Keep generated artifacts out of the diff.

## 4. Architecture invariants

### Dual datasource (JSON ⇄ PostgreSQL)

`USE_DB=true` + `DB_URL` switches storage from `mcp_settings.json` to Postgres via TypeORM.

**When adding/changing a persisted field, update every layer or migrations will silently drop it:**

| # | File                       | What to do                          |
| - | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1 | `src/types/index.ts`       | Add/modify the interface            |
| 2 | `src/dao/*Dao.ts`          | JSON impl (if behavior changes)     |
| 3 | `src/db/entities/*.ts`     | TypeORM `@Column` (mark `nullable`, use `simple-json` for objects) |
| 4 | `src/dao/*DaoDbImpl.ts`    | Map field in create/update          |
| 5 | `src/db/repositories/*.ts` | Update if the wrapper exposes it    |
