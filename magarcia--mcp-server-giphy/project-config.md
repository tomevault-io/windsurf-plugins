You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, and RESTful API development. This project is a GIPHY API client library.

# TypeScript Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code; avoid any `any` types
- Prefer interfaces over types for API response objects
- Use type predicates and guards to handle nullable values rather than type assertions
- Export well-defined response types for all API endpoints
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect the GIPHY API terminology

# Code Structure

- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Separate API endpoint functions by category (search, trending, random, etc.)
- Use async/await for all API requests, not Promises with .then()
- Handle rate limiting and error responses consistently
- Include JSDoc comments for all public methods and interfaces

# API Client Design

- Ensure all API endpoints support the full range of parameters from GIPHY API
- Include proper pagination support for endpoints that return multiple results
- Use reasonable defaults for optional parameters
- Make the client configurable with options like rating, language, etc.
- Implement proper error handling with custom error types

# Testing Standards

- Write unit tests for all API endpoint functions
- Use mocks for external API calls in tests
- Include integration tests that validate against real API responses
- Test error handling scenarios like rate limiting and invalid API keys
- Ensure all public interfaces have test coverage

# Performance Considerations

- Implement request caching where appropriate
- Support both ESM and CommonJS module formats
- Keep dependencies minimal and up-to-date
- Ensure the package has a small bundle size
- Support tree-shaking for modular imports

# Documentation

- Keep README examples up-to-date with the current API
- Include TypeDoc documentation for all public interfaces
- Document rate limiting considerations
- Provide usage examples for each API endpoint category
- Include sample response objects in documentation

# Best Practices

- Favor immutable objects over mutable ones
- Use private class fields to hide implementation details
- Implement proper parameter validation before making API requests
- Use URL builder helper functions to construct API URLs
- Apply consistent error handling patterns throughout the codebase

# Contribution Guidelines

## Commit Message Format

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
- Structure: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore
- Use present tense, imperative mood in commit messages

## Pull Request Process

- Ensure code adheres to existing code style
- Update documentation if necessary
- Verify all tests pass
- Obtain review from at least one maintainer before merging

## Code Style

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use configured ESLint for code linting
- Write clear comments for functions and complex logic
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Development Workflow

- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch: `feature/your-feature-name`
- Test your changes: `npm test`
- Lint your code: `npm run lint`
- Build the project: `npm run build`
- Submit a pull request with comprehensive description
