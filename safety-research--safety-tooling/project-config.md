# Claude Code Guide - Safety Tooling

This guide helps Claude Code work effectively with the safety-tooling repository. For general project information, refer to README.md.

## Quick Context

This is an AI safety research toolkit that provides a unified API for multiple LLM providers. The codebase prioritizes stability, caching efficiency, and ease of use across research projects.

## Key Principles When Working on This Codebase

1. **Always preserve backward compatibility** - This is used as a submodule by many projects
2. **Caching is critical** - Never bypass caching without explicit user request
3. **API keys are sacred** - Never log or expose API keys, always use the `.env` pattern
4. **Rate limits matter** - Respect the built-in rate limiting mechanisms

## Common Tasks and Patterns

### Adding Support for a New Model

When a user asks to add support for a new model:

1. **First check if it works with `force_provider`** - Many new models work without code changes:
   ```python
   # Try this first before modifying any code
   response = await API(
       model_id="new-model-name",
       prompt=prompt,
       force_provider="openai"  # or "anthropic" if compatible
   )
   ```

2. **Only modify code if force_provider doesn't work** - Look for provider detection logic in the inference API

### Working with Caching

**DO:**
- Use the existing cache_dir pattern
- Respect NO_CACHE environment variable
- Maintain cache key compatibility

**DON'T:**
- Create new caching mechanisms
- Modify cache key generation without careful consideration
- Clear caches without explicit user request

### Handling API Keys

**Pattern to follow:**
```python
# Always use utils.setup_environment()
utils.setup_environment()

# For multiple keys, use the tag system
utils.setup_environment(
    openai_tag="OPENAI_API_KEY_PROJECT_X",
    anthropic_tag="ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_PROJECT_X"
)
```

**Never:**
- Hardcode API keys
- Create new environment variable patterns
- Log API keys in any form

### Creating Examples

When writing example code:
1. Always use async/await patterns (the API is async)
2. Include proper error handling
3. Use Path objects for file paths: `Path(".cache")`
4. Follow the established pattern from existing examples

### Modifying Core Components

**Before modifying any core files, check:**
- Can this be done with existing extension points?
- Will this break existing cached responses?
- Does this maintain backward compatibility?

**Core files to be extra careful with:**
- `safetytooling/apis/inference/api.py` - The main API
- `safetytooling/data_models/messages.py` - Data structures
- Cache-related files - Breaking changes invalidate caches

## Quick Reference

### Repository Structure

For a comprehensive understanding of this repository's structure, codebase organization, and development guidelines, please refer to the [REPO_GUIDE.md](./REPO_GUIDE.md). This guide contains detailed information about:

- Project architecture and module organization
- Development workflows and best practices
- Contributing guidelines
- Testing strategies

Read this file if you need to understand the structure of the repo in depth.

### Standard Inference Pattern
```python
from safetytooling.apis import InferenceAPI
from safetytooling.data_models import ChatMessage, MessageRole, Prompt
from safetytooling.utils import utils
from pathlib import Path

# Always start with this
utils.setup_environment()
API = InferenceAPI(cache_dir=Path(".cache"))

# Create prompts using the data models
prompt = Prompt(messages=[
    ChatMessage(content="Your message", role=MessageRole.user)
])

# Make API calls
response = await API(
    model_id="gpt-4o-mini",
    prompt=prompt,
    print_prompt_and_response=True,  # For debugging
)
```

### Debugging Issues

1. **Rate limit errors**: Check `openai_fraction_rate_limit` and `num_threads` settings
2. **Cache misses**: Verify cache_dir path and NO_CACHE environment variable
3. **API key issues**: Ensure `.env` file exists and `setup_environment()` is called
4. **Import errors**: User should install with `uv pip install -e .`

### Testing Changes

Always run tests before submitting:
```bash
# Quick tests
python -m pytest -v -s -n 6

# Full test suite (if modifying core functionality)
SAFETYTOOLING_SLOW_TESTS=True python -m pytest -v -s -n 6
```

## Important Conventions

### File Organization
- Examples go in `examples/` with descriptive subdirectories
- Keep provider-specific code isolated when possible
- Utilities should be general-purpose and well-tested

### Error Messages
- Be specific about what went wrong
- Suggest concrete fixes
- Point to relevant documentation or examples

### Documentation
- Update docstrings when modifying functions
- Add type hints to new code
- Include usage examples in docstrings for public APIs

## What to Avoid

1. **Breaking changes to Prompt or ChatMessage classes** - These are used everywhere
2. **Modifying cache key generation** - This invalidates existing caches
3. **Adding required parameters to existing functions** - Use optional parameters with defaults
4. **Creating new environment variable patterns** - Use the existing .env system
