# Yarn Package Management in Monorepo

## Adding New Packages

Always add new packages from the project root using the workspace syntax. This ensures proper monorepo dependency management and keeps the yarn.lock file consistent.

### Correct Way:

```bash
# Adding a package to a specific workspace
yarn workspace api add package-name
yarn workspace client add package-name
yarn workspace website add package-name

# Adding a dev dependency to a specific workspace
yarn workspace api add -D package-name

# Adding a package to all workspaces
yarn workspaces foreach add package-name
```

### Incorrect:

```bash
# DON'T navigate to the package directory and add dependencies directly
cd packages/api && yarn add package-name  # Wrong approach

# DON'T use npm in this project
npm install package-name  # Wrong approach
```

## Dependency Management Best Practices

1. **Consistent Versions**: Use the same version of shared dependencies across workspaces when possible.

2. **Root Dependencies**: Only add development tools and monorepo management utilities to the root package.json. All other dependencies should be in the appropriate workspace.

3. **Peer Dependencies**: For libraries shared between packages, consider using peer dependencies.

4. **Updating Dependencies**: Update dependencies using:
   ```bash
   yarn upgrade-interactive
   ```

5. **Resolving Conflicts**: Use the `resolutions` field in the root package.json for forcing specific versions.

## Example from this Project

In the root package.json, we have workspace definitions:

```json
"workspaces": [
  "packages/*"
]
```

This configuration allows Yarn to manage dependencies across all packages in the monorepo.
