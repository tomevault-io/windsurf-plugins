# Project Structure

Zauberstack is a monorepo organized using Yarn workspaces. The project is structured into multiple packages, each with a specific responsibility.

## Package Organization

- `packages/api/`: NestJS backend with GraphQL API
- `packages/client/`: React frontend application
- `packages/website/`: Website for the project (landing pages, marketing)

## Root Configuration

The project contains several root-level configuration files:

- [package.json](mdc:package.json): Project metadata, scripts, and workspace configuration
- [.env](mdc:.env): Environment variables (gitignored)
- [.gitignore](mdc:.gitignore): Git ignore patterns
- [.prettierrc](mdc:.prettierrc): Prettier configuration for code formatting
- [.eslintrc.js](mdc:.eslintrc.js): ESLint configuration for linting

## Key Scripts

The root `package.json` provides several scripts to manage the project:

```json
"scripts": {
  "client": "yarn workspace client dev",
  "api": "yarn workspace api start:dev",
  "website": "yarn workspace website dev",
  "init-db": "yarn workspace api migrate:dev && yarn workspace api seed",
  "start": "concurrently --kill-others-on-fail \"yarn api\" \"yarn client\" \"yarn website\"",
  "lint-client": "yarn workspace client lint",
  "lint-api": "yarn workspace api lint",
  "lint-website": "yarn workspace website lint",
  "prettier-api": "yarn workspace api format",
  "prettier-client": "yarn workspace client format",
  "e2e-test-api": "yarn workspace api test:e2e",
  "clean": "rimraf packages/*/node_modules && rimraf node_modules",
  "reinstall": "yarn clean && yarn install",
  "email:dev": "yarn workspace api email dev -p 3001 --dir src/mail/email_templates"
}
```

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed at two levels:

1. **Root Dependencies**: Tools and utilities used across the project
2. **Package Dependencies**: Specific to each package

The root `package.json` also includes `resolutions` to enforce consistent versions of shared libraries.

## Development Workflow

1. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
2. Initialize database: `yarn init-db`
3. Start all services: `yarn start`

Alternatively, you can start individual services:
- API: `yarn api`
- Client: `yarn client`
- Website: `yarn website`

## Environment Setup

Each package has its own environment configuration:

- `packages/api/.env`: Backend environment variables
- `packages/client/.env`: Frontend environment variables
- `packages/website/.env`: Website environment variables

Sample env files are provided (e.g., `env.example.txt`) as templates.

## Docker Support

The project includes Docker configuration for containerized deployment:

- `packages/api/Dockerfile.api`: API container configuration
- `packages/client/Dockerfile.client`: Client container configuration
- `docker-compose.yml`: Compose configuration for local development
