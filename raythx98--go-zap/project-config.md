- **Tools:** Docker, Docker Compose, Make, SQLC, Swagger, Migrate.

## Repository Rename (Jan 18, 2026)
The repository was renamed from `url-shortener` to `go-zap`.
- Updated `go.mod` module path.
- Updated all internal imports to `github.com/raythx98/go-zap`.
- Restructured `mocks/` directory.
- Updated `README.md` and `GEMINI.md`.

## Migration Plan (Status: Completed)

### 1. Cleanup
- [x] Remove `.nginx/` directory.

### 2. Configuration Files
- [x] **Create `docker-compose.yaml`**:
    - Define services: `caddy`, `app`, `migrate`, `db`.
    - Align volume and network configuration with `go-dutch`.
    - Use `APP_URLSHORTENER_*` environment variables.
- [x] **Create `Caddyfile`**:
    - Configure reverse proxy for the application.
    - Uses `129.150.49.141.sslip.io` as domain.

### 3. Build & Run Scripts
- [x] **Update `Dockerfile`**:
    - Change base image to `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot`.
    - Expose port `8080`.
    - Ensure `USER` is set to non-root.
- [x] **Update `Makefile`**:
    - Replace manual docker commands with `docker compose` commands (`up`, `down`, `logs`).
    - Simplify `run` and `db` targets.

### 4. CI/CD
- [x] **Update `.github/workflows/aws.yml`**:
    - Rename to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
    - Update "Deploy" job to use OCI/Podman logic from `go-dutch`.

### 5. Documentation
- [x] **Update `README.md`**:
    - Update deployment instructions for OCI.
    - Update local development instructions to use Docker Compose.
    - Remove AWS-specific mentions and Nginx configuration details.

## Next Steps
- Monitor deployment health.
- Consider adding more tests for the new module structure.
