## Claude Code-Specific Notes

### File Path Requirement
Always use **absolute Windows paths** with drive letters and backslashes for all file operations.
- Correct: `D:\projects\KafkaLens\ViewModels\MainViewModel.cs`
- Wrong: `./ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs`

### Memory
Persistent memory for this project is stored at:
`C:\Users\Pravin Chaudhary\.claude\projects\D--projects-KafkaLens\memory\`

### Workflow
- Do not run the application — the user runs it themselves.
- Do not ask the user to run commands — show the commands and let them decide.
- Always read a file before editing it.
- Use `TodoWrite` to track multi-step tasks.
