# Pomodoroz — Agent Rules

> Operational rules for AI agents working on this codebase.
> For project overview, stack, and commands, see `CLAUDE.md`.
> For pending improvements roadmap, see `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

---

## Scope

- Platform: Tauri desktop app.
- Architecture: standalone, no server, no cloud. All data is local.
- Direction: incremental evolution with focus on stability, security, and predictability.

---

## Mission

1. Preserve functional stability (timer, tasks, settings, tray, compact mode).
2. Maintain security hardening (Tauri commands/capabilities/CSP).
3. Evolve dependencies in small, testable, reversible blocks.
4. Keep cross-platform builds green (Windows, macOS, Linux).
5. Log changes in CHANGELOG; track decisions in docs.

---

## Rules

1. Work in small, testable, reversible blocks.
2. Preserve UX and behavior of timer/tasks/settings.
3. Before adding a new library: present options, impact, and wait for confirmation.
4. Never swap technology silently.
5. Code in English. Comments/logs in Portuguese (PT-BR) where appropriate.
6. Commit messages and PR titles must be in English (Conventional Commits).
7. At the end of each finalized implementation, AI agents must suggest a ready-to-use commit message (Conventional Commits, English).

## Documentation Policy

| What                         | Where                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Implemented changes          | `CHANGELOG.md` (EN) and `CHANGELOG.pt.md` (PT) |
| Pending improvements roadmap | `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md`                         |
| Migration closure reference  | `docs/MIGRATION_TO_TAURI.md`                   |
| Release/update operations    | `docs/RELEASE_OPERATIONS.md`                   |
| Versions and update policy   | `docs/VERSIONS.md`                             |
| Agent operational rules      | This file (`AGENTS.md`)                        |
| Claude Code guide            | `CLAUDE.md`                                    |
| Session handoff state        | `RETOMADA.md`                                  |
| Session handoff template     | `RETOMADA.example.md`                          |

Do not create loose specs/checklists for topics already covered in the documents above.

### RETOMADA.md Rules

`RETOMADA.md` is an operational handoff document — a lean snapshot to resume work in a new chat without rebuilding context. It is **not** a source of truth for governance (that is `AGENTS.md`) and **not** a planning document (that is `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md`).

1. Update `RETOMADA.md` at the end of each major phase, relevant operational fix, or real/manual validation that changes the next step.
2. Use `RETOMADA.example.md` only as the reset template if `RETOMADA.md` needs to be recreated.
3. Replace old context with current context; **do not accumulate history**.
4. Keep it lean — it should contain only what the next session needs to pick up where work stopped.
5. Do not store secrets, tokens, credentials, private endpoints, or personal data in `RETOMADA.md`.

### Changelog Rules

1. Source of truth for GitHub Release notes: `CHANGELOG.md` section `## [x.y.z]`.
2. Before creating a tag/release, update both `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG.pt.md`.
3. Never edit items of an already-published version; new changes go in the next version.
4. Keep the next version at the top as `A definir` (PT) / `TBD` (EN); set date only on release day.
5. Do not create tag `v*` without a valid entry in both changelogs.
6. When an AI agent suggests running `./scripts/release.sh` or `./scripts/release.ps1`, it must first set the target version date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in both changelog headers for that version.

## MCP (Recommended Usage)

| MCP                 | When to use                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| context7            | API and official documentation questions |
| sequential-thinking | Planning larger migrations               |
| playwright          | UI behavior investigation                |

Use MCP as decision support; do not duplicate history or roadmap in this file.

## Long-term memory (ai-memory)

This project uses [ai-memory](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-memory)
for cross-session continuity.

**Default to the current project - always.** Every ai-memory tool
auto-scopes to the project resolved from your session's working
directory. **Do NOT pass `project`, `workspace`, or `cwd` arguments unless
the user explicitly references a _different_ project by name** (e.g. "what
did we decide in the `other-app` project?"). Phrases like "this project",
"here", "we", "our work", and "where did we leave off" all mean the
_current_ project, so call tools with no scoping args.

This default assumes the MCP client can identify the current agent
session. Static MCP clients in parallel sessions for the same user cannot
forward the real agent session id automatically; pass explicit
`workspace` + `project` / `scopes`, or use a session-aware bridge that
forwards the lifecycle-hook session id on MCP calls.

**Lifecycle hooks already capture every prompt and tool call
automatically.** Do not manually write routine notes. Only write durable
