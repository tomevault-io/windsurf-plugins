# Factory Log

Factory Log is a native macOS app, a companion CLI, and a shared core library in one Swift 6.2 package. Coding agents report finished work through the CLI, and the app turns those reports into a timeline of each day and week. The event log stays local, append-only, and readable without the app.

This file is public. Keep notes about your own machine in `.cursor/rules/*.local.mdc`, which git ignores.

## Files

- `Sources/FactoryLogCore/`: the event model and JSON contract, `EventStore` (locked appends, validation, compaction), `FactoryLogHistory` (tasks, days, projects), `FactoryLogActiveTime` (work sessions and estimated time), `EventStoreWatcher`, and `DayNarrator` (optional one-sentence recaps from a local Ollama model).
- `Sources/FactoryLogCLI/`: the `factorylog` command agents call.
- `Sources/FactoryLogApp/`: the SwiftUI app.
  - `FactoryLogApp.swift`: the window, the Today, Yesterday, Week and Insights screens, reloading, and the update menu item.
  - `DayView.swift`, `DaySummaryView.swift`: one day, with its timeline, summary and log.
  - `WeekView.swift`, `TimelineCharts.swift`: the week ribbon, the day timeline and the project donut.
  - `ActivityDashboardView.swift`, `PortfolioDashboardView.swift`, `ProjectTime.swift`, `ProjectDetailPanel.swift`, `DashboardData.swift`, `DashboardSharedViews.swift`: Insights and the project panel.
  - `WelcomeView.swift`: the first-run setup and the empty-screen previews.
  - `AgentSetup.swift`: installing the CLI and agent instructions, the login-shell PATH check, Codex sandbox access and the test report.
  - `AppSettingsView.swift`, `HiddenProjects.swift`, `ProjectPalette.swift`: settings, hidden projects, project colors.
  - `AppUpdater.swift`: in-app updates from GitHub Releases, a copy of a shared template.
  - `DebugSnapshot.swift`: debug builds only, draws the window to a PNG on request.
- `Integrations/`: the agent instructions and Cursor rule the app installs.
- `Scripts/`: building, releasing, verification, screenshots and importers.
- `docs/`: the event contract and the agent integration guides.

## Build and run

Requires macOS 15 and Swift 6.2 (Xcode 26).

```sh
swift test                               # core and CLI tests
zsh Scripts/build-app.zsh debug          # .build/Factory Log.app
open ".build/Factory Log.app"
zsh Scripts/verify-release.zsh           # tests, universal release build, signatures, concurrent writes
zsh Scripts/build-release.zsh            # dist/Factory-Log-<version>.zip for a GitHub release
zsh Scripts/screenshots.zsh              # docs/ screenshots from a generated demo log
```

## Rules

- Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/event-contract.md` before changing storage. Keep schema version 1 readable unless the change ships a documented migration and fixtures.
- Shared storage and model behavior goes in `FactoryLogCore`. The CLI and the app are clients of it.
- Never collect source code, diffs, terminal output, or secrets.
- User-facing mutations go through `EventStore.appendValidated(_:)`. Don't bypass its cross-process transaction.
- Concurrency changes need a multi-writer regression test.
- `Sources/FactoryLogApp/AppUpdater.swift` is a copy of a template shared by several apps. Don't edit it here.
- The release contract, or installed copies can't update: the tag is `vX.Y.Z`, equal to `CFBundleShortVersionString` in `Resources/FactoryLog-Info.plist` and `FactoryLogVersion.current`. The release is the latest one, not a draft or prerelease, with one universal, ad-hoc signed zip made by `Scripts/build-release.zsh`, `Factory Log.app` at its top. The notes start with what's new, since the update dialog shows them up to `## Install`.
- Screenshots and videos use generated demo data, never a real event log.
- After changing anything under `Sources/`, rebuild and relaunch the app bundle (`.cursor/rules/restart-app-after-change.mdc`).

## Learned User Preferences

- Keep the UI minimal: list each task once (never one row per status) and drop redundant chrome such as Done checkmarks, "Thread history", update counts, and "X daily work" headings.
- Order log entries newest first, show relative times ("5 minutes ago"), and hide repeated identical time labels rather than regrouping rows.
- Lists must update live from the event store; never rely on a manual refresh button.
- Summaries describe one person plus agents, never "the team": write "Implemented X, Y, Z" in plain past tense.
- On past days the Summary tab shows only project name, time, and one sentence per project; the Log tab shows every individual update.
- Keyboard: ⌘1 to ⌘4 switch screens; Left/Right arrows switch between Summary and Log on a day and between weeks on Week; Esc leaves a project filter, then a day opened from another screen.
- Videos and showreels use a light background and keep sound effects, with no background music or noise.
