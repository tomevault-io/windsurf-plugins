# gemini.md - AI Assistant Guidelines for Stellar Engine

## Project Overview

Stellar Engine is a fork of the Google Cloud Foundation Fabric (CFF), providing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to help Google Cloud Platform
(GCP) customers create secure and compliant landing zones. It has a strong focus on environments requiring Assured Workload overlays, such
as FedRAMP High, IL4, and IL5, and includes documentation mapping NIST 800-53r5 controls to accelerate Authorization to Operate (ATO)
processes.

**Key Technologies:** Terraform, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Core Principles & Guardrails for Blueprint Development

These principles MUST be followed when creating or modifying Terraform blueprints and modules in this repository.

1.  **Maximize Reusability (Critical):** This is the most important principle. DO NOT redefine common elements. ALWAYS REUSE existing base
configurations and modules.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Inherit from and extend base variable definitions found in `variables.tf` files within individual
modules and blueprints. Avoid hardcoding values. Common variables are typically defined within each module (e.g.,
`modules/net-vpc/variables.tf`).
    *   **Service Accounts:** Reuse existing service account definitions and IAM policies, primarily managed through the
`modules/iam-service-account/` module. Do not create new service accounts with overlapping permissions. Always adhere to the principle of
least privilege.
    *   **Networking:** Leverage the base networking infrastructure. New blueprints should connect to or build upon the VPCs, subnets, and
firewall rules defined in modules like `modules/net-vpc/`, `modules/net-vpc-firewall/`, etc. Do not create parallel or redundant network
structures.

2.  **Modularity:** Design blueprints to be modular and composable. Utilize the existing modules in the `modules/` directory. Break down
complex deployments into smaller, reusable components.

3.  **Documentation:** All new or modified modules and blueprints must include a `README.md` explaining their purpose, inputs (variables),
outputs, and any dependencies.

4.  **Naming Conventions:** Strictly follow the established naming conventions outlined in `documentation/naming-convention.md`.
Consistency in naming variables, resources, modules, and files is crucial.

5.  **Security:** Adhere to GCP security best practices and the principle of least privilege in all configurations. Ensure compliance with
the targeted regime (FedRAMP High, IL5, etc.).

## Key Codebase Resources

*   **Base Environment Variable Configurations:** Defined within each module and blueprint's `variables.tf` file (e.g.,
`modules/net-vpc/variables.tf`, `blueprints/il5/bigquery/variables.tf`).
*   **Core Service Account Definitions:** `modules/iam-service-account/`
*   **Base Networking Modules:**
    *   VPC: `modules/net-vpc/`
    *   Firewall: `modules/net-vpc-firewall/`
    *   Subnets: Typically defined within the `modules/net-vpc/` module.
    *   Other networking components: See other modules starting with `net-` in the `modules/` directory.
*   **Naming Convention Documentation:** `documentation/naming-convention.md`
*   **Examples of Well-Structured Blueprints:**
    *   `blueprints/il5/bigquery/`
    *   `blueprints/fedramp-high/cloud-run/`
    *   The `fast/` directory contains staged blueprints for bootstrapping an organization.

## Guidance for AI Assistants

When generating or modifying code within the Stellar Engine repository, especially for new blueprints or modules:

1.  **ALWAYS** refer to the **Core Principles & Guardrails** and **Key Codebase Resources** outlined above.
2.  **PRIORITIZE REUSE:** Before creating any new resource, thoroughly check if an existing module or configuration in `modules/` or
`fast/` can be leveraged, particularly for:
    *   Networking (VPCs, subnets, firewalls)
    *   Service Accounts and IAM
    *   Common variable patterns
3.  **Follow Naming Conventions:** Adhere strictly to `documentation/naming-convention.md`.
4.  **Ask for Clarification:** If a request seems to require creating a new fundamental resource (e.g., a new base VPC, a new highly
privileged service account), ask the user to confirm if this is truly necessary and why existing components cannot be used.
5.  **Consult Module READMEs:** When using a module from `modules/`, always read its `README.md` to understand its usage, inputs, and
outputs.
