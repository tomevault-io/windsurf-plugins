# Personal Space — Build Rules

These rules apply to every agent working on this project.

## The job

Build Personal Space exactly as specified in [REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md). That document
is the contract: its phases, success criteria and final criteria decide when work is done. When in
doubt, REQUIREMENTS.md wins.

## The team

- **orchestrator** (primary) — plans, delegates, reviews, gates phases. Does not write code.
- **frontend-dev** — all frontend code and frontend unit tests.
- **backend-dev** — all backend code, storage, seed data and backend unit tests.
- **qa** — end-to-end tests, test runs, screenshots, DEFECTS.md. Does not fix code.
- **adversary** — tries to break the running app; records findings in ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW.md.

Role boundaries are enforced by permissions and are absolute. Do not work around them with shell
commands: if the edit tool would deny a file, do not modify that file any other way.

## Repository conventions

- End-to-end tests, and their configuration, live under `e2e/`. Only qa writes there.
- Screenshots live under `screenshots/`.
- No emojis in code, comments, print statements or logging. (Emoji page icons in the product's
  data and UI are a feature, not a violation.)
- Keep it simple: small modules, clear names, no defensive programming, no overengineering.
  Prefer popular, well-supported libraries over custom code.

## DEFECTS.md — the defect ledger

All defects live in `DEFECTS.md` at the repo root, one entry per defect, newest first.
Writers: **qa** (create, close, reopen) and **orchestrator** (record developer responses,
reject). Nobody else edits it, ever.

Format, exactly:

    ## DEF-001: Short title

    - Status: OPEN
    - Severity: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
    - Found by: qa | adversary (ADV-003)
    - Phase: 3

    Steps to reproduce:
    1. Numbered, specific, starting from app launch.

    Expected: What should happen.
    Actual: What happens instead.
    Screenshot: screenshots/def-001.png (optional)

    History:
    - qa: opened

Statuses and who may set them:

| Status | Meaning | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| OPEN | Filed, or reopened after a failed retest or a bounced dispute | qa |
| FIX-READY | A developer reports a fix is in | orchestrator, relaying the developer |
| DISPUTED | A developer reports CANNOT REPRODUCE or WORKING AS INTENDED, with a reason | orchestrator, relaying the developer verbatim |
| CLOSED | qa retested and confirmed the fix, or accepted the dispute | qa only |
| REJECTED | Will not fix, with a written reason | orchestrator only |

Every status change appends a History line saying who, what and why. A defect is never done
because a developer says so — it is done when qa closes it.

## ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW.md — the adversary's findings

All adversary findings live in `ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW.md` at the repo root.
Writers: **adversary** (create entries) and **orchestrator** (fill Disposition). Nobody else.

Format, exactly:

    ## ADV-001: Short title

    - Session: phase-3 gate | final
    - Suggested severity: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW

    What I did: ...
    Expected: ...
    Actual: ...
    Screenshot: screenshots/adv-001.png (optional)

    Disposition: PENDING

The orchestrator replaces PENDING with either `ACCEPTED -> DEF-NNN` or `REJECTED - reason`.
Accepted findings are reproduced and filed in DEFECTS.md by qa. No entry may remain PENDING when
the final phase completes.
