# Project Architecture Rules

## System Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Break system into independent, testable modules
- **Layered Architecture**: Separate concerns into distinct layers (UI, Business Logic, Data Access)
- **Service-Oriented**: Use service classes for business logic operations
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access through repository interfaces
- **Event-Driven**: Use events for loose coupling between components

## Component Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together
- **Low Coupling**: Minimal dependencies between components
- **Interface Segregation**: Expose only necessary methods
- **Dependency Injection**: Inject dependencies rather than creating them

## Data Flow
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in one direction through the system
- **Immutable Data**: Prefer immutable data structures where possible
- **State Management**: Centralized state management for complex state
- **Event Sourcing**: Use events for state changes and audit trails
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching at different levels

## Code Architecture
- **SOLID Principles**: Implement all SOLID principles strictly
- **Design Patterns**: Use Factory, Strategy, Adapter, Observer, and Command patterns
- **Code Organization**: Keep related functionality together, separate concerns clearly
- **Package Structure**: Implement proper package structure with `__init__.py` files
