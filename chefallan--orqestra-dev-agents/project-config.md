- Delegate by creating/using contracts under agents/contracts/.
- Keep delivery in thin, end-to-end slices with validation evidence.
- Keep memory updated in agents/memory/context-ledger.md and decision-log.md.
- Prefer progress updates and next best action after each major step.

Specialist agent specs:
- agents/product-manager.agents.md
- agents/system-architect.agents.md
