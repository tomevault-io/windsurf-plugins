# friendly-filer

## Overview

TRON-styled FPS disc shooter that is also a real file manager. Rust +
crossterm, termray-powered raycasting. The current directory is the
arena, files are red wireframe enemies, subfolders are blue portals.
Throwing the identity disc identifies the target, opens the operation
menu, and the player picks `open` / `rename` / `move` / `copy` /
`delete` / `info`. `delete` goes to `.trash`, `u` undoes. No Game
Over — `crash` respawns at the folder entrance with full HP. FPS
semantics can be switched off (`F1`) so the program degrades to a
quiet 3D file browser.

(Formerly `felipe`, renamed 2026-04-16. The bevy predecessor was
deleted in Phase 0 / #2 and lives in git history only. The earlier
three-phase "3D filer" plan has been folded into the FPS layer — see
`docs/fps-spec.md` and Issue #8.)

## Architecture

Single-crate binary depending on the external
[`termray`](https://github.com/kako-jun/termray) crate (0.3+). The
simulation layer is pure Rust; rendering is outsourced to termray.

### Module map (`src/`)

- `main.rs` — entry point, terminal guard, 60 FPS frame loop
- `lib.rs` — public re-exports of the modules below
- `palette.rs` — TRON 3-color constants (`BG_BLACK`, `GRID_BLUE`,
  `ENEMY_RED`, `GEOMETRY_GRAY`, `UI_BLUE`, `WARN_RED`)
- `player.rs` — `Player`, `new`, `is_crashed` (data only; motion lives
  in `physics.rs`)
- `input.rs` — `FrameInput`, `poll_frame_input` (crossterm → frame
  intents; WASD / Space / arrows / Shift / F1 / Esc)
- `physics.rs` — `step_movement`, `step_gravity`, `try_jump`,
  `add_yaw`, `add_pitch`, tunable `pub const`s (config override in #17)
- `render.rs` — `present`, `WallTextureFlat`, `FloorTextureGrid`
  (TRON-coloured termray adapters + half-block stdout flush)
- `enemy.rs` — `EnemyKind`, `Enemy`, `Enemy::from_metadata`, `Swarm`
  (AI in #9)
- `disc.rs` — `DiscState`, `Disc`, `is_ready` (physics in #10)
- `portal.rs` — `Portal`, `Monolith`, `ParentGate`,
  `is_dangerous_path` (sealed doors in #11)
- `menu.rs` — `Operation`, `MenuContext` (effects & undo in #12)
- `hud.rs` — `Hud`, `Mode` (full HUD in #13)
- `config.rs` — `Config` + `Default`, `AimStyle` (TOML in #17)
- `scene.rs` — `DirScene` with placeholder `GridMap` + `FlatHeightMap`
  + `spawn_yaw`; `map()` / `heights()` / `camera()` accessors drive the
  termray pipeline. Real `read_dir` → scene in the absorbed #3 scope.

All modules ship with unit tests at the skeleton stage (10 tests green).

## Operation model (planned)

- **FPS controls** — WASD / hjkl move, space jumps (single, gravity),
  keyboard or mouse aim (config toggle, keyboard default).
- **Identity disc** — throw, bounce off walls, multi-hit, returns.
  Can't throw again until it comes back; damage accumulated while out =
  lock strength; confirm with Enter / right click. `delete`-style
  operations always prompt.
- **Targets**
  - File enemy → per-file op menu
  - Portal (subfolder) → enter = `cd`, shoot = folder-level op menu
  - Monolith (current folder) → shoot for new-file / new-folder / copy
    / move / delete / rename of the current dir
  - Parent gate (`..`) → can't be shot, only walked into
- **Search** — `/` freezes time, fuzzy search, warp to hit.
- **FPS OFF** — `F1` disables combat; enemies stand still, selection is
  cursor-only.

## Visual style (TRON)

3-color palette: bright-cyan blue for grid / walls / friendly UI /
identified files, bright red for enemies / warnings / lock-ons / HP,
gray for geometry faces, on a black background. High-intensity ANSI +
bold stands in for terminal glow. No bloom, no ligatures (consistent
with the neo-env rules in `MEMORY.md`).

Atmosphere work (fog, per-depth color shift, theming) is pulled into
the TRON discipline rather than the old "Made in Abyss / Evangelion"
mood — a single, consistent TRON look beats a mixed-metaphor one.

## Build & run

```bash
cargo run --release
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
cargo test
```

`cargo run` now drops into a playable first-person walk-around: an
8×8 TRON arena rendered by the real termray raycaster, with WASD
movement, Shift to sprint, Space to jump (single, gravity), arrow keys
for yaw / pitch aim, F1 toggling FPS-OFF, and Esc / q quitting. A
minimal debug HUD prints position, yaw, pitch, vz and HP at the bottom
of the screen.

## Current stage

FPS layer skeleton (#8) + playable walk-around (#18). Module shapes,
palette, scene-backed termray pipeline, input / physics / render
modules. Enemies, disc, portals, menus, full HUD, search, input mode,
FPS-OFF content, config and real filesystem reads all land in #9 –
#17.

## Roadmap

| Issue | Scope |
|---|---|
| #8  | TRON skeleton + FPS spec (this) |
| #9  | Enemy spawn & AI, LOD / Swarm, `notify` watch |
| #10 | Identity disc: throw, bounce, multi-hit, return |
| #11 | Portals, monolith, parent gate, sealed doors |
| #12 | Operation menu, bulk ops, per-op effect, `.trash`, Undo |
| #13 | HUD, minimap, crash / respawn |
| #14 | Search mode (`/`, fuzzy warp) |
| #15 | Input mode (rename, new file, new folder) |
| #16 | FPS OFF, preview, shell integration (`--cd-on-exit`) |
| #17 | Config (palette, keys, LOD thresholds) |
| #18 | Player movement (WASD, jump, gravity, aim) — **done** |
