# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Note to agents like Claude Code

The project uses .memory directory as an append-only log of architectural decisions made while developing:
* before doing planning, read the .memory directory for relevant topics discussed/implemented in the past
* when a plan has an architectural decision which can be important context in the future, always include a point to append the summary and reasoning (why are we making it and why not something else) for the change.
* update .memory only for important bits of information.

### Build notes

* when you change dependencies, do a `cargo clean` to purge old cache to save on disk space.
* we have also benches which are excluded from `cargo check`, so always do `cargo check --all-targets` to validate that the codebase is clean

## Project Overview

Murr is a columnar in-memory cache for AI/ML inference workloads, written in Rust (edition 2024). It serves as a Redis replacement optimized for batch feature retrieval — fetching specific columns for batches of document keys in a single request.

**Key design goals:**
- Pull-based data sync: Workers poll S3/Iceberg for new Parquet partitions and reload automatically
- Zero-copy responses: Custom binary segment format with memory-mapped reads
- Stateless: No primary/replica coordination, horizontal scaling by pointing workers at S3
- Columnar storage: Optimized for "give me columns X, Y, Z for keys 1-200" access patterns

**Status:** Pre-alpha. The codebase uses a custom binary `.seg` format (`src/io/`) with `MurrService` (`src/service/`) wrapping the storage layer. Two API layers serve concurrently: Axum HTTP and Arrow Flight gRPC (via `tokio::try_join!` in `main.rs`), with listen addresses driven by config. Only `Float32` and `Utf8` column types are implemented so far. The storage layer (`src/io/`) uses trait-based Directory/Reader/Writer abstractions and URL-based location scheme.

## Common Commands

```bash
cargo build                  # Build the project
cargo test                   # Run all tests
cargo test <name>            # Run specific test by name
cargo check                  # Fast syntax/type check without codegen
cargo clippy                 # Linting
cargo fmt                    # Format code
cargo bench --bench <name>   # Run a specific benchmark (multi_segment_index_bench)
```

### Python bindings

```bash
cd python
uv venv .venv --python 3.14  # One-time venv setup
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install maturin pytest pyarrow pydantic
maturin develop              # Build and install in dev mode
pytest tests/ -v             # Run Python tests
```

## Architecture

### Module Structure

**`io/`** — Storage layer with trait-based Directory/Reader/Writer abstractions
- `directory/mod.rs` — `Directory`, `Reader`, `Writer` traits with associated types for location (`Url`) and I/O backends
- `directory/mmap/` — Memory-mapped file backend (`MMapDirectory`) using `memmap2`
- `directory/mem/` — In-memory backend (`MemDirectory`) for testing
- `url.rs` — `Url` trait with `LocalUrl` (`file://`) and `S3Url` (`s3://`) implementations
- `info.rs` — `TableInfo`, `ColumnInfo`, `SegmentInfo` metadata structs (serialized as `_metadata.json`)
- `bytes.rs` — `FromBytes<T>` trait for zero-copy type casting from raw page bytes
- `column/` — Column segment types (`float32/`, `utf8/` with footer, reader, writer)
- `bitmap.rs` — Null bitmap implementation using u64-word bit array
- `table/` — Table-level abstractions: `Table`, `TableReader`, `KeyOffset`, `KeyIndex`

**`service/`** — High-level service wrapping the storage layer
- `MurrService` — Owns `Config`, holds `RwLock<HashMap<String, TableState>>` table registry; constructor takes `Config` (not a path)
- `create(table_name, schema)` → `write(table_name, batch)` → `read(table_name, keys, columns)` flow
- `config()` accessor exposes config to API layers (serve methods read listen addresses from it)
- `state.rs` — `TableState` holds `Arc<Table<MMapDirectory>>` and `Option<TableReader>`; reader is `None` until first write, then incrementally reopened on subsequent writes

**`api/http/`** — Axum HTTP API layer
- `mod.rs` — `MurrHttpService` struct: `new()`, `router()`, `serve()` (reads listen addr from config)
- `handlers.rs` — Route handlers with `State<Arc<MurrService>>` extractors
- `convert.rs` — `FetchResponse` (batch→JSON) and `WriteRequest` (JSON→batch) conversions
- `error.rs` — `ApiError` newtype mapping `MurrError` → HTTP status codes
- Content negotiation: fetch supports JSON or Arrow IPC response (`Accept` header); write supports JSON or Arrow IPC request (`Content-Type` header)

**`api/flight/`** — Arrow Flight gRPC layer (read-only)
- `mod.rs` — `MurrFlightService` implementing `FlightService` trait via tonic
- `ticket.rs` — `FetchTicket { table, keys, columns }` JSON-encoded ticket format
- `error.rs` — `MurrError` → `tonic::Status` conversion
- Implemented RPCs: `do_get` (fetch by keys+columns), `get_flight_info`, `get_schema`, `list_flights`
- All write RPCs (`do_put`, `do_exchange`, `do_action`) return `Unimplemented`
