# Project workflows

## Feature development

For every new feature, use `$feature-dev` before implementation. Inspect the code and all project documentation, complete the one-question-at-a-time product and technical 质问, and record the agreed product requirements, architecture decisions, and general specification under `docs/` before changing feature code.

Documentation layout:

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `docs/prd/` | Product requirements: problem, users, goals/non-goals, flows, acceptance criteria |
| `docs/adr/` | Architecture decisions: context, choice, alternatives, trade-offs, failure bounds |
| `docs/spec.md` | Single source of truth for terminology, observable contracts, and system-wide invariants |

Read the relevant docs before changing feature code. Existing decisions live in `docs/adr/`, requirements in `docs/prd/`. Prefer updating those files over inventing parallel notes.

## Documentation rules

- Every completed feature 质问 leaves a PRD, at least one ADR when a material technical choice exists, and an update to `docs/spec.md` for any stable observable rule.
- `docs/spec.md` stays implementation-independent: shared terminology, externally observable contracts, and invariants. Put feature rationale in the PRD and decision rationale in ADRs.
- Use concise kebab-case filenames derived from the feature or decision (for example `docs/prd/cli-run.md`, `docs/adr/error-types.md`).
- Prefer testable product statements in PRDs. Do not hide unresolved product questions inside implementation TODOs.
- If code and docs disagree, surface the conflict during 质问 or before commit; do not silently pick one side.

## Commit and ship

Before any commit, review staged, unstaged, and untracked changes against `docs/spec.md` and every relevant document under `docs/adr/` and `docs/prd/`. If the implementation changes a documented fact, update and stage the documentation in the same change. Use `$git-commit` to stage logical groups and create conventional commits from the diff.

# Commands

- `wails3 task dev` — run the desktop shell with the Vite renderer.
- `wails3 task build` — build the renderer and desktop app (macOS `.app` included).
- `wails3 task package` — build and package the macOS DMG.
- `go test ./internal/desktop/` — run config and listen-button tests.
- `pnpm --dir frontend run build` — typecheck and build the renderer.

Wails Go module and CLI are pinned to `v3.0.0-beta.24`; the frontend runtime is `3.0.0-beta.24`. Install the CLI with `go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@v3.0.0-beta.24`. On this Mac use Apple's compiler (`CC=/usr/bin/clang`, `CXX=/usr/bin/clang++`) so Go can find SDK headers.

Frontend install and scripts use pnpm. `Taskfile.yml` and `build/config.yml` define build and development commands. Generate TypeScript bindings with `wails3 task bindings`. Product behavior is specified in `docs/prd/local-proxy.md`.

# Code style

- Prefer small modules with clear ownership boundaries over large catch-all files.
- Domain types and invariants belong in library code when the project grows past a single entry file.
- Errors should be typed where boundaries matter; avoid stringly-typed failure modes for contracts covered by the spec.
- Tests protect invariants and acceptance criteria from PRDs/spec, not implementation trivia.
