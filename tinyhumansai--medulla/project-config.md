# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is a two-crate Cargo workspace: the `medulla` SDK library at `src/sdk/` and the `medulla-tui` app crate at `src/tui/` (which ships the `medulla` binary). Keep reusable APIs in the SDK; keep rendering and process wiring in the app crate.

- `src/sdk/src/client/` implements the backend HTTP/SSE client and protocol types.
- `src/sdk/src/runtime/` contains backend, core-socket, and scripted mock runtime adapters.
- `src/sdk/src/daemon/` and `src/sdk/src/tinyplace_support/` implement provider and tiny.place integration.
- `src/sdk/src/workflows/` owns authored multi-step workflows (store, execution, authoring, MCP tools); `src/sdk/src/flow_engine/` is the adapter seam onto the vendored `tinyflows` engine. Keep engine coupling in the seam.
- `src/sdk/src/ui/` holds the UI-facing data surface (events, agent lanes, chat store, onboarding screen, util); the app crate re-exports it under `crate::ui`.
- `src/tui/src/ui/` owns ratatui state, rendering, input, and theming; `src/tui/src/cli.rs` owns argument parsing; `src/tui/src/main.rs` owns process wiring.
- `src/sdk/tests/` and `src/tui/tests/` contain feature and mocked end-to-end suites; reusable stand-ins live in `src/sdk/tests/support/` (the app crate's tests reach them via `#[path]`).
- `vendor/tinyplace/` is vendored upstream code, excluded from the workspace. Avoid unrelated edits there.
- `target/` and `.medulla-state/` are generated or local runtime data; never commit them.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `cargo run` starts the TUI with the mock runtime when no credentials are set.
- `cargo run --release` runs an optimized build.
- `cargo install --path src/tui` installs the `medulla` binary.
- `cargo test` runs unit, feature, and mocked end-to-end tests for both crates without live network access.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` treats all lint warnings as failures.
- `cargo fmt --check` verifies formatting; run `cargo fmt` to apply it.
- `cargo llvm-cov` reports coverage when `cargo-llvm-cov` and `llvm-tools-preview` are installed.

Run tests, Clippy, and formatting before handoff.

### Driving the TUI under tmux

Seeing a visible change means running the binary in a detached tmux session and
capturing the pane. The developer is working in tmux too, so:

- **Never `tmux kill-session` on a name you did not just create.** Not even with
  `2>/dev/null` — that hides the "no such session" case and makes destroying
  someone else's session look like a no-op. A killed session cannot be recovered.
- **Give your session a name that cannot collide.** `medulla` and `med` are what
  a human names theirs.

```bash
S=agent-medulla-$$
tmux new-session -d -s "$S" -x 170 -y 42 "MEDULLA_HOME=$(mktemp -d) ./target/debug/medulla"
tmux capture-pane -p -t "$S"
tmux send-keys -t "$S" Tab            # drive it
tmux kill-session -t "$S"             # only ever the name you created
```

Point `MEDULLA_HOME` at a scratch directory so the run reads its own workflow
store, agent templates, and state rather than the developer's.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use standard `rustfmt` output (four-space indentation). Name modules, functions, and files in `snake_case`; types and traits in `PascalCase`; constants in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. Prefer explicit error types at library boundaries and `anyhow` for binary orchestration. Keep imports grouped at the top.

## File Organization & Size

These rules are mandatory for all new and edited Rust source. Split proactively rather than letting a file grow past the limit.

- **500-line ceiling.** No `.rs` file should exceed 500 lines of code, excluding comments. When a file approaches the limit, split it into focused submodules before adding more code.
- **Canonical directory modules.** A leaf module may use `foo.rs` only while it remains a single file. As soon as it needs any child file, move its implementation to `foo/mod.rs` and place the children under `foo/`. Never keep `foo.rs` beside a `foo/` directory or use `#[path = "foo/..."]` as a substitute for the canonical layout. Keep `mod.rs` focused on module docs, `mod`/`pub use` wiring, and glue that fits no more specific submodule.
- **Types in `types.rs`.** A module's data types (structs, enums, type aliases) and their trivial `impl`s live in `foo/types.rs`, re-exported from `foo/mod.rs`. Behaviour-heavy `impl`s may live beside the logic that uses them when that reads more clearly.
- **Tests in `tests.rs`.** Unit tests for a directory module live in `foo/tests.rs`, declared from `foo/mod.rs` with `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`, not inline at the bottom of a logic file. A single-file leaf module's tests use a dedicated sibling `_tests.rs` file until the module becomes a directory. Cross-module and end-to-end tests stay in the crate's `tests/` directory.
- **Split by responsibility.** Group submodules by cohesive purpose (parsing, resolution, rendering, persistence), not arbitrary line count. Each submodule states its single purpose in its module doc.
