# What is a Workspace?

A workspace is a structured development environment designed to function as an exocortex or second brain - a conversational data platform where users describe their data needs in natural language, and a coding agent materializes the technical solution. It serves as a comprehensive platform where you can pull data from various sources, run it through processing workflows, and visualize results through React applications.

## Workspace Structure

A workspace follows a specific organizational structure with four main directories:

- **`/console`** — A React app that provides a file browser showing document state in keepsync stores, plus a worker tab with up-to-date information on which workers have run, when they ran, and what data was moved

- **`/instructions`** — Contains instructions and guidelines for coding agents. Instructions are co-located with functionality: project-level instructions in `/instructions/`, view-specific guidance in `/views/llms.txt`, worker patterns in `/workers/llms.txt`, etc.

- **`/views`** — Storage location for Tonk apps (or views) created using `tonk create`. These are interactive React applications that visualize data and provide user interfaces

- **`/workers`** — Contains Tonk workers created with `tonk create`. These handle background processing, data ingestion, transformation, and can listen to keepsync stores or file systems for automated workflows

## Agent Interaction Model

**Command-Line Assistant**: The agent interacts through command-line tool use, acting as a conversational assistant that helps users build data processing pipelines. The agent should:

- Guide users through `tonk create` CLI flows (interactive selection of component type and naming)
- **Vibecode** implementations (generate actual code on behalf of the user)
- Suggest specific parsing libraries and technical approaches
- Ask clarifying questions to disambiguate user intent
- Reference co-located instructions (e.g., `/workers/llms.txt` for keepsync listening patterns)

## Data Storage: Keepsync

The workspace uses **keepsync** as its data backbone. Keepsync handles data storage and synchronization between components. Workers read from and write to keepsync stores, creating flows of data that views can then visualize. The four directories don't communicate directly - they're organized for convenience and quick access to context-specific information.

## Typical Workflow Example

Here's how users typically build data processing pipelines:

1. **Ingest**: Create a worker to bring in data (e.g., Google data) → store in keepsync
2. **Visualize**: Create a view to display that data  
3. **Transform**: Create another worker to read keepsync data → transform into summaries (e.g., OpenAI integration) → store summaries
4. **Visualize**: Update view to show summaries
5. **Cross-reference**: Create worker to watch local files → transform and store in keepsync
6. **Join**: Create worker to listen to multiple keepsync stores → perform joins → store results
7. **Visualize**: Create view showing cross-referenced summaries

This creates **flows of data and visualizations over the flows** - an iterative process where the workspace grows organically through cycles of ingestion, transformation, and visualization.

## Agent Guidelines

**File Format Handling**: If a file format isn't currently handled, guide the user to:
1. Create a worker using `tonk create`
2. Vibecode the worker to parse the file format (suggest specific parsing libraries)
3. Store parsed data in keepsync
4. Create a view to visualize the data

**Scaffolding Process**: When running `tonk create`, help users navigate the interactive CLI:
- Select component type (worker/view)
- Choose meaningful names based on stated goals
- Provide context-aware suggestions during the flow

## File Listening Pattern - IMPORTANT

When implementing file watching functionality, **ALWAYS use the existing FileListener pattern** from `src/listeners/fileListener.ts`. Do NOT create custom file watcher services.

### Proper FileListener Usage:

1. **Import the FileListener**: Use `import { FileListener, createAndStartFileListener } from "./listeners/fileListener";`

2. **Define your data transformation**: Create a transformer function that converts file content to your desired format

3. **Define path transformation**: Create a function that maps file paths to keepsync document paths  

4. **Define data mapper**: Create a mapper function that handles how the transformed data gets written to keepsync

5. **Use the pattern**: Initialize the FileListener with your configuration

### Example Implementation:
```typescript
import { createAndStartFileListener } from "./listeners/fileListener";
import { TopicsDocument, Topic } from "./services/obsidianParser";

// In your main initialization:
const fileListener = await createAndStartFileListener(
  '/path/to/obsidian/file.md',
