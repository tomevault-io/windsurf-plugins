## Build & Test

```bash
go build -o gig ./cmd/gig/                       # Build binary
go test ./...                                      # SDK unit tests
go test -tags=e2e -v -count=1 ./cmd/gig/           # E2E CLI tests
go vet ./...                                       # Static analysis
```

## Conventions

- **SDK-first**: All logic in root package. CLI (`cmd/gig/`) is a thin cobra wrapper. Never put business logic in `cmd/`.
- **Module path**: `github.com/NeerajG03/gig` — must match GitHub repo URL.
- All public SDK functions return `(*Type, error)` or `error`.
- Use `UpdateParams` with pointer fields (nil = don't change) for partial updates.
- `GIG_HOME` env var overrides `~/.gig/` as the central storage location.
- Error wrapping: `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`. Never swallow errors.
- Parameterized SQL: all queries use `?` placeholders. Never `fmt.Sprintf` for SQL.
- Tests use `tempDB(t)` helper for isolated in-memory stores.

## Status Model

```
open → in_progress → closed
  ↓         ↓          ↓
blocked   cancelled   (reopen → open)
  ↓
  (auto-unblock → open when all blockers terminal)
```

- **`IsTerminal()`**: returns true for `closed` and `cancelled`. Always use this instead of `== StatusClosed`.
- **Auto-unblock**: closing/cancelling a task auto-transitions `blocked` dependents to `open` if all their blockers are terminal.
- **`Ready(parentID)`**: returns only `open` tasks with no unresolved blockers. `in_progress` = already claimed, not "ready".
- **Icons**: `[ ]` open, `[>]` in_progress, `[!]` blocked, `[~]` deferred, `[x]` closed, `[-]` cancelled.

## What NOT to Do

- Don't add CGO dependencies — pure-Go SQLite is intentional.
- Don't put business logic in `cmd/gig/`.
- Don't scan `time.Time` directly from SQLite — scan as string, parse with `strToTime()`.
- Don't check `== StatusClosed` — use `IsTerminal()`.
- Don't break JSONL format without a major version bump.
- Don't remove columns from migrations — only add.
- Don't re-tag released versions — Go module proxy caches checksums.

## Key Types

- **Checkpoints** vs **Comments**: Checkpoints are structured snapshots (done, decisions, next, blockers, files) in their own table. Comments are freeform. `gig show` displays latest checkpoint.
- **Custom attributes**: Two-layer — definitions registry (key + type) → per-task values. Types: string, boolean, object.
- **Events**: Every mutation auto-records an event. DB write → event insert → SDK callbacks → shell hooks.

## JEFF Integration

gig is the state layer for [JEFF](https://github.com/NeerajG03/JEFF). JEFF imports gig as a Go SDK — never shells out to CLI. JEFF defines custom attrs: `repos` (object) and `worktree_setup` (string).
