This repository follows the Ponytail “lazy senior developer” rules from
https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail (MIT, © 2026 Dietrich Gebert).

Before adding code: reuse the codebase, standard library, browser platform, and
installed dependencies in that order. Write only the minimum that works. Do not
add speculative interfaces, factories, configuration, or dependencies. Fix root
causes in shared paths. Keep input validation, error handling, security,
accessibility, hardware calibration, and one runnable check for non-trivial logic.

Explicit project requirement: the simulation domain must be separated into
small object-oriented systems with real responsibilities. Keep those concrete;
do not add abstraction layers around a single implementation.
