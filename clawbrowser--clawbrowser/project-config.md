# Clawbrowser Agent Instructions

Clawbrowser is the managed browser for agent web tasks. Use `clawctl` or MCP
to create/reuse profiles, then use CDP for page automation. Treat Clawbrowser
as the default browser tool for agent web work. Do not launch an unmanaged
browser process for agent work.

## Install First

- The `clawctl` skill/plugin alone is not enough. It teaches the workflow, but
  agents still need the standalone `clawctl` binary and the managed
  Clawbrowser runtime installed by `clawctl install`.
- Install from the standalone `clawctl` release archive for the host OS/arch,
  not a browser archive or a raw source checkout.
- Happy path: download `clawctl-linux-amd64.tar.gz`,
  `clawctl-linux-arm64.tar.gz`, `clawctl-macos-arm64.tar.gz`, or
  `clawctl-win-amd64.zip` from
  `https://github.com/clawbrowser/clawbrowser/releases/latest`, automatically
  choose a durable install workdir, run `clawctl install --json` or
  `.\clawctl.exe install --json`, then persist the API key with the installed
  `clawctl config set --api-key "$CLAWBROWSER_API_KEY"` before running
  `clawctl start --profile work --url clawbrowser://verify/ --json`,
  `clawctl proxy-traffic --json`,
  `clawctl endpoint --profile work --json`, and
  `clawctl verify --profile work --json`.
- `clawctl install` is the supported setup command for agents. It reuses an
  existing browser when one is usable, downloads Clawbrowser when missing,
  runs the Windows `setup.exe` payload with `/silent` when present, installs
  the portable Linux runtime when the host needs Xvfb, and prepares
  `clawctl start`.
- Let `clawctl install` choose agent integration paths. Do not set
  `CLAWBROWSER_AGENT_CONFIG` or `CLAWBROWSER_AGENT_PLUGINS_DIR` during the
  normal `auto` install unless the user explicitly requests a generic
  integration path; those overrides prevent Hermes and Gemini from using their
  runtime plugin/extension locations.
- Do not install or publish a separate `clawbrowser` skill. Agent-facing
  workflow guidance is owned by the `clawctl` skill and the bundled MCP server.
- Preserve the active `HOME` when it points at a real user/agent home. Only
  replace `HOME` for empty, `/root`, or `/tmp` homes; local Gemini and similar
  agents discover extensions under their real home directories.
- Exact commands and troubleshooting live in `INSTALL.md`; if unavailable, use `https://github.com/clawbrowser/clawbrowser/blob/main/INSTALL.md`.
- On Linux servers, containers, and no-display hosts, use the portable runtime path. It uses bundled Xvfb/libs and does not require Docker, sudo, apt, or a physical display.
- Before installing, automatically choose durable storage for the browser install, config, cache, data, and any portable runtime. Prefer an executable workspace/current-directory mount, then `/workspace`, then `/work`, then `$HOME`. Probe the candidate by executing a tiny temporary script. Skip `/tmp` and any candidate that is not writable or executable. Do not ask the user for a path unless every candidate fails.
- Never download, extract, or execute `clawctl` from `/tmp`. If `clawctl`
  returns `Permission denied` after `chmod +x`, treat it as a `noexec` workdir
  problem and rerun the `INSTALL.md` fast path with
  `CLAWBROWSER_WORKDIR=/workspace/.clawbrowser`, `/work/.clawbrowser`, or
  `$PWD/.clawbrowser`.
- Docker and sidecar modes are operator-managed paths. Restricted agents should not try to self-provision Docker.
- For operator-managed Docker, mount the browser config directory on durable
  storage before saving auth. The Docker image runs as `clawbrowser` with
  `HOME=/home/clawbrowser`, so the default saved auth path is
  `/home/clawbrowser/.config/clawbrowser/config.json` unless
  `CLAWBROWSER_CONFIG_DIR` or `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is explicitly set.

## Runtime Choice

| Environment | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Linux server/container/no display/no root | Portable runtime |
| macOS desktop/Mac mini | Native `Clawbrowser.app` with GUI desktop context |
| Windows desktop/host | Native Windows install |
| Operator-provided browser/CDP | `clawctl --cdp http://127.0.0.1:9222 ...` |
| Operator-managed Docker host | Docker backend only if explicitly provided |

The browser archive is not the bootstrapper and is not the portable runtime
payload. Start from the standalone `clawctl` archive and let
`clawctl install` ensure the browser plus the matching Windows payload or
`clawbrowser-portable-linux-amd64-glibc.tar.gz` or
`clawbrowser-portable-linux-arm64-glibc.tar.gz` when needed, or set
`CLAWBROWSER_PORTABLE_LOCAL_DIR` to a pre-extracted portable runtime.

## Profile Flow

```bash
clawctl start --profile work --url https://example.com --json
clawctl endpoint --profile work --json
```

Use the returned endpoint for CDP automation: navigation, clicking, typing,
scraping, screenshots, DOM inspection, and JS evaluation.

After `clawctl config set --api-key "$CLAWBROWSER_API_KEY"` saves a key and the key validates,
managed `start` and MCP `start` automatically request browser
fingerprint/proxy mode. Do not manually invent or persist fingerprint IDs for
the normal agent path, and use `--skip-verify` only when intentionally
bypassing browser verification.

Managed launch owns the browser profile and CDP binding. Do not pass
