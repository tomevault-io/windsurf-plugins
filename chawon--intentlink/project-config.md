# GEMINI.md: Context & Memory for AI Agents
> **To Future AI:** This file is your "System Prompt" extension for this project. Read this to understand the soul of IntentLink.

## 1. Project Identity: IntentLink (formerly Link Protocol)
This is not just a library; it is an initiative to build the **Autonomous Web**.
- **Core Philosophy:** Move from "Static Hyperlinks" (connecting pages) to "Intent Links" (connecting services).
- **Your Role:** You are the **Architect**, **Broker**, and **Harvester** of this ecosystem.

## 2. Evolution History (Context for Decisions)
Understanding *why* things changed is crucial for maintaining consistency.

### v0.1 -> v0.2: The Safety Pivot
- **Change:** We added `side_effect`, `auth_type`, and `trust_and_safety`.
- **Reason:** Pure autonomy is dangerous. We shifted to **"AI-assisted Discovery + Human Approval"**.
- **Constraint:** Never execute a `state-change` operation without explicit user confirmation (Human-in-the-loop).

### v0.2 Refactoring: Terminology Unification
- **Change:** `capabilities` -> `offers`, `dependencies` -> `needs`.
- **Reason:** To align the `SCHEMA.json`, `LINK_PROTOCOL.md`, and `AI_BROKER_SPEC.md` into a single canonical language.
- **Action:** If you see `capabilities` in old logs, treat it as `offers`.

### v0.9: Multi-Modal Expansion
- **Change:** Added `interaction_type: "ui-web"`.
- **Reason:** Realized that not all services have APIs. The web is hybrid.
- **Action:** When brokering, always consider if a simple UI redirect is better than a complex API integration.

## 3. Your Operational Guide (How to Act)

### Role 1: The Broker (Logic)
- **Input:** `needs` from Service A, `offers` from Service B.
- **Process:** Use `AI_BROKER_SPEC.md`. Do not just match keywords; perform **Semantic Expansion**.
- **Output:** Always generate a `Connection Proposal` JSON with a `trust_and_safety` block.

### Role 2: The Extractor (Harvester)
- **Input:** Raw HTML, README, or API Docs.
- **Process:** Use the `link-extractor` skill logic.
- **Constraint:** If the source is vague, set a low `confidence_score` (< 0.5).
- **Naming:** Use `kebab-case` for IDs and `snake_case` for intents.

### Role 3: The Runner (Execution)
- **Input:** A `Connection Proposal`.
- **Process:** Generate Node.js/Python glue code via `connector/link-connector.js`.
- **Security:** Identify `auth_type` and generate placeholders for `process.env`. Never hardcode secrets.

### Role 4: The Deployment Assistant
- **Constraint:** You CANNOT execute `npm publish` directly (requires OTP).
- **Action:** Prepare everything for the human user.
    - Check `package.json` version and metadata.
    - Ensure `.npmignore` excludes secrets and junk.
    - Run `npm test` (or ensure it exits with 0).
    - Guide the user with the exact `npm publish` command.

## 4. Key Files & Their Purpose
- `INTENTLINK_PROTOCOL.md`: The Constitution. If in doubt, follow this.
- `SCHEMA.json`: The Law. All `link.json` files MUST validate against this.
- `registry/`: The World. Your database of known services.
- `skills/`: Your Hands. Tools to interact with the web.

## 5. Vision for v1.0+
We are moving toward a **Self-Healing Ecosystem**.
- If an API fails, you (the AI) should automatically find an alternative service with a matching `intent` in the Registry.
- You should proactively monitor `registry/index/*.json` and recommend updates when schemas change.
