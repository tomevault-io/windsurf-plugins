## Project Purpose

HarnessBench is a benchmark for comparing coding-agent harnesses on
real-repository debugging tasks.

Full title:

```text
HarnessBench: Comparing Coding Agent Harnesses on Real-Repository Debugging Tasks
```

The project stores benchmark specifications, case definitions, hidden tests,
runner scripts, condition configs, rate cards, and generated experiment
reports.

## Operating Rules

- Do not commit `benchmark/runs/`, `benchmark/workspaces/`, or
  `benchmark/archive/`.
- Preserve raw harness logs. Parser fixes should re-normalize existing logs
  rather than rerunning expensive jobs when possible.
- Use `rg` for search when available.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Avoid destructive git commands.
- If a run fails because of infrastructure, mark the `result.json` with:

```json
{
  "invalid_run": true,
  "invalid_reason": "infrastructure failure: ..."
}
```

Invalid runs are preserved for auditability but excluded from success-rate
summaries.

## Publishing Experiment Artifacts

Publish official benchmark artifacts, but do not publish raw run data by
default.

Keep these local-only:

- `benchmark/runs/`
- `benchmark/workspaces/`
- `benchmark/archive/`
- `benchmark/cache/`

These directories can contain raw harness logs, cloned repositories,
workspaces, provider-specific session details, and local filesystem paths.
Preserve them locally for auditability and re-normalization, but do not commit
them.

For an official experiment, publish only the curated artifact directory under
`benchmark/experiments/<experiment-id>/` when it contains report-level files
such as:

- `summary.json`
- `manifest.json`
- `failure-reviews.json`
- `results.html`

Before committing an experiment artifact:

1. Confirm the artifact size is reasonable:

```bash
du -sh benchmark/experiments/<experiment-id>
```

2. Remove local absolute paths from public artifacts. Replace repository paths
   with `<repo>` and home-directory paths with `<home>`:

```bash
perl -0pi -e 's#/home/sakasegawa/src/github.com/nyosegawa/harness-debug-benchmark#<repo>#g; s#/home/sakasegawa#<home>#g' \
  benchmark/experiments/<experiment-id>/summary.json \
  benchmark/experiments/<experiment-id>/manifest.json \
  benchmark/experiments/<experiment-id>/failure-reviews.json \
  benchmark/experiments/<experiment-id>/results.html
```

3. Validate JSON artifacts:

```bash
node -e "for (const f of ['summary.json','manifest.json','failure-reviews.json']) JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('benchmark/experiments/<experiment-id>/'+f,'utf8')); console.log('json ok')"
```

4. Scan for local paths and common secret patterns:

```bash
rg -n "(/home/sakasegawa|sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}|xox[baprs]-|ghp_|github_pat_|ANTHROPIC_API_KEY|OPENAI_API_KEY|CURSOR_API_KEY|Authorization: Bearer [A-Za-z0-9._-]{20,})" \
  benchmark/experiments/<experiment-id> || true
```

5. Keep `.gitignore` broad, and unignore only the specific official experiment
   files intended for publication. Do not unignore `benchmark/runs/`,
   `benchmark/workspaces/`, or `benchmark/archive/`.

6. Run the basic script checks before pushing:

```bash
node --check scripts/render-results.mjs
node --check scripts/run-case.mjs
```

## Architecture Decision Records

Use `docs/adr/` for material benchmark design decisions. Add or update an ADR
when changing or rejecting decisions that affect:

- execution substrate or isolation model
- scoring semantics or case schema
- official matrix conditions
- report methodology or statistical interpretation
- artifact retention, regrading, or reproducibility policy

ADRs use YAML frontmatter plus Markdown sections. Prefer a short, append-only
record with `Context`, `Decision`, `Consequences`, `Alternatives Considered`,
and `Follow-Up`. Supersede old decisions with a new ADR instead of rewriting
history. Link relevant specs or runner docs to the ADR.

## Scoring Model

HarnessBench uses two scoring layers:

- `core_tests`: behavioral bug-fix contract. All must pass.
- `regression_tests`: targeted surrounding behavior. All must pass.

Official cases should use:

```yaml
test_strategy:
  core_tests:
    - benchmark/cases/<repo>/hidden-tests/<difficulty>/core.sh
  regression_tests:
    - benchmark/cases/<repo>/hidden-tests/<difficulty>/regression.sh
  success_rule: core_and_regression
```

Core tests define the required user-visible behavior as a behavioral contract.
Regression tests protect nearby behavior that should remain unchanged.

## Runtime Setup

The current environment has:

- Node.js under `~/.local/opt/node-v22.21.1-linux-*/`
- `~/.local/bin` and `~/.cargo/bin` on the shell path
- Rust via `~/.cargo/bin`

For non-interactive commands:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Basic checks:

```bash
node --version
cargo --version
node --check scripts/run-case.mjs
node --check scripts/run-matrix.mjs
node --check scripts/resume-agent-matrix.mjs
node --check scripts/render-results.mjs
node --check scripts/render-experiment-index.mjs
node --check scripts/review-failed-runs.mjs
node --check scripts/regrade-agent-results.mjs
node --check scripts/apply-rate-card.mjs
node --check scripts/refresh-result-metrics.mjs
```
