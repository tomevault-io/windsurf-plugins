# Context for Claude Code sessions

Hard-won knowledge from prior sessions. Read these before you ship anything.

## Before every push: run the full CI parity set

CI failed four times on a single PR because each push verified a different subset of what CI actually runs. The full command set lives in [`docs/ci-parity.md`](docs/ci-parity.md) — run it before every push, not a subset.

Common traps documented there (each cost one CI cycle):
- `-p vortix --lib` skips test code; `clippy::pedantic` is workspace-wide so test code gets pedantic lints too
- macOS host cannot validate Linux-cfg code paths (`vortix_platform_linux/*`, `daemon/server.rs` SO_PEERCRED block) and vice versa
- `cargo clippy` does NOT run rustdoc lints — only `RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` exercises them
- `cargo fmt` (without `--all`) skips workspace members on rustfmt diffs

"Passes locally" is a claim that requires the full command output, not a verbal assertion.

## Architectural boundaries are enforced by xtask, not just convention

- `vortix_core/` must not import from `vortix_platform_*`, `vortix_protocol_*`, or the process layer
- `vortix_platform_*` must not import from `vortix_protocol_*` and vice versa
- Subprocess invocations of protocol binaries (`wg`, `wg-quick`, `openvpn`) belong in `vortix_protocol_*` only — anywhere else needs a `// xtask:allow-protocol-leak: <reason>` annotation

The three `cargo xtask check-*-leak` commands enforce this in CI. If you're tempted to add an import that crosses a boundary, stop and ask whether the abstraction should move instead.

## TUI density principle

User's explicit guidance from session memory: density via signaling, not duplication. Never auto-add UI panels per entity. When you add a TUI feature:
- Single-line summary signals beat multi-line panels
- Multi-tunnel views fit in the existing 6-row dashboard layout via overflow ladders, not new panels
- See `docs/manual-testing/multi-connection.md` for what "fits cleanly at 80×24" means in practice

## Manual testing convention

Automated tests cover FSM, parsers, CIDR math, JSON shapes, render builders. They cannot cover real kernels, real `wg-quick`/`openvpn` subprocesses, real terminals, real adversaries. Manual scenarios live in [`docs/manual-testing/backlog.md`](docs/manual-testing/backlog.md) — one table of rows ordered by risk. When you ship a feature with observable runtime behavior, add a row that names the scenario, the setup, and the pass/fail signal.

## Multi-tunnel: registry is the truth

The App layer's single source of truth for active VPN state is `App.registry: TunnelRegistry<TunnelKind>`. Every panel renderer (header, sidebar, Connection Details, Security Guard, footer) reads from `app.registry.snapshot_all` / `app.registry.snapshot(profile_id)` exclusively.

The legacy `ConnectionState` enum still exists in `crates/vortix/src/vpn_runtime/connection_state.rs` and is re-exported from `vpn_runtime`, but only as: (a) the CLI's blocking helpers' local single-tunnel view (one process, one tunnel), and (b) the return type of `App::legacy_state()` — a derived view from the registry primary for the few residual single-tunnel-shaped reads (kill-switch sync, delete-safety, scanner dispatch).

There is **no** `connection_state` field on `VpnRuntime`. Don't add one. Multi-tunnel-aware code reads registry snapshots; single-tunnel-shaped code calls `App::legacy_state()` and matches on the variant.

## Kill switch semantics

One vocabulary, used identically on every surface — CLI input verb, CLI output, TUI panels, JSON envelope, log lines. Rust enum variants (`Off` / `Auto` / `AlwaysOn`) stay idiomatic for the language but never leak into output. The bridge between the enum and every user-visible string is the helper set on `vortix_core::state::killswitch` — `KillSwitchMode::display_name` (display), `cli_verb` / `from_cli_verb` (input parsing), `one_liner`, `behavior_lines`, and `KillSwitchState::display_status`.

| Rust enum    | Slug (CLI verb + display) | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Off`        | **`off`**                 | No firewall rules. All traffic flows; real IP exposed if VPN drops.                                                                                                                                           |
| `Auto`       | **`block-on-drop`**       | Armed while a VPN is up; engages default-DROP egress only on an unexpected drop.                                                                                                                              |
