# AGENTS.md — pi-workflow-engine

Guidance for working in this repo. Read the "Critical non-obvious facts" before editing.

## What this repo is

A **pi extension** with canonical entrypoint `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/index.ts` that adds a multi-agent **workflow engine**: workflows authored in TypeScript fan out to many subagents, pass validated structured data between stages, and synthesise a result. Distributed as a pi package — install with `pi install git:github.com/timbrinded/pi-workflow-engine`.

## What pi is

`pi` is a terminal coding agent (CLI/TUI) by Earendil Inc., shipped as the npm package `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` and run via bun. Open and extensible. The bundled binary embeds its sibling packages: `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (models/providers), `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core` (the agent loop), `@earendil-works/pi-tui` (terminal UI), and `typebox` (schemas). Docs: https://pi.dev/docs/latest — key pages: `extensions`, `sdk`, `packages`.

## What a pi extension / package is

- **Extension**: a TypeScript module loaded at startup via [jiti] (no build step). It default-exports a factory `export default function (pi: ExtensionAPI) { ... }` that can `pi.registerTool(...)`, `pi.registerCommand(name, ...)`, subscribe to lifecycle events via `pi.on(...)`, and drive the TUI via `ctx.ui`. The SDK's `createAgentSession(...)` lets an extension spawn its own in-process agent sessions — this engine is built on that.
- **Package**: a repo whose `package.json` has a `"pi"` manifest declaring resources (`extensions`, `skills`, `prompts`, `themes`). Installed with `pi install <source>`; git sources pin to a ref. Include `keywords: ["pi-package"]` for the pi.dev gallery.

## What this extension does

`.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/index.ts` registers five surfaces:
- `/workflow <name> [args]` — slash command to run a saved workflow.
- `/workflow:inspector [last]` — opens the live or most recently completed workflow inspector.
- `/workflow:results` — reopens the most recent code-review findings without rerunning the workflow.
- `/workflow:dynamax on|off|status` plus the literal `dynamax` token — opt-in signals for host-agent workflow orchestration.
- a `workflow` tool — lets the host agent run a saved workflow by `name` or a one-off inline workflow by `script` mid-conversation.

A **workflow** (`.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/workflows/*.ts`) exports `meta` + a default `async (api) => result`. The injected `api`:
- `agent(prompt, { schema?, profile?, model?, thinkingLevel?, tools?, label?, phase? })` — runs one subagent; with a typebox `schema` it returns validated structured data, else final text.
- `parallel(thunks)` — concurrent barrier; recoverable failures become `null` slots and survivors continue.
- `pipeline(items, ...stages)` — each item through all stages independently; recoverable item failures become `null`, with no barrier between stages.
- `phase(title)` / `log(msg)` — drive the live progress tree.

Example: `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/workflows/code-review.ts` — Scope → per-angle Find → independent Verify → Synthesize.

## Architecture / key files

- `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/index.ts` — canonical pi extension entry; registers workflow commands and shortcuts, the `workflow` tool, and result rendering.
- `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/src/agent-runner.ts` — **the bridge**. Each `agent()` is an in-process `createAgentSession(... SessionManager.inMemory())`. Structured output = one **terminating tool** whose `parameters` IS the schema; pi validates the call, `execute` captures the args in a closure, `terminate: true` ends the turn. No event parsing.
- `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/src/concurrency.ts` — `Semaphore` (the single global concurrency cap, acquired inside every `agent()`), `parallel`, `pipeline`.
- `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/src/engine.ts` — `runWorkflow()` binds the primitives to one run (shared semaphore + progress tracker). `DEFAULT_CONCURRENCY` lives here.
- `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/src/progress.ts` — live phase/agent tree via `ctx.ui.setWidget`; stderr breadcrumbs when headless.
- `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/src/discovery.ts` + `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/src/workflows.ts` — static registry (`BUILTIN_WORKFLOWS`) plus best-effort dynamic drop-in loading.
- `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/src/inline-workflow.ts` — inline workflow compiler (`script` string → `WorkflowModule`) with pure-literal `export const meta` extraction and injected Type schemas.
- `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/src/dynamax.ts` — `dynamax` trigger/sticky state and reminder injection.
- `.pi/extensions/pi-workflow-engine/src/types.ts` — `WorkflowApi` / `WorkflowModule` / `AgentOptions` contracts.

## Critical non-obvious facts (read before editing)

- **Core deps belong in `peerDependencies: "*"`, not `dependencies`/`devDependencies`.** pi bundles `@earendil-works/{pi-ai,pi-agent-core,pi-coding-agent,pi-tui}` and `typebox`. Local `node_modules` copies exist only so TypeScript 7 (`tsc`) has types.
