# Spine — working on this repo

Guidance for agents/humans **building on** this codebase. For *using* Spine from Claude
Code see [CLAUDE_GUIDE.md](CLAUDE_GUIDE.md); for PR/branch mechanics and the quality gate
see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); for deploy/env see [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md).

**Naming:** the product is **Spine**; the package, import, and CLI stay `orchestrator`
(PyPI: `synaptixs-spine`). Use "Spine" in docs and prose, `orchestrator` in commands.

The knowledge base `understand` writes is **`episteme/`** (was `memory-bank/`) — knowledge
grounded in evidence vs *doxa*, opinion. The same brand/identifier split applies: the
*directory* is `episteme`, but the published identifiers keep their names —
`read_memory_bank` (MCP), `GET /v1/capabilities/memory-bank`, `ORCHESTRATOR_MEMORY_BANK_DIR`,
`memory_bank_dir()`, and the `memory-bank/` SDLC artifact-key prefix. Don't rename those
casually; they're contracts. Get the dir from `understand.BANK_DIRNAME` /
`memory_bank_dir()` (writes) or `existing_bank_dir()` (reads — falls back to a legacy
`memory-bank/`), never a literal.

## Layout — where things live

| Package | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `pkg/` | The **PKG** (Product Knowledge Graph) — the source of truth. `facts.py` = the universal vocabulary (`NodeKind`/`EdgeKind`/`Node`/`Edge`/`FactBatch` — includes the `Doc` node + `MENTIONS` edge from doc ingestion); `extractor.py` dispatches per-suffix to language front-ends; `store.py` = query layer (incl. `docs_for`/`mentions_of`); `docs.py` = the deterministic doc→symbol binder, `doc_source.py` reads docs (md/rst/txt/PDF, section-split), `doc_link.py` = the `link_docs` post-pass (Doc nodes + MENTIONS) + drift; `overview.py` = bounded view for UIs; `persistence.py` = commit-keyed cache; `export.py`/`rdf.py` = projections |
| `knowledge/` | Synthesis **on top of** the PKG — `understand.py` (→ `episteme/*.md`), `current_state.py` (`state`, two lenses, incl. the Documentation section; runs `link_docs` as a post-pass), `renderers.py` |
| `registry/` | FastAPI service + the operator web UI (`registry/api/web/`) |
| `sdlc/` | The feature/run pipeline (largest package) |
| `catalog/`, `intake/`, `agentic/`, `personas/`, `evals/` | profiling, sources→intents, the codegen tool-use loop, personas, measurement |
| `cli/` | Every command surface — one module per help panel, `sdlc.py` and `pkg.py` on their own; `_app.py` holds the root app and panels, `_common.py` the shared helpers |

Design records live in **`docs/specs/`** — read the relevant spec before changing a
subsystem; that's where the *why* is. `docs/specs/README.md` indexes them.

They are **tracked on purpose.** `understand` ingests markdown from disk whether or not git
tracks it, so a docs tree that exists locally but not in the repo makes your `episteme/`
describe `Doc` nodes CI can't see — and `understand --check` fails on a diff you can't
reproduce. Committed docs are in CI's checkout too, so local and CI agree by construction.
Keep new design records in here rather than in an untracked scratch directory.

## Invariants — break these and things get subtly wrong

1. **The PKG is the source of truth.** Comprehension surfaces *render* facts; they never
   re-derive them from paths or filenames. If you need a new fact, extend `facts.py` and
   the front-ends — not the renderer.
2. **`understand` / `state` are deterministic and no-LLM.** Same code in → same output out.
   That property is why they're trusted. Never introduce an LLM call, randomness, or a
   timestamp into these paths.
3. **Layout is computed, seeded, in Python.** Any visual surface precomputes positions
   deterministically — *never* a random/force layout. Animate the reveal, never the layout
   or the data. A picture that redraws differently for an identical commit can't be diffed.
4. **The web UI has no build step.** Vanilla JS, zero npm, no `node_modules`, no template
   engine — deliberate (see the preamble of `registry/api/web/shell.py`). CSS/JS are real
   files under `web/static/`, served at `/static`. Don't add a bundler or a d3/cytoscape
   class of dependency.
5. **Shared artifacts must be self-contained.** Anything meant to leave the building
   (reports, exports) inlines its CSS/SVG and fetches nothing. `page_shell()` links
   `/static`, so a saved copy of a served page loses its styling — that's a report you
   can't email.
6. **Group by owning module, never by symbol id.** A node's component is its owning
   module's name/path, resolved by walking `CONTAINS` upward (fall back to
   `provenance.file`). C/C++ ids are symbols (`cpp:HSL2RGB`), not locations — id-grouping
   makes every function its own component and floods any layout. See `_area_of` in
   `knowledge/current_state.py`.
7. **Bound honestly.** Aggregations cap their output and record what was elided (see
   `build_overview`'s `truncated{}`). Say "top N of M"; never let a clipped view imply
   completeness.
8. **Caches are commit-keyed and only trusted on a clean tree** (`pkg/persistence.py`).

## Gotchas that have bitten

- **`md.js` renders mermaid, but only a tiny subset** — `mermaidSvg()` (a ~90-line
  hand-rolled renderer, chosen over a 2.6 MB library because the UI has no build step and
