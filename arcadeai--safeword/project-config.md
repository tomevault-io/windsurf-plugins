# Phase 7: Done Gate

**Entry:** All scenarios marked `[x]` in test-definitions

## Step 1: Cross-Scenario Refactoring

Run `/refactor` across all files changed in this ticket:

```bash
git diff main --name-only
```

Look for cross-scenario patterns:

- Duplicate setup → shared fixture
- Similar assertions → custom matcher
- Copy-pasted logic → shared module

Only refactor if clear wins exist.

## Step 2: Flake Detection (if flakes suspected)

```bash
for i in {1..3}; do bun test || echo "FLAKE on run $i"; done
```

## Step 3: Run /verify

Tests, build, lint, scenarios, dep drift. Generates evidence.

## Step 4: Run /audit

Architecture, dead code, duplication. Generates audit evidence.

**Both `/verify` and `/audit` evidence required** — stop hook validates all three patterns.

## Step 5: BDD Compliance Self-Check

Review your work against BDD phases. Fill in specifics:

```
## BDD Compliance Check
- [ ] Phases 0-2: Discovery — [what]
- [ ] Phase 3: Scenarios — [N in Given/When/Then]
- [ ] Phase 4: Validated with user — [how]
- [ ] Phase 5: Decomposed — [N tasks]
- [ ] Phase 6: RED→GREEN→REFACTOR — [N scenarios, N commits]
- [ ] Phase 7: Refactor→Verify→Audit — [results]
- [ ] Phase transitions committed before each phase
```

## Step 6: Parent Epic

If ticket has `parent:` field:

1. Add completion entry to parent's work log
2. If all `children:` done → update parent `status: done`

## Step 7: Final Commit

1. Update ticket: `phase: done`, `status: done`
2. Commit: `feat(scope): [summary]`
