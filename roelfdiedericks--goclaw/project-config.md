# Ground Rules for GoClaw Development

**These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Follow them at ALL times, without exception.**

---

## THINK BEFORE CODING

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## DISCUSS BEFORE IMPLEMENTING

**Always discuss proposed changes before making them.**

When a problem is identified:
1. Explain the issue
2. Propose options/solutions
3. **Wait for approval** before writing any code

DO NOT:
- Start implementing a fix immediately after identifying a problem
- Assume a solution is acceptable without asking
- Make "obvious" changes without confirmation

The user decides what approach to take. Your job is to present options, not make decisions.

Whenever you output the text "Let me start." or something similar STOP! Do not proceed until given permission.

## FORBIDDEN TOOLS

Do not use rsync for anything, or ssh. You're not allowed.

## Manager patterns
We like global singletons, for manager patterns */manager.go must be a singleton, passing references  around is just silly for things that have one global use and instance requirement, if we are the only people eating our own dogfood. This is not a library, this is an application.

## Command patterns
When adding "/commands" and other things remember that we have global infrastructure to handle this, do NOT add stuff to the channels such as http and telegram bot. Use the global command pattern

## Logging - USE THE RIGHT FUNCTIONS

**ONLY use the logging functions from `internal/logging`:**

```go
import . "github.com/roelfdiedericks/goclaw/internal/logging"

// Use these:
L_trace("message", "key", value)
L_debug("message", "key", value)
L_info("message", "key", value)
L_warn("message", "key", value)
L_error("message", "key", value)
```

**DO NOT:**
- Import `"github.com/charmbracelet/log"` directly
- Import standard `"log"` package
- Use `log.Debug()`, `log.Info()`, etc.
- Use `fmt.Println()` for logging

**Log Level Guidelines:**
- `L_info` - Summary information (totals, counts, status changes)
- `L_warn` - Specific failures WITH context (what failed and why)
- `L_debug` - Per-item details (only visible with `-d` flag)
- `L_trace` - Very verbose (only visible with `-t` flag)

**Example - Good logging:**
```go
// INFO: Summary only
L_info("skills: loaded", "total", 55, "failed", 2)

// WARN: Each failure with details
L_warn("skills: failed to load", "skill", "foo", "error", err)

// DEBUG: Per-item details
L_debug("skills: ineligible", "skill", "bar", "reason", "binary: mytool")
```

## Git Commands - RESTRICTED

**You are NOT allowed to run any git commands except `git log, status or diff`.**

Forbidden commands include but are not limited to:
- `git restore` - DO NOT USE, this wipes uncommitted work
- `git checkout`
- `git reset`
- `git clean`
- `git stash`
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git merge`
- `git rebase`


The user will handle all git operations manually.

## Testing

- **DO NOT run `goclaw gateway` or `make run/debug/tui`** - the user will test manually
- Running the gateway could interfere with existing instances

## Use the Makefile

**ALWAYS use Makefile targets instead of running tools directly.**

```bash
# CORRECT
make build
make lint
make audit
make test

# WRONG - do not run tools directly
go build ./...
golangci-lint run ./...
gosec ./...
go test ./...
```

The Makefile has the correct flags, environment variables, and configuration. Running tools directly bypasses this and causes problems.

Do not run "make lint" or do lintian checks when busy with todo items. Do it after a major run of coding, at the end.
Linting wastes time and tokens between each todo item. A simple "make build" is good enough.

## Why These Rules Exist

**Git:** On 2026-02-02, a `git restore` command wiped out an entire day's worth of uncommitted work including all files in `internal/skills/`. This happened because the assistant panicked and ran `git restore` without understanding the situation. **Never again.**

**Logging:** Using `charmbracelet/log` directly bypasses the project's log level filtering and caller info. The `L_*` functions provide consistent formatting with file:line info and proper level filtering.
