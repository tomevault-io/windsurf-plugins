description: A TypeScript library and CLI for generating, converting, and manipulating CSV and Excel spreadsheets. It provides a fluent API via `createSpreadsheet()` and `spreadsheet()` functions to generate content, store files to disk, or create download Response objects. The CLI supports creating spreadsheets from JSON input, converting between CSV and Excel formats, and validating input. The library is dependency-free, fully typed, and performant.

## About

A TypeScript library and CLI for generating, converting, and manipulating CSV and Excel spreadsheets. It provides a fluent API via `createSpreadsheet()` and `spreadsheet()` functions to generate content, store files to disk, or create download Response objects. The CLI supports creating spreadsheets from JSON input, converting between CSV and Excel formats, and validating input. The library is dependency-free, fully typed, and performant.

## Linting

- Use **pickier** for linting — never use eslint directly
- Run `bunx --bun pickier .` to lint, `bunx --bun pickier . --fix` to auto-fix
- When fixing unused variable warnings, prefer `// eslint-disable-next-line` comments over prefixing with `_`

## Frontend

- Use **stx** for templating — never write vanilla JS (`var`, `document.*`, `window.*`) in stx templates
- Use **crosswind** as the default CSS framework which enables standard Tailwind-like utility classes
- stx `<script>` tags should only contain stx-compatible code (signals, composables, directives)

## Dependencies

- **buddy-bot** handles dependency updates — not renovatebot
- **better-dx** provides shared dev tooling as peer dependencies — do not install its peers (e.g., `typescript`, `pickier`, `bun-plugin-dtsx`) separately if `better-dx` is already in `package.json`
- If `better-dx` is in `package.json`, ensure `bunfig.toml` includes `linker = "hoisted"`

## Commits

- Use conventional commit messages (e.g., `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`)
