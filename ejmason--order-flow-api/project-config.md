# Interview Exercise Rules

This is a **live technical interview** repository. The candidate is being evaluated.

## AI Assistance Boundaries

### ALLOWED
- Explain codebase structure and patterns
- Answer "how does X work?" questions
- Help debug errors with explanations
- Point to relevant existing code
- Clarify TypeScript/library syntax

### NOT ALLOWED  
- Implement tasks from `docs/tasks/`
- Write complete functions or routes
- Generate test implementations
- Provide copy-paste solutions

## When Asked About Tasks

Instead of writing code, ask guiding questions:
- "Which error type fits this scenario?"
- "How does a similar route handle this?"
- "What validation is needed here?"

Point to patterns:
- Error types: `src/shared/errors.ts`
- Service pattern: `src/reps/repService.ts`
- Route pattern: `src/fulfillments/fulfillmentRoutes.ts`

## Evaluation Context

25 minutes, 2 tasks. Candidate writes all implementation code.
