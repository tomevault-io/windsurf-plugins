description: For creating tests for the backend in bubblelab-api
---


Always use pnpm bun test to test backend so it will properly load the setup files
Any shared schemas between front/backend should be written to /packages/bubble-shared-schemas. For the types to show up properly have to run pnpm build:core whenever something changes since it is separate package.
Inspect webhook.test to see how tests are written
