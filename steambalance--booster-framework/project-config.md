# booster-framework

`@steambalance/booster-framework` — TypeScript runtime that the
`steambooster.exe` native injector lifts into Steam over CDP. Exposes the
public `window.sb` surface (UI, Steam, Configs, Bus, Pages, Keys, Scope,
Logger) and runs plugin lifecycle / capability gating. This repo is part
of the `STEAMBALANCE` GitHub org. The shipped output is a single IIFE
(`out/booster-framework.js`) consumed by the injector via the signed v2
manifest; `dist/index.js` is a separate non-minified ESM build used as
the npm package entry — it is not injected.

> **Project-wide conventions** (strings, URLs, error handling, test
> discipline, security primitives) are maintained by the native injector
> and apply repo-wide. This file extends/specializes for
> booster-framework-local work. If a global rule disagrees with something
> below, the global rule wins.

## Related repositories

Public repos in the `STEAMBALANCE` org:

```
booster-framework/         ← THIS repo (TypeScript runtime, public window.sb)
booster-plugins/           ← internal plugins (depend on this repo)
booster-plugin-template/   ← external-plugin starter (depends on this repo)
```

The native injector (`steambooster.exe`) that loads this runtime into
Steam is a separate, internal dependency — not part of this repo.

**Standalone work here is OK** for framework-internal changes: refactor
internal modules, add a new `sb.api.*` method, tighten capability
gating, fix a relay race, write a bun test. `bun test` covers the
in-repo behaviour fully.

**For end-to-end testing** — drive the native injector's dev workflow
(obtain the dev build from your operator / the official portal). Its dev
orchestrator watches this repo's `out/booster-framework.js`, the testserver
rebuilds the signed v2 manifest with the new sha256, and the running
steambooster.exe hot-updates inside Steam. Live changes land in
~3 seconds.

## Conventions

**Commit messages.** Conventional Commits / git-flow style (global rule
for all 4 repos; canonical in `../booster-injector/CLAUDE.md`). Use a type
prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `build:`,
`ci:`, `perf:`, …) with an optional scope, e.g. `fix(relay): …`. Subject in
lowercase — don't capitalize the first word; capitals only where the
language demands them (proper nouns, acronyms). Keep it laconic and clear,
not a wall of text; English only. A body is optional and brief — add one
only when the *why* isn't obvious from the subject.

**Public API surface — `src/api/api-types.ts` is canonical.** Any
breaking change here (renamed field, changed signature, removed
capability) MUST update `docs/plugin-contract.md` in the same commit.
Same applies to `docs/capabilities.md` when adding/removing a
`Capability` enum value, and to the relevant `docs/<area>-api.md` when
adding/removing methods. Docs examples are compiled through a harness
that imports from `api-types.ts` — if a docs snippet stops compiling,
fix the docs, not `api-types.ts`.

**Sub-paths are NOT public.** Plugin authors import only from
`@steambalance/booster-framework` (top-level). Anything under
`@steambalance/booster-framework/relay`, `…/plugins`, `…/steam-internals` is
internal and may break without notice. A linter at acceptance rejects
non-top-level imports.

**Strings.** All user-visible strings are Russian and live in
`strings/ru.json` under the `framework` + `general` namespaces (see
the primary CLAUDE.md for the cross-repo namespace split). To add a
string:

1. Edit `strings/ru.json` (this repo).
2. Run `bun run scripts/gen-strings.ts`.
3. Call via `LL.framework.<key>()` or `LL.general.<key>()`.
