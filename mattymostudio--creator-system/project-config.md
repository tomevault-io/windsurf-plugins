## What this directory is

A working **Personal Intelligence System** (PIS) by Matty Mo Studio. The user just downloaded this — it's their fresh vault if `[Your Name]` placeholders are still present, or their working vault if not.

**Layout:**
- `vault/` — the layered knowledge system (sources → source notes → canon → outputs). This is where their archive lives.
- `tools/` — six ingestion pipelines (photos, Google Takeout, ChatGPT export, Facebook archive, press URLs, Granola meetings).
- Top-level docs — `README.md`, `RECIPES.md`, `Standard Operating Procedure.md`, `Data Sources to Gather.md`. Reference material.

## First-session behavior — the `let's go` trigger

When the user types **`let's go`** (or asks you to start, set up, begin, or any close paraphrase):

### 1. Detect vault state

Read `vault/CLAUDE.md`. If it still contains `[Your Name]` or `[your practice description...]` placeholders, the vault is **fresh** — run the onboarding flow below.

If the placeholders have already been filled in, this is a **returning user** — instead, briefly orient yourself: read `vault/00_HOME/Log.md` for recent activity, scan `vault/01_INBOX/To Process/` for pending material, then ask what they want to work on.

### 2. Fresh-vault onboarding

Walk the user through setup conversationally. **One step at a time. No checklists. No dumps. Wait for each answer before moving on.**

**Step A — Who they are.**
Ask their name and one line about what they do (creative practice, profession, project they're known for). Use their answers to:
- Replace `[Your Name]` and the practice description in `vault/CLAUDE.md`
- Replace any `[Your Name]` placeholders in `vault/10_META/AGENTS.md`
- Update `vault/00_HOME/Personal.md` with their name and a one-line bio

**Step B — What sources they have.**
Ask what raw material is available right now. Common categories: journals, voice memos, photos with metadata, business documents (contracts, decks), press articles, meeting transcripts, social media archives, ChatGPT export.

Briefly explain trust hierarchy: **journals are ground truth · business docs are hard evidence · press is someone else's framing.** Don't lecture — just enough to set context for what they should ingest first.

**Step C — Get the first source in.**
Ask them to drop ONE file into `vault/01_INBOX/To Process/`. Easiest options:
- Most recent journal entry (single text file)
- One press article (URL, you fetch it)
- A meeting transcript (paste from Granola/Otter/Zoom)
- A bio they've used before
- An essay or memo they wrote

When the file is in place, run `/ingest` on it. Narrate what you're doing — classifying the source, deciding whether to make a source note, updating canon pages. Show them `vault/00_HOME/Log.md` afterward — that's their first entry.

**Step D — Build their first canon page.**
Pick the strongest subject from the ingested source — a person, place, project, or theme that came up clearly. Say "let's build a canon page about X" and run `/diarize "X"`. Show them the result. This is where the system clicks for most people.

**Step E — Make the hubs theirs.**
Briefly update `vault/00_HOME/Practice.md`, `Business.md`, `Personal.md` with links to whatever was just created (the canon page, the source note, the person/project). Hubs should start reflecting their actual world, not be empty scaffolding.

**Step F — Set up version control.**
If `.git` is not initialized inside this directory, run:
```bash
git init && git add -A && git commit -m "initial vault setup"
```
Tell them: this gives them an undo button for everything they do this week.

**Step G — Send them off.**
Summarize what just happened (in 2 lines). Suggest 2–3 concrete next moves:
- "Drop 3 more sources this weekend — try a press piece, a meeting transcript, and a journal entry."
- "Try `/diarize` on another subject that came up multiple times."
- "Open `RECIPES.md` for 23 step-by-step things to try."

End with: *"You're set up. Ping the cohort WhatsApp if anything breaks."*

## Ongoing behavior (after personalization)

Once `[Your Name]` placeholders are gone, treat this as the user's working personal vault. Operate per the rules in `vault/CLAUDE.md` and the constitution at `vault/10_META/AGENTS.md`.
