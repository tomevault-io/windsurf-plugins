# Darklang Monorepo

Darklang is a language, editor and infrastructure in one. This repo holds the F# runtime
(`backend/`) and the Darklang standard library and CLI, written in Darklang itself
(`packages/`).

## Start the dev container first

Everything runs inside this clone's dev container. Nothing works until it's up:

    scripts/dev/start

Safe to re-run; it's a no-op if the container is already going. The first run pulls and
builds, so expect a few minutes. It also picks this clone's host ports and prints them.

Then read `./scripts/run-cli docs for-ai` for language syntax, naming and workflow. Always
read that one.

## Several clones at once

We keep several clones checked out side by side, one per task or agent, each with its own
container. Nothing is shared between them: containers are matched to clones by directory,
each gets its own `backend/Build` volume, and each gets its own block of host ports.

`./scripts/*` all auto-enter this clone's container (see
`scripts/devcontainer/_assert-in-container`). If there's no container for the clone you're
in, they stop and tell you, rather than running in someone else's. Don't reach for
`docker exec` to work around that; run `scripts/dev/start` instead.

Scripts starting with `_` are meant to be called by other scripts. The rest are for you.

## Ports

Inside the container, 9090-9099 are reserved for ad-hoc `darklang serve`. That's the same
in every clone.

On the host, each clone gets its own block: the first clone up gets 9090-9099, the next
9100-9109, and so on. `scripts/dev/start` prints yours. To get one later:

    scripts/dev/host-port        # host port for container 9090
    scripts/dev/host-port 9091   # ...for 9091

## Builds

Builds are explicit. Edit as many files as you like, then:

    scripts/dev/build            # what's changed since the last good build
    scripts/dev/build <paths>    # just these
    scripts/dev/plan             # what that would do, without doing it
    scripts/dev/status           # did it work, and is the tree ahead of it?

`build` blocks, prints the steps it chose, and exits nonzero if any fails. Measured on
an idle machine:

    .dark change    ~34s   the whole package set reloads, not just your file
    .fs change      ~74s   39s compiling, then that same ~34s reload
    nothing changed  0.2s  compared by content, so a `touch` or a branch switch is free

Note what the second line means: half the cost of any F# change is reloading packages
that usually didn't need reloading. It's unconditional because a `.fs` change *can*
alter the serialized package format, and there's no cheap way to ask whether this one
did. Narrowing it is the biggest remaining win in the loop, and it's entangled with
`package-ref-hashes.txt`, so coordinate before starting.

The container builds once when it starts. Rebuild-on-save is available but off by
default, because a five-file change under a watcher pays for five rebuilds, four of them
on half-finished states that produce real-looking failures:

    scripts/dev/watch            # foreground, Ctrl+C to stop
    scripts/dev/watch --stop

Don't infer build state from logs. `rundir/build-state.json` records what ran, what
failed and when, and `scripts/dev/status` reads it. Everything that used to grep
`packages.log` for "Exception" now asks that file instead, which is why `run-cli` can
tell you the tree has moved on rather than silently running a stale binary.

    rundir/logs/build.log           # the last explicit build
    rundir/logs/packages.log        # .dark reload
    rundir/logs/watch.log           # a detached watcher

## Tests

    ./scripts/run-backend-tests                       all of them, a few minutes
    ./scripts/run-backend-tests --groups              the tree, with counts
    ./scripts/run-backend-tests --groups Interpreter  just that part of it
    ./scripts/run-backend-tests --find mergeFavoring  what matches, and how to run it
    ./scripts/testing/test-build-planning.py          tests of the build itself
    ./scripts/perf/gate                               reference workload, allocation vs budget
    ./scripts/perf/suite                              six workloads, allocation per iteration
    ./scripts/perf/checks                             by-hand interpreter and error-message checks

Find what you want before guessing at a filter: `--groups` and `--find` need no
database and no package reload, and print the exact command for what they found.

The one trap worth knowing here: a filter that matches nothing used to be reported as
`0 tests run - Success!` with exit 0. It fails now. `docs/unittests.md` has the rest,
including what the three filter flags actually do and why they used to disagree with
their own help text.

### Performance

Everything perf lives in `scripts/perf/` (tools) and `docs/perf/` (writing):

    docs/perf/playbook.md    how to do perf work here, and the traps. Read before starting.
    docs/perf/roadmap.md     what's worth doing next, ranked, with measured vs estimated marked
    docs/perf/history.md     the numbers round by round, and facts not worth re-deriving

    scripts/perf/gate        the CI assertion: one workload, allocation against a checked-in budget
