You are working on https://linear.app/thevibecompany/project/vibe-tuto-1a5dd4d3df0b/ project. 

When you are looking for information on the project, use Linear MCP to get the information from the project. 

A query should always have an issue linked to it. Always ask the user which issue he wants you to work on, assume it is the project if none given

If i ask you to do something that Linear could do, you should use Linear MCP to do it. 

Once a feature is complete, always look at the remaining issues and update them if needed.

Never mark an issue as done, let the PR do it. 

## Browser Automation

Use `agent-browser` for testing the localhost website. 
Never use playwright or any other library to test the localhost website. 
Never use claude chrome mcp to test the localhost website. 

ALWAYS USE THE BROWSER AUTOMATION TO TEST THE LOCALHOST WEBSITE. 

To login to the app, you can use the following credentials:

Email: admin@thevibecompany.co
Password: adminadmin

## Testing

- **Unit tests** : Vitest in `apps/web` and `apps/extension`. Run from root: `pnpm test` or `pnpm test:run`.
- **E2E localhost** : Use **agent-browser** (MCP) only. Never Playwright or Chrome MCP.

## PR Creation

When creating a PR, always upload a screenshot of all the things that you did in the PR description.

The Screenshot should be in the folder `screenshots/pr-<pr-number>/<screenshot-name>.png`

**Image URLs in PR descriptions**: Use the raw GitHub URL format, not relative paths:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Vibe-Company/vibe-tuto/<branch-name>/screenshots/pr-<number>/<image>.png
```

Always add the link to the issue in the PR description. 

## Git

- Always use `--base main` when creating PRs with `gh pr create`
- Use conventional commits for the commits and PR

## PR Comment

When asked to fix a PR, use the skill address-github-comments to address the comments. Mark all the comments as resolved when you are done with a short text explaining what you did.

## Frontend Design Guidelines

- Always use shadcn components.
- Always use tailwindcss for styling.
- Use the design system
- Always look if there are components that already exist and use them instead of creating new ones.


### Designing Pages and Components

Always use frontend-design skill and ui-ux-pro-max skill for designing pages and components or when the user asks you to design something.

## Planning 

When planning, always create a graph of tasks and dependencies between them. 

## Vercel

never deploy to vercel manually, let the CI/CD do it. 


## Running the front

**MANDATORY**: Use `./scripts/dev-start.sh` to start the dev server. This is the ONLY authorized way to start, check, or stop the frontend. Never run `pnpm dev`, `turbo dev`, or `next dev` directly.

```bash
./scripts/dev-start.sh          # Start (or do nothing if already running)
./scripts/dev-start.sh --status # Check if running
./scripts/dev-start.sh --stop   # Stop the server
```

The script is idempotent: run it as many times as needed, it only acts when necessary. It handles dependency installation, env validation, process management, and health checks automatically.

Before any task, run `./scripts/dev-start.sh` to ensure the dev environment is ready.

## Supabase

Migrations are launched automatically by supabase when a commit is made on main or PR is merged.
