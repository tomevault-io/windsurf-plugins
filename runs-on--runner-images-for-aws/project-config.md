# Agents Guide

## Reproduction workflows

Use `.github/workflows/reproductions.yml` to capture issue-specific reproductions.

- Create one job per issue.
- Specify the RunsOn runner label in `runs-on`, for example:
  - `runs-on=${{ github.run_id }}/runner=2cpu-linux-arm64` (RunsOn custom runner syntax; see https://runs-on.com)

## Generated releases

- Treat `releases/` as generated output from the build/sync scripts.
- Do not commit `releases/` changes unless the user explicitly asks for them.
