# Specwright

Spec-driven app development with quality gates. Ensures the user gets what they asked for.

Compatible with AI coding agents that read AGENTS.md project instructions.

## Workflow

```
sw-init → sw-design → sw-plan → sw-build → sw-verify → sw-ship
```

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `sw-init` | Project setup. Creates constitution + charter. Configures gates. |
| `sw-research` | Deep outward-facing research. External docs, APIs, patterns, validation. Produces referenced briefs. |
| `sw-design` | Interactive solution architecture. Research, design, adversarial critic, assumption surfacing. |
| `sw-plan` | Decompose design into work units with testable specs. |
| `sw-build` | TDD implementation of one work unit. |
| `sw-verify` | Interactive quality gates. Shows findings, validates against spec. |
| `sw-ship` | Strategy-aware merge via PR. |
| `sw-debug` | Investigation-first debugging. Scope → investigate → diagnose → fix/log/defer. |
| `sw-pivot` | Mid-build course correction. Revises remaining tasks via architect; append-only. |
| `sw-doctor` | Read-only installation health check. 13 checks, repair hints. |
| `sw-guard` | Detect stack and interactively configure guardrails. |
| `sw-status` | Current state and progress. |
| `sw-adopt` | Explicitly adopt an existing work into the current worktree after ownership checks. |
| `sw-learn` | Post-ship capture of patterns and learnings. |
| `sw-audit` | Periodic codebase health check. Finds systemic tech debt. |
| `sw-sync` | Git housekeeping. Fetch, prune stale branches, sync with remote. |
| `sw-review` | PR comment review. Fetch all comment types, group by status, respond inline. |

## Anchor Documents

Three persistent tracked documents drive all decisions. By default they live
under `.specwright/`, the tracked `projectArtifactsRoot`:

- **`.specwright/CONSTITUTION.md`** -- Development practices. How the user wants code written. The AI MUST follow these.
- **`.specwright/CHARTER.md`** -- Technology vision. What this repo is, who consumes it, architectural invariants.
- **`.specwright/TESTING.md`** -- Testing strategy. How the project should be tested, what boundaries exist, what may be mocked. Optional — created during init if the user opts in.

Constitution and Charter are created during init. TESTING.md is created during init if the user opts in. All are referenced during design and plan, validated during verify. Precedence: Constitution (rules) > Testing Strategy (approach) > patterns.md (reference).

## Architecture

- `core/skills/` -- SKILL.md files (goal + constraints, not procedures)
- `core/protocols/` -- Shared protocols for fragile operations (loaded on demand)
- `core/agents/` -- Agent prompt definitions
- `adapters/` -- Platform-specific packaging (Claude Code, Opencode, Codex CLI, etc.)
- `.specwright/` -- tracked project artifacts (`projectArtifactsRoot`): `config.json`, anchor docs, research, learnings
- runtime roots (`repoStateRoot` / `worktreeStateRoot`) -- clone-local runtime workflow/session state, continuation, and runtime `stage-report.md`; new interactive installs should prefer `project-visible` roots under `.specwright-local/`, while `git-admin` under `.git/specwright/` remains compatibility-only
- `workArtifactsRoot/` -- auditable work artifacts; clone-local under `repoStateRoot/work/` by default, optionally published to a tracked root via `config.git.workArtifacts`

See `DESIGN.md` for the full architecture document.

## Operator Notes

- Run `/sw-status` to see the active runtime roots, live owner, branch posture, and next action.
- Same-work moves between top-level worktrees require explicit `/sw-adopt`; status surfaces must not imply takeover.
- `project-visible` runtime under `.specwright-local/` is the preferred interactive default. `git-admin` under `.git/specwright/` is compatibility mode for existing installs and CI-style constraints.

## Protocols

Skills reference shared protocols in `protocols/` for fragile operations:
- `stage-boundary.md` -- Stage scope, termination, and handoff enforcement
- `delegation.md` -- Agent delegation (custom subagents + agent teams)
- `state.md` -- Workflow state, work unit queue, and transition validation
- `git.md` -- Strategy-aware git operations (branch lifecycle, commits, PRs)
- `git-freshness.md` -- Shared branch freshness checkpoint contract and result semantics
- `approvals.md` -- Durable human approval scopes, hashing, freshness, and headless constraints
- `review-packet.md` -- Reviewer-facing audit packet structure, synthesis rules, and publication-mode constraints
- `recovery.md` -- Compaction recovery
- `evidence.md` -- Gate evidence format
- `context.md` -- Anchor doc and config loading
- `insights.md` -- External Claude Code insights data access
- `learning-lifecycle.md` -- Compaction triggers and tiered memory
- `landscape.md` -- Codebase reference document format and freshness rules
- `audit.md` -- Codebase health findings format, IDs, and lifecycle
- `research.md` -- External research brief format, confidence scoring, and lifecycle
- `build-quality.md` -- Post-build review and as-built notes
- `build-context.md` -- Continuation snapshots, status cards, and context nudge for sw-build
