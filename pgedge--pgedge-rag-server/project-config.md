# pgEdge RAG Server - Development Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for Claude Code when working on this
project. These rules ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability.

## Code Style

### Indentation

- Use **4 spaces** for indentation (not tabs)
- Apply consistently across all code files

## Project Planning

### Long-Running Tasks

When working on complex, multi-step tasks:

- Store plan documents in `/.claude/` directory
- Include task breakdowns, progress tracking, and design decisions
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `phase-3-implementation-plan.md`)

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Formatting

**List Rendering:**

- Always leave a **blank line** before the first item in any list or
  sub-list
- This ensures proper rendering in tools like mkdocs

**Example:**

```markdown
This is a paragraph.

- First item
- Second item
  - Sub-item (note blank line before parent list)
```

### File Naming Conventions

**Root Directory:**

- Use UPPERCASE names for markdown files (e.g., `README.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- Exception: file extensions remain lowercase

**Documentation Directory (`/docs`):**

- Use lowercase names for all markdown files (e.g., `api-reference.md`,
  `getting-started.md`)

### Line Length

- Wrap markdown content at **79 characters or less**
- Exceptions:
  - URLs (don't split)
  - Code samples
  - Tables or structured content where wrapping breaks functionality

### Documentation Locations

**README.md:**

- Keep this as a brief summary for users browsing the repository
- Include: project overview, quick start, and links to full docs

**Full Documentation (`/docs`):**

- All comprehensive documentation must be available in `/docs`
- Don't put detailed content only in root-level markdown files

## Documentation Framework

- The documentation will be used with MKDocs/MKDocs Material
- The MKDocs configuration file is found in mkdocs.yml in the project root
- The table of contents (TOC) in the MKDocs configuration must be maintained

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

**For New Functionality:**

- Always add tests to exercise new features
- Use the top-level Makefile: `make test`, `make lint`
- Ensure all tests run under the `go test` suite

### Running Tests

**Complete Validation:**

- Run ALL tests when verifying changes
- ALWAYS run gofmt if any Go code has been changed
- Check verbose output for failures or errors
- **Never** tail or trim test output (stdout and stderr)
- Capture full output to ensure nothing is missed

### Test Modifications

**When to Modify Tests:**

- Only modify tests if they are **expected to fail** due to your changes
- If a test fails unexpectedly, investigate the cause first
- Don't "fix" tests by changing expectations unless the change is
  intentional

### Test Cleanup

**Temporary Files:**

- Remove temporary files created during test runs
- Exception: Keep logs that may need review
- Ensure cleanup happens even if tests fail

## OpenAPI Specification

### Keeping the Spec in Sync

The OpenAPI specification is defined in Go code at
`internal/server/openapi.go` and served dynamically by the API.
A static copy is generated at `docs/openapi.json` for
documentation purposes.

**When to update:**

- Any change to API request/response schemas, endpoints, or
  parameters **must** be reflected in `openapi.go`
- After modifying `openapi.go`, **always** regenerate the static
  file by running `make openapi`
- Never edit `docs/openapi.json` by hand; it is a generated file

**Workflow:**

1. Edit `internal/server/openapi.go` with schema/endpoint changes
2. Run `make openapi` to regenerate `docs/openapi.json`
3. Commit both files together

## Security Requirements

### Input Validation

**SQL Injection Prevention:**

- Always escape user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Exception: Tools explicitly designed to execute user-provided SQL
  (e.g., `query_database` tool)
- Use parameterized queries where possible

## Example Checklist

When making changes, verify:

- [ ] Code uses 4-space indentation
- [ ] Tests added for new functionality
- [ ] All tests pass (`make test`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`make lint`)
- [ ] Documentation updated in `/docs`
- [ ] Markdown files properly formatted (79 chars, blank lines before
      lists)
- [ ] OpenAPI spec updated if API changed (`make openapi`)
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] No temporary files left behind

## Questions?

If you're unsure about any of these guidelines, refer to:

- Existing code patterns in the repository
- Documentation in `/docs`
- Recent git commits for context
