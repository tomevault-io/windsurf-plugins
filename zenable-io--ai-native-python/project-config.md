# AI-Native Python Paved Road Template Rules

You are working on a cookiecutter template for generating modern Python projects.

## Critical Context

This is a TEMPLATE GENERATOR. Files in `{{cookiecutter.project_name ...}}/` contain Jinja2 variables that must be preserved exactly as written.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.13+ with uv package manager (NOT pip/poetry)
- pytest with >80% coverage requirement
- Pre-commit: ruff, pyright, refurb
- Security: grype, syft
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

6. Update documentation in the docs/ directory as features are added or changed

## Code Standards

- Max line length: 120
- Type hints required
- Google-style docstrings
- Use pathlib (no os.path)
- Use logging (no print)
- Specific exception handling

## Key Commands

```bash
task init       # Setup environment
task build      # Build project
task test       # Run tests
task lint       # Check code quality
```

## Template Testing

```bash
uvx --with gitpython cookiecutter . --no-input    # Generate a default project
cd $(ls -td * | head -1)
task init test                                    # Test the template
```
