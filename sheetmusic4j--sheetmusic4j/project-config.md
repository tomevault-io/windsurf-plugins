# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Sheetmusic4J is a Java 21 / JavaFX library for parsing, rendering, and interacting with sheet music (MusicXML + MIDI).
It follows the same layering approach as the author's `lottie4j` project: a clean, framework-agnostic domain model at
the bottom, a pure layout/math layer in the middle, and JavaFX rendering only at the edge.

GroupId `com.sheetmusic4j`, parent artifactId `sheetmusic4j-parent`.

## Inspired by

* https://www.musicxml.com/: The standard open format for exchanging digital sheet music
* https://github.com/opensheetmusicdisplay/opensheetmusicdisplay: OpenSheetMusicDisplay renders sheet music in MusicXML
  format in browsers and headless with NodeJS.

## Modules (build order, each depends only on the ones before it)

1. **`core`** — domain model (`Score`, `Part`, `Measure`, `Attributes`, `Note`, `Chord`, `Rest`, `Pitch`, `Clef`,
   `KeySignature`, `TimeSignature`, etc.) plus MusicXML read/write (`com.sheetmusic4j.core.musicxml`, StAX-based,
   XXE-hardened) and MIDI import/export (`com.sheetmusic4j.core.midi`, `javax.sound.midi`).
   `com.sheetmusic4j.core.io.ScoreFile` is the load/save facade that dispatches by file extension (`.musicxml`/`.xml`/
   `.mxl` → MusicXML, `.mid`/`.midi` → MIDI). **No JavaFX dependency.**
2. **`engraving`** — pure layout engine. `Engraver.layout(Score, LayoutOptions)` walks parts/measures and produces a
   `LayoutResult` (`SystemLayout` → `StaffLayout` → `MeasureLayout`/`GlyphPlacement`) as plain doubles + a
   renderer-agnostic `Glyph` enum. No JavaFX, no I/O — this is what makes layout unit-testable headlessly. Vertical note
   position is computed by `Engraver.staffStep(Pitch, Clef)`.
3. **`fxviewer`** — rendering. The drawing logic lives in `ScorePainter`, which draws a `LayoutResult` through the
   `RenderSurface` interface (stroke/fill/oval/text primitives) rather than directly against JavaFX. `FxRenderSurface`
   implements `RenderSurface` for a JavaFX `GraphicsContext`; `SheetView` is the `Region`/`Canvas` control that ties
   `Engraver` + `ScorePainter` + `FxRenderSurface` together for on-screen display.
4. **`fxdemo`** — standalone JavaFX demo app (`SheetDemoApp`, launched via `DemoLauncher` to avoid classpath
   JavaFX-runtime errors). Lets you open a MusicXML/MIDI file, shows a debug pane (`ScoreInspector`), and shows a
   companion PDF side-by-side via `com.dlsc.pdfviewfx:pdfviewfx` when one exists next to the loaded file (same basename,
   `.pdf`; resolved by `PdfSibling`).

**Key architectural rule**: the same `ScorePainter` logic is reused for both on-screen JavaFX rendering
(`FxRenderSurface`) and headless AWT rendering in tests (`AwtRenderSurface` in `fxdemo`'s test sources), by depending
only on the `RenderSurface` abstraction. Never draw directly against `GraphicsContext` or `Graphics2D` outside of a
`RenderSurface` implementation — new drawing logic belongs in `ScorePainter`.

## Visual regression testing

`fxdemo`'s `CompareFxViewWithReferenceTest` renders every fixture headlessly (`HeadlessScoreImage`, using the production
`Engraver` + `ScorePainter` + `AwtRenderSurface`) and compares it against the sibling PDF committed next to the MusicXML
fixture:

- The sibling PDF is rasterized page-by-page via `PdfRasterizer` (PDFBox, invoked reflectively so the reference stays on
  the classpath transitively via `pdfviewfx`).
- Pages are stitched vertically via `ImageStack.stackVertically(...)` into a single tall reference image, which
  `DiagnosticComparator` consumes unchanged.
- Assertions are layered: PDF page count (metadata) → ink sanity → staff count → staff bounding-box ratios → per-measure
  similarity.
- Fixtures without a sibling PDF are skipped via `Assumptions.assumeTrue`.
- Rasterization DPI is tunable via `-Dsheetmusic4j.compare.pdf.dpi=<float>` (default `150`); per-measure similarity
  threshold via `-Dsheetmusic4j.compare.measure.threshold=<0..1>` (default `0.4`).
- On failure a self-contained HTML report is written to `fxdemo/target/sheetmusic4j-diff/<fixture>/report.html`.

`fxdemo/src/test/resources/xmlsamples/` contains real-world MusicXML/MXL sample scores (with matching reference
PDFs/PNGs for several) sourced from https://www.musicxml.com/music-in-musicxml/example-set/ — useful for exercising the
reader/engraver against non-trivial scores beyond the minimal `c-major-scale.musicxml` fixture.

## Build & test

Requires Java 21, Maven 3.9+.

```bash
mvn clean install                       # build all modules
mvn test                                # run all tests
mvn -pl core test                       # run tests for a single module
mvn -pl core -Dtest=MusicXmlReaderTest test   # run a single test class
mvn -pl fxdemo javafx:run               # launch the JavaFX demo app
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `mvn verify` on JDK 26 (Temurin). The library still targets
`maven.compiler.release=21`.

Release is a manual `workflow_dispatch` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that bumps the version with `versions:set` and
runs `mvn -Prelease clean deploy` to Maven Central.
