# Times1000 Project Guidelines

## Key Commands
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install Playwright: `python -m playwright install`
- Run application: `python main.py`
- Test browser functionality: `python main.py -t`
- Test prompt: `python main.py -p "your prompt here"`

## Development Workflow
1. Test changes with `python main.py -t`
2. Verify all functionality works
3. Fix ALL errors found during testing (related or not)
4. Commit with descriptive message
5. Push to GitHub

Changes should ALWAYS be tested after they are made. If any errors are found (regardless if they are related or not) they should be fixed immediately. Once no errors are found, every change should be committed and pushed without confirmation of commit messages.
