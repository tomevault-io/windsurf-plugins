# Tekhne Agent Collaboration Guide

This file defines how LLM agents should work in this repository.

## Project Purpose

- Maintain a curated collection of reusable agent skills under `skills/`.
- Keep skill content modular, discoverable, and easy to lint/validate.
- Prefer small, targeted edits over broad rewrites.

## Repository Map

- `skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`: Primary entry point for a skill.
- `skills/<domain>/<tool>/{generator,validator}/SKILL.md`: Generator/validator pairs (consolidated under `<tool>/tile.json`).
- `skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/AGENTS.md`: Optional deep navigation for that skill.
- `skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/references/`: Focused reference documents.
- `skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/scripts/`: Utility scripts used by a skill.
- `skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/templates/`: Reusable templates (mostly YAML).
- `skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/schemas/`: JSON schemas for validation.
- `.context/`: Working notes and generated analysis artifacts.
- `crates/`: Rust tools (`skill-auditor`, `skill-validator-rs`, `adr`, `journal`) for auditing, validation, and skill distribution.
- `scripts/catalog/`: TypeScript catalog generator for `README.md` and the docs tiles page.

**Note:** Generator/validator pairs are consolidated at the tool level (e.g. `terraform-generator` and `terraform-validator` share `skills/infrastructure/terraform/tile.json`).

## Domain Organization

13 domains: `ci-cd/`, `infrastructure/`, `repository-mgmt/`, `development/`, `agentic-harness/`, `testing/`, `software-engineering/`, `observability/`, `documentation/`, `package-mgmt/`, `project-mgmt/`, `specialized/`, `languages/`.

See `skills/agentic-harness/skill-quality-auditor/references/skill-taxonomy.md` for classification criteria.

## Required Workflow For Agents

1. Read the relevant `SKILL.md` before editing files in that skill.
2. Load only the minimum additional files needed for the task.
3. Reuse existing templates/scripts instead of recreating content.
4. Keep changes scoped to the user request; do not refactor unrelated skills.
5. Run validation commands before finishing.

## Authoring Rules

- Use kebab-case for skill directory names.
- Keep instructions explicit, actionable, and deterministic.
- Prefer short sections and predictable headings.
- Store deep details in `references/` and keep `SKILL.md` as a navigation hub.
- Use Markdown fenced code blocks with language tags when applicable.
- Use ASCII unless a file already requires Unicode.
- `templates/`: YAML extensions (`.yaml` or `.yml`) only.
- `schemas/`: JSON Schema files named `*.schema.json` with a `"$schema"` URL.
- `scripts/`: Executable scripts with proper shebangs (sh/bash/python3/bun/node).
- Skills must be self-contained: no `../` paths, no absolute `skills/X/Y` paths, no `.context/` or `.agents/` references in SKILL.md (fenced code blocks and inline code spans are exempt).

### Tessl Registry Preparation

- **Agent agnostic**: Avoid features specific to individual AI assistants.
- **Quality threshold**: Target A-grade (>=126/140) using `skill-quality-auditor`.
- **Single responsibility**: Each skill solves one well-defined problem domain.

## Validation Commands

```bash
bunx @biomejs/biome check .
bunx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"
```

## Skill Quality Audits

Run before publishing or committing major changes. See `skills/agentic-harness/skill-quality-auditor/SKILL.md` for full workflow.

```bash
pantheon-skill-auditor evaluate <domain>/<skill-name> --json --store
```

Grades: **A** ≥126/140 · **B+** 119-125 · **B** 112-118 · **C/C+** <112 (blocked from publishing).

Build the auditor from source with `bun run build:skill-auditor` (a shortcut for `cargo build --release -p pantheon-skill-auditor`), then invoke `target/release/pantheon-skill-auditor evaluate`.

## Skill Management with Tessl

The Tessl registry lifecycle runs through the `tessl` CLI directly, wrapped by npm scripts:

```bash
bun run tessl:import      # tessl skill import
bun run tessl:lint        # tessl plugin lint
bun run tessl:review      # tessl review run
bun run tessl:publish     # tessl plugin publish
```

Use `tessl skill review --optimize` for skills scoring below 90%. The former bulk `tessl manage` and `publish-check` commands were retired with the TypeScript CLI.

### Skills distributed via crate installers (not the registry)

Three skills are embedded into Rust crates at build time and distributed only by
their crate's `install` command, never through the Tessl registry:

- `documentation/journal-entry-creator` (embedded in the `journal` crate)
- `documentation/adr-creator` (embedded in the `adr` crate)
- `agentic-harness/skill-quality-auditor` (embedded in the `skill-auditor` crate)

These have `"private": true` in their `.tessl-plugin/plugin.json` and are omitted
from `release-please-config.json` and `.release-please-manifest.json`, so the crate
version is canonical and `tessl:publish` skips them. Their previously published
registry versions were archived with `tessl plugin archive`. Continue running
evals, audits, and quality tooling on their `SKILL.md` as normal; only the registry
publish step is retired. Install them with `pantheon-journal skill install`, `adr skill
install`, or `pantheon-skill-auditor skill install`.
