### Coding Guidelines for Succubus Club

This document provides essential guidelines for AI agents and developers working in this repository.
It covers project structure, coding standards, and commands for building and linting.

---

### 1. Project Overview
Succubus Club is a TCG (Trading Card Game) web platform for playing V:TES in a browser.
- **Root**: Configuration files (Vite, ESLint, TypeScript).
- **src/client**: Vue 3 + Phaser 3 + Phavuer game client.
- **src/server**: Node.js + WebSocket game server (using `ws`).
- **src/shared**: Shared logic, models, and constants used by both client and server.

Multiplayer connection can be made either directly between clients through ably ( Ably mode ), or with an authoritative central server ( SCS mode ).

### 2. General Rules
- **Line Endings**: Always use LF line endings (never CRLF).
- **Emojis**: NEVER use emojis in the codebase.
- **Phaser/Vue Integration**:
  - Prefer Phavuer GameObjects components (e.g., `<Image />`, `<Rectangle />`, `<Text />`) over vanilla Phaser GameObjects when applicable.
  - Phavuer components should be used within `.vue` files in `src/client/game/objects`.
  - Use `ref` to access underlying Phaser objects if direct API calls are necessary.

### 3. JavaScript & TypeScript
- **Semicolons**: DO NOT use semicolons at the end of statements.
- **Variables**: Prefer `const` over `let`. Avoid `var`.
- **Types**:
  - NEVER use the `any` type. Define proper interfaces or types.
  - NEVER use the non-null assertion operator `!`. Use proper null checks.
- **Naming**:
  - Use `camelCase` for TypeScript files and variable names.
  - Use `PascalCase` for classes and interfaces.
- **Imports**:
  - Use absolute paths with the `@` alias (pointing to `src/`).
  - Use `.ts` or `.vue` extensions in imports where appropriate.
  - Example: `import { Card } from '@/shared/model/Card.ts'`
- **Error Handling**: Use `try/catch` blocks for asynchronous operations and provide meaningful error messages.

### 4. Vue.js (Composition API)
- **API**: Use strictly the `<script setup>` syntax with Composition API.
- **Components**:
  - Use `PascalCase` for Vue component names (e.g., `TopBar.vue`).
  - Use self-closing tags for components without content (e.g., `<UserAvatar />`).
- **Types**: Ensure proper type definitions for props and emits.

### 5. CSS / SCSS
- **Syntax**: Use Sass/SCSS syntax.
- **Responsiveness**: DO NOT write responsive CSS. This app is desktop-only.
- **Layout**: Use CSS Grid or Flexbox. Avoid floats.
- **Organization**: Group styles by feature/component in the `src/client/styles` directory or within Vue SFCs.
- **Constraints**:
  - DO NOT use `border-radius` (no round borders).
  - DO NOT use `box-shadow`.
  - Avoid `!important` declarations.

### 6. Build, Lint, and Development Commands
Commands are managed via `npm`. Run these from the project root.

#### Client Commands
- **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
- **Development Server**: `npm run dev` (Runs Vite on `localhost:5173`)
- **Build Production**: `npm run build`
- **Type Checking**: `npm run type:check`
- **Linting**:
  - `npm run lint:check` (Report errors)
  - `npm run lint:fix` (Auto-fix errors)
- **Formatting**:
  - `npm run format:check`
  - `npm run format:fix` (Using Prettier)

#### Server Commands
- **Install Server Deps**: `npm run server:install`
- **Start Development Server**: `npm run server:dev` (Uses `tsx watch`)
- **Build Server**: `npm run server:build`
- **Start Production Server**: `npm run server:start`

#### Testing
Currently, there is no automated test suite configured in the repository.

### 7. AI Agent Specific Tips
- **Context**: Use the `src/shared` folder to understand the game model and logic.
- **UI**: When creating new UI components, refer to these for structure and styles:
  - Header/Navigation: `src/client/ui/components/TopBar.vue`
  - Screens/Layouts: `src/client/ui/screen/Lobby.vue`
- **Game Objects**: Use components in `src/client/game/objects` as templates (e.g., `CardGO.vue`).
- **State Management**: Client-side, use Pinia stores located in `src/client/store` to manage the game state.

### 8. Code Style Reference
Follow the existing patterns in the codebase:
- Keep components small and focused.
- Export shared logic to `@/shared`.
