# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start development server with hot reload
npm run start           # Preview built application

# Code Quality (run these before committing)
npm run lint            # ESLint checking
npm run format          # Prettier formatting
npm run typecheck       # TypeScript type checking (both node and web)

# Testing
npm test                # Run unit tests for main process
npm run test:watch      # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Run tests with coverage report

# Building
npm run build           # Full production build with type checking
npm run build:mac       # Build macOS distribution
npm run build:win       # Build Windows distribution
npm run build:linux     # Build Linux distribution
npm run build:unpack    # Build without packaging for testing
```

## Project Architecture

**SnapQL** is an Electron-based desktop app for AI-powered PostgreSQL database exploration and query generation.

### Core Structure

- **Main Process** (`src/main/`): Database connections, AI integration, settings management
- **Renderer Process** (`src/renderer/src/`): React frontend with TailwindCSS + Radix UI
- **Preload Script** (`src/preload/`): Secure IPC bridge between main and renderer

### Key Files

- `src/main/lib/db.ts` - Database operations and AI query generation logic
- `src/main/lib/ai.ts` - Query generation logic
- `src/main/lib/state.ts` - Settings management (stored in `~/SnapQL/settings.json`)
- `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` - Main React application component
- `src/renderer/src/components/` - UI components (AIChat, SQLEditor, ResultsTable, Settings)

### Tech Stack

- **Electron** (v35.1.5) + **React** (v19.1.0) + **TypeScript**
- **Vite/electron-vite** for building
- **TailwindCSS** + **Radix UI** for styling/components
- **CodeMirror** for SQL syntax highlighting
- **OpenAI SDK** + **Vercel AI SDK** for AI query generation
- **PostgreSQL** (pg client) for database connectivity
- **ShadCN/UI** as the UI/UX framework

### Security Architecture

- Sandboxed renderer process with context isolation
- No direct Node.js access from renderer
- Database credentials stored locally only
- Secure IPC communication patterns

### Development Notes

- Uses multi-config TypeScript setup (node, web, main)
- Hot reload enabled in development mode
- Settings auto-saved to `~/SnapQL/settings.json`
- Query history stored (last 20 queries)
- Cross-platform builds supported (macOS, Windows, Linux)

### Testing

- **Jest** configured for unit testing main process code
- Tests located in `src/main/__tests__/`
- Isolated from Electron environment for pure Node.js testing
- TypeScript support with ts-jest preprocessor

### Development Warnings

- Don't run "npm run dev" to test

### Development Best Practices

- When working on end-user features make sure to update README.md when relevant

### AI Interaction Guidelines

- Always generate an implementation plan and ask me to confirm before proceeding to implementation
- When planning, think of the minimal amount of software that fulfils the requirements. Ruthlessly cut scope until you do the minimum required to fulfil the requirements. Do not come up with your own features or nice to haves.
