# AGENTS.md

Agent guide for `mangarr`. Goal: high-signal changes, low entropy, docs/tests stay trustworthy.

## Start Here

Read in this order before changing behavior:

1. `README.md`
2. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `docs/DESIGN.md`
4. `docs/PLANS.md`
5. `docs/QUALITY_SCORE.md`
6. `docs/design-docs/index.md`
7. `docs/product-specs/index.md`

Docs are the operator-facing system of record. If behavior changes, update docs in the same change.

## Repo Shape

- `cmd/`: CLI entrypoints and command orchestration.
- `internal/source/`: source adapters. Highest churn/risk area.
- `internal/download/`: image fetch/retry/concurrency.
- `internal/files/`: archive creation.
- `internal/config/`: config load/default/reload.
- `internal/sharedhttp/`: HTTP client/retry policy.

## Harness Working Loop

1. Restate task + constraints.
2. Read docs + relevant code paths before editing.
3. Make a small plan. For non-trivial work, add or update a checked-in file under `docs/exec-plans/`.
4. Build the smallest diff that fixes root cause.
5. Verify with the narrowest useful test first, then full gate.
6. Update docs/tests while context is fresh.
7. Remove dead code, stale comments, and unused branches discovered in the touched area.

## Agent Legibility Rules

- Prefer explicit control flow over clever abstractions.
- Keep package boundaries clear. Do not leak source-specific behavior into generic packages unless it is truly shared.
- Add comments only for non-obvious invariants, scraping caveats, or retry/concurrency reasoning.
- Preserve or improve error context. Include source name, manga/chapter identifiers, and failing operation when useful.
- Keep files and functions readable. When touching a tangled area, leave it simpler than you found it.

## Source Adapter Rules

- Follow `domain.Source` contract exactly.
- Validate adapter input early and fail fast with actionable errors.
- Treat upstream HTML/API schemas as unstable. Avoid brittle selector chains when a more stable attribute exists.
- Reuse shared HTTP/browser utilities before adding adapter-local transport logic.
- If fixing a parser/selection bug, add or extend a regression test when practical.

## Verification

Minimum full gate before handoff:

```bash
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go build ./...
```

Use narrower checks while iterating. For adapter changes, do manual smoke verification against the affected source when network access is available and note what was exercised.

## Dependency + Interface Changes

- New dependency: justify it. Check maintenance/release health first.
- Public CLI/config changes: update `README.md` and relevant docs in the same diff.
- Config behavior changes: keep `docs/design-docs/runtime-model.md`, [monitoring-operator.md](./docs/product-specs/monitoring-operator.md), and sample config usage aligned.

## Entropy Control

When you touch an area, look for easy cleanup:

- delete unreachable code
- collapse duplicate logic
- remove stale TODOs/comments
- tighten tests around the bug seam
- update docs that no longer match reality

Do not do opportunistic repo-wide rewrites.

## Handoff

Report:

- what changed
- what you verified
- any gaps, live-source limitations, or follow-up risks

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
