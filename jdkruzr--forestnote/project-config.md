# ForestNote

Last verified: 2026-06-02 (phase8-rhizome-cutover)

E-ink note-taking app for low-latency stylus handwriting. Two firmware-latency ink paths behind one `InkBackend` seam: the **Viwoods AiPaper Mini** via reverse-engineered fast-ink APIs (display accelerator — MotionEvents → fast overlay), and **Boox/Onyx** devices via the published Onyx Pen SDK (`TouchHelper`/`RawInputCallback` — the backend OWNS input, firmware renders live ink). A generic `View.invalidate()` fallback covers any other Android device. Backend is auto-detected at launch; stored stroke DATA is identical across platforms (only the on-panel raster differs).

## Tech Stack
- Language: Kotlin (Android)
- Min SDK: 30, Target SDK: 30, Compile SDK: 35
- Build: Gradle with convention plugins in `build-logic/`
- Storage: SQLDelight 2.0.2 (SQLite). The single library file (`default.forestnote`) lives at **`/sdcard/ForestNote/`** (top-level shared external storage) so it survives an uninstall/reinstall (chiefly the debug→release signing-key swap) and is Termux-inspectable. Creating a top-level `/sdcard` folder on API 30+ needs `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` ("All files access"), which `MainActivity` requests on first launch; until granted, the datastore falls back to app-private storage and migrates out to `/sdcard` once granted. Redirected via `StorageLocation`/`ExternalStorageContext` in `core:format` — see `core/format/CLAUDE.md`. Secrets (EncryptedSharedPreferences) stay in private storage.
- Device↔server sync: the **RhizomeSync library** (`io.rhizome:rhizome-core/-sqlite/-http:0.8.2`, published to mavenLocal from `~/rhizome`) — the schema-driven, row-level-LWW, HLC-stamped sync core extracted from FN+UB so the correctness-critical algorithm lives in one place. `core:format` binds it via `SqliteStorageAdapter` (capture/apply/outbox in `rhizome_*` tables) + `ForestNoteRegistry` (the wire schema, hash v3 `724411eb…`); `app:notes` `SyncController` drives `io.rhizome.core.SyncEngine`. `core:sync` is now just the FN-specific `SyncBackoff`/`SyncJoinPlan` policy. (Phase 8 cutover; see `core/sync/CLAUDE.md` + memory `project_rhizome`.)
- Geometry: Jetpack Ink API 1.0.0 (brush/geometry/strokes)
- Boox/Onyx ink: Onyx Pen SDK (`onyxsdk-pen:1.5.4` + `-device:1.3.5` + `-base:1.8.5`) + `hiddenapibypass:6.1`, used only by `BooxInkBackend` in `core:ink`, runtime-gated to Onyx devices (inert elsewhere); cleartext-HTTP Maven repo. See `core/ink/CLAUDE.md` for the firmware raw-drawing model (two independent firmware switches, canvas-only surface, freeze-toggle reconcile)
- UI: Android Views (no Compose), Material 3
- Handwriting recognition: Google ML Kit Digital Ink 18.1.0 (stroke-native; bundled-only artifact requires GMS + one-time per-language ~20 MB model download via `RemoteModelManager` — host tablet has GMS + Google account)
- CalDAV transport: OkHttp 4.12.0 (scoped to `app/notes/caldav/` only — the device-sync engine rides `HttpURLConnection` via RhizomeSync's `io.rhizome.http.HttpUrlTransport`, dependency-light per the original `core:sync` rationale, now upstreamed into the library). UI never PUTs synchronously: the lasso → task path enqueues into a local SQLite outbox (`caldav_outbox`, LOCAL-ONLY) and a `CalDavOutboxDrainer` (lifecycle peer of `SyncController`) does the PUTs, with a `NetworkAvailabilityMonitor` kicking `drainNow()` when WiFi comes back. No WorkManager — the AiPaper is foreground-driven, and SQLite + lifecycle hooks + `NetworkCallback` cover the actual failure mode
- Secret storage: `androidx.security:security-crypto` 1.1.0-alpha06 (EncryptedSharedPreferences, AES-256 key in Android Keystore) — owns sync + CalDAV credentials; `Settings` JSON blob is non-secrets only

## Commands
- `./gradlew :app:notes:assembleDebug` - Build debug APK
- `./gradlew :core:ink:test` - Run ink module unit tests
- `./gradlew :core:format:test` - Run format module unit tests
- `./gradlew :app:notes:test` - Run app module unit tests
- `./gradlew test` - Run all unit tests

## Viwoods Dev Device
- During active dev sessions, assume it is acceptable to build and install ForestNote on the Viwoods tablet unless the user says otherwise.
- Current device access is SSH/Termux, not ADB shell: `ssh -p 8022 <device-ip>` and `scp -P 8022 ... <device-ip>:/sdcard/Download/...`. The device IP varies per deployment (whoever stands up the tablet), so it is not pinned here.
- The device has Magisk root through Termux `su`; do not use blanket SELinux permissive mode (`setenforce 0`) because it breaks WritingSurface until reboot.
- **Viwoods package-session backdoor:** ADB/Termux package-manager commands are restricted, but root package sessions work:
  `su -c "cmd package install-create -r -d"`, then
  `su -c "cmd package install-write SESSION base /sdcard/Download/forestnote-debug.apk && cmd package install-commit SESSION"`.
- Standard deploy loop: build `app/notes/build/outputs/apk/debug/notes-debug.apk`, copy it to `/sdcard/Download/forestnote-debug.apk`, install via the root package-session commands, then verify with `su -c "cmd package list packages --show-versioncode com.forestnote; cmd package path com.forestnote"`.

## Project Structure
- `app/notes/` - Main application module (Activity, DrawView, ToolBar, NotebookStore persistence owner)
