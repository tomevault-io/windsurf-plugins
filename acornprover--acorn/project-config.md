## Instructions

- When writing Rust code, before telling the user you're finished, you should run the tests,
  Rust compiler check, and autoformat:
  `cargo test`
  `cargo check`
  `cargo fmt`

- If we make changes to the elaborator or the kernel, we should run a full check to ensure we didn't
  break anything.
  `cargo run --profile release --features validate -- check`

  This verifies the code in `~/acornlib`, which you can inspect to figure out verification failures.

- If a unit test breaks, but just in the verifier or prover, we should try to add another,
  narrower unit test, that catches the problem in the underlying data structure.

## Acorn CLI Usage

- `cargo run --profile release -- check` is the thorough correctness check for existing proofs.
  It verifies cached certificates without relying on prover search, and should be run after
  completing work.

- `cargo run --profile release -- verify [target]` is the normal incremental way to check Acorn
  code. It uses the cache when possible and searches for missing proofs when necessary.

- `cargo run --profile release -- verify [target] --force-search` bypasses cached proofs and
  forces prover search. Use it only for testing prover behavior, not for routine correctness checks
  or cache rewrites.

- If we run into an error during check mode, to debug it, it can help to
  run check just on the module that failed at a higher log level. For example:
  `RUST_LOG=acorn=trace cargo run --profile release -- check list.list_base`

- To rewrite certificate caches without testing prover search, use `verify --ignore-hash`, not
  `verify --force-search`. For example:
  `cargo run --profile release -- verify finite_group --ignore-hash`

  `verify --force-search` forces the prover to run and should be reserved for testing prover
  behavior.

- A full force-search run is slow, but sometimes finds obscure bugs that nothing else finds. We
  generally only want to do this when the user asks for it:

  `cargo run --profile release --features validate -- verify --force-search`

  When you do a full force-search run, it's okay if some propositions can't be verified. What
  indicates a real problem is if the prover crashes.

- If we find errors during a "check" or force-search operation, we should add a unit test that
  catches this case.

- If we change normalization, clausification, claim serialization, or claim parsing, we must
  continue to satisfy the normalization contract in `docs/normalization.md`. In particular, exact
  normalized certificate `(clause, var_map)` roundtrips are a requirement, not a best-effort goal.

## Project Structure

- `/src` - Core Rust implementation
- `/vscode` - VS Code extension and assistant interface
- `/python` - Training scripts for the scoring model

## Versioning

- The "acornlib project format version" is defined by `PROJECT_FORMAT_VERSION` in
  `src/manifest.rs`. Bump this when making breaking changes to the project format.
