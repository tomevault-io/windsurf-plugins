## Project Overview

A2A Protocol Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) — a conformance test suite that validates A2A-protocol-compliant agents across three transports: gRPC, JSON-RPC, and HTTP+JSON.

## Architecture

## Key Conventions

### Transport Bindings

All A2A bindings (transport methods, error codes, task states, etc.) are defined centrally in `tck/requirements/base.py`.

### Requirement IDs

- Core: `CORE-OPS-*`
- gRPC: `GRPC-*` (e.g., GRPC-ERR-001, GRPC-SVC-001)
- JSON-RPC: `JSONRPC-*`
- HTTP+JSON: `HTTP_JSON-*`

### Test Patterns

- Transport-specific test classes use the corresponding marker decorator (`@grpc`, `@jsonrpc`, `@http_json` from `tests/compatibility/markers.py`)
- Tests get clients via `transport_clients` fixture (dict keyed by transport name: `"grpc"`, `"jsonrpc"`, `"http_json"`)
- Each test records results with `compatibility_collector.record(requirement_id, transport, level, passed, errors)`

### Code Style

- Python 3.11+, `from __future__ import annotations` in every file
- Linter: run `make lint`
- Third-party imports used only as type hints go under `if TYPE_CHECKING:` (ruff TC002 rule)
- Import statemments are sorted
- No private member access across modules (ruff SLF001 rule) — use public properties

### Code generation

- Be concise
- Try to use existing code instead of generating new similar code
- Use the same code convention than existing code. If the existing convention seems incorrect, make suggestion before doing any changes

### PR instructions
- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) for the commit title and message
- Always ask if the commit is related to a GitHub issue. If that's the case, add a `This fixes #{issue}" at the end of the commit message
- Always run `make lint` and `make unit-test` before committing.

## Skills

- **update-a2a-spec** (`.agents/skills/update-a2a-spec/SKILL.md`): Step-by-step workflow for updating the TCK when the A2A protocol specification changes. Read the full skill file before starting an update.
- **run-tck** (`.agents/skills/run-tck/SKILL.md`): Guide an SDK implementor through running the TCK against their System Under Test (SUT), diagnosing failures, and achieving compatibility.
- **learn-requirement** (`.agents/skills/learn-requirement/SKILL.md`): Learn about a specific TCK requirement — its definition, spec context, related tests, and what an SUT needs to do to satisfy it.
- **diagnose-failure** (`.agents/skills/diagnose-failure/SKILL.md`): Diagnose a TCK requirement failure and draft a GitHub issue with requirement context, failure details, and a curl reproducer.
- **a2a-client** (`.agents/skills/a2a-client/SKILL.md`): Interact with remote A2A agents via curl — discover agent cards, send messages, manage tasks, and stream responses.
- **a2a-java-sut** (`.agents/skills/a2a-java-sut/SKILL.md`): Work with the a2a-java SUT — regenerate from Gherkin scenarios, build, start, and test with the TCK.
- **a2a-python-sut** (`.agents/skills/a2a-python-sut/SKILL.md`): Work with the a2a-python SUT — regenerate from Gherkin scenarios, install deps, start, and test with the TCK.

## Commands

- `make lint` — run ruff linter
- `make unit-test` — run unit tests (no SUT required)
- `make spec` — update A2A specification files
