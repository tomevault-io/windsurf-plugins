# ClickUp CLI Project Documentation

## Objective
The **ClickUp CLI** is a lightweight command-line tool designed to interact with the ClickUp API. Its current focus is to enable users to send messages to ClickUp chat channels efficiently from their terminal. The project aims to be simple, extensible, and easy to install.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code.
    - `clickup-cli`: The core executable shell script.
    - `lib/`: (Placeholder) Intended for future modular shell libraries.
- `install.sh`: A setup script that installs the CLI to `/usr/local/bin`, creates a configuration directory at `~/.clickup-cli`, and initializes default configuration and log files.
- `README.md`: Comprehensive guide on installation, configuration, usage examples, and contribution.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Technologies Used
- **Shell Scripting**: The entire CLI is implemented as a POSIX-compliant shell script, ensuring compatibility across various Unix-like environments.
- **ClickUp API v3**: Utilizes the latest version of the ClickUp API for communication.
- **cURL**: The primary tool for executing HTTP requests to the ClickUp API.
- **jq**: Preferred tool for parsing and generating JSON data. The CLI includes a fallback mechanism using `sed` for environments where `jq` is not installed.
- **Configuration**: Uses a local shell script (`~/.clickup-cli/config`) to export environment variables for authentication and defaults.

## Key Features
- **Flexible Argument Parsing**: Supports global flags (`-w`, `-c`, `-v`) and inline parameters (`to`, `in`).
- **Logging & Debugging**: Detailed logging to `~/.clickup-cli/log` and a verbose mode for troubleshooting API calls.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of common HTTP error codes (401, 403, 404, 429) with descriptive messages.
