# Migration Execution Policy

- Never run `makemigrations`, `migrate`, or any migration-generation command automatically.
- Never apply database migrations automatically.
- If schema/model changes require migrations, stop and ask the user to run them manually.
- You may mention the exact command(s) the user should run, but do not execute them unless explicitly requested.
