Project goals:
- Nanopath should be easy to share with collaborators so they can quickly try new training objectives, preprocessing choices, data curation ideas, and hyperparameters on a small model.
- The normal loop is: iterate fast on a single H100, validate promising changes with downstream probes, then reserve larger/full-node training for the best candidates.
- Keep the codebase hackable and nanochat-like: flat organization, few files, few lines, and minimal abstractions.

Before changing code:
- If not already activated, source nanopath's .venv.
- For broad or ambiguous tasks, read deeply enough into the current repo to understand the training/probing/data path before recommending changes. Look at every relevant source, config, script, and doc file rather than optimizing one file in isolation.
- Make a concrete multi-step plan for nontrivial work, then keep going through implementation, validation, and any needed doc/comment updates.
- Default to immediately implementing sensible recommendations and validating them rather than simply suggesting recommendations.

Coding guidelines:
- Use flat organization: as few folders, files, and lines of code as possible; functional elegance is the goal. If you make revisions where there are over a dozen new lines of code I am going to be highly skeptical you really tried your best to adhere to this guideline. A great revision should LOWER the total lines of code, not increase it. Don't play smart by opening subprocesses or other hacks to get around this limitation.
- Commenting is the exception to the line-count preference: add concise comments explaining "how and why" for functions and important (i.e., not plotting/logging) code blocks.
- Do not add defensive `try`/`except` blocks or fallbacks. If something is wrong, it should fail loudly. Don't bother with ValueError raises or other code guards.
- Prefer hard-coded constants over extra environment variables, modular options, or fallback paths, unless the value is meant to be frequently tuned.
- Prefer native PyTorch over Accelerate, Lightning, etc. nanopath is single-GPU only — do not introduce DDP, FSDP, or any multi-GPU code path.
- Do not use `argparse`. Meaningful tunables should live in YAML config files, e.g. `cfg.train.lr`; if YAML does not define a variable used by a training script, it is fine for that to error. Only put variables in YAML when they are actually meant to be tuned often; otherwise hard-code them.
- Avoid tiny helper functions/classes that are only a handful of lines. Put the code directly where it is used.
- Follow [nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat) as the model for a clean minimalist codebase, especially `train.py` and `model.py`.
- Do not create new files unless explicitly asked or truly necessary; prefer improving existing files. If you do create a new file, add a few commented out lines of code to the top of it to explain its purpose.
- If code changes make comments, docs, configs, or scripts inaccurate, update those too.

Experiment and benchmark discipline:
- Validate opinions experimentally whenever feasible. Run code, tests, probes, or short jobs that directly support the conclusion.
- Use downstream probing as the main comparison signal because objectives like JEPA, MAE, DINO, and iBOT may not have comparable validation losses.
- An improvement should only actually be considered an improvement when mean_probe_score improves by at least .006; anything less is within random variance.
- Use wandb for logging, plotting, and utilization monitoring throughout pretraining. Log all metrics needed to validate training behavior (i.e., gradient norm).
- Aim for >80% GPU utilization during GPU runs; investigate and remedy code when utilization is poor.
- Full runs launched with `./submit/train_1gpu.sbatch ...` prompt for Labless run name, notes, and GitHub no-scope device login before scheduling, then auto-submit after a successful eligible run. For direct `python train.py` runs or frozen baseline evaluations worth sharing, run `./labless/submit_to_labless.py output_dir=... run_name=... notes=...`; labless records the verified GitHub login, and each login can submit at most 100 runs per 24 hours. Full submissions require `summary.json`, `metrics.jsonl`, `summary.max_train_samples == 1000000`, `summary.tile_presentations <= 1000000`, and `summary.max_train_flops == 1e18`. Keep smoke checks and failed runs local.
- Do not submit runs whose saved `labless_source` snapshot changes `probe.py` or `benchmarking/`; labless marks locked-path changes invalid.

Cluster and storage:
- The login node has no GPU access, and has a different /tmp folder than the compute nodes. For full training runs (or anything that would take more than a few minutes) you should submit SLURM jobs to H100 nodes (`n-#`) or CPU nodes (`c-1`). If it's a quick single-GPU assessment you can use `ssh n-#` directly (but only when an idle GPU is available!).
- Store large files, checkpoints, embeddings, caches, and pretrained models under `/data/$USER/nanopath` (configs use literal `$USER`, expanded by `train.py` at load time), not the repo.
