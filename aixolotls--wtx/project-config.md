# Task Management

- Use Linear as the single source of truth for tasks in this repository.
- Use Linear as the single source of truth for plans in this repository.
- Tag all `wtx` repository tasks with the Linear issue label `wtx`.
- Tag all plan issues with both labels: `wtx` and `plan`.
- Prefer creating/updating/closing Linear issues instead of maintaining a local task list for active work.
- To find existing plans, filter Linear issues by labels `wtx` + `plan` (do not inspect all open issues manually).
- Local notes are optional drafting artifacts only and are not authoritative; if used, they must point to the Linear issue.

# Testing Notes

- Keep e2e scenarios isolated from this repo by creating and using temporary test repositories.
- For any code changes in this repository, run `make e2e` before reporting completion (unless the user explicitly asks to skip it).

# UX Notes

- In action-driven flows, selecting an action that needs extra input should open a dedicated follow-up popup/screen instead of embedding the form in the action list.
- For git command failures shown to users, surface the real stderr/stdout message (not just generic exit codes like `exit status 128`).
- For local branch metadata operations in popup flows (for example branch rename), use non-interactive `git` subprocesses with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, explicit timeouts, and surfaced stderr/stdout.
- For tmux follow-up popups, avoid `run-shell` nesting and use a direct popup invocation path to prevent command/session leakage across windows.
