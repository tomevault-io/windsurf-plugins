- read README.md for overview of the project
- read files in docs/reference/*.md if you need knowledge about the NATS protocol
- use `./check.sh` to format code, run unit tests, and run integration tests
- use `./check.sh --test-filter "test name" ` to run specific tests
- use `./check.sh --test-fail-first true` to stop on first test failure
- prefer only running specific tests and stopping on the first failure, while working on the feature
- run full check after you are done
