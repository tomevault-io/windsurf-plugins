## gsd-browser

Native Rust browser automation CLI for AI agents. Controls Chrome/Chromium via CDP with a persistent background daemon. Supports navigation, element interaction (click, type, fill), snapshots with versioned refs, assertions, form analysis, structured data extraction, visual regression testing, network mocking, device emulation, auth vault, and prompt injection scanning.

### Quick Start

```bash
gsd-browser navigate https://example.com
gsd-browser snapshot
gsd-browser click-ref @v1:e1
```

### Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsd-build/gsd-browser/main/install.sh | bash

# or from a repo checkout
cargo install --path cli
```

Requires Chrome or Chromium. The installer reuses a system browser when present and downloads Chromium automatically where Chrome for Testing is available.
