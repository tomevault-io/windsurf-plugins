## Package development
  - Document every new or changed feature in both places, in the same change:
    - `site/index.html`, the full documentation published on GitHub Pages: add or update its section. The left menu is built from the `h2`/`h3` headings; give a heading a `data-nav` attribute for a shorter menu label.
    - `README.md`: keep it concise. At most a line in Features or a bullet in the design guidance, linking to the section in the site. Detail belongs in the site, never in the README.
  - Add every user-visible change to `CHANGELOG.md` in the same change, under `## [Unreleased]`, in its Keep a Changelog group (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security). One line per change, linking its issue. Mark a breaking change **Breaking:** and add how to upgrade to the site's Upgrading section.
  - On a release, rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, start a new empty `## [Unreleased]` above it, and update the compare links at the bottom.

## Commands
  - Test: `composer test`
  - Linting: `composer lint` (`composer format` to fix)
  - Static analysis: `composer analyse`
