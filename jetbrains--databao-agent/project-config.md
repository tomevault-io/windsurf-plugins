# Python Code Style

## String Formatting

Always use f-strings for string formatting.

```python
# BAD
"Hello, %s" % name
"Hello, {}".format(name)

# GOOD
f"Hello, {name}"
```

## Comments and Docstrings

- Never leave inline comments explaining how the code works.
- Do write docstrings for modules, classes, and functions where it adds clarity.

```python
# BAD
x = x + 1  # increment x by one
result = fetch_data(url)  # fetches data from the url

# GOOD
def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
    """Fetch JSON data from the given URL."""
    ...
```

## Linting

After finishing changes, run `ruff check` on all modified Python files to verify linting and style compliance.
