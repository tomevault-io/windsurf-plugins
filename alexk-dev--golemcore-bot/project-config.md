# Instructions for Codex

1. Before starting any task, read `CLAUDE.md` in the repository root and follow it.
2. If the task touches one or more module directories, also read the matching module-local instruction file(s) before making changes:
   - `golemcore-bot-app/CLAUDE.md`
   - `golemcore-bot-client/CLAUDE.md`
   - `golemcore-bot-contracts/CLAUDE.md`
   - `dashboard/CLAUDE.md`
3. If the task spans multiple modules, read all relevant local `CLAUDE.md` files.
4. If rules conflict, the more local file has priority.
5. For `dashboard/*`, `dashboard/CLAUDE.md` takes precedence.
