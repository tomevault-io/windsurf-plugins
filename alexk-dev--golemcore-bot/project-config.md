# CLAUDE.md — GolemCore Bot Contracts Module

This module contains shared contracts for GolemCore Bot.

## What belongs here

- port interfaces
- shared domain models used across modules
- contract-style component interfaces
- lightweight shared view models
- other stable boundary types needed by multiple modules

## Rules

1. New shared contracts must go into this module.
2. Do not put runtime-heavy Spring services, adapters, controllers, or tool implementations here.
3. Keep this module lightweight and dependency-minimal.
4. Prefer stable, reusable boundary types over feature-specific implementation details.
