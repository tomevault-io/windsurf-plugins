# AGENTS.md

### Mandatory Test Execution

1. Always run tests after making changes.
2. At minimum, run the most targeted tests for touched files/features.
3. For broad or cross-cutting changes, run the full suite before considering work complete.
4. If any test cannot be run, explicitly document which test was skipped and why.

## Completion Criteria

Treat work as complete only when all are true:

1. Phase checklist items are updated.
2. New/updated tests are green.
3. Regressions in touched areas are checked.
4. PRD status reflects reality (`Completed` only when fully done).
