# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents working in this project. This is the cross-tool
entry point: Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Aider, Zed, Windsurf, and
others read `AGENTS.md`. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, which imports this file, so
there is a single source of truth.

## What this is

A description of your project and the problem it solves.

This project is built with the **AI Coding Blueprint**, a workflow layer, not an
app skeleton. To start a new project, scaffold the app first in an empty folder
(create-next-app, Vite, etc.), then overlay these files on top. Never run a
framework scaffolder inside a directory that already holds the blueprint files
(`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `blueprint/`); it fails
because the directory isn't empty.

New here? `blueprint/README.md` explains the whole workflow.

## Read these when relevant

- `blueprint/config.json` - deterministic project workflow settings
- `blueprint/context/project-overview.md` - the project's source of truth
- `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md` - read before changing code
- `blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md` - read when running the Blueprint workflow
- `blueprint/context/current-feature.md` - the one feature, fix, or rollback being built right now

Reuse relevant context already loaded in the session. Claude Code imports only
this file; its Blueprint skills load the other files on demand.

## Project configuration

`blueprint/config.json` is the user-owned, machine-readable workflow policy for
this project. Workflow skills read the relevant settings before acting. A
missing file means built-in defaults. An invalid file falls back to defaults for
read-only status reporting, but mutating workflow commands stop and point to
`/doctor` instead of guessing.

Configuration can make review or verification stricter and can tune local
branch names and automated-mode limits. It never grants permission to commit,
merge, push, deploy, publish, send, delete data, waive a failing check, or accept
a finding. Those approval and safety boundaries are not configurable.

`qualityGates.regular` controls automatic audit, independent-review, check, and
try-guide behavior for the normal workflow and Autopilot.
`qualityGates.continuous` controls the same per-feature gates for Continuous
Mode. Independent review defaults to `when-sensitive` in both workflows, while
audit, check, and try guide default to `manual`. Sensitive or unusually broad
work therefore selects independent review automatically; ordinary small work
does not. Setting a workflow's independent review to `manual` disables that
automatic selection, while an explicit `/audit independent current` remains
available. The other conditional modes are `when-sensitive` for audit,
`when-behavioral` for check, and `when-user-facing` for try guides. `always`
runs the gate for every work item in that workflow.

`review.independentExecution` controls how a selected independent-review gate
runs. Its default, `automatic`, uses a fresh isolated reviewer child when the
active adapter can prove isolation, exact reviewer identity and model, and
completion. Otherwise it preserves the request and falls back to the manual
handoff. This setting changes execution only; the quality-gate policy still
decides whether review is selected.
The automatic path spawns a generic child through the current runtime and gives
it the installed project-local Audit skill and review contract. It never requires
or discovers global agent roles, skills, prompts, or TraversyFlow components.
New review requests record requested execution and completed receipts record
actual execution. Manual uses `fresh session`; automatic uses `fresh subagent`;
an explicit automatic fallback records actual manual with `fresh session`.

New projects default to one review packet after all small implementation steps
(`workflow.stepReview: "feature"`) with step checkpoint commits disabled. This
keeps the normal loop reviewable without repeating the full session context after
every step. Set `stepReview` to `every` when teaching, pairing closely, or working
on a high-risk change. That restores the per-step approval pauses. To fully
restore the previous workflow, including optional checkpoint prompts after an
approved step, also set `checkpointCommits` to `enabled`. Onboarding presents
these pairs as Efficient and Guided choices, but stores only the two low-level
settings. They can be changed at any time. Both styles end with an optional
read-only code walkthrough. Review cadence controls approval pauses, not whether
the user can ask for an explanation of the finished implementation.

## Workflow

Build one feature, fix, or rollback at a time, behind review gates. Each step's instructions
are plain markdown skills any capable agent can read and follow. The workflow is
exposed through tool-specific adapters:

- Codex: `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
- Claude Code: `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
- GitHub Copilot: `AGENTS.md` plus `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
- OpenCode: `AGENTS.md` plus the compatible `.agents/skills/` or
  `.claude/skills/` tree already installed for the selected tools

Unused adapters can be removed. Codex, GitHub Copilot, and OpenCode can share
