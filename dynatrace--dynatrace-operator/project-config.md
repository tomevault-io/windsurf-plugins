## Dynatrace MCP interaction instructions

### DQL query guidance

* When asked about vulnerabilities, try to get the data by querying the `security.events` table.
* Load and use the sample queries as the baseline from: https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/security-events-examples
* Few concrete examples:

  1. Get the open vulnerabilities reported by Dynatrace RVA (Runtime Vulnerability Analytics) directly or indirectly affecting a specific host (in this example, i-05f1305a50721e04d).

  ```fetch security.events
  | filter dt.system.bucket=="default_securityevents_builtin"
      AND event.provider=="Dynatrace"
      AND event.type=="VULNERABILITY_STATE_REPORT_EVENT"
      AND event.level=="ENTITY"
  // filter for the latest snapshot per entity
  | dedup {vulnerability.display_id, affected_entity.id}, sort:{timestamp desc}
  // filter for open non-muted vulnerabilities
  | filter vulnerability.resolution.status == "OPEN"
      AND vulnerability.parent.mute.status != "MUTED"
      AND vulnerability.mute.status != "MUTED"
      // filter by the host name of the related/affected host
      AND in("easytravel-demo2",related_entities.hosts.names) OR affected_entity.name=="easytravel-demo2"
  // now summarize on the vulnerability level
  | summarize{
      vulnerability.risk.score=round(takeMax(vulnerability.risk.score),decimals:1),
      vulnerability.title=takeFirst(vulnerability.title),
      vulnerability.references.cve=takeFirst(vulnerability.references.cve),
      last_detected=coalesce(takeMax(vulnerability.resolution.change_date),takeMax(vulnerability.parent.first_seen)),
      affected_entities=countDistinctExact(affected_entity.id),
      vulnerable_function_in_use=if(in("IN_USE",collectArray(vulnerability.davis_assessment.vulnerable_function_status)),true, else:false),
      public_internet_exposure=if(in("PUBLIC_NETWORK",collectArray(vulnerability.davis_assessment.exposure_status)),true,else:false),
      public_exploit_available=if(in("AVAILABLE",collectArray(vulnerability.davis_assessment.exploit_status)),true,else:false),
      data_assets_within_reach=if(in("REACHABLE",collectArray(vulnerability.davis_assessment.data_assets_status)),true,else:false)
  }, by: {vulnerability.display_id}
  // map the risk level
  | fieldsAdd vulnerability.risk.level=if(vulnerability.risk.score>=9,"CRITICAL",
                                      else:if(vulnerability.risk.score>=7,"HIGH",
                                      else:if(vulnerability.risk.score>=4,"MEDIUM",
                                      else:if(vulnerability.risk.score>=0.1,"LOW",
                                      else:"NONE"))))
  | sort {vulnerability.risk.score, direction:"descending"}, {affected_entities, direction:"descending"}
  ```

  2. Query for security events for a specific vulnerability (CVE-2023-41419) from Dynatrace RVA:

  ```fetch security.events
  | filter dt.system.bucket=="default_securityevents_builtin"
      AND event.provider=="Dynatrace"
      AND event.type=="VULNERABILITY_STATE_REPORT_EVENT"
      AND event.level=="ENTITY"
  // filter for the latest snapshot per entity
  | dedup {vulnerability.display_id, affected_entity.id}, sort:{timestamp desc}
  | filter in("CVE-2023-41419",vulnerability.references.cve)
  // filter for open non-muted vulnerabilities
  | filter vulnerability.resolution.status == "OPEN"
      AND vulnerability.parent.mute.status != "MUTED"
      AND vulnerability.mute.status != "MUTED"
  ```

### Entity information reporting

* When reporting an entity, include the name of the entity and its ID in the format name (ID).

### Security vulnerability analysis

* When verifying a vulnerability with Dynatrace, ensure to include the Davis score, risk level and the Davis assessments, whether the exploit is available, and whether the function is in use in the report.
* Always emphasize the fact that the vulnerability confirmed in Dynatrace is loaded in running processes and applications, which should increase the priority of its fix.

### Dependabot vulnerabilities verification

* When verifying a vulnerability found by Dependabot with Dynatrace:
  * First, query running entities, such as Kubernetes container (`dt.entity.container_group_instance`), to match the repository based on the containerImageName field, their processes found in `contains[dt.entity.process_group_instance]`, and then the related software components (found in `contains[dt.entity.software_component]`); to confirm the library is loaded and running.
  * Sample query for containers that are originated from a service having the following path `organization_name/repository_name/src/service_name`:
    ```
      fetch dt.entity.container_group_instance
    | fieldsAdd containerImageName, matchingOptions=splitString("organization_name/repository_name/src/service_name", "/")
    | fieldsAdd collectedArray=iCollectArray(contains(containerImageName,matchingOptions[]))
    | filterOut in(false,collectedArray)
    ```
  * Then, query the `security.events` table to find a match of each Dependabot vulnerability CVE separately within the `vulnerability.references.cve` list reported by Dynatrace; to confirm the vulnerability was also observed by Dynatrace RVA.
