# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repo contains a Bun-powered bridge and a React/Vite frontend for Herdr.
Frontend code lives in `web/src`, with reusable UI under `web/src/components`,
assets under `web/src/assets`, and styling split between `web/src/styles`
(theme tokens, base primitives, vendor overrides, app-shell layout) and
co-located `web/src/components/*.css` files (see the style organization
guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
Server and bridge code lives in `server/src`. Release helpers live in `scripts/`.
Generated build output belongs in `web/dist`, `server/public`,
`server/src/public-files.gen.ts`, `server/roamgate*`, legacy `server/herdr-gui*`,
and `dist/`; these paths
are ignored and should not be committed.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Install all Bun workspace dependencies from the repository root with
`bun install --frozen-lockfile` (Bun 1.4.1 or newer). The root `bun.lock` is the
only lockfile; shared TypeScript, Bun types, and lint/format tooling belong in
the root manifest. Keep runtime dependencies in their owning workspace.

- `bun run dev:web`: start the Vite frontend on port 5173.
- `bun run dev:server`: start the Bun bridge with hot reload.
- `bun run build`: build frontend assets and the default standalone server binary.
- `bun run build:linux-x64`: build the Linux x86-64 standalone binary.
- `bun run build:darwin-arm64`: build the macOS Apple Silicon binary.
- `bun run package:linux-x64`: build and emit both versioned and latest `tar.xz`
  archives and checksums in `dist/`.
- `bun run package:linux-arm64`, `package:darwin-x64`,
  `package:darwin-arm64`, `package:windows-x64`, and
  `package:windows-arm64`: package the other supported release targets.
- `bun run format [paths...]`: format the given paths with the pinned root
  Biome config, or all supported files when no paths are given.
- `bun run format:check [paths...]`: check formatting with the same path scope.
- `bun run lint`: lint JavaScript, TypeScript, and React code with Oxlint.
- `bun run test`: run all unit and server integration tests serially.
- `bun run test:quick`: run the same complete suite with four workers.
- `bun run typecheck`: build/embed web assets and run all TypeScript checks.
- `bun run typecheck:quick`: check types without rebuilding existing web assets.
  See [local validation](CONTRIBUTING.md#validation) for prerequisites and caching.
- `bun run precommit`: run formatting, lint, full type checks, and `test:quick`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use TypeScript, React function components, and the existing CSS class naming
style. Format supported files with the root `biome.json`; do not rely on a
global or editor fallback formatter. Prefer small, focused components in
`web/src/components`. Keep manual edits ASCII unless the file already uses
non-ASCII text. Use existing store and bridge helpers before adding new
abstractions.

## Documentation Guidelines

Keep `README.md` concise and English-only. Use it as the project entry point and
link to focused documents instead of embedding detailed operation or
implementation material. Put the feature tour and shortcuts in `FEATURES.md`,
deployment and configuration instructions in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, and system
contracts in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Permanent docs describe current supported
behavior and contracts, not task status, plans, phases, dated verification logs,
or agent transcripts; keep those details in PRs, external artifacts, or Git
history. Add a focused document only when an enduring topic cannot fit an
existing home. Keep one canonical home per topic and link to it. When finishing
work, consolidate or delete stale status documents and repair their links.

## Testing Guidelines

Tests live beside their modules as `*.test.ts` and use `bun:test`. During local
iteration, run a related file with `bun test <path>` or use `bun run test:quick`.
Process-level tests need generated web assets; on a fresh checkout, run
`bun run typecheck` once after installing dependencies to generate them.
Automated tests do not launch browsers; validate affected UI and browser security
behavior manually against a real backend using the checklist in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
Use Bun's fake timers for timer deadlines and events for socket readiness rather
than waiting out production timeouts; restore real timers in `finally`.
Run `bun run precommit` before committing; `test:quick` alone does not replace
its formatting, lint, and type checks.
The installed pre-commit hook runs this gate, so do not also run it manually
immediately before committing an unchanged revision. See the iteration workflow
in [local validation](CONTRIBUTING.md#validation).
For frontend-facing work, also run `bun run build:web`. Release work must package
and inspect every supported platform archive and checksum.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Git history uses concise imperative messages, for example `Use built-in CLI
argument parser` or `Add command palette and release 0.0.3`. Keep commits
focused and mention user-visible behavior in the message when relevant. PR
descriptions should include a short summary and verification commands.
Screenshots are not required for UI changes; capture or upload them only when
