# Trish — Tic-Tac-Toe in Bash

## Istruzioni per agenti AI

- **Stack**: Bash puro, stile funzionale, zero dipendenze esterne
- **Test**: `./test_tictactoe.sh` — deve restare 47/47 PASSED
- **Regola TDD obbligatoria**: scrivi test rosso che fallisce → implementa → verde → commit
- **Non aggiungere** dipendenze esterne (no bats, no shunit2, no npm)
- **Framework test** self-contained in `test_tools.sh` — non modificarlo senza test
- **Gate bloccante**: nessun commit se `./test_tictactoe.sh` non è 47/47 (o N/N dopo nuovi test)
- **Stile**: pipe come data bus, no global mutable state, funzioni pure con stdin/stdout

## Comandi principali
```bash
./test_tictactoe.sh          # esegui tutti i test
./tictactoe.sh               # il gioco (funzioni pure)
```

## TODO aperti (candidati per /start-task)

1. Aggiungi `checkDraw` — ritorna "draw" se board piena e nessun winner
2. Aggiungi `printBoard` — renderer visuale della board
3. Aggiungi `gameLoop` — loop interattivo stdin
4. Profila test execution e ottimizza `filter` ricorsivo
5. Generalizza a N×N (ORDER come parametro)
6. CI badge con risultati test auto-aggiornati

## Improvement suggestions

### 1. Explicit draw result
`checkWinner` returns an empty string for both _"no winner yet"_ and _"draw"_.
Add a helper that checks if the board is full to distinguish the two cases:

```bash
function isBoardFull {
    local -r board=$(read_input)
    [ $(echo "$board" | count "$NONE") -eq 0 ]
}
```

### 2. Visual board renderer
Printing the raw string `1 _ _ 2 _ _ _ _ _` is hard to read during a game session.
A thin formatter would make the project immediately more usable:

```bash
function printBoard {
    local -r b=($(read_input))
    echo "+---+---+---+"
    for row in 0 1 2; do
        printf "| %s | %s | %s |\n" ${b[$((row*3))]} ${b[$((row*3+1))]} ${b[$((row*3+2))]}
        echo "+---+---+---+"
    done
}
```

### 3. Interactive game loop
Wrap game/play/checkWinner into a `gameLoop` that reads coordinates from stdin:

```bash
function gameLoop {
    local board=$(game)
    while true; do
        read -r player row col
        board=$(echo "$board" | play "$player" "$row" "$col")
        echo "$board" | printBoard
        local w=$(echo "$board" | checkWinner)
        [ -n "$w" ] && echo "Winner: $w" && break
    done
}
```

### 4. Test execution speed
The heavy use of subshells (`$(...)`) and recursive calls in `filter`/`winner`
adds noticeable overhead. Three concrete options:

| Approach | Effort | Speed gain |
|---|---|---|
| Cache `$(nextPlayer)` per test | Low | Small |
| Replace recursive `filter` with a loop | Medium | Large |
| Use `[[ ... ]]` instead of `[ ... ]` | Low | Small |

### 5. Parametric board size
`ORDER=3` is a constant, but `sortItem`'s math already generalises.
Expose it as an argument to `game` and test for a 4×4 board to prove
the invariant holds beyond 3×3.

## Testing technique analysis — how to reuse these patterns

### Pattern 1 — Pipe-based assertion chain

```bash
assert_that $(expr) | is "expected"
```

The `assert_that / is` pair models an **expectation builder** entirely in Bash.
`assert_that` evaluates an expression and writes its output; `is` reads from
stdin and compares. This avoids global state and is composable.

**Reusable in any Bash project** that has functions returning values through
`echo`. Examples: config parsers, file processors, CLI tools.

### Pattern 2 — Self-contained framework (no external deps)

`test_tools.sh` is sourced before game code. The framework itself has tests
(`desc_should_return_passed`, `id_should_return_input_string`, …).
This "test the tests" bootstrap gives confidence that assertion failures are
real, not framework bugs.

**Reuse tip:** copy `test_tools.sh` as a minimal dependency into any shell
project that cannot install `bats` or `shunit2`.

### Pattern 3 — Exact output testing via `is`

Game state is a string (`1 _ _ 2 _ _ _ _ _`). Tests assert the whole board
string, not just one cell. This documents the _full observable effect_ of each
operation and catches accidental side effects.

**Reuse tip:** wherever your Bash function produces a structured string (CSV
line, JSON fragment, log record), test the exact output string. Avoid partial
matching unless intentional.

### Pattern 4 — Boundary values for numeric helpers

`testSkipZero`, `testTakeZero`, `testNearestLower4Multiple` test _n = 0_ and
border values around multiples. Standard boundary-value analysis applied to
arithmetic Bash functions.

**Reuse tip:** every `$((...))` expression in shell scripts has edge cases
(integer division, modulo of 0, negative numbers). Always add a test for
_n = 0_, _n = 1_, and the first value that crosses a branch.

### Pattern 5 — Functors as first-class parameters

`filter isEven` and `filter isMultipleOfFour` pass a function name as a
string. This simulates **higher-order functions** in Bash. Tests for `sortItem`
cover all three branches of the dispatching logic independently.

**Reuse tip:** if a Bash function accepts a callback name, write one test per
callback variant. Mock the callback with a trivial echo function to isolate
the routing logic from the callback logic.

### Pattern 6 — Scenario-driven integration tests

`testCanDetectNoughtWinner`, `testDraw`, and `testNoWinnerYet` compose multiple
`play` calls into a scenario and assert the final state. This is
**scenario-based / black-box** testing layered on top of unit tests.

**Reuse tip:** after unit-testing all primitives, write at least three
scenario tests: _happy path_, _edge case_, _failure case_. For a game engine,
that maps to _someone wins_, _draw_, _invalid input_.

## What you might have had in mind — and where to go from here

### What you were probably thinking during development

- **Start functional, stay functional.** You chose to avoid `if/else` in favour
  of `trueFalse` + `when`, and avoided global mutable state entirely. This was
  a deliberate exploration of how far pure composition goes in Bash.
- **TDD from the very first function.** The test framework was built before (or
  alongside) the game code. The game functions were shaped by what was easy
  to assert, not the other way around.
- **Pipe as the data bus.** Every function reads from stdin and writes to
  stdout. This mirrors the Unix philosophy and allows arbitrary chaining:
  `game | play 1 0 0 | play 2 1 1 | checkWinner`.
- **`sortVertically` as the cleverness peak.** The index-math trick in
  `sortItem` (using nearest multiples of 4) is the most non-obvious piece.
  You probably spent the most design time here.

### What you could do right now to move forward

1. **Add a `checkDraw` function** that returns `"draw"` when the board is full
   and `checkWinner` is empty. One test needed: `testCheckDraw`.

2. **Write a game loop script** (`play.sh`) that calls `gameLoop` and lets two
   humans play in a terminal — the engine is complete, only the UI wrapper is
   missing.

3. **Write the tutorial** (listed in TODO). The commit history and test names
   already tell the story; the tutorial would be: one test → one function →
   next test. The pipe-based style is genuinely unusual and worth documenting.

4. **Publish to GitHub Pages or similar** with an automatically updated test
   badge. The CI pipeline would be: `bash test_tictactoe.sh | tee results.txt`,
   with the result embedded in the README via a GitHub Action.

5. **Profile the test run** (`time bash test_tictactoe.sh`) and identify the
   slowest three tests. Replace the recursive `filter` with a loop and measure
   the speedup — this directly addresses the "Test execution is slow" TODO.

6. **Generalise to N×N** — try `ORDER=4` and add `testCanDetectWinnerAtRow_4x4`.
   The sortItem math already hints at a general formula.
