# Open Food Facts Mobile App (Smooth App) - Flutter Development Guide

Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you
encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

This is a comprehensive Flutter mobile application for Open Food Facts, supporting Android and iOS
platforms. The app uses a multi-package architecture with scanner integrations, app store
variations, and extensive testing infrastructure.

## Essential Setup and Environment

### Flutter Version Management

- **CRITICAL**: This app requires Flutter version **3.44.8** exactly (as specified in
  `flutter-version.txt`)
- **ALWAYS** use FVM (Flutter Version Management) for consistent Flutter versions:
  ```bash
  # Install FVM first: https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation
  fvm install 3.44.8
  fvm use 3.44.8
  fvm flutter --version  # Should show Flutter 3.44.8
  ```
- Export Flutter to PATH: `export PATH="$(fvm flutter sdk-path)/bin:$PATH"`

### Initial Repository Setup

- **NEVER CANCEL**: Initial Flutter setup takes 5-10 minutes. WAIT for completion.
- Navigate to the main app directory: `cd packages/smooth_app`
- Install dependencies: `fvm flutter pub get .` (takes 2-3 minutes)

### Required System Dependencies

- Java JDK 21 (for Android builds)
- Android SDK (if building for Android)
- Xcode (if building for iOS on macOS)
- Git (for dependency management)

## Build Commands - VALIDATED

### Dependency Management

```bash
# Update all package dependencies (PREFERRED method)
./ci/pub_upgrade.sh
# NEVER CANCEL: Takes 3-5 minutes across all packages
```

### Running the Application

```bash
cd packages/smooth_app

# Android (Google Play variant) - DEFAULT
fvm flutter run -t lib/entrypoints/android/main_google_play.dart
# NEVER CANCEL: Initial build takes 10-15 minutes, subsequent builds 2-3 minutes

# iOS variant
fvm flutter run -t lib/entrypoints/ios/main_ios.dart  
# NEVER CANCEL: Initial build takes 15-20 minutes, subsequent builds 3-5 minutes

# Debug mode (faster startup)
fvm flutter run --debug -t lib/entrypoints/android/main_google_play.dart
```

### Scanner Dependencies Configuration

The app supports different barcode scanner implementations. Choose one:

```bash
# Enable ML Kit scanner (default, requires Google services)
./ci/dependencies/scanner/enable_mlkit_dependency.sh

# Enable ZXing scanner (open source alternative)  
./ci/dependencies/scanner/enable_zxing_dependency.sh

# ALWAYS run flutter pub get after changing scanner dependencies
cd packages/smooth_app && fvm flutter pub get .
```

### App Store Variants Configuration

Choose the appropriate app store configuration:

```bash
# Google Play Store (default)
./ci/dependencies/app_store/enable_google_play_dependency.sh

# Apple App Store  
./ci/dependencies/app_store/enable_apple_app_store_dependency.sh

# URI store (for F-Droid and others)
./ci/dependencies/app_store/enable_uri_store_dependency.sh
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Code Formatting and Analysis

```bash
# Format code (REQUIRED before commits)
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .
# Returns exit code 1 if formatting needed

# Analyze code for issues (REQUIRED before commits)
fvm flutter analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings .
# NEVER CANCEL: Analysis takes 1-2 minutes
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
./ci/testing.sh
# NEVER CANCEL: Complete test suite takes 5-8 minutes

# Run tests for specific package
cd packages/smooth_app && fvm flutter test --coverage
# NEVER CANCEL: Main app tests take 3-4 minutes

# Integration tests (with screenshots)
fvm flutter drive --driver=test_driver/screenshot_driver.dart --target=integration_test/app_test.dart
# NEVER CANCEL: Integration tests take 2-3 minutes
```

## Development Workflow

### Pre-Commit Validation (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS** run these commands before committing changes:

```bash
# 1. Format code
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .

# 2. Analyze for issues  
fvm flutter analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings .

# 3. Run relevant tests
./ci/testing.sh

# Total time: 8-12 minutes. NEVER CANCEL any of these steps.
```

### Build Troubleshooting

If you encounter build issues:

1. **Clear Flutter cache**: `fvm flutter clean` (takes 30 seconds)
2. **Reinstall dependencies**: `fvm flutter pub get .` (takes 2-3 minutes)
3. **Clear pub cache**: `fvm flutter pub cache clean` (takes 1 minute)
4. **Reset to clean state**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/smooth_app
   fvm flutter clean
   fvm flutter pub get .
   ```
