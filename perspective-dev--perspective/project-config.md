# LLM and agent-driven analytics

<!-- description: Perspective's perspective-viewer includes an opt-in LLM agent which turns plain-language questions into pivots, filters, expressions and charts by driving the viewer's public API.

`<perspective-viewer>` ships with an embedded LLM agent. A user types "show me
monthly revenue by region as a stacked bar, top five only", and the agent
reads the table's schema, writes the view configuration, authors any computed
columns it needs, picks the chart, and applies it — through the same public
API your own code would use.

It is **opt-in**. The Chat tab stays hidden and no network request is made
until you configure a model:

```javascript
import { providers } from "@perspective-dev/viewer";

const viewer = document.querySelector("perspective-viewer");
viewer.agentConfig({
    ...providers.anthropic,
    apiKey: "sk-ant-...",
});
```

## Why an agent fits Perspective

An LLM is good at translating intent into a small, structured configuration,
and unreliable at arithmetic over data it has to read. Perspective's
configuration is exactly that kind of target: a complete analysis — grouping,
column splits, aggregates, filters, sorts, expressions, chart type — is a few
lines of JSON, and the numbers are computed by the engine, not the model.

- The agent's tools read the table's schema and the viewer's configuration —
  none of them read rows, so your data is not sent to the model.
- Every answer is an ordinary, inspectable viewer configuration. The user can
  see exactly what was grouped and filtered, adjust it by hand, and save it.
- Because the engine is incremental, an agent-built view over streaming data
  keeps updating after the conversation ends.

## Any model, including local ones

The agent speaks the OpenAI chat-completions convention, so it works with
Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini and OpenRouter endpoints, with local servers such as
[Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), llama.cpp and
vLLM, and with in-page engines such as
[WebLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm) — in which case the data, the
query engine and the model all run inside the browser tab.

## Keys and production use

A key passed to `agentConfig` is a key in the browser. That is fine for local
development and internal tools; for anything shared, point `url` at a proxy
you control and keep the credential on the server. See
[Configuring the LLM agent](../how_to/javascript/agent.md) for the full
connection options.

## Driving Perspective from your own agent

The agent uses no private hooks. `restore()`, `save()`, `Table.schema()` and
`View` are the complete surface, and a view configuration is plain JSON — so
an external agent, a notebook assistant or an MCP tool can produce the same
results by emitting a `ViewerConfig`. The guide is published for that purpose
as Markdown at [`/llms.txt`](https://perspective-dev.github.io/llms.txt) and
[`/llms-full.txt`](https://perspective-dev.github.io/llms-full.txt).
