- **Stop When Fixed: Know When to Step Back**
  - Like a salesperson who stops talking once the sale is made, stop changing code once the issue is fixed
  - Unnecessary "improvements" risk introducing new bugs and complications
  - When tests pass and requirements are met, the task is complete

- **Signs It's Time to Stop**
  - ✅ The original issue is verifiably fixed
  - ✅ Tests pass and the feature works as expected
  - ✅ The code is reasonably clean and maintainable
  - ✅ User/client has confirmed the solution works

- **Resist the Urge to "Perfect" Working Code**
  ```go
  // ✅ DO: Stop when the problem is solved
  func SaveUserPreference(userID string, preference string) error {
    // Simple solution that works reliably
    return db.SavePreference(userID, preference)
  }
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Keep "improving" after the fix
  func SaveUserPreference(userID string, preference string) error {
    // Unnecessary complexity added after the fix
    metrics.TrackEvent("save_preference_attempt")
    if cached, err := cache.GetPreference(userID); err == nil && cached == preference {
      return nil // Unneeded optimization
    }
    err := db.SavePreference(userID, preference)
    if err == nil {
      cache.SetPreference(userID, preference) // Added caching that wasn't required
      metrics.TrackEvent("save_preference_success")
    }
    return err
  }
  ```

- **Document What Works and Why**
  - When a solution works, document it clearly
  - Explain the approach that succeeded and any failed attempts
  - This helps future developers understand why decisions were made

- **When Refactoring is Appropriate**
  - Only refactor working code as a separate, deliberate task
  - Get the original fix approved and merged first
  - Create a new task specifically for refactoring or improvements
  - Ensure thorough testing of any refactoring changes

- **The Principle of Minimum Viable Fixes**
  - The best fix is often the simplest one that reliably solves the problem
  - Complex solutions create more potential points of failure
  - Optimize for readability and maintainability, not cleverness
