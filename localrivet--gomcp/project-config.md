# No Background Processes Rule

**CRITICAL: Never run any programs, servers, or processes in the background**

## **Strict Prohibitions**

- **❌ NEVER use `&` to run commands in background**
- **❌ NEVER use `nohup` or similar background process tools**
- **❌ NEVER set `is_background: true` in terminal commands**
- **❌ NEVER run servers, applications, or long-running processes in background**
- **❌ NEVER use `screen`, `tmux`, or detached sessions**

## **Why This Rule Exists**

- **Debugging Difficulty**: Background processes make it impossible to see real-time output and errors
- **Process Management**: Background processes can become orphaned and difficult to stop
- **User Control**: Users need to see what's happening and control when processes start/stop
- **Resource Management**: Hidden background processes consume system resources unknowingly

## **Correct Approaches**

- **✅ Run processes in foreground** so output is visible
- **✅ Use `Ctrl+C` to stop processes** when needed
- **✅ Ask user before starting any long-running process**
- **✅ Explain what will happen** before running commands
- **✅ Use short-lived commands** when possible

## **Examples**

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Background process
go run main.go &
npm run dev &

# ✅ CORRECT - Foreground process
go run main.go
npm run dev

# ❌ WRONG - Background with timeout
timeout 10 go run main.go &

# ✅ CORRECT - Ask user to run manually
echo "Please run 'go run main.go' in a separate terminal"
```

## **When Long-Running Processes Are Needed**

- **Ask the user** to run the command in a separate terminal
- **Provide clear instructions** on what command to run
- **Explain why** the process needs to run
- **Give guidance** on how to stop it when done

## **Emergency Exception**

The ONLY exception is if the user explicitly requests a background process and understands the implications. Even then, prefer asking them to run it manually.

**This rule has NO exceptions for convenience - user visibility and control always takes priority.**
