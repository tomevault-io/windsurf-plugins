description: Goal-driven execution — define verifiable success criteria, loop until passing

# Goal-Driven Execution

Adapted from Karpathy's coding-skills repo. The most important behavior change for any agent working in this codebase.

## The standard

**Transform tasks into verifiable goals.** Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification and bounce back.

| Vague task | Verifiable goal |
|---|---|
| "Add validation" | "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass" |
| "Fix the bug" | "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass" |
| "Refactor X" | "Ensure tests pass before and after" |
| "Speed it up" | "Add a benchmark, baseline N ms, target ≤ N/2 ms" |
| "Make it more reliable" | "Add a test for the failure mode I just hit, watch it fail, fix until it passes" |

## For multi-step tasks, state the plan

Before writing code:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Each verify step is something you can run. Tests, lints, a curl against the dev server, a manual screenshot match — anything that proves the step is done.

## Example — fixing a portfolio bug (April 2026)

Bad: "Fix portfolio_analysis to include DeFi correctly."

Good:
```
1. Repro the bug → verify: live `/api/portfolio` returns `defiValueUsd: 0` with `defiSource: 'partial'`
2. Add a regression test asserting portfolio_analysis re-fetches when source != 'blockvision' AND value == 0 → verify: test fails on current code
3. Fix the trust gate in portfolio-analysis.ts → verify: test passes
4. Verify no other tests regressed → verify: pnpm --filter @t2000/engine test → 0 failures
5. Verify live behavior → verify: re-run `/api/portfolio` against the test wallet → `defiValueUsd > 0`
```

The verify steps catch (a) the wrong fix and (b) the right fix in the wrong place. Without them, you'd be re-confirming success-by-vibes for the third time.

## When to ask vs. when to proceed

**Ask when:**
- Multiple valid interpretations of the goal exist (e.g. "make the chip flow nicer" — UX choice).
- The goal touches a system you're not 100% sure about (architectural ambiguity).
- The fix requires changing a load-bearing API signature.

**Proceed when:**
- The goal is unambiguous and the verify step is obvious.
- Existing tests + code conventions tell you which approach matches the codebase.
- The change is local to one file with one obvious entry point.

## What's banned

- "Done!" without running the verify step.
- "I think this works" without running tests.
- "Should be fine" without re-reading the diff.
- Closing the loop on a partial fix because "the user can tell me if anything's wrong."
