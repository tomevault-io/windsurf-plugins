description: Savings is USDC-or-USDsui only — engine tools and prompts must enforce this. USDsui is a strategic exception; USDC remains the canonical default.

# Savings = USDC or USDsui (Engine)

> **Strategic exception (v0.51.0+):** USDsui is permitted alongside USDC for `save_deposit` and `borrow`. The USDC-canonical thesis still applies to **every other asset** (GOLD, SUI, USDT, USDe, ETH, NAVX, WAL): they are holdable/swappable but **never** saveable.
>
> Why USDsui is the exception: it's the only other Sui-native stable with a productive NAVI pool (USDC pool ~4.6% APY, USDsui pool variable, often higher). Adding it as a saveable asset captures yield optimization without inviting "save anything stable" creep (which would pull in USDe/USDT and break the simplicity invariant).

## balance_check tool

Must return `saveableUsdc` field (USDC wallet balance — the canonical saveable). The `displayText` must distinguish:
- **Wallet holdings** (GOLD, SUI, USDT, USDe, ETH, etc.) — tokens in the wallet, NOT savings, NOT saveable
- **NAVI savings deposits** — USDC and/or USDsui deposited into NAVI earning yield
- **Saveable USDC** — the USDC amount that CAN be saved
- **USDsui balance** (if present) — also saveable, surface it in the holdings list with a "(saveable)" tag

```typescript
// ❌ BAD — LLM confuses holdings with savings, treats USDsui as a regular holding
displayText: `Balance: $${total} (Available: $${available}, Savings: $${savings})`

// ✅ GOOD — explicit separation, USDsui flagged as saveable
displayText: `Wallet holdings (NOT savings): GOLD ${gold}, SUI ${sui}, USDsui ${usdsui} (saveable). NAVI savings: $${savings}. Saveable USDC: ${usdc} USDC.`
```

## System prompt

Must include a "Savings = USDC or USDsui" section that tells the LLM:
- Only **USDC or USDsui** can be saved via `save_deposit` and used as collateral via `borrow`
- Wallet holdings ≠ savings positions (the same NAVI pool may contain both deposits and the user's own holdings — but only the deposit row earns APY)
- Never say non-saveable tokens (GOLD, SUI, USDT, etc.) are "earning APY in savings"
- When asked "how much can I save?", report `saveableUsdc` plus the user's USDsui wallet balance, separately
- USDsui pool APY can differ from USDC; if user asks "best stable to save", call `rates_info` to compare

## save_deposit + borrow + repay_debt tools

Description must:
- Accept `asset: 'USDC' | 'USDsui'` (default `'USDC'` when omitted, except `repay_debt` where omitting means "highest-APY borrow")
- Reject every other asset with a clear error
- Explicitly forbid auto-chaining swap + deposit / swap + repay (the user decides which stable to save or repay)
- For "save 10 USDC" — execute as USDC. For "save 10 USDsui" — execute as USDsui. Never silently substitute.
- For "save 10" (no asset specified) — call `balance_check` first, then ask the user which stable they want (or default to whichever they hold more of, with a one-line explanation).
- **Repay symmetry (v0.51.1+):** A USDsui debt MUST be repaid with USDsui (and USDC debt with USDC). The SDK fetches the correct coin type for the targeted asset, but the user must hold enough of that stable. If they hold only the wrong stable, tell them to swap manually first — never auto-chain.

## Adding new assets

When adding assets to the token registry, they are holdable/swappable but **NOT saveable** — even other stables (USDe, USDT). Only USDC and USDsui go through `save_deposit` / `borrow`. This is enforced by `assertAllowedAsset('save', asset)` and `assertAllowedAsset('borrow', asset)` in `packages/sdk/src/constants.ts`.

To extend the saveable set in the future (e.g., a hypothetical USDe-on-NAVI pool), update `OPERATION_ASSETS.save` and `OPERATION_ASSETS.borrow` in `packages/sdk/src/constants.ts` AND revisit this rule — don't bypass the allow-list.
