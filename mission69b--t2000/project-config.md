# BlockVision Resilience

BlockVision Pro is the data source for the entire wallet portfolio + multi-token price feed. It periodically returns 429 under burst load (per-second key limit AND a global edge throttle that fires even under quota). All BlockVision calls MUST go through `fetchBlockVisionWithRetry` in `packages/engine/src/blockvision-prices.ts`.

## The contract — three layers of resilience

### Layer 1 — Retry with jittered exponential backoff

```
attempt 1: fire immediately
attempt 2: wait 250ms ± 25% jitter
attempt 3: wait 750ms ± 25% jitter (and final attempt)
```

- Honors `Retry-After` header up to 5s cap.
- Each `fetch()` carries its own `AbortSignal.timeout()` independent of retry sleep.
- Retries on 429 + 5xx only. Other errors propagate immediately.

### Layer 2 — Circuit breaker

After **10 429s within a 5s rolling window**, the circuit opens for **30s**. While open:
- New 429s are returned as final (no retry).
- Subsequent calls don't fire BlockVision at all — they fall through to the fallback path.
- Per-process state (intentional) — global Redis coordination would add hot-path latency.

Why: naive retry amplifies BV load 3x during sustained outages. At 1k+ users that's a self-inflicted DoS.

### Layer 3 — Layered fallback

If BlockVision `/account/coins` returns 429/5xx OR the `apiKey` is missing/blank:

1. Drop to Sui-RPC for the coin list.
2. Still attempt BV `/coin/price/list` to USD-price non-stable holdings (separate rate limit, frequent cache hit).
3. Only when BOTH BV endpoints fail, degrade to hardcoded stable allow-list (USDC/USDT/USDe/USDsui = $1.00, everything else `null`).

The returned portfolio carries a `source` field: `'blockvision' | 'sui-rpc-degraded' | 'partial'` so callers can decide whether to badge "approximate" totals.

## Sticky-positive cache rule (DeFi)

`DefiCacheStore` stores the last known-good positive value for 30 minutes (`DEFI_STICKY_TTL_SEC`).

| Source        | TTL    | Write rule |
|---------------|--------|------------|
| `blockvision` | 60s    | Always wins. Positive values flow through immediately. |
| `partial-stale` | 60s | Used when BV returns success but with missing protocol data. |
| `sui-rpc-degraded` | 15s | **Never overwrites a known-good positive within the sticky window.** Prevents BV throttle blips from poisoning the cache with $0. |

The wallet portfolio cache uses the same pattern — see PR 1+2 in `audric-scaling-spec.md`.

## When `fetch_*` tools see degraded data

```typescript
// In a tool's call handler:
const portfolio = await fetchAddressPortfolio(address, ctx.blockvisionApiKey);

if (portfolio.source !== 'blockvision') {
  // Surface degradation to the user — don't silently lie about the total.
  return {
    data: { ... },
    displayText: `Wallet (~approximate, ${portfolio.source}): ...`,
  };
}
```

`portfolio_analysis` MUST treat `partial + 0` DeFi as untrusted and re-fetch via `fetchAddressDefiPortfolio`. See `packages/engine/src/tools/portfolio-analysis.ts` trust gate.

## When `BLOCKVISION_API_KEY` is empty

- `apps/web/lib/env.ts` (audric) makes it `requiredString` — boot fails before any request runs. **Do not relax to optional** unless you also accept the entire DeFi/wallet pricing stack degrading to RPC.
- This is the S.25 incident class — see `env-validation-gate.mdc`.

## What's banned

```typescript
// ❌ Direct fetch — bypasses retry + circuit breaker + sticky cache
const res = await fetch(`${BLOCKVISION_BASE}/account/coins?...`, { headers });

// ✅ Always through the helper
const res = await fetchBlockVisionWithRetry(url, { headers, signal: AbortSignal.timeout(4_000) });
```

## Tests live here

- `packages/engine/src/__tests__/blockvision-retry.test.ts` — retry, jitter, `Retry-After`, circuit breaker
- `packages/engine/src/__tests__/defi-portfolio.test.ts` — aggregation + cache poisoning regression
- `packages/engine/src/__tests__/defi-cache-sticky.test.ts` — sticky-positive write rules
- All three call `_resetBlockVisionCircuitBreaker()` in `beforeEach` to isolate state.
