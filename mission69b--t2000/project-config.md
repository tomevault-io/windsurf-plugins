# Coding Discipline

Three habits that shrink diffs, reduce rewrites, and surface the right questions before code is written. Adapted from Karpathy's coding-skills repo.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

This pairs with the **trace-the-full-path** principle in `engineering-principles.mdc` — before any fix, trace the actual execution path. Most "wrong fix" iterations come from skipping this.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

This pairs with **single source of truth** (`single-source-of-truth.mdc`). Most over-complication comes from forking a canonical instead of extending it.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

**The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## Why this matters in this codebase

We've shipped fixes that took 4+ iterations because:
- The first fix went in the wrong layer (didn't trace the full path → see `engineering-principles.mdc` Principle 5).
- The fix included "while I'm here" refactors that introduced a new bug (failed surgical changes).
- The fix added a "flexibility" config that wasn't needed (failed simplicity).

Time spent thinking before coding is faster than time spent unwinding the wrong fix.

## Working signals

These guidelines are working if:
- Fewer unnecessary changes in diffs.
- Fewer rewrites due to overcomplication.
- Clarifying questions come **before** implementation rather than after mistakes.
- Each PR can be summarized in 1-2 sentences without weasel words.
