# Safeguards — Engine-Side (Defense in Depth)

The engine sits in the middle of a 6-layer defense stack. Layer 1 (UI), Layer 4 (user confirm), Layer 5 (server validation), and Layer 6 (on-chain) are host concerns. Engine owns Layer 2 (preflight) and Layer 3 (guards). Get those wrong and the whole stack degrades.

## Layer 2 — Preflight (`tool.preflight()`)

Cheap synchronous validation that runs BEFORE the LLM round-trip. No I/O, no context lookup, no network.

```typescript
preflight: (input) => {
  if (input.amount <= 0) return { valid: false, error: 'amount must be positive' };
  if (input.amount > 1_000_000) return { valid: false, error: 'amount unreasonable (max 1M)' };
  if (!isValidSuiAddress(input.to)) return { valid: false, error: 'invalid recipient' };
  return { valid: true };
}
```

Failed preflight → LLM is told "tool input invalid" and re-asks. The user is never shown a confirm card for a malformed intent.

**Every write tool MUST implement preflight.** No exceptions.

## Layer 3 — Guards (`runGuards()`)

14 guards across 3 priority tiers run around every write — 12 pre-execution gates + 2 post-execution hints. Defined in `packages/engine/src/guards.ts`.

| Tier | Guards |
|---|---|
| Safety | Health Factor, Insufficient Balance, Recipient Validation |
| Financial | USD Threshold, Slippage Cap, Daily Spend Limit |
| UX | Allowance Reminder, Network Health, Stale Quote |

Each guard returns one of:
- `{ pass: true }` — silent, allowed
- `{ pass: true, hint: '...' }` — allowed, hint injected for LLM context
- `{ pass: true, warning: '...' }` — allowed, warning surfaced in confirm card
- `{ pass: false, reason: '...' }` — BLOCKED, agent narrates and re-asks

Adding a new guard:
1. Add to `guards.ts` with the right tier.
2. Test with all 4 outcomes (`pass`, `hint`, `warning`, `block`).
3. Add a regression test that asserts the bypass attempt fails closed.
4. Document in this rule.

## USD-aware permission resolver (B.4)

`resolvePermissionTier(operation, amountUsd, config)` dynamically downgrades a write's permission level based on USD value. The resolver is **active in audric/web today** (P2.6 UC4b confirmed via live run: a 1.27 SUI / ~$1.20 swap auto-executed under the `conservative` preset).

```typescript
// packages/engine/src/permission-rules.ts
DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CONFIG = {
  globalAutoBelow: 10,
  autonomousDailyLimit: 200,
  rules: [
    { operation: 'save',     autoBelow: 50, confirmBetween: 1000 },
    { operation: 'send',     autoBelow: 10, confirmBetween: 200  },
    { operation: 'borrow',   autoBelow: 0,  confirmBetween: 500  }, // always confirm
    { operation: 'withdraw', autoBelow: 25, confirmBetween: 500  },
    { operation: 'swap',     autoBelow: 25, confirmBetween: 300  },
    { operation: 'pay',      autoBelow: 1,  confirmBetween: 50   },
    { operation: 'repay',    autoBelow: 50, confirmBetween: 1000 },
  ],
};

PERMISSION_PRESETS = {
  conservative: { globalAutoBelow: 5,  autonomousDailyLimit: 100, /* most writes autoBelow: 5 */ },
  balanced:     DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CONFIG,
  aggressive:   { globalAutoBelow: 25, autonomousDailyLimit: 500, /* most writes autoBelow: 25–100 */ },
};
```

**How a write is resolved:**
1. If `amountUsd < rule.autoBelow` (or `globalAutoBelow` when no per-op rule) → `auto`.
2. If `amountUsd ≤ rule.confirmBetween` → `confirm`.
3. Else → `explicit` (LLM never dispatches; user must initiate manually).
4. Cumulative daily spend > `autonomousDailyLimit` downgrades any `auto` to `confirm` (runtime safety net).
5. `borrow` always confirms (`autoBelow: 0` across every preset) — debt is too consequential to silently take on.

**Audric/web's wiring (today):**
- The session permission preset is plumbed through to the engine via `ToolContext.permissionConfig` + `priceCache`.
- Default is `conservative` for new accounts (set in user settings; settable to `balanced` / `aggressive`).
- Sub-threshold writes auto-execute via the same sponsored-tx path; the user sees the receipt only after on-chain settlement.
- `attemptId` is still stamped on auto-executed writes so audit + rollback paths work identically to confirm-tier.

**Trust model under zkLogin:**
- Auto-execution does NOT bypass user consent — the user opted into the preset (and thus into "small writes happen without a tap"). Tap-to-confirm is recoverable per-operation by toggling to `conservative`+raising thresholds, or by switching to `balanced` for a higher per-op tap-to-confirm baseline.
- Each leg still flows through the same Enoki-sponsored builder; auto-execute changes WHO presses the button (engine vs. user), not WHAT gets signed.

**When NOT to auto-execute (engineering rule):**
- Don't add a new write tool whose preset entry has `autoBelow > 0` without a guard that re-validates fresh balance / health-factor at execute time. The `<financial_context>` snapshot is daily; small auto-writes that race a position change can wedge HF if you trust stale data.

## Tool result budgeting (B.2)

```typescript
maxResultSizeChars: 8_000,
summarizeOnTruncate: (full, max) => `${full.slice(0, max - 100)}\n\n[Truncated]`,
```

Without this, a tool returning a 50k-token portfolio response blows context budget and degrades EVERY subsequent turn. Set the cap explicitly per tool.
