# Arc Plugin

The full arc from idea to shipped code. Arc's canonical product definition, domain language, and operating boundary live in `CONTEXT.md`. Treat this file as contributor guidance, not a competing definition.

## Command Workflow

All commands use the `/arc:` namespace prefix. The typical workflow:

```
1. FOUNDATION /arc:vision     → Define project goals (one-time setup)
2. SPEC       /arc:ideate     → Turn idea into validated feature spec
3. REVIEW     /arc:review     → Expert validation before execution
4. EXECUTE    /arc:implement  → Plan + TDD implementation
5. TEST       /arc:testing    → Backfill safety-net tests for existing code
6. SHIP       /arc:launch     → Go-live checklist

CROSS-CUTTING (available anytime):
              /arc:audit      → Comprehensive codebase audit
              /arc:commit     → Smart commits, push, and package publishing
              /arc:refactor   → Discover friction, propose structural refactors
```

## Development

To test changes locally:
1. Edit the skill in `skills/<command>/SKILL.md`
2. Run the corresponding command (e.g., `/arc:ideate`)
3. Iterate based on results

## Key Principles

See `CONTEXT.md` for Arc's canonical principles. In contributor work, preserve the same boundary: Arc is self-contained, lifecycle-focused, and uses `using-arc` as a small control plane.

## Optional External Plugins

External plugins can provide useful extra checks, but they are not part of Arc's product definition and Arc should not depend on them for core behavior.

- **[agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills)** — `vercel-react-best-practices`, `vercel-composition-patterns`, `vercel-react-native-skills`

When an external plugin is available, use it only as an optional enhancement. Keep Arc workflows understandable and usable without it.

## Browser Tools

- In Codex, prefer `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` for rendered-page verification.
- Outside Codex, prefer `agent-browser` for browser automation before dropping to Playwright.

## Publishing

1. Bump version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Users update via their plugin manager
