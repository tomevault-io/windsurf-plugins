# Agent Reference: Pi-SmartRead Sister Repos

Pi-SmartRead is the Pi coding agent's code-intelligence extension — unified file reading, structural file analysis (callers, inheritance, overrides, quality signals), hybrid code search (BM25 + AST symbol + semantic), repo mapping, and call graph analysis. It relies on one shared sister codebase for serialized workspace-evidence contracts and serves as the RPC resolver for Pi-SmartEdit's evidence authorization.

## `/Users/rhinesharar/Pi-Workspace-Protocol`

- **Package:** `@rhinos0608/pi-workspace-protocol` (pinned in `package.json` as `github:rhinos0608/Pi-Workspace-Protocol#v0.3.0`).
- **Purpose:** Versioned TypeScript contracts, SHA-256/id helpers, runtime validators, and an event-bus RPC layer for the SmartRead/SmartEdit inspect+patch protocol.
- **What Pi-SmartRead consumes:**
  - `src/inspect.ts` imports `PROTOCOL_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `hashSessionFilePath`, `inspectionIdFor`, `resourceIdFor`, `canonicalizeWorkspaceRoot`, `WorkspaceEvidenceEnvelope`, `InspectedResource`, `InspectMode` to build schema-3 evidence envelopes.
  - `src/workspace-evidence-resolver.ts` imports `PROTOCOL_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `validateInspectionEnvelope`, `hashSessionFilePath`, `WorkspaceEvidenceEnvelope` to validate and cache published envelopes.
  - `src/read-many.ts` imports `canonicalizeWorkspaceRoot`, `hashSessionFilePath`, `inspectionIdFor`, `PROTOCOL_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `InspectedResource`, `WorkspaceEvidenceEnvelope` to build batch workspace-evidence envelopes from multi-file reads.
  - `src/mcp-registry.ts` imports `RPC_CHANNELS` to create the evidence resolver on the `inspectPatch` channel.
  - `src/path-evidence.ts` imports `sha256OfString` for per-file content hashing in path-mode evidence.
  - `src/index.ts` receives evidence from the wrapped `read`, `inspect`, and `grep` tools, publishing envelopes into the shared `EvidenceResolver`.

## `/Users/rhinesharar/Pi-SmartEdit`

- **Package:** Pi-SmartEdit (the `edit`/`write` extension).
- **Purpose:** Provides the `edit` and `write` tools; validates edits against workspace-evidence envelopes produced by Pi-SmartRead.
- **What Pi-SmartRead provides for Pi-SmartEdit:**
  - **RPC evidence resolver** (`src/workspace-evidence-resolver.ts`): Answers `resolve_evidence` RPC requests on `RPC_CHANNELS.inspectPatch`. Pi-SmartEdit's `patch.ts` sends a request with `inspectionId`/`sessionFilePath`/`workspaceRoot`, and the resolver returns the cached `WorkspaceEvidenceEnvelope`. The resolver cache is rebuilt from `tool_result` events (`pi.tool_result.inspect`, `pi.tool_result.read`, and `pi.tool_result.grep`) seen on the event bus — tool result details are the durable source of truth.
  - **Inspect tool** (`src/inspect-tool.ts`, `src/inspect.ts`): Two modes — directory (ranked repo map) and file (structural facts + quality signals). Directory mode returns envelope mode `map` with zero resources (no file authorization). File mode returns envelope mode `symbol` with per-referenced-symbol `coverage: "search-match"` (weak evidence; must read before editing). Query/symbol/action modes removed; use `grep` tool for code search.
  - **Grep tool** (`src/grep-tool.ts`): Primary code search — BM25 ranking + AST symbol matching + embedding semantic fallback behind a grep-shaped interface. Returns envelope mode `query` with `coverage: "search-match"` per hit. `tool_result.grep` events feed the resolver cache.
  - **Read tool wrapper** (`src/index.ts:432-436`, `src/hook.ts`): Owns single-file provenance plus `{ paths: [...] }` and `{ query }` dispatch. Query mode uses the shared semantic index, then reads selected files through the same evidence-emitting single-read path.
  - **Read-many batch** (`src/read-many.ts`): Internal packing engine for multi-file/query-selected reads. `read_files` is no longer registered. Batch evidence includes only complete file blocks actually rendered; partial and omitted blocks are not authorized.
  - **Semantic index** (`src/semantic-index.ts`, `src/semantic-index-registry.ts`): Startup-warmed, ignore-aware, model-fingerprinted SQLite vector cache with independent incremental file state. Query ranking fuses whole-corpus BM25 and embedding ranks with RRF; grep+AST is availability/error fallback only.
  - **Context hygiene** (`src/context-hygiene.ts`): Tracks read results, marks stale context after mutations. Pi-SmartEdit's edit results trigger hygiene events via the event bus.
  - **Context graph** (`src/context-graph.ts`, `src/graph-mutate.ts`): `graph_mutate` receives `breakage`/`co-change` edges (from Pi-SmartEdit's post-edit evidence pipeline or manual tool calls) and persists them via the `EdgeStore` for future graph-aware retrieval.
