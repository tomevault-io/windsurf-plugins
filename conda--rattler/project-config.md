- Rust monorepo for conda package management (solving, installing, fetching repodata), used by pixi, rattler-build, prefix.dev
- Build: `pixi run build` | Test: `pixi run test` | Lint all: `pixi run lint`
- Single test: `pixi run -- cargo nextest run -p <crate_name> <test_name>`
- Before committing, run `pixi run cargo-fmt` and `pixi run cargo-clippy` to ensure formatting and lint compliance
- crates in `crates/`, Python bindings in `py-rattler/`, WASM bindings in `js-rattler/`
- When creating PRs, use conventional commits and use the PR template. If possible, add the user's prompt there.
