# amqp-contract

Type-safe contracts for AMQP/RabbitMQ messaging with automatic runtime validation. TypeScript ESM monorepo using pnpm catalogs and Turbo.

## Rules

| Rule                                                    | Read this when…                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Project Overview](.agents/rules/project-overview.md)   | Orienting yourself in the repo, looking up which package owns X  |
| [Commands](.agents/rules/commands.md)                   | Running anything (`pnpm`, turbo filters, integration tests)      |
| [Contract Patterns](.agents/rules/contract-patterns.md) | Defining or modifying a contract (publishers/consumers/RPCs)     |
| [Handlers](.agents/rules/handlers.md)                   | Writing worker handlers, dealing with `ResultAsync` / neverthrow |
| [Runtime](.agents/rules/runtime.md)                     | Touching connections, telemetry, compression                     |
| [Code Style](.agents/rules/code-style.md)               | Reviewing or writing TS — composition, anti-patterns             |
| [Testing](.agents/rules/testing.md)                     | Adding unit or integration tests, using the testing fixtures     |
| [Build & Release](.agents/rules/build-and-release.md)   | Adding a package, modifying tsdown config, shipping a release    |
| [Dependencies](.agents/rules/dependencies.md)           | Adding a dep, picking a schema lib, catalog questions            |
| [Recipes](.agents/rules/recipes.md)                     | "How do I add a new consumer / RPC / publishable package?"       |

## Key Constraints

This is the canonical list — sub-files reference these rather than restating them.

### Language and types

- No `any` — use `unknown` and narrow (enforced by oxlint).
- Type aliases over interfaces — `type Foo = {}`, not `interface Foo {}`.
- `.js` extensions required in all imports (ESM).
- Standard Schema v1 for validation (Zod, Valibot, ArkType — anything that implements the spec).

### Handlers and error handling

- Handlers return `ResultAsync<void, HandlerError>` (regular consumer) or `ResultAsync<TResponse, HandlerError>` (RPC). No `async`/`await` in handler signatures.
- `await resultAsync` resolves to a `Result<T, E>` — it does **not** throw on `Err`.
- `result.match(okFn, errFn)` is **positional**. Boxed-style `match({ Ok, Error })` is not supported.
- `ResultAsync.fromPromise(promise, errorMapper)` requires the error mapper as the second argument. Chaining `.mapErr(fn)` afterwards instead is a type error.

### Topology and contract authoring

- Quorum queues by default. Classic queues only for features quorum doesn't support (`exclusive`, `autoDelete`, `maxPriority`).
- Composition pattern — define resources first, then reference; never inline inside `defineContract`.

### Tooling and process

- Catalog dependencies via `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — never hardcode versions in `package.json`.
- Conventional commits required (feat, fix, docs, chore, test, refactor, ci, build, perf, revert, style). Enforced by commitlint on `commit-msg`.
- Git hooks: lefthook runs `oxfmt` and `oxlint` on `pre-commit`; commitlint on `commit-msg`. `pnpm typecheck` is **not** in the hook, so run it before pushing if you changed types.

## Safety / blast radius

Before doing any of the following, confirm with the user:

- Pushing to `main`, force-pushing, or rewriting history (main is protected, but local mistakes happen — see [Build & Release](.agents/rules/build-and-release.md) for the release flow).
- Running `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fdx`, or any destructive `git` operation when the working tree contains uncommitted state.
- Closing or merging a PR.
- Anything that publishes to npm or pushes to GitHub Releases (the changeset/release pipeline owns publishing — never run `pnpm release` or `npm publish` manually).
- Skipping commit hooks (`--no-verify`) or signing flags. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.
- Editing `.github/workflows/*.yml` — release uses Trusted Publishing OIDC; small changes can break npm auth. Read [Build & Release](.agents/rules/build-and-release.md) first.

These do **not** need confirmation:

- Local commits, branches, file edits, running `pnpm build`/`test`/`lint`.
- Pushing a feature branch to origin.
- Creating a PR (always go via PR — never push directly to `main`).

## Common mistakes

These have been re-introduced more than once across recent migrations / reviews — flag them in self-review:

- **Treating `await TypedAmqp(Client|Worker).create(...)` as a client/worker.** It returns `ResultAsync<Client, TechnicalError>`; `await` gives you a `Result`. Unwrap with `_unsafeUnwrap()` (or pattern-match) before calling instance methods.
- **Wrapping `client.publish(...)` in `ResultAsync.fromPromise(...)`.** `publish` already returns a `ResultAsync` — wrap it again and you get `ResultAsync<ResultAsync<...>>`. Chain `.map` / `.mapErr` directly.
