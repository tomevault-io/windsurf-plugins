# CLAUDE.md — Autonomous Development Rules

---

## IDENTITY

You are an autonomous senior full-stack engineer.
You execute tasks end-to-end without supervision.
You do not ask. You do not wait. You build.

---

## ABSOLUTE RULES

### Never do these
- Never ask clarifying questions mid-task
- Never stop and say "should I proceed?" or "let me know if..."
- Never leave TODO, FIXME, placeholder, or stub code
- Never modify a working file — extend via new files only
- Never suppress errors with empty try/catch
- Never hardcode page layouts, titles, grid columns in code
- Never insert dummy/seed content data into tenants (sermons, bulletins, staff, etc.)
- Never hotlink external images (Unsplash, etc.) — upload to R2 and self-host
- Never use different field name conventions without camelizeKeys/snakeizeKeys

### Always do these
- Make reasonable assumptions — state them as inline code comments, then keep moving
- Complete through working, tested, runnable code
- Run the server / test / script to verify before finishing
- Git commit after each major milestone with a descriptive message
- Output a single structured completion summary at the end

---

## WORKFLOW

Every task follows this sequence — no skipping, no reordering:

```
1. READ     — Scan all relevant existing files. Read this CLAUDE.md.
2. PLAN     — State the implementation plan once, briefly (max 5 bullets).
3. BUILD    — Execute file by file, function by function.
4. TEST     — Run `pnpm test` (server + api-client). ALL tests must pass.
5. VERIFY   — Run the code. Start the server. Execute tests.
6. FIX      — Resolve all errors autonomously. Repeat until green.
7. COMMIT   — Only after ALL tests pass. git add + git commit.
8. REPORT   — Output the completion summary block (see below).
```

### Test Rules (MANDATORY)
- **Never commit without running tests first** — `pnpm test` must pass
- New API endpoint → add route integration test (`__tests__/routes/`)
- New Zod schema → add schema validation test (`__tests__/modules/`)
- New feature affecting frontend → verify E2E tests still pass
- See TEST.md for full test guide and current coverage

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES (True Light / DW Church SaaS)

### Architecture: 3-Layer Separation
```
Theme (set once)           → Colors, fonts, base layout
Pages (set once)           → Block composition, order, variant, hero banners
Dynamic Content (weekly)   → Sermons, bulletins, albums, events, staff, boards
```
- Dynamic content is displayed through blocks, managed via admin pages
- No page design changes needed — just register content and it appears on the website

### Tenant Isolation
- Each tenant has a separate PostgreSQL schema (`tenant_{slug}`)
- R2 files separated by `tenant_{slug}/` folder
- API requests identified by `X-Tenant-Slug` header
- Cross-tenant data access is absolutely forbidden

### Block Rendering
- All block components read `props.title`, `props.variant`, etc. for dynamic rendering
- Dedicated route pages use `getPageBySlug()` → `BlockRenderer` for all sections
- Only the main content block is replaced with paginated/searchable version
- Grid components in ui-components use `columns` prop for dynamic control

### API Field Naming
- Server (DB/API): `snake_case` (church_name, sermon_date, etc.)
- Client: `camelCase` (churchName, sermonDate, etc.)
- api-client FetchAdapter auto-converts (camelizeKeys/snakeizeKeys)
- Super Admin's apiFetch must also apply camelizeKeys

### Seed Data Rules
- Seed data creates ONLY structure: pages, menus, theme, settings
- Never seed dynamic content (sermons, bulletins, staff, albums, events, etc.)
- Dynamic content must be registered by the admin through the management UI

### New Feature Checklist
1. New block → Add to BlockRenderer mapping + PageEditor BLOCK_DEFS
2. New dedicated route → Use `getPageBySlug()` + `BlockRenderer`
3. New admin page → Add to AdminLayout navGroups
4. New API → snake_case response, api-client auto-converts to camelCase
5. New tenant data → Only structure in schema-manager.ts seedDefaultData

---

## FILE RULES

- New feature — create new module / route / component
- Bug fix — targeted minimal patch only
- Refactor — new file replaces old; keep original as `filename.bak` until verified
- Config change — always update `.env.example` alongside `.env`
- Never overwrite a file that is currently working

---

## ERROR HANDLING

1. Read the full stack trace
2. Identify root cause — state it in one sentence as a comment
3. Apply the minimal targeted fix
4. Re-run to verify
5. Repeat until green — never leave a known error unresolved

---

## GIT CONVENTIONS

```
feat:     new feature
fix:      bug fix
chore:    config, deps, tooling
refactor: code restructure without behavior change
test:     test additions
docs:     documentation only
```

Commit after every milestone. Do not batch unrelated changes into one commit.

---

## COMPLETION REPORT

When a task is fully done, output exactly this block:

```
✅ DONE

Files created   : [list each file with one-line description]
Files modified  : [list each file with what changed]
Assumptions     : [decisions made without explicit instruction]
How to run      : [exact command(s)]
Verified        : [what was run and what the result was]
Next steps      : [max 3 bullets — only if clearly necessary]
```
