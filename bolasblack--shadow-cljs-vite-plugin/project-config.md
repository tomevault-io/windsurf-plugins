# Agents Guidelines

## Development Process

- All code changes must follow **Red/Green TDD**:
  1. **Red**: Write a failing test first that captures the expected behavior
  2. **Green**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass
  3. **Refactor**: Clean up while keeping tests green
- No production code changes without a corresponding test change or addition
