# MAP Framework (mapify-cli) — Agent Instructions

## What this repo is

- **Purpose:** `mapify` is a Python 3.11+ CLI that installs the MAP Framework into a target project (it writes `.claude/` skill-backed slash surfaces/config and `.map/` workflow artifacts).
- **Runtime code:** `src/mapify_cli/`
- **Bundled templates (what users get from `mapify init`):** `src/mapify_cli/templates/`
- **Dev templates/config used in this repo:** `.claude/` (keep it in sync with `src/mapify_cli/templates/`)

## Critical invariant: template single-source render

All shipped templates are generated from `src/mapify_cli/templates_src/**/*.jinja` via `make render-templates`. Never edit the generated trees directly — edit the `.jinja` source and re-render.

Generated trees (do NOT edit directly):
- `src/mapify_cli/templates/**`
- `.claude/**`
- `.codex/**`
- `.agents/skills/**`

To propagate any change to shipped templates:
- `make render-templates`

Verification:
- Run `make check-render` (renders and asserts no diff — enforces generated trees match source).
- Run `pytest tests/test_template_render.py -v` (byte-identity golden render tests).

## Skill catalog invariant

When changing shipped skills, keep `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json` and `src/mapify_cli/templates/skills/skill-rules.json` explicit about `skillClass`:
- `task` for manual slash workflows that may call agents, run checks, or write artifacts.
- `reference` for guidance-only skills with no manual invocation, hooks, or runtime effects.
- `hybrid` only when reference guidance ships hooks/scripts or artifact side effects; list `runtimeEffects`.

Validation:
- Run `pytest tests/test_skills.py tests/test_template_render.py -v`.
- Run `uv run mapify init <new-temp-path> --no-git --mcp none` and inspect generated `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json` for shipped metadata changes.

## How to work in this repo

- Prefer deterministic tooling over “manual review”: run `make check` (or `make lint` / `make test`) after changes.
- When changing scripts, hooks, CLIs, or generated provider surfaces, test both negative/no-op paths and positive paths with realistic inputs. A hook returning `{}` proves only the silent path; also build minimal state/artifacts that should trigger its intended output or side effect.
- When changing user-facing behavior, also update relevant docs:
  - `README.md` (quick-start)
  - `docs/USAGE.md` (workflows and CLI usage)
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (system design / agents)
- For releases, follow `RELEASING.md` and update `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Safety expectations

- Don't add or expose secrets. Avoid reading/writing `.env*` and credential/key files.

## MAP Workflow Rules

- If **Monitor** returns `valid=false`, treat it as a **hard stop**: fix the issues before proceeding.
  - Do NOT dismiss Monitor feedback as "out of scope" / "separate task".
  - If you're unsure whether fixing it is in scope: ask the user explicitly and wait for a decision.

## Fix every surfaced error — no exceptions

- Every error surfaced by ANY tool during a workflow must be fixed before the workflow can complete. This includes:
  - `make lint`, `make check`, `make test`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`
  - **IDE / type-checker diagnostics surfaced in the conversation** (Pyright, Pylance, language-server diagnostics)
  - Hook output and tool-result diagnostics
- "Pre-existing" is NOT a valid reason to skip. If the diagnostic surfaces in the current run, it is current.
- "Not in the CI gate" is NOT a valid reason to skip. The error is real if any tool reported it.
- "Static-analysis noise" is NOT a category. Either the type system is correct and the code is wrong, or the annotation needs fixing — pick one and fix it.
- Only legitimate skip: the user explicitly approves deferral in the current conversation. Document the deferral in writing.
- **Any error encountered while operating the MAP Framework itself must be fixed immediately, in the same change.** This covers the framework's own runtime — a hook that crashes or false-positives, a `.map/scripts/` runner or gate that errors or mis-reports, a `mapify` CLI traceback, a render/validator/blueprint failure, a broken `Task`/agent dispatch. When you hit one mid-task: STOP, find the root cause, and fix it before continuing the original work. Do NOT work around it, do NOT defer it as "unrelated", do NOT note-and-move-on past a broken tool. If the fix is genuinely out of scope or risky, stop and ask the user — never silently continue past a malfunctioning framework component. (Errors raised by an external plugin/hook NOT shipped by this repo are out of scope here; say so and route them to the user.)

## Bash Command Guidelines

**CRITICAL:** Avoid output buffering issues that cause commands to hang.

### ❌ DO NOT use these patterns:
```bash
command | head -n X    # Causes buffering, output hangs
command | tail -n X    # Causes buffering, output hangs
command | less         # Interactive, causes issues
command | more         # Interactive, causes issues
```

### ✅ DO use these patterns instead:
```bash
# Use command-specific flags
git log -n 10                  # Not: git log | head -10
git log --max-count=10
