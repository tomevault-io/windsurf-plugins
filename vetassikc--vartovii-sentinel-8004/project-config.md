# Sentinel-8004 Public Repo Instructions

This file applies to the standalone public repository
`Vartovii-Sentinel-8004`.

## Core Rules

- Communicate with the user in Ukrainian.
- Write all code, docs, comments, and commit messages in English.
- Never push without explicit user approval.
- Keep the repository public-safe and MIT-safe.
- Never expose private Vartovii internals, prompts, secrets, or private
  infrastructure details.
- Prefer small, judge-friendly changes over broad platform work.

## Repository Purpose

This repository is the public hackathon submission surface for
`Vartovii Sentinel-8004`.

It should contain:

- public demo code
- judge-mode artifacts
- public-safe documentation
- sample schemas and payloads
- screenshots, diagrams, and other submission assets

It should not contain:

- private core orchestration
- internal operating playbooks
- confidential partner notes
- secret configuration or runtime credentials

## Product Scope

Maintain the narrow thesis:

`Vartovii Sentinel-8004 is a signed trade-permit guardrail for autonomous trading agents.`

Do not expand this repo into:

- a generic multi-agent platform
- a broad trading platform
- unrelated Vartovii product surfaces

## Documentation Rules

- Update public docs when the public repo behavior or structure changes.
- Keep public language legally safe.
- Avoid claims such as guaranteed, compliant by default, safe investment, or
  verified truth.
- Prefer language such as signal, policy-based decision, audit trace, and based
  on configured inputs.

## Demo Rules

- Prefer judge mode over fragile live integrations.
- Keep example scenarios reproducible.
- Fail closed when the public demo cannot prove a safe decision path.

## Final Rule

This repo should help judges understand and run the hackathon submission quickly
without needing access to the private `Vartovii` repository.
