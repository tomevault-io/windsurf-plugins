# Monorepo Organization Patterns

When working with the Flarekit monorepo:

## Project Structure
```
flarekit/
├── apps/
│   ├── backend/     # Cloudflare Worker API (Hono)
│   └── web/         # Frontend application (Astro)
├── packages/
│   └── database/    # Shared database layer (Drizzle)
├── scripts/         # Utility scripts
└── .github/         # CI/CD workflows
```

## Package Dependencies
- Use workspace references: `"@flarekit/database": "*"`
- Shared packages should be built before dependent apps
- Use TurboRepo for efficient builds and caching

## Development Workflow
- Start all services: `npm run dev` (from root)
- Individual services: `npm run dev --filter="@flarekit/backend"`
- Database migrations: `npx flarekit migrate:d1:local`

## Shared Code Patterns
- Database schemas and services in `packages/database`
- Utility functions should be in appropriate packages
- Type definitions shared across apps
- Common configurations in root or shared packages

## Build Process
- Database package builds first (dependency for backend)
- Backend and web can build in parallel
- Use `turbo.json` for build orchestration
- Generate migrations before building database package

## Environment Management
- Each app has its own `.dev.vars` for local secrets
- Shared environment variables in root `.env`
- Use `wrangler.json` for Cloudflare-specific config
- Different persistence paths for different environments

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests in each package/app
- Integration tests for database operations
- E2E tests for full application flows
- Use Vitest with Cloudflare Workers pool

## Deployment
- Database migrations run first
- Backend and frontend deploy independently
- Use GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- Environment-specific configurations

## Code Sharing Best Practices
- Export types from packages for use in apps
- Keep business logic in appropriate layers
- Avoid circular dependencies between packages
- Use path aliases for clean imports (`@/`, `@utils/`)

@turbo.json
@package.json
