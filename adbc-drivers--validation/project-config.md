# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## General Notes

- Use `gh` CLI to read GitHub issues.
- Research whether the database system in question supports the type or not. If it does not, then the best course of action is to create a txtcase file with `hide = true`. Otherwise you may want to use either `broken-driver` or `broken-vendor`.
- See `query_metadata.py` for the format of metadata.
- Don't cram multiple shell commands in one attempt as it forces me to manually review every time.
- Include license headers in txtcase files.
- When generating query metadata, make sure to define sql-type-name. Again, research what the right name for the particular vendor is.
- You are absolutely forbidden from committing or staging changes unless explicitly requested.
- At the end of a task, make sure the following pass:

  ```
  # Run tests
  uv run pytest -vs
  # Format the code
  pre-commit run --all-files
  # Check types
  uv run ty check
  ```
- Clean up temporary/test files you create after using them, instead of leaving

## Architecture Overview

### Project Structure

- `adbc_drivers_validation/`: Main package source code
  - `model.py`: Core data models for queries, drivers, and test case configuration
  - `quirks.py`: Driver-specific quirks and SQL dialect handling
  - `compare.py`: Comparison utilities for test results
  - `arrowjson.py`: Utilities for working with Arrow schemas and tables in JSON format
  - `tests/`: Test framework modules
    - `conftest.py`: Pytest configuration and common fixtures
    - `query.py`: Tests for running SQL queries
    - `ingest.py`: Tests for bulk data ingestion
    - `statement.py`: Tests for statement handling
    - `connection.py`: Tests for connection handling
  - `queries/`: Contains test case definitions
    - `type/literal/`: Tests for literal values
    - `type/select/`: Tests for selecting values from tables
    - `type/bind/`: Tests for binding parameters
    - `ingest/`: Tests for bulk data ingestion
  - `templates/`: Templates for documentation generation

### Key Concepts

**Query Test Cases**: Each test case consists of multiple files with the same base name:

- `.sql`: The query to execute
- `.schema.json`: The expected schema of the result
- `.json`: The expected data result
- `.setup.sql`: Optional setup SQL to run before the main query
- `.bind.sql`: Optional query to execute with parameters
- `.bind.schema.json`: Schema of the bind parameters
- `.bind.json`: Data for the bind parameters
- `.toml`: Metadata about the test case (tags, skip conditions, etc.)

Alternatively, these files can be consolidated into a single `.txtcase` file.  Inside the file, a `// part: ` comment is needed before the file contents to identify the data.  For example, instead of having a `int64.toml`, `int64.sql`, `int64.json`, and `int64.schema.json`, you would have a `int64.txtcase` file:

```
// part: metadata
toml contents

// part: query
SELECT CAST(1 AS BIGINT)

// part: expected_schema
schema JSON

// part: expected
{"res": 1}
```

This is how the extension corresponds to the part comment:

| file | `// part: ` |
|-|-|
| `.toml` | `metadata` |
| `.setup.sql` | `setup_query` |
| `.bind.sql` | `bind_query` |
| `.bind.schema.json` | `bind_schema` |
| `.bind.json` | `bind` |
| `.sql` | `query` |
| `.schema.json` | `expected_schema` |
| `.json` | `expected` |
