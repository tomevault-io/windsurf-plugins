# AGENTS.md — Mario AI Control Center

## Project mission
Build Mario Wangen's professional website as an interactive, evidence-based portfolio dashboard for AI Infrastructure, MLOps, GenAI systems, and senior software engineering.

This is not a generic portfolio. It should feel like an **AI Engineering Control Center**: curated, searchable, filterable, calm, senior, and production-minded.

Primary audience:
- Recruiters hiring for AI Infrastructure / MLOps / GenAI engineering roles
- Hiring managers and engineering leaders
- Technical interviewers who want evidence, not claims

Primary positioning:
> Senior Software Engineer building production-ready AI systems across AI Infrastructure, MLOps, GenAI, and platform engineering.

Secondary positioning:
> 20+ years software engineering experience, now focused on production AI systems, ML infrastructure, model deployment, RAG systems, agents, and engineering reliability.

## Product principle
Every claim should be backed by evidence.

Avoid fake skill bars like "Python 95%". Instead, show:
- projects using the skill
- insights/articles connected to the skill
- current/recent usage
- architecture decisions
- GitHub/LinkedIn proof links

## Design direction
Visual style:
- Stripe / Linear / Vercel inspired
- clean, modern, minimal
- dashboard-like, not playful
- light theme should feel premium and spacious
- dark theme should feel technical but not hacker-ish
- subtle animation only; no gimmicks

Desired reaction:
> "I immediately want to click around."

The homepage should feel interactive even before the user clicks anything.

## Information architecture
V1 should contain:
- Homepage dashboard
- Search and skill filters
- Featured projects
- Prominent recent insights
- Capability matrix
- Evidence-backed skills
- Builder index / stats
- Timeline
- Project detail views/pages
- Insight detail views/pages

External links are secondary proof buttons. Do not send recruiters away too early.

Correct flow:
Homepage -> internal project/insight detail -> external proof link to GitHub or LinkedIn.

Incorrect flow:
Homepage -> direct GitHub/LinkedIn jump with no explanation.

## Content sources
Use structured content files as the source of truth. Prefer editing data objects over hardcoding content into components.

Suggested content types:
- projects
- insights
- skills
- capabilities
- timeline events
- stats
- links

Every project should support:
- title
- slug
- year
- status
- category
- summary
- problem
- what was built
- architecture notes
- tech stack
- evidence tags
- related insights
- links: GitHub, LinkedIn, demo, article, CV where available

Every insight should support:
- title
- slug
- date/year
- format: LinkedIn post, article, deep dive, carousel, case study
- summary
- core idea
- why it matters
- related skills
- related projects
- original link

## Current known projects
Include and refine these projects:
- Production MLOps Pipeline / AI Infrastructure Platform
- PULSE ContentAgent
- RAG Knowledge System
- StartupCoach
- InterviewCoach
- EasyCover AI
- AI LinkedIn Content Writer
- Django + React Mini LMS with AI assistant
- LiveCV
- Atlas / MLOps Showcase

## Current known skills and tags
Prioritize these tags:
- MLOps
- AI Infrastructure
- Production AI
- MLflow
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- AWS
- PyTorch
- Docker
- CI/CD
- Python
- FastAPI
- RAG
- LangGraph
- LangChain
- CrewAI
- OpenAI APIs
- Vector Databases
- React
- TypeScript
- .NET / C#
- Azure
- DevOps
- Platform Engineering

## Current known insights / article ideas
Use these as initial insight cards:
- Four Gates Before a Model Touches Production
- Golden Snapshots: Catching the Model That Passes Metrics But Changes Answers
- CI Datasets: Testing Your Pipeline Without Testing Your Real Data
- Alias-Based Model Promotion
- We Automated Our ML Model Deployment and Removed the Bottleneck Person
- Debugging NaN Loss in FasterRCNN: The Zero-Annotation Image Problem
- OOM on a vGPU: Why Your VRAM Math Is Wrong for Large Medical Images
- DVC + MLflow: The Two-Command Reproducibility Guarantee
- Why Pixi Instead of Conda for Reproducible ML Environments
- Git Submodules in a Python ML Monorepo
- PULSE: Turning Unpredictable Intelligence Into a Reliable System

## Tone and copywriting
Voice:
- calm
- senior
- precise
- technical but readable
- confident without hype
- no "AI enthusiast" language
- no inflated metrics that cannot be proven

Preferred phrases:
- production-ready AI systems
- AI infrastructure
- MLOps pipelines
- model promotion
- validation gates
- reproducible ML workflows
- reliable systems after the demo
- evidence-backed engineering

Avoid:
- "passionate AI enthusiast"
- "rockstar"
- "ninja"
- over-selling
- unverifiable percentages
- generic portfolio copy

## Build constraints
- Keep the app static for now.
- No backend in V1.
- No CMS in V1.
- No database in V1.
- No auth.
- No unnecessary complexity.
- Use accessible semantic markup.
- Keep performance good.
- Make the content easy to edit.

## Suggested technical direction
Current project stack:
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS or Tailwind-style utility classes
- Framer Motion if already installed / useful
