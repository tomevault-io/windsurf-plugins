# Agent Workflow Guide — BeadSpec

BeadSpec is a Tauri 2.0 desktop application (Rust + React/TypeScript) for managing Beads issue-tracking projects. It reads Dolt SQL directly, writes via the `bd` CLI, and syncs in real time via `dolt_log()` polling.

## Working Agreements

- Always propose a short plan before editing.
- After edits, run `cargo test` (Rust) or `bun test` (frontend) or explain why no tests apply.
- Ask before adding production dependencies or changing public APIs.
- Prefer small commits and tight diffs.
- If scope grows, use `openspec-beads-followup` or `openspec-beads-scope-change` — never silently expand a claimed issue.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| App shell | Tauri 2.0 |
| Backend | Rust (`sqlx`, `specta`, `tauri-specta`, `tokio`) |
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Vite |
| State | TanStack Query (server) + Zustand (UI) |
| UI | Tailwind CSS, TipTap, React Flow / Cytoscape.js |
| Shortcuts | `react-hotkeys-hook` (platform-aware Cmd/Ctrl) |
| IPC | `specta` + `tauri-specta` — auto-generated TS bindings |

## Workflow Stack

| Tool | Role |
|---|---|
| OpenSpec | Owns agreed behavior, requirements, and done criteria |
| Beads (`bd`) | Owns durable task tracking and dependency state (prefix: BEADSPEC) |
| Ruflo | Owns cross-session memory and background workers |
| GitNexus | Owns code graph, impact analysis, and symbol-aware refactors |

## OpenSpec

Use OpenSpec before implementation when a change affects Tauri command signatures, public API shape, user-visible behavior, data model, or acceptance criteria.

Prefer the `openspec-*` skill family. Use `opsx:*` commands only when explicitly requested. Never mix families mid-change.

```bash
openspec list
openspec show <change-id>
openspec validate <change-id>
openspec status --change <change-id>
```

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **BeadSpec** (5542 symbols, 8288 relationships, 277 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
