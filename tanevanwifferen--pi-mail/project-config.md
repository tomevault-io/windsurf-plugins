# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## After making changes

When your changes are complete:

1. **Commit** — one atomic commit per task on the current branch:
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "descriptive message"
   ```
2. **Push** — always pull before pushing; rebase, don't merge:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase && git push
   ```
3. **Restart the daemon** — pi-mail is a pi extension; the daemon must be
   restarted for code changes to take effect. Use the `mail_restart_daemon`
   tool (or tell the operator to restart it). UI assets (HTML/CSS/JS) are
   re-read from disk on each request so a browser refresh is enough for
   frontend-only changes.
