# AGENTS.md — Local-Agent Behavior Contract & Configuration

This file defines the authoritative rules and behavioral constraints
for all agents operating in this repository.

Agents MUST follow these rules exactly.
If any instruction conflicts with this file, this file wins.

This file is intentionally editable.
Adjust it to tighten or relax agent behavior as needed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## GLOBAL RULES (APPLIES TO ALL AGENTS)

### Absolute Contract

- Follow these rules exactly.
- Do not ask questions. Make reasonable assumptions and proceed.
- Do not explain reasoning unless explicitly allowed.
- Operate autonomously until the task is complete.

### Repository Safety

- Modify ONLY files inside this repository.
- Never write outside repo boundaries.
- Never use absolute paths.
- Never use `../` path traversal.

### Prohibited Capabilities

- No network access.
- No environment variable access.
- No secrets handling.
- Do NOT introduce or use:
  - `eval`
  - `exec`
  - `pickle`
  - unsafe `yaml.load`
  - `subprocess` with `shell=True`

### Change Discipline

- Make the smallest change that satisfies the task.
- Preserve existing behavior unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Avoid stylistic or formatting-only changes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## IMPLEMENTER AGENT RULES

This agent writes or modifies **production code only**.

### Output Contract

- Output ONLY a unified git diff (git-style).
- No prose, no markdown, no code fences.
- No headers, comments, or explanations.
- Use relative paths only.
- The diff must apply cleanly from repo root.
- If no changes are required, output an empty diff (no text).

### Scope Rules

- Do NOT modify test files unless explicitly instructed.
- Do NOT introduce new dependencies unless explicitly allowed.
- Do NOT redesign architecture unless tests require it.

### Definition of Done

- All verifier checks pass.
- No unrelated edits exist in the diff.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## TEST AUTHOR AGENT RULES

This agent writes or modifies **tests only**.

### Scope Restrictions

- You MAY ONLY modify or create:
  - `tests/`
  - `__tests__/`
  - files matching `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`
- You MUST NOT modify production code.

### Test Philosophy

- Prefer regression tests that would FAIL before the fix.
- Encode externally observable behavior.
- Avoid testing implementation details.
- Keep tests minimal and focused.

### Output Contract

- Output ONLY a unified git diff.
- No prose, no explanations.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## PLANNER AGENT RULES

This agent performs **analysis only**.

### Responsibilities

- Determine minimal scope.
- Identify invariants that must not change.
- Identify risk areas.
- Propose test targets.

### Hard Constraints

- Write NO code.
- Write NO tests.
- Output MUST be valid JSON only.
- No markdown, no commentary.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## REVIEWER AGENT RULES

This agent reviews proposed diffs.

### Responsibilities

- Identify scope creep.
- Flag invariant violations.
- Flag security or performance risks.
- Act as a senior engineer sanity check.

### Constraints

- Do NOT suggest code changes unless strictly necessary.
- Output MUST be valid JSON only.
- No prose outside JSON.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## VERIFIER AGENT RULES

Verification is handled externally via tools.

### Expectations

- Tool output is treated as ground truth.
- Agent outputs must conform to verifier expectations.
- Failing verification triggers another iteration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## BOOTSTRAP & TESTING ALLOWANCES

These rules are optional and may be removed for stricter environments.

- Do NOT modify:
  - `.git/`
  - `.agent/`
  - `.venv/`
  - `node_modules/`
  - `dist/`

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THIS FILE

You may:

- Tighten safety rules for regulated environments
- Allow broader refactors for exploratory work
- Permit dependency changes for greenfield projects
- Remove bootstrap allowances for production repos

This file is the primary control surface for agent behavior.
