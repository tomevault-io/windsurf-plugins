# Rome

A pnpm monorepo. All code lives under `packages/*` and `rome_apps/*`. Runtime dependencies are declared in `packages/core` — the root `package.json` holds only the dev toolchain, and its scripts delegate to the right workspace via `pnpm --filter`.

- `packages/core/` (`@rome/core`) — backend runtime: Hono server, agent/action/event subsystems, DB, channel adapters. `src/index.ts` wires the object graph via dependency injection.
- `packages/web/` (`rome-web`) — Rsbuild SPA dashboard, served by the backend. Guardian-only.
- `packages/ui/` (`@rome-os/ui`) — shared React component kit for the dashboard and apps.
- `packages/app-runtime-sdk/` (`@rome-os/app-runtime`) and `packages/app-web-sdk/` (`@rome-os/app-web-sdk`) — SDKs consumed by apps.
- `packages/desktop/` (`rome-desktop`) — Electron shell.
- `packages/cdp-client/` (`rome-cdp-client`) — standalone CDP client.
- `rome_apps/*` — runtime-loaded apps (plugins), each a workspace package.

## Playbook

- Before opening a PR, read [`docs/authoring/prs.md`](docs/authoring/prs.md).
- Before explaining a concept or asserting how a surface behaves, check [`docs/`](docs/README.md) and link instead of re-deriving.
- Before building or editing an app, read [`rome_apps/CLAUDE.md`](rome_apps/CLAUDE.md).
- When writing prose (docs, PR text), follow [`docs/authoring/WRITING.md`](docs/authoring/WRITING.md). When writing comments, follow [`docs/authoring/comments.md`](docs/authoring/comments.md).
- When a PR touches `@rome-os/app-runtime`, `@rome-os/app-web-sdk`, or `@rome-os/ui`, use `feat:` / `fix:` / `feat!:` (or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the body). release-please publishes them to npm from Conventional Commits, with no per-PR changeset file. Full flow in [`docs/releases.md`](docs/releases.md).
- When running the fullstack local loop, use `pnpm dev:all` — containerized Rome with `tsx --watch`, plus rome-obs, Traefik, and the Rsbuild dev server. `pnpm start` and `pnpm start:web` skip the production-shaped wiring, so reach for them only to debug the host process.
- When changing a file the container does not watch (`package.json`, container env), run `docker compose restart <service>`.
- When doing frontend-only work in `packages/web`, use `pnpm start:web:mock`.
- When verifying a change, run `pnpm typecheck` on the host, then `pnpm test:unit`, then `pnpm dev:all` and confirm the rome container reaches `Rome started` in `docker logs`. For UI changes, also exercise the feature in the browser — type checks and tests verify code correctness, not feature correctness.
- When adding a runtime dependency, declare it in `packages/core`.
- When bumping `@playwright/test`, re-pin the `layout-invariants` container image in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) to the matching release's digest (`docker buildx imagetools inspect mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v<version>-noble` prints it). The image ships the browsers, the pin decides the client, and they are separate edits. Check the guard step's parse of `playwright install --dry-run` in the same pass, since it reads a CLI label that upstream can reword. The guard fails readably when the image and the client disagree.
- When accessing the database, go through a repository. Core schema is `packages/core/src/db/schema.ts`, app schemas are `rome_apps/*/db/schema.ts`.
- When adding config, validate it with Zod in `packages/core/src/config.ts` and add it to `packages/core/.env.example`.
- When logging, use `createLogger(component)` from `packages/core/src/logger.ts`.

## Traps

**A shell that already has `node` on the PATH is not the devShell.** The devShell pins the Node major the repo builds against, and `pnpm install` compiles native modules against whichever Node runs it. A tree installed outside the devShell loads only under that same wrong Node. The install, the type check, and the whole suite still pass together on it. Run `nix develop` first. To repair such a tree, run `pnpm rebuild -r`, because `pnpm install` reports it as up to date and changes nothing.

**Imports carry `.js` extensions even for TypeScript files.** The repo is `"type": "module"`. Inside `packages/core`, `@/*` maps to `./src/*`.

**Biome's npm binary does not run on the host.** NixOS cannot execute it, so `pnpm lint` belongs in CI or the dev container. On the host, use the nixpkgs `biome` from the devShell directly.

**A migration that breaks an interface first breaks every consumer that has not migrated yet.** Keep existing interfaces, schemas, and contracts working while new behavior lands alongside them, and sequence the break last or behind a switch.

**A new dev-only branch in a production path ships to production.** Prefer an existing config or env switch, and put seeding and fixtures in setup scripts such as `scripts/dev-up.sh`.
