# claudeline — contributor notes

A bash statusline for Claude Code. Runs as `statusLine.command` per session, plus a `SessionStart` hook (`hooks/show-usage-limits.sh`) that fetches usage limits via the Anthropic OAuth API and caches them at `/tmp/.claude_usage_limits_{account}.json`.

## Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org):

- **MAJOR** — incompatible changes to the install layout, settings schema, hook output contract, or required Claude Code version
- **MINOR** — new statusline segments, new env-var knobs, new hooks/skills, new account modes
- **PATCH** — bug fixes, doc tweaks, performance work, no behavioral surface change

Each release is a `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` git tag on the commit that bumps `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Release workflow

When shipping a release:

1. **Edit `CHANGELOG.md`**: add a new section at the top under the "Each release corresponds to..." line, dated `(YYYY-MM-DD)`, grouped by `### Features` / `### Fixes` / `### Docs` / `### Known issues`. Reference upstream issues by URL when relevant.
2. **Commit** with subject `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` and the changelog excerpt in the body.
3. **Tag** the release commit: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"`.
4. **Push** both the commit and the tag: `git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
5. **GitHub release** (optional): `gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes-file <(awk '/^## v/{n++} n==1' CHANGELOG.md)` to publish the latest section as the release notes.

Don't squash unrelated work into a release commit — it should only touch `CHANGELOG.md` (and `README.md` if user-facing copy needs updating).

## What goes in `### Fixes`

Lead with the user-visible symptom, then explain the root cause briefly. Future-readers searching the changelog for "my statusline shows X" should find the entry.

Good: *"Hook keychain lookup: Symptom: usage stats missing on personal account, fine on work. Anchors the grep on `claudeAiOauth.accessToken` so MCP tokens can't shadow it."*

Bad: *"Refactor get_token logic"* — gives the reader nothing to match against.

## Backfilling tags

If a previous release was documented in CHANGELOG but never tagged, backfill with the original release date:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z <commit-sha> -m "vX.Y.Z (backfilled)"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Use the commit that matches the changelog content, not the latest commit.

## Testing changes

The hook depends on macOS Keychain access (`security find-generic-password -s "Claude Code-credentials"`) and a network call to `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`. To test locally without restarting Claude Code:

```bash
# Work account (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR unset or = ~/.claude)
bash hooks/show-usage-limits.sh

# Personal account
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/.claude-personal bash hooks/show-usage-limits.sh

# Inspect the cache
cat /tmp/.claude_usage_limits_work.json
cat /tmp/.claude_usage_limits_personal.json
```

The cache file is what the statusline reads — if it doesn't exist or is stale, the `5h:X% 7d:X%` segment won't render.

`scripts/test.sh` is this repo's smoke-test harness — no CI runs it, so run it manually before landing changes:

```bash
bash scripts/test.sh
```

It asserts the load-bearing invariant that `detect_account()` is duplicated verbatim across `statusline-command.sh` and `hooks/show-usage-limits.sh` (the two files install independently via curl, so no shared lib) — the two copies must stay identical.

## Known upstream constraints

- macOS Keychain stores only one Claude Max OAuth token (`Claude Code-credentials`); `/login` on a second account overwrites the first. Tracked at [anthropics/claude-code#20553](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/20553). Work around by re-`/login`-ing on switch.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` env vars override OAuth and force inference-only mode. The hook will still read the keychain, but the active session itself loses Remote Control. Don't export either globally.
