# AGENTS.md — Humanizer Skill

## What this repo is

**Humanizer** is a pure-Markdown Claude Code skill that detects 53 AI writing patterns and rewrites text to sound like a human wrote it. It scores text 0-100 (higher = more AI smell), applies one of 5 named voice profiles, and injects sentence-length burstiness. The installable skill core is a single zero-dependency Markdown file: `skills/humanizer/SKILL.md`. The repo also ships optional extras (on-demand reference files and a zero-dependency metrics CLI) that the skill core never requires.

## How to install the skill

**Cross-agent via the skills CLI ([vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)):**
```bash
npx skills add Aboudjem/humanizer-skill            # any supported agent
npx skills add Aboudjem/humanizer-skill -a claude-code
```
The repo uses the standard `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` layout the CLI auto-discovers.

**Project-scoped (travels with your repo):**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/humanizer && curl -sL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aboudjem/humanizer-skill/main/skills/humanizer/SKILL.md \
  -o .claude/skills/humanizer/SKILL.md
```

**Global (available in every project):**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/humanizer && curl -sL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aboudjem/humanizer-skill/main/skills/humanizer/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/humanizer/SKILL.md
```

**Via Claude Code plugin marketplace:**
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Aboudjem/humanizer-skill
```

Claude Code auto-discovers skills in `.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, or any plugin's `skills/` directory. No restart needed.

## How to invoke the skill

```
/humanizer "Your AI-generated text here"
/humanizer "text" --voice casual
/humanizer "text" --mode detect --score
/humanizer --file docs/README.md --voice technical
/humanizer "text" --aggressive --iterate 3
```

The skill is invoked as `/humanizer`. It auto-triggers when a user asks to:
- "make this sound more human"
- "rewrite this to avoid AI detection"
- "check this for AI tells"
- "humanize this text"
- "clean up the AI writing in this"

## Modes

| Mode | What it does |
|:-----|:-------------|
| `rewrite` | Full transformation with voice injection (default) |
| `detect` | Scan-only — reports patterns and score, no rewrite |
| `edit` | In-place file editing with minimal changes |

## Voice profiles

| Voice | Best for |
|:------|:---------|
| `casual` | Blog posts, social media, community docs |
| `professional` | Business comms, reports, formal docs |
| `technical` | API docs, READMEs, architecture docs |
| `warm` | Tutorials, onboarding, support content |
| `blunt` | Reviews, internal comms, direct feedback |

## How to test

The skill itself is pure Markdown, so test it by running it:

1. Install the skill (see above).
2. Open Claude Code in any project.
3. Run: `/humanizer "In today's rapidly evolving landscape, AI is reshaping how we think about creativity. This groundbreaking shift represents a pivotal moment in human history." --mode detect --score`
4. Expected output: a high score with patterns P1, P4, P7, P29, P30 flagged.
5. Run: `/humanizer "..." --voice casual` — verify the rewrite has shorter/varied sentences and no "pivotal"/"reshaping"/"rapidly evolving".
