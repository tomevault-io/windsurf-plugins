description: Collapse synonym connectors like Gmail and email into one brand name

# One connector per service

Connectors render as chips with a brand mark. Different labels that map to the same mark are duplicates.

- Keep **one name per service**. Prefer the brand: `Gmail` not `email`, `Chrome` not `browser`, `X` not `Twitter`, `Calendar` not `gcal`.
- Do not list both `Gmail` and `email`, `Chrome` and `browser`, `Calendar` and `gcal`, `GitHub` and `gh`.
- Case-only repeats (`Slack` / `slack`) are the same connector.
- Distinct services stay distinct (`Gmail` and `Calendar` are fine).

When extracting, patching, or QA-ing a filing, collapse synonyms in `connectors` before writing.
