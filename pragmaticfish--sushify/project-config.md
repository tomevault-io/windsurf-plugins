## Terminal
- Remember to run `nvm use` in your terminal to avoid node version errors

## Test and temporary files
- Place temporary files such as ad hoc tests under .local-files whenever possible. Make a subfolder for them when needed (e.g. scripts). This folder is git ignored.

## Typescript
- Never use explicit or implicit 'any'.
- Prefer types over interfaces.
- Don't create duplicate type definitions. Instead create in a proper, shared file (e.g types.ts).
- Always use named exports, never default exports (the only exception Svelte components - they auto export as default)
- Always use static imports and not dynamic unless we explicitly agree on a dynamic import in a specific case - in chat.


## Svelte
- Always include a key in each blocks

## General
- Check for typescript/lint/svelte errors when you've completed a change and fix all of them.
- Review all the changes you made with fresh eyes before returning to the user.
- If unsure about why something in the system is the way it is, consult with the user before deleting or drastically altering it
- CRITICAL: Never commit for me. Only I commit code.
