# Phistory Agent Guide

Phistory archives versioned system prompt snapshots from agent CLIs. It installs a specific CLI release, runs it once through `claude-tap`, captures the prompt-bearing HTTP request, and stores normalized Markdown plus raw trace evidence under `captures/`.

This file is for future coding agents. Read it before changing the project.

## Project Shape

- `phistory/registry.py`: supported agent definitions. Add or adjust CLI support here first.
- `phistory/models.py`: shared dataclasses and type literals for package sources, tap modes, and capture results.
- `phistory/packages.py`: version discovery and installation for `npm`, `pypi`, and `github-release` sources.
- `phistory/capture.py`: installs an agent, creates an isolated HOME, runs `claude-tap`, exports `prompt.md`, copies `trace.jsonl`, writes `meta.json`, and normalizes volatile text in prompt Markdown only.
- `phistory/workflow.py`: orchestration for latest captures and backfills.
- `phistory/storage.py`: capture directory preparation, cleanup, trace copying, and metadata writing.
- `phistory/render.py`: regenerates `README.md` from capture metadata.
- `phistory/site.py`: regenerates the single-file static web UI in `index.html`.
- `phistory/cli.py`: CLI entrypoint for `capture`, `backfill`, `render-index`, and `render-site`.
- `tests/`: focused unit and local integration tests for package sources, registry contracts, capture behavior, and rendering.
- `.github/workflows/capture.yml`: hourly capture workflow. It runs lint, tests, latest smoke capture for all agents, real latest capture, renders artifacts, and commits updates.
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml`: GitHub Pages deployment for the static site.

Generated capture artifacts live in:

```text
captures/<agent>/<version>/prompt.md
captures/<agent>/<version>/trace.jsonl
captures/<agent>/<version>/meta.json
```

`prompt.md` is normalized for human reading and diffs. `trace.jsonl` is raw evidence and should not be rewritten for presentation-only cleanup.

## Capture Principle

Phistory does not call the real model provider when exporting prompts. It relies on `claude-tap --export-prompt`, which captures the request body and returns a protocol-specific dummy response.

Typical latest capture:

```bash
uv run phistory capture --latest --agents claude-code,codex,openclaw,hermes,kimi,opencode,pi
```

For each agent/version, the flow is:

1. Discover versions through `phistory.packages`.
2. Install the exact release into `.phistory-cache/installs/<agent>/<version>/`.
3. Create a temporary isolated HOME and XDG directories.
4. Write only the minimal fake auth/config needed for the CLI to emit a prompt-bearing request.
5. Launch `python -m claude_tap run <tap_client> --export-prompt ... -- <agent command>`.
6. Save `prompt.md`, raw `trace.jsonl`, and `meta.json`.
7. Remove temporary tap output unless `--keep-tap` is used.

Do not add direct model API calls to Phistory. The capture boundary is `claude-tap`.

## Supported Agents

Current agents are defined in `phistory/registry.py`:

- `claude-code`: npm package `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`, tap client `claude`.
- `codex`: npm package `@openai/codex`, tap client `codex`, fake ChatGPT auth enabled.
- `openclaw`: npm package `openclaw`, tap client `openclaw`, Node 24 wrapper, isolated OpenClaw config.
- `hermes`: GitHub release source `NousResearch/hermes-agent`, tap client `hermes`, OpenRouter provider path.
- `kimi`: GitHub release source `MoonshotAI/kimi-cli`, tap client `kimi`, isolated Kimi TOML config.
- `opencode`: npm package `opencode-ai`, tap client `opencode`, reverse tap mode so opencode can fetch its model registry while the model request is redirected locally.
- `pi`: npm package `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, tap client `pi`, isolated Pi provider config.

When adding another CLI, prefer extending the existing abstractions:

- Add a `PackageSource` only if `npm`, `pypi`, or `github-release` cannot model the release channel.
- Add a `HomeProfile` only when the CLI needs isolated config files. Keep config minimal and deterministic.
- Add a `TapMode` only when the existing `auto`, `reverse`, or `forward` modes are insufficient.
- Keep `AgentSpec.run_args` as the normal user-facing CLI command that makes the tool send one prompt-bearing request.

## Design Rules

- Do not patch around broken historical releases with bespoke compatibility hacks. If a package cannot install or start far enough to emit a request, let that version fail and move on.
- Do not add one-off version maps unless there is a stable upstream rule behind them.
- Prefer official release metadata: npm registry for npm packages, PyPI JSON for Python packages, GitHub Releases for release-tagged projects.
- Keep raw traces raw. Normalize only `prompt.md` via the sanitizer in `capture.py`.
- Keep generated files deterministic enough for CI and GitHub Pages. After changing capture, render, registry, or package logic, run both render commands.
