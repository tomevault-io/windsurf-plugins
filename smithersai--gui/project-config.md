# Smithers GUI — Agent Instructions

You are working inside the Smithers GUI macOS app repository. This app provides a native interface for the Smithers workflow orchestrator and JJHub code collaboration platform.

## Smithers CLI

The `smithers` CLI (package: `smithers-orchestrator`) manages durable AI workflow execution.

### Quick Reference

```
smithers up         Start a workflow execution (-d for background)
smithers ps         List active, paused, and recently completed runs
smithers logs       Tail the event log of a run
smithers inspect    Show detailed run state: steps, agents, approvals, outputs
smithers chat       Show agent chat output for a run
smithers approve    Approve a paused approval gate
smithers deny       Deny a paused approval gate
smithers cancel     Halt agents and terminate a run
smithers hijack     Hand off a resumable agent session
smithers revert     Revert workspace to a previous task attempt's state
smithers graph      Render the workflow graph without executing
smithers node       Show enriched node details for debugging
smithers memory     View cross-run memory facts and semantic recall
smithers scores     View scorer results for a run
smithers timeline   View execution timeline and forks
smithers diff       Compare two snapshots (time travel diff)
smithers fork       Branch a run from a snapshot checkpoint
smithers replay     Fork from checkpoint and resume execution
smithers cron       Manage background schedule triggers
