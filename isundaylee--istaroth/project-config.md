# Docker dev stack

Never run bare `docker compose up` from `docker-compose/web/`.

- **Start**: `scripts/dev-compose.sh up` (runs detached)
- **URLs**: run `scripts/dev-compose.sh urls` before testing the web UI or API; use the printed `CONDUCTOR_PORT` URL
- **Stop**: `scripts/dev-compose.sh down` (also runs automatically via `sessionEnd` hook when the agent session ends)
- **Setup only** (symlink env files): `scripts/dev-compose.sh setup`

`uv-cache` and `hf-cache` Docker volumes are shared across worktrees intentionally.
