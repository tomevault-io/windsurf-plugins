## Code Quality Principles

<!-- https://github.com/mieweb/template-mieweb-opensource/blob/main/.github/copilot-instructions.md -->

### 🎯 DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **Never duplicate code**: If you find yourself copying code, extract it into a reusable function
- **Single source of truth**: Each piece of knowledge should have one authoritative representation
- **Refactor mercilessly**: When you see duplication, eliminate it immediately
- **Shared utilities**: Common patterns should be abstracted into utility functions

### 💋 KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **Simple solutions**: Prefer the simplest solution that works
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Don't add complexity for hypothetical future needs
- **Clear naming**: Functions and variables should be self-documenting
- **Small functions**: Break down complex functions into smaller, focused ones
- **Readable code**: Code should be obvious to understand at first glance

### 🧹 Folder Philosophy
- **Clear purpose**: Every folder should have a main thing that anchors its contents.
- **No junk drawers**: Don’t leave loose files without context or explanation.
- **Explain relationships**: If it’s not elegantly obvious how files fit together, add a README or note.
- **Immediate clarity**: Opening a folder should make its organizing principle clear at a glance.

### 🔄 Refactoring Guidelines
- **Continuous improvement**: Refactor as you work, not as a separate task
- **Safe refactoring**: Always run tests before and after refactoring
- **Incremental changes**: Make small, safe changes rather than large rewrites
- **Preserve behavior**: Refactoring should not change external behavior
- **Code reviews**: All refactoring should be reviewed for correctness

### ⚰️ Dead Code Management
- **Immediate removal**: Delete unused code immediately when identified
- **Historical preservation**: Move significant dead code to `.attic/` directory with context
- **Documentation**: Include comments explaining why code was moved to attic
- **Regular cleanup**: Review and clean attic directory periodically
- **No accumulation**: Don't let dead code accumulate in active codebase

### 🌐 Testing with MCP Browser
- Use MCP browser in Playwright if available to test functionality
- **Never close the browser** after running MCP browser commands unless explicitly asked
- Let the user interact with the browser after navigation or testing
- Only use `browser_close` when the user specifically requests it

## Production vs Development Mode

### 🚀 Environment Detection
- **Check `.env` for `MYNAME`**: Before testing, check if `MYNAME` is defined in the server `.env` file
- **If `MYNAME` is defined**: This indicates a production/proxy environment
  - Don't restart for UI changes; just build with `npm run build` in the client folder.  If you need to restart the server, just ask the user to do it.
  - Use the `MYNAME` URL (e.g., `https://pulseclip.os.mieweb.org/`) for all browser testing
  - Do NOT use `localhost` URLs for testing - the app is behind an nginx proxy
- **If `MYNAME` is not defined**: Use development mode with `localhost:3000`

### 🔧 Testing Workflow
1. Read `server/.env` to check for `MYNAME` variable
2. If `MYNAME` exists, build and start the server: `npm run build && npm run start`
3. Navigate to the `MYNAME` URL for browser testing (not localhost)
4. The nginx proxy handles routing to the local server

## HTML & CSS Guidelines
- **Semantic Naming**: Every `<div>` and other structural element must use a meaningful, semantic class name that clearly indicates its purpose or role within the layout.
- **CSS Simplicity**: Styles should avoid global resets or overrides that affect unrelated components or default browser behavior. Keep changes scoped and minimal.
- **SASS-First Approach**: All styles should be written in SASS (SCSS) whenever possible. Each component should have its own dedicated SASS file to promote modularity and maintainability.

## Accessibility (ARIA Labeling)

### 🎯 Interactive Elements
- **All interactive elements** (buttons, links, forms, dialogs) must include appropriate ARIA roles and labels
- **Use ARIA attributes**: Implement aria-label, aria-labelledby, and aria-describedby to provide clear, descriptive information for screen readers
- **Semantic HTML**: Use semantic HTML wherever possible to enhance accessibility

### 📢 Dynamic Content
- **Announce updates**: Ensure all dynamic content updates (modals, alerts, notifications) are announced to assistive technologies using aria-live regions
- **Maintain tab order**: Maintain logical tab order and keyboard navigation for all features
- **Visible focus**: Provide visible focus indicators for all interactive elements

## Internationalization (I18N)

### 🌍 Text and Language Support
- **Externalize text**: All user-facing text must be externalized for translation
- **Multiple languages**: Support multiple languages, including right-to-left (RTL) languages such as Arabic and Hebrew
- **Language selector**: Provide a language selector for users to choose their preferred language

### 🕐 Localization
- **Format localization**: Ensure date, time, number, and currency formats are localized based on user settings
