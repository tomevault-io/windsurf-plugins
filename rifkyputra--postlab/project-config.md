# postlab — Cursor agent rules

## Project
Rust TUI bare-metal server manager. Runs as root (enforced in main.rs). Stack: ratatui, crossterm, sqlx/SQLite, clap.

## Build commands
- Dev build:     `make build`
- Check/lint:    `make check`   (cargo check + clippy, zero-warnings policy)
- Tests:         `make test`
- Run TUI:       `make run`     (requires root)
- Release build: `make build-release`

**Always run `make check && make test` before marking a task complete. Both must pass.**

## Feature reference
`feature_list.json` (repo root) is the source of truth for all screens, tabs, and CLI commands. Read it before adding, renaming, or describing any feature. If you add or rename a screen, tab, or CLI command, update `feature_list.json` before closing the task.

## Architecture map
- `cli/src/main.rs`        — entrypoint, root check, DB init, CLI routing
- `cli/src/tui/app.rs`     — App state + screen dispatch
- `cli/src/tui/events.rs`  — crossterm event loop
- `cli/src/tui/screens/`   — one file per TUI screen
- `cli/src/core/`          — platform-specific adapters (packages, docker, firewall, gateway, deploy, security, ssh, …)
- `cli/src/db/`            — sqlx pool + audit + deployments
- `migrations/`            — append-only SQL schema (CONFIRM before editing)

## Hard constraints
- Do NOT remove or weaken the root check in `main.rs`.
- `migrations/*.sql` are irreversible — ask the user before creating or modifying any migration.
- `.github/workflows/` affects CI for all targets — ask the user before modifying.
- `install.sh` runs as root on user systems — ask the user before modifying.
- `binaries/` contains pre-built artifacts — do not edit; use `make build-linux` or `make build-all`.
- No new external dependencies (services, databases) without explicit discussion.

## Code style
- No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious.
- No docstrings or multi-line comment blocks.
- No premature abstractions — solve the task, no more.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- Clippy warnings are build errors — zero tolerance.

## TUI changes
Cannot be verified headlessly. State explicitly if visual verification was skipped.
