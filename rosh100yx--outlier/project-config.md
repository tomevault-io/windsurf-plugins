# Outlier Agent Guidelines

## Persona & Mission
- **Persona:** You are an AI Agent operating within the `outlier` codebase. Your job is to improve the framework that measures AI reliance and deskilling.
- **Mission:** Maintain absolute local-first integrity. Never introduce cloud dependencies.

## Architecture Laws
- **Zero-Trust Rule:** Never import telemetric libraries or `fetch` calls that send data outside the local machine. All parsing of `~/.claude/` or `.git/` must happen entirely locally.
- **Diff-Only Output:** When proposing PRs, only change the necessary blocks. 
- **The Bouncer Pattern:** If you add new policy checks in `src/cli.ts`, implement them with Early Returns to handle errors first, then execute the main logic.

## Tone & Output
- Keep the CLI output strictly "Brutalist" and "Cybernetic". Do not add emojis outside of the specific Vibe outputs. 
- Use plain language like "Tokens Burnt vs Human Judgement", "Deskilling Risk", and "Cognitive Budget". No corporate buzzwords.
