# CLAUDE.md — Aegis: RallyPower (folder: Aegis_RallyPower)

Project brief for Claude Code. Read this fully before editing anything.

## What this is

**Aegis: RallyPower** (part of the Aegis addon series, like Aegis_SBR).
Naming rules: the install folder and TOC are **`Aegis_RallyPower`**; our code
namespace, globals, frame names, and saved variables use the **`AegisRP`**
prefix (`AegisRP_Settings`, `AegisRP.Assign`, …); Core files are
`Core/Aegis_*.lua`. The embedded PallyPower engine keeps its own
`PallyPower_*`/`PP_*` names and the `PLPWR` addon-message prefix (locked
byte-compat with stock PallyPower); our sync channel prefix stays `RPCX`.
It extends
the PallyPower paladin buff addon to **all nine
classes** — a unified raid buff/utility coordinator for **Turtle WoW 1.18.1**,
which is a **1.12.1 client (Lua 5.0)** with the **SuperWoW** and **VanillaFixes**
client mods. It is a fork of PallyPowerTW; the **visual and functional gold
standard is PallyPower 3.3.5 (WotLK)** — reference source:
`github.com/AznamirWoW/PallyPower` (clone it; `PallyPower_Wrath.xml` +
`PallyPowerValues.lua` are the spec for frames, colors, dimensions).

Current version: **0.14.0**. See `CHANGELOG.md` for the full history and
`docs/` for the design documents and interactive HTML concepts.

## Hard environment rules (violating these bricks the addon)

**Lua 5.0, not 5.1.** Never use:
- `#` length operator → use `table.getn(t)`
- `string.gmatch` → use `string.gfind`
- `select(...)` → does not exist
- numeric `%` modulo → use `math.mod`
- varargs beyond the implicit `arg` table

**1.12 widget API:**
- Frame handlers receive **implicit globals**: `this`, `event`, `arg1`… —
  there is no `self`/`event` parameter.
- **Definition order matters**: a `local function` must be defined before any
  reference, or forward-declared (`local Foo` … later `Foo = function() end`).
- No `C_Timer`, no secure templates, **no combat lockdown** (casting from code
  is legal in combat — a genuine advantage over retail).
- Timers/tickers = `OnUpdate` with an accumulator on `arg1`.

**SuperWoW** (detected via `SUPERWOW_VERSION`) — always guard and always keep a
bare-1.12 fallback:
- `UnitBuff(unit, i)` additionally returns the aura **spell id** (3rd return);
  `UnitDebuff` returns it 4th.
- `CastSpellByName(spell, unit)` casts directly at the unit (no target dance).
- Buff/debuff **ids are learned at runtime** from the icon seed — never
  hard-code aura ids (Turtle's may differ from Vanilla).

**Turtle deltas:** blessing durations are forced (10 min normal / 30 min
greater). Totem/sting/curse durations use Vanilla defaults at the top of each
class module — verify on-realm and edit there if Turtle differs. Spell-name
matching is exact; if a Turtle rename breaks a lookup, fix the name string.

## Verification workflow (mandatory)

After **every** edit:

```
python3 scripts/verify.py
```

Checks structural balance and Lua 5.1-isms across `Core/` + `Classes/` +
`PallyPower/`. The vendored engine is scanned as a tripwire — it should stay
untouched, and a failure there means something edited it. There
is no standalone Lua here; the real test is in-game — errors print to chat
(the Core wraps risky paths in `pcall` and prints `AegisRP error: …`).
Use `/rpc test` (test mode) to exercise everything on an under-levelled
character: all options appear (unlearned marked `*`), clicks simulate casts
and start real timers.

## Architecture map

Load order (`Aegis_RallyPower.toc`):
```
Locale\*                       localization
PallyPower\*                   the ORIGINAL PallyPower engine (see below)
Core\Aegis_Core.lua     class-independent coverage engine + class-buff strip
Core\Aegis_Strip.lua    shared strip engine + helpers
Classes\Class_*.lua            one module per class
Core\Aegis_Options.lua  the tabbed options frame
Core\Aegis_Popout.lua   loads LAST (legacy hover handler + paladin test graft)
```

**Every non-paladin class is now a strip.** There is one visual family: the
100×34 paladin-template button, stacked in a movable titled strip (drag dot,
scale grip, saved position). Priest/Mage/Druid render the **class-buff strip**
(`AegisRP.BuildClassBuffs`, one button per raid class, with the player
pop-out on hover); Warrior/Shaman/Hunter/Warlock/Rogue render their own
self-contained strips. No bespoke grid bar exists anymore.

**Paladin = the legacy engine, wrapped not rewritten (locked decision).**
`PallyPower\PallyPower.lua/.xml` run unmodified; `PallyPower.xml` loads its lua
via a relative `<Script>` (they must stay in the same folder). The player
pop-out (`Core\Aegis_Popout.lua`) grafts onto its buff bar by replacing
`PallyPowerBuffButton_OnEnter`, reading the engine's own per-button data
(`btn.have/need/range/dead`, `LastCastPlayer`) and casting through its
spellbook tables (`AllPallys`, `GetNormalBlessings`). The pop-out rows are an
exact replica of the WotLK `PallyPowerPopupTemplate` (100×34, Smooth skin +
Blizzard Tooltip border, official colors: Good `0,0.7,0` / NeedAll `1,0,0` /
Special `0,0,1`, all 0.5 alpha).

**Class-buff classes** (Priest, Mage, Druid): declare
`M = AegisRP:NewClass("TOKEN"); M.buffs = { {name, group, icons, ids?,
pet, dur, gdur, selfcast}, ... }` (+ optional `M.utility`), plus
