# CLAUDE.md — Agent Labor Market

> This file is read by Claude Code at the start of every session.
> It contains everything needed to understand and continue building this project.

## ⚠️ Check Memory First

Before starting work, **read the memory files** for the latest project state:
- `project_terminology_redesign.md` — **DECISIONS LOCKED**: Client/Worker/Manager. Job not task. /jobs not /verify. Ready for implementation.
- `project_agent_labor_market.md` — Core vision, what's built, community direction.
- `feedback_terminology_decisions.md` — Job not task, /jobs not /verify, dynamic spot checks, AVNC in x402.
- `feedback_no_push_main.md` — Use feature branches, never push to main.
- `feedback_no_gh_cli.md` — No gh CLI. Push branch and give URL for PRs.
- `feedback_production_focus.md` — Build for production. Three-layer architecture is sacred.

**Status (March 29, 2026):**
- RENAME COMPLETE: miner→worker, validator→manager in all files, endpoints, imports, UI
- Branch: `feature/enforce-role-separation` (includes role separation + rename)
- PR #44 still open on GitHub — merge before pushing this branch
- Still TODO: README rewrite, skill.md rewrite, agent.json update, /verify→/jobs endpoint rename

**Full system design document:** `~/Desktop/docs/agent_labor_market.html`
**Plan file:** `~/.claude/plans/lexical-greeting-babbage.md`

## What This Project Is

An open **job-agnostic marketplace for AI agents**. Clients post jobs, workers do them, managers check quality using spot checks (jobs with known answers). Everything on Base Mainnet.

**Three roles:**
- **Client** — posts jobs, pays for results (API key, x402, or on-chain escrow)
- **Worker** (currently "miner" in code) — does the work, earns 85% of payment
- **Manager** (currently "validator" in code) — routes jobs, runs spot checks, scores quality, earns 15% fee

**The core loop:**
1. Client submits a job + intent ("what should this code do?")
2. Manager routes to all registered workers + mixes in spot checks
3. Workers independently analyze (AST parsing + pattern detection + LLM intent matching)
4. Manager scores everyone: spot check accuracy + consensus + format + speed
5. Best result returned to client. ALL workers get rated (even losers).
6. Ratings recorded on-chain via AgentScorer.sol

**Three verticals live:** Code verification, text review, image validation. Protocol is job-agnostic — any vertical where ground truth can be constructed.

**Four payment methods:** API key credits (free tier), x402 micropayments (ETH/USDC/AVNC), on-chain escrow (AVNC), faucet (free 20 AVNC).

## Origin

Started as the **Agent Orchestration Protocol** — a system for coordinating multiple AI agents. Self-verification is self-referential. This project externalizes verification to a competitive market.

First version was a **Bittensor subnet** (~3,200 lines). Core verification logic was chain-agnostic, so we extracted it and rebuilt for Ethereum/Base.

## Terminology Rename (IN PROGRESS)

The codebase currently uses crypto terms. We are renaming to universal terms:

| Concept | Current (code) | Target | On-chain |
|---------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Does work | miner | **worker** | `provider` |
| Checks quality | validator | **manager** | `evaluator` |
| The work | task | **job** | — |
| Quality test | honeypot | **spot check** | — |
| Quality metric | score | **rating** | — |
| Main endpoint | /verify | **/jobs** | — |
| Browse work | marketplace | **job board** | — |

### Files to rename:
```
agent_market/miner/        → agent_market/worker/
agent_market/validator/    → agent_market/manager/
agents/miner_agent.py      → agents/worker_agent.py
agents/validator_agent.py  → agents/manager_agent.py
agents/miner_strategies.py → agents/worker_strategies.py
web/app/become-a-miner/   → web/app/become-a-worker/
web/app/become-a-validator/ → web/app/become-a-manager/
Dockerfile.miner           → Dockerfile.worker
```

### Endpoints (done / still TODO):
```
POST /register-miner     → POST /register-worker  ✅ DONE
POST /register-validator → POST /register-manager  ✅ DONE
POST /verify             → POST /jobs              ❌ TODO (next phase)
```
