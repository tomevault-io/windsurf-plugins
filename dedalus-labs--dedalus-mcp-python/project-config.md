# Guidelines for Coding Agents

Dedalus MCP implements the Model Context Protocol. Spec-faithful, minimal surface.

## Quick Reference

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| MCP spec | `internals/references/modelcontextprotocol/` |
| Reference SDK | `internals/references/python-sdk/` |
| Server core | `src/dedalus_mcp/server/core.py` |
| Versioning | `src/dedalus_mcp/versioning.py` |
| Types | `src/dedalus_mcp/types/` |
| Tests | `tests/` |

## Before You Code

**Scan wide before you write.** Search for logic that already does what you need. Search for logic that could help your implementation. Understand where your contribution fits contextually within this codebase. Don't write a single line until you understand these relationships.

1. Grep (or rg) the codebase for related functionality. It may already exist!
2. Find the spec section for what you're implementing
3. Look at similar existing code for patterns and conventions
4. Identify code that your implementation should integrate with

## Test-Driven Development

**Write tests first.** This project follows TDD. Don't implement features in a vacuum—define what "correct" looks like before you write production code.

**The workflow:**

1. **Create or update an execspec** — For any significant work, maintain a local `EXECSPEC-{topic}.md` in `docs/dedalus_mcp/`. This is your working document: what you're building, what invariants must hold, what's done, what's next.

2. **Write a failing test** — Before implementing, write a test that captures an invariant from your execspec. The test should fail because the feature doesn't exist yet.

3. **Make it pass** — Write the minimal code to make the test pass. No more.

4. **Refactor** — Clean up while tests are green.

5. **Repeat** — Each passing test is a small victory. Accumulate these toward the full vision.

**Example execspec structure:**

```markdown
# EXECSPEC: Elicitation Support

## Goal
Implement client-side elicitation per MCP 2025-06-18.

## Invariants
- [ ] `elicit()` raises if server doesn't advertise elicitation capability
- [ ] Timeout triggers `ElicitationTimeoutError`
- [ ] Response schema is validated against `ElicitationResult`

## Progress
- [x] Basic request/response flow
- [ ] Timeout handling
- [ ] Schema validation
```

**Why this matters:** Tests are executable documentation. When you write `test_elicit_raises_without_capability()`, you're stating a contract. Future changes that break this contract will fail loudly. The execspec keeps you honest—it's easy to lose sight of the goal mid-implementation.

See `docs/dedalus_mcp/EXECSPEC*.md` for examples of how we track larger features.

## Core Rules

**Fail loudly.** Never silently degrade. Unknown enum? Raise. Unsupported version? Raise. Invalid config? Raise.

```python
# Bad
def get_version(v: str) -> str:
    return VERSIONS.get(v, "2025-06-18")  # Silent fallback

# Good
def get_version(v: str) -> str:
    if v not in VERSIONS:
        raise UnsupportedProtocolVersionError(v)
    return VERSIONS[v]
```

Silent fallbacks create bugs that "work" until production. Explicit failures are debuggable.

**Cite the spec.** Link to the spec clause in docstrings or comments.

```python
async def list_tools(self) -> ListToolsResult:
    """List available tools.

    See: docs/mcp/spec/schema-reference/tools-list.md
    """
```

**Minimal dependencies.** This project respects developers' dependency budgets. Every dependency is a burden on downstream users—install weight, security surface, version conflicts. Don't add packages unless absolutely necessary.

Core deps: `mcp`, `pydantic`. Everything else is optional. Before adding a dependency:
- Can you implement it in <50 lines? Do that instead.
- Is it only needed for one feature? Make it an optional extra.
- Is it a dev/test dependency? Keep it out of the main install.

**Prefer enums over constants.** Use `Enum`/`StrEnum`/`IntEnum` instead of module-level constants or raw dicts. Enums give you type safety, autocomplete, exhaustiveness checking in `match` statements, and self-documentation. See `docs/style/best-practices.md` for examples.

## Registration Pattern

Decorators attach metadata. `collect()` registers.

```python
from dedalus_mcp import MCPServer, tool

@tool(description="Add numbers")
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

server = MCPServer("math")
server.collect(add)
```

Same function can register to multiple servers. No global state.

## Versioning

Dedalus MCP is a **temporal inscription of the MCP spec**—it respects that the protocol evolves over time. Every feature has a version where it originated, and our code must reflect this.

**Before implementing any feature, ask:**
- Which MCP version introduced this feature?
- Does it exist in earlier versions? If so, where did it originate?
- Is this a version-specific change, or does it span multiple versions?

Protocol versions are tracked in `src/dedalus_mcp/versioning.py`. Check `docs/dedalus_mcp/version-matrix.md` to see what exists where.

**When adding version-specific behavior:**

```python
from dedalus_mcp.versioning import current_profile, FeatureId

profile = current_profile()
if profile.supports(FeatureId.PROGRESS_MESSAGE_FIELD):
    message = "Processing..."
else:
    message = None
