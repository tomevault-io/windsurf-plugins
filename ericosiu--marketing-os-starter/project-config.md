## Proactive Skill Routing

**Claude should auto-invoke marketing skills based on intent. Never wait for a slash command.**

Full routing table: `.claude/rules/proactive-routing.md`. Key rules:

1. **If the request is about writing, research, strategy, or marketing** — invoke the matching skill immediately. Don't ask "should I use /copywriting?" — just use it.
2. **If the request is a full campaign** ("promote X", "launch X", "build a campaign for X") — run the pipeline: `/research` -> `/campaign-brief` -> relevant copy/ads/email skills.
3. **Before any marketing skill**, check memory files: `brand-voice.md`, `campaign-history.md`.
4. **Never ask "which skill should I use?"** — ask about the desired OUTCOME, then route silently.

---

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Never fabricate** client names, revenue numbers, or case study data. If you don't know, say so.
2. **Never guess** API keys, credentials, or secrets. Ask or check .env files.
3. **Never publish, send, or post anything** without explicit human approval.
4. **Never allocate budget** without human approval — recommend only.
5. **Always test before saying "done."** Show proof it works.
