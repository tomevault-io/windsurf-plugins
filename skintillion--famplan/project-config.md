Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project Context

A Fundraiser Webapplication for schools and organizations to manage fundraisers, schools, organizations, students, and their associated donations.

## Code Style and Structure

-   Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
-   Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
-   Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
-   Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
-   Structure repository files as follows:

## Tech Stack

-   Laravel 12
-   TypeScript
-   Vuetify 3
-   Pinia

## Naming Conventions

-   Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/form-wizard)
-   Favor named exports for components and utilities
-   Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., VisaForm.tsx)
-   Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., formValidator.ts)

## TypeScript Usage

-   Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
-   Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const' assertion
-   Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
-   Define strict types for message passing between different parts of the extension
-   Use absolute imports for all files @/...
-   Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's good reason to translate or handle error in that abstraction
-   Use explicit return types for all functions

## State Management

-   Use Pinia for state management

## Syntax and Formatting

-   Use "function" keyword for pure functions
-   Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals

## UI and Styling

-   Use Vuetify 3 components and styling
-   Use flat button backgrounds for all buttons (variant="flat")
-   Use consistent color schemes across components
-   Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes
-   Follow Material Design principles for spacing and typography

## Error Handling

-   Implement proper error boundaries
-   Log errors appropriately for debugging
-   Provide user-friendly error messages
-   Handle network failures gracefully

## Testing

-   Write unit tests for utilities and components

## Security

-   Sanitize user inputs
-   Handle sensitive data properly

## Git Usage

Commit Message Prefixes:

-   "fix:" for bug fixes
-   "feat:" for new features
-   "perf:" for performance improvements
-   "docs:" for documentation changes
-   "style:" for formatting changes
-   "refactor:" for code refactoring
-   "test:" for adding missing tests
-   "chore:" for maintenance tasks

Rules:

-   Use lowercase for commit messages
-   Keep the summary line concise
