# Kaiten: instructions for coding agents

Kaiten is an open-source SaaS management tool: a Go API, a React console, Helm
charts and shared frontend packages, in one repository. This file is read by
Codex; `CLAUDE.md` imports it for Claude Code. Human contributors: start with
[README.md](./README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `api/` | Backend API in Go (`api/internal/modules/<module>/<usecase>/`) |
| `app/` | The web console: React, TypeScript, TanStack, Vite+ |
| `app/docs/` | Frontend documentation; start at `app/docs/AI_CONTEXT.md` |
| `charts/` | Helm charts (`kaiten`, `kaiten-infra`) |
| `packages/` | Workspace packages: `theme` (design tokens), `api-codegen` (SDK generation) |
| `docker/`, `compose.yml` | Local stack: Envoy, RabbitMQ, Dapr, database |
| `.agents/skills/` | Agent skills (see below) |

## Install and run

- Prerequisites are listed in `README.md`. Node 24 is pinned in `app/.nvmrc`;
  pnpm is pinned by the `packageManager` field of the root `package.json`.
- Install the workspace once, from the repository root: `pnpm install`.
- `cp .env.example .env`, then `task dev`: the whole backend stack in Docker,
  fake product data, the generated API client and the frontend dev server.
  `task up` starts the stack without the frontend; `task down` stops it;
  `task --list` shows every task.
- Run package scripts with `pnpm run <script>`, from the directory that owns
  them (`app/` for the console).

## Architecture rules (frontend)

- The rules are written once, in `app/docs/AI_CONTEXT.md`: the
  [layers](app/docs/AI_CONTEXT.md#layers), the
  [import rules](app/docs/AI_CONTEXT.md#import-rules) and the
  [principles](app/docs/AI_CONTEXT.md#principles). The details are in
  `app/docs/01-architecture/`.
- Two commands enforce the import rules, both from `app/`:
  `pnpm run check:architecture` (the dependency direction between layers) and
  `pnpm run lint` (npm package imports, what routes may use, file names). The
  principles are enforced by review only: the `app-architecture-guardian` skill
  and the `architecture-reviewer` subagent check what no script does.

## Before a pull request

The checklist is in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#before-you-open-a-pull-request): one item per
area (frontend, backend, design tokens, charts, documentation, commits). The
`pr-check` skill runs it and reports a summary.

## Generated files: never edit by hand

Regenerate them instead; the hooks in `.claude/settings.json` and
`.codex/hooks.json` refuse edits to the first two.

- `app/src/api-client/**`: `pnpm run generate` in `app/` (not tracked).
- `app/src/routeTree.gen.ts`: written by the TanStack Router plugin when the
  dev server or a build runs.
- `app/src/lib/api/scopes.gen.ts`: written by `pnpm run generate`.
- `app/openapi.yaml`, `app/platform-openapi.yaml`: `task generate:oas`, from the
  Go source.
- Go files headed `Code generated ... DO NOT EDIT` (sqlc output under
  `infrastructure/db`, gqlgen's `generated` package): `task generate:sqlc` and
  `task generate:gqlgen`.

## Skills and subagents

- Skills live in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (Codex reads them there).
  `.claude/skills/<name>` is a relative symlink to the same folder for Claude
  Code; add one when you add a skill:
  `ln -s ../../.agents/skills/<name> .claude/skills/<name>`.
- Workflow skills: `pr-check`, `generate-api`, `generate-api-errors`,
  `new-feature`, `frontend-quality-gate`, `api-client-regeneration-check`,
  `docs-sync-enforcer`.
- Frontend review skills: `app-architecture-guardian`,
  `detail-view-duplication-watch`, `dialog-via-route-guard`,
  `feature-template-scaffolder`, `forms-zod-source-of-truth`,
  `i18n-hardcoded-text-scanner`, `query-key-invalidation-auditor`,
  `state-layer-separation-check`, `table-pattern-enforcer`.
- The `architecture-reviewer` subagent is defined twice with the same text:
  `.claude/agents/architecture-reviewer.md` and
  `.codex/agents/architecture-reviewer.toml`. Change both together.

## House rules

- Write documentation, code comments and commit messages in English.
- User-visible text goes through i18n: add each key to both
  `app/src/lib/i18n/locales/en.ts` and `fr.ts` (`pnpm run check:i18n-parity`,
  `pnpm run check:i18n-keys`).
- Verify that a command exists (`package.json` scripts, `Taskfile.yml`) before
  you write it into a doc or a skill.
