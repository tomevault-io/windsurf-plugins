# AI Agent Instructions — Auto Planner Module

> **STOP. Read this file before writing any code in this directory.**

## What is this?

This directory contains the **Automatic Ascension Planner** — a sequential multi-ascension plan builder for the Egg, Inc. ascension planner. The user builds their own ascension chain one step at a time, choosing a TE goal for each ascension. Each ascension's end state flows into the next. Changing an earlier ascension recalculates everything downstream.

## Required Reading

Before making ANY code changes in this directory or its subdirectories, you MUST:

1. **Read `PLAN.md` in this directory** — This is the complete feature specification. It contains:
   - The sequential plan builder concept and state chaining rules
   - The 13-shift ascension template and what each shift does
   - The C3 research strategy with its A/B condition matrix
   - SE tracking across ascensions
   - Event calendar (Monday 2× earnings, Friday research sales)
   - The `AscensionSummary` interface
   - Export/import format

2. **Read `IMPLEMENTATION.md`** — The phased implementation plan with step-by-step instructions.

3. **Understand the existing engine** — This module reuses (does NOT duplicate) the existing engine:
   - `src/engine/compute.ts` — `computeSnapshot()` (use with `skipGrowth: true`)
   - `src/engine/apply/actions.ts` — `applyAction()` for pure state transitions
   - `src/calculations/commonResearch.ts` — research pricing, tier unlocking
   - `src/calculations/shippingCapacity.ts` — vehicle/train capacity
   - `src/calculations/layRate.ts` — egg laying rate
   - `src/lib/truthEggs.ts` — TE thresholds and utilities
   - `src/lib/events.ts` — `getNextPacificTime()` for event calendar
   - `src/lib/artifacts/virtue.ts` — `getOptimalELRSet()` for artifact selection
   - `lib/earning_bonus.ts` — `shiftCost()` for SE costs

4. **Do NOT use Pinia stores or Vue composables** — The auto-planner works with pure `EngineState` objects, not reactive store state. All logic must be pure functions that take state in and return state + actions out.

## Key Constraints

- **13 shifts per ascension** (not 12)
- **TE ≥ 100 assumed** — population = hab capacity, earnings = flat rate
- **No fuel tank logic** — pretend it doesn't exist
- **No code duplication** — reuse existing engine with `skipGrowth: true`
- **SE can go negative** — don't block on insufficient SE
- **Minimum 10 TE per ascension** — enforced in the UI input constraints
- **State chaining** — each ascension's end state (endTime, endTE, endSoulEggs, endShiftCount, finalTE per egg) feeds into the next ascension's start state
- **Cascading recalculation** — changing ascension N re-simulates N through the end of the chain

## Known Bugs & Gotchas

### `advanceTime` must manually credit `bankValue` (Fixed 2026-05-14)

**The Bug:** Every shift file has an `advanceTime(seconds)` helper that creates a `wait_for_time` action and applies it via `applyAction()`. However, `applyAction` treats `wait_for_time` as a **no-op** — it returns the engine state completely unchanged (see `src/engine/apply/actions.ts`, lines 219-226). This means `bankValue` is never increased when the simulation "waits."

Meanwhile, `buyVehicle` / `buyResearch` / etc. estimate how long to wait using:

```ts
const timeToSave = (price - bankValue) / offlineEarnings;
advanceTime(timeToSave);
// then deduct price from bankValue
```

Since `advanceTime` didn't credit the bank, `bankValue` went increasingly negative after each purchase. After a few buys, the bank was so deeply negative that even a Trike (cheapest vehicle) appeared unaffordable within the remaining time.

**How it was found:** Console logs showed K1 buying one Hyperloop Train + 4 train cars, then being unable to afford *any* vehicle for the remaining 10 slots — despite having 480 seconds left and a positive earnings rate. The mismatch between "earning money" and "bank never growing" was the tell.

**The Fix:** In every shift file's `advanceTime`, compute the current `offlineEarnings` from a snapshot *before* the wait, then manually credit `bankValue` after `applyAction` returns:

```ts
const advanceTime = (seconds: number) => {
  if (seconds <= 0) return;
  const snap = computeSnapshot(currentState, context, { skipGrowth: true });
