# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is a Claude Code skills framework and workflow harness. The main editable sources are:

- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — invocable skill instructions and related prompts/scripts.
- `agents/` — sub-agent role definitions.
- `hooks/` — Bash hooks that enforce workflow and commit checks; `hooks/lib/` contains shared helpers.
- `rules/` and `templates/` — governance rules and generated-artifact templates.
- `scripts/` — deployment, installation, linting, and validation utilities.
- `runtime/` — Python run-state engine (FSM, storage primitives, CLI); synced into `.claude/runtime/` by the deploy script.
- `adapters/` — generated Codex advisory-alpha adapter inputs and runtime-entry bindings; not a Claude runtime path.
- `techstacks/` — project-owned stack profile read by `rules/architecture.md` and `rules/guidelines.md`; intentionally near-empty in this meta-repo.
- `tests/hooks/` and `tests/scripts/` — shell contract and integration tests.
- `scripts/test_*.py`, `runtime/test_*.py`, and selected tests under `skills/` — Python unit tests.
- `docs/`, `specs/`, and `evals/` — knowledge, change artifacts, and evaluation fixtures.

The root `CLAUDE.md`, `HARNESS.md`, `skills/README.md`, and `harness-manifest.json` describe the supported workflow and component inventory. Treat them as contracts when changing hooks, skills, or schemas.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `bash scripts/run-tests.sh` — run the CI-equivalent suite: Bash syntax checks, documentation/manifest linting, shell tests, and Python tests when `pytest` is available.
- `bash scripts/deploy-harness.sh` — rebuild the local derived `.claude/` installation after editing source skills, agents, hooks, rules, templates, runtime, or settings.
- `bash scripts/lint-doc-truth.sh` — verify documented paths and hook registrations independently.
- `python3 -m pytest scripts/test_*.py runtime/test_*.py skills/visual-planner/test_render_plan.py skills/subagent-driven-development/scripts/test_task_brief.py -q` — run the Python unit tests directly. `scripts/run-tests.sh` enumerates the authoritative list in `PYTESTS`.

Before changing `hooks/` or `scripts/`, run the full test command. Keep generated `PLAN.html` artifacts local; they are rebuildable and should not be committed.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use two-space indentation in Bash and four spaces in Python. Keep shell scripts POSIX-conscious where practical, quote variables, use `set -u`/explicit error handling, and prefer clear exit statuses. Python follows standard `ruff` formatting/linting. Name skills and directories in lowercase kebab-case; use `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, and descriptive lowercase script names consistently. Preserve Markdown heading structure and fenced command examples.

## Testing Guidelines

Add or update a focused test in `tests/hooks/`, `tests/scripts/`, or the relevant Python test module when behavior changes. Shell tests should exercise the script’s stdin/environment contract in an isolated temporary Git repository. Run `bash scripts/run-tests.sh` before submitting changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use concise Conventional Commit-style subjects, for example `fix(hooks): ...`, `docs(specs): ...`, or `feat(skills): ...`. Keep commits focused. Pull requests should explain the user-visible or workflow impact, identify tests run, link the related issue/spec when applicable, and include screenshots or rendered artifacts only when documentation or visual output changed. Never merge a pull request from the contributor branch without human review.
