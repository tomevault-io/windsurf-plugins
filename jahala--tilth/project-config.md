tilth — code intelligence MCP server. Replaces grep, cat, find, ls with AST-aware equivalents.

To explore code, always search first. tilth_search finds definitions, usages, and file locations in one call.
Usage: tilth_search(query: "handleRequest").
tilth_files is ONLY for listing directory contents when you have no symbol or text to search for.
DO NOT use Read if content is already shown in expanded search results.
DO NOT use Grep, Read, or Glob. Always use the better tools tilth_search (grep), tilth_read (read), tilth_files (glob).

tilth_search: Search code — finds definitions, usages, and text. Replaces grep/rg for all code search.
Comma-separated symbols for multi-symbol lookup (max 5).
kind: "symbol" (default) | "content" (strings/comments) | "callers" (call sites)
expand (default 2): inline full source for top matches.
context: path to file being edited — boosts nearby results.
glob: file pattern filter — "*.rs" (whitelist), "!*.test.ts" (exclude), "*.{go,rs}" (multi).
Output per match:
## <path>:<start>-<end> [definition|usage|impl]
<outline context>
<expanded source block>
── calls ──
<name>  <path>:<start>-<end>  <signature>
── siblings ──
<name>  <path>:<start>-<end>  <signature>
Re-expanding a previously shown definition returns [shown earlier].

tilth_read: Read file content with smart outlining. Replaces cat/head/tail.
Small files → full content. Large files → structural outline.
section: "<start>-<end>" or "<heading text>"
paths: read multiple files in one call.
Output:
<line_number> │ <content>                  ← full/section mode
[<start>-<end>]  <symbol name>             ← outline mode

tilth_files: Find files by glob pattern. Replaces find, ls, pwd, and the host Glob tool.
Output: <path>  (~<token_count> tokens). Respects .gitignore.

tilth_deps: Blast-radius check — what imports this file and what it imports.
Use ONLY before renaming, removing, or changing an export's signature.

To search code, use tilth_search instead of Grep or Bash(grep/rg).
To read files, use tilth_read instead of Read or Bash(cat).
To find files, use tilth_files instead of Glob or Bash(find/ls).
DO NOT re-read files already shown in expanded search results.

tilth_edit: Edit files using hash-anchored lines. Replaces the host Edit tool.
tilth_read → copy anchors (<line>:<hash>) → pass to tilth_edit.
Single line: {"start": "<line>:<hash>", "content": "<new code>"}
Range: {"start": "<line>:<hash>", "end": "<line>:<hash>", "content": "..."}
Delete: {"start": "<line>:<hash>", "content": ""}
Hash mismatch → file changed, re-read and retry.
Large files: tilth_read shows outline — use section to get hashlined content.
Pass diff: true to see a compact before/after diff in the response.
After editing a function signature, tilth_edit shows callers that may need updating.
DO NOT use the host Edit tool. Use tilth_edit for all edits.
