# Agents

`AGENTS.md` is the repo-level contract for agents working in this repository.

Pi subagent behavior does **not** live here. The source of truth for bundled Pi subagents is `.feynman/agents/*.md`, which the runtime syncs into the Pi agent directory. If you need to change how `researcher`, `reviewer`, `writer`, or `verifier` behave, edit the corresponding file in `.feynman/agents/` instead of duplicating those prompts here.

## Pi subagents

Feynman ships four bundled research subagents:

- `researcher`
- `reviewer`
- `writer`
- `verifier`

They are defined in `.feynman/agents/` and invoked via the Pi `subagent` tool.

## What belongs here

Keep this file focused on cross-agent repo conventions:

- output locations and file naming expectations
- workspace-level continuity expectations for long-running work
- provenance and verification requirements
- handoff rules between the lead agent and subagents

Do **not** restate per-agent prompt text here unless there is a repo-wide constraint that applies to all agents.

## Feature scope

Feynman must stay simple yet potent. It is an AI researcher, not a bundle of adjacent productivity workflows.

Every new feature must fight for its life before implementation. Keep or add a feature only when it directly improves at least one core research job:

- discovering relevant papers, code, datasets, or prior art
- reading, extracting, and understanding paper content
- ranking evidence, methods, reproducibility, or citation structure
- verifying claims against sources, code, data, or experiments
- planning or running reproductions and research experiments
- synthesizing research into auditable artifacts
- visualizing research structure when the visualization changes a research decision
- improving speed, observability, provenance, or reliability of the research loop

Reject adjacent product lanes by default. Funding, proposal, sales, admin, generic writing, and project-management workflows do not belong in Feynman unless the user explicitly scopes them as support for a specific active research run.

Before adding a command, prompt, tool, extension, dashboard, document page, or release-note item, state the core research job it serves and the smallest existing surface that can absorb it. If the value is not concrete and testable, do not add it.

## Pi runtime changes

- Feynman wraps Pi. Before changing telemetry, tools, extensions, runtime package setup, model/prompt handoff, or child-process env, read the installed Pi package version, `node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/docs/`, and the matching runtime source.
- Before writing a local Pi extension or tool shim, search Pi package docs plus npm/GitHub for an existing Pi extension or plugin; use the existing package, patch it, or record why it fails before adding a Feynman-owned implementation.
- Treat parent CLI wiring as incomplete until the actual Pi launch path is verified: check `src/pi/launch.ts`, `scripts/prepare-runtime-workspace.mjs`, package `pi.extensions`, and every extension file the launch command passes.
- For observability changes, verify session/agent/tool lifecycle coverage inside Pi itself and keep prompts, tool arguments, paper text, and file paths out of emitted telemetry.

## Workbench control plane

- The workbench is a Pi-backed research control plane. For chat, session, project, or reference-product parity work, read Pi's docs/runtime and the reference app's live behavior before coding, then wire the UI to real Pi/Feynman sessions, messages, streaming or resume state, files, artifacts, execution/provenance, compute, skills/MCP, memory, and verification state before calling the surface functionally complete.
- For user-visible workbench parity slices, completion includes public-facing docs parity: update `README.md`, `RELEASES.md`, `metadata/commands.mjs`, and the `website/` docs/pages when they describe the changed command, setup flow, workbench capability, connector, or runtime state. `CHANGELOG.md` and plan files are internal trackers only.

## Output conventions

- Research outputs go in `outputs/`.
- Paper-style drafts go in `papers/`.
- Session logs go in `notes/`.
- The workspace-level lab notebook lives at `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Plan artifacts for long-running workflows go in `outputs/.plans/`.
- Intermediate research artifacts are written to disk by subagents and read by the lead agent. They are not returned inline unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Long-running workflows should treat the plan artifact as an externalized working memory, not a static outline. Keep task status and verification state there as the run evolves.
- Long-running or resumable workflows should also treat `CHANGELOG.md` as the chronological lab notebook: what changed, what failed, what was verified, and what should happen next.
- Do not create or update `CHANGELOG.md` for trivial one-shot tasks.

## File naming

Every workflow that produces artifacts must derive a short **slug** from the topic (lowercase, hyphens, no filler words, ≤5 words — e.g. `cloud-sandbox-pricing`). All files in a single run use that slug as a prefix:

- Plan: `outputs/.plans/<slug>.md`
- Intermediate research: `<slug>-research-web.md`, `<slug>-research-papers.md`, etc.
