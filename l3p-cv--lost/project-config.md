# Conventions

## Image coordinate system

The same coordinate system as in OpenCv is used. So an image is treated
as a matrix. The x-axis increases to the right and the y-axis increases
while moving downwards in the coordinate system, as in matrix notation.

## Annotations

All annotations are defined relative to the image. See also
`lost.db.model.TwoDAnno`.

### Bounding Box definition

- x: Defines the x-coordinate of the center of a bounding box
    (relative, in pixels).
- y: Defines the y-coordinate of the center of a bounding box
    (relative, in pixels).
- width: Defines the width of a bbox (relative, in pixels).
- height: Defines the height of a bbox (relative, in pixels).
