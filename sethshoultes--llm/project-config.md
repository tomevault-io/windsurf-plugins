# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands
- Run system: `./llm.sh` or `./llm.sh quiet` 
- Test model loading: `python scripts/minimal_inference_quiet.py [model_path]`
- Test interface: `python scripts/quiet_interface.py`
- Activate environment: `source LLM-MODELS/tools/scripts/activate_mac.sh`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r config/requirements.txt`

## Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 with descriptive snake_case names
- Use Path objects for cross-platform path handling
- Class names: CamelCase, functions/variables: snake_case
- Import order: standard library → third-party → local modules
- Error handling: Use try/except with specific exceptions
- Provide descriptive error messages with traceback when appropriate
- Document functions with docstrings and comment complex sections

## Dependencies
- Core: Python 3.9+, llama-cpp-python, torch, transformers, flask
- Document new dependencies in config/requirements.txt

## Core Principles

The implementation must strictly adhere to these non-negotiable principles, as established in previous PRDs:

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Zero code duplication will be tolerated
   - Each functionality must exist in exactly one place
   - No duplicate files or alternative implementations allowed

2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
   - Implement the simplest solution that works
   - No over-engineering or unnecessary complexity
   - Straightforward, maintainable code patterns

3. **Clean File System**
   - All existing files must be either used or removed
   - No orphaned, redundant, or unused files
   - Clear, logical organization of the file structure

4. **Transparent Error Handling**
   - No error hiding or fallback mechanisms that mask issues
   - All errors must be properly displayed to the user
   - Errors must be clear, actionable, and honest

## Success Criteria

In accordance with the established principles and previous PRDs, the implementation will be successful if:

1. **Zero Duplication**: No duplicate code or files exist in the codebase
2. **Single Implementation**: Each feature has exactly one implementation
3. **Complete Template System**: All HTML is generated via the template system
4. **No Fallbacks**: No fallback systems that hide or mask errors
5. **Transparent Errors**: All errors are properly displayed to users
6. **External Assets**: All CSS and JavaScript is in external files
7. **Component Architecture**: UI is built from reusable, modular components
8. **Consistent Standards**: Implementation follows UI_INTEGRATION_STANDARDS.md
9. **Full Functionality**: All features work correctly through template UI
10. **Complete Documentation**: Implementation details are properly documented
