# Working on Rust Workers Minecraft

Read [README.md](README.md), [architecture](docs/architecture.md), and
[dependency pins](docs/dependencies.md) before changing the runtime.

## Project layout

- `src/`: Pumpkin entry points and configuration. The hosted Tokio bridge lives in workers-rs.
- `worker/`: TCP ingress, Durable Object lifecycle, and SQLite filesystem.
- `tests/`: protocol clients, integration tests, and isolated filesystem fixtures.
- `scripts/setup.sh`: provision pinned sources and build the toolchain.
- `scripts/{build,serve,test}.sh`: build, run, and validate the Workers server.

Use Node 24+ (26 recommended) and the pinned Rust nightly. Run `npm test` after
build/runtime changes; it must print `PUMPKIN-DO-SQLITE-RESTART-OK` after verifying
player and chunk restoration. Keep test fixtures out of the production bundle.
Scripts bind to loopback and fail if their ports are occupied. Do not kill another
process to free a port.

## Reproducibility and data

Changes to patched checkouts (Pumpkin, wasm-bindgen, workers-rs, wasm-streams) must
be reflected in `patches/`. Keep unpatched checkouts unmodified; update pins for
upstream changes. Preserve the unified ticker and cooperative scheduler unless
the task requires a runtime change. Do not reintroduce old Tokio/libc networking
patches.

Worlds under `.data/` are user data; do not remove or copy them into commits.
Playable databases live in `.data/workers/server/`; tests use `.data/probes/`.

## Public repository and Git safety

Never commit `.work/`, `target/`, `.data/`, generated JS/wasm, credentials, private
CA material, account IDs, or non-public infrastructure names/URLs. Retain upstream
license notices and the GPL license for this Pumpkin-linked project.

Never commit, push, rebase, reset --hard, or force-push without explicit approval.
Show the proposed diff/commands and wait for confirmation. Prefer additive changes.
