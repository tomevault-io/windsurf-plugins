# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (use make bootstrap for first-time setup)
make bootstrap

# Build all packages (ALWAYS run from repo root, not from individual packages)
yarn build           # or: make build

# Watch mode for development
yarn watch           # or: make watch

# Run tests
yarn test            # Unit tests (Jest) for all packages
yarn test-playwright # Playwright E2E tests

# Run tests for a specific package
cd packages/framer-motion && yarn test-client  # Client-side Jest tests
cd packages/framer-motion && yarn test-server  # SSR Jest tests

# Lint
yarn lint            # or: make lint

# Run E2E tests
make test-e2e        # Runs all E2E tests (Next.js, HTML, React, React 19, Playwright)
make test-single     # Run a single Cypress test (edit spec path in Makefile)
```

## Package Architecture

This is a Yarn workspaces monorepo managed by Turborepo and Lerna.

### Core Packages (packages/)

- **motion** - Main public package (`npm install motion`). Re-exports from framer-motion with cleaner entry points (`motion/react`, `motion/mini`)
- **framer-motion** - Core implementation for React. Contains all animation logic, components, hooks, and features
- **motion-dom** - DOM-specific animation utilities (animate, scroll, gestures, effects). Framework-agnostic
- **motion-utils** - Shared utilities (easing, math helpers, error handling). No dependencies

### Development Apps (dev/)

- **dev/react** - React 18 development/test app (port 9990)
- **dev/react-19** - React 19 development/test app (port 9991)
- **dev/next** - Next.js development/test app (port 3000)
- **dev/html** - Vanilla JS/HTML test pages (port 8000)

### Package Dependency Flow

```
motion-utils (base utilities)
    ↓
motion-dom (DOM animation engine)
    ↓
framer-motion (React integration)
    ↓
motion (public API)
```

## Key Source Directories (packages/framer-motion/src/)

- **animation/** - Animation system (animators, sequences, optimized-appear)
- **components/** - React components (AnimatePresence, LayoutGroup, LazyMotion, Reorder)
- **context/** - React contexts (MotionContext, PresenceContext, LayoutGroupContext)
- **gestures/** - Gesture handling (drag, pan, tap, hover, focus)
- **motion/** - Core motion component and feature system
- **projection/** - Layout animation projection system (FLIP animations)
- **render/** - Rendering pipeline (HTML, SVG, DOM utilities)
- **value/** - Motion values and hooks (useMotionValue, useSpring, useScroll, useTransform)

## Writing Tests

**IMPORTANT: Always write tests for every bug fix AND every new feature.** Write a failing test FIRST before implementing, to ensure the issue is reproducible and the fix is verified.

**"Failing test" means a test that reproduces the reported bug.** The test should assert the expected behavior and fail because of the bug — not because your planned code doesn't exist yet. A TypeScript compile error for an API you're about to add is not a failing test. Write the test against the existing codebase, see it fail for the right reason, then implement the fix.

### Test types by feature

- **Unit tests (Jest)**: For pure logic, value transformations, utilities. Located in `__tests__/` directories alongside source. **JSDOM does not support WAAPI** (`Element.animate()`), so Jest tests only cover the JS animation fallback path.
- **E2E tests (Cypress)**: For UI behavior that involves DOM rendering, scroll interactions, gesture handling, or WAAPI animations. Test specs in `packages/framer-motion/cypress/integration/`, test pages in `dev/react/src/tests/`.
- **E2E tests (Playwright)**: For cross-browser testing and HTML/vanilla JS tests. Specs in `tests/`, test pages in `dev/html/public/playwright/`.

### When to escalate from unit tests to Cypress

**If a bug is reported with a reproduction but your unit test passes, do NOT conclude "already works."** JSDOM lacks WAAPI, real layout, and real browser rendering. The bug is likely in the browser code path. You MUST:

1. Create a Cypress E2E test that matches the reporter's reproduction as closely as possible.
2. Verify the Cypress test fails before implementing a fix.
3. If the bug involves `opacity`, `transform`, React.lazy/Suspense, scroll, layout animations, or any visual behavior — **start with Cypress**, skip the unit test entirely.

### Creating Cypress E2E tests

1. **Create a test page** in `dev/react/src/tests/<test-name>.tsx` exporting a named `App` component. It's automatically available at `?test=<test-name>`.
2. **Create a spec** in `packages/framer-motion/cypress/integration/<test-name>.ts`.
3. **Verify WAAPI acceleration** using `element.getAnimations()` in Cypress callbacks — but **only for compositor properties** (opacity, transform). `getAnimations()` won't return WAAPI animations for non-compositor properties like height/width in Electron. Don't use it for those.
