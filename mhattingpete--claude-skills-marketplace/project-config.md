## 🏗️ Plugin Structure Standards

### Required Directory Structure

```
{plugin-name}-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json              # REQUIRED: Plugin metadata ONLY (no skills array)
├── skills/                      # Skills directory (auto-discovered)
│   └── {skill-name}/
│       ├── SKILL.md             # REQUIRED: Skill specification
│       ├── references/          # OPTIONAL: Reference materials (markdown)
│       │   └── *.md             # Additional context/guides
│       └── scripts/             # OPTIONAL: Helper scripts
│           └── *.py             # Python scripts, shell scripts, etc.
├── agents/                      # OPTIONAL: Agents directory (auto-discovered)
│   └── {agent-name}/
│       └── AGENT.md             # Agent specification
├── commands/                    # OPTIONAL: Commands directory (auto-discovered)
│   └── {command-name}.md
├── README.md                    # REQUIRED: Plugin documentation
├── CHANGELOG.md                 # RECOMMENDED: Version history
└── EXAMPLES.md                  # RECOMMENDED: Usage examples
```

**CRITICAL: Skills are auto-discovered!**
- Skills MUST be in `skills/` subdirectory at plugin root
- Skills are automatically discovered - NO listing in plugin.json
- plugin.json contains ONLY metadata (name, version, description, author)
- Same applies to agents/ and commands/ - all auto-discovered

**Directory purposes:**
- `skills/` - All skills (auto-discovered from SKILL.md files)
- `agents/` - All agents (auto-discovered from AGENT.md files)
- `commands/` - All commands (auto-discovered from .md files)
- `references/` - Markdown documentation, guides, best practices
- `scripts/` - Executable scripts (Python, shell, etc.) that skills can use

### Critical Files

#### 1. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

**Location matters!** Must be in `.claude-plugin/` subdirectory, not at root.

```json
{
  "name": "example-skills",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Clear, concise description of what the plugin provides",
  "author": {
    "name": "author-name"
  }
}
```

**Key points:**
- **ONLY metadata** - name, version, description, author
- **NO skills array** - skills are auto-discovered from skills/ directory
- **NO agents array** - agents are auto-discovered from agents/ directory
- **NO commands array** - commands are auto-discovered from commands/ directory
- Keep it simple - just plugin metadata!

#### 2. `SKILL.md`

Every skill MUST have a SKILL.md file. This is the instruction set for Claude.

**Required sections:**

```markdown
# {Skill Name}

## Purpose
Clear statement of what this skill does and why it exists.

## When to Use
List of scenarios where this skill is appropriate.

**Activation phrases:**
- "phrase that triggers this skill"
- "another trigger phrase"
- "third example"

## What It Does
Detailed explanation of the skill's workflow:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. etc.

## Approach
How the skill should approach the task, including:
- Analysis strategy
- Tool usage patterns
- Decision-making criteria
- Error handling

## Example Interaction
```
User: "example request"

Skill:
1. Does X
2. Asks Y
3. Implements Z
```

## Tools Used
- **ToolName**: Why and when to use it
- **AnotherTool**: Purpose

## Success Criteria
How to know when the skill has succeeded:
- Criterion 1
- Criterion 2

## Integration
How this skill works with other skills (if applicable).
```

**Best practices for SKILL.md:**
- Be specific about activation phrases
- Include concrete examples
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Mention tool usage patterns
- Define success criteria clearly
- Use realistic example interactions

#### 3. `README.md`

Plugin README should be user-facing documentation:

```markdown
# {Plugin Name}

Brief description of what the plugin provides.

## Skills Included

### 1. Skill Name

## 🎨 Skill Design Principles

### 1. Automatic Activation

Skills should activate based on **natural language intent**, not explicit invocation.

**Good activation triggers:**
```
"audit the code"              → code-auditor
"set up this project"         → project-bootstrapper
"fix the tests"               → test-fixing
```

**Bad (requiring explicit invocation):**
```
"/audit"                      → Too manual
"run code-auditor"            → Not natural
```

### 2. Clear Scope

Each skill should have a **single, well-defined purpose**.

**Good (focused):**
- `test-fixing`: Fix failing tests
- `git-pushing`: Handle git operations
- `code-auditor`: Audit code quality

**Bad (too broad):**
- `do-everything`: Multiple unrelated functions
- `developer-helper`: Vague purpose

### 3. Tool-Rich Implementation

Skills should leverage **all available tools** effectively:

- **Read**: File analysis
- **Write/Edit**: Code changes
- **Grep/Glob**: Pattern matching and file discovery
- **Bash**: Execute commands, run tests
- **Task (agents)**: Delegate complex sub-tasks
- **AskUserQuestion**: Gather requirements

**Example from code-auditor:**
```
1. Use Explore agent for thorough codebase mapping
2. Use Grep for pattern detection (security issues, TODOs)
3. Use Read for detailed file analysis
4. Use Bash to run linters/analyzers if available
5. Synthesize findings into report
```

### 4. User Interaction

When to ask vs. when to proceed:

**ASK when:**
- Multiple valid approaches exist (technology choices, architectural decisions)
- Requirements are ambiguous
- User preference matters (depth of analysis, output format)
- Potentially destructive operations

**PROCEED when:**
- Best practice is clear
- Request has sufficient context
- Operation is safe and reversible
- Asking would slow down unnecessarily

**Use AskUserQuestion for structured choices:**
```
Questions:
- "Which testing framework?"
  Options: pytest, unittest, nose2
- "Deployment target?"
  Options: Docker, AWS Lambda, Traditional server
```

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation

Skills should be **self-documenting**:

- Explain what they're doing as they work
- Provide file:line references for all findings
- Summarize results clearly
- Suggest next steps

**Good example:**
```
"I've analyzed the codebase and found 3 security issues:

1. SQL injection risk in database/query.py:45
   - Uses string concatenation for queries
   - Recommendation: Use parameterized queries

2. Hardcoded credentials in config/settings.py:12
   - API key visible in code
   - Recommendation: Use environment variables

3. Missing input validation in api/users.py:78
   - User input directly used in file paths
   - Recommendation: Add path sanitization

Priority: Fix item 1 (critical) immediately."
```

## 🔨 Creating a New Skill

### Step 1: Plan

Before coding, define:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this solve?
2. **Activation**: What phrases trigger it?
3. **Scope**: What's included/excluded?
4. **Tools**: Which tools will it use?
5. **Integration**: How does it work with existing skills?

### Step 2: Create Structure

```bash
# In existing plugin or create new
mkdir -p {plugin-name}-plugin/.claude-plugin
mkdir -p {plugin-name}-plugin/{skill-name}

# Create files
touch {plugin-name}-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
touch {plugin-name}-plugin/{skill-name}/SKILL.md
touch {plugin-name}-plugin/README.md
```

### Step 3: Write SKILL.md

Start with the template above. Be specific about:
- **When to activate** (trigger phrases)
- **What to do** (step-by-step workflow)
- **How to do it** (tool usage patterns)
- **Success criteria** (when is it done?)

### Step 4: Update plugin.json

Add your skill to the skills array:

```json
{
  "name": "skill-name",
  "source": "./skill-directory",
  "description": "Activates when users [trigger phrase]. Does [what it does].",
  "gitignored": false,
  "project": false
}
```

### Step 5: Document

Create/update README.md with:
- Skill purpose and benefits
- Activation examples
- Usage tips
- Integration notes

### Step 6: Test

Test the skill with various inputs:
- ✅ Natural activation phrases
- ✅ Edge cases
- ✅ Error conditions
- ✅ Integration with other skills

### Step 7: Add to Marketplace

Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "your-plugin-name",
      "source": "./your-plugin-directory",
      "description": "Clear description",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "author": {
        "name": "your-name"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📚 Reference Materials

Skills can include reference materials in `references/` directory:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    ├── best-practices.md      # Industry best practices
    ├── examples.md            # Code examples
    ├── patterns.md            # Design patterns
    └── troubleshooting.md     # Common issues
```

Claude can read these during skill execution for additional context.

**When to use references:**
- Detailed technical specifications
- Code examples and templates
- Best practices guides
- Troubleshooting information
- Pattern libraries

**Examples from existing skills:**
- `visual-html-creator/references/design_patterns.md` - Design patterns for visual docs
- `visual-html-creator/references/svg_library.md` - SVG component library
- `feature-planning/references/planning-best-practices.md` - Planning guide

---

## 🤖 Creating Agents

Agents are specialized sub-agents with specific purposes.

### Agent Structure

```
agents/
└── {agent-name}/
    └── AGENT.md
```

### AGENT.md Template

```markdown
# {Agent Name}

## Purpose
What this agent specializes in.

## When to Use
Scenarios where this agent should be invoked.

## Capabilities
What this agent can do:
- Capability 1
- Capability 2

## Approach
How the agent should work:
1. Step 1
2. Step 2

## Tools
Tools this agent has access to.

## Constraints
What this agent should NOT do.

## Output
What this agent should return.
```

### Agent Best Practices

1. **Focused purpose**: Agents should have narrow, well-defined scope
2. **Clear constraints**: Explicitly state what agent should NOT do
3. **Efficient model**: Use Haiku for cost-effective execution when possible
4. **Clear output**: Define what agent should return to parent skill

**Example from plan-implementer:**
- **Purpose**: Implement code from detailed plans
- **Model**: claude-3-5-haiku (cost-effective)
- **Constraints**: No feature creep, stick to plan
- **Output**: Working implementation with tests

---

## 🎯 Quality Standards

### Required Elements

Every skill must have:
- ✅ Clear purpose statement
- ✅ Specific activation phrases
- ✅ Step-by-step approach
- ✅ Tool usage specification
- ✅ Success criteria
- ✅ Example interactions
- ✅ User-facing documentation

### Best Practices

1. **Descriptive names**: `code-auditor` not `checker`
2. **Natural activation**: Match how users naturally phrase requests
3. **Tool-rich**: Use multiple tools effectively
4. **Well-documented**: Both in SKILL.md and README
5. **Integration-aware**: Know how to work with other skills
6. **Error-resilient**: Handle edge cases gracefully
7. **User-friendly**: Explain what's happening, provide clear output

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Too broad**: Skill tries to do too many unrelated things
❌ **Manual activation**: Requires slash command or explicit invocation
❌ **Tool-poor**: Only uses basic tools, doesn't leverage full toolkit
❌ **Undocumented**: Unclear when/how to use
❌ **Silent**: Doesn't explain what it's doing
❌ **Isolated**: Doesn't integrate with other skills
❌ **Vague**: Unclear success criteria or output

---

## 📦 Version Management

### Semantic Versioning

Use semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to skill interface
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, no new features

### CHANGELOG.md

Maintain a changelog:

```markdown

## 🚀 When Working on This Repository

### Your Role

You are helping develop **high-quality, reusable skills** for the Claude Code community.

**Priorities:**
1. **Skills first**: ALWAYS use available skills before manual implementation
2. **Quality over speed**: Take time to design well
3. **User experience**: Natural activation, clear output
4. **Documentation**: Both technical (SKILL.md) and user-facing (README)
5. **Integration**: Consider how skills work together
6. **Standards**: Follow established patterns and structure

### Critical Working Guidelines

**1. ALWAYS use skills when available**

For ANY task in this repository:
- Check if a skill can handle it FIRST
- Use git-pushing for all git operations
- Use feature-planning for complex features
- Use test-fixing for test failures
- **Use skill-creator for creating new skills** - ensures proper structure
- Never implement manually when a skill exists

**CRITICAL: When creating new skills:**
- ALWAYS use the skill-creator skill from example-skills
- Never manually create skill structure
- skill-creator ensures all required files and structure are correct
- Manual creation often leads to missing files (skill.json, proper directories, etc.)

**2. NEVER create markdown files unless explicitly requested by the user.**

This includes:
- ❌ Don't create README.md, CHANGELOG.md, or other docs proactively
- ❌ Don't create example files or guides without being asked
- ❌ Don't create markdown documentation as a "helpful addition"
- ✅ Only create .md files when the user specifically requests them
- ✅ Focus on code and functionality first, documentation when asked

**Exception:** When creating a new skill/plugin per user request, the required files (SKILL.md, plugin.json, README.md) are part of the deliverable and should be created.

### Making Changes

**When adding features:**
1. Understand the existing pattern
2. Design before implementing
3. Follow structure conventions
4. Document thoroughly
5. Update version and changelog
6. Test comprehensively

**When improving existing skills:**
1. Read SKILL.md fully to understand intent
2. Maintain backward compatibility if possible
3. Update documentation
4. Test that existing use cases still work
5. Version bump appropriately

### Code Quality

**For SKILL.md files:**
- Clear, concise language
- Specific instructions, not vague guidelines
- Concrete examples
- Realistic scenarios

**For reference materials:**
- Well-organized
- Comprehensive but focused
- Practical examples
- Up-to-date best practices

---

## 📋 Quick Reference

### File Locations (Critical!)

```
✅ CORRECT:
plugin-name-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
plugin-name-plugin/skill-name/SKILL.md

❌ WRONG:
plugin-name-plugin/plugin.json              # Wrong location
plugin-name-plugin/skill-name/README.md     # Wrong filename (use SKILL.md)
```

### Skill Naming

- Use kebab-case: `code-auditor`, `feature-planning`
- Be descriptive: `test-fixing` not `fixer`
- Match purpose: Name should indicate what it does

### Description Writing

**In plugin.json:**
Focus on when it activates and what it does:
```
"description": "Activates when users want to [trigger]. Provides [benefit]."
```

**In SKILL.md:**
Focus on how it works and detailed approach.

**In README.md:**
Focus on user benefits and practical examples.
