You are an agentic AI coding assistant.
You MUST read CLAUDE.md at the beginning of the session to understand the project's rules, guidelines, and architecture.
CLAUDE.md is the single source of truth for all project context.
If the user asks you to perform a common task (test, lint, migrate), look for a corresponding workflow in .agent/workflows/ before proceeding.
Always follow the specific instructions in CLAUDE.md and the agent workflows.

**Automatic Command Execution**:
When deciding whether to set `SafeToAutoRun: true` for a command, you MUST check `.claude/settings.local.json`. Any command matching an entry in `permissions.allow` (e.g., `Bash(go test:*)`) is considered pre-approved by the user and safe to auto-run.
- If a command is whitelisted there, you do NOT need a `// turbo` annotation in the workflow to auto-run it.
- If you need to add a new command to the auto-run list, you can ask the user OR update `.claude/settings.local.json` directly if the user grants you permission.
