# tempo-x402 — Project Context

## What This Is

Autonomous AI colony on the Tempo blockchain. Self-replicating agents that clone, evolve source code, benchmark IQ, share neural weights, and pay each other via HTTP 402. Agents write Rust programs, compile to WASM cartridges, and deploy instantly.

Rust workspace. 9 crates, ~116K lines. Neuroplastic fluid cognitive architecture: Bloch sphere state geometry, unified encoder-decoder (16M params), hot-swappable WASM cognitive modules, 188 compile-verified training cartridges. Published on crates.io.

## Architecture

```
Client ──► Gateway (4023) ──► Facilitator (embedded) ──► Tempo Chain (42431)
               │
               ├── Identity (wallet bootstrap + faucet + ERC-8004)
               ├── Soul (9-system cognitive architecture, Gemini-powered)
               ├── Cartridge Engine (wasmtime WASM sandbox runtime)
               └── Clone Orchestrator (Railway self-replication + stem cell differentiation)
```

Two-layer design: **Application layer** (routes, frontend, cartridges) diverges per agent. **Cognitive layer** (brain, cortex, genesis, hivemind, synthesis, autonomy, evaluation, feedback, free energy) always syncs across the colony.

**Stem cell model**: Each clone gets its own GitHub repo. Code diverges independently. Good changes flow upstream via PRs.

Dependency DAG: `x402 → gateway → node`, `x402 → identity → node`, `x402 → soul → node`, `x402 → model → soul`, `cartridge → soul, node`.

Each crate has its own `CLAUDE.md` with local context. **Read that first when working in a crate.**

## Live Colony

| Agent | Domain | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| **borg-0** | `borg-0-production.up.railway.app` | Queen (canonical, pushes to colony fork) |
| **borg-0-2** | `borg-0-2-production.up.railway.app` | Clone (own repo, independent evolution) |

Colony repos:
- `compusophy/tempo-x402` — canonical (user + Claude Code only)
- `compusophy-bot/tempo-x402` — colony baseline (queen pushes here)
- `compusophy-bot/{designation}` — clone's own repo (stem cell model)

## WASM Cartridges

Agents write Rust → compile to WASM → deploy instantly at `/c/{slug}` with payment gate.

- **Create**: `create_cartridge(slug, source_code)` — scaffolds Rust project
- **Create Cognitive**: `create_cognitive_cartridge(system)` — scaffolds brain/cortex/etc. hot-swap module
- **Compile**: `compile_cartridge(slug)` — `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`, hot-reloads via `replace_module()`
- **Test**: `test_cartridge(slug, method, path, body)` — runs in wasmtime sandbox
- **Serve**: `GET/POST /c/{slug}` — x402 payment gated, KV persisted after execution
- **Studio**: `/cartridges` page with browser + test console
- **Safety**: 64MB memory, fuel CPU limit, 30s timeout, no filesystem access
- **Composition**: `x402_call(slug, request)` — cartridges can invoke other cartridges (max depth 3, isolated KV)
- **Visual testing**: Soul can open cartridge in browser, screenshot, analyze via Gemini Vision, iterate
- **Local generation**: `generate_cartridge_code(slug, description)` — local 15M param codegen model writes cartridge source, cargo checks, falls back to Gemini
- **Four types**: Backend (HTTP), Interactive (60fps framebuffer), Frontend (Leptos SPA), Cognitive (hot-swappable brain modules)

## Agent Discipline

- **Benchmark-driven commit gate**: Agent can't commit again until benchmark measures IQ delta of last commit. Tool-level gate with 30-minute safety valve (plan validation is soft warning only).
- **Cumulative destruction guard**: Tracks total file changes over 24h against deploy baseline. Blocks >70% cumulative deletion (prevents incremental lobotomy).
