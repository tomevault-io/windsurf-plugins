# CLAUDE.md — vllm-rocm

## What this repo is

`vllm-rocm` is a **pure repackager + qualifier** of ROCm-based vLLM wheels. It
does two things and nothing else:

1. **Repackage** an upstream wheel set into a self-contained, relocatable
   archive (bundled CPython + the wheels + ROCm user-space libs) so it can be
   dropped in as a Lemonade backend with no system Python/ROCm.
2. **Qualify** that archive on real hardware and report the result.

It is **not** a place to fix, patch, or work around upstream bugs.

## Channels

Builds are produced on two channels (mirroring `llamacpp-rocm` /
lemonade's `rocm_channel`). The **qualification suite is identical** for both,
and a build is **published only on a green qualification**. On green the
channels are marked differently so Lemonade's auto-bump can tell them apart:
**stable** becomes the repo's `--latest` full release, while **nightly** (and
omni) are published as GitHub **prereleases**. Lemonade reads `/releases/latest`
for the stable pin and the newest non-omni prerelease for the nightly pin, so a
nightly or omni tag can never surface as `latest` or leak into the stable pin.

| Channel | What it is | Source | Expectation |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **stable** | Pure repackage of AMD's matched, self-consistent set | AMD's published per-gfx vLLM (`rocm.frameworks.amd.com/whl/<gfx>`) + PyTorch (`repo.amd.com/rocm/whl/<gfx>`) | Should pass; lags upstream vLLM |
| **nightly** | AMD's official nightly, date-stamp-matched by us | AMD's universal-RDNA nightly vLLM (`rocm.frameworks-nightlies.amd.com/whl/device-all-rdna`) + the AMD ROCm PyTorch carrying the same `rocm7.X.0a<DATE>` build stamp (`rocm.nightlies.amd.com/whl-multi-arch`) | Bleeding edge; **may legitimately be red** when the newest vLLM + ROCm aren't yet usable on the target GPU |

A red nightly is a correct outcome, not a bug to fix: it reports that the
newest AMD vLLM + ROCm aren't yet usable together on the target hardware. It is
not published until it goes green on its own; a green nightly is published as a
prerelease (never `latest`).

## Inviolable principles

1. **Do not modify upstream wheel contents.** Repackage AMD's published
   artifacts as-is into a portable layout. No patching binaries, no editing
   sources, no substituting component versions to "make a broken combination
   work."

2. **Do not attempt to fix a broken upstream release.** If AMD publishes a
   wheel that fails to load or run, the qualification suite **reports it as
   broken** and the build is not published. We never carry a workaround.
   A red qualification is a correct, useful outcome — it tells AMD (and us)
   the release is not usable, with evidence.

3. **Repackaging must be faithful.** The portable archive must contain
   everything the wheel needs at runtime. Size-trimming must never delete a
   file required to load or execute (for example, the versioned `clang-NN`
   that Triton's runtime JIT execs). When in doubt, keep it. Removing a file
   the wheel shipped is *corrupting* the wheel, which is different from — and
   not permitted by — "don't fix upstream."

4. **Single source per channel; never reconcile to make it pass.** Each
   channel repackages one defined source (stable = AMD's matched set; nightly =
   vLLM project wheels + latest ROCm torch). Do not pin or swap a component
   version to force an incompatible combination to load — that is the
   forbidden "fix." If the channel's components don't work together,
   qualification reports it red. (Nightly composing "latest + latest" is the
   channel's *definition*, not a reconciliation; if they mismatch, that is the
   true, reported result.)

5. **Qualification gates publication; the channel decides the flag.** A build is
   published only when its target's qualification tiers pass (a red build fails
   the job and is not released). On green, the release flag is set by channel,
   not by re-running qualification: **stable** → `--latest` (the repo's single
   "latest" release), **nightly** and **omni** → `--prerelease`. This is what
   keeps the channels distinguishable to consumers: Lemonade auto-discovers the
   stable pin via `/releases/latest` and the nightly pin via the newest non-omni
   prerelease, so nightly/omni can never masquerade as the stable pin.

6. **Automation.** **nightly** runs automatically on a daily schedule: a
   `detect-nightly` job polls AMD's `device-all-rdna` index and dedups against
   the published feed, so the pipeline only does real work when a genuinely new
   nightly wheel appears. **stable** runs on demand (`workflow_dispatch` with
   `channel=stable`, vLLM version via the `stable_vllm_ver` input); auto-trigger
   on a new AMD stable wheel is future work. (Scheduled runs only fire from the
   default branch — this must be on `main` to run nightly.)

## Source of truth (per channel)

- **stable** repackages AMD's own per-gfx matched set: AMD vLLM
  (`rocm.frameworks.amd.com/whl/<gfx>`) against AMD PyTorch
  (`repo.amd.com/rocm/whl/<gfx>`). AMD builds the vLLM wheel against that
  PyTorch, so the set is intended to be self-consistent.
- **nightly** repackages AMD's official **universal-RDNA** nightly vLLM
