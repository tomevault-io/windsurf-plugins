# Canutin

Canutin is a personal finance application: SvelteKit on the frontend, PocketBase for the backend and database, and Bun for local tooling.

> `AGENTS.md` is canonical - `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it. Edit `AGENTS.md`.

Feature work happens in managed worktrees under `/.worktrees/` - see the [setup skill](./.agents/skills/setup/SKILL.md).

## Skills

Each skill lives at `.agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`. Read the ones that match the files you are about to touch, before you touch them:

- `code-quality` on every change.
- `svelte5` for any `.svelte` or `.svelte.ts` file.
- `testing` for anything under `e2e/`, and for any work that adds or changes tests.
- `pocketbase` for PocketBase collections, hooks, migrations, the generated schema, and anything under `pocketbase/`.
- `failures-and-logs` for error surfaces: try/catch boundaries, user-visible failure messages, server logging.

## Checks

`bun run quality` already runs Prettier, ESLint, and svelte-check. Run it once at the end of a chunk of work - never the pieces separately.

## Served skill reference

A change to custom routes, backend hooks, or import behavior must update `pocketbase/skill.go` in the same change, not as a follow-up - CI fails any `pocketbase/**/*.go` change without a matching `pocketbase/skill.go` or `.agents/skills/` update unless it is labeled `skip-skill-check`. See the [pocketbase skill](./.agents/skills/pocketbase/SKILL.md) for which parts of the `/api/canutin/skill` reference are hand-maintained and which are generated.
