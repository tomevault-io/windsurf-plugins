# grove — developer guide for Claude

grove gives coding agents **structural, byte-precise, token-cheap access to a
codebase** via tree-sitter, instead of reading whole files. It is a single Rust
binary with two faces — a human CLI (`grove <verb>`) and an MCP server
(`grove serve`) — over one engine. Grammars load at runtime from a WASM registry,
so new languages need no recompile.

Read [`VISION.md`](VISION.md) for the product vision and [`README.md`](README.md)
for usage. This file is the orientation for *continuing development*.

## Architecture — one engine, two faces

```
src/main.rs      CLI dispatch (clap) — every verb; thin, delegates to modules
src/ops.rs       the operations as a library — the shared engine BOTH faces call
src/mcp.rs       MCP server — newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (hand-rolled)
src/engine.rs    wasm load + Query-based tag extraction + check + position helpers
src/registry.rs  grammar resolver, cache-location precedence, catalog/index, lockfile
src/fetch.rs     `grove fetch` — install grammars from the hosted registry
src/ingest.rs    `grove ingest` — build registry artifacts from upstream releases
src/init.rs      `grove init [--as mcp|skill|both]` — provision grammars + harness glue
skills/grove/    SKILL.md — cross-harness skill, routes to MCP-or-CLI (npx skills add)
```

Data flow: `main`/`mcp` → `ops` → `engine` (+ `registry` for grammar resolution).
**Never put engine logic in `main` or `mcp`** — they only format. `ops` returns
typed `Symbol`/`Defect`/etc.; the CLI prints tables, the MCP server emits JSON.

## The tool surface (7 tools, the agent loop)

`outline` (file skeleton) · `symbols` (find across a dir) · `source` (one symbol's
code) · `check` (ERROR/MISSING nodes — post-edit verify) · `callers` (call sites +
enclosing fn) · `map` (directory dependency graph — defs + outgoing refs, no bodies) ·
`definition` (go-to-def by name or `--at file:line:col`, 1-based).

All carry a stable `symbol-id` (`<lang>:<relpath>#<name>@<line>`, line 1-based —
lines/cols are 1-based across the whole surface, `grep -n` convention). `outline` is
tiered (`--kind`, `--detail 0|1|2`) so big files stay cheap. `map` is the
breadth-control tool: it returns a directory's definitions grouped by file, each
with its outgoing references (which other symbols it calls/uses), replacing many
`symbols`+`source` round-trips with one call. MCP results are compact JSON; tool
errors come back as `isError: true` so the model can recover.

## How grammars work (important)

- A grammar = `grammar.wasm` (tree-sitter parser, native **`dylink.0`** module) +
  `tags.scm` (definition/reference query) + `manifest.json` (extensions,
  `source` provenance, and a node-kind **`profile`**).
- **Tags are extracted via the Query engine, NOT `tree-sitter-tags`** — that crate
  can't drive a wasm-loaded language (it sets a language with no wasm store). See
  `engine::extract`: it runs `tags.scm` and interprets `@definition.*`/
  `@reference.*`/`@name` captures, dedups overlapping matches by (range, is_def).
- The **profile is data in the manifest** (`function_kinds`, `containers`,
  `identifier_kinds`), not code. It drives `parent` grouping, `callers`' enclosing
  function, and go-to-def. A new language gets the full surface by dropping a
  registry dir — no recompile. Languages without a profile still get the core tools.
- `engine.rs` caches a loaded grammar (wasm store + parser + compiled query) per
  process in a thread-local, keyed by language name.

## Registry & cache

- **Resolution precedence** (first existing wins): `GROVE_REGISTRY` env →
  `<project>/.grove/grammars/` → OS cache (`~/.cache/grove/grammars` on Linux, etc.)
  → dev tree (`registry/` next to the crate). `grove registry` shows it.
- The repo ships a **3-language dev stub** in `registry/` (rust, python,
  javascript). The full 27-language registry lives in the **separate
  `Entelligentsia/grove-registry` repo**, installed via `grove fetch`.
- **Hosted layout (split host):** small text (`index.json`, per-lang `tags.scm` +
  `manifest.json`) in the repo (served via `raw.githubusercontent.com`); heavy
  `grammar.wasm` as **GitHub Release assets** (`grammars-v1`). The catalog
  (`index.json`, schema 2) has `release_base` + per-file `{sha256, asset?}`;
  `fetch` routes wasm→release, text→repo, and **verifies every hash** before
  writing (atomic).
- `registry-sources.json` is the curated spec (`repo`, `rev`, `wasm_asset`,
  `extensions`, `profile`) that `grove ingest` builds the registry from.
