## Test Validation

- When running tests locally to validate a change during agent work, prefer a low fuzz-run count or exclude the auction invariant tests unless the user explicitly asks for a full suite.
- The default full `forge test` run can take a long time in this repository, so use a bounded command such as:

```sh
forge test --fuzz-runs 64 --no-match-contract AuctionInvariantTest
```
