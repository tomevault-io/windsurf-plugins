# Constitution Compliance

Before implementing any change, check it against every numbered item in
`CONSTITUTION.md` at the repo root.

- If a requested change conflicts with an item in `CONSTITUTION.md`, stop
  and flag the conflict to the user instead of implementing a workaround
  or silently violating it.
- Never edit `CONSTITUTION.md` itself as a side effect of an unrelated
  task — changes to it require explicit user/maintainer approval.
- This rule covers *product* principles only. For code style,
  architecture, and dev workflow conventions, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
