## PhenoFarm Codex Workspace

Read `.codex/project-context.md` before making changes. It contains the repo's current service bindings, validation commands, and deployment targets.

### Operating rules
- Never hardcode secrets. Use env vars from local env files or platform config.
- This repo has both local and production database targets. Confirm which env file is active before running migrations, auth changes, or deploys.
- Prefer existing npm scripts for build, test, lint, and Prisma work instead of ad hoc commands.
- For deployable changes, run the smallest meaningful validation before deploy and verify the production URL after deploy.
- Do not expose Stripe or auth secrets in code, logs, docs, or test fixtures.
