# General Coding Philosophy

## Core Principles

- **Readability:** Both code and commits should be immediately understandable.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be easy to refactor and extend.
- **Consistency:** Apply the same conventions across files and modules, except where external code (e.g., XLA) is imported.
- **Performance:** Prioritize clarity, but optimize carefully where latency and cost are critical.

## Comment Style

- Non-trivial code changes must be accompanied by comments.
- Comments explain **why** a change or design decision was made or explain the code for better readability.
- Use full sentences with proper punctuation.

## File Formatting

- Every file must end with a single newline.
- No trailing whitespace.
- No extra blank lines at EOF.

## License

- Every file (that could be exceptional case, such as empty BUILD.bazel) should have license notice at the top.
- **New Files**: For any new files created from now on, the copyright year should be set to 2026.
- **Refactored Files**: If a file is moved or renamed as part of a refactoring process, you may retain the original creation year from the source file.
