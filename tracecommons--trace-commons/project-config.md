# AGENTS.md — trace-commons-server

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` holds the
full repo guidance (build commands, CI gates, conventions, known gotchas); read
it too. This file leads with licensing because it is the one rule here whose
violation a compiler will never report.

## Licensing: the split is load-bearing

This repository is **split-licensed**. Which license applies depends on which
crate the code lives in.

### AGPL-3.0-or-later

Copyright (C) 2026 K&Z Partners LLC.

- `crates/trace-commons-server`
- `crates/trace-commons-gate-api`
- `crates/trace-commons-gate-enclave`

Every `.rs` file in these three crates begins with:

```rust
// Copyright (C) 2026 K&Z Partners LLC
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
```

**Any new `.rs` file you add to these crates needs that header.** It goes at
line 1, above any inner attribute (`#![...]`) — a comment before an inner
attribute is legal Rust.

### MIT OR Apache-2.0

- `crates/trace-commons-protocol`
- `crates/trace-commons-contributor`
- `crates/trace-commons-contributor-ffi`
- `crates/trace-commons-contributor-gtk`
- `crates/trace-commons-operator-client`
- `crates/trace-commons-mark`
- `crates/trace-commons-build-info`

These stay permissive deliberately. The contributor CLI, the desktop apps, and
the envelope protocol are meant to be embedded in proprietary agent harnesses;
Ironclaw consumes `trace-commons-protocol` directly. Do **not** add AGPL headers
to files in these crates.

### The one rule

**Permissive code may flow into the AGPL crates. Never the reverse.**

Do not add `trace-commons-server`, `trace-commons-gate-api`, or
`trace-commons-gate-enclave` to the dependencies of any permissive crate — not
even to reuse a single trait or type. Doing so silently makes a shipped client
copyleft, and nothing about the build will tell you.

If you need a type on both sides, put it in `trace-commons-protocol` (or another
permissive crate) and let the AGPL side depend on it. That is the direction the
seam is designed for.

`crates/trace-commons-server/tests/license_boundary.rs` enforces this. If it
fails, the fix is to remove the dependency — **not** to edit the expected sets
in the test. Those sets are the specification; changing them to match your diff
defeats the check entirely.

Test-only `dev-dependencies` across the boundary are permitted, because they
never reach a published artifact. The existing set is pinned in that same test
file (`trace-commons-contributor` takes one on `trace-commons-server` under
`cfg(not(windows))`). Adding a new one requires updating that list on purpose.

### Inbound contributions are MIT/Apache, outbound is AGPL

Contributions arrive under `MIT OR Apache-2.0` — including contributions to the
three AGPL crates. Recipients of those crates still get them under AGPL; only
the inbound direction is permissive, so the project keeps the ability to
relicense what it distributes.

This is stated in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, in the PR template checklist, in `LICENSE`,
and in the README. If you touch any of those, keep them consistent — a
contributor who reads only one of them must not come away with a different
answer.

An AGPL header on a file is about how that file is *distributed*. It says
nothing about the inbound terms, and adding one does not change them.

### Why the gate crates are AGPL

`crates/trace-commons-gate-api/README.md` describes the gate traits as a seam
where a proprietary scoring backend substitutes. Putting that seam under AGPL is
deliberate: it is available to the copyright holder, who can license itself, and
closed to third parties.

There is no CLA, but the inbound MIT/Apache term above is what preserves this:
without it, a single outside contribution to either gate crate would end the
ability to grant a proprietary exception on it permanently. Do not accept a
contribution to these crates offered under other terms without raising it.

### AGPL section 13

Section 13 obliges anyone running a modified version as a network service to
offer users the Corresponding Source. `trace-commons-ingest` does this at
`GET /v1/source`.

That route is **unauthenticated, carries no tenant context, and sits outside
every fail-closed gate**, by design. Do not put it behind auth, do not add a
tenant predicate to it, and do not let a middleware change sweep it up. A
credential requirement defeats the section it exists to satisfy. See
`docs/operator/agpl-source-offer.md`.

`TRACE_COMMONS_SOURCE_URL` is a constant, not an environment variable. That is
intentional — section 13 binds the operator of a *modified* build, who is
already editing the source. Do not turn it into config.

### Dependency licenses

New dependencies must be combinable into an AGPL-3.0 work. `deny.toml` holds the
allow list; a GPL-2.0-only, SSPL, or proprietary dependency is a hard conflict.

```bash
cargo deny check licenses
cargo deny --features near-ai-scorer check licenses
cargo deny --features local-gpu-models check licenses
cargo deny --all-features check licenses
```

Run all three, plus a fourth under `--all-features`: the feature sets pull in
different trees, and 54 crates resolve only under `--all-features` (see
`CLAUDE.md`). CI covers them at once by running `check licenses` and
