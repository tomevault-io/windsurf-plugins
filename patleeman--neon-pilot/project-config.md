# neon-pilot repo instructions

neon-pilot is Patrick's personal AI agent runtime. Keep core small and build user-facing features as extensions by default.

## Always-on rules

- Prefer correct, complete implementations over compatibility shims or narrow safe cuts.
- If a feature needs a shared boundary — process execution, security policy, persistence, routing, extension APIs — implement the boundary and wire first-class call sites through it.
- Build product/workflow UX in extensions unless the work is core runtime, security, persistence, extension-host infrastructure, app-shell plumbing, routing, install/update plumbing, or shared UI primitives.
- If the extension API is missing a capability, add the smallest general-purpose API surface to core instead of hardcoding a one-off feature.
- Extension runtime code must not import `@neon-pilot/core`, `@neon-pilot/desktop`, `packages/desktop/*`, or `packages/core/*` directly. Route host access through `@neon-pilot/extensions` and narrow `@neon-pilot/extensions/backend/*` subpaths.
- Host backend API modules in `packages/desktop/server/extensions/backendApi/*` are boundary shims. Keep them small, typed from public extension contracts, and lazy-load host/core implementation through `serverModuleResolver`; do not statically re-export core or desktop internals.
- Do not introduce environment variables for app/runtime configuration. Pass state explicitly through typed config/context APIs; keep env reads only for unavoidable external-process compatibility with existing legacy variables.
- For web UI, prefer server-pushed updates over polling when the backend can publish events.
- Multiple agents may be working here. Do targeted changes and targeted checkpoints; stop if unrelated edits conflict with your work.

## Prompt and knowledge rules

- Use `CONTEXT.md` as the canonical glossary for product/domain vocabulary. Prefer its terms in code, docs, UI copy, and agent-facing instructions; update it immediately when a term is clarified. Keep it glossary-only: no implementation details, specs, scratch notes, or architecture decisions.
- Never modify the system prompt from extension `before_agent_start` handlers. Use file-based instruction layers instead: repo defaults, vault root `AGENTS.md`, machine-local `~/.config/agents/AGENTS.md`, or cwd `AGENTS.md`.
- Docs are for agents. Update docs whenever behavior or workflow changes.
- Before changing feature behavior, read the owning extension README plus relevant docs from `docs/README.md`.

## Validation and checkpoints

- Validate the actual work before calling it done. Use the narrowest meaningful check first, then broader checks when risk warrants it.
- Run the relevant build before saying a task is complete. For desktop/app or shared package changes, include the affected package build or `node packages/desktop/scripts/build-main.mjs`/`pnpm --dir packages/desktop run build:ui` as appropriate; for extension changes, build the affected extension and reinstall it when validating through the app.
- Do not leave the app in a state where Patrick cannot start it locally. After TypeScript, desktop/app, extension host, build script, or shared package changes, run the startup path or its full blocking build equivalent before handing off: prefer `pnpm run desktop:dev -- --no-quit-confirmation` when app launch behavior could be affected, and at minimum run the package build that performs `tsc --noUnusedLocals`/production type checks. Treat unused symbols, stale generated code, or other build-only failures as blockers, even when focused tests pass.
- When changing behavior a user reaches through the desktop app, an extension page, a sidebar route, settings, transcript rendering, or a tool, validate the same path the user will use. Open the route/page/control or invoke the tool through the app/extension host, verify the rendered UI or visible output, and cover empty/error/loading states when relevant.
- Do not treat backend/unit tests, manifest checks, or worker smokes as substitutes for user-visible validation. They are necessary support checks, not proof that the user-facing path works.
- If full user-visible validation is impossible, say exactly what was not validated and why. Do not imply manual or app-path validation happened when only lower-level checks ran.
- For extension pages, confirm the nav route opens, the frontend invokes its backend actions, and those actions work with the real action context shape, not only test-only context stubs.
- For workflow/tool features, run at least one representative invocation and confirm the transcript/page/status result the user would inspect.
- For extension/core boundary work, run `pnpm run check:extensions:static` or at least `node scripts/check-core-extension-boundary.mjs && node scripts/check-extension-backend-api.mjs`.
- If you modify web UI, perform a visual check. Use the repo wrapper for agent-browser sessions and clean up only processes you started.
- Before final summary, use the `checkpoint` skill/tool for a targeted commit when available; otherwise use git directly. Do not stage unrelated files.
