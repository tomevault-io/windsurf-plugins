description: **Repo conventions:**

**Repo conventions:**
1. **Crash early and loudly** - Fail hard in development so bugs cannot hide. Never allow silent failures.
2. **Explicit configuration** - No defaults. If something is missing, stop and surface it immediately.
3. **Type hints everywhere** - Make expectations clear and support safe refactoring.
4. **Short and clear documentation** - Keep explanations concise without losing clarity.
5. **Open source friendly** - Never commit secrets or anything that should not be public.
7. **Prefer simple solutions** - Use straightforward approaches that follow the conventions. Avoid cleverness when simplicity works.
8. **Follow the established conventions** - Keep structure predictable so the codebase stays readable and easy to maintain. 
9. **No quick fixes** - Fix issues in a way that holds for all future deployments, not only the current device.
10. **GitHub** - Always commit manually. Never commit automatically. 
11. **Clean repo** - Value simplicity and cleanliness. No redundant MD files. 
12. **No Title Case** - Use natural English capitalisation. That means only capitalising the first word of sentences and proper nouns (like "Peter van Lunteren", "Utrecht", "MegaDetector", "SpeciesNet", "Today, I was walking in the park.",  "Things I love about Amsterdam.", "Cities visited"). Do capitalize the first letter of headers (e.g., "Detections per 100 trap-days", "Species selection", "Observations"). 
13. **Use built in features if possible** - Always check whether the required functionality is already available through built-in features. If so, prefer that over writing custom code. If a built-in option is close but does not fully meet the requirement, stop and discuss the pros and cons before proceeding.
14. **No em dashes** - Never use em dashes (—) or double hyphens (--) in text. Use commas, colons, semicolons, or separate sentences instead.
15. **Write like a person, not an LLM** - Avoid filler phrases like "it's important to note that", "let's", "dive into", "in order to", "leverage", "streamline", "it should be noted", or "please note that". Just say the thing directly. Keep text natural and to the point.
* Follow the KISS principle. Keep things as simple as possible.                                                                       
* Follow the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). Avoid duplication and maintain a single source of truth.                          
* Follow the YAGNI principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It). Do not build functionality until it is actually needed. 
* Use shared helpers if possible. I do not want drift and maintain different code sets. Also, shared halpers make sure the UI looks and feels the same, and possible bugs are fixed sooner. 
* ALways ask before opening a new branch. Prefer to work on main, except for very large tasks or rewrites. If preferable to have a separate branch, ask permission first. 



Return all your explanations, answers, reports, and investigations with a few sentence summary in plain English at the bottom of your response. Keep it simple.
