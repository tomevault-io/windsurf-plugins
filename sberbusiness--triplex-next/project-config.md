## Triplex-Next Design System

Treat `docs/ai/*` as the source of truth for project conventions.

Before modifying components:
- Read `docs/ai/CONTEXT.md`
- Read `docs/ai/codestyle.md`
- If present, read `src/components/{ComponentName}/{ComponentName}-ai.md`

Then follow the detailed guide for the area you touch:
- `docs/ai/codestyle.md`
- `docs/ai/tests.md`
- `docs/ai/stories-guide.md`
- `docs/ai/commits.md`
- `docs/ai/ai-refactoring.md` (rules for ROADMAP "AI refactoring" column)

Use `docs/ai/CONTEXT.md` for source priority and verification expectations.

If `{ComponentName}-ai.md` does not exist:
- inspect the component source, stories, and tests
- follow the local file pattern
- do not create a new `*-ai.md` file unless the task explicitly asks for it

Keep this Cursor rule as a thin entrypoint. Do not duplicate detailed rules here if they already live in `docs/ai/*`.
