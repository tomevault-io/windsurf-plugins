 # OpenXAPI Project Rules

## Project Purpose
- Create a Go program that automatically generates OpenAPI Specifications from various cryptocurrency exchange API documentation
- Enable automatic SDK generation for multiple programming languages using the generated OpenAPI Specs

## Core Requirements
1. Exchange API URL Management
   - Support multiple API URLs per exchange
   - Store and manage exchange API documentation URLs
   - Enable easy addition of new exchange URLs
   - Maintain URL configurations persistently

2. OpenAPI Spec Generation
   - Parse exchange API documentation pages
   - Extract API endpoints, parameters, and response structures
   - Generate valid OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
   - Support incremental updates when API docs change

3. Automation Features
   - Support repeated execution for updates
   - Track API documentation changes
   - Regenerate specs when source documentation updates
   - Maintain version history of generated specs

4. Code Quality
   - Follow Go best practices and idioms
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Include comprehensive logging
   - Write unit tests for core functionality

5. Documentation
   - Maintain clear documentation for the project
   - Document the process for adding new exchanges
   - Include usage examples and configuration guides
   - Keep track of supported exchanges

## Project Structure
- Organize code by exchange
- Separate parsing logic from spec generation
- Use configuration files for exchange URLs
- Implement modular design for easy extension
