description: Helpful tips while editing a Livebook .livemd file

Any time you edit a .livemd file.
Call the fetch_livemd_outputs tool to verify that your changes successfully executed.
When you are writing code in an elixir markdown cell, you don't need to `IO.inspect()` or print anything as the last expression will automatically be printed out.
Imports and aliases create in one cell are available in subsequent cells.
