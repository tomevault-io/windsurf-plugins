# AGENTS.md — Rational Constitution Project

## Mission
Collaboratively evolve a minimal, rational constitution and related Acts using Markdown.
All deliberation is recorded through automatically maintained ADR drafts; all final changes are validated, logged, and committed only with explicit consent.

---

## Guardrails
- Only edit files when asked; **/check-in** is the explicit commit/push trigger.
- During **/check-in**, commit all intended changes (constitution/acts/ADRs/tooling) plus the prepared `log/changelog.md` entry; ensure no unintended files are included.
- Keep constitutional/act text clean; no inline provenance markers or footers.
- Prefer small, auditable diffs; reference ADRs in ADRs, commits, and changelog (not inline in articles).

## Provenance (per file)
- No inline markers in governed texts (e.g., `constitution.md`, `acts/*.md`).
- Provenance is maintained via:
  - ADRs (drafts and finals) with clear “Changed Sections”,
  - commit messages referencing ADR IDs/titles, and
  - `log/changelog.md` entries linking ADRs to specific files/sections.
- A concise, out-of-band provenance index is kept at `log/provenance.md` mapping files → ADRs/commits. It is updated at `/record` and is safe to publish; it does not modify governed texts.

## Automatic ADR Handling

When conversation touches on constitutional or structural topics:

1. **Detect or create an active ADR draft** in `log/ideas/_drafts/` for the topic.
   - Name: `session-YYYYMMDD-HHMM-topic.md`
   - Include timestamp, summary, and incremental updates as discussion progresses.
2. **Append updates automatically** after each significant turn:
   - Add new arguments, tradeoffs, pros/cons, open questions.
   - Update Core alignment flags.
   - Do not overwrite previous text except to fix clarity/typos.
3. If conversation shifts topics:
   - Pause current ADR (record timestamp).
   - Start or switch to a new ADR draft.
4. ADR drafts remain until `/record` finalizes them into numbered ADRs.
5. Upon finalization via `/record`, drafts are promoted to numbered ADRs and the draft files are removed (not archived) by default. Git history preserves all draft evolution. If you explicitly mark a draft as Paused, it may remain in `_drafts/` until resumed or discarded.

Before `/check-in`, all active ADR drafts must be finalized via `/record`. The only drafts allowed to remain are those explicitly marked Paused by the user.

---

### Brainstorm Exception to Auto-Recording
- When Brainstorm mode is active, the assistant does not write to ADRs or files unless explicitly instructed.
- Instead, it maintains an internal/session scratchpad of discussion (concepts, alternatives, tradeoffs, open questions).
- On exit from Brainstorm, the assistant should first propose a structured summary of the discussion for appending to the active ADR draft; it will append only if you explicitly confirm. Normal auto-recording may resume thereafter.

This preserves the “always records” principle via deliberate, batched recording rather than per-turn writes.

## ADR Finalization Guidelines (Single Source of Truth)

When finalizing an ADR via `/record`, use promote-by-rename as the default:

- Move + rename the active draft from `log/ideas/_drafts/session-...-topic.md` to `log/ideas/adr-XXXX-kebab-title.md` (next number).
- Then make minimal finalize edits only:
  - Update Title/Number, `Status`, and `Date` (past tense voice).
  - Ensure sections match the ADR template (Context, Decision, Rationale, Alternatives, Consequences, Changed Sections, Links).
  - Add a concise “Changed Sections” block if governed texts are edited.
  - Add Links to related ADRs and relevant files.
- Remove the now-finalized draft from `_drafts/` (the git history preserves all iterations).

Notes:
- Prefer this flow over regenerating the ADR to avoid content drift and reduce risk/cost.
- Command docs should reference this section rather than duplicate guidelines.

---

## Authoring Aids (Pointers)

- Single source of truth for ADR authoring/finalization is this file (see “ADR Finalization Guidelines” above).
- Default finalization flow: promote-by-rename the active draft to `log/ideas/adr-XXXX-title.md`, then minimally update metadata and required sections.
- Provenance policy: governed texts remain clean (no inline markers). Maintain provenance via ADRs with “Changed Sections,” commit messages referencing ADR IDs, `log/changelog.md`, and `log/provenance.md`.
- Avoid scattering guidance across extra files or folders; link back here from command docs.

## Constitutional Core (Decision Filter)

All proposals must satisfy:

1. **Assume human nature** – individuals/corporations act in self-interest; design incentives accordingly.  
2. **Harness, don’t hope** – channel ambition toward public good; avoid dark incentives.  
3. **Power diffused, checked** – minimize concentrated authority; ensure retroactive accountability.  
4. **Radical transparency** – data, models, and actions open by default.  
5. **Democracy on outcomes** – citizens vote for goals, technocrats execute; measure all results.  
6. **Market where possible** – use externality pricing and performance competition.
