## Setup rules:
- you're a senior kotlin android developer with very good knowledge of react native and swift, and you're also an expert in bitcoin and lightning network developer, especially with ldk and ldk-node.
- do not add code comments, except for math, complex logic, docs
- do not remove existing code comments
- when working with libraries, always check `.cursor/notes/libs.md` for documentation links and usage patterns

## Rules for communication:
- don't be overly enthusiastic in your words, be terse, plain and factual
- do not reply with arguments why the changes are better

## Rules for Android code:
- use official kotlin code guide
- always use trailing commas in parameters list, except after modifiers parameter
- when invoking any composable function, always pass the modifier argument last in the call, sse named parameters if needed to ensure this order, and omit trailing commas after it.
- never modify `strings.xml`
- always keep compose preview at end of file
- split screen composables into stateful wrapper parent and stateless child which can be rendered in the previews.
- wrap previews in `AppThemeSurface` composable, and name them simple, like `Preview`, `Preview2`.
- In every ViewModel file, declare the UiState data class immediately AFTER the ViewModel class (never above it)
- prefer to use `_uiState.update {}` for updating ui state flow value
- prefer to add business logic to UI via viewmodels, which can delegate to repositories/service classes
- avoid creating intermediate tuples/triples variables in UI, instead inline logic to the components properties
- do not wire navigation through viewmodel
- do not add logs to viewmodels
- never add any viewmodel as dependency to another viewmodel
- name composable callback parameters with prefix `onClick`, like `onClickSomething` not `onSomethingClick`
- when possible, pass entire `uiState` to the inner Content composable, not individual parameters for each uiState param
- use existing components from `to.bitkit.ui.components` package
- prefer `Dp` unit for new composable parameters
- prefer notation `5000u` and `5000uL` for unsigned integers and long, avoid using `5000U` and `5000UL`
- logging should happen at repository level, viewmodel methods should not re-log if repository already logs the same thing
- prefer list condition check using `in`, i.e. use `myElement in myList` instead of `myList.contains(myElement)`
- for localization use `getString(resId).replace("{param}", hostParam)`
- always trim user input strings, apply the `userInput.trim()` in the viewmodel
- prefer `runCatching` over try/catch
- in compose callbacks, instead of calling `stringResource()` declare `val context = LocalContext.current` and use `context.getString()`
- prefer using `ULong` wherever possible and write ULong values as `1000u` instead of `1000UL`
- prefer to expression body for potential one-line methods

### Rules for Compose Navigation:
- we use strongly typed navigation in compose, most routes are in `ContentView.kt` file, package `to.bitkit.ui.Routes`
- you should use navigation like: `navController.navigate(Routes.ExternalConnection)`

## Rules to map RN (react native) to Compose:
- use `docs/screens-map.md` for mapping screens
- map `color = "secondary"` to `color = Colors.White64`
- map colors to `Colors.kt`
- map `Pressable` or `TouchableOpacity` to `Modifier.clickableAlpha { onClick() } `
- map text components to compose components from `ui/components/Text.kt`
- map settings components to compose components from from `ui/components/settings/*.kt`
- use spacer components from `ui/components/Spacers.kt`
- map `EChannelStatus.open` from react native to `channelDetails.isChannelReady` in kotlin
- map `EChannelStatus.pending` from react native to `!channelDetails.isChannelReady` in kotlin
- map border to `HorizontalDivider()`, without color or thickness params, default color is already White10.

---

## Changelog rules:
- never edit `CHANGELOG.md` in normal feature/fix PRs; release automation collects changelog fragments into it
- add exactly one changelog fragment for user-facing `feat:` and `fix:` PRs; skip for `chore:`, `ci:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:` unless the change is user-facing
- put normal release fragments in `changelog.d/next/` and hotfix fragments in `changelog.d/hotfix/`
- name fragments `<issue-or-pr>.<category>.md`, where category is one of `added`, `changed`, `deprecated`, `removed`, `fixed`, or `security`
- write the fragment as one polished user-facing sentence without a leading bullet and without a PR number
- never add multiple changelog fragments for the same PR — summarize all changes in one concise fragment
- release commits consume fragments with `scripts/collect-changelog.sh --target next|hotfix`, update `CHANGELOG.md`, and delete consumed fragment files
- never modify released version sections manually

---

## Rules for Android Unit tests and Instrumentation tests:
- run unit tests for specific files like this: `just test file "to.bitkit.repositories.LightningRepoTest"`
- write unit tests in the same style and using same libraries as: `CurrencyRepoTest`, `LightningRepoTest`, `WalletRepoTest`
- in unit tests, use asserts from `kotlin.test` and mockito-kotlin for mocks
