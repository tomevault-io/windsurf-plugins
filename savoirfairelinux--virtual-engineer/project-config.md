# Virtual Engineer - Copilot Guidelines

This file is always loaded. Keep it limited to rules and facts that apply to
almost every task. Use [.github/context/INDEX.md](./context/INDEX.md) to route
task-specific questions to the canonical reference documents.

## Graphify

When `graphify-out/graph.json` exists, start codebase questions with:

```text
graphify query "<question>"
```

Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain
"<concept>"` for a focused concept. Use `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` for broad
navigation when it exists. After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to
keep the graph current. If the executable is unavailable, use the persisted
graph data or ordinary repository search without blocking the task.

## Documentation Ownership

When code changes, update the matching documentation in the same commit. The
file-scoped rules in [`.github/instructions/`](./instructions/) are the
authoritative ownership map:

| Code area | Canonical documentation |
|---|---|
| `src/state/schema.ts`, `src/state/databaseMigrations.ts`, `src/state/stateStore.ts`, `src/state/stores/**`, `src/state/migrate.ts` | [`context/database.md`](./context/database.md) |
| `src/state/stateMachine.ts`, `src/interfaces.ts`, `src/domain/tasks.ts` | [`context/state-machine.md`](./context/state-machine.md) |
| `src/config.ts` | [`context/configuration.md`](./context/configuration.md) |
| `src/agents/**`, `agent-worker/**` | [`context/modules/agents.md`](./context/modules/agents.md) |
| `src/connectors/**`, `src/vcs/**`, `src/plugins/**` | the matching connector, VCS, or plugin module doc |
| `src/admin/**` | [`context/modules/admin.md`](./context/modules/admin.md) |
| `src/orchestrator/**`, `src/review/**` | [`context/modules/orchestrator.md`](./context/modules/orchestrator.md) |
| `src/workspace/**` | [`context/architecture.md`](./context/architecture.md) and [`context/modules/workspace.md`](./context/modules/workspace.md) |
| `src/index.ts`, `src/bootstrap/**`, `src/runtime/**`, `src/openshell/**` | the affected architecture, runtime, workspace, agent, or database doc |
| `tests/**` | [`context/testing.md`](./context/testing.md) |
| project tooling configuration | this file's gates plus [`context/testing.md`](./context/testing.md) or [`context/configuration.md`](./context/configuration.md) |

Purely internal changes with no observable contract or behavior change do not
need documentation churn.

## Quality Gates

Run the relevant focused check first, then all three gates before a commit:

```text
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

Useful project commands include `npm run build:ui`, `npm run build:agent`,
`npm run db:migrate`, `npm run db:generate`, `npm run build`, and `npm run
dev`. See [`context/testing.md`](./context/testing.md) for test conventions.

## Non-negotiable Boundaries

- The orchestrator runs on the host. Agents run in ephemeral OpenShell
  sandboxes using upload -> exec -> download for coding and upload -> exec for
  review. There is no direct Docker workspace runner or named workspace volume.
- OpenShell runtime policies provide the isolation floor: deny-by-default
  filesystem, network, and process access; the `sandbox` user/group; and
  writable paths limited to `/sandbox`, `/tmp`, `/dev/null`, and the narrow
  `/dev/pts` PTY device tree required by nested agent shells. Do not restore
  Docker security flags as a substitute.
- The host owns clone, checkout, cherry-pick, and push orchestration. The
  worker owns commit collection and Change-Id/trailer injection inside the
  sandbox. Push credentials never enter the sandbox. Provider commit behavior
  is governed by the provider-native runtime contract.
- Provider credentials and provider configuration live in the database and are
  managed through the admin UI. Do not add provider settings to environment
  variables or hardcode credentials.
- Multiple integrations of the same provider may be active. Resolve runtime
  dependencies by integration id, capability, or an explicit integration list;
  never assume one active integration per provider.
- Agent engines are Copilot, Claude, Aider, Goose, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode,
  and Cursor. Their execution, auth, egress, prompt, and submission contracts
  live in [`context/modules/agents.md`](./context/modules/agents.md).

## Critical Invariants

- Timestamps are stored in seconds since epoch. Use
  `datetime(column, 'unixepoch')`, never divide by 1000.
- The `tasks` primary key is `task_id` (TEXT); there is no `tasks.id` column.
- Pause and resume are `state_transitions` rows with equal `from_state` and
  `to_state` plus `metadata.action`, not boolean task columns.
- State definitions and transitions are owned by `src/domain/tasks.ts`,
  `src/interfaces.ts`, and `src/state/stateMachine.ts`; consult
  [`context/state-machine.md`](./context/state-machine.md) before changing them.
- Database schema changes require a new immutable Drizzle migration. Never
  extend the frozen compatibility bridge or edit an applied migration.
- Runtime sandbox policies are separate from PBAC policies. Never reuse
  `policy_bindings` for OpenShell assignments.
