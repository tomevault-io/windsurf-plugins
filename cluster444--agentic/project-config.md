# Agentic Repository Overview

This repository contains subagents and commands designed to enhance opencode's capabilities through modular, specialized components.

## Directory Structure

### `/agent`
Contains subagents that function as specialized task performers for opencode. Each subagent executes a series of tool calls and returns structured information that the main agent can process and utilize.

### `/command`
Houses commands available to the main agent. These commands leverage subagents to perform complex operations while minimizing context consumption through contextual compression, allowing the main agent to work more efficiently.
