# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` for full workflow context.

> **Architecture in one line:** Issues live in a local Dolt database
> (`.beads/dolt/`); cross-machine sync uses `bd dolt push/pull` (a
> git-compatible protocol), stored under `refs/dolt/data` on your git
> remote — separate from `refs/heads/*` where your code lives.
> `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export, not the wire protocol.
>
> See [SYNC_CONCEPTS.md](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md)
> for the one-screen overview and anti-patterns (don't treat JSONL as the
> source of truth; don't `bd import` during normal operation; don't
> reach for third-party Dolt hosting before trying the default).

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work atomically
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd dolt push          # Push beads data to remote
```

## Verification

**Run the suites in the macOS container.** `bun run test:container`, or a
subset with `SUITES="unit layout" bun run test:container`. Setup, knobs and
gotchas: `container/README.md`.

```bash
bun run test:container   # everything, in the VM — the verdict
bun test                 # mcp-server tests            (anywhere)
bun run test:layout      # clipping, overlap, text-fit (anywhere — off-screen)
bun run test:visual      # screenshot + OCR per fixture ⚠ container
bun run test:keyboard    # the keyboard contract        ⚠ container
```

The two marked ⚠ spawn a real dialog per case. On a machine somebody is using
they take the screen and the keyboard for minutes, and any focus change
corrupts the result silently — the visual suite spent months photographing one
stuck window and reporting OK. `test:layout` is the exception: it renders
off-display, so it is safe anywhere and it is the one that fails a build.

A green layout run is not a clean surface. It waives every state with a known
open bug and prints a `NOT VOUCHED FOR` line naming them. Read it.

Changing a dialog type touches more places than it looks — the checklist is in
`.claude/rules/dialog-parity.md`. A fixture without a row in
`test-cases/skin-states/states.tsv` is never measured.

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
