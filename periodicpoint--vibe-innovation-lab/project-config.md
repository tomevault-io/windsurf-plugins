# Vibe Innovation Lab

General-purpose innovation framework for human-AI co-creation. Covers TRL -2 (pre-concept exploration) through TRL 4 (validated learning). Applies to technical innovations (software, hardware, data products) and non-technical innovations (protocols, pilot designs, service blueprints, policy drafts, institutional processes). Phases 0 through 3 and Phase 5 are domain-agnostic. Phase 4 has a code branch and an institutional-drafting branch. Both produce a spike, prototype, or MVP at the same TRL level. See `.claude/docs/trl_specification.md` for the full extended TRL scale.

## Default behavior

When a user starts a conversation in this repository without a specific technical request (code fix, file edit, and so on), assume they want to use the innovation framework. Proactively offer to run the entry diagnostic:

1. Read `.claude/docs/orchestrator.md` and `.claude/docs/innovation_canvas_document.md`.
2. Ask whether they have an existing Innovation Canvas Document (ICD).
3. Run the entry diagnostic from the Orchestrator: starting point, team, constraints, prior knowledge, success criteria, biggest uncertainty.
4. Profile the uncertainty and map it to a TRL entry point (see table below).
5. Initialize the ICD if none exists.
6. Dispatch to the recommended phase.

This diagnostic is also available explicitly via `/innovate` (standalone mode) or `/vibe-innovation:innovate` (plugin mode).

## TRL entry mapping

See `.claude/docs/trl_specification.md` for the full extended TRL scale definition.

| Situation | TRL | Entry phase |
|---|---|---|
| No topic, only a general direction | -2 | Phase 0: Strategic framing |
| Problem space mapped, no specific problem | -1 | Phase 1: Problem discovery |
| Problem defined, no solution idea | 0 | Phase 2: Ideation |
| Solution concept exists, value unclear | 1 | Phase 3: Value architecture |
| Value articulated, no prototype | 2 | Phase 4: Build and validate |
| Prototype built, validation limited | 3 | Phase 5: Decision (early entry, reduced confidence) |
| Prototype validated, decision pending | 4 | Phase 5: Decision |

## Repository structure

1. `.claude/docs/` contains the innovation process specification: Orchestrator, Innovation Canvas Document (ICD), TRL specification, 6 phase prompts, principles and anti-patterns, chaos protocol, red team protocol, loop-back protocol, executive summary template, personas reference, validation methods catalog, glossary, institutional templates, bias and anti-pattern field guide, and two worked example ICDs (technical and institutional). These are the lazy-loaded reference texts that the skills read on demand.
2. `.claude/skills/` contains Claude Code skill definitions: `/innovate`, `/innovate-phase`, `/innovate-status`, `/innovate-icd`, `/innovate-redteam`, `/innovate-experiment`, `/innovate-loopback`, `/innovate-export`, `/chaos`.
3. `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/schemas/` complete the Claude Code surface: thin orchestrator agent, slash-command discovery layer, glob-bound editing rules, and the ICD JSON schema.
4. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is the marketplace manifest. `plugins/vibe-innovation/` is the distributable plugin payload (skills, agents, docs, schemas) regenerated from `.claude/` by `mise run sync-plugin`. The plugin is the source-of-truth for end users who install via `/plugin install vibe-innovation@vibe-innovation-lab`. `.claude/` is the source-of-truth for the framework author and for in-repo standalone use.
5. `prototype/` contains Streamlit starter infrastructure for rapid prototyping (`app.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, vibe coding constraints).
6. `mise.toml` defines the lint, structure-check, ICD-validate, format, sync-plugin, and check-plugin tasks. The PostToolUse hook in `.claude/settings.json` enforces lint on every Markdown edit.

## Conventions

1. Framework and documentation: English.
2. All other conventions follow the global CLAUDE.md.

## Innovation process phases

1. Phase 0: Strategic framing (TRL -2 to -1)
2. Phase 1: Problem discovery (TRL -1 to 0)
3. Phase 2: Ideation (TRL 0 to 1)
4. Phase 3: Value architecture (TRL 1 to 2)
5. Phase 4: Build and validate (TRL 2 to 3 or 4)
6. Phase 5: Decision (TRL 4, or TRL 3 with reduced confidence)
