# AGENTS.md — AGNTDEV Telegram bot

A grammY Telegram bot. The AGNTDEV bot toolkit (curated grammY SDK + UI-kit + session storage + test harness) is vendored in `src/toolkit/`. You implement ONE task at
a time so it passes the Tests-gate and merges.

## Setup / build / run
```bash
npm install
npm run build     # tsc -p tsconfig.json → dist/
npm start         # node dist/index.js (needs BOT_TOKEN)
```

## Structure (extend these — do not rearchitect)
- `src/handlers/<slug>.ts` — **add features here** (one file per feature; each
  default-exports a grammY `Composer`). `buildBot()` auto-loads every file in
  this directory at startup. **NEVER edit `src/bot.ts`** to wire in new
  commands — that creates merge conflicts when concurrent PRs each touch the
  same shared file.
- `src/bot.ts` — `buildBot(token)`: assembles the bot, auto-loads all
  `src/handlers/` modules, and registers the unknown-message fallback. Do NOT
  edit this file to add features.
- `src/index.ts` — runtime entry (reads `BOT_TOKEN`, starts the bot).
- `src/harness-entry.ts` — exports `makeBot()` for the Tests-gate (tokenless replay).
- `tests/specs/<slug>.json` — per-feature dialog tests (a `BotSpec` array).
- `tests/commands/<slug>.json` — per-feature declared-command manifest (a JSON string array).

## Adding a feature — BUTTON-FIRST

This bot is **button-driven**: the owners are non-technical and their users
operate the bot by TAPPING, not by typing slash commands. Make every feature
reachable from the `/start` main menu as an inline **button**, NOT a new slash
command. (Slash commands are only for `/start`, `/help`, or free-form typed input
the user already knows how to enter — a search query, note, address, date, time,
or amount. Do NOT add `bot.command("<feature>")` just to make a feature reachable;
that is how bots end up with dozens of cryptic, overlapping commands.)

Create a NEW file `src/handlers/<slug>.ts` that default-exports a grammY
`Composer`. `buildBot()` auto-loads every file in `src/handlers/` at startup, so
your handler is wired up automatically. **NEVER edit `src/bot.ts` or `start.ts`** —
register your menu button with `registerMainMenuItem(...)` and the shipped
`/start` renders it. Each feature touches only its own file, so concurrent PRs
never conflict.

```ts
import { Composer } from "grammy";
import type { Ctx } from "../bot.js";
import { registerMainMenuItem, inlineButton, inlineKeyboard } from "../toolkit/index.js";

// Adds a "📅 Today" button to the /start main menu (no slash command).
registerMainMenuItem({ label: "📅 Today", data: "today:show", order: 20 });

const composer = new Composer<Ctx>();
composer.callbackQuery("today:show", async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.answerCallbackQuery();
  await ctx.editMessageText("Today's bookings: …", {
    reply_markup: inlineKeyboard([[inlineButton("⬅️ Back to menu", "menu:main")]]),
  });
});
export default composer;
```

Friendly copy: short messages, clear button labels (≤1 emoji, no "?"), an
empty-state line ("No bookings yet — tap ➕ to add one."), and plain-language
errors. NEVER show raw IDs, JSON, or stack traces to the user.

Durable data (records, balances, schedules, settings) MUST use the toolkit's
persistent storage, never an in-memory `Map`. The global error boundary and the
unknown-command fallback already live in `buildBot()`/the toolkit — do not
re-add them.

Active-user telemetry (real user count for hosting billing) is AUTOMATIC — the
toolkit records salted user hashes and reports them when the platform injects
`BOT_TELEMETRY_*` at deploy. It is invisible to your code: do not add, read, or
depend on those env vars, and do not build your own user-counting.

## ⚠️ Explicit `.js` import extensions
This is an ESM (`NodeNext`) project. Relative imports MUST carry the `.js`
extension (`import { buildBot } from "./bot.js"`), even from `.ts` files — Node's
runtime requires it. A missing extension can typecheck yet crash at runtime.

## Tests
Each feature writes its OWN `tests/specs/<slug>.json` (a `BotSpec` array: steps of
`{ send, expect }`, where `expect` payloads match as a subset) AND, if it adds a
command, its OWN `tests/commands/<slug>.json` (a JSON string array, e.g.
`["/start"]`). NEVER edit a shared `tests/specs.json` / `tests/commands.json` —
concurrent PRs would conflict. The gate globs `tests/specs/*.json` +
`tests/commands/*.json`.

## Implementation contract (a stub is a FAILURE, even if it compiles)
- **No stubs:** no empty bodies, `TODO`/`FIXME`, commented-out logic, or
  `throw new Error("not implemented")`.
- **No fake data:** no `Math.random()`, hardcoded sample arrays, or canned
  responses standing in for real computed/fetched values.
- **No in-memory data store:** a `Map`/array/module-level variable used as a
  database is a defect. Durable data (anything that must survive a restart) MUST
  use the toolkit's persistent storage (Redis-backed) — not process memory. The
  `Session` type and session storage are for ephemeral conversation state only.
- **Real integrations:** call external APIs against their real contract (correct
  endpoints, ids and params — e.g. a coin *id*, not a ticker), with credentials
  from env.
