# @flyva/shared

This package must have **zero** framework dependencies — no React, no Vue, no Node-specific APIs.

## Reactive abstraction

```ts
type Reactive<T> = { value: T };
type ReactiveFactory = <V>(initialValue?: V) => Reactive<V>;
```

`PageTransitionManager` accepts a `ReactiveFactory` at construction. Each framework adapter supplies its own factory:
- React: `useRefState` (Proxy-based ref that triggers re-renders)
- Vue: Nuxt's `ref()` via `refReactiveFactory`

## PageTransition interface

Lifecycle methods are all optional. `condition` gates whether a transition runs. The rest follow the lifecycle order. `cleanup` is called after `afterEnter` and on re-run.

## Editing rules

- Keep types generic — avoid `any` where possible, use generics
- Every public type/class must be re-exported from the barrel `index.ts`
- Stable **`package.json` `exports`** subpaths (`./page-transition-manager`, `./view-transition`, `./lifecycle-classes`, `./types`) must resolve to the same public API as the root barrel for those areas — update `exports` when adding new user-facing modules
