# Flyva — Project Overview

Flyva is a library for seamless page transitions, with framework-specific adapters for Next.js and Nuxt.

## Monorepo structure (pnpm workspaces)

```
packages/shared    → @flyva/shared   (framework-agnostic core)
packages/next      → @flyva/next     (React/Next.js adapter)
packages/nuxt      → @flyva/nuxt     (Vue/Nuxt adapter)
playground/next    → playground-next (Next.js test app)
playground/nuxt    → playground-nuxt (Nuxt test app)
```

## Package dependency graph

- `@flyva/next` depends on `@flyva/shared` (workspace:*)
- `@flyva/nuxt` depends on `@flyva/shared` (workspace:*)
- Playgrounds depend on their respective package

## Core architecture

`PageTransitionManager` (shared) orchestrates the lifecycle:
`prepare → beforeLeave → leave → afterLeave → [navigate] → beforeEnter → enter → afterEnter`

Each framework adapter provides:
1. A reactive primitive that bridges the framework's reactivity (React refs / Vue refs) to the shared `Reactive<T>` interface
2. Components that wire into the framework's router (FlyvaLink, FlyvaRoot for Next; flyva-link, flyva-page for Nuxt)
3. Composables/hooks that expose the manager and transition control

## Key conventions

- Workspace deps use `"workspace:*"` protocol
- Shared manager sources: `packages/shared/page-transition-manager/`
- Root scripts: `pnpm dev:nuxt`, `pnpm dev:next` to run playgrounds
