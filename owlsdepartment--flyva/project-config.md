# Vue SFC layout

- The opening tag must be exactly `<script setup lang="ts">` (not `<script lang="ts" setup>`).
- That `<script setup lang="ts">` block is always the **first** top-level block in the file — it appears above `<template>` and any `<style>` blocks.
- For pages or layouts with no script logic yet, keep an empty `<script setup lang="ts"></script>` so order stays consistent.
