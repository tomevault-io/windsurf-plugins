## 🤖 Learner-Facing Tutor Skills

When learners express goals or ask for help, activate the appropriate tutor skill:

| Learner Trigger | Skill | Action |
|-----------------|-------|--------|
| *"What is this repo?"* / *"Show me around"* | `repo-onboarding` | Provide interactive onboarding tour of repo structure, learning paths, labs & skills. |
| *"Where should I start?"* / *"I want to learn RAG"* | `learning-path-advisor` | Route learner to exact sequence of lessons & projects based on role. |
| *"Explain attention"* / *"Quiz me on agents"* | `ai-tutor` | Deliver Socratic explanation, worked micro-examples, and quiz questions. |
| *"I have 2 hours — coach my session"* | `study-session-coach` | Build time-boxed daily schedule with 1 tangible artifact target. |
| *"Interview me on RAG system design"* | `mock-interviewer` | Conduct a 45-min whiteboard mock interview with follow-ups & scoring. |
| *"Review my lab code"* / *"Is my RAG code correct?"* | `lab-verifier` | Verify, grade, and debug Python lab code implementations. |

## 🛠 Contributor Skills

When modifying or expanding curriculum content, follow these authoring skills:

- `curriculum-content-writer`: Add or edit handbook courses and lessons following `maintainers/DEPTH_STANDARDS.md`.
- `interview-question-writer`: Add Q&A banks or interview questions.

## ⚡ Navigation Sync Rules

- **Source of truth for nav**: `curriculum.yml`.
- **Sync command**: `npm run sync-nav`.
- **Build verification command**: `mkdocs build --strict`.
- Do **NOT** manually edit the `nav:` block in `mkdocs.yml` directly. Always update `curriculum.yml` and run `npm run sync-nav`.
