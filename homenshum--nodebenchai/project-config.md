# Scenario-Based Testing

Tests that don't model real human behavior are false confidence — not test coverage.

## Core mandate

Never write simple tests. Every test must be scenario-based: start from a real user context, simulate realistic behavior, and verify system behavior under that context at scale.

> "Do not go for simple tests — they are not able to truly address how real people's behavior is going to show up during production. Tests must always be scenario-based, catered and aligned with real human behaviors in all angles. Do not go shallow — they must go thoroughly, deeply, and must consider scale. They must consider long-running and short-running."

## What "scenario-based" means

Every test must answer all six of these:

1. **Who** — Which user persona? (first-timer, power user, distracted, adversarial, mobile/slow network, concurrent session)
2. **What** — What is the user trying to achieve? (start from goal, not function signature)
3. **How** — What is the action sequence, timing, and concurrency pattern?
4. **Scale** — What happens at 1 user, 10 concurrent, 100 sustained? Single-user happy paths are necessary but not sufficient.
5. **Duration** — Short-running (burst, spike) AND long-running (sustained load, state accumulation, memory leak over time). A test that passes in 1 second but fails after 30 minutes is a production gap.
6. **Failure modes** — Edge cases, race conditions, degraded inputs, partial failures, auth expiry mid-flow, retry storms.

## Required test categories per feature

| Category | What it covers |
|---|---|
| Single user — happy path | Baseline correctness |
| Single user — all sad paths | Every error condition, invalid input, boundary value |
| Concurrent users | Race conditions, dirty reads, double-submit |
| Degraded conditions | Slow network, auth expiry, partial API failures, quota exhaustion |
| Long-running accumulation | State after 100+ sessions, memory/DB growth, stale cache eviction |
| Adversarial | Injection, unexpected payloads, replay attacks on idempotent operations |

## Scenario anatomy

Every scenario test must explicitly document:

```
Scenario: <name>
User:      <persona — first-timer / power user / adversarial / slow network / etc.>
Goal:      <what the user is trying to achieve>
Prior state: <what's already in the system before this scenario runs>
Actions:   <sequence of user actions with timing>
Scale:     <1 user / 10 concurrent / 100 sustained>
Duration:  <single request / session-length / multi-day accumulation>
Expected:  <full observable outcome — state, side effects, UI response>
Edge cases: <what happens when inputs are wrong, partial, or adversarial>
```

## Anti-patterns — banned

- Simple unit tests with no scenario context
- Tests that only cover the happy path
- Tests that mock everything and test nothing real
- Tests that pass at 1 user and are never run at 10+
- Hard-coded user state assumptions that won't hold in production
- "It passes in CI" declared without production-realistic data volume or concurrency
- Declaring a feature "tested" after a single integration test with synthetic clean data

## Red flags you're writing shallow tests

- Your test has no defined user persona
- Your test has no prior state setup — it starts with a clean DB every time
- Your test doesn't specify concurrency
- Your test duration is under 5 seconds with no long-running counterpart
- Your test passes with `mockImplementation(() => ({}))`
- Your assertions only check return values, not state changes and side effects
