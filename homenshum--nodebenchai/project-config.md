# Re-examine for 11/10

After completing any non-trivial change, do a **fresh-eyes pass** to elevate from "correct" to "exceptional."

## When to trigger
- After any feature, fix, or refactor touching 3+ files or 50+ lines
- After any UI/dashboard/component work
- Before marking a task as "done"

## The process
1. **Step back**: Stop coding. Read the output as a first-time user would.
2. **Scan each related_ domain**: Walk the `related_` list below — each is a focused checklist.
3. **Fix what you find**: Don't just note issues — fix them in the same pass.
4. **Re-examine the fixes**: New code can introduce new gaps. One more scan.

## Quick checklist (expand via related_ hops)
- [ ] Accessibility gaps? → `reexamine_a11y`
- [ ] Error resilience? → `reexamine_resilience`
- [ ] Visual polish / micro-interactions? → `reexamine_polish`
- [ ] Keyboard efficiency? → `reexamine_keyboard`
- [ ] Performance / progressive disclosure? → `reexamine_performance`

## Anti-patterns
- Skipping the re-examine because "it works"
- Re-examining only your own changes (check adjacent code too)
- Adding complexity without user benefit (re-examine is about polish, not gold-plating)
