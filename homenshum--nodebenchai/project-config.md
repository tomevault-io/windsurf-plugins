# Claude Code Swarm Orchestration

Master multi-agent orchestration using Claude Code's TeammateTool and Task system. Use when coordinating multiple agents, parallel code reviews, pipeline workflows, or self-organizing task queues.

---

## Primitives

| Primitive | What It Is | File Location |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Agent** | A Claude instance that can use tools. You are an agent. Subagents are agents you spawn. | N/A (process) |
| **Team** | A named group of agents working together. One leader, multiple teammates. | `~/.claude/teams/{name}/config.json` |
| **Teammate** | An agent that joined a team. Has a name, color, inbox. Spawned via Task with `team_name` + `name`. | Listed in team config |
| **Leader** | The agent that created the team. Receives teammate messages, approves plans/shutdowns. | First member in config |
| **Task** | A work item with subject, description, status, owner, and dependencies. | `~/.claude/tasks/{team}/N.json` |
| **Inbox** | JSON file where an agent receives messages from teammates. | `~/.claude/teams/{name}/inboxes/{agent}.json` |
| **Backend** | How teammates run. Auto-detected: `in-process` (invisible), `tmux` (visible panes), `iterm2` (split panes). | Auto-detected |

---

## Two Ways to Spawn Agents

### Method 1: Task Tool (Subagents) — short-lived, returns result
```javascript
Task({ subagent_type: "Explore", description: "Find auth files", prompt: "...", model: "haiku" })
```

### Method 2: Task + team_name + name (Teammates) — persistent, communicates via inbox
```javascript
Teammate({ operation: "spawnTeam", team_name: "my-project" })
Task({ team_name: "my-project", name: "security-reviewer", subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "...", run_in_background: true })
```

| Aspect | Task (subagent) | Task + team_name + name (teammate) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Lifespan | Until task complete | Until shutdown requested |
| Communication | Return value | Inbox messages |
| Task access | None | Shared task list |

## Built-in Agent Types

- **Bash** — command execution, git ops
- **Explore** — read-only codebase search (use `model: "haiku"` for speed)
- **Plan** — architecture + implementation plans (read-only)
- **general-purpose** — all tools, multi-step research + action

---

## TeammateTool Operations

| Operation | Who | What |
|-----------|-----|------|
| `spawnTeam` | Leader | Create team + task directory |
| `write` | Anyone | Message ONE teammate |
| `broadcast` | Anyone | Message ALL teammates (N messages — expensive, avoid) |
| `requestShutdown` | Leader | Ask teammate to exit |
| `approveShutdown` | Teammate | **MUST call** — sends confirmation, exits process |
| `cleanup` | Leader | Remove team + task files (all teammates must be shut down first) |

---

## Task System

```javascript
TaskCreate({ subject: "Step 1", description: "...", activeForm: "Working..." })
TaskList()
TaskUpdate({ taskId: "2", addBlockedBy: ["1"] })   // auto-unblocks when #1 completes
TaskUpdate({ taskId: "2", owner: "worker-1", status: "in_progress" })
TaskUpdate({ taskId: "2", status: "completed" })
```

---

## Orchestration Patterns

### Parallel Specialists
```javascript
Teammate({ operation: "spawnTeam", team_name: "pr-review" })
Task({ team_name: "pr-review", name: "security", subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "...", run_in_background: true })
Task({ team_name: "pr-review", name: "perf", subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "...", run_in_background: true })
```

### Pipeline (Sequential Dependencies)
```javascript
TaskCreate({ subject: "Research" })  // #1
TaskCreate({ subject: "Implement" }) // #2
TaskUpdate({ taskId: "2", addBlockedBy: ["1"] })
```

### Self-Organizing Swarm
Workers poll TaskList, claim unclaimed tasks, complete, repeat until no tasks remain.

---

## Shutdown Sequence (always follow)
```javascript
Teammate({ operation: "requestShutdown", target_agent_id: "worker-1" })
// wait for {"type": "shutdown_approved"} in inbox
Teammate({ operation: "cleanup" })
```
