# Agentic Systems Reliability

Every tool response must be honest, every resource bounded, every failure surfaced. Agents trust tool output literally.

## 8-Point Mandatory Checklist (run on ALL backend/infra code)

1. **BOUND** — Every in-memory collection (Map, Array, Set) has MAX + eviction on insert
2. **HONEST_STATUS** — No 2xx on failure paths. 502 for backend down, 504 for timeout, 500 for unhandled
3. **HONEST_SCORES** — No hardcoded `passed: true` or score floors. Default `false`/`0`/`"UNKNOWN"` when not evaluated
4. **TIMEOUT** — AbortController + checkBudget() gates between async stages. Return 504 on expiry
5. **SSRF** — URL validation (protocol + hostname blocklist) before every fetch with agent/user input
6. **BOUND_READ** — ReadableStream with MAX_BYTES + cancel on overflow for all external response bodies
7. **ERROR_BOUNDARY** — asyncHandler wrapper or try/catch on every async route handler
8. **DETERMINISTIC** — stableStringify (sorted keys) for all content-addressed hashing

## Why Agents Amplify Bugs
- Agents call tools in tight loops → unbounded Maps OOM in minutes not hours
- Agents parse status codes literally → fake 201 becomes false belief in reasoning chain
- Agents generate URLs from reasoning → SSRF via hallucinated internal addresses
- Inflated evidence scores → agents skip verification on bad data

## Severity
- **P0**: Crash, SSRF, false decisions from fake data → fix immediately
- **P1**: Degraded data, no crash → fix same session
- **P2**: Suboptimal but safe → fix when touched

## What to Grep For
- `new Map()` without MAX constant in same file
- `res.status(2` in catch/fallback branches
- `passed: true` with "caller should validate" comments
- `await response.text()` on external fetches
- `fetch(variable)` without URL validation
- `async (req, res) =>` without error handling
- `JSON.stringify(obj)` → `createHash` without sorted keys
