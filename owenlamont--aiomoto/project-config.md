# Coding Agent Instructions

Guidance on how to navigate and modify this codebase.

## What This Library Does

aiomoto is an installable Python package that brings Moto-style AWS service mocks to
async stacks such as aioboto3 or aiobotocore while staying compatible with classic
boto3. The focus is a clean, reusable library API rather than a CLI entry point.

## Code Change Requirements

- Whenever code is changed, ensure all pre-commit linters pass
  (`prek run --all-files`) and all pytests pass
  (`uv run pytest -n logical --color=no`). Newly added code must keep full branch
  coverage. When using sandboxed Codex tooling, request elevated permissions each
  time so the commands can access the full workspace and any required local
  services. In unrestricted environments just make sure the resources are
  reachable.
- When running ad-hoc Python (inspecting objects, small scripts, etc.), use
  `uv run python` so the project venv and pinned dependencies are active.
- Update documentation whenever behaviour or feature changes are introduced.
- Diagnose bugs before patching: avoid speculative “symptom” fixes. When behaviour is
  unclear, instrument or reproduce minimally to identify the exact cause before
  landing code changes; prefer root-cause fixes over defensive clean-ups.

## Project Structure

- **/src/aiomoto/** – Library code.
- **/tests/** – Pytest suite kept in sync with the src layout; module names mirror
  the src module they cover and use the `test_` prefix.
- **Wiki** – <https://github.com/owenlamont/aiomoto/wiki> (roadmap, etc.). Keep wiki
  pages in sync when behaviour changes.
- **.complexipy.toml** – Complexipy configuration.
- **.coveragerc** – Coverage path mappings.
- **ty.toml** – ty type checker configuration.
- **pyproject.toml** – Package configuration (distribution metadata, optional
  extras, build backend, and dependency groups).
- **prek.toml** – prek linters and configuration.
- **pytest.ini** – Pytest configuration.
- **ruff.toml** – Code style and linter configuration.
- **.rumdl.toml** – Markdown linter configuration.
- **.ryl.toml** – YAML linter configuration.
- **typos.toml** – Typos configuration.

## Code Style

- Run `prek run --all-files` after every meaningful edit so auto-fixes keep the
  working tree clean; this applies even to documentation-only edits because Markdown
  linting runs through prek.
- Stage any new files before running prek so they are included in the checks.
- Let prek auto-correct formatting issues where possible. If prek reports changes,
  rerun it to confirm a clean pass before fixing anything manually.
- Follow the [Google Python Style Guide]
  (<https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>) for all code contributions,
  including Google-style docstrings.
- Use precise type hints everywhere. Avoid `Any`, type casts, and type ignores unless
  a third-party dependency leaves no alternative.
- Do not create sub-packages inside `tests`. Test module names must be unique across
  the repo (other than `__init__.py` and `conftest.py`).
- Use the most modern Python idioms allowed by the minimum supported version
  (currently Python 3.10).
- Comments should be kept to an absolute minimum, try to achieve code readability
  through meaningful class, function, and variable names. Public functions should have
  Google-style docstrings; parameters only need to be documented if the name and type
  hint don't convey the full semantics. Private functions used within a module don't
  need docstrings (unless their names and type hints aren't sufficient to convey their
  semantics).
- Comments should only be used to explain unavoidable code smells (arising from third
  party package use), or the reason for temporary dependency version pinning (e.g.
  linking an unresolved GitHub issues) or lastly explaining opaque code or non-obvious
  trade offs or workarounds.
- Please keep all imports at the top of the module unless necessary to avoid circular
  imports
- Prefer quick research (docs or web search) to validate tools/APIs before
  trial-and-error patches; it is usually faster and reduces churn.

## Development Environment / Terminal

- The repo runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Confirm the shell environment before
  assuming POSIX semantics.
- When automation already controls the working directory, run commands directly (for
  example `prek run --all-files`) instead of prefixing them with `cd`.
- Being a uv project you never need to activate a virtual environment or call pip
  directly. Use `uv add` for dependencies and `uv run` for scripts or tooling.
- Install `complexipy`, `markitdown`, `prek`, `rg`, `ruff`, `rumdl`, `typos`, and
  `zizmor` as global uv tools so they can be invoked without `uv run`.

## Automated Tests

- Always run `uv run pytest -n logical --color=no` when fixing bugs or making
  incremental code changes.
- For new features or larger changes run
  `uv run pytest -n logical --color=no --cov=. --cov-branch --cov-report term-missing`
  and
  inspect any uncovered lines. Some conditional logic is platform- or
  version-specific, so 100% branch coverage may require CI, but treat any gaps as
  suspect until proven otherwise.
- Future integration tests may rely on AWS emulators such as DynamoDB Local on
