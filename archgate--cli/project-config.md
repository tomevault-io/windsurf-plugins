# Archgate Governance

This project uses Archgate to enforce Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## Before writing code

- Use the `review_context` MCP tool to get applicable ADR briefings for changed files
- Review the Decision and Do's/Don'ts sections of each applicable ADR

## After writing code

- Run the `check` MCP tool to validate compliance with all ADR rules
- Fix any violations before considering work complete

## ADR commands

- `list_adrs` — List all active ADRs with metadata
- `check` — Run automated compliance checks (use `staged: true` for pre-commit)
- `review_context` — Get changed files grouped by domain with ADR briefings

## Key principle

Architectural decisions are enforced, not suggested. If `check` reports violations, they must be fixed.
