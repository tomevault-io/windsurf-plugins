# General Coding Style
- use tabs for indentation
- Prefer readability, longer functions over many small ones. 
- Use Guard Clauses for Early Exit Pattern in functions.   
- Keep functions as flat as possible, minimizing indentation, with happy path clear and unindented. 
- Avoid over-engineering. 

# Focus Guidelines
- Be narrow and specific in scope, as defined in prompt, avoid adding extra features or functionality.
- Avoid handling edge cases or error cases, instead insert comments explaining what would be done. Prepend those comments with "Unhandled Case: "

# Testing and Building Guidelines
- Do not run any build, test or run commands. 


## General Typescript/Javascript Style Guidelines
- use try catch blocks only in specific code line(s) that may fail. catch should return early, keeping happy path unindented. 


- Do not run any build, test or run commands
