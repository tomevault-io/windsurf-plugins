<core_principles>
* Embrace "functional core; imperative shell" - use FP patterns (similar to OCaml/Rust) for internal implementations; keep public-facing APIs straightforward. No defunctionalized HKTs or Okasaki 1998.

* Code duplication is often better than the wrong abstraction.

* Be judicious with comments - avoid documenting the obvious, but preserve comments that explain the complex.

* Always add docstrings that includes argument types, return types and what exceptions are raised.

* Liberally use logging to allow for high observability.

* For concurrent code, following Rob Pike's go proverbs is valuable; yet complexity is the enemy. Simple locks are fine.

* Always strongly prefer errors-as-types / errors-as-return-values over try-except. Nested try-except blocks are always prohibited.

* Always prefer composition over inheritance.

* Prefer early returns and sensible defaults over if-else statements.

* Prefer match-case over if-elif-else statements.

* Strongly prefer liberal use of asserts to affirm world-view/ state is as expected. Failing early is desired.

* Always strongly prefer global import statements.

</core_principles>

<trivia>
* In logging, AVOID using f-strings. ALWAYS either do structured logging, or delegate string formatting to the logger.
</trivia>

<type_system_and_architecture>
* Use modern Python type annotations (Python 3.10+) - prefer `list[int]` over `List[int]`, etc.

* Prefer Python Literals over String Enumerations.

* Re: the algebra of types. 
   - (Semiring) products are `@dataclass` (preferably frozen)
   - Sums are `|`. 
   - Use `match` for elimination (where a simple `isinstance` won't suffice).
   - "Initial object"/bottom type is `typing.Never`.
   - Pragmatism: translate `data Foo = Bar | Baz` to either literal types or enums depending on the usage.

* Use protocols and traits (via Protocol classes or abstract base classes) to decouple and for type lambdas.
