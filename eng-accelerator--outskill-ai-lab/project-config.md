# Agentic Design Patterns – Cursor Rules

These rules guide the Cursor Agent when **designing, implementing, or refactoring AI agent projects**. They are distilled from *Agentic Design Patterns* (Antonio Gulli) and optimized for practical engineering use.

The goal is not to recreate the book, but to **enforce correct architectural decisions** when building agentic systems.

---

## 1. What Qualifies as an Agent

An AI system MUST be treated as an *agent* only if it:

- Has an explicit **goal or mission**
- Can **plan multi-step actions**
- Can **use tools / external systems**
- Maintains **state or memory across steps**
- Can **observe outcomes and adapt**

If these properties are missing, do **not** over-engineer with agent abstractions.

---

## 2. Default Agent Loop (Mandatory)

Every agent implementation MUST follow this conceptual loop:

1. **Goal intake** – clarify objective and success criteria
2. **Context gathering** – retrieve state, memory, environment signals
3. **Planning** – generate or update an execution plan
4. **Action execution** – tool calls, messages, API interactions
5. **Reflection / learning** – evaluate outcome, update memory

If the loop is implicit, document where each step occurs.

---

## 3. Prompt Chaining Pattern

Use prompt chaining when:
- Tasks require **sequential reasoning**
- Output of one step feeds the next

Rules:
- Each prompt has **one responsibility**
- Intermediate outputs MUST be structured (JSON / typed schema)
- Do not chain more than necessary; prefer 3–5 steps

Avoid:
- Monolithic prompts doing planning + execution + evaluation

---

## 4. Routing Pattern

Use routing when:
- Multiple strategies, tools, or agents are possible

Rules:
- Routing decision MUST be explicit and inspectable
- Prefer rule-based routing first, LLM-based routing second
- Log routing decisions for observability

Never:
- Hide routing logic inside a long prompt

---

## 5. Parallelization Pattern

Use parallel execution when:
- Tasks are independent
- Latency matters

Rules:
- Fan-out → work → fan-in
- Merge results deterministically
- Handle partial failures explicitly

Avoid parallelism for tasks with hidden dependencies.

---

## 6. Reflection Pattern

Reflection is mandatory for:
- Long-running agents
- Code generation agents
- Autonomous decision-making

Rules:
- Reflection evaluates output vs goal
- Reflection can revise the plan or retry actions
- Keep reflection prompts short and diagnostic

Do NOT expose internal chain-of-thought verbatim.

---

## 7. Tool Use Pattern

Agents MUST treat tools as first-class capabilities.

Rules:
- Every tool has:
  - Clear description
  - Strict input/output schema
- Validate tool outputs before reuse
- Tool failures must be recoverable

Never:
- Allow free-form tool invocation without schema

---

## 8. Planning Pattern

Planning separates *thinking* from *doing*.

Rules:
- Generate plans explicitly (steps, dependencies)
- Plans are revisable artifacts
- Execution follows the plan unless reflection intervenes

Avoid:
- Re-planning on every token unless necessary

---

## 9. Multi-Agent Pattern

Use multiple agents ONLY when:
- Roles are clearly separable
- Parallel reasoning or specialization adds value

Rules:
- Each agent has a single responsibility
- Communication contracts must be defined
- Avoid circular dependencies

Prefer fewer, stronger agents over many weak ones.

---

## 10. Memory Management Pattern

Memory is not logging.

Rules:
- Separate:
  - Short-term context (session)
  - Long-term memory (retrieval)
- Write to memory intentionally
- Read memory selectively

Avoid:
- Dumping full conversation history into context

---

## 11. Learning & Adaptation Pattern

Agents MAY adapt behavior over time.

Rules:
- Learning signals must be explicit
- Never silently change core behavior
- Version learned policies or prompts

---

## 12. Goal Setting & Monitoring

Rules:
- Goals must be measurable
- Track progress against goals
- Detect stagnation or loops

If progress stalls → trigger reflection or human review.

---

## 13. Exception Handling & Recovery

Failure is expected.

Rules:
- Categorize failures (tool, reasoning, data)
- Retry only when failure mode is understood
- Escalate to human-in-the-loop when uncertain

Never:
- Infinite retries

---

## 14. Human-in-the-Loop Pattern

Humans are collaborators, not fallbacks.

Rules:
- Define when human input is required
- Ask precise, minimal questions
- Resume agent loop after intervention

---

## 15. Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)

Use RAG when:
- Knowledge is external or dynamic

Rules:
- Retrieval before generation
- Cite sources internally
- Validate relevance before use

Avoid:
- Over-retrieving context

---

## 16. Inter-Agent Communication (A2A)

Rules:
- Messages must be structured
- Avoid free-form chat between agents
- Log all agent-to-agent exchanges

---

## 17. Resource-Aware Optimization

Rules:
- Be cost- and latency-aware
- Prefer smaller models for routing and evaluation
- Escalate to larger models only when needed

---

## 18. Reasoning Techniques

Rules:
- Use explicit reasoning steps internally
- Summarize reasoning into decisions
- Do not expose raw reasoning unless required

---

## 19. Guardrails & Safety

Rules:
