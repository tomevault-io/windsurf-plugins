# Agent Entry Point

This project is a local AI workflow app for Linux, Windows, and macOS. It should make powerful AI workflows usable by beginners: a user opens a simple dashboard, presses clear controls, and the app runs the local AI workflow in the background.

The app is desktop-first, privacy-focused, and powered first by ComfyUI. ComfyUI should be treated as the first execution engine, not as the public contract of the app.

## Core Rule

The frontend must call the app backend API. It must not call ComfyUI directly.

The backend owns the `EngineAdapter` contract and translates app workflow requests into the active engine implementation. The first adapter is `ComfyUIEngineAdapter`; future adapters may target platform-native inference paths.

## Working Guidance

When adding frontend features, preserve the backend API boundary.

When adding or changing frontend UI, follow [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) for visual direction, component behavior, interaction states, and beginner-friendly copy.

When adding engine behavior, implement it through an `EngineAdapter`.

External ComfyUI URLs are development mode only. The v1 product must use an app-managed, isolated ComfyUI sidecar so users do not manually launch ComfyUI or install its Python dependencies.

Community workflows from the internet are a first-class product direction. When adding community workflow behavior, follow the accepted runtime isolation architecture: install custom nodes and Python dependencies only into isolated dependency environments and runner workspaces, never into the trusted core runtime.

The trusted backend process must never import community custom node modules or execute custom node setup code. Custom node imports, compatibility checks, and smoke tests must happen only inside isolated runner processes.

Unverified community workflows may be prepared automatically only when Noofy can resolve them into isolated workflow capsules. Noofy protects the app from dependency conflicts and broken installs, but it must not claim arbitrary community Python code is safe or trustworthy.

Workflow model validation must use the active `EngineAdapter`. Do not validate required models by reading a hardcoded local ComfyUI source `models` folder.

When adding backend behavior, add structured diagnostics for success, failure, and important state transitions so the UI and future agents can understand what happened.
