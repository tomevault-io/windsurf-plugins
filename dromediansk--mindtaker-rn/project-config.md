- **Category Organization** - Ideas organized by predefined categories (General, Personal, Business, Health)
- **Date-based Filtering** - Calendar integration for viewing ideas by date
- **CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, and delete ideas

### 3. Calendar Interface

### 5. User Interface

- **Tab Navigation** - Clean two-tab interface (Home, Profile)
- **Modal Screens** - Stack navigation for idea creation/editing
- **Safe Area Support** - Proper handling of device notches and status bars
- **Pull-to-Refresh** - Refresh data with swipe gesture
- **Loading States** - Smooth loading indicators and skeletons

## Development Guidelines

### File Structure

```
app/
├── _layout.tsx              # Root layout with auth handling
├── auth.tsx                 # Authentication screen
├── (tabs)/                  # Tab navigation group
│   ├── _layout.tsx         # Tabs layout configuration
│   ├── (home)/             # Home tab group
│   │   └── index.tsx       # Ideas list with calendar
│   ├── profile.tsx         # User profile screen
│   └── ideas/              # Ideas stack (modals)
│       ├── new.tsx         # Create new idea
│       └── [id].tsx        # Edit existing idea
```

### Key Patterns

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code with proper type definitions
- Follow **Expo Router** conventions for navigation
- Implement **Zustand stores** for global state management
- Use **NativeWind classes** for styling with Tailwind CSS syntax
- Handle **loading states** and **error boundaries** appropriately
- Implement **Safe Area** handling for all screens

### Database Schema

- **Users** - User profiles and authentication data
- **Categories** - Predefined idea categories with enum types
- **Ideas** - User thoughts with content, category, and timestamp

### Environment Variables

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your_google_web_client_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=your_google_ios_client_id
```

## Code Quality Standards

- Maintain **consistent naming conventions**
- Implement **proper error handling** with user-friendly messages
- Use **React best practices** (hooks, memoization, proper dependencies)
- Follow **accessibility guidelines** for mobile apps
- Write **self-documenting code** with clear variable and function names
- Handle **edge cases** and loading states gracefully

## Common Tasks

- Adding new idea categories requires updating the `CategoryEnumType` enum
- New screens should follow the established navigation patterns
- API calls should include proper error handling and loading states
- UI components should be responsive and follow the design system
- Always test authentication flows and session management
