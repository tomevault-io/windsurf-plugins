# FrontAgent OSS Harness

## Documents

1. `README.md` is the public product and command overview.
2. `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/design.md` define architecture and SDD behavior.
3. `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, and `docs/knowledge-contract.md` define OSS contribution, Harness, and GitNexus contract rules.
4. Issue or PR text defines the specific change request.
5. Existing code is evidence, but it does not override the documents above.

When documents conflict or expected behavior is unclear, ask the maintainer instead of silently choosing a new architecture.

## Work

1. Run `pnpm agent:bootstrap` and `pnpm quality:predev` before code changes when feasible.
2. Before editing a function, class, or method, run GitNexus impact analysis and report the blast radius.
3. Keep changes focused and independently reviewable.
4. Run focused tests for the touched area, then broader gates as risk increases.
5. Before final review, run `pnpm quality:precommit` at minimum and use GitNexus `detect_changes` to inspect the final diff.
6. For critical skeleton changes, fill the PR GitNexus impact summary with concrete `detect_changes` plus `query`, `context`, or `impact` results.

## Harness Loop

For non-trivial repository changes, use this loop:

1. Start from an Issue, Discussion, or maintainer-approved task description.
2. Create a short-lived branch from `develop` using `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, or `chore/`.
3. Run `pnpm agent:bootstrap` and `pnpm quality:predev`.
4. Implement the smallest reviewable change with focused tests.
5. Run `pnpm quality:local` before pushing when feasible.
6. Open a PR to `develop` with the PR template filled in, including the GitNexus impact summary for critical skeleton changes.
7. Wait for GitHub Actions, Contract Guard, Repo Guard, Codex, Copilot, and maintainer review comments.
8. Address actionable review comments with follow-up commits, then rerun the relevant gates.
9. Let maintainers decide merge readiness; do not add comment-triggered auto-merge behavior.

## OSS Scope

FrontAgent uses an open-source maintainer workflow. Do not add training-camp claim comments, score labels, progress ledgers, timeout-close automation, or comment-triggered auto-merge rules unless maintainers explicitly request a separate workflow.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **FrontAgent** (6641 symbols, 13666 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
