# Core Coding Principles

## 1. Async-First Development

- **ALWAYS** use `async def` for functions that perform I/O operations
- Use `await` for API calls, database queries, file operations, HTTP requests
- Leverage `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent operations
- Use `async with` for context managers (UniFi client, Redis connections)
- **NEVER** use blocking synchronous calls in async contexts
- Consider using `anyio.to_thread.run_sync()` for CPU-intensive operations

## 2. Type Safety and Validation

- **ALWAYS** provide type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use Pydantic models for complex input/output structures
- Prefer explicit types over `Any` or untyped dicts
- Use `Optional[T]` or `T | None` for nullable values
- Leverage Pydantic's validation features (Field, validator decorators)
- Run mypy before committing changes

## 3. Security-First Design

- **CRITICAL**: All mutating operations MUST require `confirm=True` parameter
- Implement `dry_run=True` mode for preview-before-apply
- Log all operations to `audit.log` with context (user, timestamp, parameters)
- Use password masking utilities for sensitive data in logs
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow least-privilege principle for API access
- Never commit API keys, passwords, or secrets to version control

## 4. Comprehensive Testing

- Write tests FIRST for new features (TDD approach)
- Target 80%+ code coverage for all new code
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Mock external dependencies (UniFi API, Redis) in unit tests
- Mark integration tests with `@pytest.mark.integration`
- Test edge cases, error conditions, and validation failures
- **NEVER** commit code that breaks existing tests

## 5. Documentation Standards

- Write clear, comprehensive docstrings for all public functions
- Use Google-style docstring format
- Include Args, Returns, Raises sections
- Provide usage examples in docstrings for complex tools
- Update API.md when adding new tools or changing signatures
- Keep README.md current with project capabilities
