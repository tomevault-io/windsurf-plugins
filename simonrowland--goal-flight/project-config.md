# Agent Notes

> **Goal Flight is installed in this repo.** Check active state FIRST with
> `python3 scripts/goalflight_session_status.py --text` — definitive verdict.
> If **active**, follow the Goal Flight load order below. If **no active
> session**, do NOT auto-load the skill end-to-end — only when the user
> invokes `/goal-flight <command>`. Reading repository `SKILL.md`
> end-to-end is the load-order step that follows; do not skip it.

## Companion tools (defined for non-Claude orchestrators loading this file)

- **gstack** — Garry Tan's skill pack (`/review`, `/challenge`, `/office-hours`,
  `/plan-eng-review`, `/cso`, `/investigate`, etc.). Installs at
  `~/.gstack/repos/gstack/.agents/skills/` and is registered per-host
  (Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/`; Codex: `~/.codex/skills/`; Cursor:
  `~/.cursor/skills/`). Goal Flight invokes `gstack /review` as the canonical
  chunk-level pre-commit reviewer and `gstack /challenge` for adversarial
  framing. When gstack is absent, fall back to the bundled prompt skeletons at
  `prompts/gstack-claude-review.md` and `prompts/gstack-codex-challenge.md` —
  do **not** hand-roll a custom review prompt.
- **context-mode** — MCP plugin that offloads large command outputs
  (diffs, integration test runs, codex tail files, large greps) to an FTS5
  sandbox queried by pattern. Lets the orchestrator analyze big artifacts
  without consuming its own context window. Installs per-host (Claude Code:
  `~/.claude/plugins/cache/context-mode/...`; Codex: registered via
  `scripts/register-context-mode-codex.py`).

## Goal Flight Routing

- When a user invokes `goal-flight` or asks for durable planning, dispatch,
  review flights, worker orchestration, recovery, resume notes, or long-running
  repository work, load the Goal Flight skill wrapper first.
- Codex plugin skill path:
  `~/.codex/plugins/cache/goal-flight/goal-flight/<version>/skills/goal-flight/SKILL.md`.
- Repository canonical workflow path: `SKILL.md`.
- Load order: this agent instruction file, then the installed host wrapper when
  available, then repository `SKILL.md`, then only the `commands/*.md` and
  `protocols/*.md` files referenced by the invoked command.
- **Remote / multi-node workers (fleet).** To dispatch a worker on another machine
  over SSH — including a remote **Claude** worker via `claude-acp` — see
  `docs/fleet.md`: node registration, the per-worker install/auth recipe, and
  `goalflight_fleet.py dispatch`. Remote Claude needs a headless subscription token
  on the node (`claude setup-token` → `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` in the node env,
  ferried to the detached worker); full recipe: docs/fleet.md "Remote Claude worker
  (claude-acp) end-to-end". Local Claude worker surfaces (loop / one-shot):
  `protocols/dispatch-routing.md` "Claude worker surfaces".
- For tests of orchestrator generalization, use a nondestructive task: run doctor,
  make a compact plan, check capacity, launch one read-only worker, and summarize
  status/ledger evidence without writing to the repository.
- During an active goal-flight run, keep advancing the queue and accumulating
  commits per chunk until decomposition/execute is done; do not stall on
  engagement prompts. See repository root `SKILL.md` §Autonomous throughput.
- **Active run + compaction:** if goal-flight was already in play (verdict
  active per `goalflight_session_status.py --text`, OR open queue/ledger,
  OR `docs-private/RESUME-NOTES-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`), run `/goal-flight resume`
  (load order above; fresh disk read of `SKILL.md`, not compacted snapshot),
  then continue **in-skill**: dispatch workers, review before commit, one
  explicit-pathspec commit per chunk. Do **not** fall back to default assistant
  mode: inline edits, abandoning current task on new ask, or hand-rolled review.
  Canonical sequence: `SKILL.md` §State → `commands/resume.md` →
  `protocols/state-handoff.md`.

## Git workflow (this repo)

- **Commit as work completes** — one logical chunk at a time after focused tests
  **and at least one independent review** (`protocols/chunk-review.md`; default
  gstack `/review`, with `./scripts/autoreview.sh` as a complementary parallel
  option). Executor self-review alone is not enough.
- Do not wait for a separate "please commit" unless the user forbade commits.
- **`git commit -m '...' -- <files>` with explicit pathspecs** while other
  goal-flight workers are in flight. Never bare `git commit` — the commit
  guard (`scripts/goalflight_commit_guard.py`) refuses to prevent bundling
  worker WIP. See its error message for the fix shape.
- **Do not push to public** without the relevant test sweep and explicit user
  permission.
- Amending, force-push, and destructive git operations still require explicit
  user request.

## Git-Visible Trigger Hygiene

- Never put the known billing-trigger harness codenames from this thread in
  git-visible metadata: filenames, directories, branch names, tag names, commit
  messages, generated JSON manifest names, or installer output paths.
- Do not repeat those exact codenames in agent instruction files loaded by local
  coding tools.
- Installer aliases must not become manifest filenames. If an installer command
  receives `--agent=<trigger-codename>`, map that alias to a neutral manifest
