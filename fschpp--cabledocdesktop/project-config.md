## Progress Tracking Protocols

Maintain a `PROGRESS.md` file in the root directory to track long-running or multi-step tasks. 

### Rules for Updating PROGRESS.md
- **When to update:** Update this file immediately after completing a major milestone, changing task direction, or when preparing to clear session context.
- **State preservation:** Never delete the history of completed tasks; move them to the "Completed" section.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure timestamps, branch names, and error logs match the exact current state of the workspace.

### Core Structure Required
1. **Current Focus:** A 1-2 sentence description of the immediate objective.
2. **Todo List:** A markdown checkbox list categorized by `[ ] Todo`, `[/] In Progress`, and `[x] Done`.
3. **Latest Blockers/Discoveries:** Any unexpected technical hurdles, architecture decisions, or critical command outputs.
Use code with caution.
