# GitHub Issue Formatting Best Practices

When creating or editing GitHub issues via CLI using `gh issue create` or `gh issue edit`, follow these formatting guidelines to ensure professional, readable issues:

## Issue Structure Template

Every GitHub issue should follow this structure:

```markdown
## Problem
Clear, concise description of the current issue or limitation.

## Proposed Solution
Detailed explanation of what you want to implement or change.

### Implementation Details
- Specific technical requirements
- File locations that need changes
- Architecture considerations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable requirements using checkboxes
- [ ] Clear success metrics
- [ ] Edge cases to consider

## Benefits
- Clear value proposition
- Impact on users/developers
- Long-term advantages
```

## CLI Best Practices

### Use Body Files for Complex Issues
- **NEVER** include newlines in command line arguments
- Create temporary files for issue bodies: `/tmp/issue_body.md`
- Use `--body-file` flag instead of `--body` for multi-line content

```bash
# ✅ Correct approach
gh issue create --title "Feature Title" --body-file /tmp/issue_body.md --label enhancement

# ❌ Wrong approach - will fail
gh issue create --title "Title" --body "Line 1
Line 2"
```

### Markdown Formatting Rules
- Use clean markdown without raw syntax or excessive escaping
- Structure with proper headings (`##`, `###`)
- Use bulleted lists with `-` for readability
- Include checkboxes for actionable items: `- [ ]`
- Code references use backticks: `` `function_name` ``
- File paths use backticks: `` `path/to/file.py` ``

### Content Guidelines
- **Be specific**: Include exact file paths, function names, and technical details
- **Use sections**: Break content into logical sections with headings
- **Include context**: Explain current behavior vs desired behavior
- **Add examples**: Show before/after code snippets when relevant
- **List benefits**: Explain why this change matters

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Formatting Errors
- ❌ Wall of text without structure
- ❌ Raw markdown syntax that doesn't render
- ❌ Missing headings and sections
- ❌ Inline commands with newlines

### Content Issues
- ❌ Vague descriptions without specifics
- ❌ Missing implementation details
- ❌ No acceptance criteria
- ❌ Unclear benefits or value proposition

## Label Strategy
- Use `enhancement` for new features
- Use `bug` for defects
- Use project-specific labels when available
- Check available labels first: `gh label list`

## Example Commands

```bash
# Create issue with proper formatting
echo "Content here..." > /tmp/issue_body.md
gh issue create --title "Clear, Descriptive Title" --body-file /tmp/issue_body.md --label enhancement

# Edit existing issue
echo "Updated content..." > /tmp/updated_body.md
gh issue edit 123 --body-file /tmp/updated_body.md

# Clean up temp files
rm /tmp/issue_body.md
```

Remember: Well-formatted issues get faster responses and better collaboration!
