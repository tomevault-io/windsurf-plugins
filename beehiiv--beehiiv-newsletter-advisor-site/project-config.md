# Project Instructions for Claude

## Adding New Products

When the user provides a URL to add as a new product:

1. **ALWAYS fetch the URL immediately** - never ask for details, just fetch and extract (title, description, author)

2. **Add entry to `src/data.ts`** with this format:
```typescript
{
  id: 'url-friendly-slug',        // lowercase, hyphens, based on title
  title: 'Product Title',
  category: 'Digital Products',   // always use this
  description: 'Brief description of the product.',
  author: 'Creator/Author Name',
  url: 'https://the-provided-url.com',
  tags: ['Relevant', 'Tags'],     // pick from existing or add new
  date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',             // use current date
},
```

3. **Tags** should be relevant to the product type (e.g., Newsletter, Playbook, Ebook, Course, Template, Founders, etc.)

4. **The product will automatically**:
   - Appear on home page and browse page
   - Have its own detail page at `/products/{id}`
   - Show iframe preview (scaled like thumbnail)
   - Have clickable tags that filter browse page
   - Have clickable author linking to author page
