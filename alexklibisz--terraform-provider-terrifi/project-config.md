# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Terrifi is a Terraform provider for managing Ubiquiti UniFi network infrastructure, built from scratch using the HashiCorp Terraform Plugin Framework (not the legacy SDK). It uses the [go-unifi](https://github.com/ubiquiti-community/go-unifi) SDK under the hood.

## Commands

This project uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) (not Make) as the build runner. Read `Taskfile.yml` for all available tasks.

Run a single test:
```sh
task test:unit -- -run TestDNSRecordModelToAPI
task test:acc -- -run TestAccDNSRecord_basic
```

The `-- -run <pattern>` syntax passes `-run` through to `go test` via `{{.CLI_ARGS}}`.

## Architecture

### Provider Structure

All provider code lives in `internal/provider/`. Each resource follows the Terraform Plugin Framework pattern:

1. **Model struct** (e.g., `dnsRecordModel`) — Go struct with `tfsdk:` tags mapping HCL attributes
2. **CRUD methods** — `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`, `ImportState`
3. **Model-to-API conversion** — Functions converting between Terraform model types (`types.String`, `types.Bool`) and go-unifi API structs
4. **Schema** — Declares HCL attributes with validators, defaults, and plan modifiers

### Key Patterns

- **Null-aware field handling**: Terraform wrapper types (`types.String`, `types.Bool`, `types.Int64`) distinguish null/unknown/set. Optional fields use pointer types in go-unifi structs. Zero values are treated as null to avoid spurious diffs.
- **Full object updates via `applyPlanToState()`**: The UniFi API requires sending complete objects on PUT. Each resource has an `applyPlanToState()` method that merges the user's planned changes into the current state before sending, preventing accidental clearing of API-set fields.
- **Site fallback**: Resources have an optional `site` attribute that falls back to the provider's default site via `Client.SiteOrDefault()`.
- **Configuration cascading**: HCL attributes → environment variables (`UNIFI_API`, `UNIFI_USERNAME`, `UNIFI_PASSWORD`, `UNIFI_API_KEY`, `UNIFI_INSECURE`, `UNIFI_SITE`) → defaults.
- **Compile-time interface checks**: `var _ resource.Resource = &dnsRecordResource{}` pattern at the top of each resource file.

### Testing

Tests are in the same package (`internal/provider/`), controlled by `TestMain`:
- **Unit tests** (no `TF_ACC`): Test model-to-API conversions and field mappings. Use `testify/assert` and `testify/require`.
- **Acceptance tests** (`TF_ACC=1`): Full Terraform lifecycle tests using `helper/resource.Test()`. Prefixed with `TestAcc`. Two modes:
  - `TERRIFI_ACC_TARGET=docker` (default): Spins up UniFi controller via Docker Compose with testcontainers-go
  - `TERRIFI_ACC_TARGET=hardware`: Uses real hardware configured via `.envrc.local`
- **Test helpers** in `provider_test.go`: `preCheck()` validates env vars, `randomSuffix()` generates unique resource names to avoid conflicts from leftover resources.

Each new feature should include extensive acceptance testing.
Think of interesting permutations of settings and sequences of changes.
Too much testing is better than too little - don't hold back.

### go-unifi SDK Workarounds

The go-unifi SDK has several bugs that require workarounds in this provider. All workarounds are tagged with `TODO(go-unifi)` comments so they can be found and removed when the SDK is fixed.

**Conventions for SDK workarounds:**
- Tag every workaround site with a `// TODO(go-unifi):` comment explaining the upstream bug, the symptom, and what SDK fix would allow removing the workaround.
- When possible, isolate workarounds into named helper functions (e.g., `applySDKSettingPreferenceWorkaround`) so they can be deleted as a unit.
- When the SDK lacks working methods for an API (e.g., v2 firewall zones), put all custom HTTP logic in a dedicated `*_api.go` file (e.g., `firewall_zone_api.go`) with a file-level TODO explaining which SDK methods it replaces.
- Never patch the SDK in the module cache. All workarounds live in this repo.

**Current workarounds (search `TODO(go-unifi)` for details):**
- `firewall_zone_api.go` — Bypasses SDK's firewall zone CRUD entirely due to three bugs: `default_zone` serialization (400), missing `_id` in PUT body (500), and DELETE returning 204 treated as error.
- `firewall_policy_api.go` — Custom HTTP methods for v2 firewall policy endpoints not supported by the SDK.
- `client_device_api.go` — Custom HTTP methods for v2 client device endpoints not supported by the SDK.
- `network_resource.go` — `applySDKSettingPreferenceWorkaround()` forces `setting_preference=manual` because the SDK defaults to `auto`, which causes the controller to auto-override settings like DHCP enable.
- `network_resource.go` — `IsUnknown()` guards on DHCP fields in `modelToAPI` prevent passing empty strings to the SDK, which would crash the controller via `marshalCorporate()`'s `valueOrDefault()` defaults.

### CLI and Import Generation

The `cmd/terrifi/` directory contains a Cobra-based CLI. Its main command is `generate-imports`, which connects to a live UniFi controller and outputs Terraform `import {}` + `resource {}` blocks to stdout.
