# E2E extension autofill testing (MCP)

In this project, **e2e extension autofill testing** is not Playwright batch runs or JSDOM fill-verify alone. It means **driving the real extension on a live logged-in Chrome tab via the extension bridge MCP**, taking every action the extension would normally take, and **reviewing the outcome of each action before moving on**.

Goal: the extension must work **on its own** (Auto Apply, Draft All, autofill) without an agent babysitting it.

## What to mirror manually

Walk the full apply path the orchestrator would:

1. Open or navigate to a real apply page (`list_tabs`, `set_active_tab`, `navigate_tab`).
2. Read what the extension sees (`get_field_inventory`, `get_page_html`, platform `*_tab_message` when relevant).
3. Fill fields (`apply_answer`, `start_draft_all`) and advance steps (`click_control`, `click_ref`, `wait_for_tab`).
4. For job-board Auto Apply, use `start_auto_apply` / `auto_apply_status` only after single-job autofill is solid.

Do **not** skip steps or bulk-advance without checking intermediate state.

## Verify after every action

Before the next click or fill, confirm:

| Check | MCP / signal |
| --- | --- |
| Field inventory complete | `get_field_inventory` - every visible question has a ref, sensible type/label |
| Values landed in DOM | `read_field_values` - matches intended answers |
| No blocking validation | `read_form_validation` |
| HTML matches expectations | `get_page_html` when inventory looks wrong (iframes, shadow DOM, hidden radios, pill buttons) |
| ATS score makes sense | `auto_apply_status` log / assist sidebar - score vs JD and profile; skip logic reasonable when fit gate on |
| Drafted answers make sense | Re-read filled values; answers match question intent, not generic filler |
| Clarifying questions make sense | Extension should ask only when genuinely ambiguous; answers should be actionable |
| Unusual popups handled | Cookie banners, SSO nags, "already applied", location pickers, modal overlays - dismiss or route correctly via `click_control` / platform messages; note anything that needed hand-holding |

If anything fails, **stop and fix** before continuing the flow.

## Close the loop: corpus + code

Every strange DOM shape, popup, or failure mode discovered live must leave the codebase stronger:

1. **Capture** - `save_fixture` (or manual HTML into `tests/fixtures/form-extraction/html/`), register in manifest, run `propose-expectations.mjs`.
2. **Fix** - `form-heuristics.js`, `field-inventory.js`, platform `*-auto-apply.js`, or mock answers as needed.
3. **Prove** - targeted fill-verify on the new fixture (`run-fill-verify-curated.mjs --id=...`), then `npm run extension:build-reload` and re-run the same live MCP steps until clean.
4. **Autonomy check** - re-run `start_draft_all` or `start_auto_apply` **without** per-field MCP nudges; extension alone should pass.

## Do not

- Treat `npm run form-corpus:extension-e2e` as a substitute for live MCP e2e when debugging new boards or popups.
- Ship heuristics fixes from fixture HTML alone without at least one live `read_field_values` snapshot on the same pattern.
- Leave one-off MCP workarounds in place - encode the fix so the next run needs no agent.
