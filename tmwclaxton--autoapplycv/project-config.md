description: Run format, lint, and Pint before committing; same checks before push

# Pre-commit quality checks

Before creating a git commit - or before finishing a task that changed JS, Vue, or PHP - run these checks and fix failures:

```bash
npm run format:check    # if it fails: npm run format
npm run em-dash:check   # if it fails: npm run em-dash:fix
npm run lint:check:ci   # if it fails: rm -rf resources/js/routes resources/js/actions && npm run lint -- --fix && php artisan wayfinder:generate --with-form
```

For PHP changes, also run:

```bash
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent
```

Only commit when all applicable checks pass. If you auto-fixed issues, mention what was fixed in the commit message or summary.

## ESLint and Wayfinder (matches GitHub)

GitHub Actions runs `npm run lint:check` on a fresh checkout **without** gitignored Wayfinder output (`resources/js/routes`, `resources/js/actions`). When those folders exist locally, ESLint resolves `@/routes` / `@/actions` differently and `import/order` can pass locally while CI fails.

Always verify lint with **`npm run lint:check:ci`**, which removes those dirs, runs `lint:check`, then runs `php artisan wayfinder:generate --with-form` to restore them (including `.form()` helpers used by Inertia `<Form>` pages).

Manual equivalent:

```bash
rm -rf resources/js/routes resources/js/actions
npm run lint:check
php artisan wayfinder:generate --with-form
```

Do not rely on `npm run lint:check` alone before push if Wayfinder output is present.

## Before push

Do not push to the remote until the same checks pass locally with exit code 0 (matches the GitHub linter/quality workflow):

```bash
npm run lint:check:ci
npm run format:check
npm run em-dash:check
```

If any check fails, fix it (e.g. `npm run lint`, `npm run format`, `npm run em-dash:fix`) and re-run all three until they pass.

## Git hook (optional)

To run the same checks as CI before every commit:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
```

The hook runs `npm run pre-commit:check`, which inspects staged files and runs:

- `npm run em-dash:check` when staged `.php`, `.js`, `.vue`, `.md`, or `.mdc` files change
- `npm run format:check` and `npm run lint:check:ci` when staged frontend files change (includes ESLint import order without local Wayfinder output)
- `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --test` when staged `.php` files change

Run the hook checks manually anytime:

```bash
npm run pre-commit:check
```
