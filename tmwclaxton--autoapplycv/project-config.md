# Minimal test runs

During iterative development, run the **smallest test set that proves the change**. Do not run full suites after every edit.

## Default

- Run **one** targeted test file, script, or filter for the code you changed.
- Re-run only that same narrow scope when fixing follow-up issues.
- Skip unrelated tiers (smoke, curated, full PHPUnit, full form corpus) unless the change touches them.

## When to run broader checks

- **Before commit or push**: use the checks in `pre-commit-quality.mdc`.
- **When the user asks** for a full suite or CI-equivalent run.
- **When a cross-cutting change** genuinely affects many areas (e.g. shared form-heurics used by all fixtures).

## Examples

```bash
# Extension / Indeed contact change
node scripts/extension-test/indeed-apply-contact.mjs

# Single PHPUnit test or filter
php artisan test --compact --filter=test_platform_smoke_playwright_passes

# One fixture script, not the whole corpus
node scripts/extension-test/indeed-apply-questions.mjs
```

## Avoid during iteration

```bash
# ❌ Too broad for a small fix
php artisan test --compact
npm run form-corpus:fill-verify:smoke   # unless form-heuristics / field-inventory changed
npm run form-corpus:fill-verify:curated # unless curated manifest or many fixtures changed
```

If unsure, prefer a **single file or filter**. Mention what was not run and offer a broader run before merge if needed.

## Form corpus batches

Form corpus fill-verify **never runs on PR** (manual `Tests (heavy)` only). When running corpus jobs locally or via `tests-corpus-batch.yml`:

- **Max 50 scenarios per command** - no long-running full-prefix runs during iteration.
- Review the batch report JSON before starting the next 50.
- Use `--limit=50` on generate, scrape, vet, and fill-verify scripts.
