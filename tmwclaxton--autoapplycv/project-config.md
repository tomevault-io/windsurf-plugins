description: When increasing test coverage for forms, field inventory, Draft All, autofill, or the form corpus - grow the ever-growing fixture corpus via curated dual-oracle capture, not only unit tests
---


# Form corpus growth (test coverage)

When the user asks to **increase test coverage**, **add tests**, **improve coverage**, or **strengthen regression** for application forms, question detection, field inventory, Draft All, or extension autofill, read and follow:

**[`docs/form-corpus-growth.md`](../../docs/form-corpus-growth.md)**

## Default stance

- The **form corpus** (`tests/fixtures/form-extraction/`) is the primary spec for question detection and fill behaviour.
- Prefer **curated dual-oracle captures** (detector vs NanoGPT on live apply HTML) over unattended detector-gated bridge scrape when improving detection.
- Use **extension bridge MCP** to navigate boards (Ashby: board -> job -> Apply) before freezing fixtures.
- **Disagree loop (default, do not wait to be asked):** treat `ai_only` as the primary backlog (detector miss). Fix heuristics/inventory, rebuild/reload extension, re-run `form-corpus:curated-oracle --limit=1` on the same page until agree or `ai_only` is empty/false-positive. Then move to the next apply form. Do not stop after reporting disagree and ask whether to fix.
- `detector_only` is secondary (often AI HTML truncation); raise excerpt budget / re-oracle before treating as a detector bug.
- **Do not** leave long-running `form-corpus:bridge-scrape` / bulk jobs unattended for detector-quality work - that path uses the detector as an accept gate and skips the misses you need.
- **Form corpus fill-verify never runs on PR** - only manual `Tests (heavy)` workflow or local batch commands. See [`docs/form-corpus-growth.md`](../../docs/form-corpus-growth.md).
- **Batches of 50 max** for generate/scrape/vet/fill; curated oracle default **`--limit=5`**. Never auto-chain batches in one invocation.

## What to add

| Situation | Coverage to add |
| --- | --- |
| New or broken DOM pattern | Curated oracle (`form-corpus:curated-oracle`) -> on `ai_only` fix heuristics immediately -> re-oracle until agree -> next form; then targeted `run-fill-verify-curated.mjs --id=...` |
| Important / common pattern | Promote in curated or smoke manifest (`npm run form-corpus:build-curated`) |
| Pure logic (pipeline, parsers) | Small node/PHPUnit tests (see `DraftAllExtensionTest`, `draft-all-pipeline.test.mjs`) |
| Heuristic change in `form-heuristics.js` / `field-inventory.js` | `npm run form-corpus:fill-verify:smoke` minimum before merge |

## What not to do

- Do not satisfy "more coverage" with trivial tests that duplicate corpus behaviour.
- Do not grow detection fixtures via Track A accept gate alone (`>=2` inventory fields) - use dual-oracle agree/disagree.
- Do not vet Firecrawl HTML without a bridge spot-check when the page is interactive or auth-gated.
- Do not run full extension E2E batch for every small change - use `--id=` and smoke tier (`minimal-test-runs.mdc`).

## Quick commands

```bash
npm run extension-bridge
npm run extension:build-reload
npm run form-corpus:curated-oracle -- --limit=5
node scripts/form-corpus/propose-expectations.mjs --id=<fixture-id>
node scripts/form-corpus/vet-corpus.mjs --id=<fixture-id>
node scripts/form-corpus/run-fill-verify-curated.mjs --id=<fixture-id> --check-validity --check-a11y --check-errors
npm run form-corpus:fill-verify:smoke
npm run form-corpus:generate-ai -- --limit=50 --start-id=syn-ai-0001
npm run form-corpus:report-variety-matrix
```
