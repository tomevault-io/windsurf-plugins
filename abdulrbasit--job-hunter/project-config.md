# Job Hunter

This is the agent context source of truth for the product repo. CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, and any other per-agent files defer here. Keep durable operating context in this file, skills, config, or code; do not add separate architecture docs.

This repo combines the Python engine (`job_hunter/`) and the agent skill layer (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`).

## Execution Modes

| Mode | What runs | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | Agent skills handle scoring, tailoring, cover letters. Python prepares context. | Default interactive review. |
| `llm-api` | Full autonomous pipeline; LLM APIs called directly inside Python. | Unattended runs and GitHub Actions. |

Set `mode:` in `config/job_hunter.yml`.

## Repo Map

- `job_hunter/`: Python package, CLI, pipeline, source adapters, LLM API mode.
- `.claude/skills/`: skills for Claude Code and Gemini CLI (GEMINI.md delegates here).
- `config/job_hunter.yml`: user-editable machine config.
- `config/schemas/job_hunter.schema.json`: schema for `job_hunter.yml`.
- `job_hunter/templates/workspace/profile/`: canonical starter profile and resume templates.
- `examples/profile/`: filled fictional examples; not a template source.
- `outputs/state/discovered_urls.yml`: URL-only dedup state.

## Skills

```text
/job-hunter          job search command center (brief, batch, one, search, finalize,
                     tailor, score, research, interview, outreach, stories, linkedin)
/linkedin            LinkedIn content center (ideas, draft, engage, network)
/setup               workspace setup center (onboard, doctor, region, style, stories)
```

Developer contributor context:

```text
/commit              preflight checks, safe staging, and commit format
```

Use `/commit` before developer commits. It still requires full preflight:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q --tb=short
python -m ruff format --check job_hunter tests .github/scripts
python -m ruff check job_hunter tests .github/scripts
ty check job_hunter tests
```

## Common Commands

```bash
job-hunter hunt --region primary
job-hunter brief
job-hunter doctor

uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest tests/ -q --tb=short
uv run ruff format --check job_hunter tests .github/scripts
uv run ruff check job_hunter tests .github/scripts
uv run ty check job_hunter tests
```

## Rules

- **Never bump the version (`pyproject.toml`) or publish to PyPI** (trigger `release.yml`, `gh workflow run release.yml`, `uv publish`, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks. Push commits freely; do not release as a follow-on step.

## Config And State

Machine config lives in `config/job_hunter.yml`. Only deterministic choices
belong there: profile paths, job titles, regions, exclusions, scoring thresholds,
LLM search gate, mode, and provider/model settings.

Product defaults, source lists, ATS platforms, stale/listing filters, prompt
internals, and fixed secret env-var names live in code.

Human career and writing guidance lives in `profile/career_context.md`: about-me
notes, targeting, resume style, cover-letter style, LinkedIn positioning,
outreach tone, and calibration.

`outputs/state/discovered_urls.yml` is URL-only dedup. Same company with a
different URL is never blocked.

## LLM API Mode

Token compression via headroom runs automatically in `llm-api` mode through
`job_hunter/llm/client.py`. Keep `max_tokens` in config because it still controls
the model output budget.
