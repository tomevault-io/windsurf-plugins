# Testing

- Use descriptive test names
- Write unit tests for usecases, tested against in memory repositories
- We call test for adapters implementions, integration tests (for example, tests that would test a Postgres adapter of a repository). They should focus on the adapter in isolation.
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern (but do not comment those steps)
- Do not use mocks, use explicit dependency injection
- Test edge cases
