Never commit unless explicitly told

# Performance first, always

Every change is a performance decision. When two implementations are
equally correct, take the one that does less work — fewer allocations,
fewer encodes, fewer copies, fewer wakes, fewer frames. Say so in the
comment when the cheaper shape is non-obvious, so the next person
doesn't "simplify" it back.

But **a performance claim is a measurement, not an argument.** The rules
below all exist because they were broken here and cost real time.

## Never claim a number you did not measure properly

- **No perf claim from a debug build.** Debug Flutter and the iOS
  simulator are for correctness and interaction, never for numbers.
  Release, on the closest thing to real hardware available. macOS
  release is buildable locally; the simulator refuses release.
- **No perf claim from a single sample.** A second run of identical code
  once gave 695 ms → 8 ms for the same payload. One sample is noise with
  a decimal point. Take medians, and report the spread when it is wide.
- **A/B interleaved**, baseline and candidate alternating, so machine
  state lands on both. Sequential A-then-B has produced +99.5%, −6.7%
  and +0.1% for the same pair.
- **Prove the workload ran.** Assert the count. A "39% faster" list
  benchmark was timing 10 virtualized rows, not 2000. A 20k-dispatch
  loop clocked 17 ns/op because the queue ceiling was refusing almost
  every call — it was timing the rejection path.
- **A big segment is not a critical-path segment.** Sizing the phases
  tells you where time is *spent*, not where it is *costing*. Three
  targets picked by size in one session all evaporated under a control:
  a 78 ms "bundle extraction" that sub-timing showed was 3 ms (the
  phase timer bracketed a whole function and charged it the label on
  the outside); a 59 ms first-frame raster that a one-rect control
  screen cut to 2.3 ms with **zero** change to the total, because the
  frame waits on vsync regardless; and a 91 ms MethodChannel delay that
  sits entirely off the path — `Fully drawn` lands 84 ms *after* the
  call it supposedly gates. The only evidence that a segment costs
  anything is removing it and re-measuring the **total**.
- **A/B/A, and quantify the drift.** When two builds can't be
  interleaved per-run (same applicationId, compile-time flags), run
  A-block, B-block, A-block and report the A-to-A drift alongside the
  delta. A change smaller than the drift is not proven. This caught a
  combined arm reading "no change" that was hiding a real +20 ms win
  under a −13 ms regression, and a prefetch that looked like a clean
  win at n=3 and was an 18 ms regression at n=10.
- If the honest answer is "too noisy to tell", that is the answer. Say
  it instead of picking the flattering run.

## Before reporting a bug found through a tool, rule out the tool

Four times in one session an environment artifact impersonated a product
bug. Reproduce outside the harness, or prove the harness is innocent,
first:

- **The browser pane is often `visibilityState: "hidden"`, viewport
  0×0.** Hidden documents fire no scroll events and deliver no rAF or
  ResizeObserver callbacks. `resize_window` does not fix it. Windowed
  lists "not re-windowing" and lazy Flutter-embed hosts "never booting"
  were both this. Use a real browser (`open <url>`) and have the page
  report back via `fetch('/__probe?...')` — the static server logs the
  path, and `preview_logs` can read it.
- **Vite/browser HTTP cache serves stale modules.** An alias fix looked
  inert through three reloads. Prove what is actually served by fetching
  the module and grepping its text, or test the production build on a
  fresh port.
- **Inactive tabs are hidden, so their children have zero size.** Lazy
  work gated on first layout correctly does not fire there. Activate the
  tab before concluding anything.
- **A simulator RUNTIME can be the bug.** Emoji rendered as tofu on the
  iOS 26.3 simulator — `🚀` U+1F680 and `↩` U+21A9 both, while `♥`
  U+2665 was fine. Not Skal: the same build renders them on the iOS 18.6
  simulator and on web. The emoji font is even present in the 26.3
  runtime (`AppleColorEmoji-160px.ttc`), so it is a fallback failure in
  the engine on that runtime, not a missing file. Before touching text
  or font code, run the SAME build on a second runtime.

  The attempted fix cost more than the bug: adding `fontFamilyFallback`
  with the platform emoji fonts turned EVERY glyph in the app to tofu,
  because that property REPLACES Flutter's implicit fallback chain
  rather than extending it — an emoji-only list leaves nothing with
  Latin glyphs.
- **`find.byType` skips offstage widgets by default.** An `IndexedStack`
  child is offstage, so the obvious widget test passed against the
  unfixed code. Read the parent's child list directly.

## Test the other side of the wire

Tests written by the pass that wrote the code cover the half its author
was looking at. Chunked replies shipped with a mutation-tested splitter
and a reassembler with no tests at all — three live bugs sat in that
gap, all on the untested side.

- Every test gets **mutation-checked**: break the fix, watch the test
  fail. A test that passes with the fix deleted is worse than no test.
