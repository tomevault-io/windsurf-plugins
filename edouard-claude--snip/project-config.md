# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**snip** is a CLI proxy written in Go that reduces LLM token consumption by 60-90% by filtering shell output before it reaches the LLM context. Inspired by [rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) (Rust Token Killer), snip improves on the concept with a **declarative filter DSL** — filters are YAML config files, not compiled code.

## Key Concept

The binary (snip) is the engine. Filters are data files. The two evolve independently. Anyone can contribute a filter without knowing Go.

## Repository Structure

```
cmd/snip/main.go        # Entry point
embed.go                # Embedded default filters (go:embed)
filters/*.yaml          # Declarative filter definitions (126 filters)
internal/
  cli/                  # CLI routing, flag parsing
  config/               # TOML config loading (~/.config/snip/config.toml)
  display/              # Lipgloss terminal styling, gain report
  engine/               # Command execution (goroutines), pipeline orchestration
  filter/               # DSL types, 16 built-in actions, YAML parser, registry
  hook/                 # Claude Code PreToolUse hook handler (native Go, no bash/jq)
  initcmd/              # Multi-agent hook installation (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, Cline)
  discover/             # Session history scanner for missed savings
  tracking/             # SQLite token tracking (pure Go, no CGO)
  tee/                  # Raw output recovery on failure
  utils/                # Truncate, StripANSI, EstimateTokens, LazyRegex
tests/fixtures/         # Test fixtures for integration tests
```

## Architecture

### Core Loop

1. Intercept command via `snip hook` (Claude Code PreToolUse, native Go)
2. Route to matching filter (O(1) registry lookup)
3. Execute original command, capture stdout/stderr via goroutines
4. Apply declarative filter pipeline (regex-based: keep/remove lines, reformat, template)
5. Output filtered result, track token savings in SQLite

### Why Go over Rust

- Static binaries, no runtime dependencies, trivial cross-compilation
- Goroutines naturally solve the stdout/stderr concurrent read problem (vs 2 OS threads in rtk)
- Lower barrier to entry for community contributions
- Pure Go SQLite driver (no CGO needed)

## Development Commands

```bash
make build               # Build static binary (CGO_ENABLED=0)
make build-lite          # Build without SQLite tracking (-tags lite, ~5MB smaller)
make test                # Run all tests with coverage
make test-race           # Run tests with race detector
make lint                # go vet + golangci-lint
make install             # Install to $GOPATH/bin
make install-lite        # Install lite variant
go test -run TestName ./internal/filter/...   # Single test
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean          # Test release build locally
```

## Design Constraints

- **Startup < 10ms** — snip intercepts every shell command; latency is critical
- **Hook path is fast** — `snip hook` loads filters + registry only (no SQLite, no tracking)
- **SQLite init cost** — `modernc.org/sqlite` `init()` adds ~3.4ms; use `NewLazyTracker` + `WarmUp()` to overlap with command execution
- **Graceful degradation** — if a filter fails, fall back to raw command output
- **Exit code preservation** — always propagate the underlying tool's exit code
- **No async runtime** — goroutines are sufficient; avoid heavy dependencies
- **Lazy compilation** — compile regex once (sync.Once), reuse across invocations
- **Minimal memory** — stream and filter line-by-line, don't buffer entire output

## Build Variants

Two build modes via Go build tags:
- **Full** (default): includes `modernc.org/sqlite` for token tracking via `internal/tracking/driver.go`
- **Lite** (`-tags lite`): excludes SQLite, uses `driver_lite.go` stub — startup ~3ms faster

Tests requiring SQLite must have `//go:build !lite` tag. Check `tracking.DriverAvailable` at runtime.

## Filter DSL

Filters are declarative YAML files with 19 built-in actions:
`keep_lines`, `remove_lines`, `truncate_lines`, `strip_ansi`, `head`, `tail`,
`group_by`, `dedup`, `json_extract`, `json_schema`, `ndjson_stream`,
`regex_extract`, `state_machine`, `aggregate`, `format_template`, `compact_path`,
`replace`, `match_output`, `on_empty`

## Release Workflow

Uses GoReleaser (`.goreleaser.yaml`) + GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yaml`).
A push of any `v*` tag triggers CI to build cross-platform binaries and create a GitHub release.

### Semver Tagging

Every push that changes behavior **must** include a version tag:
- **Patch** (`v0.1.1`): bug fixes, no API change
- **Minor** (`v0.2.0`): new features, backward-compatible
- **Major** (`v1.0.0`): breaking changes

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "fix: description" && git push origin v0.1.1
```

### Checklist

1. `make test` passes
2. Commit with conventional prefix (`fix:`, `feat:`, `breaking:`)
3. Create annotated tag following semver
4. Push tag — CI handles release automatically
5. For first-time or local validation: `goreleaser release --snapshot --clean`
