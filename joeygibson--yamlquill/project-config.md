# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**YAMLQuill** is a terminal-based structural YAML editor with vim-style keybindings, forked from [JSONQuill](https://github.com/joeygibson/jsonquill). The goal is to achieve full feature parity with JSONQuill while adding support for YAML-specific features including multi-document files, anchors/aliases, and multi-line strings.

**Status:** Phase 5 Complete (v1.1) - Full feature parity with comment support, section-level format preservation, and anchor/alias display/navigation

## Development Workflow

This project uses **git worktrees** for isolated feature development. The main repository contains documentation and plans, while implementation happens in worktrees.

### Working in the Main Repository

```bash
# Navigate to repository
cd ~/Projects/yamlquill

# Build
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with example
cargo run -- examples/sample.yaml

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Lint
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

## Pre-Commit Requirements

**CRITICAL: These checks are MANDATORY before ANY commit. Never offer to commit without running all checks first.**

### Required Checks (in order)

1. **Format verification:**
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --check
   ```
   If fails: Run `cargo fmt` to fix, then verify again.

2. **Clippy linting:**
   ```bash
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   ```
   Must pass with zero warnings. Fix all issues before proceeding.

3. **Test suite:**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```
   All tests must pass (currently ~437 tests expected).

4. **Security audit:**
   ```bash
   cargo audit
   ```
   Must pass with no vulnerabilities. Fix or update affected dependencies before proceeding.

5. **Documentation updates:**
   - Update CLAUDE.md if implementation changes project status
   - Update relevant plan documents if approach changes
   - Add research findings if investigation was performed

### Quick Check Command

```bash
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test && cargo audit
```

**Process:** Run all checks → Fix any failures → Verify again → THEN offer to commit.

Never skip these steps. Never assume code is clean without verification.

## Architecture

See `docs/plans/2026-01-31-yamlquill-design.md` for the complete design document.

### Core Concept

YAMLQuill is a structural fork of JSONQuill, replacing JSON parsing/serialization with YAML while preserving:
- Entire vim-style TUI editor architecture
- Theme system (all 15 themes)
- Input handling (vim keybindings, registers, marks, visual mode)
- Configuration system

### Key Design Decisions

- **Parser:** yaml-rust2 Parser/EventReceiver for anchor/alias support, serde_yaml for serialization
- **Multi-document:** Full support (similar to JSONL in JSONQuill)
- **Tree view:** Abstract representation matching JSONQuill (arrays as `[0]`, `[1]`)
- **Multi-line strings:** Multi-line string type preservation (Literal `|` and Folded `>`)
- **Anchors/aliases:** Display anchors with `&name` badges, aliases as `*name` nodes with read-only enforcement

}

pub enum YamlString {
    Plain(String),                     // Regular string
    Literal(String),                   // | style, preserves newlines
    Folded(String),                    // > style, folds newlines
}

pub enum YamlNumber {
    Integer(i64),
    Float(f64),

- **Clipboard:** arboard 3.4
- **Compression:** flate2 1.0

## Key Features

### v1.0 Features ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ JSON→YAML conversion complete
- ✅ Full YAML parsing and tree view
- ✅ Multi-document YAML files
- ✅ Anchors and aliases (display with `&name` badges and `*name` nodes)
- ✅ Anchor navigation (press Enter on `*alias` to jump to `&anchor` definition)
- ✅ Multi-line strings with style preservation (Literal `|` and Folded `>`)
- ✅ All 15 themes from JSONQuill
- ✅ Gzip compression support (.yaml.gz)
- ✅ Format preservation for unmodified nodes
- ✅ Section-level format preservation for structural edits
- ✅ Anchor/alias preservation on save via line-level patching
- ✅ Comment support (parse, display, add, save)
- ✅ Anchor delete protection and read-only alias enforcement

### v1.1 Known Limitations

- Anchors/aliases are preserved for value edits, key additions, and comment additions via line-level patching; only complex structural changes (e.g., deleting keys, adding array items) in anchor sections fall back to serde_yaml which resolves aliases to inline values
- Cannot create new anchors/aliases via UI (display, navigate, and enforce only)
- No tag editing (preserved but not editable)
- No advanced multi-line features (chomping, indentation indicators)

### v2.0+ Future Enhancements

- Create/edit anchors and aliases via UI
- YAML tag editing
- Advanced multi-line string controls

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
cargo test

# Specific test file

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Phase 2:** >60% coverage on core functionality
- **Phase 5:** >80% coverage on business logic

## Common Development Tasks

### Building and Running

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (optimized)
cargo build --release

# Run with example file
cargo run -- examples/sample.yaml

# Run with custom file
cargo run -- /path/to/your/file.yaml

# Run with stdin
cat file.yaml | cargo run

# Run with gzip file
cargo run -- data.yaml.gz
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check formatting without changing
cargo fmt --check

# Run clippy linter
cargo clippy

# Clippy with warnings as errors (pre-commit requirement)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Check without building
cargo check
```

### Version Management

Use the `scripts/ver` script to manage version updates and create releases:

```bash
# Print current version
./scripts/ver

# Update to new version (validates format, updates files, commits, tags)
./scripts/ver 0.3.0
```

### Updating GitHub Release Notes

Use the `scripts/update-release` script to push release notes from a local file to a GitHub release:

```bash
# Update release v0.14.0 from release-notes-v0.14.0.md
./scripts/update-release 0.14.0
```

The script will:
1. Look for `release-notes-v<version>.md` in the project root
2. Verify the GitHub release exists
3. Update the release notes via `gh release edit`

Accepts the version with or without the `v` prefix (`0.14.0` or `v0.14.0`).

## Configuration

YAMLQuill will support configuration at `~/.config/yamlquill/config.toml` (not yet implemented in Phase 1).

**Planned config options:**
- Theme selection
- Line numbers (absolute/relative)
- Mouse support
- Backup file creation
- Undo limit
- Format preservation settings

## Documentation

### Design Documents

- `docs/plans/2026-01-31-yamlquill-design.md` - Complete design specification
- `docs/plans/2026-01-31-phase1-core-structure.md` - Phase 1 implementation plan

### User Documentation

**Phase 5 will include:**
- README.md with feature list and keybindings
- User guide
- Architecture documentation
- Contributing guide

## Worktree Workflow

### Creating a New Worktree

```bash
# For new features
git worktree add ~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/yamlquill/feature-name -b feature/feature-name

# Navigate to worktree
cd ~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/yamlquill/feature-name
```

### Commit Workflow

**MANDATORY PROCESS - Never deviate from this sequence:**

1. **Verify code quality:**
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test && cargo audit
   ```

2. **Update documentation** (if needed):
   - CLAUDE.md (project status, phase completion)
   - Plan documents (implementation details, decisions)
   - Research findings (investigation results)

3. **Stage changes:**
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   ```

4. **Verify what's staged:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --cached
   ```

5. **Commit with descriptive message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "type: description

   - Detail 1
   - Detail 2

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```

**Never skip step 1.** Never offer to commit without completing all verification steps first.

### Finishing Work in a Worktree

When a phase is complete:

1. Run pre-commit checks (see Commit Workflow above)
2. Commit any remaining changes
3. Tag the completion (e.g., `v0.1.0-phase1`)
4. Decide on integration strategy:
   - Merge to main
   - Create pull request
   - Continue development in worktree

Use `@superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` skill for guided cleanup.

### Removing a Worktree

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree
git worktree remove ~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/yamlquill/feature-name

# Prune stale worktree references
git worktree prune
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Problem:** `cargo build` fails with dependency errors

**Solution:** Update dependencies
```bash
cargo update
cargo clean
cargo build
```

**Problem:** Clippy warnings fail the build

**Solution:** Fix warnings or add `#[allow()]` for intentional cases
```bash
cargo clippy --fix
```

### Test Issues

**Problem:** Tests fail after making changes

**Solution:** Update tests to match new API
- Check for YamlString vs String mismatches
- Verify YamlNumber vs f64 changes
- Update assertions for new data structures

### Runtime Issues

**Problem:** Editor doesn't start

**Solution:** Verify you have a controlling terminal
```bash
# Won't work in non-interactive contexts
echo '{}' | yamlquill  # ❌ Fails

# Works in terminal
yamlquill file.yaml  # ✅ Success
```
