# Autonomous Development Workflow

For AI agents completing tasks without human supervision. The goal: deliver a clean pull
request that passes all checks and gets merged without back-and-forth.

## Spec Quality Is the Bottleneck

Invest more time understanding the problem than writing the implementation. A precise
understanding of the problem produces better code than any amount of iteration on an
ambiguous one. If the task description is ambiguous, clarify before implementing. Quick,
localized changes with no behavioral impact may proceed directly.

## Before Implementation

Assess whether you have enough clarity to implement correctly. Can you articulate the
problem being solved, what "done" looks like, the edge cases, and the assumptions you're
making? If not, ask before proceeding.

Load project standards via `/load-rules`. If that's not available, fall back to reading
applicable rules directly. Every applicable rule must be followed.

If `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` exist in the project root, read those for additional
context.

## Implementation

Write code following all cursor rules. Reference specific rules by reading the files
directly.

## Validation - Use the Tooling

The project has tooling configured. We use it instead of manually trying to comply.

Check for pre-commit and run if exists:

```bash
[ -f .pre-commit-config.yaml ] && pre-commit run --all-files
```

Read `.github/workflows/build.yml` (or ci.yml, test.yml) and replicate those validation
steps locally, for example:

```bash
ruff check --fix .    # Auto-fix linting
ruff format .         # Auto-format code
pytest                # Run tests
```

If we added functionality, we add tests following project patterns. Aim for 95% coverage
-- solid testing without obsessing over every edge case.

Only commit and push when all validation passes.

## Evaluate Outcomes

Run `git diff` and review the changes at the feature level. The question isn't "is every
line correct" -- it's "does this changeset solve the problem cleanly?"

Verify the implementation delivers what was asked for -- not just technically correct, but
useful. Check that no unnecessary complexity was introduced.

Read through applicable rules and verify compliance. Document any assumptions or
non-obvious choices in the PR description so reviewers understand the decisions made.

## Submission

Generate commit message following git-commit-message.mdc (if present).

Use `gh pr create` to submit a high-quality pull request with clear description of what
changed and why.

## Boundaries

Proceed autonomously: using existing tooling, following established patterns, changes
within task scope.

Ask first: major architectural changes, changes that would result in data loss, etc.

## Success

A successful autonomous PR means: the implementation solves the stated problem, all
automated checks pass, code follows project standards, and the developer merges it
without requesting changes.
