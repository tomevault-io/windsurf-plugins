# Code Review Standards

This rule defines when bot feedback is incorrect given context bots lack. Use this to
identify suggestions that don't apply, not to skip valid feedback based on priority.

## Core Philosophy

Address all suggestions where the bot's analysis is correct given full context. Decline
when you can articulate why the bot's reasoning doesn't hold - valid declines explain
why the analysis is incorrect, not why addressing it is inconvenient.

## When Bot Suggestions Don't Apply

These patterns describe situations where bot analysis is typically incorrect. Decline
with explanation when you can demonstrate the bot's reasoning doesn't hold.

### Single-Use Values

Bots flag inline values as "magic strings" needing extraction. This suggestion is wrong
when the value appears exactly once and context makes the meaning clear. Extracting
`METHOD_INITIALIZE = "initialize"` for a single use adds indirection without DRY
benefit. Constants exist to stay DRY across multiple uses, not to avoid inline values.

### Theoretical Race Conditions

Bots flag potential race conditions based on static analysis. This suggestion is wrong
when operations are already serialized by a queue, mutex, or transaction the bot can't
see. Add synchronization when profiling or testing reveals actual race conditions.

### Redundant Type Safety

Bots suggest stricter types or null checks. This suggestion is wrong when runtime
validation already handles the case correctly, or when the type system guarantees the
condition can't occur. TypeScript serves the code - working code with runtime safety
takes priority over compile-time type perfection.

### Premature Optimization

Bots flag performance concerns without data. This suggestion is wrong when no profiling
shows actual performance problems. Optimize based on measurements - complexity should
yield measurable performance gains.

## Items Requiring Case-by-Case Judgment

These require evaluation in context - sometimes the bot is right, sometimes wrong.

### Test Coverage Gaps

Bot requests for edge case tests: Address if the edge case could reasonably occur and
cause user-facing issues. Decline if you can demonstrate the scenario is already handled
by other validation or genuinely can't occur given system constraints.

### Documentation Requests

Bot requests for additional docs: Address if the code is genuinely unclear. Decline if
the documentation would merely restate what the code already says clearly.

### Accessibility Improvements

Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support) is a product
priority decision that varies by project. Check project or user configuration for the
team's stance. If no stance is declared, present the suggestion to the user with context
about the scope and ask whether to address or decline.
