# Cursor Rules for enji-react-svg-drawings

## Project Overview
This is a parametric drawing system built with React, Next.js, and SVG. It demonstrates how to create technical drawings (specifically structural engineering drawings) using component-based architecture.

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Organization
- **Core Drawing Components** (`src/components/enji-drawings-core/`): Reusable SVG drawing primitives
  - These are pure React components that render SVG elements
  - All components are exported from `index.ts` using the `@enji-drawings-core` alias
  - Components accept props for parametric control (dimensions, positions, styles)

- **Feature Components** (`src/features/`): Complete parametric drawings composed from core components
  - Example: `RectangularSectionRC.tsx` combines multiple core components to create a full drawing

- **UI Components** (`src/components/ui/`): Reusable UI elements (shadcn/ui based)
  - Used for settings panels, forms, and application UI

### Key Conventions

1. **Import Aliases**:
   - `@/` → `src/`
   - `@enji-drawings-core` → `src/components/enji-drawings-core`

2. **Component Patterns**:
   - Core drawing components use SVG elements directly
   - All drawing components should accept a `position` or `startPoint` prop (Point type)
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for all component props
   - Components should be pure and predictable (same props = same output)

3. **State Management**:
   - State is lifted to page components or feature components
   - Use React hooks (useState, useRef) for local state
   - Parameters flow down from parent to child components

4. **Styling**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
   - Follow shadcn/ui patterns for UI components
   - SVG elements use inline styles or className for Tailwind classes

5. **TypeScript**:
   - All components must be typed
   - Use interfaces for props
   - Geometry types are defined in `src/types/geometry.ts`

## File Structure Guidelines

### Creating New Core Components
1. Create component in `src/components/enji-drawings-core/`
2. Export from `src/components/enji-drawings-core/index.ts`
3. Add to navigation in `src/config/navigation.ts` if it should appear in docs
4. Follow naming: PascalCase, descriptive (e.g., `DimensionLine.tsx`)

### Creating New Feature Drawings
1. Create feature directory: `src/features/[feature-name]/`
2. Create component: `components/[FeatureName].tsx`
3. Create page: `src/app/(detailings)/[feature-name]/page.tsx`
4. Add to navigation: `src/config/navigation.ts`

### SVG Drawing Best Practices
- Use SVG coordinate system (origin at top-left, y increases downward)
- All measurements should be in consistent units (typically millimeters for engineering drawings)
- Use `transform` attributes for positioning and rotation
- Keep SVG elements semantic and accessible
- Use `viewBox` for responsive scaling

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Drawing Primitive
1. Create component in `enji-drawings-core/`
2. Accept props for position, dimensions, and styling
3. Return SVG elements wrapped in `<g>` (group) if needed
4. Export from `index.ts`
5. Document with JSDoc comments

### Adding a New Parametric Drawing
1. Create feature component that composes core components
2. Accept all parameters as props
3. Calculate positions and dimensions from parameters
4. Create page component with state management
5. Add settings panel for user input
6. Include export functionality (PDF, PNG, SVG)

### Modifying Existing Components
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Update TypeScript types if props change
- Test with existing feature components
- Update documentation if behavior changes

## Code Style

- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Prefer named exports for components
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex calculations
- Keep components focused on single responsibility
- Extract complex calculations to utility functions

## Testing Considerations

- Components should be testable in isolation
- SVG rendering can be tested with React Testing Library
- Parameter calculations should be pure functions when possible
- Consider visual regression testing for drawings

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When working with AI assistants:
- Reference component names exactly as they appear in the codebase
- Use the `@enji-drawings-core` alias when importing core components
- Follow existing patterns for similar components
- Maintain TypeScript types for all new code
- Keep SVG coordinate system conventions consistent
