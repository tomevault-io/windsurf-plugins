# content-ideas plugin

A cross-host skill that turns competitor activity into a daily "For You" feed of
content ideas. Runs the same on Claude Code and Codex (and any host that reads
`AGENTS.md`). Dependency-free Python (stdlib only) plus a single self-contained
HTML renderer.

## Structure
- `skills/content-ideas/SKILL.md` — canonical skill definition (the entry point)
- `skills/content-ideas/scripts/scrape.py` — competitor/own-channel scraper
- `skills/content-ideas/scripts/generate_feed.py` — builds the For You HTML feed
- `skills/content-ideas/scripts/lib/` — platform fetchers, scoring, relevance, rendering
- `skills/content-ideas/assets/for-you-template.html` — renderer template
- `skills/content-ideas/references/content-strategy.md` — idea-generation guidance

## Cross-host packaging
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` — Claude Code install
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (`"skills": "./skills/"`) — Codex install
- `AGENTS.md` → `@CLAUDE.md` — Codex / generic-agent entry point
- `commands/content-ideas.md` — Claude Code slash command
- `hooks/hooks.json` — SessionStart setup preflight (one-line hint, silent when ready)

The skill resolves its own directory from the Codex cache, the Claude plugin
cache, or a repo checkout — see the resolution block at the top of `SKILL.md`.
Keep that block in sync if directory names change.

## Commands
```bash
# run the test suite (stdlib + pytest, no network)
python3 -m pytest -q

# exercise the scraper / feed generator directly against a checkout
python3 skills/content-ideas/scripts/scrape.py --help
python3 skills/content-ideas/scripts/generate_feed.py --help
```

## Rules
- Runtime stays dependency-free: stdlib only (`urllib`, `json`, ...). No pip installs at runtime.
- `skills/content-ideas/scripts/lib/__init__.py` is a bare package marker — no eager imports.
- Persistent state lives under `$CONTENT_HOME` (default `~/Documents/Content`), never the cwd.
- Credentials live in `~/.config/content/.env` (`SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY`, `SETUP_COMPLETE`).
- Version is tracked in `pyproject.toml`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and the
  `version:` field of `SKILL.md` — keep them identical. `tests/test_plugin_contract.py` enforces this.
