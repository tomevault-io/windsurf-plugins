# Development Guidelines

This document contains critical information about working with this codebase.
Follow these guidelines precisely with a focus on maintainability and clear separation of concerns.

## Quick Start

For new repository setup, use justfile:

```bash
just setup  # Installs dependencies and pre-commit hooks
```

Common development commands:

```bash
just --list      # Show all available commands
just format      # Format code
just lint        # Check code quality
just test        # Run tests
just ci          # Run full CI pipeline
```

## Core Development Principles

### Fundamental Philosophy

- **Business behavior first**: Focus on what the system does for users, not technical implementation
- **Emergent design**: Let architecture evolve based on real needs, not speculation
- **Simplicity over complexity**: Choose the simplest solution that delivers value
- **Clear boundaries**: Separate business logic from infrastructure
- **Function composition**: Build complex behavior by composing simple, focused functions
- **Continuous improvement**: Each development cycle is an opportunity to improve both tests and implementation

### Package Management

- ONLY use uv, NEVER pip
- Installation: `uv add package`
- Upgrading: `uv add --dev package --upgrade-package package`
- FORBIDDEN: `uv pip install`, `@latest` syntax

### Pre-commit Hooks (prek)

This template uses `prek`, a Rust-based drop-in replacement for pre-commit that runs **10x faster** while using half the disk space.

**Why prek:**
- Dramatically faster hook execution for faster commits
- Reduced disk usage compared to Python-based pre-commit
- Full compatibility with existing pre-commit hooks
- Used by major projects like Apache Airflow and PDM

**Configuration:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (same as traditional pre-commit)

### Version Drift Prevention

This template uses `sync-with-uv` to eliminate version drift between `uv.lock` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

**How it works:**
- `uv.lock` is the single source of truth for all tool versions
- The `sync-with-uv` pre-commit hook runs before all other hooks
- It automatically updates tool versions in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to match `uv.lock`
- No manual synchronization needed when upgrading dependencies

**Benefits:**
- Consistent tool behavior between local development and CI
- Eliminates unexpected pre-commit failures from version mismatches
- Reduces manual maintenance of configuration files

**Usage:**
When you upgrade a tool with `uv add --dev tool --upgrade-package tool`, the next commit automatically syncs the version to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Code Quality Standards

- Type hints required for all code
- Follow existing patterns exactly
- Use Google style for docstrings
- Business-focused naming: Names should describe business value, not technical details

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### The TDD Mindset

- **Red-Green-Refactor cycle**: Write failing test → Make it pass → Improve the code
- **Tests define behavior**: Each test documents a specific business requirement
- **Design emergence**: Let the tests guide you to discover the right abstractions
- **Refactor when valuable**: Actively and frequently look for opportunities to make meaningful refactorings

### Critical TDD Rules

- **ONE TEST AT A TIME**: Add only a single test, see it fail (RED), implement minimal code to pass (GREEN), refactor (REFACTOR), repeat
- **MINIMAL IMPLEMENTATION**: Fix only the immediate test failure - do not implement complete functionality until tests demand it
- **NO BULK TEST ADDITION**: Never add multiple tests simultaneously - TDD Guard will block this
- **FAIL FIRST**: Always run the new test to confirm it fails before writing implementation code
- **INCREMENTAL PROGRESS**: Each test should drive one small increment of functionality

### Refactoring Triggers

After each green test, look for:

- **Duplication to extract**: Shared logic that can be centralized
- **Complex expressions to simplify**: Break down complicated logic into clear steps
- **Emerging patterns**: Abstractions suggested by repeated structures
- **Better names**: Clarify intent through descriptive naming
- **Code smells to eliminate**:
  - Logic crammed together without clear purpose
  - Mixed concerns (business logic, calculations, data handling in one place)
  - Hard-coded values that should be configurable
  - Similar operations repeated inline instead of abstracted
  - High coupling between components
  - Poor extensibility requiring core logic changes

### Testing Best Practices

- Framework: `uv run --frozen pytest`
- **Shared code reuse**: Import shared logic from production code, never duplicate in tests
- **Test data factories**: Create functions that generate test data with sensible defaults
- **Business-focused tests**: Test names describe business value, not technical details
- Coverage: test edge cases and errors
- New features require tests
- Bug fixes require regression tests

### Common TDD Violations to Avoid

- Adding 4+ tests at once (blocked by TDD Guard)
- Over-implementing when test only needs imports or basic structure
- Writing implementation code before seeing test fail
- Implementing features not yet demanded by tests
