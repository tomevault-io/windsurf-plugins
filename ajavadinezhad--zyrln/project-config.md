# Testing discipline

**Never change runtime behavior, APIs, or user-visible functionality because a test expects something different.**

When a test fails:

1. Decide whether the **code** or the **test** is wrong against the real requirement (docs, issues, invariants).
2. If the test is wrong or outdated, **fix or delete the test** — do not add shims, lists, or branches in production code solely to satisfy assertions.
3. Do not add “exclude” lists that undo “include” lists, or duplicate configuration, just to reconcile contradictory tests.
4. Prefer fixing tests in the same change as a behavior fix; document intentional behavior in a short comment only when non-obvious.

If requirements are unclear, ask or read project docs before changing production code.
