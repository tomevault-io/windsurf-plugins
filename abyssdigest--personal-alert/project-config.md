# **Product Requirements Document: Personal Alert Mobile Application**

## **1\. Introduction**

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the features, functionality, and technical considerations for the "Personal Alert" mobile application. The purpose of this document is to serve as a comprehensive guide for the development team, ensuring a clear understanding of the product vision, user needs, and technical specifications.

## **2\. Product Overview**

The "Personal Alert" application is a utility tool designed for Android mobile devices. Its primary function is to monitor incoming notifications, detect specific user-defined keywords within their text content, and trigger custom alerts (sound playback and flashlight stroboscope) when a match is found. This app aims to provide users with a highly customizable and prominent way to be notified of critical information amidst a deluge of general notifications.

## **3\. Goals**

* To enable users to define custom keywords for notification monitoring.  
* To provide an immediate and noticeable alert (sound and visual) when a predefined keyword is detected in a notification.  
* To offer flexibility in configuring custom alert sounds and flashlight behavior.  
* To ensure the app is easy to use and configure.

## **4\. Target Audience**

* Individuals who receive a large volume of notifications and need to quickly identify critical ones.  
* Users who require an extra layer of alerting beyond standard notification sounds (e.g., for emergencies, specific work alerts, or personal reminders).  
* Users who prefer visual (flashlight) and distinct audio cues for important alerts.

## **5\. User Stories**

As a user, I want to:

* **Set up the app easily**: Be guided to grant necessary permissions on first launch.  
* **See the app's current status**: Understand if it's actively listening for notifications.  
* **Know when an alert was last triggered**: See recent alert activity on the main screen.  
* **Create new alert rules**: Define what notifications I care about.  
* **Specify a name for each rule**: Easily identify my alert rules.  
* **Add multiple keywords for a rule**: Monitor for various phrases within a single rule.  
* **Choose a custom sound for each rule**: Select an alert sound from my system ringtones, notifications, or media files.  
* **Enable/disable flashlight blinking for a rule**: Have a visual alert option.  
* **Edit existing alert rules**: Modify names, keywords, sounds, or flashlight settings.  
* **Delete alert rules**: Remove rules I no longer need.  
* **Be notified distinctly**: Hear a custom sound and see the flashlight blink when a notification contains my specified keywords.  
* **Receive alerts only via the main speaker**: Ensure alerts are audible even if headphones are connected.

## **6\. Functional Requirements**

### **6.1. Initial Setup**

* **FR1.1 \- Notification Access Request**: Upon the first launch, the application MUST prompt the user to grant "Notification Access" permission.  
  * **FR1.1.1 \- Guided Setup**: If permission is denied, the app SHOULD guide the user on how to manually enable it in device settings.  
  * **FR1.1.2 \- Permission Check**: The app MUST continuously check for notification access status and display a warning/instruction if it's revoked.

### **6.2. Main Screen**

* **FR2.1 \- Status Display**: The main screen MUST prominently display the current operational status of the app (e.g., "Active: Listening for notifications", "Inactive: Notification access denied").  
* **FR2.2 \- Last Alert Display**: The main screen MUST display information about the last triggered alert for up to 5 minutes after it occurs.  
  * **FR2.2.1 \- Alert Details**: This information SHOULD include the timestamp of the alert and, if possible, the name of the rule that triggered it.  
  * **FR2.2.2 \- Timed Display**: After 5 minutes, the "Last Alert" display SHOULD clear or indicate no recent alerts.  
* **FR2.3 \- Alert Item List**: The main screen MUST display a list of all user-configured alert items.  
  * **FR2.3.1 \- List Order**: Items SHOULD be displayed in the order they were created or a user-definable order.  
  * **FR2.3.2 \- Item Summary**: Each list item SHOULD display its name and a truncated representation of its keywords.

### **6.3. Alert Item Management**

* **FR3.1 \- Add New Item**: The app MUST provide an intuitive way to add new alert items (e.g., a "Plus" button or similar action).  
  * **FR3.1.1 \- Input Validation**: All input fields MUST have appropriate validation (e.g., name cannot be empty).  
* **FR3.2 \- Edit Existing Item**: The app MUST allow users to edit existing alert items (e.g., tapping on an item in the list).  
* **FR3.3 \- Delete Item**: The app MUST allow users to delete existing alert items (e.g., swipe-to-delete, long-press context menu).

### **6.4. Alert Item Properties**

Each alert item MUST have the following configurable properties:

* **FR4.1 \- Name**: A free-text field for the user to name the alert item (e.g., "Work Emails", "Emergency Contact").  
* **FR4.2 \- Keywords**: An editable list of keywords.  
  * **FR4.2.1 \- Multiple Keywords**: Users MUST be able to add multiple distinct keywords for a single alert item.  
  * **FR4.2.2 \- Keyword Input**: The UI SHOULD support adding/removing individual keywords effectively (e.g., tags, separate input fields, or comma-separated parsing).  
* **FR4.3 \- Flashlight Stroboscope**: A checkbox or toggle switch to enable/disable flashlight blinking when the alert is triggered.  
  * **FR4.3.1 \- Stroboscope Pattern**: If enabled, the flashlight MUST blink in a distinct, repetitive pattern (e.g., rapid on-off).  
* **FR4.4 \- Custom Sound**: An editable selection for the alert sound.  
  * **FR4.4.1 \- System Ringtones/Notifications**: Users MUST be able to select from pre-installed system ringtones and notification sounds.  
  * **FR4.4.2 \- Media Files**: Users MUST be able to select sounds from their device's media storage (e.g., .mp3, .wav files). This will require READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE permission on older Android versions, or proper scoped storage access on newer ones.

### **6.5. Core Alert Logic**

* **FR5.1 \- Notification Interception**: The application MUST intercept all incoming notifications using Android's NotificationListenerService.  
* **FR5.2 \- Text Extraction**: For each intercepted notification, the application MUST extract its primary text content.  
* **FR5.3 \- Text Normalization**: The extracted notification text MUST be converted to lowercase before keyword matching.  
* **FR5.4 \- Keyword Matching**: The normalized notification text MUST be checked against the keywords of all active alert items.  
  * **FR5.4.1 \- Case-Insensitive Matching**: Keyword matching MUST be case-insensitive (achieved by normalizing both the notification text and stored keywords to lowercase).  
  * **FR5.4.2 \- Partial Match**: A match occurs if any configured keyword is found as a substring within the normalized notification text.  
* **FR5.5 \- Sound Playback**: If a keyword match is found:  
  * **FR5.5.1 \- Configured Sound**: The application MUST play the sound configured for the matched alert item.  
  * **FR5.5.2 \- Main Speaker Only**: The sound MUST be routed exclusively through the device's main speaker, bypassing Bluetooth headphones or other connected audio devices.  
  * **FR5.5.3 \- Concurrent Playback**: If multiple matching notifications arrive in quick succession, sounds SHOULD queue or play concurrently without interruption if possible, but prioritizing the distinctness of each alert.  
* **FR5.6 \- Flashlight Blinking**: If a keyword match is found and the flashlight stroboscope is enabled for the matched alert item:  
  * **FR5.6.1 \- Camera Access**: The application MUST gain access to the device's camera flash.  
  * **FR5.6.2 \- Stroboscope Activation**: The flashlight MUST blink in a stroboscopic pattern for a predefined duration (e.g., 3-5 seconds).

## **7\. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **7.1. Performance**

* **NFR7.1.1 \- Low Latency**: Keyword detection and alert triggering MUST occur with minimal delay after a notification arrives.  
* **NFR7.1.2 \- Resource Efficiency**: The application MUST be optimized for low battery consumption and minimal CPU/memory usage, especially as a background service.

### **7.2. Usability (UX/UI)**

* **NFR7.2.1 \- Intuitive Interface**: The user interface MUST be clear, simple, and easy to navigate.  
* **NFR7.2.2 \- Responsive Design**: The UI MUST adapt well to different screen sizes and orientations.  
* **NFR7.2.3 \- Feedback**: The app SHOULD provide clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., item added, item deleted).

### **7.3. Security**

* **NFR7.3.1 \- Data Privacy**: The application MUST NOT collect or transmit any personal notification data outside the device. All processing should occur locally.  
* **NFR7.3.2 \- Permission Management**: The app MUST request only necessary permissions and explain why they are needed.

### **7.4. Compatibility**

* **NFR7.4.1 \- Android Version**: The application MUST be compatible with Android 8.0 (API level 26\) and newer versions, leveraging modern Android APIs where appropriate.  
* **NFR7.4.2 \- Device Compatibility**: The application SHOULD function correctly across a wide range of Android devices (various manufacturers, screen sizes).

## **8\. Technical Requirements**

* **TR8.1 \- Platform**: Android.  
* **TR8.2 \- Language**: Java.  
* **TR8.3 \- Core Android APIs**:  
  * NotificationListenerService: For intercepting and reading notification content.  
  * AudioManager: For controlling audio output to the main speaker.  
  * MediaPlayer or SoundPool: For playing custom sounds.  
  * CameraManager (for Android 5.0+): For controlling the camera flash.  
  * Permissions: Handling BIND\_NOTIFICATION\_LISTENER\_SERVICE, CAMERA, and potentially READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE (for media files).  
* **TR8.4 \- Persistence**: User-configured alert items (name, keywords, sound path, flashlight setting) MUST be persisted locally (e.g., using SharedPreferences, Room Database, or internal storage) so they are available across app launches.  
* **TR8.5 \- Background Operation**: The NotificationListenerService MUST be implemented to run reliably in the background, even when the main app UI is closed, adhering to Android's background execution limits and best practices.

## **9\. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for initial release)**

* **Notification Filtering**: Allow users to filter notifications by app package name.  
* **Time-Based Alerts**: Enable alerts only during specific time windows.  
* **Vibration Patterns**: Customizable vibration patterns in addition to sound and flashlight.  
* **Multiple Profiles**: Ability to switch between different sets of alert rules.  
* **UI Customization**: Themes or color schemes for the app.  
* **Battery Optimization**: More advanced handling for Doze mode and App Standby Buckets.
