## Build/Lint/Test Commands
```bash
# Development
bun dev              # Start dev server with Turbopack
bun build            # TypeScript check + build with Turbopack
bun start            # Start production server

# Code Quality
bun check-types      # TypeScript type checking
bun lint             # Run Biome linter
bun lint:fix         # Auto-fix linting issues
bun format           # Format code with Biome
bun test             # Run tests
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Imports
- Use absolute imports with `@/` alias
- Separate type imports: `import type { Props } from '...'`
- Import order: React → Next.js → third-party → local → types

### Component Structure
- Use arrow functions: `const Component = () => {}`
- Export components as named exports
- Define props with `type` keyword: `type ComponentProps = {...}`
- Use `cn()` utility for className merging
- Apply variants with `class-variance-authority` (cva)

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (`Message`, `CodeBlock`)
- Props types: Descriptive + "Props" suffix (`MessageProps`)
- Variants: descriptive names (`messageContentVariants`)
- Files: kebab-case for non-components

### Error Handling
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Handle async operations with proper error boundaries
- Validate props with TypeScript interfaces

### Formatting
- 2-space tabs (Biome configured)
- No semicolons (Biome removes them)
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in objects/arrays


## WEB INTERFACE GUIDELINES

Concise rules for building accessible, fast, delightful UIs Use MUST/SHOULD/NEVER to guide decisions

## Interactions

- Keyboard
  - MUST: Full keyboard support per [WAI-ARIA APG](https://wwww3org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)
  - MUST: Visible focus rings (`:focus-visible`; group with `:focus-within`)
  - MUST: Manage focus (trap, move, and return) per APG patterns
- Targets & input
  - MUST: Hit target ≥24px (mobile ≥44px) If visual <24px, expand hit area
  - MUST: Mobile `<input>` font-size ≥16px or set:
    ```html
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
    ```
  - NEVER: Disable browser zoom
  - MUST: `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom; set `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` to match design
- Inputs & forms (behavior)
  - MUST: Hydration-safe inputs (no lost focus/value)
  - NEVER: Block paste in `<input>/<textarea>`
  - MUST: Loading buttons show spinner and keep original label
  - MUST: Enter submits focused text input In `<textarea>`, ⌘/Ctrl+Enter submits; Enter adds newline
  - MUST: Keep submit enabled until request starts; then disable, show spinner, use idempotency key
  - MUST: Don’t block typing; accept free text and validate after
  - MUST: Allow submitting incomplete forms to surface validation
  - MUST: Errors inline next to fields; on submit, focus first error
  - MUST: `autocomplete` + meaningful `name`; correct `type` and `inputmode`
  - SHOULD: Disable spellcheck for emails/codes/usernames
  - SHOULD: Placeholders end with ellipsis and show example pattern (eg, `+1 (123) 456-7890`, `sk-012345…`)
  - MUST: Warn on unsaved changes before navigation
  - MUST: Compatible with password managers & 2FA; allow pasting one-time codes
  - MUST: Trim values to handle text expansion trailing spaces
  - MUST: No dead zones on checkboxes/radios; label+control share one generous hit target
- State & navigation
  - MUST: URL reflects state (deep-link filters/tabs/pagination/expanded panels) Prefer libs like [nuqs](https://nuqs47ngcom/)
  - MUST: Back/Forward restores scroll
  - MUST: Links are links—use `<a>/<Link>` for navigation (support Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click)
- Feedback
  - SHOULD: Optimistic UI; reconcile on response; on failure show error and rollback or offer Undo
  - MUST: Confirm destructive actions or provide Undo window
  - MUST: Use polite `aria-live` for toasts/inline validation
  - SHOULD: Ellipsis (`…`) for options that open follow-ups (eg, “Rename…”)
- Touch/drag/scroll
  - MUST: Design forgiving interactions (generous targets, clear affordances; avoid finickiness)
  - MUST: Delay first tooltip in a group; subsequent peers no delay
  - MUST: Intentional `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals/drawers
  - MUST: During drag, disable text selection and set `inert` on dragged element/containers
  - MUST: No “dead-looking” interactive zones—if it looks clickable, it is
- Autofocus
  - SHOULD: Autofocus on desktop when there’s a single primary input; rarely on mobile (to avoid layout shift)

## Animation

- MUST: Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (provide reduced variant)
- SHOULD: Prefer CSS > Web Animations API > JS libraries
- MUST: Animate compositor-friendly props (`transform`, `opacity`); avoid layout/repaint props (`top/left/width/height`)
- SHOULD: Animate only to clarify cause/effect or add deliberate delight
- SHOULD: Choose easing to match the change (size/distance/trigger)
- MUST: Animations are interruptible and input-driven (avoid autoplay)
- MUST: Correct `transform-origin` (motion starts where it “physically” should)

## Layout

- SHOULD: Optical alignment; adjust by ±1px when perception beats geometry
- MUST: Deliberate alignment to grid/baseline/edges/optical centers—no accidental placement
