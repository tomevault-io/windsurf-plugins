## Golden rule: check the change, not the suite

Finish a change with the change-scoped check:

```sh
bun run check:fast
```

Bend laws and generated-kernel parity, typecheck, then only the tests your
working tree touches. Do not replace this selection with the full suite.
There is **no extension build step**: pi loads the extension
from `src/` via jiti, so green checks on the files you touched mean the change
is live.

## Startup: lazy execution must also mean lazy imports

Warm jiti caches remove transpilation, not V8 module compilation. The extension
previously deferred graph work while still statically importing `ops`, `state`,
`sync`, and their entire analysis graph. Keep registration, root bookkeeping,
and idle lifecycle hooks lightweight; `core/extension-runtime.ts` loads only
when an operation actually needs analysis. Cleanup must not import an unused
runtime. Preserve reset/shutdown behavior after activation and coalesce concurrent
first loads. Type-only dependencies must use `import type`.

Do not move the cost into `session_start`, an idle prompt, an immediately invoked
async initializer, or a zero-delay background import. Avoid broad barrel imports
from startup code. Even catalog or schema-builder imports have transitive costs;
native ESM can bypass Pi's virtual host modules and load another package copy.

`tests/startup.test.ts` checks the complete static graph, byte budget, idle
lifecycle, first use, and activated cleanup. Keep it alongside the extension
behavior tests when changing imports; do not raise the budget to hide growth.
Measure fresh-process imports with warm filesystem caches, never repeated imports
in one process. From the sibling Fabric checkout, run
`bun run benchmark:startup ../pi-fovea`. Timings are observations; deterministic
graph and behavior checks are the regression gate. Development remains buildless.

## Checks are incremental, never a full sweep

Never run the whole suite as a gate. Verify the files a change touches:

```sh
bun run check:fast                             # typecheck + affected tests
bun run test:changed                           # dirty src/tests files vs HEAD
bun run test:affected                          # CI mode: $PI_TEST_BASE vs HEAD
bun run test:smoke                             # curated pipeline floor, seconds
bun run test:related -- src/core/build.ts      # tests importing given files
bunx vitest run tests/extract.test.ts          # one suite, by path
bun run typecheck                              # whole-program types, seconds
```

`scripts/test-affected.mjs` backs the first three. It feeds changed source
files to `vitest related`, runs changed `tests/**/*.test.ts` directly, and drops
deleted paths. That selection avoids the vitest `--changed` pitfall where a
dirty `package.json` forces the entire suite to run. An unreadable git state
fails loudly. Nothing falls back to the full suite, and there is no `bun run
check` or `bun run test` script: those aggregates are gone on purpose. When you
deliberately want everything, `bunx vitest run` is the whole suite.

CI selects by range: the workflow passes the pull-request base or the replaced
push tip as `PI_TEST_BASE` and compares it to `HEAD` as a three-dot diff. A
docs-only push selects nothing, and the curated `test:smoke` floor then carries
the signal. `bun run lint:dead` (knip) stays in CI because it costs under a
second. There is no cross-platform matrix: nothing in `src/` or `tests/` branches
on `process.platform`.

Publishing runs `prepack` (`check:proofs` then `build:cli`), never the suite.
The CLI build checks the generated artifact receipt without invoking Bend and
rejects unbundled dependencies other than Node built-ins. Before a release, run
`bun run check:package`: it checks a real Bun tarball outside the checkout,
including receipt hashes, entry points, licenses and compiler-free execution.
`bun run check:package path/to/package.tgz` checks an existing archive; publish
that same checked tarball with `bun publish path/to/package.tgz`.

## Executed Bend kernels

`LAWS.bend` names the actual exports of `proofs/kernel.bend`. Keep specifications
independent; never weaken a law to make a proof pass. After editing proof sources,
the ABI, bridge, or adapters: `bun run proofs:generate`, review the generated JS,
then `bun run check:fast`. Do not hand-edit `src/verified/generated/`.
The compiler is pinned to Bend 2.0.26. Unsafe definitions, unsafe Base primitives,
foreign/remote imports and escaping local imports are forbidden. Installed Fovea
needs no Bend executable, loader, or extension build; generated JS is committed.
See `docs/proofs.md` for executed guarantees versus model-only heat algebra.

## Cache invalidation

Two caches live in \`$TMPDIR\`: per-file extraction facts (\`pi-fovea-*.json\`,
keyed by content sha1 + \`CACHE_VERSION\` + rules hash) and co-change pairs
(\`pi-fovea-cochange-*.json\`, keyed by HEAD + tracked-file set).

Facts (symbols/imports/calls/literals per file) are content-hash cached in
`$TMPDIR/pi-fovea-*.json`. If you change *extractor semantics* (what a parser
emits for unchanged file content), bump `CACHE_VERSION` in
`src/core/build.ts` or stale test facts linger.

## Conventions
