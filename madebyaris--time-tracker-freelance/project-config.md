# SDD (Spec-Driven Development) System v5.1

**Requires Cursor 3.2+** for async subagents, plugins, hooks, skills, agent multitasking, worktrees, and multi-root sessions.

## Core Philosophy

Create specifications **before** code. Plan-approve-execute for all operations.

## Architecture

```
User Request → Main Agent → Subagents (parallel/async) → Skills (auto-invoked)
                    ↓                    ↓
              Verification ←── Subagent Tree (nested spawning)
```

## Subagents (`.cursor/agents/`)

| Subagent | Model | Mode | Purpose |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| `sdd-explorer` | inherit | foreground, readonly | Codebase discovery |
| `sdd-planner` | inherit | foreground | Architecture design |
| `sdd-implementer` | inherit | **background** | Code generation |
| `sdd-verifier` | inherit | foreground | Validation |
| `sdd-reviewer` | inherit | foreground, readonly | Code review |
| `sdd-orchestrator` | inherit | **background** | Parallel coordination |

### Foreground vs Background

- **Foreground** blocks the parent until complete. Use when results are needed immediately (exploration, planning, verification).
- **Background** (`is_background: true`) returns immediately. The parent continues working. Use for long-running implementations and orchestration.

### Subagent Tree (2.5+)

Subagents can spawn their own subagents:

```
sdd-orchestrator (background)
├── sdd-implementer (task 1) → sdd-verifier
├── sdd-implementer (task 2) → sdd-verifier
└── sdd-implementer (task 3) → sdd-verifier
```

### Delegation Guidelines

**Delegate when:** deep exploration, long implementation, parallel tasks, verification.
**Keep in main context when:** simple operations, user interaction needed, sequential dependent steps.

## Skills (`.cursor/skills/`)

| Skill | Auto-Invoke When | Purpose |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| `sdd-research` | Technical approach unclear | Pattern investigation |
| `sdd-planning` | Spec exists, no plan | Architecture generation |
| `sdd-implementation` | Plan ready for execution | Todo-based coding |
| `sdd-audit` | Code review requested | Spec compliance check |
| `sdd-evolve` | Discoveries during dev | Spec updates |

Skills use progressive loading — keep `SKILL.md` focused, put details in `references/`, scripts in `scripts/`, templates in `assets/`.

## Workflows

### Quick Planning (80% of features)
- `/brief` → `feature-brief.md` (30-minute planning)
- `/evolve` → Update specs with discoveries
- `/refine` → Iterate on existing specs

### Full Planning (complex features)
`/research` → `/specify` → `/plan` → `/tasks` → `/implement`

### Parallel Execution with DAG
- `/sdd-full-plan` → Create roadmap with DAG structure
- `/execute-task` → Sequential task execution
- `/execute-parallel` → Parallel via async subagents

### Cursor 3.2 Agent Runtime
- Use `/multitask` for ad hoc independent work that does not need a roadmap, checkpoint, or dependency graph.
- Use `/execute-parallel` for SDD roadmap execution because it handles dependencies, file-conflict batching, checkpoints, and verifier handoffs.
- Use Agents Window worktrees for risky, parallel, or best-of-N implementation work. `.cursor/worktrees.json` prepares the isolated checkout.
- In multi-root workspaces, resolve paths from the active project root and avoid assuming a single repository owns every file.

## DAG-Based Execution

Tasks as Directed Acyclic Graph with automatic parallelization:

```json
{
  "dag": {
    "roots": ["task-001", "task-003"],
    "parallelGroups": [["task-001", "task-003"], ["task-002", "task-004"]]
  }
}
```

**Pattern:** Identify ready tasks → spawn background subagents in parallel → collect results → verify with `sdd-verifier` → continue.

## Automated Verification

Every implementation triggers verification:

```
sdd-implementer → [code] → sdd-verifier → [validation report]
```

Background implementers spawn foreground verifiers as child subagents.

## Hooks (`.cursor/hooks.json`)

SDD uses hooks for workflow automation:

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `subagentStop` | Subagent completes | Track completion in roadmap |
| `stop` | Agent session ends | Generate completion summary |

See [Cursor hooks docs](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks) for configuration.

## Sandbox (`.cursor/sandbox.json`)

Network access controls for sandboxed commands. Configure allowed domains for package registries and APIs. See `.cursor/sandbox.json` for project defaults.

## File Organization

└── completed/                 # Delivered features
