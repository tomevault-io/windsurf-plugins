# AGENTS.md

Agent guide for `D:\DayZProjects\docs\wiki`.

## What This Repo Is
- 12-language DayZ modding wiki built with VitePress
- Main content is Markdown; primary code file is `.vitepress/config.mts`
- English in `en/` is the source of truth
- Other locale folders mirror the English tree exactly
- CI builds and deploys GitHub Pages from `.vitepress/dist`

## Rule Files
- `AGENTS.md`: this file
- `CLAUDE.md`: repository-specific guidance in the repo root
- Cursor rules: none found (`.cursor/rules/` absent, `.cursorrules` absent)
- Copilot rules: none found (`.github/copilot-instructions.md` absent)

If new Cursor or Copilot rule files are added later, follow them too.

## Tooling Snapshot
- Package manager: `npm`
- Lockfile: `package-lock.json`
- CI Node version: 22
- Key dependencies: `vitepress`, `vitepress-plugin-mermaid`, `mermaid`

## Commands
### Install dependencies
```bash
npm ci
```
Use `npm ci` for reproducible installs.
### Start local dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Starts VitePress with hot reload.
### Build static site
```bash
npm run build
```
Primary verification command.
Latest verified local result in this environment: VitePress began building successfully, then Node crashed with JavaScript heap out of memory. Do not claim builds pass unless you re-run and confirm a zero exit code.
### Preview built site
```bash
npm run preview
```
Requires a successful build first.

## Lint And Test Status
- No `lint` script exists in `package.json`
- No `test` script exists in `package.json`
- No ESLint config found
- No Prettier config found
- No markdownlint config found
- No Jest, Vitest, Mocha, or other automated test runner found
Do not invent extra tooling unless the user asks.

## Running A Single Test
There is no automated test framework here, so there is no single-test command.
Use the smallest relevant validation instead:
1. Content-only change: run `npm run dev` and inspect the changed page.
2. Link or sidebar change: run `npm run build` and read the failing output carefully.
3. `.vitepress/config.mts` change: verify the affected route in dev, then run `npm run build`.
4. Translation-only change: compare against the matching English page and nearby translations.

## Common Files Agents Edit
- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `.vitepress/config.mts`
- Locale docs under `en/`, `pt/`, `de/`, `ru/`, `es/`, `fr/`, `ja/`, `zh-hans/`, `cs/`, `pl/`, `hu/`, `it/`
- Reference docs like `cheatsheet.md`, `glossary.md`, `faq.md`, `troubleshooting.md`
## Repository Structure
- Chapter folders use numbered sections such as `01-enforce-script/` and `08-tutorials/`
- File naming convention:
```text
<part-number>-<section-name>/<sequence-number>-<topic-slug>.md
```
- Examples:
  - `en/01-enforce-script/01-variables-types.md`
  - `pt/08-tutorials/01-first-mod.md`

## Markdown And Content Style
- Use ATX headings only: `#`, `##`, `###`
- Keep exactly one `#` heading per file
- Use `---` between major sections
- Prefer relative links for internal links
- Use ordered lists for sequences and `-` bullets for non-sequential items
- Use tables for structured references when they help readability
- Write in second person when instructing the reader
- Use present tense
- Prefer plain English unless DayZ-specific terms are required

## Typical Chapter Shape
```markdown
# Chapter X.Y: Title
> **Summary:** One or two sentences.
---
## Table of Contents
---
## Section
---
**Previous:** [link] | [Home](../../README.md) | **Next:** [link]
```
Some older pages use a top navigation line instead. Match the surrounding file unless the task includes cleanup.
## Code Style For `.mts` And Embedded Examples

### Imports
- Keep imports at the top of the file
- Use straightforward named imports
- Match the existing quote and semicolon style of the file you edit
- Do not add helper layers unless they materially simplify the file

### Formatting
- Follow the existing file style; there is no formatter enforcing a different one
- Keep arrays and objects readable in `.vitepress/config.mts`
- Avoid whitespace-only churn
- Do not reflow Markdown tables carelessly

### Types And Abstractions
- Preserve existing TypeScript patterns
- Prefer simple explicit structures over clever abstractions
- Do not add type-heavy helpers unless clearly justified

### Naming
- Match naming already used in the file
- Config helpers use `camelCase` like `sidebarEN`
- Constants in examples may use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Markdown filenames use numeric prefixes and kebab-case slugs
- Keep terminology consistent with existing chapter titles

### Error Handling
- For docs, "error handling" mostly means avoiding broken links, anchors, and navigation
- For config changes, prefer explicit simple logic over indirection
- Report actual command failures instead of guessing
- Do not claim success without fresh command output
## Translation Rules
- Translate prose, headings, link labels, and code comments
- Do not translate code keywords, class names, method names, file names, or config syntax
- Keep links pointing at the correct locale directory
- Preserve parity with the English source unless the user explicitly wants divergence

## When Adding Or Renaming Chapters
Update all affected navigation surfaces together:
1. Root `README.md`
2. Relevant locale `README.md` files
