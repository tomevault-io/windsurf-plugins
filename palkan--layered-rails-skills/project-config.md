# CLAUDE.md

Agentic guidance for developing skills in this repo. Skills _usage_ lives in each skill's `SKILL.md` — this file is for the meta workflow of building and shipping skills.

## Repo layout

- `<plugin>/` — one directory per plugin (e.g. `layered-rails/`)
  - `commands/` — `/<plugin>:*` slash commands
  - `agents/` — agents launched by commands or directly
  - `skills/<skill>/` — `SKILL.md` + `references/` + `examples/`
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest
- `<plugin>-skills.gemspec` — packages the plugin's skill tree as a gem for the rails-hyperdrive install path (must sit at the repo root, above the tree it packages)
- `hyperdrive.yml` — gem-root manifest declaring rails-hyperdrive install gating: which gem(s)/version(s) a skill requires, and which supporting files install only when a given gem is bundled. Keyed by skill-dir relpath from the skills root (`layered-rails/skills`) — see Rendered skills
- `rails-hyperdrive/<plugin>/` — that gem's tooling: `templates/<skill>/SKILL.md.erb` (ERB master the skill's `SKILL.md` is rendered from — see Rendered skills), plus its `Gemfile` and `Rakefile`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — top-level marketplace manifest
- `Gemfile` / `Rakefile` — gem release plumbing; `rake release` runs from the repo root, next to the gemspec
- `scripts/lint-skills.py` — skill linter (rules described in its docstring)
- `lefthook.yml` — runs the linter pre-commit
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` — runs the linter and the freshness gate in CI
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — publishes the gem on `v*` tag push

## CHANGELOG

`CHANGELOG.md` uses a compact, flat format. The in-progress release lives under `## master`. One bullet per change, minimal prose:

```
## master

- Added `/layered-rails:foo` command to <one-line purpose>.
- Renamed `/layered-rails:bar` → `/layered-rails:baz` (and agent `<old>` → `<new>`).
```

Skip dev/tooling-only changes (lint scripts, CI workflows, hooks, internal refactors of scripts). Only user-visible plugin changes belong here.

On release, rename `## master` to `## <version>` and start a fresh `## master` block above it.

## Linting

Run before committing changes to any plugin file:

```bash
python3 scripts/lint-skills.py                    # full repo
python3 scripts/lint-skills.py --changed-only     # CI mode (diff vs origin)
python3 scripts/lint-skills.py path/to/SKILL.md   # specific files
```

Lefthook auto-runs the linter on staged `*.md` files; CI runs it on push and PR.

Key rules to remember when authoring (full list in the script's module docstring):

- `frontmatter.description.max-length` — ≤1024 chars; collapse trigger groups (`a/b/c`) when over budget
- `frontmatter.description.min-words` — ≥10 words
- `frontmatter.name.matches-dir` — `name:` must equal the skill directory name
- `body.length` / `reference.length` — ≤500 lines; split if larger
- `reference.toc` — reference files >100 lines need a `## Contents` section near the top
- `reference.one-level-deep` — links between non-SKILL `.md` files inside the skill must follow the tier hierarchy: `workflows/` (tier 1) may link DOWN to `references/` and `examples/` (tier 2); same-tier or upward links must go through `SKILL.md`
- `reference.no-orphans` — every `.md` in the skill dir must be linked from `SKILL.md`
- `reference.links-exist` / `plugin.links-exist` — all relative markdown links must resolve

To skip a rule with justification, use `lint-skip:` in the frontmatter:

```yaml
lint-skip:
  - rule: frontmatter.description.max-length
    reason: 'comprehensive trigger list is intentional'
```

## Rendered skills

`layered-rails/skills/layered-rails/SKILL.md` is generated from `rails-hyperdrive/layered-rails/templates/layered-rails/SKILL.md.erb` — edit the template, never the rendered file, then regenerate.

```bash
cd rails-hyperdrive/layered-rails
bundle exec rake "hyperdrive:skills:render[../../layered-rails-skills.gemspec]"   # rewrite SKILL.md from the template
bundle exec rake "hyperdrive:skills:check[../../layered-rails-skills.gemspec]"    # freshness gate — fails when they drift (also runs in CI)
```

Supporting files (`workflows/`, `references/`, `examples/`) have no templates and are edited directly.

## Versioning and release

SemVer. Bump the version in **both** places, kept in sync:

- `<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `version`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → `metadata.version` **and** matching `plugins[].version`

`layered-rails-skills.gemspec` reads its version from `plugin.json` at build time, so the gem follows automatically.

Bump rules:

- **Patch** — bug fixes, doc fixes, link repairs
- **Minor** — new commands, agents, references, examples (backward-compatible)
- **Major** — breaking changes for consumers (renamed or removed commands/agents, removed patterns)

Renaming a command or agent is a breaking change — external `CLAUDE.md` / `compound-engineering.local.md` files reference these by name.

Release flow:

1. Lint passes (`python3 scripts/lint-skills.py`).
2. Bump both manifests to the new version.
3. Rename `## master` → `## <version> (<date>)` in `CHANGELOG.md`; add a fresh `## master` above it.
