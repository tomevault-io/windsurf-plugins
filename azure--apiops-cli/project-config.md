# apiops-cli Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2026-04-06

**Never present unverified assumptions as facts.** This is the #1 rule for all AI interactions in this repo.

1. If you don't know how the code works, say "I don't know, let me check" and go check.
2. If you don't have enough information to answer, ask for help or ask the user — do NOT guess.
3. Taking time to verify is ALWAYS preferred over a fast but wrong answer.
4. Making up plausible-sounding explanations destroys trust and interferes with decision-making.
5. You have explicit permission to take your time. Speed is never an excuse for fabrication.

## Active Technologies

- TypeScript 5.x (Node.js Active LTS, currently 22.x) + Commander (CLI), `@azure/identity` (auth), `js-yaml` (YAML parsing), `simple-git` (git diff for incremental publish) (001-apiops-cli)

## Project Structure

```text
src/
tests/
```

## Commands

npm test; npm run lint

## Code Style

TypeScript 5.x (Node.js Active LTS, currently 22.x): Follow standard conventions

### Copyright Headers

**MANDATORY:** All source files MUST include the following copyright header at the very top of the file:

```typescript
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
// Licensed under the MIT license.
```

This applies to all files in `src/` and `tests/` directories. The header must appear before any other code, imports, or comments.

## Recent Changes

- 001-apiops-cli: Added TypeScript 5.x (Node.js Active LTS, currently 22.x) + Commander (CLI), `@azure/identity` (auth), `js-yaml` (YAML parsing), `simple-git` (git diff for incremental publish)

<!-- MANUAL ADDITIONS START -->

## Commit Message Convention

Always include `Closes #N` or `Fixes #N` in commit messages when the change resolves a GitHub issue. This auto-closes issues on PR merge. See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

### Multi-line Commit Messages

When creating commits with multi-line messages, **always use `git commit -F <tmpfile>`** instead of `git commit -m "..."` with embedded `\n`. The `-m` flag treats `\n` as literal text, not newlines, which breaks GitHub's auto-close keyword detection.

```bash
# CORRECT — write message to a temp file, then commit
echo "feat: add policy extraction" > /tmp/commit-msg.txt
echo "" >> /tmp/commit-msg.txt
echo "Closes #42" >> /tmp/commit-msg.txt
git commit -F /tmp/commit-msg.txt
rm /tmp/commit-msg.txt

# WRONG — literal \n in -m flag
git commit -m "feat: add policy extraction\n\nCloses #42"
```

### Issue References in PRs

Always include `Closes #N` in **both** the commit message AND the PR body's "Related Issue(s)" section. The PR body serves as a redundant safety net if commit message formatting fails.

## Pull Request Title and Description

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** When creating a pull request, the title and description must summarize **ALL changes in the branch**, not just the last commit.

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Once a pull request already exists, do **not** change its title or description unless the user explicitly asks you to do so.

### Before Creating Any PR

1. Run `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to see ALL commits in the branch
2. Review what the branch accomplishes as a whole (the feature, fix, or phase of work)
3. Write a title that describes the complete body of work (e.g., "feat: implement apiops init command" not "fix: resolve test failures")
4. Write a description that covers:
   - What the branch delivers overall
   - All significant commits/changes
   - Related issues/tasks
   - New files added
   - Modified functionality

### After a PR Already Exists

1. Treat the current PR title and description as user-approved context unless the user explicitly asks for a change
2. If the user does ask for an update, keep the title and description aligned with the **entire branch**, not just the latest iteration
3. Do not overwrite a good PR summary just because you made a new commit, merged `main`, or addressed review feedback

### Common Mistake

❌ **Wrong:** PR titled after the most recent commit ("fix: resolve Windows test failures")  
✅ **Right:** PR titled after the branch's purpose ("feat: implement apiops init command with CI/CD scaffolding")

The PR represents the **integration of the entire branch into main**, so describe what's being integrated.

## Code Review Requirement

**After any changes to files under `src/` or `tests/`**, a code review MUST be performed before the work is considered complete. This is a mandatory ceremony defined in `.squad/ceremonies.md`.

- The CodeReviewer agent reviews against the constitution at `.squad/identity/constitution.md` (§I-§VIII)
- Review checks: TypeScript strict compliance, testability (§VI), forward compatibility (§VII), secret safety (§VIII), YAGNI (§V)
- Severity levels: 🔴 Blocker (must fix), 🟡 Required (must fix), 🟢 Suggestion (author's discretion)
- Blockers MUST be resolved before merge

If you are working through the Squad coordinator, this happens automatically. If you are working directly (e.g., as a Copilot coding agent), you must still ensure code review happens by noting it in your PR description or requesting it explicitly.
