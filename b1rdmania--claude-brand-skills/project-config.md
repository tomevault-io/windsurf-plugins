# Claude Brand Skills Repository

Reusable skill system for brand development — from emotive narrative through packaged brand kit. Built to prevent AI-generated design convergence through process structure, not prescriptive prompting.

## Repository Structure

- `brand-skill/` — Complete 8-phase brand development system (Phases 0-7 + 5.5)
- `brand-skill/Workflows/` — Phase workflow files (00-Orchestrator through 07-Packaging)
- `brand-skill/Templates/` — Reusable markdown templates with semantic placeholders
- `brand-skill/Examples/sorted-brand-kit/` — Real-world example brand kit
- `brand-skill/SKILL-AUDIT.md` — Comprehensive audit from AutonoLabs execution
- `brand-skill/ADDENDUM-4-WEB-PRESENCE.md` — Convergence theory and evolutionary design process
- `art/` — Image generation workflows
- `canvas-design/` — Canvas/layout design with bundled fonts
- `frontend-design/` — Frontend design guidelines

## Version: v2.0 (February 2026)

**Convergence framework release.** Adds Phase 5.5 (Composition & Visual Identity) — evolutionary diverge/kill/mutate process to prevent generic layouts. Includes full theoretical framework on why LLMs revert to statistical mean in design.

Key additions:
- Phase 5.5: Composition & Visual Identity (anti-convergence evolutionary process)
- Tracing-first approach for Phase 3 (Mark Development)
- Font exploration step in Phase 4 (Wordmark)
- Color derivation process in Phase 5 (Design System)
- Light mode derivation, contrast validation, social assets, favicon pipeline
- Template placeholders replacing hardcoded Sorted.fund values

See `CHANGELOG.md` for full v2.0 release notes.

## Completed Project: InfraSingularity

**InfraSingularity Brand** (`projects/infrasingularity/`) — **ALL PHASES COMPLETE (0–7)**
- Institutional blockchain infrastructure provider
- Live: `https://infrasingularity-brand.vercel.app`
- Notion: `https://www.notion.so/3040d80f5eb781dcaa12dc35497dfdbd` — **fully updated, all 8 phases linked with images**

**Final deliverables:**
- `phase5.5-composition/index.html` — Splash → `/` (root)
- `phase5.5-composition/composition-final.html` → `/site`
- `phase5.5-composition/brand-kit.html` → `/brand-kit`
- `phase5.5-composition/vercel.json` — rewrites + alias config
- `~/Downloads/infrasingularity-brand-kit-v1.zip` — Full packaged kit

**URL structure (vercel.json rewrites):**
- `/` → splash (index.html)
- `/site` → main page (composition-final.html)
- `/brand-kit` → guidelines (brand-kit.html)
- All internal links use root-relative paths (`/`, `/site`, `/brand-kit`)

**Key decisions locked:**
- Mark: v11d (25-dot radial starburst)
- Wordmark: Outfit "Infra" Medium (500) + "Singularity" Light (300) — no purple dot
- Typography: Outfit (display) + Figtree (body/UI)
- Colour: #6B4FEC accent, #4CAF8C green, #F59E42 amber, #5B9EFF blue
- Aesthetic: 0 border-radius, sharp/geometric, institutional, dark-first
- Nav: 2px accent purple border-bottom (permanent)
- Hero CTA: amber button (`var(--amber)` bg, `#000` text, `white-space:nowrap`)
- Section colour coding: purple = infrastructure, green = protocols, amber = model, blue = investments
- Copy: sourced-only from real IS docs — no invented claims

## Completed Reference Project

**AutonoLabs** — Full 8-phase execution used to audit and improve the skill
- Live site: autonomolabs.vercel.app
- Completed all phases including Phase 5.5 (11 page variants, blur test, compositional identity)
- Generated SKILL-AUDIT.md and ADDENDUM-4-WEB-PRESENCE.md from this execution
- Example of evolutionary process: 5 structural variants → kill → 3 mutations → "The Specimen"

## Key Files

**Start here:**
- `brand-skill/Workflows/00-Orchestrator.md` — Master phase tracker, read first
- `brand-skill/SKILL.md` — Brand skill overview and routing
- `brand-skill/TOOLS-REQUIRED.md` — Prerequisites (vtracer, svgo, rsvg-convert)

**Theory:**
- `brand-skill/SKILL-AUDIT.md` — What works, what doesn't, lessons learned
- `brand-skill/ADDENDUM-4-WEB-PRESENCE.md` — Why LLMs converge + how to escape it

**Critical phase:**
- `brand-skill/Workflows/05A-CompositionIdentity.md` — Phase 5.5, prevents generic layouts

## MCP Servers

- **Notion** — `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp` (user scope) — for pushing brand outputs to Notion workspaces for client collaboration and review

## Process Overview (8 Phases)

0. **Emotive Narrative** → Grounding metaphor and emotional context
1. **Discovery** → Philosophy, positioning, visual philosophy
2. **Visual Direction** → Reference images or skip decision
3. **Mark Development** → Logo SVG (tracing-first approach)
4. **Wordmark** → Font exploration + lockups
5. **Design System** → Color derivation, typography, spacing, components
5.5. **Composition & Visual Identity** → Evolutionary diverge/kill/mutate for web presence
6. **DESIGN.md Creation** → Single source of truth
7. **Packaging** → Brand kit with all formats and sizes

Each phase has defined entry criteria, outputs, and gate checks tracked in `.brand-progress.md`.

## Key Principles

**Anti-convergence:**
- LLMs generate from the center of their training distribution
- Prescribing techniques just moves the convergence point
