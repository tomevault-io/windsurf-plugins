# Project Guidance

`mlx_atomistic` is the Apple-Silicon-native MD + DFT runtime built on MLX/Metal —
the product. OpenMM, LAMMPS, and everything under `vendors/` are reference and
validation surfaces only; they never replace the MLX runtime path.

## Environment

- `uv` runs everything. Prefer `uv run ...` / `uv sync ...` over system `python3`
  or global tools.
- Python 3.13, pinned by `.python-version`.
- Package source under `src/mlx_atomistic/`; prep/import tooling under
  `src/mlx_atomistic/prep/`.
- Notebooks live under `notebooks/` and import the package from the `uv` env.
- Treat `vendors/` as reference only — not dependencies, package inputs, or build
  targets unless a task explicitly moves that boundary.
- Do not add heavyweight chemistry or ML helper packages without a concrete need.

## Repository layout

    mlx-atomistic/        standard checkout and project root
    ├── .git/             normal Git metadata
    ├── src/              product package source
    ├── tests/            pytest suite
    ├── docs/             project and benchmark documentation
    ├── results/          local generated outputs, gitignored
    └── vendors/          local reference trees, gitignored

- Run Git, builds, tests, and edits from the repository root.
- `results/` contains local generated benchmark/science outputs and stays
  gitignored.
- `vendors/` contains local reference source trees and stays read-mostly unless
  a task explicitly moves that boundary.

## Worktree workflow

Use worktrees only when parallel branch isolation is worth the extra setup. From
the repository root:

    git worktree add ../mlx-atomistic-feat-x -b feat/x
    ln -s ../mlx-atomistic/vendors ../mlx-atomistic-feat-x/vendors
    cd ../mlx-atomistic-feat-x && uv venv --python 3.13 && uv sync --group dev

Tear down with `git worktree remove ../mlx-atomistic-feat-x` (never `rm -rf`).
Each worktree carries its own `.venv` and its own committed copy of this file.

## Multi-agent / parallel work

- Instruction context is per-agent, resolved from each agent's worktree root.
- Isolate agents that edit files in parallel into their own worktrees so changes
  never collide; merge back through normal Git history.
- Keep the `vendors/` reference-only boundary in every worktree.

## Documentation & docstrings

The docs site (`site/`) is split: hand-written narrative under
`site/src/content/docs/` (overview, foundations, mm, dft, benchmarks, project)
and an auto-generated API reference under `.../api/` produced from the package by
`scripts/gen_api_docs.py` (static Griffe parse, git-ignored, rebuilt on deploy).
The build also emits `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` for agentic consumption.
Never hand-edit the API pages — edit the docstrings.

- Public docstrings use **Google style**; `src/mlx_atomistic/core.py` is the
  exemplar to copy. Keep the house style of one blank line after the docstring.
- Three CI guards keep the docs honest (all green, no backlog): `ruff` **D101/
  D102/D103** require a docstring on every public class/method/function on the
  docs surface; **D417** fails if a documented `Args:` omits a parameter; and
  `gen_api_docs.py` exits non-zero if a docstring documents a parameter the
  signature no longer has. Run `ruff check src` and the generator before pushing.
- Presence is scoped to the documented API. `prep/`, `benchmarks/`, `tests/`, and
  `scripts/` are excluded (see `[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]`), matching the
  generator's SKIP set. Most docstrings are still one-line summaries; enrich them
  toward full `Args:`/`Returns:` and the page renders richer automatically.

## Communication

- Address the user as `My Love`.
