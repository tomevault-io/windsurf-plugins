# Integration Test Guidelines

- Keep tests deterministic and independent; avoid hidden cross-test state.
- Reuse `tests/integration/setup.ts` helpers and fixtures for authentication/project setup.
- Prefer assertions that verify behavior and contract shape, not implementation details.
- Name test cases by API behavior (list, get, create, update, delete, search) for scanability.
- When adding tests, cover happy path and at least one failure/validation scenario.

## Running Tests

- Run targeted tests first: `npm run test -- tests/integration/<file>.test.ts`.
- Run full suite before finalizing: `npm run test`.
