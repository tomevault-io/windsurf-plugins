# Memex — Project Context for Claude Code

## Product

Memex is a local-first, AI-native personal knowledge management app built with Flutter. Users capture text, photos, and voice recordings. A multi-agent system automatically organizes records into structured timeline cards, extracts knowledge, and generates cross-record insights.

All data stays on-device. Users bring their own LLM provider (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, AWS Bedrock).

### Core Capabilities
- Multi-modal input: text, images, voice recording with EXIF extraction and on-device OCR/labeling (Google ML Kit)
- AI-powered card generation: inputs are transformed into typed timeline cards (task, event, metric, person, place, gallery, etc.)
- Knowledge organization using P.A.R.A methodology (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- Insight engine: surfaces patterns across records as charts, narratives, maps, and timelines
- Conversational AI assistant for discussing cards and topics
- App lock with biometric authentication
- i18n: English and Chinese

### Target Platforms
- iOS (App Store: MemexAI)
- Android (GitHub Releases APK)

## Tech Stack

- Flutter (Dart ≥ 3.6, < 4.0), Material 3 with custom `AppTheme` in `lib/ui/core/themes/`

### Architecture
- MVVM with Provider for state management
- `ChangeNotifier`-based ViewModels created at the screen level, not registered globally
- `Command` pattern (Compass-style) for async operations with running/error/completed states
- Sealed `Result<T>` type (`Ok`/`Error`) for explicit error handling — no raw try/catch in ViewModels
- `MemexRouter` singleton acts as the central repository/service facade
- GoRouter for declarative navigation (`lib/routing/`)
- Dependencies registered in `lib/config/dependencies.dart` — only repositories/services, never ViewModels

### Database
- Drift (SQLite) with code generation; tables in `lib/db/tables.dart`, generated files: `*.g.dart`
- Local filesystem storage via `FileSystemService`

### AI / Agent System
- Multi-agent architecture using `dart_agent_core`
- Agents: PKM, Card, Insight, Comment, Memory, Persona, Super (orchestrator)
- Composable skills in `lib/agent/skills/`
- LLM client abstraction in `lib/llm_client/` supporting multiple providers
- On-device ML: `google_mlkit_text_recognition`, `google_mlkit_image_labeling`

### Key Libraries
- `provider`, `go_router`, `drift`/`sqlite3_flutter_libs`, `dio`/`http`, `web_socket_channel`
- `fl_chart`, `flutter_map`/`latlong2`, `image_picker`/`camera`/`photo_manager`
- `record`/`audioplayers`, `flutter_markdown`, `local_auth`, `health`/`pedometer`
- `workmanager`, `intl`, `google_generative_ai`

```

### Conventions
- Each UI feature has `view_models/` and `widgets/` subdirectories
- ViewModels extend `ChangeNotifier`, created at screen level via `ChangeNotifierProvider`
- Repositories are standalone functions or thin wrappers, accessed through `MemexRouter`
- Never edit `*.g.dart` files — they are generated
- Assets in `assets/`, platform code in `android/`, `ios/`
