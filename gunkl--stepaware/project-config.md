# Project AGENT PLAYBOOK

This repository expects any automation agent (Codex CLI, LLM assistants, scripted bots) to follow the rules below before delegating to folder-specific AGENTS guides. Treat this document as the global source of truth; per-directory `AGENTS.md` files (for example `agent/AGENTS.md`) extend these rules with additional constraints for their subtrees.

## Mission & Mindset

**Project Overview**: StepAware is an ESP32-C3 based motion-activated hazard warning system. See [README.md](README.md) for complete feature descriptions and user-facing documentation.

**Agent Mission**: Help developers build, test, and deploy this IoT safety device while maintaining code quality, security, and proper documentation.

## Development Workflow

### Building and Testing

**Using Docker (Recommended):**
```bash
# Build firmware
docker-compose run --rm stepaware-dev pio run -e esp32-devkitlipo

# Run C++ Unity tests (output to console)
docker-compose run --rm stepaware-dev pio test -e native

# Run Python logic tests with HTML reports (files appear in test/reports/ directory)
docker-compose run --rm stepaware-dev python3 test/run_tests.py

# Analyze test results from database
docker-compose run --rm stepaware-dev python3 test/analyze_results.py

# Upload to device (requires hardware connected)
docker-compose run --rm stepaware-dev pio run --target upload

# Monitor serial output
docker-compose run --rm stepaware-dev pio device monitor
```

**Note:** Docker volume mount (`.:/workspace`) ensures all test artifacts generated inside the container are immediately accessible in your local `test/reports/` directory. The container writes to `/workspace/test/reports/` which maps directly to your local filesystem.

**Native PlatformIO:**
```bash
# Build firmware
pio run -e esp32-devkitlipo

# Run C++ Unity tests
pio test -e native

# Run specific test suite
pio test -f test_state_machine

# Run Python tests with reports
python3 test/run_tests.py

# Analyze test history
python3 test/analyze_results.py

# Build with mock hardware
pio run -D MOCK_HARDWARE=1
```

### Implementation Phases

The project follows a 6-phase development plan:

1. **Phase 1**: MVP - Core motion detection ✅ (Current)
2. **Phase 2**: WiFi & Web interface
3. **Phase 3**: Testing infrastructure
4. **Phase 4**: Documentation & versioning
5. **Phase 5**: Power management
6. **Phase 6**: Advanced features (light sensing)

When implementing features, always check which phase they belong to and ensure prerequisites are met.

## Core Development Principles

### Code Quality
- **TESTING**: Create comprehensive automated tests for all features and workflows
  - Unit tests for individual components
  - Integration tests for subsystems
  - Assisted tests for hardware-dependent features
  - Mock hardware implementations for development without physical devices
  - After making code changes, always validate with local tests, and review the github pipeline for any failures.  Always provide a brief commit summary with markup to ensure github captures the github issue associated with the change.
- **CONFIGURABILITY**: All settings must be configurable via:
  1. Physical device controls (buttons)
  2. Configuration files on device
  3. Web interface (when WiFi enabled)
- **VERSIONING**: Maintain semantic versioning by component
  - Update versions on test runs, builds, or releases
  - Track version history in documentation
- **BUG PROCESS**: Follow systematic bug handling:
  1. Investigate and document the issue
  2. Always offer to create GitHub issue with analysis, summarize to the user what the github issue would be and ask for confirmation.
  3. Implement fix with tests
  4. Validate fix passes all tests, check github actions pipeline results from the run.
  5. Close issue with commit reference

### Testing Infrastructure
- **TEST REPORTING**: All test outputs are accessible locally after Docker runs
  - Test artifacts stored in `test/reports/` directory:
    - `test_results.db` - SQLite database tracking all test runs
    - `report_*.html` - HTML reports with visual results
    - `report_latest.html` - Symlink to most recent report
  - The entire `test/reports/` directory is excluded from git via `.gitignore`
  - Docker volume mount (`.:/workspace`) ensures files appear in local filesystem
- **Automated Testing**: Maximize test automation coverage
  - Python logic tests via `test/run_tests.py`
  - C++ Unity tests via PlatformIO (`pio test -e native`)
  - Mock simulator for interactive testing (`test/mock_simulator.py`)
  - Prefer unit tests over manual verification
  - Use mocks/stubs for hardware dependencies
  - Maintain >80% code coverage where practical


### Input Handling
- **Debouncing**: All user inputs must be debounced
  - Physical inputs: buttons, sensors
  - Virtual inputs: web server submissions, API calls
  - Use consistent debounce timing across the codebase

### Logging and Diagnostics
- **Robust Logging**: Logs must persist even if process is interrupted
  - Write logs promptly, don't buffer excessively
  - Support Ctrl+C graceful shutdown
  - Include timestamps and severity levels
- **Log Limits**: Prevent unbounded log growth
  - Implement rotation or size limits
  - Provide configuration for log verbosity
- **Failure Investigation**: When runs fail, always:
  1. Check relevant log files
  2. Look for error patterns
  3. Provide actionable diagnostics
  4. Suggest fixes when possible

## Security & Safety Guardrails

- **Credential Protection**: NEVER log or commit sensitive data
  - No credentials, API tokens, passwords in logs
  - No customer/user data in version control
  - Redact sensitive info if it appears in output
  - Alert developer if sensitive data detected
- **Authentication**: All remote access must be authenticated
  - WiFi web interface requires auth
  - SSH/HTTPS must use proper credentials
  - Support first-run setup or config file auth
  - Generate proper security keys for TLS/SSH

## Documentation Standards

### Documentation Hierarchy
- **README.md**: User-facing documentation
  - Project overview and features
  - Hardware setup and requirements
  - Quick start guides
  - Troubleshooting
  - API reference
- **AGENTS.md** (this file): Developer/agent guidance
  - Development workflows
  - Build and test procedures
  - Code quality standards
  - Agent-specific instructions
- **docs/**: Detailed technical documentation
  - Hardware schematics and wiring diagrams
  - Software architecture and flow charts
  - API specifications
  - Test plans and reports
- **datasheets/**: Reference materials (not in git)
  - Component datasheets
  - Specifications
  - Vendor documentation

### Keeping Documentation Current
- When adding features, update:
  1. README.md with user-facing details
  2. This AGENTS.md if workflow changes
  3. Relevant docs/ files for technical details
  4. Code comments for complex logic
- Create diagrams for:
  - Hardware wiring (schematic diagrams)
  - Program flow (flow charts)
  - System architecture (architectural diagrams)
- Update version numbers when shipping features

## Agent Workflow Guidelines

### When in Doubt
1. Read this document to confirm behavior aligns with guardrails
2. Check folder-specific `AGENTS.md` for specialized instructions
3. Review README.md for user requirements
4. Ask clarifying questions if conflicts arise
5. Never guess when safety or data integrity is at stake

### Collaboration with Developers
- Provide normalized, reusable outputs
- Use harmonized report layouts across tools
- Close the feedback loop:
  1. Investigate issues thoroughly
  2. Scaffold solutions with proper structure
  3. Run and validate results
  4. Capture lessons learned for future automation
- Suggest improvements when patterns emerge
