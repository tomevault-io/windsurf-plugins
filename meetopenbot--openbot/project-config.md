# OpenBot Context & Architecture

OpenBot is an extensible AI assistant ecosystem built on the **Melony** framework. It follows a "Manager-Agent" orchestration pattern to provide a powerful, multi-modal sidekick for developers and power users.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
- **Delegate by Default**: The central Manager Agent focuses on orchestration and memory, delegating specialized tasks (shell, browser, files) to dedicated agents.
- **Event-Driven**: All communication happens via an asynchronous event bus (Melony).
- **Extensible**: New agents can be added via YAML configuration, and new capabilities via Melony plugins.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 1. The Manager Agent
The central entry point. Its primary responsibilities are:
- **Orchestration**: Analyzing user intent and routing tasks to the correct agent using the `delegateTask` tool.
- **Memory**: Using the `memory` plugin to manage long-term memory (`remember`/`recall`).
- **Summarization**: Providing high-level, concise summaries of sub-agent activities.

### 2. Specialized Agents
Agents are workers that handle specific domains.
- **`os` Agent**: Handles shell commands and file system operations.
- **`browser` Agent**: (If installed) Performs web navigation and interaction.
- **`topic` Agent**: Background agent that automatically titles chat threads.
- **YAML Agents**: Defined in `~/.openbot/agents/*/AGENT.md`, they allow for custom prompts and tool configurations without code changes.

### 3. Key Plugins
Plugins provide the actual tools and logic used by agents.
- **`llm`**: The core LLM integration, handling completion and tool calling.
- **`memory`**: Agent definition and long-term memory management. Stores data in `~/.openbot/AGENT.md` and `~/.openbot/memory/`.
- **`shell`**: Secure terminal execution.
- **`file-system`**: CRUD operations on the local disk.
- **`approval`**: A middleware plugin that requires user confirmation for destructive or sensitive actions.

## 🔄 Common Workflows

### Task Delegation Flow
1. **User Input** → `agent:input` event.
2. **Manager Decides** → Calls `delegateTask(agent, task)`.
3. **Delegation Handler** → Emits `agent:input` to the sub-agent's runtime.
4. **Agent Execution** → Agent performs task, emits `agent:output`.
5. **Manager Bridge** → Manager catches output, reports results to user.

### Memory Workflow
1. **Action** → Manager calls \`remember(content, tags)\`.
2. **Storage** → \`memory\` plugin saves to local JSON.
3. **Retrieval** → Manager calls \`recall(query)\` to inject past context into its prompt.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/server`: Node.js/TypeScript backend core.
  - `/src/open-bot.ts`: Entry point where registries are initialized and the Melony app is composed.
  - `/src/plugins/`: Implementation of core functionalities (each folder should export a `plugin` object).
  - `/src/registry/`: Logic for loading and managing agents and plugins.
  - `/src/agents/`: Built-in agent implementations (e.g., `os-agent.ts`).
- `/web`: React/Vite dashboard for interaction.
- `/docs`: Detailed documentation on architecture and extensions.

## 🛠️ Development Guide: Adding Features

### 1. Adding a New Plugin
Plugins are the primary way to add new capabilities (tools) to OpenBot.
1. Create a folder in `server/src/plugins/<name>/`.
2. Define tool schemas using `zod`.
3. Create a `MelonyPlugin` factory that handles `action:<toolName>` events.
4. Export a `plugin` object with `name`, `description`, `toolDefinitions`, and `factory`.
5. Register it in `server/src/open-bot.ts` using `pluginRegistry.register()`.

### 2. Adding a New Agent
Agents are specialized personas that use plugins.
- **Built-in Agent**:
  1. Create a file in `server/src/agents/<name>-agent.ts`.
  2. Implement it using `melony()` and include an `llmPlugin`.
  3. Register it in `server/src/open-bot.ts` using `agentRegistry.register()`.
- **YAML Agent** (No code required):
  1. Create a folder in `~/.openbot/agents/<name>/` and an `AGENT.md` file within it.
  2. Define `name`, `description`, `model`, and `plugins` (referencing registered plugin names) in the YAML frontmatter.
  3. Write the instructions (prompt) as the Markdown body below the frontmatter.

### 3. Using Registry for Discovery
The `AgentRegistry` and `PluginRegistry` are used to:
- Dynamically build the Manager's `delegateTask` tool (it automatically lists all registered agents and their capabilities).
- Resolve plugin names in YAML agent definitions.
- Auto-wire event subscriptions for agents (e.g., if an agent subscribes to `agent:output`).

## 🎨 UI & Events
- **Status Updates**: Plugins should yield `memory:status` or similar events to show progress in the UI.
- **Dynamic Widgets (SDUI)**: Use `ui.event(widget(...))` to send dynamic UI widgets to the conversation history. See `.cursor/rules/openbot-sdui.mdc` for detailed guidelines.
- **Task Results**: Always yield `action:result` with the `toolCallId` to close tool-calling loops.
