# Melony Framework Guidelines

Melony is an event-based framework for building AI agents and Server-Driven UI (SDUI) applications. It follows a minimal orchestration loop: `Event → Handler → Events`.

This document describes the core `melony` runtime.

## Core Runtime

The `melony` package provides the core runtime and builder API for defining agents and handlers.

## Backend Development

### Creating an Agent
Use the `melony()` builder to define event handlers.

```typescript
import { melony } from "melony";

export const agent = melony()
  .on("agent:input", async function* (event, { runtime }) {
    // Logic here
    yield { type: "agent:output", data: { content: "Processing..." } };
    
    // Yield UI components
    yield { 
      type: "ui", 
      data: { 
        type: "card", 
        props: { title: "Result" },
        children: [{ type: "text", props: { content: "Done!" } }]
      } 
    };
  });
```

### API Routes (Next.js)
```typescript
import { agent } from "./agent";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { event } = await req.json();
  return agent.streamResponse(event);
}
```

## Best Practices

### Event Structure
Events should follow this structure:
```typescript
interface Event {
  type: string;
  data: any;
  meta?: {
    id?: string;
    runId?: string;
    role?: "user" | "assistant" | "system";
    // ...
  };
}
```

### Manager-Worker Pattern
For complex agents, use a Manager agent that delegates to Worker plugins.
- Use `delegateTask` tool in the Manager.
- Workers should yield a completion event (e.g., `agent:os:output`).
- The Manager's plugin should bridge this back to the tool result.

### State Management
- Use `context.state` within handlers to persist information across events in a single run.
- Use `suspend()` to halt execution for human-in-the-loop (HITL) scenarios.
