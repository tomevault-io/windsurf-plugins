# Traul

- The project is meant to be type-checked via Bun, not vanilla `tsc`.
- All changes must go through a PR — never push directly to `main`.
- New features and refactors must include tests. Follow TDD: write failing tests first, then implement until they pass.
- Bug fixes must include a test that fails before the fix and passes after.
- API changes (new commands, changed options, new output fields) must be documented in `skill.md`.
