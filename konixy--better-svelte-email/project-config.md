## Package Manager & Commands

### Use Bun Instead of npm/pnpm/yarn

- Always use `bun` instead of `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn` for package management
- Use `bunx` instead of `npx` for running packages
- If `bunx` fails, try `bun x` as an alternative

### Prioritize package.json Scripts

- Always check and use the scripts defined in `package.json` for:
  - Building: `bun run build`
  - Testing: `bun run test`
  - Development: `bun run dev`
  - Packaging and other tasks defined in the project
- Don't reinvent commands that already exist in package.json

### Working Directory

- Don't `cd` into the working directory before every command
- The shell is already in the correct workspace directory

### Testing Commands

- **Never** run `bun test` directly
- **Always** run `bun run test` to use the project's test script
- For specific test files or directories, run: `bun run test src/path/to/file`
