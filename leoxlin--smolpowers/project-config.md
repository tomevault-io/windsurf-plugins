# Repository Guidelines
- Keep the cross-agent runtime lightweight and evidence-driven across Design → Plan → Execute → Finish.
- Write all documentation in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English.
- Make all Smolpowers design and plan artifacts comply with ASD-STE100.
- Use `.smolpowers.json`; keep parsing, validation, path resolution, and defaults in `load-config.py`.
- Invalid or unsafe configuration must warn once and fall back atomically to all defaults.
- Test observable behavior and structured interfaces, not prose, headings, or static file substrings.
- Ignore `.smolpowers/` in code reviews unless the review is part of the Smolpowers SDD flow.
- Test skill behavior with Harbor tests, not unit tests.
- Use proportional TDD by default; strict mode requires an observed failing test before production code.
- Run focused tests via `mise run test:unit -- <paths>` and the full unit suite via `mise run test:unit`.
- Do not create unit tests for Harbor.
- Keep Harbor/model-backed fixtures isolated from the source repo; never commit or push from fixtures.
- Use conventional commit subjects (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
- Use release-please for releases; merge the release pull request to publish a release.
