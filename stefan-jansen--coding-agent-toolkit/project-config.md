# coding-agent-toolkit

Contributor / maintainer notes. For the project introduction, see
[`README.md`](README.md).

## Purpose

Provide a small set of host-neutral workflow steps — `align`, `plan`,
`plan-issues`, `next-issue`, `ship`, `handoff`, `continue` — that take
a piece of work from rough idea to done, identically on Claude Code
and OpenAI Codex. The chain owns the structural work around producing
the thing: clarifying what "done" means, breaking it into chunks,
accumulating references and constraints as they surface, tracking
progress, carrying memory across sessions and host swaps, and
projecting state onto GitHub for review and version control. Local
state for each piece of work lives in `.workspace/work/<unit>/` (spec,
plan, follow-up notes, references); GitHub is the public projection
(milestone / issues / branches / PRs / `Closes #N`). The dominant
deliverable is a merged PR; the chain drives non-code work too (a
research report, a course module, a long-form post) since the
projection doesn't care what the deliverable is. The actor is the
agent; this repository supplies the step definitions and the
file-shaped contract they share.

## Cross-host primitive

The contract that makes the toolkit host-neutral is **shared durable
state under `.workspace/`**, read natively by both Claude Code and
Codex. There is no orchestrator. Either host runs a step; the step
writes files; the other host picks the state up by reading the same
files.

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` (this file) | Canonical project instructions. Codex reads natively; Claude includes via `CLAUDE.md`. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | One line — `@AGENTS.md`. |
| `.workspace/memory/` | Persistent project memory; load on demand. |
| `.workspace/transitions/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS.md` | `/handoff` output; `/continue` resumes from any of these on either host. |
| `.workspace/work/` | Active work units (specs, plans, references, follow-up notes). |

Keep this contract tight. Never seed `.claude/transitions/` or
`.codex/state/` for new work; never invent a `run-as-other-host`
shortcut.

## Step chain

```
align         →  spec.md             (interrogation, or @brief.md seed)
plan          →  plan.md             (host-native plan mode, in-session
                                      or headless)
plan-issues   →  GitHub milestone + issues  (dry-run default; --apply)
next-issue    →  branch + impl + tests + PR  (lowest-numbered open
                                              issue in active milestone)
ship          →  squash-merge, close milestone  (verifies closing-footer
                                                 coverage)
handoff       →  .workspace/transitions/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS.md
continue      →  read latest transition, verify, surface next steps
                 (no auto-execute)
```

Six steps live on disk under `skills/<step>/`. `plan` deliberately
delegates to each host's native plan mode plus a capture hook — that
is the right primitive, and re-implementing it as a shell command
loses the structured plan-mode output.

## Three surfaces, one source

| Surface | Location | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical | `skills/<step>/SKILL.md` here | Source of truth. |
| Claude plugin mirror | `workflow/skills/<step>/SKILL.md` in the [coding-agent-plugins](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/coding-agent-plugins) marketplace | Byte-identical mirror; how Claude users install. |
| Codex prompt | `codex/prompts/<step>.md` here | Codex-shape mirror; `codex exec` invokes by name. |

When you edit a step, edit all three. Verify byte-identity between
canonical and the plugin mirror (`diff -q`). The Codex prompt may
shape the same contract differently in the markdown body, but its YAML
frontmatter must stay strictly parseable — Codex uses strict YAML and
will silently skip an invalid prompt.

## Hard constraints

1. **Host-neutral state.** Durable state lives in `.workspace/`. Never
   seed `.claude/transitions/` or `.codex/state/` for new work.
2. **Statelessness.** Each step invocation starts fresh. All carry-over
   is files on disk.
3. **Self-containment.** Step logic lives inline in the SKILL or prompt.
   No external script sourcing.
4. **Idempotency.** Steps are safe to re-run. `/continue` re-verifies
   on each call; `/ship` is a no-op when already shipped.
5. **MCP optional.** Steps use `gh`, `git`, and the filesystem. No MCP
   is required for a step to do its job.
6. **Verify durable files only.** `/handoff` verification snapshots
   list commit SHAs, milestone states, branch tips, skill / prompt
   inventories — never session-relative rotating files (e.g. `HH.md`).

## Session progress tracking

Write hourly progress under `.workspace/transitions/YYYY-MM-DD/HH.md`
(the project hook auto-creates the file). Append every 15–20 minutes
or at milestones. Run `/handoff` at end-of-session or when approaching
a context-budget cliff to produce the durable `HHMMSS.md` snapshot that
`/continue` resumes from.
