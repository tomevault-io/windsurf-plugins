# Guidelines

Those are guidelines for datatype implementation, including conversions. You should apply these when modyfing ODBC code and writing tests:

1. SQLBindCol
  - Write size of bound column into length buffer when length buffer is not null. Example test for SQL_C_LONG type
    ```cpp
    // Test that length buffer receives correct size
    SQLINTEGER value = 0;
    SQLLEN indicator = 0;
    ret = SQLBindCol(stmt.getHandle(), 1, SQL_C_LONG, &value, sizeof(value), &indicator);
    ret = SQLFetch(stmt.getHandle());
    CHECK(indicator == sizeof(SQLINTEGER)); // Length buffer should contain size of data
    ```
