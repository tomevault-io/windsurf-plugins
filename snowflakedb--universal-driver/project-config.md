# Environment Variables

When you run tests that require connecting to Snowflake manually, define environment variable:
PARAMETER_PATH=/[project_location]/parameters.json

Where [project_location] is the path to your project root.
Tests won't run without this variable.

There are also utils for testing - read the project README.md
