## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The Appalachian Trail Analysis & Visualization System consists of three core business components:

## Core Analysis Engine (src/analysis.py)
- Trail difficulty classification system using grade percentages (Easy 0-5% to Extreme >20%)
- Hiking time estimation with Naismith's rule variants for elevation changes
- Section-based difficulty analysis incorporating elevation profiles
- State-specific trail statistics computation

## Terrain Generation (src/data_loader.py)
- Geographic-authentic trail data generation
- Multi-frequency sine wave modeling for state-specific elevation profiles
- State-based terrain modeling with accurate:
  * Elevation ranges
  * Peak/valley distributions
  * Geographic sequencing across 14 AT states

## Trail Visualization (src/visualization.py)
- Elevation profile generation with state boundaries
- Difficulty distribution visualization
- State comparison metrics display
- Interactive elevation-based trail mapping

## Business Rules Integration
1. Grade-Based Difficulty Categories
- Five distinct difficulty levels based on trail grade percentages
- Integrated into analysis and visualization components

2. Time Calculation System
- Base speed calculations for flat terrain
- Elevation-based speed adjustments
- State-specific terrain factor integration

3. Geographic Authentication
- State mileage validation
- Elevation range verification
- State sequence enforcement
- Terrain pattern authenticity

## Analysis Pipeline (main_analysis.py)
- Trail data statistics calculation
- State-by-state breakdown analysis
- 5-mile window difficulty assessment
- Custom difficulty scoring implementation
- Thru-hike duration calculations with variable daily schedules

Importance Score: 90/100
