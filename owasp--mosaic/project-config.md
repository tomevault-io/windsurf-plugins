# Verifiable Goals

Agents need pass/fail checks to close the loop. Without verification, the human becomes the verification loop.

## Required checks (site / content / layout changes)

Run in order unless clearly irrelevant (explain why if skipped):

1. `npm run build:site` — Hugo must build with zero errors
2. `npm run serve` — optional visual spot-check at http://localhost:3000 when layout or CSS changed

## Required checks (scripts / workflow changes)

1. `npm run build:site` — ensure site still builds
2. If `scripts/set-hosting-retention.js` changed: dry-run logic review; do not run against production without credentials and explicit user request

## CI

When preparing or fixing a PR: all workflow jobs must be green.
Use `gh pr checks` or the GitHub Actions UI. Fix failures iteratively.

Deploy workflows build Hugo from `content/mosaic/` and publish `public/` to Firebase Hosting.

## Iterate until green

- If any check fails, fix the failure and rerun from the failed step.
- Do not hand off with failing checks unless blocked; document the blocker explicitly.
- Before commit (when user asks): all relevant checks must pass.

## Handoff evidence (mandatory)

Report what you ran and the outcome — not assertions:

```
npm run build:site  — passed (N pages)
npm run serve       — checked /roadmap.html (if applicable)
gh pr checks        — all green (if PR-related)
```

If a check failed, show the Hugo error, the fix, and the rerun result.
