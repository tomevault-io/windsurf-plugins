# Complete Ticket Requirement

When the user submits a ticket or task via a `.md` or `.txt` file (including `AGENTS.md`):

1. **Check** for: goal, success criteria, context, constraints — same rules as `requirements-gate.mdc`
2. **If missing** → ask clarifying questions; offer the **Requirements template** in `requirements-gate.mdc`; do NOT code
3. **If complete** → follow the decision tree in `multi-agent-workflow.mdc`:
   - Trivial (typo, rename, one-liner) → implement directly
   - Non-trivial → Plan Mode per `plan-first-workflow.mdc` or Phase 1 per `multi-agent-workflow.mdc` when both apply
   - Wait for approval before implementation when planning is required
4. **Never assume** missing details — see `never-assume.mdc`

Verification after implementation: `verifiable-goals.mdc`.

## Coding standards (not covered elsewhere)

- **Stack:** Hugo (markdown content + HTML layouts); CSS in `static/assets/styles.css`; Node scripts for deploy helpers.
- **Content:** Markdown with YAML front matter; layout via shortcodes in `layouts/shortcodes/`.
- **Clean edits:** Match existing shortcode and front-matter patterns on sibling pages.
- **Documentation:** For website tasks, follow and update `docs/website.md` when adding shortcodes or new page patterns.
