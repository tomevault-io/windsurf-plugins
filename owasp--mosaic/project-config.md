# Never Assume

| Do NOT | Instead |
|--------|---------|
| Assume file paths, shortcode names, or menu structure | Read `docs/website.md`; grep `content/mosaic/` |
| Add new dependencies without explanation | State why, alternatives considered, and get approval |
| Edit `content/mosaic/public/` | Build output is generated; edit source in `content/` and `layouts/` |
| Replace code with placeholders, TODOs, or stubs | Ship complete markdown, layouts, and styles |
| Write incomplete page content | Finish the page or stop and explain what's blocked |
| Commit or push unless asked | Wait for explicit user request |
| Commit secrets (`firebase-service-account.json`, tokens) | Use gitignored local files or CI secrets only |

## Scope and diff discipline

- Minimize scope — smallest correct diff; no drive-by refactors.
- Match surrounding naming, shortcode style, and documentation level.
- Comments only for non-obvious Hugo/template logic.
- Do not add markdown/docs files the user did not ask for.
- Do not use "made with cursor" or similar in commits.

## MOSAIC conventions

- Page content lives in `content/mosaic/content/*.md` only.
- Navigation lives in `content/mosaic/data/menu.yaml`.
- Internal links use ugly URLs: `/roadmap.html`, `/team.html`, etc.
- Images go in `content/mosaic/static/assets/` and are referenced as `/assets/filename.ext`.
- Use existing shortcodes before inventing new ones — see `docs/website.md`.
- Prefer `npm run build:site` over ad-hoc Hugo invocations.
