# Requirements Gate

If ANY of the following is missing or ambiguous, **STOP and ask clarifying questions**.
Do NOT write, edit, or delete code until the gaps are filled.

| Required | What to ask |
|----------|-------------|
| **Clear goal** | What outcome does the user want? What problem are we solving? |
| **Verifiable success criteria** | Which checks must pass? (Hugo build, CI, manual preview) |
| **Context references** | Which files, pages, or prior chats apply? Prefer `@path/to/file` refs when ambiguous. |
| **Constraints** | Out of scope, URL compatibility, no new deps, Firebase/deploy impact, etc. |

## Context references — when `@` refs are required

- **Satisfied without `@`** when the message names specific paths or pages clearly (e.g. "update the hero text on the home page in `content/mosaic/content/_index.md`").
- **Ask for `@` refs** when multiple files could apply, the shortcode/layout pattern to mirror is unclear, or prior chat/issue context is needed.

## Skip the gate only when

The request is fully specified in one sentence with obvious success criteria and unambiguous context, e.g.
"Fix typo in README line 42" or "Change the Roadmap subtitle in `content/mosaic/content/roadmap.md`."

## Requirements template (offer when info is missing)

```
## Task
<One-sentence goal>

## Success criteria (all must pass)
- [ ] `npm run build:site`
- [ ] Visual check via `npm run serve` (if layout/CSS changed)
- [ ] CI green (`gh pr checks` or Actions UI)
- [ ] Other: ___

## Context
- Files: @content/mosaic/content/roadmap.md
- Pattern to mirror: @content/mosaic/content/news.md
- Prior work: @Past Chats / issue # / PR #
- Editing guide: @docs/website.md (for website work)

## Constraints
- In scope: ___
- Out of scope: ___
- Dependencies: none / explain before adding
- Deploy: content-only / workflow / maintainer script
- Secrets: never commit service account JSON
```
