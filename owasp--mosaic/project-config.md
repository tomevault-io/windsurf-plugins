# Multi-Agent Workflow (Human Plan → Agent Execute)

For **big changes**, split work into two phases. Do not skip Phase 1.

## What counts as a big change

- New page, new shortcode library, or new site-wide layout
- Expected to touch **3+ files** or **>500 lines** of diff
- Refactor of Hugo layouts/shortcodes with behavioral risk
- Touches critical paths (deploy workflows, Firebase, maintainer scripts, secrets)
- Incomplete requirements or meaningful product/design choices

Small fixes: single-file typo, one markdown paragraph, clear one-liner → `plan-first-workflow.mdc` only.

## Phase 1 — Human-led planning (no code)

**Stop before editing.**

1. Acknowledge this is a big change; planning comes first.
2. Ask minimum questions: goal, pages affected, pattern to mirror, acceptance criteria, out of scope.
3. Draft a plan: steps, `@` file paths, similar pages/shortcodes, validation plan, risks.
4. Wait for explicit approval ("proceed", "approved", or confirmed edited plan).
5. No commits, push, or implementation code in Phase 1. Read-only research is fine.

## Phase 2 — Agent execution

After approval:

1. Execute per `autonomous-workflow.mdc`.
2. Follow the approved plan; pause if material deviation is needed.
3. Implement incrementally; verify as you go (`verifiable-goals.mdc`).
4. Hand off with checklist including build evidence.

## Builder ≠ Judge (required on substantive work)

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Builder** | Implements approved plan |
| **Judge** | Independent review — broken links, layout regressions, deploy impact |

Invoke judge via subagent, parallel agent, or fresh context:

- "Use a subagent to review this change for broken links and layout regressions."

Do not mark substantive work complete without independent review or documented reason to skip.

**Re-review:** Required only when judge findings change behavior, content, or deploy posture materially.
