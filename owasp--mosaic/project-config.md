# Plan-First Workflow

Apply before non-trivial edits. When criteria overlap with `multi-agent-workflow.mdc` (e.g. new page, 3+ files), follow **multi-agent** Phase 1 — it is the stricter superset.

## Skip planning only for

- Typos, renames, obvious single-line fixes
- Tasks fully specified with no design choices

## MUST plan before implementing when ANY apply

- New page, new shortcode, or new site-wide layout pattern
- Multi-file change (3+ files) or >500 lines expected
- Refactor of layouts/shortcodes with behavioral risk
- Touches critical paths (deploy workflows, Firebase config, maintainer scripts, secrets)
- Requirements have meaningful design choices

## Plan output MUST include

1. **Goal** — restated in one sentence
2. **Files** — exact paths to create/modify/delete
3. **Dependencies** — new npm packages, Hugo version, Firebase changes
4. **Steps** — ordered implementation sequence
5. **Content impact** — which markdown pages and menu entries change
6. **Edge cases** — broken links, missing assets, mobile layout
7. **Verification** — `npm run build:site`, optional `npm run serve`, CI
8. **Risks** — what could break and how to detect it

## Approval gate

After presenting the plan, **wait for explicit user approval** ("proceed", "approved",
or an edited plan confirmed by the user) before writing implementation code.

Read-only research (grep, read files, explore codebase, read `docs/website.md`) is allowed during planning.

Save approved plans to `.cursor/plans/<feature>.md` when scope is substantial.

## Before editing (Agent Mode)

- Brief plan with reasoning: goal, steps, files touched, validation approach.
- For website work, consult `docs/website.md` for shortcodes and file locations.

## While editing

- Only modify code relevant to the request.
- Never use placeholders — include complete, working content and templates.
- **Reference patterns specifically:** e.g. mirror `@content/mosaic/content/news.md` for a new list page, or `@content/mosaic/layouts/shortcodes/card.html` for a new shortcode.
