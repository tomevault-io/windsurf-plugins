# AGENTS.md

DeepSeek Harness is an all-plugin Cordis agent harness. Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before changing `packages/`; follow [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for documentation.

## Pre-stable APIs and released Session data

Public APIs are pre-stable; update every consumer. Follow [version/status](docs/session-format-status.md) and [type acknowledgements](docs/cookbook/reviewing-persistence-type-changes.md). [Adjacent migration](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-31-released-session-format-migrations.md) may add a version-named successor but never move, overwrite, or delete committed generations; predecessors imply neither fallback nor downgrade support. SQLite uses monotonic `SCHEMA_VERSION`.

Acknowledge [declared persistence-type changes](docs/cookbook/reviewing-persistence-type-changes.md).

Record each externally perceptible breaking change immediately in an [upgrade guide](.agents/skills/dsh-create-upgrade-guide/SKILL.md).

**Application launch.** Only `dsh` profiles launch supported Node apps; package bins, demos, and public SDK argv escapes are forbidden ([rule](docs/architecture.md#application-launch)).

## Commands

```sh
pnpm install            # pnpm workspaces, node ^22.19 || >=24
pnpm run clean           # remove build outputs and safe residue from deleted packages
pnpm run test           # unit tests
pnpm run test:coverage  # CI coverage gate: per-file 100% on packages/*/*/src
pnpm run test:e2e       # real-API tests; self-skip without DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
pnpm run test:expected  # owner-local process expectations
pnpm run test:snapshot  # keyless recorded-session replay through shipped profiles; filter: -t <name>
pnpm run test:snapshot:record  # re-record expected outputs (needs key)
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run duplication    # cross-file TypeScript clone detection
pnpm run build          # tsc emits lib/types, tsdown bundles runtime
pnpm run hygiene        # publint + workspace/package/dependency checks + NodeNext consumer check
pnpm run check:windows-wine  # ONLY when diagnosing a known Windows failure (needs wine); CI owns this signal
pnpm run doc-sync       # documentation gates (scripts/run-gates.ts)
pnpm run test:docs      # quick documentation checks (no build; doc-quick aggregate)
pnpm run website:build  # VitePress build (doubles as dead-link check)
