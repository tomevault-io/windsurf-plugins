# Agents Reference

The agent architecture is designed around **delegation** and **file-based persistence**. The primary agent orchestrates; subagents do the heavy lifting.

---

## Primary Agent

### `maintainer`

The orchestrator. Handles planning decisions, user interaction, and Git operations.

**What it does:**
- Loads skills automatically based on what you're asking for
- Delegates expensive exploration to subagents
- Keeps context lean by receiving digests instead of full outputs
- Persists everything to `docs/` and `plans/`
- Commits only when you ask

**When it works itself vs. delegates:**
- Works itself: planning decisions, user negotiation, and bounded low-risk changes in known files
- Delegates: codebase exploration, doc generation, implementation, reviews

### `maintainer-direct`

Non-interactive variant of `maintainer`. It uses the same routing, safety, testing, and planning rules, but asks questions only for genuine decisions and otherwise reports progress directly.

---

## Subagents

### `delegate`

The one canonical, skill-driven delegate persona. Skills provide task expertise, workflow, write boundaries, and output contracts.

**Typical tasks:**
- Codebase exploration
- Running commands (tests, builds, verification)
- Analyzing data or logs
- Quick lookups and research

**Write boundary:** `delegate` is read/analyze/verify by default. It may write skill-defined artifacts with explicit output paths/templates, such as reviews and implementation plans. Larger ad-hoc writes with undefined shape/targets should start with an informal Blueprint for primary approval. Code changes normally route to `implementer`; delegates do not perform Git operations.

After an implementation or implementation-plan review, `review-fix` is the preferred same-session remediation path for accepted related findings, including multi-file runtime changes. The review artifact remains unchanged. A new implementation or authoring session is reserved for changed scope/objective, missing context, new primary decisions, or an explicit fresh perspective.

**Model:** Configured via `config.yaml`. Defaults to provider's choice if not set.

**Why it exists:** The built-in `general` uses the provider's default model. `delegate` uses your configured model — cheaper, faster, and predictable for routine tasks.

### `doc-explorer`

Docs-focused subagent for project documentation and selected template-governed planning artifacts.

**Writes to:**
- `docs/` — project documentation
- `plans/` — selected framework planning artifacts when explicitly routed by relevant skills

**Does NOT write:** Code files or ad-hoc analysis writeups; use `delegate` for those. Implementation plans default to the canonical delegate via `author-and-verify-implementation-plan`.

**Used by:** `generate-docs`, `update-docs`, `create-plan`, `update-plan`, `generate-handover`

### `implementer`

Executes code changes following the gated protocol.

**Protocol:** BLUEPRINT → GATE → EXECUTE → DIGEST

**Does:**
- Proposes step lists (blueprint mode)
- Implements changes and runs verification (execute mode)
- Returns compact digests

**Does NOT:**
- Git operations (commit, push, rebase)
- Write to `docs/` or `plans/`

### `legacy-curator`

Handles legacy repo cleanup before generating fresh docs.

**Does:**
- Moves scattered documentation to `docs-legacy/`
- Generates `docs-legacy/summary.md`

**Does NOT:** Commit changes (you review and commit).

## Delegation Philosophy

### Scope and review posture

**No Gold-Plating. No Adversarial Reviewing. No Scope Creep.** Maintainers and
delegates should pursue evidence-backed problems, not invent improvements,
hunt for gotchas, or broaden the objective. Related files, call sites,
integration points, and tests remain discoverable when they are required for
accepted work. Real defects must still be reported and fixed.

### Why delegate instead of doing everything in the primary?

**Context limits.** The primary reads a lot during exploration — file contents, search results, tool outputs. Most of it isn't needed long-term. Delegating keeps the primary lean.

**Cost predictability.** Subagents run on your configured model. The primary can use a frontier model for planning; subagents can use cheaper models for routine work.

**Separation of concerns.** Subagents write according to workflow ownership: docs-focused artifacts, skill-defined review/implementation-plan artifacts, or gated code execution. The primary orchestrates and owns the conversation.

### When to use `delegate` vs `general`

| Agent | Model | Use when |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `delegate` | Your config | Default for routine tasks |
| `general` (built-in) | Provider default | User explicitly asks, or you want a different perspective |

### Stateful delegate reuse

The primary should resume an existing delegate `task_id` for follow-ups within the same analysis, review, or debugging thread. This includes loading `review-fix` after an implementation or implementation-plan review. Start a new delegate for changed scope, parallel work, model/variant changes, fresh independent opinions, or stale context. `task_id`s are session-local; durable continuity belongs in `docs/`, `plans/`, todos, and handovers.
