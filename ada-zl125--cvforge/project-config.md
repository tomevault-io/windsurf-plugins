# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Project Context

## Product

CVForge is a stateless browser based document builder for resumes, academic CVs, and cover letters. It has no user accounts and no database. Users create a document from the landing page, edit it in the matching editor, and export it when finished.

Document editing state, Agent Mode chat state, uploaded reference context, project instructions, context usage, and recent agent changes are stored in `sessionStorage`. A page refresh keeps the current tab state, while closing the tab starts a clean session next time.

LLM configuration and UI language preference are the only long lived user settings stored in `localStorage`.

Agent Mode helps users edit documents through structured tools. It supports clarification, undo, review highlights, project instructions, and local reference files. Deep Agents exposes uploaded references through a local virtual filesystem. Content read by the agent may be sent to the configured model provider.

## Current State Model

- Editor document state uses `sessionStorage`.
- Agent chat state uses `sessionStorage`.
- Agent graph state uses `MemorySaver` within reusable browser runtimes.
- Uploaded references use the Deep Agents `StateBackend` virtual filesystem.
- LLM configuration uses `localStorage`.
- UI language preference uses `localStorage` through `useSyncExternalStore` to avoid hydration mismatch.
- Resume and academic CV support English and Chinese document modes.
- Cover letters currently support English document mode only.

## Agent Mode Notes

- Agent orchestration lives in `lib/agent/chat.ts`.
- Tool definitions live in `lib/agent/tools.ts`.
- Provider chat model configuration lives in `lib/agent/model.ts`.
- Provider detection and thinking protocol selection live in `lib/agent/providers.ts`.
- Pure document updates live in `lib/agent/executor.ts`.
- Agent session state lives in `lib/agent/session-state.ts`.
- Context usage extraction lives in `lib/agent/context-usage.ts`.
- Agent text and document language normalization lives in `lib/agent/text-normalization.ts`.
- Keep agent UI components separate from agent state and tool execution logic.


# Development Workflow

Before implementing a feature, follow this workflow:

1. Create an issue for the task. Keep the issue title and description concise, clear, and focused.
2. Create a branch for the issue, such as `feat/preprocessor` or `experiment/baseline-solution`. Do all related work on this branch.
3. Analyse the problem and implement the required code or file changes.
