# bioshock-vr - Claude session guide

Native VR mod for BioShock Remastered: a 32-bit DLL injected via an `xinput1_3.dll` proxy shim,
hooking the game's D3D11 renderer and Vengeance-engine (UE2.5) camera/aim paths, driven by an
OpenXR session (Quest 3 via Virtual Desktop/VDXR or Steam Link/SteamVR). Architecture is a
game-agnostic VR core plus per-game adapters so BioShock 2 Remastered (same engine) can follow.

## Hard rules

- **NEVER commit game-derived content**: no decompiled UnrealScript, no extracted assets, no
  RenderDoc captures, nothing from the game folder. `tools/uscript/` is gitignored for a reason.
  Summarize findings in `docs/ENGINE_NOTES.md` instead of pasting game code.
- **Commit messages**: plain conventional commits (`feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`/`build:`/`tools:`/`chore:`),
  imperative, subject ≤72 chars. No trailers.
- **32-bit (Win32) only.** The game is x86. The CMake guard will stop you; don't fight it.
- **No code from UEVR** (all-rights-reserved - concepts only). REFramework (MIT) may be adapted
  with an attribution comment in the file.
- Engine addresses/signatures live ONLY in `src/game/bioshock1r/patterns.cpp` (per-game), and every
  one is documented in `docs/ENGINE_NOTES.md` with its derivation method.

## Session protocol

- **START**: read `docs/STATUS.md`, then the current milestone in `docs/ROADMAP.md`, then
  `git log --oneline -10`.
- Touching engine internals? Read `docs/ENGINE_NOTES.md` first. New findings go there, in the
  same commit as the code that uses them.
- Non-obvious design choices get a dated entry in the decision log at the bottom of
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **END**: rewrite the "Current state" and "Next steps" sections of `docs/STATUS.md`, append a
  dated session-log entry, tick `docs/ROADMAP.md` boxes, commit, push. A session that ends
  without pushing STATUS.md is a failed handoff.

## Build / install / test

```powershell
.\tools\build.ps1            # Debug build. CMake is NOT on PATH - script finds the VS-bundled one via vswhere
.\tools\build.ps1 -Release
.\tools\build.ps1 -Install   # build + copy DLLs to the game folder
.\tools\install.ps1          # copy already-built DLLs to the game folder
.\tools\tail-log.ps1         # follow %LOCALAPPDATA%\BioshockVR\bioshockvr.log
```

- Game: `K:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\BioShock Remastered\Build\Final\BioshockHD.exe`
  (32-bit, D3D11, no DRM; Steam appid 409710). Launch through Steam; add `-allowconsole` to
  launch options for the Tab console.
- Full test procedures (incl. Quest 3 / Virtual Desktop setup): `docs/TESTING.md`.
- Clean clone needs `git clone --recursive` (submodules in `third_party/`).

## Repo map

- `src/proxy/` - thin xinput1_3 forwarding shim that loads the real mod DLL
- `src/core/` - game-agnostic VR core (framework, hooks, gfx, vr, stereo, input, ui, util)
- `src/game/` - `igame_adapter.h` + per-game adapters (`bioshock1r/` first)
- `third_party/` - pinned submodules: minhook, imgui, OpenXR-SDK
- `tools/` - build/install/uninstall/log scripts, `uscript/` decompile workspace (gitignored)
- `docs/` - the project's brain; see index below

## Docs index

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/STATUS.md` | **Session handoff**: current state, next steps, blockers, session log |
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | Milestones M0–M10 with acceptance criteria and checkboxes |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Module design, core/adapter contract, stereo strategy, decision log |
| `docs/RESEARCH.md` | All research findings with sources (engine, prior art, VR runtimes, legal) |
| `docs/ENGINE_NOTES.md` | Reverse-engineering knowledge base: signatures, offsets, class layouts, hook points |
| `docs/TESTING.md` | How to install, launch, verify each milestone; VR setup; crash triage |
