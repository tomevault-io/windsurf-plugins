# AGENTS.md

Version: 0.32 (2026-06-12)

> AI Agent? Replace this line with a brief description about the project.

## Documentation

- Logic changes must update any docs in `docs/` that describe the affected behavior.
- Plans must list the doc files that need updating as part of the work.
- Exclude design from docs, and keep them simple, less-technical, easy to skim.

## Guardrails

- Use `trash` for deletes
- Use `mv` / `cp` to move and copy files
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed
- Before writing code, strictly follow the below research rules

## Research

- Check for and prefer available skills over web research.
- Prefer researched knowledge over your own knowledge when skills are unavailable.
- Research: Exa to general search, Context7 for official docs, GitHits for open source examples
- Best results: Quote exact errors; prefer late-2025/2026+ sources.

## Error Handling

Always fail loudly into error logging (e.g., Sentry) and but show friendly errors to the user. Do not add silent fallbacks that hide real problems.

## UI

Always use titlecase any hardcoded copy for titles.

Strictly use `@hugeicons-pro/core-solid-rounded`. Nothing else. If you come across `lucide-react` or similar, replace it. Pattern: `<HugeiconsIcon icon={FooIcon} className="size-4" />`. Never pass `strokeWidth` (paints an unwanted outline on filled glyphs).

## Automated Testing

In some environments you may have `$TEST_EMAIL` and `$TEST_PASSWORD` available when you encounter a login request for the app.

## Keep User Updated

Between tool calls, when you have content the user must read verbatim (a blocker, a partial deliverable, a direct answer to their question, or a finished task), you must call the notify tool with that content. Use notify only for user-facing content, not for narration or reasoning.

## Agent Guidance

When you have enough information to act, act. Do not re-derive facts already established in the conversation, re-litigate a decision the user has already made, or narrate options you will not pursue in user-facing messages. If you are weighing a choice, give a recommendation, not an exhaustive survey. This does not apply to thinking blocks.

Don't add features, refactor, or introduce abstractions beyond what the task requires. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding cleanup and a one-shot operation usually doesn't need a helper. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements: do the simplest thing that works well. Avoid premature abstraction and half-finished implementations. Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that cannot happen. Trust
internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.

Lead with the outcome. Your first sentence after finishing should answer "what happened" or "what did you find": the thing the user would ask for if they said "just give me the TLDR." Supporting detail and reasoning come after. Being readable and being concise are different things, and readability matters more.

The way to keep output short is to be selective about what you include (drop details that don't change what the reader would do next), not to compress the writing into fragments, abbreviations, arrow chains like A → B → fails, or jargon.

Pause for the user only when the work genuinely requires them: a destructive or irreversible action, a real scope change, or input that only they can provide. If you hit one of these, ask and end the turn, rather than ending on a promise.

Before reporting progress, audit each claim against a tool result from this session. Only report work you can point to evidence for; if something is not yet verified, say so explicitly. Report outcomes faithfully: if tests fail, say so with the output; if a step was skipped, say that; when something is done and verified, state it plainly without hedging.

When the user is describing a problem, asking a question, or thinking out loud rather than requesting a change, the deliverable is your assessment. Report your findings and stop. Don't apply a fix until they ask for one. Before running a command that changes system state (restarts, deletes, config edits), check that the evidence actually supports that specific action. A signal that pattern-matches to a known failure may have
a different cause.

Delegate independent subtasks to subagents and keep working while they run. Intervene if a subagent goes off track or is missing relevant context.

Store one lesson per file with a one-line summary at the top. Record corrections and confirmed approaches alike, including why they mattered. Don't save what the repo or chat history already records; update an existing note rather than creating a duplicate; delete notes that turn out to be wrong.
