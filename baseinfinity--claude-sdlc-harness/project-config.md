# Codex Review Guidelines

## Project Overview

Meta-repository — SDLC Harness documentation, automation, and a zero-dep Node.js CLI (`cli/`). Primary codebase is bash scripts + YAML workflows. The CLI distributes hooks, skills, and settings via `npx agentic-sdlc-wizard init`.

- `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md` — The main wizard document
- `.github/workflows/` — CI, PR review, weekly/monthly automation
- `.claude/hooks/` — SDLC enforcement hooks (fire every interaction, ~100 tokens each)
- `.claude/skills/` — Detailed guidance invoked by Claude (sdlc, setup)
- `tests/` — Bash test scripts (Layer 1 logic + Layer 5 E2E)
- `cli/` — npx distribution CLI (zero-dep Node.js)

## AI Setup Lanes

This repo recommends four setup lanes — Setup A (Opus 5 + Fable advisor, GPT-5.6 Sol high reviewer, recommended default, trial as of 2026-07-24), Setup B (Sonnet 5 Simple/One-Off: Fable advisor, Sonnet 5 medium driver, GPT-5.6 Sol high reviewer), Setup C (OpusPlan Hybrid: Opus 5 plan mode + Sonnet 5 execute, GPT-5.6 Sol high reviewer), and Setup D (Claude Lite: Sonnet driver, no reviewer). See [`AI_SETUP_LANES.md`](AI_SETUP_LANES.md) for the full pick list.

The lanes are guidance, not a hard rule — maintainer override is always allowed.

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. SDLC Compliance
- Does the change follow SDLC principles (plan, test, review)?
- Is there evidence of planning for complex changes?
- Are tests included or updated?

### 2. Security
- Shell injection in bash scripts (unquoted variables, eval, backtick expansion)
- YAML injection in workflow files (untrusted `${{ }}` in `run:` blocks)
- Secrets exposure (API keys, tokens in logs or comments)
- Unsafe variable interpolation (use `env:` blocks for LLM-generated content)

### 3. Code Quality
- Simple and readable?
- Over-engineered? (KISS principle — this project deletes legacy code aggressively)
- Follows existing patterns? (check similar files before suggesting new approaches)

### 4. Testing
- New features tested?
- Tests are meaningful (not just for coverage)?
- Testing diamond: integration > unit with mocks
- Test scripts use `set -e`, `pass()`/`fail()` helpers, exit 1 on failure

### 5. Blast Radius — know what SHIPS before weighting a finding

`package.json`'s `files` lists: `cli/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md`, `AI_SETUP_LANES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

**`files` is NOT the whole answer — npm always includes `README.md` and `package.json` regardless.** Verify with `npm pack --dry-run` rather than reading `files`; that is the authority. This exact omission caused a real miss: stale effort guidance in `README.md` was treated as repo-local and shipped anyway.

**Ships to every consumer — weight findings here highest:**
- `hooks/` → SDLC enforcement in every installed repo. A silently-inert hook here is a P0-class defect: it looks installed and does nothing.
- `skills/` → SDLC guidance everywhere. Must stay byte-identical to `cowork/skills/` (see `tests/test-cowork-drift.sh`) and under the 20,000-byte ceiling (`tests/test-audit-session-load.sh`).
- `cli/` → the installer. A defect here breaks setup for new users.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md`, `AI_SETUP_LANES.md`, **`README.md`** → the shipped guidance consumers act on. README ships despite its absence from `files`.

**Repo-local, ships to nobody — real, but lower stakes:**
- `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/settings.json`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `ROADMAP.md`, `AGENTS.md`

An earlier version of this section listed only the `.claude/` paths and omitted the shipping ones entirely, which inverted the priority. Do not restore that.

If a change affects SDLC behavior, check whether a relevant scenario exists in `tests/e2e/scenarios/`.

## Code Review Rules

Durable standards for `codex review`. Codex loads this section automatically — everything above applies too, this is what has bitten us repeatedly and is worth stating as rules.

1. **A test that greps for text is not a test of behavior.** This repo has shipped guards that assert on a script's source rather than executing it. Across one 2026-08 session, reviewers found nine assertions passing against broken code, a rule that accepted `1,2,1,2` silently, and a guard that read *nothing* from the file it guarded while all 15 of its fixture assertions stayed green. Flag any new assertion that greps where it could execute.

2. **Fixtures prove a rule works on documents shaped like the fixtures.** Require at least one assertion against the real artifact — mutate it and confirm the rule reports it. Absence of that canary is what let the vacuous guard above survive three review rounds.

3. **Prefer positive anchors to denylists.** Asserting "the defining line says X" is winnable. Asserting "no bad phrasing appears anywhere" is not — the synonym space is unbounded, and three rounds of adding alternations each ended with a reviewer naming another. Flag new denylists that guard an open-ended vocabulary.
