# Strava CLI Skill

Query and manage Strava data via the `strava` CLI.

## Prerequisites

- Install CLI: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eddmann/strava-cli/main/install.sh | sh`
- Authenticate: `strava auth login` (requires `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`, `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`)

## Quick Context

Get aggregated athlete data in one call:

```bash
strava context                          # Full context: athlete, stats, gear, clubs, activities
strava context --activities 10          # More recent activities
strava context --focus stats,gear       # Specific sections only
```

## Commands

Run `strava --help` or `strava <command> --help` to discover all options.

### Activities

```bash
strava activities list [--after DATE] [--before DATE] [--limit N]
strava activities get <ID>
strava activities streams <ID> [--keys time,distance,heartrate,watts]
strava activities laps <ID>
strava activities zones <ID>
strava activities comments <ID>
strava activities kudos <ID>
```

### Athlete

```bash
strava athlete              # Profile
strava athlete stats        # YTD and all-time totals
strava athlete zones        # HR/power zones
```

### Segments & Efforts

```bash
strava segments get <ID>
strava segments starred
strava segments explore --bounds SW_LAT,SW_LNG,NE_LAT,NE_LNG
strava efforts get <ID>
strava efforts list --segment-id <ID>
```

### Routes, Clubs, Gear

```bash
