# About Peek

Peek is a Figma-like database GUI where users place nodes of different types on an infinite 2D canvas. The UI is TypeScript + React 19 in Tauri 2, and talks to the host through a WASM bridge to Rust functions that own all database I/O.

# Stack

- **UI**: React 19 (with the React Compiler enabled — do not add manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` unless you've verified the compiler can't handle it), TypeScript, Vite.
- **Canvas**: `@xyflow/react` for the node graph.
- **State**: `jotai`. App-wide atoms live in `src/state.ts`; canvas atoms in `src/canvas/state.ts`.
- **UI kit**: `@mantine/*`, `@tabler/icons-react`.
- **Editor**: `@monaco-editor/react`.
- **AI**: `@langchain/core` + `@langchain/ollama` (local models).
- **Host bridge**: `@tauri-apps/api` and Tauri plugins (`fs`, `sql`, `dialog`, `opener`).
- **Tooling**: `oxlint` (lint) and `oxfmt` (format). No ESLint, no Prettier.

# Code style

## General

- Avoid nested `if`s; keep cyclomatic complexity low. Return early.
- Prefer immutability — chain `const` declarations rather than mutating locals.
- Use full words for identifiers (`truncatedString`, not `truncString`).
- TypeScript: never widen to `any`; prefer `unknown` and narrow. Use `import type { … }` for type-only imports.
- Named exports only. No default exports.
- CSS: Use nested rules rather than having everything top level.

## Proximity principle

Code that changes together should live together. Group by feature, not by file type — never create catch-all `utils/`, `types/`, or `helpers/` folders that collect files solely by kind.

- **Folders are features.** A folder describes one thing (a node, a tool, a feature) and contains everything that thing needs: its component, hooks, helpers, types, and `.css`. See `src/canvas/nodes/Result/` — `ResultNode.tsx` sits next to `ResultTableRow.tsx`, `useColumnWidths.ts`, `stringify.ts`, and `Result.css` because they all serve the result node.
- **Single-consumer helpers stay co-located.** A hook, sub-component, or util used by exactly one parent belongs in the parent's folder (e.g. `ChatInput.tsx` lives in `Chat/` next to `ChatNode.tsx`). Don't lift it to a shared location "just in case."
- **Promote only when crossing feature boundaries.** A second consumer inside the same feature is fine — keep the helper where it is. Move it up the tree only when a consumer outside the feature needs it. Shared canvas hooks live in `src/canvas/hooks/`; truly cross-cutting pieces live in `src/`.
- **Declare variables next to their use.** The exception is a setup block that computes several values before a derivation — group those together at the top of that block, not scattered through the function.
- **When a file grows, split within the folder first.** Extract a child component or hook into a sibling file before reaching for a new top-level directory. The folder absorbs the complexity; the import graph stays local.

## Composability

Components stay thin. Push advanced logic into hooks (see `src/canvas/nodes/Chat/` — `ChatNode.tsx` is the shell, `useChatStream` / `useChatTools` / `useChatContextSync` carry the logic). Prefer extracting a child component over piling more responsibility into the parent.

## Functions

Small and self-contained. At most three parameters; if you'd reach for a fourth, take a single options object instead (see `useChatStream({ nodeId, runPrompt, handlers })`).

## Comments

Comments explain **why**, never **what**. Only write one when the reason is non-obvious — a hidden constraint, a workaround, a subtle ordering requirement. If removing the comment wouldn't confuse a future reader, don't write it.

# Conventions specific to this codebase

## State (jotai)

- Atoms prefixed with `_` (e.g. `_documentBaseAtom`) are private to their module. Always go through the exported wrapper atom — it carries side-effects (mutation listeners, remote-sync gating) that the raw atom does not.
- Persisted user state uses `atomWithStorage`. Don't reach into `localStorage` directly.

## Canvas nodes

- One folder per node type under `src/canvas/nodes/<NodeType>/`. The entry component is `<NodeType>Node.tsx`; co-locate its hooks in the same folder as `useFoo.ts`.
- Node bodies that scroll must mark themselves `nodrag` and use `useScrollFallthrough` so wheel events don't pan the canvas.
- Mutate node data via `canvas.updateNodeData<TData>(id, updater)` from `useCanvas()`. Don't reach into the document atom directly from a node.
