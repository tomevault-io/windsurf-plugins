# Output hygiene: chat vs repository

Junior agents mix **conversation** with **artifact**. That produces slop, breaks trust, and can leak content that should not be there.

## Golden rule

| Surface | Allowed | Not allowed |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Chat** (response to the user) | Light tone, humor, echoing the user's urgency | - |
| **Repo** (commit, PR, README, docs, HANDOFF, memory, comments, CHANGELOG) | Technical fact, decision, next step | Meta-language, gossip, personal motivation, "the agent thought..." |

Product documentation (README, `docs/`, ADRs, runbooks): besides this rule, follow **[docs-professional-standard.mdc](docs-professional-standard.mdc)**, a professional, inheritable standard with no transient references (people, unrelated projects, session).

If the user brings urgency or personal context into the chat:

- **Chat:** fine to acknowledge ("got it, prioritizing this").
- **Commit / HANDOFF / doc / memory:** professional and **about the project** only. Never repeat an insult, people politics, or drama.

## Forbidden in any versioned artifact

1. **Agent meta-language** - "as an AI...", "in my reasoning...", "I'll use the tool...", "chat context...".
2. **Internal reasoning** pasted into markdown, code comments, or commits.
3. **Gossip, insults, people politics.**
4. **Venting or emotional motivation** used as a technical justification.
5. **Transient references** - people, projects that are not this repo, orgs unrelated to the product, client workspace IDs. Prefer omitting them or using a generic domain term.
6. **Commits that narrate the chat.**
7. **Em dash ("-") as a sentence connector** in commit messages, PRs, docs, README, HANDOFF, memory, or comments. It reads as AI slop; replace with a hyphen, colon, comma, or parentheses. Eliminate it entirely; only keep it when quoting external text/data/API literally. See the `clean-code` skill (pattern 6).

## Required

- Conventional Commits with a **technical** rationale.
- HANDOFF: phase, to-dos, operational instruction.
- Memory: symptom, cause, solution, tradeoff, no personal names.
- Code comments: invariants, not conversation.
- Product docs: project voice, timeless, inheritable (`docs-professional-standard`).

## Quick test

> "If a stranger opens this on GitHub tomorrow, or a maintainer a year from now, is it embarrassing or useless without the chat?"

If yes, rewrite it.

## Relation to other rules

- **docs-professional-standard** - the project's inheritable documentation standard (write-time voice + read-time delivery truth: docs are indicative).
- **code-deslop / clean-code** - code slop.
- **ux-tone** - light tone, chat only.
- **security-review** - secrets.
