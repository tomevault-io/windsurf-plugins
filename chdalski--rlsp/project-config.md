# The Rust Language Server Project

A collection of language server implementations written in Rust, built entirely by AI agents. No human-written application code — every line of source is authored, reviewed, and committed by AI. The purpose is to provide users with small, fast implementations with minimal memory footprint.

## Build and Test

### Rust

```sh
cargo fmt              # format
cargo clippy --all-targets  # lint (zero warnings enforced)
cargo build            # build
cargo test             # run all tests
cargo bench            # run benchmarks (Criterion)
cargo clean            # clean stale build artifacts
```

> After a Rust toolchain change (e.g. a `rustup` update or bumping the
> pinned `channel` in `rust-toolchain.toml`), run `cargo clean` before
> trusting a clippy result — the incremental clippy cache does not re-lint
> unchanged code, so it silently under-reports lints introduced/tightened
> by the new toolchain. CI does clean builds, so an incremental local pass
> is not equivalent.

### VS Code Extension

```sh
cd rlsp-yaml/integrations/vscode
pnpm install       # install dependencies
pnpm run build     # bundle extension (esbuild)
pnpm run test      # run unit tests (vitest)
pnpm run test:integration  # run VS Code integration tests (requires display; use xvfb-run -a on Linux)
pnpm run typecheck # typecheck without emitting (fast local gate; test:integration also runs tsc)
pnpm run audit     # pnpm audit gate (low+ severity; pre-existing dev-only lows allowlisted via pnpm.auditConfig.ignoreCves)
pnpm run lint      # lint TypeScript source
pnpm run format    # check formatting (prettier)
```

### Zed Extension

```sh
cargo check --manifest-path rlsp-yaml/integrations/zed/Cargo.toml --target wasm32-wasip2
cargo clippy --manifest-path rlsp-yaml/integrations/zed/Cargo.toml --all-targets --target wasm32-wasip2 -- -D warnings
```

### Claude Code Plugin

```sh
claude plugin validate --strict rlsp-yaml/integrations/claude-code  # validate plugin.json / .lsp.json
claude plugin validate --strict .                                  # validate the repo-root marketplace.json
cargo test -p rlsp-yaml --test claude_code_stdio_smoke              # LSP initialize/didOpen smoke test
```

## Components

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `rlsp-fmt/` | Generic Wadler-Lindig pretty-printing engine |
| `rlsp-yaml/` | YAML language server |
| `rlsp-yaml/integrations/claude-code/` | Claude Code plugin for rlsp-yaml |
| `rlsp-yaml/integrations/vscode/` | VS Code extension for rlsp-yaml |
| `rlsp-yaml/integrations/zed/` | Zed extension for rlsp-yaml |
| `rlsp-yaml-parser/` | Spec-faithful streaming YAML 1.2 parser |

## Conventions

<!-- Agents: add non-obvious project conventions discovered during work — things a future agent would need to know to avoid mistakes. One line each. Remove when no longer true. -->

- Workspace lint inheritance — root `Cargo.toml` defines `[workspace.lints]`, crates inherit via `lints.workspace = true`
- Clippy pedantic + nursery at warn; selected lints at deny; `warnings = "deny"`
- Maximum TypeScript strictness — `tsconfig.json` extends `@tsconfig/strictest`, ESLint uses `strictTypeChecked` + `stylisticTypeChecked`
- Automated releases via release-plz; tag format: `<package>-v<version>`. VS Code extension uses CalVer tags: `vscode-v<YYYY.MM.NN>`; Zed extension uses semver tags: `zed-v<semver>`
- Agents must not edit `version = "..."` fields in any `Cargo.toml` — release-plz owns version progression from conventional commits; milestone bumps (e.g., 0.x → 1.0) are user-directed and applied as a single deliberate commit
- Conventional commits required — changelogs auto-generated via git-cliff
- OIDC trusted publishing to crates.io — no `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret needed
- pnpm as Node.js package manager
- AI-written project — external contributions via GitHub issues only
- Each `rlsp-<language>` crate must have `README.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/feature-log.md`
- Root `README.md` is landing page; crate `README.md` is self-contained for users; `docs/configuration.md` is pure settings reference; `docs/feature-log.md` is user-facing feature decisions only — internal refactors and implementation rewrites do NOT go there (commit history + plan files carry that record)
- Workspace path dependencies must include a `version` field — `cargo publish` rejects path-only deps
- Use `#[expect(lint, reason = "...")]` instead of `#[allow(lint)]` — enforced by `allow_attributes = "deny"` and `allow_attributes_without_reason = "deny"` in workspace lints
- `clippy.toml` at the workspace root configures test-specific lint allowances (`allow-unwrap-in-tests`, `allow-expect-in-tests`, `allow-panic-in-tests`, `allow-indexing-slicing-in-tests = true`) — `unwrap_used`, `expect_used`, `panic`, and `indexing_slicing` do not need `#[expect]` suppression in test code
