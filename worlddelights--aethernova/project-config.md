# Overview

Project AetherNova - Another name considered aethnervola.

Here is a comprehensive set of specifications for an exploration-focused, WebGPU-based peer-to-peer voxel engine designed to support multiple, physically distinct universes.

## Core Vision

A massively scalable, in-browser voxel engine utilizing WebGPU for compute-heavy raymarching and physics. The platform is designed as a federated, decentralized network of "universes," where players explore and morph their avatars rather than engage in combat or competition. The architecture relies on WebRTC/WebTransport for peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, ensuring the server acts merely as a signaling relay, not a physics authority.

## Technical Stack

* **Rendering & Compute:** WebGPU (WGSL Compute Shaders, Raymarching).
* **Local Processing:** WebAssembly (Wasm) compiled via Rust/C++, utilizing SIMD and SharedArrayBuffers for terrain generation.
* **Networking:** WebRTC DataChannels (primary P2P transport) or WebTransport (for reliable/unreliable stream multiplexing if browser support permits).
* **Local Storage:** Origin Private File System (OPFS) for fast, synchronous chunk loading/saving.
* **Signaling Server:** Lightweight Node.js/Go server for P2P connection brokering (STUN/TURN handling).

## 1. Engine & Rendering Architecture

* **Structure:** Sparse Voxel Directed Acyclic Graphs (SVDAGs) stored in WebGPU Storage Buffers, allowing massive scale by deduplicating identical regions of space.
* **Rendering:** 100% Compute Shader Raymarching. No triangle rasterization. Uses a low-resolution brickmap pre-pass for hierarchical frustum culling to ensure only relevant 3D space is evaluated.
* **Scale:** Variable voxel sizing based on LOD depth, allowing transitions from massive macro-structures down to granular micro-details.

## 2. Construction & Automata Mechanics

To enable the creation of visually stunning, self-contained mechanisms, the engine supports voxel-level programmable logic.

* **3D Cellular Automata:** Voxels can act as logic gates or cellular machines. A compute pass evaluates a voxel's state based on its immediate Moore neighborhood (the surrounding 26 voxels). This allows players to build massive, self-propelling engines, rhythmic light structures, or automated sorting systems entirely out of static blocks.
* **SDF Catalysts (The Player Tool):** The player Avatar acts as a volumetric catalyst (Defined by a Signed Distance Field). Instead of placing blocks one by one, the player projects localized mathematical rules (e.g., "crystallize," "decay," "attune") that interact with the environment, sculpting structures dynamically.

## 3. Explored Physics Prototypes (To Be Tested)

These concepts represent the initial suite of modular rules to test in the prototype sandbox:

* **Dimensional Bitmasking (Visibility & Collision):** Voxels and players share a `strata_mask`. Collision and rendering evaluate `(voxel.mask & player.mask) != 0` as a hyper-fast $O(1)$ bitwise check. Allows overlapping, non-interfering structures and realities in the same physical space.
* **Adhesion & Decay Kinetics:** Replacing gravity with surface tension. Matter drifts linearly until it contacts a structure, calculating an attachment bond ($A_{bond}$) based on surface area and material type. Bonds can decay over time or via heat, causing massive structures to dynamically calve, fracture, and drift apart.
* **State Simplification:** Elimination of continuous gaseous states. The universe relies strictly on Solids (permanent adhesion) and Liquids (instant adhesion with rapid decay, causing material to "crawl" over surfaces).

## 4. Decentralized Multiplayer Architecture

* **Signaling Relay:** A lightweight server (Node/Go) that handles spatial brokering (matching players in proximity) and WebRTC/WebTransport STUN/TURN handshakes. It holds no physics authority.
* **P2P State Authority:** The first player to load a macro-region acts as the temporary host, processing the Wasm generation and syncing the initial SVDAG.
* **Delta Syncing:** Peers transmit only state changes (e.g., "Voxel at $X,Y,Z$ changed from state A to B") via WebRTC DataChannels, keeping bandwidth minimal.

## 5. Avatar & Player Mechanics

The player is not a fixed humanoid model. The core entity is a "Consciousness Point" (an energy spark), which can dynamically manipulate its physical manifestation based on the environment.

### The Morphing System

* **The Spark:** The baseline avatar. Capable of high-speed, frictionless movement through low-density mediums.
* **Resonance Forms:** By interacting with specific voxel types, the player can absorb their properties to build a temporary physical shell.
* *Example:* Absorbing "Heavy Silicate" allows the avatar to sink to the bottom of liquid methane oceans and interact with high-pressure switches.
* *Example:* Absorbing "Aero-Gel" expands the avatar's volume, allowing them to ride thermal updrafts or float in low gravity.

* **Volumetric Avatars:** Avatars are constructed from voxels dynamically. When morphing, compute shaders generate the new avatar shape via signed distance fields (SDFs) transitioning between states.

## 4. Networking: Decentralized Multiplayer
