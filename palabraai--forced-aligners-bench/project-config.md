# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A benchmark that ranks forced aligners (Qwen3-ForcedAligner, Seamless UnitY2, WhisperX) **without ground-truth timestamps**. Methodology: run each aligner, crop audio at its word boundaries, re-transcribe every crop with Whisper large-v3-turbo, compute WER. Tighter alignment ⇒ lower WER. See `README.md` for the full rationale and `RESULTS.md` for the last published numbers.

## Commands

```bash
# Install (monorepo — the top-level pyproject.toml installs everything)
pip install -e .

# Download FLEURS test split for EN/ES/FR/RU/KO
bash get_data.sh

# Extract alignments with ONE aligner on ONE language (multi-GPU capable)
python extract_alignment.py cache/data/fleurs/en/test/meta.csv \
    -a qwen3 -l en -g 0 -g 1 -p 3        # -g is repeatable, -p = procs/GPU

# All aligners × all downloaded languages
bash run_aligners.sh

# Benchmark (requires meta.{aligner}.csv files to already exist in test_dir)
python bench_alignment.py cache/data/fleurs/en/test/ \
    -s "1,-1" -l en --batch-size 64 --filter-perfect --strict

# Benchmark all downloaded languages with the headline config
bash run_transcribe.sh
```

There is **no test suite, no linter, and no CI** at the repo root. Sub-package `pyproject.toml` files under `aligners/*/` are provenance from upstream (Poetry) — they are *not* installed; the root `pyproject.toml` (hatchling) installs `aligners/` and `dataprep/` as the two packages.

## Architecture

The pipeline is two-stage, split across two top-level scripts that communicate only via CSV files on disk:

1. **`extract_alignment.py`** reads `meta.csv` (columns: `path_abs`, `transcription`), fans out rows over GPUs via `multiprocessing.Process` (each worker sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` itself before importing torch models), runs one aligner, and writes `meta.{aligner}.csv` beside the input — same rows + an `alignment` column holding a JSON list of `{word, start, end}`. Workers write `.part_{gpu}_{pid}.csv` shards that `merge_parts()` stitches back into the original row order.

2. **`bench_alignment.py`** discovers *all* `meta.{aligner}.csv` files in a test dir by filename convention (`ALIGNER_TYPES = ["qwen3", "whisperx", "seamless"]`), builds a flat list of `CropTask`s across aligners × slice specs × rows, loads a single Whisper model, and transcribes every crop batched. `--filter-perfect --strict` keeps only utterances where *every* aligner reconstructed the ground-truth transcript exactly (intersection on `path_abs`) — this is the fair-comparison mode that produces the headline numbers. Without `--strict`, each aligner is filtered independently (easier, incomparable across aligners).

### Aligner interface (the extension point)

All three aligner classes expose the same shape, and `extract_alignment.py` depends on it:

```python
aligner(audio, transcript, language) -> (pd.DataFrame[word, start, end, ...], raw_result)
```

- `ALIGNER_REGISTRY` in `extract_alignment.py` maps CLI keys (`qwen3`, `whisperx`, `seamless`) to classes. Adding a new aligner means: (a) new class with `__init__(device=...)` and `__call__(audio, transcript, language)`, (b) one line in the registry, (c) append to `ALIGNER_TYPES` in `bench_alignment.py` so it's discovered.
- Aligners are imported via `sys.path.append` of `aligners/<name>/` in `extract_alignment.py` — the three sub-packages are **not** on the normal Python path; they're siblings of the top-level package and the script inserts their directories. If you move files, update the `sys.path.append` lines at the top of `extract_alignment.py`.
- Each aligner normalises mixed audio inputs (path / dict / ndarray / tensor) to 1-D float32 @ 16 kHz in its own `prepare_audio()`. Keep that behaviour when editing — `align_single()` hands paths in directly.

### Vendored sub-packages (`aligners/*/`)

- **`aligners/qwen3/qwen3_asr/`** — trimmed copy of QwenLM/Qwen3-ASR (Apache-2.0). The actual Qwen3 model package is one level deeper at `aligners/qwen3/qwen3_asr/qwen_asr/`; `aligner.py` does `sys.path.insert(0, ...)` to reach it, then `from qwen_asr import Qwen3ForcedAligner`. Model weights fetch at runtime from HF (`Qwen/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B`).
- **`aligners/whisperx/patched_whisperx/`** — derivative of `m-bain/whisperx@b2d50a02` (BSD-2-Clause). Monkey-patches `transformers.utils.import_utils.check_torch_load_is_safe` at import time (CVE-2025-32434 guard); also `import_without_prints` silently strips `print()` calls from whisperx internals. Don't remove those patches without checking why they exist. Upstream whisperx is pulled from GitHub via the sub-pyproject — but that sub-pyproject is **not** the install surface; the actual whisperx dep lives under `wtpsplit` in the root `pyproject.toml`.
