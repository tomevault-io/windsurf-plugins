# Building and Running the Local `chi` CLI

It is crucial to run the **local** version of the `chi` command to test changes made in the workspace, as simply running `pnpm chi` may incorrectly execute a globally installed version if one exists.

## Correct Execution Method

1.  **Build the Project:** Compile the TypeScript source code into JavaScript.
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
2.  **Run the Built Script Directly:** Execute the entry point script using `node`. This bypasses any PATH resolution issues.
    ```bash
    # From the project root directory
    node ./bin/run.js [command] [flags]
    ```
    *Example:* To run the default command in a specific directory:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/target/directory && node /path/to/cursor-history/bin/run.js
    ```

## Alternative (Using npm Scripts)

The scripts defined in [`package.json`](mdc:package.json) (like `pnpm default`, `pnpm extract`, `pnpm search`) are generally configured to run the local version correctly after a build.

```bash
pnpm default # Runs the default command using the local build
```

## Why Avoid `pnpm chi`?

Running `pnpm chi` directly can be unreliable because:
- Your shell's `PATH` environment variable might find a *globally* installed `chi` (e.g., in `~/Library/pnpm/`) before the one linked by pnpm in the local `node_modules/.bin`.
- This means you might unknowingly execute an older or different version of the tool, leading to confusing results when testing local changes.

## What about `pnpm exec chi`?

While `pnpm exec chi` *should* explicitly target the local binary in `node_modules/.bin`, direct execution via `node ./bin/run.js` after building is the most guaranteed way to run the exact code from your workspace.
