# Cursor History (chi) CLI Tool Overview

This CLI tool extracts and manages conversation history from the Cursor AI editor's SQLite databases.

## Key Functionality
- Extracts conversations to markdown files.
- Filters conversations by the current workspace directory name.
- Searches conversations interactively.
- Exports the latest conversation.

## Project Structure
- **Entry Point:** [`src/index.ts`](mdc:src/index.ts) (Uses oclif for command handling)
- **Core Logic:** [`src/db/extract-conversations.ts`](mdc:src/db/extract-conversations.ts)
- **Build Output:** `dist/` (Compiled JavaScript)
- **Executable Script:** [`bin/run.js`](mdc:bin/run.js) (Imports from `dist/` and executes oclif)
- **Configuration:** [`package.json`](mdc:package.json), [`tsconfig.json`](mdc:tsconfig.json)

## Database Locations (macOS Example)
- **Global DB:** `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` (Contains global conversations and workspace metadata links)
- **Workspace DBs:** `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/<hash>/state.vscdb` (Contains workspace-specific settings and conversation composer IDs)
- **Workspace Metadata:** `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/<hash>/workspace.json` (Links workspace hash to folder path)

## Core Logic Flow (Workspace Filtering)
1.  Get the current directory name (e.g., "my-project").
2.  The function `getWorkspaceComposerIds` in [`src/db/extract-conversations.ts`](mdc:src/db/extract-conversations.ts) searches `workspaceStorage` by:
    - Reading each `<hash>/workspace.json`.
    - Parsing the `folder` URI (e.g., `file:///path/to/my-project`).
    - Comparing the folder name/path with the current directory name.
3.  If a match is found, it extracts composer IDs from the corresponding workspace database (`workspaceStorage/<hash>/state.vscdb`).
4.  **Identified Bug:** The `getConversationsForWorkspace` function *currently* takes these IDs but incorrectly tries to fetch the full conversation data from the **global** DB (`globalStorage/state.vscdb`) instead of the specific **workspace** DB (`workspaceStorage/<hash>/state.vscdb`).
5.  If no workspace conversations are found (due to the bug or no match), it falls back to the latest conversation in the global DB.

## Commands
- `chi` (default): Tries to export the latest conversation for the current workspace, falls back to global latest.
- `chi --extract`: Extracts all conversations (currently likely only global due to the bug).
- `chi --search`: Interactively search conversations.
