# Mobile Design Skills

This repository contains two opinionated mobile design skills — one for **iOS Liquid Glass** (iOS 26) and one for **Android Material 3 Expressive** (Android 16). Each skill guides creation of distinctive, platform-native app interfaces that avoid the generic "template app" aesthetic.

## Repo Structure

```
AGENTS.md                              ← you are here (repo-level agent onboarding)
CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md                 ← symlink for Claude Code compatibility
README.md                              ← human-facing documentation
LICENSE
.claude-plugin/
  plugin.json                          ← Claude Code plugin manifest
  marketplace.json                     ← Claude Code marketplace catalog
mobile-design-ios/
  SKILL.md                             ← iOS design skill (Liquid Glass, SwiftUI, UIKit)
mobile-design-android/
  SKILL.md                             ← Android design skill (M3 Expressive, Jetpack Compose)
```

## How to Use

Each `SKILL.md` is self-contained with no external references directory. Pick the skill matching your target platform:

- **`mobile-design-ios/SKILL.md`** — iOS 26 Liquid Glass design language, SwiftUI and UIKit patterns
- **`mobile-design-android/SKILL.md`** — Android 16 Material 3 Expressive, Jetpack Compose patterns
