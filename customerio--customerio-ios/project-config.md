This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# Customer.io iOS SDK - Developer Guide

After completing planned changes to the code, ALWAYS build the code to make sure it's working, before continuing to the next step.
After making changes to Unit Tests, ALWAYS test the changed test classes. Avoid testing the whole module or the whole SDK, unless absolutely necessary.

## Commands
- Build single module: `xcodebuild -scheme MessagingPushAPN -configuration Debug -workspace ./.swiftpm/xcode/package.xcworkspace -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=SIMULATOR_ID' -allowProvisioningUpdates build`
  - More details in the section `Building` below
- Test single file (with xcodebuild): `xcodebuild test-without-building -workspace ./.swiftpm/xcode/package.xcworkspace -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=SIMULATOR_ID' -scheme Customer.io-Package -only-testing:TestSuiteName/TestClassName`
  - More details in section `Testing` below
- Format: `make format` (run before lint)
- Lint: `make lint`
- Generate code and mocks: `make generate`
  - After `make generate`, always run `make format` first and then `make lint`

## Code Style
- Swift 5.3+ with protocol-oriented design
- Naming: CamelCase for types, camelCase for properties/methods
- Descriptive method names (e.g., `identify`, `registerDeviceToken`)
- Always use a constructor-based dependency injection pattern, and use `DIGraphShared` only for top-level module initialization
- Modular architecture (Common, DataPipeline, MessagingPush, etc.)
- Document public APIs with doc comments
- Always add doc comments to Protocol, no matter if those are public or internal. When component implements protocol, do not repeat the same docs.
- Error handling: prefer `throws`/`do-try-catch`, but use Result types when existing code is using it
- Avoid force unwrapping (!) except in tests
- Always prefer `weak` over `unowned` for weak type of references. `unowned` could easily produce a crash if the lifecycle between components is changed.
- Keep classes/structs/enums/actors small and with a single responsibility
- Keep methods small and focused

## Prohibited Actions
- DO NOT manually edit any `.generated.swift` files
- DO NOT expose internal modules to end users
- DO NOT modify Package.swift unless asked for
- DO NOT commit configuration files with actual credentials
- DO NOT include files with credentials in the context sent to the model
- DO NOT put credentials in generated code, and instead always put a placeholder (even when credentials are available from some other files)
- DO NOT use iOS features unavailable in iOS 13 unless compatibility fallback is included. Always point out when a post iOS 13 feature is added.

## Memory considerations
- In the capture list, for closures, be explicit and capture only what is needed, not the entire `self`
- Type usages:
  - Use structs (value types) for data models when possible
  - Use classes (reference types) when identity or inheritance is needed
  - Prefer value semantics for API boundaries to avoid unexpected side effects
- Resources clean up:
  - Implement `deinit` for classes that need cleanup
  - Cancel any async operations in `deinit`
  - Dispose of resources explicitly when needed (e.g., file handles, network connections)
- Document memory ownership expectations in public APIs
- Design APIs to make the correct memory pattern obvious to users

## Thread safety
- Prefer high-level concurrency models (Swift Concurrency) over low-level ones (GCD)
- Avoid `sync` operation in GDC unless no alternative. Always point out when `sync` is included in generated code.
- Prefer Actor over DispatchQueue unless it produces significant performance degradation
- Ensure UI operations happen on the main thread
- Design with immutability in mind for concurrent operation
- Create clear boundaries between thread-safe and thread-unsafe components
- Design APIs that help prevent thread safety issues
- When testing concurrent code, include stress tests
- Document the threading model clearly, especially for the SDK's public APIs

## Committing and Pushing with Git
- Use `lefthook` for git hooks
  - Install with `brew install lefthook`
  - Configure with `lefthook install`
- Before doing a commit, ensure that pre-commit from `.lefthook.yml` is installed
- Before doing a push, ensure that pre-push from `.lefthook.yml` is installed

## Project Structure
- `Sources/` - Main SDK code organized by modules:
  - `Common/` - Shared core functionality
  - `DataPipeline/` - Customer identification and event tracking
  - `MessagingPush/` - Base push notification functionality
  - `MessagingPushAPN/` - Apple Push Notification implementation
  - `MessagingPushFCM/` - Firebase Cloud Messaging implementation
  - `MessagingInApp/` - In-app messaging functionality
  - `Migration/` - Migration tools for version upgrades
  - `Templates/` - Sourcery templates for code generation
- `Tests/` - Test files organized by module
- `Apps/` - Sample applications demonstrating SDK usage

## Architecture

### Module Architecture
- Each module exposes a public-facing facade extending `ModuleTopLevelObject`
- Implementation classes are hidden from SDK users
