# AGENTS.md — set up an AEON Bench Pod

> Read this first. It gets the pod **installed and running** on a host. Once it's up, follow
> [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) to actually deploy + operate benchmarks. Harness internals live in
> [`deploy/pod/AGENTS.md`](deploy/pod/AGENTS.md); the judging methodology lives in the
> mothership's `AGENTS.md` (you don't need it to run a pod — the pod judges deterministically).

## What this is

The **pod** is the appliance you run on your own hardware to benchmark a model through a
controlled, verifiable pipeline and submit an attested result:

```
pull (HuggingFace) → verify weights (LFS sha256 + manifest) → serve (recorded recipe)
→ benchmark (text · agentic ×3 harnesses · vision · audio · arena · perf)
→ sign (ed25519 device key) → submit → mothership (aeon-bench.com)
```

Attested runs are eligible for the global leaderboard. Pointing at an endpoint you already
serve gives a **self-reported** run (useful locally, never globally ranked).

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** + the **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** (for GPU serving). `docker run --rm --gpus all …`
  must work. The harness images are built on first run, so BuildKit should be enabled (default).
- A **GPU** to serve the model under test — *or* an existing OpenAI-compatible endpoint to point at.
- Outbound HTTPS to `huggingface.co` (pull weights) and to your mothership (submit).
- Optional native path: **Python 3.11+** (`pip install -r mvp/requirements.txt`).
- **~2× the model's disk size** free for the verified weight snapshot + HF cache.

## Fastest path — one command (Docker Compose)

```bash
cp deploy/pod/.env.example .env      # then edit .env
#   AEON_HF_LINK=org/Your-Model            # the model to benchmark
#   AEON_MOTHERSHIP=https://aeon-bench.com # where to submit (default already points here)
#   HF_TOKEN=hf_…                          # only for gated/private repos
docker compose -f deploy/pod/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

What happens: the `pull` step resolves the HF link, downloads + **hash-verifies** the weights;
the engine serves them on the fixed alias `model-under-test`; the pod benchmarks that alias —
**spinning up a fresh agentic-harness container per task** (Hermes / OpenClaw / OpenCode, built
from latest upstream on first `up`) — then submits the signed bundle. The first build takes a
few minutes (three harness images); later runs reuse them.

> **DGX Spark / GB10:** set `AEON_SYSTEM=dgx-spark` and use the first-party engine image
> `ghcr.io/aeon-7/aeon-vllm-ultimate:latest` (DFlash speculative decoding). See its startup
> guide at `github.com/AEON-7/vllm-ultimate-dgx-spark`. **Serve ≥64K context** (`--max-model-len
> 65536`) — the Hermes harness rejects models reporting a <64K window.

## Native path — the pod dashboard (GUI)

```bash
cd mvp && pip install -r requirements.txt
AEON_ROLE=pod python serve.py         # http://localhost:8080
```

Open the dashboard and use the **Run** tab: point at a running model for a quick local run, or
paste a HuggingFace link for a one-button **verified** run. It shows live per-category progress
and streams the prompt/answer feed. Saved API keys / HF tokens are stored only in this pod.

## Config surface (`.env` / environment)

| var | meaning |
|---|---|
| `AEON_HF_LINK` | HF repo id or URL of the model under test (verified flow) |
| `AEON_MOTHERSHIP` | mothership base URL to submit to (default `https://aeon-bench.com`) |
| `AEON_HARDWARE` | label recorded with the run, e.g. `"NVIDIA DGX Spark GB10 128GB"` (else auto-detected) |
| `AEON_SYSTEM` | `dgx-spark` to force the `aeon-vllm-ultimate` recipe |
| `AEON_JUDGE` / `_URL` / `_KEY` | optional frontier judge for Tier-1 (else deterministic-only; never self-judges silently) |
| `HF_TOKEN` | gated/private HF repos |
| `AEON_MAX_TOKENS` | generation cap (reasoning models need headroom; default 2048) |
| `AEON_LIMIT` | first-N cases only (quick smoke) |

## State that persists (don't delete)

- **`~/.aeon/device_key.pem`** — the pod's ed25519 identity, enrolled with the mothership once.
  Deleting it re-enrolls as a new device. (Mounted as the `pod-state` volume in compose.)
- `~/.aeon/pod.db` — your local run history (the dashboard reads it live).

## Verify the install

```bash
cd mvp
python -m pod.aeon_pod --help          # the runner CLI
# smoke: 4 cases against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (self-reported, not ranked)
python -m pod.aeon_pod --target http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1 --model <served-name> \
  --mothership "$AEON_MOTHERSHIP" --limit 4
```

Next: [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) — deploy + operate a full benchmark.
