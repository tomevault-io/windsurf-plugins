# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

Discord bot application that monitors Minecraft server deaths via FTP log parsing and announces them in Discord channels. Built for small friend groups with focus on simplicity and reliability.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript with Node.js 18+
- **Discord**: discord.js for bot framework and slash commands
- **Log Access**: FTP client for real-time Minecraft server log monitoring
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL database for all data persistence (DATABASE_URL required)
- **Config**: dotenv for environment variable management

## Architecture Principles

- Single feature focus with planned leaderboard extension
- Database-only data storage with PostgreSQL (store timestamps as UTC)
- All client-facing timestamps displayed in New York time (EST/EDT)
- Event-driven Discord bot architecture
- Graceful error handling without crashes
- 30-second rate limiting per player
- Log position tracking to prevent duplicate announcements
- Daily scheduled announcements at 11:59 PM EST

## Core Entities

- **DeathEvent**: Player death with timestamp, cause, experience level
- **Player**: Persistent death statistics, rate limiting data, and activity tracking
- **DailyLeaderboard**: Ranked player death counts with survival champion
- **SurvivalChampion**: Longest-surviving active player (within 7 days)
- **DiscordChannelConfig**: Channel settings for announcements
- **FtpConfig**: FTP server connection details for log access
- **LogProcessingState**: Tracks processed log positions across restarts
- **LeaderboardConfig**: Daily announcement scheduling and state

## Key Implementation Notes

- Use Discord embeds for structured death announcements
- All Discord timestamps display in New York time (EST/EDT) using TimezoneUtils
- Database stores all timestamps as UTC for consistency
- FTP log parsing every 10 seconds for accurate death detection with real causes
- Rate limit: ignore deaths <10 seconds apart from same player
- Comprehensive death message parsing with regex patterns
- Environment variables for all secrets (tokens, passwords, FTP credentials, DATABASE_URL)
- Auto-reconnection logic for FTP connections
- Database persistence prevents duplicate announcements on bot restart
- PostgreSQL required for all data storage - no JSON fallback

## Testing Guidelines

When testing functionality with `npm start`:

- Start the bot and inform the developer what action needs to be performed
- Wait for the developer to perform the test action (e.g., player death, join/leave)
- Do NOT use timeout commands or assume events will happen automatically
- Let the bot run until the developer indicates the test is complete
- Then stop the bot and analyze the logs for the expected behavior

Example: "I'll start the bot now. Please have a player die in-game to test the death recording functionality. Let me know when you're ready for me to stop the bot and check the results."

## Constitutional Requirements

- Keep implementation simple and focused
- All client-facing timestamps must be displayed in New York time (EST/EDT)
- Database storage uses UTC timestamps for consistency
- No testing framework (just make it work)
- Friend-focused design with intuitive operation
- Graceful error handling and safety measures
- Minimal dependencies and straightforward code

## Development Priorities

1. ✅ FTP log parsing and death detection with accurate causes
2. ✅ Discord bot setup and embed messaging
3. ✅ Data persistence and rate limiting
4. ✅ Error handling and reconnection logic
