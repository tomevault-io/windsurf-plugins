# amplitude-builder-skills — Agent Guide

The best agent skills for product managers, analysts, engineers, marketers, and other AI-enabled "builders" as built or curated by the Amplitude team. Use this as your agent operating system when supercharging your workflows in Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Cursor, OpenAI Codex, and other agent harnesses.

## Principles

1. **Specificity over vagueness.** "Everyone in healthcare" is not a customer. "Sarah, the ops manager running a 50-person team at a mid-market health tech company" is. Push for specifics in every skill.
2. **Behavior beats interest.** Waitlist signups and "that's interesting" aren't demand. Payment, panic when it breaks, and workflow dependency are. Challenge stated interest with behavioral evidence.
3. **Completeness over shortcuts.** When AI makes the marginal cost of thoroughness near-zero, always choose the complete version — full acceptance criteria, all edge cases, every open question surfaced.
4. **Challenge premises before solutions.** The best PM work questions whether the problem is worth solving before designing the solution. Skills should push back on weak thinking, not just format it nicely.

## When to Suggest Skills

Proactively suggest a skill when the user's intent matches — don't wait for them to ask by name.

**Product-skills triggers:**
- User has raw interview notes, survey responses, feedback → **craft-discovery-synthesis**
- User asks about customer motivation, "why do they churn", "what do they really want" → **jobs-to-be-done**
- User asks about competitive advantage, moats, defensibility → **7-powers**
- User has rough notes and needs a spec, says "write a PRD", "spec this out" → **draft-spec** for detailed specs with strategic framing, **craft-spec** for lighter structured PRDs (or **write-prd** command for guided flow)

- User says "what should we build", "find opportunities", "where are we losing users" → **discover-opportunities**
- User has a list of things and needs to decide, says "prioritize", "rank these", "what should we do first" → **prioritize**
