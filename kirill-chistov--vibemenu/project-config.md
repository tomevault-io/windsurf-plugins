# AGENTS.md — Rules for all AI coding agents

This is the universal contract for **every** AI coding agent working in this repo
(Claude Code, Codex, Sonnet, and any other). Claude-specific workflow notes are in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md); read this file first.

## Ownership

1. **The human owns product decisions.** Kirill Chistov is the product owner and the sole final
   decision-maker. You are **not** the product owner. When a choice is architectural,
   product-shaping, or ambiguous, **stop and ask** rather than deciding silently.

## Scope discipline

2. **Small diffs only.** One logical change per task/PR. Prefer additive, reversible
   changes.
3. **Do not overbuild.** Build the shape the task asks for, not the full future behavior.
   Prefer `TODO`s and protocols/stubs over implementing deferred features early.
4. **No broad rewrites without approval.** Refactors that touch many files or cross module
   boundaries require explicit sign-off *before* you start.
5. **No new dependencies without approval.** Default to system frameworks. Propose any
   dependency in the PR with a justification and an ADR in `docs/decisions/`.

## Product/architecture workflow

For **non-trivial product or architecture changes**, do not immediately implement. First
produce a proposal with options and tradeoffs, then wait for product approval.

**Non-trivial** means anything touching:

- power assertions
- automation policy
- Claude hook/heartbeat behavior
- privacy/security
- app lifecycle/background monitoring
- settings/onboarding
- release/distribution
- new user-visible features

Small fixes may still be implemented directly:

- typo/comment cleanup
- tests for an already-approved behavior
- obvious bugfix with no product tradeoff

Required proposal format:

```md
## Problem
## Constraints
## Options
## Recommendation
## Risks
## Testing plan
## Waiting for product approval
```

## Hard product/privacy invariants (never violate without an ADR + human approval)

6. **No transcript-content reading.** Read process presence and file *metadata* (mtime) for
   detection — never the contents of prompts, responses, tool calls, `lastPrompt`, or any
   message body. **One narrow, ADR-approved exception:** the Session Radar may open the matching
   transcript to read *only* its session-title record (`custom-title` / `ai-title`) for the row
   name (docs/decisions/0013). No other transcript field is ever read, stored, or logged. Any
   further widening needs its own ADR + human approval.
7. **No telemetry. No analytics.** None, not even opt-in, without explicit approval.
8. **No network calls.** No backend, no account, no update check. The invariant reserves one
   hypothetical exception (a signed update channel, `docs/decisions/0004`) that is **not built
   and not planned** — do not add networking code on the strength of that carve-out.
9. **No clamshell / root / private-API work without approval.** Anything needing root, a
   privileged helper, `pmset disablesleep`, or a private Apple API is out of scope and
   requires its own ADR + human sign-off. Keep such code quarantined outside
   `VibeMenuCore`.
10. **Respect the lightweight resource budget.** No busy polling loops; prefer
    event-driven observation. No local database, no transcript copying, no heavy
    monitoring dashboard. See
    [`docs/decisions/0006-lightweight-resource-budget.md`](docs/decisions/0006-lightweight-resource-budget.md).

## Verification (this is non-negotiable)

11. **Run real checks.** When your change is relevant, actually run `swift build` and the
    tests (`scripts/test.sh`).
12. **Paste real command output.** The build/test output you show must be the real output
    of a command you actually ran.
13. **Never fake build/test/launch results.** Do not claim something builds, tests, or
    launches unless you ran it and can show the output. If you did not run it, say so
    plainly. The `.app` wrapper builds and runs as a menu-bar app today, but that is not a
    licence to claim *your* change runs — building the package is not launching the app, and
    launching it is not exercising your code path.

## Communication

14. **Summarize changed files** at the end of every task: path + one line on what changed
    and why.
15. **Explain macOS API assumptions.** For any system / IOKit / `pmset` / hook call,
    state: public or private? entitlements or root needed? sandbox-compatible? does it
    vary by chip generation or OS version? Cite where you verified it.
16. **Mark uncertainty clearly.** Flag anything you are guessing, anything version-fragile
    (e.g. the Claude Code JSONL format), and anything you could not test on this hardware.
17. **Write decisions down.** Any non-trivial design choice → an ADR in `docs/decisions/` with
    context, options, decision, and consequences.

## Second-model review

18. For anything risky — `AutomationPolicy`, IOKit adapters, a future privileged helper,
    or the no-network invariant — the implementing model and the reviewing model must be
    **different** models. No single model both proposes and ratifies its own risky change.

## Development log

19. **Update `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` after each implementation task.** Append a short new
