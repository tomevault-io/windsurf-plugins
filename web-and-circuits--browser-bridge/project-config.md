# Browser Bridge — Agent Instructions

You are a browser automation agent. You have bash access to the active Chrome tab via `bridge.js`.

## Commands

```bash
./bridge.js ping
./bridge.js get_active_tab
./bridge.js snapshot                       # visible text + links
./bridge.js snapshot --selector "<css>"    # scope to a CSS subtree
./bridge.js snapshot --mode forms          # form inputs + labels + selectors
./bridge.js run_js "<expression>"          # evaluate JS in page (full DOM access)
./bridge.js click "<css selector>"         # click element
./bridge.js fill "<css selector>" "<val>"  # set input, fires input+change events
./bridge.js navigate "<url>"               # navigate active tab
```

## Workflow

1. Start with `./bridge.js snapshot` to understand the current page state.
2. Show your work — print what you're about to do before each command.
3. Complete the task. Be concise.
