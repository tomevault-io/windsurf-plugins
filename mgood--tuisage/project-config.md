# AGENTS.md — Development Guidelines

This file contains instructions for AI agents (and developers) working on TuiSage. It defines the development process, coding standards, testing philosophy, and workflow conventions.

## Project Context

TuiSage is a terminal UI for interactively building CLI commands from [usage](https://usage.jdx.dev/) specs. It reads `.usage.kdl` files and presents an interactive interface for browsing subcommands, toggling flags, filling in arguments, and producing a complete command string.

Refer to these documents for increasing levels of detail:

- **REQUIREMENTS.md** — what the application should do (goals, features, user stories)
- **SPECIFICATION.md** — how features should behave (UI layout, interactions, data flow)
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md** — how it's built (architecture, code structure, current state)
- **README.md** — user-facing guide (installation, usage, keyboard shortcuts)

## Development Process

- **Commit frequently to git** — Make commits after completing logical units of work (e.g., after fixing a bug, adding a feature, updating documentation). This provides a history trail to track the evolution of the project.
- Before starting a new feature or fix, review the current state of the codebase and relevant documentation.
- After completing work, update the living documentation (REQUIREMENTS.md, SPECIFICATION.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, README.md) to reflect changes.
- Start by producing or updating a plan before diving into implementation. Think through the approach, edge cases, and testing strategy.
- Work in git branches for experimental features, but commit directly to main for incremental improvements and fixes.

## Testing Philosophy

Development follows a **testing-focused process**. Tests are an integral part of every change.

### Test-First When Possible

- When fixing a bug, write a test that reproduces the issue first, then update the code to pass the test.
- When adding a feature, write tests that define the expected behavior, then implement to satisfy them.
- Tests may also be used to inspect current behavior before making modifications.

### Test Layers

Tests are structured in layers of increasing scope:

1. **Unit tests** — app state logic, command building, fuzzy matching (in `app.rs`)
2. **Rendering tests** — assertion-based checks for specific UI elements (in `ui.rs`)
3. **Snapshot tests** — full terminal output captured via `insta` (in `ui.rs`)

### Test Patterns

Follow testing patterns for ratatui apps: https://ratatui.rs/recipes/testing/snapshots/

- Test fixtures should use `.usage.kdl` formatted input, then verify the resulting UI or state.
- Use a representative set of commands covering: nested subcommands, boolean flags, flags with values, positional args, choices, aliases, count flags, and global flags.
- Snapshot tests use `insta`. Review changes with `cargo insta review` and accept new snapshots with `cargo insta test --accept`.

### Running Tests

```sh
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Review snapshot changes interactively
cargo insta review

# Run with acceptance of new snapshots
cargo insta test --accept
```

## Coding Standards

### Rust Conventions

- Target zero clippy warnings: `cargo clippy -- -W warnings`
- Use `color-eyre` for error handling and reporting.
- Keep modules focused: `app.rs` handles state and logic, `ui.rs` handles rendering, `main.rs` is the entry point and event loop.

### Dependencies

Only add dependencies when they provide clear value. Current key dependencies:

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `clap` | CLI argument parsing (derive mode) |
| `clap_usage` | Generate usage specs from clap definitions |
| `usage-lib` | Parse usage specs (KDL format), no default features |
| `ratatui` | TUI framework |
| `crossterm` | Terminal backend and events |
| `ratatui-interact` | UI components (Input, focus management) |
| `ratatui-themes` | Consistent color theming |
| `nucleo-matcher` | Fuzzy matching (scored, ranked) |
| `portable-pty` | Cross-platform pseudo-terminal for command execution |
| `tui-term` | PseudoTerminal widget for embedded terminal output |
| `vt100` | VT100 terminal emulation (parsing control sequences) |
| `color-eyre` | Error reporting |
| `insta` | Snapshot testing (dev) |
| `pretty_assertions` | Better test diffs (dev) |

### Code Organization

- Prefer single-file modules until complexity warrants splitting.
- Keep state management (navigation, flag values, arg values) in `app.rs`.
- Keep all rendering logic in `ui.rs`.
- The event loop in `main.rs` should remain thin — delegate to `app.handle_key()` and `app.handle_mouse()`.

## UI Design Principles

- **Keyboard-first**: Prioritize fast keyboard navigation with vim-style keys.
- **Mouse-supported**: Support mouse clicks, scroll wheel, and click-to-activate as secondary input.
- **Live feedback**: Always show the assembled command updating in real time.
- **Efficient use of color**: Use terminal colors to help users navigate quickly. Follow the active theme palette for consistency.
- **Accessible indicators**: Use clear symbols (✓/○ for checkboxes, ▶ for selection caret) that render well across terminal emulators.
