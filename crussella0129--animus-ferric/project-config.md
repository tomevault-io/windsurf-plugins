# AGENTS.md — Animus Ferric

Project-specific instructions. These take precedence over the global
`~/.Codex/AGENTS.md`.

## Branching: two branches, and only two

**This repository has exactly two branches: `main` and `dev`.** Set by the
owner on 2026-07-27, after ~20 accumulated `sprint/*` branches were deleted.

- **Work in `dev`.** Every sprint's commits land on `dev` directly.
- **Do NOT create a branch per sprint.** No `sprint/NNN-*` branches, no
  worktrees for sprints, no feature branches. This is explicit, not a default
  to be reasoned around.
- **One PR per sprint, `dev` → `main`,** opened as the final step of the
  sprint's loop phase.
- **The owner approves and performs every merge.** Never merge a PR.
- After a merge, bring `dev` back in step with `main` before starting the next
  sprint, so the next PR contains exactly one sprint.

### Why this replaced the previous flow

The old flow branched `sprint/NNN-*` off the previous sprint's branch. That
produced a stack of long-lived branches, and stacked PRs behaved badly:
**GitHub only retargets a PR's base when the base branch is deleted**, not when
it is merged, so PRs #57/#58 merged into each other and `main` received only
the bottom sprint. Recovering it needed an extra "land sprints N and N+1" PR.

A single `dev` branch removes the stack entirely: there is one base, it is
always `main`, and a PR can only ever contain what is on `dev`.

### The one thing to check before opening a sprint PR

`git log origin/main..dev` must contain **only the current sprint's commits**.
If it spans more than one sprint, the previous sprint's PR was missed — fix the
cadence, do not bundle. (See the `one-pr-per-sprint` memory for the full
close-out order: commit → push and CONFIRM → PR → verify the commit count.)

## Sprint records

`sprints/` is **gitignored and untracked** (ADR-096) — it is ephemeral working
memory. The durable record is `decisions.md` (ADRs), `agent-tasks/`, and the
per-sprint commit message. Do not re-add `sprints/` to version control.

## Template hygiene

This repo is meant to be usable as a template (ADR-096). Machine identity —
real tailnet addresses, MagicDNS suffixes, hostnames, account handles, concrete
home directories, LAN IPs — must not enter tracked sources.
`crates/ferric-cli/tests/template_hygiene.rs` enforces this and will fail the
suite. Use documentation values instead: `tailnet-example.ts.net`,
`100.64.0.x`, `example-host`, `C:\Users\<you>`.
