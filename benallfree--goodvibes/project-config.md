Please analyze the git diff between the most recent tag and HEAD (excluding bun.lock), and create or update .changeset entries to document the changes.

Key aspects to document:
1. Breaking changes (major version bump)
2. New features (minor version bump)
3. Bug fixes and improvements (patch version)

For each distinct area of change, create a separate changeset entry that is:
- Concise but descriptive
- Focused on a single theme/area
- Lists specific improvements under each change

Please ensure the changeset entries follow the format:
---
'package-name': patch|minor|major
---
