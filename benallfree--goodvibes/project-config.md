# GoodVibes Project Guidelines

## Core Architecture
* Bun is our package manager.
* Three.js is the ONLY library allowed. Everything else must be created from scratch.
* Absolutely no build chain other than Vite.
* Use TypeScript everywhere.
* Use early returns.
* To deploy, run `bun run build && bun run deploy` from the root directory. They are set up properly.

## Directory Structure
* All code lives in the `/src` directory with the following organization:
  - `/src/game` - Core game logic and Three.js implementation
  - `/src/server` - Cloudflare Worker and Durable Objects implementation
  - `/src/ui` - User interface components
  - `/src/controls` - Game control handlers
  - `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `/src/utils` - Utility functions
  - `/src/styles` - Global styles and Tailwind/DaisyUI configuration
  - `/src/config` - Application configuration
* Tailwind/DaisyUI is available in [styles.css](mdc:src/styles/styles.css).
* The project uses Vite-Cloudflare integration for unified client/server development.

## Styling Guidelines
* Avoid inline styles and use Tailwind/Daisy styling or add styles to custom local CSS files that sit with the component.
* Use the provided Tailwind/DaisyUI classes for consistent styling.
* Create component-specific CSS files when needed, co-located with the component.

## Code Quality
* Practice aggressive separation of concerns.
* After each task is done, please review all the code and recommend the most important single refactoring that is both helpful and minimal.
* Always discuss a plan first and wait for approval before coding a solution. Two separate interactions minimum.
* Follow the Prettier configuration in package.json for consistent code formatting.
* Use TypeScript types for all variables, functions, and components.
* Implement proper error handling and type checking.

## Build and Development
* Use `bun run dev` for local development.
* Use `bun run build` for production builds.
* Use `bun run deploy` to deploy to Cloudflare.
* Use `bun run ship` for a complete build and deploy.
* The project uses Vite with the following plugins:
  - @cloudflare/vite-plugin
  - @tailwindcss/vite
  - vite-imagetools
  - vite-plugin-ejs
  - vite-plugin-image-optimizer

## Performance Guidelines
* Optimize assets using the provided image optimization plugins.
* Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading.
* Minimize bundle size by avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
* Use proper caching strategies for static assets.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
* Implement proper error boundaries.
* Add appropriate logging for debugging.
* Test edge cases and error scenarios.
* Ensure proper cleanup in useEffect hooks and event listeners.

## Security Considerations
* Never expose sensitive information in client-side code.
* Implement proper input validation.
* Use appropriate CORS policies.
* Follow security best practices for WebSocket connections.

## Documentation
* Document complex functions and components.
* Maintain clear and concise commit messages.
* Update README.md with new features and changes.
* Document any breaking changes or major updates.
