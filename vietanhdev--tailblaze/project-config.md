- Use NextJS + Pages layout.
- This site is built as a static page.
- Tailwind for styling.
- Use pnpm as package manager.
- The 'shadcn-ui' package is deprecated. Please use the 'shadcn' package instead:
  npx shadcn@latest init
- Add components like:
```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add card button dialog
```
- Think step by step. Create components then use them in the page.
- Define and reuse types. Put all types in `./types`.
- When you found a type defined in a component page, try to move it or reuse a type in `./types`. You can extend types to reuse as much as possible.
