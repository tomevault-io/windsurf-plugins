description: Enforce Microsoft Learn documentation standards when writing or reviewing developer-facing docs. Rewrite existing content only when it violates these rules.

# Documentation Standards (Microsoft Learn)

Follow the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) and [Microsoft Learn contributor guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/content/style-quick-start) when writing or editing documentation. Apply these rules to new content. When reviewing or touching existing docs, fix violations you encounter — don't rewrite pages that already comply.

## Voice

Be **warm and relaxed**, **crisp and clear**, and **ready to lend a hand**.

- Write to one reader in second person ("you"). Use active voice and contractions.
- Front-load what matters. Short sentences. Scan first, read second.
- Assume developers know programming basics. Focus on product-specific information.
- No marketing language ("powerful", "seamless") or filler ("simply", "just", "obviously").
- Use inclusive, bias-free language.
- Present tense over future tense. Sentence case for all headings.

## Content types

Each page serves one primary intent (Diátaxis). Don't mix types on one page.

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| **Tutorial** | Reader is learning — guide them to a first success step by step. |
| **How-to** | Reader has a specific task — give numbered steps, assume baseline competence. |
| **Reference** | Reader is looking something up — parameters, commands, errors, concisely. |
| **Explanation** | Reader wants context — define concepts and explain why, don't instruct. |

Before writing, identify the reader, their task, and the content type.

## Structure

- Open with what the page is and what the reader will accomplish or understand.
- List prerequisites explicitly — never assume implicit knowledge.
- Break content with headings, lists, tables, and code blocks. No walls of text.
- End with **Next steps** or **See also**.
- New concepts: define **what it is** before explaining **why it matters**.

## Procedures

- Numbered lists for sequential steps. Imperative verb, complete sentence, period at end.
- Say where the action happens before what to do (terminal, config file, UI location).
- Keep procedures ≤12 steps; split longer ones into sections.
- Don't interrupt steps with commentary — put detail in code comments instead.
- Bold UI labels: Select **Settings** > **Advanced**.

## Code examples

- Runnable with imports/setup where needed. Clear placeholders (`YOUR_API_KEY`).
- Primary languages for this project: **Go** and **shell**. Don't add other languages unless readers need them.
- State expected output after each example. Show responses when they matter.

## Reference entries

For each parameter, option, or field document: type, required/optional, units, limits, and enum values. Document errors with cause and fix — not "contact support."

## Callouts

Use sparingly (≤1 per major section): **Note**, **Important**, **Warning**, **Tip**.

## Deprecation and testing

- Breaking changes need a migration guide with replacement and example.
- Deprecated items need deprecation date, sunset date, and replacement.
- Feature guides cover success verification and common failure scenarios.

## Localization

Short sentences. Simple construction. Consistent terminology. Avoid idioms and long clause chains.

## Review checklist

When finishing a doc change, confirm:

- [ ] Content type matches reader intent
- [ ] Opening states purpose; prerequisites are explicit
- [ ] Headings are sentence case; page is scannable
- [ ] Procedures are numbered imperatives (≤12 steps)
- [ ] Code examples run; output is described
- [ ] Reference fields and errors are fully documented
- [ ] No filler, marketing language, or support deflection
- [ ] Page ends with next steps or see also
