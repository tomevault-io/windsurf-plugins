# AGENTS.md

## Two-Layer Architecture

- **Chrome MV3 extension** (`src/`): React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Zustand — built with `npm run build`, output to `dist/`.
- **Apps Script backend** (`apps-script/Code.gs`): ~1080 lines of Google Apps Script, deployed manually by copy-paste into the Apps Script editor.
- `CLAUDE.md` has the authoritative detailed reference — this file captures only what's easy to miss.

## GitHub Releases

Tag a commit with `v*` to trigger the release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
```bash
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
```
This builds the extension, zips it, and creates a GitHub Release with the zip attached.

## Quick Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Vite dev server at localhost:5173 (chrome APIs mocked via dev-mocks.ts)
npm run build     # tsc + vite build → dist/
npm test          # vitest run (jsdom, globals: true)
npm run package   # build + zip → meet-gemini-notebooklm.zip
npm run test:watch
npx vitest run -t "test name"   # single test by name
```

## Dev Preview (preferred over building+loading extension)

Four dev entry points bypass `chrome-extension://` restrictions:

| URL | What it renders |
|-----|----------------|
| `/dashboard.html` | Full auth + dashboard flow (conditional mock) |
| `/dashboard-dev.html` | `<Dashboard />` directly, mocked data |
| `/popup-dev.html` | `<Popup />` directly, mocked data |
| `/wizard-dev.html` | `<SetupWizard />` with scenario picker |

Mocks live in `src/dev-mocks.ts` — stubs chrome.storage, identity, tabs, runtime and seeds Zustand with fake data. Tree-shaken from production builds.

**Apps Script test files** (`apps-script/*.test.ts`) replicate backend transform logic in TypeScript for Vitest — they are NOT runnable in Apps Script. Keep them in sync when changing Code.gs.

## Apps Script Deployment

- Copy `apps-script/Code.gs` into the Apps Script editor bound to a Google Doc.
- Enable Drive API (v3) and Docs API (v1) via Services panel.
- Deploy as web app: Execute as Me, Who has access: Anyone.
- The web app URL (`/macros/s/{deploymentId}/exec`) goes into the extension's SetupWizard (`chrome.storage.sync: deploymentUrl`).
- The **script project ID** (from the editor URL `/home/projects/{scriptId}/edit`) is a SEPARATE field — it's NOT the same as the deployment ID in the web app URL. The extension stores it as `chrome.storage.sync: scriptId`.
- `Session.getActiveUser().getEmail()` returns empty for some account types — `validateCaller_` logs a warning and returns false.
- POST detection must use `e.postData` (not `e.method` — that field doesn't exist in Apps Script).
- Config overrides persist in `PropertiesService.getScriptProperties()` under key `CONFIG_OVERRIDES`.

## Programmatic Deployment (`src/lib/deployApi.ts`)

The extension can push Code.gs updates via the Apps Script REST API:

1. **OAuth scopes** required in `public/manifest.json`:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.projects` — for `projects.getContent` / `projects.updateContent`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.deployments` — for `projects.deployments.list` / `projects.deployments.update`
2. **SetupWizard** collects both the deployment URL AND the script project ID separately since they are different identifiers.
3. **Flow**: GET content (verify + get file IDs) → PUT updated content → POST new version → GET deployments → PUT deployment with new version
4. When adding new OAuth scopes to the manifest, the cached Chrome identity token must be cleared (`chrome.identity.removeCachedAuthToken`) — the extension clears it on each signIn.
5. `chrome.identity.getAuthToken` ignores the `scopes` parameter in modern Chrome — use manifest scopes only.
6. Deployment matching uses `deploymentId` extracted from the URL (`/macros/s/{id}/exec`) rather than full URL comparison, which is fragile to trailing slashes and encoding differences.
7. Content update must send BOTH `Code.gs` (SERVER_JS) and `appsscript.json` (JSON) with existing file IDs from the GET step. Missing file IDs can cause 400 errors.

## Version Display

The extension version (`chrome.runtime.getManifest().version`) is shown in the popup header and dashboard header. The `getManifest` mock is stubbed in both `src/dev-mocks.ts` and `src/test/setup.ts`.

## Privacy Policy

`PRIVACY.md` at repo root covers data handling. The extension does not send user data to third parties — all communication is with the user's own Apps Script backend.

## Extension Auth & Token Flow

- Extension uses `chrome.identity.getAuthToken` with scopes from `manifest.json` (`oauth2.scopes`). The `scopes` parameter in JS is ignored by modern Chrome.
- Token is passed as `?token=<accessToken>` query param (Apps Script strips `Authorization` headers).
- Apps Script validates via Google tokeninfo endpoint + email comparison; caches result 5 min via `CacheService`.
- OAuth client ID lives in `public/manifest.json` under `oauth2.client_id`.
- `chrome.identity.removeCachedAuthToken` is called before each signIn to ensure fresh tokens with current manifest scopes.
