# Agent Guide for Apache Directory Server (ApacheDS)

This file is read by automated agents (security scanners, code analyzers,
AI assistants) operating on this repository.

## Security

Security model: [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) -> [THREAT_MODEL.md](./THREAT_MODEL.md)

This repository hosts the **Apache Directory umbrella threat model**, which
covers the shared identity-stack trust model across the project's components —
LDAP bind/ACI (ApacheDS), the LDAP API codec, Kerberos KDC (Kerby), Fortress
RBAC, SCIM (SCIMple), and MVCC storage (Mavibot) — with per-domain addenda.
Agents should consult `SECURITY.md` and the linked `THREAT_MODEL.md` before
reporting issues.
