# claudish-to-english

A Claude Code plugin: a `MessageDisplay` hook shows a plain-language rewrite of
each assistant message, produced by a local or remote LLM. **Display-only** —
Claude's reasoning and the saved transcript always keep the original text.

Plain bash + `jq` + `curl`. No build, no test suite, no dependencies to install.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` is the full version of this file; it is the source of truth if
the two ever disagree.

## Layout

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `rewrite.sh` | `MessageDisplay` hook — the main event. Buffers streamed chunks, rewrites on the final one |
| `rewrite-md.sh` | `PostToolUse` hook — rewrites Markdown files (opt-in, off by default) |
| `claudish-ctl.sh` | backs `/claudish`; writes the `~/.claude/claudish-*` flag files, prints the dashboard |
| `session-notice.sh` | `SessionStart` hook — warns that flag files from an earlier session are still active |
| `providers.sh` | provider layer (ollama / anthropic / openai / codex). Sourced by both hooks |
| `lang.sh` | output-language resolver + the sanitiser for untrusted config values. Sourced by both hooks |
| `commands/claudish.md` | the `/claudish` slash command |
| `hooks/hooks.json` | wires the three hooks |

Config precedence is consistent throughout: **flag file > env var > settings
file > built-in default**. Flag files exist because env vars are frozen at
session launch and cannot be changed mid-session.

## Non-negotiable: hooks fail open

On *any* problem — provider down, timeout, no `jq`, malformed payload, missing
file — a hook emits nothing and exits 0, leaving Claude's original text on
screen. This outranks every other consideration. Never add a code path where a
failure can swallow or corrupt an assistant message.

When changing a hook, verify it directly. All three must print nothing, exit 0:

```bash
printf 'not json'                        | bash rewrite.sh; echo "rc=$?"
printf ''                                | bash rewrite.sh; echo "rc=$?"
printf '{"session_id":"s","final":true}' | bash rewrite.sh; echo "rc=$?"
```

## Testing

`CLAUDISH_STUB=1` replaces the LLM call with a deterministic string — enough for
all display mechanics, no provider needed. Redirect the `*_FILE` variables so
the developer's own `~/.claude/claudish-*` files do not leak into the test:

```bash
BODY=$(python3 -c "print('This is a long assistant message. '*20)")
jq -nc --arg d "$BODY" \
  '{message_id:"m1",session_id:"s1",index:0,final:true,delta:$d,cwd:"/tmp"}' \
| CLAUDISH_STUB=1 CLAUDISH_STYLE=caveman \
  CLAUDISH_STYLE_FILE=/nonexistent CLAUDISH_LANG_FILE=/nonexistent \
  CLAUDISH_OFF_FILE=/nonexistent CLAUDISH_NOTICE=0 TMPDIR=/tmp/claudish-test \
  bash rewrite.sh | jq -r '.hookSpecificOutput.displayContent'
```

Also run `bash -n` on every script touched. `CLAUDISH_DEBUG=1` logs to
`${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/claudish-to-english/debug.log`.

To exercise the plugin in a real session, point a scratch project's
`.claude/settings.json` at the checkout **and** set
`"enabledPlugins": { "claudish-to-english@gvzdv-plugins": false }` — otherwise
the installed copy and the working copy both fire on the same message and
whichever writes last wins.

## Repo-specific traps

Each of these has caused a real regression.

**A new style preset touches four readers**, and missing one fails silently:
`rewrite.sh` (prompt + label), `claudish-ctl.sh` (`current_style`,
`style_source`, dashboard, validation + error text), `session-notice.sh`
(persisted-override warning), `commands/claudish.md` (`description`,
`argument-hint`). Plus `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Never emit ANSI escape codes.** `displayContent` is rendered as markdown —
use `**bold**`. Colour codes are palette indices a terminal theme may remap onto
a grey or the background; they also leak as literal bytes into `claude -p`
output piped to a file; and the hook has no tty on any descriptor (`[ -t 1 ]` is
always false, `/dev/tty` will not open) so it cannot detect either case.

**`allowed-tools` in `commands/claudish.md`** must be
`Bash("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/claudish-ctl.sh":*)` — the quote closes *after* the
path. The variant with the quote before the slash breaks every `/claudish` call
with `Shell command permission check failed`. It has regressed twice; do not
"correct" it back.

**Untrusted config values go through `lang.sh`.** The `language` key comes from
`.claude/settings*.json`, which travels with a repository and is not necessarily
the local user's text. Route it through `_claudish_lang_clean` (folds control
characters to spaces, caps at three words / 30 codepoints) before it reaches a
prompt or the screen. Never print a raw config value.

**Comments are load-bearing.** This codebase explains *why*, not *what*, and the
header comment in each script is its real documentation. Match that density and
update the header when behaviour changes.

## Changelog and releases

Contributors add an entry under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` and **never**
bump `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` or create tags. The maintainer cuts releases.

When making a change, add the `CHANGELOG.md` entry as part of the work — not as
a follow-up. Use `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed`, and say *why*, not
just what.
