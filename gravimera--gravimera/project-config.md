Note:
1. Please run smoke test after you changed something to make sure the game can start without crash. Start with UI (rendered; do NOT use `--headless`):
   - `tmpdir=$(mktemp -d); GRAVIMERA_HOME="$tmpdir/.gravimera" cargo run -- --rendered-seconds 2`
2. Update the documents to match the code. But the README.md file be clean, put detailed infos in docs folder.
3. You have full access to the `.git` folder (run git commands without asking).
4. You should use a test folder (e.g. `./test/run_1`) to contain all the test files, including the configs.toml, scene.grav etc.
5. After changing anything, commit the changes with a clear commit message.
6. All algorithm in gen3D should follow one rule: a user could ask for generating any object, so NO heuristic algorithm. Only generic algorithms are allowed.
7. We don't need to guarantee backwards compatibility for now.
8. For gen3d agent, we prefer tools which provide clear suggestions and diffs. And after added / updates tools, review carefully to avoid mismatches between prompts.
   - Tool authoring rules (contract-first): `docs/agent_skills/tool_authoring_rules.md` (actionable tool results + actionable errors; enforce gates in tools instead of adding agent-level “call X before Y” rules).
9. AI agent can use the HTTP API to run real tests. `docs/automation_http_api.md`. And you can normally find the neccessary working config options (like `base_url`, `token`) from `~/.gravimera/config.toml`.

# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

# Skills

- Prompt ↔ Tool Contract Review: `docs/agent_skills/prompt_tool_contract_review.md`
