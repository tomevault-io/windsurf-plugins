# Companion install on version bump

Whenever `companion/app/build.gradle.kts` `versionCode` / `versionName` is
bumped for an installable build (or companion code that needs to land on the
Pixel is finished):

1. Check `adb devices` (use `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools\adb.exe` on Windows
   if `adb` is not on PATH).
2. If a suitable device is connected (Pixel / `device` state; skip boards that
   fail minSdk), run from `companion/`:
   `gradlew.bat :app:installDebug`
3. Prefer pinning the Pixel serial with `-s` when multiple devices are listed.
4. Do this in the same turn as the bump — do not wait for the operator to ask.

Firmware DFU packaging is separate; still package `slate_dfu` when firmware
changed, but companion install is mandatory whenever the APK version moves.
