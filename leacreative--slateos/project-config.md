description: Normative I2C/TWI bus rules for PineTime TWIM1 (mutex, timeouts, no raw register poking)

# I2C / TWI bus (Slate)

Full rules: `docs/i2c-bus.md`. Follow those before changing bus or sensor code.

## Non-negotiable

1. **Only `twi::write` / `read` / `write_read`** talk to TWIM1. No driver-local TWIM register poking.
2. **Mutex stays on** for FreeRTOS (`SLATE_HAS_FREERTOS=1`) around every transfer and `sleep`/`wake`/`recover_bus` — same idea as InfiniTime `TwiMaster` and `spi_bus` mutex. Do not add a second I2C path that skips it.
3. **Assume multi-task use**: `app` (touch/BMA/raise) and `hr` (HRS every ~100 ms) share the bus, including while the display is asleep.
4. **Timeouts + recovery** required; never infinite spin on the app task.
5. **No `twi::init()` in poll paths** — ENABLE=0 preserves config; transfers wake/sleep themselves.
6. **CST816S NACKs when idle are normal** — not a reason to drop locking or re-init the bus.
7. **Do not hand-edit TWIM SHORTS bit numbers** — N-31 killed all I2C once. Match nRF52832 PS / bitfields.
8. Pins: SDA=P0.06, SCL=P0.07, open-drain S0D1. Addrs: touch `0x15`, BMA `0x18`, HRS `0x44`.

## Smoke if you touch HR or locking

HR Off → raise still works after sleep. HR On → BPM can lock on-wrist; raise still works.
