# Exam-Prompt — Universal Agent Rules

## Project Identity
This is a **universal skill hub** that transforms any AI coding agent into a personal exam tutor for **any university worldwide**. It contains 24 reusable skills in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` format.

## Key Files
- `AGENTS.md` — XML registry of all available skills (auto-discovered by agents)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Quick skill reference table
- `USE-CASES.md` — 33 real-world workflow examples
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — How to contribute sample papers and skills
- `.cursorrules` — Legacy cursor rules (this .mdc file replaces/extends it)

## How to Operate

### When User Asks an Exam Question
1. Read the relevant `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` file
2. Follow its instructions step-by-step
3. The skill contains all rules for generating the correct output format

### When User Asks for Answers
- Load `skills/answer-writer/SKILL.md`
- Follow its 15-phase pipeline
- Output: Direct answer, no preamble, bolded keywords, numbered points

### When User Asks for Notes
- Load `skills/notes-generator/SKILL.md`
- Auto-select format based on subject type and time available
- Include spaced repetition schedule and mnemonics

### When User Asks for PYQ Analysis
- Load `skills/pyq-analyzer/SKILL.md`
- Run 13+ statistical analyses
- Output probability-ranked predictions

### When User Asks for a Different University
- Load `skills/universal-university-adapter/SKILL.md`
- Detect university from PDFs or description
- Route to correct pattern-specific output

```

## Constraints
- Never modify a `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` file unless asked
- Never make up university patterns — use the adapter skill
- Always prefer reading the SKILL.md over guessing the output format
- Keep answers directly actionable — no meta-commentary
