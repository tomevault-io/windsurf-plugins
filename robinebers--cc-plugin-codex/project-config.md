# AGENTS.md

Version: 0.28 (2026-03-23)

Work style: Be radically precise. No fluff. Pure information only (drop grammar; min tokens).

## Agent Protocol
- Editor: `cursor <path>`
- When asked to update the `AGENTS.md` to the latest version:
  1. Fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robinebers/agents.md/main/AGENTS.md`
  2. Check if newer version version and merge without losing local changes

## Guardrails
- Use `trash` for deletes
- Use `mv` / `cp` to move and copy files
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits
- Keep files <~400 LOC; split/refactor as needed
- Simplicity first: handle only important cases; no enterprise over-engineering/fallbacks
- New functionality: small OR absolutely necessary
- NEVER delete files, folders or other data unless explicilty approved or part of a plan
- Before writing code, stricly follow the below research rules

## Research
- Prefer skills if available over research.
- Prefer researched knowledge over existing knowledge when skills are unavailable.
- Research: Exa to websearch early, and Ref to seek specific documention or web fetch.
- Best results: Quote exact errors; prefer 2025-2026+ sources.

## Git
- Always use `gh` to communicate with GitHub.
- GitHub CLI for PRs/CI/releases. Given issue/PR URL (or `/pull/5`): use `gh`, not web search.
- Examples: `gh issue view <url> --comments -R owner/repo`, `gh pr view <url> --comments --files -R owner/repo`.
- Conventional branches (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log`. Push only when user asks.
- `git checkout` ok for PR review / explicit request.
- Branch changes require user consent.
- Destructive ops forbidden unless explicit (`reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, `DROP`, `DELETE FROM`, …).

## Error Handling
- Expected issues: explicit result types (not throw/try/catch).
  - Exception: external systems (git, gh) → try/catch ok.
  - Exception: React Query mutations → throw ok.
- Unexpected issues: fail LOUD (throw/console.error + toast.error); NEVER add fallbacks.

## Backwards Compat
- Always minimum only, you typically overthink this -> KEEP THINGS SIMPLE!
- When in doubt, ask the user before you overengineer solutions

## Critical Thinking
- Fix root cause (not band-aid)
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask w/ short options (A/B/C).
- Conflicts: stop. call out; pick safer path.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user.

## Granted Autonomy
- Assume "continue" unless the user explicitly says "stop" or "pause"
- Do not ask "should I continue?" or similar questions
- If more progress is possible without user input, continue
- BEFORE you end a turn or ask the user a question, run this checklist
-- Answer these privately, then act:
   1) Was the initial task fully completed?
   2) If a definition-of-done was provided, did you run and verify every item?
   3) Are you about to stop to ask a question?
      - If yes: is the question actually blocking forward progress?
   4) Can the question be answered by choosing an opinionated default?
      - If yes: choose a default, document it in , and continue.
- When you choose opinionated defaults, document them in `/docs/choices.md` as you work.
- Leave breadcrumb notes in thread and `/docs/breadcrumbs.md`.
- When writing to `/docs/choices.md` or `/docs/breadcrumbs.md` categorize by date (tail)
- If you must ask the user:
-- Ask exclusively blocking question only.
-- Explain why it is blocking and what you will do once answered.
-- Provide your best default/assumption as an alternative if the user does not care.

## Useful Tidbits
- When using Vercel AI Gateway, use a single API key across the project, not individual providers.
- When using Convex, run `bunx convex dev --once` to verify, not `bunx convex codegen`.
- When tasked to use the computer, prefer simple screenshot/mouse pointer events over accessibility.

## Repo Notes
- Plugin source lives in `plugins/claude-for-codex/`.
- After changing the plugin, sync the installed copy at `~/.codex/plugins/claude-for-codex` before treating the local Codex install as updated.
- If `~/.codex/plugins/cache/local-plugins/claude-for-codex/local` exists, refresh that copy too.
- Repo edits do not auto-update the installed local plugin. Restart Codex after syncing when you need Codex to pick up the update.
- Before any push that includes plugin changes, make an explicit version decision in `plugins/claude-for-codex/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.
- Default version rule: patch bump unless there is a clear minor or major reason.
- Do not push plugin changes without making that version decision first.

## User Notes
Use below list to store and recall user notes when asked to do so.
