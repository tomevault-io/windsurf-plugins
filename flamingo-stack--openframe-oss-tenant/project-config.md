# Cursor Rules in OpenFrame

This document explains how to add and maintain Cursor rules for the OpenFrame project.

## Rules Location

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
   ```
   .cursor/rules/
   ├── cursor-rules.mdc
   ├── project-structure.mdc
   ├── java-spring-cursor-rules.mdc
   ├── vuejs-typescript-best-practices.mdc
   └── ...
   ```

2. For feature-specific rules, use the features subdirectory:
   ```
   .cursor/rules/features/
   ├── gateway-integration.mdc
   ├── tactical-rmm.mdc
   ├── fleet-mdm.mdc
   └── ...
   ```

## Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `api-design.mdc`, `database-patterns.mdc`)
- Always use .mdc extension
- Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose
- For technology-specific rules, include the technology name (e.g., `java-spring-cursor-rules.mdc`)
- For feature-specific rules, use the feature name (e.g., `tactical-rmm.mdc`)

## Rule File Structure

Each rule file should follow this structure:

```
---
description: Brief description of what this rule covers
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/* 
alwaysApply: false
---
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

## Section 1

Detailed explanation with examples.

## Section 2

More detailed content.

```

## Frontmatter Options

- `description`: Brief summary of the rule's purpose (required)
- `globs`: File patterns this rule applies to (optional)
- `alwaysApply`: Whether to apply this rule to all files (default: false)

## Adding New Rules

1. Identify the category for your new rule:
   - Technology-specific (Java, Vue.js, etc.)
   - Feature-specific (Gateway, RMM, etc.)
   - Development workflow (Testing, CI/CD, etc.)
   - UI/UX development

2. Create a new .mdc file in the appropriate location

3. Add proper frontmatter with description

4. Structure the content with clear headings and examples

5. Include code examples where appropriate

6. Reference OpenFrame-specific patterns and conventions

## Best Practices

- Keep rules focused on a single topic or technology
- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples from the OpenFrame codebase
- Update rules when conventions or patterns change
- Cross-reference related rules where appropriate
- Use proper markdown formatting for readability
