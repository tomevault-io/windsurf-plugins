# Coding Standards

This document outlines the general coding standards that apply across all technologies in the OpenFrame project.

## Code Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces for Java, 2 spaces for TypeScript/Vue)
- Limit line length to 120 characters
- Use UTF-8 encoding for all files
- End files with a newline
- Remove trailing whitespace
- Use consistent spacing around operators and keywords
- Use consistent brace placement (same line for Java, new line for TypeScript)

## Documentation

- Document all public classes, interfaces, methods, and fields
- Use JavaDoc for Java code and JSDoc for TypeScript/JavaScript
- Include parameter descriptions, return values, and exceptions
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use meaningful comments that explain "why" not "what"

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, meaningful names
- Follow language-specific conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, etc.)
- Use consistent abbreviations and acronyms
- Avoid generic names like "data", "manager", "util", etc.
- Prefix interfaces with "I" in Java (e.g., IUserService)
- Use verb prefixes for methods (get, set, is, has, etc.)

## Code Organization

- One class per file
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Keep methods and classes focused on a single responsibility
- Limit method length (aim for < 30 lines)
- Limit class length (aim for < 500 lines)
- Order methods logically (public before private, etc.)

## Error Handling

- Use exceptions for exceptional conditions only
- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level
- Log exceptions with context information
- Don't swallow exceptions without logging
- Use custom exceptions for domain-specific errors
- Include appropriate stack traces in logs

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Use meaningful test names that describe the scenario
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies
- Keep tests independent and idempotent
- Test both success and failure scenarios

## Version Control

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use the imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep commits focused on a single change
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages
- Squash commits before merging
- Follow the branching strategy (feature branches, etc.)

## Code Review

- Review all code before merging
- Check for adherence to coding standards
- Verify test coverage
- Look for security vulnerabilities
- Ensure proper error handling
- Validate performance considerations
- Provide constructive feedback

## Security Practices

- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries for database access
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS
- Use secure communication (HTTPS, TLS)
- Don't hardcode sensitive information
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Performance Considerations

- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Minimize database queries
- Use caching where appropriate
- Optimize resource usage
- Consider pagination for large result sets
- Profile and benchmark critical code paths
- Avoid premature optimization
