# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

`playlist-sync` is a Python 3.10+ project managed with `uv` (see `pyproject.toml`). It has no dependencies yet and is in early scaffolding stage.

## Commands

```bash
# Run the app
uv run python main.py

# Add a dependency
uv add <package>
```

## Architecture

Currently a single entry point: `main.py` with a `main()` function. No modules or packages yet.
