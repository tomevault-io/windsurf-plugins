- The solution contains 3 projects:
    - GenJson: The main library that contains some utility classes and attributes
    - GenJson.Tests: The tests, can be ran to validate the code
    - GenJson.Generator: The source generator which will generate the code. Generated code will use the main library code.
- The generator must use Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp version to 4.1.0
- Do not upgrade the C# version or use C# 11+ features (like `required`). This generator must be compatible with Unity, and Unity is not fully compatible with C# 11.
- The tests contain TestSourceGenerator which can be used to analyze the source generated code
- Avoid memory allocations in generated code unless strictly necessary or for performance.
- Prefer switch statements or expressions over if-else chains for handling multiple cases.
- Prefer Raw string literals for test cases instead in order to avoid complex escape character sequences.
