# Deploy policy (Streamly / iptv-player)

When the user says **deploy**, **push update**, or gives a green light for production:

1. **Commit all related work** on the current branch (no leaving features on side branches).
2. **Merge** any local feature branches whose work should ship; resolve conflicts before deploy.
3. **Push** to `origin` so production matches git.
4. Run `SKIP_VERSION_BUMP=1 npm run deploy:vps` (full deploy unless deps unchanged and user asked for quick).
5. **Do not skip deploy** or leave features unmerged because of branch-name guards — the user expects what they approved to be live.

`pre-deploy-check.sh` blocks dirty trees and unmerged local branches (not “wrong branch name”). Override only when the user explicitly asks: `STREAM_DEPLOY_ALLOW_DIRTY=1` or `STREAM_DEPLOY_SKIP_UNMERGED_CHECK=1`.

After deploy, confirm health succeeded. If something could not ship, say what and why before claiming done.
