# PriceGrab — Project Conventions

These conventions apply to this repository only. They override matching global rules
(e.g., the "commits in Spanish" rule from the user's global preferences). Any rule
not addressed here continues to follow the user's global preferences.

## Commit messages

- Write commit messages in **English**.
- Use **Conventional Commits** prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`,
  `refactor:`, `test:`, `style:`, `perf:`, `ci:`, `build:`.
- Subject line: imperative mood, ≤ 72 characters, no trailing period.
- Body (optional): wrap at ~72 columns, explain the *why*, not the *what*.

## Branching & PR flow

- **Never push directly to `main`.** Always work on a feature branch and open a PR.
- Branch naming: `<type>/<short-slug>` — e.g. `feat/compare-screen`,
  `fix/decimal-parsing-es`, `chore/bootstrap-project`.
- Delete the remote branch after the PR is merged.
- Keep `main` protected (required reviews + passing CI) once CI exists.

## Publishing & remotes

- `git push` and `gh pr create` are allowed without prior confirmation, as long as:
  - The push targets a **feature branch**, never `main` directly.
  - The branch content has been reviewed by the agent against `.gitignore`, the
    constitution and this file (no secrets, no legacy prototype sources, no
    `*.aia` files, no AI assistant state).
  - When CI fails on an open PR, follow-up "fix CI" commits may be pushed to the
    **same** feature branch without asking, until the PR is green or the agent
    hits a blocker it cannot resolve.
- **Only Marco merges pull requests.** Never run `gh pr merge`, never enable
  auto-merge, never squash/rebase/merge via the API. Leaving the PR "ready for
  review" is the end state for the agent.
- **Never push to `main` directly**, not even for a one-liner. Always open a PR.
- **Never force-push to `main`** under any circumstance. Force-pushing a feature
  branch is allowed only when strictly necessary (e.g. rebase to resolve
  conflicts) and must be preceded by a note to Marco in the PR.
- Never commit legacy prototype sources (`*.aia`) or any sensitive authentication
  material (tokens, keystores, `.env`, cloud credentials, AI assistant state). Rely on
  `.gitignore` to enforce this; verify with `git status` before every commit.

## Spec-Driven Development

- All non-trivial changes flow through Spec Kit:
  `/speckit.specify` → `/speckit.clarify` (if needed) → `/speckit.plan` →
  `/speckit.tasks` → `/speckit.implement`.
- Every PR must reference its spec and confirm compliance with the principles in
  `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

## Documentation language

- User-facing documentation (`README.md`, UI strings) MUST be available in both
  Spanish and English.
- Internal engineering documentation (ADRs, specs, plans, task lists, commit
  messages, code comments) is written in English.

## Project status memory

- Keep [`docs/project-status.md`](../../docs/project-status.md) current when
  shipping a release or deferring a product idea (backlog).
- Agents should read that file (and the `project-status` Cursor rule) before
  proposing the next feature.
