# Pull Request Creation Rules

## Overview

Pull request creation should be based on the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and follow best practices for small, focused, and well-documented changes.

## Core Principles

### 1. Write Small Pull Requests
- **Small PRs are better**: Smaller pull requests are easier and faster to review and merge
- **Less room for bugs**: Focused changes reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs
- **Clearer history**: Small PRs provide a clearer history of changes and make it easier to track down issues
- **Faster feedback**: Reviewers can provide quicker, more focused feedback

### 2. One Logical Change Per PR
- Each PR should represent one logical unit of work
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes (e.g., bug fixes + new features)
- If you have multiple changes, create separate PRs

## GitHub CLI Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Verify you're in a git repository with a remote origin

### Basic PR Creation Command
```bash
gh pr create --title "Your PR Title" --body "Your PR Description" --base main
```

## Branch Creation

When creating a new branch, always branch from the latest `main` to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# Ensure you have the latest main
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## PR Title Guidelines

### Format
- Use clear, descriptive titles that explain what the PR does
- Start with an action verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep titles concise but informative (ideally under 72 characters)

### Examples
- ✅ **Good**: "Add user authentication middleware"
- ✅ **Good**: "Fix timeout issue in API client"
- ✅ **Good**: "Update documentation for new endpoints"
- ❌ **Bad**: "Changes"
- ❌ **Bad**: "Fix stuff"
- ❌ **Bad**: "WIP"

## PR Description Requirements

Every PR description must include the following sections:

### 1. Purpose of the Pull Request
Clearly explain why this change is needed:
```markdown
## Purpose
This PR adds user authentication middleware to secure our API endpoints.
```

### 2. Overview of What Changed
Summarize the key changes made:
```markdown
## What Changed
- Added JWT authentication middleware
- Updated route handlers to use authentication
- Added tests for authentication flow
- Updated API documentation
```

### 3. Additional Context
Include links to relevant information:
```markdown
## Additional Context
- Closes #123
- Related to discussion in #456
- Follows up on PR #789
- See design document: [link]
```

## Complete PR Description Template

```markdown
## Purpose
[Explain why this change is needed]

## What Changed
- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]
- [Key change 3]

## Additional Context
- [Links to issues, tickets, or previous conversations]
- [Any relevant background information]
- [Breaking changes or migration notes if applicable]

## Testing
[How to test these changes]

## Screenshots (if applicable)
[Include screenshots for UI changes]
```

## PR Creation Workflow

### 1. Before Creating the PR
```bash
# Ensure your branch is up to date
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Push your branch
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 2. Create the PR
```bash
# Create PR with title and description
gh pr create \
  --title "Your descriptive title" \
  --body "$(cat << 'EOF'
## Purpose
[Your purpose here]

## What Changed
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

## Additional Context
- Closes #123
EOF
)" \
  --base main
```

### 3. After Creating the PR
```bash
# Assign yourself as reviewer if needed
gh pr edit --add-assignee @me

# Add labels if your repository uses them
gh pr edit --add-label "feature" --add-label "backend"

# Request specific reviewers
gh pr edit --add-reviewer username1,username2
```

## Best Practices

### Size Guidelines
- **Ideal**: 1-200 lines of code changes
- **Acceptable**: 200-400 lines of code changes  
- **Large**: 400+ lines (should be broken down if possible)

### Content Guidelines
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each PR should do one thing well
2. **Complete Feature**: Don't leave features half-implemented
3. **Self-Contained**: PR should be reviewable without external context
4. **Tested**: Include tests for new functionality
5. **Documented**: Update documentation for user-facing changes

### Review Readiness Checklist
Before creating a PR, ensure:
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional commits format
- [ ] No debugging code or console.log statements remain
- [ ] No merge conflicts with target branch

## Common Commands
