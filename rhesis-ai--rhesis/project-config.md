# Playground Rules

The `playground/` directory at the project root contains ad-hoc scripts for manual testing, experimentation, and prototyping. These scripts are **not** part of the production codebase or the automated test suite.

## Path
`<project_root>/playground/`

## Running playground scripts
Playground scripts import from the SDK, so they must be run from the `sdk/` directory with `uv`:

```bash
cd sdk && uv run python ../playground/<script_name>.py
```

## Guidelines
1. Each script should have a docstring at the top explaining what it does, any prerequisites (e.g. a running backend or proxy), and how to run it.
2. Playground scripts may hardcode local URLs, API keys, and test data — they are not meant for production use.
3. Do not add playground scripts to the automated test suite.
4. Keep scripts self-contained: prefer inline configuration over shared state between scripts.
