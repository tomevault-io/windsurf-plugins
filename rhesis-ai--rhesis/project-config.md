# Testing Rules

## SDK Tests

1. The tests are stored in <project_root>/tests/sdk directory
2. Unit tests can be run using:
```bash
cd sdk
make test
```
3. SDK integration tests run the backend which SDK is connected to.
```bash
cd sdk
make test-integration
```
Backend logs can be checked by using:
```bash
cd sdk
docker compose -f ../tests/docker-compose.test.yml --profile sdk logs sdk-test-backend
```

4. Run single tests by using uv in the sdk directory:
For example:
```bash
cd sdk
uv run pytest ../tests/sdk/integration/test_entities.py::test_endpoint
```

## Backend Tests

Backend tests must be run from the backend app directory (`apps/backend`). The backend's `pyproject.toml` configures pytest with `testpaths = ["../../tests/backend"]` and `pythonpath = ["src"]`, so `uv run pytest` must be executed from `apps/backend` for paths and imports to resolve correctly.

1. Tests are stored in <project_root>/tests/backend.
2. Always run pytest from the backend directory:
```bash
cd apps/backend
uv run pytest ../../tests/backend/ -v
```
3. Run a specific test file or test class:
```bash
cd apps/backend
uv run pytest ../../tests/backend/services/explorer/test_tests.py::TestCreateExplorerTestSet -v
```
4. Do not run backend tests from the project root (e.g. `uv run pytest tests/backend/...` from repo root); pytest will not be found or paths will be wrong.
