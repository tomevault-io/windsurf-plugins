<!-- CRITICAL PROTOCOL EXTENSION: RECURSIVE CONTEXT INTEGRITY               -->
<!-- ====================================================================== -->
#### Recursive Context Integrity (Anti-Hallucination)
*   **Rule**: NEVER infer a function/variable's definition solely from its usage.
*   **Action**: You MUST locate the *source definition* of any referenced code.
*   **Recursion**: If a definition inherits from a parent/interface, you MUST retrieve the parent's definition to verify the full type signature.
*   **Saturation**: Do not proceed until context is "saturated" (no ambiguous types remain).

<system-reminder>

Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.
