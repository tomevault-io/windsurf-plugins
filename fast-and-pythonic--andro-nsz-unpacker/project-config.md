# CLAUDE.md

AndroNSZ — an Android app that unpacks compressed Nintendo Switch files
(NSZ → NSP, XCZ → XCI). Kotlin/Compose UI + a native C engine via JNI.

**Documentation entry point:** [`ai_docs/start.md`](ai_docs/start.md) — read it first.

Critical rules:
- Code comments, documentation, and commit messages — in English.
- Don't touch without an explicit request: cryptography (`aes_ctr.c`, `aes_xts.c`,
  `sha256.c`), the decompression algorithm (`ncz_decompress.c`), JNI signatures.
- Indentation — exactly 3 spaces, keeping the indentation on blank lines. See
  [`ai_docs/conventions.md`](ai_docs/conventions.md).
