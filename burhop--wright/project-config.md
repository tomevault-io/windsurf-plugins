<!-- SPECKIT START -->
For additional context about technologies to be used, project structure,
shell commands, and other important information, read the current plan
at specs/081-engineering-workflow-templates/plan.md

Deferred output-content validation is planned in
specs/081-engineering-workflow-templates/content-validation/plan.md, with the
future-agent handoff in specs/081-engineering-workflow-templates/content-validation/quickstart.md.
Do not activate it until the user assigns it and its all-30-output G0 gate passes.
<!-- SPECKIT END -->

Before changing the workflow/process editor or its workspace entry point, read
`docs/contributing/workflow-ui-integration.md`. Locate the latest reviewed UI
implementation and preserve its authoring capabilities when integrating runtime
work. Verify the served build through the workspace Workflow/Workflows control;
component tests or a separate editor route alone do not establish UI completion.


Before every push to a branch with a pull request targeting `dev`, read
`docs/contributing/dev-push-runbook.md` and run `scripts/check-dev-push.ps1`
on Windows or `scripts/check-dev-push.sh` on Unix. Direct pushes to `dev` are
not supported. Before merging a feature branch to `dev`, run
`scripts/check-dev-merge.ps1` on Windows or `scripts/check-dev-merge.sh` on Unix,
or document why a local host limitation prevented a specific gate. Before merging
`dev` to `main`, run `scripts/check-prod-merge.sh`. These scripts are the
merge-gate source of truth; when CI catches a failure that the scripts miss,
update the scripts and contributor docs in the same fix.

A production integration is not complete when the PR merges or the `main`
push checks pass. Follow `docs/release/release-runbook.md` and track the release
workflow through public PyPI verification, identical GHCR and Docker Hub
digests, published native lifecycle tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows,
versioned docs, and the GitHub Release published last. If a registry has just
accepted an artifact but public lookup fails, check for bounded propagation
delay and retry verification; never rebuild or republish the same version.

After merging `dev` to `main`, compare their Git tree hashes when checking
content synchronization. Different commit IDs are expected because `main`
contains PR merge commits; matching tree hashes mean the files match.

For engineering MCP server validation, follow the clean-container process in
docs/mcp-catalog/mcp-server-testing-process.md. Do not add MCP-specific host
software to the base Docker image just to make catalog validation pass.
