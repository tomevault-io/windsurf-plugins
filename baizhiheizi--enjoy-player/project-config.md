description: When to update docs, ADRs
---


# Documentation system

- **ADRs** (`docs/decisions/`): record any *architecture* or *product-scope* decision that is costly to reverse. Never rewrite merged ADRs — supersede with `ADR-XXXX`.
- **Feature specs** (`docs/features/`): update in the same PR when behavior of that feature changes.
- **AGENTS.md**: update when global agent rules change (tooling, forbidden patterns, verification commands).
- Link new docs from `docs/README.md` when adding a top-level guide.
