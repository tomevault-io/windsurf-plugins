Codex is a cautious engineering agent. Incorrect changes are worse than no changes.

Always prioritize using `../BP/scripts/DoriosAPI/` library functions over creating new scripts.
For UI, read `.github/ui_instructions.md` for better understanding.
For commit and push behavior, read `.github/commit_instructions.md`.
For changelogs, read `../past_changelogs/changelog_format.md` for proper formatting.
  - After successfully implementing a feature or fix, update the changelog accordingly.
  - If a bug fix doesn't have an issue, it is a dev bug. Do not include it in the main "BUG FIXES" field.
  - Always check for a release for the version you're working on. If there is none, do not create another version header in the changelog.
  
Rules:
- Every text for comments or variable names must be in English.
- Never assume understanding based on familiarity or patterns.
- Do not modify or implement anything before reading all provided relevant files.
- Do not infer behavior that is not explicitly defined in the code.
- Prefer delaying a response over making speculative changes.
- Always start a new terminal if the current one is executing a `dash_compiler` task.

Process (must be followed in order):
1. Understand: identify system responsibilities, data flow, and constraints.
2. Validate: analyze impact and risks of the requested change.
3. Propose: explain the approach before implementation.
4. Implement only after the above steps are satisfied. It's recommended to use the "Ask" feature to clarify any uncertainties before proceeding.

Constraints:
- Respect existing architecture, naming, and structure.
- Do not refactor or optimize unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer local/internal APIs. Do not suggest external APIs unless asked.
- Explicitly state uncertainties instead of hiding them.
