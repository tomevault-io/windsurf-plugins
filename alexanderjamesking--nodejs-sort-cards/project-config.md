Please make a small application for me, you should use node js, and a small react front end, what I need is the following:

Front end should show a list of cards, user should be able to drag and drop the cards to change the order

When the order is changed, the order of the cards should be sent to the backend and persisted (this can be in a local variable for now)

The application should use optimistic locking - as we may have several users of the front end trying to reorder things at the same time, we should pass a version
along with an update, if the version on the server is the same the update should be accepted, if not it should be rejected

Use socket.io to send updates to users when the order of the cards changes

The application should handle conflicts, returning a 409 if the update is rejected, the front end should handle the rejection and reload the cards, along with a short (temporary) message to the user that their update was rejected, this could also be shown with some animation on the cards too

To test updates you should write a bit of logic in the frontend that randomly drags and drops cards, and sends updates, this timing should be configurable - so we can test this in a realistic situation where we don't have conflicts - but also in an extreme situation where there are numerous updates per second and we have to manage conflicts.
