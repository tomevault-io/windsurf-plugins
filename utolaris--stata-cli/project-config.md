# AGENTS.md

`stata-cli` is a local Stata CLI with a native Rust engine (no Python), repo-local binaries, and an init scaffold for AI-driven analysis work.

## Working Rules

- Keep the repo-local binaries in `skill/stata-cli/bin/`; repo-root discovery depends on that location.
- Treat `skill/stata-cli/boilerplate/` as the source of truth for files created by `stata-cli init`.
- Treat `skill/stata-cli/` itself as the installed skill package: SKILL.md,
  references/, packages/, and bin/ ship together and are not duplicated into
  workspaces by `init`.
- The `stata-cli.skill` file attached to GitHub releases is a ZIP archive of
  `skill/stata-cli/` (top-level folder `stata-cli/`); unpack it and drop that
  folder into any agent's skills directory (Codex: `~/.codex/skills/`,
  Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/`).
- When changing CLI behavior or REPL behavior, verify the Rust tests and run real Stata smoke tests from `scene/` (set `SKIP_STATA_TESTS=1` to skip them).
- Real smoke tests should run from `scene/` and use `scene/grilic.dta`.
- The native Stata engine (`rust-cli/src/atom/stata_engine.rs`) is the only
  module allowed to use `unsafe`; it wraps Stata's `StataSO_*` C ABI behind a
  safe API. See the module docs and README.md ("Unsafe FFI") before touching it.
