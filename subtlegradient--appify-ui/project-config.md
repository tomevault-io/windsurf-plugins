# AGENTS.md

## Git Policy

- Git commits are the responsibility of the agent. Do not hand completed work back to the user with "please commit this" as a remaining chore.
- Ensure git reflects exhaustive, atomic progress: stage and commit each coherent, completed unit of work with a clear message.
- Keep commits scoped to the work performed in the current task. Do not include unrelated user changes.
- If verification is relevant, run it before committing when practical. If verification cannot be run, state that clearly in the final response.
- The user is responsible for pushing changes and managing branches. Do not push, create branches, switch branches, or rewrite branch history unless the user explicitly asks.
