# CLAUDE.md

Go Cardano node (Ouroboros). Derivable info (build targets, flags, package layout) lives in `Makefile`, `go.mod`, `node.go`, `dingo.yaml.example`. This file is only what isn't derivable.

## Testing

- No `time.Sleep()` for sync. Use `internal/test/testutil/`:
  - `WaitForCondition` / `require.Eventually` — 2–5s timeout, 5–10ms interval, lock shared state inside the condition fn
  - `RequireReceive` / `RequireNoReceive` for channel assertions
  - `context.WithTimeout` for graceful shutdown
- `make test` runs with `-race`.
- Integration tests in `internal/integration/` load real blocks from `database/immutable/testdata/`.
- Mock fixtures come from `github.com/blinklabs-io/ouroboros-mock` (`fixtures/`, `ledger/`, `conformance/`). Never add local ledger/consensus/network mocks — extend the shared library.
- DevNet (`internal/test/devnet/run-tests.sh`, see `internal/test/devnet/README.md`): use to validate any change that touches consensus, block production, header/VRF/KES/OpCert verification, chain selection, mempool, tx submission, NtN/NtC protocols, epoch boundaries, or nonce computation. The default run is an all-dingo network (three Dingo producers plus a relay) with `txpump` feeding the mempool; it validates the generic consensus and liveness suite dingo-vs-dingo and hosts dingo-only feature tests (e.g. CIP-50 pledge leverage) that have no cardano-node reference. `./run-tests.sh --conformance` brings up Dingo beside `cardano-node` for compatibility and conformance with the reference implementation. Run conformance (`internal/test/conformance/`) after every change; run DevNet additionally for consensus-affecting work, and the `--conformance` mode when validating reference compatibility.

## Documentation

- Treat `DATABASE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` as part of the change bar, like tests. Before finishing any code change, decide whether either document needs an update; update it in the same change when it does.
- Update `DATABASE.md` for any change to GORM models, migrated tables, table relationships, SQL query/API surfaces in `metadata.MetadataStore`, blob-store key layout, CBOR/offset encodings, storage plugins, pruning/tombstone behavior, or anything external Postgres/MySQL/SQLite/blob users rely on.
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` for any change to component responsibilities, package boundaries, startup/composition, EventBus topics/payloads, plugin interfaces, lifecycle/concurrency behavior, or cross-component flows among ledger, database, mempool, networking, API, and node wiring.
- In final responses, report documentation status the same way tests are reported: either list the docs updated or explicitly state that `DATABASE.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md` were checked and not affected.

## Pre-commit

```shell
golangci-lint run ./...
nilaway ./...
modernize ./...   # --fix to auto-apply
make import-boundaries
```

## Non-obvious invariants

- CBOR offsets: UTxOs/txs store 52-byte `CborOffset` refs (magic `"DOFF"` + slot + hash + offset + length), not full CBOR. Resolved via `TieredCborCache` (hot → block LRU → cold blob extract). See `database/cbor_offset.go`, `database/cbor_cache.go`, `database/block_indexer.go`.
- EventBus for async cross-component notifications: block/chain/mempool/peer events go through `event.EventBus.SubscribeFunc()`. Synchronous state queries between components still use direct method calls.
- Cert ordering: multiple certs per slot — tie-break with `Order("added_slot DESC, block_index DESC, cert_index DESC")` (`cert_index` resets per tx, so `block_index` is required to disambiguate across txs in the same block).
- Rollbacks: `Chain.Rollback(point)` emits `ChainRollbackEvent`; check `TransactionEvent.Rollback` for undo.
- Plugins (`database/plugin/`): blob = `badger` (default) | `gcs` | `s3`; metadata = `sqlite` (default) | `mysql` | `postgres`.
- Config priority: CLI > env > YAML > defaults.

## Profiling

```shell
./dingo --cpuprofile=cpu.prof --memprofile=mem.prof load database/immutable/testdata
go tool pprof cpu.prof
```
