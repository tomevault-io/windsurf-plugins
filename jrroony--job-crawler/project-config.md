# AGENTS.md

## Project goal
This repository is a job retrieval system, not a literal exact-match crawler.

The system should behave like a semantic retrieval pipeline:
- expand user-entered job titles into related search queries
- discover public job sources and job detail URLs
- recover sources from detail URLs when possible
- normalize jobs into a shared model
- filter results using title relevance and location resolution
- preserve both recall and precision

The system must not depend mainly on exact title matches.
The system must not depend only on explicit "US" text for US jobs.

## Non-negotiable rules
- Do not stop at analysis only. Make code changes.
- Do not solve retrieval problems by only adding a few hardcoded synonyms.
- Do not overclaim platform support in the UI.
- Do not treat source discovery as the only retrieval path.
- Do not rely on exact/full string title matching as the main relevance method.
- Do not rely only on raw `locationText` or explicit "US" strings for US filtering.

## Required workflow
For every non-trivial task:
1. Audit the existing implementation first.
2. Identify root causes in the current codebase.
3. Implement changes.
4. Add or update tests.
5. Run:
   - `npm run typecheck`
   - `npm test`
6. Inspect failures.
7. Fix issues and rerun until green.

## Architecture refactors
For large architecture refactors in this repository:
- follow an index-first search architecture, not a crawl-first search architecture
- keep background ingestion responsible for source discovery and source crawling
- make search requests query indexed jobs first
- use request-time crawl only as supplemental recovery, never as the primary path
- treat search sessions, incremental delivery, durable cancellation, and durable background control as required behavior
- do not claim completion for code movement alone; validate actual behavior improvement

## Architecture enforcement and self-repair
This repository runs as a live retrieval system with active background processes.
Implementation agents must enforce the following runtime guarantees:

- **Background ingestion is mandatory.** The system must support recurring, scheduled background ingestion that continuously discovers sources, crawls them, normalizes jobs, and refreshes the index. A one-shot crawl is insufficient.
- **sourceInventory must be actively refreshed.** A static or never-updated sourceInventory is an unacceptable end state. The inventory must be replenished on a schedule and reflect current source health and availability.
- **Jobs must be populated from inventory-backed crawling.** An empty or stale jobs collection after ingestion has run is a defect, not an acceptable baseline. Background ingestion must write normalized job records into persistent storage.
- **Search must return indexed jobs.** User search requests must serve results from the job index first. Request-time crawl is supplemental only. A search path that bypasses the index or returns zero indexed jobs when the index should contain data is a root-cause failure.
- **Self-repair until green.** For any large implementation task, if `npm run typecheck` or `npm test` fails after initial changes, the agent must inspect failures, fix root causes, and rerun validation until both commands pass. Stopping at a failing build or failing tests is not acceptable completion.
- **Runtime behavior must be validated.** Passing typecheck and tests is necessary but not sufficient. Agents must verify that background ingestion actually populates jobs, that sourceInventory is non-empty and refreshed, and that search returns indexed results for representative queries.

If any of these guarantees are violated, treat it as a blocking defect and self-repair before claiming task completion.

## Retrieval principles
- Separate recall from precision.
- Separate source discovery from job-detail harvesting.
- Support detail URL recovery into source discovery.
- Use family-aware and concept-aware title matching.
- Use result-time US location inference.
- Prefer controlled recall rather than brittle exact-match behavior.
- Add diagnostics so retrieval failures are explainable.

## Specialized guidance
Also follow:
- `docs/skills/index-first-search-refactor.md`
- `docs/skills/retrieval-architecture.md`
- `docs/skills/title-relevance.md`
- `docs/skills/us-location-resolution.md`
- `docs/skills/validation-loop.md`

## Definition of done
A task is not complete unless all of the following are true:
- relevant code has been changed
- relevant tests have been added or updated
- `npm run typecheck` passes
- `npm test` passes
- the implementation is validated against the task expectation, not just against compile success
- diagnostics or logs are sufficient to explain major retrieval decisions
- the final output includes root cause, files changed, validation evidence, and remaining limitations

## Anti-patterns to avoid
- Do not fix retrieval problems only by changing UI labels or wording.
- Do not fix low recall only by relaxing filters without preserving precision.
- Do not fix platform support claims without validating actual provider behavior.
- Do not patch duplicate rendering issues only in React keys if backend identity/dedupe is wrong.
