# Maintaining Design Docs

Start with [README.md](README.md) and follow [MAINTENANCE.md](../MAINTENANCE.md).

- `journeys/` owns user flows, meaningful choices, and recovery at each entry.
- `capabilities/` owns rules shared across journeys and intentional differences.
- Keep each decision in one place and link to it. Preserve stable Jxx IDs.
- Keep only scope, key decisions, consequential failures, and open design questions.
  Use headings suited to the subject; no fixed document template is required.
- Code ownership and evidence belong in `code-review/`; control placement,
  implementation walkthroughs, and completed review diaries do not belong here.
