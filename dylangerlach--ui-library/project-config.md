# Library Context
This is a React UI component library with MUI-style theming.
All components require ThemeProvider to be set up with a palette.
Components use theme colors via the useTheme() hook with inline styles.

# Component Structure
- Components are in src/components/
- Theme system is in src/theme/
- All exports are in src/index.ts
- Components use Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript types are fully exported

# Theming
- ThemeProvider is REQUIRED
- Use createTheme() to define palettes (MUI-style)
- All components use useTheme() hook to access theme colors directly
- Colors are applied via inline styles, not CSS variables
- Supports light/dark mode via useThemeMode()
