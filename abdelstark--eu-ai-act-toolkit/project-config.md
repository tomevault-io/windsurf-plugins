EU AI Act Compliance Toolkit - Agent Instructions

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is an EU AI Act compliance toolkit monorepo containing three packages:
- SDK (@eu-ai-act/sdk) in packages/sdk/
- CLI (eu-ai-act) in packages/cli/
- Web app in packages/web/

SDK API (packages/sdk/)
Exported functions:
- classify(systemDescription) - Determine AI system risk tier
- getChecklist(riskTier) - Get compliance checklist for a tier
- getTimeline(riskTier) - Get compliance deadlines
- generateTemplate(templateName, params) - Generate compliance documents
- getQuestions() - Get interactive classification questionnaire

CLI COMMANDS (packages/cli/)
- eu-ai-act classify - Classify an AI system's risk tier
- eu-ai-act checklist - Get compliance checklist
- eu-ai-act timeline - Show compliance deadlines
- eu-ai-act status - Check compliance status
- eu-ai-act generate - Generate compliance documents
- eu-ai-act report - Generate full compliance report

RISK TIERS
Valid risk classifications: prohibited, high-risk, gpai, gpai-systemic, limited, minimal

COMPLIANCE DATA
- All compliance data lives in data/*.json files
- Data is validated against JSON Schema (data/schemas/)
- Every compliance item MUST cite a specific EU AI Act Article (e.g., "Article 6")
- Run: node scripts/validate-data.mjs to validate all data files

ARCHITECTURE RULES
- Classification is deterministic: pure functions, no side effects
- The web app is fully static: no backend, localStorage only for state
- Agent skills are in skills/ directory for automated compliance workflows

KEY COMMANDS
- npm install - Install all dependencies
- npx turbo build - Build all packages
- npx turbo test - Run all tests
- node scripts/validate-data.mjs - Validate compliance data

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT provide legal advice in any generated content
- Always include a disclaimer: "This tool provides general guidance only and does not constitute legal advice"
- Every compliance requirement must reference a specific EU AI Act Article
- Keep classification logic deterministic and testable
- Data changes require schema validation before merge
