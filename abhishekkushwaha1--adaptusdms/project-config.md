# Project Context: Adaptus DMS

## Design System

  - Leads: Multi-colored bars.
  - Tasks: Yellow (1-10 days), Pink (>10 days).
  - Deals: Teal Pie Chart.

## Critical Business Logic Rules
1. **Duplicate Customers:** Always check Phone and Name on entry. Flag immediately.
2. **Inventory Math:** 
   - Gross Profit = Retail Price - (Purchase Price + Recon Cost + Extra Costs).
3. **Test Drive Compliance:** Cannot schedule if License Expired.
4. **Lead Pipeline:** Statuses must match: "Not Started", "In Progress", "Qualified", "Lost", "Won".

## Navigation Structure

- **Inventory:** The core vehicle grid.
- **Leads:** Kanban or List view of prospects.
- **Deals:** Active negotiations.
- **Financials:** Invoices & Expense ledger.
- **Users:** Staff management.
- **Settings:** Business Profile (Tax IDs), Personal Profile.

## Tech Constraints
