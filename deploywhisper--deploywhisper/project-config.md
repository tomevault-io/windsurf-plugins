# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This repository uses the BMad Method as the primary workflow for planning, architecture, implementation, and review.

Treat BMad artifacts as the default source of truth for what to build, why it matters, and what should happen next. Prefer BMad workflows over ad hoc implementation when the work affects product scope, architecture, security, integrations, release flow, or multiple stories.

## Start Here Every Session
1. Run `bmad-help` first.
   - Use it to inspect project state, detect completed artifacts, and recommend the next required step.
   - If you are unsure what workflow to run, ask `bmad-help` instead of guessing.
2. Check for project context at `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.
   - When it exists, treat it as mandatory implementation guidance.
   - When it is missing or stale for an existing codebase, run `bmad-generate-project-context` and review the generated file before implementation.
3. Prefer one BMad workflow per session/task.
   - BMad works best with fresh context boundaries.
   - For Codex CLI, treat each major workflow as a separate task whenever practical.
4. After every major workflow, ask `bmad-help` what should happen next.

## Core Operating Model
Follow the standard BMad phase order unless `bmad-help` explicitly indicates a different next step:
1. **Analysis** — optional research, brainstorming, product brief, PRFAQ
2. **Planning** — PRD / requirements
3. **Solutioning** — architecture and implementation readiness
4. **Implementation** — sprint planning, story creation, development, review, retrospective

For this repository, planning artifacts already exist, so default to **implementation mode** unless the current task is explicitly about changing requirements, architecture, or epic/story structure.

## Source Of Truth In This Repo
When these files exist, use them in this order:

1. `_bmad-output/project-context.md`
   - Repository-specific implementation rules and conventions.
2. `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`
   - Product scope, goals, requirements, and priorities.
3. `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
   - Technical decisions, constraints, system shape, integration boundaries.
4. `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`
   - Epic structure and implementation sequencing.
5. `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`
   - Current execution state for epics and stories.
6. `README.md` and codebase structure
   - Current implementation truth and run/test commands.

If planning artifacts become sharded, follow BMad's whole-document-first rule:
- `document-name.md` takes precedence over `document-name/index.md`
- only rely on sharded docs when the whole document is removed or intentionally replaced

## Recommended Workflow For This Project
Because DeployWhisper already has PRD, architecture, and epics, use this default sequence for delivery work:

### When starting or resuming implementation
1. Run `bmad-help`
2. Review:
   - `_bmad-output/project-context.md`
   - PRD
   - architecture
   - epics
   - current sprint status
3. If planning documents changed materially, run `bmad-check-implementation-readiness` before coding.
4. If sprint tracking is missing or stale, run `bmad-sprint-planning`.

### For each story
1. Run `bmad-create-story`
2. Run `bmad-dev-story`
3. Run `bmad-code-review` (recommended, not optional in spirit)
4. Implement any required fixes from review
5. Update sprint/story status and verification notes

### After completing an epic
1. Run retrospective (`bmad-retrospective`) if available in the installed module set.
2. If QA or test automation workflows are installed, use them after story completion and code review.
3. Re-check whether the next epic requires new architecture, context, or document updates.

### When scope or assumptions change
- Use `bmad-correct-course` instead of silently drifting from the PRD/architecture.
- Update the affected planning artifacts before or alongside code changes.

## Project-Specific Engineering Rules For DeployWhisper
- Preserve the product's **local-first** and **advisory-first** posture unless the active epic explicitly changes that behavior.
- Keep one shared analysis core across UI, API, and CLI unless architecture docs explicitly direct a change.
- Favor small, reviewable increments over large speculative rewrites.
- Respect the existing Python-first stack and current repository shape unless the architecture or epic explicitly introduces a migration.
- Prefer deterministic logic and evidence-backed reasoning over “AI magic” in risk-sensitive code paths.
- Avoid introducing features that persist secrets, raw credentials, or unsafe infrastructure artifacts.
- Avoid committing real infrastructure state, secrets, or production-sensitive samples.
- When behavior changes, update code, tests, and docs together.

## Current Repository Shape
Use the existing layout unless an approved architecture change says otherwise:

- `api/` — FastAPI routes and schemas
- `analysis/` — risk scoring, blast radius, rollback, incident matching
- `cli/` — headless analysis commands
- `llm/` — narrative generation and skill context
- `models/` — ORM tables and repositories
- `parsers/` — tool-specific parsers
