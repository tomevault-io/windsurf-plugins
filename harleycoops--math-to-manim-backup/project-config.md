# Agent guide

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repository.

## What this repo is

Math-To-Manim contains provider-native silos. The established `mythos/` product
remains the Anthropic-native six-agent chain driven by Claude Fable 5. The parallel
`sol/` product remains a complete GPT-5.6 Sol-native film pipeline driven
only by the Codex CLI and its cached ChatGPT login. The `grok/` product is
a complete Grok 4.6 film pipeline driven only by the xAI Responses API.
Do not route one provider through another provider's orchestration layer.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `grok/` | Independent Grok 4.6 silo: xAI Responses client, charters, harness, CLI, run ledger |
| `docs/GROK_4_6_SILO.md` | Grok architecture and deployment contract |
| `sol/` | Independent GPT-5.6 Sol silo: Codex CLI driver, film contract, harness, validation, run ledger |
| `docs/SOL_5_6_SILO.md` | Sol architecture and deployment contract |
| `mythos/agents/*.md` | The six agent charters (single source of truth; mirror to `.claude/agents/` for native Claude Code use) |
| `mythos/harness.py` | Chain runner: intent → cartographer → curriculum → math-director → cinematographer → scene-composer → codegen → verify → render → repair |
| `mythos/charter.py` | The Cinematic Charter + parsing utilities |
| `mythos/backends.py` | Model backends: Claude CLI (default), Codex CLI, OpenAI-compatible HTTP |
| `mythos/cinematography.py` | The visual grammar library scenes import |
| `mythos/service.py` | Job orchestration shared by all front doors |
| `mythos/api.py` | REST API (FastAPI) — `math-to-manim serve-api` |
| `mythos/mcp_server.py` | Operator entry for `math-to-manim serve-mcp`; tools run the Grok 4.6 chain |
| `mythos/cli.py` | The `math-to-manim` command |
| `examples/mythos/` | Flagship hand-finished films (QFT, Sound of Spacetime) |
| `docs/showcase/` | Curated GIF gallery — the art-direction target |
| `tests/` | Offline test suite (no model calls, no render needed) |
| `archive/`, `legacy/` | Retired code. Do not import from it; do not "fix" it. |

The root README is the prior product page again; Grok docs live in `docs/GROK_4_6_SILO.md`.

## Working rules

1. **Runs are cheap, renders are not.** `--offline` exercises the whole chain
   deterministically with zero model calls; use it for plumbing changes.
2. **Charters are the product.** Behavior changes in the chain usually belong
   in `mythos/agents/*.md` or `grok/agents/*.md`, not in harness code.
3. **ThreeDScene camera rule:** `move_camera()` / `set_camera_orientation()`,
   never `.animate` on `self.camera`. The static verifier enforces this.
4. **Artifacts land in `runs/<silo>/<ts>-<slug>/`** — keep them repo-local
   (never `/tmp`) so humans can inspect them. Grok writes `runs/grok/`.
5. **Tests must pass offline:** `pip install -e ".[dev]" && pytest`.
6. **Keep the README's showcase GIFs and star chart intact** in any docs work.
7. **Keep provider silos native.** `sol/` must not import Mythos prompts,
   backends, or orchestration; `mythos/` must not import the Sol client;
   `grok/` must not import Mythos prompts, backends, or orchestration, and
   must not import the Sol client.
8. **Sol is CLI-only.** Do not add an HTTP API, Responses API client, API-key
   fallback, or calculator-specific compiler to `sol/`.
9. **Grok is xAI-only.** Do not route Grok through `mythos/harness.py`. Live
   calls use `XAI_API_KEY` and `https://api.x.ai/v1`. Pytest makes no live
   xAI calls. `math-to-manim-grok doctor` live-pings xAI when the key is
   set and never prints the key. `math-to-manim serve-mcp` runs this Grok
   chain.

## Quick verification

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                                        # offline, no model calls
math-to-manim run "the heat equation" --offline
math-to-manim serve-api &  curl localhost:8642/health
math-to-manim-sol run "why Fourier modes solve the heat equation" --offline
math-to-manim-sol doctor
math-to-manim-grok run "the heat equation" --offline
math-to-manim-grok doctor
```
