# hono-preact

## Tooling notes for AI agents

**Serena MCP is configured** (see `.mcp.json`). For code navigation and symbol-level edits, prefer Serena's tools over grep + Read + Edit:

- `find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview` instead of grepping for definitions
- `find_references` instead of grepping for call sites
- `replace_symbol_body`, `insert_before_symbol`, `insert_after_symbol` for structural edits

Grep + Read remain correct for prose, config files, and quick one-offs. Use Serena when you'd otherwise re-read the same TS/TSX file multiple times to locate a symbol.

If Serena is unavailable in a session (run `/mcp` to check), fall back to native tools.

## Pre-push verification

Before `git push` (especially before opening a PR), run the same checks CI runs, in the same order CI runs them. Skipping any of these means CI catches a failure you should have caught locally, which wastes a round-trip.

The CI pipeline lives in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Mirror it locally:

1. `pnpm --filter '@hono-preact/*' --filter hono-preact build` (framework dist must be current; `pnpm typecheck` and `apps/site` resolve cross-package types through the published `dist/`, so stale dist surfaces as fake "missing export" errors).
2. `pnpm format:check`
3. `pnpm typecheck`
4. `pnpm test:coverage` (or `pnpm test` if coverage isn't needed locally).
5. `pnpm test:integration`
6. `pnpm --filter site build`

If `format:check` fails, run `pnpm format` to fix and commit the result. Do not push commits that you have not personally seen pass these six steps. The single biggest miss is `format:check`, which is fast to run and trivially fixable, but reliably forgotten.

## PR workflow

Any time a PR is opened, immediately run a deep PR review as the first follow-up step (before any other post-open work).

The deep review must include these checks beyond correctness, style, and types:

- **Replacement parity.** When a PR replaces or rewrites a subsystem (handler, hook, plugin, generated entry, resolver), enumerate every behavior the predecessor had and verify each one survives in the replacement. Read the deleted or renamed files via git history (`git show <pre-PR-sha>:path` or the PR's deletion diff). Do not trust comments in the new code that claim "X is preserved" or "X is folded in elsewhere"; treat them as hypotheses and confirm by reading the code they point to.
- **Cross-cutting concerns end-to-end.** For each request path the PR touches, trace middleware composition, auth/permission gates, caching, observability hooks, and error reporting all the way through the new path and compare to the pre-PR path. A silently dropped middleware layer (especially anything auth- or permission-adjacent) is a P0 finding that blocks merge.

## Type casts

When the code needs a cast, the cast is usually the smell. Prefer reshaping the type. Apply this when writing plans too, not just when writing code; a cast prescribed in a plan ships as a cast unless someone notices. Common reshapes that come up here:

- **`as Record<symbol, unknown>` to read a symbol-keyed property**: declare the symbol key on the value's type and use `in` narrowing or a type predicate.
- **`as <StatusCode>` to widen a literal**: type the source field as the wider type from the start (e.g. `SerializedEnvelope.status: ContentfulStatusCode`).
- **`as T` after a runtime check**: write the check as a type predicate (`function isT(x): x is T`) so narrowing carries through.

Acceptable cast boundaries (where reshape doesn't help): parsing untrusted JSON, reading FormData entries, structural reads off user-defined module exports. Don't fight these.
