description: Correct macOS install process for GRIDqlc (Qt 6.8.1 LTS, Apple Silicon). ALWAYS use this when building or installing.

# GRIDqlc macOS Install — CRITICAL RULES

## NEVER touch /Applications/QLC+.app
Install ONLY to `~/QLC+.app`. Never `cp` or `sudo` to `/Applications`. The user opens the app from their home directory.

## Qt is pinned to 6.8.1 LTS — DO NOT use Homebrew Qt
Qt is installed via **aqtinstall** to `~/Qt/6.8.1/macos/`.
**NEVER use `/opt/homebrew/opt/qt*` or `/opt/homebrew/lib/cmake/Qt6`** — Homebrew Qt is rolling (currently 6.10+) and breaks plugin compatibility.

Plugin developers must use the same Qt 6.8.1 to build their `.dylib` files — this is the plugin ABI contract.

## Qt 6.8.1 paths on this system (aqtinstall)
- `~/Qt/6.8.1/macos/bin/qmake`
- `~/Qt/6.8.1/macos/lib/cmake` ← cmake prefix path
- `~/Qt/6.8.1/macos/plugins`   ← Qt plugins (imageformats, tls, etc.)
- Qt is bundled into `~/QLC+.app` by `macdeployqt` — frameworks inside the bundle at `Contents/Frameworks/Qt*.framework`

## Install — ALWAYS use the script

```bash
cd "/Users/filipolszewski/Documents/qlc projekty/qlcplus"
./install.sh          # build + install + verify (Qt 6.8.1 auto-detected)
./install.sh verify   # verify existing install (any time)
./install.sh setup    # one-time: install Qt 6.8.1 via aqtinstall
```

`install.sh` is the SINGLE source of truth. It:
1. Checks for Qt 6.8.1 at `~/Qt/6.8.1/macos` (or `$QTDIR` env var)
2. Auto-reconfigures cmake if build dir has wrong Qt (e.g. old Homebrew paths)
3. Builds qlcplus + all I/O plugins
4. Installs to `~/QLC+.app`
5. Runs `macdeployqt` — bundles Qt 6.8.1 frameworks into the app
6. Codesigns
7. Verifies — fails loudly if anything is wrong, including wrong Qt version in user plugins

## One-time Qt install (if needed)

```bash
./install.sh setup
# or manually:
pip3 install aqtinstall
aqt install-qt mac desktop 6.8.1 clang_64 --outputdir ~/Qt \
    -m qt5compat qt3d qtimageformats qtmultimedia qtserialport qtwebsockets
```

## DO NOT run install_name_tool to patch Qt paths
Qt is bundled by macdeployqt. Patching Qt framework paths manually breaks the bundle.

## DO NOT use cmake --install manually
That skips the macdeployqt step and produces an app linked to external Qt paths (broken on other machines).

## Quick verification after install

```bash
./install.sh verify
# Must show: Qt bundled: 6.8.x (Qt 6.8.x LTS)
# Must show: No Homebrew Qt references (bundle is self-contained)
# Must show: No Qt 5 references
```

## VC Widget plugin compatibility
User plugins at `~/Library/Application Support/QLC+/VCWidgets/` MUST be built with Qt 6.8.1.
`./install.sh verify` checks and warns about Qt-mismatched plugins.
