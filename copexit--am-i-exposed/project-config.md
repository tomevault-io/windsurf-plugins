# CLAUDE.md - Project Instructions for AI Assistants

## Build & Test

- **Package manager:** pnpm (do not use npm or yarn)
- **Dev server:** `pnpm dev`
- **Build (static export):** `pnpm build`
- **Lint:** `pnpm lint`

## Code Style Rules

### No em dashes

Never use em dashes in any form:
- No literal `---` (U+2014) characters
- No `\u2014` unicode escapes
- No `&mdash;` HTML entities

Use a regular hyphen with spaces instead: ` - `

This applies to all strings, comments, UI text, metadata, test descriptions, and documentation within `src/`.

### Voice and tone in UI text

- **Never use "we", "us", or "our"** in UI copy, metadata, FAQ answers, or any user-facing text. This tool is not a person, company, or group.
- Use **passive voice** or refer to the tool by name ("am-i.exposed").
- Data is never "transmitted to us" - say "transmitted to anyone" or specify the actual recipient (e.g., "mempool.space for blockchain data").
- Correct: "Your addresses and transactions are never logged, stored, or transmitted to anyone except the mempool.space API (or your own instance)."
- Wrong: "We don't store your data." / "Your data is never transmitted to us."

### General

- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` types
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling (use semantic tokens like `bg-surface-inset` over hardcoded hex values)
- Use `motion/react` (not `framer-motion`) for animations
- Next.js 16 with static export (`output: "export"`)
- All Bitcoin amounts in satoshis (never BTC floats in logic)
- Dark theme only - no light mode toggle
- `"use client"` on all interactive pages/components (static export does not support RSC)

### Bitcoin-specific

- Support all mempool.space networks: mainnet, testnet4, signet
- Address validation must be network-aware (bc1 for mainnet, tb1 for testnet/signet)
- API: mempool.space only (no secondary/fallback APIs)
- Never log or persist user addresses/txids

### Severity levels

Use these consistently for findings:
- `critical` - red (#ef4444)
- `high` - orange (#f97316)
- `medium` - amber (#eab308)
- `low` - blue (#3b82f6)
- `good` - green (#28d065)

## Boltzmann WASM

The real Boltzmann Link Probability Matrix is implemented in Rust, compiled to WASM, and runs in a Web Worker.

- **Rust crate**: `boltzmann-rs/` - 4-phase algorithm (subset sum, input decomposition, DFS enumeration, matrix finalization)
- **Pre-built WASM**: `public/wasm/boltzmann/` - ~70KB `.wasm` + JS glue, committed to git
- **Worker**: `public/workers/boltzmann.worker.js` - plain JS (not TypeScript), loads WASM via fetch+blob URL
- **Hook**: `src/hooks/useBoltzmann.ts` - singleton worker, auto-compute for <=8x8 txs
- **UI**: `src/components/viz/LinkabilityHeatmap.tsx` - heat map in Zone 11 of ResultsPanel

### Rebuilding WASM

Requires `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `cargo install wasm-pack`.

```bash
pnpm build:wasm          # Runs scripts/build-boltzmann-wasm.sh
cd boltzmann-rs && cargo test   # Run Rust tests (23 test vectors)
```

After rebuilding, commit the updated files in `public/wasm/boltzmann/`. The worker JS in `public/workers/` is hand-written, not generated.

### Key gotchas

- Worker must be plain `.js` in `public/` - Next.js static export doesn't bundle `.ts` workers correctly
- WASM JS glue uses `import.meta.url` internally but our worker overrides with explicit fetch+blob URL
- `serde_wasm_bindgen` returns u64 as BigInt - worker converts to Number via `toNum()`
- Matrix dimensions: `[nOut][nIn]` (outputs as rows, inputs as columns), sorted by value descending
- CI builds WASM from source via `wasm-pack` (Rust deps cached)

## Session Safety

- **Always commit work before ending a session.** Uncommitted changes to tracked files can be lost between sessions (IDE auto-revert, git hooks, other processes). If work is in progress and not ready to commit to main, commit to a WIP branch. Never leave substantial uncommitted changes across a session boundary.

## Deployment Rules

- **NEVER deploy without explicit user permission.** Always ask first.
- **NEVER git push without explicit user permission.** Commit freely, but always ask before pushing to remote.
- **NEVER edit code directly on the VPS.** All changes happen locally, then commit, push, pull on server.
- **NEVER commit feedback files** or any file containing real names of testers/collaborators. Use `.gitignore`.
- **NEVER expose tester identities** in commit messages, code comments, or any pushed file.

## Release Process

- **Always run `pnpm test && pnpm lint && pnpm build` before pushing.** CI runs type-check and will fail on type errors that `pnpm test` alone does not catch. Do not push without verifying the build passes locally.
- After removing or adding dependencies, always run `pnpm install` to sync `pnpm-lock.yaml`. CI uses `--frozen-lockfile` and will fail on mismatches.
- Use `/deploy` command for the full pipeline: type-check, build, bump version, commit, push, GH Pages, Umbrel release.

### Publish New Umbrel Release

1. Run `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build` - all must pass
2. Bump `version` in `package.json` (e.g. `0.35.5` -> `0.35.6`)
3. Commit: `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`
4. Tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z`
5. Push: `git push origin main --tags` - triggers CI to build both Docker images
