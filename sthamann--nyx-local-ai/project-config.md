# Local-model safety invariants

## Special tokens never survive into persisted state

Leaked model tokens (DSML fragments, `<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>`) poison future
prompts: once stored in memory/sessions, models start imitating the junk.
`stripSpecialTokens` (src/models/client.ts) must therefore be applied at
these boundaries:

- assistant content at stream end (client.ts, `extract` mode)
- **web-sourced** tool results only (`fetch_url`, `web_search` in agent.ts)
- memory writes and the one-time migration in `MemoryStore`
- stored histories in `AgentSession.loadMessages`

**Never sanitize file/command/MCP tool outputs** (`read_file`, `run_command`,
…): the agent must see workspace content byte-faithfully — sanitizing file
reads once corrupted source that merely *mentioned* DSML tokens and sent a
model analyzing phantom bugs.

When adding a new boundary (new tool, new store), wire it in and add a case to
`.harness/smoke.mjs`.

## Tool-call parsing changes require smoke tests

Any change to parsing in src/models/client.ts (JSON extraction, DSML,
function-style calls, repair) needs a matching test in `.harness/smoke.mjs`.
Run `node .harness/smoke.mjs` — it must print `ALL PASS`.

## Other invariants

- **Secrets**: API keys live in `SecretStorage` only (`MachineStore`); never
  write them into settings, session files, or logs. The webview receives
  `hasApiKey`, never the key.
- **File writes** go through `applyWrite` → `WorkspaceEdit` (undo/dirty-buffer
  safe) with checkpoint recording (`recordCheckpointFile`) and backups. Don't
  add direct `fs.writeFile` paths for workspace files.
- **Processes**: anything long-running goes through `ProcessManager` so Stop
  (abort signal) actually kills it. No bare `exec` without a signal.
- **Untrusted content**: anything fetched from the network is wrapped with
  `wrapUntrusted` before entering the prompt; `fetch_url` keeps its SSRF guard.
- **Tool outputs** are truncated (`truncate`, 20k chars) — unbounded strings
  blow up the context and the session files.
