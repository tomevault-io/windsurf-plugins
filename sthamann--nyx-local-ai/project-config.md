description: Keep README.md in sync with the product surface, verified by the readme-check gate
---


# README stays in sync — enforced, not hoped

README.md is the product's single source of documentation. Any change to the
product surface must update it **in the same commit**:

- new/changed **setting** → Settings table + relevant feature section
- new/changed **command** → Commands table (and keybinding note if any)
- new/changed **tool** → Tools table with its default permission
- new **feature** → Highlights bullet + a "Features in depth" section + a
  numbered step in "How to test"
- version bump → status line, `.vsix` mentions, and `src/mcp/client.ts`
  `clientInfo.version`

## The gate

```bash
node .harness/readme-check.mjs   # must print "README CHECK: ALL PASS"
```

It cross-checks README against `package.json` (settings, commands, version),
the tool schemas, and the MCP client version. Run it **before every commit
that touches `package.json`, `src/agent/toolSchemas.ts`, or bumps a version**,
and always before packaging a release. It exists because a silently failing
`sed` once left the MCP client version three releases behind.
