# Release & versioning

The repo slug is **sthamann/nyx-local-ai** — it appears in `install.sh`,
`install.ps1`, README and `package.json` (`scripts.package` baseImagesUrl).
Never introduce a different slug.

## Version bump checklist (all three, always together)

1. `package.json` → `"version"`
2. `README.md` → status line (`**vX.Y.Z**`) and every `nyx-local-ai-X.Y.Z.vsix` mention
3. `src/mcp/client.ts` → `clientInfo.version`

## Quality gates before packaging

Run in this order; all must pass:

```bash
npm run typecheck
node .harness/smoke.mjs         # parser/edit logic — must print ALL PASS
node .harness/readme-check.mjs  # README/version sync — must print ALL PASS
npm run build
npm run package
```

The readme-check also catches missed version bumps (it verifies all three
locations), so don't rely on `sed` output alone — seds fail silently.

## Releasing

Releases are produced **only** by CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
`git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z` builds and attaches
`nyx-local-ai.vsix` + `checksums.txt` — the exact artifact names
`install.sh`/`install.ps1` download and verify. Never hand-upload artifacts.

## VSIX size

The package must stay ≈4–6 MB. `node_modules` ships in the VSIX (tesseract.js
is external), so when adding a runtime dependency, extend `.vscodeignore` to
strip its dead weight and check the size vsce reports after `npm run package`.
Dev-only dependencies (bundled by esbuild, e.g. `marked`, `highlight.js`)
belong in `devDependencies`.
