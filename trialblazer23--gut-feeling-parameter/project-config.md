## What This Repository Is

This is an active research project investigating whether a reinforcement learning
agent trained with **no labels and no explicit objective** can develop sensitivity
to precursor signals purely through surprise-gated intrinsic motivation.

The primary hypothesis (H1): Config D (pure curiosity agent) outperforms Config A
(supervised baseline that never sees precursor labels) on precursor detection rate,
across 5 seeds, with statistical significance (Welch t-test p < 0.05).

This is not a demo, tutorial, or prototype. Every change you make affects the
validity of a scientific claim. Read this file completely before touching any code.

## Critical Constraints — Read These First

These are non-negotiable. Violating any of them invalidates the experiment.

### 1. Config A Must Exist in Phase 2
Config A is the supervised baseline and the primary comparison target for H1.
Without it, the hypothesis cannot be tested. Config A:
- Uses the same PredictiveEncoder (LSTM) as D and E
- Trains with BCE loss on threat(2) vs normal(0) labels only
- Precursor labels (1) and post-threat labels (3) are WITHHELD during training
- At evaluation, action == 1 when model predicts threat (argmax, not sampled)
- Runs across all 5 seeds for the same number of episodes as D and E

Do not remove Config A. Do not merge its training loop with D or E.

### 2. Welford Running Statistics Must Use M2-Based Algorithm
The surprise gate threshold in ConfigD_Agent and ConfigE_Agent is computed using
Welford's online algorithm. The correct implementation tracks M2 (sum of squared
differences), not a rolling variance.

CORRECT implementation:
```python
def _update_running_stats(self, err: float):
    self._err_count += 1
    n = self._err_count.item()
    delta = err - self._err_mean.item()
    self._err_mean += delta / n
    delta2 = err - self._err_mean.item()
    self._err_M2 += delta * delta2

def _get_std(self):
    n = self._err_count.item()
    if n < 2:
        return 1.0
    return math.sqrt(max(self._err_M2.item() / (n - 1), 1e-8))
```

Do NOT use:
```python
self._err_var += (delta * delta2 - self._err_var) / n  # WRONG — not canonical Welford
```

This must be identical across Phase 1 (gfp_shared_r2.py) and Phase 2
(phase2_gpu_experiment.py). If you find a discrepancy, align Phase 2 to Phase 1.
Do not change Phase 1 scripts.

### 3. LSTM Architecture Is Windowed — Do Not Make It Stateful
At each timestep, the agent receives a rolling window of the last `window_size`
observations as a fresh input. The LSTM processes this entire window and produces
a hidden state. The hidden state is NOT maintained across timesteps.

This is intentional. Do not add hidden state persistence across environment steps.
Do not add `hx` restoration logic to the main training loop. The windowed approach
is the designed world model.

### 4. Detection Metric Must Include Precision, Not Just Recall
Precursor detection rate reported as recall only is insufficient. A random agent
always taking action==1 would score ~50% recall. All configs must report:
- `precursor_recall`: fraction of precursor steps where action==1
- `precursor_precision`: fraction of action==1 steps that were actually precursor states
- `precursor_f1`: harmonic mean of precision and recall
- `action_rate`: base rate of action==1 across all steps

### 5. Random Baseline Must Run
A RandomAgent (uniform action sampling, no learning) must run for at least 20
episodes before the main training loop. Its precursor recall and action rate
establish the chance floor. Config D must beat this floor to claim learned
sensitivity. Results stored in `random_baseline` key of statistical_analysis.json.

### 6. Do Not Modify Phase 1 Scripts
Everything in `training/v2_phase1_cpu/` (if present) and `results/phase1/` is
completed research. Do not modify, reformat, or delete these files. Phase 1 is
the historical baseline from which Phase 2 must reproduce and extend.

### 7. Precursor Base Rate Must Be Logged
The surprise composition analysis is meaningless without knowing what fraction of
environment timesteps are precursor states. Log `precursor_base_rate` per seed
per episode as part of the results. Compute it as:
`sum(labels == 1) / total_steps` in the environment after each episode reset.
