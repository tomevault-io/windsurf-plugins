## 2. Technical & Architectural Directives

### Frontend Code Generation

- **Tech Stack:** **React** with **Next.js** (App Router). Code must be in **TypeScript**.

- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** exclusively. Use utility-first classes.

- **Architecture:** Modular, component-based structure (e.g., `HeroSection.tsx`, `FeaturesSection.tsx`). Components must be reusable.

- **Accessibility:** Must adhere to **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards (semantic HTML, alt tags, keyboard navigation).

### Backend & Google Cloud Integration

- **Philosophy:** **Serverless-first architecture.**

- **Core Services:**

  - **Authentication:** **Firebase Authentication**.
  - **Database:** **Cloud Firestore** (NoSQL best practices).
  - **Backend Logic:** **Cloud Functions (2nd Gen)** using Python or Node.js.
  - **AI/ML APIs:** Integrate with **Speech-to-Text API** and **Natural Language API**.
  - **File Storage:** **Google Cloud Storage** (use signed URLs for security).

- **API Design:** **RESTful principles**. Route all Cloud Functions through **API Gateway**.

- **Security:** **NEVER** hardcode secrets. Use **Secret Manager** or environment variables.

### Deployment & DevOps (CI/CD)

- **Hosting:**

  - **Frontend:** **Firebase Hosting**.
  - **Backend:** **Cloud Functions** or **Cloud Run** (if containerized).

- **CI/CD:** Use **Google Cloud Build**. Generate a `cloudbuild.yaml` for automating builds and deployments.

- **Containerization:** For complex services, provide a `Dockerfile` for deployment to **Cloud Run**.

- **Domain Guidance:** When asked, provide steps to connect the `interprelab.com` domain to Firebase Hosting by updating DNS records (A and TXT) at the domain registrar.

### Content & SEO Directives

- **Target Persona:** "The Aspiring/Certified Medical Interpreter".

  - **Pain Points:** Career stagnation, certification pressure, lack of modern tools, complex terminology.
  - **Goals:** Skill improvement, career advancement, higher accuracy, better patient outcomes.

- **Primary Keywords:** "medical interpreter training", "AI for interpreters", "NBCMI prerequisite course", "CCHI approved training", "interpreter skills assessment", "InterpreCoach", "InterpreBot".

- **Content Structure:** Use clear headings (H1, H2, H3). Use lists for features. Always include a strong Call to Action (CTA) like "Start Your Free Assessment" or "Enroll Now".
