description: Default to Puppetmaster swarms for multi-step exploration, analysis, and implementation; only fall back to native Cursor tooling for narrow cases

# Puppetmaster is the Default Subagent Runtime

When this repo is open, Puppetmaster's MCP tools are the **primary** path for fanning out work. Do not roll your own grep/read exploration loops or invoke ad-hoc subagents when a Puppetmaster swarm is available.

## When you MUST start a Puppetmaster swarm (no permission needed)

For any user request that involves more than a single trivial change, start a Puppetmaster swarm **before** spending tokens on your own exploration:

- Broad repo investigation, audit, or risk analysis ("review this", "find issues", "what could break").
- Multi-file refactors, migrations, or cross-cutting cleanups.
- Debugging that requires tracing call graphs, data flow, or test coverage across multiple files.
- Planning the next implementation slice when scope or risks are unclear.
- Comparing approaches, surfacing trade-offs, or producing decision artifacts.

The default routing is:

1. Call `puppetmaster_start_cursor_swarm` (read-only multi-role analysis) — this is the daily-driver entry point.
2. For implementation that needs durable patches, logs, and dirty-tree guards, use `puppetmaster_start_implement` in a clean worktree — it routes to whatever platform the lock enables (cursor preferred, then claude-code). `puppetmaster_start_cursor_implement` / `puppetmaster_start_claude_implement` force a specific platform.
3. For a single fast review or plan pass, `puppetmaster_start_cursor_review` / `puppetmaster_start_cursor_plan` are acceptable lighter alternatives.

Start tools return a `job_id` immediately. Do **not** wait inside one long MCP call.

## When you MUST NOT route through Puppetmaster

Use native Cursor tooling directly for:

- Trivial single-file edits with obvious intent (rename, add comment, fix typo).
- Questions answerable from the current visible file or recent context.
- Conversational follow-ups that don't change repo state.
- Anything explicitly framed as "just answer me" / "no swarm".

## How to drive a started swarm

After kicking off a swarm:

1. Return the `job_id` to the user immediately, in one line.
2. Prefer `puppetmaster_live_artifacts_follow` (long-poll, push-style stream) over polling `puppetmaster_status` in a loop. Chain calls with the returned `next_cursor`.
3. Use `puppetmaster_partial_summary` for a current synthesis without waiting for final stitching.
4. Summarize concrete file-backed findings, risks, and open questions — never raw worker transcripts.
5. Ask for approval before implementation unless the user already approved edits.

If the swarm completes with empty findings, only verification artifacts, or a degraded Cursor SDK artifact, report Puppetmaster as **degraded** and do not treat the run as a successful analysis.

## Model routing (auto_route)

Puppetmaster ships a task-aware **model router** that picks the right LLM per task. Prefer it over hardcoding `model` in every spec.

**Auto-routing is the unconditional default for non-trivial work.** Don't wait to be handed a task list — proactively set `payload.auto_route = true` on every worker you dispatch for substantive work so each task lands on the cheapest sufficient model. Pin a `model` only when the user explicitly asks. The trivial-task carve-out still holds (no routed worker for a rename or a one-line answer — that costs more, not less), but for any work that warrants a worker, routing is on, every time.

- User registry lives at `~/.puppetmaster/models.json`. Inspect with `puppetmaster_list_models`. If empty, ask the user to run `python -m puppetmaster models init`.
- Opt a worker in by setting `payload.auto_route = true`. The orchestrator picks the cheapest sufficient model, stamps `adapter` + `payload.model`, and persists a `ROUTING` artifact tied to the task.
- Savings are tracked: `python -m puppetmaster savings` prints the read-only, local, numbers-only receipt (routing dollars saved, policy-aware + CodeGraph exploration savings). Nothing is emitted over the network.
- Call `puppetmaster_route_task` to dry-run a decision when the user asks "how much will this cost" / "what model would this use" / "why did task X run on model Y" — the response includes the picked model, estimated USD cost, and every rejected alternative with the reason.
- Per-task overrides: `payload.min_capability`, `payload.max_cost_usd`, `payload.required_tags`, `payload.routing_policy` (one of `balanced`/`cheap`/`quality`/`escalating`).
- Read `ROUTING` artifacts to answer "why this model" — the audit trail is in `payload.rejected`.

## Repo intelligence (CodeGraph)

Puppetmaster auto-injects CodeGraph context into every Cursor and Claude Code worker prompt when `.codegraph/` exists in the target repo. Look for `context:codegraph` in verification artifact evidence to confirm shared context was used.

For quick, direct repo lookups without spinning up a swarm, prefer the bundled tools: `puppetmaster_codegraph_search`, `puppetmaster_codegraph_context`, `puppetmaster_codegraph_affected`, `puppetmaster_codegraph_files`, `puppetmaster_codegraph_status`. If CodeGraph isn't initialized in the target repo, call `puppetmaster_codegraph_init` once before using the other CodeGraph tools.

## Why this is the default
