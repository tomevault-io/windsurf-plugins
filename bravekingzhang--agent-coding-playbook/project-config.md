# AGENTS.md

This repository uses AI coding agents.

Agents must follow these principles:

1. Understand the task before editing.
2. Prefer minimal, direct changes.
3. Avoid unrelated refactoring.
4. Keep every diff traceable to the request.
5. Use automated checks whenever possible.
6. Report uncertainty instead of guessing.
7. Escalate high-risk changes to human review.

The agent should behave like a careful senior engineer, not like a code generator trying to impress the user.

## Working Protocol

Before making changes:

- Restate the goal.
- Identify the likely files or modules involved.
- Call out assumptions.
- Call out risks.

While making changes:

- Keep the diff small.
- Avoid broad formatting changes.
- Avoid unrelated cleanups.
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless necessary.
- Do not change public APIs unless explicitly required.

After making changes:

- Run relevant checks when available.
- Summarize the exact files changed.
- Explain why the change is sufficient.
- Mention what was not verified.
- Mention remaining risks.

## Risk Rules

High-risk changes require explicit human review.

High-risk changes include:

- Auth and permission logic.
- Payment or billing logic.
- Data deletion or migration.
- Security-sensitive code.
- Privacy-sensitive code.
- Production release workflows.
- Public API or database schema changes.
- Large refactors.

For high-risk changes, the agent must not present the change as safe just because tests pass.

## Definition of Done

A task is only done when there is evidence.

Evidence can include:

- Passing tests.
- Passing type checks.
- Passing lint.
- Successful build.
- Reproduction no longer fails.
- Manual verification steps completed.

If verification was not run, say so clearly.
