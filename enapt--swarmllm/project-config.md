# SwarmLLM — Claude Code Instructions

> **Quick start**: Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the canonical architecture (subsystems, channels, SharedState sub-struct layout, protocols, security model) before exploring code. Per-developer dependency notes may live in `~/.claude/projects/-home-user-SwarmLLM/memory/` outside the repo.

## Project Overview

SwarmLLM is a single Rust binary that functions as a peer-to-peer node in a decentralized LLM inference network. Each node simultaneously participates in a P2P network, runs an HTTP server (OpenAI-compatible API + admin dashboard), and manages local resources (GPU/CPU compute, storage, bandwidth).

- **Language**: Rust (2021 edition)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio (multi-threaded)
- **Minimum Rust Version**: 1.89+ (set by `redb`; enforced by `msrv_claim_matches_the_dependency_tree` in `tests/repo_consistency.rs` — do not edit by hand, run that test)
- **Primary Port**: 8800 (HTTP API on TCP:8800, P2P on TCP:8810 + UDP/QUIC:8800)

## Architecture

The daemon spawns 12 subsystems as Tokio tasks wired together with `mpsc` channels:

- **NetworkManager** — libp2p swarm: Kademlia DHT + GossipSub + request_response
- **InferenceRouter** — request queuing, pipeline assembly, execution coordination
- **MessageDispatcher** — routes inbound network messages to appropriate subsystems
- **CreditLedger** — local credit balance tracking, transaction signing, gossip
- **HealthMonitor** — periodic health pings, rebalancing triggers
- **ShardRebalancer** — shard redistribution on node join/leave events
- **AcquisitionManager** — BLAKE3-verified model download from network peers
- **ApiServer** — Axum HTTP: OpenAI + Anthropic APIs + MCP server + admin dashboard + WebSocket
- **PoolManager** — device pool management, credit forwarding, invitation protocol
- **AutoShardManager** — VRAM-aware automatic shard acquisition + smart pruning of over-replicated shards
- **HfWatcher** — R112: hourly HuggingFace trending-GGUF poll, seeds wishlist + auto-promotes models above download/age thresholds to `DemandVerified`
- **UpdateChecker** — periodic GitHub release polling, SHA256-verified binary download, atomic apply

Shared state lives in `Arc<SharedState>` with `DashMap` for concurrent access. SharedState is organized into 4 logical sub-structs:
- `state.events` (`EventBus`) — `activity_tx`, `activity_history`, `dashboard_tx`, `update_state`, `ws_tickets`
- `state.credits` (`CreditPool`) — `credit_balance`, `pool_state`, `pool_registry`, `pool_tx`, `trust_manager`, `escrow_manager`, `anti_gaming`, `private_mode`, `offline_mode`, etc.
- `state.models` (`ModelMgmt`) — `acquisition_progress`, `hf_sources`, `auto_manage_*`, `model_trust`, `locked_shards`, `removed_by_user` (user-deleted shard tombstones, 08-21), `prune_history`, `wishlist` (R111), `hf_trending_cache` (R112), `shard_download_backoff` (per-shard exponential download cooldown so one stuck download can't monopolize a slot), `shards_needing_repair` (shards found CORRUPT and awaiting a fresh verified copy — written only via `mark_shard_for_repair`), `shards_pending_verification` (held shards whose EXPECTED hash changed, so their bytes must be re-checked — how a node learns from the swarm that what it serves is wrong), etc.
- `state.metrics` (`MetricsProviders`) — `node_stats`, `inference_requests_total`, `channel_metrics`, `providers_config`, `swarm_capacity` (R110), `hedge_tracker` (R136 Layer 2), `prefetch_orchestrator` (R136 Layer 3), `peer_speed` + `peer_model_warm_at` (measured per-peer prefill/decode speed — sizes segment timeouts and ranks candidates), etc.

Cross-cutting fields (identity, db, peer_registry, model_registry, executor, split_models, etc.) remain on the root struct, along with the two configs: `config` (the boot-time snapshot, for startup-only decisions) and `live_config` (the current one — **read it via `state.cfg()`** for anything the user can change while the node runs).

## Build Phases

All 20 phases complete. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for full phase history. Deferred items documented there.
