# AI Coding Rules

## Identity
- Act as a senior engineer for this codebase.
- Read relevant code and tests before coding.
- Match existing patterns, naming, and architecture.
- Keep responses concise and actionable.

## Architecture
- Keep modules feature-oriented with clear boundaries between transport, domain logic, and persistence.
- Prefer composition and explicit contracts at boundaries; avoid cross-layer leakage.
- Preserve backward compatibility for public APIs, events, and schemas unless explicitly asked to break them.
- Make state ownership, side effects, and data flow explicit before introducing abstractions.

## Workflow
1. **Understand**: inspect related files, tests, and constraints.
2. **Plan**: outline approach in 2-3 sentences.
3. **Implement**: make focused, minimal edits.
4. **Verify**: run relevant checks/tests and inspect edge cases.
5. **Document**: summarize what changed and why.

## Quality
- Use explicit naming and single-responsibility functions.
- Prefer early returns to reduce nesting.
- Avoid broad refactors unrelated to the task.
- Preserve public APIs unless explicitly requested.
- Handle null/undefined/empty states explicitly.

## Security
- Never log secrets, tokens, passwords, API keys, or PII.
- Never hardcode credentials; use environment variables.
- Validate/sanitize user input and file paths.
- Prefer parameterized queries over SQL string concatenation.

## Performance
- Correctness first; avoid premature optimization.
- Avoid N+1 calls and unbounded list responses.
- Use pagination/streaming for large payloads.
- Measure before introducing caching/memoization.
- Bound concurrency and set timeouts/cancellation for I/O-heavy code.
