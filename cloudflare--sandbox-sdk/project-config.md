# Cloudflare Sandbox SDK

This file provides guidance for AI coding assistants working with this repository.

## Documentation Resources

**Always consult Cloudflare documentation** when working on this repository. Key topics:

- API usage patterns and examples
- Architecture concepts and best practices
- Configuration reference (wrangler, Dockerfile)
- Troubleshooting guides
- Production deployment requirements

**Use the `gh` CLI for GitHub interactions.** When you need to access GitHub issues, PRs, repository information, or any GitHub-related data, use the gh CLI tool (e.g., `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, `gh repo view`) instead of trying to fetch GitHub URLs directly.

## Project Skills

This repository includes project-specific skills in `.opencode/skill/`:

- **session-execution**: Use when working on command execution, shell state, or stdout/stderr handling
- **git-commit**: Use when creating commits to follow project commit message standards
- **testing**: Use when writing or running tests - covers unit vs E2E decisions and project conventions

## Project Overview

The Cloudflare Sandbox SDK enables secure, isolated code execution in containers running on Cloudflare. The SDK allows Workers to execute arbitrary commands, manage files, run background processes, and expose services.

**Status**: Open Beta - API is stable but may evolve based on feedback. Safe for production use.

## Architecture

### Three-Layer Architecture

1. **`@cloudflare/sandbox` (packages/sandbox/)** - Public SDK exported to npm
   - `Sandbox` class: Durable Object that manages the container lifecycle
   - Client architecture: Modular HTTP clients for different capabilities (CommandClient, FileClient, ProcessClient, etc.)
   - `CodeInterpreter`: High-level API for running Python/JavaScript with structured outputs
   - `proxyToSandbox()`: Request handler for preview URL routing

2. **`@repo/shared` (packages/shared/)** - Shared utilities
   - Type definitions shared between SDK and container runtime
   - Centralized error handling and logging utilities
   - Not published to npm (internal workspace package)

3. **`@repo/sandbox-container` (packages/sandbox-container/)** - Container runtime
   - Bun-based HTTP server running inside Docker containers
   - Dependency injection container (`core/container.ts`)
   - Route handlers for command execution, file operations, process management
   - Not published to npm (bundled into Docker image)

### Key Flow

Worker → Sandbox DO → Container HTTP API (port 3000) → Bun runtime → Shell commands/File system

## Development Commands

### Building

```bash
npm run build              # Build all packages (uses turbo)
npm run build:clean        # Force rebuild without cache
```

### Testing

See the **testing** skill for detailed guidance on unit vs E2E tests.

```bash
npm test                                           # All unit tests
npm test -w @cloudflare/sandbox                    # SDK unit tests only
npm test -w @repo/sandbox-container                # Container unit tests only

npm run test:e2e                                   # All E2E tests (vitest + browser, requires Docker)
npm run test:e2e:vitest -- -- tests/e2e/file.ts   # Single vitest E2E file
npm run test:e2e:vitest -- -- tests/e2e/file.ts -t 'test name'  # Single vitest E2E test
npm run test:e2e:browser                           # Browser E2E tests only (Playwright)
```

**Note**: Use `test:e2e:vitest` when filtering tests. The `test:e2e` wrapper doesn't support argument passthrough.

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run check              # Run Biome linter + typecheck
npm run fix                # Auto-fix linting issues + typecheck
npm run typecheck          # TypeScript type checking only
```

### Docker

Docker builds are typically **automated via CI**, but you can build locally for testing:

```bash
npm run docker:rebuild     # Rebuild container image locally (includes clean build + Docker)
```

**Note:** Docker images are automatically built and published by CI (`release.yml`):

- Images are built on every push to main (for E2E testing against CF registry)
- Published to Docker Hub only when the "Version Packages" PR is merged (stable releases)
  **Critical:** Docker image version MUST match npm package version. This is enforced via `ARG SANDBOX_VERSION` in Dockerfile.

### Development Server

From an example directory (e.g., `examples/minimal/`):

```bash
npm run dev                # Start wrangler dev server (builds Docker on first run)
```

**`EXPOSE` directives**: The underlying containers primitive does not require `EXPOSE` directives — all ports are accessible in both local dev and production without them. Including `EXPOSE` is still recommended as it documents which ports your application uses (standard Docker convention).

## Development Workflow

**Main branch is protected.** All changes must go through pull requests. The CI pipeline runs comprehensive tests on every PR - these MUST pass before merging.

### Pull Request Process

1. Make your changes

2. **Run code quality checks after any meaningful change:**

   ```bash
   npm run check    # Runs Biome linter + typecheck
   ```

   This catches type errors that often expose real issues with code changes. Fix any issues before proceeding.

3. **Run unit tests to verify your changes:**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. Create a changeset if your change affects published packages:

   Create a new file in `.changeset/` directory (e.g., `.changeset/your-feature-name.md`):

   ```markdown
   ---
   '@cloudflare/sandbox': patch
   ---

   Brief description of your change
   ```

   The SDK is in beta — use `patch` for all changes, `minor` only for breaking changes. Never use `major`.

5. Push your branch and create a PR

6. **CI runs automatically:**
   - **Unit tests** for `@cloudflare/sandbox` and `@repo/sandbox-container`
   - **E2E tests** that deploy a real test worker to Cloudflare and run integration tests
   - Both test suites MUST pass

7. After approval and passing tests, merge to main

8. **Automated release** (no manual intervention):
   - Changesets action creates a "Version Packages" PR when changesets exist
   - Merging that PR triggers automated npm + Docker Hub publishing

## Testing Architecture

See the **testing** skill (`.opencode/skill/testing/SKILL.md`) for detailed testing guidance including unit vs E2E decisions, test locations, mock patterns, and conventions.

**Quick reference**: After any meaningful code change:

1. `npm run check` - catch type errors
2. `npm test` - verify unit tests
3. `npm run test:e2e` - if touching core functionality

## Client Architecture Pattern

The SDK uses a modular client pattern in `packages/sandbox/src/clients/`:

- **BaseClient**: Abstract HTTP client with request/response handling
- **SandboxClient**: Aggregates all specialized clients
- **Specialized clients**: CommandClient, FileClient, ProcessClient, PortClient, GitClient, UtilityClient, InterpreterClient

Each client handles a specific domain and makes HTTP requests to the container's API.

## Container Runtime Architecture

The container runtime (`packages/sandbox-container/src/`) uses:

- **Dependency Injection**: `core/container.ts` manages service lifecycle
- **Router**: Simple HTTP router with middleware support
- **Handlers**: Route handlers in `handlers/` directory
- **Services**: Business logic in `services/` (CommandService, FileService, ProcessService, etc.)
- **Managers**: Stateful managers in `managers/` (ProcessManager, PortManager)

Entry point: `packages/sandbox-container/src/index.ts` starts Bun HTTP server on port 3000.

## Monorepo Structure

Uses npm workspaces + Turbo:

- `packages/sandbox`: Main SDK package
- `packages/shared`: Shared types
- `packages/sandbox-container`: Container runtime
- `examples/`: Working example projects
- `tooling/`: Shared TypeScript configs

Turbo handles task orchestration (`turbo.json`) with dependency-aware builds.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

**Never use the `any` type** unless absolutely necessary (which should be a final resort):

- First, look for existing types that can be reused appropriately
- If no suitable type exists, define a proper type in the right location:
  - Shared types → `packages/shared/src/types.ts` or relevant subdirectory
  - SDK-specific types → `packages/sandbox/src/clients/types.ts` or appropriate client file
  - Container-specific types → `packages/sandbox-container/src/` with appropriate naming
- Use the newly defined type everywhere appropriate for consistency
- This ensures type safety and catches errors at compile time rather than runtime

### Git Commits

See the **git-commit** skill (`.opencode/skill/git-commit/SKILL.md`) for detailed commit message guidelines.

**Quick reference**: Use imperative mood, ≤50 char subject, explain why not how, no bullet points.

### Code Comments

**Write comments for future readers, not for the current conversation.**

Comments should describe the current state of the code. A developer reading the code months later won't have context about bugs that were fixed, conversations that happened, or previous implementations.

**Don't reference historical context:**

```typescript
// Bad: references a bug the reader knows nothing about
// Uses character tracking to avoid the bug where indexOf('') returns wrong position

// Bad: implies something was wrong before
// Start the server with proper WebSocket typing

// Bad: "prevent" implies there was a problem to prevent
// Assign synchronously to prevent race conditions
```

**Do describe current behavior and design intent:**

```typescript
// Good: describes what the code does now
// Returns parsed events and any remaining unparsed content

// Good: explains design rationale without historical context
// Assigned synchronously so concurrent callers share the same connection attempt

// Good: explains a non-obvious implementation choice
// Uses IIFE to ensure promise exists before any await points
```

**When in doubt:** If your comment includes phrases like "to avoid", "to fix", "to prevent", "instead of", or "properly" - reconsider whether you're describing current behavior or referencing something that no longer exists.

## Important Patterns

### Error Handling

- Custom error classes in `packages/shared/src/errors/`
- Errors flow from container → Sandbox DO → Worker
- Use `ErrorCode` enum for consistent error types

### Logging

**Pattern**: Explicit logger passing via constructor injection throughout the codebase.

```typescript
class MyService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {}

  async doWork() {
    const childLogger = this.logger.child({ operation: 'work' });
    childLogger.info('Working', { context });
  }
}
```

**Configuration**: `SANDBOX_LOG_LEVEL` (debug|info|warn|error) and `SANDBOX_LOG_FORMAT` (json|pretty) env vars, read at startup.

**Testing**: Use `createNoOpLogger()` from `@repo/shared` in tests.

### Session Management

- Sessions isolate execution contexts (working directory, env vars, etc.)
- Default session created automatically
- Multiple sessions per sandbox supported

### Port Management

- Expose internal services via preview URLs
- Token-based authentication for exposed ports
- Automatic cleanup on sandbox sleep
- **Production requirement**: Preview URLs require custom domain with wildcard DNS (\*.yourdomain.com)
  - `.workers.dev` domains do NOT support the subdomain patterns needed for preview URLs
  - See Cloudflare docs for "Deploy to Production" guide when ready to expose services

### API Design

When adding or modifying SDK methods:

- Use clear, descriptive names that indicate what the method does
- Validate inputs before passing to container APIs
- Provide helpful error messages with context

Note: Container isolation is handled at the Cloudflare platform level (VMs), not by SDK code.

## Version Management & Releases

### Creating Changesets

**Important:** Changeset files should only reference `@cloudflare/sandbox`, never `@repo/shared` or `@repo/sandbox-container`. These internal packages should not be versioned independently - changes to them flow through the public package. Pre-commit hooks and CI will validate this rule.

**Write for end users.** Changeset descriptions appear in GitHub releases - they're user-facing documentation, not internal notes. Focus on the problem solved and the benefit, not technical implementation details. Include how to enable or use the feature when applicable.

```markdown
# Bad - technical/internal focused

Add WebSocket transport for request multiplexing over a single connection

# Good - user-focused with clear benefit and usage

Add WebSocket transport to avoid sub-request limits in Workers and Durable Objects.
Enable with `useWebSocket: true` in sandbox options.
```

**Releases are fully automated** via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) and changesets (`.changeset/`):

- **Changesets**: Create a `.changeset/your-feature-name.md` file to document changes affecting published packages (see PR process above)
- **Releases**: When changesets exist on main, the "Version Packages" PR is auto-created. Merging it triggers:
  1. Version bump in `package.json`
  2. Docker images crane-copied from CF registry to Docker Hub (the exact images E2E tested)
  3. npm package publish with updated version
  4. Standalone binaries extracted and uploaded to GitHub Release
- **Version synchronization**: Docker image version always matches npm package version (enforced via `ARG SANDBOX_VERSION` in Dockerfile)
- **Architecture**: Images are built for linux/amd64 only, matching Cloudflare's production container runtime. ARM Mac users will automatically use emulation (Rosetta/QEMU) for local development, ensuring perfect dev/prod parity.

**SDK version tracked in**: `packages/sandbox/src/version.ts`

## Container Base Image

The container runtime uses Ubuntu 22.04 with:

- Python 3.11 (with matplotlib, numpy, pandas, ipython)
- Node.js 20 LTS
- Bun 1.x runtime (powers the container HTTP server)
- Git, curl, wget, jq, and other common utilities

When modifying the base image (`packages/sandbox/Dockerfile`), remember:

- Keep images lean - every MB affects cold start time
- Pin versions for reproducibility
- Clean up package manager caches to reduce image size
