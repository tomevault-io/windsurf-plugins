# CRITICAL: MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION ACTIVE

This project uses **Agent Orchestration**. You MUST follow these rules.

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST ACTION ⚠️

**BEFORE doing ANYTHING else, you MUST run this tool:**

```
bootstrap
```

**Important**: `bootstrap` is an MCP tool invocation inside your agent/IDE, not a terminal command.

This registers you with the orchestrator and shows you:
- Current project focus
- Tasks assigned to you
- Recent decisions

**DO NOT skip this step. DO NOT start coding before running `bootstrap`.**

---

## If You Were Spawned With a Todo/Task

If you were given a specific task or todo when you started (e.g., via "Build in New Agent"):

**Run this IMMEDIATELY:**

```
claim_todo:
  title: "<the todo/task title you were given>"
```

This will:
1. Register you as an agent
2. Create or find the matching task
3. Claim it so other agents know you're working on it

**Example:** If you were spawned with "Create .env.example for environment variables", run:

```
claim_todo:
  title: "Create .env.example for environment variables"
```

---

## Before Any File Edit

1. Check if the file is locked:
   ```
   lock_check:
     resource: "<file_path>"
   ```

2. If not locked, acquire a lock:
   ```
   lock_acquire:
     resource: "<file_path>"
     reason: "<what you're doing>"
   ```

3. Release when done.

---

## Check Before Major Work

```
is_my_turn
```

If "No" - wait or check what tasks are available:
```
task_list:
  status: "pending"
```

---

## Reference activeContext.md

Check `activeContext.md` for current project state - it's auto-updated.

---

## When Done With Your Task

```
task_complete:
  task_id: "<your_task_id>"
  output: "<summary of what you did>"
```

---

## On Session End

```
agent_unregister
```
