# Sub-Agent Rules

You are a **sub-agent** spawned to work on a specific task. Follow these rules.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FIRST STEP ⚠️

You were spawned to work on a specific task. **IMMEDIATELY** claim it:

```
claim_todo:
  title: "<the task you were given>"
  description: "<details if any>"
```

**Important**: tool calls like `claim_todo` / `bootstrap` are MCP tool invocations inside your agent/IDE, not terminal commands.

**DO NOT start coding until you have claimed your task.**

This:
1. Registers you with the orchestrator
2. Creates the task if it doesn't exist
3. Assigns it to you
4. Shows you the **research checklist** based on task complexity

---

## 🔬 Research-First Workflow

After claiming, you'll see a research checklist based on task complexity:

| Complexity | Research Required |
|------------|-------------------|
| `trivial` | None - start immediately |
| `simple` | context, files |
| `moderate` | context, files, requirements |
| `complex` | context, files, requirements, design |

### For Non-Trivial Tasks

**BEFORE coding**, document your research:

1. **Context** - Understand the current state:
   ```
   memory_set:
     key: "understanding"
     value: "<what you learned about the codebase>"
     namespace: "research:<task_id>:context"
   ```

2. **Files** - Identify affected files:
   ```
   memory_set:
     key: "affected_files"
     value: "<list of files you'll modify>"
     namespace: "research:<task_id>:files"
   ```

3. **Requirements** (moderate/complex):
   ```
   memory_set:
     key: "specs"
     value: "<requirements, acceptance criteria, edge cases>"
     namespace: "research:<task_id>:requirements"
   ```

4. **Design** (complex only):
   ```
   memory_set:
     key: "architecture"
     value: "<design decisions, component structure>"
     namespace: "research:<task_id>:design"
   ```

### Mark Research Complete

When all items are documented:

```
research_ready:
  task_id: "<your_task_id>"
```

### Then Start Implementation

```
task_claim:
  task_id: "<your_task_id>"
```

---

## Check Research Status

To see what's done and what's missing:

```
research_status:
  task_id: "<your_task_id>"
```

---

## While Working

1. **Lock files** before editing:
   ```
   lock_acquire:
     resource: "<file_path>"
     reason: "<what you're doing>"
   ```

2. **Update progress** periodically:
   ```
   task_update:
     task_id: "<your_task_id>"
     progress: 50
   ```

3. **Store findings** for others:
   ```
   memory_set:
     key: "<finding>"
     value: "<details>"
     namespace: "findings"
   ```

---

## When Done

1. Complete the task:
   ```
   task_complete:
     task_id: "<your_task_id>"
     output: "<summary of what you did>"
   ```

2. Release any locks:
   ```
   lock_release:
     resource: "<file_path>"
   ```

3. Unregister:
   ```
   agent_unregister
   ```

---

## If Blocked

Store the blocker so others know:
```
memory_set:
  key: "blocker_<issue>"
  value: "<what's blocking you>"
  namespace: "blockers"
```

---

## Important Rules

1. **ALWAYS claim your task first** with `claim_todo`
2. **ALWAYS complete research** before implementation (non-trivial tasks)
3. **ALWAYS lock files** before editing shared resources
4. **ALWAYS complete your task** when done
5. **Check shared memory** before making decisions that affect others
