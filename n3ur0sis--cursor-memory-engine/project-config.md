description: Recall shared and local memory before acting

# Memory Recall

- Shared repo memory lives in `.cursor-memory/shared/*.jsonl`.
- Local private memory lives in `.cursor-memory/local/*.jsonl`.
- Before non-trivial work, run `tools/agent/recall.sh` with the best available `--files`, `--tags`, or `--query`.
- Prefer file-scoped recall over broad recall to keep token usage low.
- Treat shared decisions, conventions, workflows, and pitfalls as repo defaults unless the user overrides them.
- Treat local preferences and active session packets as user guidance, not repo-wide truth.
- Ignore expired, archived, or superseded memory entries.
