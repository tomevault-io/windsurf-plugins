# Mixle Core working rules

Mixle Core provides composable probability, inference, execution, evaluation,
and evidence primitives shared across the Mixle portfolio. Domain physics,
data acquisition, deployment orchestration, and project-specific policy belong
in their owning projects.

Before governed work, read and follow AGENTS.md in the Mixle status
repository. Resolve the active release and task profile from status instead of
inferring them from a branch name. As of this document version, development
targets release 0.8.1 on release/0.8.1 (the 0.8.0 candidate tree; 0.8.0 was never published, D-0212).

## Local boundaries

- Preserve unrelated dirty work and use a clean worktree when ownership is
  unclear.
- Keep public behavior composable, typed, provider-neutral, and fail-closed at
  invalid scientific boundaries.
- Do not treat experimental modules, plans, filenames, or generated API pages
  as proof of maturity.
- Keep compatibility, uncertainty, unsupported cases, and remaining gaps
  explicit.
- Local test commands must be narrowly selected and terminated at 30 seconds.
  Broader matrices belong in hosted checks.
- Target the active release branch, include the required release/work/change
  metadata in every pull request, and use neutral branch and change names.
- Commits and identity metadata describe the software change only and contain
  no tool-generation or automated authorship attribution.

## Documentation map

- Project purpose and boundaries: docs/charter.md
- Architecture and failure modes: docs/architecture.md
- Public contracts and compatibility: docs/contracts.md
- Development and testing: docs/development.rst and docs/testing.md
- Security and scientific validity: docs/security.md and
  docs/scientific-validity.md
- Operations, releases, and migrations: docs/operations.rst,
  docs/releases.md, and docs/migrations/
- User guides and generated API reference: docs/index.rst and docs/api/

Source, tests, immutable revisions, and accepted evidence establish current
capability. Status connects those facts to requirements and release scope.
