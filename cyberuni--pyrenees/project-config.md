# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

1. Always place rule files in `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/`:

  ```
  .cursor/rules/
  ├── your-rule-name.mdc
  ├── another-rule.mdc
  └── ...
  ```

2. Follow the naming convention:

  - Use snake_case for filenames
  - Always use .mdc extension
  - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:

  ```
  PROJECT_ROOT/
  ├── .cursor/
  │   └── rules/
  │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
  │       └── ...
  └── ...
  ```

4. Never place rule files:

  - In the project root
  - In subdirectories outside `.cursor/rules`
  - In any other location

5. Cursor rules have the following structure:

````
---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/*
alwaysApply: false
---

# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines
4. Add this instruction: "when you use this rule file, let me know this rule file is being used in the chat by mentioning the rule filename."

Example:

```typescript
// ✅ Good example
function goodExample() {
  // Implementation following guidelines
}

// ❌ Bad example
function badExample() {
  // Implementation not following guidelines
}
```
````

6. Default rule type to `Agent Requested` and add the rule purpose to the `description`.

7. Update [master.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/master.mdc) to reference the new rule and describe its purpose
