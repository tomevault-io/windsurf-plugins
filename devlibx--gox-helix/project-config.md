## Worker Component Development

We are building a new, resilient `worker` component for task execution and coordination.

### High-Level Plan:
1.  **New Package Structure:** The worker component is split into an interface and a MySQL implementation:
    *   `pkg/worker/`: Defines the abstract `Worker` interface.
    *   `pkg/worker/mysql/`: Provides the concrete MySQL-based implementation.

2.  **Database Schema:** A new `helix_workers` table will be created to register and track workers. It will be partitioned by the `created_at` month to ensure long-term performance.

3.  **Documentation:**
    *   A new `pkg/worker/GEMINI.md` file will store concepts and context for the worker component.
    *   This root `GEMINI.md` file will track the high-level project status.

4.  **Examples:** A new `examples/` directory at the project root will provide runnable examples for all helix components. The worker examples will demonstrate `go-fx` dependency injection and integration with the `domain` component.
