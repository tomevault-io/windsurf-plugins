# Loom Orchestration - Repository Guide (AGENTS.md)

This repository uses **Loom** for AI-powered development orchestration.

**Loom Version**: 0.18.0
**Installation Date**: 2026-08-10

> **Dual-runtime status**: this file is the runtime-neutral instruction anchor
> read by AGENTS.md-aware runtimes (OpenAI Codex CLI and others — see
> https://agents.md). Claude Code additionally reads the richer `.loom/CLAUDE.md`
> sibling as its primary format; the content below is a strict subset extracted
> from that same source, so the two files cannot diverge. Anything marked
> **Claude Code only today** (see the end of this file) is not yet portable to
> other runtimes — perform the equivalent `gh` / `git` / `./.loom/scripts/*`
> steps directly instead.

## What is Loom?

Loom is a CLI + daemon for AI-powered development orchestration. It coordinates
AI development workers using git worktrees and a forge (GitHub or Gitea) as the
coordination layer, via manual roles, continuous autonomous orchestration (the
Rust `loom-daemon` binary), and a local tmux agent pool.

**Loom Repository**: https://github.com/rjwalters/loom

> **Forge note**: The `gh` commands shown below are for GitHub. For Gitea
> repositories, Loom's scripts handle API calls internally — the label-based
> workflow is identical regardless of forge.

## Orchestration Architecture

Loom decomposes development into three coordination tiers, with the forge
(GitHub / Gitea) as the shared state.

| Tier | Entry point | Purpose | Mode |
|------|-------------|---------|------|
| Tier 3 | Human | Oversight — approve proposals, handle edge cases | Observer |
| Tier 2 | `loom-daemon` (MCP) + tmux agent pool | Multi-issue dispatch + scheduled support roles | Continuous |
| Tier 1 | `/loom:sweep <issue>` | Single-issue lifecycle (Curator → Merge) | Per-issue |
| Tier 0 | `/loom:builder`, `/loom:judge`, etc. | Task execution — single focused work units | Per-task |

## Label-Based Workflow

Agents coordinate through labels. See `.github/labels.yml` for full definitions.

**Issue Lifecycle**:
```
(created) → loom:triage → loom:curating → loom:curated → loom:issue → loom:building → (closed)
           ↑ filer        ↑ Curator        ↑ Curator      ↑ human     ↑ Builder
```

**PR Lifecycle**:
```
(created) → loom:review-requested → loom:pr → (merged)
           ↑ Builder                ↑ Judge    ↑ Champion or human
```

**Proposal Lifecycle**:
```
(created) → loom:architect/loom:hermit/loom:auditor → (evaluated) → loom:issue
           ↑ Architect/Hermit/Auditor                 ↑ Champion    ↑ Ready for Builder
```

**Epic Lifecycle**: `loom:epic` → phased `loom:architect` + `loom:epic-phase`
child issues.

**Escape-hatch / status labels**: `loom:blocked` (implementation blocked, needs
help), `loom:operator-only` (requires human action outside automation —
credentials, infra, hardware; skipped by autonomous dispatch), `loom:abort`
(signal to abort in-flight work for this issue, returns to `loom:issue`),
`loom:urgent`. Priority axis: `tier:goal-advancing` / `tier:goal-supporting` /
`tier:maintenance`.

### REST vs GraphQL for forge queries

Prefer forge REST calls over GraphQL-backed convenience commands when GraphQL is
rate-limited or exhausted (they share separate hourly budgets). In practice:
read and mutate issues/labels via `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:number`
(and the `--method PATCH`/`POST` forms) rather than GraphQL-backed
`gh issue list --label` / `gh issue view` queries when GraphQL quota is tight.
The REST path stays available after GraphQL is exhausted, so it is the reliable
fallback for issue reads, edits, and label changes during heavy dispatch.

### Issues Are Suggestions (Role Autonomy)

Filed issues are the *input queue*, not mandates. Curator, Builder, and Judge
may **close** or **rescope** an issue — with a stated rationale — when building
it is not the best outcome. Comment the rationale before closing; rescope
instead of closing when the core is worth keeping (drop back to
`loom:triage`/`loom:curated`, removing `loom:issue`, so it isn't re-dispatched
with a stale scope). Never close an issue that encodes a pending human
decision — route it to `loom:blocked` or `loom:operator-only` instead.

## Git Worktree Workflow

Loom uses git worktrees to isolate agent work. **Issue Worktrees**
(`.loom/worktrees/issue-N`) hold issue-specific work for Builder agents.

```bash
gh issue edit 42 --remove-label "loom:issue" --add-label "loom:building"
./.loom/scripts/worktree.sh 42 && cd .loom/worktrees/issue-42
# ... work, commit ...
git push -u origin feature/issue-42
gh pr create --label "loom:review-requested"
```

- Always use `./.loom/scripts/worktree.sh <issue-number>` (writes a
  `.loom-managed` sentinel that authorizes cleanup). **Never run `git worktree`
