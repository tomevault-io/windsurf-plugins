# Complex tasks: Plan + Todo are NON-WAIVABLE (binding)

The general "Plan first" + "Todo list always" rules (see `sdd-workflow.mdc`) are defaults — a user can waive them on a trivial change. For **complex tasks** the rules are **non-waivable** and there is no shortcut.

## A task is "complex" if any of these apply

- **More than 2 files** in the touch list (or the spec / refactor will plausibly touch more than 2).
- **Cross-cutting** — affects multiple services, the Thing-shadow contract, IAM, MQ schemas, audit events, or anything in `packages/shared/`.
- **SDD-tracked epic / story** is introduced or modified.
- **API contract, data model, or migration** is added / changed.
- **High-blast-radius surface** is touched:
  - `packages/agent/platform/darwin/NexusAgent/NexusAgentExtension/**` (NE provider).
  - Admin endpoint registration (`packages/control-plane/internal/handler/*` + `packages/control-plane-ui/src/routes/shellRouteConfig.tsx`).
  - IAM policies / catalog / seed.
  - Token-field stamping in AI Gateway.
  - Kill switch / emergency passthrough / credential encryption.

## What "non-waivable" means concretely

Before writing any code change that meets one of the above conditions:

1. **Plan Mode** is mandatory. Write a plan (approach, scope, risks, file touch list).
2. **Todo list** is mandatory. Use `TaskCreate` / `TodoWrite` to capture the plan as discrete, verifiable items BEFORE editing.
3. **Pre-edit reading** (the 3-doc rule, `pre-edit-reading.mdc`) is mandatory.

A user instruction like "skip the plan" does NOT waive the gate on a complex task. **Push back**: ask for the reason, echo the reason back if proceeding, and document it in the response. A bare "skip" without reason is not a valid waiver.

## Examples

| Task | Complex? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Fix typo in `docs/developers/architecture/overview.md`" | No | 1 file, doc-only, no spec change. |
| "Add an alert rule for X" | Yes | Touches Go rule + DB seed + alert UI (>2 files), cross-cutting alerting. |
| "Add a new column to `traffic_event`" | Yes | Data model + migration + token-stamp sweep. |
| "Tweak a Provider model price" | No (small) | Single seed row; 1 file. |
| "Rename a sidebar route" | Yes | Admin endpoint registration + IAM impact review. |
| "Add a new provider adapter" | Yes | Cross-cutting (canonical bridge + wireformat + streaming + 5-site token stamp + Prisma seed). |
| "Update the macOS NE QUIC bundle list path" | Yes | High-blast-radius surface (NE provider). |

## Why this rule exists

Complex changes touch surfaces where silent failures are easy to ship: NRN/IAM drift produces silent 403s, missing token-stamp sites leave prod cache columns NULL, migration timestamp clashes are skipped without error, NE provider hangs take down the host's network. Plan + Todo is the cheapest insurance against those failure modes — and non-waivable on complex tasks for that reason.

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval WITH a stated reason** in chat. A bare "skip" without reason is not a valid waiver.
