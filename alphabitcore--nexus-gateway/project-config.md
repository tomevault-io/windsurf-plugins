description: VirtualKey org resolution has TWO join chains (Project for application VKs, Owner for personal VKs); vkSelectSQL must COALESCE both or personal VKs silently return NULL org

# VK org resolution — two join chains (binding)

`packages/ai-gateway/internal/store/virtualkey.go:vkSelectSQL` resolves `VirtualKey → Organization` through TWO independent chains:

| VK type | Chain |
|---|---|
| `application` | `VirtualKey.projectId` → `Project` → `Organization` |
| `personal` | `VirtualKey.ownerId` → `NexusUser` → `Organization` |

The SQL JOINs both and `COALESCE`s the application chain first.

## Required SQL pattern

```sql
LEFT JOIN "Project"      p     ON vk."projectId" = p.id
LEFT JOIN "Organization" org   ON p."organizationId" = org.id
LEFT JOIN "NexusUser"    u     ON vk."ownerId" = u.id
LEFT JOIN "Organization" u_org ON u."organizationId" = u_org.id

COALESCE(p."organizationId", u."organizationId") AS organization_id
COALESCE(org.name,           u_org.name)         AS organization_name
COALESCE(org.timezone,       u_org.timezone)     AS organization_timezone
```

## When to apply

Touching any of:
- `vkSelectSQL` itself (or any sibling SELECT that joins through Project/Org/NexusUser)
- A new column on `traffic_event` that depends on the VK's parent (timezone, billing account, primary AccountManager, parent org id)
- A new VK type beyond `application` / `personal`
- The audit pipeline's `identity` JSONB stamping

## Why this matters

Latent bugs in the personal-VK code path hide indefinitely when traffic is dominated by application VKs — a missing join surfaces only on the first personal-VK request. Touching personal-VK-adjacent code without testing both VK types = silent NULL columns in prod. Memory anchor: [[feedback_vk_org_dual_join_chain]].

## Forbidden

- "Simplifying" the SQL by dropping the second `LEFT JOIN` or the `COALESCE`. The two `Organization` joins via different aliases (`org`, `u_org`) are load-bearing.
- Adding a Go-side fallback in caller code (e.g. "if `meta.OrganizationID == ""` then look up `meta.OwnerID` and read `nexus_user.organizationId`"). The fallback belongs in SQL — caller code reads the resolved value, not raw chains.
- Adding a new VK-derived column without verifying it has both chains' coverage.

## Tests

String-level pins in `packages/ai-gateway/internal/store/virtualkey_sql_test.go` lock the COALESCE shape + both LEFT JOINs. Refactors that "simplify" the SQL trip these tests in CI.
