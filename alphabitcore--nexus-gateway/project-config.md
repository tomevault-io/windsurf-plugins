description: Proactively offer a handoff document when a session is approaching context capacity or closing out a major program

# Session handoff at context-full

> Canonical text lives in **`CLAUDE.md`** under Mandatory rules. This rule is the IDE-side surfacing; when this file disagrees with `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md` wins.

## When to trigger

Proactively offer the handoff workflow when **any** of these apply:

- The conversation is approaching the auto-compact threshold (the assistant senses long context, ~150k+ tokens, or the IDE / harness signals "context full").
- A multi-phase program is closing out (e.g., the OSS-readiness review's Phase 4 capstone).
- Tool-call turn count is high (>~50 turns of accumulated state).
- A major `git push` just landed work the next session needs to build on.

## What the handoff document contains

Typical location: `docs/handoffs/program-name.md` for repo-tracked plans, or `<program-area>/HANDOFF.md` for area-local plans, or `/tmp/<program>-handoff.md` for local-only (less reliable).

Required sections (mirror the canonical example):

1. **Mission** — program goal + current phase.
2. **Architecture model** — load-bearing facts the next session needs to design / debug against without re-reading the whole codebase. Keep dense (tables ok).
3. **API / surface inventory** — what the program operates on.
4. **Work units catalog** — concrete units the next session executes (scenarios, modules, tasks).
5. **Existing infrastructure** — what to build on, what to avoid rewriting.
6. **Binding rules** — pointers into CLAUDE.md + memory anchors the next session must load.
7. **Recent changes affecting the work** — renames, deletions, contract changes since the program plan was first drafted.
8. **Suggested program structure** — phases + first concrete steps.
9. **Repo state snapshot** — branch / tip commit / known dirty WIP from parallel sessions.

## Why on-disk, not just memory

- Maintainer-local memory persists across sessions but is one-line indexed; can't carry a 300-line architecture map.
- Auto-compact summarizes the conversation but loses fidelity on specifics (file paths, struct fields, contract details).
- An on-disk handoff document is **the single source of truth** the next session reads. Memory anchor + on-disk plan together = full handoff.

## Canonical pattern

The **structural anchor** lives at [`docs/developers/workflow/handoff-template.md`](../../docs/developers/workflow/handoff-template.md) — that template documents the 9-section shape every handoff doc fills. Worked examples (program-specific artifacts that may rename / move over their program's lifetime) are listed in the template; the template itself is stable.

## What the rule asks of the assistant

When the trigger conditions hold, the assistant should:

1. Surface in plain language: "We've been at this a while / context is filling up / Phase X just closed — recommend writing a handoff doc and switching sessions."
2. Offer a concrete location for the handoff doc.
3. Generate the doc with the 9 sections above (filled with the in-flight program's actual content, not boilerplate).
4. Optionally create a maintainer-local memory entry (project-type) anchoring it.
5. Commit + push the handoff doc.
6. Confirm with the user that the next session can pick up from the plan + memory anchor.

If the user declines (says continue), respect that; the rule is "offer," not "force."
