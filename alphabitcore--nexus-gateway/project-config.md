# Token-field stamp sweep (binding)

You are editing AI Gateway provider / proxy code. **Adding a new usage / token field requires 5 stamp sites, not just the obvious one.** Missing the 4 cache-side sites = all prod cache traffic NULL on the new column. Memory anchor: [[feedback_token_field_handler_sweep]].

**Read `docs/developers/architecture/services/ai-gateway/provider-adapter-architecture.md` §5 BEFORE editing.**

## The 5 stamp sites

1. **`handleNonStream`** — non-streaming response path.
2. **`handleStream`** — streaming response path (at stream end).
3. **`proxy_cache.go:cacheStoreNonStream`** — cache write path for non-streaming.
4. **`proxy_cache.go:cacheStoreStream`** — cache write path for streaming.
5. **`proxy_cache.go:cacheRead*`** — cache read path (deserialise the stamped value).

## Checklist when adding a token field

- [ ] Field added to `Usage` struct in `providers/types.go`.
- [ ] Column added to `traffic_event` schema (Prisma + migration).
- [ ] Stamped in `handleNonStream`.
- [ ] Stamped in `handleStream`.
- [ ] Stamped in `cacheStoreNonStream`.
- [ ] Stamped in `cacheStoreStream`.
- [ ] Deserialised in `cacheRead*`.
- [ ] Unit test exercises both non-stream and stream cache paths.
- [ ] Smoke test confirms the new column is non-NULL after a cache hit + cache miss.

## Why it matters

The cache paths are easy to forget — they share the data layout with the live paths but live in `proxy_cache.go`, a separate file. Stamping `handleNonStream` only is the canonical mistake; cache traffic then writes NULL for the new column and the failure is silent until an analytics dashboard notices.

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval** in chat.
