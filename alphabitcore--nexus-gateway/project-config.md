# Architecture doc triggers — binding

Before editing code in any of the areas listed in `docs/developers/architecture/README.md`, you **MUST** first read the listed architecture doc(s).

This rule is one of the **three required reads** before any code change (see `pre-edit-reading.mdc` for the full requirement: architecture + feature + conventions). It operationalises Step 1 of the Mandatory Development Workflow in `CLAUDE.md` ("Architecture") with per-module precision.

## How to apply

When the user asks you to edit code, before writing any change:

1. Open `docs/developers/architecture/README.md`.
2. Find the row whose "Editing area / file glob" matches.
3. Open and read the listed doc(s).
4. If your edit area is **not** covered by any row, that itself is a signal — either the architecture is undocumented (raise it with the user before continuing) or this is a new subsystem that needs its own doc + row.

## What to do if you're refactoring

If your PR introduces a new architectural subsystem:

1. Write the new `docs/developers/architecture/<service>/<name>-architecture.md` first (or in the same PR, ordered before code).
2. Append the new row to `docs/developers/architecture/README.md` in the same PR.
3. CI lockstep (`npm run check:arch-doc-triggers`) will fail if either side is missing.

## What this rule is NOT

- It is **not** a substitute for the Plan / Todo discipline in CLAUDE.md.
- It is **not** asking you to read every doc — just the ones for the area you are touching.
- It does **not** require updating the doc unless the architecture itself is changing.

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval** in chat.
