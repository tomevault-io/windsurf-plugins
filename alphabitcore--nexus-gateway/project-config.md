# Development-phase policy: no backward compatibility, no defer (binding)

Pre-GA, no installed users. Treat all refactoring as greenfield.

## Rules

1. **Delete obsolete code / tables / endpoints / configs outright** when replacing them — no parallel "legacy" paths.
2. **No phased compatibility rollouts** — specs / plans must not contain "Phase 1 keeps old behavior, Phase 2 migrates".
3. **No `@deprecated` markers kept alive**, no "cleanup later" TODOs, no "will remove after X ships".
4. **No data-migration code for dev-only records** — fresh schema + seed is acceptable.
5. **No feature flags for rollback** — rollback is `git revert`.

"Phase" in plans means **order of work**, not **compatibility layer**.

## Why

Pre-GA means we don't owe migration paths to anyone. Every parallel-old-and-new branch is a fork that has to be reconciled, tested, and eventually torn out. Pay that cost only after GA, never before.

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval** in chat.
