description: Read 3 docs before changing code (architecture + feature + conventions)

# Pre-edit reading — binding 3-doc requirement

Before writing any code change, you **MUST** read all three of:

1. **Architecture doc(s)** — find your edit area in `docs/developers/architecture/README.md` and open the listed doc(s).
2. **Feature doc(s)** — if the change affects a user-visible surface, open the matching doc:
   - CP-UI menu sections → `docs/users/features/cp-ui/<section>.md`
   - Agent-UI pages → `docs/users/features/agent-ui/<page>.md`
   - Cross-feature flows (admin → CP → Hub → effect → audit) → `docs/users/features/flows/<flow>.md`
3. **Conventions** — `docs/developers/workflow/conventions.md` for code style, naming, idioms, commit style, PR review checklist.

This rule keeps three things from drifting apart:

- **Architecture** (what the code is supposed to do structurally).
- **User-facing surface** (what the human-readable contract looks like).
- **Code style** (so the change reads consistently with the rest of the repo).

A change that lands without consulting all three is the failure mode that causes architecture rot under new contributors.

## How to apply

When the user asks you to edit code:

1. Read `docs/developers/architecture/README.md` → find row matching the edit area → open the listed architecture doc(s).
2. Identify the affected user-facing surface (if any) and open the matching feature doc.
3. Open `docs/developers/workflow/conventions.md` if you have not internalised it for this language.
4. Then write code.

## What if a doc is missing?

- **No architecture doc for the edit area** → raise it with the user. Either the architecture is genuinely undocumented (start a new arch doc + trigger row in the same PR) or it's a small piece of an existing area and the relevant arch doc covers it implicitly.
- **No feature doc for a user-visible change** → raise it with the user. If you're adding a new CP-UI section or Agent-UI page, add the feature doc in the same PR.
- **No conventions for what you're doing** → if your work is genuinely a new style decision (e.g., introducing a third UI tier), raise it and propose an addition to `docs/developers/workflow/conventions.md`.

## What this rule does NOT require

- It does **not** require updating the docs unless the architecture / feature / conventions are themselves changing.
- It is **not** a substitute for the Plan / Todo discipline in CLAUDE.md.
- It does **not** mean "read every doc" — only the ones that cover your edit area.

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval** in chat.
