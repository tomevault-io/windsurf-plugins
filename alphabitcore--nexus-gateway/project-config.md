# Code / Doc Lockstep (BINDING)

> Docs are **the single source of truth**. If code drifts from a doc, the **code is wrong** — fix the doc to match reality if needed, but never ship code that contradicts its doc.

## The rule

When a PR touches code in a region covered by a doc, every matching doc MUST be updated in the **same commit**. The doc isn't a follow-up; it's part of the change. This applies to **every** doc tree:

| Doc tree | What changes here trigger an update |
|---|---|
| `docs/developers/architecture/**` | internal mechanics, data flow, contracts between services |
| `docs/users/features/**` | user-visible UI surface, admin features, agent UX |
| `docs/users/api/openapi/**` | request/response schemas, new/renamed/removed endpoints |
| `docs/operators/ops/runbooks/**` | deployment steps, recompute scripts, operational procedures |
| `docs/developers/specs/**` | Epic / Story acceptance criteria as scope evolves |

A single code change typically touches **multiple doc trees**. Examples:

- New admin endpoint → OpenAPI spec + architecture doc + feature doc (if UI surface) + runbook (if ops procedure).
- Cost-stamping change → `cost-estimation-architecture.md` + `prod-deploy-data-changes.md` (if historical recompute) + feature doc for the Traffic drawer (if visible breakdown changes).
- Provider adapter codec change → `provider-adapter-architecture.md` + feature doc if visible to admins.
- Schema migration → `cost-estimation-architecture.md` (if cost columns) OR `thing-config-sync-architecture.md` (if shadow) + runbook if any historical data fix is part of the PR.

## How it's enforced

`scripts/check-doc-lockstep.mjs` runs on the PR diff against `origin/main`. If any code file matches a configured glob and **none** of the mapped docs are in the diff, the check fails with the file list + which docs were expected.

The mapping lives at `scripts/doc-lockstep.config.mjs`. Each entry is one or more code globs plus one or more required docs. Adding a new entry is easy — edit the config and open the PR.

Run locally:

```bash
npm run check:doc-lockstep            # vs origin/main (CI mode)
node scripts/check-doc-lockstep.mjs --staged   # only against staged files
```

## What is NOT a substitute

- A passing `tsc -b` / `go build` / unit tests do **not** mean docs are aligned. Code can compile and the doc can still claim something the code no longer does.
- Touching `updated:` in the front-matter without changing the body is a **red flag in review** — the doc should reflect what the code now does, not just a fresh date.
- Adding a `TODO: update doc` comment in code is **explicitly forbidden** under the "real implementation only" rule. Update the doc now, or carve out the change.

## Waiver

Skipping the lockstep requires explicit user approval recorded in the PR description or commit message. Acceptable waivers:

- Trivial mechanical change (a typo fix, a comment-only commit, a dependency bump that doesn't change behavior).
- Cherry-pick / revert where the original commit already covered the docs.
- Migration timestamp rename where the migration is functionally unchanged.

Not acceptable:

- "Will update doc in follow-up PR." Doc PRs that ship after the code is the bug this rule prevents.
- "It's only a small refactor." If small refactors drift the doc, the doc says one thing and the code does another by inches.
