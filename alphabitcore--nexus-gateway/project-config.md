# Migration timestamp uniqueness (binding)

You are touching Prisma migrations. **Two folders sharing the same `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` prefix make Prisma silently skip one** — every migration folder name MUST start with a unique prefix.

## The rule

Every migration folder name starts with a unique `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` prefix.

```bash
ls tools/db-migrate/prisma/migrations/ | cut -c1-14 | sort | uniq -d
# must be empty
```

This check is wired as `npm run check:migration-timestamps` and runs in CI. Pre-commit hook installation is encouraged.

## How to add a new migration safely

```bash
cd tools/db-migrate
npx prisma migrate dev --name <descriptive_snake_case>
# Prisma auto-generates a unique timestamp; usually safe.

# If you crafted the folder by hand or copy-pasted, check:
npm run check:migration-timestamps
```

## If you hit a duplicate

Rename one of the conflicting folders with a +1 second / +1 minute suffix and rebase any references (rare; usually only manual scripts or fixtures reference migration names).

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval** in chat.
