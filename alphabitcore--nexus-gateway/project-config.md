# AI Gateway / traffic_event smoke (binding)

You are editing AI-Gateway-adjacent code or the `traffic_event` schema. **You MUST run the ai-gateway smoke before reporting the work as done.** Unit tests cannot catch the failure modes this smoke is built for: cross-ingress asymmetry (one ingress passes, another silently drops a field), cost / token miscalculation on `traffic_event`, cache classification bugs, and codec parity regressions between native passthrough and the canonical bridge.

## The rule

Any edit that touches:

- `packages/ai-gateway/**` (ingress handlers, providers/specs/<name>/, cache, cost, routing, hooks),
- the `TrafficEvent` / `TrafficEventNormalized` tables or any `traffic_event_*` migration in `tools/db-migrate/`,
- `packages/shared/transport/normalize/**` (canonical normalizer + extractors),
- `packages/ai-gateway/internal/execution/canonicalbridge/` (canonical chat-completions bridge) / `packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/canonicalext/` (provider-ext fields),
- `packages/shared/traffic/**` (adapters, normalize pipeline, dedup, store),
- or any provider adapter under `packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/specs/<name>/`,

MUST run an ai-gateway smoke before the completion-time self-audit (Q3) can be answered "yes".

## Scope of the smoke run

Pick one based on the blast radius — and **call out which you ran in the completion message**:

| Scope | Command | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Full surface** | `python3 tests/scripts/smoke-gateway.py --all-ingress` | 29 catalog models × 4 ingresses (chat / responses / messages / gemini). Use for shared-code, schema, cost, normalize, canonical-bridge, multi-adapter edits. |
| **Partial models** | `--models <a,b,c> --all-ingress` | Edits provably scoped to ≤3 model families. Pick one model per affected provider. |
| **Single ingress** | `--ingress chat` (or `responses`/`messages`/`gemini`) | Edits to one ingress's codec only. Document why the other three are unaffected. |
| **Single model + skip cache** | `--models X --no-cache` | Targeted regression rerun while iterating on a stream-parser bug. NOT acceptable as the final smoke before "done". |

Skipping the smoke entirely requires **explicit user approval** in chat.

## What to inspect in the report

The smoke writes a Markdown report at `/tmp/smoke-gateway-<UTC>.md`. Before declaring done:

1. **No FAIL rows** in any phase. WARNs require an in-message explanation.
2. **Cross-ingress cache matrix** — every model's cache column is consistent (A passes ⇒ B passes for cacheable models).
3. **Reasoning audit** (smoke v2) — for reasoning-capable models, `reasoning_tokens` is non-zero on at least one arm (Anthropic native exempted; messages-ingress doesn't expose the count).
4. **traffic_event cross-check** — `gateway_cost_usd`, token counts, cache classification visible in the DB-cross-check phase line up with the response body. The DB row is the source of truth that production analytics depends on.

## What this rule catches that unit tests don't

- **Cross-ingress asymmetry** — one ingress carries a field correctly, another silently drops it on egress (most often a normalizer mapping omission between OpenAI-shape and a non-OpenAI shape). Only the cross-ingress matrix surfaces these.
- **Token-field stamp coverage** — the 5-stamp-site sweep (`token-field-stamp-sweep.mdc`) is verifiable end-to-end only via the smoke; a unit test in one site doesn't tell you the other four populated the new column.
- **Cost correctness** on `traffic_event.gateway_cost_usd` — input/output/cached-read/cached-write/reasoning tokens must line up; the gateway computes this from many inputs and the only end-to-end probe is the smoke + DB cross-check.

## Related bindings

- `unit-test-coverage-95.mdc` — unit tests are necessary but not sufficient. The smoke is the integration layer.
- `token-field-stamp-sweep.mdc` — when adding a usage field, the smoke is the only way to verify all 5 stamp sites populated the new column.
- `text-first-normalizer.mdc` — text-first normalizer changes require running the normalize pipeline end-to-end, which the smoke exercises.
- Memory `[[feedback_cache_mandatory_all_ingress]]` — cache test runs on every ingress; cross-ingress asymmetry must be caught.
