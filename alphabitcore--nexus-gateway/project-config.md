description: macOS Network Extension must fail-open (5 safety-critical rules)

# macOS NE proxy must fail-open (binding, safety-critical)

You are editing `NETransparentProxyProvider` territory. **This code is in the host's outbound packet path.** Any hang / panic / silently-claimed-but-not-relayed flow takes down the entire Mac's network — DNS, DHCP, mDNS, NTP, Apple Push, VPNs. Recovery requires `launchctl unload` + plist delete.

**Read `docs/developers/architecture/services/agent/agent-ne-fail-open-architecture.md` BEFORE editing.**

## The 5 binding fail-open rules

1. **`handleNewFlow` decides synchronously.** Only `return true` for flows we can fully relay. UDP without a relay implementation = `return false` for unknown bundles. Apply protocol / bundle-ID checks BEFORE claiming.
2. **Every async callback into the daemon has a fail-open timeout.** `requestDecision` → passthrough after 2s. `peekSNIThenRelay` → plain relay after 500ms. Never let a flow hang on an absent daemon.
3. **No hardcoded enforcement lists in NE Swift code.** Bundle-ID allowlists etc. live in the Hub-pushed `agent_settings` shadow → daemon writes to `/var/run/nexus-agent/quic-bundles.json` → NE reads file-only with empty-as-fail-safe.
4. **`isLikelyXyz = true` patterns are banned.** Either write the real condition or `return false`. Don't flip a TODO and ship.
5. **System DNS / DHCP / Push services MUST NEVER have UDP closed.** `mdnsresponder`, `configd`, `dhcpcd`, `apsd`, `nsurlsessiond`, `kdc`, `ntpd` — validate every kill-list addition.

## Test invariants before merging

- Boot on a fresh macOS; verify Wi-Fi browsing works (DNS / DHCP / HTTPS).
- Disable the Hub; verify network still works.
- Send malformed flows (random UDP, unknown TCP); verify nothing hangs.
- Watch QUIC handshake handling; never both pass-through and capture.
- Run 24h on a dev machine; no "did I lose internet?" question.

## Build & sign

Use **`.claude/skills/build-agent`** (binding). Never run `wails build` / `codesign` / `xcrun notarytool` manually.

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval** in chat.
