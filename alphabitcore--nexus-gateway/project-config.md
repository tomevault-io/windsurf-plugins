# Secrets are env-only — never YAML (binding)

No secret field may appear in any YAML committed to the repo. Secrets ride **env variables**, documented in `.env.example` at repo root, read at runtime via `os.Getenv` / `bootenv`.

## Forbidden in committed YAML

- Auth tokens.
- HMAC keys.
- Credential-encryption keys / passphrases / salts.
- Internal-service tokens.
- DB passwords.
- Any field named `secret` / `password` / `token` / `key` carrying a real value.

## Allowed in committed YAML

- Service shape (ports, timeouts, feature flags, log levels, allowlists).
- Non-secret tunings.
- Empty/placeholder fields that get overridden by env at boot — but every such field has a corresponding env var in `.env.example`.

## Cross-service shared secrets

When two services share a secret (e.g., inter-service HMAC), tag both env-var lines in `.env.example` with `[MUST MATCH]`. Drift between consumers is the most common source of inter-service 403s.

## Adding a new secret YAML field

Forbidden by default. Requires **explicit user approval** in chat with a stated reason (real reason — "it's easier" is not valid).

## Operational detail

- Local: repo-root `.env` loaded via `bootenv`.
- Prod: systemd `EnvironmentFile=` or K8s Secret.
- Full operational rules: `docs/developers/workflow/local-dev-debugging.md` "Environment variables" — that section carries the same binding force as this file.

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval** in chat.
