description: All repository artifacts (docs, comments, UI strings, commits) are English

# English only — repository (binding)

All **project artifacts** in this repo must be **English**:

- `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/*`.
- `docs/**` (requirements, SDD, architecture, OpenAPI descriptions and examples).
- Source **comments**.
- **User-visible UI copy** (also requires i18n — see `i18n-mandatory.mdc`).
- **Commit messages**.
- READMEs, config / doc strings you add or edit.

## Forbidden

Adding Chinese or other natural languages to those artifacts.

## Allowed

- **Conversation language in chat** may follow the user — say what you want in chat. **Anything written into the codebase stays English.**
- **Legal quotes / verbatim user content** that must be preserved in another language — requires **explicit user approval**.

## Enforcement

- `npm run check:terminology` — terminology guard on product surfaces (CI gate).
- Code review — reviewer rejects non-English content.

## What this protects

- Globally distributable codebase.
- Tool / search / lint compatibility (most tools assume English identifiers).
- Predictable diff readability for international contributors.

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval** in chat (e.g., "we need to embed a Chinese legal quote here").
