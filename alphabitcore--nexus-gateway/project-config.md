# Configuration changes — 4-layer model (binding)

Any PR that adds / removes / renames a YAML field, env variable, `thing_config_template` configKey, `system_metadata` key, or publisher/receiver wiring MUST conform to the 4-layer model + R1–R5 invariants in `docs/developers/architecture/cross-cutting/foundation/configuration-architecture.md`.

**Read that doc BEFORE editing.**

## What you MUST do

### Adding a new configKey

1. Add the constant to `packages/shared/schemas/configkey/` (constants + `ValidByThingType` + `TypedRegistry`) in the **same PR**.
2. Update the `configuration-architecture.md` §7 per-key catalog row in the **same PR**.
3. Wire the publisher / receiver path per the 4-layer model (see §4 of the doc).

### Renaming a YAML field / env var / configKey

1. Run `scripts/check-rename.sh OLD NEW` as the sweep gate — it covers all 14 layers listed in §6.5 of the architecture doc.
2. Verify the negative grep returns zero: `git grep -E '\bOLD\b'` must be empty before shipping.
3. Update `.env.example` and the per-key catalog in the same PR.

### Removing a configKey

Hard-delete it (pre-GA policy — see `no-backward-compatibility.mdc`). No `@deprecated`, no parallel paths.

## What you MUST NOT do

- Add a configKey only to the registry and forget the catalog — admins won't see it, runtime won't recognise it.
- Add a configKey to the catalog only — runtime validation will reject it.
- Add a field to one of `seed.ts` / `thing_config_template` / `configreconcile` but not the others — invariants drift silently.

## Source of truth

`docs/developers/architecture/cross-cutting/foundation/configuration-architecture.md` (4-layer model + R1–R5 invariants + §6.5 14-layer rename checklist + §7 per-key catalog).

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval** in chat.
