# Agent UI terminology (binding)

The Agent UI surfaces what's happening on **this device** to an **end-user**, not to a platform admin. Its vocabulary differs from the Control Plane UI on purpose.

## Required terminology

- **"Traffic event"** — every intercepted request. NEVER "AI call", "LLM call", "prompt", or "completion" as the primary noun. (Inside an event detail panel, "prompt" / "completion" labels for body content are fine — but the row itself is a "traffic event".)
- **"Allowed / Flagged / Blocked"** — outcome verbs map directly to canonical hook decisions.
- **"Protection Pause"** — user-side temporary intercept pause. Never "disable agent" (the agent is still running).
- **"Connection"** — Hub link status. Never "platform connection" or "control-plane connection" (too admin-y).

## Forbidden terminology in Agent UI

| Don't use | Use instead | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "AI call" / "LLM call" | "Traffic event" / "Request" | Agent is provider-agnostic at this surface |
| "Quota" / "Limit" / "Budget" | (don't surface; not a concept) | Quota is server-side; the agent never tracks or displays it |
| "API key" | "Credential" or omit | API keys live admin-side; on-device user shouldn't reason about them |
| "Tenant" / "Org" | omit unless contextually needed | Admin language; on-device user belongs to their org implicitly |
| "Disable agent" | "Pause protection" | Pause keeps the agent running, just stops intercepting |
| "Inspection" | "Compliance check" / "Hook" | Match admin-side surface naming |

## i18n keys

All these terms ride through the i18n pipeline (cross-ref `i18n-mandatory.mdc`). When you add a key under `packages/ui-shared/src/i18n/locales/{en,zh,es}/dashboard.json` or the agent-side equivalent, use the required vocabulary.

## Enforcement

CI script `npm run check:agent-ui-terminology` greps the agent UI source + locale files for forbidden tokens. New violations fail CI in strict mode.

## Source

- Decision record: memory [[project_agent_ui_ia_redesign]].
- Feature docs: `docs/users/features/agent-ui/overview.md` §IA + per-page docs.

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval** in chat.
