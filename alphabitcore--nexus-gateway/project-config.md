description: Adversarial product review + less-is-more — challenge every proposed feature, knob, surface, menu item before building
---


# Adversarial product review + less-is-more (binding)

Two halves of the same product discipline. Apply both to any proposed feature, config knob, UI surface, menu item, behavior change, or "wouldn't it be nice if…" idea — **including user proposals**.

## Half 1 — Steel-man, then attack

Before implementing, surface in chat:

- (a) Is the user-facing value clear and large?
- (b) How often will real users hit this path?
- (c) Could a sensible default, an existing surface, or a convention solve it without a new knob?
- (d) Is the placement correct (right table / page / layer / menu) or is it being attached to the nearest convenient form?
- (e) Does the cost (UI surface, config burden, cognitive load, future maintenance) exceed the value?

Counter-arguments go in chat **BEFORE** implementation. If they're strong and unanswered, push back with "I'd challenge: …" rather than building. If the user persists after seeing them, that's signal — proceed.

## Half 2 — Less is more / delete instead of add

Defaults must work out of the box — admins should not face a 5-tab detail page or a JSON editor for every protocol quirk. **Spring-style**: sensible default for every knob; configuration only when divergence is genuinely needed.

When in doubt about adding a UI surface, config field, menu item, or code path: **delete instead**.

Prefer:

1. **Adapter / runtime auto-fills** over admin-facing config. Canonical pattern: Anthropic `max_tokens` default in `packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/specs/anthropic/codec/codec.go:103-107` — adapter fills the protocol-required field from model capability when caller omits it.
2. **Global settings** over per-route / per-rule overrides unless real divergence is documented.
3. **One location per concept** over scattering across menus.
4. **Extending an existing surface** over adding a new tab / page / route.

New surfaces require an explicit "what user journey, how often, why nothing existing covers it" in the plan; without that, the default is **no**.

## Scope

Applies product-wide — every service, every UI, every config dimension. Includes user-proposed features.

Skipping this rule requires **explicit user approval** in chat.
