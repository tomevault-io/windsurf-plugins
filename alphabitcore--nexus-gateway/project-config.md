# NRN builder is canonical (binding)

`iamMW(action)` builds the request NRN as `nrn := iam.BuildRequestNRNForAction(action, c)`. The builder owns the action → resourceType derivation. **Never hardcode the resourceType string** in handler glue — hardcoded strings drift from the IAM catalog and produce silent 403s.

Memory anchor: [[project_iam_resource_nrn_bug]].

## Required

```go
e.GET("/api/admin/providers/:id", h.GetProvider, iamMW("admin:provider.read"))
// inside iamMW:
nrn := iam.BuildRequestNRNForAction(action, c)   // <- canonical builder
```

## Forbidden

```go
// ❌ hardcoded resource-type
nrn := fmt.Sprintf("nrn:nexus:provider:%s:%s", orgID, id)

// ❌ ad-hoc string concat
nrn := "nrn:nexus:" + getResourceType(action) + ":" + scope + ":*"
```

Even when the hardcoded version "looks right", it skips the catalog lookup in `packages/shared/identity/iam/catalog_data.go`. When the catalog updates (new resource, renamed verb), the canonical builder picks it up; hardcoded strings rot.

## When the action is new

1. Add the action to `packages/shared/identity/iam/catalog_data.go`.
2. Build via `iam.BuildRequestNRNForAction(action, c)`.
3. Verify with the `simulator` IAM page in the dashboard.

## When the action signature changes

`BuildRequestNRNForAction` is the single seam. Update the catalog; every handler that uses the builder picks up the change automatically.
