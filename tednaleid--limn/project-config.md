# CLAUDE.md

Limn -- keyboard-first, offline-capable mind map progressive web app and Obsidian plugin.

For project orientation (stack, build/test commands, architecture, entry points), see [ONBOARDING.md](./ONBOARDING.md).

## Development Methodology

Testing is a first-class citizen. We are using red/green development practices. Everywhere possible, we want to have a failing (red) test first, then make it pass (green).

For this project, you are allowed to commit, and are actually REQUIRED to commit your progress after every significant change. Commits should only happen when tests and linting are green.

## Command rules

- Use `bunx` instead of `npx` for running package binaries (this is a Bun project).
- Save Playwright MCP screenshots to `/tmp`, not the project directory.
- `just serve` already uses `tee` for output redirection. Do not add shell redirect operators (`2>&1 &`) when invoking it.
- NEVER use command substitution when committing, Ted will never approve this, always use a heredoc.

## Architecture invariants

- **Editor is the sole source of truth.** All mutations go through Editor methods. DOM renders from Editor state, never writes to it.
- **Core has zero browser dependencies.** Nothing in `packages/core/` imports React, DOM APIs, or browser globals. Text measurement uses a `TextMeasurer` interface (DI); web provides a DOM-based implementation, tests provide a stub.
- **Diff-based undo.** Store captures diffs automatically. No Command classes.
- **Positions are stored.** Layout engine computes initial positions; users can reposition nodes. File format includes x/y coordinates.
- **A `.limn` file is a ZIP (STORE) containing `data.json` + `assets/`.** Legacy JSON `.limn` files are auto-migrated on next save.
- **TestEditor for logic tests.** Playwright is only for visual regression and browser-API integration. If it can be tested without a browser, it must be.
- **Text editing uses positioned textarea.** Not SVG foreignObject (cross-browser issues). Textarea is absolutely positioned over the canvas with zoom-aware transforms.
- **Multiple roots supported.** A mind map is a forest of trees. Roots can be created and deleted freely. Empty canvas is valid.
- **Key-to-action routing lives in core.** DOM event listeners live in `web/`, but they delegate to a dispatch function in `core/` that maps keys to Editor actions. TestEditor uses the same dispatch, so keyboard behavior is testable without a browser.
- **Undo tracks only document data.** Camera position and selection state are excluded from the diff/undo system. The store distinguishes "document state" (nodes, structure, text) from "session state" (camera, selection).
- **File format changes require Ted's approval.** Any modification to `schema.ts`, serialization behavior, or the file format shape (adding/removing/renaming fields) must be discussed first. Non-breaking additions bump the package minor version. Breaking changes bump the major version and require a migration in `migration.ts`. The golden fixture must be updated to cover any new fields.
