# NextE Agent Guidelines

This file is the repository's single agent entrypoint. Keep it short: hard stops live here, and detailed
rules live in one domain guide each.

## Authority And Scope

- The user's latest explicit request defines the active scope. Plans, archived notes, handoffs, test
  artifacts, and device leases never create work or authorization by themselves.
- After the user's current scope, execution order is: `AGENTS.md` → applicable skills and the relevant
  guide below → relevant memory and current-task artifacts → current source and fresh evidence → active
  task plan and actions. Process discipline is part of correctness; do not act first and backfill
  required reading later. `docs/archive/` and `docs/plans/archive/` are historical evidence only.
- An applicable skill is an execution workflow, not optional background reading. Read it before acting,
  keep its established scenario state across retries, and treat user corrections as deltas unless the
  user rejects that state or changes the goal.
- Agents may choose reversible implementation details that preserve the requested result. A choice that
  changes product meaning, data ownership, remote schema, user-visible hierarchy, or another major
  trade-off must be explained and returned to the user for decision before implementation.
- Do not create a second global rule set. Merge durable rules into the relevant guide and archive task-
  specific evidence when its lane is no longer active.

## Hard Stop: State Management V2 Only

State Management V1 is retired in `entry/`, `feature/`, and `shared/`. Do not introduce or restore
`@Component`, `@State`, `@Prop`, `@Link`, `@Watch`, `@StorageLink`, `@StorageProp`, `@Provide`,
`@Consume`, `@ObjectLink`, `@Observed`, `@Track`, `@LocalStorageLink`, or `@LocalStorageProp`.

Use `@ComponentV2`, `@ObservedV2`, `@Trace`, `@Local`, `@Param`, `@Monitor`, and project state holders.
Do not add a V1 adapter, allowlist, temporary bridge, or key-churn refresh workaround. If a change appears
to require V1, stop and return `BLOCKED` with source/build evidence and a V2-only alternative.

For every ArkTS/UI/state change, run `node scripts/test_v1_decorator_inventory_contract.mjs`; it must
report `0 file(s)` before merge or push.

## Hard Stop: CI Preflight Before Push

Before any push, run `bash scripts/run_ci_preflight.sh`; it must pass every repository gate used by the
current GitHub Actions workflow. After pushing, inspect the Actions run for the exact pushed HEAD and do
not report delivery complete until it succeeds. A local Hvigor build or a subset of gates is not CI proof.

## Hard Stop: Device Selection

Before any device-affecting command, the user or current explicit task must identify the intended device.
A full HDC target or an unambiguous shorthand such as `237`, a device label, or an emulator name is valid.

For shorthand, run `hdc list targets -v` and resolve it only against live `Connected` targets. A numeric
shorthand matches the final IPv4 octet. Continue only when exactly one target matches; otherwise ask.
Never infer a target from old notes, artifacts, another task, or “the only connected device”.

Before installation, launch, input, screenshot/recording, foreground inspection, or other device control,
acquire the lease with the resolved full target: `scripts/device-lease --device <target> ...`. Follow
[Device lease](docs/device-lease.md).

## Required Reading

- Every NextE task: [Always-loaded rules](docs/agent-guides/always-loaded-rules.md).
- ArkTS, ArkUI, NDK, or UI work: [HarmonyOS constraints](docs/agent-guides/harmonyos-default.md).
- Build, signing, worktree, or local-tool work: [Local development](docs/agent-guides/local-development.md).
- Device or emulator work: [Device lease](docs/device-lease.md).
- Repeated HarmonyOS UI actions, diagnostics, logs, or traces: use the
  `harmony-run-device-diagnostics` skill after reading the device guide.
- Product bug or feature work: [Product work](docs/agent-guides/product-work.md).
- Architecture-sensitive work: [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).
- Manga translation, OCR, multimodal context, or translated-image work:
  [Manga translation design](docs/manga-translation-design.md).
- EH protocol, parser, cookie, auth, deep-link, or remote-write work:
  [EH integration contract](docs/eh-integration-contract.md).
- Planning or milestone questions: [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) and [Plan lifecycle](docs/plans/README.md).

## Reference Projects

- `../eros_fe` — EH product behavior and UX reference.
- `../V2Next` — HarmonyOS architecture and native-component reference.
- `../eros_n_ohos` — prior art for Flutter-to-HarmonyOS integration pitfalls.

## Unsure? Don't Guess

For uncertain ArkTS/ArkUI/NDK APIs or DevEco/hdc/hilog behavior, use the `harmony-next` skill or official
Huawei documentation before acting.
