# MANDATORY: READ BEFORE ANY ACTION

## STOP - DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT COMPLETING THESE STEPS

Before responding to ANY user request, you MUST:

1. **READ** all files in `8-Agent-Instructions/` folder using `read_file` tool:
   - `8-Agent-Instructions/base-rule.md`
   - `8-Agent-Instructions/security-general-rule.md`
   - `8-Agent-Instructions/architecture-general.md`
   - `8-Agent-Instructions/code-quality-general-rule.md`
   - `8-Agent-Instructions/testing-general-rule.md`
   - `8-Agent-Instructions/process-general-rule.md`
   - `8-Agent-Instructions/azure-naming-standards.md`

2. **CONFIRM** by stating: `[Rules Loaded: security, architecture, code-quality, testing, process]`

3. **INCLUDE** `[Security Rule: Active]` in your first response

## FAILURE TO COMPLY

If you skip reading these rules:
- You WILL make security violations (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection)
- You WILL break architecture (wrong folder placement, wrong dependencies)
- You WILL leave build warnings (violates zero-warning policy)
- You WILL skip required tests

## WHY THIS EXISTS

Previous agents ignored passive instructions and made costly mistakes. This is not optional.

Only after completing the above steps may you proceed with the user's request.
