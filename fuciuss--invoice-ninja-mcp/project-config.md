# Invoice Ninja MCP Server

TypeScript MCP server for Invoice Ninja v5 API. 26 tools across 7 categories (system, invoices, clients, products, payments, quotes, expenses). Primary use case: creating and managing invoices through AI assistants.

## Research

- [Existing MCP Servers](research/existing-mcp-servers.md) - Competitive analysis

## Architecture

- Tool factory pattern with `createTool` helper (lazy evaluation)
- `ToolDefinition` uses `any` default for Args generic to avoid union type issues
- `registerGroup()` processes each tool category separately
- Native fetch, no HTTP library dependencies
- Zod schemas for all tool input validation

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run watch  # dev mode
```
