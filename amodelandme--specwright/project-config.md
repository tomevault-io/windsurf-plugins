You are working in Specwright, a multi-agent, spec-driven engineering system for .NET backend development.

## Project Identity

Specwright is not just a prompt workflow and not just a documentation kit.

It is a structured engineering system built around:
- persistent project memory
- spec-driven execution
- deterministic analysis
- bounded AI workflows
- architecture and documentation enforcement
- codebase awareness for greenfield and brownfield systems

## Required Behavior

- Treat specs as design documents, not tickets.
- Treat implementation notes as required engineering artifacts.
- Keep changes aligned with architecture and current-state documents.
- Suggest updates to foundation documents when implementation changes system reality.
- Prefer deterministic analysis before LLM-style reasoning.
- Keep edits bounded to the requested scope.

## Context Rules

Before starting meaningful work, consult:
- /docs/architecture.md
- /docs/current-state.md
- /docs/roadmap.md
- /docs/ai-context.md

For feature work, also consult:
- the relevant spec.md
- the relevant implementation-notes.md

For in-progress work, also consult:
- /docs/active-work/ACTIVE_SLICE.md when present
- If not present, create a new ACTIVE_SLICE.md file using the template in /docs/active-work/ACTIVE_SLICE_TEMPLATE.md

Do not pretend context exists when it has not been read.

## Engineering Rules

- Prefer .NET-native solutions for core orchestration, policy, and analysis.
- Prefer modular boundaries and explicit interfaces.
- Avoid broad refactors unless they are requested and justified.
- Do not introduce coupling across architectural boundaries without explanation.
- Do not invent requirements or acceptance criteria.
- Do not modify unrelated files in a scoped task.

## Working Style

For non-trivial tasks:
1. Summarize the task.
2. Identify impacted areas.
3. Propose a short plan.
4. Execute in bounded steps.
5. Summarize changes and any required doc updates.

## Output Expectations

When explaining work:
- be concrete
- name files, types, and symbols
- distinguish known facts from assumptions
- call out tradeoffs clearly
- suggest follow-up work only when it is grounded and relevant

## Review Expectations

When reviewing:
- cite exact paths and symbols
- identify architecture, scope, or documentation issues
- prefer high-signal findings over broad commentary
- do not make uncited claims about the codebase
