# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents (and humans in a hurry) working in this repository.

## What this project is

A Babylon.js + TypeScript + webpack (ES6 / tree-shakable modules) starter template.
It renders one scene at a time into a full-page canvas. There is no framework, no
router and no state management - keep it that way.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/index.ts` | Entry point. Reads `?scene=` / `?engine=`, boots the engine, runs the render loop. Keep it thin. |
| `src/createEngine.ts` | Engine creation (WebGL / WebGPU) and engine-name resolution. |
| `src/createScene.ts` | The `CreateSceneClass` contract and the lazy `getSceneModule()` loader. |
| `src/scenes/index.ts` | **The scene registry** - names, labels, lazy loaders and visual-test opt-ins. |
| `src/developmentControls.ts` | Scene/engine picker; included in development and demo builds, excluded from normal production and tests. |
| `src/scenes/*.ts` | One file per scene. |
| `src/externals/*.ts` | Wrappers around wasm/external libs (Havok, Ammo) exposing a ready-promise. |
| `src/glsl/` | Raw shaders, imported as strings via `ts-shader-loader`. |
| `assets/` | Textures/models bundled through webpack asset modules (inlined below 8 KiB, emitted as files above). |
| `public/` | Static files served as-is (`index.html`, workers). |
| `tests/validation.spec.ts` | Registry-driven Playwright smoke tests plus opt-in screenshots. |
| `webpack.config.js` | The only webpack config. Switches behaviour via `--env production` / `--env test`. |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI, snapshot refresh and optional GitHub Pages deployment. |

## How to add a scene (the only supported way)

1. Create `src/scenes/myScene.ts`:

```ts
import { Scene } from "@babylonjs/core/scene";
import { ArcRotateCamera } from "@babylonjs/core/Cameras/arcRotateCamera";
import { Vector3 } from "@babylonjs/core/Maths/math.vector";
import type { AbstractEngine } from "@babylonjs/core/Engines/abstractEngine";
import type { CreateSceneClass } from "../createScene";

export class MyScene implements CreateSceneClass {
    // Optional: promises awaited before createScene() runs (wasm, external libs)
    // preTasks = [havokModule];

    createScene = async (
        engine: AbstractEngine,
        canvas: HTMLCanvasElement
    ): Promise<Scene> => {
        const scene = new Scene(engine);
        const camera = new ArcRotateCamera("camera", 0, Math.PI / 3, 10, Vector3.Zero(), scene);
        camera.attachControl(canvas, true);
        return scene;
    };
}

export default new MyScene();
```

2. Register it in `src/scenes/index.ts`:

```ts
myScene: {
    title: "My scene",
    load: () => import("./myScene"),
    visualTest: {}, // Omit for scenes that cannot render deterministically.
},
```

3. Open `http://localhost:8080/?scene=myScene`.
4. If `visualTest` is enabled, run
   `npm run test:visuals -- --update-snapshots` and inspect the new baselines.

Do **not** switch scenes by editing imports in `src/createScene.ts` or `src/index.ts` -
the registry plus `?scene=` is the mechanism.

Every registry entry is automatically smoke-tested on WebGL2 and WebGPU. Screenshot coverage
is opt-in because simulations and time-dependent scenes are not deterministic.

## Babylon.js import rules (most common source of bugs)

This template uses the **ES6 / tree-shaken** packages. Import from deep paths, never
from the package root:

```ts
// GOOD
import { Scene } from "@babylonjs/core/scene";
import { CreateSphere } from "@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Builders/sphereBuilder";

// BAD - pulls in the whole engine, breaks tree-shaking
import { Scene } from "@babylonjs/core";
import * as BABYLON from "babylonjs";
```

Some features are registered through **side-effect imports** and will fail silently
(or throw at runtime) if omitted. Add them explicitly, for example:

```ts
import "@babylonjs/core/Materials/standardMaterial";
import "@babylonjs/core/Lights/Shadows/shadowGeneratorSceneComponent";
import "@babylonjs/core/Culling/ray";                      // needed for picking
import "@babylonjs/core/Physics/physicsEngineComponent";   // needed for physics
```

Rule of thumb: if a property exists on the type but is `undefined`/inert at runtime,
a side-effect import is missing.

**Loaders are different.** As of Babylon.js 9, `SceneLoader` plugins are *not* registered
by a side-effect import alone - loading a `.glb` fails with `No plugin or fallback for .glb`
unless the plugin is registered explicitly. Loading glTF needs both halves:

```ts
import "@babylonjs/loaders/glTF/2.0/glTFLoader";   // registers the glTF 2.0 loader
import { RegisterGLTFFileLoader } from "@babylonjs/loaders/glTF/glTFFileLoader";
import { registerBuiltInGLTFExtensions } from "@babylonjs/loaders/glTF/2.0/Extensions/dynamic";

RegisterGLTFFileLoader();          // registers the .gltf/.glb SceneLoader plugin
registerBuiltInGLTFExtensions();   // lazily registers the KHR_* extensions
```

Miss the side-effect import and you get `Unsupported version: 2.0` instead. See
`src/scenes/loadModelAndEnv.ts` for the working reference. `registerBuiltInLoaders()` from
`@babylonjs/loaders/dynamic` registers every format at once - convenient, but prefer
registering just the loader you need.
