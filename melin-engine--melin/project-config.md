> **This file must be kept up to date** as the project evolves — update structure, dependencies, and conventions whenever they change.

## Project

**Melin** — sub-millisecond, production-grade exchange core targeting **10M orders/sec**, built on the **LMAX architecture** (single-threaded business logic, event sourcing, mechanical sympathy). Rust (edition 2024). Handles order matching, account management, risk controls, circuit breakers, fee schedules, authentication, journaling, and replication.

**Commercial product** — Every feature decision should be evaluated through the lens of "does this make the product more appealing to an exchange operator?"

## Conventions

- Follow Rust best practices (idiomatic patterns, clippy clean, formatted with `cargo fmt`).
- Write unit tests for all non-trivial code. Skip only when genuinely unreasonable (e.g., trivial glue code).
- **Correctness is critical** — the matching engine is financial infrastructure. Correctness always comes first.
- **Reasonably optimized from the start** — don't prematurely optimize, but make performance-conscious choices by default: minimize allocations, avoid locks on the hot path, favor cache-friendly data structures. Profile before micro-optimizing.
- **Always `cargo check` before committing** — run `cargo check` with the correct feature flags for all affected crates before committing. For DPDK code, check `melin-server` with `--features dpdk --no-default-features` (and additionally `--features dpdk,skip-order-exec --no-default-features` if the change touches transport-only code), and `melin-bench` with `--features dpdk --no-default-features`.
- **No `.unwrap()` in production code** — use proper error handling, or an `.expect()` if really necessary. `.unwrap()` is fine in tests.
- **No `#[ignore]` on tests** — if a test fails, fix the bug. Never suppress a failing test with `#[ignore]`.
- **No silently ignored results** — do not discard `Result` errors via `let _ =`, `.unwrap_or(...)`, `.unwrap_or_default()`, `.ok()`, or similar swallowing patterns unless there is a clear reason (e.g., best-effort diagnostic writes). Handle errors explicitly. When discarding is genuinely the right call, leave a comment on the line above explaining *why* the error is being dropped.
- **Comment data structure and type choices** — always add a comment justifying why a specific collection, data structure, or numeric type was chosen (e.g., why `BTreeMap` over `HashMap`, why `u64` over `u128`).
- **Log levels** — `error!`: server malfunctions only (bugs, journal I/O failures) — must never fire due to bad client input or client network issues. `warn!`: degraded operation that isn't a bug but needs attention (e.g., CPU pinning failed, resource limits approaching, unexpected-but-handled conditions). `info!`: server lifecycle events (start, stop, recovery). `debug!`: client-caused events (connections, disconnects, malformed messages, write failures).
- **Documentation audience** — files in `docs/` are written for exchange operators and customers, not contributors. Describe behavior, guarantees, and operational impact. Avoid implementation details (struct names, function names, borrow checker workarounds). Use `~~strikethrough~~` sparingly — prefer removing resolved items entirely rather than cluttering docs with changelog-style history. For contributors, use `docs/internal`

### Git
- **No co-authored commits** — do not add `Co-Authored-By` trailers.
- **Conventional Commits** — all commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) spec (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
- **Concise commit messages** — keep the subject line short and the body tight. Lead with what changed and why; skip exhaustive enumerations of every touched line. The diff is already in the commit — the message should add context, not duplicate it.
- **Never commit without explicit request** — do NOT commit unless the user explicitly asks (e.g. "commit", "commit and push"). Completing a task does NOT imply permission to commit. Always wait for the user to request the commit.
- **Never push without explicit confirmation** — always ask for review before pushing. Do not push unless the user confirms.
- **Commit intermediary steps** — for large multi-step tasks, commit each logical step separately rather than batching everything into one giant commit. This keeps history clean and bisectable. Always ask for review after each commit before moving to the next.
- **Always check `Cargo.lock`** — when dependencies change, `Cargo.lock` must be staged and committed alongside `Cargo.toml` changes. The pre-commit hook enforces this.
- **Never skip hooks** — do not use `--no-verify` to bypass the pre-commit hook. If the hook fails (clippy warnings, formatting), fix the issue first. The hook exists to catch problems before they enter history.

## Key Design Constraints

- **~100ns per order budget** — at 10M orders/sec, every allocation, cache miss, and branch misprediction counts
- **Deterministic replay** — given the same input events, output must be identical; this is the foundation of event sourcing and crash recovery
