# Friend Focus

## Project Overview

Friend Focus is a Chrome extension that enhances the user's Facebook experience by filtering their newsfeed to display posts only from their friends. It's built using modern web technologies, including React for the user interface, TypeScript for type safety, and Vite for a fast development and build process. The extension consists of a popup for user interaction, a background service worker for core logic, and content scripts for interacting with Facebook pages.

**Key Technologies:**

- **React:** For building the user interface of the popup.
- **TypeScript:** For static typing and improved code quality.
- **Vite:** As the build tool and development server.
- **@crxjs/vite-plugin:** For seamless Chrome extension development with Vite.
- **Zustand:** For state management in the popup.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the popup and content script overlays; design tokens defined in `src/common/styles/tokens.css`.

**Architecture:**

The extension follows a **modular architecture** with three main modules and a common folder:

### Module Structure

1. **Background Module** (`src/background/`) - Service worker that handles core extension logic, storage operations, and acts as the communication hub
2. **Popup Module** (`src/toolbar_action/popup/`) - React-based UI for user interactions and settings
3. **Content Scripts Module** (`src/content_scripts/`) - Scripts injected into Facebook pages to interact with the DOM
4. **Common Folder** (`src/common/`) - Shared code, types, constants, and contracts used across multiple modules

### Key Principles

- **Shared Code Location:** Any code used by 2+ modules belongs in `src/common/`
- **Module Communication:** Modules communicate via an RPC-style contract pattern (background contract)
  - Background acts as server, popup and content scripts act as clients
  - All communication is type-safe through shared contracts in `src/common/`
- **Storage:** Uses `chrome.storage.local` with type-safe utilities

```

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and pnpm

### Development

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

3.  **Load the extension in Chrome:**
    - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
    - Enable "Developer mode".
    - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory.

### Production Build

1.  **Build the extension:**

    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```

    This will create a production-ready build in the `dist` directory and a zip file in the `release` directory.

## Development Conventions

- **Module Boundaries:** Keep code within its respective module unless it needs to be shared across modules
- **Common Folder:** Place code in `src/common/` when it's used by 2+ modules (types, constants, contracts, utilities)
- **Type Safety:** Use TypeScript for all code; maintain type-safe contracts for inter-module communication
- **State Management:** Zustand for popup state, chrome.storage for persistence
- **Communication Pattern:** RPC-style background contract for all cross-module communication
