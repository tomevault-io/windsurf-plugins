# Mind Distill Factory

A universal factory for distilling famous thinkers' wisdom into structured Codex Skills.

## Project Purpose

This project systematically extracts decision-making frameworks, reasoning patterns, and actionable principles from historical and contemporary figures, producing installable Codex Skills.

**Core philosophy:** Extract executable reasoning algorithms through **first-person immersive perspective** — the AI internalizes a thinker's cognitive framework and responds as if that thinker is directly conversing with the user ("I believe...", "In my experience..."). This is NOT theatrical roleplay, but deep embodiment of their reasoning patterns, expression style, and value orientation. The response must carry the **expressive texture** of each thinker's communication style (sentence patterns, rhetoric, tone) and their **constructive value orientation** (emphasizing self-empowerment and practical action over grievance).

## Key Directories

- `config/` — Taxonomy and defaults
- `templates/` — Skill templates (zh/en) and hand-crafted examples
- `commands/` — The `/distill` orchestrator command
- `agents/` — Subagent definitions for the distillation pipeline
- `scripts/` — Validation and utility scripts (JSON Schema checks, installation)
- `sources/{slug}/raw/` — User-provided source materials (PDF, TXT, MD)
- `sources/{slug}/processed/` — Structured extracts from subagents
- `output/{slug}/` — Generated intermediate artifacts and draft Skills
- `gallery/{slug}/` — Symlinks to finalized Skills (single source of truth in templates/examples/)

## Critical Platform Constraint

**Codex skill discovery requires exactly `SKILL.md`** (case-sensitive) in each skill directory. Files like `SKILL.zh.md`, `SKILL.en.md`, `SKILLzh.md`, or `README.md` are invisible to the skill loader. This means: even though we generate independent bilingual frameworks, the final deliverable MUST be a single `SKILL.md` with both languages inline. See Rule 4 for implementation details.

## Distillation Rules

1. Every principle MUST trace back to a specific source (book, speech, letter, documented statement)
2. Every Skill MUST include a "Known Blind Spots" section with **mitigation advice** — no thinker is infallible
3. Decision frameworks MUST be step-by-step **filter chains** (each step is a yes/no gate), not open-ended questions
4. Bilingual output: each Skill produces separate `frameworks.{zh,en}.json` files with **independent cognitive framings** (NOT translations — they may have different numbers of principles and different framework step orders). However, Codex's skill system only recognizes a single `SKILL.md` per directory — so the final deliverable MUST be one `SKILL.md` containing both languages, structured with a language-detection header (`## English` + `## 中文版`) so the model auto-selects the matching section based on user language. The intermediate `.zh.md` / `.en.md` drafts live in `output/{slug}/` as development artifacts, but the installed file is always `SKILL.md`
5. Each person maps to 1 primary + up to 2 secondary categories from `config/taxonomy.json`
6. Source truthfulness: quotes from web search only are capped at `confidence: medium`. Only user-provided first-hand sources or verified publications can be `confidence: high`
7. Pipeline checkpoints: `python scripts/validate_output.py <stage> <slug>` MUST pass between each Stage

## Anti-Formula Design (v4) — Immersive Perspective + Structural Naturalness

Skills must NOT produce formulaic, checklist-style responses. Key mechanisms:
- **First-Person Immersion**: Respond in the thinker's first-person voice ("I believe...", "my experience shows..."), NOT third-person narration ("Munger said...") or second-person lecturing ("you should..."). The user should feel they are conversing with the thinker, not reading a report about them
- **Expression DNA**: Every Skill includes **8-dimension** voice profile (sentence patterns, rhetoric, tone, certainty, humor, taboos, **paragraph rhythm**, **conversational markers**) with calibration examples. The two new dimensions address output-level structure, not just sentence-level style
- **Structural Naturalness Rules**: 5 mandatory instructions targeting AI-structural uniformity — vary sentence length >30%, make paragraphs uneven (1-6 sentences), break symmetric enumeration, diversify paragraph entry points, allow imperfect transitions. Complements Anti-Formula Rules: anti-formula governs *content arrangement*, structural naturalness governs *output shape*
- **Response Strategy**: Replaces rigid Frame→Diagnose→Prescribe→Caveat with flexible input-type adaptation (practical decision / conceptual confusion / emotional sharing / idea sparring)
- **Anti-Formula Rules**: 5 mandatory instructions embedded in every Skill (no sequential listing, match depth to complexity, use expression DNA, don't number principles, brief caveats)
- **Values & Anti-Patterns**: What the thinker actively pursues AND rejects, plus unresolved internal tensions — prevents one-dimensional advice
