# AGENTS.md — Working Guide for "Artificial Intelligence for Law and Finance"

> **⚠️ Note on File Naming**: This file is named `AGENTS.md` because tools like Codex and Gemini require this exact filename for AI assistant guidance. It contains **contribution workflow and standards**, not content about AI agents (which is the book's subject matter found in `chapters/`).

This file directs human and AI assistants contributing to the textbook. It consolidates workflow, evidence standards, file conventions, and LaTeX/build expectations, drawing on the chapter guides under `chapters/`.

## Scope & Intent
- Applies to the entire repository unless a deeper `AGENTS.md` overrides it.
- Objective: a vendor‑neutral, citable, reproducible textbook spanning law and finance.
- Audience: practitioners (law, risk, compliance, markets), regulators, researchers, graduate students.

## Evidence & Source Hierarchy
Prefer primary, dated, link‑stable sources. For time‑sensitive facts (especially after June 2024), verify before inclusion.
- Law/regulation (by authority order):
  - Statutes, regulations, and official reporters (USC/CFR; state codes; EUR‑Lex; court websites).
  - Judicial opinions and orders from official or recognized reporters.
  - Bar/ethics rules and court administrative policies.
  - Regulator guidance and releases (ABA, AOUSC; UK Judiciary; national/state bars).
- Finance/regulators:
  - US: SEC (EDGAR, rule releases), FRB, OCC, FDIC, CFPB, CFTC/FINRA; Treasury/OFAC.
  - International: BIS, FSB, IOSCO, ESMA/EBA/EIOPA, IMF/World Bank, OECD.
  - Accounting: FASB (ASC), IASB/IFRS; auditing: PCAOB; risk: BCBS.
- Research/industry:
  - Peer‑reviewed venues; arXiv from reputable groups; official vendor docs/pressrooms.
  - Avoid tertiary blogs when primary sources exist.

Capture for each citation: title, authors, venue/body, date, stable URL/DOI, and 1–2 line relevance note.

## Writing Rules (musts)
- Follow [`docs/style-guide.md`](docs/style-guide.md) for tone, person/voice, cross‑references (use `\Cref{}`), and terminology.
- Use BibLaTeX with `biber`; include full metadata and `urldate` for web sources.
- Treat rates, thresholds, rules, and release notes as volatile. State effective dates explicitly.
- Paraphrase with citations; use quotes sparingly and only when necessary.
- No client‑confidential, privileged, or regulated (MNPI/inside) data. Redact any accidental inclusion immediately.

## File & Naming Conventions
- Chapters: `chapters/<slug>/` with `main.tex`, `sections/*.tex`, `bib/refs.bib`, `figures/`, `Makefile`.
- Labels: `sec:<slug>-<topic>`, `fig:<slug>-<name>`, `tab:<slug>-<name>`.
- Figures: vector first (PDF/SVG). Names: `fig-<slug>-<name>.pdf`.
- Generated assets: write to `assets/figures/` or `assets/tables/` (planned) with deterministic names.
- Notebooks: place in `notebooks/` and render outputs during builds; do not commit large binary outputs.

## LaTeX & Build Expectations
- **Dual-compilation system**: Individual chapters compile standalone AND integrate into complete book
- **See [docs/build-guide.md](docs/build-guide.md)** for comprehensive build system documentation
- Default toolchain: `latexmk` + `biber`; uses `subfiles` package for dual compilation
- Shared preamble: `preamble.tex` contains all formatting, colors, packages (4-layer semantic color system)
- Build targets:
  - `make book` (or `make pdf`) — Complete book PDF with all chapters
  - `make chapters` — All individual chapter PDFs
  - `make all-pdfs` — Build everything (chapters + book)
  - From chapter dir: `cd chapters/name && make pdf` — Standalone chapter
- Cross‑refs: always "Section~`\ref{}`" or `\Cref{}`; never "see above"
- Before opening a PR: run `make validate`; fix undefined references and citation warnings

## Legal and Financial Citation Guidance
- Default style: BibLaTeX `authoryear` for academic/industry works.
- Legal sources: include Bluebook elements in BibLaTeX fields (`shorttitle`, `note`, `institution`, `jurisdiction`, `date`, `howpublished`). Prefer footnotes where Bluebook clarity matters. A book appendix will document our field mapping.
- Finance/regulatory: cite the issuing authority, document type (rule/proposal/FAQ), release number, and effective/measurement dates. Provide exhibit/page when applicable.

## AI‑Assisted Workflows (you are reading this as an AI too)
- Verify time‑sensitive facts via search before asserting them. Prefer official domains.
- When summarizing, preserve hedges/limitations from sources. Highlight uncertainties.
- For code/data claims, add minimal runnable artifacts (script or notebook) or clearly mark as conceptual.
- Keep drafts LaTeX‑ready; write section stubs with labels and TODOs rather than leaving placeholders in prose.
- Use `scripts/tex_*.py` tools to analyze prose quality (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for usage).
- Use `scripts/check_margins.py` to detect content bleeding into PDF margins (overfull hboxes, oversized images).
