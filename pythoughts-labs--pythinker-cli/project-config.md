description: Never add Co-authored-by or other AI/tool trailers to git commits or PRs

# No co-author or AI trailers on commits

**Never** add `Co-authored-by`, `Signed-off-by` for an AI tool, or any Cursor/Claude/Copilot
footer to commit messages or PR descriptions.

This matches `AGENTS.md`: commits use Conventional Commits subject (+ optional body) only.

## When creating commits

- Pass the message via HEREDoc or `-m` with **only** the intended subject/body.
- Do **not** append `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` or similar.
- If a hook or tool adds a co-author trailer, **amend it out** before pushing (only when amend rules allow).

## Examples

```text
feat(soul): emit TodoListUpdated wire event
```

Not:

```text
feat(soul): emit TodoListUpdated wire event

Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>
```
