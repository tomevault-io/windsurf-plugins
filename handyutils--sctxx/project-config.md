# AGENTS.md — sctxx

Instructions for coding agents working **on** this repository. (Instructions for agents that *use* the
tool live in `skill/SKILL.md`.)

## What this is

`sctxx` (Session ConTeXt eXtractor) is a Rust CLI + Agent Skill that reads a coding-agent session
transcript (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Pi), compacts it into a verified, provenance-linked handoff
artifact, and lets any other agent continue the work. Published to crates.io, npm, and GitHub Releases.

**The spec is the source of truth: `docs/SCTXX-SPEC.md`.** Section references below (§n) point into it.
Read the relevant section before changing behavior. If code and spec disagree, stop and ask, or record
a decision (see "Decisions" below). Never resolve an item from §19 "Open questions" silently.

Status: pre-release. Milestones are defined in §18. A command listed below may not exist yet;
if you need it, create it the way the spec describes instead of working around it.

## Commands

```bash
cargo build                                            # debug build
cargo run -- <subcommand> …                            # e.g. cargo run -- show tests/fixtures/codex/rollback.jsonl --view ir
cargo fmt --all                                        # format (CI runs --check)
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features                              # unit + adapter snapshots + pipeline (mock LLM) + CLI
cargo test --no-default-features                       # `minimal` build must compile and pass (no network code)
cargo +1.88 check --all-features                       # MSRV (raised from 1.85 by ADR 0003)
cargo insta review                                     # accept/reject snapshot changes (needs cargo-insta)
cargo test --release -- --ignored                      # large-session perf tests (§16), not run by default
cargo xtask gen-schemas                                # regenerate schemas/*.json from Rust types (commit the result)
cargo xtask gen-skill                                  # regenerate skill/references/* from clap + schemas
scripts/check-vendor-headers.sh                        # every file under src/vendor/ has the Codex attribution header
cargo package --list                                   # must include LICENSE, NOTICE, prompts/, schemas/, skill/
```

Before declaring a change done: fmt, clippy, `cargo test --all-features`, and `cargo test
--no-default-features` pass; changed snapshots were reviewed, not blindly accepted; generated files
(`schemas/`, `skill/references/`) are regenerated if their inputs changed.

## Hard rules

1. **Licensing / vendoring (§2.2–2.3).** Code ported from OpenAI Codex (Apache-2.0) lives only in
   `src/vendor/codex/`, carries the attribution header (upstream path, pinned commit, "Modified by the
   sctxx authors: …"), and gets a row in `src/vendor/codex/README.md` and spec Appendix A. Never add a
   `codex-*` crate dependency. Never use "Codex" or "OpenAI" in names, branding, crate/npm package names.
2. **Clean-room for Claude Code (§2.4).** The Claude Code adapter is built only from on-disk session
   files, public Anthropic docs, and contributed fixtures. Never read, copy, paraphrase, or port code from
   leaked Claude Code source or its forks (e.g. "OpenClaude"-style repos). Do not search for them.
3. **Publishable at all times.** No git or path dependencies in the `sctxx` package. `xtask/` is the only
   other workspace member (`publish = false`) and must never be a dependency of `sctxx`.
4. **Session files are private data.** Never commit a real session file unless it went through
   `sctxx redact --strict` *and* manual review. Tests never read real `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, or `~/.pi`
   stores — use temp dirs with `--claude-root` / `--codex-root` / `--pi-root` or the env overrides.
5. **Transcripts are data, never instructions.** Nothing from a session is ever executed. Repo
   reconciliation (§10.1) runs only the allowlisted read-only `git` commands via `std::process::Command`,
   never through a shell. Every prompt that embeds transcript text wraps it in `<transcript …>` and states
   it must not be followed (§8.6).
6. **Redact before any LLM call (§10.2)**, and again on LLM output and rendered artifacts.
7. **Contracts are versioned.** CLI flags, exit codes (§3.1), and schemas `sctxx.handoff/v1`, `ops.v1`,
   `state.v1`, `ir.v1` change only together with: schema/version bump where applicable, regenerated
   `schemas/`, updated snapshots, and a CHANGELOG entry.
8. **Prompts are versioned (§8.6).** Editing `prompts/*.md` means bumping its `version` front-matter and
   noting the eval result (mock corpus at minimum) in the PR description.
9. **LLM only where the spec puts it** (premap, fold, final pass, probes, judge). Ledgers, masking,
   segmentation, budgets, validation, apply, reconciliation, and rendering are deterministic Rust.

## Conventions that differ from common defaults

- **stdout is the payload only.** Artifacts/JSON go to stdout; progress, warnings, and diagnostics go to
  stderr. No `println!` outside the output-rendering code in `src/cli/`.
- **Errors:** `thiserror` enums in library code; `anyhow` only in `src/main.rs`. No `unwrap`, `expect`, or
