# Sunday

Use `sunday-development-task` for managed development work.
Use `write-and-publish-stories` when the user asks Sunday to create a Friday task.
Infer the project from the current Git repository.
Invoke Sunday commands internally. Never tell the user to copy them.
Run `sunday run <friday-item>` instead of reproducing phases manually.
Use `sunday review <branch-or-pr>` for independent review.
Use `sunday status <run-id>` for progress.
Use `sunday resume <run-id>` only after resolving its blocker.
Never invent route transitions or Friday changes.
Never use a fixed Friday user ID.
Sunday owns model routing, idempotency, Git delivery, and audit evidence.
