For bug fixes and regression-sensitive work, use tests to reproduce, protect, and verify behavior whenever practical.

## Core rule

Do not just patch the symptom. First understand the failing behavior, then protect against its return.

## Preferred workflow for bug fixes

1. identify the failing behavior clearly
2. locate or create the most targeted test that captures it
3. confirm the failure when feasible
4. implement the fix
5. re-run the test
6. run adjacent relevant checks to guard against regressions

## Testing principles

- prefer targeted tests over broad blind runs at first
- add regression coverage for real bugs when practical
- test the root behavior, not just incidental implementation details
- include edge cases if they are directly related to the failure
- keep tests readable and aligned with project conventions

## When adding a new test

Prefer tests that:

- fail before the fix
- pass after the fix
- clearly describe the intended behavior
- are narrow enough to diagnose future regressions quickly

## If a test cannot be added immediately

Then still:

- document the failure mode clearly in your reasoning
- validate the fix using the strongest available check
- add a test if the codebase supports it and the scope allows it

## Regression mindset

After fixing a bug, also consider:

- nearby code paths using the same logic
- boundary conditions
- serialization or interface effects
- consumer-facing side effects
- whether similar bugs could exist in sibling flows

## Completion rule

A bug fix is stronger when it leaves behind proof that the bug will be caught if it returns.
