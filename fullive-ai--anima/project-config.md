Protect the existing architecture unless the task explicitly requires architectural change.

## Core principles

- Prefer local, minimal, boundary-respecting changes.
- Fit new work into existing module boundaries whenever possible.
- Do not introduce new layers, abstractions, or patterns unless clearly justified.
- Do not widen the change surface unnecessarily.
- Do not use a bug fix or small feature as an excuse for broad redesign.

## Before changing code

First identify:

- the owning module or subsystem
- its direct dependencies
- the inbound callers or consumers
- the outward contracts it exposes
- whether the change belongs here or elsewhere

## Guardrails

- Keep responsibilities separated.
- Respect dependency direction.
- Do not move logic across layers without a strong reason.
- Avoid creating duplicate sources of truth.
- Prefer extending an existing abstraction over inventing a parallel one.
- Prefer explicit data flow over hidden coupling.
- Keep cross-module changes small and intentional.

## Prohibited behavior unless clearly necessary

- broad refactors unrelated to the task
- introducing framework-level patterns for small local problems
- changing multiple subsystems to support a narrow fix when a local fix is possible
- creating generic helpers too early
- mixing transport, domain, UI, persistence, and integration logic in the same place

## If architectural change is genuinely required

Then:

1. State why the existing structure blocks the task.
2. Keep the change as small as possible.
3. Preserve backward compatibility where feasible.
4. Update tests and docs affected by the architectural shift.
5. Avoid combining architectural cleanup with unrelated feature work.
