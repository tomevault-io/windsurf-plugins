Every meaningful change should be validated as strongly as the repo allows.

## Required behavior

After making changes, run the most relevant available checks, such as:

- targeted tests
- affected test suites
- lint
- type-check
- build
- static analysis
- framework-specific validation commands

Do not skip validation just because the code looks correct.

## Validation strategy

Prefer this order:

1. run the most targeted checks first
2. fix failures
3. run broader relevant checks as needed
4. confirm the task outcome
5. watch for regressions in adjacent behavior

## Bug fix rule

For bug fixes:

- verify the original failure mode is addressed
- add or update a regression test when feasible
- confirm related behavior still works

## Feature rule

For features:

- validate the happy path
- validate obvious edge states
- ensure the feature is actually wired into the real flow
- confirm types, imports, and integration points are correct

## Failure handling

If a validation step fails:

1. diagnose the failure
2. determine whether it is caused by your change
3. fix it if in scope or required for correctness
4. re-run validation
5. continue until passing or truly blocked

## Minimum expectation

Never treat "edited code successfully" as equivalent to "task completed successfully."

## Reporting

When summarizing work, include:

- what was validated
- what passed
- what could not be validated
- any remaining caveats
