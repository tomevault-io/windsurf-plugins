Treat shared interfaces, schemas, contracts, and dependency relationships as high-sensitivity areas.

## Core rule

Before changing an interface, find who depends on it.

## Interfaces include

- public functions
- exported types
- module contracts
- API request and response shapes
- event payloads
- message formats
- topic names
- config structures
- CLI arguments
- database-facing schemas
- file formats

## Required behavior before changing an interface

Identify:

- producers
- consumers
- callers
- downstream dependents
- test coverage around the contract
- whether the change is backward compatible

## Preferred approach

- preserve backward compatibility by default
- prefer additive changes over breaking changes
- update all affected callers when a contract must change
- keep dependency relationships clear and stable
- avoid hidden contract drift

## Breaking changes

Only make a breaking change when clearly necessary.

If required:

1. minimize the blast radius
2. update all affected code paths
3. update tests
4. update docs
5. call out the compatibility impact explicitly in your summary

## Dependency safety

- do not create circular dependencies
- do not introduce a new dependency for a trivial local need
- prefer existing project patterns and libraries
- avoid tight coupling between unrelated modules
- keep abstractions honest and narrow

## Avoid

- changing one side of an interface without updating the other side
- silently altering payload meanings
- reusing a contract for a different semantic purpose
- weakening types or schemas just to make code compile
