When code changes affect usage, setup, behavior, operations, or developer workflow, update the relevant documentation.

## Update docs when changes affect

- setup or installation
- configuration or environment variables
- API behavior
- command usage
- UI flows
- operational procedures
- architecture boundaries
- message formats
- testing or development workflow
- deployment expectations

## Documentation targets may include

- README files
- module-level docs
- runbooks
- architecture notes
- inline examples
- `.env.example`
- setup instructions
- developer guides
- troubleshooting notes

## Core rule

Do not leave docs stale when the code changed in a user-visible, developer-visible, or operator-visible way.

## Required behavior

- update the nearest relevant documentation
- prefer small precise documentation edits over broad rewrites
- keep examples consistent with current behavior
- remove or adjust outdated instructions caused by the change
- mention new requirements and changed assumptions

## If docs are not updated

Be sure the omission is justified because the change is truly internal and has no effect on usage, operations, or maintenance.

## Summary behavior

When relevant, mention which documentation was updated or still should be updated.
