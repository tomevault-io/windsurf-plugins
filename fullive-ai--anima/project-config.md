Keep every change tightly scoped to the requested goal.

## Core rule

Solve the target problem completely, but do not let the task expand into unrelated cleanup, redesign, or opportunistic refactoring.

## Scope rules

- Implement the smallest sufficient change that correctly solves the task.
- Fix directly related issues when needed to make the solution complete.
- Avoid unrelated renames, formatting sweeps, moves, or cleanups.
- Avoid changing code that is not necessary for correctness, integration, validation, or compatibility.
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless required.

## Allowed scope expansion

You may extend scope slightly only when the additional work is:

- necessary to complete the task correctly
- needed to prevent an obvious regression
- required for compatibility
- required to keep tests or builds passing
- small, low-risk, and directly adjacent to the same root cause

## Disallowed scope expansion

Do not expand scope just because you noticed:

- old code you dislike
- naming inconsistencies
- possible future improvements
- architectural ideas unrelated to the request
- broad style issues
- unrelated technical debt

## Before making extra changes

Ask internally:

- Is this required for the requested outcome?
- Is it required for correctness or compatibility?
- Is it required for validation to pass?
- Is it directly tied to the same root cause?

If not, leave it alone.

## Completion rule

A task is better completed with a focused, safe, reviewable diff than with a large diff that tries to improve everything.
