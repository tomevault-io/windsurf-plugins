Any change that affects stored data, config formats, message contracts, or upgrade paths must preserve compatibility or manage migration explicitly.

## Core rule

Prefer backward-compatible evolution. If backward compatibility is not possible, implement a safe migration path.

## Compatibility-sensitive areas

- persisted data
- database schemas
- config structures
- API contracts
- event schemas
- message payloads
- topic structures
- cache formats
- file formats
- serialized state
- user settings
- integration boundaries

## Preferred approach

- make additive changes first
- support old and new formats during transition when feasible
- avoid instant hard breaks
- preserve existing behavior for existing consumers unless the task explicitly requires change

## If a migration is needed

Do the following where applicable:

1. identify what old state exists
2. define the new target state
3. provide a transition path
4. update readers and writers consistently
5. preserve idempotency when possible
6. add migration or compatibility tests
7. update docs and examples

## Breaking compatibility

Only break compatibility when necessary.

If required:

- minimize the blast radius
- update all known dependents
- document the change clearly
- note any manual migration steps
- avoid partial migration states that are hard to recover from

## Avoid

- silently changing formats
- upgrading only one side of a producer-consumer boundary
- assuming all existing data already matches the new model
- deleting compatibility code before consumers are updated
