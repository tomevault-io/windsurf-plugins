Use a branch-first, commit-early workflow suitable for a maintained open source repository.

## Core rule

Before making meaningful code changes, ensure the work is on a dedicated task branch rather than on a protected or shared integration branch.

Once work starts, preserve progress through small, logical, reviewable commits instead of one large accumulated diff.

## Branch behavior

At the beginning of meaningful work:

1. Check the current branch.
2. If already on a suitable task branch for the current task, continue there.
3. If on a protected or shared branch such as `main`, `master`, `develop`, `dev`, or `release`, create and switch to a dedicated task branch before making meaningful edits.
4. If on a branch unrelated to the current task, create and switch to a new task branch instead of mixing concerns.

## Branch naming

Use short, descriptive, task-focused branch names.

Prefer patterns such as:

- `fix/dashboard-refresh-bug`
- `fix/mqtt-timeout-handling`
- `feat/device-status-history`
- `refactor/adapter-payload-parser`
- `docs/env-setup-clarification`
- `test/add-timeout-regression`

Branch names should be:

- lowercase
- concise
- descriptive
- scoped to one task or one closely related set of changes

Avoid vague names such as:

- `temp`
- `misc`
- `work`
- `updates`
- `new-branch`

## Commit behavior

Commit after each completed, coherent unit of work.

A commit should represent one logical step such as:

- one bug fix
- one small feature slice
- one focused refactor
- one interface update with its direct caller adjustments
- one docs update tied to a code change
- one regression test plus the related fix

## Commit quality

Each commit should be:

- small enough to review easily
- coherent in purpose
- safe to revert independently
- tied to a clear intent
- validated whenever practical

Write concise commit messages that describe the intent clearly.

Prefer:

- `fix dashboard polling after reconnect`
- `add regression test for adapter timeout`
- `refactor mqtt payload normalization`
- `update docs for broker configuration`

Avoid:

- `changes`
- `fix stuff`
- `update code`
- `wip`

## Do not commit yet if

- the code is in an obviously broken intermediate state
- the change is only half-wired
- imports, types, or tests are failing because the step is incomplete
- the commit would include unrelated accidental edits

## Safety rules

- Do not commit secrets, credentials, tokens, or private keys.
- Do not force-push, rewrite shared history, or delete branches unless explicitly requested.
- Do not merge into protected branches unless explicitly requested.

## End-state expectation

By the end of the task:

- work should live on a dedicated task branch
- progress should be preserved in a sequence of small logical commits
- history should be readable, reviewable, and easy to roll back
