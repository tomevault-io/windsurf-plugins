If needed to complete the task, you may install required tools, dependencies, local utilities, skills, or MCP servers yourself.

Only do this when the installation is clearly necessary for progress, validation, automation, debugging, or repository workflow support.

Prefer:
- existing project tools first
- minimal, well-scoped additions
- commonly used, maintainable solutions
- setup that matches the current project and workflow

Do not install unnecessary, redundant, risky, or unrelated tools.

When installing something new:
- keep the change intentional and minimal
- document it if it affects setup, workflow, or contributor experience
- update relevant config or docs when needed
- avoid destructive or high-impact system changes unless explicitly requested
