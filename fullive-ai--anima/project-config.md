Handle secrets, environment variables, and operational configuration with extreme care.

## Never do these things

- never reveal secrets, tokens, API keys, passwords, private certificates, or credentials in output
- never hardcode secrets into source files
- never copy secret values into examples, tests, or docs
- never overwrite existing secret files casually
- never log sensitive values unless explicitly safe and redacted

## Environment safety rules

- treat `.env` and similar files as sensitive
- prefer `.env.example` or documented placeholders for required configuration
- when adding a new environment variable, also update the example or docs where appropriate
- do not assume production values
- do not silently change operational defaults with risky impact

## Operational safety

Be cautious with changes affecting:

- authentication
- authorization
- network endpoints
- external service credentials
- deployment settings
- broker settings
- database connection settings
- billing or payment config
- production runtime behavior

## If a task requires secret-dependent work

- use placeholders when possible
- explain clearly what external value is required
- continue all non-blocked work first
- only pause when the missing secret or permission truly prevents further progress

## Output discipline

When discussing config changes:

- reference variable names, not secret values
- use sanitized examples
- preserve user privacy and environment safety
