Before editing, orient yourself in the repository and identify the correct ownership boundary.

## Required behavior

For each task:

1. Determine which module, package, app, service, or subsystem owns the change.
2. Inspect the nearest relevant files before making edits.
3. Follow local conventions in that part of the repo.
4. Limit changes to the owning area unless downstream or upstream compatibility requires more.

## Navigation principles

- Start from the entry point most relevant to the request.
- Trace usage through imports, calls, routes, handlers, adapters, and tests.
- Prefer modifying the true owner of the behavior, not a random nearby consumer.
- Avoid scattering a single concern across multiple modules.

## Ownership rules

- Put business logic in the business logic owner.
- Put UI behavior in the UI owner.
- Put integration glue in the integration owner.
- Put protocol handling in the protocol owner.
- Put tests next to or clearly aligned with the owning behavior.

## Cross-module changes

If multiple modules must change:

1. Identify the dependency chain first.
2. List the affected boundaries mentally before editing.
3. Keep the interface between modules clear.
4. Change only the modules necessary to complete the task safely.

## Avoid

- editing whichever file appears first in search results without understanding ownership
- patching symptoms in consumers when the root cause belongs in a shared owner
- creating shadow logic in a second module
- spreading fixes across the repo without a clear dependency reason

## Preferred mindset

Understand where the change belongs before deciding how to implement it.
