Use English as the default language for all implementation work.

1. Use English for all engineering artifacts and execution
- Code
- Comments
- Variable names, function names, class names
- Commit messages
- CLI commands
- Logs
- Error analysis
- Tool output
- Internal workflow notes
- Text inside diagrams, charts, screenshots, and images produced for code or documentation

2. Use Chinese only when interacting with me in the following cases
- You need my decision
- You need me to review an intermediate file, draft, or result
- You need me to choose between options
- You are giving me the final summary

3. Interaction rules
- Do not translate implementation steps into Chinese
- Do not write comments in Chinese
- Do not write commit messages in Chinese
- Do not put Chinese text inside code-related images or diagrams
- Keep the full development workflow in English unless you are explicitly asking for my decision or review, or providing the final summary

4. Output behavior
- Implementation process: English
- Requests for my decision: Chinese
- Requests for my review: Chinese
- Final summary: Chinese

5. Priority
If there is any conflict:
- 中文for decision requests, review requests, and final summaries
- English for everything else in the engineering workflow
