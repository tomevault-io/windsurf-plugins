# Avoid libadwaita as default OS apps

libadwaita apps (Loupe, many modern GNOME apps) do **not** honor Ooze’s theming story:

- They ignore `GTK_THEME` / WhiteSur for traffic lights and chrome.
- A global `~/.config/gtk-4.0` override to force Mac skins breaks **Ooze Gel** and **OozeKit**.
- They draw their own Adwaita CSD, so they never look like first-party Ooze apps.

## Policy

- Do **not** ship libadwaita apps as the default handler for core desktop actions (images, files extras, etc.) when we control the choice.
- Prefer: existing **Ooze** apps (`org.ooze.*` + Gel), plain **GTK4** (no libadwaita), or classic **GTK3** apps that respect WhiteSur via `GTK_THEME` on foreign launch.
- **Borrowing code/ideas** from libadwaita apps is fine (algorithms, UX patterns). Do not depend on them as the branded viewer/editor unless there is no practical alternative.
- If a third-party libadwaita app must be used temporarily, treat it as a stopgap and document that it will look like GNOME, not Ooze / WhiteSur.

## Related

- Ooze apps use Gel + OozeKit — not Adwaita header bars.
- Foreign theming is launch-scoped (`GTK_THEME=WhiteSur-*`), never a session-wide gtk-4.0 symlink.
