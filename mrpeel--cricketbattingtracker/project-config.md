# Antigravity Agent Configuration

Welcome to the Pitch Analytix Pro (Cricket Batting Tracker) workspace. This file serves as the bootstrap context for agent execution.

## 👥 Roles & Governance
- **Architect (User)**: Defines high-level design, product requirements, and features. Reviewer of plans.
- **Executor (Agent)**: Reads files, proposes plans, executes implementation tasks, runs verification checks, and commits code.

## 📂 Memory Layout
All state and memory documents reside under the `.agents/` folder:
- **`ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`**: Contains system objectives, technical approach, active phase objectives, feature backlog catalog, and verification criteria.  Only keep the last 5 completed items in the backlog.  Move other items into the project's change_logfile.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Maps the system structure, data flow diagrams, WearOS real-time kinematics state machine, and directory layout.
- **`LEARNINGS.md`**: Tracks key decisions, bugs resolved, and performance scorecard historical summaries. Only keep the last 5-7 active learning entries (under 15KB). Move older entries to `.agents/archive/LEARNINGS_ARCHIVE.md` to conserve token quota.
- **`rules/`**: Workspace directives and constraints.
  - **`operating_protocol.md`**: The step-by-step execution protocol (CLARIFY, PLAN, EXECUTE, VERIFY, COMMIT) and stateless operations rules.

Before starting any task, the executor must read `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`, `.agents/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.agents/LEARNINGS.md`, and `.agents/rules/operating_protocol.md` to load the current workspace state.

## Context Management & Token Quota Optimization
To prevent chat bloat and conserve token quota, you must actively police the conversation history for topic drift:

1. **Detect Topic Shifts**: Before executing a new task or sub-task, analyze whether the previous context is likely to be required.  Strive to keep the immediate context to the last 2-3 turns.
2. **Propose Context Pruning**: If context is not required, do not immediately ingest the entire chat history. Instead, halt and explicitly ask the user:
   > *"I notice we are shifting focus to [New Topic]. Should we prune our short-term chat context to save your token quota? If yes, I will sync current progress to `.agents/rules/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` and archive this thread's previous history."*
3. **Enforce Progressive Disclosure**: When a topic shift is approved, rely strictly on `@mention` files (e.g., `@ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`, `@LEARNINGS.md`, `@ARCHITECTURE.md`) for baseline project memory rather than reading old chat code blocks.

## 🚫 Strictly Forbidden Tools
- **DO NOT USE WHISPER AI**: Local Whisper models (like Whisper `base` or `tiny`) are strictly forbidden for audio narration transcription. They are highly fragile under continuous background noise (such as bowling machine hum), leading to hallucinated repetition loops and missing anchors. Gemini's direct audio transcription must always be used instead, with systematic clock drift resolved mathematically at the sensor alignment layer (e.g. using 2D Joint Offset and Linear Drift Rate Optimization).
