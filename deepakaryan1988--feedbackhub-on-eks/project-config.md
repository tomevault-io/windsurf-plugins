### CI/CD Expectations

- **Non‑interactive**: Use `--yes`, `-input=false`, and similar flags. Fail fast.
- **Caching**: Cache deps (npm, Docker layers, Terraform plugins) safely.
- **Checks**: fmt/lint/test/build/security scan stages. Artifacts uploaded for troubleshooting.
- **Immutability**: Build once, tag with git SHA, promote same image across envs.
- **Secrets**: Pass via CI secrets store; never echo. Mask sensitive output.
- **Terraform**: `fmt` + `validate` + `plan` in PRs; applies via protected branches.
