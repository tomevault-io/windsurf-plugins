# From-scratch bake (real 3DS ship path)

This is the workflow. Do not invent a side path (`--skip-pack` “just to test hardware”, PNG scratch `cache/new_img.bin`, **Azahar-only** LayeredFS with no CIA inject).

Azahar LayeredFS is still **required for emulator testing** — see `bakable-and-layeredfs`. Bake without a LayeredFS deploy, or LayeredFS without bake, is incomplete.

## What to run

Drop a decrypted `.cia` / `.3ds` on **`Drop CIA or 3DS Here to Patch.bat`**.

If `release/bake_img.bin` is missing **or** `release/bake_stamp.txt` ≠ `PATCHER_RELEASE` (currently `v1.0.0-rc4` on main), the bat runs:

```bash
python tools/rebuild_bake_img.py --rom <dropped ROM>
```

That **will bake**: PNG pack → chrome deploys → TRB overlay → **always** rebuilds `release/name_input_code.bin` from vanilla (`code.bin.bak` preferred) via `deploy_name_input_en.py`. Then `patch_cia.py` injects bake + overlay + name-input.

## `cache/` is deleted on every from-scratch build

Drop and `rebuild_bake_img.py --rom` (no `--skip-pack`) delete the **entire** `cache/` folder, then extract a full RomFS from the dropped ROM (`ensure_vanilla_from_rom(..., force=True, slim=False)`). The CIA `--romfs` template is that new tree, and only if `cache/vanilla_from_rom/romfs/Plus` exists. A slim tree (`img.bin` + scripts, no `Plus/`) must not be packed.

Do not undo this. Do not reuse `cache/vanilla_from_rom`, `cache/img_pack`, or `NLPP_USE_PACK_CACHE` across a from-scratch run. Do not point `--romfs` at `script\bin\script` alone. `--skip-pack` and `--reseed-from-pack` leave `cache/` in place; they are not from-scratch.

PNG pack is the long part (roughly 40 minutes to 2 hours cold, depending on hardware). Name-input rebuild is seconds. Watch `[timer]` lines.

## After name-input / cave changes

Caves must stay in **`.text` RX** (`src/patch_input_cave_map.py`: shared `0x0068F800`, romaji `0x0068F900`). Pads in `.rodata` (`0x006E6A38`, `0x006FBB08`) work in Azahar and **prefetch-abort on hardware**.

Ground-up Drop picks that up because bake **deletes and rewrites** `name_input_code.bin`. Install the new CIA; remove any old Luma `exefs/code.bin` overlay.

If only `code.bin` changed and bake stamp already matches: Drop can inject the rebuilt `name_input_code.bin` in minutes **without** re-packing PNGs. Full from-scratch is still correct when menus/assets changed or leftover bake is stale.

## Don’t

- `--skip-pack` to skip a required from-scratch pack (keeps old `bake_img.bin`)
- `NLPP_WITH_IMAGES=0` (Drop forbids incomplete CIAs)
- Patch already-patched `extracted/exefs/code.bin` — vanilla is `code.bin.bak` / ROM extract
