# Velith — AI-Native Book Publishing Pipeline

## Overview

Build books like software. 6-phase pipeline from blank page to published book, with quality gates at every stage.

```
Phase 0: Onboarding → Phase 1: Ideation → Phase 2: Outlining → Phase 3: Drafting → Phase 4: Editing → Phase 5: Publishing
```

## Phase Router

Detect current project state and route to the correct phase:

1. **No project exists** → Phase 0 (Onboarding)
2. **Project exists, no outline** → Phase 1 (Ideation)
3. **Outline exists, no drafts** → Phase 2 (Outlining) validation, then Phase 3
4. **Drafts exist, incomplete** → Phase 3 (Drafting)
5. **All drafts complete** → Phase 4 (Editing)
6. **Editing complete** → Phase 5 (Publishing)

**Detection:** check for `drafts/` directory, `outline.md`, `STYLE.md`, `PRD.md`.

## Phase Details

### Phase 0: Onboarding
- Genre selection (fiction/non-fiction/technical/screenplay/poetry/game/academic/custom)
- Target audience definition
- Language selection
- Project directory setup
- Source material scan (existing notes, articles, code)
- Generate `STYLE.md` (voice, tone, conventions)
- Generate `PRD.md` (book requirements)

### Phase 1: Ideation
- Market research (competing titles, gaps)
- Core concept distillation (elevator pitch)
- Unique value proposition
- Scope definition (chapters, word count, timeline)
- Save to `ideation.md`

### Phase 2: Outlining
- Generate full chapter outline with dependencies
- Per-chapter specs: title, hook, key concepts, word target, difficulty level
- Cross-chapter reference map
- Save to `outline.md`
- Agent `book-architect` validates structure

### Phase 3: Drafting
- Plan-Then-Execute: chapter-by-chapter generation
- Each chapter gets: outline context + previous chapter summary + style guide
- Parallel chapter generation (max 4 concurrent)
- Agent `scene-generator` decomposes chapters into scenes (fiction only)
- Agent `chapter-writer` generates each chapter
- Agent `continuity-editor` checks cross-chapter consistency
- Quality gate: line count, frontmatter, style compliance

### Phase 4: Editing
- 5-stage editing pipeline:
  1. Editorial Assessment (macro structure)
  2. Developmental Edit (flow, pacing, gaps)
  3. Line Edit (sentence-level clarity)
  4. Copy Edit (grammar, consistency)
  5. Proofread (final typos)
- Agent `style-doctor` enforces voice consistency
- Generate editing report with severity-ranked issues

### Phase 5: Publishing
- Format conversion: EPUB, PDF, MOBI, TXT, Markdown (via Pandoc + Calibre)
- Agent `cover-designer` generates cover concepts + image prompts
- Agent `marketing-expert` creates launch strategy
- Metadata, title candidates, KDP checklist

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Phase |
|-------|------|-------|
| `book-architect` | Structure validation, outline scoring | 2 |
| `chapter-writer` | Chapter draft generation | 3 |
| `continuity-editor` | Cross-chapter consistency | 3-4 |
| `style-doctor` | Voice/tone consistency, AI-slop detection | 4 |
| `scene-generator` | Scene-level GMC+RDD breakdown (fiction only) | 3 |
| `cover-designer` | Cover concepts + image prompts | 5 |
| `marketing-expert` | Reader personas, launch strategy | 5 |

## Project Structure

```
{project-dir}/
├── PRD.md              # Book requirements (Phase 0)
├── STYLE.md            # Voice, tone, conventions (Phase 0)
├── ideation.md         # Ideas, market research (Phase 1)
├── outline.md          # Full chapter outline (Phase 2)
├── drafts/             # Chapter drafts (Phase 3)
├── edits/              # Editing reports (Phase 4)
├── publish/            # Final outputs (Phase 5)
└── sources/            # Source material references
```

## Quality Gates

| Phase | Gate | Evidence |
|-------|------|----------|
| 0 | Project initialized | PRD.md + STYLE.md exist |
| 1 | Concept validated | Elevator pitch + 3 competing titles analyzed |
| 2 | Outline complete | All chapters specified + cross-reference map |
| 3 | Drafts complete | All chapters meet word target + frontmatter |
| 4 | Editing complete | 5-stage pipeline passed + <5 issues remaining |
| 5 | Publish ready | EPUB/PDF generated + metadata complete |

## Design Principles

- **Plan-Then-Execute** — Outline first, validate, then write
- **Idempotent** — Skip completed chapters, resume from where you left off
- **Token Efficient** — Summary-based context, not full text
- **Genre-Aware** — Different structures, templates, and validation per genre
- **Quality Gated** — Each phase must pass criteria before proceeding
