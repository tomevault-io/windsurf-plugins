# Velith — Editing Pipeline and Style Conventions

## 5-Stage Editing Pipeline

| Stage | Focus | What to check |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 1. Editorial Assessment | Macro structure | Chapter order, pacing, gap analysis, argument flow |
| 2. Developmental Edit | Flow and content | Transitions, evidence quality, redundant sections, missing content |
| 3. Line Edit | Sentence-level clarity | Word choice, sentence rhythm, paragraph flow, voice consistency |
| 4. Copy Edit | Grammar and consistency | Grammar, punctuation, terminology consistency, formatting |
| 5. Proofread | Final polish | Typos, spacing, formatting artifacts, cross-reference accuracy |

## AI-Slop Detection Patterns

These patterns indicate AI-generated text that reads as inauthentic. Flag and fix:

**Excessive modifiers:** revolutionary, game-changer, groundbreaking, cutting-edge, transformative, innovative, seamless, robust, comprehensive

**Repetitive transitions:** overuse of "however", "moreover", "furthermore", "additionally", "notably"

**Generic conclusions:** "in conclusion", "in summary", "ultimately", "at the end of the day", "it's important to note"

**Weak hedging:** "can be", "seems like", "it could be argued", "one might say", "arguably"

**English AI markers:** "delve", "tapestry", "landscape" (metaphorical), "nuanced", "multifaceted", "plethora", "myriad"

**List overuse:** 5+ consecutive bullet points without prose context

## Style Drift Indicators

Quantitative signals that a chapter's style has drifted from the rest:

- **Sentence length variance** — compare per-chapter average against book mean
- **Paragraph length distribution** — flag chapters with significantly different patterns
- **Type-token ratio** — vocabulary diversity should remain consistent
- **POV mixing** — detect shifts between 1st/3rd person within chapters

## Severity Classification

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Critical | Breaks reader comprehension, factual error, POV violation | Must fix before proceeding |
| Major | Style drift, inconsistent tone, structural gap | Should fix, flag for review |
| Minor | Word choice, transition quality, formatting | Nice to fix, batch at proofread stage |

## Tone Rules

- All tone checks reference `STYLE.md` in the project root
- Flag abrupt shifts between chapters
- Detect language mixing violations (e.g., Korean text with unmarked English insertions)
- Check emphasis overuse (bold, italic, exclamation marks)

## Editing Output

Generate `edits/editorial-report.md` with:
- Issue location (file, line range)
- Pattern detected
- Severity level
- Fix suggestion
- Quantitative metrics (sentence length, vocabulary diversity, etc.)
