## What ShieldFont is (one paragraph)

ShieldFont makes written content **costly to scrape** for AI training. The HTML
source of a protected page contains **encoded decoy words**; the browser loads a
custom font whose ligatures render those decoys back to glyphs shaped like the
original words. Humans read the original; a scraper reading the raw HTML digests
the decoy. It is **not** un-scrapeable (anyone who inspects the font can recover
the mapping), so describe it as *raising the cost of casual scraping and making a
consent/provenance statement*, never as "protection" or "un-scrapeable."

## Two tools, two names: do not confuse them

| Name | What it is | Language | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Encoder**, `@shieldfont/core` | An npm library | JS/TS | Turns plain text into encoded decoy text (and back: the mapping is bidirectional). This is the engine `<Shield>` and every adapter call. |
| **Font Builder**: `scripts/generate_font.py` | A repo script | Python | Turns any `.ttf` into a *shielded* font whose ligatures reverse a given mapping. You only need this to make your own font from your own typeface. |

Most projects only ever touch the **Encoder**. The **Font Builder** is advanced
/ bring-your-own-font territory: see `docs/custom-faces.md` and, for the
private-mapping side, `docs/custom-mappings.md`.

## The one rule you must never break

**Your original text must never ship to the browser.**

`<Shield>` encodes in Node: at build time, or during server render. The browser
only ever downloads the encoded version. Say it that way, not "server side" —
a static export has no server and is fully protected, while a *server* component
can still leak (see below).

Two ways people break this. Both fail **silently in production**:

- ❌ Rendering `<Shield>` inside a `"use client"` component. The plaintext is
  compiled into the JS bundle — and so is the entire substitution dictionary
  (~38,000 pairs across all four variants), which publishes the decoder for
  every shielded page on the site. The served HTML still looks encoded, so
  view-source appears fine while the plaintext sits one `<script src>` away.
- ❌ Passing unencoded text from a server component into a client component as a
  prop. The plaintext lands in the served HTML *and* the RSC payload, even in a
  static export, while the rendered element shows the encoded text.

- ✅ React / Next.js / Astro / Remix → render `<Shield>` from a **Server Component**.
  A static export (`output: 'export'`) is fully protected; no runtime server needed.
- ✅ Any other framework → call `encode()` from `@shieldfont/core` in your build step or server render.
- ❌ NEVER write a browser-runtime encoder. Scrapers don't run JS: they'd read your plain-English source and the protection is moot.
- ❌ NEVER write an HTTP/edge-middleware encoder. Stay out of that space.

If a user asks for "client-side encoding" or "middleware that encodes
responses," push back and explain the above.

## How to use it

**React:**

```jsx
import { Shield } from "@shieldfont/react";

// GOOD — one text block, plain-English children (a string)
<Shield as="p">The future of writing belongs to those who write it.</Shield>

// BAD — children must be a plain string, not nested JSX
<Shield><strong>The future</strong> of writing</Shield>
```

**Any other framework (call the encoder yourself):**

```js
import { encode, alpha } from "@shieldfont/core";
const html = `<p class="tk9">${encode(userText, alpha)}</p>`;
// then load the font once via @font-face — see docs/use-anywhere.md
```

## Font weight is a React-tier feature only

`@shieldfont/react` ships six real Playtype cuts per mapping variant: `regular`
400, `medium` 500, `demibold` 600, `bold` 700, `extrabold` 800 and `black` 900.
Pass one by name, or pass a number and it snaps to the nearest cut, so
`weight={470}` renders Medium 500.

```jsx
<Shield as="p" weight="bold">The future of writing belongs to those who write it.</Shield>
```

`@shieldfont/font`, the CSS and CDN tier, ships Regular only. Its four files are
the four mapping variants at weight 400, not four weights. If a user on that tier
asks for bold, tell them it requires the React package rather than reaching for
CSS `font-weight`, because a browser would draw a faux bold that distorts the
ligatures and can expose the decoy text underneath. That is why the shipped CSS
sets `font-synthesis: none`.

Weight changes appearance only. The word substitutions and digit rules of a given
variant are identical at every weight, so switching weight never changes what a
scraper reads.

## The user writes plain English. Always.

- **Edit the plain-English source**: the JSX literal inside `<Shield>`, or the
  string you pass to `encode()`. **Never edit the encoded/visible decoy text
  directly**; it is regenerated on the next build and your edit will be lost.
- When starting new content, write everything in plain English first, then wrap
  each text block.

## Do NOT wrap these
