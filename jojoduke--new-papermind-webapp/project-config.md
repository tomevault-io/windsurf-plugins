# Papermind

**Papermind** is an AI-native study and exam prep web app that personalizes learning through intelligent quiz generation.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea
Exam prep and studying should feel personalized, not generic.  
Papermind acts like your own study companion — a friendly AI named **Paige**, a pink fox mascot who helps you understand, revise, and prepare smarter.

---

## 🎯 MVP Scope
**Goal:** Build a focused quiz-based study experience for students and professionals.

### Features
1. **Upload materials**
   - Users can upload PDFs, notes, or study guides.
   - File content is used to generate quizzes.

2. **Generate personalized quizzes**
   - AI (via Mastra) creates questions based on uploads or selected exam types (SAT, WAEC, GRE, University finals, CFA).
   - Quizzes adapt based on performance.

3. **Track progress**
   - Stores quiz history and weak topics in Convex.
   - Can regenerate targeted questions later.

    "ownerId": "user_123",
    "filename": "chapter1.pdf",
    "r2Key": "user_123/chapter1.pdf",
    "r2Url": "https://r2-bucket-link/user_123/chapter1.pdf"
