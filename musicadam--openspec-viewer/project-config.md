# OpenSpec Viewer

Interactive browser viewer for OpenSpec directories.

└── dist-frontend/            # Built frontend (gitignored)
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Run both server and frontend in dev mode
npm run build        # Build for production
```

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Fastify, ws (WebSocket), chokidar (file watching)
- **Frontend**: Svelte 5, Tailwind CSS
- **Build**: TypeScript, Vite

## Code Conventions

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Use ES modules (type: "module")
- Prefer async/await over callbacks
- Keep components small and focused

## OpenSpec Format

OpenSpec is a specification-driven development framework with:
- `project.md` - Project conventions
- `specs/` - Current specifications (what IS built)
- `changes/` - Proposals for changes (what SHOULD change)
  - `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `design.md` - Each gets its own tab
  - `specs/` subdirectory with delta changes (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED)
  - `mockups/` or any subdirectory - HTML/MD files grouped by folder
- `changes/archive/` - Completed changes with date prefix

## File Rendering

The viewer supports rendering arbitrary `.md` and `.html` files in change directories:

- **Markdown files**: Rendered with syntax highlighting and GitHub-flavored markdown
- **HTML files**: Rendered in sandboxed iframes with full CSS/JS support

Files are organized into tabs:
1. Core files (`proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `design.md`) each get their own tab
2. Files in subdirectories are grouped by folder name (e.g., `mockups/` becomes "Mockups" tab)
3. Spec deltas appear in the final "Spec Deltas" tab
