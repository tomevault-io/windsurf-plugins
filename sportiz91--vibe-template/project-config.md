# Project Instructions
# Project Instructions

Use specification and guidelines as you build the app.

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy.

Your goal is to completely finish whatever I ask for.

You will see <ai_context> tags in the code. These are context tags that you should use to help you understand the codebase.

## Overview

This is a web app template.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, Framer Motion
- Backend: Postgres, Supabase, Drizzle ORM, Server Actions
- Auth: Clerk
- Payments: Stripe
- Analytics: PostHog
- Deployment: Vercel

## Project Structure

- `actions` - Server actions
  - `db` - Database related actions
  - Other actions
- `app` - Next.js app router
  - `api` - API routes
  - `route` - An example route
    - `_components` - One-off components for the route
    - `layout.tsx` - Layout for the route
    - `page.tsx` - Page for the route
- `components` - Shared components
  - `ui` - UI components
  - `utilities` - Utility components
- `db` - Database
  - `schema` - Database schemas
- `lib` - Library code
  - `hooks` - Custom hooks
  - `services` - Business logic services
- `prompts` - Prompt files
- `public` - Static assets
- `types` - Type definitions

## Rules

Follow these rules when building the app.

### General Rules

- Use `@` to import anything from the app unless otherwise specified
- Use kebab case for all files and folders unless otherwise specified
- Don't update shadcn components unless otherwise specified

#### Env Rules

- If you update environment variables, update the `.env.example` file
- All environment variables should go in `.env.local`
- Do not expose environment variables to the frontend
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables that need to be accessed from the frontend
- Always access environment variables via the centralized config module (`serverConfig` and `publicEnv` from `@/lib/config`). Do not use `process.env` directly in application code.

#### Type Rules

Follow these rules when working with types.

- When importing types, use `@/types`
- Name files like `example-types.ts`
- All types should go in `types`
- Make sure to export the types in `types/index.ts`
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases
- If referring to db types, use `@/db/schema` such as `SelectTodo` from `todos-schema.ts`

An example of a type:

`types/actions-types.ts`

```ts
export type ActionState<T> =
  | { isSuccess: true; message: string; data: T }
  | { isSuccess: false; message: string; data?: never }
```

And exporting it:

`types/index.ts`

```ts
export * from "./actions-types"
```

- Always access environment variables via the centralized config module (`serverConfig` and `publicEnv` from `@/lib/config`). Do not use `process.env` directly in application code.
