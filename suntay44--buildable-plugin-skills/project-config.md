description: Use Buildable's local-first builder brain for prompt-to-prototype app generation.
---


# Buildable Cursor Rule

When the user asks to generate a local app prototype, use Buildable's workflow from this local repository. Prefer running `buildable plan "<prompt>"` first when a concrete app spec would reduce ambiguity.

1. Classify the prompt with `core/classifier.md`.
2. Apply `core/ask-vs-build-policy.md`.
3. Generate an app spec with `core/app-spec-schema.md`.
4. Load only the relevant files from `knowledge/` and `templates/`.
5. Build locally with mock/local data by default.
6. Review against `knowledge/quality-rubrics/`.

Do not add billing, accounts, cloud previews, managed databases, telemetry, hosted deployment, or central template services unless explicitly requested.
