# Buildable Claude Instructions

Use Buildable when the user asks for a local app prototype or prompt-to-app generation.

## Local Context

Buildable is local repository context, not a hosted builder. Prefer `buildable plan "<prompt>"` when a concrete phase plan/app spec would help, then read only the relevant local files named by the spec.

## Workflow

1. Read `core/classifier.md`.
2. Apply `core/ask-vs-build-policy.md`.
3. Create an app spec using `core/app-spec-schema.md`.
4. Load the selected archetype, data model, screen graph, UI patterns, design playbook, quality rubric, and template plan.
5. Generate locally using mock/local data.
6. Review and fix before final response.

## Guardrail

Buildable V1 is not a hosted platform. Do not add builder accounts, billing, cloud previews, managed databases, telemetry, hosted deployments, central template services, or deployment features unless the user explicitly asks.

Resolve bundled `core/`, `knowledge/`, `templates/`, and skill paths from the full Buildable checkout (record its absolute path when copying these instructions). They are not relative to the app. Prefer the CLI result and its selected references rather than repeating classification.
