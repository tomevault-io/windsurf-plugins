# Repository Guidelines

## Product Direction

flameox is a permanently local evidence layer for coding agents investigating
performance, memory, execution, concurrency, and reliability. It gives an agent
a reproducible path from a runtime symptom to a conclusion that another person
or agent can inspect and try to disprove.

Existing profilers, benchmark tools, debuggers, and trace processors measure
runtime behavior. flameox coordinates those tools, preserves their native
artifacts and provenance, extracts bounded evidence, and compares runs and
experiments. The agent forms hypotheses, chooses discriminating experiments,
and explains the conclusion.

A typical investigation moves through:

```text
symptom → capture or import → bounded evidence → hypothesis
        → discriminating experiment → supported, refuted, or inconclusive finding
```

flameox is not a profiler, a generic bug finder, a hosted observability service,
an unrestricted command or SQL gateway, or an arbitrary source-code modification
system. Agents pass exact artifact paths or typed direct targets; there is no
workspace initialization or named workload configuration.
A feature belongs when it improves trustworthy collection, evidence
preservation, cross-evidence comparison, experimental validity, or bounded agent
drill-down without replacing an upstream tool.

When changing the product:

- preserve native artifacts, provenance, failed attempts, and experimental
  structure;
- distinguish observed, derived, and inferred claims;
- prefer bounded task-shaped operations over arbitrary commands or SQL;
- prefer integrating maintained measurement and replay tools through typed adapters;
  build custom measurement or replay machinery only when maintained tools cannot
  satisfy the required evidence, safety, or reproducibility contract;
- keep in-progress work request-owned, session scratch ephemeral, native
  artifacts content-addressed, and immutable evidence manifests authoritative;
- use DuckDB only as an ephemeral query engine; Flameox never creates or imports
  SQLite, though upstream packages may read their own native formats internally;
- keep CLI and MCP as thin transports over the same `AnalysisRuntime` and
  capability registry;
- let agents pass validated argv, cwd, environment, provider arguments, and
  request-lowerable limits directly to capture;
- expose coverage, limitations, compatibility, and containment truthfully;
- optimize for investigation leverage, not integration count.

Profiles guide discovery but do not prove causality, semantic correctness, or
performance improvement. Confirmatory claims require representative workloads,
declared metrics and estimands, compatible identities, preserved samples, and
a semantic oracle.

A passing test suite does not prove the documented behavior complete. Before
calling work complete, identify the relevant behavioral contracts and state any
remaining proof gaps.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

flameox is a Python 3.12+ package using a `src/` layout. `runtime.py` owns the
process-lifespan capability runtime; `runtime_contracts.py` owns strict public contracts; `repository.py`
owns optional immutable preservation; `execution.py` owns bounded subprocess
work; capability integrations live in `providers/`; reusable format parsers live
in `adapters/`; isolated protocols live in `workers/`; and `cli.py` plus `mcp/`
are thin transports. Tests mirror these semantic owners under `tests/`.

Read the relevant contract before changing product behavior:

- `docs/architecture.md` for process, package, dependency, and platform rules;
- `docs/storage-and-evidence.md` for storage, provenance, publication, and
  schema rules;
- `docs/investigations.md` for experiments, recipes, statistics, and evidence
  quality;
- `docs/adapters.md` for integration, compatibility, probing, and adapter policy
  behavior;
- `docs/runtime-safety.md` for concurrency, recovery, retention, integrity,
  security, privacy, and observability;
- `docs/interfaces.md` for CLI and MCP behavior and trust boundaries;

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use `uv` and the committed `uv.lock`:

```console
uv sync --extra dev --extra memory --extra trace --extra cpu
uv run flameox --help
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check src tests tools
uv run mypy src tests tools
```

The first command installs development tools and supported lightweight
integrations. Run a focused test while iterating, for example
`uv run pytest tests/test_runtime.py -q`. Marked performance checks
can be selected with `uv run pytest -m performance`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use four-space indentation, complete type annotations, and Python 3.12 syntax.
Ruff enforces a 100-character line limit, import ordering, modernization, and
common bug patterns; mypy runs in strict mode. Keep modules and functions
`snake_case`, classes `PascalCase`, and constants `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. Follow
existing architectural boundaries: keep request/runtime coordination in
`runtime.py`, repository publication in `repository.py`, transports thin, and
provider-specific behavior in `providers/`, with shared format parsing in
`adapters/` and isolated protocols in `workers/`.
