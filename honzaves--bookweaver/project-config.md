## What this project does

BookWeaver is a PyQt6 desktop app.  
It reads an English EPUB, condenses each chapter via Ollama, then
rewrites it in Spanish at a chosen CEFR level.

Chapters longer than 2000 words are split at paragraph boundaries,
processed in chunks, and rejoined after translation.

---

## File map

| File | Purpose | What to touch |
|---|---|---|
| `main.py` | Entry point only | Rarely |
| `app.py` | Main window, UI wiring, slot logic | For new UI elements |
| `worker.py` | Background thread, pipeline, file output | For pipeline changes |
| `prompts.py` | All LLM prompt strings | For prompt tuning |
| `widgets.py` | All reusable Qt widgets | For new/changed widgets |
| `settings.py` | Config loader — reads JSON, builds stylesheet | For loader logic changes |
| `bookweaver.json` | All user-editable settings: colours, models, timeout | User edits; no code changes |

## Architecture rules

1. **Imports flow one way:**  
   `main` → `app` → `worker`, `widgets`, `settings`  
   `worker` → `prompts`, `settings`  
   `widgets` → `settings`  
   `prompts` → nothing  
   `settings` → nothing (stdlib only)  
   Never import `app` or `worker` from `widgets` or `settings`.

2. **All colours come from `bookweaver.json` via `settings.py`.**  
   Never hardcode hex values anywhere else.

3. **`SETTINGS` and `OLLAMA_TIMEOUT` are module-level globals in `settings.py`**,
   populated by `_build()` at import time.

4. **`ProcessingWorker` must never import Qt UI classes** — it runs in a
   background thread and communicates only via pyqtSignal.

5. **`prompts.py` has no Qt dependency at all.**

6. **`creativity_to_temperature()` lives in `settings.py`** — single source
   of truth used by both `worker.py` and `widgets.py`.

---

## Configuration system

All user-editable values live in `bookweaver.json`:

- `colors` — hex values for the full colour palette
- `models` — list of `{label, value}` objects for the model dropdown
- `default_model` — value string of the default selection
- `ollama_timeout` — default timeout in seconds (overridable per-run in the UI)

`settings.py` loads this at import time via `_build()`, which populates all
`C_*` colour constants, builds `STYLESHEET`, populates `SETTINGS`, and sets
`OLLAMA_TIMEOUT`.

---

## Pipeline

For each chapter:

1. **Chunk** — if the chapter exceeds 2000 words, `_split_into_chunks()` splits
   it at paragraph boundaries into chunks of ≤2000 words.
2. **Summarise** — each chunk is condensed via `build_summary_prompt()`.
   The prompt uses a concrete word-count target (not a percentage framing)
   to avoid LLMs producing shorter output than requested.
3. **Rewrite** — each condensed chunk is rewritten in Spanish via
   `build_rewrite_prompt()`.
4. **Rejoin** — Spanish chunks are joined with `\n\n` into a single chapter result.

The log shows `Chapter 3.1/4`, `3.2/4` etc. when chunking is active.

---

## Resume system

`ProcessingWorker` tracks:
- `completed_results` — list of `(title, spanish_text)` tuples updated after each chapter
- `failed_at_chapter` — index of the chapter that failed

On `finished(False)`, if `completed_results` is non-empty, `BookWeaverApp`
stores a `_resume_state` dict and shows a **Resume** button. Pressing it
creates a new worker with `resume_from` and `prior_results` injected into
the config dict. The chapter loop skips already-done chapters and seeds
`results` with the prior work.

---

## Timeout

`_ollama_call` uses `self._timeout`, set from `config["timeout"]` (UI spinbox
value) falling back to `OLLAMA_TIMEOUT` from `bookweaver.json`.
The default is 600 seconds — large chapters processed at high `keep_pct`
generate many tokens and need generous timeouts.

**`_ollama_call` has no default for `temperature`** — it must always be passed
explicitly. This is intentional to prevent silent wrong values.

---

## Known historical issues

Repeated `str_replace` edits have previously caused `class Foo(Bar):`
declaration lines to be silently dropped.

**After any edit that touches a class boundary, verify with:**

```bash
grep -n "^class " *.py
```

Expected output:

```
app.py:    class BookWeaverApp(QMainWindow)
widgets.py: class SummarizationSlider(QWidget)
widgets.py: class CreativitySlider(QWidget)
widgets.py: class FilePickerRow(QWidget)
widgets.py: class FolderPickerRow(QWidget)
widgets.py: class LogWidget(QTextEdit)
widgets.py: class ProgressBar(QWidget)
worker.py:  class ProcessingWorker(QThread)
```

---

## Test suite

Tests live in `tests/`. No Qt installation required — `conftest.py` stubs
out PyQt6 at import time.

```bash
pytest           # run all tests
pytest -q        # quiet output
```

Tested modules: `prompts.py`, `settings.py`, `worker.py` (pure functions and
file I/O). The Qt pipeline and full Ollama integration are not unit-tested.

---

## Adding a new UI control

1. Add the widget to `widgets.py` if reusable, or inline in `app.py`.
2. Add the field to `_build_config()` in `app.py`.
3. Extract the value in `worker.py`'s `run()` method.
4. Pass it to the appropriate prompt builder in `prompts.py` if relevant.

---

## Adding a new output format

1. Add the radio button in `app.py → _add_options_group()`.
2. Add a `_write_xxx()` method in `worker.py`.
3. Add the branch in `worker.py → run()` after `# ── write output ──`.

---

## Prompt tuning

All LLM instructions live in `prompts.py`:

- `_LEVEL_GUIDANCE` — per-CEFR-level Spanish writing instructions
- `_creativity_instruction()` — maps creativity 1–10 to prose directives
- `build_summary_prompt()` — condensation prompt (word-count-target driven)
- `build_rewrite_prompt()` — Spanish rewrite prompt

**Important:** `build_summary_prompt` frames the task as "condense to N words"
rather than "summarise" — LLMs treat "summarise" as a signal to produce short
output regardless of any percentage instruction.

---

## PEP 8 notes

- `E221` (aligned assignments) is suppressed — intentional for colour/config blocks.
- Max line length is 100.
- Run `pycodestyle --statistics *.py` to check.
