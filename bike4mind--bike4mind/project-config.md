# Cursor Rules for Bike4Mind/Lumina5 Project

## 🚫 NEVER RUN SERVERS OR CLIENTS
- Do NOT run `npx sst dev`, `pnpm dev`, `npm run dev`, or any server/client commands
- Do NOT use `run_terminal_cmd` to start development servers
- The user intentionally runs these from their own terminals to keep track of which stage is which
- Only provide code changes, configuration updates, and debugging assistance

## 🎯 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
- Focus on code changes, bug fixes, and feature implementation
- Help with configuration files (sst.config.ts, package.json, etc.)
- Assist with debugging and troubleshooting
- Provide guidance on parallel development with different stages
- Help with AWS/SST configuration and deployment issues

## 🔧 ALLOWED TERMINAL COMMANDS
- File operations (read, edit, search)
- Git operations (status, log, etc.)
- Package management (install, update)
- Build processes (when explicitly requested)
- Testing commands
- Configuration validation
- Code analysis and linting

## 📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE AWARENESS
- This is a Bike4Mind/Lumina5 project with SST infrastructure
- Multiple parallel development stages are supported (lumina5-north, lumina5-west, etc.)
- User has custom zsh functions: `b4mdev <stage>`, `b4mpreview <stage>`
- Respect the user's stage management system

## 🚀 STAGE MANAGEMENT
- User manages stages manually: `b4mdev north`, `b4mdev west`, etc.
- Each stage creates separate AWS resources
- User runs servers in different terminals to avoid confusion
- Do NOT interfere with this workflow

## 💡 BEST PRACTICES
- Always ask before making any changes that could affect running services
- Provide clear explanations of what changes will do
- Help with configuration but let user handle execution
- Respect the user's terminal management preferences
- Separation of Concerns. Put code to its proper package or app directory.
- DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) principle. Avoid duplicate code.
- SOLID principle. Make the code more maintainable, flexible and scalable.

## 🧪 TESTING GUIDELINES - data-testid REQUIRED
### ⚠️ CRITICAL: ALWAYS ADD data-testid TO ALL INTERACTIVE UI COMPONENTS
- **MANDATORY**: Every Button, MenuItem, Input, IconButton, Checkbox, Link, and any interactive element MUST include a `data-testid` attribute
- **When to add**: Include `data-testid` when you first create the component, not later
- **DO NOT** use CSS class names for test element selection
- **Format**: `data-testid="component-action-element"` 

### Why data-testid is required:
- **Stability**: CSS classes can change due to styling updates or framework changes (MUI/Emotion generates random class names)
- **Intent**: `data-testid` clearly indicates the element is intended for testing
- **Separation of concerns**: Keeps test selectors separate from styling concerns
- **Best practice**: Recommended by React Testing Library and widely adopted in the testing community

### Examples of CORRECT usage:
✅ `<Button data-testid="submit-btn" onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</Button>`
✅ `<MenuItem data-testid="delete-item" onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</MenuItem>`
✅ `<Input data-testid="username-input" value={username} onChange={handleChange} />`
✅ `<IconButton data-testid="close-modal-btn" onClick={onClose}><CloseIcon /></IconButton>`
✅ `<Checkbox data-testid="accept-terms-checkbox" checked={accepted} />`

### Examples of WRONG usage:
❌ `<Button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</Button>` // Missing data-testid!
❌ `<Button className="submit-button">Submit</Button>` // Don't rely on className for tests

### Naming Convention:
- Format: `component-action-element`
- Examples: `"modal-confirm-btn"`, `"project-name-input"`, `"sidebar-toggle-btn"`
- Be descriptive and specific to the element's purpose
