# AGENTS.md

This file governs `imsgcrawl`.

## Boundary

`imsgcrawl` is the iMessage source crawler. It owns read-only access to the
local Messages database, source-native iMessage archive state, source-local
status/search/open commands, and the small contact-export surface that clawdex
can pull.

Do not add Gmail, Telegram, WhatsApp, Apple Contacts import, source cards,
clustering, canonical people, identity merge logic, or life-orientation logic
here. Those belong in the relevant source crawler, clawdex, or a higher-level
private aggregation layer.

Product code is Go. Keep source-specific SQLite parsing in this repo. Use
`github.com/openclaw/crawlkit` only for provider-neutral mechanics such as
control metadata, status payloads, output conventions, SQLite helpers, and
future archive/snapshot mechanics.

## Privacy

Messages data is private. Never commit or publish raw conversation contents,
names, phone numbers, emails, photos, attachments, account IDs, or local paths
that identify the user or other people unless the user explicitly consents.

When the user asks in chat for raw local command output, show the raw,
unredacted local interface output in chat exactly as produced. Do not use
`sed`, `awk`, `grep`, redaction filters, LLM summarization, or hand-edited
snippets to satisfy a raw-output request. The point is for the user to see the
full input/output context naturally. This raw/unredacted output is local-chat
only and must never leave the machine for GitHub, PRs, docs, tests, fixtures,
public comments, or any other external surface without explicit user consent.
Public PRs, docs, tests, and fixtures must use fake data, counts, schemas, or
redacted examples.

## CLI Shape

Stable CLI output is JSON-first and should follow crawl-family commands:
`metadata`, `status`, `contacts export`, and later `sync`, `chats`,
`messages`, `search`, and `tui`.

Agent-facing default text output is product surface, not incidental logging.
When command names, flags, defaults, output fields, or default text formatting
change, update the README command examples and the agent smoke/test coverage in
the same slice. README examples must be fake/private-safe and must never be
copied from live Messages data.

The first contact-export contract is intentionally narrow:

- root object key: `contacts`
- each contact has only `display_name` and `phone_numbers`
- one row per normalized phone value
- v0 allows phone fallback display names when Messages has no human name, but
  this is a compatibility choice to revisit before clawdex treats imported
  crawler names as canonical human names

Do not add `email_addresses` or source backrefs to the v0 export until clawdex,
telecrawl, wacrawl, and imsgcrawl are changed together.

## Engineering

Prefer simple, source-native code over framework-shaped abstractions. Do not
add flags, modes, daemons, background services, graph terminology, or generic
crawler-to-crawler interfaces before repeated crawler evidence requires them.

Keep files under 400 lines of code. If a file grows past that, do the smallest
sensible refactor into human-named files unless Josh explicitly says a larger
file is acceptable.

Tests must use temporary SQLite fixtures. Do not touch the live
`~/Library/Messages/chat.db` in unit tests.
