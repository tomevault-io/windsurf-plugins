# cybrix-skills

Entry point for contributors and AI agents working in this repo.

## What this repo is

Official Claude Code plugin marketplace from CYBRIX LLC. Ships one skill,
`cybrix-deploy`, that deploys static sites to the Cybrix hosted service
(`api.cybrix.cc`). The hosted backend lives in `cybrix-app` (private). The
marketing site lives in `cybrix-web`. This repo is the only one a typical
end user ever interacts with.

## Install command (for reference)

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add cybrixcc/cybrix-skills
claude plugin install cybrix-deploy@cybrix-skills
```

## Structure

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json     — marketplace catalog (repo IS the marketplace)
plugins/cybrix-deploy/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json        — plugin manifest (name, version, author)
  skills/cybrix-deploy/SKILL.md     — model-invoked skill instructions
  scripts/deploy.sh                 — bash helper called by the skill
  scripts/test-mock-server.sh       — local Python mock for E2E testing
  scripts/README.md                 — testing instructions
test-fixtures/static-site/          — 3-file HTML fixture for manual E2E tests
validate.sh                         — pre-commit: shellcheck + JSON + SKILL.md YAML
```

## Key rules

- **No pushes without review.** All commits stay local until the maintainer
  pushes manually.
- **Conventional commits.** `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:` prefixes.
- **validate.sh must pass** before any commit.
- **spec is in the code.** The canonical behaviour is defined in SKILL.md and
  deploy.sh. CONTRIBUTING.md defines scope. There is no separate spec file.

## Versioning policy

**Bump `plugin.json` version on every push that changes skill behaviour.**

Claude Code uses the version field to decide whether to offer an update.
If the version stays the same, `/plugin update` says "nothing to update" even
if the skill content changed. Users will run stale skill code until they
manually reinstall.

Rules:
- Any change to `SKILL.md` or `deploy.sh` → bump patch (`0.1.x`)
- New capability or API endpoint added → bump minor (`0.x.0`)
- Breaking change or new API major version → bump major (`x.0.0`)

**Every version bump requires three files to change together:**

1. `plugins/cybrix-deploy/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — the version field
2. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — `plugins[0].version` must match plugin.json
3. `plugins/cybrix-deploy/CHANGELOG.md` — add an entry describing what changed

If only plugin.json is bumped, `claude plugin validate .` will warn about the
mismatch and users installing from the marketplace will get the wrong version.

Always bump before pushing. Never ship a behaviour change without a version bump.

## Version bump procedure (follow exactly, in order)

1. Edit `plugins/cybrix-deploy/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — bump `version`
2. Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — bump `plugins[0].version` to match
3. Edit `plugins/cybrix-deploy/CHANGELOG.md` — prepend a new `## x.y.z` entry
4. Commit all three files together:
   `git add plugins/cybrix-deploy/.claude-plugin/plugin.json .claude-plugin/marketplace.json plugins/cybrix-deploy/CHANGELOG.md`
   `git commit -m "chore: bump x.y.z — <one-line summary>"`
5. Push: `git push origin master`
6. Create an annotated tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z — <same one-line summary>"`
7. Push the tag: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
8. Create a GitHub Release from the tag:
   `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "$(sed -n '/^## X.Y.Z/,/^## /p' plugins/cybrix-deploy/CHANGELOG.md | head -n -1)"`
   (Replace X.Y.Z with the actual version number)

This ensures the tag has release notes on GitHub and users see what changed.
Never create a tag without a corresponding GitHub Release — bare tags have no changelog visible on GitHub.

## CHANGELOG rules

`plugins/cybrix-deploy/CHANGELOG.md` is the user-facing release log. Every AI agent
working in this repo must follow these rules:

- **Version bump commit** (SKILL.md or deploy.sh changed) → add a new `## x.y.z` entry
  to CHANGELOG.md describing what changed in plain English. This is mandatory — it is
  one of the three files that must change together.
- **Docs/chore commit** (README, CLAUDE.md, scripts/README, etc.) → do NOT add a
  CHANGELOG entry. These changes are invisible to end users of the skill.
- Never edit existing CHANGELOG entries. Append only.
- Write entries from the user's perspective: what the skill does differently, not what
  files changed.
