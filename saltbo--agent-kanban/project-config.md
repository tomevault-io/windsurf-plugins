# Agent Kanban

Agent-first kanban board. React SPA + Hono API on Cloudflare Workers + D1.

## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.

## Architecture
- Monorepo: pnpm workspaces
- Frontend: apps/web/src/ — React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Backend: apps/web/server/ — Hono API, repo layer, auth, SSE
- Worker entry: apps/web/worker/index.ts — exports Hono app + TunnelRelay DO
- Build: @cloudflare/vite-plugin — produces client assets + worker bundle
- Database: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- Durable Objects: TunnelRelay (WebSocket relay for daemon ↔ browser)
- CLI: packages/cli/ — TypeScript, published to npm
- Shared types: packages/shared/ — proper package with build step
- Agent skill: skills/agent-kanban/ — installed via `npx skills add` to target repos

## UI Principles
- **Read-only board** — the web UI is for observation and review, not task management
- **No task creation UI** — tasks are created exclusively by agents via CLI/API
- **No status transition buttons** — no claim/cancel/release/assign in the UI
- **No drag-and-drop** — card ordering is managed by agents
- **Only two review actions in UI**: reject (send back to agent) and complete (accept) — can be performed by humans or lead agents via API
- Board switcher and task detail (logs, PR, chat) are the only navigation interactions

## Patterns
- Data access: thin repo layer (taskRepo.ts, boardRepo.ts, agentRepo.ts, messageRepo.ts) — no raw SQL in route handlers
- Error handling: Hono onError + HTTPException — centralized error envelope { error: { code, message } }
- Claim atomicity: db.batch() for race-condition-free task claims
- Auth: Three identity types — **user** (Better Auth session), **machine** (@better-auth/api-key), **agent** (@better-auth/agent-auth Ed25519 JWT). Machines assign tasks; agents claim/review with own JWT. Data scoped by `owner_id`.
- Agent identity: registered via `POST /api/agents` with Ed25519 public key. Each agent has a cryptographic identity (identicon, fingerprint). Daemon generates ephemeral keypair per spawn.
- Agent status: idle → working (on claim/assign) → idle (on complete/release/cancel with no other active tasks) → offline (on stale timeout)
- Task lifecycle: Todo → Todo+assigned (daemon assign) → In Progress (agent claim) → In Review (agent review+PR) → Done (reviewer complete) or Cancelled (cancel at any stage). Reviewer = human or lead agent.
- Task dependencies: `depends_on` JSON array, cycle detection via recursive CTE (taskDeps.ts), `blocked` computed on read
- Task origin: `created_from` for single-level subtask tracking
- Stale detection: write-on-read in GET /api/boards/:id and inline before assign (taskStale.ts). 2h timeout, idempotent.
- SSE: TransformStream-based, 2s poll for 25s (CF Workers limit), Last-Event-ID resume via log ID → timestamp resolution (sse.ts). Emits typed events (`event: log` for task_logs, `event: message` for messages).
- Messages: `messages` table for human ↔ agent chat. `agent_id` = agent CLI session ID (used for `claude --resume`). D1 as message bus — daemon polls for human messages, browser reads via SSE.
- Machine daemon: `ak start` — poll loop, auto-claim todo tasks, spawn agent CLI per task. PID lock, graceful shutdown, exponential backoff. `processManager.ts` handles spawn/monitor/kill/chat relay.
- Repo management: `ak create repo` registers repo at tenant level. `ak get repo` lists registered repos.
- Data model: Board is the workspace unit. Repositories belong to owner (tenant-level, like machines). Tasks belong to boards, optionally linked to a repository. Machines belong to owner (user/org).

## Post-Write Workflow
After every significant code change, follow this sequence:

1. **Test** — invoke test-writer agent to write/update unit/integration tests and run them.
   - If changes touch frontend components (`apps/web/src/`), also invoke playwright-test-generator agent to create/update E2E tests, and playwright-test-healer to fix any broken existing E2E tests.
   - ALL PASS → proceed to step 2.
   - FAILURES → you (main agent) read the failure, decide if the bug is in source code or test code.
     - Source bug → fix the source code, re-run tests yourself.
     - Test bug → state why the test is wrong, then forward to test-writer (unit) or playwright-test-healer (E2E) agent to fix.
   - After all tests pass, proceed to step 2.
2. **Review** — invoke clean-code-reviewer agent (reviews both source and test code).
   - REVISE on source code → you (main agent) fix, then re-run review.
   - REVISE on test code → forward issues to the appropriate test agent to fix.
   - PASS → proceed to step 3.

**Ownership rule**: you (main agent) only modify source code. Test code is owned by test agents — all test modifications go through them.
3. **Regression** — run build + type check + full test suite to catch breakage.
   - `pnpm build && pnpm tsc --noEmit && npx vitest run`
   - Any failure → fix and re-run. If fix touches source code, go back to step 1.
