# Policy: LLM-Generated Code & Pull Request Requirements

Purpose
- Ensure any code produced or modified with the assistance of an LLM includes required license information and explicit LLM attribution.
- Ensure pull requests (PRs) created from LLM-generated changes meet quality, linting, testing, documentation, and merge requirements.

Required for every created or modified source file
1. License header
   - Include the project license header (usually Apache-2.0) at the top of every source file.
   - Add an SPDX identifier where applicable: `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`.
   - Ensure a matching `LICENSE` file exists at the repository root.

2. LLM attribution
   - Add a short statement in each generated/modified file indicating it was produced or modified with the assistance of an LLM.
   - Example (file header):
     `This file was created or modified with the assistance of an AI (Large Language Model). Please review for correctness and security.`

Recommended file header template (adjust comment style per language)
```

Pre-PR requirements (must be completed before opening a PR)
- Linting: Run the repository's linters and fix all issues. Confirm the lint score is 10/10 (or the project's maximum scoring metric). Provide the exact command used.
- Tests: Run unit/integration tests and ensure they pass locally. Add tests for behavior changes introduced by the PR.
- Static analysis/type checks: Run tools like mypy, go vet, staticcheck, etc., and fix issues.
- Formatting: Run configured formatters (black, gofmt, prettier, etc.).
- Pre-commit hooks: Run and fix any pre-commit failures.
- CI: Ensure the branch builds and passes CI checks (run locally where possible or rely on CI after push).
- Merge conflicts: Rebase or merge the latest base branch and confirm there are no conflicts.
- Changelog/versioning: If user-facing behavior changed, update CHANGELOG.md or follow repository release practices.

Documentation requirements
- If the PR introduces or changes functionality, update relevant documentation:
  - README.md (usage, quick start)
  - docs/ pages or site content describing implementation/behavior
  - API docs, migration guides, and "future work" notes as applicable
- Add or update examples and quick-start snippets for changed behavior.

PR content and quality expectations
- Title: concise, descriptive, imperative mood.
- Description: link to related issue(s) if any; short summary; rationale; tests added; docs updated; backward-compatibility or migration notes.
- LLM involvement: include an explicit line listing files created/modified by the LLM and a short note about human review performed.
- Validation commands: list exact commands used to validate lint, tests, and formatting.
- Attach logs or screenshots if the change affects UI or developer UX.
- Commit messages: follow the repository's convention (e.g., Conventional Commits). Keep commits atomic and well-scoped.
