- Stop and ask the user when requirements are ambiguous.
- Never report unexecuted tests as passed.
- Report failed commands and incomplete work honestly.
- Do not run commit, push, merge, rebase, or force push without explicit user approval.
- Do not modify files outside the current task scope.
- Update `.ai-workflow/state.json` after a stage is completed.
