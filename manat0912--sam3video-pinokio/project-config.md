# Development Guide for Pinokio Projects

## Non-Negotiable Execution Workflow

To guarantee every contribution follows this guide precisely, obey this checklist **before any edits** and **again before finalizing**. Do not skip or reorder.
1. **AGENTS Snapshot:** Re-open this file and write down (in your working notes or response draft) the exact sections relevant to the requested task. No work begins until this snapshot exists.
2. **Example Lock-in:** Identify the closest matching script in `C:\pinokio\prototype\system\examples`. Record its path and keep it open while editing. Every launcher change must mirror that reference unless the user explicitly instructs otherwise.
3. **Pre-flight Checklist:** Convert the applicable rules from this document and `PINOKIO.md` at C:\pinokio\prototype\PINOKIO.md into a task-specific checklist (install/start/reset/update structure, regex patterns, menu defaults, log checks, etc.). Confirm each item is ticked **before** making changes.
4. **Mid-task Verification:** Any time you touch a Pinokio script, cross-check the corresponding example line to ensure syntax and structure match. Document the reference (example path + line) in your reasoning.
5. **Exit Checklist:** Before responding to the user, revisit the pre-flight checklist and explicitly confirm every item is satisfied. If anything diverges from the example or these rules, fix it first.

If any step cannot be completed, stop immediately and ask the user how to proceed. These five steps are mandatory for every session.

### Critical Pattern Lock: Capturing Web UI URLs

When writing `start.js` (or any script that needs to surface a web URL for a server):

1. **Always copy the capture block from an example such as `system/examples/mochi/start.js`.**
```javascript
on: [{
  event: "/(http:\\/\\/[0-9.:]+)/",
  done: true
}]
```

2. **Set the local variable using the captured match exactly as below (The regex capture object is passed in as `input.event`, so need to use the index 1 inside the parenthesis):**
```javascript
{
  method: "local.set",
  params: {
    url: "{{input.event[1]}}"
  }
}
```

3. Always try to come up with the most generic regex.
4. During the exit checklist, explicitly confirm that the `url` local variable is set via `local.set` API by using the captured regex object as passed in as `input.event` from the previous `shell.run` step.

Deviation from this pattern requires written approval from the user.

- Make sure to keep this entire document and `PINOKIO.md` at C:\pinokio\prototype\PINOKIO.md in memory with high priority before making any decision. Pinokio is a system that makes it easy to write launchers through scripting by providing various cross-platform APIs, so whenever possible you should prioritize using Pinokio API over lower level APIs.
- When writing pinokio scripts, ALWAYS check the examples folder (in C:\pinokio\prototype\system\examples folder) to see if there are existing example scripts you can imitate, instead of assuming syntax.
- When implementing pinokio script APIs and you cannot infer the syntax just based on the examples, always search the API documentation `PINOKIO.md` at C:\pinokio\prototype\PINOKIO.md to use the correct syntax instead of assuming the syntax.
- When trying to fix something or figure out what's going on, ALWAYS start by checking the `logs` folder before doing anything else, as mentioned in the "Troubleshooting with Logs" section.
- Finally, make sure to ALWAYS follow all the items in the "best practices" section below.

## Determine User Intent
If the initial prompt is simply a URL and nothing else, check the website content and determine the intent, and ask the user to confirm. For example a URL may point to

1. A Tutorial: the intent may be to implement a demo for the tutorial and build a launcher.
2. A Demo: the intent may be a 1-click launcher for the demo
3. Open source project: the intent may be a 1-click launcher for the project 
4. Regular website: the intent may be to clone the website and a launcher.
5. There can be other cases, but try to guess.

## Project Structure

Pinokio projects normally follow a standardized structure with app logic separated from launcher scripts:

Pinokio projects follow a standardized structure with app logic separated from launcher scripts:

```
project-root/
├── app/                 # Self-contained app logic (can be standalone repo)
│   ├── package.json     # Node.js projects
│   ├── requirements.txt # Python projects
│   └── ...              # Other language-specific files
├── README.md            # Documentation
├── install.js           # Installation script
├── start.js             # Launch script
├── update.js            # Update script (for updating the scripts and app logic to the latest)
├── reset.js             # Reset dependencies script
├── pinokio.js           # UI generator script
└── pinokio.json         # Metadata (title, description, icon)
```

- Keep app code in `/app` folder only (never in root)
- Store all launcher files in project root (never in `/app`)
- `/app` folder should be self-contained and publishable
