# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

**Testing:**
```bash
# Run all tests using pytest
uv run pytest

# Run individual test files  
uv run pytest tests/test_extractor.py
uv run pytest tests/test_languages.py
uv run pytest tests/test_models.py
uv run pytest tests/test_git_support.py

# Quick functional test of core MCP server
python test_new_mcp.py

# Test semantic search functionality (includes directory search tests)
python test_semantic_search.py
```

**Running the MCP Server:**
```bash
# Run as package with UV (recommended)
uv run mcp-server-code-extractor

# Run as Python module
uv run python -m code_extractor

# Test with MCP Inspector
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run mcp-server-code-extractor

# Example search_code_tool usage in MCP Inspector:

# Single file search:
# search_type: "function-calls"
# target: "get_file_content" 
# scope: "code_extractor/server.py"

# Directory search (searches all files in directory):
# search_type: "function-calls"
# target: "get_file_content"
# scope: "code_extractor"
# file_patterns: ["*.py"]
# max_results: 50

# Directory search with exclusions:
# search_type: "function-calls"
# target: "print"
# scope: "code_extractor"
# file_patterns: ["*.py"]
# exclude_patterns: ["test_*", "__pycache__/*"]

# For uvx usage (after publishing)
uvx mcp-server-code-extractor
```

**Development Dependencies:**
```bash
# Install development dependencies (testing, formatting, linting)
uv add --dev pytest black flake8 mypy
```

**Code Quality:**
```bash
# Format code with Black
uv run black .

# Lint with flake8
uv run flake8 .

# Type checking with mypy
uv run mypy .
```

## Version Management

- To bump the version use uv version --bump <patch|minor|major> commit (only the changes to pyproject.toml) push, and monitor the workflow run to verify it actually gets deployed.
- **IMPORTANT**: The deployment workflow is triggered by git tags, not pushes. After pushing version changes, create and push a tag: `git tag v<version> && git push origin v<version>`

## Architecture Overview

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides precise code extraction using tree-sitter parsing. The codebase has a **clean package structure**:

### Package Structure (`code_extractor/`)
- **MCP Server** (`server.py`) - FastMCP server with 5 extraction tools
- **Core Library** (`extractor.py`) - Query-driven extraction engine using tree-sitter
- **Data Models** (`models.py`) - Rich symbol representations with hierarchical relationships  
- **Language Support** (`languages.py`) - Detection and mapping for 30+ programming languages
- **Tree-sitter Queries** (`queries/`) - Language-specific syntax parsing patterns
- **File Reading** (`file_reader.py`) - Unified file reading with VCS and URL support
- **URL Fetching** (`url_fetcher.py`) - HTTP fetching with caching and error handling
- **VCS Support** (`vcs/`) - Pluggable version control system abstraction
- **Entry Points** (`__main__.py`) - Module execution support

### Entry Points
- **Console Script**: `mcp-server-code-extractor` - Direct execution via uvx/pip
- **Module Execution**: `python -m code_extractor` - Run as Python module
- **Package Import**: `from code_extractor import CodeExtractor` - Library usage

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Method vs Function Classification:**
The core innovation is distinguishing methods (functions inside classes) from top-level functions using tree-sitter query patterns. This solves the context problem where traditional parsers can't determine if a function is a class method without understanding the containment hierarchy.

**Two-Layer Symbol Processing:**
1. **Query capture phase**: Tree-sitter queries extract syntax nodes with semantic labels
2. **Symbol building phase**: Raw captures are processed into rich `CodeSymbol` objects with hierarchical relationships

**Clean MCP Interface:**
The server uses FastMCP for simple tool registration and exposes 5 core extraction tools with consistent function signatures and error handling.

**Pluggable VCS Architecture:**
The codebase includes a pluggable VCS abstraction layer (`code_extractor/vcs/`) that enables git revision support while maintaining extensibility for future version control systems. All file reading is centralized through `file_reader.py` which automatically detects git repositories and delegates to the appropriate VCS provider.

## Working with Tree-Sitter Queries

Tree-sitter queries are stored in `code_extractor/queries/` and use the S-expression format:

```scheme
; Extract methods inside classes
(class_definition
  body: (block
    (function_definition
      name: (identifier) @method.name
      parameters: (parameters) @method.parameters) @method.definition))
```

**Query Structure:**
- Capture names use `category.type` format (e.g., `method.name`, `function.definition`)
- The extractor groups captures by their definition nodes to build complete symbols
- Parent-child relationships are determined by byte range containment

## Language Support

New languages require:
1. Adding language mapping in `code_extractor/languages.py`
