# Code Organization

## Initialization Flow

1. Event listener setup on `DOMContentLoaded`
2. `initSidebar()` called
   - Chrome API calls to get current tabs and groups
   - Create spaces based on existing tab groups or create default space
   - Set up DOM elements and event handlers
3. Setup event listeners for Chrome tab events

## Component Structure

The code is organized around the concept of spaces and tabs:

- Space management functions
- Tab management functions 
- Event handlers
- UI interaction handlers
- Helper functions

## State Persistence

State is persisted in two ways:

1. Chrome bookmarks API for persistent storage
   - Each space has its own folder
   - Bookmarked tabs are stored in these folders
   
2. Chrome storage API for extension state
   - `saveSpaces()` function saves to `chrome.storage.local`
   - Spaces array contains the current state

## Event Flow

1. User interacts with UI (clicks, drags tabs)
2. Event handlers update the DOM
3. Chrome API calls update the browser state
4. `saveSpaces()` persists the updated state
