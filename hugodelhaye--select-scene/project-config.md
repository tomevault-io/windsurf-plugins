# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository analyzes Super Mario Bros gameplay data from multiple sources (human players, imitation learning models, and PPO agents) to select scenes based on learning metrics. The pipeline processes gameplay clips, extracts variables, computes learning metrics, and identifies scenes showing interesting learning patterns across different subject types.

## Environment Setup

This project uses [airoh](https://github.com/airoh-pipeline/airoh), a lightweight Python task library for reproducible research workflows. All tasks are managed through the `invoke` framework.

```bash
# Install dependencies (includes airoh)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or use the airoh setup task
invoke setup

# (Optional) Install Jupyter kernel
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name .scene_selection_env --display-name "Python (scene_selection)"
```

The virtual environment is located in `env/` (committed to repo).

### Task Automation with Airoh

List all available tasks:
```bash
invoke --list
```

The project configuration is defined in `invoke.yaml` and tasks are defined in `tasks.py`.

## Data Pipeline Architecture

The analysis follows a multi-stage pipeline that transforms raw gameplay data into scene selection metrics:

### 1. Data Sources (`sourcedata/`)
- `clips_metadata_from_im.parquet`: Metadata from imitation learning clips
- `clips_metadata_with_patterns.parquet`: Metadata from human/PPO clips
- `df_variables_hum.parquet`, `df_variables_ppo.parquet`: Frame-by-frame player position variables
- `df_metrics.parquet`: Final computed metrics (output of pipeline)

### 2. Core Processing Scripts (`code/`)

**`make_df_metrics.py`** - Main pipeline orchestrator:
- Loads and merges metadata from multiple sources (human, imitation, PPO)
- Combines position variables across all subjects
- Filters scenes to only those completed by all 5 human subjects
- Aggregates per-scene statistics (clear rate, speed, MAD)
- Computes delta metrics showing learning progress using `utils.compute_deltas_for_group()`
- Outputs `sourcedata/df_metrics.parquet`

**`create_df_variables.py`** - Extracts PPO variables:
- Reads JSON files containing frame-by-frame player position data
- Parses file paths to extract world, level, scene, clip codes
- Extracts `player_x_posHi`, `player_x_posLo`, `player_y_pos` from JSONs
- Outputs `sourcedata/ppo_clips_variables.parquet`

**`utils.py`** - Core metric computation:
- `compute_deltas_for_group()`: Computes learning deltas for a subject-scene group
  - Handles phase ordering differently for imitation models vs humans
  - Special case for `im_sub-02` phase ordering
  - Computes total delta (max - min) across learning phases for cleared rate, speed, and MAD
- `compute_delta_tot()`: Calculates delta between min/max checkpoints for a metric
- `mad()`: Median Absolute Deviation calculation
- `get_mads()`: Aggregates MAD of y-position for each x-position (trajectory variability)

**`dashboard.py`** - Core visualization functions (used by both Jupyter and Dash):
- `make_dashboard()`: Creates complete Plotly dashboard for a scene
- `get_phase_configurations()`: Returns phase orders, colors, and mappings for all subject types
- `load_scene_image()`, `get_traces()`, `concat_traces()`: Image loading and processing
- `add_*_plot()`: Individual plot creation functions (MAD, clearance, speed, clip count)
- `run_dashboard()`: Legacy Jupyter widgets interface

**`dash_app.py`** - Modern web dashboard application:
- `create_app()`: Creates Dash web application with Bootstrap styling
- `run_server()`: Launches local web server for interactive exploration
- Callbacks for dynamic level/scene selection
- Better performance and UX than Jupyter widgets

**`export_dashboard.py`** - HTML export for sharing:
- `prepare_data_for_export()`: Prepares minimal data for client-side rendering
- `image_to_base64()`: Converts images to base64 for embedding
- `create_lightweight_html()`: Creates single HTML file with all scenes
- Embeds data and configuration, generates figures client-side using Plotly.js
- Command-line interface: `--data` (input parquet) and `--output` (output HTML file)

### 3. Subject Types

The codebase distinguishes three subject types:
- **`hum`**: Human players (`sub-01` through `sub-06`)
- **`imi`**: Imitation learning models (`im_sub-01`, etc.) with checkpoint-based phases
- **`ppo`**: PPO reinforcement learning agent with episode-based phases

### 4. Learning Phases

**Human subjects**: `Early discovery`, `Late discovery`, `Early practice`, `Late practice`

**Imitation models**: Checkpoint-based (e.g., `sub-01_epoch=0-step=500`, `sub-01_epoch=0-step=2000`)
- First phase always ends with `=500`
- Special ordering exception for `im_sub-02` (moves `epoch=0-step=10000` to end)

**PPO agent**: Episode-based (e.g., `ep-xxx`)

### 5. Key Metrics

- **`delta_clr_tot`**: Total change in clear rate (success) from min to max checkpoint
- **`delta_spd_tot`**: Total change in average speed across learning
- **`delta_MAD_tot`**: Total change in trajectory variability (MAD of y-position per x-position)

## Running Scripts

All Python scripts follow standard conventions with `if __name__ == "__main__"` blocks. They can be run directly or via airoh tasks:

```bash
# Generate metrics from raw data (recommended: use airoh task)
invoke process-data
# Or directly: python code/make_df_metrics.py

# Extract PPO variables from JSON files
invoke process-ppo-variables
# Or directly: python code/create_df_variables.py

# Convert between CSV and Parquet formats
invoke convert-csv-to-parquet
invoke convert-parquet-to-csv
# Or directly:
# python code/convert_csv2parquet.py
# python code/parquet_2_csv.py

# Display dataset statistics
invoke stats

# List all available scenes
invoke list-scenes
```

## Interactive Dashboard

The project includes a modern web-based dashboard for exploring learning metrics:

### Option 1: Dash Web Application (Recommended)

**Run locally** with better performance and UX:
```bash
# Using airoh task (recommended)
invoke dashboard

# Or directly
python run_dashboard.py

# Opens at http://localhost:8050
```

Features:
- Fast, responsive interface with Bootstrap styling
- Real-time scene/level selection
- Better performance than Jupyter widgets
- Professional-looking visualizations

### Option 2: Export to HTML (For Sharing)

**Create a standalone HTML file** that anyone can open in a browser (no Python required):

```bash
# Using airoh task (recommended)
invoke export-html

# Or directly using Python script
python export_dashboard.py --output dashboard.html
```

This creates:
- Single interactive HTML file (~50-60MB) containing all scenes
- Fully interactive Plotly visualizations with level/scene navigation
- Clickable thumbnails for scene selection
- All images embedded as base64
- No server needed - just open in browser
- Perfect for sharing with collaborators

**Note**: The `--level` and `--scene` filtering options mentioned in some documentation are not yet implemented. Currently, all scenes are exported to a single comprehensive HTML file.

### Option 3: Jupyter Widgets (Legacy)

Available in `notebook/figure_exploration.ipynb` for in-notebook exploration (slower).

## Analysis Workflow

Primary analysis is in `notebook/select_scene.ipynb`:
1. Load `df_metrics.parquet`
2. Filter out scenes with <10 clips per phase for human subjects
3. Group by scene and subject type, compute mean deltas
4. Select top/bottom N scenes for each metric and subject type
5. Identify scenes appearing in multiple subject types (intersection analysis)

## Data Format Conversions

- `convert_csv2parquet.py`: CSV → Parquet (forces string dtype to avoid type guessing issues)
- `parquet_2_csv.py`: Parquet → CSV using pyarrow for proper type handling

## Code Organization

All scripts are organized into small, focused functions with clear docstrings:
- Each script has a `main()` function that orchestrates the pipeline
- Utility functions in `utils.py` handle metric computations
- Functions are designed to be readable and maintainable

## Important Notes

- Position data uses two bytes: `player_x_pos = player_x_posHi * 255 + player_x_posLo`
- Scene filtering ensures all 5 human subjects completed the scene
- The `df_metrics` structure has one row per (subject, learning_phase, scene_full_name) combination
- MAD metrics are only available for scenes with position variable data (not all scenes)
