# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/` contains the Rust CLI, database, remote update logic, server, and
  indexer (feature-gated). See `src/index/` for indexer internals and
  `src/server/` for the HTTP API.
- `tests/` holds integration tests (notably `tests/integration.rs`).
- `frontend/` contains the static HTML/CSS/JS for the web UI served by
  `nxv serve`.
- `docs/` hosts implementation specs and design notes.
- `scripts/` includes operational scripts (e.g., cache publishing).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `nix develop` enters the Nix dev shell with the Rust toolchain.
- `cargo build` builds the debug CLI; `cargo build --features indexer` enables
  indexer support.
- `cargo test` runs the default test suite; `cargo test --features indexer`
  includes indexer tests.
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` runs linting with warnings treated as errors.
- `cargo fmt` formats Rust code.
- `nix flake check` runs the full Nix CI checks.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Rust is formatted with rustfmt defaults (4-space indentation).
- Naming follows Rust conventions: `snake_case` for modules and functions,
  `CamelCase` for types, and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` before submitting changes.

## Testing Guidelines

- Unit tests live alongside code in `src/` modules using `#[test]`.
- Integration tests are in `tests/integration.rs` and use `assert_cmd` and
  `tempfile`.
- Some indexer tests require `nix` and are marked `#[ignore]`; run them
  explicitly when needed.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commit messages are short, imperative, and title-style (e.g., "Fix CI
  workflow").
- PRs should include: a clear description, linked issue (if any), and the test
  commands run.
- Include screenshots or recordings for UI changes in `frontend/`.

## Configuration & Data Paths

- Key environment variables: `NXV_DB_PATH`, `NXV_API_URL`, `NXV_MANIFEST_URL`.
- Default data locations are platform-specific (see `CLAUDE.md` and
  `README.md`).

## Agent Notes

- For deeper architecture and feature details, read `CLAUDE.md`.
