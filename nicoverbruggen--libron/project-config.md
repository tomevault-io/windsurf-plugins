# Agent Instructions

- Use the `fntbld-oci` container for build-related tasks instead of native host tooling. This container has access to Python with `fonttools`, and also FontForge.
- Always validate that the build script works correctly when applying changes.
- Preferred command from the repository root:
  `podman run --rm -v "$PWD":/work -w /work ghcr.io/nicoverbruggen/fntbld-oci:latest python3 build.py`
- When creating a new release, bump `VERSION` in the repository's root first.
