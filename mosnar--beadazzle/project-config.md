# Beadazzle Agent Notes

Beadazzle is a SwiftPM native macOS app. Prefer small, focused SwiftUI files and keep the current sidebar-list-detail desktop structure.

## Build and Run

- Build with `swift build`, test with `swift test`.
- Tests that need `UserDefaults` call `makeIsolatedUserDefaults()`, never `UserDefaults(suiteName:)` directly. `removePersistentDomain(forName:)` empties a suite but leaves its plist in `~/Library/Preferences`; the helper's sweeps are what keep a run from leaving files behind.
- Launch with `./script/build_and_run.sh`; verify launch with `./script/build_and_run.sh --verify`.
- The Codex Run action points at `./script/build_and_run.sh`.

## Xcode MCP and Warnings

- When the user mentions Xcode warnings or asks to use Xcode, use the Xcode MCP server first.
- If the MCP asks for a tab identifier, call an Xcode MCP tool and use the open Beadazzle workspace tab it reports.
- Use `BuildProject` to reproduce Xcode build diagnostics, then `GetBuildLog` with `severity: "warning"` to confirm the build log is warning-free.
- Use `XcodeListNavigatorIssues` with `severity: "warning"` to inspect warnings visible in Xcode's Issue Navigator.
- For warnings tied to specific files, use `XcodeRefreshCodeIssuesInFile` on the affected source files after edits.
- Do not stop at a successful shell build when Xcode reported warnings; verify through Xcode MCP that there are no current warnings or explain any stale runtime entries that remain in the navigator.

## Changelog

- Record user-facing changes in `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` as part of the work that makes them — new features, behavior changes, notable fixes. Skip internal-only churn (refactors, test-only edits, CI plumbing) that a user would never notice.
- Write entries for users of the app, not as commit summaries. The release workflow reads the tag's section for both the GitHub release notes and the in-app Sparkle update dialog, and a release fails if its section is missing. See `docs/AUTO_UPDATES.md`.

## Project Boundaries

- Do not edit generated output in `.build/`, `.swiftpm/`, or `dist/`.
- Keep `script/build_and_run.sh` as the single local build/run entrypoint.
- Keep `.codex/environments/environment.toml` separate from app source.
- Use SwiftUI first. Use AppKit interop only for narrow platform edges such as panels or window behavior.

## Beads Data Model

- Only current Dolt-backed projects are supported, in embedded, server, or shared-server mode. Legacy SQLite (`.beads/beads.db`) projects are intentionally unsupported and there is no SQLite read path left in the app.
- Ask `bd context --json` for the effective tracker directory before reading, so worktree redirects and explicitly routed `.beads` paths stay on the same source `bd` writes.
- Read issues from the JSONL snapshot in that directory (`issues.jsonl`, `beads.jsonl`, or `beads.base.jsonl`).
- Beadazzle produces that snapshot itself by running `bd export` — when a project opens with no snapshot, after mutations, and on manual refresh — so users do not need `bd` auto-export configured.
- Combined Sync runs `bd dolt pull`, then `bd dolt push` when pull succeeds, and finally exports and reloads the readable snapshot. Pull also reconciles the snapshot; Push does not need to reload it.
- Lightweight remote-change checks are not sync: for eligible embedded projects they read the Git-backed remote's `refs/dolt/data` without pulling database objects. Automatic checks require an active scene, the app preference, a compatible remote, and a machine-local checkpoint established by a successful Beadazzle remote action.
- Treat no-remote, unsupported-remote, server/shared-server, and contributor-routed projects as valid states. Follow the effective `bd context`; do not invent a fallback remote or tracker path.
- Do not write directly to Beads internals unless the user explicitly asks for a low-level repair.
- Route creates, updates, deletes, close actions, bulk changes, and dependency changes through the `bd` CLI.

See `docs/BEADS_SYNC.md` for the Git-versus-Dolt model, team setup, tracked and ignored files, hook semantics, and Beadazzle reconciliation behavior.

## UI Direction

- Preserve native macOS source-list behavior in the sidebar.
- Keep filters and list-specific controls together in the window toolbar while the issue list is visible.
- Favor compact, stable metadata over wrapped badges or card-heavy layouts.
- Keep selection changes and search responsive; avoid disk reads on simple navigation.
