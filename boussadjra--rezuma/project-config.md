# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev            # Vite dev server
pnpm build          # vue-tsc --noEmit && vite build  (type-check is part of the build)
pnpm preview        # serve the production build
pnpm preview:cf     # serve it the way Cloudflare will (wrangler dev)
pnpm deploy         # build + wrangler deploy
pnpm fonts          # re-download the vendored TTFs into src/assets/fonts/
pnpm verify:pdf     # generate PDFs and assert the text extracts back out
```

pnpm only (`packageManager` is pinned; `pnpm-workspace.yaml` allowlists build scripts wrangler needs). Node >= 20.19.

There is no unit-test runner and no linter. The only automated check besides `vue-tsc` is `pnpm verify:pdf`, which is the project's real test suite — it runs nine cases across three languages, two themes and four layouts, and exits non-zero on any miss. To narrow it, edit the `cases` array in `scripts/verify-pdf.mjs`; there is no filter flag. Run it after any change to `src/services/pdf/**`, `src/config/themes.ts`, `src/config/layouts.ts`, the vendored fonts, or the jsPDF stub aliases in `vite.config.ts`.

To see the app rendered without a browser extension, there is a Playwright Chromium at `~/AppData/Local/ms-playwright/chromium-*/chrome-win64/chrome.exe`: start `pnpm dev --port 5199`, then `chrome.exe --headless=new --disable-gpu --window-size=1700,1400 --virtual-time-budget=8000 --screenshot=out.png http://localhost:5199/app`. Language and layout are session state with no URL parameter, so reaching a specific combination means temporarily editing `DEFAULT_LANG` / `DEFAULT_LAYOUT`.

## What this is

Rezuma: a zero-backend, single-page Vue 3 app that edits a resume, runs live ATS checks on it, and exports a real vector PDF. No server, no account, no network at runtime. Read `PRODUCT.md` before changing anything user-facing — it defines the two registers (`/` is brand, `/app` is product), the anti-references (commercial resume-builder patterns), and the accessibility floor (WCAG 2.2 AA, AAA contrast where achievable).

## Architecture

`@/` resolves to `src/`. Files are grouped by role, not by feature.

**Three layers of state, deliberately separate:**

1. `useResume` (`src/composables/useResume.ts`) — the document. Module-level singleton, not a per-component store. It holds *every* language's document simultaneously, keyed off `LOCALES`; the active locale from `src/i18n` decides which one is on screen. Persists to `localStorage['my-resume:v1']` as `{ en, fr, ar }`. Undo/redo is per-language JSON snapshots with a 600 ms idle coalescing window, so a run of keystrokes becomes one step. The editor binds to the reactive object *directly* — never replace or re-clone the graph while typing, or the caret jumps mid-word.
2. `useTheme` (`src/composables/useTheme.ts`) — the *document* look **and** its layout. Nine styles in `src/config/themes.ts` and four layouts in `src/config/layouts.ts`, both pushed onto `<html>` as CSS custom properties. Document tokens are always paper: no dark mode, ever. This composable is also where the document's font family becomes direction-aware — in Arabic it asks `familyForTheme` for the face the exporter will embed, rather than re-deriving it, so the preview and the PDF cannot drift.
3. `useAppearance` (`src/composables/useAppearance.ts`) — the *interface* light/dark. `data-theme` on `<html>` always holds a resolved `'light' | 'dark'` (never `'system'`); the preference lives in `localStorage['my-resume:appearance']`. An inline script in `index.html` resolves it before first paint — **it and `useAppearance.ts` must agree on the storage key and on writing a resolved value**, or dark-mode readers get a white flash.

`src/styles/variables.css` documents the three token systems (chrome, app surface, document) and why they don't share a scheme. Don't blur the app/document line — it's design principle #3 in PRODUCT.md.

**PDF export (`src/services/pdf/`)** typesets the document with jsPDF; it does *not* rasterise the preview.

- `fonts.ts` — Source Serif 4 / Source Sans 3, plus Noto Naskh Arabic / Noto Sans Arabic, as raw TTF imported via `?url` and fetched at export time (kept out of the initial bundle). `times`/`helvetica` are jsPDF base-14 and carry no Arabic, which is why `familyForTheme(theme, lang)` takes the language. `EMBEDDED[].files` is deliberately partial — the Arabic faces have no italic, and `styleFor()` folds the gap rather than registering the same 180 KB file twice. Both live here so the toolbar can call them without pulling jsPDF into the initial chunk.
- `layout.ts` — two-pass typesetter. Everything is measured into `Group`s of `Item`s first, then `paginate()` places them. Groups carry `atomic` / `keepWithNext` / `orphans` / `widows`, which is what keeps a heading with its first entry and a job title with its dates. `paginate()` takes an array of `Flow`s: each restarts at page 1 with its own cursor, sharing the page sequence, which is how the sidebar layout gets a second column. **Flow order is the extracted text order** — the flow with the name and work history goes first regardless of which side it prints on.
