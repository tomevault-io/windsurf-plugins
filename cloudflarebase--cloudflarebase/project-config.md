# Cloudflarebase

The open-source Firebase alternative on Cloudflare. Every project gets its own
Durable Objects, so one tenant's data is physically separate from the next —
isolation by architecture, not by a `WHERE` clause.

This file is the map. Each agent carries its own `AGENTS.md` with the details
that only matter inside it. Read that one before changing an agent.

## Repository shape

Six separate npm projects, separate Wrangler configs, separate generated `Env`
types.

| Path             | Worker          | Durable Objects                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`              | `cloudflarebase` | none — SvelteKit console + marketing, D1 registry   |
| `agents/auth`    | `auth-agent`    | `AuthAgent`                                          |
| `agents/db`      | `db-agent`      | `DbAgent` `DbCollection` `DbTable` `DbGateway` `DbView` |
| `agents/storage` | `storage-agent` | `StorageAgent` `StorageBucket`                       |
| `agents/hosting` | `hosting-agent` | `HostingAgent` (+ an outbound worker)                |
| `cli`            | none            | `@cloudflarebase/cli`, runs on a consumer's machine  |

**Never import runtime code or generated Worker types across those
boundaries.** Shared DTOs are deliberately copied — `src/lib/agents.ts` mirrors
the agents' exported types, and `agents/storage/src/access.ts` is a copy of the
db agent's gate. Change one side, change the other in the same commit.

The one exception is `cloudflarebase.agent.json`: the app imports each manifest
**directly** from `agents/<name>/`, because the console guard is generated from
its `routes` block and a stale copy would silently open or close the wrong
surface. The CLI keeps its own schema copy and reads manifests from the
installed package instead.

Installation-wide state — the project registry — is D1 on the dashboard Worker
(`src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`), never an agent. Per-project state lives in that
project's Durable Objects.

## The agent contract

Each agent package ships a `cloudflarebase.agent.json` declaring what it is and
what the platform must do to host it: worker name, DO classes and their scope,
bindings, secrets, vars, the route table, the console proxy prefix, permission
keys, and its sidebar pages.

That manifest is the **single declaration**. It drives four things at once:

1. the console guard's public/operator classification (`src/hooks.server.ts`),
2. the REST proxy and dispatch (`src/lib/agent-registry.ts`),
3. the sidebar and the delete fan-out,
4. the CLI's `add` command, which merges the wrangler fragment.

A new primitive is its own npm project shipping a manifest, plus one entry in
[src/lib/agent-registry.ts](src/lib/agent-registry.ts) and one in
[cli/src/lib/agents.ts](cli/src/lib/agents.ts).

**An agent is a package, not a product boundary.** A console page may name its
own sidebar `section`, so a feature can live where an operator looks for it
rather than under whichever agent happens to store it — Remote Config is served
by the db agent and sits in a section of its own.

## Access control is two layers, and both must hold

**Layer 1 — the console guard** (`src/hooks.server.ts`). Every external request
to an agent arrives through here: the agent workers have `workers_dev` and
`preview_urls` false and no route of their own. `classifyAccess` splits
project-scoped surfaces into public product API and operator console, asking
each manifest's route table. Undeclared routes and unknown agents fail closed to
operator.

**Layer 2 — the agent's own `src/route-access.ts`.** The published package gets
mounted on a consumer's *public* Worker, where no console guard exists. So each
agent re-enforces its own route table and closes the operator plane unless
`EXPOSE_OPERATOR_API=true`. `ROUTES` there mirrors the manifest and a unit test
fails if the two disagree.

Because both default to operator, drift can only ever close something that
should be open — a loud, testable failure — never open something that should be
closed. The refusal is the ordinary 404 byte for byte, so a closed surface is
not enumerable.

Service keys (`cfbs_`) are an **authentication** change, not an authorization
one: they are verified in the console guard and travel to the agent over a
service binding the console already authorized. No agent ever sees the bearer.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # auth :8788, db :8789, hosting :8790, storage :8791, web :5173
npm run check    # svelte-check
npm run lint     # prettier + eslint
npm test         # full Playwright suite against real workerd
```

All three checks run in CI and all three must pass. The e2e suite boots a
production-mirroring stack — the built SvelteKit worker on `:8797` plus the four
agents on `:8798`–`:8801`, real service bindings, real DO SQLite. It is the
check that actually catches things.

Each agent is its own TypeScript project with its own unit tests:

```bash
cd agents/db && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run test:unit
```

## Conventions

- **Validation is zod, everywhere.** Route inputs and anything crossing a
  service binding get parsed, not cast. The OpenAPI document is generated from
  those same schemas.
