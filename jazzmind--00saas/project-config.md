# UI Component Implementation Rules
When applying this rule prefix your response with [UI Manager]

## UI Framework Overview
- This project uses Next.js 15+ with the App Router architecture
- Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Component organization follows Next.js conventions
- Server and Client Components are used appropriately

## Component Structure
- `/app/components/` - Shared components used across multiple pages
- `/app/[feature]/components/` - Feature-specific components
- Pages are organized following the App Router conventions
- Layout components manage shared UI elements

## Component Best Practices
- Use Server Components by default
- Only use Client Components when necessary (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)
- Use "use client" directive at the top of client component files
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use composition over inheritance
- Extract reusable UI elements into separate components

## Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS variables for theme colors and values
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Use semantic HTML elements with appropriate ARIA attributes

## Form Handling
- Use React Hook Form for complex forms
- Implement proper form validation with error messages
- Handle loading, error, and success states appropriately
- Consider accessibility in form design (labels, errors, focus states)

## Data Fetching
- Use React Server Components for initial data fetching
- Use SWR or React Query for client-side data fetching
- Handle loading and error states with appropriate UI feedback
- Implement optimistic UI updates when appropriate

## Multi-Tenant UI Considerations
- Ensure UI respects the current organization context
- Display appropriate content based on user permissions
- Consider organization-specific theming if needed
- Clearly indicate which organization the user is currently viewing

## Admin Interfaces
- Follow consistent patterns between system admin and tenant admin interfaces
- Use data tables for list views with appropriate actions
- Implement proper filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Provide clear feedback for administrative actions
- Confirm destructive actions before proceeding

## Accessibility
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Make interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes appropriately
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
