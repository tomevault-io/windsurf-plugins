<!-- ai-memory:start -->
## Long-term memory (ai-memory)

This project uses [ai-memory](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-memory)
for cross-session continuity.

**Default to the current project — always.** Every ai-memory tool
auto-scopes to the project resolved from your session's working
directory. **Do NOT pass `project`, `workspace`, or `cwd` arguments unless the user
explicitly references a *different* project by name** (e.g. "what did we
decide in the `other-app` project?"). Phrases like "this project",
"here", "we", "our work", "where did we leave off" all mean the *current*
project — call the tool with no scoping args. If the user asks about a
handoff and the SessionStart auto-fetched block is already in your
context, just answer from it; do not re-call the tool to "find it again"
in another project.

**Lifecycle hooks already capture every prompt + tool call
automatically.** You never need to manually write routine notes; the
SessionStart hook auto-fetches pending handoffs, and on session end
ai-memory writes a session-summary page and a handoff.
LLM consolidation (compiling observations into topical wiki pages) runs
on PreCompact, on demand via `memory_consolidate`, and at session end
only when the server sets `AI_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE_ON_SESSION_END`. Only
write a durable wiki page when the user explicitly asks to remember or
annotate something permanently.

### When to reach for each tool

The user can express any of the intents below in plain English —
match the intent to the tool. They do not need to name the tool.

| User says / situation | Tool |
|---|---|
| "have we discussed X?" / "search memory for Y" / before proposing architecture | `memory_query` (current project; `scopes` for named siblings; `global=true` to search every project) |
| "what's been going on" / "show recent activity" (light) | `memory_recent` |
| "is ai-memory healthy?" / "how big is the wiki?" | `memory_status` |
| "give me the stats" / structured snapshot for the agent to consume | `memory_briefing` (read-only; never creates handoffs) |
| "catch me up" / "I've been away" / "what's important right now?" / open-ended exploration | `memory_explore` |
| "where did we leave off?" — and you see a `📥 ai-memory: pending handoff` block in your context | already done — answer from that block; do NOT re-call `memory_handoff_accept` |
| "where did we leave off?" — and no such block is visible | `memory_handoff_accept` (rare; the SessionStart hook usually got there first; pass `workspace` + `project` together only for a named sibling workspace/project) |
| "save context for the next session" / wrapping up / ending this session | `memory_handoff_begin` (session-end only; do **not** use for status/briefing; single-use handoff; terse summary; put detail in `open_questions` + `next_steps` bullets; pass `workspace` + `project` together only for a named sibling workspace/project) |
| "discard that handoff" / "I created a handoff by mistake" | `memory_handoff_cancel` (requires exact `handoff_id` from `memory_handoff_begin`; marks it expired before the next session sees it) |
| "consolidate this session" / "compile what we learned" (also runs on PreCompact; at session end only if `AI_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE_ON_SESSION_END` is set) | `memory_consolidate` |
| "what did we learn from this session?" / "what memory should we add?" / explicit wrap-up learning review | `memory_auto_improve` (manual learning review for a completed session; omit `session_id` for latest completed session; the server also schedules background review for newly completed sessions when configured) |
| "remember this permanently" / "save a note" / "add an annotation" / durable project knowledge | `memory_write_page` (write a wiki page; do **not** use handoff for permanent notes; put the title as a `# H1` on the first line of `body` and omit the `title` arg — ai-memory derives it from the H1) |
| "read the page about X" / "show me the full content of Y" / "open the page on Z" | `memory_read_page` (full body; pass a query to search or `path` for a direct lookup; pass `workspace` + `project` together only for a named sibling workspace/project) |
| "delete the page X" / "remove that note" | `memory_delete_page` (by exact `path`; idempotent; pass `workspace` + `project` together only for a named sibling workspace/project) |
| "audit the wiki" / "find contradictions" / "what rules should we add?" | `memory_lint` |
| "prune old pages" / "memory cleanup" | `memory_forget_sweep` |

`memory_explore` is the right default for the "I want to know what's
going on" use case — it returns a prose digest whose verbosity
scales automatically to how long it's been since the last activity
(< 1 h → one line; > 30 days → full catchup).

### When the current project comes up empty — broaden the search

`memory_query` searches only the **current** project by default. If a
search comes back empty or thin, the knowledge may live in a **sibling
project** — shared `infra`, `ops`, or a related app. Don't conclude
"we never recorded it" after a single project misses; broaden instead:

- **Know which projects to check?** Re-run with explicit `scopes`, e.g.
  `scopes: [{ "workspace": "default", "project": "infra" }]`.
- **Don't know where it lives?** Pass `global=true` to search every
