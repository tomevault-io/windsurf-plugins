# expo-ai-kit, agent guide

This file contains repository-specific working rules. Public API usage belongs in `README.md`,
release history in `CHANGELOG.md`, and implementation details in source comments and tests. Do not
duplicate those records here.

`expo-ai-kit` provides on-device AI for Expo and React Native as a set of capabilities, currently
LLM (chat, structured output, tool calling), speech-to-text, vision (background removal, image
labels, OCR), and embeddings,
across Apple Foundation Models, Apple SpeechAnalyzer, Apple Vision, ML Kit (Prompt API, GenAI Speech
Recognition, Vision), and downloadable or custom LiteRT-LM models on iOS and Android. Developer-facing
material (README, docs site, npm metadata, `llms.txt`) presents the capabilities in that order and
never hard-codes their count; a new capability gets its own group in each of those places.

## Build, test, and publish

- `npm run build`, compile `src/` to `build/`.
- `npm test`, run Jest tests. Pure TypeScript logic is tested directly; behavior that reaches the
  native module is tested with `jest.mock('../ExpoAiKitModule')` and a mocked `react-native`
  (see `src/__tests__/inference.test.ts`). Real native behavior is verified by CI platform builds
  and on-device gates.
- `npm run lint`, run ESLint using the flat config in `eslint.config.js`.
- CI routes by changed path: `docs/`-only changes run the docs checks; other changes run Node tests and
  the Android/Kotlin and iOS/Swift builds; mixed changes run both. Native changes are not verified by
  the Node job alone.
- The tracked source under `example/` is the native CI fixture. Its generated `ios/`, `android/`,
  `.expo/`, and `node_modules/` directories are disposable and must remain untracked.
- Version, publish, tag, or push only when explicitly requested. The publish scripts require a clean
  tree and run `npm version` followed by `npm publish`; `prepublishOnly` performs the one-shot build.
  Do not prepend `npm run build`, because `expo-module build` may enter watch mode in an interactive
  terminal. Push version tags with `git push --follow-tags` only when requested.

## Architecture contracts

These describe the current public architecture, not immutable doctrine. Change one deliberately, with
the corresponding API decision, implementation, tests, and documentation, rather than bypassing it as
a side effect of unrelated work.

- **Zero runtime dependencies.** Keep `package.json#dependencies` empty. Development and optional peer
  dependencies do not change this rule.
- **Single-flight generation.** `sendMessage` and `streamMessage` share one generation guard and reject
  overlap with `INFERENCE_BUSY`. Any higher-level generation API must use that guarded path or the same
  guard; do not introduce an uncoordinated native inference route.
- **Existing message APIs are stateless.** Callers pass the complete history to every `sendMessage` or
  `streamMessage` call, so LiteRT-LM creates a fresh native conversation for each call. Reusing a global
  conversation here would duplicate history and mix unrelated or branched calls. Conversation and
  KV-cache reuse should be introduced through an explicit stateful-session API that owns an isolated
  lifecycle and accepts incremental turns.
- **Native errors are typed across the bridge.** Native failures use `CODE:modelId:reason`; JS parses
  them into `ModelError`. Keep native codes, `parseNativeErrorMessage`, and the `ModelErrorCode` union
  synchronized, including wrapped Expo exceptions.
- **Model activation is centralized.** `setModel` validates and activates built-in, downloadable, and
  custom models. Native code routes built-ins versus LiteRT-LM models at call time; generation should
  not maintain a second model-validity policy.
- **Embeddings are independent of generation.** `embed()` does not use the generation single-flight
  guard and never downloads a model implicitly. Persisted vectors are compatible only when their model
  identities match exactly.
- **Speech is opt-in and independent.** The config plugin's `speech` flag compiles the Android speech
  backend (reflection-resolved, like embeddings) and adds microphone permissions; without it, speech
  APIs throw `SPEECH_NOT_ENABLED`. Speech has its own single-flight (`SPEECH_BUSY`) and never touches
  the generation guard. Native layers forward raw engine updates (with an `error` event channel); the
  JS layer assembles transcripts. Android's engine ingests non-mic audio at real-time rate by
  contract and requires `RECORD_AUDIO` even for file input.
- **Vision is opt-in on Android and independent.** The config plugin's `vision` flag compiles the
  Android ML Kit vision backend (reflection-resolved, like embeddings and speech) and adds no
  permissions; without it, Android vision APIs throw `VISION_NOT_ENABLED` and availability reports
  `not-enabled`. iOS always compiles the Vision client. `prepareVision()` is the only vision call
  that downloads (Google Play services models); `removeBackground`/`recognizeText` throw
  `MODEL_NOT_DOWNLOADED` instead of downloading. Vision never holds the generation or speech
  guards. Cutouts are written to the app cache and returned as `file://` URIs, pixel buffers do
