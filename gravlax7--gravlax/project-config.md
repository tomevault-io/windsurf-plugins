## Thinking, writing and answering style

Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
Never use a long word where a short one will do.
If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
Never use the passive where you can use the active.
Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

## What this is

Gravlax is an Electron desktop app that walks a music release through a 7-step upload pipeline to Gazelle-based music trackers: file checks → spectrals → metadata → tags → transcode → upload → seed. It is a TypeScript/Solid.js project.
Inspired by `smoked-salmon` (the Python original lives at `../smoked-salmon` and is a useful reference for tracker/tooling behaviour).

## Commands

```bash
bun run dev          # electron-vite dev (main + preload + renderer with HMR)
bun run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit for both node and web projects — the only "lint"
bun run test         # vitest run
bun run test:watch
bun run dist:mac     # build + electron-builder (also :linux, :win, or bare `dist`)
```

Run a single test file or case:

```bash
npx vitest run src/main/core/uploadflow/__tests__/upload.test.ts -t 'maps artist roles'
```

Runtime depends on external binaries on `PATH`: `sox`, `flac`, `metaflac`, and `lame`. The FLAC tools must be version 1.5.0 or newer. They are probed in `src/main/services/healthcheck.ts` and surfaced in the Healthcheck screen.

## Rules
If you ever take control of the app to test something, be sure to NEVER hit the submit button.

Don't write tracker URLs in the codebase
Don't open tracker pages in your browser

Whenever possible, remove unused code and simplify to what's absolutely necessary only.
