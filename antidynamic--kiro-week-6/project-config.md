Grounding with Google Search

content_copy


Note: Gemini 3 billing for Grounding with Google Search will begin on January 5, 2026.
Grounding with Google Search connects the Gemini model to real-time web content and works with all available languages. This allows Gemini to provide more accurate answers and cite verifiable sources beyond its knowledge cutoff.

Grounding helps you build applications that can:

Increase factual accuracy: Reduce model hallucinations by basing responses on real-world information.
Access real-time information: Answer questions about recent events and topics.
Provide citations: Build user trust by showing the sources for the model's claims.

Python
JavaScript
REST

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

const groundingTool = {
  googleSearch: {},
};

const config = {
  tools: [groundingTool],
};

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  contents: "Who won the euro 2024?",
  config,
});

console.log(response.text);
You can learn more by trying the Search tool notebook.

How grounding with Google Search works
When you enable the google_search tool, the model handles the entire workflow of searching, processing, and citing information automatically.

grounding-overview

User Prompt: Your application sends a user's prompt to the Gemini API with the google_search tool enabled.
Prompt Analysis: The model analyzes the prompt and determines if a Google Search can improve the answer.
Google Search: If needed, the model automatically generates one or multiple search queries and executes them.
Search Results Processing: The model processes the search results, synthesizes the information, and formulates a response.
Grounded Response: The API returns a final, user-friendly response that is grounded in the search results. This response includes the model's text answer and groundingMetadata with the search queries, web results, and citations.
Understanding the grounding response
When a response is successfully grounded, the response includes a groundingMetadata field. This structured data is essential for verifying claims and building a rich citation experience in your application.


{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "content": {
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "Spain won Euro 2024, defeating England 2-1 in the final. This victory marks Spain's record fourth European Championship title."
          }
        ],
        "role": "model"
      },
      "groundingMetadata": {
        "webSearchQueries": [
          "UEFA Euro 2024 winner",
          "who won euro 2024"
        ],
        "searchEntryPoint": {
          "renderedContent": "<!-- HTML and CSS for the search widget -->"
        },
        "groundingChunks": [
          {"web": {"uri": "https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com.....", "title": "aljazeera.com"}},
          {"web": {"uri": "https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com.....", "title": "uefa.com"}}
        ],
        "groundingSupports": [
          {
            "segment": {"startIndex": 0, "endIndex": 85, "text": "Spain won Euro 2024, defeatin..."},
            "groundingChunkIndices": [0]
          },
          {
            "segment": {"startIndex": 86, "endIndex": 210, "text": "This victory marks Spain's..."},
            "groundingChunkIndices": [0, 1]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
The Gemini API returns the following information with the groundingMetadata:

webSearchQueries : Array of the search queries used. This is useful for debugging and understanding the model's reasoning process.
searchEntryPoint : Contains the HTML and CSS to render the required Search Suggestions. Full usage requirements are detailed in the Terms of Service.
groundingChunks : Array of objects containing the web sources (uri and title).
groundingSupports : Array of chunks to connect model response text to the sources in groundingChunks. Each chunk links a text segment (defined by startIndex and endIndex) to one or more groundingChunkIndices. This is the key to building inline citations.
Grounding with Google Search can also be used in combination with the URL context tool to ground responses in both public web data and the specific URLs you provide.

Attributing sources with inline citations
The API returns structured citation data, giving you complete control over how you display sources in your user interface. You can use the groundingSupports and groundingChunks fields to link the model's statements directly to their sources. Here is a common pattern for processing the metadata to create a response with inline, clickable citations.

Python
JavaScript

function addCitations(response) {
    let text = response.text;
    const supports = response.candidates[0]?.groundingMetadata?.groundingSupports;
    const chunks = response.candidates[0]?.groundingMetadata?.groundingChunks;

    // Sort supports by end_index in descending order to avoid shifting issues when inserting.
    const sortedSupports = [...supports].sort(
        (a, b) => (b.segment?.endIndex ?? 0) - (a.segment?.endIndex ?? 0),
    );

    for (const support of sortedSupports) {
        const endIndex = support.segment?.endIndex;
        if (endIndex === undefined || !support.groundingChunkIndices?.length) {
        continue;
        }

        const citationLinks = support.groundingChunkIndices
        .map(i => {
            const uri = chunks[i]?.web?.uri;
            if (uri) {
            return `[${i + 1}](${uri})`;
            }
            return null;
        })
        .filter(Boolean);

        if (citationLinks.length > 0) {
        const citationString = citationLinks.join(", ");
        text = text.slice(0, endIndex) + citationString + text.slice(endIndex);
        }
    }

    return text;
}

const textWithCitations = addCitations(response);
console.log(textWithCitations);
The new response with inline citations will look like this:


Spain won Euro 2024, defeating England 2-1 in the final.[1](https:/...), [2](https:/...), [4](https:/...), [5](https:/...) This victory marks Spain's record-breaking fourth European Championship title.[5]((https:/...), [2](https:/...), [3](https:/...), [4](https:/...)
Pricing
When you use Grounding with Google Search with Gemini 3, your project is billed for each search query that the model decides to execute. If the model decides to execute multiple search queries to answer a single prompt (for example, searching for "UEFA Euro 2024 winner" and "Spain vs England Euro 2024 final score" within the same API call), this counts as two billable uses of the tool for that request. This only applies to Gemini 3 models; when you use search grounding with Gemini 2.5 or older models, your project is billed per prompt.

For detailed pricing information, see the Gemini API pricing page.

Note: Gemini 3 billing for Grounding with Google Search will start January 5, 2026.
Supported models
Experimental and Preview models are not included. You can find their capabilities on the model overview page.

Gemini 2.5 Pro	✔️
Gemini 2.5 Flash	✔️
Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite	✔️
Gemini 2.0 Flash	✔️
Gemini 1.5 Pro	✔️
Gemini 1.5 Flash	✔️
Note: Older models use a google_search_retrieval tool. For all current models, use the google_search tool as shown in the examples.
Supported tools combinations
You can use Grounding with Google Search with other tools like code execution and URL context to power more complex use cases.

Grounding with Gemini 1.5 Models (Legacy)
While the google_search tool is recommended for Gemini 2.0 and later, Gemini 1.5 supports a legacy tool named google_search_retrieval. This tool provides a dynamic mode that allows the model to decide whether to perform a search based on its confidence that the prompt requires fresh information. If the model's confidence is above a dynamic_threshold you set (a value between 0.0 and 1.0), it will perform a search.

Python
JavaScript
REST

// Note: This is a legacy approach for Gemini 1.5 models.
// The 'googleSearch' tool is recommended for all new development.
import { GoogleGenAI, DynamicRetrievalConfigMode } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

const retrievalTool = {
  googleSearchRetrieval: {
    dynamicRetrievalConfig: {
      mode: DynamicRetrievalConfigMode.MODE_DYNAMIC,
      dynamicThreshold: 0.7, // Only search if confidence > 70%
    },
  },
};

const config = {
  tools: [retrievalTool],
};

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-1.5-flash",
  contents: "Who won the euro 2024?",
  config,
});

console.log(response.text);
if (!response.candidates?.[0]?.groundingMetadata) {
  console.log("\nModel answered from its own knowledge.");

Structured Outputs

content_copy


You can configure Gemini models to generate responses that adhere to a provided JSON Schema. This capability guarantees predictable and parsable results, ensures format and type-safety, enables the programmatic detection of refusals, and simplifies prompting.

Using structured outputs is ideal for a wide range of applications:

Data extraction: Pull specific information from unstructured text, like extracting names, dates, and amounts from an invoice.
Structured classification: Classify text into predefined categories and assign structured labels, such as categorizing customer feedback by sentiment and topic.
Agentic workflows: Generate structured data that can be used to call other tools or APIs, like creating a character sheet for a game or filling out a form.
In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the Google GenAI SDKs for Python and JavaScript also make it easy to define object schemas using Pydantic and Zod, respectively. The example below demonstrates how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Recipe Extractor Content Moderation Recursive Structures

This example demonstrates how to extract structured data from text using basic JSON Schema types like object, array, string, and integer.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodToJsonSchema } from "zod-to-json-schema";

const ingredientSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().describe("Name of the ingredient."),
  quantity: z.string().describe("Quantity of the ingredient, including units."),
});

const recipeSchema = z.object({
  recipe_name: z.string().describe("The name of the recipe."),
  prep_time_minutes: z.number().optional().describe("Optional time in minutes to prepare the recipe."),
  ingredients: z.array(ingredientSchema),
  instructions: z.array(z.string()),
});

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

const prompt = `
Please extract the recipe from the following text.
The user wants to make delicious chocolate chip cookies.
They need 2 and 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda,
1 teaspoon of salt, 1 cup of unsalted butter (softened), 3/4 cup of granulated sugar,
3/4 cup of packed brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 2 large eggs.
For the best part, they'll need 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
First, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Then, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour,
baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar
until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla and eggs, one at a time. Gradually beat in the dry
ingredients until just combined. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips. Drop by rounded tablespoons
onto ungreased baking sheets and bake for 9 to 11 minutes.
`;

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  contents: prompt,
  config: {
    responseMimeType: "application/json",
    responseJsonSchema: zodToJsonSchema(recipeSchema),
  },
});

const recipe = recipeSchema.parse(JSON.parse(response.text));
console.log(recipe);
Example Response:

    "Gradually beat in the dry ingredients until just combined.",
    "Stir in the chocolate chips.",
    "Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheets and bake for 9 to 11 minutes."
  ]
}
Streaming
You can stream structured outputs, which allows you to start processing the response as it's being generated, without having to wait for the entire output to be complete. This can improve the perceived performance of your application.

The streamed chunks will be valid partial JSON strings, which can be concatenated to form the final, complete JSON object.

Python
JavaScript

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodToJsonSchema } from "zod-to-json-schema";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});
const prompt = "The new UI is incredibly intuitive and visually appealing. Great job! Add a very long summary to test streaming!";

const feedbackSchema = z.object({
  sentiment: z.enum(["positive", "neutral", "negative"]),
  summary: z.string(),
});

const stream = await ai.models.generateContentStream({
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  contents: prompt,
  config: {
    responseMimeType: "application/json",
    responseJsonSchema: zodToJsonSchema(feedbackSchema),
  },
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(chunk.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text)
}
Structured outputs with tools
Preview: This is a feature available only for the Gemini 3 series models, gemini-3-pro-preview and gemini-3-flash-preview.
Gemini 3 lets you combine Structured Outputs with built-in tools, including Grounding with Google Search, URL Context, Code Execution, and File Search.

Python
JavaScript
REST

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodToJsonSchema } from "zod-to-json-schema";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

const matchSchema = z.object({
  winner: z.string().describe("The name of the winner."),
  final_match_score: z.string().describe("The final score."),
  scorers: z.array(z.string()).describe("The name of the scorer.")
});

async function run() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-3-pro-preview",
    contents: "Search for all details for the latest Euro.",
    config: {
      tools: [
        { googleSearch: {} },
        { urlContext: {} }
      ],
      responseMimeType: "application/json",
      responseJsonSchema: zodToJsonSchema(matchSchema),
    },
  });

  const match = matchSchema.parse(JSON.parse(response.text));
  console.log(match);
}

run();
JSON schema support
To generate a JSON object, set the response_mime_type in the generation configuration to application/json and provide a response_json_schema. The schema must be a valid JSON Schema that describes the desired output format.

The model will then generate a response that is a syntactically valid JSON string matching the provided schema. When using structured outputs, the model will produce outputs in the same order as the keys in the schema.

Gemini's structured output mode supports a subset of the JSON Schema specification.

The following values of type are supported:

string: For text.
number: For floating-point numbers.
integer: For whole numbers.
boolean: For true/false values.
object: For structured data with key-value pairs.
array: For lists of items.
null: To allow a property to be null, include "null" in the type array (e.g., {"type": ["string", "null"]}).
These descriptive properties help guide the model:

title: A short description of a property.
description: A longer and more detailed description of a property.
Type-specific properties
For object values:

properties: An object where each key is a property name and each value is a schema for that property.
required: An array of strings, listing which properties are mandatory.
additionalProperties: Controls whether properties not listed in properties are allowed. Can be a boolean or a schema.
For string values:

enum: Lists a specific set of possible strings for classification tasks.
format: Specifies a syntax for the string, such as date-time, date, time.
For number and integer values:

enum: Lists a specific set of possible numeric values.
minimum: The minimum inclusive value.
maximum: The maximum inclusive value.
For array values:

items: Defines the schema for all items in the array.
prefixItems: Defines a list of schemas for the first N items, allowing for tuple-like structures.
minItems: The minimum number of items in the array.
maxItems: The maximum number of items in the array.
Model support
The following models support structured output:

Model	Structured Outputs
Gemini 3 Pro Preview	✔️
Gemini 3 Flash Preview	✔️
Gemini 2.5 Pro	✔️
Gemini 2.5 Flash	✔️
Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite	✔️
Gemini 2.0 Flash	✔️*
Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite	✔️*
* Note that Gemini 2.0 requires an explicit propertyOrdering list within the JSON input to define the preferred structure. You can find an example in this cookbook.

Structured outputs vs. function calling
Both structured outputs and function calling use JSON schemas, but they serve different purposes:

Feature	Primary Use Case
Structured Outputs	Formatting the final response to the user. Use this when you want the model's answer to be in a specific format (e.g., extracting data from a document to save to a database).
Function Calling	Taking action during the conversation. Use this when the model needs to ask you to perform a task (e.g., "get current weather") before it can provide a final answer.
Best practices
Clear descriptions: Use the description field in your schema to provide clear instructions to the model about what each property represents. This is crucial for guiding the model's output.
Strong typing: Use specific types (integer, string, enum) whenever possible. If a parameter has a limited set of valid values, use an enum.
Prompt engineering: Clearly state in your prompt what you want the model to do. For example, "Extract the following information from the text..." or "Classify this feedback according to the provided schema...".
Validation: While structured output guarantees syntactically correct JSON, it does not guarantee the values are semantically correct. Always validate the final output in your application code before using it.
Error handling: Implement robust error handling in your application to gracefully manage cases where the model's output, while schema-compliant, may not meet your business logic requirements.
Limitations
Schema subset: Not all features of the JSON Schema specification are supported. The model ignores unsupported properties.
Schema complexity: The API may reject very large or deeply nested schemas. If you encounter errors, try simplifying your schema by shortening property names, reducing nesting, or limiting the number of constraints.

Text generation

content_copy


The Gemini API can generate text output from various inputs, including text, images, video, and audio.

Here's a basic example that takes a single text input:

Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "How does AI work?",
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();

Thinking with Gemini
Gemini models often have "thinking" enabled by default which allows the model to reason before responding to a request.

Each model supports different thinking configurations which gives you control over cost, latency, and intelligence. For more details, see the thinking guide.

Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "How does AI work?",
    config: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        thinkingBudget: 0, // Disables thinking
      },
    }
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
System instructions and other configurations
You can guide the behavior of Gemini models with system instructions. To do so, pass a GenerateContentConfig object.

Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Hello there",
    config: {
      systemInstruction: "You are a cat. Your name is Neko.",
    },
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
The GenerateContentConfig object also lets you override default generation parameters, such as temperature.

When using Gemini 3 models, we strongly recommend keeping the temperature at its default value of 1.0. Changing the temperature (setting it below 1.0) may lead to unexpected behavior, such as looping or degraded performance, particularly in complex mathematical or reasoning tasks.
Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Explain how AI works",
    config: {
      temperature: 0.1,
    },
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
Refer to the GenerateContentConfig in our API reference for a complete list of configurable parameters and their descriptions.

Multimodal inputs
The Gemini API supports multimodal inputs, allowing you to combine text with media files. The following example demonstrates providing an image:

Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
REST
Apps Script

import {
  GoogleGenAI,
  createUserContent,
  createPartFromUri,
} from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const image = await ai.files.upload({
    file: "/path/to/organ.png",
  });
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: [
      createUserContent([
        "Tell me about this instrument",
        createPartFromUri(image.uri, image.mimeType),
      ]),
    ],
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
For alternative methods of providing images and more advanced image processing, see our image understanding guide. The API also supports document, video, and audio inputs and understanding.

Streaming responses
By default, the model returns a response only after the entire generation process is complete.

For more fluid interactions, use streaming to receive GenerateContentResponse instances incrementally as they're generated.

Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContentStream({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Explain how AI works",
  });

  for await (const chunk of response) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
  }
}

await main();
Multi-turn conversations (chat)
Our SDKs provide functionality to collect multiple rounds of prompts and responses into a chat, giving you an easy way to keep track of the conversation history.

Note: Chat functionality is only implemented as part of the SDKs. Behind the scenes, it still uses the generateContent API. For multi-turn conversations, the full conversation history is sent to the model with each follow-up turn.
Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const chat = ai.chats.create({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    history: [
      {
        role: "user",
        parts: [{ text: "Hello" }],
      },
      {
        role: "model",
        parts: [{ text: "Great to meet you. What would you like to know?" }],
      },
    ],
  });

  const response1 = await chat.sendMessage({
    message: "I have 2 dogs in my house.",
  });
  console.log("Chat response 1:", response1.text);

  const response2 = await chat.sendMessage({
    message: "How many paws are in my house?",
  });
  console.log("Chat response 2:", response2.text);
}

await main();
Streaming can also be used for multi-turn conversations.

Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
REST
Apps Script

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const chat = ai.chats.create({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    history: [
      {
        role: "user",
        parts: [{ text: "Hello" }],
      },
      {
        role: "model",
        parts: [{ text: "Great to meet you. What would you like to know?" }],
      },
    ],
  });

  const stream1 = await chat.sendMessageStream({
    message: "I have 2 dogs in my house.",
  });
  for await (const chunk of stream1) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
    console.log("_".repeat(80));
  }

  const stream2 = await chat.sendMessageStream({
    message: "How many paws are in my house?",
  });
  for await (const chunk of stream2) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
    console.log("_".repeat(80));
  }
}

await main();
