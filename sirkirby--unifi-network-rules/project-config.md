# Clean, Testable, & Performant Python Code Rules

* Readability First (Zen of Python): Follow PEP 8 (naming, indentation, whitespace, line length). Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Functions and classes should do one thing and do it well. Keep functions small and focused.
* Idempotence & Purity (for Testability): Prefer pure functions (no side effects) where possible, especially in core logic, as they are trivial to test. Isolate I/O and state changes.
* Type Hinting: Use type hints heavily (def calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:). This improves clarity, enables static analysis (like mypy), and aids tooling.
* Concise & Idiomatic Code: Leverage Python features like list comprehensions, generator expressions, and context managers (with) instead of long, verbose loops or try/finally blocks.
* Performance Awareness: Understand Python's data structures (e.g., set lookups are O(1)). Profile critical sections of code before optimizing, and avoid premature optimization. Use built-in functions and standard library modules where possible (they are often implemented in C and faster).
* Documentation: Document public APIs (classes, methods, functions) using clear docstrings (e.g., NumPy or Google style) explaining what they do, why, and how to use them.

## Good & Well-Organized Python Project Structure Rules

* Standard Directory Layout
* * Root: Contains meta-files: README.md, LICENSE, configuration files (.pre-commit-config.yaml), and top-level build files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg).
* * Source Code: Place all reusable library code in a single top-level package directory named after the project (e.g., custom_components/unifi_network_rules).
* * Tests: Use a dedicated directory for tests, often named tests/, outside the source package.
* Dependency Management: Explicitly manage dependencies using a tool like Poetry or PDM (preferred modern methods) or traditional requirements.txt/setup.py/pyproject.toml.
* Environment Isolation: Always use virtual environments (e.g., venv) to isolate project dependencies.
* Configuration Separation: Separate configuration (e.g., environment variables, settings files) from code. Do not hardcode secrets.
* Tooling Consistency: Enforce code style and quality checks automatically using tools like linters (e.g., Ruff, Flake8), formatters (e.g., Black), and type checkers (e.g., mypy) via pre-commit hooks.
