# CLAUDE.md — asahi_neo

This project is an experimental feasibility study for booting Linux on Apple hardware
featuring the A18 Pro chip (architecturally close to M4) via an XNU Shim approach.
It is **not** affiliated with the Asahi Linux project. GenAI is not to be used for
writing patches intended for upstreaming — this is exploratory research only.

## Navigation

- **PLAN.md** — Current action items, milestones, and known blockers. Check here first.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — High-level design of the XNU shim boot path and memory layout.
- **docs/SPTM_FINDINGS.md** — Running log of everything learned about SPTM/GXF.
- **docs/ASAHI_REFERENCE.md** — Distilled notes from Asahi Linux docs relevant to this effort.
- **docs/GRAPHICS.md** — Notes on graphics paths: framebuffer → software → AGX hardware.
- **xnu_shim/** — The shim implementation (stub code, build scripts, notes).
- **scripts/** — Testing, extraction, and analysis scripts.
- **research/** — Papers, reverse-engineering notes, binary dumps and annotations.

## Governing Principles

1. **Document everything.** If you discover something about the architecture — even a dead end —
   write it down in the relevant doc before moving on. The docs are the project.

2. **Defer to docs.** Before writing code, check ARCHITECTURE.md and SPTM_FINDINGS.md.
   Don't re-derive what's already been established.

3. **Test scripts first.** Prefer small, targeted scripts that can be run from a tethered
   boot or hypervisor context before writing permanent shim code.

4. **No GenAI patches for upstreaming.** Patches intended for the Asahi Linux upstream
   (m1n1, linux-asahi, etc.) must be human-authored and reviewed before submission.
   For local bringup/research work, the agent (Claude Code) is authorized to make
   code edits directly — including patches to m1n1 and other bootloader code.

5. **Respect the Asahi social contract.** Never alter macOS security settings.
   The Linux stub is a simple APFS volume in its own container under
   Permissive Security. Setup uses `bputil -nkcas` + `kmutil` + `bless`
   from macOS 1TR. See scripts/README.md for the full workflow.
