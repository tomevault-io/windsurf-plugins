## ⚠️ MANDATORY LOAD

Before any work in this project, read and obey AGENT_DIRECTIVES.md in the project root.

All rules in that file are hard overrides. They govern:
- Pre-work protocol (dead code cleanup, phased execution)
- Code quality (senior dev override, forced verification, type safety)
- Context management (sub-agent swarming, decay awareness, read budget)
- Edit safety (re-read before/after edit, grep-based rename, import hygiene)
- Commit discipline (atomic commits, no broken commits)
- Communication (state plan, report honestly, no hallucinated APIs)

Violation of any rule is a blocking issue.

## Project Overrides

> Add project-specific rules below. These extend AGENT_DIRECTIVES.md, never contradict it.
> Delete or modify the placeholder sections as needed.
