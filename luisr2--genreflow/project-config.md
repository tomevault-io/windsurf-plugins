# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

GenreFlow is a music genre classifier that analyzes audio files for BPM (tempo). It consists of a FastAPI backend for audio processing and a minimal HTML/CSS/JS frontend. The project deploys to a k3s Raspberry Pi cluster using ArgoCD for GitOps.

**Current Status**: MVP phase - only BPM analysis is implemented. Genre classification uses a heuristic placeholder that will be replaced with ML models (ONNX/TFLite).

## Common Commands

All commands run from the repository root via Make:

```bash
# Setup
make install              # Install dependencies via Poetry

# Development
make dev                  # Run backend with hot-reload on port 8080
make frontend             # Run frontend on port 3000 (set GENREFLOW_API_BASE_URL if needed)

# Testing & Linting
make test                 # Run pytest
make test PYTEST_ARGS="-k test_name"  # Run specific test
make lint                 # Run ruff linter
make format               # Format code with ruff

# Docker
make compose-up           # Start both services locally
make compose-down         # Stop services
make docker-build-all     # Build backend and frontend images (arm64)
```

## Architecture

```
User -> Frontend (port 3000) -> Backend (port 8080) -> Audio Processing (librosa)
```

**Backend** (`backend/`):
- `app/app.py` - FastAPI entrypoint, health checks, CORS configuration
- `app/predict.py` - `Predictor` class: loads audio, resamples to 16kHz, estimates BPM using librosa
- `app/routes_file.py` - File upload endpoints (`POST /predict/file`, `POST /predict/files`)
- `app/schemas.py` - Pydantic models (`BPMResult`, `BPMBulkResponse`)

**Frontend** (`frontend/`):
- Minimal FastAPI serving static HTML/CSS/JS
- Drag-and-drop file upload UI
- Gets backend URL from `/config.json` endpoint

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /healthz` - Liveness probe
- `GET /readyz` - Readiness probe (checks if predictor loaded)
- `POST /predict/file` - Single file BPM analysis
- `POST /predict/files` - Bulk file BPM analysis

## Code Style

- Python 3.11+, strict typing enforced via MyPy
- Ruff for linting (line length 110, Google-style docstrings)
- All functions require type annotations (except tests)
- Tests live in `backend/tests/`

## Environment Variables

- `GENREFLOW_API_BASE_URL` - Backend URL for frontend (default: `http://localhost:8080`)
- `GENREFLOW_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - CORS allowed origins (comma-separated)

## Branching Strategy

This project uses **trunk-based development**. All changes go directly to `main`.

- Short-lived feature branches are acceptable for large changes, but merge to `main` quickly.
- There is no long-lived `dev` branch — `main` is always the source of truth.

## Deployment

- Kubernetes manifests in `k8s/` (Kustomize base/overlay structure)
- ArgoCD applications in `k8s/argocd/`
- Docker images built for linux/arm64 (Raspberry Pi)
- Sealed secrets for Docker Hub credentials
