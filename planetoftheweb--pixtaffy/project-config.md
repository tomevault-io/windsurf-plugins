# BranDolt – Developer Notes

## UI design principles (Ray's taste — follow these for any new UI)

Minimal, direct-manipulation interfaces. Every control must earn its pixels.

- **Manipulate the value itself, not a separate input.** A number readout IS the
  control: drag it to scrub, click it to type in place (see the item duration
  in Build Studio). Never add a second input elsewhere for the same value.
- **Rename in place.** Double-click the name where it's displayed → it becomes
  an input. No "name" field in a details panel.
- **Hide, then reveal.** Actions appear on hover (trash), details expand on
  selection, settings collapse into titled sections. Default view = quiet list.
- **Drag beats buttons.** Reorder by dragging the row, move by dragging the
  badge, resize by dragging corners — not up/down arrow buttons.
- **Icons + tooltips over text labels** for compact toggles (e.g. Smart/Center
  zoom modes). Text only when an icon would be ambiguous (the "AI" tag).
- **Rich tooltips, never native `title`.** Every hover hint is a styled
  overlay (dark pill, `bg-black/90`, 13px, absolute-positioned off the
  control — see `ToolBarButton`/`Tip` in BuildStudio). Native browser
  tooltips are slow, unstyled, and inconsistent — don't ship them.
- **EVERY interactive control gets an overlay. No exceptions.** When adding
  or restyling any button/control, the tooltip is part of the control, not an
  afterthought. Longer explanations use `title` + `text` (bold headline,
  muted body), not one run-on paragraph.
- **Tooltips must never crop.** Two recurring killers: (1) an
  `overflow-hidden` ancestor (segmented button groups!) — round the child
  buttons instead of clipping the group; (2) edge overflow — controls near
  the right edge of the screen/panel use `align="right"`, controls inside
  scroll containers use `side="left"` with wrapping. Verify by hovering after
  any layout change.
- **Destructive or paid actions confirm inline**, not with dialogs: first tap
  arms the button ("Sure?"), second tap fires, ~2.5 s auto-disarm. Everything
  destructive must be undoable (⌘Z) anyway.
- **No layout shift** on hover/reveal — overlay or fade controls in, don't
  push content around.
- **One obvious escape hatch**: Esc peels back one layer at a time (field →
  panel → zoom → selection → close), never jumps straight to closing.

## VPN / Corporate Proxy – Image Cache Contract

**History of regressions**: VPN-blocking of `firebasestorage.googleapis.com` has caused thumbnail/image failures repeatedly. Thumbnail-specific fixes landed in 08d54a2, 055b573, f41d8ac, and 201f2b7; adjacent hardening landed in 8a8f3b2 (profile photos) and 9efc7ca (Storage upload warnings). Each fix involved the IndexedDB blob cache in `services/imageCache.ts`.

### How it works

Images are stored in Firebase Storage after upload. On VPN, the Storage domain is blocked, so `<img src="https://firebasestorage...">` fails. The fallback chain:

1. `onError` fires on the `<img>` element (see `handleImageLoadError` in `RecentGenerations.tsx`, `handleImageError` / `handleVersionImageError` in `ImageDisplay.tsx`)
2. Falls back to inline `imageData` (base64) if present (new generations not yet uploaded)
3. Falls back to `getCachedImageBlobUrl(generationId, versionId)` in IndexedDB

### The critical invariant (easy to break)

**`cacheImageFromBase64` MUST be awaited BEFORE `uploadGenerationImage`** inside `serializeGenerationForRemote` in `services/historyService.ts`.

If cache seeding comes AFTER the upload and the upload throws (VPN blocks Storage), the cache is never populated and the image is unrecoverable on VPN.

Current safe ordering (do NOT reverse):
```
await cacheImageFromBase64(...)  // 1. seed IDB locally — no network
const uploaded = await uploadGenerationImage(...)   // 2. upload to Storage (may throw on VPN)
```

### Regression checklist

Run this before shipping any change to `historyService.ts`, `imageCache.ts`, `ImageDisplay.tsx`, or `RecentGenerations.tsx`:

1. **Off-VPN priming**: Open the app, generate or load 3+ images, confirm they display.
2. **Enable VPN** (anything that blocks `firebasestorage.googleapis.com`).
3. **Hard-reload** the page (Cmd+Shift+R) — bypass browser cache.
4. **Confirm**: All gallery thumbnails still display (served from IndexedDB).
5. **Confirm**: Clicking a tile shows the full preview image.
6. **Generate a new image on VPN**: It should display immediately (inline base64 fallback), and the tile should still show after a hard-reload on VPN (served from IDB — because the IDB was seeded BEFORE the upload was attempted).
7. **Turn VPN off** and hard-reload — Storage URL loads; IDB entries survive (no spurious pruning).

### Diagnostics (browser DevTools)

- Application → IndexedDB → `brandoit_image_cache_v1` → `images`: check entry count and sizes.
- Console: `[imageCache]` warn lines indicate cache read/write failures.
- Console: `[ImageDisplay]` / `[RecentGenerations]` warn lines indicate fallback failures.
- Network tab: filter `firebasestorage` — on VPN these requests should fail; confirm `blob:` URLs appear in the img `src` afterwards.
