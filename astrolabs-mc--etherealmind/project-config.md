# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

EtherealMind is a Minecraft Forge mod (1.20.1) that introduces COSMO - an advanced AI companion entity with dimensional storage, reality-warping abilities, and an evolving personality system.

## Common Development Commands

### Build & Run
```bash
# Build the mod
./gradlew build

# Run client
./gradlew runClient

# Run server
./gradlew runServer

# Generate data (recipes, tags, etc.)
./gradlew runData

# Clean build files
./gradlew clean
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests "com.astrolabs.etherealmind.TestClassName"
```

```

## Key Systems

### COSMO Entity
- Bound to individual players (one per player)
- Floating, no-collision entity with custom renderer
- Uses GeckoLib for advanced animations
- Persistent across dimensions

### AI & Personality
- Evolving personality based on playtime and interactions
- Mood system affects behavior and visuals
- Memory bank stores player interactions
- Trust level unlocks features

### Dimensional Storage
- 64 pages × 54 slots = 3,456 item slots
- Quick access bar (9 slots)
- Smart categorization with learning
- Search functionality with special syntax

## Development Guidelines

1. **Performance**: Always consider performance, especially for rendering and particles
2. **Networking**: Use packets for all client-server communication
3. **Data Persistence**: Store all important data in NBT
4. **Mod Compatibility**: Design systems to be extensible via API

## Testing in Development

When testing COSMO:
1. Use `/give @p etherealmind:cosmo_spawn_egg` to get spawn item
2. Right-click to spawn and bind COSMO
3. COSMO will follow you and respond to interactions
4. Check logs for AI state changes and debug info
