# Cloud CLI Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is a Laravel Zero CLI tool for deploying applications to Laravel Cloud.

## Code Style

-   Follow Laravel/PSR-12 conventions
-   Run `./vendor/bin/pint --dirty` after modifying PHP files
-   Use Laravel Prompts for all user interactions (confirm, select, text, password, info, warning, error)

## Architecture

-   Commands live in `app/Commands/`
-   `app/Git.php` handles all git and GitHub CLI operations
-   `app/ConfigRepository.php` manages user config stored in `~/.config/cloud/config.json`
-   `app/ProcessResult.php` wraps command execution results

## Conventions

-   Use `gh` CLI for GitHub API interactions rather than direct HTTP calls
-   Constructor methods with empty bodies should contain a single empty comment
-   Non-public methods/properties should be `protected`, not `private`
-   Limit comments to non-obvious code only
-   For long command signatures, separate the arguments and concatonate them in the property to make it more readable (leading space)
-   Never use the helper methods in `Command`, always use Prompts helper functions

## Dependencies

-   Laravel Zero 12.x
-   PHP 8.2+
-   Requires GitHub CLI (`gh`) to be installed and authenticated
