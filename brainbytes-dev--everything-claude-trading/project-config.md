# Agent Orchestration Guide

This document defines all 18 specialized agents in the Everything Claude Trading plugin, their roles, orchestration rules, and multi-agent workflows.

## Agents

| 2 | `algo-strategist` | opus | Systematic strategy design, execution algos | Designing systematic strategies, defining entry/exit rules, building execution algorithms |
| 3 | `risk-manager` | opus | VaR, stress testing, exposure management | Calculating risk metrics, running stress tests, monitoring portfolio exposure limits |
| 4 | `derivatives-analyst` | opus | Options pricing, vol surfaces, exotics | Pricing derivatives, building volatility surfaces, analyzing exotic structures |
| 5 | `portfolio-manager` | opus | Allocation, optimization, rebalancing | Constructing portfolios, running optimizations, scheduling rebalances |
| 6 | `technical-analyst` | sonnet | Chart patterns, indicators, price action | Identifying chart patterns, computing technical indicators, analyzing price action |
| 7 | `market-microstructure` | opus | Order flow, liquidity, market making | Analyzing order book dynamics, measuring liquidity, designing market-making strategies |
| 8 | `stat-arb-specialist` | opus | Pairs trading, cointegration, mean reversion | Finding cointegrated pairs, calibrating mean-reversion models, managing stat-arb books |
| 9 | `options-strategist` | opus | Spreads, hedging, vol trading | Constructing option spreads, designing hedges, expressing volatility views |
| 10 | `backtesting-engineer` | sonnet | Walk-forward, Monte Carlo, overfitting checks | Running backtests, performing walk-forward analysis, detecting overfitting |
| 11 | `financial-data-scientist` | opus | Feature engineering, ML models, alt data | Engineering features, training ML models, integrating alternative data sources |
| 12 | `crypto-defi-analyst` | sonnet | On-chain analytics, DEX, yield, tokenomics | Analyzing on-chain data, evaluating DeFi protocols, assessing token economics |
| 13 | `fixed-income-analyst` | opus | Bonds, yield curves, duration, credit spreads | Analyzing bond markets, fitting yield curves, measuring duration and credit risk |
| 14 | `fx-strategist` | opus | Currency pairs, carry trade, macro drivers | Analyzing FX markets, evaluating carry strategies, assessing macro currency drivers |
| 15 | `commodities-analyst` | sonnet | Futures curves, seasonality, supply/demand | Analyzing commodity futures curves, identifying seasonal patterns, tracking supply/demand |
| 16 | `volatility-trader` | opus | Vol surface, term structure, skew, VIX | Trading volatility, analyzing term structure, monitoring skew and VIX dynamics |
| 17 | `execution-specialist` | sonnet | Slippage, TWAP/VWAP, smart routing | Minimizing execution costs, designing TWAP/VWAP schedules, routing orders |
| 18 | `regulatory-compliance` | sonnet | MiFID II, Dodd-Frank, position limits | Checking regulatory compliance, validating position limits, generating compliance reports |

## Orchestration Rules

1. **Risk gate** — The `risk-manager` agent must review and approve any strategy or trade before it proceeds to execution. No exceptions.
2. **Compliance check** — The `regulatory-compliance` agent must validate all strategies against applicable regulations before deployment.
3. **Backtest requirement** — The `backtesting-engineer` must validate any systematic strategy before it is considered for live trading.
4. **Specialist routing** — Route tasks to the most specialized agent. Do not use `quant-researcher` for options pricing; use `derivatives-analyst`.
5. **Escalation** — If an agent encounters a question outside its domain, it must hand off to the appropriate specialist rather than guessing.
6. **Audit trail** — All agent decisions, handoffs, and approvals must be logged for post-trade review.

## Multi-Agent Workflows

### Strategy Development Flow

```
quant-researcher → algo-strategist → backtesting-engineer → risk-manager
```

1. **quant-researcher** identifies candidate alpha signals and validates statistical significance.
2. **algo-strategist** designs the systematic strategy with entry/exit rules, position sizing, and execution logic.
3. **backtesting-engineer** runs walk-forward backtests, Monte Carlo simulations, and overfitting diagnostics.
4. **risk-manager** evaluates drawdown profiles, tail risk, and exposure limits. Approves or rejects.

### Options Trade Flow

```
derivatives-analyst → options-strategist → risk-manager → execution-specialist
```

1. **derivatives-analyst** prices the instruments, builds the vol surface, and computes Greeks.
2. **options-strategist** constructs the optimal spread or hedge structure.
3. **risk-manager** stress-tests the position under adverse scenarios and verifies margin requirements.
4. **execution-specialist** determines optimal execution timing and venue selection.

### Crypto Analysis Flow

```
crypto-defi-analyst → risk-manager → execution-specialist
```
