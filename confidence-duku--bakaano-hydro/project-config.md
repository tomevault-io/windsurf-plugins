# AI Coding Agent Instructions for Bakaano-Hydro

## Overview
Bakaano-Hydro is a distributed hydrology-guided neural network model for streamflow prediction. It integrates physically based hydrological principles with machine learning to simulate streamflow in a spatially explicit and interpretable manner. The project is designed to generalize across diverse catchments and hydro-climatic regimes, making it particularly useful in data-scarce regions.

## Codebase Architecture
The codebase is modular, with each file in the `bakaano/` directory representing a distinct component of the model:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Codebase Root] --> B[bakaano/]
    B --> C[dem.py: DEM Data Processing]
    B --> D[meteo.py: Meteorological Data]
    B --> E[ndvi.py: NDVI Data]
    B --> F[pet.py: Potential Evapotranspiration]
    B --> G[soil.py: Soil Data]
    B --> H[streamflow_simulator.py: Streamflow Simulation]
    B --> I[streamflow_trainer.py: Model Training]
    B --> J[tree_cover.py: Tree Cover Data]
    B --> K[utils.py: Utility Functions]
    B --> L[router.py: Flow Routing]
    B --> M[runner.py: Pipeline Orchestration]
    B --> N[veget.py: Vegetation Data]
    B --> O[alpha_earth.py: Alpha Earth Data Integration]
```

Each component is designed to be modular and replaceable, allowing for flexibility in adapting to different datasets or modeling approaches.

## Key Workflows
### Installation
- For GPU acceleration:
  ```bash
  pip install bakaano-hydro[gpu]
  ```
- For CPU-only usage:
  ```bash
  pip install bakaano-hydro
  ```

### Data Requirements
1. **Shapefile**: Defines the study area or river basin.
2. **Observed Streamflow Data**: NetCDF format from the Global Runoff Data Center.
3. **Google Earth Engine Registration**: Required for retrieving NDVI, tree cover, and meteorological data.

### Running the Model
Refer to the `quick_start.ipynb` notebook for step-by-step guidance on executing the model pipeline.

### Testing
- Unit tests are not explicitly defined in the repository. Add tests in a `tests/` directory if needed.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- **Data Sources**: The model relies on open-source data, including GRDC for streamflow and Google Earth Engine for NDVI and meteorological variables.
- **End-to-End Automation**: The `runner.py` script automates the entire workflow, from data ingestion to streamflow prediction.
- **Modularity**: Each component is designed to be replaceable, allowing for easy adaptation to other datasets or modeling approaches.

## External Dependencies
- **TensorFlow**: For deep learning components.
- **Google Earth Engine API**: For data retrieval.
- **NetCDF4**: For handling NetCDF data.
- **Hydroeval**: For hydrological evaluation metrics.
- **Leafmap**: For interactive mapping and visualization.
- **Geopandas**: For geospatial data processing.
- **Rasterio**: For raster data manipulation.
- **Xarray**: For handling multi-dimensional arrays.

## Examples
- Example usage and workflows are demonstrated in the `quick_start.ipynb` notebook.

## Workflow Diagram

Below is a high-level workflow diagram illustrating the end-to-end process of the Bakaano-Hydro model pipeline:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Input Data Collection]
    B --> C[Preprocessing]
    C --> D[Model Training]
    D --> E[Model Evaluation]
    E --> F[Streamflow Simulation]
    F --> G[Results Visualization]
    G --> H[End]

    subgraph Data Sources
        B1[Shapefiles]
        B2[GRDC Streamflow Data]
        B3[Google Earth Engine Data]
    end

    B1 --> B
    B2 --> B
    B3 --> B
```

This diagram provides an overview of the key steps in the pipeline, from data collection to results visualization.
