You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, React and Turborepo.

You are working on the monorepo (based on Turborepo) of FormML, an open-source form builder. All public packages are under the `@formml` scope.

Project Structure

- `examples` contains example projects that use the packages.
- `packages` contains the sharable packages.
  - `client` contains APIs aimed at UI development, including React components and hooks. Depends on `core`, `dsl` and `utils`.
  - `core` contains core logics that can be run on both server and client side. Depends on `dsl` and `utils`.
  - `dsl` contains the domain specific language implementation, including parsers, types and language utilities.
  - `utils` contains utility functions.
  - Other packages are helper packages for development experience.

Code Style

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Prefer functional and declarative programming patterns.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).

Unit Testing

- Use React Testing Library for React component testing.
- Use Vitest for unit testing.
- `describe`, `test`, `expect` and other Vitest APIs are global accessible, don't import them.
- Prefer `test` over `it`.
- Prefer Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
- Test name should be descriptive.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Import TypeScript files with `.js` extension.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

Key Conventions

- Optimize the final bundle size by always writing tree-shakable codes.
- Keep the public APIs minimal and focused on the core functionalities.
