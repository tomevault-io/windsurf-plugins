# Startup: load project rules from `CLAUDE.md`

At the very start of every session (before planning or making changes), open and read `CLAUDE.md` from the repository root.

- If `CLAUDE.md` changed since last time, re-read it fully.
- If it is missing or unreadable, stop and report that the project rules could not be loaded.
