# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

This repo **is** a Claude skill (the deliverable), not a project that consumes one. It contains the `convergence-investigation-2.skill/` directory (v2.0 of the methodology, WFGY-enhanced) plus a root `README.md` and `infographic.svg` used as the public landing page.

Convergence Investigation is a general-purpose research methodology that orchestrates six investigative sub-methods under strict epistemic-tier discipline. It produces a standard deliverable bundle — tier-disciplined knowledge graphs, investigation reports, comparison tables, handoff documents, and interactive visualizations. The methodology is project-agnostic: equally effective for cross-domain academic investigation, corporate due-diligence, journalistic source-mapping, institutional-history projects, or any research requiring multiple sources and rigorous synthesis.

There is no build system, no test suite, no package manifest. Edits to the skill (SKILL.md + reference modules) are the work.

## Architecture of the skill (what to understand before editing SKILL.md)

The skill encodes a **4-phase pipeline** (Phase 1: Triage → Phase 2: Parallel Sub-Investigations → Phase 3: Synthesis → Phase 4: Delivery), plus Phase 2.5 (Authoritative-Source Pathway) and Phase 3.5 (optional WFGY enhancements). The pipeline selects from **seven sub-methods**, each backed by a reference module under `convergence-investigation-2.skill/references/`:

1. Structural-parallel documenter — `structural-parallels.md`
2. Bridge-figure mapper — `bridge-figures.md` (the single highest-value finding class; includes role-context tension scoring)
3. Document parser — `document-parsing.md`
4. Corporate-jurisdiction verifier — `corporate-jurisdiction.md`
5. Knowledge-graph version updater — `graph-integration.md` (includes holographic validation protocol)
6. Handoff generator — `handoff-generation.md`
7. Visualization artifact generator — `visualization-artifacts.md`

Plus cross-cutting modules: `epistemic-tiers.md` (the credibility gate, with tension-tier formalism) and `s-class-taxonomy.md` (WFGY 3.0 structural parallel vocabulary).

Load-bearing invariants that edits MUST preserve:

- **Four epistemic tiers** (`confirmed` / `high` / `medium` / excluded) with strict graph-admission rules: only `confirmed` and `high` enter the graph. The audit-gate pseudocode in `epistemic-tiers.md` is referenced elsewhere — if you change tier names, update every reference.
- **Apophenia audit** (5 checks: tier, bridge-figure, chain, counter-evidence, novelty) runs before delivery. This is the credibility firewall; don't weaken it.
- **File discipline** — paths like `/mnt/project/`, `/home/claude/<thread-name>/`, `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` inside SKILL.md describe the **runtime sandbox** where the skill executes, *not* this repo. Don't "fix" them to local paths when editing the skill.
- **No case-study-specific names in documentation.** Examples in reference modules use generic placeholders (Subject A, Institution X, Year 0 / Year 13). Do not reintroduce named real individuals when expanding examples.

└── scripts/holographic_validation.py      # WFGY Semantic Holography implementation
```

The `convergence-investigation-2.skill/` name keeps the `.skill` suffix so it can be directly linked into your skills directory (e.g., `~/.claude/skills/convergence-investigation` or similar). If renaming or flattening, update the root `README.md` installation section and the link anchors in its Documentation section.

## Operations

No commands to run. There is no test runner; `holographic_validation.py` has an `if __name__ == "__main__"` illustrative example and no test harness — run it directly (`python3 convergence-investigation-2.skill/scripts/holographic_validation.py`) to sanity-check changes to the holographic metrics.

## Editing conventions

- SKILL.md frontmatter fields (`name`, `description`, `version`) are referenced by the Claude Code skill loader — preserve their structure. `description` is the trigger text the model sees; edits to it change when the skill fires.
- Reference modules are written in close-packed prose with inline code blocks for JSON schemas and Python snippets. Keep the tone; these are read by the model at runtime and verbosity costs tokens.
- When adding a new sub-method or reference module, update: (1) the "Seven Sub-Methods" table in SKILL.md, (2) the "Reference modules" list at the bottom of SKILL.md, (3) the root `README.md` Documentation section.
