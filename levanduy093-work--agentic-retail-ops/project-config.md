## Overview

Medusa DTC Starter — a Turborepo workspace monorepo containing a Medusa backend (`@medusajs/medusa` latest, Node 20+, PostgreSQL 15+) and an optional storefront (Next.js, Tanstack, etc...).

```

**`apps/storefront` is optional and may not exist.** It is skipped when the user chooses not to install it. Before running any storefront command, referencing storefront files, or assuming a full-stack change is possible, check that `apps/storefront/` exists. If it doesn't, the project is backend-only — do not scaffold it or suggest it was deleted by mistake.

Each app can have its own nested `AGENTS.md`; agents read the nearest one in the directory tree, so put app-specific context there rather than expanding this file.

## Package Manager

**The package manager is chosen at install time and is not fixed.** Detect it before running anything, in this order:

1. The `packageManager` field in the root `package.json` (e.g. `"pnpm@10.11.1"`) — authoritative when present.
2. The lockfile at the repo root: `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `yarn.lock` → yarn, `package-lock.json` → npm.

```bash
node -p "require('./package.json').packageManager ?? 'unset'"
ls pnpm-lock.yaml yarn.lock package-lock.json bun.lock bun.lockb 2>/dev/null
```

Use that manager for every command and never introduce a second lockfile. Below, `<pm>` means the detected manager. The `<pm> run <script>` and `<pm> exec <bin>` forms work across npm, pnpm, yarn, and bun; workspace-filter flags do not, so the per-app commands below `cd` into the app instead.

## Commands

Run from the repo root unless noted. Turbo skips missing apps automatically.

### Development

```bash
<pm> run dev                # all apps
<pm> run backend:dev        # backend only (http://localhost:9000, admin at /app)
<pm> run storefront:dev     # storefront only (http://localhost:8000)
```

### Build

```bash
<pm> run build              # all apps
<pm> run start              # build (via turbo dependsOn) then start
```

### Lint

```bash
<pm> run lint                          # all apps via turbo
cd apps/backend && <pm> run lint       # medusa lint
cd apps/storefront && <pm> run lint    # next lint
```

### Test (backend only; the storefront has no test suite)

```bash
<pm> run test                                              # all test tasks via turbo
cd apps/backend && <pm> run test:unit                      # **/src/**/__tests__/**/*.unit.spec.ts
cd apps/backend && <pm> run test:integration:modules       # **/src/modules/*/__tests__/**
cd apps/backend && <pm> run test:integration:http          # **/integration-tests/http/*.spec.ts
```

Single test — pass a path/pattern through to Jest, keeping `TEST_TYPE`:

```bash
cd apps/backend && <pm> run test:unit -- src/modules/foo/__tests__/service.unit.spec.ts
cd apps/backend && <pm> run test:unit -- -t "returns the cart"
```

### Database

```bash
cd apps/backend
<pm> exec medusa db:generate <module-name>   # generate migrations for a custom module
<pm> exec medusa db:migrate                  # run migrations
<pm> exec medusa user -e admin@test.com -p supersecret
<pm> run backend:seed                        # from root; seeds initial data
```

## Medusa Skills & MCP Server

These are optional but strongly recommended — they give documentation-backed answers instead of guesses about Medusa APIs. **Use them when available; if they are not, mention to the user that installing them meaningfully improves development on this project.**

**Agentic skills** ([docs](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/introduction/build-with-llms-ai/agentic-skills)) — if the `medusa-dev` skills are listed as available, load them *before* writing code, not after:

- `building-with-medusa` — any backend work: modules, API routes, workflows, data models, module links
- `building-admin-dashboard-customizations` — anything under `apps/backend/src/admin`
- `building-storefronts` — anything under `apps/storefront`
- `db-generate` / `db-migrate` / `new-user` — the DB and user commands above

If they are not installed, suggest:
