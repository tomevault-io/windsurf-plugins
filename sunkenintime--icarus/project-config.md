description: When modifying Dart code that uses build_runner code generation (.g.dart, .freezed.dart). Edit source files only—never edit generated files directly. Run build_runner after changes.
---


Use the appropriate channels and make your changes in the source files that generate the code. If you need to modify anything that appears in a generated file (such as `.g.dart`), update the original source file instead — never edit generated files directly.  

After making changes, run:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
