# Yodecomp — decompilation cheat sheet

In general, you can adhere to patterns found in `OpenJKDF2`, located at `~/workspace/OpenJKDF2`. CMake should be used, and the assumed build platform is macOS and Linux. Claude is permitted to modify this file with any useful notes that will aid other/later Claudes. Use `wine` to invoke Windows toolchains and executables.

### External references
- **`~/workspace/DesktopAdventures`** — the user's own engine recreation of the *Desktop Adventures* engine (Yoda Stories / Indiana Jones' Desktop Adventures). Invaluable for asset-format and game-logic semantics when naming functions/structs. Notably `scrdoc.txt` = reverse-engineered **script opcode format** (pre-script conditions like `BumpTile`, `CheckEndItem`, `EnemyDead`, `HasItem`, `HealthLs`…), plus `SCRIPTS.md`, `README.md`. Use it to name `.DTA`/zone/script parsing code. The 10×10 grid at World+0x4B4 (stride 0x34/zone) is the map's zone grid.

## Naming Convention and Decompiling Tips

In general, variable names should follow a loose-Hungarian Notation, where pointers start with `p` (ie, `pThing`), pointers to arrays are prefixed with `pa` (ie `paIndices`), booleans are prefixed with `b` (ie, 'Main_bMotsCompat'). Name a pointer after the **struct it points to**, not its MFC role. **⭐ v50: the doc and view classes were
RENAMED to their ORIGINAL names — `CDeskcppDoc` (was aliased `World`) and `CDeskcppView` (was `GameView`) —
known with certainty from the binary's `CRuntimeClass.m_lpszClassName` strings ("CDeskcppDoc"/"CDeskcppView";
the original MFC project was "Deskcpp" = Desktop Adventures). Source + Ghidra struct + Ghidra namespace all
renamed.** VARIABLE names keep the readable game-concept form (we don't know the original's variable names):
the `CDeskcppDoc` pointer is still **`pWorld`**, NOT `doc`/`pDoc`/`pCDeskcppDoc` (e.g. `CDeskcppView.pWorld@0x44`);
a `CDeskcppView` pointer is `pView`, etc. (So class = original `CDeskcppDoc`; pointer = readable `pWorld`.)

**Function naming = C++ `Namespace::Method`.** This is a C++/MFC app, so group
functions by their **class** as a Ghidra namespace and give the method a bare name — **do NOT repeat the
group in the method**: `Canvas::BlitMasked` (not `Canvas::Canvas_BlitMasked` / flat `Canvas_BlitMasked`),
`GameView::RemoveItem`, `World::Load`, `Zone::GetTile`.

⚠️ **CRITICAL: the namespace name MUST equal the struct name — Ghidra derives a `__thiscall` function's
auto-`this` type from its parent namespace by matching it to a same-named `Structure`.** Put a doc method in
a `Dta` namespace (no `Dta` struct) and its `this` silently degrades to `void*` (offsets instead of
`this->field`). So **namespace = the C++ class, not a sub-module.** The whole **doc translation unit**
(`CDeskcppDoc` = our `World` struct: `.dta` load/parse + worldgen + `.wld` save + inventory/UI) lives in the
**`World`** namespace; the **view** (`CDeskcppView` = `GameView`) in **`GameView`**. Sub-modules like "Dta"
or "Worldgen" are a *documentation* concept (docs/compile-units.md), **not** namespaces — an early attempt to
make `Dta::`/`Worldgen::` namespaces broke `this=World*` and was folded back into `World`.

Namespaces in the DB now: **class** namespaces (`World`,`GameView`,`Zone`,`Canvas`,`Tile`,`ZoneObj`,
`MapEntity`,`Puzzle`,`IactScript`,`InvScrollBar`,…) — `this` types correctly; and **CU/module** namespaces
for genuinely separate `.obj`s that aren't a modeled struct (`GameData`,`Iact`,`App`,`Settings`,`Frame`,
`Dlg`,`Log`,`Mfc`,`Render`) — their `__thiscall` members show `void* this` until/unless the class is modeled
as a struct (then move them or `set_function_this_type`). Global leftovers are only `FUN_*` (undiscovered),
`FID_*` (MFC library), and import thunks. Migration was done with idempotent `run_script_inline` loops over
`fm.getFunctions` (longest-prefix→namespace map, collision→append addr; then a residual self-prefix strip).
Loose-Hungarian still applies to the bare method + variables (`Draw*`, `p`/`b`/`n`). When you `set_function_
this_type X*`, Ghidra moves the func into namespace `X` automatically — so typing and namespacing are one act.

**Prefer a descriptive guess over `FUN_<addr>` — mark uncertainty with `Maybe`.** A name derived from what a
function *accesses/calls* (even a vague one) is more useful than an anonymous `FUN_*`, and it refines over
time. When the behaviour is clear but the exact purpose isn't, append **`Maybe`**: e.g. `World::InitUiMaybe`,
`GameView::DrawStatusMaybe`. This is the standing signal that the name is a hypothesis to confirm/sharpen
later (grep `Maybe` to find them). Only leave `FUN_<addr>` when you genuinely can't tell what it touches. 
Still avoid *confidently wrong* names (the `BlitWeaponBox` miss) — read the body first; `Maybe` is for honest
"looks like X" guesses, not unread ones.
