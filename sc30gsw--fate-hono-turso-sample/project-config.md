# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## Behavioral Guidelines

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Architecture

Bun workspaces monorepo. See `README.md` for the table.

**One Hono process serves the entire backend.** `@app/api` (`:3002`) mounts:
- `/api/auth/*` — Better Auth handler
- `/fate/*`     — fate native HTTP transport (queries + mutations + live SSE), via `createHonoFateHandler(fate)` with `app.all("/fate/*", ...)` per the [official fate example](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/fate/blob/main/example/server-drizzle/src/index.tsx).

The Vite dev server (`@app/client`, `:5173`) proxies both `/api/*` and `/fate/*` to `:3002`, so the browser sees same-origin cookies for Better Auth.

**Stack:** Bun 1.3.9 · React 19.2 (Compiler enabled via `babel-plugin-react-compiler` in `packages/client/vite.config.ts`) · Vite (+ `vite-tsconfig-paths` for cross-workspace `~/*` resolution) · TanStack Router · TanStack Form · fate (`@nkzw/fate` + `react-fate`) · Hono (HTTP framework hosting fate + Better Auth) · Drizzle (libSQL/Turso) · Better Auth · valibot · vite-plus / fallow / react-doctor.

## Conventions

All conventions live in `.claude/rules/`. Phase 1 highlights Claude should not violate:

- File naming: kebab-case (`user-card.tsx`). **No `index.ts` / `index.tsx`** in source dirs — use named files (`auth.ts`, `db.ts`, `home.tsx`). See `.claude/rules/typescript/no-index-files.md`. Hook-enforced.
- Forms: TanStack Form + valibot (no adapter). `form.state.isSubmitting` for pending state, `formApi.setErrorMap({ onSubmit: { form, fields } })` for server errors — no `useState`/`useTransition`/`useMutation`. See `.claude/rules/typescript/form-pattern.md`.
- Imports: `~/` alias inside `packages/client/src/` (configured in `tsconfig.base.json`); no relative paths
- Types: `type` only — `interface` is banned (hook-enforced)
- Exports: named only; `export default` allowed only in `src/routes/*` and `*.config.ts` (hook-enforced)
- Errors (client): no `try-catch` in `packages/client/` (hook-enforced). fate mutations return `{ error, result }` — check `result.error`. Throw for unexpected bugs (error boundary catches).
- Errors (server): `throw new HTTPException(code, { message })` from `hono/http-exception` + `app.onError`
- React: function declarations for components/hooks; no manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` (Compiler handles it)
- Comments: explain *why*, never *what*

**`.claude/settings.json` runs PostToolUse hooks** on every Edit/Write: `vp fmt`, `vp check`, plus the bans above. Violations surface as warnings in tool output — fix on sight, don't ignore.

## Stack Rules

- **fate** — see `.claude/rules/fate-best-practices.md`. Server module lives at
  `packages/api/src/modules/fate/fate.ts`; the Vite plugin references it via
  `module: '../api/src/modules/fate/fate.ts'`.

- **Hono** — see `.claude/rules/hono-best-practices.md`. Single Hono app inside
  `packages/api/src/api.ts` composes auth + health + fate via `.route()` /
  `.all("/fate/*", ...)`. Add new feature modules under `packages/api/src/modules/`.
