# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Canine is a Rails-based Kubernetes deployment platform that provides an intuitive web interface for managing applications on Kubernetes clusters. The application uses Rails 7.2.2 with PostgreSQL, and GoodJob for background processing.

## Key Commands

### Development Setup & Running
```bash
# Initial setup
bin/setup

# Start development server (includes web, worker, JS, and CSS watchers)
bin/dev

# Start specific services via docker-compose
docker compose up -d
```

### Building Assets
```bash
# Build JavaScript assets
yarn build

# Build CSS (Tailwind)
yarn build:css
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests (excluding system tests)
rake test

# Run all RSpec tests
rake spec

# Run specific test suites
rake spec:models
rake spec:controllers
rake spec:services
rake spec:jobs
rake spec:actions
rake spec:system

# Run a specific test file
bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb

# Run tests with specific line number
bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb:42
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Ruby linting
bin/rubocop

# Auto-fix linting issues
bin/rubocop -a

# Security scanning
bin/brakeman
```

### Database
```bash
# Run migrations
rails db:migrate

# Reset test database
rails db:test:prepare

# Access Rails console
rails console
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Models** (`app/models/`): Domain entities including User, Account, Project, Cluster, Service, Deployment, Build
   - Projects belong to accounts and connect to Git repositories
   - Services define deployable applications within projects
   - Deployments track individual deployment instances
   - Builds handle Docker image creation

2. **Background Jobs** (`app/jobs/`): GoodJob workers for async operations
   - `BuildJob`: Builds Docker images from source
   - `DeployJob`: Deploys applications to Kubernetes
   - `WebhookJob`: Handles Git webhooks
   - `MetricsJob`: Collects cluster metrics
   - Jobs use LightService actions for complex workflows

3. **Services** (`app/services/`): Business logic and external integrations
   - `KubernetesService`: Kubernetes API client wrapper
   - `DockerService`: Docker operations
   - `GitService`: Git repository operations
   - `HelmService`: Helm chart management

4. **Actions** (`app/actions/`): LightService-based action classes for composable workflows
   - Build workflows: clone repo, build image, push to registry
   - Deploy workflows: create K8s resources, update deployments
   - Organized by feature (builds/, deploys/, projects/)

5. **Kubernetes Integration** (`resources/k8/`): 
   - YAML templates for deployments, services, ingresses
   - Script generators for Kubernetes manifests
   - Support for multiple deployment strategies

### Frontend Architecture

- **Hotwire Stack**: Turbo + Stimulus for reactive UI without complex JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESBuild**: JavaScript bundling
- **Stimulus Controllers** (`app/javascript/controllers/`): Handle client-side interactions

### Authentication & Authorization

- Devise for authentication
- Pundit for authorization policies
- Account-based multi-tenancy

### External Integrations

- GitHub/GitLab webhooks for automated deployments
- Docker registry support (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry)
- Kubernetes cluster management via kubeconfig
- DNS providers (Cloudflare) for domain management

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**: Create feature branches from `main`
2. **Testing**: Write specs for new functionality, especially for services and actions
3. **Background Jobs**: Test async operations with `perform_now` in specs
4. **Kubernetes Resources**: Update templates in `resources/k8/` for deployment changes
5. **Migrations**: Use strong migrations practices for zero-downtime deployments
6. **Linting**: Always run `rubocop -A` at the end of every development cycle
7. **Testing**: If you are going to create a spec, make sure to run it at the end of the development cycle. Don't write specs for validations or associations. Don't create many specs, keep them short and test multiple things in a single spec if it is conveniant
8. **API**: Any changes to the api should go into /api/v1 and try to mirror the controller structure and routes in the app. Any updates, make sure to update the swagger tests as well

## Important Patterns

- **Service Objects**: Encapsulate complex business logic in service classes
- **LightService Actions**: Use for multi-step workflows with error handling
- **GoodJob Jobs**: All long-running operations should be async
- **Kubernetes Client**: Always use `KubernetesService` wrapper, not direct client
- **Error Handling**: Use Rails error tracking and structured logging
- **Testing**: Focus on service/action specs for business logic, request specs for APIs
