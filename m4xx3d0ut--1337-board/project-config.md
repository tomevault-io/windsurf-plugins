description: This repository now contains the 1337 Board Android IME prototype. `SCOPE.md` remains the product and phasing source of truth. Android source lives in `app/src/main/java/org/leetboard/ime/`, with the IME service under `ime/`, core logic under `engine/` and `model/`, and UI surfaces under `ui/`. Android resources are in `app/src/main/res/`; IME metadata is in `app/src/main/res/xml/method.xml`. Unit tests live in `app/src/test/`.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository now contains the 1337 Board Android IME prototype. `SCOPE.md` remains the product and phasing source of truth. Android source lives in `app/src/main/java/org/leetboard/ime/`, with the IME service under `ime/`, core logic under `engine/` and `model/`, and UI surfaces under `ui/`. Android resources are in `app/src/main/res/`; IME metadata is in `app/src/main/res/xml/method.xml`. Unit tests live in `app/src/test/`.

Treat `.codex/`, `.android-sdk/`, `local.properties`, `.gradle/`, and `app/build/` as local generated state unless explicitly asked to change them.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `./gradlew assembleDebug` builds the debug APK.
- `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` runs JVM unit tests.
- `./gradlew lintDebug` runs Android lint for the debug variant.
- `./gradlew assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest lintDebug` is the current local green gate.
- `scripts/setup-android-sdk.sh` installs an ignored local Android SDK when the host does not provide one.
- `scripts/validate-ime-smoke.sh` builds, installs, enables/selects the IME, and launches diagnostics on a connected emulator or device.

The project expects Android SDK platform 35 and build tools 35.0.0. If no system SDK exists, use an ignored local SDK and point `local.properties` at it.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use Kotlin with four-space indentation and official Kotlin style. Classes and composables use `PascalCase`; functions, properties, and package names use `camelCase` or lowercase package segments. Keep Android package paths under `org.leetboard.ime`. Prefer small engine classes with explicit data models over ad hoc UI logic.

## Testing Guidelines

Add JVM tests in `app/src/test/` for layout selection, text-context privacy rules, key action behavior, and customization validation. Add instrumentation tests once emulator access is available. Sensitive input behavior must be covered before enabling speech or swipe typing.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

There is no committed history yet. Use short, imperative commit messages such as `Add IME scaffold` or `Implement numpad toggle`. Pull requests should include a summary, linked scope item, screenshots or recordings for UI/IME behavior, and the exact Gradle/WorkerBee checks run.

## Agent-Specific Instructions

Preserve user changes and avoid unrelated cleanup. Report long-running implementation progress through Agent PBX. For feature slices, build, test, lint, and run emulator/WorkerBee validation when available before checkpoint commits.
