# CLAUDE.md — Project Knowledge for LLM Chess

## Project Overview

LLM Chess is an LLM-vs-LLM chess arena, tournament gauntlet, and benchmark app. Built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand, and chess.js. Optional Tauri desktop wrapper.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **State:** Zustand with `persist` middleware (localStorage)
- **Chess:** chess.js for move validation/board state
- **Stockfish:** Web Worker-based engine for eval and AI opponent
- **LLM Providers:** OpenRouter, OpenAI, Ollama (local), Codex (device auth)
- **TTS:** Local Python server or cloud API (Qwen)
- **Desktop:** Optional Tauri bridge (`src/tauri-bridge.ts`)

### Key Patterns

- **Game Runtime:** `runtime.ts` is the central game loop. It handles 5 player types (stockfish, oracle, replay, human, LLM) in a single `gameLoop()` method. Emits `GameEvent`s processed by `reducer.ts`.
- **State Flow:** Runtime emits events -> reducer produces new GameState -> store subscribers update UI.
- **Event Log:** All game events are appended to `GameState.eventLog` (immutable array spreads).
- **LLM Clients:** Factory pattern via `createLLMClient()`. Each client implements `callChat()`, `requestCommentary()`, `requestCommentaryStream()`, `listModels()`.
- **Tournament Store:** Largest store (~1474 lines). Manages matches, pairs, games, auto-play, and persistence via `syncToMap`.
- **Module Singletons:** Stockfish instances, commentary queue callbacks, and various counters are module-level `let` variables. Fragile during HMR.

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start dev server (Vite)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

## Known Issues (from CODE_REVIEW.md)

### Critical Bugs to Be Aware Of
1. **runtime.ts:480** — LLM retry loop never enforces `maxRetries`. Infinite retries on persistent illegal moves.
2. **runtime.ts:264+** — `isCheckmate` hardcoded to `false` in all MoveApplied events.
3. **oracle-player.ts:68** — SAN vs UCI notation comparison never matches. Oracle correction always enters fallback.
4. **response-toolkit.ts:131** — `processCompromisedDeclaration` hardcodes White as winner.
5. **openai.ts:189, openrouter.ts:179** — Checks `onToken` instead of `isStreaming`, causing JSON-as-SSE parsing.
6. **benchmarkStore.ts:175-213** — Race condition in `recordGame` loses data on concurrent calls.
7. **mapper.ts:206** — Centipawn loss computed incorrectly (absolute eval, not delta from best move).
8. **stockfish.ts:374** — `formatEval` mate display has identical ternary branches (copy-paste bug).

### Systemic Issues
- **~500 lines of code duplication** across LLM clients (readStream, callWithRetry, commentary) and components (GameControls/TournamentSetup share PlayerSlotEditor, types, constants).
- **O(n^2) event log growth** from `[...state.eventLog, event]` on every event in the reducer.
- **API keys in plaintext localStorage** with no encryption or expiration.
- **Non-deterministic game logic** (`Math.random()` without seed) makes benchmarks non-reproducible.
- **Module-level mutable state** (singletons, counters) breaks during HMR and complicates testing.

### Performance Hotspots
- Tournament state: deep spreading (3-4 levels) on every game event.
- Multiple unmemoized derived computations in components (Leaderboard, TournamentProgress, LiveStats).
- Stockfish eval handler duplicated in 3 places.
- `utils/export.ts:542` — O(n^2) game lookup in tournament JSON export.

## Development Notes

- No test suite exists. Manual testing only.
- ESLint is configured but several `eslint-disable` comments mask real dependency issues (especially in effects).
- The `tournamentStore.ts` file is the most complex and bug-prone. Handle with care.
- Stockfish runs in Web Workers. The singleton pattern means two instances max (eval + player).
- The commentary system uses a queue with batching, filler generation, and optional TTS narration gating.
