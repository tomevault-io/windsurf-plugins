This is a development environment for container-use, a CLI tool that provides containerized environments for coding agents.

container-use is designed to work with MCP-compatible agents like Claude Code and Cursor.

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:

- Build: Use 'go build -o container-use ./cmd/container-use' or 'dagger call build --platform=current export --path ./container-use'
- Test: Run 'go test ./...' for all tests, 'go test -short ./...' for unit tests only, or 'go test -count=1 -v ./environment' for integration tests
- Format: Always run 'go fmt ./...' before committing
- Lint: Run 'dagger call lint' to check for linting issues
- Dependencies: Run 'go mod download' to install dependencies, 'go mod tidy' to clean up

MANUAL STDIO TESTING:
- IMPORTANT: container-use cannot be manually tested in its own /workdir. First initialize a new git repository elsewhere on disk (e.g., /tmp/test-repo) and manually test from there
- Test stdio interface: Use 'echo $request | timeout $seconds container-use stdio' where:
  - $request is a JSON-formatted MCP request (e.g., '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ping","id":1}')
  - $seconds is timeout duration (e.g., 10 for 10 seconds)
  - Example: 'echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ping","id":1}' | timeout 10 container-use stdio'
- For multiline requests, use printf or a here-doc instead of echo
- Use 'jq' to format JSON responses for readability: '... | jq .'
- Common test requests:
  - Ping: '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ping","id":1}'
  - List tools: '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'
  - Initialize: '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{}}},"id":1}'

DAGGER MODULE (more details in .dagger/):

- Build: 'dagger call build export --path ./container-use'
- Test: 'dagger call test' or 'dagger call test --integration=false'

PROJECT STRUCTURE:

- cmd/container-use: Main CLI application entry point
- environment/: Core environment management logic
- mcpserver/: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation
- examples/: Example configurations and usage
- docs/: Documentation and images
- .dagger/: Dagger module configuration

DOCS:

- Documentation is in `./docs`, written using Mintlify
- When making changes, make sure the files are properly formatted in mdx
- To start a preview, run `mint dev` from the docs folder

<!-- container-use-rules -->
ALWAYS use ONLY Environments for ANY and ALL file, code, or shell operations—NO EXCEPTIONS—even for simple or generic requests.

DO NOT install or use the git cli with the environment_run_cmd tool. All environment tools will handle git operations for you. Changing ".git" yourself will compromise the integrity of your environment.

You MUST inform the user how to view your work using `container-use log <env_id>` AND `container-use checkout <env_id>`. Failure to do this will make your work inaccessible to others.
