# Using these skills outside Claude Code

Every skill in this repository is plain markdown that follows the open Agent Skills format (https://agentskills.io). Nothing here depends on Claude Code internals, so the same files work in any agent that can read instructions from disk.

## Claude Code

Install as a plugin (recommended):

```
/plugin marketplace add Thibaultbm/claude-seo-geo
/plugin install claude-seo-geo@sorank
```

Or copy skills manually:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Thibaultbm/claude-seo-geo.git
cp -r claude-seo-geo/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cline, Aider and others

1. Clone the repository somewhere stable.
2. Point your agent at the skill you need: paste the relevant `SKILL.md` into context, or reference its path in your rules file (`.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, etc).
3. The `references/` files inside each skill are meant to be loaded on demand: load them when the SKILL.md says so, not upfront.
4. The executables in the repository are `skills/seo-geo-audit/scripts/seo_audit.py`, `skills/seo-page-sections/scripts/section_audit.py`, and the two vault-audit scripts in `skills/obsidian-brain/scripts/` (`link_graph.py`, `person_matches.py`). All are pure Python standard library (Python 3.9+), read only, no packages to install, no API keys.
