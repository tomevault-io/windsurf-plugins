# Project Structure Convention

This rule describes the project structure and organization of the AI Primitives platform.

## Applies to
**/*

## Rule
The project is organized as a monorepo using pnpm workspaces with the following structure:

```
ai/
├── api/                  # API implementations for various services
├── app/                  # Application code
│   ├── (apis)/           # API route handlers
│   ├── (websites)/       # Website components
│   └── (payload)/        # Payload CMS admin configurations
├── collections/          # Collection definitions
│   ├── ai/               # AI-related collections (Functions, Workflows, Agents)
│   ├── data/             # Data model collections (Things, Nouns, Verbs)
│   ├── events/           # Event-related collections (Triggers, Searches, Actions)
│   └── observability/    # Monitoring collections (Generations)
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
├── content/              # Content files and assets (MDX files at /content/**/*.mdx)
├── examples/             # Example implementations
├── lib/                  # Library code and utilities
├── pkgs/                 # Shared packages and libraries (can have dependencies)
│   ├── ai-models/        # AI model abstractions and selection
│   ├── deploy-worker/    # Cloudflare Workers deployment utilities
│   └── clickable-links/  # API handler utilities
├── sdks/                 # Software Development Kits (zero dependencies except apis.do)
├── tasks/                # Task implementations with dependencies
├── tests/                # Test suites
├── websites/             # Website implementations
├── workers/              # Cloudflare Workers implementations
```

### Implementation Guidelines
- Respect the monorepo architecture using pnpm workspaces
- Place new code in the appropriate directory based on its purpose
- Follow the naming conventions outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md
- SDK implementations in `/sdks/` must maintain zero dependencies (except apis.do) to be publishable on npm
- Backend implementations of SDK features should be placed in the `/tasks/` folder with workspace-level dependencies
- Package entry points in package.json files should point to built files (e.g., dist/index.js) rather than source files
