# AGENTS.md — Video Studio

> For AI agents (Hermes, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Grok) entering this project.

## Project identity

Video Studio is a web dashboard + ffmpeg backend for AI-assisted video production. It produces narrated explainer videos from scripts and AI-generated b-roll. The dashboard is the primary collaboration tool between the human and the agent.

## Entry protocol

When entering this project, do these in order:

1. **Read `MEMORY.md`** — operational state, active features, known bugs, server command
2. **Load skill `video-studio-e2e`** (`skill_view(name='video-studio-e2e')`) — canonical 11-step PDF→video workflow, placa design evolution, character sheets, prompt engineering guide
3. **Check Kanban board** `video-studio` — active/blocked/triage cards
4. **Check wiki** `~/wiki/projects/video-studio/` — research notes, design docs
5. **Verify server** is running on `:8900`:
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://127.0.0.1:8900/
   # expect 200
   ```

## Server command

```bash
HERMES_HOME=/home/nicolas/.hermes /home/nicolas/Projects/video-studio/.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8900
```

## Critical rules

### Never do a full project render without asking
Scene partials and individual renders are fine. But `concat_scenes()` + `painterly_filter()` for the full project must be confirmed with Nicolás first.

### Server must restart after ANY code change
FastAPI StaticFiles caches `index.html` at startup. After any change to `app/static/index.html`, restart the server.

### Every change must have tests
Run `pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_e2e.py -q` before declaring done.

### Never delete previous generations
Save every iteration. Move old files to `*_iterN/` directories. Each project iteration gets its own dashboard project slug.

### Don't claim something works without verifying
Check actual state with tools (DOM inspection, ffprobe, API calls), not visual screenshots. The subtitle track at 10px font is invisible in screenshots — query `.timeline-sub-block` count in the DOM instead.

## Architecture constraints

- **Audio-first**: scene duration = narration audio duration. Timeline shorter? Black padding. Longer? Truncated by `-shortest`.
- **No video loops**: pre-extend with `video_extend()` (ping-pong). The filter chain has no loop filter.
- **No zoom_in**: zoom_out only on stills, auto-calcs speed to land at native 1.0.
- **Placas max 3-4 per scene**: ffmpeg filter_complex times out >120s with 6+ overlays.
- **Placa alpha**: requires `format=rgba` before `colorchannelmixer=aa=0.7`.
- **Video ambient audio**: mix at 20% gain with TTS narration. Prompt: "No music. Ambient nature sounds only."

## Prompt engineering (Grok Imagine)

- **SCENE first, Style: last** — Grok interprets linearly
- **Character sheets**: embed verbatim in every prompt. Painterly language, not catalog descriptions. Color triad (3 distinctive items). "Small against landscape."
- **No clinical cues, no hype, no magic frequencies**
- **Imagination scenes**: camera LOCKED STILL, painting breathes
- **Reality scenes**: camera MOTION (gentle pan, slow tilt)
- **Critical trap**: "blurred faces" → faceless figures. "rainbow arc" → vivid double-rainbow. "painted faces" → face paint.

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app/main.py` | FastAPI server, all endpoints, SSE bridge |
| `app/static/index.html` | Dashboard (~5600 lines vanilla JS) |
| `lib/assemble.py` | ffmpeg compositor: filter chain, audio mixing |
| `lib/motion.py` | 8 motion presets for stills |
| `lib/tts.py` | Edge TTS + SRT generation |
| `lib/gen_bridge.py` | Agent → dashboard image registration |
| `projects/<slug>/storyboard.json` | Scene definitions, asset timelines |
| `projects/<slug>/MEMORY.md` | Per-project operational state |
| `assets/fonts/` | InterTight-Bold + Inter-Regular (bundled) |

## Known bugs (2026-06-15)

- Subtitle track DOM elements render correctly but are hard to see (10px font, low contrast). Verify with DOM query, not visual.
- `\n` in Python source strings renders as literal newline, breaking embedded JS. Use `String.fromCharCode(10)` or `'\\n'`.
