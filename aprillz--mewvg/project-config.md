## Commit message rules

Structure rules (must follow):

* Line 1 (Subject):

  * One concise sentence in imperative mood (e.g., Add, Fix, Refactor).
  * Maximum ~50 characters when practical.
  * Do NOT end with a period.
* Line 2:

  * Must be completely blank when a body is present.
* Line 3+ (Body, optional):

  * Use bullet points only ("- " prefix).
  * Keep bullets short and factual.
  * Wrap lines at ~72 characters.
  * Omit the body unless it provides important context not already
    expressed by the subject.
  * Do not add a body merely because multiple lines or files changed.
  * For a single, well-scoped change, prefer the subject alone.

Content rules:

* Use clear, technical English.
* Prefer minimal verbosity.
* Describe only facts directly supported by the diff or explicitly
  provided context.
* Do not infer motivation, intent, benefits, behavioral effects, or
  architectural significance.
* State WHY or IMPACT only when it is explicitly evident from the diff,
  tests, issue context, or user-provided description.
* When WHY or IMPACT is not explicit, describe only WHAT changed.
* Use project-specific terminology exactly as it appears in the code.
* Avoid vague phrases such as "minor changes" or "misc updates".
* Do not mention tools (Copilot, GPT, IDE, etc.).
* Do not use emojis.

Change grouping rules:

* Identify the single primary change.
* Treat code movement, callback wiring, reference updates, and equivalent
  mechanical edits as part of the primary change.
* Do not list mechanical consequences as separate effects or outcomes.
* Avoid listing multiple observations that stem from the same root change.
* Mention a secondary change only when it is independently meaningful and
  would reasonably warrant mention without the primary change.
* If a property is converted from one property model to another, describe
  that conversion directly instead of enumerating the required callback,
  rendering, or lifecycle updates.

Project context:

* .NET / C#
* Native AOT–focused.
* Performance, startup time, binary size, and simplicity matter.
* UI framework with multiple backends (GDI, Direct2D, OpenGL, X11).

Heuristics:

* Prefer a strong subject line over an explanatory body.
* For cleanup, removal, rename, or refactoring, describe the actual
  structural change rather than an assumed purpose or benefit.
* Do not translate implementation details into claimed user-visible impact.
* Do not claim reduced binary size, simplified interop, improved
  maintainability, improved performance, or corrected behavior unless the
  change directly demonstrates it.
* When uncertain whether a detail is an independent change or a mechanical
  consequence, omit it.
* When the subject fully describes the change, output only the subject.

Output:

* Return ONLY the commit message text.
