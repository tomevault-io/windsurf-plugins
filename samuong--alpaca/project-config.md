# CLAUDE.md — Alpaca

## Project Overview

Alpaca is a local HTTP proxy for command-line tools written in Go. It supports:

- Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) files
- NTLM authentication
- Basic HTTP authentication
- Kerberos/Negotiate authentication (macOS only)
- System keyring integration (macOS, Windows, Linux/GNOME)
- Automatic network switching (bypasses unreachable proxies)

**Module path:** `github.com/samuong/alpaca/v2`
**License:** Apache 2.0

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Build
go build -v .

# Run all tests (CGO_ENABLED=1 is required)
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./...

# Format code
goimports -w .

# Lint
golangci-lint run
```

## Architecture

### Request Handling Pipeline

Requests flow through a middleware chain built in `main.go:createServer`:

1. **AddContextID** — assigns a unique ID to each request via context
2. **ProxyFinder.WrapHandler** — discovers upstream proxy via PAC evaluation
3. **ProxyHandler.WrapHandler** — routes proxy requests (CONNECT or absolute-form URIs); non-proxy requests pass through to the mux
4. **RequestLogger** — logs all requests and responses

### Authentication Chain

Authentication methods are tried in order via `multiauth.go`. The chain is:
Negotiate → NTLM → Basic (matching Chrome's hierarchy). The `*authChain`
type is a *picker*: given the schemes the proxy advertised in its 407
response, plus the proxy hostname, it returns the ordered list of methods
the caller should attempt. `proxy.go` owns the iteration and the
connection-lifecycle invariants:

- CONNECT path (`retryConnectWithAuth`) re-dials the proxy on a fresh TCP
  connection between methods. This is required because NTLM and Negotiate
  are connection-bound (RFC 4559) and must not share a socket with another
  scheme's state machine.
- Plain HTTP path (`retryProxyRequestWithAuth`) gives each method its own
  cloned `*http.Transport` so its connection pool is isolated; the
  underlying `http.Transport` already manages connection reuse for NTLM's
  Type 1 → Type 3 sequence within a single method.
- The header `Proxy-Authorization` is cleared between attempts.
- Any error returned by a method aborts the chain (this is the
  abort-on-error invariant — see test `TestRetryProxyRequest_AbortsChainOnError`).

Negotiate availability is re-checked per-407 via `applicableTo()` rather
than at startup, so a Kerberos ticket that arrives after alpaca starts
(e.g. because Apple SSO finishes after the LaunchAgent launches alpaca,
or because the user runs `kinit` mid-session) is honoured automatically
without a restart.

RFC 9110 alignment: a 407 without a parseable `Proxy-Authenticate`
header is a protocol violation. The picker returns zero candidates in
that case so no credentials of any scheme are sent. Chrome and Firefox
take the same line.

See `multiauth.go` for the picker's host-policy and per-authenticator
applicability rules.

### Key Interfaces

- `proxyAuthenticator` (in `proxy.go`) — implemented by `authenticator`
  (NTLM), `basicAuthenticator`, and `negotiateAuthenticator`. Methods:
  `do(req, rt) (resp, err)`, `scheme()`, `applicableTo(host)`.
- `*authChain` (in `multiauth.go`) — picks the ordered list of
  authenticators to try given the schemes the proxy advertised. NOT a
  `proxyAuthenticator` itself.

## Build & Test

### Requirements

- **Go 1.25.0+**
- **CGO_ENABLED=1** (required for builds and tests)

### Build

```bash
go build -v .
```

Cross-compilation:
```bash
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -v .
```

Version injection at build time:
```bash
go build -v -ldflags "-X 'main.BuildVersion=v1.0.0'" .
```

### Test

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./...
```
