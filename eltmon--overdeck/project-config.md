# Overdeck CLI - Development Guidelines

> **Note:** Universal and dev-scope engineering rules (async tmux, no execSync in server, fake timers, worktree/stash discipline, Karpathy rules, …) live in [`sync-sources/rules/`](sync-sources/rules/) and reach every session via `pan sync` → `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. This file holds only project-specific essentials; everything else is one link away.

> **Knowledge bundle (OKF):** Project knowledge lives in the OKF bundle at [`../overdeck-knowledge`](../overdeck-knowledge) (remote `eltmon/overdeck-knowledge`), pointed to by [`.okf.yml`](.okf.yml). Use `/okf extract "<query>"` to pull cited context and `/okf author`/`/okf sync`/`/okf study` to maintain it. Edit through `/okf author`; the upstream viewer does not preserve YAML formatting losslessly.

## Engineering Philosophy

- **No bandaids.** Fix root causes. Never paper over symptoms with fallbacks, special cases, or manual workarounds — every workaround is a bug you chose not to fix. If a tool/test/flow is broken, fix it; don't route around it.
- **Never do agent work — fix the system.** When a pipeline agent produces a bad result, fix the prompt/gate/flow that allowed it. Ask "why did the system allow this?" before touching output.
- **Deliver complete features.** Partial implementation of an issue is zero value; don't signal done until all of it is done.
- **JSONL session files are sacred.** Never delete/truncate `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` — irreversible conversation history.
- **Commit and push when working on main.** Finish a coherent change, verify it builds, commit, push — unpushed local commits cause divergence against the pipeline's merges.

## Critical Operational Facts

- **tmux socket:** agents live on `tmux -L overdeck` (the default socket shows nothing). Attach/capture with `-L overdeck`.
- **Dashboard runs Node 22 dist only — never Bun, never tsx** (`@lydell/node-pty` + circular ESM). `pan up`/`pan reload` handle it; after server changes run `npm run build` first. Startup/triage: [docs/OVERDECK_DEV_SOP.md](docs/OVERDECK_DEV_SOP.md).
- **Releases:** always `pan release stable --version X.Y.Z`, then push main + tag. Never manual tags, `npm version`, or `--no-verify`; hooks enforce it.
- **Deep-wipe** (`POST /api/issues/:id/deep-wipe`) destroys workspace, branches, and tracker state irreversibly. Never call it — or any destructive HTTP request — speculatively.
- **Issue tracker:** GitHub Issues (`PAN-<n>` = `eltmon/overdeck#<n>`), not Linear. Issue→project resolution reads `issue_prefix` in `projects.yaml`.
- **`pan start <id>`** is the paved road: plans if unplanned (`--plan interactive|auto|skip`), then starts work. `pan plan` is plan-only. Verify flags with `pan <verb> --help`.
- **Workspace creation UI:** the sidebar `+`, command-palette action, and per-project button navigate to `/workspaces/new`; project-scoped entry points preselect with `?project=<key>`.

## Project Structure

- **Stack:** TypeScript, Node 22+, React dashboard, SQLite, Effect.js. Package manager: Bun (9 workspaces incl. `packages/contracts`, `packages/effect-acp`, `apps/desktop`).
- **Build:** `npm run build` (tsdown + Vite). **Dev:** `npm run dev`.
- **Quality gates** (must pass before `pan done`): `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
- **Workspaces** are git worktrees at `workspaces/feature-<issue>/` with their own `bun install` — never symlink node_modules. Details: [docs/WORKSPACE-CONTAINERS.md](docs/WORKSPACE-CONTAINERS.md).

## Key Invariants (one-liners)

- The canonical xBRIEF spec on `overdeck-state` is **immutable after planning**; item status lives in the project-side per-issue record's `statusOverrides`. [docs/XBRIEF.md](docs/XBRIEF.md)
- Every state domain has **one read door and one write door**; never touch stores directly. [docs/API-SURFACE.md](docs/API-SURFACE.md)
- The post-merge lifecycle runs **at most once per merge** — keep `tests/unit/lib/cloister/in-flight-guard.test.ts` green. [docs/MERGE-WORKFLOW.md](docs/MERGE-WORKFLOW.md)
- `.claude/agents/` + `.claude/skills/` in worktrees are **sync targets** populated from `sync-sources/`; three shipped subagents hardcode `model: haiku` (breaks on CLIProxy-routed models — prefer built-in `Explore`/`general-purpose` for ad-hoc exploration).
- Pipeline membership, decisions, and workspace tables each have a canonical resolver — never derive independently. [docs/PIPELINE-MEMBERSHIP.md](docs/PIPELINE-MEMBERSHIP.md), [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md), [docs/WORKSPACES-AND-PROJECTS.md](docs/WORKSPACES-AND-PROJECTS.md)
- Project CI state reaches Command Deck rows through the shared read-model event path (`ciByProjectKey` → `/ws/rpc`); webhook observations and server-side REST repair feed it, never frontend polling. [docs/EXTERNAL-EVENT-STREAM.md](docs/EXTERNAL-EVENT-STREAM.md)
