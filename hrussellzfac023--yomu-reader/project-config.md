## Project

よむ is a self-contained Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey userscript for Japanese popup lookup, JPDB mining, local Yomitan dictionaries, OCR, subtitles, YouTube filtering, kanji drilldown, and optional AnkiConnect mining.

## Setup

The saved Codex project may open at `/Users/heru/Documents/Projects/yomu`, but the Git repository is the nested app at `/Users/heru/Documents/Projects/yomu/apps/yomu-reader`. Run Git, npm, release, and worktree commands from this directory or from a worktree created from this repository. Do not ask Codex to create a project worktree from the umbrella folder; it is not a Git repository. When starting a new Codex thread or worktree for Yomu, choose the saved project named `yomu-reader`, not the umbrella `yomu` project.

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
```

Run `check` and test commands directly. Never pipe them to `tail`: zsh reports
the last pipeline command's status by default, so `npm run check | tail` can
look successful after npm failed. Inspect `artifacts/check-logs/` after the
command instead. If a live pipeline is unavoidable, enable `set -o pipefail`
first. See [the 2026-07-18 exit-status incident](docs/dev/check-exit-code-incident-2026-07-18.md).

`artifacts/` is where the check gate writes those logs, and it is on the
repository-hygiene blocklist (`scripts/check-repository-hygiene.mjs`) as well as in
`.gitignore`. Reading it is expected; **committing anything under it is not** — one
tracked file there hard-fails `check:release` for every session in the repository,
which is exactly how a release publish was lost once. Never `git add -A`, `git add -u`,
or `git add artifacts` after a check run.

Use the browser QA audit for regression coverage:

```bash
npm run qa
```

The audit uses deterministic local network responses for repeatable regression runs. Use `.env` for local-only API keys; it is ignored by Git. This workspace has a local Nadeshiko key stored as `NADESHIKO_API_KEY` in `.env` for live example-source QA. `npm run manual:jpdb-live` is the narrow live JPDB key smoke test — it replaced `qa:live`, which this file kept naming for months after the script was gone. Any script that needs live JPDB or third-party data must load `.env` through `scripts/lib/qa-env.mjs` before reading env vars.

For look-and-feel acceptance, do not use mocked fixture screenshots as proof. Fixture pages are only for deterministic behavior assertions and must be labelled as fixtures; visual QA should use the Browser plugin against the actual app or target page, such as `http://127.0.0.1:5174/newtab/`, and interact with visible controls like a user.

## Constraints

- Keep the userscript readable and mostly self-contained. A pinned, documented `@require` is allowed only for small, audited runtime libraries such as `fflate` when it avoids minification/packing and preserves Greasy Fork readability.
- Do not add a backend service for default functionality.
- Do not hardcode API keys, Tailnet URLs, or user secrets.
- Always push completed changes and trigger the relevant redeploy before finishing, unless the user explicitly says not to.
- Preserve iPhone/iPad Tampermonkey friendliness.
- Prefer local/imported data and optional runtime lookups over bundling large datasets.
- Treat external kanji/etymology sources as license-sensitive. Verify licensing and attribution before adding a source.
- Keep visible product naming as `よむ` and the built userscript as `dist/yomu.user.js`.
- The userscript is not the only shipping channel. `scripts/build-extension.mjs` (`npm run build:extension`) packages the same source as the Chrome/Firefox/Safari browser extension that both stores serve, so a change that only works under a userscript manager is incomplete. It needs the UserScript Compiler in the ignored `tools/` directory — see the README.
- When adding user-visible app or website copy, add both English and Japanese entries in `src/reader/app/i18n.ts`, verify Japanese mode does not show `未翻訳`, and rebuild/sync hosted assets so `docs/public/study/app.js` carries the new copy.
- Update `dist/yomu.user.js` by running the build when source changes affect the bundle.
- Greasy Fork limits scripts to 2 MB. `npm run verify` warns when the readable hosted build exceeds that limit, and Greasy Fork upload scripts must still reject oversized uploads. Do not minify, compress, pack, or obfuscate the userscript to fit the limit; Greasy Fork forbids that. If size gets tight, remove duplication, purge unused CSS, prefer runtime/hosted assets for nonessential media such as icons, and avoid bundling large datasets.
- Treat bundle size as architecture, not bookkeeping. Ask: what is the smallest amount of code needed to preserve the feature? Keep common reader behavior generic, and do not add page-specific layout handling unless usage evidence shows it is needed. When code handles a special website shape, isolate it behind a named Adapter and keep the generic path simple.
