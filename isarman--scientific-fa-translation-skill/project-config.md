description: Load scientific Persian translation skill for papers, RTL, and PDFs.

Routing only. The policy lives in the skill; do not restate it here, so
there is one place to change it.

If the user asks to translate a scientific document, article, book, or
technical docs into Persian, or mentions ترجمه علمی, RTL, راست‌چین, PDF, or
چاپ, read `SKILL.md` and follow it. Do not wait for a slash command. If
the user asks whether a finished Persian translation follows the rules,
that is the same skill's review mode.

Cursor chat is not the RTL surface: write a PDF to `/home/$USER/Documents/books` and
keep chat to a short pointer.

Skip this for coding, commits, UI copy, literary translation, and casual
Persian chat.
