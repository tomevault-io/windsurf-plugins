# Flow Routing

INTAKE → PLANNING → DEVELOPMENT → TESTING → DEPLOYMENT → COMPLETE, with HUMAN_FEEDBACK, RETRY_DEVELOPMENT (max 3x), HUMAN_ESCALATION.

- **Planning → Development**: requirements AND architecture both complete
- **Planning → Human Feedback**: requirements ambiguous (e.g. confidence < 0.7)
- **Development → Testing**: code files generated successfully
- **Testing → Deployment**: all tests pass, coverage ≥ threshold
- **Testing → Retry Development**: tests failed, retries remaining (with feedback)
- **Testing → Human Escalation**: retries exhausted or critical failures
- **Deployment → Complete**: packaging successful
- **Any phase → Error**: unrecoverable error with state preservation
