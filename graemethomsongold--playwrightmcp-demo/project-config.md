# Test Automation Framework — Claude Context

## Project Overview
Playwright test automation framework using TypeScript and the Page Object Model (POM) pattern.
This framework operates in an FCA-regulated banking environment. Security and code quality
standards are non-negotiable.

## Page Object Model Rules

- All Page Object classes must extend `BasePage` (`pages/BasePage.ts`)
- `BasePage` provides: cookie consent handling and `goto(path)` navigation — do not duplicate these
- All locators must be defined as `private readonly` properties on the Page Object class
- Page Object constructors accept a Playwright `Page` object and must call `super(page)`
- All page interactions are encapsulated as methods on the Page Object class
- Test files must only call Page Object methods — no direct `page.click()`, `page.fill()` etc. in tests
- If an interaction is needed in a test, create a method for it first

## Naming Conventions

| Artefact          | Convention          | Example          |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Page Object file  | `<Name>Page.ts`     | `LoginPage.ts`   |
| Page Object class | `<Name>Page`        | `LoginPage`      |
| Test file         | `<feature>.spec.ts` | `login.spec.ts`  |
| Auth setup        | `auth.setup.ts`     | —                |
| Utility files     | `camelCase.ts`      | `secrets.ts`     |

---

## Language & Framework

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Test runner:** `@playwright/test`
- **Secrets:** Environment variables or Azure Key Vault via `utils/secrets.ts`
- **Session management:** Playwright `storageState` cached to `.auth/user.json`

---

## Authentication Pattern

- Credentials are **never** hard-coded anywhere in the codebase
- Credentials are **never** included in prompts or context files
- All credentials come from environment variables (`TEST_USERNAME`, `TEST_PASSWORD`)
  or Azure Key Vault at runtime
- Login is performed **once** in `auth.setup.ts` and saved to `.auth/user.json`
- All authenticated test projects depend on the setup project and load `storageState`
- Only dedicated automation accounts are used — never real user or shared credentials

---

## Security Rules

- `.env` and `.auth/` are always in `.gitignore`
- No credentials, tokens, or secrets appear in any committed file
- No production environment testing
- Test accounts have minimum necessary permissions
- If in doubt, ask before generating anything credential-related

---

## Test Execution

- Tests must **never** run in parallel — always run serially, one at a time
- This is critical: the target is a live site that will block or rate-limit concurrent requests
- Ensure `playwright.config.ts` has `workers: 1` and `fullyParallel: false`
- Do not suggest or generate config changes that would enable parallel execution

### Browser strategy

Running the full suite across all three browsers (141+ tests × 3 = 400+ navigations) will
trigger Akamai CDN rate limiting mid-run and cause spurious failures unrelated to the tests.

| Context | Command | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Full suite run (local) | `npx playwright test --project=chromium` | Avoids rate limiting — Chromium is the primary validation browser |
| New Page Object / new tests | `npx playwright test --project=chromium --project=firefox --project=webkit` | Cross-browser locator validation is essential when first writing selectors |
| CI | All browsers (configured in pipeline) | IP rotates per run, so rate limiting is not a concern |

- When running `/run` with no arguments locally, always use `--project=chromium` by default
- When running `/run` after writing or modifying a Page Object or test file, run all three browsers to validate cross-browser compatibility before considering the work done

---

## CI/CD

- Secrets are injected as environment variables — never stored in the repo
- The `.auth/` session file is generated fresh per pipeline run
- Tests run against non-production environments only

---

## Code Style

- Use `async/await` throughout — no promise chains
- Locators use Playwright best-practice selectors (prefer `getByRole`, `getByLabel`,
  `getByTestId` over CSS or XPath where possible)
- All Page Object methods should be `async` and return `Promise<void>` or a typed value
- Use TypeScript strict mode — no `any` types without justification

---

## Playwright MCP Server

When building or exploring tests, always use the Playwright MCP server to interact with the
browser directly. This allows real-time inspection of the live page to discover accurate
locators, validate behaviour, and confirm page structure before writing code.
