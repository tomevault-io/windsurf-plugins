This is a rust project implementing an isolated LLM agent runner (rumpelpod).

- Comments and commit messages should explain "why", not "what".
  Don't paraphrase code next to the comment.
- If you write code, you should commit your changes.
- Every commit must be signed off (`git commit -s`).
- Always run tests via `cargo pipeline`, not `cargo xtest` directly.
  The pipeline records xtest output to `target/xtest/<timestamp>.log`.
  `--continue` parses that log to skip already-passed tests.
  Running xtest directly loses that record.
  The other pipeline steps (fmt, build, clippy, git-status) are cheap.
  `cargo pipeline` is expensive overall because of the tests.
  Run smoke tests first: `enter_smoke_test`, `enter_verifies_user_and_repo_path`, `claude_smoke`, `gateway_pod_commit_triggers_push`, plus tests related to what you changed.
  Changes in src/ that affect the rumpel binary need a full pipeline run after smoke and feature tests pass.
  `cargo pipeline` accepts the same test name regex as `cargo test`, e.g. `cargo pipeline enter_`.
  The pipeline runs all tests to completion even when some fail.
  Use `cargo pipeline --continue` to resume from a previous run, skipping tests that already passed.
  Most individual test cases finish in under 60 seconds with the localhost executor (the default).
  If a test takes longer, suspect a hang rather than normal slowness.
  The full pipeline takes around 300 seconds (including compilation, clippy,
  and ~394 tests).  First run after a clean build is slower (~5 minutes)
  due to compilation.  Subsequent runs reuse cached builds.
  Inside a rumpelpod, a parallel run in an adjacent devcontainer can slow things down.
  If a test fails flakily, rerun it in isolation to confirm before dismissing it as unrelated to your changes.
- xtest is the test runner used by the pipeline.
  It builds cross-architecture binaries, sets up the test environment,
  and runs each test as a separate process with timeouts and retries.
  Flags: `--test-threads N`, `--timeout SECS`, `--retries N`.
  Every test is automatically retried once on failure (subject to a global retry budget).
  Runs all tests to completion even when some fail.
  Tests can override the timeout via `println!("xtest:timeout=N")` at the start of the test function.
- Unless prompted otherwise, don't try to remain backwards compatible.
  Assume all containers/files/databases were created with the current version.
- No unicode (e.g. emojis, em dashes) in comments, code, commit messages etc.
  Only if needed to test unicode support etc.
- Most features should have tests.
  Prefer integration tests/ over unit tests.
- Readers should not require a lot of context to understand tests.
  Some fixtures are OK, but bias towards some duplication across test cases over introducing new helpers.
- Never fall through to a "default" when matching known variants.
  Be explicit about every case and fail hard on unknown values rather than silently continuing in a potentially invalid state.
- You should almost never ignore errors:
  Prefer failing over continuing in degraded state in most cases.
  When an error is expected in normal operation, be as specific about the error as possible.
  E.g. when reading a file that is not expected to exist, ignore only not found errors but not others.
  When there's no choice but to continue after an error has occurred (e.g. in Drop, or while cleaning up after a previous error), log to stderr.
- No local imports (use inside function bodies). Place all imports at module level.
- Multiline strings: Use indoc, formatdoc, printdoc etc.
- Format strings: Prefer the format!("{var}") variant over format!("{}", v).
  Introduce variables if necessary, e.g. let var = var.display(); for paths.
- Prefer explicit control flow over anyhow macros like bail! and ensure!.
- For changes that require testing on macos, log onto a macbook via `ssh macos` and clone your checkout to /tmp/<your-hostname>/rumpelpod.
  If you can't log on but your change should be tested on macos, report to the user.
- Before awaiting review for a patch set, review your change relative to the merge base of your upstream, typically host/master.
  You usually want to spawn a subagent for this.
  Check which files you touched, then invoke git diff once per file.
  Things to look out for:
  Is the latest version internally consistent?
  Clean up left-overs from earlier iterations.
  Comments should describe the code as it exists in the current version, not a change.
