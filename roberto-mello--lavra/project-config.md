# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Claude Code plugin marketplace that provides beads-based persistent memory with compound-engineering's multi-agent workflows. The primary plugin is `lavra`, located at `plugins/lavra/`.

The plugin provides:
- Specialized agents across review, research, design, workflow, and docs categories
- Core commands + optional domain-specific commands (in commands/optional/)
- Skills (core + optional: git-worktree, brainstorming, create-agent-skills, agent-browser, dhh-rails-style, etc.)
- 4 hooks (auto-recall, memory-capture, subagent-wrapup, teammate-idle-check)
- 1 MCP server (Context7 for framework documentation)
- Automatic knowledge capture from beads comments (LEARNED/DECISION/FACT/PATTERN/INVESTIGATION/DEVIATION/SKIP)
- Automatic knowledge recall at session start based on current beads
- Workflow configuration via `.lavra/config/lavra.json` (toggle research, review, goal verification, parallelism)

## Multi-Platform Support

lavra supports OpenCode and Gemini CLI in addition to Claude Code:

**OpenCode:** Core memory system via native TypeScript plugin at `plugins/lavra/opencode/plugin.ts`. Commands/agents/skills are Claude Code-specific. OpenCode reads `AGENTS.md`.

**Gemini CLI:** Full hook compatibility via `gemini-extension.json` manifest. Uses same stdin/stdout JSON protocol as Claude Code.

See README.md for detailed setup instructions.

## Plugin Installation

### Native Plugin System (not done yet)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/roberto-mello/lavra
/plugin install lavra
```

### Manual Install

```bash
# From marketplace root
./install.sh /path/to/target-project

# Or from target project
bash /path/to/lavra/install.sh
```

**IMPORTANT**: The installer will fail if you try to install into the plugin directory itself. Always install into a separate target project.

The installer copies from `plugins/lavra/` into the target's `.claude/` directory:
- `hooks/` -> `.claude/hooks/`
- `commands/` -> `.claude/commands/`
- `agents/` -> `.claude/agents/`
- `skills/` -> `.claude/skills/`
- `.mcp.json` -> `.mcp.json` (merged if exists)
- Configures `settings.json` with hook definitions

### Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh /path/to/target-project
```

## Development Commands

**Test the installer:** (from plugin root)
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/test-project && cd /tmp/test-project
git init && bd init --no-daemon
bash ~/Documents/projects/lavra/install.sh

# Verify
ls -la .claude/hooks/
ls -la .claude/commands/
ls -la .claude/agents/review/
ls -la .claude/skills/
cat .claude/settings.json | jq .
```

**Test uninstaller:**
```bash
bash ~/Documents/projects/lavra/uninstall.sh /tmp/test-project
```

**Test hook format:**
```bash
cat .claude/settings.json | jq '.hooks'
# Should use string matchers, not object matchers:
# Correct: {"matcher": "Bash", "hooks": [...]}
# Wrong:   {"matcher": {"tools": ["BashTool"]}, "hooks": [...]}
```

## Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd backup
   git add .beads/backup/
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
