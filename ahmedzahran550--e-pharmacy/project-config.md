- Use modules to organize your application structure
- Implement a modular architecture with one module per main domain/route
- Separate business logic and persistence into services
- Implement a core module for global filters, middlewares, guards, and interceptors
- Create a shared module for utilities and shared business logic
- Follow SOLID principles and prefer composition over inheritance
- Implement and use dependency injection to manage service dependencies and for better testability
- Use interceptors for cross-cutting concerns like logging and error handling
- Leverage guards for authentication and authorization
- Use pipes for input validation and transformation
- Use DTOs with class-validator for input validation
- Utilize TypeORM for data persistence and define entities
