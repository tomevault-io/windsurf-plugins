description: Introduce all changes on a new branch from master

# New branch required

Do not implement or commit work on `master`. Before making changes, check whether the current
branch already is the requested work.

- If it is, continue on that branch.
- Otherwise, create a new branch from current `master` first (`feat/…` or `fix/…`), then make
  changes there.
- Do not merge or push to `master` unless the user explicitly asks.
