# Live Agent — Development Standards

Full standards are in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md). Key rules:

## Non-negotiable
- The core extension must remain **free to use** with free/local models — no charges from us.
- No `any`. Use `unknown` and narrow. Strict mode is on.
- All local imports need `.js` extensions (ESM/NodeNext).

## Every change must include
- Unit tests for new logic (`*.test.ts` next to source)
- JSDoc on all exported symbols
- README update if public-facing behavior changed
- BACKLOG.md tick-off for completed tasks

## Project-specific
- Webview UI is **React** (functional components + hooks, built with Vite). No class components. No Angular.
- Generated files (`generated-tools.ts`, `generated-executor.ts`) are never edited by hand — run `npm run generate`.
- Errors must be logged and rethrown — never silently swallowed.
- In-extension undo/checkpoints are out of scope (#20–#23); rely on Live's native undo.
