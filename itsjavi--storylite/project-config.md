# AGENTS.md

Guide for AI coding agents working in the StoryLite monorepo.

## What this repo is

StoryLite is a lightweight, Vite-powered alternative to Storybook for HTML, React, Svelte, Vue, and
Solid component stories. The repo is both the product source and the demo site.

Published npm packages live under `@storylite/*`. User-facing docs are in root `README.md`. Human
contributor docs are in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24+
- pnpm 11.2.2 (exact version in root `package.json`)

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Monorepo layout

| Path                    | Purpose                                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/storylite`    | Core CLI, managed Svelte 5 manager app, public config/types API |
| `packages/contracts`    | Shared types and renderer contracts                             |
| `packages/preview-host` | Iframe bootstrap and live CSS mutation API                      |
| `packages/renderer-*`   | Optional framework adapters (react, svelte, vue, solid)         |
| `apps/web`              | Public demo site deployed to GitHub Pages                       |
| `apps/e2e`              | Playwright end-to-end tests for `apps/web`                      |
| `apps/storylite-html`   | Internal HTML story app used in development                     |
| `demos/*`               | Framework-specific demo projects                                |

Workspace filters:

```sh
pnpm -F @storylite/storylite <script>
pnpm -F @storylite/web <script>
pnpm -F @storylite/e2e <script>
```

## Architecture (where to edit what)

```
User project (.storylite/config.ts, *.stories.ts)
        |
        v
packages/storylite/bin/storylite.mjs   # CLI entry, Vite orchestration
        |
        +-- project-graph.mjs           # story discovery, renderer plugins
        +-- static-build.mjs            # static story pages
        +-- customization.mjs         # HTML hook injection
        |
        v
packages/storylite/src/                # Svelte 5 manager UI
        |
        +-- lib/renderers/runtime.ts    # story mounting in iframe/canvas
        +-- lib/storylite/*             # normalization, settings, toolbar
        |
        v
packages/preview-host                  # iframe document bootstrap
packages/contracts                     # StoryLiteStory, renderer adapter types
packages/renderer-*                    # framework-specific client/static renderers
```

### Change guidance

- CLI behavior, dev/build/preview flow: `packages/storylite/bin/`
- Manager UI, sidebar, controls, toolbar: `packages/storylite/src/lib/components/`
- Story format, args, controls, normalization: `packages/contracts` +
  `packages/storylite/src/lib/storylite/`
- Iframe bootstrapping / CSS injection: `packages/preview-host`
- Framework rendering: matching `packages/renderer-*`
- Demo site content and config: `apps/web/.storylite/` and `apps/web/src/`
- Browser regressions: `apps/e2e/tests/apps/web/`

## Common commands

Run from repo root unless noted.

```sh
pnpm dev                 # all workspace dev servers
pnpm dev:web             # apps/web only
pnpm dev:storylite       # core package dev server
pnpm build               # build all workspaces
pnpm build:packages      # packages only
pnpm build:web           # apps/web only
pnpm typecheck           # all workspaces
pnpm format              # write formatting
pnpm format:check        # CI formatting gate
pnpm test                # unit tests (Vitest)
pnpm test:e2e            # Playwright e2e
pnpm qa                  # typecheck + format + build + test + e2e
```

First-time e2e setup:

```sh
pnpm -F @storylite/e2e run e2e:install
```

Scoped examples:

```sh
pnpm -F @storylite/storylite run typecheck
pnpm -F @storylite/storylite run test
pnpm -F @storylite/web run build:pages
```

## Coding conventions

### General

- ESM only (`"type": "module"`).
- TypeScript everywhere except a few `.mjs` CLI helpers.
- Keep diffs focused. Match surrounding style and naming.
- Do not add comments for obvious code.
- Do not over-engineer helpers or defensive branches for unlikely cases.

### Formatting

Use `oxfmt` (root `.oxfmtrc.json`):

- no semicolons
- single quotes
- print width 100
- trailing commas
- `@storylite/*` imports sorted first

Run `pnpm format` before finishing. CI runs `pnpm format:check`.

### Package builds

- Renderer/contract packages build with `tsdown` to `dist/`.
- `@storylite/storylite` ships its source via `exports`; the CLI bundles at runtime with Vite.
- After changing `@storylite/contracts`, rebuild dependent packages before testing consumers.

### Svelte (core manager app)

The manager app uses **Svelte 5** runes (`$props`, `$state`, `$derived`).

When creating or editing `.svelte` files in `packages/storylite`, use the Svelte MCP server tools
for docs lookup and validation when available.

Typecheck the core package with:

```sh
pnpm -F @storylite/storylite run typecheck
```

### StoryLite product constraints

StoryLite is a focused CSF-like subset, not full Storybook. Do not add or assume:

- `play`, loaders, decorators, docs/autodocs, actions, addon APIs
- arbitrary project callbacks in toolbar tools
