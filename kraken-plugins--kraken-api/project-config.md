# Agent Guide: Kraken API

## Purpose

- **Who this is for**: AI agents and developers working inside this repo.
- **What you get**: The minimum set of facts, files, and commands to navigate, modify, and run Kraken API locally.

### Document metadata

- Last updated: 2026-08-05
- Scope: Kraken API main library (`com.kraken.api`)

### Maintenance (agents and contributors)

- If you change commands, file paths, Gradle tasks, environment variables, generated docs, or workflows in this repo, update this guide in the relevant sections.
- When you add or change generated files, update the `NEVER EDIT DIRECTLY (Generated files)` section with sources and regeneration commands.
- If you change packet mappings, reflection hooks, or client-version-sensitive code, update the packet/reflection maintenance notes and any affected docs under `docs/`.
- If you come across new common errors or fixes, extend `Common error patterns and quick fixes`.
- Always bump the `Last updated` date above when you make substantive changes.

### Code reuse policy (agents and contributors)

- Always reuse existing functions, helpers, and utilities before writing new code. Search the codebase for existing implementations that accomplish the same goal.
- Do not duplicate logic that already exists elsewhere in the repo. If a function, method, or pattern is already implemented, import and call it rather than reimplementing it.
- When adding new functionality, check related packages and modules for shared code that can be leveraged.
- If existing code needs slight modifications to be reusable, prefer refactoring the existing code to be more general over duplicating it with changes.
- Use descriptive variable and method names. Avoid abbreviations or single-letter names unless they are conventional loop variables or math symbols.

### Architectural boundary policy (agents and contributors)

- Keep `Context` lean. It should act as the DI-backed facade for core services, queries, packet initialization, and client-thread helpers, not a dumping ground for feature-specific logic.
- Respect the layer split between `service`, `query`, `input`, `packet`, `simulation`, and `core.script`. Put behavior in the narrowest layer that owns it.
- Keep packet and reflection logic localized. Do not spread obfuscated client lookups, packet method resolution, or runtime hook patching into unrelated services or queries.
- Preserve the service/query distinction. Use `service` for static or global game systems, and `query` for dynamic entities that are filtered and interacted with fluently.
- Keep `Script` orchestration separate from plugin wiring. Put reusable task logic behind `Task`, `AbstractTask`, or service classes instead of embedding everything in plugin event handlers.
- Do not mutate game client details directly from arbitrary layers when a dedicated helper already exists in `core.packet`, `core.interaction`, or `service.util` (e.g. `ReflectionService`).

### Testing policy (agents and contributors)

- Every new non-trivial function, method, or exported API must have accompanying unit tests before merging. Trivial helpers and glue code may be excluded when testing adds no meaningful value.
- All existing tests must pass locally before pushing changes. Run the relevant test suites listed in the [Local testing](#local-testing) and [Quick reference](#quick-reference) sections.
- When modifying existing functions, verify that existing tests still pass and add new test cases if the behavior changes.
- Do not submit changes that break existing tests. If a test failure is pre-existing and unrelated to your changes, note it explicitly in the PR description.

### Commit policy (agents and contributors)

- Always sign off on commits with `git commit -s` (adds a `Signed-off-by:` trailer).
- Never include AI agents as co-authors on commits. The human author is responsible for the work.

## Baseline architecture

- Start with `docs/API.md` for the service/query model, then `docs/INTERACTION.md` for packet-based interactions, and `docs/SCRIPTING.md` for script lifecycle and task orchestration.
- The main entry point for plugin consumers is `com.kraken.api.Context`.
- `Context` wires together:
  - query accessors for players, NPCs, objects, inventory, equipment, widgets, worlds, bank, and deposit box
  - high-level services for bank, dialogue, movement, camera, prayer, magic, UI, grand exchange, map, and utility behavior
  - runtime hooks for packet/mouse behavior
  - client-thread helpers so callers do not need to manage RuneLite thread rules manually
- `Script` is the main long-running automation primitive. It handles lifecycle, game-tick execution, pause/resume, and break management.

## AI integration and plugin authoring

This section is the working guide for AI systems and humans asking AI systems to generate, explain, or modify Kraken API plugin code.

### Source of truth

- For API mechanics and package layout, use this file first, then `docs/API.md`, `docs/INTERACTION.md`, `docs/SCRIPTING.md`, and `docs/TESTS.md`.
- Working examples live under `src/test/java/plugins/api/`.
- `docs/ai-integration.md` is a short redirect to this guide so we do not maintain two different AI-facing docs.
