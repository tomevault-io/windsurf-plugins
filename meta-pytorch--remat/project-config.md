# remat Agent Notes

## Python Test Environment

If the regular local Python or `uv run` path cannot run tests because dependencies such as `pytest`, `expecttest`, or the required PyTorch build are missing, use the llama4x GB unified conda environment from the MSL root:

```bash
source dev/xl_conda.sh activate xlformers_gbunified_conda:conveyor-stable
PYTHONPATH=remat python -m pytest remat/tests/api_test.py -q
```

Run the activation command from `genai/msl/`, or adjust the `dev/xl_conda.sh` path accordingly.
