description: i18n translation keys — full English sentences, keys = values in english.json
---


# i18n rules

* All translation keys must be **full English sentences**.
* In `english.json`, keys and values must be identical.

  Example:

  ```json
  {
    "Select your main language for the app": "Select your main language for the app"
  }
  ```

* This is intentional to make adding new languages easier.
* Locale files are flat JSON (e.g. under `src/i18n/`); periods in keys are fine.
