# Repository Instructions

## GitHub Releases

- When the user asks to publish or prepare a new version, first identify the previous released version and summarize the commits and code changes since that version.
- Create or update the corresponding GitHub Release as a draft and write the resulting changelog into the Release notes.
- Do not publish the release immediately. Keep it in draft state unless the user explicitly gives a separate instruction to publish it now.
- Before any final publication, verify the version, tag, target commit or branch, Release notes, and draft status.
