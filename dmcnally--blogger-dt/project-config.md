# Model Guidelines

## Delegated Type Pattern

Use Rails `delegated_type` for polymorphic relationships where types have different attributes:

- **Delegator table** stores the polymorphic reference and shared attributes
- **Delegate tables** store type-specific data
- Each delegate has `has_one :delegator_name, as: :delegator_type, touch: true`

```ruby
# Delegator
class Entry < ApplicationRecord
  delegated_type :entryable, types: %w[TextContent ImageContent VideoContent]
end

# Delegate
class TextContent < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :entry, as: :entryable, touch: true
end
```

## Recording/Recordable Pattern

This application uses Recording/Recordable as the core delegated type implementation:

- **Recording** is the delegator (polymorphic pointer)
- **Recordables** are immutable delegates (Article, Profile, etc.)
- Recordables must include the `Recordable` concern
- Recordings form trees via `parent_id` for related data

### Immutability Rules

- Recordables are **immutable** - no updates, no deletes
- To "update", create a new recordable row and update the Recording's `recordable_id`
- Multiple recordings can safely share the same recordable

### No Timestamps on Recordables

Recordable tables do NOT need `created_at`/`updated_at` columns:

```ruby
# Migration for a recordable - no timestamps
create_table :articles do |t|
  t.string :title
  t.text :body
  # No t.timestamps - event tracking handles this
end
```

## State Representation

Avoid storing state as fields on recordables. Instead, choose the appropriate pattern based on the type of state.

### Avoid

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  # published_at :datetime     # Don't do this
  # archived_at :datetime      # Don't do this
end
```

### Content State (Recordables)

For content evolution and versioning, use immutable recordables in the tree:

- Article revisions, draft versions
- Content that has intrinsic meaning
- Data that benefits from tree structure

```ruby
# app/models/article/revision.rb
class Article::Revision < ApplicationRecord
  include Recordable
  # Stores a version of article content
end

# Access via children
article_recording.children.where(recordable_type: 'Article::Revision')
```

### Operational Metadata (Join Models)

For visibility and access control, use lightweight join models:

- Publication state (published/unpublished)
- Feature flags, visibility toggles
- Query-optimized boolean states

Example - the `Publication` model:

```ruby
class Publication < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :recording
end

# In Publisher concern - enables efficient scopes
scope :published, -> { joins(:publication) }
scope :unpublished, -> { left_joins(:publication).where.missing(:publication) }
```

This pattern provides:
- Simple, fast, indexable queries
- Easy pagination of published content
- Events track publish/unpublish actions without polluting the recording tree

## Person Model Pattern

Separate identity from authentication:

- **Person** = who someone is (identity, owns records)
- **User** = how someone authenticates (credentials)

### Key Rules

- All ownership references `Person`, not `User` (e.g., `created_by`, `owned_by`)
- Set `Current.person = user.person` on authentication
- Person survives User deletion - data remains intact
- Events track `Current.person` for audit trails

```ruby
# In authentication flow
Current.person = current_user&.person

# In models - reference Person for ownership
belongs_to :creator, class_name: 'Person'
```
