description: enforce core software engineering principles (clean, maintainable, scalable code)
---


Apply senior-level engineering rigor to every change.

Priorities (in order):
- **Abstraction + simplicity**: choose the simplest correct design, avoid cleverness.
- **DRY**: don’t duplicate logic or constants, reuse utilities where it actually reduces complexity.
- **Separation of concerns**: keep UI, domain logic, data access, and side effects cleanly separated.
- **Modularity + composability**: build small pieces that combine cleanly.
- **Encapsulation**: hide internals, expose minimal stable APIs.
- **Single Responsibility**: each module/function does one job and does it well.
- **Dependency injection**: pass dependencies in (don’t hardcode globals), make code swappable and testable.
- **Immutability by default**: avoid mutation unless there’s a clear perf reason.
- **Idempotency**: retries should be safe; repeated calls shouldn’t create weird state.
- **Testability**: write code that’s easy to unit test (pure functions, small surfaces, predictable IO).
- **Readability**: clear naming, straightforward control flow, minimal nesting.
- **Scalability**: consider growth in data, users, and features without premature over-engineering.
- **Performance awareness**: avoid obvious hot-path waste; measure before major optimizations.
- **Error handling**: validate inputs, fail loudly with useful context, don’t swallow errors.

When modifying existing code:
- Preserve behavior unless the change explicitly requires otherwise.
- Keep diffs small and localized.
- Prefer refactors that reduce complexity and improve clarity.
