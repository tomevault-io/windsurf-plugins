# AGENTS.md

Host- and environment-specific operating notes for this repo. The project's own
instructions live in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — read that first; this file carries
only what it leaves out.

## DeepSeek Harness environment

**Scope: DeepSeek Harness (DSH) sessions only.** These constraints come from the
harness, not the repo, so a Claude Code or OpenCode session can ignore this
section.

- **Create worktrees inside the checkout** — `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<name>` — because DSH's file sandbox is rooted at the checkout and a sibling directory (`../enchiridion-455`) is denied. Remove one with `git worktree remove --force`: the untracked `node_modules` it holds makes the plain form refuse.
- **Run `npm ci` in each new worktree** before touching the TypeScript gate. Worktrees share `.git` but get no `node_modules`, and there is no hoisting to fall back on.
- **Read `npm test`'s skip count before its failures.** `cli.run` and `cli.smoke` skip ~28 tests until `npm run build` has produced `dist/cli.cjs`, so the healthy baseline without a bundle is 888 tests / 860 pass / 0 fail / 28 skipped. With one built, the OpenCode `save-session` test fails on this machine — `opencode` is on PATH but cannot write `~/.local/share/opencode/log/`.
- **Falsify a suspicious failure before reporting it**: `git stash`, `npm run build`, rerun, `git stash pop`. `dist/` is gitignored, so a stash leaves the bundle in place and only the rebuild makes the comparison mean anything. That is how the `save-session` failure above was shown to predate its branch.
- **Write long `gh` bodies to a file and pass `--body-file`.** `--body "$(cat <<'EOF' …)"` breaks on backticks, which open a nested command substitution inside `$()`. `gh` also resolves this remote to `dhague/wiki-knowledge` while its URL still reads `dhague/enchiridion`.
- **Point the tool caches inside the workspace.** `gh run view --log` and `gh api …/logs` die on `creating cache entry: open ~/.cache/gh/…: operation not permitted`, and `npm view` dies writing `~/.npm/_logs` — both directories sit outside the sandbox. Prefix `gh` with `XDG_CACHE_HOME="$PWD/temp/<dir>"` and pass `npm` a `--cache temp/<dir>`. `temp/` is gitignored, so both stay out of `git status`; delete them when you're done all the same. The `gh api` variant also needs `--allow-escape-sequences`, as runner logs carry ANSI escapes.

## Comment style: minimum necessary

A comment earns its place only for what the code cannot say. The code already says
*what* happens; a comment carries the *why* an agent cannot recover by reading — an
invariant, a non-obvious constraint, a trap, or a pointer to the authoritative
doc. Delete far more than you write.

- **Module header: one to three lines** naming what the module is and its role.
- **Symbol JSDoc: one line, only where the name and signature don't already say it.** Keep a non-obvious contract — throw behaviour, call order, units, a guarantee a caller relies on. Skip `@param` restatements.
- **Inline `//`: one or two lines, only for the non-obvious.** Delete anything that restates the code.
- **Keep the spec, cut the narrative.** Where a comment is the only definition of a format, schema, or rule the code implements — the `IngestPlan` schema in `ingest.ts` module comment, the commit-message format in `commit.ts` — it stays complete: trim the story around it, not the facts.
- **Point, don't paraphrase.** Cite a decision in a few words (`// ADR-0015: the index is a view of HEAD`) rather than retelling it.
- **No history, no ticket stories.** "used to", "once lived in", what was tried and abandoned, and bare issue numbers all go; a guarded regression gets one line describing the trap.

## Repo gotchas

- **A `src/`-only PR leaves the committed bundle alone.** The bundle freshness job runs only when `wiki-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s version changes; `scripts/release.sh` refreshes `wiki-plugin/scripts/` and each skill's bundled copy at release time. A **second freshness job runs on every PR** and fails when repo-root `skills/` differs from `wiki-plugin/skills/` (ADR-0026) — so touching a skill means regenerating the tree, by `rm -rf skills && cp -R wiki-plugin/skills skills` or by running `scripts/release.sh <new-version>` for a release.
- **Deletions stage through `Manifest.deleted`**, which joins created and updated refs in one `VaultGit.add(paths)` call: a path missing from disk but tracked at HEAD becomes a removal, while one git has never tracked stays a hard error.
- **A new `IngestPlan` feature lands in two places** — `ingest.ts`'s module comment (the schema's only spec) and `wiki-ingest/SKILL.md` step 4 (the agent-facing shape). No JSON schema file exists. The accepted `action` set is declared once as `PlanActions` and fenced to the agent-facing shape by `skills.test.ts`.
- **Extending the property tests in `wikipage.test.ts`**: `genVaultArb` guarantees its first page sits in a kind-folder and is never the one moved, so the YAML oracle always has a page to read. A generator that drops that guarantee makes the `oracleReadAFold` assertion vacuous and the second oracle silently stops guarding (#489).
