# Agent working notes — kicad-mcp

Conventions for any AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) working in this repo.
General contributor guidance — bug reports, PR style, threshold-test coverage —
is in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. This file holds the few rules that are easy to violate
while *generating* code and expensive to retrofit.

## Boundary ops: extract decision logic before welding it to `pcbnew`

When you add or edit a tool that runs a `pcbnew` or `kicad-cli` script — anything
that builds a script string for `run_pcbnew_script` — do **not** put decision
logic (geometry, thresholds, classification) inside that string. Across the
process boundary it becomes unreachable to any in-process test, and the only test
left is a tautological boundary-mock that asserts its own configured return and
cannot fail.

Instead:

1. Put the pure logic in a `*_HELPER` string in `utils/` (exemplar:
   `utils/geometry.py` → `GEOMETRY_HELPER`).
2. Keep the embedded script a **thin shell**: load the board, marshal `pcbnew`
   objects into plain dicts, splice the helper in by concatenation
   (`""" + _MY_HELPER + """`), and **call the helper for every decision**.
3. Add a no-KiCad test that `exec`s the helper and asserts at the boundaries
   (value / just-below / just-above).

Full pattern and a copyable skeleton: **`docs/BOUNDARY_OPS.md`**. Straight-line
marshalling (load → mutate → save, no branching) needs no helper — don't invent
one.

Before finishing such work, run the report-only ratchet:

```bash
python scripts/audit_testability.py        # report-only; --check fails on NEW violations
```

It flags new helperless boundary logic and new tautological boundary tests.
Pre-existing violations are grandfathered in `scripts/testability_baseline.json`;
extracting one ratchets the count down. Refresh after an intentional change with
`--update-baseline`.

## Report which guarantee you hold — don't let "verified E2E" stand in for "tested"

When you report a change as done, name *which* guarantee you actually have. They
are different, and a green golden-harness run is only the first:

- **"works on this input"** — an end-to-end / integration run passed on a
  specific board or fixture (e.g. "`build_pcb_from_schematic` routes
  0-unconnected on the speed-cal config"). This proves the pipeline works *today,
  on that input*. It does **not** prove the logic is pinned against regression.
- **"logic pinned against regression"** — the decision logic has an in-process
  unit test that fails if the logic changes (a `*_HELPER` exec-tested at its
  boundaries — see `docs/BOUNDARY_OPS.md`). This is what catches a dropped field
  or a `<` → `<=` flip that *still routes*.

Say the one you have. If you only ran E2E, write "works on input X", not
"tested" / "verified" unqualified.

This is checkable, not just etiquette: if `scripts/audit_testability.py` reports
the logic as helperless boundary logic, or its test as a tautological boundary
mock, you cannot honestly claim "pinned against regression" for it — there is no
in-process test that reaches it.

## Note: portfolio-wide tautology sweep vs. this repo's own baseline (2026-07-19)

`~/.claude/scripts/tautology_sweep.py` is a generalized port of this repo's own
`find_tautological_tests` (in `scripts/audit_testability.py`), built to run
across other repos in the same portfolio. Run for the first time against five
sibling repos (mneme, heimdall, writer, freecad-mcp, mr-esp32) on 2026-07-19,
all five came back genuinely clean — 0 violations, verified both at current
state and against each repo's pre-review historical commit, not a scan
artifact.

Run the same day against kicad-mcp directly (`--root .`, no `--test-dir`
override needed), it found **55** violations vs. this repo's own
`scripts/testability_baseline.json`, which grandfathers **51** under
`tautological_tests`. The two counts aren't a subset of each other: diffing
the actual test names, 8 are flagged only by the portfolio sweep and 4 only
by the native detector (net +4, but 12 tests actually disagree). This is a
real detection-logic difference, not baseline drift — confirmed by reading
two examples:

- `tests/test_new_tools.py::test_clean_board_skips_fix` (sweep flags it,
  native doesn't) — one assertion (`result["status"] == "ok"`) echoes a
  mocked field, but the same test also asserts `mock_fix.assert_not_called()`
  and `"preflight" not in result`, both genuine behavioral checks. The
  portfolio sweep flagging the whole test looks like a **false positive**.
- `tests/test_pcb_keepout.py::test_placement_in_keepout` (native flags it,
  sweep doesn't) — all four assertions echo the mocked `run_pcbnew_script`
  return value (`valid`, `len(violations)`, `violations[0]["type"]`,
  `violations[0]["keepout_ref"]`), no independent behavioral check anywhere.
  This one reads as more tautological than the sweep-only example above, yet
  the portfolio sweep missed it — plausibly because its AST matcher doesn't
  follow chained/indexed dict access (`violations[0]["keepout_ref"]`) the
  same way it follows a flat `result["status"]`. Looks like a **false
  negative** in the portfolio tool.

Only these 2 of the 12 disagreements were read — not exhaustive. Worth a
