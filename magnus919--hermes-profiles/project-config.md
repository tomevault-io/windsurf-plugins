## How Profiles Work

Each profile is a directory containing:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SOUL.md` | Identity document — first principles, methodology, output contract |
| `profile.yaml` | Metadata — description, required/recommended skills |
| `README.md` | Human-facing usage guide |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent-facing trigger patterns and handoff protocol |

Profiles do NOT contain skill files directly. Each profile's `skills/`
directory contains **relative symlinks** back to the shared `skills/`
pool at the repo root. This means one copy of each skill serves every
profile.

## Skill Conventions

Skills in the shared pool follow progressive disclosure:
- `SKILL.md` is a thin index with trigger conditions and loading instructions
- Methodology detail lives in `references/` loaded on demand via `skill_view(name, file_path=path)`
- Skills should work on a vanilla Hermes install — no dependencies on council, cashew, or agent-specific infrastructure

## Symlink Rules

- All symlinks must be **relative**, not absolute
- From `profiles/<name>/skills/`, target is `../../../skills/<skill-name>`
- From `profiles/<name>/skills/<category>/`, target is `../../../../skills/<category>/<skill-name>` (or make the category itself a symlink)
- Symlinks are tracked by git (mode 120000). They recreate correctly on `git clone` (macOS/Linux).

## Contribution Workflow

1. Branch from `main`
2. Add or modify profile files
3. If adding a new skill, place the skill directory in `skills/` first, then symlink from the profile
4. Ensure all symlinks resolve — check with `test -e`
5. Open a PR with a clear description of what the profile does and what skills it needs

## Verifying a Profile

Before submitting a PR, check:

- [ ] `SOUL.md` exists — first principles, output contract
- [ ] `profile.yaml` exists — valid YAML, required skills listed
- [ ] `README.md` exists — installation, quick start, skill reference
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` exists — trigger patterns, loading order, handoff
- [ ] All symlinks in `skills/` resolve to real files in the shared pool
- [ ] No absolute paths in symlinks
- [ ] No duplicate skill files — use symlinks to the shared pool
