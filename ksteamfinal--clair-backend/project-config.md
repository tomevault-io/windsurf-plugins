# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CLAIR Backend is a FastAPI-based AI contract analysis system (Korean-language app). It handles contract document upload, AI-powered analysis (Gemini), and chat-based Q&A (LangChain RAG). The backend uses MySQL with SQLAlchemy ORM and JWT-based authentication with social login support (Google, Naver, Kakao).

## Commands

```bash
# Setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Database (MySQL required)
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS clair_db DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;"

# Run dev server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# API docs
# Swagger: http://localhost:8000/docs
# ReDoc:   http://localhost:8000/redoc
# Health:  http://localhost:8000/health
```

There is currently no test runner configured. The `tests/` directory exists but is empty.

## Architecture

The app follows a layered architecture: **API → Services → Models/DB**.

- **[app/api/v1/](app/api/v1/)** — Route handlers only; no business logic. Three routers: `auth`, `contracts`, `chat`.
- **[app/services/](app/services/)** — All business logic lives here. Services receive a SQLAlchemy `db` session and current user as arguments.
- **[app/models/](app/models/)** — SQLAlchemy ORM models (`User`, `SocialAccount`, `Contract`, `AnalysisResult`, `RiskClause`, `ChatSession`, `ChatMessage`).
- **[app/schemas/](app/schemas/)** — Pydantic v2 request/response DTOs. Separate from models.
- **[app/core/config.py](app/core/config.py)** — Pydantic Settings loaded from `.env`. Single `settings` singleton used throughout.
- **[app/core/security.py](app/core/security.py)** — JWT creation/decoding, password hashing, and `get_current_user` FastAPI dependency.
- **[app/db/session.py](app/db/session.py)** — SQLAlchemy engine and `get_db()` dependency. `get_db()` is injected into every route that touches the DB.
- **[app/db/init_db.py](app/db/init_db.py)** — `init_db()` called on startup (via lifespan in `main.py`) to create all tables via `Base.metadata.create_all()`.
- **[app/integrations/](app/integrations/)** — Currently empty; reserved for Gemini API and LangChain RAG integrations.

## Key Design Patterns

**Authentication flow**: `OAuth2PasswordBearer` → `get_current_user` dependency extracts user from JWT Bearer token. Access tokens expire in 60 min, refresh tokens in 7 days. Social login (Google/Naver/Kakao) uses OAuth2 authorization code flow — the callback endpoints exchange the code for tokens via `httpx`, then call `_social_login()` in [app/services/auth_service.py](app/services/auth_service.py) which upserts `SocialAccount` + `User` records and issues app JWTs. Social users have `password_hash=None`.

**Contract file storage**: Uploaded files are stored under `UPLOAD_DIR` organized by date (`YYYY/MM/DD/`). The `stored_filename` in the DB is a UUID-based name; `original_filename` preserves the user-facing name. Allowed formats: `.pdf,.png,.jpg,.jpeg,.txt,.docx`; max size defaults to 20 MB (configurable via `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`).

**AI integration stubs**: `POST /api/v1/contracts/{id}/analyze` and `chat_service.send_message()` have `# TODO` placeholders where Gemini/LangChain calls will go. These are in [app/api/v1/contracts.py](app/api/v1/contracts.py) and [app/services/chat_service.py](app/services/chat_service.py).

**Alembic** is installed but not yet configured — database schema is managed via `init_db()` (no migration history).

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
```
DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME
UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=20
SECRET_KEY
GEMINI_API_KEY         # empty until AI integration is implemented
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173

# Social login (optional — leave empty to disable)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI
NAVER_CLIENT_ID, NAVER_CLIENT_SECRET, NAVER_REDIRECT_URI
KAKAO_CLIENT_ID, KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET, KAKAO_REDIRECT_URI
```

Default redirect URIs point to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/{provider}/callback`.
