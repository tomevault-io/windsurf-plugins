# Testing Guidelines for BongoCat

## Test Structure
Tests are located in [Tests/BongoCatTests/](mdc:Tests/BongoCatTests/) with these key files:
- [BongoCatTests.swift](mdc:Tests/BongoCatTests/BongoCatTests.swift) - Main app tests
- [CatAnimationControllerTests.swift](mdc:Tests/BongoCatTests/CatAnimationControllerTests.swift) - Animation logic tests
- [StrokeCounterTests.swift](mdc:Tests/BongoCatTests/StrokeCounterTests.swift) - Input tracking tests

## Testing Principles
- **Unit tests** for business logic and data processing
- **Mock system dependencies** (input monitoring, window management)
- **Test state transitions** and edge cases
- **Verify settings persistence** and restoration
- **Test error conditions** and recovery

## Test Categories

### Core Functionality Tests
- Input detection and paw mapping
- Animation state transitions
- Position saving and loading
- Settings persistence
- Stroke counting accuracy

### UI Component Tests
- View state management
- Menu interactions
- Window positioning
- Scale and rotation calculations

### Integration Tests
- App lifecycle management
- Multi-monitor support
- Accessibility permissions
- System preference changes

## Mock Guidelines
- Mock **CGEvent** and input monitoring for deterministic tests
- Mock **UserDefaults** for settings tests
- Mock **NSWindow** and **NSScreen** for positioning tests
- Use **dependency injection** to make components testable

## Test Naming Convention
```swift
func test_featureName_whenCondition_shouldExpectedResult() {
    // Test implementation
}
```

## Running Tests
- Use the test script: `./Scripts/test.sh`
- Run individual test files in Xcode
- Ensure tests pass before committing changes
- Add tests for new features and bug fixes

## Performance Testing
- Test animation performance with high input rates
- Verify memory usage doesn't grow over time
- Test startup and shutdown performance
- Monitor CPU usage during intensive operations

## Testing Best Practices
- Keep tests **fast and isolated**
- Use **descriptive test names** that explain the scenario
- **Arrange, Act, Assert** pattern for test structure
- Clean up test state between tests
- Test both **happy path** and **error scenarios**
