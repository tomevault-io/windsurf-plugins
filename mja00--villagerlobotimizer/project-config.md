description: Gradle build, run, and publish guidance for the Paper plugin
---

## Build and run

- Use the Gradle wrapper.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

- Start a dev server with the plugin installed:

```bash
./gradlew runServer
```

- The run task uses Paper `1.21.8` and depends on the shaded jar. Artifacts are reobfuscated for production during `build`.

### Dependencies and shading

- Dependencies are declared in [build.gradle.kts](mdc:build.gradle.kts). Shadow is configured to:
  - minimize the jar
  - relocate `org.bstats` to `dev.mja00.villagerLobotomizer.bstats`
- If adding libraries that must ship in the jar, include them under `shadowJar { dependencies { include(...) } }` and relocate as needed.

### Java toolchain

- Target Java 21; toolchain is auto-configured. Avoid APIs above 21.

### Publishing (Hangar)

- Publish with:

```bash
./gradlew publishPluginPublicationToHangar
```

- Requires `HANGAR_API_KEY` env var. Tagged commits matching `version` publish as Release; otherwise Snapshot with short commit hash.

### Version coordination

- Keep [src/main/resources/plugin.yml](mdc:src/main/resources/plugin.yml) `version` aligned with Gradle `version`. Resource filtering is configured; prefer replacing hardcoded versions with `${version}`.
