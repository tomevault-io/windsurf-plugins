# AGENTS.md — Astro Modular (Astro + Obsidian blog theme)

Source of truth for AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) working in this repo.
**Read this entire file before making changes.** It captures the things that are
non-obvious about how Astro Modular is structured.

If the answer to "how does X work?" isn't here and it took you more than one round of
investigation, **add it here** when you figure it out.

## What Astro Modular is

Astro Modular is an Astro blog theme designed for Obsidian users, by
[David V. Kimball](https://davidvkimball.com). The `src/content/` folder is a real
Obsidian vault — users write in Obsidian, commit, and publish.

**Stack:**
- Astro 5.x (fully prepared for v6). Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages / Cloudflare Workers friendly.
- **Obsidian vault as CMS.** `src/content/.obsidian/` is committed, with a curated plugin set.
- **Swup** for client-side page transitions (NOT Astro's ClientRouter).
- Tailwind + custom theme variables (17+ built-in color themes, switchable at runtime).
- Vanilla JS only — no React, no jQuery.
- Modular by design — almost every feature toggles via `siteConfig` in `src/config.ts`.

**Core philosophy:** Content lives in Obsidian. Standard markdown links, wikilinks,
Obsidian embeds, callouts, and tags should work *identically* in Obsidian and on the
live site. Don't take shortcuts that break Obsidian-native behavior.

## Cardinal rules

1. **NEVER edit files in `src/content/`** without explicit user permission. Posts,
   pages, projects, docs, frontmatter — all belong to the user. Only edit config,
   components, layouts, utilities, scripts, and plugins.
2. **Use `pnpm`, not `npm`.** Scripts: `pnpm run <script>`.
3. **Use `entry.id`, NEVER `entry.slug`.** `slug` is removed in Astro v6 and returns
   `undefined`. Folder-based entries have IDs like `'folder-name'`, NOT `'folder-name/index'`.
4. **Never disable the Astro dev toolbar** (`devToolbar.enabled: true` in
   `astro.config.mjs`). The pnpm module-loading errors in the console are cosmetic.
5. **Never disable `vite.server.fs.strict`.** Security boundary.
6. **Never use `console.log()` in production code.** Use `src/utils/logger.ts`.
7. **Never hardcode colors.** Use Tailwind classes that reference theme variables
   (`primary-*`, `highlight-*`) with `dark:` variants. The theme system has 17+ color
   themes — hardcoded colors break all of them.
8. **Never remove or rename `// [CONFIG:KEY]` comment markers** in `src/config.ts`.
   The Astro Modular Settings Obsidian plugin uses them to edit config from inside
   the vault.
9. **Never use destructive commands** (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, force push)
   without explicit approval. Investigate root causes.
10. **Match existing patterns.** This codebase already solves most problems consistently.
    Search before inventing.
