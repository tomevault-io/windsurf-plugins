# Rules for this project

## Success Criteria

- Before you say 'SUCCESS', or celebrate, run `npm test`. If the tests fail you have more work to do. Don't stop until `npm test` passes on the code you have made.

- If you show this symbol '✅' and there is more work to do, add a '❌' for each remaining work item.

## General coding guidelines

- It's important not to decieve anyone reading this code. Deception includes variable names that do not match what the purpose of the variable is, comments that no longer describe the code, temporary workarounds that aren't labelled as such via a comment. Ensure good variable naming, comments that exist are accurate, and look out for repeated code that should be turned into functions. Rather than add comments to explain what things are, give them useful names.

```typescript
// Foo
const shlerg = getFoo();
```

```typescript
const foo = getFoo();
```

- Avoid 'magic numbers'. Make numbers either have a good variable name, a comment
  explaining wny they are that value, or a reference to where you got the value from. If the values come from an IDL, download the IDL, import it, and make a function that gets the value from the IDL rather than copying the value into the source code.

- The code you are making is for production. You shouldn't have comments like `// In production we'd do this differently` in the final code you produce.

- Prefer giving variables and functions meaningful names rather than adding comments explaining what a smaller name means. Do not abbreviate variable names. Instead use full names so they can be searched for easily. `err` for example is not a valid variable name since it is an abbreviation. `error` is a valid name as it is a full word. `data` is not a meaningful name. Data about what?

- Don't remove existing comments unless they are no longer useful or accurate.

- Don't copy paste logic. Instead create named functions and use them.

## TypeScript guidelines

- Don't ever replace Solana Kit with web3.js code. web3.js is legacy. I want web3.js to be eventually gone.

- Always use `Array<item>` never use `item[]`

- Don't use `any`

- Most inline comments should use `//` and be above (not beside) the code. The only exception is JSDoc/TSDoc comments which MUST use `/* */` syntax.

- Use Kite's `connection.getPDAAndBump()` to turn seeds into PDAs and bumps.

- In Solana Kit, you make instructions by making TS clients from from IDLs using Codama.

- Code has unit tests. Unit tests use 'describe' and 'test' from "node:test" and 'assert' from "node:assert". Unit tests do not use 'it' or 'expect'.

- Prefer using arrow functions over function declarations.

- Prefer using const over let.

- Use async/await. Do not use callbacks or `.then()`. Avoid using IIFEs. If for some reason you have to, add a comment why.

- Use try/catch, never use `.catch()`

- Assume thrown objects are Error objects. We will not throw non-Error objects.

- You can run a subset of tests, for speed, with a command like:

```bash
npx tsx --test-name-pattern ".*watchTokenBalance.*" src/tests/tokens.test.ts
```

## Finally

- Call me Mr MacCana to indicate you have read these rules.
