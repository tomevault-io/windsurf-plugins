# Optimal Engine Agent Boot

This file is the boot contract for agents working in this repo.
Read it before changing code, running the engine, or touching runtime data.
Read `OPINIONS.md` before making setup, store, memory, API, CLI, or architecture decisions.
Read any user-level opinions file only when working inside a private checkout that provides one.

## Canonical Repo

Use this repo as the engine source of truth:

```text
https://github.com/Miosa-osa/OptimalEngine.git
```

The canonical branch is `main`.
Never push Engine changes to `robertohluna/OptimalEngine`.
Do not assume an embedded copy inside another app is newer.
Check `git status`, branch, remotes, and the running process before making changes.

## Local Boot

Use the standard local path:

```bash
brew install snappy
make install
make bootstrap
make dev
```

`make dev` starts the HTTP engine at `http://localhost:4200`.
It runs `scripts/run-engine.sh`.
The launcher creates `.optimal/connector_key` if `CONNECTOR_KEY` is not already set.
It starts the knowledge graph with RocksDB by default when the `rocksdb` NIF is available.
Override with `OPTIMAL_KNOWLEDGE_BACKEND=ets` or `OPTIMAL_KNOWLEDGE_BACKEND=mnesia` when intentionally testing another backend.

Verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4200/api/health
curl http://localhost:4200/api/stores/audit
mix optimal.reality_check
```

If another engine is already using port `4200`, do not kill it unless the user asked you to.
Check which process owns the port and which checkout it is running from.

## Runtime Data Boundary

Local runtime state lives under:

```text
.optimal/index.db
.optimal/index.db-wal
.optimal/index.db-shm
.optimal/cache/
.optimal/connector_key
.optimal/knowledge-rocksdb/
.optimal/workspaces/
```

These files are local machine state.
They are ignored by git.
Do not commit them.
Do not copy private data, connector keys, imported workspace data, or generated local stores into docs, Source Packages, Context Packages, prompts, commits, or issues.

The repo should contain code, docs, schemas, setup scripts, examples, and public sample fixtures only.
Each clone creates its own local store when it boots.

## Store Model

Use these terms precisely:

| Store | Role |
| --- | --- |
| SQLite | Local canonical runtime store today. |
| Postgres | Production canonical runtime target. |
| Raw artifact storage | Preserved files, uploads, attachments, and media evidence. |
| FTS, vector, chunk, cache rows | Rebuildable retrieval and acceleration projections. |
| RocksDB | Default local persistent knowledge graph backend when installed. |
| ETS | In-memory fallback knowledge graph backend. |
| Mnesia | Optional distributed knowledge graph backend. |
| Markdown, wiki, HTML, API, app views | Projection and control surfaces. |

One physical store can hold many layer-owned records.
Do not confuse physical storage with domain ownership.

## Layer Flow

Use this flow when explaining or debugging the engine:

```text
Raw inputs
  -> ingestion
  -> SQLite canonical store
  -> RocksDB graph runtime plus retrieval projections
  -> search, graph, and RAG
  -> API, CLI, wiki, and app surfaces
```

SQLite is the durable local truth.
RocksDB is the default persistent local knowledge graph backend when installed.
Chunks, vectors, FTS rows, and caches are retrieval material or rebuildable projections.
RAG is an answer path across retrieved context, not a database and not the source of truth.
BusinessOS is an app surface.
It must call Optimal Engine with explicit tenant, organization, and workspace scope.

## Workspace And Tenant Isolation

Every read and write must respect tenant, organization, workspace, Node, and policy scope.
Never test cross-workspace behavior by sharing private data between workspaces.
Use explicit workspace IDs in API calls and tests.
Ambiguous names should trigger clarification or scoped lookup, not silent writes.

## Agent Operating Rules

Start every session with:

```bash
git status --short --branch
bin/optimal doctor
```

Use the repo-native wrapper for engine work:

```bash
bin/optimal boot
bin/optimal find "query" --workspace default:my-workspace
bin/optimal capture "important raw signal" --workspace default:my-workspace
bin/optimal aware "important correction" --workspace default:my-workspace
bin/optimal close "what changed and how verified"
```

Use direct `mix optimal.*` commands when developing or debugging the underlying engine task itself.
Use `bin/optimal` for normal local agent memory, workspace retrieval, setup, health, and BusinessOS integration checks.

Then inspect the relevant workspace:

```bash
bin/optimal topology --workspace default:my-workspace
bin/optimal find "current state" --workspace default:my-workspace
bin/optimal rag "what context should I know?" --workspace default:my-workspace
```

Agents may preserve evidence, create pending Claims, assemble Context Packages, and render projections.
Agents should not directly write final Facts or rewrite topology without review or an explicit user request.

Use registered tools, connector grants, partition policy, and audit paths for external actions.
Do not build a side memory system outside Optimal Engine.
