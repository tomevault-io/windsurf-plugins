# Calendar years as strings (project-wide)

- In **JSON** (scraped meetings `_manifest.json` `pdfs[].year`, API bodies, seed JSON), use a **four-digit string** (`"2026"`), not a JSON number (`2026`).
- **Python**: `json.dumps` will still emit strings if you build dicts with `str(year)` at the boundary. Folder paths may use `Path(..., str(y))` with `y` as `int` internally.
- **TypeScript**: Treat imported JSON years as `string` so literals are not widened to `number`.
- **Postgres / Neon**: use `VARCHAR(4)` (or `TEXT`) for calendar, tax, filing, and shapefile `vintage_year` labels in bronze and public search tables; keep true counts (`org_year_count`, headcounts) as `INTEGER`.
- **Do not** store bare calendar years as `INTEGER` in new warehouse columns unless the column is part of a date type or analytics that truly needs arithmetic; prefer `TEXT` / `VARCHAR(4)` for `calendar_year` labels.
