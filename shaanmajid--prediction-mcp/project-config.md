# Prediction Markets MCP Server

> **For users:** Install via npm with `npx prediction-mcp`. See [README.md](README.md) for setup instructions.
>
> **This file is for contributors** developing the server itself.

## API Reference

Always consult these docs when working with platform APIs:

| Platform         | Documentation                                                     |

| Polymarket Gamma | https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/gamma-markets-api/overview |
| Polymarket CLOB  | https://docs.polymarket.com/#clob-api                             |

## Development Workflow

### Testing Changes

**All functional changes must be tested by invoking the MCP tools directly.**

1. Run `bun run scripts/bootstrap.ts` to register your worktree's server in `.mcp.json`
2. **Exit and resume your Claude Code session** — the server won't reload until restart
3. Invoke the tools you modified to verify they work correctly
4. Run `bun test` to ensure all tests pass

### Critical: Session Restart Required

MCP servers are loaded when the Claude Code session starts. If you:

- Add MCP config for the first time
- Update server code and need to test changes
- Modify tool definitions or handlers

**You must exit and resume the session to load the updated server.**

The bootstrap script reminds you of this, but it's easy to forget when iterating on code changes.

### Worktree Setup

Each git worktree needs its own `.mcp.json` pointing to its `index.ts`:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-worktree
bun install
bun run scripts/bootstrap.ts
# Exit and resume Claude Code session
```

## Platforms

### Kalshi

- SDK: `kalshi-typescript` v3.0.0
- Auth: API key + RSA private key
- Orderbook returns bids only (binary market reciprocity)
- SDK 3.0 uses `MarketApi` (singular)
- Production URL: `https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2`
- Demo URL: `https://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2`

Set `KALSHI_USE_DEMO=true` to use the demo environment. Demo credentials are separate from production.

### Polymarket

- Gamma API: market discovery, events, tags (public, no auth)
- CLOB API: orderbooks, prices, trades
- SDK: `@polymarket/clob-client` for CLOB operations
- Markets identified by `slug`; CLOB uses `token_id` from `clobTokenIds`
- Orderbook returns both bids and asks
- No demo environment available (all operations are read-only)

## Known Issues

### Kalshi SDK Global State

**⚠️ The `kalshi-typescript` SDK modifies the global axios instance.**

When you instantiate `KalshiClient` (which uses the SDK internally), it adds request interceptors to the **global** axios instance for authentication. This means:

1. **Never create test clients with fake credentials** — the interceptors will break all subsequent API calls in the same process, including integration tests
2. **One client per process** — multiple clients with different credentials will conflict
3. **Credential changes require process restart** — interceptors persist for the process lifetime

See `src/clients/kalshi.test.ts` for the workaround pattern used in tests.

## Search

Both platforms use in-memory caches for fast tokenized search:

### Kalshi
- Populates on first search (~7 seconds, ~18 API calls)
- Queries return in <1ms
- Refresh via `kalshi_cache_stats` with `refresh: true`
- Scores by field weight: titles (1.0), subtitles (0.8), tickers (0.5)

### Polymarket
- Populates on first search
- Refresh via `polymarket_cache_stats` with `refresh: true`
- Uses same scoring algorithm as Kalshi

## Scripts

### bootstrap.ts

Registers the MCP server with Claude Code or other MCP clients:

```bash
bun run scripts/bootstrap.ts              # Project config (.mcp.json)
bun run scripts/bootstrap.ts --global     # User config (~/.claude.json)
bun run scripts/bootstrap.ts --interactive # Prompt for credentials
bun run scripts/bootstrap.ts --demo       # Use Kalshi demo environment
```

### docs.ts

Unified documentation CLI with subcommands:

```bash
bun run docs:generate    # Generate docs from source
