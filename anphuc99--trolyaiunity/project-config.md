# Copilot / AI Coding Instructions

## 🔴 Mandatory Context Reading

**Before writing, modifying, or suggesting any code:**

1. **MUST read `README.md` first**
   - Project purpose
   - Folder structure
   - Architecture & design decisions
   - Coding conventions

2. If a request involves a specific file:
   - **MUST read the latest version of that file before editing**
   - Cached or outdated context is forbidden

3. **DO NOT assume anything**
   - If context is missing, request the file
   - Guessing behavior or structure is prohibited

---

## 🧠 Code Change Rules

Whenever you write or modify code:

1. **Always work on the latest content**
   - Re-read files before applying changes

2. **Preserve existing architecture**
   - Follow current patterns and conventions
   - No new paradigms unless explicitly requested

3. **Minimal & focused changes**
   - Change only what is required
   - Do not refactor unrelated code

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Rules (MVC + Requests/Events)

This project uses an MVC-inspired, event-driven architecture.

### Definitions

- **Model**
   - Plain C# classes (no Unity dependencies)
   - Stores data/state only
   - **No business logic**
   - All caching/state must live here (not in Controllers)

- **Controller**
   - `static` C# classes
   - Implements feature logic and orchestration
   - **Must be stateless** (no cached fields, no static mutable state)
   - Communicates down to Views only via `EventBus.Publish(...)`
   - Receives input only via `RequestController` endpoints using `[Request("key")]`

- **View**
   - Unity `MonoBehaviour` (scene/prefab GameObjects)
   - Displays data, handles Unity interaction, and forwards intent
   - **No logic/processing** beyond view concerns
   - **Must NOT update Models directly**
   - **Must NOT call Controllers directly**
   - Can only interact with Controllers via `SendRequest(...)` from `BaseView`
   - Receives data from Controllers by subscribing to events (attribute binding via `[OnEvent("key")]`)

- **Tests**
   - Unit tests must focus on Controller logic
   - Every Controller **must have** unit tests, and tests should be thorough

### Hard Rules (Non-negotiable)

1. Controllers MUST NOT reference or call Views
    - Only publish events (`EventBus.Publish`) for Views to react
2. Models MUST NOT contain logic
    - Data only
3. Views MUST NOT:
    - Call Controllers directly
    - Update Models directly
    - Do gameplay/business calculations
4. Views MUST request via `BaseView.SendRequest(...)` (or `SendRequest<T>(...)` when expecting a return value)
5. Controllers MUST be static and stateless
    - If you need cache/state, introduce or extend a Model

## 📁 Feature Folder Structure (Required)

Features live under:

- `Assets/Features/<FeatureName>/`

Expected structure (minimum):

- `Scenes/` (scene name should match a `ControllerScopeKey` value, e.g. `<FeatureName>Gameplay`)
- `Scripts/`
   - `Model/` (data-only classes)
   - `Controller/` (static controllers)
   - `View/` (Unity view scripts)
   - `Requests/` (string keys for requests)
   - `Events/` (string keys for events)
   - `Infrastructure/` (feature-level wrappers forwarding to Core infrastructure)
- `Tests/` (unit tests for Controllers)

---

## 🪟 View Structure Rule (One BaseView per Controller)

- Views of the same functionality should be grouped into a subfolder under `View/`.
- Each feature should have:
   - Exactly one **BaseView-derived** class that interacts with Controllers via requests/events.
   - Other view components should inherit `MonoBehaviour` and communicate with the BaseView via DI / references.
- **Each Controller interacts with exactly one BaseView**.

---

## 🔁 Runtime Scope Rule

- Scene names should match `ControllerScopeKey` enum values.
- Scoped controllers are activated by scene scope; Views should run controller-dependent logic in `BaseView.OnEnabled()` (not in `Start`) to ensure scope is active.

---

## 📘 Documentation Requirements

All code changes MUST include documentation:

### Inline Comments
- Explain complex logic
- Clarify non-obvious decisions

### Function / Class Documentation
- Use **JSDoc / TSDoc** or language-equivalent
- Must describe:
  - Purpose
  - Parameters
  - Return values
  - Side effects (if any)

### README.md Updates
Required for **major changes**, including:
- New features
- New scripts or commands
- New configuration or setup steps
- Architecture or workflow changes

---

## 🧪 Syntax & Build Validation (MANDATORY)

**Code generation MUST NOT finish unless syntax is valid.**

Before ending any response that includes code, the AI MUST:

1. **Ensure zero syntax errors**
   - No missing brackets, parentheses, or semicolons
   - No invalid keywords or malformed declarations

2. **Mentally validate compilation / parsing**
   - Code must be parsable by the target language compiler/interpreter
   - Type annotations and generics must be valid

3. **Fix syntax errors immediately**
   - If an error is detected, it MUST be corrected before continuing
   - The AI is forbidden from leaving known syntax errors unresolved

4. **If syntax cannot be guaranteed**
   - The AI MUST explicitly state the risk
   - AND ask for clarification instead of guessing

❌ **Never output code with known syntax errors**
