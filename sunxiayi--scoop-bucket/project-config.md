# Repository guidance

This repository contains Scoop manifests for Repo Agent Kit command-line tools.

- Use immutable release URLs and verified SHA-256 hashes.
- Keep manifests valid against Scoop's current schema and preserve autoupdate
  metadata.
- Run the bucket tests and the Windows install workflow for every manifest
  change.
- Do not add telemetry, credentials, mutable downloads, or post-install network
  calls.
- Keep README installation commands synchronized with the manifest name.
