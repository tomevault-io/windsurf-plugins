# AI Agent Context

This file provides guidance to all AI code assistants when working with code in this repository.

# opensec
A code review tool based on the PI harness that makes bug identification and management easy for any team and any software

## Important notes
- Keep instructions for agents lean. Less is more and it should be usable across all agents and models
- Make tools intuitive and easy to use. Don't manipulate agent context in unclear ways
- Less restrictions is usually better for agents
- We build general capable agents and give them the tools to solve their own problems instead of hardcoding solutions around small issues
- DRY: Do not repeat code
- Cleanup: remove old and unused code
- YAGNI: Don't over engineer

## Communication
In general keep it clear concise and to the point. MECE
1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
