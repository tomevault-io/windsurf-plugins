# Moonglow Toolset

A from-scratch, cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) reimplementation of the
Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition Aurora Toolset in Rust (egui UI, wgpu
renderer), licensed GPL-3.0. The plan, architecture and phase list are in
`docs/PLAN.md`; the Aurora parity checklist is
`docs/parity/aurora-ui-inventory.md`.

## Commands

```sh
cargo test --workspace                          # unit tests (corpus tests skip without a game install)
cargo test -p mg-corpus-tests --release         # corpus, differential and engine tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets          # must be warning-free
cargo fmt                                       # rustfmt.toml: width 100, "Max" heuristics
```

Corpus tests read the installed game: `NWN_ROOT` (or the Steam default path)
and neverwinter.nim's tools and nasher as oracles (`NWN_TOOLS_BIN`, default
`~/.local/opt/neverwinter/bin`), plus nwnmdlcomp for models (also found in
`~/Projects/neverblender/tools/bin`) and Pillow (`python3`) for textures.
`MOONGLOW_REQUIRE_CORPUS=1` turns skips into failures.

## Layout

Cargo workspace, layered bottom-up (a crate depends only on crates listed
before it in `docs/PLAN.md` §4): `crates/mg-core` (ResRef, ResType, languages,
LocString, binary helpers), `mg-gff`, `mg-erf`, `mg-key`, `mg-2da`, `mg-tlk`,
... `mg-edit` (undoable workspace), `mg-plugin` (the plugin host: manifests
and the sandboxed Luau runtime; the API is documented in
`docs/manual/16-writing-plugins.md` and `17-plugin-api.md`, and
`crates/mg-plugin/tests/examples.rs` holds those and the examples in
`docs/plugins/` to the code), `mg-render` (wgpu renderer), `mg-preview`
(blueprint previews: what a creature, item, placeable or door looks like),
`mg-ui` (egui app; UI tests with
`egui_kittest` in `crates/mg-ui/tests`; to look at a window's layout,
render it with `tests/screens.rs`: `cargo test -p mg-ui --test screens --
--ignored` writes PNGs to `target/test-output/screens/`), `mg-testkit` (corpus locator, oracle
tools, engine runner) and `mg-corpus-tests` (tests only). Binaries:
`apps/mg` (CLI) and `apps/moonglow` (the GUI). `packaging/` builds the release packages
(AppImage, Flatpak, Windows installer, macOS app; `packaging/README.md`) and
`docs/manual/` is the user manual, also built into the app (Help › User
Manual). `tools/aurora/` holds the Aurora oracle
harness and the form (DFM) decoder; `docs/research/` the research briefs
(EE formats, rendering, tilesets, models, shaders, prior art, builders' pain points).

To drive Aurora (capture what it writes), run it on the off-screen display,
never on the user's desktop: `D=$(tools/aurora/headless.sh start)`, then
`DISPLAY=$D tools/aurora/run-aurora.sh` and `DISPLAY=$D tools/aurora/xdrive.py
shot|click|key|type|windows`; `tools/aurora/headless.sh stop` when done.
Captures that tests compare against go to `~/.local/share/moonglow-oracle/captures/`
(`mg_testkit::aurora_capture!`); like game data, they are not committed.

The game client is the renderer's oracle (`crates/mg-corpus-tests/tests/client_render.rs`,
ignored: `DISPLAY=:1 cargo test -p mg-corpus-tests --test client_render -- --ignored`).
It starts a scratch module with `+TestNewModule` and screenshots the client's
window. To read what the client actually computes, put a patched copy of the
game's own shader include in the scratch user directory's `override` (as
`light_uniforms_match_the_client` does): no tracing tools needed.

## Documents

`docs/` is an Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.2) bundle (the user-level `okf`
skill): start at `docs/index.md`. Every document opens with frontmatter
(`type`, `title`, `description`, `generated`, `sources`...), and `okf lint
docs --links` stays clean. After adding or changing one: `okf index docs`
and an entry in `docs/log.md`. Manual chapters carry frontmatter too; the
app shows them without it (`mg-ui/src/manual.rs`, whose tests require it).
The two generated documents get theirs from their generators
(`tools/aurora/uiinv/gen.py`, `crates/mg-corpus-tests/examples/observed_schema.rs`).

## Rules

- **Never write to the real NWN user folder** (`~/.local/share/Neverwinter
  Nights`) or the game install. Engine tests use scratch user directories under
  `target/test-output/` (`mg_testkit::engine`); the Aurora oracle runs in its
  own Wine prefix and user directory (`tools/aurora/run-aurora.sh`, state in
  `~/.local/share/moonglow-oracle`).
- **Run the game client only through `tools/nwclient/run-client.sh
  SCRATCH`**, on the off-screen display: a bubblewrap sandbox with a
  read-only system, Steam hidden (no Steam API, presence or cloud sync), no
  network, D-Bus or audio, and only SCRATCH writable (its user directory is
  SCRATCH/user). It refuses the desktop display :0.
- **Test servers stay private.** Run `nwserver` only through
  `mg_testkit::engine::run_server`, which passes `-publicserver 0` and random
  passwords; without them the server registers on Beamdog's public server
  list under the user's IP.
- **Game data is never committed.** Tests read the user's install; fixtures in
  the repo contain only data we author.
- **Lossless editing.** Readers keep everything (unknown GFF fields, duplicate
  labels, odd entries) and typed layers edit the raw tree in place, so an
