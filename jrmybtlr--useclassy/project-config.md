# Development Principles

The UseClassy plugin follows strict development principles to maintain high performance, type safety, and minimal complexity. The core implementation in [src/useClassy.ts](mdc:src/useClassy.ts) demonstrates these principles.

## Performance First

1. **Vite Integration**
   - Direct integration with Vite's plugin system
   - Uses Vite's built-in file watching and caching
   - Avoids redundant file processing
   - Maintains minimal memory footprint

2. **Efficient Processing**
   - Uses regex-based transformations for speed
   - Implements caching to avoid reprocessing unchanged files
   - Skips unnecessary file reads and transformations
   - Processes files only when needed during development

## TypeScript Best Practices

1. **Strong Typing**
   - All functions and interfaces are fully typed
   - No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
   - Extensive use of TypeScript interfaces for plugin options
   - Type guards for safe runtime checks

2. **Type Safety**
   - Strict null checks enabled
   - Explicit return types on public functions
   - Proper error handling with type checking
   - No type assertions unless unavoidable

## Minimal Surface Area

1. **Code Organization**
   - Single primary file for core logic
   - Functions are small and focused
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Minimal internal state

2. **Zero Dependencies**
   - Only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs, path, crypto)
   - No external runtime dependencies
   - Vite as only peer dependency
   - Reduces security and maintenance burden

## Example of Principles

```typescript
// Bad: Multiple dependencies, complex logic
import _ from 'lodash';
import globby from 'globby';
function processFiles(pattern: any) { ... }

// Good: Built-in modules, clear types, focused logic
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
function processFile(filePath: string): string { ... }
```

These principles ensure the plugin remains fast, reliable, and maintainable while keeping the codebase small and focused.
