# Git Conventions

Conventional Commits are **enforced repo-wide** by the `commit-msg` hook
(`uv run cz check`, pure Python — no Node). The allowed types and the schema
regex live in `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.commitizen.customize]`) and are guarded
by `tests/arch/test_commit_convention.py`. This document is the human-readable
source of truth those reference; keep all three in sync.

## Commit Types — Use the Correct Type

Reserve `fix` **exclusively** for real bug fixes — something was broken **in production** (on `main`), now it works. Misusing `fix` pollutes the auto-generated changelog.

### `fix` in feature branches

If you created the code **and** the bug in the same feature branch, it's not a `fix`. You're refactoring your own unshipped work:

```
# ❌ WRONG — AppLink was created in this branch, not shipped yet
fix(ui): harden AppLink against XSS and correct prop spread order

# ✅ CORRECT — refactoring new code before it ships
refactor(ui): harden AppLink against XSS and correct prop spread order

# ❌ WRONG — our own new password toggle broke the e2e locator
fix(e2e): use getByRole for password field to avoid toggle collision

# ✅ CORRECT — adjusting tests for our own new feature
test(e2e): use getByRole for password field to avoid toggle collision
```

**Rule of thumb:** if the bug doesn't exist on `main`, it's not a `fix`.

```
# ❌ WRONG — not a bug fix, and scope should be the file or area
fix(ci): fix CI concurrency and duplicate Docker builds on main

# ✅ CORRECT — use the type that matches the change
ci(release.yaml): fix CI concurrency and duplicate Docker builds on main
```

### Type reference

| Type       | Use for                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New user-facing feature                      |
| `fix`      | Bug fix (something was broken, now it works) |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                     |
| `ci`       | CI/CD pipeline changes                       |
| `chore`    | Dependency updates, tooling, configs         |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                           |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace (no logic change)     |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring (no behavior change)      |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                      |
| `build`    | Build system or external deps (Docker, pkg)  |
| `revert`   | Reverting a previous commit                  |

This table must match the types in the `schema_pattern` regex in
`pyproject.toml`. If you add or remove a type, update both and the arch test.

### Scope

The scope is **mandatory** (the hook rejects a message with no scope). Always
include it in parentheses: `ci(ci.yml)`, `test(e2e)`, `chore(deps)`, `fix(security)`.

## PR Title Format

The PR title becomes the squash commit message on `main`. Format:

```
type(scope): concise description
```

GitHub automatically appends `(#PR)` on squash merge.

## Squash Commit Body

When squash merging, **replace** the auto-generated list of individual commits with a clean summary:

```
type(scope): concise description (#137)

Brief paragraph explaining what changed and why.

- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2
- Specific change 3
```

Do NOT dump individual branch commits into the body. Keep it concise and accurate to the final state of the PR.

### Real examples from this repo

```
fix(security): reject unknown fields in permission rules (#135)

PermissionRule had extra: "allow" (Pydantic config), so unknown fields
like "pattern" were silently accepted. A rule with only unrecognized
fields has no conditions — matches everything — and allows the request
before system safety rules are reached.

Changes:
- PermissionRule: extra: "forbid" — rejects unknown fields on input
- PermissionRuleOut: new output model for read responses
- Remove manual _-prefix stripping in _write_credential_permissions
```

```
fix(ci): fix CI concurrency and duplicate Docker builds on main (#138)

Three issues fixed:

1. cancel-in-progress: true was cancelling CI runs when multiple PRs
   merged to main in quick succession. Changed to only cancel on PR
   branches, never on main.
2. ci-docker.yml triggered on push to main AND was called by
   docker-publish.yml — running the Docker build twice.
```

## PR Merge Strategy

Always use **squash + merge** when merging PRs. This keeps `main` history clean — one commit per PR — and prevents transient in-progress commits from leaking into the auto-generated changelog.

When creating PRs with `gh pr create`, remind the user to use squash merge.

## Issue Linking

Use `Closes #N` or `Fixes #N` in the PR body to auto-close related issues on merge.
