# Session contract

This repository demonstrates owner-directed research using fictional content.
Infer scope and authorization from ordinary conversation. Do not ask the owner
to operate the harness as a configuration system.

## Boot

Read this file first and classify the task.

- Meta or repository work needs no fictional thread state.
- For mathematical work, read `docs/PROJECT-FOUNDATIONS.md`, then `STEERING.md`
  and the relevant `threads/<thread>/LEDGER.md`. The foundations file is common
  mathematical boot state: use it without rederiving its contents or presenting
  them as new.
- Read `threads/INDEX.md` only when the thread is unclear or the task concerns
  the thread directory.
- Follow ledger citations only as the task needs them. Do not load every note or
  claim by default.
- For literature work, also read `docs/LITERATURE.md`.
- For a durable computation or counterexample, read `docs/COMPUTATIONS.md`.
- For collaboration with agents lacking repository access, read
  `docs/COLLABORATION.md`.
- Read `docs/CAMPAIGN-CONTRACT.md` before an exact full-resolution campaign.
- Read `docs/REPORTS.md` before producing a substantial owner-facing report.

## Authority and scope

The conversation is the control plane. `docs/RESEARCH-MODES.md` describes four
authorization profiles: bounded task, directed investigation, full-resolution
campaign, and theory-development program.

- Do not start a standalone campaign or new program without owner approval.
- Creating a new durable mathematical thread requires owner approval. An
  approved program may organize temporary strands inside its existing thread.
- Do not expand diagnosis into implementation, recording into publication, or
  a scoped investigation into a broader agenda.
- Literature search and normal scratch work are authorized inside an authorized
  research task.
- Continue while a credible in-scope next step has worthwhile expected value.
  Return on resolution, owner dependency, precise obstruction, or clearly
  diminishing expected value.
- Current opportunities are a nonexhaustive map, not a queue.
- Recorded failures are evidence, not prohibitions; only explicit owner
  exclusions are binding.

Owner phrases retain their ordinary meaning. “Go for it” begins the proposed
attack. “Pivot” asks for a materially different direction. “Record this as
progress” marks significance without upgrading correctness. “Put this in the
paper” authorizes paper editing; recording progress or preparing a report does
not.

Only the owner changes durable owner direction, designates owner priority,
parks or resumes a thread, or supports `proved/owner-checked`. Agents maintain
factual canonical state at the evidence level actually established.

## Evidence and communication

Use ordinary mathematical language in owner-facing communication. Define
nonstandard notation before relying on it. Distinguish proved, computed,
refuted, equivalent-strength, conditional, and open statements.

Chat mathematics uses CLI-readable Markdown, plain text, Unicode, and inline
code rather than assuming a TeX renderer.

Use evidence statuses literally:

- `proved/owner-checked`: the owner explicitly checked the proof;
- `proved/literature`: the exact claim, hypotheses, scope, and conventions match
  an identified source;
- `proved/agent`: an agent proof not yet owner-checked;
- `verified-computationally`: state the exact finite scope;
- `unverified`: an inherited or reported claim without certified support, not a
  newly proposed conjecture;
- `open`, `refuted`, `disputed`, and `parked`: use literally.

An equivalent-strength reformulation is not a resolution. A bounded
calculation has only its recorded scope. Preserve another agent’s provenance
and audit load-bearing claims in proportion to their role.

## Literature

Check the existing local source catalog before beginning discovery. Then search
appropriate public catalogs and source repositories. Prefer arXiv TeX when it
is available for exact reading and checkable line locators. Use the PDF
alongside it when layout, diagrams, page numbering, or visual verification
matters, and control the exact version when differences matter.

Use the ignored `references/` workspace for source files and derivatives. Do
not modify source originals or treat local availability as owner knowledge or
endorsement.

Use `proved/literature` only after matching the exact claim, assumptions, scope,
and conventions to an identified source. Record bibliographic identity and a
checkable locator. When extraction or recognition may be unreliable, verify
load-bearing text against the source image. Follow `docs/LITERATURE.md`.

## Computations

Use the computational tools chosen for the project. Add a second implementation
only when it serves a concrete research or verification purpose.

Run the repository's Python support utilities through `uv run` and install their
declared dependencies with `uv sync`. See `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`.

Reusable maintained code belongs in `lib/`. One-off programs belong in
`experiments/<thread>/` and must not be imported as a library. Disposable probes
belong in `.research-scratch/`. Promote experiment logic to `lib/` with tests
when it becomes reusable.
