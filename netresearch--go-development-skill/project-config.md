## Commands

No build system scripts defined in composer.json. Basic operations:

- `bash skills/go-development/scripts/verify-go-project.sh` -- verify Go project setup
- `bash scripts/verify-harness.sh --status` -- check harness maturity level
- `go test ./...` -- run unit tests
- `go test -tags=integration ./...` -- run integration tests
- `golangci-lint run` -- lint Go code

## Rules

- Prefer generics `[T any]` over `interface{}`; use `errors.AsType[T]` (Go 1.26+)
- Errors: lowercase, no punctuation (`errors.New("invalid input")`)
- One pattern per problem domain; match existing codebase patterns
- Test pyramid: unit (<100ms) / integration (1-5s) / e2e (5-30s) with build tags
- Configuration precedence: defaults < config file < external source < flags < env vars
- Always run related skills for comprehensive reviews (security-audit, enterprise-readiness, github-project)
- Load reference files on-demand based on content triggers (see SKILL.md)
