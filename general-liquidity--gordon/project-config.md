# AGENTS.md — Gordon CLI

This file is an alias for [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). Tools that look for `AGENTS.md` (OpenAI Codex / Cursor / various MCP clients) and tools that look for `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code) both find the same agent onboarding doc.

The full content lives in `CLAUDE.md`. The essentials below let an agent get oriented without opening a second file.

## What Gordon is

A TypeScript trading agent on Bun + Mastra. Connects to crypto exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX) and equity brokers (IB, Alpaca, Trading 212). Proposes trades, runs backtests, scans markets, hosts a proactive radar.

**Not a coding agent.** Most patterns from coding-agent references map onto trading only loosely. Translate before assuming.

## Hard rules

1. **Grep before claiming a feature is missing.** This has surfaced false-positive gaps repeatedly — the codebase is more mature than first impressions suggest. See `~/.claude/projects/C--Users-adria-Downloads-gordon-cli-alpha/memory/MEMORY.md` for what's already shipped.
2. **No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` in commit messages.**
3. **Use `.ts` extensions on relative imports** (Bun convention).
4. **Conventional-commit prefix** on every commit.
5. **Confirm before risky actions** (force pushes, destructive git ops).
6. **`bun test <path>`** for tests, **`bun tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`** for typecheck. Both must be clean before commit.
