# AktionFilmAI Project Rules

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use async/await over promises
- Keep API routes in `app/api/`
- Use server components by default, add "use client" only when needed

## File Organization
- Components in `components/`
- Utilities in `lib/`
- API routes in `app/api/`
- Hooks in `hooks/`

## Security
- Never expose API keys in client code
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Validate all user input
- Use rate limiting on API routes
