# Repository Working Rules

## Primary objective

Work efficiently in this repository with high signal and low waste:
- minimize unnecessary token-heavy exploration
- preserve correctness over convenience
- prefer structural discovery before broad file reading
- verify implementation details in source before making strong claims

## Core tool policy

Use GitNexus first for:
- understanding unfamiliar modules
- discovering symbol relationships
- tracing callers, callees, and execution flow
- estimating blast radius before edits
- analyzing cross-file impact
- multi-file refactors or renames
- diff-to-impact analysis after larger edits

Use grep/read first for:
- exact string matches
- regex searches
- quick lookup in a known file
- line-level verification
- checking a tiny local detail after the relevant file is already known
- cases where GitNexus is unavailable, stale, or inconclusive

## Preferred exploration workflow

When the task involves codebase understanding or non-trivial edits, use this order:

1. Use GitNexus `query` to find the most relevant symbols, files, or modules.
2. Use GitNexus `context` to inspect callers, callees, related symbols, and nearby structure.
3. Before significant edits, use GitNexus `impact` to estimate blast radius.
4. Only then open the minimum necessary files and read the minimum necessary code.
5. Use grep only for exact text confirmation, regex, or very local verification.
6. After broader edits, use `detect_changes` or an equivalent diff-aware check.

## Quality guardrails

- Do not start with broad repo-wide grep if GitNexus can narrow the search first.
- Do not claim runtime behavior from a graph path alone.
- Treat GitNexus relationship paths as structural hints until source code confirms them.
- If GitNexus suggests a call chain, verify critical links in actual code before presenting them as fact.
- If GitNexus results are thin or ambiguous, escalate to targeted source reading rather than broad searching.
- If multiple repositories are indexed, specify the repo explicitly instead of retrying ambiguous commands.
- Before multi-file changes, always estimate impact first.
- After edits, validate with the smallest relevant test or verification command.

## Decision rules: when to use which

Choose GitNexus first when:
- the code is unfamiliar
- the question is “who calls this”, “what does this affect”, “where is the entry point”
- the task spans multiple files
- the task involves architecture, dependencies, or relationships
- you need a fast structural map before deeper reading

Choose grep/read first when:
- the user gave an exact file
- the user gave an exact string or regex target
- the task is a tiny local check
- you already know the relevant file and only need confirmation
- you need exact implementation details, edge cases, or behavioral nuance

## How to combine them

Best practice is not GitNexus-only or grep-only.

Use GitNexus to narrow the search area quickly.
Then use targeted grep/read to confirm semantics, edge cases, and exact behavior.
Summaries should clearly separate:
- graph-indicated structure
- code-verified behavior

## Editing behavior

Before editing:
- identify target symbols and likely affected files
- estimate impact for non-trivial changes

During editing:
- avoid unrelated churn
- keep changes scoped and consistent with repository style

After editing:
- inspect diff impact
- run the smallest relevant validation
- summarize affected files, risks, and any unverified assumptions

## Output style

For exploration tasks:
- first provide a concise structural summary
- then deepen only where the task requires

For implementation tasks:
- summarize what changed
- summarize why those files were chosen
- summarize impact, validation, and remaining risk

## 开发记录规则

当你完成以下任意一类操作后，必须在 `docs/DEVLOG.md` 顶部（`---` 分隔线下方）追加一条记录：

1. **修复了一个非显而易见的 bug**（根因不是一眼能看出的，或者排查花了超过 10 分钟）
2. **做了一次技术选型或架构调整**（为什么选 A 不选 B、为什么从旧方案改成新方案）
3. **解决了一个性能 / 兼容性 / 部署问题**（构建失败、环境冲突、线上故障等）
4. **发现了一个值得复用的模式或教训**（踩了坑后总结出的通用规则）

记录格式严格遵循：

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] 一句话标题

- 现象/目标：（遇到了什么问题，或想达成什么）
- 根因/思路：（真正的原因是什么，排查思路是怎样的）
- 解法：（最终怎么解决的）
- 教训/可复用点：（下次遇到类似问题可以怎么避免或快速定位）
```

规则约束：
- 只记上述四类。常规增删改功能、纯语法问题、一搜就有标准答案的，**不要记**
- 每条不超过 8 行，保持精炼
- 如果这次改动不属于上述任何一类，在汇报结尾说一句"本次无需记录"，不要硬记
- 跨项目的通用经验（不局限于 AgentArena 的），额外标注 `[通用]` 前缀

## Project-specific skills

This repo already keeps several project skills under `.skills/`. Add the following Codex repo skills for current gaps:

- `agentarena-adapter-readiness`: 外部 agent 可用性、登录态、doctor 和 adapter 列表问题
- `agentarena-report-replay-triage`: 报告页、回放、trace 和结果渲染排查

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **RepoArena** (9619 symbols, 16910 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
