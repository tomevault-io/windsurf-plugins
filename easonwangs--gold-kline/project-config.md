# Git 提交要求

Every implementation task that changes files MUST end with a git commit before the final response.

- Inspect `git status` before editing and treat pre-existing or concurrent changes as user-owned.
- Review the final diff and run proportionate verification before committing.
- Stage only files or hunks that belong to the current task. Never bundle unrelated changes unless the user explicitly asks.
- Use a concise descriptive commit message on `main`, report the commit hash, and do not push, amend, or rewrite history unless asked.
- Read-only tasks and tasks with no file changes do not create empty commits.
