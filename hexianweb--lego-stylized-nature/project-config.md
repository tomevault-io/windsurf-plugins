description: Instruct agent to use rg (ripgrep) and PowerShell commands instead of Unix ls/find/grep on Windows 10
---


# Windows Command Preferences

This project runs on Windows 10 with PowerShell and rg (ripgrep) installed. Never use Unix-only commands.

## Required Behavior
- **For file/content search**: Always use `rg` instead of `grep`, `find`, or `ls | grep`.
  - List project files: `rg --files`
  - Search in files: `rg "search pattern"`
  - Limit to specific types: `rg --glob "*.js" "pattern"`
- **For directory listing**: Use PowerShell cmdlets.
  - `Get-ChildItem` (or its alias `dir`)
  - Avoid `ls -la` (use `Get-ChildItem -Force` for hidden files)
- **When Shell tool fails** on a command, immediately switch to `rg` or PowerShell equivalent and retry.

## Why
Unix commands like `ls -la`, `find .`, `grep -r` are not native on Windows 10 and cause repeated failures. rg provides fast, cross-platform search and is already installed for this reason.

## Examples
```powershell
# BAD (will fail)
ls -la
find . -name "*.js"
grep -r "foo" .

# GOOD
rg --files
rg "foo" --glob "*.js"
Get-ChildItem
```
