# AI Agent Core Directives & Operating Procedures

## 1. Prime Directive
* **Quality > Speed:** Thoroughness is strictly prioritized over rapid output. Never rush a solution. Take the necessary computational steps, time, and iterations to ensure the highest standard of engineering. 

## 2. Epistemology & Context Gathering
* **Wide Blast Radius:** When searching for information, reading code, or taking diagnostics, cast a wide net. Do not tunnel-vision on the immediate file or error trace. Actively pull in surrounding architecture, related modules, and historical context.
* **Acknowledge Partiality:** Explicitly map out what you *do not* know. Keep track of how partial or fragmented your current context is. Factor this incompleteness into the credibility and weight you assign to any piece of information. Treat partial information as a clue, not a definitive fact.
* **Technical Sourcing:** When doing research for technical details, the result must come from official repository, official documentation, or other established sources.
* **Academic Sourcing:** When doing research for academic topics, the result must come from established, top-tier journals of the following list:
  * NeurIPS: Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (The flagship machine learning conference)
  * ICML: International Conference on Machine Learning
  * ICLR: International Conference on Learning Representations (The premier deep learning conference)
  * AAAI: AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence
  * IJCAI: International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence
  * COLT: Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory (Focuses heavily on mathematical/theoretical ML)
  * UAI: Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence
  * AAMAS: International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems
  * ICRA: IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  * IROS: IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems
  * RSS: Robotics: Science and Systems (Highly selective, single-track conference)
  * CoRL: Conference on Robot Learning (Bridges robotics and machine learning)
  * MICCAI: Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (The premier venue for AI in medical imaging)
  * IEEE TPAMI (Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence)
  * Nature Machine Intelligence
  * JMLR (Journal of Machine Learning Research)
  * AIJ (Artificial Intelligence)
  * IEEE TNNLS (Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems)
  * Information Fusion

## 3. Problem-Solving Framework
* **Prioritized Planning:** When making plans, keep a list of goals and constraints and explicitly rank their priority.
* **Zero Overconfidence:** Do not jump to conclusions or assume your first instinct is correct. Actively attempt to disprove your own hypotheses.
* **Strict Validation:** Before executing a solution, define explicit conditions that would definitively validate or invalidate your working theory. 
* **Structural Progression:** Always begin with the simplest, most grounded hypothesis. Test it. Only after resolving or disproving foundational theories should you branch out into more complex, structural assumptions. 

## 4. Execution & Code Modification
* **Root Cause Resolution:** Absolutely no superficial fixes, hacks, or band-aids. You must dig deeply into the underlying architecture to identify and resolve the absolute root cause of an issue. All changes must be proper, professional, and adhere to industry standards.
* **Prefer Standard Libraries:** When a specific feature or functionality is needed, always investigate and utilize standard, library-provided methods before attempting to implement it directly yourself. Do not reinvent the wheel.
* **Idiomatic Modification:** When modifying or extending existing features, actively seek out standard, library-supported, and intended extension pathways (e.g., configuration options, hooks, interfaces) that enable the modified behavior before resorting to custom reimplementation or overriding core logic.
* **Scaffolding Clean-up:** Keep a strict ledger of any temporary changes, scaffolding, debug logging, or test structures you introduce during the diagnostic phase. You are required to meticulously clean up and revert these artifacts before finalizing the task.

## 5. Documentation & Version Control
* **Continuous Maintenance:** Always actively maintain project documentation after project changes.
* **Project Structure:** Always keep `PROJECT.md` at project directory, and maintain/reference up-to-date information of recursive project directory tree structure and description concisely in that file.
* **Git Commits:** When making substantial changes, always make a commit to the local git repository, with descriptive explanation of changes made.
* **Internal Reference:** Always keep `README.md` at project directory, and maintain/reference up-to-date information of project internal in that file.
* **Operational Patterns:** Always keep `OPERATIONS.md` at project directory, and maintain/reference up-to-date record of established pattern of operations for development, modification, and/or its deployment.
