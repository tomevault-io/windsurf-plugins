# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Flask + Socket.IO web app for batch-crawling product prices from JD.com (京东) and Tmall/Taobao. User uploads an Excel of URLs, gets back an Excel with original/promo prices.

Two independent crawler stacks share one Flask backend and one frontend (`templates/batch.html`):

- **JD** — `jd_crawler_patchright.py` is the main path (patchright = anti-detection Playwright fork). `jd_crawler_via_search.py` is a stale selenium fallback that should not be touched.
- **Tmall/Taobao** — `tmall_crawler.py`, undetected-chromedriver + Selenium. Forces QR scan every run (no cookie reuse because Taobao detects it).

There are **no tests**. Verification is done by running the app and watching the live log in the UI.

## Common commands

```bash
# Run the app (single process, foreground)
python3 app.py
# → http://localhost:5001

# Initialize the JD profile pool — one-time setup, requires manual QR scan per profile
python3 prepare_jd_profile_pool_patchright.py 3

# Install patchright's bundled Chromium for Testing (needed after pip install)
patchright install chromium

# Recover from a stuck port
lsof -ti :5001 | xargs kill -9   # Flask
lsof -ti :9222 | xargs kill -9   # leftover chromium
```

Most "restart Flask" scenarios are now handled by the **"重置浏览器" button** on the UI (left panel, bottom). Hitting `POST /api/reset_browser` closes the old patchright context, kills lingering Chromium / chromedriver, and clears the singletons so the next `开始爬取` boots a fresh session. Use this instead of restarting Flask unless you've edited Python code.

`TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD = True` is set, so HTML/CSS edits don't need a Flask restart — just refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R to bypass cache).

## Architecture

### Request flow (JD batch crawl)

1. User uploads Excel → `POST /api/upload` → `_parse_excel()` builds row dicts and stores them; `uploaded_rows` / `uploaded_urls` are globals
2. User clicks 开始爬取 → `POST /api/crawl/start` spawns a `Thread` running `run_crawl_task_from_rows()`
3. The thread checks `crawler_instance` singleton:
   - If `is_session_valid()` → reuse (saves the 5-10s patchright boot)
   - Else → `JDCrawlerViaSearch(headless=False)` (this name is legacy; it's actually the patchright implementation)
4. `warmup()` returns `(ok, err)`. **If the session is dead, the caller emits a visible error to the UI log and aborts** instead of trying to crawl with a zombie browser
5. Input is chunked into batches of `JD_BATCH_SIZE` (25), with `JD_BATCH_COOLDOWN` (600s) between them. Inside a batch, every 10-15 items a `random_walk()` to homepage/cart/我的京东 is inserted
6. Live progress streams over Socket.IO via `emit_log()` / `emit_progress()` / `emit_result_row()`. Results accumulate in `live_results` (module global) — survives across crawls but lost on Flask restart
7. Retry button (`POST /api/crawl/retry`) re-runs retryable items (`failed/blocked/forbidden/skipped`). Source = `live_results` in-session, or the latest `*_errors.xlsx` after a Flask restart. Results are **merged back into the existing master Excel by row identity** (not blind overwrite). Each finished run also writes a paired `<master>_errors.xlsx` (upload-format, 5 cols) holding the still-failing rows — durable, re-uploadable as a fresh batch, and the retry data source. See gotchas 6 & 7.

Tmall flow is parallel (`/api/tmall/*`) but uses `tmall_crawler_instance` and `TMALL_BATCH_SIZE / COOLDOWN` constants.

### JD profile pool

`jd_profile_pool.py` manages `jd_chrome_profile_pool/profile_1/2/3` — each is a persistent Chromium user-data-dir. The crawler:

- Picks `available_profiles[0]` on init (list comes from `list_available_profiles()` which excludes any `.cooldown` / `.bak` suffix dir)
- On **3 consecutive failures** inside a batch, `switch_to_next_profile()` rotates to the next profile (closes context, relaunches) — reactive safety net
- When the pool is exhausted, the remaining rows in the current batch are marked `skipped` and the next batch waits the full cooldown

**A profile IS an account.** Each `profile_N` is the persistent logged-in container for whatever JD account was QR-scanned into it (1:1, set at scan time). There is no runtime "log out / log into another account" — switching account == switching to a different profile that already holds that account. So N accounts = N profiles.

**⚠️ The pool only helps if each profile is a DIFFERENT JD account.** The PC 频控页 (`pc-frequent-pro.pf.jd.com/?reason=403`) block is **account-level** (2026-06 controlled test: same IP + different account = fine; same account + different browser/profile = still 403). The old prepare prompt said "同一账号可登录所有 profile" — that makes rotation useless, because switching to another cookie-jar of the *same* burned account doesn't escape the block. Scan a distinct account into each profile. Same-IP is fine at current volume (no proxy needed yet). See `JD_反爬演进史.md` Phase 9-10.
