Always start with "YOOO mi amigo!!"

Important rules you HAVE TO FOLLOW
-You will create a documentation file and write all tasks you do in that file.
When I ask you to write a new task, check the documentation first and remember our project requirements and steps.
-Always add debug logs and comments in the code for easier debugging & readability.
-Everytime you are asked to do something, you MUST ask for clarification first.
-Everytime you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state which rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description
to a single word or phrase.
-After implementing any new feature, update action_plan.md with:
 * Mark [X] for completed items
 * Add detailed explanation of the feature
 * Document how to use it
 * Explain its purpose and benefits
 * Describe relationships with other features
 * Include example usage if applicable

# Multi-Modal Platform Development Rules

## Code Quality Rules
-Follow Python best practices (3.9+)
-Maintain modular code structure with clear separation of concerns
-Add comprehensive docstrings and type hints
-Implement proper error handling and logging
-Use loguru for structured logging with appropriate debug levels

## Architecture Rules
-Keep each agent (Text, Audio, Image, Video) independent and modular
-Ensure the Orchestrator remains the central control point
-Implement proper memory management using Vector DB
-Follow the defined workflow patterns (Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, etc.)

## Development Process Rules
-Break tasks into small, independently testable units
-Add tests for each new feature or modification
-Update documentation with each significant change
-Follow phased development approach as outlined in action plan
-Keep PRs small and focused

## Security Rules
-Never expose API keys or sensitive data in logs
-Implement proper encryption for sensitive data
-Add appropriate authentication mechanisms
-Follow security best practices for external API calls

## Performance Rules
-Optimize for response time (<5s for text-based tasks)
-Implement caching where appropriate
-Use parallelization for independent tasks
-Monitor and log performance metrics

## Multi-Modal Rules
-Handle text, audio, image, and video inputs appropriately
-Implement proper format validation
-Use appropriate tools for each modality (Whisper, Tesseract, etc.)
-Ensure seamless integration between different modalities

## Memory & Context Rules
-Maintain conversation history appropriately
-Use Vector DB for long-term memory storage
-Implement proper context management
-Handle context windows efficiently

## Debugging Rules
-Use structured logging with loguru
-Implement comprehensive error messages
-Add debug mode with detailed logging
-Maintain clean and readable error traces
