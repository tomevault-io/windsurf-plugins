# Knowledge Sources Guide

This repository aggregates knowledge from various sources for RAG systems. See the main [README.md](mdc:README.md) for a full overview.

## Key Data Sources

*   **ElizaOS Docs:** Technical documentation synced from the `elizaOS/eliza` repo into `docs/`. Originates from `packages/docs` in the source repo. Example: [docs/README.md](mdc:docs/README.md). Synced by [.github/workflows/sync.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/sync.yml).
*   **Daily Silk:** AI news from a Discord channel, fetched daily into `daily-silk/`. Files are named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Example: [daily-silk/2025-04-29.md](mdc:daily-silk/2025-04-29.md). Synced by [.github/workflows/sync.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/sync.yml).
*   **GitHub Activity:** Logs and summaries from `elizaos/elizaos.github.io` (`_data` branch), stored in `github/`. Contains daily, weekly, and monthly stats (`github/stats/`) and summaries (`github/summaries/`). Example: [github/summaries/day/2025-04-29.md](mdc:github/summaries/day/2025-04-29.md). Synced by [.github/workflows/sync.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/sync.yml).
*   **AI News:** Summaries related to ElizaOS and Hyperfy from `M3-org/ai-news` (`gh-pages` branch), stored in `ai-news/`. Example: [ai-news/elizaos/md/2025-04-29.md](mdc:ai-news/elizaos/md/2025-04-29.md). Synced by [.github/workflows/sync.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/sync.yml).
*   **Packages:** Documentation from the ElizaOS package ecosystem ([eliza.how/packages](mdc:https:/eliza.how/packages)), likely stored within `docs/packages/`.
*   **Partners:** Information about ElizaOS partners ([eliza.how/partners](mdc:https:/eliza.how/partners)), likely stored within `docs/partners/`.
