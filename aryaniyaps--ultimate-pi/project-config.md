description: graphify knowledge graph context
---


This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `GRAPHIFY_VIZ_NODE_LIMIT=200000 graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost). The default 5000-node viz cap skips and deletes `graphify-out/graph.html`; raising the limit keeps the merged graph’s HTML. If HTML is still missing, run `python scripts/regen_graphify_html.py`.
