# Global rules

## Programming Paradigms
- Never write defensive code. All logic must be backed by real evidence.
- Compose functions, build abstractions, separate concerns, but not over-engineering.
- Minimize side effects.
- Prefer functional programming but keep performance in mind. Keep mutable states local or as less as possible.
- Analyze O-notion complexity.
- Keep it DRY.
- Choose declarative programming over imperative programming.

## Code styles

- Prefer small descriptive composable functions. Do NOT write mega functions.
- Should use comments. Especially EVERY mutable states must be documented and explained and be justified.
- TypeScript v7 strict mode. Use `tsc`, not `tsgo`.
- Prefer `import type` for type-only imports.
- Do not use wide type casts. In particular, never use `as any` or `as never`.
  but narrow down cast like `as const` is allowed.
- Do not use default arguments in functions or React components.
- 4 spaces, single quotes, no trailing commas. Use biome to fix files directly.
- File names are kebab-case.
- React components are PascalCase.
- Functions and variables are camelCase.
- Hooks are camelCase and must start with `use`.
- If a file has exactly one export, the file name must match that export in kebab-case.
- {} code block should not use shorthand syntax.


## Git
Multiple pi sessions may be running in this cwd at the same time, each modifying different files.
Git operations that touch unstaged, staged, or untracked files outside your own changes will stomp on other sessions' work.
Resolve conflicts only in files you modified.
If a conflict is in a file you did not modify, abort and ask the user.
Ignore unrelated files' changes.

## Bash Timeout
bash timeout should never be longer than 30 seconds.

# Design Feature
When designing a feature, I don't care about compatibility. I want the best architecture with the best readability and best simplicity.
Do not over-engineering. I don't want many moving parts with duplicated slop code.
If the new features intersect with old behaviors, design it more general that the new features cover broader cases so
the old codes are no longer needed. You should never propose "minimalistic change". Suggest as elegant and simply as possible.
Never be conservative, always be progressive.


# User Override
If the user's instructions conflict with any rule in AGENTS.md files, ask for explicit confirmation before overriding. Only then execute their instructions.

# Monorepo Context

This repository is a pnpm v11 workspace for `vite-plugin-taro`, a Vite 8 / React 19 / Taro integration that builds
shared apps for WeChat Mini Program (`wx`) and H5 targets.

- `packages/vite-plugin-taro`: publishable Vite plugin package. Source lives in `src`, build output is `dist`, and
  package README files are synced during build.
- `packages/create-vite-taro`: publishable project generator package (`create-vite-taro`) with templates under
  `templates/default`.
- `packages/taro-react`: generated React 19-compatible fork of `@tarojs/react`, published as `vite-plugin-taro-react`.
- `packages/taro-plugin-framework-react`: generated React 19-compatible fork of `@tarojs/plugin-framework-react`,
  published as `vite-plugin-taro-plugin-framework-react`.
- `packages/loan-genius`: sample app used to test the plugin against `h5` and `wx` targets.
- `packages/native-comp-demo`: wx-only development project for native custom-component integration.
- `packages/hmr-stress-demo`: wx-only deep React tree fixture for paced and burst HMR stress tests.
- `patches`: local patches applied to upstream Taro 4.2.0 packages when regenerating the generated packages.

Node.js v26+ is available and can execute TypeScript natively.
