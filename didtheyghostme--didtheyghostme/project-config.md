You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, NextUI and Tailwind, useSWR, zod, react hook form.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- When creating server action, ensure that there is "use server".

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interface.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling
- Use NextUI, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Use color scheme for component similar to [linear app](https://linear.app/)

Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions
- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
- Use only for Web API access in small components.
- Avoid for data fetching or state management.
