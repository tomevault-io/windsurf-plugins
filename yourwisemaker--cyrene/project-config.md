# Cyrene Project Rules

## Code Style
- Use `thiserror` for error enums, `anyhow` only in the binary
- All public types derive `Debug`, `Clone`, `Serialize`, `Deserialize` where appropriate
- Use `#[must_use]` on pure functions and builders
- Async traits use `#[async_trait]`

## Architecture
- Each subsystem is its own crate under `crates/`
- Core types in `cyrene-core` have zero app-specific dependencies
- The Plugin Registry uses factory closures, not direct dependencies on adapter crates
- Extensions depend only on `cyrene-sdk`, never on internal crates

## Safety
- No secrets in code: load from env/`.env` only
- Every action must produce a receipt for the ledger
- Autonomy defaults: low=auto, medium=approval, high=blocked
- Untrusted content goes through the injection scanner first

## Testing
- Property-based tests (proptest) for invariants
- Unit tests in each crate's `#[cfg(test)]` module
- Integration tests in `tests/` directories
- Use `tempfile` for filesystem-dependent tests
