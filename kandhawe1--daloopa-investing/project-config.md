# Daloopa Financial Analysis Toolkit

This is a financial analysis toolkit powered by Daloopa's institutional-grade financial data, designed for hedge fund analysts doing fundamental equity research.

## Analyst Context
- Perspective: long/short equity, fundamental analysis
- Data source: Daloopa MCP server (SEC filings, earnings, financial statements)
- Market data: MCP-first (use whatever market data MCP the user has configured), fallback to `infra/market_data.py`
- Consensus estimates: optional (when available, adds beat/miss and forward context)
- All analysis should be thorough, data-driven, and cite sources
- Follow `design-system.md` for number formatting, analytical density, and styling

## MCP Tool Workflow
Always follow this pattern when working with Daloopa data:

1. **`discover_companies`** — Look up company by ticker or name to get `company_id`
2. **`discover_company_series`** — Find available financial metrics and KPIs for the company
3. **`get_company_fundamentals`** — Pull actual data for specific series and periods
4. **`search_documents`** — Search SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K) for qualitative information

## Market Data
Market data uses whatever MCP the user has configured (preferred), falling back to `infra/market_data.py` if no market data MCP is available. See `.claude/skills/data-access.md` Section 2 for the full resolution order.

Fallback scripts (when no MCP provides market data):
- `python infra/market_data.py quote TICKER` — price, market cap, shares, beta
- `python infra/market_data.py multiples TICKER` — P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S, P/B
- `python infra/market_data.py history TICKER --period 2y` — historical OHLCV
- `python infra/market_data.py peers TICKER1 TICKER2 ...` — side-by-side multiples
- `python infra/market_data.py risk-free-rate` — 10Y Treasury from FRED

## Design System
All skills reference `.claude/skills/design-system.md` for consistent formatting:
- Number formatting ($X.Xbn, X.X%, X.Xx multiples, +/-Xbps)
- Three-layer analytical density (data point + context + implication)
- Table conventions (columns = periods, rows = metrics, growth sub-rows)
- Commentary blocks after every major table
- Color palette (navy #1B2A4A, steel blue #4A6FA5, gold #C5A55A)

## Citation Format
Every financial figure must link back to its Daloopa source:
```
[$X.XX million](https://daloopa.com/src/{fundamental_id})
```
Example: Revenue grew to [$75.2 billion](https://daloopa.com/src/113433925)

## Table Format
Always use standard financial analysis layout:
- **Columns** = time periods (Q1 2024, Q2 2024, etc.)
- **Rows** = financial metrics (Revenue, Net Income, etc.)

## Guidance vs Actuals Rules
- Quarterly guidance from Q(N) applies to Q(N+1) results
- Annual guidance from Q1/Q2/Q3 applies to current fiscal year
- Annual guidance from Q4 applies to NEXT fiscal year
- Never compare same-quarter guidance to same-quarter actual

## Key Operating KPIs
When analyzing any company, always discover and include company-specific KPIs beyond standard financials (e.g., subscribers, ARR, GMV, same-store sales, DAU/MAU, ARPU, units, bookings, backlog).

## Reports
All generated analysis is saved to the `reports/` directory. Reports are gitignored so each analyst generates their own. Word documents, Excel models, PDFs, and decks are also saved there.
