# AGENTS.md

## Repository Overview

reins — Open-source CLI that operationalizes harness engineering. Scaffold, audit, evolve, and doctor any project's agent-readiness. Zero dependencies, Bun-powered.

## Product Model (Must Keep Clear)

- `cli/reins` is the product engine. It is the only source of truth for readiness scoring and JSON outputs.
- `skill/Reins` is the control-plane wrapper for coding agents. It decides when/how to call CLI commands and how to parse results.
- Humans steer outcomes. Agents execute the loop using Reins outputs.
- Reins exists to transfer proven harness patterns into any repo so agents can become more autonomous and consistent over time.

When updating docs or workflows, preserve this separation explicitly. Do not duplicate scoring logic in the skill layer.

## Architecture

See ARCHITECTURE.md for domain map, module structure, and dependency rules.

## Development Workflow

1. Receive task via prompt
2. Read this file, then follow pointers to relevant docs
3. Keep CLI command routing in `cli/reins/src/index.ts`; put reusable internals in `cli/reins/src/lib/` (especially `lib/commands/` and `lib/audit/`)
4. Run tests: `cd cli/reins && bun test`
5. Self-audit: `cd cli/reins && bun src/index.ts audit ../..`
6. Self-review changes for correctness and style
7. Open PR with concise summary
8. Resolve all PR conversations/comments before merge (GitHub review threads, CodeRabbit threads, and agent comments when applicable)

## Key Constraints

- Zero external runtime dependencies — stdlib only (fs, path)
- Single entrypoint CLI at `cli/reins/src/index.ts` with shared internals in `cli/reins/src/lib/`
- All commands output deterministic JSON
- Tests are co-located (`index.test.ts` next to `index.ts`)
- All knowledge lives in-repo, not in external tools
- Bun is the runtime; Node.js/tsx fallback via `bin/reins.cjs`
- Merge discipline: treat unresolved PR conversations as a hard block when branch protection requires conversation resolution

## Golden Principles

See docs/golden-principles.md for the full set of mechanical taste rules.
