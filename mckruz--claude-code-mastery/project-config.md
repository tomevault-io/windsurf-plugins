### Context from Nexus
#### Roadmap: Next Features
User-approved feature ideas (2026-03-24):

1. **MCP Tool Intelligence Layer** — Nexus sits on mcp-hub, learns which tools succeed/fail per project, i…

#### Backlog: Show all active MCP servers in Claude Config tab
The Claude Config dashboard page only shows MCP servers from settings.json/settings.local.json, not the full set of running servers (plugins + projec…

### Recorded Decisions
- **[security]** Sanitize and rotate credentials after eval runs that may expose secrets
  > During test case TC-003, a real GitHub PAT was exposed in skill output. Established practice to rotate credentials and document secret exposure risks in eval framework.
- **[security]** Sanitize eval test harness to prevent credential leakage from settings files
  > Eval run exposed GitHub PAT token when skill accessed actual settings.json during MCP config test
- **[security]** Include platform-aware syntax validation in evaluations — specifically test Win…
  > TC-005 and TC-003 explicitly validate Windows-compatible output; 15% of benchmark criteria allocated to platform awareness
- **[architecture]** Add failure-mode test cases for adversarial input and edge cases before finaliz…
  > After initial 5 test cases passed at 100%, added TC-006, TC-007, TC-008 to test adversarial users, contradictory platform info, and cold-start scenarios. Discovered that robustness under adversarial conditions should be weighted (10%).
- **[architecture]** Use anchored, objective assertion types for eval scoring instead of subjective …
  > Initial eval used vague assertions like 'sequence_check' and subjective descriptions. Refactored to use concrete assertion types: contains, regex, question_before_code (line position), json_valid, token_limit to reduce scoring ambiguity.

> **Cross-project rule**: Before making decisions that affect shared concerns (APIs, auth, data formats, deployment) or asking the user for server/SSH/infrastructure details, run `nexus_query` to check for existing decisions, notes, and conflicts across the portfolio.
