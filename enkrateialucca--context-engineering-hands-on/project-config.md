## Answering questions about the Repo

- Any question about this repo or the topic of context engineering should be answered by using this tool first to get the retrieve the information: `uv run demos/live-sesh-agent-claude-code/agent_tool_for_claude_code.py 'the question'`

O'Reilly live training course — **Context Engineering Hands-On** — teaching developers how to design, manage, and optimize the context that flows into LLMs and agentic systems. The repo holds slide decks, hands-on Python demos, and a Jupyter notebook across 5 sessions, all runnable via `uv run <script>.py` with an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var.
