# Project Agent Notes

## Project Identity

- PyPI distribution: `agent-markdown-pdf`
- CLI command: `mdtopdf`
- Python package: `mdtopdf`
- License: MIT
- Supported Python versions: 3.10 through 3.14
- Public positioning: agent-friendly Markdown-to-PDF CLI with HTML preview and JSON diagnostics.

Keep the CLI name, Python import path, entry point, JSON result fields, and
public API stable unless the user explicitly asks for a breaking change.

## Branch And Release Flow

- Do feature work on `feature/*` branches. Do not commit directly to `main`.
- Merge through PR after CI passes.
- Release versions are controlled by `pyproject.toml`.
- Release tags must be `vX.Y.Z` and must match `pyproject.toml`.
- Publishing is done by GitHub Actions release workflow using PyPI Trusted
  Publishing. Do not add PyPI tokens to repository secrets.
- Do not reuse an existing PyPI version. Use a patch version for compatible
  fixes such as docs, doctor checks, runtime guidance, and rendering stability
  fixes.

## CI Contract

Daily CI lives in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

- Runs on pushes to `main`, pull requests, and manual dispatch.
- Tests Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14.
- Installs native WeasyPrint libraries plus the Linux font baseline before
  installing the package.
- Runs `mdtopdf doctor --json`.
- Runs `python -m pytest tests/ -q`.
- Builds and checks distributions with `python -m build` and
  `python -m twine check dist/*`.

Release CI lives in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

- Runs on `v*` tag push.
- Repeats the Python test matrix.
- Verifies the tag matches `pyproject.toml`.
- Builds source and wheel distributions.
- Publishes to PyPI through `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1`.

## Local Verification

Use PowerShell on Windows. Prefer `py` over `python` on this machine.

Before opening a PR or release tag, run:

```powershell
py -m mdtopdf --version
py -m mdtopdf doctor --json
py -m pytest tests\ -q
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -LiteralPath dist, build, agent_markdown_pdf.egg-info -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
py -m build
py -m twine check dist\*
git diff --check
```

Only remove `dist`, `build`, or `agent_markdown_pdf.egg-info` after confirming
the command runs inside the repository root. Do not delete unrelated user files.

## Runtime Dependencies

WeasyPrint needs native libraries outside the Python wheel.

On Windows, the expected path is controlled through:

```powershell
$env:WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES = 'D:\Environment\msys64\mingw64\bin'
```

On Linux, install native libraries and the font baseline used by CI. Keep this
baseline aligned with the workflow files:

```shell
apt-get update
apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  fontconfig \
  libcairo2 \
  libffi-dev \
  libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-0 \
  libpango-1.0-0 \
  libpangoft2-1.0-0 \
  poppler-utils \
  shared-mime-info \
  fonts-dejavu-core \
  fonts-liberation \
  fonts-noto-cjk \
  fonts-stix
if apt-cache show fonts-cascadia-code >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends fonts-cascadia-code
fi
fc-cache -f
```

## Font Policy

The default theme uses a PDFium-safe Latin-first body font stack. Do not
casually reorder `mdtopdf/themes/default.css` font stacks.

- Latin fonts must stay before CJK fonts in the body and page-margin stacks so
  ASCII digits, dates, versions, and page counters do not land in CJK font
  subsets that Chrome/PDFium can render invisibly.
- Chinese text still falls back to CJK fonts. In the CJK fallback list,
  Linux should use redistributable open fonts such as `Noto Sans CJK SC`.
- Code blocks prefer `Cascadia Mono` / `Cascadia Code`, then system monospace
  fallbacks.
- Emoji spans use system emoji fonts. Linux should prefer monochrome
  `Noto Emoji`; `Noto Color Emoji` is a fallback because PDF viewers can render
  color emoji too small or misaligned.
- `mdtopdf` may reference proprietary system font names in CSS, but must not
  bundle, download, or redistribute Microsoft font files.
- Public Linux environments should use the open-font baseline: Liberation or
  DejaVu for Latin/digits, Noto CJK for Chinese, Cascadia where available for
  code blocks, STIX for math, and monochrome Noto Emoji for emoji where
  available.

`doctor --json` must distinguish runtime support from visual parity. Missing
Linux fonts should recommend installable open packages, not Microsoft YaHei or
Segoe UI Emoji.

## Rendering Checks

For ordinary style changes, use HTML preview first and PDF output as the final
layout check.

For Linux/PDFium issues, a passing text extraction check is not enough. Verify
visual rendering through Chrome/PDFium or `pypdfium2`, especially for:

- ASCII digits in mixed CJK documents
- dates such as `2026-06-22`
- versions such as `0.2.0` and `v1.0`
- identifiers such as `IT-001`
- page headers and footers

## Documentation Rules

- `README.md` is the English GitHub/PyPI long description.
- `README_CN.md` is the Chinese GitHub entry point.
- Keep commands in both READMEs consistent with the real CLI.
- The bundled skill is `mdtopdf/skills/SKILL.md`; README files should mention
  this path when describing Agent usage.
- Do not add a Dockerfile unless the user explicitly asks for a maintained
  container image. Runtime package snippets are enough for now.
