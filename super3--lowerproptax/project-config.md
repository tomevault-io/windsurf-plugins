# Instructions for Claude

## Git Operations

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT commit or push changes unless the user explicitly asks you to in that specific message.

- **ONLY** run `git commit` when the user's current message contains words like "commit" or "commit this"
- **ONLY** run `git push` when the user's current message contains words like "push" or "push this" or "commit and push"
- **DO NOT** assume the user wants to commit/push just because:
  - You made a code change
  - You fixed a bug
  - The user asked you to fix something
  - You previously committed/pushed in this conversation
- The user will explicitly tell you "commit" or "push" in their message when they want it done
- If unsure whether the user wants to commit/push, ask them first
