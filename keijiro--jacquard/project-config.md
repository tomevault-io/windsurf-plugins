========

A tile-based music sequencer: a score is tiles placed and stacked on a two-dimensional
plane, played by one runner per lane. Unity 6.6, UI Toolkit for everything except the
background visualizer, and a Burst FM synth on the Scriptable Audio Pipeline.

Where the reasoning lives
-------------------------

This codebase carries an unusual amount of written reasoning, and it is split on one
rule. **Read the right one and do not duplicate across the line.**

- **A code comment owns why that code is shaped the way it is.** This is the larger body
  and the authoritative one. Most files open with a header stating what the thing is for,
  what was tried, and what was measured; many members carry the argument for their own
  number. If you change what a comment describes, change the comment in the same edit.
- **`Docs/` owns what spans files or has no file.** The specification, the cross-cutting
  rules, the format's obligations, the rejected designs. The `impl-*.md` notes are maps —
  they say which rule lives where and point at the file that argues for it.
- **A commit message owns why the change happened at all.** What the tree was like before
  it, a design refused that left no code behind to carry the argument, a measurement that
  decided the change rather than a number in one file, an outside bug with a ticket
  number. It is the one of the three a reader reaches without knowing which file to open,
  and the only one that cannot be read out of the working tree at all.

So: **do not restate a file's header comment in a doc, do not move an argument out of a
file into a doc, and do not put in a commit body an argument the same commit is putting
into a comment.** A doc section that only paraphrases one file is redundant and will
drift.

Read this before touching that
------------------------------

`Docs/README.md` is the full index. The short version:

| Working on | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Anything about the sequencer's rules | `Docs/sequencer-spec.md` — the terminology here is the terminology the code uses |
| Runners, timing, locks, the turn of the piece | `Docs/impl-sequencer.md` |
| The FM voice, the patch, lock targets | `Docs/impl-synth.md` |
| Buses, limiter, the output volume | `Docs/impl-mix.md` |
| Drivers, the DSP clocks, dropouts | `Docs/impl-audio.md` |
| The live effect buttons | `Docs/impl-live-fx.md` |
| The grid, cells, gestures | `Docs/impl-score-plane.md` |
| Panels and controls | `Docs/impl-panels.md` |
| Colours, metrics, type, marks | `Docs/impl-style.md` |
| The file format, the score folder | `Docs/impl-files.md` |
| The Web build | `Docs/impl-web.md` |
| Shipping a build, on any platform | `Docs/releasing.md` |

Read the one for the area you are touching, not all of them.

Layout
------

- **`Assets/Core`** — the model, the text format, the sequencer and the synth settings.
  The asmdef sets `noEngineReferences`, so **nothing here may reference `UnityEngine`**
  and the compiler enforces it. This is a goal rather than a law, but breaking it is a
  decision to raise rather than to make quietly.
- **`Assets/Jacquard`** — `Audio` (voice pool, buses, the Burst render job, the two
  drivers), `App` (the MonoBehaviour, editing operations, file access), `UI` (the plane,
  the panels), `Visual` (the visualizer, which nothing else may depend on).
- **`Assets/Editor`** — the scene builder and the self test.

`MathF` is not used in the DSP. Burst cannot resolve the externs behind it, and **one
`MathF` call takes the whole assembly's jobs down to managed execution** — so `FastMath`
spells out the sine and the exponential. See `Docs/architecture.md`.

Working on it
-------------

- **Jacquard > Run Self Test** — format round trip, four laps of the sample score without
  a device, the descent, the live effects, and the two effect buses. Run it after
  anything touching the format, the sequencer or the mix.
- **Jacquard > Rebuild Main Scene** — regenerates the scene from `SceneBuilder`.
- The project is meant to be driveable from the Unity CLI, so a change can be built, run
  and read back without a hand on the editor.
- Starting a worktree, copy the main worktree's `Library` into it before Unity opens
  there, with `cp -c`. Run it from inside the new worktree, and let git name the source
  rather than a relative path: worktrees usually land beside `main`, but where the tool
  that made them chose to put them is not something this file can promise.

  ```
  cp -Rc "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/../Library" Library
  ```

  A fresh worktree with no `Library` reimports the whole project on first open, which is
  minutes of waiting for a tree that is a few files different from one already imported.
  `-c` asks APFS for a copy-on-write clone, so the copy costs neither the time nor the
  disk of a real one — the two `Library` folders share their blocks until Unity rewrites
  a file, and only what it rewrites is paid for.

Two rules the format has cost mistakes for, both in `Docs/impl-files.md`: a target
leaving `ParamTargets` belongs in `ProjectFormat.Retired` in the same change, and a
target that changes what its number means belongs in a version bump with a conversion in
the same change.
