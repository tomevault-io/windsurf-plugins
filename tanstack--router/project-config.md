## Project overview

TanStack Router is a type-safe router with built-in caching and URL state management for React and Solid applications. This monorepo contains two main products:

- **TanStack Router** - Core routing library with type-safe navigation, search params, and path params
- **TanStack Start** - Full-stack framework built on top of TanStack Router

## Setup commands

- Install deps: `pnpm install`
- Setup e2e testing: `pnpm exec playwright install`
- Build packages: `pnpm build` (affected) or `pnpm build:all` (force all)
- Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
- Run tests: `pnpm test`

## Code style

- TypeScript strict mode with extensive type safety
- Framework-agnostic core logic separated from React/Solid bindings
- Type-safe routing with search params and path params
- Use workspace protocol for internal dependencies (`workspace:*`)
- Always use curly braces for `if`, `else`, loops, and similar control statements. Never write one-line bodies like `if (foo) x = 1`.

## Dev environment tips

- This is a pnpm workspace monorepo with packages organized by functionality
- Nx provides caching, affected testing, targeting, and parallel execution for efficiency
- Use `pnpm nx show projects` to list all available packages
- Target specific packages: `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit`
- Target multiple packages: `pnpm nx run-many --target=test:eslint --projects=@tanstack/history,@tanstack/router-core`
- Run affected tests only: `pnpm nx affected --target=test:unit`
- Exclude patterns: `pnpm nx run-many --target=test:unit --exclude="examples/**,e2e/**"`
- Navigate to examples and run `pnpm dev` to test changes: `cd examples/react/basic && pnpm dev`
- **Granular unit testing through Nx (recommended):**
  - Specific files: `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit -- tests/link.test.tsx tests/Scripts.test.tsx`
  - Test patterns: `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit -- tests/ClientOnly.test.tsx -t "should render fallback"`
  - Name patterns: `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit -- -t "navigation"` (all tests with "navigation" in name)
  - Exclude patterns: `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit -- --exclude="**/*link*" tests/`
  - List tests: `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit -- list tests/link.test.tsx` (or `-- list` for all)
- **Available test targets per package:** `test:unit`, `test:types`, `test:eslint`, `test:build`, `test:perf`, `build`
- **Testing strategy:** Package level (nx) → File-level args via nx → Test-level args (`-t`) via nx → Pattern-level args (`--exclude`) via nx
- **Agent execution guardrails (important):**
  - Always prefer `pnpm nx ...` over `npx nx ...`.
  - Prefer Nx targets over direct test runners so task dependencies (including required builds) remain in the graph.
  - In sandbox, run Nx with `CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run <project>:<target> --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache`
  - Run only one Nx command at a time.
  - If an Nx command shows no output for ~20 seconds, stop, run `pnpm nx reset` once, and retry once.
  - Do not loop retries indefinitely. If it still hangs or sandbox blocks graph/daemon behavior, request escalation immediately.

## Testing instructions

- **Critical**: Always run unit and type tests during development - do not proceed if they fail
- **Test types:** `pnpm test:unit`, `pnpm test:types`, `pnpm test:eslint`, `pnpm test:e2e`, `pnpm test:build`
- **Full CI suite:** `pnpm test:ci`
- **Fix formatting:** `pnpm format`
- **Efficient targeted testing workflow:**
  1. **Affected only:** `pnpm nx affected --target=test:unit` (compares to main branch)
  2. **Specific packages:** `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit`
  3. **Specific files:** `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit -- tests/link.test.tsx`
  4. **Specific patterns:** `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit -- tests/link.test.tsx -t "preloading"`
- **Pro tips:**
  - Use `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit -- list` to explore available tests before running
  - Use `-t "pattern"` to focus on specific functionality during development
  - Use `--exclude` patterns to skip unrelated tests
  - Keep all test filtering arguments behind `pnpm nx run ... -- ...` for maximum precision while preserving task dependencies
- **Example workflow:** `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit` → `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit -- tests/link.test.tsx` → `pnpm nx run @tanstack/react-router:test:unit -- tests/link.test.tsx -t "preloading"`

## PR instructions

- Always run `pnpm test:eslint`, `pnpm test:types`, and `pnpm test:unit` before committing
- Test changes in relevant example apps: `cd examples/react/basic && pnpm dev`
- Update corresponding documentation in `docs/` directory when adding features
- Add or update tests for any code changes
- Use internal docs links relative to `docs/` folder (e.g., `./guide/data-loading`)

## Package structure

**Core packages:**

- `packages/router-core/` - Framework-agnostic core router logic
- `packages/react-router/`, `packages/solid-router/` - React/Solid bindings and components
- `packages/history/` - Browser history management
