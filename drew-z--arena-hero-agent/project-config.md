# Repository Agent Rules

Before editing source, tests, deployment scripts, or project documentation, run:

```bash
python scripts/sync-main.py
```

Proceed only when it reports `up-to-date` or `fast-forwarded`. The command must
refuse a dirty tree, a branch other than `main`, a local-ahead branch, or a
divergence from `origin/main`; resolve those states explicitly instead of
merging automatically.

The live Arena Hero instance runs on the separately managed server. A local
process or checkout is not evidence of the deployed version. Production updates
must use `scripts/update-systemd.sh`, then verify both the service health and
`/opt/arena-hero-agent/current/source-commit`.

Never print or commit API keys, model credentials, environment-file contents,
player identifiers, or private operational logs.
