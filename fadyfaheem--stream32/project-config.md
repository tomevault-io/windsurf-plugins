# Google Engineering Practices

Baseline for how we author and review changes, adapted from
[google/eng-practices](https://github.com/google/eng-practices) (the Code
Reviewer's Guide and Change Author's Guide). Here a "CL" means one
self-contained change (a PR or commit); "LGTM" means a reviewer approves.

## Authoring changes (small CLs)

- **Keep CLs small and focused** — one self-contained change per CL. Small CLs are
  reviewed faster and more thoroughly, and are less likely to introduce bugs.
- **Separate unrelated work** into separate CLs (e.g. a refactor vs. a feature).
- **Write a good description:** an imperative summary line of _what_, then a body
  explaining _why_ and any context the reviewer needs. Avoid vague messages.

```
add stripe webhook signature verification

Webhooks were processed without verifying Stripe's signature, allowing
spoofed events. Validate the HMAC-SHA256 signature before processing.
```

## Reviewing changes

- **Standard:** approve once the change _definitely improves overall code health_,
  even if it is not perfect. Don't block on perfection.
- **Look at:** design, functionality, complexity, tests, naming, comments,
  consistency with the codebase, and documentation.
- **Prefer follow-ups for nitpicks.** Prefix non-blocking suggestions with `Nit:`.
- **Be timely and explain the _why_** behind feedback.
