## Subject Line Rules

1. **Use imperative mood** ("add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature")
2. **Don't capitalize** the first letter
3. **No period (`.`)** at the end
4. **Keep it under 50 characters** — aim for 40 to leave room for scope
5. **Be specific** — avoid vague terms like "update," "fix stuff," or "changes"

### Good Subjects

- `fix login validation on admin panel`
- `add support for WebP image format`
- `refactor database query builder`
- `remove deprecated API endpoints`

### Bad Subjects

- `fixed bug` ❌ (vague, past tense)
- `Update dependencies.` ❌ (period, vague)
- `WIP: random changes` ❌ (not descriptive)

---

## Body (Optional but Recommended)

Use the body to explain **why** the change was made, not what the code does (that should be clear from the code itself).

- Wrap at **72 characters** per line
- Separate from subject with a **blank line**
- Use bullet points or paragraphs as needed
- Reference issue numbers: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`

### Body Example

```
feat(payment): add Stripe webhook signature verification

Previously, webhooks were processed without verifying Stripe's
signature, creating a security vulnerability. Added HMAC-SHA256
validation using Stripe's published key.

This prevents replay attacks and spoofed payment events.

Closes #1234
```

---

## Footer (Optional)

Use footers for **breaking changes**, **issue references**, and **metadata**.

### Breaking Changes

Denote breaking changes with `BREAKING CHANGE:` prefix:

```
refactor(api): change authentication header format

BREAKING CHANGE: API now requires Authorization: Bearer <token>
instead of X-API-Key header. Clients must update within 30 days.
```

### Issue References

```
Closes #123
Fixes #456, #789
Relates to #999
```

---

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: New Feature with Scope

```
feat(search): add full-text search with Elasticsearch backend

Implemented full-text search using Elasticsearch 7.x. Users can now
search across all content types (posts, comments, user profiles) with
advanced filter options.

- Integrated Elasticsearch client library
- Created search indexing pipeline
- Added advanced filter UI component
- Optimized query performance for large datasets

Closes #567
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix

```
fix(auth): prevent session hijacking via XSS vulnerability

Cross-site scripting vulnerability in session token storage allowed
attackers to steal authentication cookies. Tokens are now stored in
httpOnly cookies and CSRF tokens validated on state-changing requests.

Closes #892
```

### Example 3: Refactoring

```
refactor(database): split User model into separate services

Extracted user authentication, profile management, and notification
preferences into dedicated service classes for better separation of
concerns and testability.
```

### Example 4: Breaking Change

```
feat(api)!: redesign REST API endpoints for v2

BREAKING CHANGE: API endpoints changed from /api/v1/* to /api/v2/*.
Request/response schemas have been redesigned for consistency.

Old: POST /api/v1/users
New: POST /api/v2/users

Migration guide: https://docs.example.com/migration-v2
```

_Note: The `!` before the colon signals a breaking change._

## Best Practices

### 1. **Atomic Commits**

Each commit should represent one logical change. If you need an "and" in your subject, split it into multiple commits.

❌ `feat(auth): add login form and reset password flow`  
✅ `feat(auth): add login form` + `feat(auth): add password reset flow`

### 2. **Use Present Tense**

Commits describe actions, not history.

❌ `Fixed bug in cache invalidation`  
✅ `fix(cache): invalidate stale entries on mutation`

### 3. **Be Consistent**

Establish project conventions and document them in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. All team members should follow the same patterns.

### 4. **Don't Mix Types**

Keep commits focused. A single commit should not be both a feature and a refactor.

### 5. **Use Commit Linting**

Tools like `commitlint` can enforce these conventions automatically:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/config-conventional commitlint
```

`.commitlintrc.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
};
```

### 6. **Link to Issues**

Always reference the issue or ticket being addressed:

```
feat(billing): implement tiered pricing model

Closes #1234
```

## Tools & Integration

### Pre-commit Hook

Validate commits before they're created:

```bash
# .husky/commit-msg
npx commitlint --edit "$1"
```

### Commit Template (Git)

Set a commit message template to remind developers of the format:

`.git/hooks/commit-msg` or use `git config commit.template`:

```
# <type>(<scope>): <subject> (max 50 chars)
#
# <body> (wrapped at 72 chars)
#
# <footer>
#
# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
# Scopes: auth, api, ui, database, config, docs, ci
# Remember: Use imperative mood, no period at end
```

### Changelog Generation

Conventional commits enable automated changelog generation:

```bash
npm install --save-dev conventional-changelog-cli
npx conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s
```
