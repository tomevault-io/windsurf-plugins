## Core (packages/core)

- **Role**: Event-driven "kernel" containing domain logic, database access, and message processing. It must stay UI-agnostic and transport-agnostic.
- **Design rules**:
  - New domain behavior belongs here first, then is exposed to clients via events.
  - Separate **event handlers** from **services**:
    - Event handlers translate `ToCoreEvent` / `FromCoreEvent` into service calls.
    - Services encapsulate business logic, DB queries, and Telegram API access.

### Events & CoreContext

- Keep `CoreContext` the single point of coordination:
  - One instance per session in server mode or browser mode.
  - All cross-module collaboration flows through its event emitter and helpers.
- When introducing new events:
  - Add them to the typed `ToCoreEvent` / `FromCoreEvent` maps.
  - Wire them through:
    - `packages/core/src/event-handlers`
    - `packages/client` adapters and event handler maps
    - `@tg-search/server/types` for WS mode
  - Provide **clear names** in `<domain>:<action>` form.

### Database & Drizzle

- Use `initDrizzle` as the only entry point for DB initialization:
  - It must support both PostgreSQL and PGlite via the `DatabaseType` enum and `Config.database`.
  - Avoid leaking raw `pg` or PGlite APIs outside dedicated DB modules (`pg.ts`, `pglite*.ts`).
- For queries:
  - Prefer Drizzle ORM APIs for type safety and portability.
  - Reserve raw SQL for performance-critical paths and keep them well-documented.
- When adding migrations:
  - Update TypeScript schemas/models first.
  - Use `drizzle-kit` to generate SQL migrations and avoid manual edits except for surgical fixes.

### Message Resolvers & Pipelines

- Resolvers under `src/message-resolvers` must:
  - Treat messages as **streams**, not immutable global state.
  - Be **idempotent**: re-running on the same input should not corrupt data.
  - Rely on message IDs for ordering and deduplication.
- Expensive operations (embeddings, link resolution) should:
  - Cache results whenever reasonable.
  - Defer to background-like processing while exposing progress events to clients.

### Error Handling & Logging

- Use `ctx.withError(error, description)` for all unexpected failures inside core services and handlers.
- Emit errors as events suitable for user-facing handling:
  - Avoid leaking raw Telegram or DB internals into error payloads.
  - Prefer structured error codes + contextual fields.
- Use `@guiiai/logg` consistently:
  - Attach domain-specific fields (chat/message IDs, operation names) instead of dumping entire payloads.
