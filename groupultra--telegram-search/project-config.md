## Contribution & Refactor Guidelines

- **Prime rule**: Code is a liability, functionality is the asset. Any change must pay for its own complexity.

### 1. Before Large Changes (Refactors, New Infra, New Domains)

- Ask yourself, and write down in the PR description if possible:
  - **Where is the bottleneck?** Latency, throughput, DX, or maintainability? Be concrete.
  - **What is the simplest change that fixes it?** Prefer removal/cleanup over new systems.
  - **What is the data flow?** Sketch: entrypoint → adapters → core → DB/Telegram → back.
  - **What happens on failure?**
    - If step B fails, does step A need a rollback or can we tolerate partial state?
    - Is this best modeled as a saga / compensating action, or is “at-least-once” good enough?

### 2. Backend Mindset

- Avoid hidden in-memory state that couples requests:
  - Session-local state lives in `CoreContext` or explicit stores, never in random globals.
  - Cross-request state must go into the database or a well-defined cache layer.
- For multi-step workflows:
  - Make each step observable (events + logs) and ideally resumable.
  - Design states explicitly (`pending`, `running`, `failed`, `completed`) rather than boolean flags.

### 3. TypeScript Style

- Strict TS is non-negotiable:
  - Avoid `any` unless wrapping truly dynamic data, and confine it at the edge.
  - Prefer small, composable types over giant “god” interfaces.
- Functional style:
  - Prefer pure functions and small modules over classes unless there is a clear lifecycle to model.
  - Keep side effects at the boundary (adapters, services) and core logic pure where possible.

### 4. PR Hygiene

- Keep PRs focused:
  - One domain behavior or refactor per PR.
  - Mechanical renames and large formatting should be isolated from behavioral changes.
- Tests:
  - Add or update tests alongside behavior changes, especially for core and DB logic.
  - Do not rely solely on manual E2E verification for critical paths.
