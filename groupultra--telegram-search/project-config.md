## Cross-Layer Events & Protocol Design

- **Scope**: Any change that adds/renames/removes events flowing between:
  - Vue/Pinia (apps/web)
  - `packages/client`
  - `apps/server` WebSocket layer
  - `packages/core` event handlers & services

### 1. Before You Add or Change an Event

- Answer, in your head or in an RFC:
  - **Where is the bottleneck?** (UX latency? DB load? Telegram API limits?)
  - **What is the minimal new behavior?** (One sentence, domain language.)
  - **What is the data flow?** (Component → store → client adapter → WS/core → DB → back.)
  - **How does this handle failure?**
    - Core error?
    - Network loss?
    - Partial success (e.g. some messages processed)?

### 2. Event Naming & Payloads

- Naming:
  - Use `<domain>:<action>` or `<domain>:<action>:<subaction>`.
  - Avoid generic verbs like `update`, `done`; always include the domain (`message`, `storage`, `auth`, etc.).
- Payloads:
  - Prefer **IDs + small shapes** over dumping full DB rows or Telegram objects.
  - Do not leak raw internal schemas as event payloads unless they are explicitly part of the public model.
  - Include enough context to render the UI without requiring a second roundtrip when reasonable.

### 3. End-to-End Wiring Checklist

When adding a new event, ensure all of the following are updated **in one change**:

- **Types & contracts**:
  - `@tg-search/core` `ToCoreEvent` / `FromCoreEvent`.
  - `@tg-search/server/types` WS mappings (`WsEventToServer`, `WsEventToClient`).
  - Client event handler maps in `packages/client`.
- **Handlers**:
  - Core event handler under `packages/core/src/event-handlers`.
  - Service function(s) in `packages/core/src/services`.
  - Client-side handler that maps `FromCoreEvent` into Pinia state.
- **UI**:
  - Minimal component/store changes to actually use the new event.

### 4. Backwards Compatibility & Refactors

- Prefer **adding** new events over changing semantics of existing ones.
- If an event must change:
  - Keep the old event name working for at least one release where possible.
  - Introduce a new event name for the new behavior and migrate callers gradually.
- For refactors across layers (e.g. renaming a domain or action):
  - Do a **mechanical rename** across types, handlers, and callers in one PR.
  - Avoid long-lived “mixed” states where some code uses old names and some uses new ones.

### 5. Errors, Timeouts & Idempotency

- Treat every event as potentially:
  - Lost (network issues).
  - Duplicated (retries).
  - Delayed (backpressure).
- Design handlers to be **idempotent** where possible:
  - Re-applying the same event should not corrupt state.
  - Use message IDs and versioning to detect duplicates.
- Error semantics:
  - Core should emit structured error events with codes and key context, not just strings.
  - Client should surface user-friendly messages and, where safe, allow retry.
