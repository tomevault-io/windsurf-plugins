## PGlite Inspector (Devtool)

- **Role**: Developer-only tooling to inspect and debug the in-browser PGlite database.
- Must **not** become a production dependency for core features.

### API & Integration

- Keep the public surface minimal:
  - Primary entry point is `setupPGliteDevtools({ app, db })`.
  - Avoid exposing low-level PGlite internals; the caller should only need a `PGlite` instance and a Vue `App`.
- Callers (e.g. `apps/web/src/main.ts`) must guard usage with `import.meta.env.DEV` and handle the case where `db` is unavailable.

### Behavior & UX

- Present a clear, read-only view of:
  - Table list and basic metadata.
  - Columns and types.
  - Sample data (capped to a safe limit).
- Timeline events (queries) should:
  - Be lightweight to emit.
  - Not significantly slow down query execution even in debug mode.

### Reliability & Safety

- On any error (failed query, inspector read failure):
  - Fail gracefully with a visible error state in devtools.
  - Avoid crashing the host app.
- Logging:
  - Use `console.error` sparingly for truly unexpected failures in dev builds only.
  - Do not spam the console on every normal query.
