# Taskmaster Development Workflow

This guide outlines the standard process for using Taskmaster to manage software development projects. It is written as a set of instructions for you, the AI agent.

- **Your Default Stance**: For most projects, the user can work directly within the `master` task context. Your initial actions should operate on this default context unless a clear pattern for multi-context work emerges.
- **Your Goal**: Your role is to elevate the user's workflow by intelligently introducing advanced features like **Tagged Task Lists** when you detect the appropriate context. Do not force tags on the user; suggest them as a helpful solution to a specific need.

## The Basic Loop
The fundamental development cycle you will facilitate is:
1.  **`list`**: Show the user what needs to be done.
2.  **`next`**: Help the user decide what to work on.
3.  **`show <id>`**: Provide details for a specific task.
4.  **`expand <id>`**: Break down a complex task into smaller, manageable subtasks.
5.  **Implement**: The user writes the code and tests.
6.  **`update-subtask`**: Log progress and findings on behalf of the user.
7.  **`set-status`**: Mark tasks and subtasks as `done` as work is completed.
8.  **Repeat**.

All your standard command executions should operate on the user's current task context, which defaults to `master`.

## Standard Development Workflow Process

### Simple Workflow (Default Starting Point)

For new projects or when users are getting started, operate within the `master` tag context:

-   Start new projects by running `initialize_project` tool / `task-master init` or `parse_prd` / `task-master parse-prd --input='<prd-file.txt>'` (see [`taskmaster.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc)) to generate initial tasks.json with tagged structure
-   Begin coding sessions with `get_tasks` / `task-master list` (see [`taskmaster.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc)) to see current tasks, status, and IDs
-   Determine the next task to work on using `next_task` / `task-master next` (see [`taskmaster.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc))
-   Analyze task complexity with `analyze_project_complexity` / `task-master analyze-complexity --research` (see [`taskmaster.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc)) before breaking down tasks
-   Review complexity report using `complexity_report` / `task-master complexity-report` (see [`taskmaster.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc))
-   Select tasks based on dependencies (all marked 'done'), priority level, and ID order
-   View specific task details using `get_task` / `task-master show <id>` (see [`taskmaster.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc)) to understand implementation requirements
-   Break down complex tasks using `expand_task` / `task-master expand --id=<id> --force --research` (see [`taskmaster.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc)) with appropriate flags like `--force` (to replace existing subtasks) and `--research`
-   Implement code following task details, dependencies, and project standards
-   Mark completed tasks with `set_task_status` / `task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done` (see [`taskmaster.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc))
-   Update dependent tasks when implementation differs from original plan using `update` / `task-master update --from=<id> --prompt="..."` or `update_task` / `task-master update-task --id=<id> --prompt="..."` (see [`taskmaster.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc))

## Leveling Up: Agent-Led Multi-Context Workflows

While the basic workflow is powerful, your primary opportunity to add value is by identifying when to introduce **Tagged Task Lists**. These patterns are your tools for creating a more organized and efficient development environment for the user, especially if you detect agentic or parallel development happening across the same session.

**Critical Principle**: Most users should never see a difference in their experience. Only introduce advanced workflows when you detect clear indicators that the project has evolved beyond simple task management.

### When to Introduce Tags: Your Decision Patterns

Here are the patterns to look for. When you detect one, you should propose the corresponding workflow to the user.

#### Pattern 1: Simple Git Feature Branching
This is the most common and direct use case for tags.

- **Trigger**: The user creates a new git branch (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/user-auth`).
- **Your Action**: Propose creating a new tag that mirrors the branch name to isolate the feature's tasks from `master`.
- **Your Suggested Prompt**: *"I see you've created a new branch named 'feature/user-auth'. To keep all related tasks neatly organized and separate from your main list, I can create a corresponding task tag for you. This helps prevent merge conflicts in your `tasks.json` file later. Shall I create the 'feature-user-auth' tag?"*
- **Tool to Use**: `task-master add-tag --from-branch`

#### Pattern 2: Team Collaboration
- **Trigger**: The user mentions working with teammates (e.g., "My teammate Alice is handling the database schema," or "I need to review Bob's work on the API.").
- **Your Action**: Suggest creating a separate tag for the user's work to prevent conflicts with shared master context.
