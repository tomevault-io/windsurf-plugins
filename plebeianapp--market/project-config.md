You are an expert in React, TanStack ecosystem, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Nostr protocol, and TypeScript.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate React examples.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Follow functional programming patterns and declarative code style.
- Prioritize type safety and use TypeScript extensively.

Error Handling and Validation
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions using guard clauses.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Always throw user-friendly errors that TanStack Query can catch and display.
- Use Zod schemas for runtime validation and type inference.
- Implement proper error logging with descriptive messages.

React & Components
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Use declarative JSX with proper component composition.
- Place static content, interfaces, and schemas at file end.
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
- Wrap async components in Suspense with meaningful fallback UI.
- Prefer composition over inheritance for component design.

State Management (TanStack Store)
- Use TanStack Store for client-side global state.
- Create separate stores for different domains (auth, cart, product, ndk).
- Define clear state interfaces and initial state objects.
- Export both store and actions from store files.
- Use descriptive action names that indicate intent.
- Always handle state immutability when updating store state.

Data Fetching (TanStack Query)
- Use TanStack Query for all server/Nostr data fetching.
- Create query key factories in `src/queries/queryKeyFactory.ts`.
- Organize queries by domain in separate files under `src/queries/`.
- Use `queryOptions` for reusable query configurations.
- Implement proper error handling in query functions.
- Use optimistic updates for better UX where appropriate.

Forms (TanStack Form)
- Use TanStack Form with Zod resolvers for validation.
- Define form schemas using Zod for type safety and validation.
- Handle form submission errors gracefully with user feedback.
- Use field-level validation for real-time feedback.
- Extract complex form logic into custom hooks.

Routing (TanStack Router)
- Use TanStack Router with type-safe route definitions.
- Define routes in the `src/routes/` directory following file-based routing.
- Use route loaders for data dependencies.
- Implement proper loading and error states for routes.
- Use search params and path params with proper TypeScript typing.

Nostr Integration
- Use NDK (Nostr Development Kit) for all Nostr operations.
- Initialize NDK through the store pattern in `src/lib/stores/ndk.ts`.
- Use proper NDK event filtering and caching strategies.
- Handle relay connections and failures gracefully.
- Implement authentication using NDK signers (NIP-07, NIP-46, private key).
- Use proper event validation with Zod schemas.

UI & Styling (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS)
- Use Radix UI components as the foundation for all interactive elements.
- Build custom components by composing Radix primitives in `src/components/ui/`.
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling with the custom design system.
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind's responsive utilities.
- Use CSS variables defined in `styles/globals.css` for theming.
- Utilize `class-variance-authority` for component variants.
- Use `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for conditional styling.
- Follow the established color palette (primary, secondary, tertiary, focus).

File Organization
- Place components in `src/components/` with domain-specific subdirectories.
- Keep UI primitives in `src/components/ui/`.
- Store business logic in `src/lib/` with clear separation of concerns.
- Use `src/queries/` for all data fetching logic.
- Place TypeScript types and schemas in `src/lib/schemas/`.
- Keep utility functions in `src/lib/utils/`.

TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict TypeScript configuration with proper type inference.
- Define interfaces for all component props and state shapes.
- Use Zod for runtime type validation and `z.infer` for type extraction.
- Avoid `any` types; use proper type definitions or `unknown`.
- Use discriminated unions for complex state or action types.
- Implement proper generic constraints where needed.

Performance & Optimization
- Use React 19's concurrent features appropriately.
- Implement proper memoization with `useMemo` and `useCallback` when needed.
- Use TanStack Query's caching strategies effectively.
- Optimize bundle size by using dynamic imports for large components.
- Implement proper error boundaries for component isolation.

Authentication & Security
- Use Nostr-based authentication with proper key management.
- Store sensitive data (private keys) securely using encryption.
- Implement proper session management with localStorage/sessionStorage.
- Validate all user inputs and API responses with Zod schemas.
- Handle authentication states properly throughout the application.

Testing Considerations
- Write testable code with clear separation of concerns.
- Use dependency injection patterns for easier testing.
- Mock external dependencies (Nostr relays, NDK) in tests.
