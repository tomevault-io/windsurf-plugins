# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common commands

Dependency management uses **uv** (not pip). Frontend uses **npm**.

```bash
# Install deps
uv sync                         # core (torch, transformers, opencv, PIL)
uv sync --extra api             # + fastapi/uvicorn for Web UI
uv sync --extra dev             # + pytest

# CLI (entry point declared in pyproject.toml → opennomark.cli:main)
uv run opennomark <files|dirs|globs> -o output/ [--debug] [--device cpu|cuda|mps]

# API server (singleton pipeline loaded on first request)
uv run uvicorn opennomark.api:app --port 48291

# Frontend (React 19 + Vite 8 + Tailwind 4)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev      # dev server on :48292
cd frontend && npm run build                   # builds to frontend/dist (auto-served by api.py if present)
cd frontend && npm run lint

# Tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v
uv run pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -v                     # single file
uv run pytest tests/test_pipeline.py::test_name -v          # single test

# One-shot start (installs deps, runs backend + frontend)
./start.sh        # macOS/Linux
start.bat         # Windows
```

Tests referencing real sample images in `gemini_images/` and `豆包/` auto-skip via `pytest.skip` when those directories are absent — see `tests/conftest.py:45-61`.

## Architecture

### Fused visual-expert pipeline (`opennomark/localizer.py`)

```
image ──┬─► Gemini catalog detector (48/32, 96/64, 96/192)
        ├─► OWLv2 corner prompts ─┐
        ├─► OWLv2 generic prompts├─► conservative cross-expert fusion
        └─► lazy PP-OCRv5 polygons┘              │
                                                 ▼
                                    precise mask(s) → local LaMa
                                                 │
                                                 ▼
                                          residual check
```

The precise Gemini shape mask remains the default when experts overlap. A
non-overlapping calibrated corner signature can replace a weak spatial match
only when it is in the same corner, scores at least as strongly, and lies
closer to the edges. Separately confirmed generic regions can coexist so one
image may contain multiple removal targets.

### Gemini branch (`opennomark/gemini_alpha.py`)

- **Resolution tiers first**: large official outputs try 96/192 and 96/64; preview/1K outputs try 48/32 and legacy 96/64.
- **Two-signal scoring**: spatial NCC and Sobel-edge NCC must both clear the thresholds in `opennomark/assets/gemini_detector.json`.
- **Tight shape mask**: `create_gemini_mask` thresholds the known alpha silhouette, dilates it by 5px, and feathers by 2px. Do not replace it with a full rectangle without re-validating the real corpus.
- The older reverse-alpha helpers remain experimental. Production uses the shape mask with local LaMa because reverse alpha can leave positive/negative diamond residuals on complex backgrounds.

### Open-vocabulary, OCR, and LaMa

**Detector (`opennomark/detector.py`)**: OWLv2 runs established corner prompts and generic watermark prompts in separate passes. Keep the query competition separate: mixing new phrases into the calibrated platform pass regresses the real corpus. `filter_watermarks` uses a `corner_signature` lane plus a stricter `generic_anywhere` lane, permits at most four regions, and blocks automatic removal when candidate count or area budgets overflow.

**Text detector (`opennomark/text_detector.py`)**: PP-OCRv5 mobile detection and recognition are loaded lazily. Strong watermark vocabulary can be accepted anywhere; URLs, handles, and dates require edge placement. OCR polygons refine generic OWLv2 rectangles. Never convert arbitrary recognized scene text into a removal mask, and keep dense/tiled candidates fail-closed.

**Inpainter (`opennomark/inpainter.py`)**: wraps a TorchScript LaMa model.
- **Tight mask defaults (`padding=3, feather=4`) are load-bearing** — see the docstring at line 28. Larger values cause LaMa to bleed across high-contrast structural edges (e.g. paint white fabric over a black panel adjacent to a sparkle). Do not relax these without re-validating on the `examples/` set.
- The model is downloaded on first run from `github.com/enesmsahin/simple-lama-inpainting/releases` to `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/big-lama.pt`.
- Loaded with `map_location="cpu"` because the serialized checkpoint is CUDA — this is what lets it run on Mac.
- After LaMa produces a result, `inpaint()` alpha-blends it back against the original using the feathered mask, so only the masked pixels are modified.

### Device selection

Both models accept a `device` kwarg (passed through from the `--device` CLI flag) and auto-select when not given, but they select **differently**:

- `WatermarkDetector` (OWLv2): MPS → CUDA → CPU.
- `LamaInpainter`: CUDA → CPU. **MPS requests are silently rewritten to CPU** because LaMa's TorchScript graph uses ops (e.g. FFT variants) that Apple MPS does not support — trying to run on MPS produces garbage, not an error. Do not "fix" this redirect without first confirming the full LaMa op set is MPS-supported.
