# HAL Project Guidelines

## About the project

The goal of this project is to train Transformer models on Super Smash Bros. Melee using imitation learning & RL.

The offline data pipeline (`.slp` → MDS shards) lives in `hal/data/` and is driven by the CLI stages under `hal/scripts/`.
The closed-loop driver (Dolphin + libmelee) lives in `hal/sim/`: `Session` owns the emulator process, `ControllerSource` implementations produce per-port inputs, and `drive()` runs the step loop that powers round-trip validation, online eval vs CPU, self-play, and RL rollouts.
Cross-layer wire conventions (button bits, mask sentinels, raw↔wire math, port and stage/character bridges, post-frame field naming) are the single source of truth in `hal/wire.py`.
Project policy (included characters/stages, player port conventions) lives in `hal/policy.py`.
Integration fixtures (dev archive, MDS bundle, ISO, Dolphin) are declared in `hal/fixtures.py` and fetched into `<repo>/fixtures/` via `python -m hal.scripts.fetch`; see `README.md`.

## Principles

**Posture**
- Be concise. Don't be lazy — fix smells you encounter en-route; >30min, leave a TODO and flag.
- Delete liberally. Code is tech debt — rewrites are cheap, better abstractions compound. Versioning is git's job: no `*_v0.py`, `stage1_*`, `*_old.py`.
- Invalid states should be impossible to represent. Fail loud, fail early — no fallback values that silently change behavior or configuration.
- Don't re-implement library helpers (libmelee, peppi-py, streaming, torch). Local copies drift and turn upstream upgrades into silent behavior changes. If the upstream genuinely doesn't fit, write the smallest primitive that fills the gap and reuse the library for everything else. Fork-dep fixes (libmelee, peppi-py) go upstream, not into a local translation layer.
- Don't reference our conversations or "existing convention from elsewhere in the repo" in code comments.
- Follow the 3-tier codebase layout for organizing shared infra: https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/research_code/

**Architecture**
- One source of truth per cross-cutting vocabulary. `wire.py` owns slp/wire conventions (button bits, ports, mask sentinels); `policy.py` owns included character/stage tuples. No second source.
- Schema is versioned; consumers fail loud on mismatch. Extend `SCHEMA_VERSION` discipline to any future shared artifact (action tokenizer, observation builder).
- Round-trip diff is the contract. No PR touching `extract`, `wire`, `sim/inputs`, or `sim/session` lands without a green `python -m hal.scripts.roundtrip` on the dev MDS.
- Value objects: frozen dataclasses. Behavior surfaces: Protocols. Transforms: free functions. Composition over inheritance and over generators (a `Source` Protocol + explicit step loop beats a yielding generator that receives inputs). Classes only own genuine resources (`Session` owns a Dolphin process).
- Policies are pure `obs → action`. The model never touches libmelee; the simulator never touches torch. Glue lives in the eval driver.
- Hot path is zero-allocation. No per-frame `dict()`, `torch.tensor(...)`, or Python loop over button names. Pre-resolve at import time (see `_BUTTON_DISPATCH` in `sim/inputs.py`).

**Organization**
- `hal/__init__.py` is a curated public API facade. Explicit re-exports with `__all__`; no side-effecting imports; no `import *`.
- No utility grab-bags. `utils.py`, `helpers.py`, `common.py` are forbidden. Name files by what they own.
- CLIs are ≤80 lines of `tyro` glue. The work is in importable functions in the library.

## Code Style

- **Formatting**: ruff with `line_length=119`, isort.
- **Types**: Type annotations everywhere; return types required. Types over primitives — encode domain semantics and invariants in the type system. Prefer static over dynamic checks. py3.14; do not use `from __future__ import annotations`.
- **Imports**: Group order: stdlib, third-party, first-party (hal). Single-line imports.
- **Naming**: idiomatic Python.
    - Shortest unambiguous name in context — the same value can take different names in different functions. `def clean_company_name(name: str)` beats `def clean_company_name(company_name: str)`. When you do need specificity, keep going: `noun_adj_adj_other_modifiers` is fine.
    - Capitalize acronyms in CamelCase (`MDSWriter`, not `MdsWriter`).
    - Order args intuitively. Prefer explicit kwargs at call sites when ordering or types aren't obvious. Use lone `*` to force keyword-only.
- **Control flow**: keep the happy path at the lowest indentation level.
- **Error handling**: descriptive messages; `contextmanager` for resources.
    - Never swallow exceptions (lone `pass`); never use bare `except`.
    - Don't catch just to log and rethrow — only wrap if this layer can add helpful context.
    - Always name the exception classes caught, ideally with specific clauses. Avoid `except Exception` unless this is a crucial runtime path that must never crash.

## Suggested libraries
- `loguru` for logging
- MosaicML `streaming` + MDS format for datasets: https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/streaming/en/stable/index.html
- `libmelee` for the Dolphin lifecycle, Enet/spectator protocol, blocking controller injection
