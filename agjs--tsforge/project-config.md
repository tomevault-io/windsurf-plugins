# tsforge monorepo

Single repository: `packages/core` (harness), `apps/docs` (Starlight site).

## Maintainer commands (repo root)

```bash
bun run validate                              # merge gate — run before every push
bun test packages                             # full test suite (680+ tests)
tsforge                                       # run harness (after install or bun link)
bun run tsforge                               # run harness from monorepo checkout
bun run rules:build                           # regenerate RULES.md
bun run rules:docs                            # regenerate rule-docs.generated.json
bun run eval:sweep                            # A/B feature sweep (see tsforge.dev/eval/ab-testing/)
bun run eval:benchmark                        # compare edit mechanisms across runs
./scripts/audit-repo-settings.sh             # diff GitHub repo settings vs .github/desired-repo-settings.json
./scripts/release.sh patch                   # bump, tag, push → npm + GitHub Release (see .cursor/skills/tsforge-release/)
```

## Layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core/src/stack-detection/` | detect stack, enable rule packs |
| `packages/core/src/rule-packs/` | ESLint rule pack implementations (13 packs) |
| `packages/core/src/meta-rules/` | non-AST gate rules (config, CI, supply chain) |
| `packages/core/src/config/` | runtime flags, tsforge.config.json loader |
| `packages/core/src/files/` | edit, create, hashline |
| `packages/core/src/inference/` | model adapter, stream guard |
| `packages/core/src/loop/` | implement loop, TTSR, validation |
| `packages/core/src/lsp/` | LSP tools + write feedback |
| `packages/core/src/agent/` | ModelAgent, tool-call repair ladder |
| `packages/core/scripts/` | eval, sweep, doc generators |
| `packages/core/src/validate/` | gate runner, error parsers |
| `apps/docs/` | Astro Starlight docs site |

CI: run `bun run validate` locally; no remote CI wired yet.

## House rules

- No `as` type assertions — narrow with guards
- No `eslint-disable` — fix the root cause
- Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 20
- Interfaces prefixed `I`; types live in `*.types.ts`
- No new logic file without a behavioral test sibling
