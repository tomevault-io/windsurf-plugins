# Cold Start Prevention: Query Project Memories First

**CRITICAL**: Before starting ANY coding task, you MUST query the project's memory system to prevent cold start and avoid repeating past work.

## Step 1: Check for Existing Summaries (NEW!)

The project now maintains **hierarchical summaries** that provide immediate context:

```python
# Query project-level summaries first
project_summaries = search_long_term_memory(
    text="project summary architecture decisions",
    topics=["project-summary"],
    namespace="default:git-github-com-AI-Provenance-ai-dev-memory-git",
    limit=3
)

# Query architecture evolution summaries
architecture_summaries = search_long_term_memory(
    text="architecture evolution design patterns",
    topics=["architecture-summary"],
    namespace="default:git-github-com-AI-Provenance-ai-dev-memory-git",
    limit=3
)
```

**If summaries exist**, read them FIRST. They contain:
- High-level architecture overview
- Key design decisions and rationale
- Evolution timeline and lessons learned
- Current technical debt and known issues
- Emerging patterns and conventions

## Step 2: Query Commit-Level Memories

```python
# Search for relevant commit memories
commit_memories = search_long_term_memory(
    text="<describe your task in 1-2 sentences>",
    namespace="default:git-github-com-AI-Provenance-ai-dev-memory-git",
    limit=5
)
```

## Step 3: Query Knowledge Files

```python
# Check if knowledge files exist
knowledge_files = search_long_term_memory(
    text="knowledge files architecture gotchas",
    topics=["knowledge"],
    namespace="default:git-github-com-AI-Provenance-ai-dev-memory-git",
    limit=10
)
```

## Step 4: Check Active Coordination

```python
# Check if other agents are working on related tasks
coordination = get_working_memory(session_id="project-coordination")
```

## What to Look For

✅ **Architecture Decisions**: Why was approach A chosen over B?
✅ **Known Gotchas**: What breaks easily in this area?
✅ **Past Attempts**: Has someone already tried and failed at this?
✅ **API Quirks**: Are there non-obvious behaviors to watch for?
✅ **Dependencies**: Are there version constraints or compatibility issues?
✅ **Performance**: Are there known bottlenecks or scaling limits?
✅ **Security**: Are there established patterns for auth/validation?

## Cold Start Checklist

Before writing any code, answer these questions:

1. **Context**: What's the current state of this component/module?
2. **History**: How has this area evolved? What changed recently?
3. **Decisions**: What architectural choices affect my work?
4. **Gotchas**: What common pitfalls should I avoid?
5. **Patterns**: What conventions should I follow?
6. **Coordination**: Is anyone else working on this?

## Memory Query Patterns

### For New Features:
```python
search_long_term_memory(
    text="how to add <feature type> to this project",
    topics=["architecture", "patterns"],
    namespace="default:git-github-com-AI-Provenance-ai-dev-memory-git"
)
```

### For Bug Fixes:
```python
search_long_term_memory(
    text="<error message> root cause and fix",
    topics=["bugfix", "gotchas"],
    namespace="default:git-github-com-AI-Provenance-ai-dev-memory-git"
)
```

### For Refactoring:
```python
search_long_term_memory(
    text="<module> redesign decisions and tradeoffs",
    topics=["refactoring", "architecture"],
    namespace="default:git-github-com-AI-Provenance-ai-dev-memory-git"
)
```

### For API Changes:
```python
search_long_term_memory(
    text="<API name> usage patterns and limitations",
    topics=["api", "integration"],
    namespace="default:git-github-com-AI-Provenance-ai-dev-memory-git"
)
```

## Memory Types Reference

| Type | When to Query | Example Topics |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| `project-summary` | Start of session, new feature | architecture, evolution, decisions |
| `architecture-summary` | Design work, refactoring | design, patterns, components |
| `semantic` | General knowledge, decisions | conventions, gotchas, rationale |
| `episodic` | Specific events, changes | migrations, incidents, changes |

## Performance Optimization

For large projects, use targeted queries:

```python
# Filter by time (last 30 days)
recent_memories = search_long_term_memory(
    text="<your task>",
    namespace="default:git-github-com-AI-Provenance-ai-dev-memory-git",
    created_at={"gte": "30 days ago"}
)

# Filter by specific technologies
tech_memories = search_long_term_memory(
    text="<your task>",
    entities=["FastAPI", "Redis"],
    namespace="default:git-github-com-AI-Provenance-ai-dev-memory-git"
)
```

## Remember: You're Not Alone

Every query you make helps future sessions. Every memory you create helps the next developer. This is a **shared knowledge system** — use it actively to:
- Avoid repeating past mistakes
- Build on established patterns
- Maintain architectural consistency
- Reduce onboarding time for new agents

**Cold start is optional. Use the memories.**
