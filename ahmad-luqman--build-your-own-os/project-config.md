### Current High Priority Issues

When starting work, check these first:
1. **Bug Issues** - Always fix bugs before adding features
2. **High Priority Features** - Critical functionality needed
3. **Test Failures** - Keep tests passing

Use: `gh issue list --label "bug" --state open` or `./project_dashboard.sh`

### Development Workflow

1. **Starting Work on an Issue:**
   ```bash
   # Pick an issue
   gh issue list --label "bug" --state open

   # Assign to yourself
   gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me

   # Add in-progress label
   gh issue edit <number> --add-label "in-progress"

   # Create a branch (optional)
   git checkout -b issue-<number>-description
   ```

2. **During Development:**
   ```bash
   # Comment on progress
   gh issue comment <number> --body "Working on fix, found that..."

   # Link commits by mentioning issue
   git commit -m "Fix: Description (#<number>)"
   ```

3. **Completing an Issue:**
   ```bash
   # Close with comment
   gh issue close <number> --comment "Fixed in commit <hash>"

   # Or close via commit message
   git commit -m "Fixes #<number>: Description"
   ```

### Project Scripts

make

# Build for x86-64
make ARCH=x86_64

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Build and test in VM
make test

# Build debug version with symbols and logging
make DEBUG=1

# Display build information
make info

# Quick build and test
make quick-test
```

# Debug session
make debug                  # Start debug session
```

## Architecture

### Cross-Platform Support
- **Primary Target**: ARM64 (AArch64) for UTM Virtual Machine on macOS
- **Secondary Target**: x86-64 for broader compatibility via QEMU
- **Build System**: Uses GNU Make with architecture-specific configuration files in `tools/build/arch-*.mk`

### Key Architectural Patterns
1. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Clean separation between architecture-specific and independent code
2. **Microkernel-inspired design**: Minimal kernel with modular components
3. **Phase-based development**: Each phase builds upon previous functionality

### Source Code Structure
```
src/
├── arch/                 # Architecture-specific code (arm64/, x86_64/)
├── boot/                 # Bootloader implementations
├── kernel/               # Core kernel functionality
├── drivers/              # Device drivers (uart/, timer/, interrupt/)
├── fs/                   # File system implementations (vfs/, sfs/, block/, ramfs/)
├── shell/                # Shell implementation (core/, commands/, parser/, advanced/)
└── userland/             # User space applications and libraries
```

## Current Implementation Status

**Phase 6 In Progress (75% Complete) - Shell and User Interface**

- ✅ Phase 2: Bootloader Implementation - UEFI (ARM64) and Multiboot2 (x86-64)
- ✅ Phase 3: Memory Management - MMU/Paging with virtual memory
- ✅ Phase 4: System Services - Device drivers, processes, interrupts, syscalls
- ✅ Phase 5: File System - VFS layer, SFS with 100% RAMFS feature parity, persistence
- 🔄 Phase 6: Shell (75%) - Interactive CLI, tab completion, pipes, I/O redirection, 25+ commands
- ⏳ Phase 7: Polish & Documentation

### Recent Achievements (October 2025)
- ✅ **Memory Management Audit** (Issue #12) - Leak detection, cache management, meminfo command
- ✅ **Pipe Execution** (Issue #16) - Full pipe support with `|` operator
- ✅ **Tab Completion** (Issue #1) - Fixed cursor positioning bug
- ✅ **SFS File Operations** (Issues #4-#10, #15) - 100% feature parity with RAMFS
  - File creation, read, write, delete, rename/move, copy
  - Directory creation (nested), list, delete
  - Data persistence across unmount/remount

## Development Workflow

### Cross-Compilation Setup
The build system automatically selects appropriate toolchains:
- **ARM64**: `aarch64-elf-gcc`, `aarch64-elf-ld`, `aarch64-elf-as`
- **x86-64**: `x86_64-elf-gcc`, `x86_64-elf-ld`, `nasm`

### Build Process
1. Architecture detection and toolchain selection
2. Source file compilation with architecture-specific flags
3. Linking using architecture-specific linker scripts
4. Bootloader build and image creation
5. VM testing and debugging

### Key Files to Understand
- `Makefile`: Main build configuration
- `src/kernel/kernel.h`: Core kernel structures and interfaces
- `src/include/`: Central header definitions
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Detailed system architecture
- `docs/BUILD.md`: Build system documentation

## Important Implementation Details

### Memory Management
- Virtual memory with 4KB pages
- 4-level page tables on both architectures
- User/kernel space separation
- ARM64: 256TB address spaces, x86-64: 128TB address spaces

### System Call Interface
- ARM64: `svc #0` instruction, arguments in x0-x5, return in x0
- x86-64: `syscall` instruction, arguments in rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9, return in rax

### File System
- VFS abstraction layer supporting multiple file systems
- SFS (Simple File System) implementation
- Block device abstraction for storage
- **IMPORTANT**: RAMFS is mounted at `/` (root), not `/ramfs`

### Process Management
- Round-robin scheduling with priority levels
- Preemptive multitasking via timer interrupts
- Process structures with virtual memory spaces

## Open Issues (Check GitHub for latest)

### Current Open Issues
- #14: Integration Tests (medium priority)
- #13: SFS Unit Test Suite (medium priority)
- #11: Comprehensive Error Checking (medium priority)
- #8: SFS Directory Listing - ls -l metadata (low priority, basic ls works)
- #3: Enhanced Error Messages (medium priority)

### Working Features (All Verified)
- ✅ File operations: touch, cat, echo > file, ls, pwd, cd, rm, cp, mv
- ✅ Tab completion with correct cursor positioning
- ✅ Pipe execution: `command1 | command2`
- ✅ I/O redirection: `command < input` and `command > output`
- ✅ Directory operations on both RAMFS and SFS
- ✅ SFS persistence across unmount/remount cycles
- ✅ Memory management audit with meminfo command
- ✅ Command history with arrow key navigation

## Debugging and Development Tips

### Debug Builds
Use `make DEBUG=1` for:
- Debug symbols (-g)
- No optimization (-O0)
- Debug logging enabled (-DDEBUG)
- Log level set to DEBUG (0)

### VM Testing
- ARM64: Uses UTM-compatible disk images (.img)
- x86-64: Uses ISO images (.iso)
- Default timeout: 30 seconds for automated testing

### Common Development Tasks
- When adding new kernel features: Update appropriate files in `src/kernel/`
- Architecture-specific changes: Modify files in `src/arch/<arch>/`
- New device drivers: Add to `src/drivers/` with appropriate abstractions
- User applications: Add to `src/userland/` and update Makefile targets

## Code Contribution Guidelines

### Commit Message Standards
- **DO NOT** add any Claude Code attribution or signatures in commit messages
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format
- Reference issues: `Fixes #<number>` or `Related to #<number>`
- Focus on what was changed and why, not who made the change
- Examples of good commit messages:
  - "Fix: Tab completion cursor position for unique matches (#1)"
  - "Feature: Add SFS file write support (#5)"
  - "Test: Update smoke test for correct RAMFS mount path (#2)"

### Development Principles
- Prioritize system stability and avoid breaking existing functionality
- Use test-driven development approach when implementing new features
- Test on both ARM64 and x86-64 architectures when applicable
- Maintain clean, readable code with proper documentation
- Always check high-priority bugs before adding new features

### Before Starting Work
1. Run `./project_dashboard.sh` to see current priorities
2. Check for assigned issues: `gh issue list --assignee @me`
3. Look for bugs first: `gh issue list --label "bug" --state open`
4. Ensure tests pass: `make test`
