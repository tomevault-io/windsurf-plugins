# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
`src/clio_agent/` contains production code, organized by responsibility:
- `gact/` for the GACT server — the shipped API surface gact-tui talks to (FastAPI app, turn orchestration, SSE streaming, sessions/messages, `routes/`, `agents/`, `runtime/`, `workflow_state/`, `providers/`)
- `agent.py`, `harness.py`, `errors.py` for the Tier-1 planner loop and run tracing
- `conf.py`, `config.py`, `paths.py`, `prompts.py` for runtime/LM configuration, canonical paths, and the editable prompt system
- `experts/`, `registry/`, `signatures/` for generic expert support, the agent registry, and DSPy signatures
- `prompt_packs/` for built-in prompt packs
- `arc/` for ARC memory: live context plane, prompt recorder, context compiler, cache/index/LSM/storage/retrieval
- `tools/` for the FastMCP gateway, tool catalog, file policy, and execution boundary; `tools/servers/` for the FS and shell MCP servers
- `providers/` for provider auth and LiteLLM bridges (Argonne/ALCF, claude_code, codex) plus `handshake/` model-limit discovery
- `optimizer/` for tuning and instrumentation workflows
- `runtime/` for doctor/status, hooks, LM activity/stream audit, the nanoagent spawn primitive, and the **sandbox** (write-confinement ladder `sandbox.py`, `sandbox_roots.py`, srt/Landlock/Windows adapters, `net_chokepoint.py`, and the `sandbox_conformance.py` sweep — campaign #974)
- `ui/` for the legacy CLI and REST API entry points (gact is the product surface)

The OS write fence (`runtime/sandbox.py`) confines every agent-spawned child to its
territory; `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` and `docs/design/sandboxing-campaign-2026-07.md` cover the
backend ladder, grants, network chokepoint, and the provenance-tier upgrades. `clio sandbox
setup` provisions the Windows fence (one-time UAC).

Tests mirror the runtime layout in `tests/` (`test_core/`, `test_arc/`, `test_tools/`, `test_gact/`, `test_integration/`, ...). Architecture and design docs live in `docs/` (historical material in `docs/archive/`), and reference material is in `ai-docs/`.
Helper scripts for local demos and homelab setup live in `scripts/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use `uv` for environment and command execution:
- `uv sync --extra dev --extra optimizers` installs contributor dependencies.
- `uv run ruff check src/ tests/ scripts/create_demo_data.py` runs lint checks.
- `uv run ruff format src/ tests/ scripts/create_demo_data.py` formats code.
- `uv run pytest tests/ -m "not integration"` runs the test suite. Coverage is not on by default; CI adds the flags explicitly (see Testing Guidelines).
- `uv run src/clio_agent/ui/cli.py doctor` reports runtime truth for LM, tools, file policy, API, and `clio-core`.
- `uv run src/clio_agent/ui/cli.py` starts the interactive CLI.
- `uv run clio-agent serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8100` starts the unified GACT server (the `/v1` REST/SSE API, health at `/v1/health`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Target Python 3.12 with 4-space indentation and type hints on public interfaces. Keep lines readable within the configured `line-length = 100`. Follow existing naming:
- modules/functions: `snake_case`
- classes: `PascalCase`
- constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

Ruff is the authoritative linter/formatter (`ruff`, `ruff-format` in pre-commit). Run lint/format before opening a PR.

## Testing Guidelines
Pytest is the test framework (`test_*.py`, `Test*`, `test_*`). Coverage is **not** enabled by default: `pyproject.toml` keeps `addopts = []` so local runs stay lean (#773). CI passes the coverage flags explicitly (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `--cov=clio_agent --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=78`); the floor is anchored just below the measured combined line+branch total and ratchets toward the 80% target as gact code gains tests. Add tests in the matching domain folder and prefer deterministic fixtures from `tests/conftest.py`. Integration tests that need LM Studio are already guarded with skip conditions.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
The history follows Conventional Commit style, e.g. `feat(api): ...`, `fix(ci): ...`, `test(core): ...`, `docs(04-03): ...`. Keep subject lines imperative and scoped.

PRs should include:
- a short problem/solution summary
- linked issue(s) when applicable
- test/lint evidence (commands + result)
- API/CLI example output when behavior changes
