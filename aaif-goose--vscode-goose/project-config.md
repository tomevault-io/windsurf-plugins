# Vscode Extension for Goose

The goal of this project is to ensure a thin UI bridge between Goose and VS Code via ACP - nothing else.

- We want to be very deliberate when we add new UI features.
- No bloat, absolutely.
- Try and stick to Goose desktop aesthetics as much as possible.
- When choosing libraries to include, choose well supported yet the cleanest and leanest option
- Always look up the latest stable version when installing libraries
- Prefer functional programming
- Prefer using bun tooling as much possible

## Additional Context

1. More Context is available here: ./.rp1/context/index.md
2. Progressively load references available in the above file when more context is needed.

<!-- rp1:start:v0.7.1 -->
## rp1 Knowledge Base

**Use Progressive Disclosure Pattern**

Location: `.rp1/context/`

Files:
- index.md (always load first)
- architecture.md
- modules.md
- patterns.md
- concept_map.md

Loading rules:
1. Always read index.md first.
2. Then load based on task type:
   - Code review: patterns.md
   - Bug investigation: architecture.md, modules.md
   - Feature work: modules.md, patterns.md
   - Strategic or system-wide analysis: all files

## rp1 Skill Awareness

You have access to rp1 skills. When you notice the user working on a task
that an rp1 skill addresses, briefly suggest it.

### Suggestion Rules
- Limit to 1 suggestion per turn. Format: skill name, one sentence why, offer to run.
- Do not re-suggest a skill the user declined this session.
- Do not suggest while an rp1 workflow is already running.
- Only suggest when there is a clear match to the user's current activity.
- For deeper questions about rp1, suggest the user invoke /guide.
