# Rules for Writing Cursor Rules

This document provides guidelines for creating and maintaining Cursor IDE rules for the MCP DevTools repository.

@url https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai
@file .cursor/rules/repository-structure.mdc
@file .cursor/rules/ai-assisted-development.mdc

## Rule Structure

Each rule file should follow this structure:

````markdown
---
description: Brief description of what the rule enforces
globs: pattern/to/match/files.ts
alwaysApply: true|false
---

# Rule Title

Brief introduction to the rule and its purpose.

@file path/to/example/file.ts
@file path/to/related/rule.mdc
@url https://relevant-docs-url.com/

## Sections

Content organized into clear sections with examples.

## Examples

```typescript
// Code examples demonstrating the rule
```
````

## Guidelines

1. **First Guideline**

   - Explanation point 1
   - Explanation point 2

2. **Second Guideline**
   - Explanation point 1
   - Explanation point 2

```

## Frontmatter Requirements

Every rule must include these frontmatter fields:

1. **description**: A concise one-line description of the rule
2. **globs**: File pattern(s) the rule applies to
3. **alwaysApply**: Whether the rule should automatically apply

## File References

Rules should reference:

1. **Example Files**: Include `@file` references to real examples in the codebase
2. **Related Rules**: Link to related rules with `@file` references
3. **External Documentation**: Link to relevant external documentation with `@url`

## Guidelines for Writing Effective Rules

1. **Be Specific**
   - Rules should provide clear, actionable guidance
   - Include real examples from the codebase when possible
   - Explain both what to do and what to avoid

2. **Organize Content**
   - Use clear headings and subheadings
   - Group related information together
   - Use numbered lists for sequential steps
   - Use bullet points for related items

3. **Include Code Examples**
   - Provide complete, working examples
   - Comment code examples to explain important points
   - Show both correct and incorrect patterns

4. **Connect with Other Rules**
   - Reference related rules
   - Avoid duplicating content across rules
   - Ensure consistent guidance across all rules

5. **Keep Updated**
   - Review and update rules when project standards change
   - Ensure examples remain valid as the codebase evolves
   - Add new rules as needed for new patterns or technologies
```
