# GitHub Copilot Code Review Instructions

This document provides comprehensive code review guidelines for the throttled-py project,
ensuring consistency and quality in all pull requests reviewed by GitHub Copilot.

> **⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before every review.
> Treat it as the source of truth for project conventions and workflow.
>
> **⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Every PR review summary **MUST** begin with:
> `✓ Review conducted following guidelines defined in .github/copilot-instructions.md`

[TOC]

## Core Review Principles

As a Copilot agent reviewing this project, prioritize the following principles:

1.  **Clarity and Maintainability**: Code must be easy to read, understand, and change.
2.  **Correctness and Reliability**: Ensure algorithms are implemented correctly. Pay close attention to concurrency (`asyncio`, `threading`), thread safety, and atomic operations, as they are critical for a rate-limiting library.
3.  **Performance**: Rate limiting must be fast. Review data structures and algorithms in hot paths.
4.  **Test Relevance**: New behavior should be covered by tests proportional to its risk.

## Documentation Review Guidelines

### English Documentation

English documentation must follow the [Google Markdown Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html).

**Key Requirements:**

- **Line Length**: Maintain an 80-character line limit (exceptions: links, tables, headings, code blocks)
- **Headings**:
  - Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, etc.)
  - Use unique and descriptive names for each heading
  - Add spacing after `#` and newlines before/after headings
  - Use only one H1 heading per document
- **Lists**: Use lazy numbering for long ordered lists
- **Code Blocks**:
  - Always declare the language for syntax highlighting
  - Prefer fenced code blocks (```) over indented code blocks
- **Links**:
  - Use informative link titles
  - Use reference links for long URLs or repeated links
  - Define reference links after their first use
- **Tables**: Use tables only for tabular data; prefer lists when appropriate
- **Trailing Whitespace**: Do not use trailing whitespace
- **Document Layout**: Follow this structure:
  ```markdown

### Chinese Documentation

Chinese documentation must follow the [Chinese Copywriting Guidelines](https://github.com/ruanyf/document-style-guide).

**Key Requirements:**

- **Spacing**:
  - Add space between Chinese and English characters
  - Add space between Chinese and numbers
  - Add space between numbers and units (except for degrees, percentages)
- **Punctuation**:
  - Use full-width punctuation for Chinese text
  - Use half-width punctuation for English text and code
  - Do not add space before or after full-width punctuation
- **Nouns**:
  - Use correct capitalization for proper nouns (e.g., GitHub, Python, macOS)
  - Maintain brand name capitalization
- **Numbers**:
  - Use Arabic numerals for statistics and measurements
  - Numbers with more than 4 digits should use comma separators (e.g., 1,000)
- **Links**: Ensure link text is meaningful and descriptive

## Python Code Review Guidelines

As an expert-level Python engineer, provide professional feedback on the following aspects:

### 1. Code Quality & Style

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Ensure code follows [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints (PEP 484) for function signatures and complex variables
- **Docstrings**: Review docstrings against `CONTRIBUTING.md`; public API docstrings should render correctly in Sphinx
- **Line Length and Formatting**: Use `pyproject.toml` as the source of truth
- **Import Organization**:
  - Group imports: standard library, third-party, local (as enforced by `ruff`).
  - Use absolute imports over relative imports
  - Avoid wildcard imports (`from module import *`)

### 2. Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: `snake_case` for variables and functions
- **Classes**: `PascalCase` for class names
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- **Private Members**: Prefix with single underscore `_private_method`
- **Name Clarity**: Use descriptive, meaningful names that reveal intent
- **Avoid Abbreviations**: Except for well-known abbreviations (e.g., `id`, `url`, `http`)

### 3. Design Patterns & Architecture

- **SOLID Principles**:
  - Single Responsibility: Each class/function should have one reason to change
  - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
  - Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
  - Interface Segregation: Many specific interfaces are better than one general interface
  - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Design Patterns**: Apply appropriate patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate business logic, data access, and presentation layers

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **Algorithm Efficiency**:
  - Evaluate time and space complexity
  - Suggest more efficient algorithms when applicable
