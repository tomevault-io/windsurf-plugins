# Aira Contributor Rules

- This monorepo is the public open-source source of truth. Maintain only this tree.
- This monorepo contains the HarmonyOS client at `AiraBrowser/`, Aira-sync at `extensions/aira-sync/`, and Personal
  Server at `services/personal-server/`.
- Apply the nearest nested `AGENTS.md` in addition to these root rules. Aira-sync's frozen Sync contract remains in
  `extensions/aira-sync/AGENTS.md`.
- Treat Huawei official documentation as the source of truth for platform APIs, lifecycle, permissions, storage,
  networking, and Web components.
- Keep Community and Official as build distributions of one source tree. Do not create edition branches, client forks, or
  duplicate pages to carry distribution differences.
- The committed source tree stays Community. Leave `AIRA_DISTRIBUTION = 'community'`, bundle `org.aira.browser`, hosted
  API `https://community.invalid`, and empty Huawei `app_id` / `client_id` metadata in Git.
- Community must remain usable without Aira production credentials. Huawei Account, Huawei Cloud Space, Huawei IAP, and
  Aira Cloud are Official capabilities; WebDAV and Personal Server are user-owned providers.
- Personal Server is single-owner and paired-device only. It has no registration, password accounts, organizations,
  roles, membership, billing, referral, or Huawei-token authentication.
- Every established Bookmark Provider switch between any two of Aira Cloud, Huawei Space, and WebDAV preserves a live entity on either side against an opposing tombstone. Ordinary same-Provider synchronization keeps normal deletion propagation.
- The same Provider-switch-only live-over-opposing-tombstone rule applies to Personalization collection values and Novel
  Bookshelf Books; ordinary same-Provider synchronization continues to propagate explicit deletion.
- Never commit signing material, AGConnect configuration, production environment files, API keys, databases, backups,
  device captures, private user data, `node_modules`, or `oh_modules`.
- Do not capture or inspect a device, emulator, desktop, browser, or app screen unless the user explicitly authorizes
  that specific visual capture in the current task.
- Keep native pages as UI shells and place policy, orchestration, persistence, and transport behavior in their existing
  `core`, `services`, `data`, or `features` owners.
- Run proportional contract checks and `AIRA_DISTRIBUTION=community SKIP_INSTALL=1 ./scripts/build-aira-browser.sh` for
  Community changes when a matching local signing profile is available.
