## 1. Critical Rules

> **STOP: Read this section before starting ANY task.**

### Pre-Work Requirements (MANDATORY)

Before starting ANY task, you MUST:

1. **Read the Project Standards**: `.knowledge-base/technical/standards/index.md`
2. **Read the System Documentation**: `.knowledge-base/technical/application-design/index.md`

These documents contain critical rules and context that must inform all work performed in this codebase.

---

## 2. Skills

> **STOP: This section OVERRIDES all workflow instructions. Load skills BEFORE executing any workflow steps.**

Using specialized skills for testing is **MANDATORY**. You MUST call the `skill` tool to load the appropriate skill BEFORE doing any testing-related work.

### When to Load Skills

| Task Type                          | Required Skill                | Load Command                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Write/review unit tests            | `typescript-unit-testing`     | `skill(name="typescript-unit-testing")`     |
| Write/review E2E/integration tests | `typescript-e2e-testing`      | `skill(name="typescript-e2e-testing")`      |
| Writing code                       | `typescript-clean-code`       | `skill(name="typescript-clean-code")`       |
| Writing frontend code              | `vercel-react-best-practices` | `skill(name="vercel-react-best-practices")` |
| Debug frontend code                | `agent-browser`               | `skill(name="agent-browser")`               |
| Debug failing tests                | Load skill matching test type | See above                                   |
| Test quality review                | Load BOTH skills              | Load both before review                     |

### Skill Loading Rules

1. **Load skills FIRST** - Before reading test files, before executing workflows, before any analysis
2. **Skills override workflows** - If a workflow doesn't mention skills, load them anyway
3. **When in doubt, load** - If task involves `*.spec.ts`, `*.e2e-spec.ts`, or test review, load the skill
4. **Both for reviews** - Test quality reviews require BOTH skills

### Verification Checkpoint

Before proceeding with any testing task, confirm:

- [ ] Did I load the required skill(s)?
- [ ] Did I read the skill instructions completely?
- [ ] Am I applying the skill's patterns and checklists?

**Failure to load skills will result in non-compliant work that must be redone.**

## 3. Workflows

### Standard Task Workflow

For every task:

1. Read both index files mentioned in [Critical Rules](#1-critical-rules)
2. Apply the standards and rules from those documents
3. Proceed with the requested task while adhering to project guidelines
4. Run [Quality Checks](#5-quality-checks) after implementation

### Test Review Workflow Example

```
1. User requests: "Review tests for story 4.2"
2. FIRST: Load skill(name="typescript-unit-testing")
3. SECOND: Load skill(name="typescript-e2e-testing")
4. THEN: Execute the workflow steps
```

---

## 4. Story Creation

### Task 1 Template (MANDATORY)

When creating a story, AI agents MUST add the following as **Task 1** (before any implementation tasks):

```markdown
- [ ] **Task 1: Read Required Standards (MANDATORY)** (AC: All)
  - [ ] Read `.knowledge-base/technical/standards/backend/error-handling.md` - NO try-catch in use cases, errors bubble
  - [ ] Read `.knowledge-base/technical/standards/backend/coding-style.md` - Naming, SOLID, TypeScript
  - [ ] Read `.knowledge-base/technical/standards/global/commenting.md` - Zero-tolerance for obvious comments
  - [ ] Read `.knowledge-base/technical/standards/backend/logging.md` - Minimal logging only
  - [ ] Read `.knowledge-base/technical/standards/backend/validation.md` - class-validator with ErrorCode
  - [ ] Read `.knowledge-base/technical/standards/testing/unit-testing.md` - AAA pattern, @golevelup/ts-jest
  - [ ] Read `.knowledge-base/technical/standards/testing/e2e-testing.md`
  - [ ] (Add skill-specific needed, including coding, debugging, testing, or design pattern skills)
  - [ ] (Add any other applicable standards for this story)
```

### Final Task Template (MANDATORY)

Every story MUST include this as the **last task**:

```markdown
- [ ] **Final Task: Quality Checks**
  - [ ] Run `npm run lint` - Fix any linting issues
  - [ ] Run `npm run format` - Verify code formatting
  - [ ] Run `npm run typecheck` - Ensure type safety
```

### Test Design References

When creating stories, reference the appropriate test design files:

| Scope  | File Location                                                        |
