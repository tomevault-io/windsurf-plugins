description: Code style, naming, and TypeScript safety

- Prefer descriptive names; avoid 1–2 character identifiers.
- Exported functions and public APIs must have explicit types; no `any`.
- Never use as any type casting for escaping type errors.
- always use kebab-case for file names and folder names.
- Keep edits minimal and localized; do not reformat unrelated code.
- Preserve existing indentation and whitespace.
- Use early returns; avoid deep nesting; avoid broad try/catch that swallow errors.
