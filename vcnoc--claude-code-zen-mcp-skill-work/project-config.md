# Claude Development Guide for Zen MCP Server

This file contains essential commands and workflows for developing and maintaining the Zen MCP Server when working with Claude. Use these instructions to efficiently run quality checks, manage the server, check logs, and run tests.

## Quick Reference Commands

### Code Quality Checks

Before making any changes or submitting PRs, always run the comprehensive quality checks:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source venv/bin/activate

# Run all quality checks (linting, formatting, tests)
./code_quality_checks.sh
```

This script automatically runs:
- Ruff linting with auto-fix
- Black code formatting 
- Import sorting with isort
- Complete unit test suite (excluding integration tests)
- Verification that all checks pass 100%

**Run Integration Tests (requires API keys):**
```bash
# Run integration tests that make real API calls
./run_integration_tests.sh

# Run integration tests + simulator tests
./run_integration_tests.sh --with-simulator
```

### Server Management

#### Setup/Update the Server
```bash
# Run setup script (handles everything)
./run-server.sh
```

This script will:
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Create/update .env file
- Configure MCP with Claude
- Verify API keys

#### View Logs
```bash
# Follow logs in real-time
./run-server.sh -f

# Or manually view logs
tail -f logs/mcp_server.log
```

### Log Management

#### View Server Logs
```bash
# View last 500 lines of server logs
tail -n 500 logs/mcp_server.log

# Follow logs in real-time
tail -f logs/mcp_server.log

# View specific number of lines
tail -n 100 logs/mcp_server.log

# Search logs for specific patterns
grep "ERROR" logs/mcp_server.log
grep "tool_name" logs/mcp_activity.log
```

#### Monitor Tool Executions Only
```bash
# View tool activity log (focused on tool calls and completions)
tail -n 100 logs/mcp_activity.log

# Follow tool activity in real-time
tail -f logs/mcp_activity.log

# Use simple tail commands to monitor logs
tail -f logs/mcp_activity.log | grep -E "(TOOL_CALL|TOOL_COMPLETED|ERROR|WARNING)"
```

#### Available Log Files

**Current log files (with proper rotation):**
```bash
# Main server log (all activity including debug info) - 20MB max, 10 backups
tail -f logs/mcp_server.log

# Tool activity only (TOOL_CALL, TOOL_COMPLETED, etc.) - 20MB max, 5 backups  
tail -f logs/mcp_activity.log
```

**For programmatic log analysis (used by tests):**
```python
# Import the LogUtils class from simulator tests
from simulator_tests.log_utils import LogUtils

# Get recent logs
recent_logs = LogUtils.get_recent_server_logs(lines=500)

# Check for errors
errors = LogUtils.check_server_logs_for_errors()

# Search for specific patterns
matches = LogUtils.search_logs_for_pattern("TOOL_CALL.*debug")
```

### Testing

Simulation tests are available to test the MCP server in a 'live' scenario, using your configured
API keys to ensure the models are working and the server is able to communicate back and forth. 

**IMPORTANT**: After any code changes, restart your Claude session for the changes to take effect.

#### Run All Simulator Tests
```bash
# Run the complete test suite
python communication_simulator_test.py

# Run tests with verbose output
python communication_simulator_test.py --verbose
```

#### Quick Test Mode (Recommended for Time-Limited Testing)
```bash
# Run quick test mode - 6 essential tests that provide maximum functionality coverage
python communication_simulator_test.py --quick

# Run quick test mode with verbose output
python communication_simulator_test.py --quick --verbose
```

**Quick mode runs these 6 essential tests:**
- `cross_tool_continuation` - Cross-tool conversation memory testing (chat, thinkdeep, codereview, analyze, debug)
- `conversation_chain_validation` - Core conversation threading and memory validation
- `consensus_workflow_accurate` - Consensus tool with flash model and stance testing
- `codereview_validation` - CodeReview tool with flash model and multi-step workflows
- `planner_validation` - Planner tool with flash model and complex planning workflows
- `token_allocation_validation` - Token allocation and conversation history buildup testing

**Why these 6 tests:** They cover the core functionality including conversation memory (`utils/conversation_memory.py`), chat tool functionality, file processing and deduplication, model selection (flash/flashlite/o3), and cross-tool conversation workflows. These tests validate the most critical parts of the system in minimal time.

**Note:** Some workflow tools (analyze, codereview, planner, consensus, etc.) require specific workflow parameters and may need individual testing rather than quick mode testing.

#### Run Individual Simulator Tests (For Detailed Testing)
```bash
# List all available tests
python communication_simulator_test.py --list-tests

# RECOMMENDED: Run tests individually for better isolation and debugging
python communication_simulator_test.py --individual basic_conversation
python communication_simulator_test.py --individual content_validation
