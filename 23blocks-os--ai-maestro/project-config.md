# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Claude Code Dashboard** - A browser-based terminal dashboard for managing multiple Claude Code agents running in tmux on macOS. The application auto-discovers agents from tmux sessions and provides a unified web interface with real-time terminal streaming.

**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Local-only, auto-discovery, no authentication
**Tech Stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, xterm.js, WebSocket, node-pty, Tailwind CSS, lucide-react
**Platform:** macOS 12.0+, Node.js 18.17+/20.x, tmux 3.0+
**Branding:** Space Grotesk font, titled "AI Maestro"
**Port:** Application runs on port 23000 (http://localhost:23000)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
yarn install             # Install all dependencies
yarn dev                 # Start dev server with hot reload (http://localhost:23000)

# Production
yarn build               # Build optimized production bundle
yarn start               # Start production server (http://localhost:23000)
pm2 restart ai-maestro   # Restart production server via PM2

# Testing
yarn test                # Run unit tests (vitest)
yarn test:watch          # Run tests in watch mode

# Testing tmux sessions (for development)
tmux new-session -s test-session     # Create test session
tmux list-sessions                   # List all sessions (what the app discovers)
tmux kill-session -t test-session    # Clean up test session
```

**Port Configuration:** The application is configured to run on port 23000. This is set in the PM2 configuration.

**Health Check:** Do NOT use `/api/health` to check if the site is live (it doesn't exist). Use `/api/sessions` instead - it returns the list of agents and confirms the server is running.

## Version Management

**IMPORTANT:** When bumping the version, ALWAYS use the centralized script:

```bash
./scripts/bump-version.sh patch    # 0.17.12 -> 0.17.13
./scripts/bump-version.sh minor    # 0.17.12 -> 0.18.0
./scripts/bump-version.sh major    # 0.17.12 -> 1.0.0
./scripts/bump-version.sh 1.0.0    # Set specific version
```

This script updates ALL version references across the codebase:
- `version.json` (source of truth)
- `package.json`
- `scripts/remote-install.sh`
- `README.md` (badge)
- `docs/index.html` (schema + display)
- `docs/ai-index.html`
- `docs/BACKLOG.md`

**DO NOT manually edit version numbers in individual files.** Always use the script to ensure consistency.

**CLI Script Versioning:** The `aimaestro-agent.sh` CLI tool uses an independent semver (`v1.x.x`) separate from the app version (`0.24.x`). The CLI is distributed via the plugin repo and has its own release cadence.

## Pre-PR Checklist (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ STOP! Before creating ANY Pull Request to main, complete this checklist:**

```
□ 1. TESTS PASS: yarn test
□ 2. BUMP VERSION: ./scripts/bump-version.sh patch
□ 3. BUILD PASSES: yarn build
□ 4. COMMIT version bump with your changes
```

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Every PR to main MUST include a version bump. No exceptions.

## Release & Marketing Workflow

### Pull Request Protocol

**IMPORTANT:** Every time you create a Pull Request to main, also draft an X (Twitter) post to announce the release.

**PR Creation Checklist:**
1. ✅ **VERSION BUMPED** (see Pre-PR Checklist above - this should already be done)
2. Create PR with comprehensive description (summary, features, bug fixes, breaking changes)
3. Draft X post highlighting key features and improvements
4. Include release notes or link to PR in the post
5. Use relevant hashtags: #AIcoding #DevTools #OpenSource
6. Consider adding screenshots/GIFs for visual features
7. Post during peak hours (9-11am or 1-3pm EST)

**X Post Template:**
```
[Emoji] Shipping [Feature Name] today!

Key improvements:
• [Feature 1]
• [Feature 2]
• [Feature 3]

[Call to action - Star/Try/Share]
[Link to PR or GitHub]

#AIcoding #DevTools
```

**Examples:**
- Major release: "Shipping AI Maestro v0.3.3! 🚀"
- Feature addition: "New feature: SSH configuration for tmux 🔐"
- Bug fixes: "Squashed bugs and improved stability 🐛"

Keep posts concise (<280 chars when possible), engaging, and focused on user benefits rather than technical implementation.

### Marketing Content Location

**IMPORTANT:** All marketing content files MUST be created in the `marketing/` folder:

```
marketing/
  medium-article.md      # Blog posts for Medium
  linkedin-post.md       # LinkedIn content
  x-post.md              # X/Twitter posts
  findings.md            # Research notes (planning skill)
  task_plan.md           # Task tracking (planning skill)
  progress.md            # Progress logs (planning skill)
```

- The `marketing/` folder is gitignored - content is deleted after publishing
- Never create these files in the project root
- When using the planning skill for marketing tasks, set the output directory to `marketing/`

## Architecture: Critical Design Patterns

### 1. Custom Server Architecture (server.mjs)

**Why it exists:** Next.js alone doesn't support WebSocket on the same port as HTTP. The custom server combines both.

```
HTTP Requests → Next.js handlers (API routes, pages)
