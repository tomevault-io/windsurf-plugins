# AGENTS.md

Guidelines for coding agents when working on the Duets repository.

> **Note:** `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file (`AGENTS.md`). Edits via
> either path modify `AGENTS.md` on disk. When staging changes, always use
> `git add AGENTS.md` explicitly — `git add CLAUDE.md` will not work because
> Git tracks the symlink target, not the symlink itself.

> **IMPORTANT — Language policy (read before responding):**
> - **Assistant prose outside repository content** (chat responses, reviews,
    > explanations, summaries, plans, status updates, scratch notes, handoff notes,
    > and design discussion notes): write in **the same language the user used**.
    > Never default to English.
> - **Repository content** (source code, comments, commits, docs, ADRs):
    > always write in **English only**.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build the entire solution
dotnet build

# Run the sample application
dotnet run --project src/Duets.Sandbox

# Run tests
dotnet test
```

The solution targets **.NET 10**. The SDK version may be pinned via `mise.toml`.

## Project Structure

- `Duets.slnx` — Solution file (XML-based slnx format)
- `Directory.Build.props` — Shared build properties (TFM, nullable, etc.) applied to all projects
- `src/`
  - `Duets/` — Core library (public API): session, declarations, transpiler interface
    - `Resources/language-service.js` — Embedded TypeScript language service script loaded server-side by `TypeScriptService` for completions
  - `Duets.Pad/` — DuetsPad browser debug pad package; depends on `Duets` and `HttpHarker` (see `src/Duets.Pad/README.md`)
    - `Resources/StaticFiles/` — Embedded web assets compiled as `EmbeddedResource` and served by `DuetsPadService` at runtime
  - `Duets.Jint/` — [Jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint) backend package: `JintScriptEngine`,
    `BabelTranspiler`, `TypeScriptService`, `ExtensionMethodRegistry`, `DuetsSessionConfigurationExtensions`
  - `HttpHarker/` — Standalone lightweight HTTP server library (may be extracted to its own repo)
  - `Duets.Sandbox/` — Multi-mode debugging CLI (batch, repl, serve, complete); not part of the public API
  - `shared/` — `internal` utility code shared across all projects via `<Compile Include>` (not a separate assembly);
    place cross-project internal helpers here
- `samples/` — Runnable file-based app examples, grouped per package (run with `dotnet run samples/<package>/<file>.cs`)
- `docs/`
  - `architecture.md` — Architecture overview (current snapshot)
  - `decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- `tests/`
  - `Duets.Tests/` — Unit tests (xUnit v3)
  - `Duets.Pad.Tests/` — Unit tests for `Duets.Pad`
  - `HttpHarker.Tests/` — Unit tests for `HttpHarker`
  - `shared/` — test-support sources shared across test projects via `<Compile Include>`

## Architecture & Design

- [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) — Current architecture snapshot. Read this before making structural
  changes or answering any design or feasibility question.
- [docs/decisions/index.md](docs/decisions/index.md) — ADR index: Title, Keywords, and Abstract for all ADRs. Read this
  to identify relevant decisions before reading full ADRs.
- [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/) — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). ADR-N is at `docs/decisions/<N>_*.md`.

When a session involves a design decision (new component, technology choice, API design trade-off, etc.), draft an ADR
in `docs/decisions/` at the end of the session. If the decision affects the overall architecture, update
`docs/architecture.md` to reflect the new state.

## Committing

Use the `/commit` skill to commit changes. It handles commit granularity, code style, pre-commit checks, and message
authoring.

## Language

There are two distinct contexts with different language rules:

**Repository content** — source code, comments, commit messages, documentation, ADRs, and any other checked-in text
files — **must be in English**.

**Assistant prose outside repository content** — chat responses, reviews, explanations, summaries, plans, status
updates, scratch notes, handoff notes, design discussion notes, and other non-committed working prose — **must be in the
same language the user used**. Do not default to English. These are conversational or working outputs, not repository
content, and the distinction must be respected even when the subject matter is code.

## Code Style

Use `scripts/format.cs` as the repository formatting entry point. It is okay to run this script manually, even though
Agent Stop hooks also run it automatically. Generated code must still follow the code style and rules defined in
`.editorconfig`.

Format/lint suggestions must be resolved, not merely observed. `scripts/format.cs` auto-applies only safe fixes; tools
such as biome additionally *report* unsafe fixes (e.g. `useOptionalChain`) without applying them — deliberately, because
they may change behavior and require judgment. The script is not changed to blanket-apply unsafe fixes; exercising that
judgment is the agent's job. Every reported suggestion must be triaged to a decision before a session ends: review each
one and either apply it (when it is behavior-preserving and correct) or reject it deliberately (suppress via config or an
