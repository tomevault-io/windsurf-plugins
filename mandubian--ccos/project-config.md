# RTFS 2.0 Compliance Snapshot

- Specs live in `docs/rtfs-2.0/specs/`. Core refs: `01` grammar & syntax, `02` evaluation, `03` host boundary, `04` stdlib, `05` macros, `07` immutability, `08` concurrency, `09` continuations, `10` formal spec.
- Follow capability system contract (`06`) and CCOS bridge (`13-rtfs-ccos-integration-guide.md`).
- Programs stay pure and deterministic; mutate state only via host-coordinated continuations or checkpoints.
- All values must validate against declared schemas; types inferred from spec `03-object-schemas.md`.
- Capability calls require attestation, provenance, and secure parameters per `06` and `00-philosophy.md` security model.
- Continuation handoffs must honor host yield protocol (`09`) and resume through checkpoint design (`98-migration-plan-immutability.md`).
- Never bypass step special forms, capability marketplace rules, or security gates defined in the RTFS specs.
