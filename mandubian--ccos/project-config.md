# When Feature Complete (implementation, test and doc): Commit if needed

## 🚀 **Documentation and Commit Rule**

A complete feature is not a tiny update or a small fix. It is a significant addition or change to the codebase that enhances functionality, performance, or usability.

When you have successfully implemented and tested a complete feature, not a tiny update, you MUST:

### 1. **Document when needed** 📝
- **Update relevant documentation** when feature (not a tiny update) is complete
- **Add comprehensive comments** to the code explaining the implementation
- **Update SPEC files** spec files for CCOS are in docs/ccos/specs and for RTFS-2.0 in docs/rtfs-2.0/specs
- **Update README files** if the feature affects user-facing functionality
- **Update progress reports** (like WORKTREE_PROGRESS.md) with completion status
- **Add usage examples** if the feature is user-facing in docs/ccos/guides or docs/rtfs-2.0/guides, never in root direct

### 2. **Test or execute the feature before committing** 💾
- **Test or execute the feature before committing**
- **If the feature is not working, do not commit**
- **If the feature is working, commit**
- **If the feature is working, but you are not sure if it is working, do not commit**
- **If the feature is working, but you are not sure if it is working, do not commit**

### 3. **Commit when you think it is meaningful to commit** 💾
- **DO NOT wait** until the end of a PR or issue to commit
- **Commit as soon as** the feature is implemented and tested
- **Use descriptive commit messages** that explain what was implemented
- **Include test results** in commit messages if relevant
- **Reference issue numbers** in commit messages when applicable

### 4. **Do not add documentation in root directory except if very generic**
