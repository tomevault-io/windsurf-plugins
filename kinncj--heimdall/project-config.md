# Copilot CLI Instructions — MAPLE

## Session Start Protocol (mandatory)

Before responding to any implementation request, check:

```bash
python3 -c "import json; s=json.load(open('.claude/state/maple.json')); print(s.get('status',''))" 2>/dev/null || echo "none"
```

- **`RUNNING` or `PAUSED`** — pipeline is active. Continue within it.
- **anything else** — no pipeline active. Route through `/pipeline-runner` before writing to `app/` or `tests/`:

```
/pipeline-runner implement-stories   — implement existing approved stories
/pipeline-runner new-ui-feature      — full UI pipeline with design gates
/pipeline-runner api-endpoint        — API feature pipeline
/pipeline-runner bugfix              — reproduce → fix → validate
```

Never write implementation code outside a running pipeline stage.

## Agent System

Default agent: `@orchestrator`. It never writes code — delegates everything to specialist agents.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/feature {description}` | Full 8-phase pipeline |
| `/bugfix {description}` | Reproduce → fix → validate → CHANGELOG |
| `/validate` | Run full test suite |
| `/tdd {requirement}` | Single RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle |
| `/pipeline-runner {name}` | Named taffy workflow: `new-ui-feature`, `api-endpoint`, `bugfix`, `design-refresh` |
| `/ship-safe` | Run `npx ship-safe audit .` security scan before shipping |

## RTK Token Optimizer

`rtk` is installed alongside `maple`. It hooks into Bash tool calls and compresses output before it reaches the LLM — reducing token use 60–90% on common dev commands (git, grep, build logs, test output). No command changes required. Disable per-session with `RTK_DISABLE=1`.

## Specialist Agents

| Agent | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `@orchestrator` | Decomposes features, delegates, gates phases |
| `@architect` | ADRs, system design, threat models, pre-ship audit |
| `@qa` | Writes failing tests before implementation |
| `@rubber-duck` | Second-opinion reviewer at plan/impl/test checkpoints |
| `@spec-kit` | Requirement intake → Gherkin story files |
| `@ux-researcher` | Personas, journey maps |
| `@wireframe-architect` | Low-fi wireframes |
| `@visual-identity-designer` | Design tokens, brand system |
| `@ui-mockup-builder` | High-fidelity code mockups |
| `@a11y-auditor` | WCAG 2.2 AA audit |
| `@docs` | Technical documentation |
| `@product-owner` | Story prioritization |

## Skills (read before tasks)

Read skills from `.claude/skills/` before executing tasks:

| Skill | When to use |
|---|---|
| `karpathy-audit` | After Phase 5 IMPLEMENT (gates Phase 6 advancement); detects scope creep + over-engineering |
| `humanizer` | After Phase 7 DOCUMENT (polish prose, remove AI-isms) |
| `tdd-workflow` | Before any implementation (Phase 5) |
| `playwright-cli` | E2E / browser testing |
| `github-cli` | Issue + PR management via `gh` |
| `gh-issues` | Issue CRUD |
| `gh-projects` | GitHub Project board management |
| `gherkin-authoring` | Writing Gherkin story files |
| `rubber-duck` | Second-opinion review |
| `wireframe` | Before dispatching wireframe-architect |
| `a11y-audit` | Before dispatching a11y-auditor |
| `mermaid-diagrams` | Architecture / flow diagrams |
| `rfc-adr` | ADR format |
| `threat-modeling` | STRIDE threat analysis |
| `ship-safe` | Pre-ship security scan (`/ship-safe`) |

## Hard Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **TDD is mandatory.** `@qa` writes a failing test FIRST. Implementation follows. Never write implementation before a failing test exists.
2. **Orchestrator never writes code.** It decomposes, delegates, and gates.
3. **3 failures → escalate.** After 3 consecutive failures on any task, stop and surface to the human.
4. **No secrets in code.** Never write API keys, passwords, or tokens directly in source files.
5. **Conventional Commits.** All commits use `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `infra:`, `refactor:`.
6. **`make test-all` must pass** before any PR is created (Phase 8 gate).
7. **Karpathy principles enforced at Phase 5→6 gate.** After IMPLEMENT, `/karpathy-audit` scores code; <70 blocks Phase 6. Never bypass.

## Karpathy Principles (Phase 5 → Phase 6 Gate)

After Phase 5 IMPLEMENT is complete, Orchestrator auto-calls `@karpathy-audit` to score against 4 principles:

| Principle | Enforces |
|-----------|----------|
| **Think Before Coding** | Assumptions stated. Ambiguities surfaced. No silent interpretations. |
| **Simplicity First** | Minimum code. No speculation, abstractions, or over-engineering. |
| **Surgical Changes** | Only requested changes. No unrelated refactoring or cleanup. |
| **Goal-Driven Execution** | Tests first. Success criteria explicit. Every line traces to requirement. |

**Scoring:** ≥90 auto-advance, 70-89 require approval, <70 BLOCK.

Manual invocation: `/karpathy-audit` or `@karpathy-audit` at any phase.

Read `project.config.yaml`:
- Check `stack:` — if any key is null, run tech-stack discovery (ask the user).
- Check `sdlc.mode` — if `standard`, Spec-Kit intake applies before DISCOVER.

## After Writing Code

Run these in order:
```bash
make lint
make test
```

If either fails, **fix the failure before proceeding**. Do not move to the next task with a red build.

## Before `git commit` or `git push`

Run SDLC gates:
```bash
