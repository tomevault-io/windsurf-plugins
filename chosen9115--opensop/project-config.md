# OpenSOP — Claude Code Project Guide

This repo is the **OpenSOP standard**: the specification ([`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md)), the manifesto ([`MANIFESTO.md`](./MANIFESTO.md)), and the local-first CLI ([`cli/`](./cli/)). It is not a Rails app — the reference server implementation lives at [Chosen9115/opensop-rails](https://github.com/Chosen9115/opensop-rails).

---

## What lives here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `SPEC.md` | The OpenSOP 0.6 specification — the contract any server must implement |
| `MANIFESTO.md` | The thesis: why processes are infrastructure |
| `cli/` | The local-first CLI (`bin/opensop`, single bash file) |
| `cli/CLAUDE.md` | CLI-specific conventions — start here for CLI work |
| `docs/` | User-facing docs: `AGENTS.md` (consolidated agent guide) |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | PR workflow + private process library guidance |

---

## CLI work

All CLI work starts in `cli/`. Read `cli/CLAUDE.md` before touching `cli/bin/opensop`. Key points:

- `cli/bin/opensop` is a single bash file (~1600 lines). No build step. The file is the binary.
- Test gate: `bash -n cli/bin/opensop && bash cli/test/test.sh` — run this before committing.
- Local is the default backend (v0.8+). `--remote`/`--server` routes to a server's `/sop/*` API.
- When you add or change a subcommand, update `cmd_help`, `README.md`'s subcommand table, and `cli/CHANGELOG.md` in the same commit.

---

## Spec work

`SPEC.md` is the contract shared between this repo and any conforming server (the reference is opensop-rails). Changes to `SPEC.md` must be coordinated:

1. Open an issue or PR here describing the spec change and its rationale.
2. Open a corresponding issue or PR in [Chosen9115/opensop-rails](https://github.com/Chosen9115/opensop-rails) covering the server-side implementation.
3. The two PRs should reference each other. Neither merges until both are ready (or the server PR is tracked as a known gap in the status section of the README).
4. If the CLI implements the changed behavior locally, update the CLI in the same PR or immediately following.

The `/sop/*` endpoint surface defined in `SPEC.md` §4.2 is the sole API contract. Don't let README, docs, or CLI help text describe endpoints or semantics that differ from the spec.

## How change ships

Non-trivial changes follow this loop:

1. **Branch off `main`.** Never commit to `main` directly. Branch naming: `feature/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`, `docs/...`.
2. **Implement** the change. For CLI work, follow the improvement loop in `cli/CLAUDE.md`. For spec work, follow the coordination steps above.
3. **Self-rate 1–10** across: correctness, simplicity, test coverage, naming, spec fidelity (does it match `SPEC.md`?), public-repo hygiene (no PII, no secrets, no internal identifiers). If any axis is below 7, name the gap and fix it.
4. **Open a PR** via `gh pr create`. PR description must include: what changed and why (1–3 bullets), self-rating scores, improvement applied or follow-up deferred, test plan.

Trivial changes (typos, copy edits, single-line config fixes, comment-only) can go directly.

## Public-repo hygiene (non-negotiable)

This repo is public. Every keystroke is potentially indexed and read by strangers.

Never commit:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| PII | Real names, emails, phone numbers, postal addresses |
| Secrets | API keys, tokens, passwords, signed URLs, private endpoints |
| Internal identifiers | Customer/company names from non-public contexts, internal team names, `*.internal` URLs |
| Tool output | Logs with any of the above, stack traces with internal hostnames |

Use generic placeholders in examples: `alice@example.com`, `Acme Corp`, `https://api.example.com/v1`, `sk-...REDACTED...`. When in doubt, redact.

## Core principles

- **Simplicity first.** Minimal-impact changes, no speculative abstractions.
- **Root causes, not workarounds.** Fix the underlying issue; no temporary patches.
- **Verify before claiming done.** Run tests; never assert green without proof.
- **Plan before building.** For multi-step work, write the plan first. If it goes sideways, replan rather than push through.
- **Spec is the source of truth.** If the CLI, docs, or README disagree with `SPEC.md`, fix the discrepancy — don't paper over it.
