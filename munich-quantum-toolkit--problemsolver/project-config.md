# MQT ProblemSolver

## Python

- Install package: `uv sync`
- Run tests: `uv run pytest`
- Nox test shortcuts: `uvx nox -s tests`, `uvx nox -s minimums`
- Python 3.14 variants: `uvx nox -s tests-3.14`, `uvx nox -s minimums-3.14`

## Documentation

- Sources: `docs/`
- Build docs locally: `uvx nox --non-interactive -s docs`
- Link check: `uvx nox -s docs -- -b linkcheck`

## Tech Stack

### General

- `prek` for pre-commit hooks

### Python

- Python 3.10+
- `uv` for installation, packaging, and tooling
- `ruff` for formatting/linting (configured in `pyproject.toml`)
- `ty` for type checking
- `pytest` for unit tests (located in `test/python/`)
- `nox` for task orchestration (tests, linting, docs)

### Documentation

- `sphinx`
- MyST (Markdown)
- Furo theme

## Development Guidelines

### General

- MUST read and follow `docs/ai_usage.md`. A human must review and understand
  all AI-assisted work. AI assistance must not be used for contributions to
  issues labeled `good first issue`.
- MUST run `uvx nox -s lint` after every batch of changes. This runs the full
  `prek` hook set from `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (including `ruff`, `typos`,
  `ty`, formatting, and metadata checks). All hooks must pass before submitting.
- MUST add or update tests for every code change, even if not explicitly
  requested.
- MUST follow existing code style by checking neighboring files for patterns.
- MUST include a commit footer attribution in the form
  `Assisted-by: [Model Name] via [Tool Name]` (example:
  `Assisted-by: Claude Sonnet 4.6 via GitHub Copilot`) if AI tools are used to
  prepare a commit.
- NEVER modify files that start with "This file has been generated from an
  external template. Please do not modify it directly." These files are managed
  by
  [the MQT templates action](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/templates)
  and changes will be overwritten.
- PREFER running targeted tests over the full test suite during development.

### GitHub Issues and Pull Requests

- MAY create, submit, and edit pull requests; create and manage issues; and
  comment on issues or pull requests when the task explicitly authorizes that
  external action. A single authorization may cover a clearly scoped task;
  per-message approval is not required. Actions outside that scope require fresh
  authorization. The human remains responsible for reviewing all submitted work.
- MUST use the repository's pull request template when one is present.
- Every agent-authored or agent-edited public text body MUST begin with
  `🤖 *AI text below* 🤖` on its first line. This applies to issue and pull
  request descriptions, review bodies, inline review comments, issue comments,
  replies, and other submitted text bodies; titles are exempt.
- When editing human-authored public text, preserve its original content and add
  the disclosure at the beginning of the edited field.
- MUST keep external communication accurate, specific, and non-repetitive; do
  not post low-quality or unsolicited comments.

### Python

- MUST use Google-style docstrings
- PREFER running a single Python version over the full test suite during
  development.
- PREFER fixing reported warnings over suppressing them (e.g., with `# noqa`
  comments for ruff); only add ignore rules when necessary and document why.
- PREFER fixing typing issues reported by `ty` before adding suppression
  comments (`# ty: ignore[code]`); suppressions are sometimes necessary for
  incompletely typed libraries (e.g., Qiskit).

## Self-Review Checklist

- Did `uvx nox -s lint` pass without errors?
- Are all changes covered by at least one automated test?
- Were any agent-authored issue or pull request texts explicitly authorized and
  marked with the required visible disclosure?
