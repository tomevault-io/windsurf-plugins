# Agent Testing Instructions

- Run `./tests.sh` before sending a pull request when your changes affect Rust code or
  behaviour.
- For documentation-only or comment-only updates, it is acceptable to skip automated tests.
  State explicitly in your summary that tests were not run and why.
- When tests fail due to environment limitations, include the failure output and describe
  the limitation in your final message.
