# AGENTS.md

## Mission
Build and maintain `mem.net` as a robust, configurable memory service that is easy to evolve and safe to operate.

## Working Principles
- Keep service logic generic; memory categories belong in caller conventions (optional SDK policy helpers).
- Favor deterministic behavior over implicit magic.
- Keep document writes auditable and conflict-safe.
- Enforce strict validation and clear error contracts.
- Keep documents bounded; move history/detail to events.

## First-Principles Rule
- Before introducing any new abstraction, state which core service capability it supports: slot resolution, write guardrails, deterministic context assembly, or lifecycle cleanup.
- If a concept does not directly support one of those capabilities in production today, keep it out of the runtime model.
- Prefer direct file/path contracts over cross-file registries or indirection unless there is a proven scaling need.

## Engineering Rules
- Use .NET 8 and keep external dependencies minimal.
- Prefer pure domain services over framework-coupled code.
- Keep APIs small and explicit; avoid hidden side effects.
- Every mutating endpoint must enforce ETag optimistic concurrency semantics.
- Every mutating endpoint must emit audit data.

## Execution Environment Rule
- In restricted sandbox sessions, `dotnet` restore/build/test/run workflows may fail with permission or process-launch errors.
- Before running `dotnet` validation commands, ask the user to switch to full access mode.
- If full access is not available, clearly report which `dotnet` checks could not be executed.

## Testing Rules
- Add or update framework unit/integration tests for every feature and regression.
- Keep executable spec tests as smoke/parity coverage where relevant.
- Include at least one negative test for validation/concurrency error paths.
- Keep tests deterministic and environment-independent.

## Documentation Rules
- Update `docs/project/TASK_BOARD.md` when status changes.
- Preserve historical status in `docs/archive/TASK_BOARD_ARCHIVE.md` when simplifying active board content.
- Keep `README.md` run instructions accurate.
- Keep implementation aligned with `docs/specs/MEMORY_SERVICE_SPEC.md`; document intentional deviations.

## Azure SDK Rule
- For any specific Azure SDK/API usage (types, methods, options, auth flows), verify against the latest Microsoft docs before coding.
- Do not rely on memory for exact Azure SDK details when implementation correctness depends on current official behavior.
- If guidance is uncertain or outdated, pause implementation and re-check official Microsoft documentation first.

## Delivery Standard
A task is done only when:
1. Feature behavior is implemented.
2. Relevant tests pass.
3. Docs are updated.
4. Known risks are called out.
