## Implementation process

### STEP 1: Task Analysis

- Extract and undements
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Technical notes
  - Dependencies task
- Review similar implementations in codebase
- Identify reusable patterns and components
- List potential technical challenges

### STEP 2: Development Environment Setup

- Verify required dependencies
- Set up necessary tools and configurations
- Create feature branch with correct naming
- Set up test environment if needed

### STEP 3: Confirm current context

- If Change Type is one of Enhancement, Integration, Refactoring, you must investigate current code that relate task description
  - Understand impact of change
  - Understand scope of change
  - Don't change current code if no need
- Read the file: @architecture.mermaid
  - Extract and undeboundaries and relationships
    - Data flow patterns
    - System interfaces
    - Component dependencies
  - Validate any changes against architectural constraints
  - Ensure new code maintains defined separation of concerns
- Read the file: @schema.prisma
- Read the file: @technicalnd the module's ste-structure.md

### STEP 4: Implementhis task is complex or high risk or integration-heavy, consider to perform Dependency Analysis and Planning first. You can create sub folder in `tasks/work/` to store analysis files.

1. Create skeleton:
   - Module structure following patterns
   - Interface definitions
   - Type definitions
2. Add tests structure:
   - Unit test files
   - Integration test points
   - E2E test structure
3. Implement data layer:
   - Entities/Models
   - Repositories
   - Data validation
   - Unit tests
4. Implement business logic:
   - Services with clean interfaces
   - Error handling
   - Event handling
   - Unit tests
5. Implement presentation layer:
   - Controllers/Resolvers
   - DTOs with validation
   - API documentation
   - Unit tests
6. Add end-to-end tests:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Error scenarios
   - Edge cases
7. Add documentation:
   - API documentation
   - Technical documentation
   - Update architecture diagrams

### STEP 5: Quality Checks

- Run linter and fix issues
- Run tests and ensure coverage

### STEP 6: Keep documentation updated

- Update task status
- Update relate docs
