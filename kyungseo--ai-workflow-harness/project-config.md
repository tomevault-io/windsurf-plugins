# Execution Rules

Default verification commands:

- `git diff --check`
- `bash -n scripts/create-harness.sh`
- `./scripts/create-harness.sh --dry-run --profile generic <name> <target-dir>`

MUST:

- Choose the narrowest verification command that proves the change.
- Report any command you could not run and why.
- Check the Active Work pointer in `docs/STATUS.md` and the target Work file's Verification/Checkpoints before broader validation.
- Follow any verification scope defined in the active plan or relevant backlog.
- Use `docs/backlog/HARNESS.md` for harness/workflow verification scope.
- Treat failed verification as `FAIL -> RECOVER -> PLAN`; do not proceed to checkpoint until the failure is reported and resolved or explicitly accepted.

NEVER:

- Run destructive commands without explicit approval.
- Run privileged commands.
- Assume a Java, Gradle, Docker, database, or application runtime exists in this repository.
- Use alternate build tools unless the repository explicitly requires them.

## CI Trigger Structure

- `pull_request` targeting `main` or `develop`: docs, prompts, tool rules, scaffold, and workflow changes run lightweight validation.
- `push` to `main`: same lightweight validation for release-bound changes.
- develop branch push: no CI trigger unless explicitly added later.

## Verification Commands

- `git diff --check` — whitespace and patch hygiene
- `bash -n scripts/create-harness.sh` — scaffold shell syntax
- `./scripts/create-harness.sh --dry-run --profile generic sample /tmp/sample` — generic scaffold plan check
