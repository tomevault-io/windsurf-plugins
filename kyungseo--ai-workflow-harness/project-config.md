# Safety Rules

CRITICAL: Safety rules override convenience.

NEVER run destructive or privileged commands without explicit user approval:

- `rm -rf`
- `sudo`
- `kubectl`
- `terraform`
- cloud provider CLI commands
- commands that delete data, reset history, rotate secrets, or mutate shared infrastructure

NEVER:

- Make infrastructure or environment changes unless the user explicitly asks for that exact action.
- Read or expose `.env`, secret files, credentials, full tokens, or password values unless the user explicitly approves a specific need.

MUST:

- Ask before any operation with irreversible or hard-to-reverse impact.
- Prefer read-only inspection commands when diagnosing infrastructure or environment issues.
- Explain the risk and reversal cost before proposing high-impact actions.
