# Core Coding Rules

Instruction priority:

1. `CLAUDE.md` — global principles
2. `docs/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md` — project operating rules
3. `.cursor/rules/*` — tool-specific rules

MUST:

- Read the relevant project context before editing.
- Use `docs/STATUS.md` as the dashboard pointer view for active work.
- Follow the workflow state machine: `INIT -> PLAN -> APPROVAL -> EXECUTE -> VALIDATE -> CHECKPOINT -> END`.
- Request explicit user approval before editing `docs/STATUS.md`; report the Approval Matrix state-change proposal first.
- Use `docs/BOOTSTRAP.md` only when `docs/STATUS.md` Next Actions point to scaffold bootstrap/onboarding.
- Use `docs/backlog/PRODUCT.md` for Product track candidate work (optional phasing: `PRODUCT-P{n}.md`).
- Use `docs/backlog/HARNESS.md` for harness, command/rule, and workflow hardening candidate work.
- Include scope, files, verification, risk, and reversal cost before implementation.
- Before expanding approved scope to additional files, docs, or settings, report the added scope, reason, and verification plan, then wait for approval.
- Use Work files for large tasks: `docs/works/{category}/{ID}-{lowercase-topic}.md` (spec: DR-013).
- When creating a new `docs/troubleshooting/` or `docs/retrospectives/` file, apply the DR-027 frontmatter spec defined in each directory's `README.md`.
- Treat Work files as the task SSoT and `docs/STATUS.md` as the dashboard pointer view.
- Use Quick Mode for small Product track L1 changes that do not need Work file tracking; close with final summary, validation, and commit history. Treat harness/workflow surface changes as L2.
- Do not reuse task IDs for different meanings.
- Use path-mirrored locations under `docs/archive/` only for historical detail.
- State assumptions before implementation when the task is ambiguous.
- Keep every change SURGICAL, MINIMAL, and REVERSIBLE.
- Follow the existing package structure, naming, formatting, and coding conventions.
- Remove unused imports, variables, functions, and test fixtures introduced by your own change.

NEVER:

- Add unrequested features.
- Refactor unrelated code.
- Expand approved scope silently.
- Implement before plan approval when the change is non-trivial or user-facing.
- Rewrite adjacent code only for style preference.
- Introduce a new framework, dependency, or architectural layer without explicit justification and approval.
- Load long historical documents by default when the current state file is enough.

STOP AND ASK when requirements are unclear, multiple interpretations are possible, or the safer path depends on user intent.
