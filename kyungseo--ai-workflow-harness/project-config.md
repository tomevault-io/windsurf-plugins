# Git Commit Rules

## Pre-Commit Process

If the current directory is not a git repository (bootstrap initial state), report the steps below as `Not Applicable` and proceed with document/file validation only.

Before committing, always run in this order:

1. `git status` — confirm full working tree state (unstaged + untracked)
2. `git add <files>` — stage intended files
3. `git status` — verify nothing is missed before committing
4. `git diff --cached` — review staged content

NEVER use `git diff --cached` alone as the only pre-commit check.
It does not show unstaged modifications or untracked files.

## Commit Approval

MUST:

- Commit only after validation is complete or the remaining risk is explicitly accepted.
- Before committing, follow the Approval Matrix: report validation result, diff summary, and proposed commit message, then wait for explicit user approval.
- Before committing or opening a PR, report STATUS Finalization: whether `docs/STATUS.md` update is needed, why, and the required Approval Matrix proposal if needed.
- Before committing or opening a PR, report Tracking Finalization: whether backlog/Work/DR tracker updates are needed, why, and which tracker files changed if any.
- If `docs/STATUS.md` needs to change before commit, provide the Approval Matrix state-change proposal and wait for explicit user approval before editing it. Phase/focus/recent decision changes still require a full `STATUS Update Proposal`.
- If not committing after a completed task, record the reason and remaining risk in the session summary.

## Commit Message

MUST use Conventional Commits with Bilingual Rules (per `docs/decisions/DR-007-language-policy.md`):

**Type prefix** — always in English: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `style`, `ci`, `config`, `perf`, `build`, `revert`

**Subject line** — Korean primary; English for technical terms and identifiers.

- Use Korean verbs and sentence endings.
- Keep English for proper nouns, tool names, file paths, IDs (e.g., `DR-007`, `STATUS.md`).
- Example: `docs: [Korean subject using DR-007 and Bilingual Rules identifiers]`

**Body** — Korean primary with English technical terms inline; explain *why*, not *what*.

**PR body** — same DR-007 language policy as commit messages: Korean primary + Bilingual Rules.

MUST:

- Keep the message specific to the staged or requested change.
- Avoid claiming work that is not included in the diff.

NEVER include metadata:

- `--trailer`
- `Co-authored-by`
- `Signed-off-by`

When the user asks ONLY for a commit command, output ONLY:

```bash
git commit -m "type: [Korean subject]"
```

Do not include explanations, multiple commands, or metadata in that case.
