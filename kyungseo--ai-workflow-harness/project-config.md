# Workflow Rules

This file is the Cursor adapter for workflow procedures.
Detailed procedures live in `skills/workflow/*.md`.

## Step 0

When the user's intent matches a workflow operation, first load the matching canonical file:

| Intent | Canonical procedure |
| --- | --- |
| Session start / current state summary | `skills/workflow/session-start.md` |
| Session summary / handoff | `skills/workflow/session-summary.md` |
| Select next work | `skills/workflow/work-select.md` |
| Register / add a work item | `skills/workflow/work-register.md` |
| Start / plan a specific task | `skills/workflow/work-plan.md` |
| Resume interrupted work | `skills/workflow/work-resume.md` |
| Close Work as Done | `skills/workflow/work-close.md` |
| Debug a scoped issue | `skills/workflow/work-debug.md` |
| Create strategy/comparison/position brief or classify a document | `skills/workflow/work-brief.md` |
| Run optional cross-agent review relay | `skills/workflow/cross-review.md` |
| Create presentation/report/review material | `skills/workflow/work-doc.md` |
| Repository health / cascade audit | `skills/workflow/repo-health.md` |
| Record a decision as DR | `skills/workflow/record-decision.md` |
| Merge / PR branch integration | Follow `docs/GIT-WORKFLOW.md` when present |

## Hard Stops

- If the required `skills/workflow/{command}.md` file is missing or unreadable, stop before editing files, changing state, committing, opening a PR, or merging. Report the missing canonical file and ask the user how to proceed.
- Before any file edit, state change, commit, PR creation, or merge, enforce branch isolation, the Approval Matrix, and validation-before-commit/PR gates.
- Do not duplicate detailed checklists or cascade matrices in this adapter. Use the canonical workflow file for detailed procedure.

## Entry Mechanism

Cursor has no Claude slash command file and no Codex skill directory. This rule maps natural-language intent to the canonical workflow file.

## Language Policy

- This Cursor rule is English Only.
- Korean-primary workflow details belong in `skills/workflow/*.md`, `docs/*.md`, prompts, and Claude/Codex adapters as defined by `docs/decisions/DR-007-language-policy.md`.
