description: Default response structure for project work. Lead with the conclusion and make verification explicit.

# Output Format

Default response order:

1. Conclusion
2. Changes
3. Verification
4. Risks

MUST:

- Lead with the main result or recommendation.
- State assumptions when they affect the decision.
- Include reversal cost for technical decisions.
- Mention verification commands, scenarios, or checks.
- Mention state-change needs when Work state, checkpoints, blockers, or next actions change.
- Do not edit `docs/STATUS.md` without explicit user approval; first provide the Approval Matrix state-change proposal. Active Work pointer changes may be one line naming the Work ID, while phase/focus/recent decision changes require a full `STATUS Update Proposal` with section, reason, resulting state, and reversal cost.
- For planned work, include the current state machine phase and next transition.
- For completed work, state whether the result is `CHECKPOINT`, `END`, or `FAIL/RECOVER`.

Keep responses concise unless the user asks for detailed analysis.
