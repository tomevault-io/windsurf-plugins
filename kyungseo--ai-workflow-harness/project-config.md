# Debugging Rules

MUST follow this sequence:

1. Reproduce or clearly describe the failing condition.
2. Narrow the cause using actual code, logs, stack traces, tests, or runtime output.
3. Fix the ROOT CAUSE with the smallest reasonable change.
4. Re-run the same scenario or test that exposed the issue.

MUST NOT:

- Guess the cause without evidence.
- Mask a failure by weakening assertions, deleting tests, or broadening exception handling.
- Change unrelated behavior while debugging.

When a test fails, explain:

- The failing scenario.
- The most likely root cause.
- The verification command or scenario used after the fix.

When a non-trivial issue is fully resolved (environment mismatch, hidden constraint, non-obvious root cause, tool version incompatibility), record it in `docs/troubleshooting/` using the symptom → cause → action format. Apply the DR-027 frontmatter spec (symptom/track/category/environment/status/related_dr). Link from `docs/HARNESS-MAINTAINER-GUIDE.md` if the issue affects local setup.
