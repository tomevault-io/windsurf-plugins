# Coding guide

## Rules that must be followed

### Applying the formatter

After modifying code, always apply the formatter.

The execution command is as follows.

```bash
dart format path/to/your/file.dart
```

### Applying Linter automatic fixes

After modifying code, always apply Linter automatic fixes.

The execution command is as follows.

```bash
dart fix --apply
```

### Resolving Linter warnings

After modifying code, always check for Linter and compiler warnings.
If warnings occur, resolve them.

### Check that tests are passing and make corrections

When modifying code, always run unit tests and make sure all tests pass.

### Adding unit tests

When you make code modifications, consider whether there is room to add unit tests.
If you can add unit tests, be sure to add them.

### Refactoring

When you make code modifications, consider whether there is room to refactor.
If you can refactor, be sure to refactor.

### Delete unnecessary code

If you have modified the code, check to see if any unnecessary code remains.
If any unnecessary code remains, delete it immediately.

### Appropriate use of SDK functions, etc.

When using new SDK functions that have not been used in the code base until now, check the following.

- Check the official documentation to make sure the usage is simple. If the usage is complicated, revise it to a simpler usage.

# Architecture

This project is an iOS and Android application, including front-end and back-end code.

## Client app

`client/` is where you put the code for the iOS and Android client app written in Flutter.

- [`./android/`](/client/android/): Product code and project settings for Android
- [`./ios/`](/client/ios/): Product code and project settings for iOS
- [`./lib/`](/client/lib/): Product code common to all OS
  - [`./data/`](/client/lib/data/): Information storage and retrieval, and interaction with the OS layer
  - [`./definition/`](/client/lib/data/definition/): Common definitions used for information storage and retrieval, and interaction with the OS layer
  - [`./model/`](/client/lib/data/model/): Domain model. Place pure data structures that are not dependent on the UI, and UI-independent `Exception`, `Error`, etc.
  - [`./repository/`](/client/lib/data/repository/): Repository. Defines the process of retaining and retrieving information while abstracting the specific destination.
  - [`./service/`](/client/lib/data/service/): Service. Defines the connection to the OS and Firebase.
- [`./ui/`](/client/lib/ui/): Defines screen drawing and display logic.
  - [`./component/`](/client/lib/ui/component/): Defines UI components shared between screens.
  - [`./feature/`](/client/lib/ui/feature/): Screens and screen logic. There are subfolders for each category.
- [`./test/`](/client/test/): Unit tests, widget tests

In this app, Swift Package Manager (SPM) is enabled and used in conjunction with CocoaPods.

SPM is enabled in Flutter itself with the following command:

```bash
flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager
```

Since SPM is a beta feature, problems may occur during builds, etc.

In that case, troubleshoot by investigating any reported issues in Flutter or considering the possibility of an unknown problem.

## Infrastructure

`infra/` is where you put the infrastructure configuration and back-end code.

# Development guide

## General rules

### Style

Always use early returns to reduce nesting.

Use `try`-`catch` statements to enclose only processes that may throw, and in the smallest possible scope.

Example:

```dart
// Define the return value of a process that may throw an exception even outside the scope of try-catch, so that it is used first.
final CustomerInfo customerInfo;
try {
// Process that may throw an exception
  customerInfo = await Purchases.purchasePackage(product.package);
} catch (e) {
  throw PurchaseException();
}

// Subsequent process
return customerInfo.entitlements;
```

If you do not use a function argument, explicitly indicate that it is unused by naming it `_`.

Example:

```dart
onTap: (_) { // If you do not use an argument, explicitly state that it is unused as "_"
// ...
},
```

Immediately delete unused code.

### Maintain code consistency

Implement processes with similar functions in the same flow. Check whether a similar process has already been implemented in the surrounding area, and follow it if it has been implemented.

- In particular, standardize the flow of data acquisition, conversion, and filtering.

### Maintain sufficient comments

If you add code comments, finally check their sufficiency from the following perspective. If they are excessive or insufficient, delete or add them.

- Add comments only when necessary to clarify the intent or purpose of the code. Avoid comments if the content of the code is clear.
- Describe in detail any particularly important points to note or pitfalls, including the reasons for them.
- Comments should be written in Japanese.

### Maintain readability of naming

Name variables to clearly indicate their purpose and content.

Use meaningful names even for temporary variables.

Use consistent naming patterns for variables that handle the same type of data.
