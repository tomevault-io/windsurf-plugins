# AGENTS.md

Operational guide for coding agents working on Soliloquy.

## Project Overview

Soliloquy is a privacy-focused, local-first personal notes app presented as a
messenger. It has no account or backend: chats and messages live in the
browser's IndexedDB database. The current product supports chat and message
management, pinned content, drag-and-drop ordering, chat icon/color
personalization, Markdown rendering, single-chat JSON/Markdown transfer, full
workspace backup/restore, and a multi-page Settings modal.

Stack: Astro 5, React 19, strict TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Radix-based UI
primitives, Dexie 4 with `dexie-react-hooks`, dnd-kit, lucide-react,
react-markdown/remark-gfm, and Biome. Use Bun; `bun.lock` is authoritative.

## Commands

Only these package scripts are available:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run preview
bun run astro
bun run format
bun run lint
bun run check
```

There is no `test` or `typecheck` script. Run focused tests with Bun, for
example `bun test src/lib/utils/sidebar-chats/sidebarChats.test.ts`, and use
`bunx tsc --noEmit` for a manual type check when needed.

Focused tests are colocated with their utility, service transform, or feature
helper as `*.test.ts`; there is no global test directory or DOM test harness.

## Architecture And Style

- `src/pages/index.astro` mounts `MessengerLayout` with `client:only='react'`.
  The layout owns the active chat; `Sidebar` coordinates sidebar dialogs,
  toasts, workspace restore flow, and `SidebarSettings`.
- Keep orchestration components responsible for state and service callbacks.
  Keep page/row components presentational and feature-local when they are not
  reused elsewhere. `SidebarSettings` owns modal/page state; its Data page owns
  file inputs.
- Do not split a component mechanically by line count. Split when it mixes
  independent UI sections, dialog logic, transformations, or business state;
  orchestration components may remain larger when they only coordinate focused
  children and callbacks.
- Keep `useChatWindow.ts` and `useSidebar.ts` as thin composition facades.
  Put focused responsibilities under `hooks/chat/` and `hooks/sidebar/`.
- Components and hooks must call services, never `db` directly. Dexie queries,
  transactions, schema versions, and migrations belong in `src/lib/db/` or
  `src/lib/services/`.
- `importExportService` coordinates browser files and database writes.
  `services/import-export/` owns pure format parsing/serialization. Keep
  single-chat transfer distinct from workspace backup/restore.
- Release notes are manual Markdown files in `src/content/changelog/`. Each
  entry requires `version`, `date`, and `title` frontmatter, is loaded at build
  time, and describes user-facing results rather than raw commits. Keep the
  release entry synchronized with the package version; do not generate notes
  from Git history automatically.
- The database has `chats` and `messages` tables. The seeded `Soliloquy Info`
  chat is a read-only system chat. Its visibility preference is stored in
  `localStorage` and applied only to the sidebar view.
- Use `$lib/*` aliases outside a local feature and relative imports inside a
  feature. Use tabs, single quotes, no semicolons, TypeScript interfaces for
  component props, and `cn` from `$lib/utils` for conditional classes.
- Reuse existing UI primitives and Lucide icons. Preserve keyboard behavior,
  visible focus states, labels, dialog semantics, and accessible names.

```tsx
interface ExampleRowProps {
	title: string
	onClick: () => void
}

export function ExampleRow({ title, onClick }: ExampleRowProps) {
	return <Button variant='ghost' onClick={onClick}>{title}</Button>
}
```

## Testing And Verification

- Add focused tests for pure transforms, validation, and boundary logic when
  practical. Unit and component tests live beside the implementation they
  exercise.
- When a production file has its own test, place both in a feature-local
  directory. Do not leave many production/test pairs mixed in one broad
  directory. Do not create a directory for a simple untested file unless it
  also has closely related local files. Integration and end-to-end tests may
