# Razorpay Tool Generator

This rule generates tool implementations for the Razorpay MCP server based on API documentation.

## Required Format

This rule requires:

1. A Razorpay API documentation URL starting with `https://razorpay.com/docs/api/`
2. The SDK function signature that the tool will call

Example of valid invocation:
```
@new-tool-from-docs.mdc DOC_LINK: @https://razorpay.com/docs/api/payment-links/create-standard/
SDK_FUNCTION:
func (pl *PaymentLink) Create(data map[string]interface{}, extraHeaders map[string]string) (map[string]interface{}, error) {
    url := fmt.Sprintf("/%s%s", constants.VERSION_V1, constants.PaymentLink_URL)
    return pl.Request.Post(url, data, extraHeaders)
}
```

IMPORTANT: If the DOC_LINK or SDK_FUNCTION are missing or in an incorrect format, REFUSE to proceed further.

## Implementation Checklist

This checklist **MUST** be included in the final response to verify all implementation steps are complete.
IMPORTANT: Include this unchecked checklist at the END of the implementation, NOT at the beginning.

- [ ] Implement tool function based on API docs
- [ ] Register tool in tools.go
- [ ] Create unit tests with full coverage (positive case, all negative cases, edge cases)
- [ ] Update the "Available Tools" section in the main README.md. Make sure the new additions are correctly formatted.
- [ ] Double check that we are not repeating any of the Common Issues mentioned below.
- [ ] Run linter and fix errors if any (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Run tests and fix errors if any (REQUIRED)

COMPLETION CRITERIA:
1. The task is considered accomplished only if the checklist and summary are posted.
2. Once the task is completed you should stop and give control to the user. You SHOULD NOT infer additional tools to implement.

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED ⚠️

Upon receiving this rule invocation:

1. **DO NOT** ask for user input or confirmation before implementing code
2. **DO** use the `edit_file` tool to create/modify the following files:
   - Primary implementation: `pkg/razorpay/{resource_type}.go`
   - Test implementation: `pkg/razorpay/{resource_type}_test.go`
   - Update toolset registration: `pkg/razorpay/tools.go`
   - Update the README.md

## Implementation

Before the implementation use the documentation URL provided to figure out the request contract, required parameters, descriptions of the parameters, and the response contract.

Now follow the detailed implementation guide in [pkg/razorpay/README.md](mdc:../pkg/razorpay/README.md) for creating tools and start making code changes.

Other guidelines:
1. [Razorpay Go SDK Constants](mdc:https:/github.com/razorpay/razorpay-go/blob/master/constants/url.go) - Use these constants for specifying the api endpoints while writing the tests.
2. Use the payload and response from the docs provided to write the positive test case for the tool.

STYLE:
Look at the linters and linter settings in the .golangci.yaml file and make sure to follow the same style while coding.

IMPORTANT: You **MUST** ALWAYS go through the Post Implementation steps once the code changes are done.

## Implementation References

For detailed code patterns and examples, refer to the following sections in the [pkg/razorpay/README.md](mdc:../pkg/razorpay/README.md):

- **Tool Structure**: See the "Tool Structure" section for the function template
- **Parameter Definition**: See the "Parameter Definition" section for defining parameters
- **Parameter Validation**: See the "Parameter Validation" section for validation examples
- **Example GET/POST Endpoints**: See the example sections for complete implementation patterns
- **Unit Testing**: See the "Writing Unit Tests" section for test patterns and best practices

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Troubleshooting ⚠️

### 1. Query Parameters in Mock Tests

The `mock.Endpoint` struct does NOT have a queryParams field:

```go
type Endpoint struct {
    Path     string
    Method   string
    Response interface{}
}
```

### 1. Query Parameter Limitations in Mock Tests

The mock server doesn't validate query parameters. When testing endpoints with query parameters:

```go
// DOESN'T WORK - Gorilla Mux treats this as a literal path ❌
mock.Endpoint{
    Path:     apiPath + "?count=2&from=123&skip=1",
    Method:   "GET",
    Response: successResponse,
}

// WORKS - Use only the base path ✅
mock.Endpoint{
    Path:     apiPath,  // Only the base path without query parameters
    Method:   "GET",
    Response: successResponse,
}
```

### 2. Line Length Linter Errors

When encountering line length errors ("The line is X characters long, which exceeds the maximum of Y characters"):

1. Option 1: Add `//nolint:lll` comment at the end of the line:
```go
return mcpgo.NewTool(
    "tool_name",
    "This is a very long description that exceeds the line length limit", //nolint:lll
    parameters,
    handler,
)
```

2. Option 2: Break the string into multiple concatenated lines:
```go
return mcpgo.NewTool(
    "tool_name",
    "This is a very long description " +
        "that exceeds the line length limit",
    parameters,
    handler,
)
```

3. Option 3: For comments, split into multiple comment lines:
```go
// This is a very long comment that would exceed the line length limit
