# CLAUDE.md

See **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — the conventions and invariants for this
repository live there, in one file, so the two cannot drift apart.

Read it before changing code. The parts most often broken by accident:

- `core` must name no feature (`grep -ri dog_image lib/core` returns nothing)
- `dart analyze` must report **zero issues**, not merely zero errors
- Nothing generated is committed, and `env.g.dart` is never hand-edited
- `integration_test/` stays at the repo root, never inside `test/`
- Credentials never reach a log

Verify with `make analyze && make test` before reporting work as done.
