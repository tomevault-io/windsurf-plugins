# TypeScript changes: run tsgo and eslint

After making changes to TypeScript files (`.ts`), always run these checks from the project root:

1. **Type checker**
   ```bash
   npx tsgo
   ```

2. **Linter**
   ```bash
   npx eslint ./
   ```

- Run both from the project root.
- If either reports errors, fix them before considering the task done.
- Do not skip these steps when you have edited or created any `.ts` file.
