description: Flutter UI polish standards for app screens, including spacing, radius, contrast, and dark mode behavior

# Flutter UI Polish

- Reuse `app/lib/ui/app_ui.dart` tokens and themed components before adding local styles.
- Prefer semantic colors from theme or `AppColorTheme`; avoid page-local gray palettes and hardcoded CTA colors.
- Keep spacing on the shared scale `4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32` and reuse shared radii `12 / 16 / 20`.
- Forms and dense content areas should use width constraints and clear surface grouping.
- Treat dark mode as a first-class state. Re-check colors in both light and dark themes after any visual change.
- Do not reuse page-level muted text inside colored bubbles, badges, or tinted cards without checking contrast.
- For colored surfaces, maintain separate foreground levels: primary text, secondary/meta text, subtle timestamps, and accent/status colors.
- If an accent color sits on a dark bubble, lift or blend it so progress labels, retry actions, and status hints remain readable.
- Before finishing a Flutter UI change, verify loading, error, disabled, and selected states still read clearly.
