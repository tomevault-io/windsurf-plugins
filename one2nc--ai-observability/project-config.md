## Project Goal

Benchmark AI observability by instrumenting applications with different OTel-based setups. Each experiment answers: "what can I see, what can't I see, and what failure modes can I catch?"

The output is a comparison matrix showing the tradeoffs between auto-instrumentation, manual instrumentation, and AI gateways — grounded in real traces, metrics, and logs.

## Project Structure

## Experiment Structure

Each experiment is standalone and self-contained. Language, framework, and internal file layout are up to the experiment. The contract is the interface:

### Required files

- `docker-compose.yml` — App container(s)
- `Dockerfile` — Build instructions
- `.env.example` — Required env vars (no defaults for critical config)
- `Makefile` — Must provide at minimum: `make up`, `make down`, `make ask`
- `README.md` — Must include:
  - Flow diagram (mermaid)
  - Example traces with span breakdown table (columns: #, Span, Parent, Duration, Source, What it tells you, Sample attributes)
  - Span attributes (auto + manual) with examples
  - Metrics dashboard section with per-panel table (columns: Panel, Metric, PromQL, What it tells you)
  - Metric dimensions appendix (list all dimensions per metric with examples)
  - Failure modes table (columns: #, Failure mode, Why?, How?, Where?, What?)
  - Usage instructions
- Dashboard JSON — Importable dashboard for the configured sink. Every metric documented in the README must have a corresponding panel.

### Internal structure

Up to the experiment. Python with FastAPI, Go with net/http, a shell script — whatever demonstrates the instrumentation clearly.

## Key Principles

1. **Apps don't know about sinks.** Every experiment sends OTLP to `host.docker.internal:4418` (the gateway). The gateway routes to whatever sink is configured.

2. **Sinks are swappable.** Add a new sink in `infra/sinks/<name>/`. Update the gateway config. No app changes.

3. **Each experiment is shareable standalone.** You can zip up any experiment folder and hand it to someone without them needing the rest of the repo.

4. **Fail fast on missing config.** All required env vars must be checked at startup. No hidden defaults.

## Adding a New Experiment

1. Create `experiments/<name>/`
2. Implement the application with instrumentation
3. Add `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `Makefile`
4. Write `README.md` following the structure above
5. Create a dashboard JSON with panels for all documented metrics
6. Test: `make up`, `make ask`, verify data in sink

## Adding a New Sink

1. Create `infra/sinks/<name>/docker-compose.yml`
2. Update `infra/otel-collector-gateway/config.yaml` exporters
3. Update `infra/Makefile` with `ifeq ($(SINK),<name>)` blocks
4. Document in `infra/README.md`

## Goals Per Experiment

Each experiment should answer:
- What traces/metrics/logs are emitted?
- What failure modes can be detected?
- What's the effort required (zero-code vs manual)?
- What's NOT visible (gaps)?
- What personas benefit from this setup?

## Development Rules

1. **Test before committing.** All setups must be verified working (app starts, traces/metrics/logs arrive in sink) before any commit.
2. **No git commits without user approval.** Stage changes, show status, wait for explicit go-ahead.
3. **Dockerized by default.** Always prefer containerized setups to prevent "works on my machine" issues. Apps run in Docker, infra runs in Docker.
4. **No hidden defaults for critical config.** Env vars must be explicitly set — fail fast if missing.
5. **No `-d` (detached mode)** for app containers or infra `make up`. Logs should stream to console for visibility.
6. **Don't assume sinks.** Apps send to the OTel collector gateway. Never hardcode SigNoz/Jaeger/etc. in app code or env examples.
7. **Keep experiments independent.** Each experiment folder must work standalone without importing from `base/` or other experiments.
8. **Visualize metrics, don't just list them.** Create importable dashboards for the configured sink. Every metric documented in the README must have a corresponding dashboard panel.
