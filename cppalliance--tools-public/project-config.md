## Structure

- When any tool is added, moved, or removed, update README.md to reflect the change.
- Tools live in `tools/` or in sibling groups (`tools-wg21/`) and subdirectory groups (`tools/code/`, `tools/voice/`). Retired tools live in the group's `retired/` subdirectory (e.g., `tools-wg21/retired/`), and their README entry moves to the matching Retired section rather than being deleted.
- A tool is only installable once it is listed in `install.sh`, by its path relative to the repo root. Moving or renaming a tool means updating that list and its README link in the same commit.
- `install.sh` is the single source of truth for what ships. After changing `TOP_LEVEL`, `FAMILIES`, or `SKILLS`, run `./scripts/sync_plugin_manifest.py` to regenerate `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and commit it. Never hand-edit the `commands` or `skills` arrays in that file.
- Before committing a change to any of those lists, verify both: `./scripts/sync_plugin_manifest.py --check` catches a manifest that has fallen behind `install.sh`, and `claude plugin validate . --strict` catches an entry pointing at a file that is not in the tree. There is no CI, so this check is yours to run.
- Dossiers live in `dossiers/`. These are composite behavioral models - aggregate profiles of populations, not individuals.
- Every directory that contains tools or dossiers also contains an `images/` subdirectory for their paired images.
- Every `.md` file pairs with `images/<name>.png` in the same directory group. The image filename always matches the `.md` filename (minus extension).
- Directory-style tools (e.g., `voice/voice.md`) key on the parent directory name: `voice/` pairs with `images/voice.png`. Sub-tools inside a directory may have their own images in the same `images/`.
- Skills are directories holding a `SKILL.md` plus the scripts it calls. A skill is registered by adding its directory to the `SKILLS` array in `install.sh`, and installs to `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.cursor/skills/` rather than `~/.claude/commands/`. Unlike a command, the whole directory ships, so anything the prompt calls must live inside it.

## Image invariant

The image travels with its file. On create, move, rename, delete, or retire - both files move together, never one without the other. Images always live in `images/` within the file's directory group, never loose alongside the `.md` files.

The `<img src>` in every tool or dossier is a relative path to `images/<name>.png`. Never an absolute URL. Never a bare filename without `images/`.

If the paired image is missing, stop and ask. Do not proceed with a lone file.
