# mcp-cpp Agent And Skill Enforcement

- Read `agents.md` and `SKILLS.MD` at session start and before each materially new task.
- Select every matching skill from `SKILLS.MD` before proposing or running commands.
- Use Docker only. Windows commands go through `wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash -lc "..."`.
- Do not use bind mounts, named volumes, `docker cp`, `-o type=local`, or any Docker pattern that writes back to
  the host.
- Use sequential verification for auth, remotes, repo creation, commits, and pushes. Never parallelize a
  state-changing command with its verification command.
- Treat every failure as blocking, even if it looks unrelated to the active request. Fix it immediately, rerun the
  failed gate, and only then continue.
- If a task truly requires host writes, host IPC, or host network access, stop and ask the human first.
