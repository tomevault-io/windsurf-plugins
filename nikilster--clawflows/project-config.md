# ClawFlows

Bash CLI for OpenClaw workflow automation. Users enable pre-built or custom workflows that their AI agent can run on-demand or on a schedule.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Symlink-Based Activation
- `enable` creates symlink: `enabled/name → available/community/name` or `available/custom/name`
- `disable` removes symlink only (never deletes files)
- Custom workflows override community by name

### What's Gitignored
- `workflows/enabled/*` — user's active workflows
- `workflows/available/custom/*` — user's custom workflows
- `system/runs/` — execution history

### AGENTS.md Sync (Critical!)
CLI maintains a block in `~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md` between markers:
```
<!-- clawflows:start -->
...auto-generated workflow list...
<!-- clawflows:end -->
```
Called automatically on enable/disable/create/update. Manual refresh: `clawflows sync-agent`.

**The agent only knows what's in AGENTS.md.** Whenever you change the system:
- New CLI command → Add to `_build_block()` CLI Commands section
- New capability/feature → Add a new section in `_build_block()`
- Change how something works → Update the relevant section in `_build_block()`

The `_build_block()` function (around line 608) generates what the agent sees. If it's not there, the agent won't know about it.

## Every Change Checklist

Every change—no matter how small—requires all three:

1. **Update the agent instructions** — If the change affects CLI behavior, commands, or install flow, update `system/AGENT.md` (the agent install/reference guide) and `_build_block()` in the CLI (the auto-synced AGENTS.md content). The agent only knows what these files tell it.
2. **Write tests** — Add or update BATS tests in `tests/`. See the Testing section below for conventions. Use the existing `test_helper.bash` helpers. Every new command, flag, or behavior change needs test coverage.
3. **Update `docs/updates.md`** — Add a fun, personality-filled entry about what changed. Write it like Dave the Happy Minion would—enthusiastic, playful, with banana references welcome. Keep it short (1-3 lines per entry).

## Code Conventions

### Function Naming
```bash
cmd_enable()        # CLI command handlers (public)
cmd_backup()
_find_workflow()    # Helper functions (private, underscore prefix)
_build_block()
die()               # Utilities
get_field()
```

### Error Handling
```bash
die() { echo "error: $1" >&2; exit 1; }

# Usage
[ -n "$name" ] || die "workflow '$name' not found"
```

### Adding a New Command
1. Create `cmd_newcommand()` function
2. Add case in main router at bottom of file:
   ```bash
   case "$1" in
     ...
     newcommand) cmd_newcommand "${2:-}" ;;
     ...
   esac
   ```
3. Add to `cmd_help()` text
4. **IMPORTANT: Update `_build_block()`** — Add to CLI Commands section so the agent learns about it via AGENTS.md sync

### Workflow Lookup
Always use `_find_workflow()` — checks custom/ before community/:
```bash
source_dir="$(_find_workflow "$name")"
[ -n "$source_dir" ] || die "workflow '$name' not found"
```

## Gotchas & Things to Avoid

### Bash Compatibility
- **No associative arrays** — macOS ships bash 3.2
- Use `|| true` for arithmetic that might be zero: `((count++)) || true`

### JSON Parsing
No external parser. Uses grep/sed with `|| true` for optional fields:
```bash
name="$(echo "$json" | grep -o '"name"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' | sed 's/.*:.*"\([^"]*\)"/\1/' | head -1 || true)"
```

### Symlink Resolution
CLI must work when symlinked to `~/.local/bin/clawflows`:
```bash
SELF="$0"
if [ -L "$SELF" ]; then
  SELF="$(readlink "$SELF")"
fi
CLAWFLOWS_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$SELF")/../.." && pwd)"
```

### Never Do
- Modify `workflows/available/community/` directly (gets overwritten on update)
- Use bash 4+ features (associative arrays, `${var,,}` lowercasing)
- Delete files via symlink path (delete the symlink itself)
- Skip `cmd_sync` (agent-sync) after enable/disable/create

## Workflow Format

```yaml
---
name: workflow-name
emoji: 📅
description: One-line summary
schedule: "7am, 5pm"        # Optional, omit for on-demand
author: @handle             # Optional
---

# Workflow Title

Instructions for the agent...
```

Extract fields with:
```bash
emoji="$(get_field "$wf_file" emoji)"
schedule="$(get_field "$wf_file" schedule)"
```

## Testing

Tests use [BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) (Bash Automated Testing System). BATS libraries are vendored in `tests/bats/`.

```bash
# Run all tests
./tests/bats/bats-core/bin/bats tests/core/

# Run a specific test file
