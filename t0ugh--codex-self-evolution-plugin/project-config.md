# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a Python 3.11+ package using a `src/` layout. Core code lives in `src/codex_self_evolution/`: `cli.py` and `csep.py` expose command-line entry points, `hooks/` handles Codex lifecycle hooks, `session_recall/` archives and searches historical sessions, `session_reflection/` handles background memory/skill review, and `plugin_bundle/` packages the Codex plugin. Generated plugin skills are mirrored under both `skills/` and `plugins/codex-self-evolution/skills/`. Tests live in `tests/`. Documentation and implementation notes live in `docs/`. README images are kept under `docs/assets/`. Plugin manifests are present in both `src/codex_self_evolution/plugin_bundle/.codex-plugin/` and `plugins/codex-self-evolution/.codex-plugin/`; keep them aligned when changing hook metadata.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `python -m pip install -e .` installs the package locally with `codex-self-evolution` and `csep` console scripts.
- `python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'` adds contributor tooling such as `pytest`, `build`, and `twine`.
- `python -m pytest -q` runs the full test suite; CI runs this on Python 3.11 and 3.12.
- `make test PYTHON=python3.11` runs the same pytest command through the Makefile.
- `python -m build` builds source and wheel distributions.
- `scripts/install.sh` installs the local CLI with `uv` and refreshes the Codex plugin cache.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use 4-space indentation, type hints where they clarify interfaces, and small stdlib-first modules. Runtime dependencies are intentionally empty; adding one requires updating `pyproject.toml` and README wording. Use snake_case for modules, functions, variables, and test names. Keep CLI output deterministic and machine-readable where existing commands already do so.

## Testing Guidelines

Use pytest. Name tests `test_*.py` and test functions `test_*`. Add focused coverage beside the behavior being changed, especially for storage state transitions, hook payload handling, CLI flags, session recall behavior, session reflection validation, and diagnostics/status output. Provider smoke tests require real credentials and are not part of public CI.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history uses concise Conventional-style subjects such as `docs: add supported artifacts visual` and `docs: record local enablement status`. Prefer `area: imperative summary`, keep commits scoped, and include tests or docs with behavior changes. PRs should describe the user-visible change, list verification commands, link issues when available, and include screenshots only for README or diagram updates.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Never commit provider secrets. Copy `.env.provider.example` to `~/.codex-self-evolution/.env.provider` for local use. The repository `data/` directory is local runtime state; keep only `data/.gitkeep` tracked.
