description: Require HARNESS §0.3 checkpoint format with manual validation steps in every story completion

# specwiki — Story completion checkpoint (HARNESS §0.3)

When finishing a **code-changing** story or task, or when the owner explicitly requests a quality-gate run, end the user-facing message with the full HARNESS §0.3 checkpoint — not a shortened summary.

Do not run the quality gate, automated code review, QA analysis, or return a §0.3 checkpoint for non-code prompts or non-executable metadata changes. This includes questions, discovery, and updates such as Markdown documentation or sprint-status YAML. Respond with a concise result instead.

## Required sections (in order)

1. **What was built** — 2–4 bullets
2. **Tests written** — list new/changed test cases
3. **Logging (§0.8)** — checklist with `[x]` or `[ ]`
4. **Security (§0.9)** — checklist with `[x]` or `[ ]`
5. **Quality gate** — all six commands with pass/fail and counts
6. **Automated code review (§0.2.5)** — reviewer model + findings table (or "skipped" with reason)
7. **QA analysis (§0.2.6)** — AC coverage, regression risks, gaps
8. **Manual validation steps** — **MANDATORY; never omit**
9. **IMPLEMENTATION.md updated** — yes/no
10. **Implement review patches?** — ask owner before commit

## Manual validation steps — non-negotiable

After the quality gate section, **always** include a `### Manual validation steps` block with numbered, copy-pasteable commands and expected outcomes.

Sources (use in order):
1. Story file `## QA Manual Validation` section (if present)
2. Story `**Demo path:**` in Dev Notes
3. Generate steps from HARNESS §0.2.6 template tailored to the task

Each step must be: `N. \`command\` — expected outcome`

Do **not** bury manual steps only in the story file. The owner must see them in the chat response.

## Common specwiki commands

```bash
npm test
npm test -- tests/output/wiki.test.ts -t "pattern"
npm run dev generate -- --project tests/fixtures/sample-project --output /tmp/specwiki-qa
npm run dev generate -- --project tests/fixtures/sample-project --verbose 2>&1 | head
npm run dev open -- --project tests/fixtures/sample-project --output /tmp/specwiki-qa
```
