## What This MCP Does

SEO Research MCP provides four SEO research tools powered by Ahrefs data:

| Tool | What to Ask | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `get_backlinks_list` | Backlink analysis for any domain | "Show me backlinks for competitor.com" |
| `keyword_generator` | Keyword ideas from seed keywords | "Find keywords related to 'react hooks'" |
| `get_traffic` | Traffic estimates for websites | "What's the traffic for github.com?" |
| `keyword_difficulty` | How hard a keyword is to rank for | "Check difficulty for 'best laptop 2025'" |

## How to Use These Tools

Once configured, simply ask naturally:

```
"Analyze backlinks for example.com"
"Generate keyword ideas for 'python tutorial'"
"Show traffic data for shopify.com"
"What's the keyword difficulty for 'ai tools'?"
```

### Tool Parameters

- `domain_or_url`: Website or specific URL
- `country`: Filter by country (default: all countries)
- `mode`: "subdomains" (include all) or "exact" (just this URL)

**keyword_difficulty(keyword, country?)**
