# HAR Harness Workflow

This repository uses a `.har/` agent harness. Follow this on every change.

The harness is **how you run the project**, not only how you verify it. Launch a
slot for live apps, browsers, and screenshots — never hand-roll docker/dev-server
startup. If a harness command fails, fix the harness or surface the failure.

## Before making changes

1. On the **main checkout**, switch to the intended base (usually `main`) — launch
   creates a worktree from that HEAD.
2. **Launch first** — MCP `har_launch_environment` / `har env launch 1`. Use the
   returned **work dir** for ALL edits (never the main checkout). Path looks like
   `~/worktrees/<base>-<sha4>-har-agent-<id>-<rand4>` (see `.har/slots/agent-<id>.json`).
   **Bind tracker work** when the task names an issue or ticket — short `--work-id`
   (e.g. `widget-123`) plus `--work-source` / `--work-url` / `--work-title`. Skip for ad-hoc work.
3. Read `AGENTS.md`, `.har/README.md`, `.har/stages.json`, then
   `.har/CLAUDE.agent.md` (slot URLs / definition of done).
4. Hot-reload usually applies; if not, `./.har/agent-cli.sh <id> restart` (no-op on
   cli/ios profiles without managed processes).

**Occupied slots always block.** Run `complete` / `teardown`, then `launch`. Resume
failed/starting launches with `--resume` / `recover`. Prefer a free slot (2+) over
sharing slot 1 across unrelated chats. Check `har_get_status` / `har env status`
first. Commit early — teardown keeps the branch, not uncommitted work. Gitignored
paths are ephemeral. With telemetry on, Mission Control derives session purpose from
the first captured user prompt.

## Harnesses in this repo

Pick the harness that owns the files you are changing. See `AGENTS.md`.

| Path | Runs | Use when changing |
|------|------|-------------------|
| `.har/` | `@osfactory/har` (typecheck, build, unit tests, lint) | `src/`, `packages/`, `tests/` |
| `control/.har/` | Mission Control (Next.js + SQLite, browser-e2e) | `control/` |
| `docs/.har/` | Docs / marketing site (Astro + Playwright screenshots) | `docs/` |

Run harness commands from the directory that owns the harness (e.g. `cd docs`).

## After making changes

Prefer MCP → CLI → shell. Quick verify for the loop; **full verify before done**.

- MCP: `har_run_verification` / `full: true`; finish with `har_complete_environment`
  (propose; wait for approval) or `har_teardown_environment`
- CLI: `har env verify 1`, `har env verify 1 --full`, `complete 1`, `teardown 1`
- Shell: `./.har/verify.sh 1`, `./.har/verify.sh 1 --full`, `./.har/teardown.sh 1`

Commit in the session worktree. Run JSON stays in the main checkout `.har/runs/`.
UI changes with Playwright: update specs under `tests/` (full verify includes browser-e2e).

## Definition of done

- Full verify passes; edits only in the session worktree; tests cover new behavior;
  changes committed; show preview URLs; then **session handoff** (below).

## Session handoff (required)

After full verify and commit, stop. Include summary, session branch
(`.har/slots/agent-<id>.json`), and preview URLs. Wait — never autonomously
complete, teardown, push, or open a PR. **Default (1 is the default):** when
`gh`/GitHub MCP is available, recommend **Complete + open a PR** — push → open
PR → `har env complete` / `har_complete_environment` (branch kept). Still needs
approval. Alternatives: **Complete only**, or **Something else**. Without PR
tooling, recommend **Complete only** and give the session branch for a manual push.

## Commit gate

Full verify records a tree hash under `.har/validations/`. With `har hooks install`,
commits must match a passing full verify. Re-verify after any edit; `git add -A`.
Do not bypass (`--no-verify`, `HAR_SKIP_GATE=1`).
