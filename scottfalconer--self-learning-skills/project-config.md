# Agent Instructions

## Skills
Skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.

Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime "## Skills" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.

Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.

Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.

How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.

Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.

Coordination and sequencing:
- If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
- Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.

Context hygiene:
- Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
- Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.
- When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.

Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.

## Self-learning policy (sidecar skill)

### Before starting work
- If present, skim `.agent-skills/self-learning/v1/users/<user>/INDEX.md` (or `aha_cards.jsonl`) for relevant Aha Cards.

### After finishing work
- Run the `self-learning-skills` skill to capture:
  - Aha Cards (durable, reusable learnings)
  - Recommendations (what to change to make next time faster/cleaner)
