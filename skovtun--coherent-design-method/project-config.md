# Safe File Transforms

When modifying fix.ts or adding new file transformations:

- Use `safeWrite()` from `./fix-validation.js` instead of `writeFileSync` for all TSX/TS file writes
- `safeWrite` validates TSX syntax after writing and rolls back on failure
- Track modified files in `modifiedFiles` array for post-transform verification
- Never add empty `catch {}` blocks — always log with `chalk.yellow`
- Prefer full component regeneration over regex-based patching
