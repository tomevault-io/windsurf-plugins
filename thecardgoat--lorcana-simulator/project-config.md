      TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL

      MANDATORY TDD WORKFLOW:

      1. **ALWAYS START WITH TESTS**:
         - Plan and write tests BEFORE writing implementation code
         - Create tests for every new feature, bug fix, or change
         - Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle

      2. **ATOMIC TEST STEPS**:
         - Write ONE test at a time
         - Keep each test focused on a single behavior
         - Do not write long test suites all at once
         - Stop after each atomic test step

      3. **USER VERIFICATION REQUIRED**:
         - After writing each test, wait for user verification
         - Let user review and approve test before proceeding
         - Only continue to implementation after test approval
         - User must confirm each step before moving forward

      4. **COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS**:
         - Aim for full or near-full test coverage
         - Cover edge cases and error scenarios
         - Test both positive and negative paths
         - Document any untested code with clear reasoning

      5. **FRAMEWORK DEPENDENCY**:
         - Use testing frameworks specified by user
         - Follow user's testing patterns and conventions
         - Ask user to specify testing approach if unclear
         - Adapt to existing test structure in codebase

      6. **INCREMENTAL APPROACH**:
         - Small, verifiable steps only
         - No large code blocks without tests
         - Each implementation should make tests pass
         - Refactor only after tests are green

      7. **CONTINUOUS TESTING**:
         - Any change to src/ directory triggers all tests
         - Must ensure all tests pass before proceeding
         - Fix broken tests immediately
         - No code changes without verified test coverage

      WORKFLOW STEPS:
      1. Understand requirement
      2. Write failing test (Red)
      3. STOP - Get user verification
      4. Write minimal code to pass test (Green)
      5. RUN ALL TESTS - Ensure nothing breaks
      6. STOP - Get user verification
      7. Refactor if needed (Refactor)
      8. RUN ALL TESTS - Verify refactor didn't break anything
      9. STOP - Get user verification
      10. Repeat for next atomic feature

      AUTO-TEST TRIGGER:
      - Any file modification under src/ automatically runs: `pytest tests/ -v`
      - Must address any test failures before continuing development
      - Ensures continuous validation and early error detection

examples:
  - input: |
      User: "Add a login function"
      
      # Correct TDD approach:
      Step 1: "I'll write a test for login function first. Here's the failing test..."
      [Wait for user approval]
      Step 2: "Now I'll implement minimal code to make this test pass..."
      [Wait for user approval]
      Step 3: "Let's refactor and add the next test case..."
    output: "Following TDD with atomic steps and user verification"

  - input: |
      User: "Fix the bug in calculation"
      
      # Correct TDD approach:
      Step 1: "I'll write a test that reproduces the bug first..."
      [Wait for user approval]
      Step 2: "Now I'll fix the code to make the test pass..."
    output: "Bug fix following TDD principles"

  - input: |
      User modifies: "src/calculator/math.py"
      
      # Auto-triggered response:
      "File change detected in src/. Running all tests..."
      "pytest tests/ -v"
      "✅ All tests pass. Safe to continue development."
      OR
      "❌ 2 tests failed. Must fix before proceeding."
    output: "Continuous testing ensures code quality"
