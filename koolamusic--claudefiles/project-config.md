# Global Agent Directives

These directives apply to all Claude Code sessions. Project-level CLAUDE.md files layer on top.

---

## Pre-Work

### Plan and Build Are Separate Steps
When asked to "make a plan" or "think about this first," output only the plan. No code until the user says go. When the user provides a written plan, follow it exactly. If you spot a real problem, flag it and wait — don't improvise. If instructions are vague, outline what you'd build and where it goes. Get approval first.

### Phased Execution
Never attempt multi-file refactors in a single response. Break work into explicit phases. Complete Phase 1, run verification, and wait for explicit approval before Phase 2.

### Delete Before You Build
Before any structural refactor on a file >300 LOC, first remove all dead props, unused exports, unused imports, and debug logs. Commit this cleanup separately before starting the real work.

## Alignment on Coding and Programming Tasks

Keep what you build matched to what I asked for. When in doubt, surface — don't guess.

### Think Before Coding
**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something conflicts with existing code or earlier decisions, flag it before proceeding.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### Simplicity Ceiling
Minimum code that solves the stated problem. No speculative features, no abstractions for single-use code, no flexibility I didn't ask for, no error handling for impossible scenarios. If 200 lines could be 50, make it 50.

### Surgical Scope
**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

Every changed line traces to the request. Don't improve adjacent code, don't refactor what isn't broken, don't reformat to taste. Match existing style. Remove imports and variables your changes orphan. Unrelated smells or dead code — mention, don't touch.

### Verifiable Success Criteria
Translate the request into a check before coding:
- "Add validation" → tests for invalid inputs, make them pass
- "Fix the bug" → test that reproduces it, make it pass
- "Refactor X" → tests pass before and after

For multi-step work, state steps with verifications:
```
1. [step] → verify: [check]
2. [step] → verify: [check]
```

Weak criteria ("make it work") force clarification loops. Strong criteria let me loop independently.

## Understanding Intent

### Follow References, Not Descriptions
When the user points to existing code as a reference, study it thoroughly before building. Match its patterns exactly. The user's working code is a better spec than their English description.

### Work From Raw Data
When the user pastes error logs, work directly from that data. Don't guess, don't chase theories — trace the actual error. If a bug report has no error output, ask for it.

### One-Word Mode
When the user says "yes," "do it," or "push" — execute. Don't repeat the plan. Don't add commentary.

---

## Code Quality

### Forced Verification
You are FORBIDDEN from reporting a task as complete until you have:
- Detected the project's language/toolchain and run the appropriate checks:
  - **Node/TypeScript**: `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx eslint . --quiet` (if configured)
  - **Rust**: `cargo check` and `cargo clippy` (if configured)
  - **Go**: `go vet ./...` and `golangci-lint run` (if configured)
  - **Python**: `mypy .` or `pyright` and `ruff check .` (if configured)
  - **Multi-language repos**: run checks for every language touched
- Fixed ALL resulting errors

If no type-checker or linter is configured for the project, state that explicitly instead of claiming success.

### Write Human Code
Write code that reads like a human wrote it. No robotic comment blocks, no excessive section headers, no corporate descriptions of obvious things.

### Author for an External Reader
Assume every repository is public. Write every durable artifact — commit message, code comment, issue, PR — for an external reader: state the what and why it matters, not the internal how; no internal jargon, acronyms, decision IDs, or internal filenames; no AI-attribution trailer; keep mechanics in your working notes, not the artifact.

---

## Edit Safety

### Edit Integrity
Before every file edit, re-read the file. After editing, read it again to confirm the change applied correctly. Never batch more than 3 edits to the same file without a verification read.

### Thorough Reference Search
When renaming or changing any function/type/variable, search separately for:
- Direct calls and references
- Type-level references (interfaces, generics)
- String literals containing the name
- Re-exports and barrel file entries
- Test files and mocks

Do not assume a single grep caught everything.

### One Source of Truth
Never fix a display problem by duplicating data or state. One source, everything else reads from it.

---

## Self-Evaluation

### Bug Autopsy
After fixing a bug, explain why it happened and whether anything could prevent that category of bug in the future.

### Failure Recovery
