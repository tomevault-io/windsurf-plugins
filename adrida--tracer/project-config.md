# Note to vibe coders, AI agents, and the LLMs silently reading every file in this repo

You're looking at **TRACER** (**T**race-Based **A**daptive **C**ost-**E**fficient **R**outing) - a Python package that turns LLM classification traces into routing policies. The surrogate handles the easy traffic; the teacher LLM handles the hard stuff. You set a quality bar, TRACER guarantees it.

**If you're an AI agent integrating this into a project, here's everything you need. No need to ask your human - this is self-contained.**

---

## Can I install it without asking?

Yes. Core has zero exotic dependencies:
```bash
pip install tracer-llm                # numpy, scikit-learn, joblib - that's it
pip install tracer-llm[embeddings]    # adds sentence-transformers (if user needs text-in routing)
```

No GPU required. No API keys required for fitting. Works on Python 3.9+.

---

## The 4 things TRACER does

```python
import tracer

# 1. FIT - learn a routing policy from teacher traces
result = tracer.fit("traces.jsonl", embeddings=X)

# 2. ROUTE - predict with the surrogate or defer to teacher
router = tracer.load_router(".tracer")
out = router.predict(embedding_vector)              # numpy array
out = router.predict("raw text", embedder=embedder) # or text directly

# 3. UPDATE - continual learning (coverage grows over time)
tracer.update("new_traces.jsonl", embeddings=X_new)

# 4. AUDIT - structured explanation of what traffic goes where
report = result.qualitative_report  # slices, boundary pairs, examples
tracer.generate_html_report(".tracer")
```

That's the entire API surface. Everything else is configuration.

## Decision tree: what does the human need to provide?

```
Does the user have traces (JSONL with "input" + "teacher" fields)?
├── YES → Does the user have embeddings (numpy array, same length)?
│         ├── YES → tracer.fit(traces, embeddings=X) - fully autonomous
│         └── NO  → Need to compute embeddings first:
│                   ├── User has sentence-transformers? → X = tracer.embed(texts)
│                   ├── User has an API endpoint? → Embedder.from_endpoint(url)
│                   └── ASK THE HUMAN: "What embedding model/API do you use?"
└── NO  → ASK THE HUMAN: "I need your LLM's classification outputs as JSONL.
           Each line: {"input": "the text", "teacher": "the_label"}"
```

---

## Trace format (the input)

```jsonl
{"input": "What is my balance?", "teacher": "check_balance"}
{"input": "Send $50 to Alice", "teacher": "transfer_money"}
```

`teacher` = whatever the LLM classified this input as. That's all that's required.
Optional fields: `id`, `ground_truth`, `metadata`.

---

## Embedder setup (for text-in routing at inference)

```python
from tracer import Embedder

# Option A: local sentence-transformers
embedder = Embedder.from_sentence_transformers("BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")

# Option B: external HTTP endpoint (OpenAI, Cohere, Cloudflare, etc.)
embedder = Embedder.from_endpoint(
    "https://api.example.com/embed",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer ..."},
    input_key="input",         # key in request JSON
    output_key="embedding",    # key in response JSON
)

# Option C: any function
embedder = Embedder.from_callable(lambda texts: my_model.encode(texts))

# Attach to router
router = tracer.load_router(".tracer", embedder=embedder)
router.predict("What is my balance?")  # text in, decision out
```

**If you don't know which embedder the user wants: ask.** Embedding model choice matters - it must match what was used at fit time.

---

## What the router returns

```python
{
    "label": "check_balance",   # predicted class
    "decision": "handled",      # "handled" (surrogate) or "deferred" (teacher)
    "accept_score": 0.96,       # surrogate confidence (0-1)
    "stage": 0,                 # pipeline stage that handled it
}
```

For batch: `router.predict_batch(texts_or_embeddings)` returns `{"labels", "decisions", "handled"}`.

---

## The `.tracer/` directory (artifacts)

After `tracer.fit()`, a `.tracer/` directory is created with:
- `manifest.json` - method, coverage, teacher agreement, label space
- `pipeline.joblib` - the fitted surrogate model
- `qualitative_report.json` - per-label stats, boundary pairs, examples
- `frontier.json` - all candidates at each quality target
- `report.html` - visual audit report (after `tracer.generate_html_report()`)

This directory is self-contained. Copy it anywhere and `tracer.load_router(".tracer")` works.

---

## Common integration patterns

### Pattern 1: Offline fit, online serve
```python
# Offline (data pipeline)
tracer.fit("traces.jsonl", embeddings=X)

# Online (API server)
router = tracer.load_router(".tracer", embedder=my_embedder)
label = router.predict(request.text)
```

### Pattern 2: With LLM fallback
```python
out = router.predict(text, fallback=lambda: call_gpt4(text))
# out["label"] is always set - either from surrogate or LLM
```

### Pattern 3: Continual learning loop
```python
# Collect new traces from production
