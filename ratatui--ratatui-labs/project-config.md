# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is a Rust workspace for experimental Ratatui crates and prototypes.

- `Cargo.toml` defines the workspace and shared package metadata.
- `crates/ratatui-action/` owns semantic action identifiers, metadata, inputs, and invocations.
- `crates/ratatui-command-palette/` owns command palette state, rendering, preview, and examples.
- `crates/ratatui-labs/` is the umbrella crate for labs-style experiments and namespaced crate
  access.
- `crates/*/src/lib.rs` should be a crate overview and module map, not the default home for broad
  implementation.
- `crates/ratatui-command-palette/src/state.rs` owns the state machine API; key adapters,
  matching, selection, shortcut labels, rendering, view data, and tests should stay in their named
  modules.
- `crates/*/README.md` is the public crate-facing documentation.

Add new experiments as separate crates under `crates/` when they may grow independently.

For early experiments, organize crates and modules around owned concepts instead of putting all code
in one file or broad helper buckets. Split `lib.rs` early when docs or implementation are likely to
grow into hundreds of lines, unless the types have a strong single-file coherence. Prefer named
crates and modules such as `ratatui-action`, `ratatui-command-palette`, `render/`, and `view.rs`
over `utils.rs`, `common.rs`, or `types.rs` unless local structure clearly justifies the
alternative. Keep weak abstractions close to their first use until multiple callers or a stable
domain name prove they should move outward.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

```sh
cargo +nightly fmt --all
cargo check --workspace --all-targets
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
just validate
just betamax # when a Betamax tape exists or visible TUI behavior changed
markdownlint-cli2 README.md 'crates/**/*.md'
```

`cargo +nightly fmt --all` applies the repo rustfmt settings copied from Betamax. `cargo check`
validates all crates and targets without building tests. `cargo clippy` enforces warning-free code.
`cargo test` runs unit tests and doctests. `just validate` runs the local validation bundle.
`markdownlint-cli2` checks Markdown formatting with the repository config.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use Rust 2024 and the workspace lint settings. Unsafe code is forbidden. Prefer small, readable
modules and explicit names over premature abstractions. Crate names should use the `ratatui-*`
pattern, with directories matching package names, such as `crates/ratatui-labs`.

Markdown prose should wrap at 100 columns unless a table or URL makes that impractical.

## TUI Visual Style

Do not default to bordered boxes around every region. Use borders when they clarify containment,
focus, pane structure, or modality; otherwise prefer spacing, color, background, alignment, or text
hierarchy. Pane-based applications can use borders well, but balance them with quieter unboxed
status and header areas.

When borders are useful, choose their weight and color deliberately. Ratatui includes plain,
rounded, double, thick, dashed, and quadrant-style border types; use heavier or brighter borders
sparingly for active panes or modal focus, and use muted or lighter borders for secondary panes.

## Testing Guidelines

Place unit tests next to the code they exercise. Prefer focused tests that document expected
behavior over broad placeholder tests. For new public APIs, include doctests or README examples when
the example helps users understand the crate.

Use Betamax for terminal-rendering validation when a change affects visible TUI behavior. The local
`just betamax` recipe should run the relevant tape and write rendered artifacts under
`target/betamax/`, especially screenshots, GIFs, and terminal state snapshots. Prefer Betamax tape
steps over PTY-only smoke tests for row selection, expansion/collapse behavior, status/title bars,
scrolling, colors, wrapping, keyboard interactions, and jj-rendered template output. Keep unit tests
for state and action behavior, but use Betamax as evidence that the actual terminal rendering and
interaction sequence work.

Use Betamax's default font size unless a tape is intentionally demonstrating a presentation size.
If a tape sets `FontSize`, document the reason near the tape or in the related PRD because larger
fonts reduce useful terminal columns and can hide layout bugs.

Use Betamax's default margin unless a tape intentionally demonstrates a decorated presentation.
Default command-palette tapes should use enough width, currently `Set Width 1200`, for centered
palettes and split panes to be visible without crowding.

Do not check generated Betamax images, GIFs, videos, or state JSON into the repository. Keep them
under `target/betamax/` and reference the local paths in review notes. These artifacts grow quickly
and will bloat the repo over time.

Betamax is still experimental. When Ratatui Labs work exposes tape ergonomics, diagnostics, cwd
handling, artifact inspection, or TUI-capture gaps, capture concrete improvement ideas instead of
treating them as incidental local friction. Good feedback should include the tape command, observed
