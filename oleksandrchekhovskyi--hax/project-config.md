# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repository. Keep this file high-level: commands,
architecture seams, and durable conventions belong here; module-level details belong in code or
headers.

## Build, test, lint

```sh
make                                      # build (quiet; sets up build/ on first run)
make tests                                # build + all tests (unit + e2e)
make lint                                 # clang-format + style script + clang-tidy
scripts/check.sh test <name>...           # build + selected tests (one or more names)
```

`Makefile` delegates to `scripts/check.sh`, which drops routine runner progress but relays
compiler and test diagnostics whether or not the phase succeeds, so a clean run is just a
compact confirmation — prefer these over raw meson invocations to keep output small. The
verbose equivalents (`meson compile -C build`, `meson test -C build --print-errorlogs`)
remain available for per-test timings or full build logs.

`make lint` is the single "is the code clean" gate: clang-format, the project style checks
in `scripts/lint_style.py`, and clang-tidy. Failures say what to fix; the conventions they
enforce are documented where they live (`.clang-format`, `.clang-tidy`, the script's
docstring). Run `clang-format -i` on any C source/header you touch before reporting done.

`BUILD_DIR` selects the build directory; these presets are set up on first use. Any other
name needs `meson setup <dir> <options>` first.

| `BUILD_DIR` | Meson options | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `build` (default) | `debugoptimized` from `meson.build` | everyday build, test, lint |
| `build-asan` | `-Db_sanitize=address,undefined` | memory errors, undefined behavior |
| `build-tsan` | `-Db_sanitize=thread` | data races |
| `build-release` | `--buildtype=release` | extra inlining warnings; run before a release |

```sh
BUILD_DIR=build-asan make tests
BUILD_DIR=build-tsan scripts/check.sh test <name>
BUILD_DIR=build-release make
```

Tests are plain C binaries using `tests/harness.h` (`EXPECT`, `EXPECT_STR_EQ`, `T_SKIP`,
`T_REPORT`). Create scratch directories with the harness's `t_tempdir()`, which removes them
at process exit; raw `mkdtemp` in tests fails `make lint`.
To add a test, append its source to `test_sources` in `tests/meson.build`, grouped to mirror
the production `sources` list. Test names are path-derived: `tools/test_read.c` becomes
`tools/read`, and `test_util.c` becomes `util`.

End-to-end scenarios follow the same conventions in Python: standalone scripts under
`tests/e2e/`, registered in `e2e_scenarios` in `tests/meson.build`. They run the built binary
hermetically against mock scripts from `scripts/mock/` via `tests/e2e/harness.py`; its
docstrings are the how-to.

Useful manual/debug knobs:

- `HAX_PROVIDER=mock` runs the scripted/mock provider. Pair with `HAX_MOCK_SCRIPT=path` or
  `scripts/stream_demo.py` for visual checks without a live LLM.
- `HAX_TRACE=path` logs HTTP/SSE traffic with auth redacted.
- `HAX_TRANSCRIPT=path` logs the model-facing transcript, including tools and results.

### Driving the interactive UI

The REPL prompt and the pickers need a real tty, so they can't be checked by piping stdin.
Use tmux rather than hand-rolled pty scripts — send keys, capture the pane, read the result:

```sh
tmux new-session -d -s haxtest -x 110 -y 32 'HAX_PROVIDER=mock ./build/hax'
tmux send-keys -t haxtest '/model' Enter   # keys; Enter/C-u/Escape as named keys
tmux capture-pane -t haxtest -p            # pane text, escapes already resolved
tmux kill-session -t haxtest
```

Scope cleanup to exactly what you started. The user may be working inside tmux, and this agent
may itself be running inside hax, so anything that matches by name takes their session down
along with the one under test: no `kill-server`, and no `pkill hax` / `killall hax` /
`pkill -f hax`. Kill the session you named, or the PID you captured at launch.

## Architecture

hax is a single-binary REPL:

`input → build context → provider streams events → assemble turn → dispatch tools → loop`

The stable extension seams are `src/provider.h` and `src/tool.h`.

Terminology:

- A **turn** is one provider `stream()` round-trip producing one assistant response and optional
  tool calls.
- A **user turn** is one user prompt plus every spawned turn until the model stops requesting
  tools.
- `ITEM_TURN_BOUNDARY` separates consecutive turns inside one user turn.

Core boundaries:

- The canonical conversation state is the flat, provider-independent `struct item` log owned by
  `struct agent_session`. Compaction appends a summary seed without deleting prior history; build
  model-visible windows with `agent_session_context()` rather than slicing the raw log.
- Provider adapters own native API protocols and wire JSON; shared transport owns HTTP/SSE
  mechanics. Adapters serialize `struct context` and emit provider-independent
  `struct stream_event`; agent behavior must not depend on native response shapes.
- `src/turn.{c,h}` is a pure state machine from borrowed stream events to owned conversation items.
  Keep I/O and presentation out of it.
- Behavior shared by the interactive and one-shot frontends belongs below `src/agent.c` and
