# OpenTikZ — Project Context for Claude Code

## What this project is

OpenTikZ is a community library of **TikZ resources for academic conceptual
diagrams** — system block diagrams, neural network architectures, pipelines,
and flowcharts. It is the "Flaticon for academic TikZ", focused specifically on
conceptual/overview figures (NOT data plots).

**One-line positioning:** A TikZ resource library for paper diagrams — copyable
icons, editable architecture templates, and one repo-wide skill that lets Claude
Code modify those templates so researchers can produce figures fast without
writing TikZ from scratch.

## Target user

Researchers who already write papers in LaTeX, need to draw system/architecture/
pipeline/flow diagrams, but don't want to hand-write TikZ. We call them the
"middle layer": comfortable with LaTeX, not comfortable building TikZ from zero.

## Explicit non-goals (do NOT build these)

- Data plots (line/bar/scatter/heatmap) — those belong to pgfplots/matplotlib
- Pixel-perfect PNG→TikZ conversion (technically an under-determined problem)
- Brand/company logos (trademark risk) — with one curated exception:
  `icons/brands/` carries maintainer-approved marks whose shape data comes from
  the CC0 simple-icons project (see `icons/brands/README.md`)
- General-purpose illustration

## The three-layer content model

1. **Icons** (`icons/`) — atomic, single-concept TikZ elements (server, GPU,
   cloud, database, neuron, attention block, user, arrow/pipe). Each compiles
   standalone and is independently copyable.

2. **Templates** (`templates/`) — complete, **parametric** conceptual figures
   (neural net, encoder-decoder, training pipeline, system block diagram,
   flowchart, distributed training, inference serving). This is the core value.
   Every template carries an `edit_contract` — that contract IS what makes a
   figure a template (see the boundary rule below).

   **Template vs. example (the boundary):** a figure that is worth editing
   parametrically (clear parameter surface + stable node names an AI can target)
   is a **template** and MUST ship an `edit_contract`; a fixed reference figure
   whose value is "look what the library assembles into" is an **example**
   (defined by `composed_of`, no `edit_contract`). The presence of an
   `edit_contract` is the definition of a template — never add one to an example;
   if you want to, that figure has become a template, so move it to `templates/`.
   The full rule lives in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

3. **Skill** (`skills/using-opentikz/`) — THE KEY DIFFERENTIATOR. One repo-wide
   skill that takes an AI agent (you) from a request to a finished figure:
   discover content via `catalog.json`, edit the chosen item, verify it compiles —
   while communicating precisely (ask on material ambiguity, assume-and-state on
   safe defaults). Per-template knowledge lives in each template's `edit_contract`
   (inside its `meta.json`), which the skill reads at edit time; cross-cutting
   reference knowledge (palette, annotations, layout) lives under `reference/`.
   So a user can say "add a cross-attention layer to this template and make it
   blue" and you do it correctly without guessing. There is no per-template
   `skill.md` — that knowledge is now the structured `edit_contract`.

## Hard rules for all content

- Every `.tex` file MUST compile standalone (`\documentclass{standalone}`).
- Every content item has a sibling `.meta.json` validated against
  `meta.schema.json`.
- Colors come from a shared palette (see `reference/color-palettes/`), never
  hard-coded hex inline.
- Node names follow the convention in `docs/DESIGN_GUIDE.md` so the skill can
  target parts reliably.
- Every template carries an `edit_contract` in its `meta.json` (parameters,
  node-naming, styles, operations, invariants); `validate.py` checks its
  parameters/styles exist in the `.tex`.
- Provide light + dark friendly palettes where feasible.

## Licensing

- Code (scripts, build tooling): MIT
- Graphic content (.tex figures): CC0 (maximize academic reuse, zero friction)
- State this clearly; never mix them up.
