## 2. Project Responsibilities

### `Nalix.Common`

Lowest-level shared dependency. Contains cross-cutting contracts and primitives:

- Abstractions and attributes
- Diagnostics interfaces and log models
- Environment helpers and common exceptions
- Identity contracts and primitive types
- Middleware metadata, networking contracts
- Security enums/contracts, serialization contracts

Keep it **lightweight and broadly reusable**. It must not depend on any other Nalix project.

### `Nalix.Framework`

Builds on `Nalix.Common`. Higher-level foundational utilities:

- Configuration and options
- Data frames and packet registry support
- Dependency injection / instance management
- Identifiers (`Snowflake`)
- LZ4 compression
- Memory pools and object/buffer helpers
- Random / CSPRNG helpers
- Security engines and hashing
- Serialization implementation
- Task orchestration and timing

### `Nalix.Logging`

Builds on `Nalix.Common` and `Nalix.Framework`:

- `NLogix` logging facade
- Logging engine and distributor
- Console / file / batch sinks
- Internal formatters and pooling helpers
- Logging configuration objects

### `Nalix.Runtime`

Builds on `Nalix.Common` and `Nalix.Framework`:

- Packet processing and middleware infrastructure
- Middleware pipeline orchestration
- Packet dispatching channels
- Execution management for message-oriented traffic

### `Nalix.Network`

Builds on `Nalix.Common` and `Nalix.Framework`:

- TCP/UDP listeners and connection management
- Protocol lifecycle orchestration
- Routing and packet dispatch infrastructure
- Adaptive throttling and timing systems

### `Nalix.Network.Pipeline`

Builds on `Nalix.Common` and `Nalix.Framework`:

- Reusable middleware for permissions and rate limiting
- Traffic shaping and concurrency gates
- Timekeeping and clock coordination primitives

### `Nalix.Network.Hosting`

Builds on `Nalix.Common`, `Nalix.Framework`, `Nalix.Network`, and `Nalix.Runtime`:

- Microsoft-style host and builder APIs
- Simplified bootstrapping for packet registry and dispatch
- TCP listener lifecycle management

### `Nalix.SDK`

Builds on `Nalix.Common` and `Nalix.Framework`:

- Transport / session clients
- SDK configuration
- Client-facing extensions
- Dispatcher abstractions

## 3. Dependency Rules

```text
Level 0 : Nalix.Common, Nalix.Analyzers
Level 1 : Nalix.Framework            → Common
Level 2 : Nalix.Logging              → Common, Framework
           Nalix.Runtime              → Common, Framework
           Nalix.Network              → Common, Framework
           Nalix.Network.Pipeline     → Common, Framework
           Nalix.SDK                  → Common, Framework
Level 3 : Nalix.Network.Hosting      → Common, Framework, Network, Runtime
```

Do not introduce circular references. Do not add references that violate the above graph.

## 4. Coding Style

| Rule | Guideline |
| :--- | :--- |
| Namespaces | File-scoped only |
| Nullable | Enabled project-wide (`#nullable enable`) — never disable |
| Control flow | Prefer explicit, readable flow over clever abstractions |
| Private instance fields | `_fieldName` |
| Private static fields | Match surrounding file (`s_fieldName` or project-specific) |
| Interfaces | `IType` |
| Async methods | Suffix `Async` |
| Classes | Prefer `sealed` unless inheritance is a genuine requirement |
| Structs | Prefer `readonly struct` and `readonly` members where applicable |
| XML docs | Required on all public APIs (the build generates XML docs) |
| Existing style | Match the style in the target file before introducing a new pattern |

---

## 5. Performance Expectations

Nalix is performance-oriented. In hot paths:

- Prefer `Span<T>`, `ReadOnlySpan<T>`, `Memory<T>`, and pooled buffers.
- Avoid unnecessary allocations, boxing, and virtual/interface dispatch.
- Avoid LINQ when a simple loop is clearer and cheaper.
- Use `Try*` APIs when failure is expected.
- Prefer non-throwing fast paths for parsing, serialization, encoding, and transport.
- Use inlining or low-level attributes only when justified by surrounding code patterns.

Do not add complexity in the name of optimization unless it fits the local design and measurable intent of the module.

---

## 6. Security Expectations

- Validate all external input lengths, ranges, and boundaries before processing.
- Never log secrets, keys, tokens, or raw sensitive payloads.
