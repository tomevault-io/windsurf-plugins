# collegedata.fyi

Open-source archive of U.S. college Common Data Set (CDS) documents.

- **Live site:** https://collegedata.fyi (Next.js on Vercel)
- **API:** https://api.collegedata.fyi (PostgREST on Supabase)
- **Architecture:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (eleven pipelines: schema, corpus, discovery, mirror, extraction, scorecard, institution directory + coverage, IPEDS federal baseline, change intelligence, consumer API, frontend)
- **Frontend PRD:** `docs/prd/002-frontend.md`
- **Design system:** `web/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` (canonical tokens in `web/src/app/tokens.css`; live reference at `/design-system/`). **Read before writing any UI.** Public copy: `web/VOICE.md`.

## Project layout

- `web/` — Next.js 16 frontend (TypeScript, Tailwind, @supabase/supabase-js)
- `supabase/` — Postgres migrations, Edge Functions (Deno/TS), shared modules
- `tools/` — Python extraction pipeline, schema builder, corpus tools
- `schemas/` — Canonical CDS schema JSON (1,105 fields)
- `data/` — Versioned content datasets: `data/discovery/` (PRD 026 guided-discovery
  card library, ontology, deck, scenarios — CC BY-SA 4.0 with a contribution gate,
  see its README) and `data/watchlists/` (change-intelligence school watchlists)
- `docs/` — Architecture, PRDs, ADRs, research, backlog
- `scratch/` — Throwaway operational outputs (gitignored). Default
  destination for any one-off run artifact: audit/drain JSON dumps,
  CSV worklists, screenshots, ZIP handoffs, debug exports. Scripts
  that emit these should write to `scratch/<tool-name>/` rather than
  into `tools/` or the repo root, so working trees stay clean and
  nothing important hides among the dumps.

## Data quality loop

When doing whack-a-mole CDS data improvements, treat each fix as a signal about the
whole corpus, not a one-off.

- For canary-style extraction issues, search the corpus for other documents with the
  same failure shape and redrain the similar files after the parser/cleaner fix.
- For finding/discovery issues, find and archive the most recent two CDS years when
  available, then add a durable finder or archiver hint so the next year's document
  can be found automatically.
- For school identity changes, run `python tools/finder/identity_guard.py` before
  writing generated data, then run `python tools/finder/school_redirect_guard.py`
  to verify the checked-in web redirect manifest. Treat `retired_aliases` as
  durable redirects: preserve them across refreshes and never promote a retired
  slug to another institution.
- Close the loop across current state, prior-year baseline, future discovery, and
  similar files before calling the issue handled.

## Migrations

Migrations are applied to production **only from `main`**, never from a
feature branch. Out-of-band applies (running a migration against prod
from an unmerged branch) leave production ahead of `main` and break
fresh `supabase db reset` for everyone else — don't do this.

**The agent applies migrations after a PR merges, not the user.** Once
a migration PR is merged, the agent's standard sequence is:

```
cd /Users/santhonys/Projects/Owen/colleges/collegedata-fyi
git switch main && git pull --ff-only
supabase db push --linked
```

(`supabase` CLI is at `/opt/homebrew/bin/supabase`; the project is
already linked. Credentials live in `~/Projects/Owen/colleges/collegedata-fyi/.env`
as `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.)

The user shouldn't need to drive `supabase db push` manually — that's
the operational step that follows every migration PR merge. The
"migrations only from main" rule is still load-bearing: the apply
must happen from a fresh `main` checkout, never from a feature
branch, never from a Conductor worktree pinned to a not-yet-merged
branch.

CI runs a `Migration filename hygiene` check on every PR (timestamp
prefix uniqueness + sort order). Full replay against a clean DB is a
manual pre-merge step (`supabase db reset` locally), not CI — several
migrations contain verification DO blocks that assume production data,
which would always fail in a clean CI database. The actual drift
between prod and `main` isn't detectable from CI without prod
credentials anyway; it's a policy safeguard.

## IPEDS federal baseline operations

PRD 021 adds official NCES/IPEDS baseline facts. CDS remains the
school-authored source; IPEDS facts are federal baseline/context and must keep
source table, source variable, release type, release date, imputation status,
and definition-alignment notes visible.

- Loader/runbook: `tools/ipeds/README.md`
- Release probe workflow: `.github/workflows/ipeds-release-probe.yml`
- Core public serving view: `school_facts_unified`
- Public school-page component: `web/src/components/FederalBaselineTable.tsx`

The release probe is monthly and intentionally no-ops until 10 months after the
latest loaded provisional Access release date. When it opens an issue, run the
suggested download/load dry run first, review the report, apply any needed
migrations from fresh `main`, and only then run `load_release.py --apply`.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
