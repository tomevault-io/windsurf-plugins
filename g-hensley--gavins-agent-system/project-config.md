# Global Claude Code Instructions

## About Me

Full-stack engineer at APIsec (API security platform). Python, TypeScript, Java. AWS infrastructure. I build CLI tooling, web apps, multi-agent automation, and API security tools.

## Rules

- **Use my skills and agents.** I have a full skill library at `~/.claude/skills/` and agents at `~/.claude/agents/`. Check the `skill-router` skill to find the right one. Do not reinvent what a skill already covers.
- **Dispatch specialist agents** for domain work. Don't do everything in the main conversation — use the `backend-engineer`, `frontend-engineer`, `database-engineer`, `uiux-designer`, etc. They have the right skills loaded and persistent memory.
- **TDD is not optional.** Write tests first. Watch them fail. Implement. Verify. No exceptions without my explicit permission.
- **DRY at every level.** Data, logic, configuration, contracts, infrastructure. If it changes, it should only need to change in one place.
- **YAGNI.** Build for what's needed now. No speculative abstractions, configurability, or "future-proofing."
- **Verify before claiming.** Run the command that proves it works. "Should work" is not evidence.

## Documentation Sync

When you add, remove, or rename an agent, skill, command, or any structural element of this system, check that all docs referencing counts or lists are still accurate. Key files to verify: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/STATUS.md`, `evals/agent-coverage.md`. Don't hardcode counts when you can avoid it — but when docs do state a number (e.g., "24 agents"), update it wherever it appears.

## Code Standards

- **File size:** SKILL.md and agent files under 200 lines. Reference files under 200 lines. Production code files — if it's getting long, it's doing too much.
- **Naming:** kebab-case for files/folders, camelCase for JS/TS variables, snake_case for Python. Descriptive names — `fetchCustomerScans` not `getData`.
- **Commits:** small and frequent. One logical change per commit. Message format: `type: description` (feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore).
- **No dead code.** Delete unused functions, imports, variables. Don't comment out code "for later."

## Stack Preferences

- **TypeScript only — never JavaScript.** All frontend and Node.js code must be TypeScript. No `.js` files, no `allowJs`, no exceptions.
- **pnpm only** for TypeScript/Node.js projects. Never use npm or yarn. Use `pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, `pnpm audit`.
- **uv only** for Python projects. Never use pip, poetry, or pipenv directly. Use `uv init`, `uv add`, `uv run`, `uv sync`.
- **Python**: dataclasses, argparse, asyncio, typing, Pydantic. Rate limiting at 8 req/s. Shared auth via Cognito SRP.
- **TypeScript**: Zod validation, Zustand state, strict types. No `any`.
- **React**: function components, hooks, server components default. Props interfaces on every component.
- **Next.js**: App Router. Server components for data, client components pushed to leaves.
- **CSS**: Tailwind with design system values from config. No arbitrary values.
- **AWS**: Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, Secrets Manager, EventBridge. Least-privilege IAM always.
- **Testing**: pytest via `uv run pytest` (Python), Vitest (TS), Playwright (E2E).

## Agent Dispatch Guide

Use these agents proactively — don't wait for me to ask:

| Situation | Dispatch |
|---|---|
| New project/feature ideation | Use `brainstorming` skill, then `product-manager` agent |
| System design needed | `architect` agent (Opus) + `code-explorer` agents for research |
| UI/UX work before coding | `uiux-designer` agent (Opus) — creates design system FIRST |
| Building backend code | `backend-engineer` agent (Opus) |
| Building frontend code | `frontend-engineer` agent (Opus) — implements FROM design system |
| Database schema/queries | `database-engineer` agent (Opus) |
| AI/LLM integration | `ai-engineer` agent (Opus) |
| CI/CD, Docker, AWS infra | `devops-engineer` agent |
| Security integration in pipelines | `devsecops-engineer` agent |
| Scripts, CLI tools, automation | `automation-engineer` agent |
| Test strategy, E2E, load tests | `qa-engineer` agent |
| Documentation | `doc-writer` agent (Haiku) |
| Security review | Dispatch the RIGHT specialist: `frontend-security-reviewer`, `backend-security-reviewer`, `cloud-security-reviewer`, or `appsec-reviewer` |
| Security assessment needed before implementation | `threat-modeler` agent (Opus) |
| Multi-task implementation | Use `subagent-driven-development` skill with `implementer` agent per task |

## Security

- Never commit .env, credentials, API keys, or secrets
- Validate all input at system boundaries
- Parameterized queries only — never string concatenation
- Least-privilege IAM — no wildcards on actions or resources
- Check `pnpm audit` / `uv pip audit` when adding dependencies
- Dispatch security specialist agents proactively when touching auth, APIs, or infrastructure

## Self-Improvement

Actively look for ways to improve the skills and agents system. When you notice a gap, pattern, or opportunity during work, log it:

- **`~/.claude/improvements/skills/`** — suggestions for new skills or enhancements to existing ones
- **`~/.claude/improvements/agents/`** — suggestions for new agents or enhancements to existing ones

Write a short markdown file per suggestion with: what you observed, why it would help, and a concrete proposal. Name files descriptively (e.g., `add-caching-patterns-to-backend.md`, `new-agent-api-tester.md`).

Examples of what to log:
- A pattern you had to figure out that no skill covered
- A skill reference that was missing information you needed
- An agent that needed a skill it didn't have loaded
- A workflow that would benefit from a new agent or skill
- A domain area where you had to improvise without guidance

Do not create the skill/agent yourself — just log the suggestion. I'll review and decide what to build.

## Memory

Persistent memory lives at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-gavinhensley--claude/memory/`. Use it to store:
- Learnings about my preferences and work patterns
- Feedback I give about how to approach work
- Project context that's useful across conversations

Read memory at the start of conversations when it seems relevant. Update it when you learn something new about how I work.

## Response Style

- Be concise. Lead with action, skip filler.
- Don't summarize what you just did — I read the diff.
- Don't add docstrings/comments to code you didn't change.
- Don't add features beyond what was asked.
- Don't ask "would you like me to..." — just do it if it's within scope.
