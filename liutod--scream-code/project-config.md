Launch a subagent to handle a focused task. Prefer this tool over doing the work yourself when the task matches one of the specialists listed below.

Specialist subagents are listed at the end of this description under "Available agent types" — that list is generated from the active profiles and carries each specialist's own USE WHEN / NOT FOR triggers. Read it before choosing a `subagent_type`; never assume a type exists.

## Required prompt structure

The final prompt sent to the subagent MUST contain these sections. Provide them either by writing them directly into the `prompt` field, or by using the structured `target`, `change`, and `acceptance` fields — they will be appended to `prompt` automatically.

```markdown
# Target
Exact files, symbols, or directories to touch. Explicit non-goals.

# Change
Step-by-step what to add, remove, or modify. Include concrete examples when possible.

# Acceptance
Observable result that proves completion: a passing test, a build command, a specific file content, or a verification step the subagent must run.
```

Omitting a section causes the subagent to miss context and increases the chance of a wrong or incomplete result.

Writing the prompt:
- The subagent starts with zero context — it has not seen this conversation. Brief it like a colleague who just walked into the room: state the goal, list what you already know, hand over the specifics.
- Lookups (read this file, run that test): put the exact path or command in the prompt. The subagent should not have to search for things you already know.
- Investigations (figure out X, find why Y): give the question, not prescribed steps — fixed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.
- Do not delegate understanding. If the task hinges on a file path or line number, find it yourself first and write it into the prompt.
- The `Acceptance` section is not optional. The subagent MUST verify against it before returning.

Usage notes:
- When the task continues earlier work a subagent already did, prefer resuming that agent (pass its `resume` id) over spawning a fresh instance — the resumed agent keeps its prior context.
- A subagent's result is only visible to you, not to the user. When the user needs to see what a subagent produced, summarize the relevant parts yourself in your own reply.

## Structured output

When you need a machine-readable result (not a free-form summary), pass `output_schema` with a JSON Schema string. The subagent is instructed to reply with a single JSON object matching the schema; if the reply parses, it is surfaced as a `[structured]` block in the tool output. Use `output_token_hint` to keep structured replies compact (e.g. 1024 for a schema-shaped answer).

Example:
```
Agent(prompt="Extract the test commands from this project", output_schema='{"type":"object","properties":{"commands":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}}}')
```

## Capability constraints

By default a subagent gets its profile's full tool set. Pass `capability_mode` to restrict it at the tool level (not just by prompting):

- `read-only` — inspection, search, web/memory lookups, and reporting only. No file writes, no command execution, no spawning further agents.
- `read-write` — additionally file/memory writes. No command execution, no spawning.
- `execute` — additionally command execution (bash, python). Still no spawning of further agents.
- `all` — full profile tool set (default).

Restricted modes also remove `Agent` and `SendSubagentMessage`, so a constrained subagent cannot spawn an unconstrained grandchild to bypass the filter.

## Steering running subagents

Use `SendSubagentMessage` to send a directed message to a subagent you own while it is still running: `steer` for a priority redirection, `queue` for context that applies next turn. A `steer` joins the subagent's running turn at its next step boundary; a `queue` message is delivered when the subagent starts its next turn. Only the owning parent may message a subagent.

When NOT to use Agent: skip delegation for trivial one-step work (e.g. reading a known file). Almost everything else is a candidate for delegation.

Once a subagent is running, leave that scope to it: do not redo its searches or reads in parallel, and do not abandon it midway and finish the job manually. Both undo the context savings the delegation was meant to buy.

## Foreground timeouts auto-background

A `timeout` on a foreground `Agent` call bounds your wait, not the subagent's life. When the deadline fires while the child is still running, it is handed to the background task manager (status: backgrounded) instead of being aborted: the tool returns a `task_id`, its completion notification arrives automatically in a later turn (no polling), and you can peek with `TaskOutput(task_id=..., block=false)` or stop it with `TaskStop`. User cancellation still aborts immediately. A stopped (TaskStop) background task never suggests resume; only tasks that finish or fail on their own are recoverable via `Agent(resume=...)`.
