# Token Efficiency

## Subagent Discipline

- Do not spawn subagents unless:
  - the user explicitly requests them, or
  - the task contains multiple independent workstreams that materially benefit from parallel exploration.
- Prefer direct file searches, targeted reads, and sequential tool calls for normal tasks.
- Do not spawn subagents for simple file discovery, code searches, isolated edits, or straightforward implementation.
- When model selection is supported, use the lightest model appropriate for each subtask:
  - `composer-2.5-fast` for file discovery, targeted exploration, and simple mechanical work
  - medium reasoning for normal implementation and debugging
  - high reasoning only for difficult debugging, architectural analysis, or explicitly requested deep investigation
- Never spawn more than 3 subagents in parallel unless the user explicitly requests more.
- Do not allow subagents to spawn additional subagents.
- Give each subagent a concrete, bounded task with a clear expected output.

## Planning and Stop Points

- Write a plan and request feedback before implementation when:
  - requirements are materially ambiguous,
  - the change introduces or alters architecture or public APIs,
  - multiple valid approaches have meaningful tradeoffs, or
  - the work is difficult to reverse.
- Do not require approval merely because a change touches several files.
- For clear, low-risk tasks, proceed directly with implementation.
- If the user explicitly asks to complete the task end-to-end, continue through implementation and verification without unnecessary approval checkpoints.
- Stop before creating a PR, deploying, publishing, sending messages, or performing other external actions unless the user requested them.
- If essential information is missing, ask the smallest number of focused clarifying questions needed to proceed.
- Otherwise, make reasonable low-risk assumptions and state them briefly.

## Verification

- Treat relevant testing, type-checking, linting, and focused validation as part of implementation.
- Run the smallest useful verification first.
- Do not run unrelated test suites or perform unrelated cleanup.
- If verification is expensive, explain what should be run and ask before proceeding.
- After implementation and verification, summarize the changes and stop.

## Tool Call Efficiency

- Batch independent reads and searches when possible.
- Prefer targeted searches over broad repository exploration.
- Use specific grep patterns when the target is known.
- Use glob/file discovery tools before broader exploration.
- Do not reread unchanged files without a concrete reason.
- After editing, reread only the relevant changed sections when needed for verification.
- Avoid repeating searches that have already produced sufficient context.
- Keep tool output focused and avoid retrieving substantially more content than needed.

## Scope Discipline

- Implement only what the user requested and what is necessary to make it work correctly.
- Do not expand into unrelated refactoring, cleanup, documentation, or feature work.
- Do not continue polishing after the requested result has been implemented and verified.
- Before starting a potentially long autonomous task, identify a clear completion condition.

## Broad Instructions

When the user says “keep going,” “finish it,” or “do it all”:

- Treat that as permission to complete the requested scope without repeated confirmation.
- Continue through implementation and relevant verification.
- Use internal checkpoints to control scope, but do not interrupt the user at every checkpoint.
- Stop once the requested outcome is complete and verified.
