# Agent Instructions

<!-- myc:agents-start v=3 -->
## Project Management with Mycelium

This project uses [Mycelium](https://github.com/tcsenpai/mycelium) (`myc`) for task and epic management.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Initialize mycelium in this project (creates .mycelium/ directory)
myc init

# Create an epic (a large body of work)
myc epic create --title "Feature X" --description "Build feature X"

# Create tasks within an epic
myc task create --title "Implement Y" --description "Build the implementation for Y" --epic 1 --priority high --due 2025-12-31

# Task priorities: low, medium, high, critical
# Task status: open, closed

# List tasks
myc task list
myc task list --epic 1
myc task list --overdue
myc task list --blocked

# Manage dependencies (task 1 blocks task 2)
myc task link blocks --task 1 2
myc deps show 2

# Close tasks (blocked tasks cannot be closed without --force)
myc task close 1

# Assign tasks
myc assignee create --name "Alice" --github "alice"
myc task assign 1 1

# Link to external resources
myc task link github-issue --task 1 "owner/repo#123"
myc task link github-pr --task 1 "owner/repo#456"
myc task link url --task 1 "https://example.com"

# Project overview
myc summary

# Export data
myc export json
myc export csv
```

### Data Model

- **Epic**: A large body of work with a title and optional description (e.g., a feature or milestone)
- **Task**: A unit of work with a title and optional description, optionally linked to an epic
- **Dependency**: Task A blocks Task B (B cannot close until A is closed)
- **Assignee**: Person assigned to a task (can have GitHub username)
- **External Ref**: Link to GitHub issues/PRs or URLs

### Git Tracking

The `.mycelium/` directory contains the SQLite database and should be committed to git:

```bash
git add .mycelium/
git commit -m "Add mycelium project tracking"
```

### Follow-ups (`myc followup`, alias `myc fu`)

Lightweight scratch table for non-blocking "oh-by-the-way" items
captured mid-work — bugs, questions, ideas, things the user should look
at later. **Separate from tasks** (no epic/priority/deps/assignee). Most
follow-ups are resolved by the user, not the agent.

```bash
myc followup add "body text"                # capture (body required)
myc followup add "body text" --title "tag"  # optional short title
myc fu add "short form alias works too"

myc followup list                           # all (default)
myc followup list -o                        # only active (open + in_progress)
myc followup list -c                        # only closed (done + wontfix)
myc followup list --status done             # exact status

myc followup show <id>                      # full detail
myc followup next                           # lowest-ID active (agent loop)
myc followup count                          # JSON: {open, in_progress, done, wontfix}

myc followup start <id>                     # → in_progress
myc followup done <id> [--reason "..."]     # → done
myc followup wontfix <id> [--reason "..."]  # → wontfix
myc followup reopen <id>                    # → open

myc followup edit <id> --body "new body" [--title -|"new title"]
myc followup append <id> "more context"     # timestamped, preserves existing
myc followup rm <id> [--force]
myc followup promote <id> [--epic N] [--priority high]  # convert to task
```

**Agent rule — end-of-task follow-up check** (MANDATORY)

At the end of every mycelium-tracked unit of work (closing a task,
finishing a user-requested change that touched myc state), the agent
MUST:

1. Run `myc followup list --format json` (or `myc followup count
   --format json`).
2. If `active > 0`, surface them to the user before wrapping:
   > "Before we wrap — N open follow-up(s): [titles/bodies]. Want me to
   > handle any now, or leave for later?"
3. **Never silently process them.** Always ask.

`myc task close` itself also prints a one-line reminder, but the agent
should still proactively check.

Use `myc followup add` during work to capture anything you notice but
shouldn't act on right now.

### For AI Agents

When working on this project:

1. Check existing tasks: `myc task list`
2. Check blocked tasks: `myc task list --blocked`
3. Create tasks for new work: `myc task create --title "..." --description "..." --epic N`
4. Capture incidental observations as follow-ups: `myc followup add "..."`
5. At end of task: `myc followup list` and surface open ones to the user
6. Mark tasks complete when done: `myc task close N`
7. Use `--format json` for machine-readable output: `myc task list --format json`

## Mental Frameworks for Mycelium Usage

### 1. INVEST — Task Quality Gate

Before creating or updating any task, validate it against these criteria.
A task that fails more than one is not ready to be written.

| Criterion | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Independent** | Can be completed without unblocking other tasks first |
| **Negotiable** | The *what* is fixed; the *how* remains open |
| **Valuable** | Produces a verifiable, concrete outcome |
| **Estimable** | If you cannot size it, it is too vague or too large |
| **Small** | If it spans more than one work cycle, split it |
| **Testable** | Has an explicit, binary done condition |

> If a task fails **Estimable** or **Testable**, convert it to an Epic and decompose.
