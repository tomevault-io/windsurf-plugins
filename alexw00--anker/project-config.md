## Project overview

Obsidian community plugin for spaced repetition flashcards using FSRS. The plugin uses a **hydration model**: frontmatter is the source of truth and the Markdown body is generated from templates.

## How it works (high level)

- Card creation writes frontmatter and regenerates body from templates.
- Reviews update scheduling in frontmatter.
- Review history is stored in a separate JSONL file (`review-history.jsonl`) in the plugin folder, **not** in the Markdown files. This keeps card files clean while collecting data for FSRS parameter optimization.
- Template changes regenerate body.
- No database - all card data is stored in Markdown files (mainly frontmatter). Plugin operational data (review history, settings) lives in the plugin config folder.

## Hooks (run after changes)

- **Lint**: `npm run lint`
- **Typecheck**: `npm run typecheck`
- **Test (unit + integration)**: `npm test -- --run`
- **Build (when needed)**: `npm run build`

## Key conventions

- Flashcards live in Markdown files with frontmatter fields like `_type`, `_template`, `_review`.
- Template variables use Nunjucks `{{ variable }}` syntax.
- Generated content starts with `<!-- flashcard-content: DO NOT EDIT BELOW -->`.

## Best practices

- Keep [src/main.ts](src/main.ts) minimal (lifecycle + registration only).
- Prefer Obsidian UI components (modals, settings, inputs) over custom HTML/CSS when possible.
- Use `this.register*` helpers to clean up listeners and intervals.
- Avoid unnecessary network calls. If required, document and provide opt-in.
- Keep changes mobile-safe
- Use Obsidian CSS variables for colors, fonts, spacing, etc. - don't create a "theme" for the plugin - it should look like a built in plugin.
- Create re-usable components for repeated UI patterns (e.g. lists etc) so that the plugin looks consistent and shares code.
- Write high value unit tests for logic that does not depend on the Obsidian API.

## Review system learnings

- Do not rely on the metadata cache immediately after writing frontmatter; keep in-memory session state or read from disk when freshness matters.
- When a card stays due after rating, keep it in the session and increment a separate reviews-performed counter.
- Avoid re-querying due cards mid-session if it depends on stale cache data; update only the current card's state in the session list.
- Auto-regeneration during review must be non-blocking and tolerate missing templates without throwing or spamming errors.
- Ensure every card has a stable `_id` at creation/import; add a migration for legacy cards missing IDs.

## Testing guidelines

- After any code changes, run lint, typecheck, and unit + integration tests.
- E2E tests are not required locally; they run in CI/CD because they are resource intensive.
- Unit tests cover pure logic that does not require the Obsidian API.
- Integration tests also avoid the Obsidian API, but can exercise file interactions like Anki packages, templates, or markdown fixtures.
- E2E tests validate end-to-end user flows in Obsidian; keep them focused on high-value paths.
- Follow the Pareto principle for coverage: prioritize high-impact scenarios over exhaustive coverage.

## Obsidian API reference

- API docs: https://docs.obsidian.md (see for components, functions etc.)
- When unsure about an API or UI pattern, consult the docs and reuse official components before building custom UI.
