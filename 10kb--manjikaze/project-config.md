# Repo rules

## Environment

- This provisioning code is designed to run on Manjaro Linux.
- The default shell is `zsh`.

## User Input

- User input should be handled using the Gum package.
- Gum documentation: https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum
- For user choices, prefer `gum choose` or `gum confirm`.
- For text input, use `gum input`.
- For multi-line input, use `gum write`.

## Script Design

- All scripts should be designed to be re-runnable without causing issues.
- Don't add unnecessary comments to scripts. Only add comments if something is not obvious.

## Package Management

- Use `pacman` for official repository packages.
- Use `yay` for AUR packages.
- Add `--noconfirm --noprogressbar --quiet` to all `yay` and `pacman` commands.
- Add `-s` to all `curl` commands to enable silent mode.

## Error Handling

- Include proper error handling in scripts.
- Use `set -e` at the beginning of scripts to exit on any error.

## Logging

- Use the `status` function for consistent logging across scripts.
