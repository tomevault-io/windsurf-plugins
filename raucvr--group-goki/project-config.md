# Repository Guidelines

- Repo: https://github.com/raucvr/Group-Goki
- GitHub issues/comments/PR comments: use literal multiline strings or `-F - <<'EOF'` (or $'...') for real newlines; never embed "\\n".

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- Source code: `src/` (CLI wiring in `src/cli`, commands in `src/commands`, infra in `src/infra`).
- Tests: colocated `*.test.ts`.
- Built output lives in `dist/`.
- Plugins/extensions: live under `extensions/*` (workspace packages). Keep plugin-only deps in the extension `package.json`; do not add them to the root `package.json` unless core uses them.
- Primary extension: `extensions/quant-sec/` — SEC EDGAR filing monitor with 3 tools and 14 actions.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- Runtime baseline: Node **22+** (keep Node + Bun paths working).
- Install deps: `pnpm install`
- If deps are missing (for example `node_modules` missing, `vitest not found`, or `command not found`), run the repo's package-manager install command (prefer lockfile/README-defined PM), then rerun the exact requested command once.
- Also supported: `bun install` (keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` + Bun patching in sync when touching deps/patches).
- Prefer Bun for TypeScript execution (scripts, dev, tests): `bun <file.ts>` / `bunx <tool>`.
- Type-check/build: `pnpm build`
- TypeScript checks: `pnpm tsgo`
- Lint/format: `pnpm check`
- Format check: `pnpm format` (oxfmt --check)
- Format fix: `pnpm format:fix` (oxfmt --write)
- Tests: `pnpm test` (vitest); coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`
- Quant-sec tests: `pnpm test extensions/quant-sec`

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Language: TypeScript (ESM). Prefer strict typing; avoid `any`.
- Formatting/linting via Oxlint and Oxfmt; run `pnpm check` before commits.
- Never add `@ts-nocheck` and do not disable `no-explicit-any`; fix root causes.
- Never share class behavior via prototype mutation. Use explicit inheritance/composition.
- Add brief code comments for tricky or non-obvious logic.
- Keep files concise; extract helpers instead of "V2" copies.
- Aim to keep files under ~700 LOC; guideline only. Split/refactor when it improves clarity or testability.
- Naming: use **Group-Goki** for product/app/docs headings; use `groupgoki` for CLI command, package/binary, paths, and config keys.

## Testing Guidelines

- Framework: Vitest with V8 coverage thresholds (70% lines/branches/functions/statements).
- Naming: match source names with `*.test.ts`; e2e in `*.e2e.test.ts`.
- Run `pnpm test` (or `pnpm test:coverage`) before pushing when you touch logic.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Follow concise, action-oriented commit messages (e.g., `feat: add SEC filing search`).
- Group related changes; avoid bundling unrelated refactors.
- PR submission template (canonical): `.github/pull_request_template.md`

## Agent-Specific Notes

- Never edit `node_modules`.
- When adding a new `AGENTS.md` anywhere in the repo, also add a `CLAUDE.md` symlink pointing to it.
- When working on a GitHub Issue or PR, print the full URL at the end of the task.
- When answering questions, respond with high-confidence answers only: verify in code; do not guess.
- Any dependency with `pnpm.patchedDependencies` must use an exact version (no `^`/`~`).
- Patching dependencies requires explicit approval; do not do this by default.
- Bug investigations: read source code of relevant npm dependencies and all related local code before concluding; aim for high-confidence root cause.
- Code style: add brief comments for tricky logic; keep files under ~500 LOC when feasible.
- Tool schema guardrails: avoid `Type.Union` in tool input schemas; no `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf`. Use `stringEnum`/`optionalStringEnum` for string lists, and `Type.Optional(...)` instead of `... | null`.
- Tool schema guardrails: avoid raw `format` property names in tool schemas; some validators treat `format` as a reserved keyword.
- Lint/format churn:
  - If staged+unstaged diffs are formatting-only, auto-resolve without asking.
  - If commit/push already requested, auto-stage and include formatting-only follow-ups in the same commit, no extra confirmation.
  - Only ask when changes are semantic (logic/data/behavior).
