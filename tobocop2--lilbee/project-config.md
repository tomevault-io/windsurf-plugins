# Agent instructions

This project pairs you with **lilbee**, a local retrieval engine wired in over MCP. Every
question about a file in this project, every claim about code or documents, every "what
does X say about Y" goes through `lilbee_*` tools. The built-in `codesearch`, `websearch`,
and `webfetch` are deliberately denied here so you can't shortcut around the library.

## Hard rule: never search while indexing

`lilbee_search` and indexing (`lilbee_add`, `lilbee_sync`, `lilbee_crawl`,
`lilbee_model_pull`) share a single in-process embedder worker inside the lilbee MCP
server. They cannot run at the same time. If you call `lilbee_search` while indexing is
still in progress, the call will hang and your client will time it out.

**Sequence every task this way:**

1. Decide whether the library needs indexing or updating. If yes, hand the long op to the
   `lilbee-worker` subagent — opencode supports `@lilbee-worker` mention syntax, Claude
   Code uses the Task/Agent tool. Use whichever your host supports. **Wait for the worker
   to report back** before doing anything else. Do not call any `lilbee_*` tool from your
   own thread while the worker is running. Do not start a parallel thought to "save time";
   there is nothing to do until the worker reports done.
2. After the worker returns, run `lilbee_status` once to confirm the expected source /
   chunk counts before searching.
3. Then call `lilbee_search` (and friends) freely; the embedder is no longer pinned.

If you skip step 2 and your first `lilbee_search` returns an MCP timeout, that's the
indexing finishing up. Wait 10 seconds, re-check `lilbee_status`, and retry the search.
Do not change retrieval strategy or fall back to other tools; the search will work the
moment the embedder is free.

You will spend most of your time on two things:

1. **Setting the library up.** Indexing files, crawling a docs site, swapping models.
   These are long-running, so they go to the `lilbee-worker` subagent (your host's
   subagent invocation: `@lilbee-worker` in opencode, the Task / Agent tool in Claude
   Code). You wait for it to report done.
2. **Talking to the library.** Searching it, listing what's in it, checking status. These
   are fast, so you run them inline.

## Querying the library (inline, fast)

1. **`lilbee_search` is your primary research tool.** Use it before answering any question
   about the project. The query should be the most distinct noun phrase from the user's
   question, not the whole sentence ("oil capacity", not "what's my oil capacity?"). Run
   multiple searches when the answer needs more than one anchor.
2. **Cite the file and line (or page) for every fact you state**, exactly as
   `lilbee_search` returned it. If a claim doesn't trace back to a chunk, drop it.
3. **If the answer isn't in the library, say so.** Don't invent. Don't fall back to general
   knowledge without flagging the switch explicitly.
4. **Other inline reads:** `lilbee_status` (what's indexed and which models are wired in),
   `lilbee_list_documents` (the file list), `lilbee_model_list` / `lilbee_model_show`
   (model surface), `lilbee_crawl_status` (poll an in-flight crawl).

## Remembering across sessions (optional)

If memory is enabled (`lilbee_settings_set({"memory_enabled": true})`, then
restart the MCP server so the memory tools register), use
`lilbee_memory_remember` to keep durable notes about the project and
`lilbee_memory_recall` to pull them back in a later session. Your memories are
private to you; they never
leak into the human's chat, and `lilbee_search` never mixes them into cited
results. Pin a stable identity with `LILBEE_AGENT_ID` in this server's env (see
`opencode.json`) so your memories survive across sessions. Both calls embed
text, so they count as searches: don't call them while indexing.

## Setting the library up (delegate to lilbee-worker)

Long-running operations block the chat thread, so they go to the `lilbee-worker` subagent
through your host's subagent mechanism (opencode: `@lilbee-worker` mention; Claude Code:
the Task / Agent tool). Wait for the worker to report done, then continue answering.

- `lilbee_add` — index a file or folder. SHA-dedupes, so calling it on an already-indexed
  path is instant; you can call it unconditionally instead of probing first. The worker
  runs `lilbee_init` for you if no `.lilbee/` exists.
- `lilbee_sync` — re-index after the watched paths change.
- `lilbee_crawl` — crawl a docs site: pass a `depth` (or `depth=null` for the whole
  site); the default fetches only the given page. The worker polls `lilbee_crawl_status`
  to completion.
- `lilbee_model_pull` — download a model from Hugging Face.

## Writing code against an indexed API reference

**This is the most important section for code-generation tasks.** When the indexed files
are an API or class reference (Godot XML, a software package's source, a docs site,
vendor SDK headers), assume your training data is outdated relative to those files and
follow the Plan / Search / Write / Verify workflow below on every code-generation task.
**Do not skip steps to "save time."** The workflow exists because skipping the search
step is how hallucinated APIs get into generated code.
