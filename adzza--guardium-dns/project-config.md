# GitHub identity for guardium-dns

This repo is **`github.com/adzza/guardium-dns`** under the personal **`adzza`** account.
The machine also has a `Policy-Pass` work account in `gh`. **The two must never mix.**

## Required identity for this repo

- Author name: `adzza`
- Author email: `39549273+adzza@users.noreply.github.com`
- Remote `origin`: `https://github.com/adzza/guardium-dns.git`
- Local credential helper for `https://github.com` resolves via `gh auth token -u adzza`

## Verify before every commit

```bash
git config --local user.name        # MUST be: adzza
git config --local user.email       # MUST be: 39549273+adzza@users.noreply.github.com
git remote get-url origin           # MUST contain: adzza/guardium-dns
```

If any check fails, fix **locally only** — never with `--global`:

```bash
git config user.name "adzza"
git config user.email "39549273+adzza@users.noreply.github.com"
```

## Forbidden in this repo

- `git config --global ...` — would touch the Policy-Pass default.
- `gh auth setup-git` — installs a global credential helper that can leak Policy-Pass creds.
- `gh repo create` under any owner other than `adzza`.
- Authoring commits as `Adam Hucker` or `devops@policypass.education`.
- Switching `gh auth switch` to Policy-Pass and pushing from there.

## If a commit slips through as Policy-Pass

Amend before push (nothing public yet) — never force-push to remote `main` afterwards:

```bash
git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit
```

## Pushing

The local credential helper handles auth automatically:

```bash
git push origin HEAD
```

The active `gh` account does not matter — the helper always pulls the adzza token.
After any work, ensure `gh auth status` still shows Policy-Pass as Active so other
projects on this machine are unaffected: `gh auth switch -u Policy-Pass`.
