# TypeScript Guidelines

## General TypeScript Guidelines

- Always use types from the @slack/web-api package when available
- Follow TypeScript best practices like explicit return types
- Avoid any type unless absolutely necessary
- Use interfaces instead of types for object definitions
- Prefer explicit member accessibility (public, private)
- Use strict boolean expressions
- Properly handle Promise returns and potential errors

## TypeScript Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Limit line length to 100 characters
- Use trailing commas in multiline objects and arrays
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators
- Explicitly handle Promise rejections and errors
- **Minimize comments:** Write clear, self-documenting code. Avoid comments that restate the obvious. Use comments only for complex logic or non-obvious choices.

## Configuration

TypeScript is configured in `tsconfig.json` with strict type checking. Key settings include:
- ES2022 target
- Node.js module resolution
- Strict null checks
- Consistent casing in imports
