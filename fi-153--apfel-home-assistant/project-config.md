# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Git Policy

**Never commit code autonomously.** Always wait for the user to explicitly ask for a commit before running any `git commit`, `git add`, or `git push` commands.

## Project Overview

`apfel-home-assistant` is a wrapper around [apfel](https://github.com/Arthur-Ficial/apfel) that connects [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to Apple Intelligence's on-device foundation model. The goal is to let Home Assistant use Apple's free, local LLM (via apfel's OpenAI-compatible server on macOS) as its conversation/assist backend — no cloud, no API keys, no downloads. Distribution is planned via a Homebrew formula that wraps and configures apfel for the Home Assistant integration path.

## Build & Run

TODO — build, run, and install commands will be added once the wrapper implementation and Homebrew formula are scaffolded.

### Testing

TODO — testing approach to be decided.

### Linting

TODO — linting tools (e.g. `shellcheck` for scripts, `brew audit --strict` for the formula) to be added.

## Requirements

- **Platform:** macOS 26 Tahoe or newer, Apple Silicon (M1+) — inherited from apfel's requirements.
- **Dependency:** [apfel](https://github.com/Arthur-Ficial/apfel) installed and runnable (`apfel --serve`).
- **Runtime target:** Home Assistant instance (local or remote) capable of pointing at an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Architecture

TODO — high-level architecture to be written once the wrapper design is finalized. Expected shape: a thin launcher that starts `apfel --serve`, exposes the OpenAI-compatible endpoint on a stable host/port, and ships Home-Assistant-ready configuration (e.g. an `openai_conversation` integration snippet or a custom component). The Homebrew formula will declare apfel as a dependency and install the launcher plus a `brew services` plist.

## Key Patterns

TODO — project-specific conventions will be added as the codebase grows.

## Release Process

Releases are cut by pushing a `v*` tag. The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow
handles everything from there — no manual `gh release create`, no hand-edit of the
tap.

### Cutting a release
To release a new version and trigger the CI pipeline you must tag the release from `main` and
push to origin. The tag must point at a commit reachable from `main` — CI verifies this and
refuses to release otherwise.
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git tag v<X.Y.Z>
git push origin v<X.Y.Z>
```

## Planning Workflow

Whenever the user asks Claude to plan a task, Claude **must** write the plan as a `.md` file inside
`context/planning/` before doing any implementation work. File names must be descriptive kebab-case
(e.g., `add-metrics-extraction.md`). After writing the plan, Claude notifies the user of the file
path and waits for explicit approval before proceeding. The user may edit the plan file directly
using `/user <comment>` annotations; When new additions to the plan are made in response to comments
mark them with `/new`; Delete all the `/new` already present in a plan when updating or adding the
todo list; implementation begins only after the user explicitly approves; Plans are committed to
git alongside code for documentation purposes and are never deleted.

**Asking Questions** ALWAYS ask any clarifying questions you need and avoid assumptions unless
asked otherwise.

**Important**: When writing a plan, include ONLY the architectural design and approach — no
implementation checklists or checkboxes. The user will ask for implementation steps separately
after approving the plan. Do not add execution details, step numbering, or checkbox lists unless
the user explicitly requests them.

**Single file per task**: The design spec and the implementation plan must live in the **same file**
in `context/planning/`. The design sections come first, followed by the implementation steps
appended below. Do not create separate files for the design and the plan.

Once a plan is approved and the user asks for implementation steps, Claude must append the
implementation checklist to the same plan file. After implementation begins, Claude must follow the
checklist in order, checking each box (`- [x]`) immediately upon completing the corresponding task.

### Plan file format

```markdown
# Plan: <Descriptive Title>

> **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
> **Scope**: <what this plan covers>
> **Prerequisite**: <any plans or work that must be done first>

---

## Context

<Why this work is needed. What exists today. What gap this fills.>

---

## Overview

<High-level architecture diagram (ASCII or Mermaid) showing components and data flow.>

---

## Design

<Detailed design: new modules, classes, methods, data models, protocols.
Reference existing code patterns where relevant.>

---

## Edge Cases & Constraints

<Known limitations, error scenarios, performance considerations.>
```

### Comment and annotation conventions

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `/user <comment>` | User-written feedback inside the plan file |
| `/new` | Marks new content added in response to `/user` comments |
| `- [ ]` | Implementation step (added only after user asks for steps) |
