2. ElevenLabs STT transcribes speech to text
3. Claude LLM extracts structured intent:
   - Service type (haircut, dinner, appointment, etc.)
   - Party size (1-10 people)
   - Requested date/time
   - Location (optional)
4. Generates confirmation message
5. TTS speaks confirmation
6. Listens for user confirmation ("yes" or "no")

**Input**: User voice input

**Output**:
- Intent object with extracted details
- User confirmation (yes/no/restart)

**Example**:
```
User: "I want to book a table for 2 people at an Italian restaurant next Friday at 7 PM"

Extracted Intent:
{
    "service_type": "italian restaurant",
    "party_size": 2,
    "requested_time": "2024-11-22 19:00",
    "location": "current location"
}

System: "So you want to book a table for 2 people at an Italian restaurant
         next Friday at 7 PM. Is that correct?"

User: "Yes"
```

**Technology**:
- ElevenLabs STT for transcription
- Claude LLM for intent extraction with structured output
- Natural language processing with fallback for unclear requests

**Error Handling**:

   - Asks driver for alternative time (up to 3 retries)
   - Example: "You're busy at that time. What time would work better?"
   - Listens for new time
   - Re-checks calendar with new time
   - Repeats until available slot found or max retries reached

**Input**:
- Requested time from Intent Parser
- Current session state

**Output**:
- Availability status (free/busy)
- Confirmed alternative time (if initially busy)

**Example Flow**:
```
Check 1: Friday 7 PM --> BUSY (already has dinner)

Ask: "You're busy at 7 PM. What time works better?"
User: "8 PM"

Check 2: Friday 8 PM --> FREE

Continue to Service Search
```

**Technology**:
- Google Calendar API v3 with service account auth
- RFC 3339 timestamp formatting
- Natural language date parsing with dateparser

## Agent Interaction Pattern

All agents follow this pattern:

```
Input (from previous agent or user)
   |
   v
Process (extract info, call API, generate message)
   |
   v
Voice Output (TTS speaks result)
   |
   v
Voice Input (Listen for response if needed)
   |
   v
Output (pass to next agent)
```

---

## Agent Communication Flow

```
User speaks "hiya"
   |
   v
Welcome --> Intent Parser --> Calendar Checker
                                  |
                        Service Searcher --> Service Selector
                                                |
                                Call Scripter --> Call Initiator
                                                |
                                Conversationalist --> Booking Finalizer
                                                |
                                Goodbye Agent --> Session Ends

If user says "no" or error occurs: May loop back to earlier agent
```

---

## Key Design Principles

1. **Every Message is Spoken**: All agents use TTS
2. **User Confirmation**: Critical steps ask for approval
3. **Graceful Error Handling**: Simple, user-friendly error messages
4. **Service-Agnostic**: Works with any business type
5. **Conversational**: Natural language throughout
6. **Zero Hardcoded Strings**: Claude LLM generates all messages

---

## Performance Metrics per Agent

| Agent | Duration | Technology |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Welcome | 2-3s | LLM + TTS |
| Intent Parser | 3-5s | STT + LLM |
| Calendar Checker | 1-2s | Google Calendar API |
| Service Searcher | 2-3s | Google Places API |
| Service Selector | 2-3s | LLM + User input |
| Call Scripter | 2-3s | LLM + TTS |
| Call Initiator | 2-5s | Twilio |
| Conversationalist | 30-60s | STT + LLM + TTS |
| Booking Finalizer | 3-5s | LLM + Calendar + TTS |
| Goodbye | 2-3s | LLM + TTS |
| **Total** | **50-90s** | Full booking |

---

## Security per Agent

- **Intent Parser**: Validates input before processing
- **Calendar Checker**: Uses read-only scope (Google Calendar)
- **Call Initiator**: Requires explicit user approval
- **Booking Finalizer**: Uses write scope only for confirmed bookings
- **All agents**: No PII logged to console
