# Emdash Skills for GitHub Copilot

Load CONVENTIONS.md for stack defaults. Load _router.md for skill routing.
14 categories (01-14), 94 reference docs, 18 agents.

## Stack

CF Workers+Hono | Angular 21+Ionic 8+PrimeNG 21 | D1/Neon | Drizzle v1 | Clerk | Stripe | Inngest | Resend | Bun | Playwright v1.59+ | PostHog | Sentry

## Rules

- TypeScript strict, never `any`, prefer `interface` over `type`
- Hono inline handlers for RPC type inference
- Zod validation on all inputs
- TDD: failing test first, Playwright 6 breakpoints
- Dark-first design, #060610 bg, #00E5FF accent
- Deploy to CF Workers, purge CDN after every deploy

See CONVENTIONS.md for full patterns.
