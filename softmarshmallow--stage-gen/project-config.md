Repository-specific guardrails. [README.md](README.md) owns setup, [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) boundaries,
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) contribution policy, and [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md) gates. Focused procedures
live in [providers](docs/providers.md), [publication](docs/generated-media-publication.md), [storage](docs/repository-storage.md),
and [IP](docs/oss-ip.md). This file controls applicability; focused docs control procedure and must be reconciled on conflict.

## Architecture

- Keep identifiers, comments, logs, tests, and user-facing source strings in English.
- Python is the sole headless implementation, split in two: `src/gnode/` is the ringed asset-graph
  SDK and `src/stage_gen/` is the application that consumes it. gnode's rings (`docs/spec/gnode-rings.md`):
  ring 0 the agnostic engine core (topology, scheduling, trace, run view, model bindings, reliability,
  provenance — media-free), ring 1 per-modality model specs and retry-owning services, ring 2 first-party
  provider adapters. A ring imports only rings below it; nothing game-, recipe-, or genre-specific belongs
  in any ring, and the engine ships no brand — provenance identities come from the application. Consumers
  import only declared surfaces (`from gnode import X`; provider adapters via `gnode.providers.<name>`);
  gnode imports no application package; a contract test enforces all of it. Providers
  implement the ring-1 protocols, and orchestration is the composition root. Shared recipe-neutral media
  inspection and transforms belong in `media`; capability-specific processing stays with its component, and
  recipe-specific canonicalization with its recipe.
- Recipes own generation-specific genre, composition, layout, artifact, and validation assumptions; consumer adapters
  own runtime camera, scene, engine, and gameplay assumptions. Neither may leak them into generic components. `web/`
  consumes public headless CLI and manifest contracts; it is not a second generator.
- `docs/spec/game/generation-pipeline.md` is the canonical human overview of the game-generation graph. Changes to
  recipe stages, asset fan-out or dependencies, input composition, provider operation counts, cache/manifest boundaries,
  or scheduling semantics must update that document and its executable graph contract in the same change.

## Schema naming

- Schema definitions and persisted/public contract fields use `lower_snake_case`; do not add camelCase aliases for
  convenience. Translate to language-native runtime shapes only at explicit adapters or boundaries. Preserve mandatory
  external-standard vocabulary exactly, including JSON Schema `$ref`, `$defs`, and `additionalProperties`.

## Provider and artifact safety

- Provider routes are declared in a `gnode` binding table as `model@provider` with the features each route supports;
  a missing feature is refused while planning, offline, before any spend. Do not name a model inside a node's logic.
- Each AI/provider operation has one retry owner and at most six attempts: one initial plus five retries with capped
  backoff. Keep transport, decoding, schema/media checks, and caller validation inside it; disable nested retry loops.
- Mark artifacts successful only after validation and rollback-safe atomic artifact-plus-sidecar persistence. Cache
  reuse must validate content and lineage, not merely path existence.
- Use the existing allowlisted provider-key loader. Treat `.env` as optional and local; never assume it is populated,
  overwrite, print, or commit it, or copy provider secrets into `web/`. `.env.example` owns non-secret defaults.
- Offline operation is the default. Live/provider calls require explicit task intent and documented opt-in. Re-check current provider contracts before changing adapters or model identifiers.
- Pipeline run artifacts require canonical portable provenance, because the manifest, cache, and consumers read it.
  A figure or capture authored for the docs is not a pipeline artifact and gets none. Never persist credentials,
  authorization headers, signed URLs, embedded references, private absolute or temporary paths. Confine writes and
  reject traversal or symlink escapes.

## Media and rights

- Use canonical fixtures in place. Copy only across a real package, build, deployment, or public-consumer ownership
  boundary; preserve provenance and rights, do not symlink across it, and never promote unreviewed output into fixtures.
- Prompts, examples, fixtures, and committed media must be original and brand-neutral. Referenced inputs need a
  documented rights basis; source licensing does not grant media redistribution.
- Accepted generated visuals require semantic review by someone other than their producer. Reference inspection and
  exploration do not; label exploration unreviewed. Audio quality claims need a separate listening verdict.
  Semantic regeneration runs are not provider retries.
- Generated media published as art is unapproved by default. Follow publication and storage gates before commit or
  publication; public binding, activation, or publication requires explicit authorization. The gate covers the declared
