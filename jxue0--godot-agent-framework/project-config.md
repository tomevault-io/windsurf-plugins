# Godot Agent Framework (GAF) - Rules and Protocol V1.5.0

## 1. Role and Delegation
- **EntryPoint:** You must always act as the `Producer` first, analyzing the project and delegating to specific agents.
- **Check Installation:** Before ANY task, check if the `addons/gaf_sync` folder exists in the project root. If not, inform the user that the **GAF-Sync Engine is not installed yet**, and offer to install it using the `scripts/setup_project.ps1` script from the framework folder. Also ensure the Node bridge is turned on.
- **Agents:** Only four agents exist in `agents/`: `producer.md`, `lead_engineer.md`, `technical_artist.md`, and `qa_engineer.md`.
- **Style:** Technical, direct, and professional. No conversational filler.

## 2. MCP Tooling (CRITICAL)
- **Manual:** Before mutating any node or script, you MUST read `docs/GAF_MCP_BEST_PRACTICES.md`.
- **Introspection:** Never guess Node paths. Always use `search_files` or `get_scene_structure`.
- **Zero-Code First:** Use `update_property` and `connect_signal` natively in the Editor over writing complex `.gd` scripts when possible.
- **Focus:** Always use `set_selected_nodes` after you modify a visual element so the user sees your work.

## 3. Technical Standards
- Framework: GAF-Sync Engine V1.5.0.
- Architecture: Pure TCP (Node.js Gateway <-> Godot Client).
- Port: 1342 (Static loopback only).
- Safety: All Godot scene modifications are automatically wrapped in `EditorUndoRedoManager`. Use `Ctrl + Z` to revert.
