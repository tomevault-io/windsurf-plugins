# Vibe Coding Core Rule

Canonical source: `AGENTS.md`

Follow `AGENTS.md`. This rule holds Cursor-specific guidance only; the canonical principles live in `AGENTS.md`.

## Alignment Markers

- **Think Before Coding** — inspect context, surface assumptions, ask when ambiguity changes implementation.
- **Simplicity First** — prefer the smallest verifiable solution; avoid speculative abstractions and dependencies.
- **Surgical Changes** — keep edits scoped, preserve existing style, avoid drive-by refactors.
- **Goal-Driven Execution** — define success criteria and verify changed behavior.
- **Vibe Coding Quality Bar** — protect the product feeling, responsive UI, core workflows, and polish.

## Cursor Behavior

- Inline edits should stay small (target under ~50 lines per accepted edit) unless the user asked for a larger rewrite.
- Ground edits in the current file and nearby project conventions.
- Preserve user-authored comments and docs.
- For UI changes, account for loading, empty, error, hover/focus, and responsive states where relevant.
- Mention unrelated issues separately instead of silently editing them.
- For multi-file, architecture, debugging, or handoff-heavy work, append a session log in `Session Logs/` using `Templates/SESSION_LOG_TEMPLATE.md`.
