- Use TypeScript strict mode.
- Preserve Hexagonal Architecture boundaries:
  - domain: no imports from frameworks (Express/Fastify/Prisma/Swagger/Zod).
  - application: depends only on domain + ports.
  - adapters: depend on ports/application.
  - infra: framework/bootstrap/Prisma client.
- Keep HTTP swap (express/fastify) via env HTTP_ADAPTER.
- Always return JSON { data } on success and { error } on failure.
