# Agent Development Guide

This file is for [guiding Ai coding agents](https://agents.md/) through the
Sono Codebase.

## Project Overview

Sono is a cross-platform local music player built with Flutter and Dart. It plays
music from the device's own library with no streaming, or any other online
dependencies. Audio playback runs on media_kit/mpv with `aduio_service` for the
OS media session.

Android is the primary target. Linux, Windows and iOS (unsigned) are secondary targets.

The repo is `appsono/sono-new` (on GitHub), application is `wtf.sono`. It is a rewrite
of an earlier Sono, so the codebase assumes there is a solid foundation of Flutter
knowledge available. A companion native plugib, `sono_query` (`appsono/sono_query`),
handles MediaStore scanning, metadata read/write, and cover thumbnail extraction.
It is pinned by git ref in `pubspec.yaml`.

## Project Structure

```md
lib/
├── db/ # drift database schema and generated code
├── helper/ # small utility functions
├── l10n/ # localization and translations (ARB)
├── pages/ # app pages (home, library, search, settings, etc.)
├── services/ # audio engine, scanner, widget bridge, Discord RPC, etc.
├── utils/ # utils reused across multiple files
├── theme/ # tokens, icons, theme config
└── widgets/ # reusable UI components
```

The audio stack lives in `lib/services/audio/` and is presumably the most complex
part of the codebase. So be careful changing anything there and make sure
everything get's tested.

Design tokens live in `lib/theme/tokens.dart` (`SonoColors`, `SonoSizes`, `SonoFonts`).
The icon system is `IconsSheet` in `lib/theme/icons.dart`. The Drift schema is
`lib/db/tables.dart` with generated output beside it.

## Commands

### Core Commands

- `flutter pub get` - Install dependencies
- `flutter run --flavor dev` - Run in dev mode on a connected device or emulator
- `flutter run --flavor prod` - Run in production mode
- `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` - Regenerate Drift
  code after any change to `lib/db/tables.dart` (or `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`)
- `dart run scripts/compute_translation_progress.dart` - Recompute translation progress
  (CI runs this before every build).
  NOT REQUIRED TO RUN - Unless there is a need for up-to-date translation progress

### Building

- `flutter build apk --debug --flavor dev` - Debug APK (CI builds this on PRs)
- `flutter build apk --release --flavor prod` - Signed release APK
- `flutter build appbundle --release --flavor prod` - Signed App Bundle
- `flutter build linux --release` - Linux bundle
- `flutter build windows --release` - Windows bundle
- `flutter build ipa` - iOS App Bundle (REQUIRES Xcode)

Flavors are `dev` and `prod`

### Testing

- `flutter test` - Run all tests
- `flutter test <path/to/test.dart>` - Run a single test file

When a test fails, run only that file until it passes, then run the full suite again
to make sure nothing else broke. OR if you want to annoy the user run all the tests
every time >:D

### Linting & Formatting

- `dart analyze` - Static analysis (uses `flutter_lints`)
- `dart fromat .` - Format the codebase. Unformatted code fails CI
  (`dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .`)

## Code Conventions

- Never hard-code visual values. Use `SonoColors`, `SonoSizes`, and `SonoFonts`.
  No raw `Color(...)` or `Colors.*` in widget code. Brand-specific colors
  get their own named token (for example `SonoBrandColors.kofiBg`).
- Use icons from `IconsSheet` only. Do not introduce Material icons, and make clear
  to the user that the icon is missing and was temp-replaced by a Material icon!!
- Reuse before recreating. Search the codebase first and use existing shared widgets
  (`SonoListRow`, `SonoHeader`, `SonoStickyHeader`, `BouncyTap`, `BottomModalSheet`,
  `SongSheet`, `HeaderCard`, etc.) instead of duplicating them. The `Sono`
  prefix is for shared widgets only.
- Read the actual files before writing code. Do not guess API names,
  icon names, or widget signatures.
- Drift's `Value` collides with Flutter's `Column`.
  Import it narrowly: `import 'package:drift/drift.dart' show Value;`.
- Doc comments are plain text! No markdown inside comments, ever!
- Use `// ==== section ====` dividers to group code.
- No em dashes anywhere in code, comments, commits, or changelog entries.
- Sono is local-library first. There is no strea,ing paradigm. Songs use
  `commonLike` / `comoonLiked`; albums and artists use `commonFavorite` / `commonFavorited`.
  There is no "save to library" or "follow artist".
- Prefer `displayTitle` over `title` for folder-grouped albums.

### Localization

- Every user-facing string goes through `AppLocalization.of(context).<key>`.
  Never hard-code one.
- ARB keys are camelCase and scoped: `<scope><Subscope><Name>` (`common*`,
  `nav*`, `home*`, `library*`, `player*`, etc.)
- Add new keys to `lib/l10n/translations/sono_en.arb` with a matching `<@key>`
  description. `sono_en.arb` is the canonical key order.
- Only add keys for UI that actually exists.
- NEVER translate other locals

### Commits, Changelog & Versioning

- Conventional commits, lowercase, terse, no em dashes(!)
- `CHANGELOG.md` follows Keep a Changelog 1.1.0 with human-readable prose under
