# Contributing conventions for agami-core

This file is the "how to write it" for **agami-core** — read by Claude Code (automatically, every
session) and by human contributors. It's **guidance**; the things that can be machine-checked are
enforced by the gates, not by this doc:

- style / naming → **ruff** (CI + the local hooks)
- secrets / real credentials → **gitleaks** (CI + the local hooks)
- structure / real-data fixtures → **`/code-review`** + maintainer review (CODEOWNERS)

So this doc raises the floor; the gates catch the enforceable parts. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the
full local-setup walkthrough.

## Dev workflow

The only thing to install is [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Everything else is fetched on
demand by `uvx`, the same on macOS / Linux / Windows. From the repo root:

```bash
uv run dev.py setup     # once: wire the local pre-commit hooks
uv run dev.py check     # ruff + tests + gitleaks — the same checks CI gates on
uv run dev.py cover     # did the lines I changed get tested? (patch coverage)
```

Run `uv run dev.py check` before you push. **CI is the real, unbypassable gate** (`.github/
workflows/ci.yml`); the local hooks are convenience.

## Code conventions

- **Match the surrounding code.** Its naming, comment density, and idioms are the spec.
- **Naming:** `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes, `UPPER_CASE` for
  constants (PEP 8). ruff enforces the mechanical parts.
- **Functions do one thing.** Prefer small, single-purpose functions over deep branching.
- **Type-annotate signatures.** Public functions take and return typed values.
- **Comments explain _why_, not _what_.** The code says what; a comment earns its place by saying
  why — the non-obvious constraint, the edge case, the reason it isn't the simpler thing.
- **No network egress in shipped scripts.** `tests/test_privacy_no_network.py` is a contract; new
  egress fails the build. Everything runs locally on the user's machine.

## Customer-safety rules (this is a public repo)

agami-core is public. **No real customer data, names, or credentials — anywhere**: code, comments,
tests, docstrings, fixtures, sample data, or docs.

- **Never branch on a customer:** no `if customer == "...":`. Behavior is configured by the model,
  never hard-coded per customer.
- **Use neutral placeholders:** `acme` / `demo` for orgs, `you@example.com` for emails,
  `your-cluster…` for hosts, `SALES_DATA` for schemas. Never a real name, dataset, or address.
- **Never commit a secret.** No API keys, tokens, passwords, or connection strings with real
  credentials. `gitleaks` scans every commit and PR; treat a hit as a stop-the-line event.
- This is **pattern-based, with no denylist** — we don't keep a list of customer names to scan for
  (that list would itself be the leak). Write clean by default.

## Tests

- **New behavior comes with tests.** Add them under `tests/` as `test_<thing>.py`, following the
  existing self-contained style (`pytest.importorskip(...)`, `sys.path` to the scripts dir).
- **Check your change is covered:** `uv run dev.py cover` reports coverage of just the lines your
  branch touched and fails on untested ones — independent of overall coverage.
- **Coverage is measured, not yet floored.** The suite currently sits around the mid-70s%; a
  `--cov-fail-under` floor will be added in `pyproject.toml` once the baseline is locked, and it
  will be the single source of that number (don't hard-code a different one here).

## Proposing a substantial change

For anything beyond a small fix, a short written spec keeps the change reviewable. Cover these
seven points (briefly — a paragraph each is plenty):

1. **Goal** — the one thing this change achieves.
2. **Acceptance criteria** — how we know it's done (decidable checks).
3. **Public interface** — the functions / CLI / files it adds or changes.
4. **Test plan** — what tests prove it, including edge cases.
5. **Customer-safety check** — confirm no real names/data/credentials (per the rules above).
6. **Docs impact** — what README / CONTRIBUTING / this file needs updating.
7. **Out of scope** — what this change deliberately does *not* do.
