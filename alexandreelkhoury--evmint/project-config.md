# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with host access for external connections
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally

## Production Deployment

This app is production-ready and optimized for deployment to:
- **Firebase Hosting**: Fast CDN delivery with excellent caching

### Build Requirements
- Run `npm run build` to create optimized production build in `dist/` folder
- Ensure `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID` environment variable is configured for target environment
- Test locally with `npm run preview` before deployment
- All unused dependencies and files have been removed for optimal bundle size

## Project Architecture

This is a React TypeScript application built with Vite that creates a token launcher interface for the Base blockchain. Key architectural components:

### Core Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for complex UI animations and transitions
- **Routing**: React Router DOM with route-based page structure

### Web3 Integration
- **Wallet Connection**: Privy for authentication and embedded wallets
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Wagmi v2 + Viem for Web3 operations
- **Network**: Configured for Base mainnet and Base Sepolia testnet
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for async state

### Provider Architecture
The app uses a nested provider pattern:
```
PrivyProvider (auth) 
  → QueryClientProvider (data fetching)
    → WagmiProvider (Web3)
      → Router (navigation)
```

### Configuration
- Web3 configuration is centralized in `src/config/web3.ts`
- Privy app ID can be configured via `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID` environment variable
- Supports both Base mainnet and testnet chains

### Page Structure
- `/` - HomePage: Landing page with hero section
- `/create` - CreateTokenPage: Token creation form with animated UI
- `/tokens` - TokensPage: Token management interface  
- `/liquidity` - LiquidityPage: Liquidity management
- `/guide` - GuidePage: User documentation

### Component Patterns
- Heavy use of Framer Motion variants for consistent animations
- Glassmorphism design with backdrop blur effects
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Form validation and loading states with visual feedback

## Key Dependencies
- `@privy-io/react-auth` and `@privy-io/wagmi` for wallet integration
- `wagmi` v2 with `viem` for Ethereum interactions
- `framer-motion` for animations (used extensively throughout UI)
- `@tanstack/react-query` for server state management

## Uniswap V2 Integration
The app integrates with Uniswap V2 for liquidity management on Base network:

### Core Features
- **Add Liquidity**: Two-step process (approve → add) with comprehensive transaction monitoring
- **Remove Liquidity**: Two-step process (approve LP tokens → remove) with automatic balance detection
- **LP Token Management**: Automatic storage and retrieval of LP token addresses for easy withdrawal
- **Transaction Safety**: Proper slippage protection and minimum amount calculations

### Base Network Contracts
- **Base Mainnet**: Production deployment
  - UniswapV2Factory: `0x8909Dc15e40173Ff4699343b6eB8132c65e18eC6`
  - UniswapV2Router: `0x4752ba5dbc23f44d87826276bf6fd6b1c372ad24`
  - WETH: `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006`

- **Base Sepolia**: Not supported (Uniswap V2 not deployed on Base Sepolia)

### Implementation Guidelines
- All liquidity operations use wagmi's `useWriteContract` with async patterns
- Proper error handling with categorized error types (USER_REJECTED, GAS_ERROR, etc.)
- Transaction receipts are parsed to extract LP token addresses automatically
- LP tokens are stored in localStorage for easy access in withdrawal flows
- Minimum amounts calculated dynamically based on pool state to prevent MEV attacks

### Transaction Flow
1. **Add Liquidity**: Select tokens → Set amounts → Approve → Add → Success modal with DEXScreener link
2. **Remove Liquidity**: Select LP token → Set amount → Approve LP → Remove → Success modal with transaction link

## Development Notes
- Uses strict TypeScript configuration with separate app and node configs
- ESLint configured with React hooks and TypeScript rules
- Vite optimized for Web3 dependencies with specific exclusions for `@base-org/account`
- No test framework currently configured

## UI/UX Design Guidelines
Following established design principles for optimal user experience:

### Design System
- **Consistent Animations**: All components use Framer Motion variants from `src/styles/designSystem.ts`
- **Glass Morphism**: Primary design language with backdrop blur effects and subtle borders
- **Color Palette**: Blue/purple/cyan gradients with dark theme base (gray-900)
- **Typography**: Hierarchical system with gradient text for emphasis
- **Spacing**: 8px base unit with consistent padding/margin patterns

### Navigation
- **Desktop**: Horizontal navigation with icons and hover states
- **Mobile**: Slide-down menu with smooth animations and touch-friendly targets
