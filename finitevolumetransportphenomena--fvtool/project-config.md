# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

FVTool is a finite-volume PDE toolbox for MATLAB/Octave. It discretizes and solves the general transient
convection-diffusion equation

```
alpha * d(phi)/dt + div(u*phi) + div(-D grad phi) + beta*phi + gamma = 0
```

with Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin/periodic boundary conditions, on 1D/2D/3D Cartesian, cylindrical, radial, and
spherical grids. Pure MATLAB `.m` files — no build step, no package manager, no compiled artifacts.

## Running things

There is no build or lint. Everything runs inside MATLAB or Octave (>= 4.0, needs `classdef`).

- **Set up the path (do this first, every session):** run `FVToolStartUp` from the repo root. It `addpath`s all
  code directories and optionally detects the AGMG/Factorize solvers and the PVT toolbox if present.
- **Run the test suite:** `Tests/FVTool_functions_uniform_test.m` and `Tests/FVTool_functions_nonuniform_test.m`
  are scripts that exercise the discretization functions across all mesh types; `Tests/readme_test.m` runs the
  README example. Run a test by executing the script (e.g. `run Tests/FVTool_functions_uniform_test`). There is
  no per-function test runner — tests are scripts, not a framework.
- **Learn the API by example:** `Examples/Tutorial/` has focused single-equation demos; `Examples/Advanced/`
  has coupled/nonlinear reservoir-engineering solvers. `FVTdemo.m` is a large annotated walkthrough.

## Architecture

### The solve pattern
Every solution follows the same assembly pipeline. Understand this and the whole library follows:

1. **Create a mesh** — `createMesh2D(Nx,Ny,Lx,Ly)`, `createMeshCylindrical3D(...)`, etc. Returns a
   `MeshStructure`.
2. **Create variables on the mesh** — `createCellVariable` (values at cell centers, includes ghost cells),
   `createFaceVariable` / `createCellVector` (values at faces).
3. **Set boundary conditions** — `createBC(mesh)` returns a `BoundaryCondition` with per-boundary `a`, `b`, `c`
   arrays (default all-Neumann/zero-flux); edit `BC.left.a`, `BC.right.b`, etc.
4. **Assemble term matrices** — each PDE term is a function returning a sparse coefficient matrix `M` (and an
   RHS where relevant): `diffusionTerm`, `convectionTerm`/`convectionUpwindTerm`/`convectionTvdTerm`,
   `transientTerm`, `linearSourceTerm`, `constantSourceTerm`, and `boundaryCondition(BC)` -> `[Mbc, RHSbc]`.
5. **Sum matrices and RHS**, then `phi = solvePDE(mesh, M, RHS)`. `solvePDE` does `M\RHS` by default and
   reshapes the flat solution back into a `CellVariable` (with ghost cells). `solveExplicitPDE` for explicit steps.
6. **Visualize** — `visualizeCells(phi)`, `visualizeCellVectors(...)`.

Coefficient functions take face values, so cell-centered coefficients must first be interpolated to faces with
`harmonicMean` / `arithmeticMean` / `geometricMean` / `linearMean` / `upwindMean` / `tvdMean`.

### The mesh class hierarchy and geometry dispatch (most important internal pattern)
A mesh's geometry is described by **two explicit fields** on `MeshStructure`: an integer `dimension`
(`1|2|3`) and a string `coordsystem` (`'cartesian'|'cylindrical'|'radial'|'spherical'`). Concrete meshes are
subclasses — `Mesh1D/Mesh2D/Mesh3D` (Cartesian) and the curvilinear `MeshCylindrical1D/2D/3D`, `MeshRadial2D`,
`MeshSpherical1D/3D` — each set by the matching `createMesh*` function. (Historically these were encoded as a
single floating-point `dimension` code like `2.5`/`2.8`; that is gone — do **not** compare `dimension` against
fractional values.)

User-facing functions are thin dispatchers. `diffusionTerm.m`, `convectionTerm.m`, `divergenceTerm.m`,
`boundaryCondition.m`, etc. dispatch in one of two ways:
- **Geometry-specific ops** `switch geometryTag(mesh)` — a `MeshStructure` method returning `'1D'`, `'2D'`,
  `'Cylindrical2D'`, `'Radial2D'`, `'Spherical3D'`, etc. The tag equals the suffix of the real implementation
  file (`diffusionTermCylindrical2D.m`, `diffusionTermSpherical1D.m`, …), and every such switch has an
  `otherwise error('FVTool:unsupportedGeometry', ...)` so an unhandled geometry fails loudly instead of
  returning an unset variable.
- **Dimension-only ops** (means, reshaping, source/transient terms, `createBC`) `switch mesh.dimension` over
  `1|2|3` — they don't care about the coordinate system.

**When adding or fixing a discretization, edit the geometry-specific `*1D/2D/3D/Cylindrical*/Radial*/Spherical*`
file and make sure the dispatcher's `switch geometryTag(...)` has the matching case.** The set of implemented
geometries varies per operator — check which specific files exist before assuming a geometry is supported. To
add a whole new geometry, add a `MeshStructure` subclass + a `createMesh*` constructor, then add its
`geometryTag` case to each dispatcher.

### Operator overloading
`CellVariable`, `FaceVariable`, and `CellVector` are `classdef` types under `Classes/@.../`. Arithmetic and
comparison operators (`plus`, `minus`, `times`, `rdivide`, `power`, `gt`, `le`, ...) are overloaded per class
so 1D-shaped user code carries over unchanged to 2D/3D. The overloads operate on the `.value` field and return
