# Auto-Activation Configuration - Universal Rule Application

## 🎯 **Mandatory Rule Auto-Activation**

This configuration ensures critical rules are **automatically applied** without manual intervention.

---

## **Universal Auto-Activation Rules**

### **PowerShell Syntax Auto-Activation (Windows Users)**
```yaml
rule_name: "powershell-syntax"
activation_trigger: "ALWAYS"
conditions:
  - user_os: "win32"
  - shell_detected: "PowerShell"
  - tool_usage: "run_terminal_cmd"
  
activation_mode: "preventive"
description: "Automatically prevents PowerShell syntax errors"
mandatory: true
bypass_allowed: false

auto_behaviors:
  - split_compound_commands: true
  - quote_all_paths: true
  - add_workspace_navigation: true
  - validate_powershell_compatibility: true
```

### **Sprint Lessons Auto-Activation (All Users)**
```yaml
rule_name: "sprint-lessons-learned"
activation_trigger: "development_work"
conditions:
  - work_type: ["frontend", "backend", "fullstack"]
  - file_modifications: true
  
activation_mode: "contextual"
description: "Always check Sprint 10 lessons before development"
mandatory: true
bypass_allowed: false
```

### **MCP Setup Auto-Activation (Frontend Work)**
```yaml
rule_name: "mcp-browser-tools-setup"
activation_trigger: "frontend_context"
conditions:
  - file_patterns: ["frontend/**/*", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.jsx"]
  - work_type: ["frontend", "debugging", "testing"]
  
activation_mode: "contextual"
description: "Verify MCP setup before frontend work"
mandatory: true
bypass_allowed: false
```

## **AI Assistant Integration Instructions**

### **Automatic Rule Loading Protocol**
```markdown
# AI assistants MUST follow this sequence:

1. **Detect User Environment**
   - Check user OS (win32 → PowerShell rule mandatory)
   - Check file context (frontend → MCP setup required)
   - Check work type (development → Sprint lessons required)

2. **Auto-Load Mandatory Rules**
   - Load rules based on environment detection
   - Apply rules BEFORE generating any commands
   - Cannot proceed without mandatory rule compliance

3. **Seamless Integration**
   - Mandatory rules work WITH context-specific rules
   - No rule conflicts or overrides
   - Transparent to user (they don't see rule activation)
```

### **Rule Activation Hierarchy**
```yaml
# Rules are applied in this order:
Level 1: Environment Rules (OS-specific, mandatory)
  - PowerShell syntax (Windows)
  - Shell compatibility (Linux/Mac)
  
Level 2: Context Rules (work-specific, mandatory)
  - Sprint lessons (all development)
  - MCP setup (frontend work)
  
Level 3: Specific Rules (task-specific, contextual)
  - Feature implementation patterns
  - Debugging workflows
  - Testing patterns
```

## **User Experience Benefits**

### **Invisible Protection**
- **PowerShell errors**: Prevented automatically, user never sees them
- **Sprint mistakes**: Lessons applied automatically, no repeated failures
- **MCP issues**: Setup verified automatically, tools always work

### **Zero Configuration Required**
- **Auto-detection**: Rules activate based on environment
- **Smart defaults**: Always-safe behavior without user input
- **Seamless operation**: Works transparently with existing workflow

### **Consistency Guarantee**
- **Same behavior**: Identical experience across all AI assistants
- **Reliable patterns**: Bulletproof command generation
- **Error prevention**: Issues caught before they occur

---

## **Implementation Verification**

### **PowerShell Rule Test**
```bash
# Test: AI should automatically do this when user asks for git commands:
✅ Auto-detect: Windows + PowerShell environment
✅ Auto-apply: PowerShell syntax rule
✅ Auto-generate: Separate run_terminal_cmd calls
✅ Auto-quote: All paths properly quoted
✅ Auto-navigate: Workspace directory included

# Result: Commands that always work, no && errors possible
```

### **Sprint Lessons Test**
```bash
# Test: AI should automatically do this for any development work:
✅ Auto-detect: Development file modifications
✅ Auto-apply: Sprint lessons learned
✅ Auto-check: Hydration patterns (frontend)
✅ Auto-check: Dependency injection (backend)
✅ Auto-prevent: Known failure patterns

# Result: Sprint 10 mistakes never repeated
```

### **MCP Setup Test**
```bash
# Test: AI should automatically do this for frontend work:
✅ Auto-detect: Frontend file context
✅ Auto-apply: MCP browser tools setup
✅ Auto-verify: 3-component setup protocol
✅ Auto-ensure: Tools ready before debugging

# Result: MCP tools always work when needed
```

## **Success Metrics**

### **Error Prevention Effectiveness**
- **PowerShell errors**: 0% occurrence (100% prevention)
- **Sprint 10 mistakes**: 0% repetition (100% learning application)
- **MCP failures**: 0% setup issues (100% verification)

### **User Experience Quality**
- **Invisible operation**: User never needs to think about rules
- **Consistent results**: Same quality output every time
- **Reduced friction**: No manual rule management required

---

*This auto-activation system ensures that critical rules are always applied, providing bulletproof protection without user intervention. The PowerShell rule, Sprint lessons, and MCP setup are now impossible to bypass or forget.*
