# Cursor AI Project Rules  

These project-specific rules ensure that all generated code is **well-documented, structured, and prevents repeated mistakes.**  

---

## Comment Handling Guidelines  

- **Preserve all existing comments**  
   - Never delete or overwrite existing comments.  
   - Only **append or modify** them to add new insights.  

- **Enhance documentation over time**  
   - If a file is modified, update its comments to reflect **why** and **how** changes were made.  
   - Document **new dependencies, optimizations, and potential pitfalls.**  

- **Explicit troubleshooting notes**  
   - When a bug is encountered **more than once**, insert a **clear warning comment** explaining:  
     - **The nature of the issue**  
     - **Why it happens**  
     - **How to fix or avoid it**  

---

## Troubleshooting & Debugging Best Practices  

### Recurring Bugs Prevention  
- If a bug is **fixed multiple times**, insert a **comment in the affected file** to prevent future reoccurrence.  
- Example format:  

```python
# WARNING: This function previously caused an off-by-one error due to X.
# Ensure that the index is correctly adjusted when modifying this section.

```
