# Node.js Version Requirement

This project requires **Node.js version 22** as specified in `package.json` under the `engines` field.

## Before Running Any Commands

Before executing any npm, node, or build commands, you MUST:

1. **Check the current Node version** by running `node --version`
2. **If the version is not 22.x**, instruct the user to switch to the correct version using:
   - `nvm use 22` (if using nvm)
   - `fnm use 22` (if using fnm)
   - Or any other version manager they prefer

## Sandbox Permissions

**IMPORTANT**: npm commands require special permissions to run correctly. The sandbox blocks npm from accessing node_modules and other required files.

When running ANY npm command, you MUST request the `network` permission:

- `npm install` - requires `network` permission (downloads packages from registry)
- `npm run build` - requires `network` permission (npm needs to access its own modules)
- `npm run watch` - requires `network` permission
- Any other `npm` command - requires `network` permission

**Never run npm commands without requesting permissions first**, as they will fail with EPERM errors.

## When Installing Dependencies or Running Scripts

Always remind the user to ensure they're using Node 22 before:

- Running `npm install`
- Running `npm run build`
- Running `npm run watch`
- Running any other npm scripts

## Example Workflow

```bash
# First, ensure correct Node version
nvm use 22  # or: fnm use 22

# Then proceed with commands (with network permission)
npm install
npm run build
```

## Reference

The Node version requirement is defined in `package.json`:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "22"
}
```
