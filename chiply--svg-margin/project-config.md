# svg-margin

Emacs Lisp package that turns the window margins into a multi-column SVG
gutter many independent providers can draw into (dots, bars, glyphs, custom
shapes), with per-line column packing, hover help and click actions.

## Build & Test

```sh
eask install-deps --dev   # install dependencies
eask compile              # byte compile
eask test ert test/svg-margin-test.el  # run tests
```

## Lint

CI runs all four linters. Run them all locally before pushing:

```sh
eask lint package
eask lint checkdoc
eask lint elisp-lint
eask lint relint
```

## Git Workflow

- Never push directly to `main` — always work on a feature branch
- Branch from `main` and open a PR for all changes
- Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) — release-please automates versioning
- Public symbols: `svg-margin-` prefix; private symbols: `svg-margin--` prefix
- Docstrings on all public functions and variables
- `;;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-` on every source file
- No AI/Claude attribution in commit messages or PR bodies

## Code Review Configuration

Used by the `/review-loop` skill.

### Pre-flight
- Compile: `eask compile`
- Lint: `eask lint package && eask lint checkdoc && eask lint elisp-lint && eask lint relint`
- Tests: `eask test ert test/svg-margin-test.el`

### Local Review
- Severity threshold: ignore "nitpick"
- Max iterations: 3

### CI
- Platform: GitHub Actions
- Expected workflows and jobs:
  - `CI / test` — runs on matrix: (ubuntu-latest + windows-latest) x (Emacs 29.4 + 30.2 + snapshot) = 6 jobs
  - `CI / lint` — runs on ubuntu-latest with Emacs 29.4
- All 7 jobs must pass before proceeding to remote review
- No known flaky tests (the `Set up Eask` step occasionally fails on a corrupt
  upstream binary download — re-run the failed job)

### Copilot Review
- Max iterations: 3
