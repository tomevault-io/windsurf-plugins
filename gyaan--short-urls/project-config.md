# Golang Best Practices for Web Crawler Project

## Code Organization and Structure

### Package Structure
- Use clear, descriptive package names
- Keep packages focused on a single responsibility
- Organize code into logical directories (cmd/, internal/, pkg/)

### File Naming
- Use snake_case for file names
- Group related functionality in the same file
- Separate interfaces from implementations when beneficial

## Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions
- Use `PascalCase` for exported functions, types, and constants
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for package-level constants
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose

### Function Design
- Keep functions small and focused (ideally < 50 lines)
- Use meaningful parameter and return names
- Return errors as the last return value
- Use `defer` for cleanup operations
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Error Handling
- Always check and handle errors explicitly
- Use `fmt.Errorf()` with `%w` verb for error wrapping
- Return errors up the call stack when appropriate
- Use custom error types for specific error cases
- Log errors with context when needed

### Concurrency Best Practices
- Use `sync.Map` for concurrent access (as in visitedLinks)
- Use buffered channels to prevent deadlocks
- Always close channels from the sender side
- Use `sync.WaitGroup` or channels for coordination
- Avoid goroutine leaks by ensuring proper cleanup

### Memory Management
- Use `defer` for resource cleanup
- Be mindful of goroutine memory usage
- Consider using object pools for frequently allocated objects
- Use pointers appropriately (avoid unnecessary copying)

## Web Crawler Specific Guidelines

### HTTP Handling
- Always close response bodies with `defer`
- Set appropriate timeouts for HTTP requests
- Handle different HTTP status codes appropriately
- Use context for request cancellation
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

### HTML Parsing
- Validate HTML structure before parsing
- Handle malformed HTML gracefully
- Use appropriate selectors for element extraction
- Consider using headless browsers for JavaScript-heavy sites

### URL Processing
- Validate URLs before processing
- Handle relative vs absolute URLs correctly
- Implement URL normalization
- Respect robots.txt and rate limiting

### Concurrency Control
- Limit the number of concurrent requests
- Implement rate limiting to be respectful to servers
- Use worker pools for controlled concurrency
- Monitor and log crawler performance

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing
- Write tests for all exported functions
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies (HTTP, file system)
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Integration Testing
- Test the full crawler workflow
- Use test servers for HTTP testing
- Verify concurrent behavior
- Test with realistic data

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks
- Use connection pooling for HTTP requests
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Monitor memory usage and goroutine count

### Resource Management
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Implement circuit breakers for external services
- Use context for cancellation
- Monitor and log resource usage

## Documentation

### Code Comments
- Write clear, concise comments for exported functions
- Use godoc format for package documentation
- Comment complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep comments up to date with code changes

### README and Documentation
- Maintain comprehensive README
- Document configuration options
- Provide usage examples
- Document known limitations

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize URLs before processing
- Implement proper error handling
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS when possible
- Implement proper TLS configuration
- Validate SSL certificates
- Be cautious with user-provided URLs

## Code Quality

### Linting and Formatting
- Use `gofmt` for code formatting
- Run `golint` and `golangci-lint`
- Follow Go style guide consistently
- Use `go vet` to catch common mistakes

### Version Control
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use feature branches for development
- Review code before merging

## Dependencies

### Module Management
- Use Go modules for dependency management
- Pin dependency versions appropriately
- Regularly update dependencies
- Audit dependencies for security issues
- Minimize external dependencies

### Vendor Management
- Vendor dependencies for reproducible builds
- Document dependency update process
- Use `go mod tidy` to clean up unused dependencies
