# Symmetric Learning

This is a python package holding utility functions and torch modules for symmetry constrained machine learning. The README should clear the structure of the project, which holds a Sphinx docs dir, and strcutures the python package into submodules: `nn`, `linalg`, `stats`, `utils`, and `models`. Each submodule has its corresponding test file in the /test directory.

## Design principles

1. As a design principle, users are **not** expected to reason about or manually handle cache invalidation, or fast-inference vs slow-training internals.
   - `eModule` behavior should work out-of-the-box across training/validation switches.
   - Saving and loading `eModule` checkpoints should preserve correct behavior without user-side cache-management workarounds.

## Coding contract (MUST)

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

Prefer inline code by default. Only abstract after the same logic is reused in multiple real call sites.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- Do not introduce helper functions, builder functions, wrapper methods, or utility classes that are used only once.
- Do not extract helpers only to reduce visual duplication or “organize” a constructor.
- Bad example: a single-use helper such as `build_dense_norm(...)` used in one module once. Inline that logic where it is needed.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- No duplicated error handling in class/function hierarchies. If error is checked by a third-party function, don't re-check it.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Functions used by a single class should be instance/static methods of that class not loose module-level functions.
- Preffer flat functional programming hierarchies. Small (possibly long) functions with inline comments defining sections.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Test contract (MUST)

If you modify the codebase, you must run tests to validate that your changes do not break existing functionality. Follow these guidelines when running tests:

1. Each function/module/model should have a **single** dedicated test function that validates its utility/behavior.
   - When adding new tests, follow this pattern: one test function per function/module/model.
2. When testing changes, run **module-specific tests first**.
   - For example, if a change is made to a function in `symm_learning.linalg.irrep_radii`, run the the corresponding test function: `pytest -q test/test_linalg.py::test_irrep_radii` first.
   - Only if user asks run the entire test suite, run all tests: `pytest -q test/`.
3. If you update documentation you dont need to run tests, but if you update docstrings you must run tests to validate that the docstring formatting.

## Docstring instructions

We construct the documentation using Sphinx and the autodoc extension, therefore:
    - Read the notation convetion in `.agent/math_notation.md` before writing docstrings for any function/module/model. Follow this convention in all docstrings.
    - Read `.agent/docstring_guidelines.md` before editing docstrings. In particular, preserve the existing local narrative and notation style unless the user explicitly asks for a broader rewrite.
    - Format all docstring math using reStructuredText (reST) syntax.
