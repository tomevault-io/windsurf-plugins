# AGENTS.md

Project rules for working on the Sudoku for KOReader plugin. These apply to
every session and every agent working in this repository.

## Planning

- Work is organized in milestones, tracked in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).
- Before implementing a milestone, plan it: break it into tasks, and list the
  open questions it raises.
- Resolve open questions with the user *before* writing code.
- A milestone is done only when all of its exit criteria pass.

## Test-first

- Always write tests before implementation, per milestone and per unit of
  work (e.g., per technique port).
- Start with failing tests, then implement, then make the tests green.
- Do not declare work done without green tests.

## Core library discipline

- `sudokuplus.koplugin/sudokuplus/core/` is pure Lua with **zero KOReader dependencies**
  (no `ui/`, no `UIManager`, no `Device`). It must be fully unit-testable
  headless.
- Keep it deterministic: inject randomness (PRNG) and time instead of using
  `os.time()` / `math.random` directly.
- KOReader-dependent code lives outside `sudokuplus/core/` (UI, storage, stats I/O).
- All private Lua modules use the process-global-safe `sudokuplus.*` namespace.
  Only KOReader's directly loaded `main.lua` and `_meta.lua` entrypoints remain
  at the plugin root; never add compatibility aliases for generic module IDs.

## Headless CI vs. UI test discipline

- Specs are split into two categories:
  1. **Pure-Lua core specs** (`tests/unit/sudoku_board_spec.lua`, `sudoku_technique_*.lua`, `sudoku_techniques_*.lua`, `sudoku_generator_*.lua`, `sudoku_solve_path_spec.lua`, `sudoku_util_spec.lua`, etc.): run in CI via standalone headless Busted without KOReader. **They must NEVER require `ui/` modules or KOReader runtime dependencies (`gettext`, `ffi/util`, `UIManager`, `Device`)**.
  2. **KOReader frontend specs** (`sudoku_l10n_spec.lua`, `sudoku_view_spec.lua`, `sudoku_statsview_spec.lua`, `sudoku_menu_spec.lua`): test UI widgets, localization, dialogs, and gestures under the KOReader testrunner (`./dev.sh test`).
- Frontend specs are a local gate only. GitHub CI runs the standalone core
  specs; it does not build KOReader from source.
- Whenever adding tests for UI mappings, formatters, or dialogs (e.g. `ui.techniques`, `ui.difficulties`), add them to `sudoku_l10n_spec.lua` or other frontend UI specs, never to pure core specs.
- `tests/spec-manifest.txt` is authoritative. Every `tests/unit/*_spec.lua`
  must appear exactly once as `core` or `frontend`; `./tools/spec_manifest.sh
  check` enforces completeness.
- Every frontend spec must install `sudoku_frontend_test_guard` before loading
  `commonrequire` or another KOReader module. Never bypass the per-spec
  `KO_HOME` wrapper or production-data path guard.

## Milestone exit criteria

Every milestone must end with all of:

1. Tests green (`./dev.sh test`),
2. `./dev.sh lint` clean (luacheck + stylua --check),
3. Emulator smoke check (if the milestone touches UI/runtime code),
4. Commit with a clear message.

## Lint and format

- Run `./dev.sh fmt` before committing; `./dev.sh lint` gates the milestone.
- Style is enforced by stylua (`.stylua.toml`, 4-space indent, 120 cols);
  do not hand-format around it.

## Porting rules

- The Lua core is a port of [rustoku](https://github.com/huangsam/rustoku)
  (MIT). Keep the pinned reference commit in README.md up to date and preserve
  attribution.
- Port its test data (HoDoKu examples) along with the techniques.
- The port extends rustoku with pattern metadata on solve steps to power the
  hint system; keep this divergence documented in PLAN.md.

## Repository layout

- `sudokuplus.koplugin/` — plugin source (deployed as-is to the device).
- `tests/unit/` — busted specs, symlinked into the (gitignored) koreader
  checkout's `spec/unit/` directory by the dev setup.
- `third_party/` — dev dependencies (koreader checkout, pinned rustoku clone),
  all gitignored.
- `tools/koreader-revision` — authoritative KOReader commit used by local
  frontend tests and emulator smoke.
