# Atomic CLI

## Overview

This project is a TUI application built on OpenTUI and powered in the backend by coding agent SDKs: OpenCode SDK, Claude Agent SDK, and Copilot SDK.

It works out of the box by reading and configuring `.claude`, `.opencode`, `.github` configurations for the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Copilot CLI coding agents and allowing users to build powerful agent workflows defined by TypeScript files.

## Tech Stack

- bun.js for the runtime
- TypeScript
- @clack/prompts for CLI prompts
- figlet for ASCII art
- OpenTUI for tui components
- OpenCode SDK
- Claude Agent SDK
- Copilot SDK

## Quick Reference

### Commands by Workspace

Default to using Bun instead of Node.js.

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` or `ts-node <file>`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`
- Use `bun test:coverage` instead of `jest --coverage` or `vitest --coverage`
- Use `bun lint` to run the linters
- Use `bun typecheck` to run TypeScript type checks
- Use `bun build <file.html|file.ts|file.css>` instead of `webpack` or `esbuild`
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` or `pnpm run <script>`
- Use `bunx <package> <command>` instead of `npx <package> <command>`
- Bun automatically loads `.env`, so don't use `dotenv`.

## Best Practices

- Avoid ambiguous types like `any` and `unknown`. Use specific types instead.

## Design Context

Refer to `.impeccable.md`

## Testing

Use `bun test` to run tests and make use of your testing-anti-patterns skill to write high quality tests. Here's an example of a simple test file:

```ts#index.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hello world", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

### AI Agent Integration

When using Bun’s test runner with AI coding assistants, you can enable quieter output to improve readability and reduce context noise. This feature minimizes test output verbosity while preserving essential failure information.
​
**Environment Variables**

Set any of the following environment variables to enable AI-friendly output:
`CLAUDECODE=1` - For Claude Code
`REPL_ID=1` - For Replit
`AGENT=1` - Generic AI agent flag

### Code Quality

- Frequently run linters and type checks using `bun lint` and `bun typecheck`.
- Avoid Any and Unknown types.
- Modularize code and avoid re-inventing the wheel. Use functionality of libraries and SDKs whenever possible.

## Debugging

You are bound to run into errors when testing. As you test and run into issues/edges cases, address issues in a file you create called `issues.md` to track progress and support future iterations. Delegate to the debugging sub-agent for support. Delete the file when all issues are resolved to keep the repository clean.

### Coding Agent Configuration Locations

Note: There are three main coding agents used in this repository: OpenCode, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot CLI. Each has specific configuration file locations. Their configurations may also differ in syntax and structure, so be sure to refer to the respective documentation for each agent when making changes:

1. OpenCode:
    - global:
        - Linux/MacOS: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.opencode` AND `~/.opencode`
        - Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\\.opencode`

2. Claude Code:
    - global:
        - Linux/MacOS: `~/.claude`
        - Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\\.claude`
    - local: `.claude` in the project directory

3. Copilot CLI:
    - global:
        - Linux/MacOS: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.copilot` AND `~/.copilot`
        - Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\\.copilot`
    - local: `.github` in the project directory

**Agent Skill Locations**
    - local:
        - `.agents/skills` (`.claude/skills` is a symlink to `.agents/skills`)
    - global:
      - `~/.agents/skills` for OpenCode and Copilot CLI
      - `~/.claude/skills` for Claude Code
