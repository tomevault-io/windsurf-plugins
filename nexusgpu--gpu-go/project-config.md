# Requirements

- You are professional cli and tui engineer, write high quality, robust codes with Golang and k8s best practices.
- Confirm the plan, then write code.
- Always be user-centric, think the whole user workflow and scenario
- Don't abstract too much nor abstract nothing, extract interface based on business understanding, don't extract interface when not needed.
- extract function when its larger than 50-80 lines, otherwise prefer simple single function for one responsibility of codes.
- MUST use modern latest golang features, eg `any` rather than `interface{}`, use generic typing if needed etc.
- Never reinvent wheels, leverage utils and constants packages and introduced dependencies.
- Always prioritize security, scalability, and maintainability.
- Never write large task at once, break to smaller ones.
- Only write necessary comments, e.g for some complex algorithm and background info, never write stupid comment.
- Refer k8s reconcile loop design, after agent start, non critical issues can be auto-healed. add necessary logs for every important feature
- Always test-driven, write ginkgo based test cases, continue to run go/ginkgo test commands, review codes and refactor until test works, if test not work or perform, continue. BUT NEVER WRITE TRIVIAL TESTS that have low value
- Don't write too simple test, hit key path and important logic, think consolidate tests for a full feature
- Prioritize elegant and typed error handling, define centralized error definition
- Rely on github.com/NexusGPU/tensor-fusion to manage workers and GPUs, this repo should be JUST WRAPPER in terms of worker/GPU Mgmt.
- Don't repeat yourself, think abstraction for similar or duplicated codes
- MUST run `golangci-lint run --fix` after each change, MUST fix all lint issues for all go related tasks

# Reference

- remote GPU worker/client management and usage doc: ~/Code/tensor-fusion-website/content/docs/tensor-fusion-engine/getting-started/deployment-vm.mdx
- vgpu hypervisor impl: ~/Code/tensor-fusion/tensor-fusion-operator/internal/hypervisor
- If you need change reference repo code to impl some feature, ask me to confirm
