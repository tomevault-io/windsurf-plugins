# Repository Guidance

This repository packages an AI review system for OpenStack projects. The
primary product is the review workflow, not the legacy generic style-guide
documentation.

## What Is Authoritative

When changing review behavior, distinguish between knowledge tiers and runtime
contracts:

1. `references/` for canonical snapshots of external coding standards and
   policy
2. `docs/quick-rules.md`, `docs/comprehensive-guide.md`, and `docs/knowledge/`
   for curated baseline and derived internal review knowledge
3. `prompts/teim-review-core.md`, `config/tool-profiles.json`, and
   `schemas/review-report-schema.json` for provider-neutral runtime behavior
   and report contracts
4. `agents/`, `skills/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `.cursor/rules/`, and
   `plugins/teim-review/` for tool-native adapters
5. `roles/`, `playbooks/`, `zuul.d/`, and `tools/` for execution glue

Do not update README or supporting docs to introduce runtime behavior that is
not encoded in the shared core, schema, adapters, or workflow glue.

## Runtime Contracts

Preserve these unless the change explicitly updates all dependent wiring and
tests in the same commit:

- plugin name `teim-review`
- marketplace identity `openstack-ai-style-guide`
- skill path `skills/teim-review/SKILL.md`
- orchestrator `agents/teim-review-agent.md`
- shared workflow `prompts/teim-review-core.md`
- semantic profiles `config/tool-profiles.json`
- review schema `schemas/review-report-schema.json`
- local output directory `.teim-review/`
- Zuul job `teim-code-review`

## Review-System Layout

```text
.agents/plugins/  Codex repo marketplace catalog
.cursor/rules/    Cursor-native project rules
.claude-plugin/   plugin metadata and marketplace catalog
config/           semantic model profile aliases
plugins/          Codex-native plugin bundles
prompts/          provider-neutral review workflow
agents/           operational review intent and orchestration
skills/           interactive entrypoints
schemas/          structured output contracts
tools/            report transforms and validators
roles/            Ansible implementation units
playbooks/        workflow orchestration
zuul.d/           CI job definitions
docs/             active docs plus legacy support content
references/       canonical external standards snapshots
```

## Knowledge Areas

- `references/` contains canonical external source snapshots.
- `docs/quick-rules.md` and `docs/comprehensive-guide.md` are curated baseline
  guides distilled from references and internal review knowledge.
- `docs/knowledge/` is the growing internal knowledge base for overlays,
  examples, and retrieval-oriented review material.
- `docs/checklists/` and `docs/templates/` are archived/legacy support areas.

## Known Review Exceptions

### Plugin manifest defaults

`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` intentionally omits explicit `agents_dir` and
`skills_dir` fields because Claude Code auto-discovers the default layout.

### Shared core first

When adding support for a new AI tool, put reusable workflow behavior in
`prompts/teim-review-core.md` first, then add a thin tool adapter. Do not fork
review logic across Claude, Codex, and Cursor files unless the difference is
truly tool-specific.

### Tool-native adapters

- Claude distribution uses `.claude-plugin/`, `agents/`, and `skills/`.
- Codex distribution uses `.agents/plugins/` and `plugins/teim-review/`.
  Codex interactive invocation is `$teim-review`.
- Cursor distribution uses `.cursor/rules/` and `cursor/`.

### Codex plugin mirrors

`plugins/teim-review/references/` contains install-safe mirrored copies of the
shared core files that the Codex plugin skill can read after installation. The
authoritative sources remain `prompts/teim-review-core.md` and
`config/tool-profiles.json`. If either source changes, update the mirrored
plugin references and tests in the same change.

### Ruff formatting

Python formatting issues that are enforced by ruff or pre-commit should not be
the focus of review findings. Review logic should prefer behavioral,
maintainability, and security issues.

### Embedded LiteLLM test credential

The hardcoded token in `zuul.d/jobs.yaml` is intentional for the internal test
environment. Do not flag it as a production secret leak.

## Testing Expectations

When changing the repo structure or wiring:

- keep helper-script unit tests green
- keep repo contract tests green
- update path references in jobs, roles, skills, and docs together
- keep the distinction between canonical references, derived knowledge, and
  runtime behavior explicit

Preferred local commands:

- `tox -e py3`
- `tox -e linters`

If `tox` is not installed locally, use `uvx tox ...` instead. `uvx` is the
preferred fallback for ad hoc verification in this repository.

When running multiple tox environments with `uvx tox`, use a comma-separated
env list in a single invocation, for example `uvx tox -e py3,linters`, rather
than launching multiple tox envs in parallel.

If a path move is intentional, update tests in the same change so the new
contract is explicit.
