# React Rules

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context

- For developing React components within Next.js using React 19
- Emphasizes modern patterns, performance, and maintainability
- Ensures proper component architecture and state management

## Requirements

### Component Architecture

- Use explicit imports instead of `import * as React from "react"`
- Implement proper component composition and separation of concerns
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Set `displayName` on complex components and contexts for better debugging

### React 19 Patterns

- Client components must start with `"use client"` directive at the top
- Server components require no directive; use `"use server"` for server actions
- Pass `ref` as standard prop in React 19; `forwardRef` is deprecated
- Use modern patterns for better performance and developer experience

### JSX and Rendering

- Use `{condition ? <Element /> : null}` for conditional rendering; avoid `&&`
- Destructure props and state for improved readability
- Use proper boolean props syntax (e.g., `<Button disabled />`)
- Avoid using array index as key; prefer stable, unique identifiers

### State Management

- Keep `useState` naming consistent (e.g., `[count, setCount]`)
- Use lazy initialization for expensive initial state computations
- Avoid calling state setters in `useEffect` without proper guards
- Implement functional updates for state that depends on previous state

### Performance Optimization

- Use `useCallback`/`React.memo`/`useMemo` only when performance benefits are measured
- Define default props as constants outside component to prevent re-renders
- Avoid inline object/array literals as default props
- Extract nested components to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Side Effects and Cleanup

- Clean up side effects in `useEffect` (timers, listeners, subscriptions)
- Provide proper dependency arrays for hooks
- Handle component unmounting gracefully
- Use `useCallback` with stable dependencies for event handlers

### Security and Best Practices

- Avoid direct DOM manipulation (`findDOMNode`, direct element access)
- Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
- Use `rel="noreferrer noopener"` with `target="_blank"` links
- Implement proper error boundaries for component trees

### Custom Hooks

- Custom hooks must call at least one React hook
- Follow naming convention with `use` prefix
- Encapsulate related state logic and side effects
- Return consistent interfaces from custom hooks

<example>
  import { useCallback } from "react";

function ProductPage({ productId }) {
const handleSubmit = useCallback(() => {
post("/product/" + productId + "/buy");
}, [productId]);

    return <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;

}
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  // Missing dependencies => new function on every render
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    // ...
  });
</example>
