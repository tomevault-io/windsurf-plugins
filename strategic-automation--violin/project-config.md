# Strategic-Automation/violin — AI Developer Guidance

Workspace developer guidance for AI coding agents (Antigravity, Hermes, Codex, Cursor) developing or maintaining `violin`.

## 1. Stack & Setup
- **Python:** 3.11 (`.python-version`, `pyproject.toml`)
- **Package Manager:** `uv` (`uv sync --dev`)
- **Venv:** `.venv` via `uv`

## 2. Mandatory Verification Commands
Run before declaring completion:
```bash
uv run pytest                                # Full test suite (100% pass)
uv run ruff check .                          # Linter check
uv run ruff format --check .                 # Format check (fix: uv run ruff format .)
uv run python scripts/violin_guard.py check-release # Release gate check
```

## 3. Code Conventions & Architecture
- **Hermes Runtime Contract:** Target-touching commands MUST use the registered `plugins.violin_guard` tools (`violin_exec`, `violin_record_ptt`, `violin_review_batch`, `violin_record_hypothesis`, `violin_target`, `violin_status`). The standalone CLI is for administration and diagnostics, not target execution.
- **Fail-Closed Validation:** State parsers in `plugins/violin_guard/core/` and command gates in `plugins/violin_guard/gates/` validate inputs fail-closed before mutating state.
- **Section Preservation:** Rewriters (`_rewrite_hypotheses`, `update_task`) MUST preserve template sections (`## Observations`, `## Decoy Trail`, `## Research Log`, `## Resolved Theories`, table columns). Never manually overwrite `hypotheses.md` with unstructured narrative text; keep canonical `### H-XXX:` blocks and status fields intact.
- **Evidence Path Isolation:** Save all raw evidence, dumps, tokens, and PoC outputs strictly under `$ENG_DIR/evidence/<phase>/`. Never place evidence files inside `$ENG_DIR/state/` (reserved for runtime state tracking).
- **Typed Schemas:** Use Pydantic v2 `BaseModel` models in `plugins/violin_guard/core/schemas.py`.
- **Encoding:** Explicit `encoding="utf-8"` required for all text file operations.
- **Library-First Development:** Always use libraries—both Python standard library (e.g., `functools.lru_cache`, `dataclasses`, `pathlib`, `contextlib`, `ipaddress`, `argparse`, `datetime.timedelta`, `shutil`, `re`, `shlex`, `hashlib`) and declared external dependencies (`pydantic`, `netaddr`, `yarl`, `filelock`, `pyyaml`, `bashlex`, `psutil`)—instead of rolling custom code or manual parsing algorithms. Always check if existing built-in or project dependencies provide the required functionality before writing custom implementations.
- **Spelling & Naming:** Use American English throughout codebase symbols and exports (`normalize_target`, `serialize`, `initialize`). Avoid single-letter variable names (`a`, `r`) in public/internal handler signatures and function definitions.
- **Timestamp Standardization:** Use ISO-8601 UTC formats (`datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()`) across all state, receipt, and evidence timestamps.
- **Process & Concurrency Safety:** Never mutate global process environment (`os.environ`) in request handlers or adapter logic; pass parameters explicitly. Always acquire advisory locks (`lock_file` / `workflow_lock`) before writing to or appending to any state/feedback files.
- **No Test Artifact Leakage in Production:** Production code must NEVER inspect `sys.modules` for test-specific package names or test-specific shims. Use clean dependency injection, fixtures, or `unittest.mock`.
- **Domain-Driven Test Naming:** Name test files and test functions descriptively after the capability, invariant, or subsystem under test (e.g., `test_batch_integrity.py`), never after transient ticket numbers (`task1`, `a1-a15`) or static version numbers (`roadmap_1_1_1`).

## 4. Git & Branching Strategy
- **Branches:** `codex/<topic>` or `dev`
- **Flow:** `codex/<topic>` ──► `dev` ──► `master`.
- **Feature PRs:** Squash-merge topic branches into `dev`, then delete the topic branch.
- **Release PRs:** Merge `dev` into `master` with **Create a merge commit**. Never squash-merge or rebase-merge a release PR; `dev` must remain an ancestor of `master`.
- **Post-Release Sync:** `.github/workflows/sync-dev-after-release.yml` fast-forwards `dev` to the new `master` commit after every release merge. It must fail instead of force-pushing when the branches have diverged.
- **Recovery:** If post-release sync fails, inspect the graph and merge `master` back into `dev`; never rewrite a shared protected branch to hide divergence.
- **Commit Conventions:** Follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`). Use imperative mood, lowercase types, and no trailing periods. Ensure clean rebasing without duplicate dual-author cherry-picks.

## 5. Issue Creation & Triage

All agent-created or agent-edited issues MUST follow
`.github/ISSUE_STANDARDS.md`.

Before creating an issue:

1. Search open and closed issues for duplicates and overlapping scope.
2. Search open pull requests for work that already implements the change.
3. Keep one independently reviewable concern per issue.
4. Prefer GitHub-native metadata over prose: issue type, project Priority/Status,
   dependencies, sub-issues, milestones, and area labels.
