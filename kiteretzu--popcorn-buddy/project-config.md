# Web Dashboard – Frontend Rules

## Scope

These rules apply when working in `apps/web-dashboard/**` (Next.js App Router, React, Tailwind).

## Routing & Layout

- Follow the existing App Router structure under `src/app`.
- Prefer server components by default; use client components only when needed (state, effects, browser APIs, event handlers).
- Keep layout components (`layout.tsx`, shared `PageLayout` etc.) consistent and reuse them across pages instead of duplicating layout code.

## Components & Hooks

- Prefer reusable components from `src/components` before creating new ones.
- Colocate component-specific logic and styles near the component.
- Extract shared logic into custom hooks under `src/hooks` if it is reused across components.

## Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes instead of ad-hoc inline styles, matching the existing design language.
- Reuse existing design tokens, color choices, and spacing patterns visible in current components.
 - Make sure styling stays consistent with the global theme defined in shared layout/components (colors, typography, spacing, radii).
 - Prefer `components/ui` shadcn UI primitives for buttons, inputs, dialogs, etc. instead of introducing new ad‑hoc primitives.
 - If you notice shadcn components diverging from the global theme, first update the shared shadcn styles/tokens to align with the global theme instead of overriding them locally.

## Forms

- Build forms using the `useZodForm` hook for schema-driven validation and consistent form state handling.
- Prefer reusing existing form field components where possible; keep validation messages and error display consistent with other pages.

## Data Fetching & React Query Hooks

- Use the react-query-based hooks from `src/hooks/react-query-hooks` for all backend interactions.
- For **mutations**, use `useMutationData` (and `useMutationDataState` when you need to update UI state optimistically or avoid flicker while reflecting local changes).
- For **queries**, use `useQueryData` as the default way to fetch and cache backend data.
- Continue to use existing API helper utilities in `src/lib` instead of raw `fetch`, wiring them through these react-query hooks.

## UX & Quality

- Maintain consistent UX patterns with existing pages (loading states, error messages, form handling).
- Favor simple, readable components over overly abstracted patterns.
