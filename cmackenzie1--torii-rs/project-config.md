description: When writing RFC (Request for comments)
---


Every RFC must begin with the following:

1. A number, padded to 3 digits, and a title. 
2. A table immediately after the title of the following structure. The statuses are implemented, draft, and in progress.

| Date       | Author       | Status         |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 2025-02-19 | @cmackenzie1 | ✅ Implemented |

3. A motivation section describing WHY this proposed RFC is needed.
4. An design section detailing what is being added
5. An implementation section going deeper into how it will interact with the existing components (if any). 
6. A section outlining possible issues that could arise from the RFC being accepted or changes to support it.
