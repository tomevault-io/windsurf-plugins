# aislop — agent instructions

[aislop](https://github.com/scanaislop/aislop) is your guardrail for shipping clean, maintainable, production-grade code. It catches the patterns AI coding tools leave behind: dead imports, redundant code, duplicate logic, unsafe any-typed casts, narrative comments, swallowed errors, oversized functions, risky security constructs — and grades the project out of 100 so regressions are visible. Treat its findings as blocking, not advisory: the goal is code a human maintainer would happily inherit.

## On every edit

An `afterFileEdit` hook runs `aislop hook cursor` after file edits. It scans the touched files and returns findings as JSON `additionalContext` shaped like `AislopFeedback` (schema `aislop.hook.v2` — score, baseline, delta, regressed, counts, findings, newSinceBaseline, suggestedActions). Act on them the same turn; the `suggestedActions` field tells you exactly what to run next.

## MCP tools

When you need a full-project or targeted check, call the **aislop** MCP server:

- `aislop_scan` — score + top findings (use before declaring work done)
- `aislop_fix` — apply mechanical fixes first (formatting, unused imports, narrative comments)
- `aislop_why` — explain a specific rule/finding
- `aislop_baseline` — capture or compare against the quality baseline

Prefer `aislop_fix` then `aislop_scan` over hand-fixing mechanical issues.

## Severity ladder

- `error` — MUST fix this turn.
- `warning` + `fixable: true` — MUST fix this turn.
- `warning` + `fixable: false` — fix if trivially mechanical, otherwise surface in your reply.

## Rules

- `.aislop/config.yml` — thresholds and engine toggles. Treat as authoritative; don't edit without user consent.
- `.aislop/rules.yaml` — project-specific architecture rules (may be absent). When a finding cites `architecture/*`, open this file and follow it.
- Custom rules can change between sessions. Trust what the scan returns, not a cached understanding of what the rules are.

## Principles

- Do not disable rules to pass the scan. Fix the underlying issue.
- If a finding is a false positive, leave it and explain in your reply — do not delete the rule config.
- The findings payload includes `nextSteps[]` — treat those as your plan for the turn.
