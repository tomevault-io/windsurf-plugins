description: Write a comprehensive GitHub release changelog for every version tag

# Release Changelogs

Every release needs **two copies of the same changelog**: `CHANGELOG.md` in the repo and GitHub release notes for the tag. Pair with the version bump in `app_meta.py` (see `version-bump.mdc`).

## When

On each release, before merging the version bump to `main`.

## How to build

1. Previous tag: `git tag -l 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | head -1`
2. Review `git log vPREVIOUS..HEAD` and merged PRs.
3. Group by user-visible area (DNS, mail, auth, UI, API, ops).
4. Write for someone upgrading. Plain language; link issues/PRs where helpful.

## CHANGELOG.md format

- Newest version **below** `[Unreleased]`, above older entries.
- Heading: `## [0.18.1] - YYYY-MM-DD`
- Subsections as needed: `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Security`, `### Removed`
- End with `### Upgrade` when deploy steps matter.
- Move `[Unreleased]` bullets into the version section when you ship.

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [0.18.1] - 2026-06-26

Patch release: one-line summary.

### Fixed

- Symptom and what changed.

### Upgrade

\`\`\`bash
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`
```

Commit `CHANGELOG.md` in the **same commit** as the `APP_VERSION` bump.

## GitHub release

Publish the **same content** as the new `CHANGELOG.md` section (not the whole file):

```bash
gh release create v0.18.1 --title "v0.18.1" --notes-file /tmp/release-notes.md
```

Draft `/tmp/release-notes.md` from the version section. No empty release bodies. No raw `git log`. Do not omit breaking or security items.
