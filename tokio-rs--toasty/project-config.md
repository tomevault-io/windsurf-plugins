## Commands

```bash
# Build everything
cargo build

# Run all tests (SQLite only, no external services needed)
cargo test

# Run tests for a specific crate
cargo test -p toasty
cargo test -p toasty-core
cargo test -p toasty-driver-integration-suite

# Run a single test by name
cargo test -p tests <test_name>

# Run tests with specific database drivers (requires running external services)
cargo test -p tests --features mysql
cargo test -p tests --features postgresql

# DynamoDB only (requires local DynamoDB running)
cargo test --features dynamodb --no-default-features -- --test-threads=1

# DynamoDB + SQLite
cargo test --features dynamodb -- --test-threads=1

# Lint
cargo clippy

# Format
cargo fmt
```

## Workflow

Always run `cargo fmt` after finishing work on a change.

## Design Philosophy

Toasty does not hide differences between target databases. A query method that
maps onto a native operator is a pass-through: it keeps that backend's behavior
and is offered only where the operator exists.

- `.like()` → each backend's own `LIKE` (case sensitivity varies; docs state each).
- `.ilike()` → PostgreSQL `ILIKE` only; elsewhere rejected with `unsupported_feature`,
  not emulated. Gated by `Capability::native_ilike` (`engine/verify.rs`; tests use `requires(native_ilike)`).

Implement an operation uniformly across backends only when semantics are
identical everywhere — e.g. `.starts_with()` (case-sensitive prefix match).
`.ilike()` fails that test: backends disagree on case-folding.

## Architecture

Toasty is a Rust ORM supporting SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (DynamoDB) databases. It is a Cargo workspace.

### Crate Overview

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `toasty` | User-facing API: `Db`, query engine, runtime |
| `toasty-core` | Shared types: schema representations, statement AST, driver interface |
| `toasty-macros` | Proc-macro entry points and code generation (`#[derive(Model)]`, `#[derive(Embed)]`) |
| `toasty-sql` | SQL serialization (statement AST → SQL string), used by SQL drivers |
| `toasty-driver-sqlite/postgresql/mysql/dynamodb` | Database driver implementations |
| `toasty-driver-integration-suite` | Shared integration test suite run against all drivers |
| `toasty-driver-integration-suite-macros` | Proc-macros for the test suite (`#[driver_test]`, `generate_driver_tests!`) |
| `tests` | Workspace-level integration tests (invokes the suite per driver) |

### Schema Layers

The schema has two distinct layers bridged by a mapping:

- **App schema** (`toasty-core/src/schema/app/`): Model-level definitions — fields, relations, constraints. What the Rust code sees.
- **DB schema** (`toasty-core/src/schema/db/`): Table/column-level definitions. What the database sees.
- **Mapping** (`toasty-core/src/schema/mapping/`): Connects app fields to db columns, supporting non-1-1 mappings.

### Code Generation (`toasty-macros`)

`#[derive(Model)]` on a user struct triggers:
1. `toasty-macros` calls `generate_model()` internally
2. `macros/src/schema/` parses macro attributes into an internal model representation
3. `macros/src/expand/` generates implementations: `Model` trait, query builders (`find_by_*`, `filter_by_*`), create/update builders, relation methods, field accessors, and the runtime schema registration

### Query Engine (`toasty/src/engine/`)

Queries go through a multi-phase compilation pipeline:

```
Statement AST → [Simplify] → [Lower to HIR] → [Plan to MIR] → [Execution Plan] → [Execute]
```

1. **Simplify** (`simplify.rs`): Normalizes the AST — rewrites relationship navigation into explicit subqueries, flattens expressions
2. **Lower** (`lower.rs`): Converts model-level statements to HIR (High-level IR); resolves model fields to table columns; expands `INCLUDE` associations into subqueries; tracks dependency graph between statements
3. **Plan** (`plan.rs`): Converts HIR dependency graph (which may have cycles) into a MIR DAG of operations. Breaks cycles by introducing `NestedMerge` operations
4. **Exec** (`exec.rs`): Interpreter that runs the compiled action sequence; assigns variable slots for intermediate results; the only phase that calls the database driver

The final compiled form is a mini-program: a sequence of actions operating on numbered variable slots (e.g., `$0 = ExecSQL(...)`, `$1 = NestedMerge($0, ...)`).

### Driver Interface

Drivers implement `Driver` + `Connection` traits from `toasty-core/src/driver.rs`. The single `Connection::exec()` method receives an `Operation` enum covering both SQL operations (`QuerySql`, `Insert`) and key-value operations (`GetByKey`, `QueryPk`, etc.). The planner uses `driver.capability()` to decide which operation types to generate.

### Integration Test Suite

Tests live in `crates/toasty-driver-integration-suite/src/tests/`. Each test function is annotated with `#[driver_test(id(ID))]` where `ID` is the key type (e.g., `uuid::Uuid`, `i64`). The `generate_driver_tests!` macro in `tests/tests/<driver>.rs` instantiates all suite tests for that driver's `Setup` implementation.

To add a new integration test, add a file to `crates/toasty-driver-integration-suite/src/tests/` — it is automatically discovered via the `generate_test_registry!` proc-macro at compile time.
