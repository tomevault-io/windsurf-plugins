# Working in this repo (Claude Code context)

Read this file before making changes.  See README.md for what the
project is and how a user runs it.

For deployment (host or Docker), follow `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Where things live

Business logic lives in `src/claudeteam/` only.  There is **no** parallel
`scripts/` shim layer.  Every command is a Python module under
`src/claudeteam/commands/` registered in `src/claudeteam/cli.py`.

```
src/claudeteam/cli.py           ← top-level dispatch + COMMANDS registry
src/claudeteam/commands/X.py    ← one module per subcommand, ~30 LOC each
src/claudeteam/store/           ← file-backed local state (no DB)
src/claudeteam/runtime/         ← config / paths / tmux / watchdog
src/claudeteam/feishu/          ← lark-cli wrapper + router pipeline
src/claudeteam/agents/          ← CliAdapter base + per-CLI adapters
```

Tests are in `tests/unit/test_*.py` (per-module),
`tests/integration/test_*.py` (end-to-end in-process; auto gate),
and `tests/scenarios/*.md` (operator-run regression playbooks).

## Building rules (READ BEFORE WRITING CODE)

1. **Every new module ships its own unit test in the same commit.**
   Touching `commands/X.py`?  Write `tests/unit/test_commands_X.py`.

2. **Every new public command ships an operator playbook (markdown) in
   `tests/scenarios/` in the same commit.**  Given/When/Then template,
   for human regression checks against a real deployment.

3. **Keep it small.**  Prefer the smallest thing that works — avoid
   speculative `CliCapabilities`-style dataclasses or deeply decomposed
   multi-file trees.  If a function looks too short to need its own
   file, it probably is.

4. **No compatibility wrappers.**  Don't keep a shim around just because
   an old call site might break — update the call site instead.

5. **Test fixtures live in `tests/helpers.py`.**  Use `isolated_env()`
   and `run_cli()`.  Don't copy-paste a new `_isolated_state()` per
   test file.

## Simplicity gate (read before opening a PR)

Inspired by `forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills` CLAUDE.md.  Before
merging a refactor or new module, walk this checklist:

- **Two-use rule.**  Helpers, dataclasses, and base classes only earn
  their own existence at the *third* call site.  Two similar blocks
  inline beats one premature abstraction.
- **Dead code = delete.**  An unused private function isn't
  "documentation" — it's noise that drifts.  If `grep -rn '\b_fn\b'`
  shows only the definition, remove it.
- **Match the canonical command.**  `commands/health.py` is the
  reference shape: `_check_*` helpers + `HealthReport` accumulator +
  `_emit_text` / `_emit_json` + `main(argv)`.  New commands that look
  drastically different need a one-line "why" in their docstring.
- **No compatibility shims for unreleased work.**  If you renamed a
  function nobody outside the repo calls, just rename it everywhere;
  don't leave a wrapper.

## Test gate (must stay green)

```bash
python3 tests/run.py        # needs Python 3.10+
```

Stdlib-only runner (no pytest required).  Should report
`tests: N passed, 0 failed`.  Failing tests block commits.  If the
`python3` on your machine is older than 3.10, invoke an explicit
interpreter, e.g. `python3.12 tests/run.py`.

That gate (unit + in-process end-to-end) verifies a *code change* — no deploy
needed; it's what an agent runs to check its own work.  To verify the
*deployed product* end-to-end like a real user (send Feishu messages → watch
agents respond), drive `tests/scenarios/host_smoke.md`: an agent runs the
`lark-cli --as user` sends + verifies responses itself; only three one-time
steps (Feishu app, user OAuth, CLI login) need a human.  Install first via
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.  The other `tests/scenarios/*.md` are the same shape.

## How modules cooperate (the message flow)

```
Feishu chat               feishu/subscribe.py    ←─── node scripts/feishu_channel/sidecar.js run (Popen)
   │                              │
   │ user types in group          │ NDJSON line
   ▼                              ▼
       ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ feishu/router.py                            │  pure decision:
       │   classify_event(event, agents, …)          │  DROP / ROUTE
       └─────────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                             │ Decision
                             ▼
       ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ feishu/deliver.py                           │  side-effects:
       │   apply(decision, …) → DeliveryReport       │  inbox + tmux inject
       └────────┬───────────────────────────┬────────┘
                │                           │
                ▼                           ▼
   store/local_facts                 runtime/tmux + agents/
       inbox.json                    inject text into pane
       status.json                   using each adapter's submit_keys
       logs.jsonl
```

`commands/router.py` is the daemon entry that wraps `subscribe.process_lines`
around `node scripts/feishu_channel/sidecar.js run` stdout (official
`@larksuite/channel` WebSocket → NDJSON; lark-cli is now egress-only).
Tests use a list-of-lines fixture instead of a real subprocess.
