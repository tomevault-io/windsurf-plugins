# AOSC Agent Guide

This guide is for AI agents and automation working in the public AOSC
repository. For project architecture, build commands, and contribution flow,
read `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` first.

## Attribution

Do not add AI/assistant attribution or fingerprints anywhere — no "Generated with
Claude Code", no `Co-Authored-By` an AI, no "written by an AI" notes — in commit
messages, pull request titles/bodies, code comments, or docs. Author contributions
as ordinary work under the human contributor's identity.

## OpenSearch API Compatibility

AOSC `develop` builds BOTH OpenSearch lines from a single unified module
`aosc-plugin` with version-specific source directories. Shared code lives in
`src/*/java/`; files that differ between OpenSearch 2.x and 3.x live in
`src/*/java-2x/` and `src/*/java-3x/`. Gradle selects the matching compat
directory based on `-PopensearchVersion`.

3.x packages: `org.opensearch.transport.client.*`,
`action.support.clustermanager.*`, Java 21. 2.x packages:
`org.opensearch.client.*`, `action.support.master.*`, Java 11. Supported versions
per line live in `release/os2.properties` / `release/os3.properties`.

Changes to shared files (`src/*/java/`) apply to both lines automatically.
Changes to version-specific files (`src/*/java-2x/` or `java-3x/`) must be
mirrored in the other compat directory to keep behavior consistent. CI runs
`scripts/check-compat-drift.sh` to enforce that non-excepted compat file
pairs differ only in import/package lines.

Compat utilities that abstract version differences (use these instead of
putting version-specific code in shared files):

- `AsyncClientHelper` — wraps `Client`; shared code receives this, never raw `Client`
- `OsCompat` — `TotalHits` field vs method, `storedFields()` accessor
- `OsTestCompat` — `ShardStats` constructor difference
- `MockClientFactory` — mock `Client`/`AdminClient` creation for tests
- `HttpCompat` — Apache HttpClient 4 vs 5 in smoke/benchmark tests

Common 3.x imports:

```java
import org.opensearch.transport.client.Client;
import org.opensearch.core.action.ActionListener;
import org.opensearch.action.ActionType;
import org.opensearch.action.support.ActionFilters;
import org.opensearch.action.support.HandledTransportAction;
```

The AOSC OpenSearch 3.x plugin currently uses the positional `createComponents`
signature exposed by the target OpenSearch versions:

```java
@Override
public Collection<Object> createComponents(
    Client client,
    ClusterService clusterService,
    ThreadPool threadPool,
    ResourceWatcherService resourceWatcherService,
    ScriptService scriptService,
    NamedXContentRegistry xContentRegistry,
    Environment environment,
    NodeEnvironment nodeEnvironment,
    NamedWriteableRegistry namedWriteableRegistry,
    IndexNameExpressionResolver indexNameExpressionResolver,
    Supplier<RepositoriesService> repositoriesServiceSupplier
) {
    ...
}
```

Use `org.apache.lucene.tests.util.LuceneTestCase.AwaitsFix` for ignored/flaky
test annotations. Do not import `com.carrotsearch.randomizedtesting.annotations.AwaitsFix`.

## Structured Logging

AOSC uses `AoscLogger` for structured context. When a constructor receives an
`AoscLogger`, bind it to the concrete class:

```java
this.logger = Objects.requireNonNull(logger, "logger").forClass(MyClass.class);
```

Use `LC` constants for structured field keys. Keep log messages static and put
values in `kv()` fields:

```java
import static com.atlassian.opensearch.aosc.utils.AoscLogger.kv;

logger.info("Gradient decrease", kv(LC.EVENT, "gradient_decrease"), kv(LC.GRADIENT, gradient));
```

Do not introduce direct `LogManager.getLogger()` or `Loggers.getLogger()` calls
in AOSC components.

## Async Patterns

OpenSearch transport actions use `ActionListener<T>` callbacks. Propagate
failures with `ActionListener.onFailure()` and do not hold locks while invoking
callbacks.

Prefer explicit OpenSearch thread-pool scheduling over Java common-pool helpers
in test-sensitive code. In particular, avoid `CompletableFuture.delayedExecutor`
inside OpenSearch tests; the common pool is blocked by the test security manager.
Use project utilities that schedule through the OpenSearch `ThreadPool`.

## Core Safety Invariants

- Translog snapshots must be closed in a `finally` block or equivalent cleanup path.
- Bulk writes use idempotent index operations, not create-only writes.
- Source write blocking must use the OpenSearch add-block API so in-flight writes drain before cutover.
- Retention leases must not be released while a migration still needs source operation history.
- Background async failures must be surfaced to the migration state machine or caller; do not swallow them in logs only.

## Tests

Use targeted validation while developing:

```bash
# The -P version selects the OpenSearch line, so no project prefix is needed (set the version
# per invocation or once in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties).
./gradlew fastCheck -PopensearchVersion=3.6.0
./gradlew yamlRestTest -PopensearchVersion=3.6.0
./gradlew itTest -PopensearchVersion=3.6.0
# The 2.x line builds the same way — just change the version:
./gradlew fastCheck -PopensearchVersion=2.19.0
npm run docs:build
```
