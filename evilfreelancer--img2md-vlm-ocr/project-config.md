# Coding rules

- If there is an explicit user instruction, execute it without clarifications.
- If something needs to be created for user convenience (e.g., .env, documentation, auto-start), do it without extra questions.
- All code comments must be in English.
- The last line in new files must be empty.

# Project Coding Rules

## File Endings

- Every new file **must** have a single empty line at the end (POSIX compatibility).

## Comments

- All comments in code **must** be in English, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.

## Project Structure

- Follow this structure:
    - app/
        - controllers/ # Controllers: business logic, request handling
        - services/ # Services: external API/model logic
        - schemas/ # Pydantic schemas for request/response
        - utils/ # Utility functions (e.g., image processing, padding, etc.)
