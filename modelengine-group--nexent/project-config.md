description: Pytest Unit Test Rules for this repository
---


## Pytest Unit Test Rules (Concise)

### Framework
- Use pytest exclusively; prefer fixtures; use pytest `assert` statements.

### Naming
- Files `test_*`; classes `Test*`; functions `test_*`.

### Imports
- Order: standard library, third‑party, project.
- Import only the unit under test; mock collaborators using `pytest-mock`.

### Import and Mock Rules
- Do not directly import external interfaces/clients/services into tests to exercise collaborators.
- Patch where the dependency is imported (lookup site) using a fully‑qualified path.
- Use `side_effect` to cover error paths when appropriate.

```python
from pytest_mock import MockFixture
from backend.apps.some_app import create_resource

def test_create_resource_success(mocker: MockFixture):
    mocker.patch(
        "backend.services.model_provider_service.ModelProviderService.create",
        return_value={"id": "res-1"},
    )
    assert create_resource({...})["id"] == "res-1"
```

### Structure and Size
- Keep files under 500 lines or split by feature; include `__init__.py` in split directories; use `test_<module>_<feature>.py` names.

### Coverage and Async
- Cover success/error flows and boundaries; use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for variants.
- Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests.

### Isolation
- Use `autouse=True` fixtures to reset state; fully mock external I/O and APIs.

### Checklist
- [ ] pytest only (no unittest)
- [ ] naming conventions followed
- [ ] collaborators mocked with pytest-mock
- [ ] import/mocking rules followed
- [ ] async tests decorated when needed
- [ ] clear, specific assertions
- [ ] adequate coverage (normal and exception paths)
