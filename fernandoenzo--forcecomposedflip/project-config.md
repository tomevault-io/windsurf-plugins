## Project Overview

**ForceComposedFlip** is a lightweight Windows utility that forces the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) to use Composed Flip instead of Independent Flip. This makes DLSS Frame Generation interpolated frames visible to screen capture APIs (DXGI Desktop Duplication and Windows.Graphics.Capture), solving a streaming problem with Sunshine/Moonlight where interpolated frames are invisible to the stream.

## How It Works

Two mechanisms work together:

1. **Invisible overlay window** — A 1x1 pixel, near-invisible (opacity 1/255), click-through, topmost window that forces DWM to composite every frame.
2. **MPO toggle** — A registry key (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Dwm\OverlayTestMode=5`) that disables Multiplane Overlay, preventing DWM from bypassing composition via hardware overlay planes.

## File Structure

```
ForceComposedFlip.c       # Native Win32 C implementation (single-file)
ForceComposedFlip.rc      # Windows resource script (embeds icon and manifest)
ForceComposedFlip.manifest # DPI awareness manifest (PerMonitorV2)
ForceComposedFlip.ico     # Application icon (gamepad icon from LibreICONS)
ForceComposedFlip.svg     # SVG version of icon for README header
Makefile                  # Cross-compilation with MinGW-w64 from Linux
README.md                 # Full documentation
LICENSE                   # GPLv3
AGENTS.md                 # AI agent coding guidelines
.gitignore                # Ignores build artifacts (*.exe, *.o, *.res)
```

## Building

Requires `mingw-w64` for cross-compilation from Linux:

```bash
# Install (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install mingw-w64

# Build
make

# Clean
make clean
```

This produces `ForceComposedFlip.exe`, a standalone Windows executable with the icon embedded as a resource.

The version string is derived from `git describe --tags --dirty` in the Makefile and passed to the compiler as `-DVERSION_STRING=L\"$(VERSION)\"`. Builds are reproducible via `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` (set from the git commit timestamp).

## Key Win32 APIs Used

- `CreateWindowExW` with `WS_EX_TOPMOST | WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW | WS_EX_TRANSPARENT | WS_EX_LAYERED` — overlay window
- `SetLayeredWindowAttributes` — sets opacity to 1/255
- `SetWindowPos` with `HWND_TOPMOST` — re-asserts z-order every 500ms
- `GetForegroundWindow` — polls foreground window every 2000ms
- `Shell_NotifyIconW` — system tray icon, tooltip, and balloon notifications
- `ShellExecuteExW` with `"runas"` verb — UAC elevation for registry changes
- `WaitForSingleObject` / `CloseHandle` — waits for elevated processes
- `CreateMutexW` — enforces single instance
- `RegOpenKeyExW` / `RegQueryValueExW` — reads MPO and auto-start registry state
- `RegSetValueExW` / `RegDeleteValueW` — writes auto-start registry value (`HKCU\...\Run`)
- WinINet (`InternetOpenW`, `InternetConnectW`, `HttpOpenRequestW`, `InternetQueryOptionW`) — background update checker via HTTPS HEAD to GitHub releases

## Conventions

- All code comments and documentation must be written in **English**.
- The C code uses the Win32 Unicode API exclusively (all `W`-suffixed functions, `wchar_t` strings with `L"..."` prefix). The `-municode` compiler flag handles the `UNICODE` / `_UNICODE` defines.
- The project is intentionally single-file (one `.c` file). Do not split it into multiple source files.
- Comments use `/* C-style */` only (no `//`).
- Comments should explain **why**, not just **what**. Every function has a block comment describing its purpose and any non-obvious behavior.
- Section headers use Unicode box-drawing characters: `/* ─── Section Name ──── */`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` via `#define`, grouped by category with prefixes (`TIMER_`, `IDM_`).
- Globals: `static g_camelCase`, all initialized to `NULL`/`0`/`FALSE`.
- Functions: `static PascalCase(void)`, all internal linkage.
- Local variables: `camelCase`.
- K&R brace style, 4-space indentation.
- No heap allocation — all stack locals and static globals.
- All git commits must be **signed** (`git commit -S`).
- Git tags must be **lightweight** (`git tag 1.2`), not annotated or signed.
- When elaborating plans with the user, ALWAYS save them to a temporary text file (e.g., `.opencode/plans/plan.md`) to ensure they survive conversation compressions. Iterate on this file throughout the conversation as the plan evolves. The AI agent has full permission to create, modify, and delete this file even in plan-only mode — this is the only exception to the read-only constraint. This file should never be tracked in the repository. After executing the plan, ALWAYS ask the user for permission to delete the file.

## Execution Protocol

**NEVER execute changes without explicit double confirmation:**

1. Always plan first, present to user, wait for approval
2. Ask if the user wants to execute the plan
3. If user confirms, ask once more for final confirmation before proceeding
4. **This applies even in Build Mode** — no exceptions
