# Design MD Generator

You have access to a design system extraction tool. When the user asks you to match a website's visual style, build UI that looks like a specific site, or create a DESIGN.md:

**Run the full pipeline without stopping.** Do not ask "should I proceed?" between steps.

## Full Pipeline (one command flow)

```bash
# 1. Extract design tokens
cd /path/to/dmdg && npx ts-node scripts/extract.ts <URL>

# 2. [YOU] Read tokens.json + screenshots, write DESIGN.md following SKILL.md spec
#    Write all 9 sections without pausing. Self-audit. Fix issues.

# 3. Validate
cd /path/to/dmdg && npx ts-node scripts/validate.ts output/<domain>/DESIGN.md output/<domain>/tokens.json

# 4. Generate report + proof
cd /path/to/dmdg && npx ts-node scripts/preview-gen.ts output/<domain>/tokens.json output/<domain>/
cd /path/to/dmdg && npx ts-node scripts/proof.ts <URL> output/<domain>/tokens.json output/<domain>/
cd /path/to/dmdg && npx ts-node scripts/report-gen.ts output/<domain>/tokens.json output/<domain>/ output/<domain>/DESIGN.md

# 5. Open report for user
open output/<domain>/report.html
```

## Using an Existing DESIGN.md

If a DESIGN.md already exists in the project:

1. Read it completely before writing any UI code
2. Use ONLY the colors, fonts, sizes, and shadows specified in it
3. Do NOT invent values not present in the document
4. Follow Section 9 (Agent Prompt Guide) for quick reference

## Critical Rules

- ALL numerical values MUST come from tokens.json — never hallucinate
- 6-digit lowercase hex (#ffffff, not #FFF)
- Numeric font weights (400, 700) not words (bold)
- Do not stop between steps to ask for confirmation
- Present only the final result

## Full Specification

See SKILL.md for the complete 21-step workflow, format spec, writing style guide, and quality checklist.
