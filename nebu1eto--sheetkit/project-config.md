# SheetKit Development Guide

## Project Overview

SheetKit is a Rust library for reading and writing Excel (.xlsx) files, with Node.js bindings via napi-rs.

### Crate Structure

- **sheetkit-xml** (`crates/sheetkit-xml`): Serde-based XML schema types for OOXML. Low-level XML data structures.
- **sheetkit-core** (`crates/sheetkit-core`): Business logic -- workbook operations, cell manipulation, styles, formulas, charts, images, streaming, encryption, and more. Modules: cell, chart, col, comment, crypt (feature-gated), doc_props, error, formula, image, protection, row, sheet, sst, stream, style, table, utils, validation, workbook.
- **sheetkit** (`crates/sheetkit`): Public facade crate that re-exports types from sheetkit-core for end users.
- **sheetkit-node** (`packages/sheetkit`): Node.js bindings via napi-rs. The Rust crate produces a cdylib (`binding.js`/`binding.d.ts`). TypeScript source files (`index.ts`, `buffer-codec.ts`, `sheet-data.ts`) provide the public API wrapper. tsdown handles transpilation and `.d.ts` generation.

### Tech Stack

- **quick-xml** (with `serialize` and `overlapped-lists` features): XML parsing and serialization
- **serde**: Derive-based (de)serialization for XML types
- **zip** (with `deflate` feature): ZIP archive handling for .xlsx files
- **thiserror**: Error type definitions
- **nom**: Formula parsing
- **napi / napi-derive**: Node.js native addon bindings
- **chrono**: Date/time handling
- **tempfile**: Temporary file handling for StreamWriter (runtime dependency in sheetkit-core)
- **pretty_assertions**: Testing utility
- **aes**, **cbc**, **ecb**, **sha1**, **sha2**, **hmac**, **rand**, **cfb**, **base64** (optional, behind `encryption` feature): File-level encryption/decryption

## Development Workflow

Follow a TDD approach: write tests FIRST, then implement. Tests should verify essential behaviors, not trivial things.

### Build Commands

```bash
# Rust workspace
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace
cargo fmt --check

# Node.js bindings
cd packages/sheetkit && pnpm build
cd packages/sheetkit && pnpm test
```

Always verify builds, lints, and formatting pass before declaring work complete.

### Workspace Layout

- Cargo workspace: `crates/sheetkit-xml`, `crates/sheetkit-core`, `crates/sheetkit`, `packages/sheetkit`, `examples/rust`
- pnpm workspace: `packages/*`, `examples/*`

## Code Style

### Comments

- Doc comments (`///` for Rust, `/** */` for TypeScript): Describe inputs, behavior, and outputs concisely.
- Inline comments: Only for complex logic that is not self-evident from the code.
- No section markers, decorative comments, or emoji in code or output.
- Keep all comments concise.

### Language

- All code must be written in English. This includes variable names, string literals, comments, and example data values.
- Even in example or demo code, use English for all content (e.g., "Name", "Sales", "Employee List" instead of localized text).
- Documentation prose may be in other languages (e.g., Korean guide). Code blocks in Korean documentation (`docs/ko/`) may use Korean comments to aid reader comprehension, while variable names, string literals, and example data values must remain in English.
- Korean documentation (`docs/ko/`, `README.ko.md`) must use concise polite speech consistently: all sentences end with "~합니다/~됩니다/~입니다/~세요" forms. Never use plain/해체 endings like "~이다", "~한다", "~된다" in prose. Commonly used technical terms (serialize, buffer, FFI, SST, AST, enum, trait, crate, facade, napi, callback, offset, payload) should be kept as-is without forced translation.

### General

- No emoji in any code or output.
- Rust: Follow standard Rust conventions. Use `cargo fmt` for formatting.
- TypeScript: Use Biome for formatting and linting. All code must pass `pnpm check` (Biome) with zero errors before committing.
- Never use TypeScript non-null assertion operator (`!`). Instead, use `assert(value != null)` from `node:assert` (or an equivalent runtime check) to verify the value is not null/undefined before use. This applies to all TypeScript code including tests.
- ESM only for all JavaScript/TypeScript. napi v3 with `--esm` produces ESM output directly.
- No hand-written JavaScript (`.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`) files. All JS-side code must be TypeScript. Library code is transpiled by tsdown; scripts are executed via `tsx`.

## Architecture

### XML Layer (sheetkit-xml)

Serde-based XML schema types mapping to OOXML structures. Used by sheetkit-core for reading and writing .xlsx internals.

### Core Layer (sheetkit-core)

All business logic lives here: workbook open/save, cell get/set, SST (shared strings table) management, sheet operations, row/column manipulation, style system, formula parsing, chart/image/drawing support, data validation, comments, streaming writer, document properties, workbook protection, and file-level encryption (`crypt` module, behind `encryption` feature flag).

### Facade Layer (sheetkit)

Thin re-export crate. Provides the public API surface (`Workbook`, `CellValue`, `Style`, `ChartConfig`, etc.) by re-exporting from sheetkit-core.

### Node.js Layer (packages/sheetkit)
