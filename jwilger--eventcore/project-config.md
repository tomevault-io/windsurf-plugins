# EventCore

`eventcore` is a type-safe event sourcing library for Rust implementing multi-stream atomic event sourcing with dynamic consistency boundaries. It is a Rust Cargo workspace with 8 crates providing the core library, derive macros, multiple backend implementations, and a testing toolkit.

## Workspace Structure

- `eventcore` — Main library: `execute()`, `run_projection()`, public re-exports
- `eventcore-types` — Shared vocabulary: traits (`EventStore`, `CommandLogic`) and types
- `eventcore-macros` — `#[derive(Command)]`, `require!`, `emit!` macro implementations
- `eventcore-postgres` — PostgreSQL backend with ACID transactions and advisory locks
- `eventcore-sqlite` — SQLite backend with optional SQLCipher encryption
- `eventcore-memory` — Zero-dependency in-memory store for tests and development
- `eventcore-testing` — Contract tests, chaos harness, `EventCollector` for testing
- `eventcore-examples` — Integration tests demonstrating EventCore patterns

## Development Commands

- `cargo build --workspace` — Build all crates
- `cargo nextest run --workspace` — Run all tests (fallback: `cargo test --workspace`)
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` — Lint
- `cargo fmt --all` — Format
- `cargo mutants` — Mutation testing (zero surviving mutants required)

## Environment

- Enter `nix develop` for pinned toolchains
- Start Postgres via `docker-compose up -d` only when running postgres backend tests

## Documentation

- Architecture docs: `docs/manual/01-introduction/04-architecture.md`
- Decision history: `docs/adr/`
- System blueprints: `blueprints/` (when they exist)

## Required Development Workflow

**CRITICAL: This workflow is enforced, not advisory.**

Every new feature, behavior change, or significant bug fix MUST follow these phases in order. Skipping a phase requires EXPLICIT user confirmation — never infer intent to skip.

### Phase 1: Product Discovery

Use `the-visionary` agent or `bdd:bdd-collaboration` skill. Turn vague requirements into concrete, measurable product requirements. Output: clear user stories with acceptance criteria.

If the user's request is already a clear, specific requirement with acceptance criteria, confirm that Phase 1 can be skipped.

### Phase 2: Domain Discovery

Use BDD skills (`bdd:bdd-scenarios`, `bdd:bdd-principles`). Model the feature: identify the public API surface, command/event design, trait boundaries, and write integration test scenarios. Output: updated or new blueprint in `blueprints/`.

If the feature maps cleanly to an existing modeled API with existing test scenarios, confirm that Phase 2 can be skipped.

### Phase 3: Technical Planning

Use `technical-coordinator` agent. Break requirements into implementation tasks with dependencies and sequencing. For architectural decisions, use `system-architect` or `solution-architect` agents and record decisions as ADRs in `docs/adr/`.

If the implementation is straightforward and fits existing patterns, confirm that Phase 3 can be skipped.

### Phase 4: Implementation

Use `/core:develop` skill. Follow outside-in TDD:

1. Write a failing integration test that exercises the public API
2. Drill down via TDD (red → green → refactor) until the test passes
3. Every domain concept gets a semantic named type
4. **Self-review before commit**: Before committing, review your changes against REVIEW.md's "What to Block" list and all `.claude/rules/` files. Fix violations before committing.
5. Use `/core:review` for multi-agent code review before merging

### Phase Skipping Rules

- **Default: follow all phases in order**
- **To skip a phase:** Claude must explicitly state which phase would be skipped and why, then ask for confirmation
- **Never skip based on implied intent** — even if the user says "just implement X," Claude must note which phases are being skipped and get a "yes, skip" confirmation
- **Phase 4 (Implementation) can never be skipped**
- **Log the decision:** when a phase is skipped with confirmation, note it in the commit or PR description

## Git Commit Rules

- **Never** add `Co-Authored-By` trailers to commit messages
- Use the `git-storytelling:git-commit-messages` skill when crafting commit messages
- Use Conventional Commits for all messages and PR titles

## Key Architectural Rules

- Commands implement `CommandLogic` with pure `apply` and `handle` methods
- `execute()` is the canonical entry point — no manual fold/append
- Read models (projections) and write models (command state) are separate code paths
- Domain types validated at boundaries, never re-validated (parse-don't-validate)
- Tests describe behavior, not implementation
- Drill-down to unit tests is proof-based, not diagnostic
- No panics in production code — use `Result` propagation

## Work Tracking Across Sessions

### GitHub Issues

All work items, feature requests, and bug reports are tracked as GitHub Issues. At the start of each development session, check open issues to understand current priorities.
