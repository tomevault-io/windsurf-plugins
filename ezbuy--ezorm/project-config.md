# Ezorm Skills Index

## Choose a Skill

- Write YAML schema (mongo): `ezorm-write-yaml-mongo`
- Write YAML schema (mysql/mysqlr): `ezorm-write-yaml-mysql` (prefer mysqlr unless explicitly asked for mysql)
- Generate Go from YAML (mongo): `ezorm-gen-yaml-mongo`
- Generate Go from YAML (mysql/mysqlr): `ezorm-gen-yaml-mysql` (prefer mysqlr unless explicitly asked for mysql)

## Notes

- YAML is the source of truth. Generate code with `ezorm gen` using the gen-yaml skills.
- Use db-specific docs and examples referenced inside each skill folder.
