# Development Workflow

## Prerequisites

- Bun 1.0+ (required)

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Development (runs from source with Bun)
bun run dev

# Build (compile TypeScript to dist/)
bun run build

# Type checking (no emit)
bun run typecheck

# Linting
bun run lint

# Format (check / write)
bun run format
bun run format:fix

# Run the built CLI
bun run start
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `BTCH_API_KEY` | Yes | API key for the OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `BTCH_BASE_URL` | No | Custom API endpoint (default: `https://ai.tioo.eu.org/v1`) |
| `BTCH_MODEL` | No | Model override (defaults to the first model fetched from the endpoint) |
| `BTCH_MAX_TOKENS` | No | Max tokens per response (default: 16384) |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values.

## Git hooks

After `bun install`, **Husky** installs a **pre-commit** hook that runs **`lint-staged`**: Biome **format + lint** (`check --write`) on staged `*.{ts,tsx,js,mjs,cjs,json}` files. Fixes are written to disk and re-staged automatically when possible.

## Before Submitting Changes

1. Run `bun run typecheck` — CI enforces this on every PR.
2. Run `bun run lint` — fix any Biome issues (or let pre-commit apply safe fixes).
3. Ensure no secrets or `.env` files are committed.
4. Follow the PR template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

## Project Structure Conventions

- Source code lives in `src/`, compiled output in `dist/` (gitignored).
- The CLI entry point is `src/index.ts` which uses Commander.js for argument parsing.
- UI is built with OpenTUI React (`@opentui/react`).
- Only tool is bash — all file operations happen through shell commands.
