# Plan AI — Monorepo Agent Rules

This repository is a monorepo consisting of three core frontend applications that all connect to a single backend API. All AI agents working on this project MUST strictly adhere to the following rules.

## 1. Golden Rules
- **NEVER AUTO COMMIT**: Do not automatically commit code changes. Implement the changes, verify they compile/work, and then ask the user if they would like to commit.
- **GitNexus First**: This monorepo utilizes `gitnexus` for semantic code intelligence. Always use `gitnexus_impact` before modifying shared functions, and `gitnexus_query` to understand execution flows.
- **BYOK Architecture**: All AI processing (OpenRouter, Deepgram, etc.) relies on a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) architecture. API Keys are stored per `Workspace`, not globally. Always verify that the `activeWorkspace` has valid keys configured before executing AI logic.

## 2. Project Structure & Tech Stack
The monorepo contains the following distinct applications:

### A. Core Web Application (`plan-ai`)
- **Location:** `/plan-ai` (Contains `/frontend` and `/backend`)
- **Stack:** Node.js/Express Backend (Port 8080), React Frontend (Port 3000).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM) + Qdrant (Vector DB).
- **Message Queue:** BullMQ + Redis for asynchronous processing (transcriptions, AI task extraction).
- **Run Command:** `yarn dev` (from the repository root).

### B. Mobile Companion App (`plan-ai-mobile`)
- **Location:** `/plan-ai-mobile`
- **Stack:** React Native (Expo) + Expo Router.
- **Purpose:** Mobile app tailored for recording live, in-person meetings on the go.
- **Run Command:** `yarn dev:mobile` (from the repository root).

### C. Desktop Recorder (`plan-ai-recorder`)
- **Location:** `/plan-ai-recorder`
- **Stack:** Electron + React (Vite).
- **Purpose:** Native desktop app for capturing system audio and microphone streams during virtual meetings (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams).
- **Run Command:** `yarn dev:recorder` (from the repository root).

## 3. Development Workflow & Commands
- **Dependency Management:** Always use `yarn install:all` at the root level to install dependencies across all sub-projects. Avoid running `npm install` inside individual subdirectories to prevent lockfile desynchronization.
- **Environment Variables:** All applications require a `.env` file to run. If an app crashes on startup because it cannot find one, silently copy the `.env.template` file to `.env` in the respective directory.
- **Port Conflicts:** If ports `3000` or `8080` are occupied and preventing startup, run the `yarn kill-ports` script from the root.
- **Database / API Schema Changes:** If you modify `schema.prisma` in `plan-ai/backend`, you MUST run `yarn update` from the root directory. This script will migrate the database, regenerate TSOA swagger routes, and automatically sync the frontend TypeScript types.
