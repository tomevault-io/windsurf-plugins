# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

A Gradle plugin (published to the Gradle Plugin Portal as `io.github.duckasteroid.github-packages` and `io.github.duckasteroid.github-packages-settings`) that configures GitHub Packages as an authenticated Maven repository, in both build scripts and `settings.gradle`. Java 17, built with Gradle itself (`java-gradle-plugin`).

## Common commands

```bash
./gradlew clean check          # full build: unit tests + functional tests
./gradlew test                 # unit tests only (src/test)
./gradlew functionalTest       # functional tests only (src/functionalTest, uses Gradle TestKit)
./gradlew test --tests "GithubPackagesPluginTest.pluginRegistersExtension"
./gradlew functionalTest --tests "GithubPackagesPluginFunctionalTest.pluginAppliesAndAddsRepository"
```

There is no separate lint/format task configured. `check` depends on `functionalTest` (wired in `build.gradle`), so a single `./gradlew check` covers both suites — this is what CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) runs.

Prefer the `gradle-mcp` MCP tool over invoking `./gradlew` through a raw shell command when it's available — it gives structured pass/fail output instead of raw logs to grep through.

Versioning is derived from git tags via `duckasteroid-java` (from [duckAsteroid/gradle-convention-plugin](https://github.com/duckAsteroid/gradle-convention-plugin), applied in `build.gradle`) — there is no hardcoded version to bump. Between releases, the dev-build version is computed from Conventional Commits since the last tag (`feat:`→minor, `fix:`/`perf:`→patch, `!`/`BREAKING CHANGE:`→major); an explicit `-Prelease.version=X.Y.Z` (below) always overrides that. Publishing (`publish`, `publishPlugins`) only happens in CI on `v*` tags pushed to `main` (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`); don't run publish tasks locally.

Plugin resolution for `duckasteroid-java` itself is bootstrapped in `settings.gradle` via `io.github.duckasteroid.github-packages-settings` (this project's own settings plugin, pinned to a previously published Plugin Portal version) pointed at `owner=duckAsteroid, repository=gradle-convention-plugin` — `duckasteroid-java` is published only to GitHub Packages, never the Plugin Portal, so it can't be resolved without that bootstrap. The Java toolchain default from `duckasteroid-java` is Java 25; this project pins back to 17 via `duckasteroid.java.version=17` in `gradle.properties` to match the existing target. `duckasteroid-java` configures no publish repository itself (not even GitHub Packages) — this project's actual publish targets (Gradle Plugin Portal via `com.gradle.plugin-publish`, plus `maven-publish`) are untouched and independent of it.

### Releasing

Cutting a release means creating and pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag on `main`, which triggers `publish.yml` (build, test, `publish`, `publishPlugins` to the Gradle Plugin Portal). Do this with axion-release's own `release` task rather than a manual `git tag` — it verifies the working tree is clean before tagging, and pushes the tag for you:

```bash
./gradlew release -Prelease.version=X.Y.Z
```

Without `-Prelease.version`, axion-release defaults to bumping the patch segment of the last tag. This project doesn't follow strict SemVer discipline for pre-1.0 releases (some past patch bumps included what would technically be minor features) — confirm the intended version number with the user rather than assuming either convention. The `release` task fails fast if there are uncommitted changes, so `git status` clean first.

## Architecture

Three source sets: `src/main` (plugin code), `src/test` (fast unit tests using `ProjectBuilder`), `src/functionalTest` (black-box tests using `GradleRunner`/TestKit that write real `build.gradle`/`settings.gradle` files to a temp dir and assert on build output — this is where most behavior is actually verified, since the plugins' effects are only observable through Gradle's repository/model APIs).

Two plugin entry points share the same credential/repository machinery:

- **`GithubPackagesPlugin`** (`io.github.duckasteroid.github-packages`) — applies to a *project* build script. Registers the `githubPackages { owner; repository }` extension and, in `project.afterEvaluate`, adds a Maven repo to `project.repositories` and (if `maven-publish` is applied) to `publishing.repositories`.
- **`GithubPackagesSettingsPlugin`** (`io.github.duckasteroid.github-packages-settings`) — applies to `settings.gradle`. Registers the same `githubPackages` extension on `Settings`, and in `gradle.settingsEvaluated` adds the repo to both `pluginManagement.repositories` and `dependencyResolutionManagement.repositories`.
