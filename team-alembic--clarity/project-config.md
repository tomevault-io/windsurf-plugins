# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Clarity is an interactive introspection and visualisation tool for Elixir projects. It automatically discovers and visualises applications, domains, resources, modules, and their relationships through a navigable graph interface. Currently in alpha (v0.4.0).

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server (runs esbuild/tailwind watchers, starts endpoint at :4000)
mix dev

# Run full check suite (formatter, credo, dialyzer, tests, etc.)
mix ex_check --no-retry

# Run tests
mix test
mix test path/to/test.exs           # Single file
mix test path/to/test.exs:42        # Single test at line

# Format code (uses Styler plugin)
mix format

# Build assets
mix assets.build

# Update usage rules documentation
mix usage_rules.update
```

## Architecture

Clarity is built around four main extension points, all registered via application configuration:

### 1. Vertex Types (`lib/clarity/vertex/`)

Define node types in the graph. All vertices implement the `Clarity.Vertex` protocol with `id/1`, `type_label/1`, and `name/1`. Organised by framework:

- `ash/` - Ash resources, domains, actions, attributes, policies, etc.
- `spark/` - Spark DSL entities, sections, extensions
- `phoenix/` - Endpoints, routers

### 2. Introspectors (`lib/clarity/introspector/`)

Analyse code to discover vertices and edges. Implement the `Clarity.Introspector` behaviour with `source_vertex_types/0` and `introspect_vertex/2`. Return `{:ok, entries}` where entries are `{:vertex, v}` or `{:edge, from, to, label}`. Return `{:error, :unmet_dependencies}` to retry later when dependencies are missing.

### 3. Content Providers (`lib/clarity/content/`)

Display information about vertices in the UI. Implement `Clarity.Content` behaviour with `name/0`, `applies?/2`, and render methods. Support markdown, mermaid diagrams, graphviz, and LiveView components.

### 4. Lensmakers (`lib/clarity/perspective/lensmaker/`)

Create filtered views of the graph for different audiences (architect, security, debug). Implement `Clarity.Perspective.Lensmaker` behaviour with `make_lens/0` and `update_lens/1`.

### Core Modules

- `Clarity.Server` - GenServer orchestrating introspection via PartitionSupervisor workers
- `Clarity.Graph` - Graph structure using `:digraph`, ETS tables, and tree graphs
- `Clarity.Graph.Filter` - Tuple-based query syntax for filtering vertices
- `Clarity.Router` - Phoenix router macros (`import Clarity.Router`, then `clarity "/clarity"`)

## Key Patterns

### Vertex ID Generation

Use `Clarity.Vertex.Util.id/2` for consistent, globally unique IDs:

```elixir
Util.id(MyVertex, ["parent", "child"])  # => "Elixir.MyVertex:parent:child"
```

### Module Detection

Always use `Code.ensure_loaded/1` before `function_exported?/3`.

### Graph Query Syntax

```elixir
{:==, :vertex_type, Clarity.Vertex.Module}
{:and, query1, query2}
{:in, :vertex_type, [Type1, Type2]}
```

## Configuration

Key config options in `config/config.exs`:

```elixir
config :clarity, :ash_domains, [Demo.Accounts.Domain]
config :clarity, :auto_start?, false
config :clarity, :introspector_applications, [:my_app]
config :clarity, :default_perspective_lens, "architect"
config :clarity, :editor, "code --goto __FILE__:__LINE__:__COLUMN__"
```

Register extensions per-application:

```elixir
config :my_app, :clarity_introspectors, [MyApp.CustomIntrospector]
config :my_app, :clarity_content_providers, [MyApp.CustomContent]
config :my_app, :clarity_perspective_lensmakers, [MyApp.CustomLensmaker]
```

## Code Style

- Formatter plugins: Styler, DoctestFormatter, Phoenix.LiveView.HTMLFormatter
- Use `@impl ModuleName` (not `@impl true`)
- Include `@spec` for all public functions except callbacks
- Router macros don't need parens: `clarity "/clarity"`

## Testing

Tests mirror the lib structure. Integration tests for graph operations, component tests for LiveView. The `dev/` directory contains a demo app (Demo, DemoWeb) used during development.

## Usage Rules Documentation

Detailed extension guides are in `usage-rules/`:

- `vertex-types.md` - Creating vertex types
- `introspectors.md` - Creating introspectors
- `content-providers.md` - Creating content providers
- `lensmakers.md` - Creating lenses

# Usage Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Consult these usage rules early and often when working with the packages listed below.
Before attempting to use any of these packages or to discover if you should use them, review their
usage rules to understand the correct patterns, conventions, and best practices.

<!-- usage-rules-header-end -->

<!-- usage_rules-start -->

## usage_rules usage

_A dev tool for Elixir projects to gather LLM usage rules from dependencies_

## Using Usage Rules

Many packages have usage rules, which you should _thoroughly_ consult before taking any
action. These usage rules contain guidelines and rules _directly from the package authors_.
They are your best source of knowledge for making decisions.
