# Copilot Instructions — Betting Cleanup

*Repository formerly known as `baseball-predictions`.*

## Project Overview

MLB betting analytics platform that generates daily wagering recommendations, backtests models, and displays results via a Streamlit dashboard. Side‑loaded data is cached on first access (no per‑tab delays), models retrain automatically in season via GitHub Actions, and a branded footer is appended to every page.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit (multi-page app in `streamlit_app/`)
- **Data Storage:** CSV and Parquet files (primary), PostgreSQL (optional)
- **ML Models:** XGBoost, LightGBM, scikit-learn
- **Charting:** Plotly, Altair
- **Scheduling:** APScheduler
- **API (optional):** FastAPI + Uvicorn
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud, Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Data Flow

1. **Ingestion** — Fetch MLB stats, odds, weather via APIs → save as CSV in `data_files/raw/`
2. **Consolidation** — Convert CSVs to Parquet in `data_files/processed/`
3. **Feature Engineering** — Build feature matrices from Parquet files
4. **Model Prediction** — Run XGBoost models → output probabilities
5. **Pick Generation** — Calculate edge vs. implied odds, filter by confidence
6. **Storage** — Save picks to `data_files/processed/picks_history.parquet`
7. **Dashboard** — Streamlit reads Parquet files directly via `src/data/queries.py`

## Coding Conventions

- Use **type hints** on all function signatures
- Use **dataclasses** for structured data (not plain dicts)
- Use **pathlib.Path** for file paths, never string concatenation
- Use **pyarrow schemas** when writing Parquet files for type safety
- Prefer **pandas DataFrames** as the primary data interchange format
- Pre-warm large datasets with `@st.cache_data` and call them once at startup to avoid repeated loads. Tabs should reference preloaded variables rather than calling data functions themselves.

- Use **Plotly** for interactive charts in the dashboard
- Follow **ruff** for linting and formatting

## Data Storage Rules

- **Primary storage:** Parquet files in `data_files/processed/`
- **Raw downloads:** CSV files in `data_files/raw/`
- **Never commit** raw data files or `.joblib` model files to git
- Use `pyarrow` schemas defined in `src/data/schemas.py` for consistency
- PostgreSQL is optional — only reference it in clearly marked "optional" sections

## Key Files

- `src/data/queries.py` — All data access functions (reads Parquet, returns DataFrames)
- `src/data/cache.py` — Streamlit caching wrappers around query functions
- `src/picks/daily_pipeline.py` — Main daily orchestration pipeline
- `src/bankroll/kelly.py` — Kelly Criterion bet sizing
- `streamlit_app/app.py` — Streamlit entry point

## ML Models

Three XGBoost models, each targeting a different bet type:
- **Underdog Moneyline** — Predicts upset probability for dogs at +120 or longer
- **Run Line (Spread)** — Predicts whether a team covers -1.5 / +1.5
- **Totals (Over/Under)** — Predicts whether the game goes over or under the posted total

Models are trained with `scikit-learn` pipelines and serialized with `joblib`.

## Current App Flow Updates

- Streamlit entry is `predictions.py` (home + 7 pages: Today, Stats, Matchup Analysis, Models, Performance, Pick 6, About)
- Home page now provides per-game actionable recommendations:
  - Moneyline (team + odds + edge), run line (side + odds + edge), over/under (line + odds + edge)
  - Badge signal: ✅ BET, ➡ LEAN, ⛔ PASS
  - Deep link button to Today game detail from each home card (channel: `schedule_selected_game` + `st.switch_page`)
- `page_utils._fetch_espn_odds()` now uses live ESPN core event odds endpoint fallback for full market spread data when scoreboard odds are missing.
- `page_utils._load_latest_odds()` now first checks `ODDS_API_KEY` (env or secrets), calls `src.ingestion.odds.fetch_current_odds()`, and falls back to latest saved odds CSV.
- `pages/1_Today.py` adds game context factors:
  - Park factor, umpire runs/g, bullpen IP/G, platoon matchup, rest days, day/night win%, IL list
- `pages/6_Pick_6.py` now provides DK player prop calculator + top scoreboard + season leaders for 6 event categories
