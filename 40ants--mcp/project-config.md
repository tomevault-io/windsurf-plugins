AWAYS, when you change docstrings in the exported lisp functions or classes or any lisp file inside `docs/` folder, build the documentation and ensure there is no warnings.

# How to build documentation

1. Ensure there is `DOCS-BUILDER` lisp package available. If not, then install `docs-builder` using quicklisp.
2. Build documentation using a command like this `(docs-builder:build "a-system-name-docs" :local t)` where `a-system-name-docs` should correspond a name of the file in the project root - ie, in this example there should be a file `a-system-name-docs.asd` in the root folder.
3. If there are some errors or warnings in the build log, show them to me and ask how to fix them.
4. Remember how we fix typical errors in the documentation in your persistent memory, and use this knowledge to fix similar problems automatically in future.

# Updating the documentation

**Important rule**: When you change any lisp file, do load the lisp library again before building the documentation.
