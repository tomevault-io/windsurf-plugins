# Agent Guidelines for Vertex AI GenMedia Creative Studio

This document provides guidelines for AI agents working on the GenMedia Creative Studio codebase.

## Scope of Work

- Do not modify code within the `experiments/` directory when refactoring or updating the main application. If a global change (like a model deprecation) impacts an experiment, add an inline `# TODO:` or `// TODO:` comment near the affected code in the experiment rather than attempting to refactor its logic.

## Styling

- Prefer using shared styles from `components/styles.py` for common UI elements and layout structures.
- Page-specific or component-specific styles that are not reusable can be defined locally within those files.

## Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

- All interactions with GCS for storing media or other assets should use the `store_to_gcs` utility function located in `common/storage.py`.
- This function is configurable via `config/default.py` for bucket names.

## Configuration

- Application-level configuration values, such as model IDs, API keys (though avoid hardcoding keys directly), GCS bucket names, and feature flags, should be defined in `config/default.py`.
- Access these configurations by importing `cfg = Default()` from `config.default`.

## State Management

- Global application state (e.g., theme, user information) is managed in `state/state.py`.
- Page-specific UI state should be defined in corresponding files within the `state/` directory (e.g., `state/imagen_state.py`, `state/veo_state.py`).

## Error Handling

- For errors that occur during media generation processes and need to be communicated to the user, use the `GenerationError` custom exception defined in `common/error_handling.py`.
- Display these errors to the user via dialogs or appropriate UI elements.
- Log detailed errors to the console/server logs for debugging.

## Adding New Generative Models

- When adding a new generative model capability (e.g., a new type of image model, a different video model):
  - Add model interaction logic (API calls, request/response handling) to a new file in the `models/` directory (e.g., `models/new_model_name.py`).
  - Create UI components for controlling the new model in a subdirectory under `components/` (e.g., `components/new_model_name/generation_controls.py`).
  - Create a new page for the model in `pages/` (e.g., `pages/new_model_name.py`), utilizing the page scaffold and new components.
  - Define any page-specific state in `state/new_model_name_state.py`.
  - Add relevant configurations to `config/default.py`.
  - Update navigation in `config/navigation.json`.

## Metadata

- When storing metadata for generated media, use the `MediaItem` dataclass from `common/metadata.py` and the `add_media_item_to_firestore` function.
- Ensure all relevant fields in `MediaItem` are populated.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions and model interaction logic.
- Aim to mock external API calls during unit testing.
- Use `pytest` as the testing framework.

## Code Quality

- Use `ruff` for code formatting and linting. Ensure code is formatted (`ruff format .`) and linted (`ruff check --fix .`) before submitting changes.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.
Run `bd prime` for workflow context, or install hooks (`bd hooks install`) for auto-injection.

**Quick reference:**
- `bd ready` - Find unblocked work
- `bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2` - Create issue
- `bd close <id>` - Complete work
- `bd dolt push` - Sync with git (run at session end)

For full workflow details: `bd prime`



## Issue Tracking with Beads (`bd`)

When working with issues using the `bd` (beads) command-line tool, adhere to the following tactical guidelines:

*   **Continuous Synchronization:** Always run `bd dolt push` at the beginning of a session to ensure your local issue tracker is aligned with the remote git repository. Run `bd dolt push` again at the very end of your session before your final `git push`.
*   **State Awareness:** When analyzing a bug or feature request, first run `bd ready` to check if there is already an existing, unblocked issue tracking the work. Do not create duplicate issues.
*   **Atomic Updates:** When you complete a task or fix a bug, immediately close the corresponding issue (`bd close <id>`) in the same commit or PR as the fix. Do not leave issues dangling.
*   **Clear Descriptions:** If you discover a new bug during your workflow that is out of scope for your current task, log it immediately using `bd create "Title" --type bug --priority <level>`. Ensure the description clearly outlines the reproduction steps and the context in which it was found.
