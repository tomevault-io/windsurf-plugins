## 🧑‍💻 Coding Rules for `slimfy`

### 1. Project Structure
- **`cmd/`** — contains the CLI entry points (e.g., `slimfy`, `fix`, `report`).
  - Each subcommand should live under its own file or subpackage (`cmd/scan`, `cmd/fix`).
  - Use [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for command definitions if needed.
- **`internal/`** — contains feature-specific packages (e.g., `parser`, `analyzer`, `fixer`, `reporter`).
  - Each package must encapsulate a single responsibility.
  - Packages under `internal/` should never import each other cyclically.
- **`pkg/` (optional)** — for reusable, generic libraries that are not specific to `slimfy`.

---

### 2. Testing Policy
- Each package must have **table-driven tests**.
- Use the `testing` standard library; no external testing frameworks unless strictly necessary.
- Test naming convention: `Test<FunctionName>_<CaseDescription>`.
- For CLI tests, simulate execution using `os.Args` and capture stdout/stderr.
- Keep coverage ≥ **80%** for all logic in `internal/`.
- Place example workflows under `testdata/` for consistent parsing tests.
- If using testdata, use the `testdata` package to load the files.

---

### 3. Code Style & Quality
- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
- Lint with `golangci-lint` (include checks: `gofmt`, `govet`, `errcheck`, `ineffassign`, `staticcheck`).
- Keep functions small and focused (≤ 50 LOC preferred).
- Avoid global state — use dependency injection for configuration and I/O.
- Return structured errors (`fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`) instead of printing directly.
- Do not use `log.Fatal` in libraries — only in CLI entry points.
- Prefer `context.Context` for cancellable or API-related operations.

---

### 4. CLI Design
- Command syntax should follow:
  ```bash
  gh slimfy [command] [flags]
  ```
- Each command must have:
  - `Use`, `Short`, and `Long` descriptions.
  - `Example` usage string.
- Output must be deterministic (JSON/Markdown/text).
- All commands must support `--json` and `--verbose` flags for scripting and debugging.

---

### 5. Error Handling & Logging
- Use structured, user-friendly errors:
  - CLI: human-readable messages.
  - JSON mode: structured error objects.
- Do not print stack traces unless `--debug` is enabled.
- Use `log/slog` for structured logging (no third-party logger).

---

### 6. AI Integration Guidelines
- Keep AI interaction logic (prompt building, result parsing) isolated in `internal/ai`.
- All AI prompts must be deterministic and version-controlled.
- AI suggestions should be *advisory*; never modify files without explicit user confirmation (`gh slimfy fix`).

---

### 7. Performance & Reliability
- CLI execution should complete within **1 second** for small repositories.
- Use caching for repeated workflow scans (optional: `.slimfy_cache.json`).
- Ensure deterministic file ordering when scanning multiple workflows.

---

### 8. Documentation & Developer UX
- Every package must have a top-level `doc.go` describing its purpose.
- Each command should have usage examples tested with `go test ./cmd/...`.
- Provide `README.md` with installation and usage instructions.
- Use `make` or `taskfile` for common developer tasks (`lint`, `test`, `build`, `install`).

---

### 9. Commit & Release Policy
- Conventional commits format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`.
- All PRs must pass linting and tests before merge.
- Versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/) principles.

---

### 10. Review Checklist
Before merging, ensure:
- [ ] Unit tests added or updated.
- [ ] Code formatted with `go fmt`.
- [ ] Linter passes without warnings.
- [ ] No CLI output regressions.
- [ ] Documentation updated if behavior changed.

---

These rules ensure `slimfy` remains **maintainable, testable, and extensible**, while aligning with Go community best practices and GitHub CLI extension standards.
