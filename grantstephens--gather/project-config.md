# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Gather is a community calendar application built with Go (PocketBase backend) and Preact (frontend). It supports event submission, moderation workflows, ActivityPub federation, RSS/iCal feeds, and location-based events using OSM data.

## Development Commands

### Quick Start
```bash
make dev          # Build backend, start Vite + proxied backend, auto-seed data
```

### Backend Development
```bash
make build-backend   # Build Go binary (includes embedded frontend)
make dev-backend     # Run backend in dev mode (proxies to Vite at :5173)
make run             # Start server (assumes already built)
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev     # Or: make dev-frontend
cd frontend && npm run build   # Or: make build-frontend
```

### Data Management
```bash
make setup-admin   # Create admin user (idempotent)
make seed          # Seed dummy data (requires running server)
make reset         # Clean everything including database
```

### Production
```bash
make prod          # Build, setup admin, seed, and start server
```

**Dev URLs:**
- Backend: http://127.0.0.1:8090 (proxies frontend to Vite)
- Vite: http://localhost:5173 (direct)
- Admin dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/
- Default credentials: admin@example.com / adminpassword123

## Architecture

### Backend Structure

**main.go**: Entry point that:
- Initializes PocketBase app
- Registers custom routes (RSS, iCal, ActivityPub, Webfinger)
- Sets up hooks for business logic
- Embeds frontend assets (production) or proxies to Vite (dev mode via `DEV=1` env var)

**internal/**: Core business logic modules
- `hooks/`: PocketBase lifecycle hooks
  - `users.go`: Enforce role defaults on user registration
  - `moderation.go`: Auto-set status, cascade blocking (events can't publish if place/tags pending)
  - Event hooks registered in main.go for AP publishing
- `activitypub/`: Federation support (actor, inbox, outbox, delivery, keys, webfinger)
- `rss/`, `ical/`: Feed generation
- `recurrence/`: Recurring event logic

**migrations/**: Database schema definitions
- `1709300000_collections.go`: Core collections (events, places, tags, settings, AP tables)
- `1709300001_user_role.go`: User role field
- `1709300002_places_tags_moderation.go`: Status fields for moderation

### Frontend Structure

**Preact SPA** with TypeScript, Vite bundler, and client-side routing (preact-router).

**src/lib/pocketbase.ts**: PocketBase client setup, TypeScript interfaces for all collections, auth helpers
**src/lib/theme.ts**: Dark/light theme utilities

**src/pages/**: Route components
- Home, Event, Submit, Edit, Tag, Place, Login, Admin

**src/components/**: Reusable UI components (MarkdownEditor, MiniCalendar, etc.)

**src/app.tsx**: App shell with header, nav, router, footer with theme toggle

### Data Model

**Collections:**
- `users`: Has `role` field (user/editor/admin)
- `events`: Has `status` (draft/pending/published/cancelled), supports recurrence, AP federation
- `places`: Has `status` (pending/approved), OSM integration
- `tags`: Has `status` (pending/approved)
- `settings`: Singleton for instance config
- `ap_followers`, `ap_delivery_queue`: ActivityPub infrastructure

**Access Control:**
- Published events visible to all
- Admins/editors see all events regardless of status
- Authors can update own events if not published
- Only admins/editors can delete events
- Users cannot set their own role (enforced via hooks)
- Places/tags created by non-superusers default to pending status
- Events cannot be published if associated place/tags are not approved

### Key Patterns

**Dev Mode Detection**: `DEV=1` environment variable switches backend to proxy frontend requests to Vite dev server on :5173

**Frontend Embedding**: Production builds embed `frontend/dist/` into Go binary via `embed.go`

**Moderation Workflow**: Places and tags have approval status; events are blocked from publishing if dependencies aren't approved

**ActivityPub Integration**: Events can federate via ActivityPub when published; hooks in main.go trigger AP delivery

**Authentication**: PocketBase handles auth; frontend checks user role for conditional UI/features
