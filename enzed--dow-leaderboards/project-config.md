# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A **production Next.js 14 + TypeScript application** that creates a public, mobile-friendly leaderboard site for Dawn of War: Definitive Edition. Live data from Relic's Community API is enriched with Steam player names and stored in Supabase for advanced features like player profiles, match history, and replay uploads.

**Status**: ✅ **Production site deployed** at https://www.dow-de.com

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **APIs**: Relic Community API + Steam API
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (replay files)

### Core Features

1. **Leaderboards** (`/`)
   - All 37 faction-specific leaderboards (1v1-4v4)
   - Combined 1v1 cross-faction rankings
   - Real-time sortable tables with search
   - Extended views (200/1000 players)
   - Rank delta tracking (24h history)

2. **Player Profiles** (`/profile/[profileId]`)
   - Comprehensive stats across all factions/modes
   - XP levels (calculated client-side from XP curve)
   - Recent match history
   - Rank history charts
   - Steam profile integration

3. **Replay System** (Replays Tab)
   - Upload `.rec` replay files (50MB limit)
   - Download community replays
   - Automatic parsing and metadata extraction
   - Player matching to database profiles
   - Rate limiting (20 uploads/hour per IP)
   - Profanity filtering on descriptions

4. **Player Search**
   - Autocomplete search across all players
   - Fuzzy matching via Supabase full-text search
   - Direct profile navigation
   - Country flag display

5. **Advanced Statistics Teaser** (Premium Feature Mockup)
   - Modal UI showcasing upcoming premium features
   - Price point survey ($2.99/month vs $4.99/month)
   - Email collection for launch notification
   - Lead capture in `premium_interest_leads` table
   - Toggleable via `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PREMIUM_TEASER` env var
   - **Not yet implemented** - mockup only for market validation

6. **Data Collection Scripts**
   - `seed:leaderboards` - Initial snapshot of all leaderboards
   - `enrich:players` - Steam ID/level/XP enrichment
   - `crawl:concurrent` - Match history collection
   - `crawl:watch` - Progress monitoring
   - `crawl:cleanup` - Stuck job recovery

### Data Sources

**Relic Community API** (`https://dow-api.reliclink.com`)
- `GetAvailableLeaderboards` - 37 leaderboards (cached 24h)
- `getLeaderBoard2` - Player rankings (cached 5 min)
- `proxysteamuserrequest` - Steam name resolution

**Supabase Database**
- `players` - All discovered players with enrichment
- `leaderboards` - Metadata for 37 ladders
- `leaderboard_snapshots` - Daily rank history
- `matches` - Match history with player performance
- `replays` - Uploaded replay metadata
- `replay_player_links` - Match replays to profiles
- `premium_interest_leads` - Market research for premium tier

### Core Data Structures

```typescript
// Ladder row (API + enrichment)
type LadderRow = {
  rank: number
  profileId: string
  playerName: string
  rating: number
  wins: number
  losses: number
  winrate: number  // (wins / (wins + losses)) * 100
  streak: number
  country?: string
  lastMatchDate?: Date
  faction?: string
  level?: number
  rankDelta?: number | null  // 24h change
  originalRank?: number      // for multi-faction views
  leaderboardId?: number
}

// Player (database)
type Player = {
  profile_id: string
  current_alias: string | null
  country: string | null
  steam_id64: string | null
  level: number | null
  xp: number | null
  first_seen_at: string
  last_seen_at: string
}
```

## Implementation Details

### API Routes

**Leaderboards**
- `/api/leaderboards` - Available leaderboards (24h cache)
- `/api/cache/leaderboard/[id]` - Top-200 ladder (5 min cache)
- `/api/cache/leaderboard/[id]/[limit]` - Extended ladder up to 1000
- `/api/cache/combined-1v1` - Combined 1v1 deduplicated by player
- `/api/cache/combined-1v1/[limit]` - Extended combined (up to 500/faction)
- `/api/cache/combined-1v1-multi` - All faction placements (players may appear multiple times)
- `/api/cache/combined-1v1-multi/[limit]` - Extended multi-entry view

**Players**
- `/api/players/search` - Autocomplete search via Supabase
- `/api/players/profile` - Profile + stats + recent matches
- `/api/cache/player/by-alias/[alias]` - Player lookup by exact alias

**Replays**
- `/api/replays` - GET: list replays, POST: upload replay
- Handles file parsing, player matching, storage upload

**Other**
- `/api/steam/players` - Current player count (cached from Supabase edge function)
- `/api/log-favorite` - Analytics logging for favorite leaderboards
- `/api/premium-interest` - Premium feature interest tracking (advanced stats teaser)
