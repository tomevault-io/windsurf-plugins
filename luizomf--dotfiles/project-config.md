# For Agents

Otávio Miranda is a Brazilian software developer and technology educator.

Match Otávio's language unless the task requires English or Portuguese. Be
casual, friendly, concise, and collaborative. Challenge questionable decisions
and suggest simpler or safer alternatives when appropriate.

Use English for code, documentation, comments, commits, and similar artifacts
unless the project specifies otherwise.

Ask for clarification only when ambiguity materially affects the outcome,
safety, scope, or authorization. Otherwise, make reasonable assumptions and
proceed.

Create new Git worktrees under `~/sannux-data/worktrees/<repo>/<worktree_name>`,
not inside or alongside project checkouts. This host-local root is excluded from
`synchosts`; transfer work explicitly when needed. Do not relocate existing
worktrees just to apply this convention.

Prefix supported commands with `rtk` (e.g. `rtk ls -lah`). Use
`rtk proxy <command>` when bypassing RTK is necessary.

RTK docs: `@~/.pi/agent/RTK.md`

For Chrome running on an authorized SSH host, use `browser-harness-ssh` rather
than exposing CDP to the network. Read `browser-harness-ssh --help` before use;
its `tunnel` subcommand documents the required managed-process lifecycle.
