# Working on kugiri

kugiri splits text into lines, words and characters exactly where the browser already broke it.
The whole library is one file, `src/index.ts`, with no dependencies. The demo page is the test
suite. This file is the one place agents read instructions from; the skills under
`.agents/skills/` hold the step-by-step procedures it points to.

## Layout

| Path                   | What it is                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/index.ts`         | The library. Built by `tsc` into `dist/`, which is what npm ships.                         |
| `demo/index.html`      | Every behaviour as a case: one `<section data-case>` per situation running text can be in. |
| `demo/demo.ts`         | The harness: splits each case as it scrolls into view and checks it against the paint.     |
| `demo/demo.css`        | The demo's styles: the classes cases rely on (`measure`, `narrow`, `drop-cap`), the boxes. |
| `tests/demo.spec.ts`   | Playwright: opens the demo, reveals everything, asserts every case's check reads ok.       |
| `scripts/release.mjs`  | The release, in one command, up to the tag push. `size.mjs` and `notes.mjs` serve it.      |
| `.github/workflows/`   | `pages.yml` publishes the demo on every push to main; `release.yml` publishes a tag to npm. |
| `.agents/skills/`      | Procedures: adding a case, probing a split in a browser, changing the library, releasing.  |

## Commands

```sh
npm run dev          # the demo on http://localhost:4173
npm run check        # tsc and Biome lint
npm run format       # Biome, with fixes
npm test             # Playwright against the demo, in Chromium, WebKit and Firefox
npm run build        # dist/
npm run size         # minified and gzipped bytes of the build
npm run release -- patch|minor|major   # see .agents/skills/release
```

## How the library works, and what must stay true

- **Two phases, never interleaved.** Every layout and style read happens first, against a layout
  that is still clean; every DOM write happens after. A read between writes forces a reflow and is
  a regression even when the output is right. `planContainer` and `planRun` read; `writeItems`,
  `cutRun` and the restatements write. The one exception is documented in `cutRun`: measuring a
  hyphen after the cut.
- **The browser decides where lines break.** Lines are read off the text with
  `Range.getClientRects()` and cut with `Range.extractContents()`. Nothing about the layout may
  change before it is measured, and nothing the split writes may move a wrap: word and char units
  are inline-blocks inside `text-wrap: nowrap` lines, sized to their painted extents, with the
  painted gap restated between them.
- **Only text is split.** Content is classified by how it lays out, not by tag (`classify`).
  Inline elements are cut into; block containers are split inside themselves; everything else is
  one piece. An inline-level piece rides along inside its line and counts as one word; a
  block-level piece is left where it is and is no unit; a float is put back in front of the line it
  floated beside and is no unit; hidden content is left alone. A floated drop cap is a float.
- **The split only structures and marks.** Units carry `data-line`, `data-word`, `data-char` and
  the same index as `--line`, `--word`, `--char`; masks carry `data-mask`; the target carries
  `data-split` and the counts. No animation, no colours, no opinions in the library.
- **Dependency-free, ES2022, one file.** The README states the built size. Keep it honest: the
  release script restates it, and a change that grows the library by more than a few hundred bytes
  gzipped deserves a second look.

## How to change behaviour

1. Find or add the case in `demo/index.html` that shows the behaviour. Every behaviour has one.
   Follow `.agents/skills/demo-case`.
2. Change `src/index.ts`. Comments in this file explain why, in full sentences, in the voice of
   the existing ones. Match that voice.
3. Run `npm run check` and `npm test`. All three browsers must pass. When a case fails, or to
   see what the split actually produced, follow `.agents/skills/browser-probe`.
4. Update the README (the "What a unit is" section is the contract), and add a line under
   `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` for anything a user of the library would notice.
5. The whole checklist is in `.agents/skills/library-change`.

## Conventions

- **Commits** follow Conventional Commits, enforced by a hook: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `ci`,
  `build`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`; header at most 72 characters, lowercase scope, a blank line
  before the body. The body explains why, not what. No attribution lines, no tool names, no
  co-author trailers.
- **Do not commit or push unless asked**, and ask again for each commit or push.
- **Prose** (docs, comments, commit messages, demo copy) uses plain sentences. No em dashes or en
  dashes: use a period, a comma, a colon or parentheses instead. Hyphens in compound words are fine.
- **Formatting** is Biome's, run by the pre-commit hook on staged files. TypeScript is strict.
