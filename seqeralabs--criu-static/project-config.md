# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a CMake-based build system for creating a statically linked version of CRIU (Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace) along with all its dependencies. The project builds CRIU v4.1 with all necessary libraries statically compiled to produce a self-contained binary and libcriu.o object file.

## Build Commands

### Configure the build
```bash
cmake --preset static-release
```

### Build the project
```bash
cmake --build --preset static-release
```

### Install or package
```bash
# Install directly
sudo cmake --install build

# Create package
cpack --config build/CPackConfig.cmake --verbose -B dist -G STGZ
```

### Patching CRIU

We are patching criu with the patches in the `patch/` folder.
From time to time we will need to update the CRIU version in our CMakeLists.txt.

To make sure that everything works, you can clone criu in `/tmp/criu` via

```bash
git clone https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu.git /tmp/criu
```

Then ask the user which version they want to try to update criu-static to.

Once you have done that change the git commit to the version that the user wants to test.

Now apply the patches in `patch` one by one making sure that criu builds.

To build criu, however you have to first obtain all the dependencies, but not any dependency. You want
the same dependencies that criu-static uses. criu-static patches criu to use CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
and other env variables instead of pkg-config, you can inspect what it does by checking `CMakeLists.txt`.

First build the dependencies by running `cmake --preset static-release` (this will fail at the CRIU step
if the version hasn't been updated yet, but all dependencies will be built).

The `CMakeLists.txt` configure step outputs the env vars you need. Look for these lines in the cmake output:

```
-- criu CFLAGS ...
-- criu LDFLAGS ...
-- criu PATH ...
```

Use those exact values. The full set of env vars that cmake passes to the CRIU make command is
(see the `ExternalProject_Add(criu ...)` section in `CMakeLists.txt`):

```bash
export CFLAGS="<value from cmake output>"
export LDFLAGS="<value from cmake output>"
export PATH="<value from cmake output>"
export CC=gcc
export CUDA_PLUGIN_LIBCAP_CFLAGS="-I<build>/libcap-install/include"
export SKIP_PIP_INSTALL=1
```

The PATH must include the directories for `protoc` and `protoc-gen-c` (protobuf compilers) that
were built as dependencies. Without this, the CRIU build will fail with `protoc: No such file or directory`.

Then build with:

```bash
cd /tmp/criu
make mrproper
# Copy descriptor.proto from the built protobuf
cp <build>/protobuf-install/include/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto images/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto
make CONFIG_AMDGPU=n STATIC_PLUGINS=y -j$(nproc) criu
```



### Alternative presets
- `static-debug` - Debug build with debug symbols
- `static-release` - Release build (default, optimized)

## Architecture

### Build System Structure

The project uses a sophisticated CMake build system that:

1. **External Dependencies**: Downloads and builds all CRIU dependencies from source as static libraries:
   - Protocol Buffers (protobuf & protobuf-c)
   - Network libraries (libnet, libnl, libmnl, libnftnl, libnftables)
   - System libraries (libcap, libaio, zlib, util-linux uuid, libintl)

2. **Dependency Management**: Each dependency is managed via individual CMake files in `dependencies/` directory, using the `register_dependency()` macro from `macros/dependencies.cmake`

3. **CRIU Integration**: The main CRIU build is handled as an ExternalProject that:
   - Downloads CRIU source code
   - Applies patches from `patch/` directory for static building
   - Compiles with all dependencies statically linked
   - Includes CUDA plugin compilation

### Key Components

- **CMakeLists.txt**: Main build configuration, sets up all dependencies and CRIU build
- **CMakePresets.json**: Defines build presets for different configurations  
- **dependencies/*.cmake**: Individual dependency build configurations
- **macros/dependencies.cmake**: Macro for registering dependencies with license tracking
- **patch/**: Contains patches applied to CRIU for static building support
- **jreleaser.yml**: Release configuration for GitHub releases

### Build Process Flow

1. Configure phase downloads and builds all static dependencies in order
2. CRIU source is downloaded and patched for static plugin support
3. CRIU is built with custom CFLAGS/LDFLAGS pointing to static dependencies
4. Final artifacts are installed: `criu` binary, `libcriu.o` object file, headers, and CUDA plugin

### Static Plugin Architecture

The build enables static plugins (STATIC_PLUGINS=y) and specifically compiles the CUDA plugin statically into the main binary rather than as a shared library, controlled by patches in `patch/criu-static-plugin.patch`.

### License Management

The build system automatically tracks all dependency licenses and consolidates them into `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt` for distribution compliance.
