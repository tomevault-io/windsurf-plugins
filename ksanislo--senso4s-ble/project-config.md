# Senso4s BLE — Development Context

## Project

Home Assistant custom integration for Senso4s LP/Propane gas-cylinder level
sensors over BLE. HACS-distributed from this repo.

## Architecture (rc8 onwards)

Built on HA's `ActiveBluetoothProcessorCoordinator` framework. The integration
does **not** maintain its own bluetooth callback / dispatcher / availability
state — the framework owns that lifecycle.

## BLE — what to know about the device

### Per the official protocol (v1.0, 2025-09-08)

- Adverts broadcast every 500 ms, **identical bytes between data changes**.
- Real measurement happens once per 15-minute cycle. Bytes only change on a
  successful measurement that differs from the previous one.
- During an active connection no other peer (including ours) can read adverts
  from the device.
- The doc claims "big-endian" everywhere but every worked example is
  little-endian. Trust the examples — our parser uses `<H`/`<h`.

### Wire format (Adv: 12 bytes after company-ID 0x09CC; legacy 0x0059 still accepted)

| Byte | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 (D1) | Upper nibble = model/warning flags. `0b1000` → BASIC; `<0b1000` → PLUS, with bits `0b0100`=MOTION, `0b0010`=INCLINE, `0b0001`=TEMPERATURE. Lower nibble = usage mode (1–5). |
| 1 (D2) | Mass %. `0x00–0x64` valid; `0xFF` not-ready/zeroing; `0xFE` batteries empty; `0xFC` setup error; `0xF1–0xF7` cycle-startup anomaly (PLUS). |
| 2–3 (D3) | Not relevant (debug). |
| 4 (D4) | Battery %. Raw integer — do not round. |
| 5 (D5) | Not relevant. |
| 6–11 (D6) | MAC. |

### Characteristics (service `00007081-…`)

| UUID | Use |
|---|---|
| `00007082-…` | Mass byte (same as D2). NOTIFY+READ. |
| `00007083-…` | Cylinder config: 5 bytes `<H` empty_dag, `<H` capacity_dag, byte usage_mode. |
| `00007085-…` | History stream: trigger by WRITE `0x00 0x00`; receives 4-byte records `<H mass_dag, <H duration_in_15min_cycles`. |
| `00007086-…` | Zeroing ("calibration"): WRITE `0x01` to start. Result-byte upper nibble carries warning flags (`0x40`/`0x20`/`0x10`); `0x00` = success. |
| `00007087-…` | Setup date: 7 bytes `<H year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `0` (constant). |

## How the integration actually behaves

### Lifecycle

- `async_setup_entry` seeds `coordinator.data` from `bluetooth.async_last_service_info`,
  backfills `CONF_IS_PLUS` if missing (one-shot, for entries created before rc8),
  starts the framework coordinator (`coordinator.async_start()`), and starts
  the 30s proof-of-life logger.
- Platforms (`sensor.py`, `binary_sensor.py`) register a
  `PassiveBluetoothDataProcessor` whose `update_method` converts our
  `Senso4sDeviceData` to a `PassiveBluetoothDataUpdate`.
- `binary_sensor.py` reads `entry.data[CONF_IS_PLUS]` to decide whether to
  register the four anomaly binary sensors. **Never** make this depend on
  coordinator data alone — at platform-setup time the cache may be cold.

### Availability — explicitly NOT delegated to the framework

The framework's tracker would mark the device unavailable ~60s after the last
advert (auto-tuned). Far too aggressive for a 15-min-cycle device.

- `AVAILABILITY_TIMEOUT_MINUTES = 60` in const.py.
- Both sensor and binary_sensor entities override `available` to read
  `bluetooth.async_last_service_info(...).time` directly from the BLE cache
  (which updates on every advert, *before* habluetooth's dedupe).
- Each entity registers a 1-minute `async_track_time_interval` to force
  `async_write_ha_state()` so the `available` getter is consulted on a known
  cadence even when no advert dispatches.
- RSSI sensor uses a **5-minute** tick instead of 1 minute — it's the only
  entity whose value actually changes on every refresh.

### Logging — three explicit channels, no hidden state

- `BLE RX [SCANNER]` — every 30s from the coordinator's proof-of-life timer.
  Reads the BLE cache directly so it appears regardless of dedupe.
- `BLE RX [DISPATCH]` — every advert that habluetooth dispatches past dedupe.
- `BLE RX [PARSED]` — parsed values after successful manufacturer-data parse.

### habluetooth dedupe — the core gotcha

`habluetooth/manager.py` short-circuits dispatch when the new advertisement's
