# NotebookLM Automation

Complete programmatic access to Google NotebookLM—including capabilities not exposed in the web UI. Create notebooks, add sources (URLs, YouTube, PDFs, audio, video, images), chat with content, generate all artifact types, and download results in multiple formats.

## Installation

**From PyPI (Recommended for AI agents — Python-version-aware):**
```bash
pip install "notebooklm-py[browser]"   # mandatory; errors must propagate

# [cookies] (rookiepy) is optional and known to FAIL TO BUILD on Python 3.13+.
# Skip it deliberately on 3.13+ rather than swallowing the error — that lets
# *real* install failures (typos, network, PyPI outages) surface for the agent.
if python -c "import sys; sys.exit(0 if sys.version_info < (3, 13) else 1)"; then
    pip install "notebooklm-py[cookies]"   # errors propagate
else
    echo "Skipping [cookies] on Python 3.13+ (rookiepy unavailable). Use 'notebooklm login' interactively."
fi
```

> Full install matrix (extras, headless servers, contributor flow): [Installation guide on GitHub](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/blob/main/docs/installation.md).

**From GitHub (use latest release tag, NOT main branch):**
```bash
# Get the latest release tag (requires curl + jq)
if ! command -v jq >/dev/null; then
    echo "jq is required to read the latest release tag" >&2
    exit 1
fi
LATEST_TAG=$(
    curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/releases/latest |
    jq -r '.tag_name'
)
# Includes [browser] so the interactive `notebooklm login` flow works.
pip install "notebooklm-py[browser] @ git+https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py@${LATEST_TAG}"
```

⚠️ **DO NOT install from main branch** (`pip install git+https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py`). The main branch may contain unreleased/unstable changes. Always use PyPI or a specific release tag, unless you are testing unreleased features.

**Skill install methods:**

- `notebooklm skill install` installs this skill into the supported local agent directories managed by the CLI.
- `npx skills add teng-lin/notebooklm-py` installs this skill from the GitHub repository into compatible agent skill directories.
- If you are already reading this file inside an agent skill directory, the skill is already installed. You only need the Python package and authentication below.

**CLI-managed install:**
```bash
notebooklm skill install
```

## Prerequisites

**IMPORTANT:** Before using any command, you MUST authenticate:

```bash
notebooklm login          # Opens browser for Google OAuth
notebooklm list           # Verify authentication works
```

If commands fail with authentication errors, re-run `notebooklm login`.

### CI/CD, Multiple Accounts, and Parallel Agents

For automated environments, multiple accounts, or parallel agent workflows:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `NOTEBOOKLM_HOME` | Custom config directory (default: `~/.notebooklm`) |
| `NOTEBOOKLM_PROFILE` | Active profile name (default: `default`) |
| `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON` | Inline auth JSON - no file writes needed |

**CI/CD setup:** Set `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON` from a secret containing your `storage_state.json` contents.

**Multiple accounts:** Use named profiles (`notebooklm profile create work`, then `notebooklm -p work login`). Alternatively, use different `NOTEBOOKLM_HOME` directories per account.

**Parallel agents:** The CLI stores notebook context per profile (`~/.notebooklm/profiles/<profile>/context.json`, with a legacy fallback to `~/.notebooklm/context.json` for the implicit default profile). Multiple concurrent agents that share a profile and use `notebooklm use` can overwrite each other's context — use one of the isolation strategies below.

**Solutions for parallel workflows:**
1. **Always use explicit notebook ID** (recommended): Pass `-n <notebook_id>` / `--notebook <notebook_id>` on notebook-scoped commands instead of relying on `use`
2. **Per-agent isolation via profiles:** `export NOTEBOOKLM_PROFILE=agent-$ID` (each profile gets its own context file)
3. **Per-agent isolation via home:** Set unique `NOTEBOOKLM_HOME` per agent: `export NOTEBOOKLM_HOME=/tmp/agent-$ID`
4. **Use full UUIDs:** Avoid partial IDs in automation (they can become ambiguous)

## Agent Setup Verification

Before starting workflows, verify auth is in place. **Use `--test --json` (not bare `--json`)** — bare `--json` only proves the cookie file parses; `--test` makes a network call and proves the cookies still authenticate against Google.

1. `notebooklm auth check --test --json` → require BOTH `"status": "ok"` AND `"checks.token_fetch": true`. Bare `"status": "ok"` (without `--test`) is a false-positive trap — a stale cookie file passes the parse check.
2. `notebooklm list --json` → expect valid JSON (may be empty for new accounts).
3. **If auth fails or is missing → run `notebooklm login` first.** This is the primary auth path: opens a browser, the user signs in to Google once, and the resulting `storage_state.json` is reused on every subsequent run. Works on any environment with a display.
