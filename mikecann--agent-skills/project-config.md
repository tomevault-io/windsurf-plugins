# Agent Instructions

Rules for contributing to this repository.

## Skill Philosophy

Skills in this repository should be narrowly focused on a specific task or workflow.

A good skill helps an agent take a concrete action, for example:
- set up authentication
- design a schema
- clean up generated code
- plan a migration

Do not create skills that mainly provide generic background information or broad documentation. If content is mostly reference material, it should usually live in docs, not as a standalone skill.

Reference material is fine inside a skill when it directly helps complete the task the skill is for.

Before contributing, review the core Agent Skills docs:
- [Overview](https://agentskills.io/home)
- [What are skills?](https://agentskills.io/what-are-skills)
- [Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)
- [Optimizing skill descriptions](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/optimizing-descriptions)
- [Evaluating skill output quality](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills)

If the skill uses bundled scripts, also review [Using scripts in skills](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/using-scripts).

## Style Guidelines

- **No emojis** in any markdown files or code comments
- Use `Yes/No` in tables instead of checkmarks or emoji
- Keep examples concise and focused
- Use `// Bad:` and `// Good:` comments in code examples
- Follow existing file patterns in `skills/`

## File Structure

Each skill should have:
- Clear heading with brief description
- "When to Use" section
- Code examples showing bad vs good patterns
- Complete, runnable examples
- Checklist at the end

## Maintenance

- If skills are added, removed, renamed, or substantially repositioned, update the root `README.md`
- Keep the skill list in the root `README.md` in sync with the current contents of `skills/`

## Validation

- Do not assume a skill is good just because it reads well
- Validate skills by trying to use them in a realistic temp project or sandbox
- Push the task as far as possible without human help
- If human intervention is required, stop and ask explicitly for the exact step needed
- After the run, feed what you learned back into the skill with clearer instructions, steps, gotchas, or validation checks
- For UI-facing skills, validate the browser flow as part of skill authoring, not just the code or CLI steps

## Testing With Skill Creator

For a more rigorous approach, use Anthropic's
[skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/skill-creator)
skill.

Recommended loop:

1. Draft or edit a skill
2. Define realistic test prompts and run the skill with and without the skill as
   a baseline
3. Grade the outputs with assertions and review them in the browser-based viewer
4. Improve the skill based on feedback, then repeat

It also includes a description optimizer that helps tune frontmatter
descriptions for better triggering accuracy.

Install it in Claude Code:

```bash
/install-skill https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/skill-creator
```

Use this when a skill is complex enough that reading it alone is not a
meaningful validation step.

## Code Examples

```ts
// Bad: description of the problem

// Good: description of the solution

```
