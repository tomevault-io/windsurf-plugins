# Commit messages and PR descriptions

- Never add a Claude signature, `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`, `Generated with Claude Code`, or any Claude session link to commit messages or PR descriptions in this repo. No exceptions.

# Design decisions

- A new decision gets a new file under `docs/adr/<domain>/`.
- A changed decision gets a new file that supersedes the old one; the old file keeps its text.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` describes the current state and links the ADR.
