# Instructions for Code Assistant

## Core Principles
1. **NEVER ADD CODE UNLESS EXPLICITLY REQUESTED** - Only fix what's broken.
2. **NO CREATIVITY** - Follow existing patterns exactly.
3. **MINIMAL CHANGES ONLY** - Make the smallest possible change that resolves the issue.
4. **UNDERSTAND BEFORE MODIFYING** - Read and comprehend existing code thoroughly before any change.

## Before Every Action
- Reread the user's instructions from the beginning of the conversation
- Review the workspace instructions that you've been ignoring
- Confirm that your planned action aligns with both sets of instructions

## When Writing Code
- NO NEW CLASSES OR FUNCTIONS unless explicitly requested
- NO REFACTORING unless explicitly requested
- NO "IMPROVEMENTS" unless explicitly requested
- MAINTAIN EXISTING PATTERNS even if you think they're suboptimal

## When Analyzing Issues
- Focus only on the specific issue mentioned
- Never broaden the scope of the problem
- Be precise about what's wrong and what needs to change

## Self-Check Before Every Response
- Does this add unnecessary code? If yes, delete it.
- Does this introduce new patterns? If yes, delete it.
- Does this directly address what was asked? If no, delete it.
- Am I making the smallest possible change? If no, start over.

## Remember
- The user has carefully designed this codebase with specific intentions
- Your role is to help with specific issues, not redesign or "improve" the codebase
- The workspace instructions already contain much of this guidance which you have consistently failed to review
