## General Guidelines

- When adding a new feature or data field, always implement it in **both** the admin panel and the storefront. For example, adding an image field to a model means updating the admin edit page, the server actions, **and** the storefront page that renders it (including relevant meta tags).
- This project uses Svelte 5. Avoid outdated Svelte 4 patterns.
- Add tests where appropriate when adding a new feature or modifying existing code.
- Keep the codebase lightweight and easy to understand.
- When modifying code, remove any functions, variables, imports, or declarations that become unused as a result of the change. Do not leave dead code behind.
- When adding fields to the `products` schema, also update the manually constructed `ProductWithRelations` objects in `src/lib/server/services/product-search.ts` and `src/lib/components/storefront/ProductListing.svelte`.

## Tools

- Run `./scripts/svelte-check.sh --threshold error` for type checking. This wrapper prevents the Vite dev server from crashing by preserving `.svelte-kit/generated/` timestamps that `svelte-check` would otherwise overwrite.
- After modifying files, run `bunx prettier --write <files>` on the changed files to format them.
- When making changes to the DB schema, generate a migration with `bun run db:generate` and apply it locally with `bun run db:migrate`. Migrations also run automatically on deploy via the build script. Do **not** use `drizzle-kit push`.
- **Reverting schema changes**: If a migration is reverted, you must also delete its SQL file (`drizzle/NNNN_*.sql`), its snapshot (`drizzle/meta/NNNN_snapshot.json`), and remove its entry from `drizzle/meta/_journal.json`. Leftover files will cause the next `db:generate` to fail or produce broken migrations.

## UI Guidelines

- Use shadcn/svelte for UI components and install new ones as needed. The project has **two separate UI component sets**: `src/lib/components/admin/ui/` (admin panel) and `src/lib/components/storefront/ui/` (storefront). The `components.json` `ui` alias points to storefront, so `bunx shadcn-svelte@next add <component>` installs there by default. After installing, copy the component to the correct path (admin or storefront) and delete the copy you don't need.
- Prefer existing UI components (e.g. `<Button>` over `<button>`).
- Use `cn()` for conditional Tailwind classes. Never use string interpolation in `class` attributes — always use `cn()` instead.
- Use `<AdminCard>` for card sections on admin detail pages.
- Admin UI components that use portals (dialogs, tooltips, popovers, etc.) must portal into `[data-admin]` (e.g. `to="[data-admin]"`) so that the admin theme CSS variables are available.
- Never nest `<a>` and `<Button>` — for link-styled buttons use `buttonVariants()` on the `<a>` directly (e.g. `<a class={buttonVariants({ variant: "ghost", size: "icon" })}>`).
- Remember to include responsiveness.
