# Prompt modules (skill-classification)

## Token budget

- Target ≤300 instructional tokens per `entry.md` body (trimmed). Approximate: `Math.ceil(trimmedUtf8Length / 4)` for English-heavy text.
- If content does not fit, split into another file under the same subtree (or for first-turn, another `shared/first-turn-classifier/*.md` fragment); never drop behavior silently.

## First-turn classifier merge

- [`skills/skill-classification/entry.md`](skills/skill-classification/entry.md) loads first.
- Then all `*.md` in [`skills/skill-classification/shared/first-turn-classifier/`](skills/skill-classification/shared/first-turn-classifier/) in lexicographic order, joined with `\n\n---\n\n`.
- See [`electron/services/skillLoader.ts`](electron/services/skillLoader.ts) `loadClassificationRootOnly`.
- The merged prompt contains multiple `<system_prompt>` blocks separated by `---`; that is expected.

## Outer wrapper

Every fragment file uses one stable envelope:

```markdown
<system_prompt id="unique-stable-id">
...
</system_prompt>
```

- `id`: snake_case, unique across fragments in the same merged prompt (first-turn: unique across `entry.md` + all `first-turn-classifier/*.md`).
- For forked skills, each leaf `entry.md` is one fragment; parent `entry.md` files stay thin (routing only).

## Inner sections

Inside `<system_prompt>`, use these XML blocks (lowercase tag names). Omit a section only when it is truly empty. Prefer one blank line between adjacent major tags; one line break between list items.

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `<role>` | 1–3 sentences: named agent + sole job. Plain text only (no markdown bold inside XML). |
| `<logic_flow>` | Numbered steps (`1.`, `2.`, …). Imperative instructions; phase labels in plain caps with a colon (e.g. `ANALYZE:`). Sub-bullets for branches; positive defaults first (“Prefer X when …”). |
| `<constraints>` | Hard rules: schema invariants, overrides, safety. |
| `<verbatim_handling>` | Optional nested block inside `<constraints>` when quoting user or stored text must not be paraphrased. Numbered rules; state when to copy exact bytes or lines. |
| `<formatting_rules>` | Output contract: JSON shape, “exactly one object”, no markdown fences, prose-only replies, optional `<thinking>` rules, markdown allowed for replay (e.g. blockquotes) when specified. |
| `<examples>` | Optional; after `<formatting_rules>`. At most one `<example>` with `<input>` / `<response>` if token budget allows. |

Do not use `**bold**` inside the XML instruction body; structure comes from tags and numbering. Backticks for literal tokens (`actions`, field names) are fine.

Reserve long “Never …” lists for irreversible mistakes; prefer tight IF or ALWAYS bullets in `<constraints>`.

## Structured output and `<thinking>`

Callers of [`generateStructuredResponse`](electron/services/ollamaService.ts) parse JSON via `sanitizeStructuredJsonResponse`, which strips a leading `<thinking>...</thinking>` block when present, then extracts the first balanced `{...}` object.

- Preferred instruction: ask for exactly one JSON object as the full reply (matches repair-turn wording).
- Allowed: optional `<thinking>...</thinking>` before JSON for chain-of-thought; keep reasoning free of stray `{` / `}` or parsing can fail.

Unstructured or chat-only prompts that never go through `parseStructuredResponse` may use richer formatting per their `<formatting_rules>`.

## Few-shot

- At most one minimal `<example>` per leaf if it fits the budget; otherwise omit or add a dedicated small fragment file.

## Validation (manual)

After edits, from repo root:

```bash
rg '<lore_fragment|</lore_fragment>|<output_format>|</output_format>' skills/skill-classification
rg '\*\*' skills/skill-classification --glob '*.md'
```

Both commands should return no matches inside fragment bodies.
