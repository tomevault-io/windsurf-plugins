# Coding Style — Lore

## Naming

- No abbreviations. Use full, descriptive names for variables, functions, parameters, and types.
- Boolean variables and functions should read as assertions: `isVisible`, `hasPermission`, `shouldRestructure`.

## TypeScript

- Strongly type everything. No `any`. Use `unknown` when the type is genuinely unknown and narrow it explicitly.
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions, intersections, and computed types.
- All function parameters and return types must be explicitly typed.
- Use `readonly` on properties and arrays that should not be mutated.
- Prefer `const` assertions and `as const` where applicable.
- Use discriminated unions over optional fields when modeling distinct states.

## Code Structure

- Keep functions small and focused. Extract helpers rather than nesting `if`/`else` blocks.
- Avoid deeply nested logic. Use early returns, guard clauses, and extracted functions.
- Reuse logic where beneficial — extract shared behavior into utility functions or shared modules.
- Use abstraction (interfaces, generics, composition) when it genuinely reduces duplication or clarifies intent. Do not force abstraction for its own sake.

## Comments

- Do not add comments that merely narrate what code does.
- Only comment when the intent, trade-off, or constraint is non-obvious and cannot be conveyed by naming alone.

## Error Handling

- Never swallow errors silently. Always log or propagate.
- Use typed error classes when distinguishing error categories matters.

## Imports

- Use named imports. Avoid default exports where practical.
- Group imports: external libraries, then internal modules, then relative imports.

## React / UI

- Functional components only.
- Extract reusable hooks for shared stateful logic.
- Keep component files focused — one primary component per file.
- Colocate styles, types, and helpers with the component when they are not shared.

## File Organization

- Use `index.ts` barrel files sparingly — only at module boundaries, not inside deeply nested folders.
- Name files after the primary export they contain.
