* Before submitting the PR, all contributions must pass linting. PRs will be rejected if they fail. Workflows are in place to automatically check if the code passes linting.
* Before submitting the PR, the code must be able to be built. PRs will be rejected if they fail. Workflows are in place to automatically check if the code can be built. 
* All agents and/or AI code contributions should identify themselves by prefacing their PR titles with the emoji 🤖. This will allow for an expedited review process and allow us to work directly with the agent in regards to their code.
* Agents should preferably be able to directly respond to comments left by the maintainers and codeowners within twenty-four hours. If the agent is unable to directly communicate without intervention, they should also provide alternative means of communication.
* PRs for new components are likely to be rejected unless the plan was previously communicated and permited.
* Labels - while all labels are permitted, the PR must be tagged with one or more specific labels. Please see `.github/workflows/pr-labels.yml` for a list of these.

Commits should contain individual "thoughts", plans, ideas, fixes, etc. In order to properly understand the changes, we must be able to understand any iterations made or adjustments performed, including any mistakes or fixes you made to your code. Do not group irrelevant changes into a single commit. 
* Do not submit a PR with irrelevant changes. We are not Congress passing a pork bill. These changes must be submitted as separate PRs.
