- **Migrations:** Manual schema updates needed
- **Status:** [ ] Current

---

## Development Practices

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

### When Adding Features
1. Create database models in `models/`
2. Implement repository methods in `repositories/`
3. Add service logic in `services/`
4. Create controller endpoints in `controllers/`
5. Add templates in `templates/`
6. Update requirements.txt if adding new dependencies

### Testing & Debugging
- Use `flask_output.log` for debugging
- Run debug scripts before fixing issues
- Test authentication flows thoroughly
- Validate database queries in repository layer

### Database Workflow
1. Define model in `models/__init__.py`
2. Create repository methods for CRUD operations
3. Use repositories in services
4. Call services from controllers
5. Always validate input before database operations

---

## Useful Commands

### Running the Application
```bash
python app.py
# or
flask run
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Open SQLite shell
sqlite3 instance/fashion_brand.db

# Backup database
cp instance/fashion_brand.db instance/fashion_brand.db.backup
```

### Debugging
```bash
python debug_login.py
python diagnose_login.py
python generate_images.py
python generate_mockups.py
```

### Requirements Management
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: Brief description of changes"
git push
```
