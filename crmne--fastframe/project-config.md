# fastframe agent guide

fastframe ("egui on rails") is the shared foundation of Carmine Paolino's
native egui apps: ZapFast, Spotifast, RekordFlash, TonePush, and the Chat with
Work local agent. It is a Cargo workspace of small `fastframe-*` crates. These
notes are for coding agents and new contributors. They apply unless a more
specific instruction in this repository says otherwise.

## Principles

- Extract from working apps, never design up front. A crate or function
  arrives here after it has shipped in an app.
- A piece moves in only once at least two apps have it. One app's need stays
  in that app.
- Small crates in one workspace, named `fastframe-*`, each with one job. Do not
  grow a crate into a grab bag; start a new one instead.
- Good defaults and few knobs. Apps keep their own decisions (branding,
  layout, product behaviour). Add an option only when two apps genuinely need
  different behaviour.
- No telemetry, no hosted services, nothing that phones home.
- Fix egui, winit and other upstream crates upstream. Do not vendor or patch
  them here.

## Extracting a piece

- Start from the apps' existing code and behaviour, not a new design. Read how
  each app does it today and keep what works in all of them.
- Keep the public API small and named for what it does. Document every public
  item (`missing_docs` is on); the crate README carries a usage snippet.
- Depend on published crates.io versions (`egui`/`epaint` "0.36", not a git
  fork). The crate must compile against both the release and the fork the apps
  patch in. Cargo only honours `[patch]` at an app's root, so fork pins cannot
  live here; a future `forks.toml` with a generator and CI check will manage
  them. Do not add it until asked.
- Prefer dependencies already in the apps' trees, at the versions they use.
  Justify each new dependency in a `Cargo.toml` comment.
- After the extraction lands, moving each app onto the crate is a separate
  change in that app's repository.

## Cross-platform discipline

- Every crate compiles on Linux, macOS and Windows. Put platform code behind
  `cfg(target_os = ...)` (or `cfg(unix)`) and give every public item a
  definition on every platform, even if it only returns a default or an
  `Unsupported` error.
- Keep platform-only dependencies under `[target.'cfg(...)'.dependencies]`.
- Keep parsers and mappings pure and platform-independent, so their tests run
  on all three CI platforms. Only the thin reader that talks to the OS is
  platform-specific.
- A change for one platform must keep the other two compiling. When you could
  not compile a platform locally, say so; CI is the check.

## Tests

- Every behaviour has a focused test. Changed behaviour gets a regression
  test.
- Tests never touch the network, D-Bus, the registry, or spawn processes.
  Inject readers (closures or pure functions over captured output) instead.
- Do not weaken a lint, delete a test, or add an `allow` to make checks pass
  without explaining why the rule does not apply.

## Checks

Run all of these before finishing:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --locked -p fastframe-log --all-targets --no-default-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --all-targets
cargo test --locked --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --locked --doc --all-features
cargo test --locked -p fastframe-log --no-default-features
RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --locked --all-features --no-deps
```

## Disk use

Builds go through [mbx](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev), enabled for mise users
by `mise.toml` (run `mise trust` once in each new checkout or worktree, or
mise refuses to run `cargo` there). It keeps compiled work in one shared
store, places each checkout's `target/` under a disk budget, and collects old
outputs on its own. Plain `cargo` still works for contributors who do not use
mise or mbx.

- Give each worktree and each parallel agent its own target directory. A
  worktree's own `target/` is enough, and mbx manages it; a second build in
  the same checkout uses `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/<name>`, which stays inside
  the managed target. Never point builds at a shared target directory: Cargo's
  lock serializes them, one worktree's test run can execute another's binary,
  and the store already shares compiled outputs.
- Never vary `codegen-units` or other compiler flags per agent. Each variant
  is a separate cache entry and fills the disk.
- Do not `cargo clean` to save space. `mbx gc --dry-run` previews collection
  and `mbx gc` runs it now; `mbx cache stats` shows what is held.
- When a build is colder than expected, `mbx explain --last` says what missed
  the cache and why.
- Never put build output or large scratch files in `/tmp`.

## Working style

- Work on `main`. Do not create a branch or pull request for work done with
  the maintainer unless explicitly asked. Pull requests remain required for
  outside contributions.
- Keep history linear. One focused commit per topic, never merge commits,
  fast-forward-only pulls, rebase unpublished work when necessary.
- Keep changes within the requested scope. Preserve existing behaviour unless
  the task explicitly changes it.
