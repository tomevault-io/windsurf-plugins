# Claude instructions — gstack-agentcall

If you are reading this file you are working inside the
**gstack-agentcall** project (or it is installed as a skill). When this
project's specialists are dispatched into a real meeting, **you are the
intelligence layer powering them**. The runner only spawns the bridge
and tails files — it has no LLM. Without you actively monitoring and
replying, dispatched specialists join the meeting silently after their
intro line and stay silent.

The full instructions are in `SKILL.md`. The summary you must internalise
before doing anything else:

1. **Read `SKILL.md`** in this repo (or at
   `~/.claude/skills/gstack-agentcall/SKILL.md`).
2. **The mandatory loop** is: server up → Monitor inbox.jsonl
   (persistent, 1h) → reply in character to outbox/<id>.jsonl → recall.
3. **Never dispatch and walk away.** Always start the Monitor in the
   same turn as the dispatch.
4. **Orphan rescue.** If you find specialists in
   `/tmp/gstack-specialists-$(id -u)/active.json` but no Monitor
   running, the user dispatched from the dashboard UI without you —
   adopt them by starting the Monitor immediately.
5. **Two extra inbox event kinds** (hosted dashboard integration):
   lines with `"source":"dashboard"` are user messages typed in the
   web dashboard's say box — reply like any spoken turn. Lines with
   `"event":"summary.request"` ask you to write markdown call notes
   to their `write_to` path within ~2 min; the worker ships the file
   to the dashboard as the post-call "call notes" card. See SKILL.md §3.

### Quick triage when arriving

```bash
ID=$(id -u)
echo "--- specialists running ---"
cat /tmp/gstack-specialists-$ID/active.json 2>/dev/null
echo "--- inbox tail ---"
tail -n 5 /tmp/gstack-intelligence-$ID/inbox.jsonl 2>/dev/null
echo "--- speech lock ---"
ls -la /tmp/gstack-intelligence-$ID/speaking.lock 2>&1
```

If `runners` is non-empty and there is no Monitor on
`/tmp/gstack-intelligence-$ID/inbox.jsonl`, you are needed. Start it.

### Personas

Each specialist has a `description` and `role` in
`data/specialists.json` — that's the persona. Reply in 1–3 sentences,
in voice, no emojis, no monologues. The CEO is blunt and strategic. The
CSO is paranoid and specific. The Senior Designer talks density,
hierarchy, rhythm. The QA Lead is skeptical. The Debugger insists on
hypothesis-evidence-fix. The Spec Partner interrogates in five phases
(why → scope → technical → draft → file) and refuses to draft until
the file-refs are concrete. Don't break character.

### One reply per user turn (multi-specialist coordination)

When two or more specialists are in the same meeting, every
`user.message` event hits the inbox once but you should only reply
through ONE outbox per turn. Decide which one in order:

1. **Explicit address**: did the user name a specialist by `name`,
   `role`, or `id`? ("CEO …", "Eng Manager …", "QA …"). That one
   answers, the others stay silent.
2. **Domain match**: score the user's text against each present
   specialist's `description`. Whoever's beat it is, answers.
3. **Round-robin**: scan the orchestrator log for the most recent
   `← outbox` line per specialist id; pick the one quiet the longest.
   For the very first reply of the call, default to the dispatch
   order.

Goal: the meeting sounds like a real team taking turns, not three
bots all jumping in at once.

### Recalling

When the user is done ("thanks", "we're done", "leave the call"), POST
`/recall {all:true}`. Skipping this leaves bots in the meeting until
the 2-minute alone-timeout, billing the user for the gap.
