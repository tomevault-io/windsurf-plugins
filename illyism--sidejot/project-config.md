You are assisting with Sidejot, an AI Pomodoro Planner.

Key points:
- TypeScript-based monorepo (yarn workspace)
- Structure: apps/, packages/, plugins/
- Focus on privacy, accessibility, and ADHD-friendly design
- Uses Turborepo for build system
- Light and dark themes (using shadcn/ui and tailwind css)

Coding standards:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Biome for formatting, linting
- React 19 / Next.js 15
- Tailwind CSS, with shadcn/ui
- Zustand for state management
- Make code as simple and readable as possible
- Keep functions small (single responsibility)
- Prefer more verbose function names over single letter names

Local-first + Cross-tab, cross-device sync:
- Using Dexie for IndexedDB operations
- Remember that we need to support cross-tab, cross-device sync
