# NFS Carbon (Xbox) static recompilation — notes for Claude

Xbox NTSC-U Need for Speed: Carbon (title 0x4541009E, XDK 5849, Most Wanted
engine: `NfsMWRelease.exe`), lifted to C with xboxrecomp and built for Linux
and Nintendo Switch (libnx NRO). Started 2026-10-03 from the NFSU1 port
(`..\nfsu1-xbox`), which came from the NFSU2 port (`..\nfsu2-xbox`; read its
CLAUDE.md for everything the runtime does on Horizon). Repo:
https://github.com/antoxa2584x/nfsuc-sw (`main`, commits as
`Anton Artemov <antoxa2584@gmail.com>`).

## Rules

- Never commit game data (disc, `default.xbe`, `switch_sd/`) or generated C
  (`gen/`). Ask before committing or pushing.
- The Switch build reads the **unpacked** disc at `sdmc:/switch/nfscx/game/`,
  never the ISO. Logs, `nfscx_env.txt` and shader caches live in
  `sdmc:/switch/nfscx/`.
- Linux test hygiene as NFSU2: one run at a time, kill by PID.
- Under gdb use `set disable-randomization off`.

## Layout and builds

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `/root/nfscx/` (WSL) | `game/` extracted disc (NFS/ZZDATA*.BIN), `gen/` lifted C, `build-linux/`, `build-abi/` (`-DRECOMP_ABI_CHECK`), `build-switch*/`, `run/` |
| `/root/nfscx/iter.sh` | one bring-up iteration: regen, stub tracing, build, run `SECS` (pad script `PAD=`), seed from the log |
| `/root/nfscx/snap.sh` | run `SECS`, print the APU reset counter and thread stacks (`THREADS=all`) |
| `/root/nfscx/stubtrace.py` | makes every unresolved stub log its first hit (`[STUB]`) |
| `xboxrecomp/` | vendored toolkit = nfsu1-xbox's + the kernel fixes below |
| `src/recomp_manual.c` | library overrides remapped from NFSU2 + Carbon's DSOUND watchdog skip |

- Disc: `xboxrecomp\Need for Speed - Carbon (USA).iso` (also
  `Downloads\...Carbon (USA).7z`), `python3 -m tools.xiso unpack`.
- Regenerate: `tools/regen.sh`. Linux: `cmake --build /root/nfscx/build-linux -j12`.
- Switch: `JOBS=6 bash switch/build.sh` / `VULKAN=1 BUILD_DIR=/root/nfscx/build-switch-vk JOBS=6 bash switch/build.sh`.
- Eden: `nfsu2-xbox\switch_sd\switch\nfscx` is a junction to this repo's
  `switch_sd\switch\nfscx`. Use the GL NRO in Eden.
- Icon: SteamGridDB Carbon cover (`assets/icon.jpg`); loader logo still NFSU2's.

## Findings

- **Libraries = NFSU2's (XDK 5849):** every D3D/DSOUND/XPP/CRT override
  matched 100%. Map (NFSU2 -> Carbon): BlockOnTime 0x2E8F20 -> 0x35A0C0
  (device ptr 0x2F7798 -> 0x368118), BlockOnFence -> 0x35A6D0,
  PersistDisplay -> 0x35BBA0, KickOff -> 0x359EE0, vblank 0x2F1D80 ->
  0x362050, PGRAPH 0x2F22F0 -> 0x3625C0, flip queue -> 0x362350, D3D SSE mul
  -> 0x35EE20, DSP ack 0x32EB65 -> 0x39406B, AC97 reset 0x33518D -> 0x399A64
  (table 0x39A6B0), DSOUND lock -> 0x391BB0/0x391BD2, memmove x2 0x32C800 /
  0x32ED70, _ftol2 -> 0x32C47C, XGetVideoFlags -> 0x2E9C77. Entry 0x2EA1E0.
- **Unresolved stubs are silent failures:** a direct call to an address not
  detected as a function becomes `sub_X(){ g_esp += 4; }`. 0x2F5F15 (a
  queue's get-next, tail-jumped to) returned garbage -> crash at 0x85000003;
  0x39B15C (XPP, after zero padding) never ran -> USB never started.
  `stubtrace.py` + `[STUB]` lines find the ones that run.
- **DSOUND EP watchdog (Carbon's DSOUND only, flags 0x400B):**
  sub_00394A2D checks `*[0x39AD08]` (EP DSP memory 0xFE85A018) for the EP
  firmware's 0xCCCCCC heartbeat and otherwise resets the APU (sub_003947ED).
  The APU model reads GP/EP memory as 0 (and must keep doing so: DSOUND's
  mailboxes there "complete" that way), so it reset ~60x/s. The wrapper
  skips the reset called from that check (return 0x394AD1).
- **NtSetTimerEx was a no-op** (toolkit): the timer was created and never
  armed; Carbon's intro movie froze on one frame waiting on it. Now
  SetWaitableTimer (one-shot; APC/period reported once). NtCreateTimer now
  honours TimerType (notification = manual reset). NtQueueApcThread is still
  a stub (logs its first calls; Carbon has not called it so far).
- **Pad never enumerated (fixed):** a byte of XPP's driver table at
  0x39AFFC decodes as `call 0x0039E9B0` -- the last byte of an instruction
  inside the USB enumerator sub_0039E8F0. As a function start it cut the
  enumerator after its first call, so after SET_ADDRESS + the 2 ms timer DPC
  (0x39EA3B) GET_DESCRIPTOR(config) was never sent. Toolkit fix
  (tools/disasm/functions.py `_prune_data_call_targets`, test
  test_prune_data_call_targets.py): a call target that splits a decoded
  instruction and is only called from outside every function is dropped. Then
  two more missed XPP functions (0x39D01D, 0x39C5C9; seeded). Debug recipe:
  `--trace-functions` with every XPP address + a logging wrapper on the URB
  completion dispatcher sub_0039C1DC ([urb+8] = next step's callback).
  (The 6 h timer at 0x4C5CC0 armed by game code is the auto power-off: not
  related.)
- **Console crash at boot (fix awaiting hardware test):** exception 257 at
  guest 0xF3E96000 -- D3DX copies a surface into the tiled framebuffer
  aperture (0xF0000000, a view of the contiguous window). Horizon cannot
  alias (`[NX] second view of a mapping refused`, `tiled aperture ...
  failed`), Eden and Linux do not fault. Device-aware functions now fold
  0xF0000000-0xF7FFFFFF onto 0x80000000 (XBOX_DEV_FOLD in recomp_types.h,
