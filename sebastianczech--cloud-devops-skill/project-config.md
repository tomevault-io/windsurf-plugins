# Cloud DevOps Skill

A skill for cloud-native DevOps engineers covering Terraform, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines on Azure and AWS.

## Scope

This skill covers:
- **Infrastructure as Code** — Terraform modules, state management, testing, and best practices
- **Kubernetes** — Cluster setup, workload management, networking, security, and GitOps
- **CI/CD Pipelines** — GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines
- **Azure** — AKS, networking
- **AWS** — EKS, networking

## Core Principles

1. **Infrastructure as Code first** — all infrastructure changes go through version-controlled IaC
2. **Immutable infrastructure** — prefer replacing over mutating running resources
3. **GitOps** — Git is the single source of truth for desired state
4. **Least privilege** — apply minimal permissions at every layer
5. **Shift left on security** — integrate security checks early in the pipeline
