# Message 14 for Gemini - Log Spam Fixed & Integration Progress

## Current Task Summary
Successfully fixed the excessive log spam issue and continuing development of the CreateLittleContraptions mod to ensure proper integration between Create contraptions and LittleTiles blocks.

## ✅ Accomplishments & Analysis

### 1. **Log Spam Issue - RESOLVED**
- **Root Cause Identified**: The `refreshAllLittleTilesRendering()` method was being called every frame for each LittleTiles block by the `enhanceLittleTilesBlockRendering` method in `CreateRuntimeIntegration.java`
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Commented out the excessive refresh call in line 646 of `CreateRuntimeIntegration.java`
  - Increased logging intervals from 5 seconds to 30 seconds
  - Reduced render logging frequency from every 150th call to every 1000th call
- **Result**: Log spam completely eliminated, game runs smoothly

### 2. **Mixin System Status - WORKING**
- ContraptionRendererMixin is successfully detecting LittleTiles BlockEntities
- Logs show: `[CLC Mixin HEAD] Found LittleTiles BlockEntity: BETiles at BlockPos{x=1, y=-2, z=0}`
- No mixin-related errors in our mod

### 3. **Mod Loading Status - STABLE**
- All mods loading successfully:
  - Create 6.0.4
  - LittleTiles 1.6.0-pre163
  - CreativeCore 2.13.5
  - CreateLittleContraptions 1.0.0
- No initialization errors

## 🔧 Current Code Snippets (Key Changes)

### Fixed Log Spam in CreateRuntimeIntegration.java
```java
// BEFORE (causing spam):
LittleTilesContraptionRenderer.refreshAllLittleTilesRendering();

// AFTER (spam eliminated):
// Don't refresh every frame - this causes massive log spam!
// LittleTilesContraptionRenderer.refreshAllLittleTilesRendering();
```

### Improved Logging Intervals in LittleTilesContraptionRenderer.java
```java
// BEFORE:
private static final long REFRESH_LOG_INTERVAL = 5000; // Log every 5 seconds
private static final long RENDER_LOG_INTERVAL = 150; // Log every 150th call

// AFTER:
private static final long REFRESH_LOG_INTERVAL = 30000; // Log every 30 seconds
private static final long RENDER_LOG_INTERVAL = 1000; // Log every 1000th call
```

## 📊 Log Snippets (Current Clean State)

**Latest Log Output (No More Spam):**
```log
[26mai.2025 17:42:31.551] [Render thread/INFO] [CreateLittleContraptions/Mixin/]: [CLC Mixin HEAD] Found LittleTiles BlockEntity: BETiles at BlockPos{x=1, y=-2, z=0}
[26mai.2025 17:42:33.927] [Render thread/INFO] [mixin/]: Mixing client.level.ServerVerifiedStateAccessor from littletiles.mixins.json
[26mai.2025 17:42:45.457] [Server thread/INFO] [net.minecraft.client.server.IntegratedServer/]: Saving and pausing game...
```

**Previous Spam (Now Eliminated):**
```log
// NO MORE of these excessive calls:
// 🔄 Refreshing all LittleTiles rendering in contraptions... (call #397, 396 calls in last 5009ms)
// ✅ LittleTiles rendering refresh completed
// (repeated hundreds of times per second)
```

## 🚧 Current Roadblocks & Next Steps Needed

### 1. **MovementBehaviour Registration**
Our mixins are detecting LittleTiles blocks, but I need guidance on:
- Are our registered MovementBehaviours actually being used by Create?
- How can we verify that LittleTiles blocks are properly participating in contraption movement?

### 2. **Actual Rendering Implementation**
The mixin is intercepting the rendering, but:
- The `renderLittleTileBEInContraption` method needs proper implementation
- We need to understand how LittleTiles' internal rendering system works within Create's contraption context

### 3. **Testing Methodology**
I need guidance on:
- What specific in-game scenarios should I test to verify the integration is working?
- How can I create a contraption with LittleTiles blocks to test visibility and functionality?
- Are there debug commands or visual indicators that would help verify the integration?

## 🎯 Specific Questions for Gemini

1. **MovementBehaviour Verification**: How can I verify that our registered MovementBehaviours are actually being used when LittleTiles blocks are part of a Create contraption?

2. **Rendering Integration**: Based on your analysis of Create's contraption rendering system and LittleTiles' rendering pipeline, what would be the correct approach to implement `renderLittleTileBEInContraption`?

3. **Testing Strategy**: What specific Create contraption setups with LittleTiles blocks should I test to verify that our integration is working correctly?

4. **BlockEntity Context**: Our mixin is detecting BETiles entities. How should we handle the context switching between the real world and the contraption's virtual world for these entities?

5. **Next Priority**: Given that the log spam is fixed and detection is working, what should be my next implementation priority to achieve visible LittleTiles in moving contraptions?
