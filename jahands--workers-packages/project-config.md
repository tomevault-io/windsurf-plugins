<title>Cursor Rules - Organization and Format</title>

<location>
<description>All cursor rules should be placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory with the `.mdc` extension.</description>

<requirements type="dont">
- `.cursorrules` file in the root (deprecated)
- Rules in other locations
- Rules with other extensions
</requirements>

<requirements type="do">
- `.cursor/rules/{descriptive-name}.mdc`
- One rule per file
- Clear, focused rules
</requirements>
</location>

<file-naming>
<requirements>
- Use kebab-case: `my-rule-name.mdc`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Group related rules with common prefixes
</requirements>

<examples>
- `github-actions-runners.mdc`
- `docker-compose.mdc`
- `development-workflow.mdc`
</examples>
</file-naming>

<frontmatter-requirement>
<critical>EVERY .mdc file MUST start with frontmatter - files without it won't work</critical>

<template>
```yaml
---
description: What this rule does (LLMs read this to decide relevance)
globs:
alwaysApply: false
---
```
</template>

<notes>
- description: Required - determines when LLMs read the rule
- globs: Keep empty for new rules
- alwaysApply: Keep false for new rules
</notes>
</frontmatter-requirement>

<rule-format>
<description>Rules must be written for LLM optimization. Prioritize machine readability over human readability.</description>

<critical>START WITH THE SIMPLEST STRUCTURE THAT CLEARLY CONVEYS YOUR RULE</critical>

<decision-tree>
Ask yourself:
1. Can I express this rule as a simple list of do's and don'ts? → Use simple template
2. Does this rule involve multiple interconnected concepts? → Consider complex template
3. Am I adding sections just because the template has them? → Remove those sections
4. Am I about to add a second example? → Stop. One is usually enough.

Remember: Empty sections add tokens but no value. Less structure often communicates more clearly.
</decision-tree>

<simplicity-first>
<principle>Start with the absolute minimum. You can always add more if truly needed.</principle>
<warning>If you're thinking "maybe I should add..." - DON'T. Only add what's essential.</warning>
<rule-of-thumb>If your simple rule exceeds 50 lines, you're probably over-structuring it.</rule-of-thumb>
</simplicity-first>

<rule-complexity-principle>
Use the minimum XML structure needed for clarity. Most rules only need:
- A title
- A list of requirements
- Maybe some examples

That's it. Don't add sections unless they add real value.
</rule-complexity-principle>

<simple-template>
<description>Use this template for 90% of rules - formatting, naming conventions, simple behaviors</description>
```yaml
---
description: Brief description for LLM rule selection
globs:
alwaysApply: false
---
```

```xml
<rule-name>

<title>Rule Title</title>

<rules>
- First requirement
- Second requirement  
- Third requirement
</rules>

<examples>
<example type="good">
```typescript
// Good code example
```
</example>
</examples>

</rule-name>
```

<stop-here>For most rules, you're done. Only add more sections if the rule is genuinely complex.</stop-here>

<example-guidelines>
<critical>ONE EXAMPLE IS USUALLY ENOUGH - Don't add more unless each shows a fundamentally different pattern</critical>
- Simple formatting rules: ONE concise example (<15 lines)
- If you're thinking "I should also show..." - DON'T
- Only add bad examples if the mistake is non-obvious
- Never show variations of the same concept
- Trust the LLM to generalize from one clear example
- Multiple examples are ONLY for rules with distinct subcategories
</example-guidelines>
</simple-template>

<complex-template>
<description>ONLY use this template for complex architectural patterns, multi-faceted systems, or rules requiring extensive context</description>
```yaml
---
description: Brief description for LLM rule selection
globs:
alwaysApply: false
---
```

```xml
<rule-name>

<title>Rule Title</title>

<context>
<applies-to>Where this rule applies</applies-to>
</context>

<overview>High-level explanation</overview>

<key-concepts>
- Important concept
- Another concept
</key-concepts>

<rules>
<rule>
<name>Rule name</name>
<requirements>
- Requirement
- Another requirement
</requirements>
</rule>
</rules>

<examples>
<example type="good">
```typescript
// Code
```
</example>

</rule-name>
```
</complex-template>

<xml-tag-guidelines>

<formatting-rules>
- No markdown headers (#, ##, ###)
- No text formatting (**bold**, *italic*)
- No emojis or Unicode symbols
- No redundant labels
- Use attributes for categorization
- Consistent patterns throughout
- Exception: Use markdown code blocks (```)
- Exception: Use markdown tables for comparisons
- Exception: Use backticks for inline code, commands, and technical terms
- XML tags only
- Every section needs an XML tag
- Use dash lists within tags
- Consistent nesting
- Semantic names
- Lowercase with hyphens
- Attributes for metadata
- Specific over generic
- No redundant text
- No markdown formatting inside XML
- No visual elements
- No generic tags like section, div, content
- No human-oriented formatting
</formatting-rules>

<xml-benefits>
- Unambiguous parsing
- Explicit hierarchy
- Consistent extraction
- No formatting ambiguity
</xml-benefits>
