# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Contributor Guide

This guide is for AI agents contributing to the Sprout codebase. It covers
agent-specific context and conventions. For general contributor info (setup,
code style, PR process, architecture), see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Repo Structure

```

## Getting Started

```bash
. ./bin/activate-hermit   # activate hermit toolchain (Rust, Node, etc.)
cp .env.example .env      # configure local environment
just setup                # install deps, run migrations
just relay                # start relay at ws://localhost:3000
just ci                   # run before any PR
```

See CONTRIBUTING.md for full setup details and dependency requirements.

## Quality Gates

Run `just ci` before every PR. It runs: Rust `fmt` + `clippy`, desktop lint
(Biome), unit tests, desktop build, and Tauri check. All must pass.

Run `just test` for integration tests if you touched `sprout-relay`,
`sprout-db`, or `sprout-auth` — these require a running Postgres and Redis.

Additional rules:
- No `unsafe` code
- Do not introduce new `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production paths — use `?` and proper error types
- New public API must have doc comments

---

## Key Patterns

**Dual API surface**: Sprout exposes both a REST API and a NIP-29 WebSocket
relay. Both paths converge on shared DB functions in `sprout-db`. When adding
a feature, implement the shared DB logic first, then wire up both surfaces.

**Event kinds**: All event kind integers are defined in
`sprout-core/src/kind.rs`. New features get new kind integers — add them here
first, then implement handling in the relay.

**Channel scoping**: Channels use `h` tags (NIP-29 group tag), not `e` tags.
Filters and queries must scope to `h` tags when operating within a channel.

**MCP tools — dual transport**: The MCP server in `sprout-mcp` uses two
patterns: write operations send signed Nostr events over WebSocket; read
operations call REST endpoints (see `relay_client.rs` for the HTTP helpers).
Add the REST endpoint or event handler first, then add the MCP tool that calls
it. Do not implement logic directly in MCP handlers.

**Workflow conditions**: `sprout-workflow` uses
[evalexpr](https://docs.rs/evalexpr) for condition evaluation. Keep expressions
simple and testable.

**Thread counters**: `reply_count` and `descendant_count` are materialized on
thread root events. Any code that inserts replies must update these counters —
check existing reply handlers for the pattern.

## Testing

```bash
just test-unit    # unit tests, no infrastructure needed
just test         # full integration suite (requires Postgres + Redis)
```

E2E tests live in `crates/sprout-test-client/tests/`:
- `e2e_relay.rs` — WebSocket relay protocol
- `e2e_rest_api.rs` — REST endpoint coverage
- `e2e_mcp.rs` — MCP tool surface
- `e2e_tokens.rs` — auth token flows
- `e2e_workflows.rs` — workflow engine
- `e2e_media.rs` — media upload/download (Blossom)
- `e2e_media_extended.rs` — extended media scenarios
- `e2e_nostr_interop.rs` — Nostr interop (NIP-50 search, NIP-10 threads, NIP-17 gift wraps)

Desktop E2E: `cd desktop && pnpm exec playwright test`

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the full multi-agent E2E guide.

## Desktop App

The desktop app is Tauri 2 + React 19 + Vite + Tailwind CSS. Features are
organized under `desktop/src/features/`. Biome handles linting and formatting.

```bash
just desktop-dev   # web-only dev server (faster iteration)
just desktop-app   # full Tauri app with native shell
```

---

## Mobile App (Flutter)

The mobile app lives in `mobile/` — a Flutter app using Riverpod + Hooks.

### Architecture

- **State management:** Riverpod + `flutter_hooks` (`HookConsumerWidget`)
- **Theme:** Catppuccin Latte (light) / Macchiato (dark) — matches desktop
- **Features:** Isolated under `lib/features/`, shared code in `lib/shared/`
- **Nostr models:** `lib/shared/relay/nostr_models.dart` — event kinds must
