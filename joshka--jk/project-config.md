# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a Rust 2024 workspace for `jk`, a jj-native terminal UI for
Jujutsu. The root `Cargo.toml` is workspace-only. The publishable
crates live under `crates/`:

- `crates/jk`: binary crate and current default workspace member.
- `crates/jk-core`: shared log records.
- `crates/jk-cli`: temporary `jj` process integration.
- `crates/jk-tui`: Ratatui state and rendering.

Release and CI automation lives in `.github/`, `release-plz.toml`,
`cliff.toml`, `deny.toml`, and `scripts/package-release-archive.sh`.
Short-term planning notes live in `.plans/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use `just` for local tasks:

```sh
just --list
just check
just test
just clippy
just udeps
just lint-md
just release-check
```

`just release-check` is the broad local gate: formatting, check,
tests, clippy, unused dependency checks, docs, packaging, install
smoke, and Markdown lint. `just build-release <target>` and
`just package-release-archive <target> <version>` support release asset
testing.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Rust formatting uses `rustfmt.toml` with unstable nightly rustfmt
options for comment wrapping, doc-comment formatting, import grouping,
and macro matcher formatting. Run the repo task before finishing Rust
changes:

```sh
just fmt
```

Use `just fmt-check` when checking formatting without editing. Both
tasks intentionally call `cargo +nightly fmt --all` so local formatting
matches CI and the full workspace is covered.

Rust comments and Rustdoc should be reflowed to the configured
100-character comment width. Do not hand-wrap Rust comments at 72 or 80
characters unless a narrower shape is needed for readability.

Keep Rust module names lowercase with underscores. Prefer clear, small
modules over broad utility buckets, stacked in abstraction layers where
each module owns one coherent concept. Avoid `unsafe`; the workspace
forbids it. Markdown uses `markdownlint-cli2`, 100-character prose, and
aligned tables.

Document Rust modules, items, and meaningful helpers by intent. Public
Rustdoc should describe the caller-facing contract. Private helper docs or
comments should explain ownership, invariants, side effects, or why the helper
exists, not restate the implementation. Binary crate roots should still have
crate-level `//!` docs when the package publishes docs.rs metadata.

## Testing Guidelines

Use Rust unit tests close to the module they describe. Name tests by
behavior, such as `refresh_keeps_selected_change_when_still_visible`.
Run focused tests while editing and `just release-check` before
release-oriented changes.

## Betamax Demo & Media Guidelines

Betamax tapes should show the behavior under review, not setup noise.
Hide setup work with `Hide`, build or fixture-prep while hidden, and
clear the terminal before the first visible frame. The first visible
frame should usually be either one clean command line or the app already
open when the command itself is not the point of the demo.

Avoid extraneous output unrelated to the behavior being shown. Do not
record dependency builds, `cd`, fixture setup, cargo output, shell
prompts from pre-work, cleanup commands, or transient diagnostics unless
that output is the thing under review. If a tape needs that work, run it
while hidden and use `Wait+Screen` or `Wait+Line` assertions before
showing the terminal.

Prefer PNG screenshots for simple UI states, layout checks, and
before/after comparisons that do not need motion. Use GIFs or videos
only when animation, navigation, typing, state transitions, or timing
are part of the behavior being reviewed. For GIFs, also capture one or
more PNG checkpoints when they make review easier.

Use readable dwell times, but keep them intentional:

- Wait on semantic screen text before sleeping.
- Use short sleeps, around `300ms`, after closing overlays or returning
  to the shell.
- Use medium sleeps, around `600ms` to `1200ms`, after opening a new app
  view or popup that humans need to read.
- Use longer sleeps only when the demo intentionally teaches a state or
  transition, and keep those rare.
- Clear captions with `Caption ""` before cleanup or any frame that
  should return to a clean terminal.

Keyboard overlays and captions should clarify the action being shown.
Avoid showing long setup commands in keyboard overlays; keep setup hidden
or disable overlays until the user-facing interaction begins.

## TUI App Layout Guidelines

Default to user comprehension over implementation structure. Screens,
overlays, hotbars, menus, previews, and other discretionary layout
should read like user-facing product surfaces, not debug views of
internal enums or dispatch order.

- Group actions and information by user task, not implementation type.
  Prefer broad groups such as Open and inspect, Move and find, Change
  actions, History and recovery, and Session.
- Keep labels concrete without repeating the same idea twice. Use a
  command name when the command is the clearest label, or use an action
  label when the action is clearer; avoid command-plus-parenthetical
  forms that restate each other.
- Align columns globally within a surface. Key, action, object, status,
