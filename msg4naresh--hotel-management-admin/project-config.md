## Project Overview

This project is a FastAPI-based backend API for managing hotel rooms, customers, bookings, and document uploads. It uses PostgreSQL as the database and AWS S3 for file storage. The project is well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns between API endpoints, business logic, data models, and services.

    uv run alembic upgrade head
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Docker
