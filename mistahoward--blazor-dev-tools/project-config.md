description: Architectural and coding standards for Blazor Dev Tools
---


# Core Principles
* **SOLID First:** Enforce single responsibility in both the C# services and the TypeScript extension scripts. Interfaces should be used for all inter-process communication boundaries.
* **Separation of Concerns:** The Chrome Extension should know nothing about Blazor's internals. It should only consume a standardized JSON messaging protocol. The Blazor library handles all reflection and runtime inspection.

# C# and Blazor Best Practices
* Use modern C# features (file-scoped namespaces, global usings, record types for immutable messaging payloads).
* Avoid tightly coupling the inspection logic to specific Blazor rendering models (Wasm vs. Server). Abstract the component state retrieval so it can potentially handle both.
* Dependency Injection: Ensure the library is easy to register in a consumer's `Program.cs` via a clean `IServiceCollection` extension method (e.g., `builder.Services.AddBlazorDevTools()`).

# Chrome Extension (JavaScript/TypeScript) Best Practices
* Use Manifest V3 standards strictly.
* Implement a clear message-passing architecture between the DevTools page, the Background Service Worker, and the Content Script.
* Keep the UI logic in the DevTools panel lightweight and reactive. 

# Code Generation Rules
* When generating new services or handlers, always write the interface first.
* Include XML documentation for all public C# APIs and JSDoc for complex JavaScript functions.
* Prioritize defensive programming when using C# Reflection to inspect components, as the component tree state can mutate rapidly.

# XML Documentation (C#)
* **Preserve existing `///` comments.** When editing C# files, do not delete XML documentation on types, members, or parameters unless the documented symbol itself is removed.
* **Update, don't strip.** If a signature, behavior, return value, or exception surface changes, revise the existing XML docs to match — do not remove them and leave the member undocumented.
* **Add for new public surface.** New public types and members still require XML docs per project standards.
* **Refactors are not doc resets.** Renames, extractions, and behavior-preserving rewrites should carry forward (and adjust) existing documentation rather than rewriting the implementation with bare members.
