# Tassel Development Requirements

## Code Implementation

- Add automated tests only for stable, deterministic code contracts or regressions that can be reproduced without user data or runtime infrastructure.
- Parameter parsing, mathematical invariants, and internal error contracts are suitable for automated tests.
- User configuration values, dataset availability, ROS/runtime environment, tuning results, and trajectory quality are user validation concerns; keep them out of unit tests and verify them through explicit manual runs when the required conditions exist.
- Pure data structures and trivial forwarding or assignment behavior do not require dedicated tests.
- Code must remain concise and maintainable.
- Function names must clearly communicate their intent.
- Variable, structure, and class names must be short and intention-revealing.
- Enum values must not use a `k` prefix.
- Before writing a function, search the codebase and verify whether equivalent functionality already exists.
- Reuse an existing function only when its full behavior is required. If only a small subset is needed, implement that subset directly instead of coupling the new code to unnecessary behavior.
- Branch and loop bodies must use braces, even when the body contains only one statement.
- When refactoring, choose the approach with the smallest practical impact on the existing architecture and module boundaries.
- Engineering contracts not expressed by types or function signatures, including lifetimes, index mappings, state transitions, layouts, and ownership, require concise Chinese comments.

## Theoretical Rigor

- Any change involving principles or mathematical formulas must be rigorously verified.

## Engineering Practice

- Before changing a function that affects upstream or downstream code, verify its impact on both sides and report the impact to the user. The user decides whether to proceed.
- When a user identifies an error and asks to remove a change, first inspect the context and verify both the diagnosis and the proposed removal.
- Treat violated internal invariants as errors and throw an appropriate exception instead of silently skipping invalid state.
- After each small change, save it to the Git staging area.
