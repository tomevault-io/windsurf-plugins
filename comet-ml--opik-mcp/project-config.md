# opik-mcp

IMPORTANT: every token this server puts into a host's context has to pay for
itself. Before adding output, a tool, a field or description text, say what it
costs (bytes on the surface, tokens in a typical answer) and what the user gets
for it. See [ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-context-budget-first.md).

- The advertised surface has a hard byte budget.
- Every `read` and `list` answer states its size.
- The caller can always narrow: a span, a filter, a window, `fields=[…]`.

## What this is

An MCP server that lets an AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, claude.ai) work with
a user's Opik data: traces, spans, threads, projects, experiments, datasets,
prompts and Diagnostics issues. The agent can answer "how is my project doing"
or "what broke", and make small changes like scoring or closing a thread. It
also authors the agent skills published as `comet-ml/opik-skills`.

How it ships: the `opik-mcp` package on PyPI (stdio, local API key), and a
Docker image served at `https://www.comet.com/opik/api/v1/mcp` (Streamable
HTTP, the user's OAuth token or API key passed through to the backend).

Stack: Python 3.13, uv, the official MCP python-sdk (`FastMCP`, pinned
`<2`), httpx to the Opik REST API, Pydantic.

How a call flows:

- `read` / `list`: `server/tools/` → `read_list/read_tool.py` or `list_tool.py`
  → the entity's `EntityHandler` from `read_list/registry.py` → its module in
  `read_list/entities/` → `client/` → Opik backend.
- `write`: `writes/write_tool.py` → `writes/dispatch.py`, which runs the
  operation from `writes/registry.py` through its hooks in `writes/operations/`
  → `client/` → backend. `schema(operation)` returns one operation's
  input on demand.
- `read_skill`: serves `src/opik_mcp/skills/` from `skills_catalog.py`.
- `instructions.py` renders the text a host receives on `initialize`.
  `analytics/` sends product events; it is off in tests.

## Commands

| Command | Proves | Run by CI |
|---|---|---|
| `make check` | lint + mypy + unit and conformance tests | yes |
| `make hermetic` | the real server process over stdio and HTTP, against a stub backend; not part of `make check` | yes, own job |
| `make slow` | the tests that spawn hooks, scripts, git, ruff and mypy; not part of `make check` | yes |
| `make skills-verify-source` | installing from this repo resolves exactly the authored skills | yes |
| `make conformance` | the MCP wire contract only, for fast iteration | inside `check` |
| `make live` | the tools against a seeded real Opik; needs `OPIK_URL` | yes, `live.yaml` |
| `make user-flows` | real agent (OPIK-8491) | not yet |
| `make install-branch` | installs this worktree as MCP server `opik-<ticket>` | no |

`make` runs mypy over `src/`, `tests/` and the scripts, and ruff over
everything, as CI does. Running them on `src/` alone misses test and script
errors.

## Invariants (a red test here is a contract, not a flake)

- The tool set is pinned, and the tool surface and the `initialize`
  instructions each have a byte budget; the instructions load even when a
  host defers tools. Record each change in the comment next to the budget.
  `tests/conformance/test_tool_inventory.py`
- Input schemas change only on purpose: `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1`, and the PR says
  why. `tests/conformance/test_schema_snapshots.py`
- Every sentence of an entity description has a probe.
  `tests/hermetic/test_description_claims.py`
- One copy of each answer, no `structuredContent`.
  `tests/conformance/test_no_duplicate_payload.py`
- Entity and operation logic stays in its namespace; root modules may not
  gain entity names. `tests/read_list/test_modular.py`,
  `tests/writes/test_dispatch_stays_generic.py`
- No telemetry from tests. `tests/repo/test_telemetry_disabled_in_tests.py`
- The lint and type baselines in `pyproject.toml` excuse findings that predate
  the rules and only shrink; a new file meets the full rules.
  `tests/repo/test_ratchets.py`

## Gotchas

- A new module-level cache or flag needs a reset in the autouse fixture in
  `tests/conftest.py`, or tests pass or fail by run order.
- Never author a skill outside `src/opik_mcp/skills/`. `.claude/skills/` and
  `.agents/skills/` are read by `npx skills add` and would ship to users. A
  hook and `Edit(...)` deny rules block Edit, Write, `tee` and `>` redirects
  there (checked live), but not `cp` or a script; `make skills-verify-source` in CI is the real check.
  The one deliberate exception is the cost intelligence guide,
  `src/opik_mcp/cost_intelligence/cost-intelligence.md`: served only in an
  AI Spend workspace, never published. Don't move it.
- Permission deny rules are guard rails, not a boundary (`git -C . push`
  gets past them). Branch protection on `main` is the real guard.
- Start the Claude Code session inside the worktree you are changing. Hooks,
  rules, agents and commands load from the session's project, not from the
  files you edit.
- The package's `_version.py` is generated by `make version`. Change
  `version.txt`.
- `docs/` tracks only `README.md`, `docs/<feature>/design-doc.md` and
  `docs/decisions/`. Anything else there is ignored and never reaches a PR.
  The repo is public.

## Workflow

- Plan locally before implementing; plans are not committed.
