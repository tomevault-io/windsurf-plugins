# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance to Gemini CLI when working with code in this repository.
This file is the master instruction and CLAUDE.md is automaticaly generated from this.

Refer to `website/docs/intro.md` for the overview & principles.

## Skill Files

The 12 markdown files under the `website/docs/skills/` directory contain the skill items categorized.

Each markdown level 1 header should have 6 to 10 level 2 headers as subsections.
Each level 2 header can have up to 5 level 3 headers as subsections.
The skill items are classified into those subsections.
You can place those items just after level 2 or 3 headers.

You should use grouping items instead of subsections when the group title is generic like "Cloud Services".
That is to meet MD024 markdownlint rules.

Each skill item should have a hyperlink which label is the concise linked website title.
The website should be its own project/product home or its article on Wikipedia.
And the item should have its abstract description string just after the link element.

The description string should be quoted from the linked site as much as possible.
The description string should start with "A" or "The", and must omit the trailing period.
Don't repeat the item name in the description string.

Make sure the markdown code meets the following markdownlint rules.

- MD024/no-duplicate-heading
- MD032/blanks-around-lists
- MD047/single-trailing-newline

Each entry is a paragraph which contains the deacription basically quoted from Wikipedia English version. It must include the date information of the event and must be arranged in chronological order.
