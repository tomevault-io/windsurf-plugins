# Response Conciseness

Default to concise final explanations to reduce token usage.

- Keep final answers short and task-focused.
- Include only the information needed to act on the result.
- Expand details only when the user explicitly asks for a deep explanation, walkthrough, or full rationale.
- For code changes, provide a brief outcome + key files changed; avoid long narrative unless requested.
- Prefer compact bullets over long paragraphs when listing results.
