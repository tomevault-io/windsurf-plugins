# Rules for Cram Tests

- Reuse helpers using setup scripts

- Utilities used inside of a test but are otherwise unrelated should be built
  outside of the test suite. See the `utils` directly for examples of such utilities

- To inspect direct output, lean towards using the trace using `$ dune trace cat`.

- Remove non-reproducible trace information using `$ jq`.

- Before adding new tests, search around the existing tests for duplicates and to find the best
  place to put this test.

- Do not use `--display short` unless it is the flag that is being tested.
