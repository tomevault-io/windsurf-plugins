- Google Fonts: Cormorant Garamond (headings), EB Garamond (body)
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Design Tokens

- Max-width: 640px (narrow reading column)
- Base font size: 18px
- Mobile breakpoint: 600px

## Aesthetic

Intentionally quiet, text-focused, and thoughtful. Serif typography throughout. This is a writer's site, not a business site — the design reflects that. The restraint is the point.

## What Codex Should Know

- This is a very small site. Two files do all the work: `index.html` and `styles.css`.
- Unlike valeriosafety.com, there's no `content.md` source-of-truth pattern — content is edited directly in `index.html`.
- No JavaScript, no forms, no external services beyond Google Fonts.
- Deploy by pushing to main. No build step.
- The aesthetic is deliberately minimal. Don't add visual complexity without being asked.
