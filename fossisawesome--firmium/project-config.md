# Agents Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines for autonomous and semi-autonomous task execution. Use when working on iterative debugging, research, testing, build configuration, and multi-step problem-solving in Firmium — across the desktop stack (native iced/Rust, targeting Linux and Windows) and Android stack (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose).

## 1. Search & Verify First

Don't speculate. Don't hide uncertainty. Use tools to ground claims.

Before proposing solution:
- Current state (crate versions, Gradle/Kotlin dependency versions, iced/cpal/symphonia/Compose API behavior): check it (`Cargo.toml`, `android/app/build.gradle*`, docs).
- Problem others have hit (iced/wgpu render errors, cpal/symphonia panics, keyring issues on Linux/Windows, Media3/ExoPlayer or Compose issues on Android): search for existing solutions.
- Uncertain about fact: verify, don't guess.

Can't verify (tool fails, no results):
- Say so explicitly. Don't pretend certainty.
- Propose what you'd check if you could.
- Ask user to run diagnostic or provide context (e.g. `cargo run` console output, `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` trace).

## 2. Tool Chains Over Single Actions

Connect tools into complete diagnostic or workflow.

Don't stop at one search result. Chain:
- Web search for problem → fetch full articles → extract actionable steps
- Run command to check state → search for why it's wrong → propose fix
- Apply fix → run/build → verify behavior in dev window

State chain explicitly:
```
1. [Search for] → found: [result]
2. [Fetch details] → learned: [insight]
3. [Run diagnostic] → state is: [finding]
4. [Propose fix] → verify by: [check]
```

Prevents chasing dead ends, makes reasoning auditable.

## 3. Autonomous Decisions

Act without asking when path is clear. Pause when ambiguous.

Proceed without asking:
- Run `cargo run`, `cargo check`, `cargo build`, `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- Search for error messages or known issues (iced, cpal, symphonia, reqwest, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Media3/ExoPlayer)
- Check config (`Cargo.toml`, `android/app/build.gradle*`)
- Diagnose system state (check audio devices, keyring availability, Android logcat)
- Propose fixes based on clear patterns (iced `Message`/`update` wiring, MD5 auth token format, Compose state hoisting, ViewModel wiring)

Ask before acting:
- Creating new files outside standard dirs (`src/`, `backend/`, `themes/`, `assets/`, `packaging/`, `android/app/src/main/java/com/fossisawesome/firmium/`)
- Modifying config files with broad impact (`Cargo.toml`, `android/app/build.gradle*`, `AndroidManifest.xml`)
- Deleting or overwriting anything
- Changing packaging/release config (`cargo build --release`, makepkg, NSIS, `PKGBUILD`, `firmium.spec`, Android Gradle assemble/release config)
- Interpreting vague requirements ("make it faster," "improve it")

Test: if user might reasonably disagree with choice, ask first.

## 4. Error Recovery

Retry intelligently. Escalate clearly when stuck.

When tool fails:
1. Try once more with adjusted parameters (different search terms, different command flags).
2. Still blocked, explain:
   - What did you try?
   - What was error?
   - What would unblock you? (user input, documentation, environment context)
3. Don't retry same thing repeatedly.

Facing ambiguity:
- Propose multiple interpretations, not best guess.
- Ask which matches user's intent.
- Continue once clarity exists.

## 5. Communication During Execution

Show work only when it matters. Stay quiet on routine actions.

Show tool invocations when:
- They failed or produced unexpected output
- Result directly answers question
- Chain of reasoning is non-obvious

Stay quiet when:
- Running diagnostic checks that confirmed expected state
- Performing routine searches with straightforward answers
- Executing standard, predictable steps

Always summarize:
- What you found (not raw output)
- What it means
- What comes next (or what you're blocked on)

## 6. Goal Verification

Define "done." Loop until verified.

For each task, state success criteria upfront:
- "Fix crossfade glitch" → verify: `crossfade_to()` transitions between sessions with no audio dropout, tested in dev window
- "Add new UI action / backend call" → verify: `Message` variant handled in `App::update`, backend fn called via `Task::perform`, result message updates `App` state and re-renders
- "Fix Subsonic auth issue" → verify: `generate_auth_params()` (desktop) / `AuthManager` (Android) produces correct MD5 token, login succeeds against real Navidrome instance
- "Fix Android playback issue" → verify: `AudioPlayer`/`NowPlayingService` plays/pauses/seeks correctly, foreground notification stays in sync, tested via `./gradlew installDebug` + `adb logcat`

Then loop:
1. Make change
2. Run verification check
3. Pass: done. Fail: diagnose and retry.

Strong criteria = operate independently. Vague criteria = constant back-and-forth.

## 7. Keep Docs in Sync
