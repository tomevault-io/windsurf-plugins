# GEMINI.md — Google Gemini Configuration

This file configures **Google Gemini** for this repository.

## Critical Rules

- **Never use local PHP.** All PHP commands MUST use: `docker exec aimm_yii <command>`

## Single Source of Truth

All project rules, architecture, and configuration are defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

**You MUST read and follow `CLAUDE.md` before making any changes.**

## Key References

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Project overview | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Rules | `.claude/rules/` |
| Skills | `.claude/skills/index.md` |
| Commands & paths | `.claude/config/project.md` |

## Quick Start

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for behavioral guidelines and prime directive
2. Check `.claude/rules/` for coding standards, architecture, security
3. Check `.claude/skills/index.md` for reusable task patterns
4. Check `.claude/config/project.md` for commands and file paths

## Definition of Done

See `CLAUDE.md` — same criteria apply to all agents.
