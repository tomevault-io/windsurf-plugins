# Testing and Linting Guidelines

All new functionality should be accompanied by comprehensive tests written using Vitest. Test files should follow the naming convention `*.spec.ts` and be co-located with the source files they are testing, or within a `__tests__` subdirectory if preferred.

## Test Coverage
Aim for high test coverage for all modules, including:
- Unit tests for individual functions and components.
- Integration tests for interactions between modules (e.g., agent-task interaction, crew execution).
- Tests for different configurations and edge cases.
- Mocking of external dependencies (LLM calls, tool executions where appropriate) to ensure tests are fast and reliable. Refer to existing tests like `[src/crew/index.spec.ts](mdc:src/crew/index.spec.ts)` for examples of mocking strategies using `vi.mock` and `vi.fn()`.

## Linting and Testing Workflow
Before committing or pushing changes, and especially before opening a Pull Request, ensure that all lint checks and tests pass.

Execute the following commands from the root of the workspace:

1.  **Run Linter:**
    ```bash
    pnpm lint
    ```
    This command will check the codebase for style and formatting issues using BiomeJS. Address any reported errors.

2.  **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    pnpm test
    ```
    This command will execute all `*.spec.ts` files using Vitest. All tests must pass.

Adhering to these guidelines will help maintain code quality, prevent regressions, and ensure a stable codebase.
