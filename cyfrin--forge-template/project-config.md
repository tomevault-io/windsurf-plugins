# Global Development Standards

Global instructions for all projects. Project-specific CLAUDE.md files override these defaults.

- Prefer Exa AI (`mcp__exa__web_search_exa`) over `WebSearch` for all web searches
- Use skills proactively when they match the task — suggest relevant ones, don't block on them

## Philosophy

- **No speculative features** - Don't add features, flags, or configuration unless users actively need them
- **No premature abstraction** - Don't create utilities until you've written the same code three times
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Prefer explicit, readable code over dense one-liners
- **Justify new dependencies** - Each dependency is attack surface and maintenance burden
- **No phantom features** - Don't document or validate features that aren't implemented
- **Replace, don't deprecate** - When a new implementation replaces an old one, remove the old one entirely. No backward-compatible shims, dual config formats, or migration paths. Proactively flag dead code — it adds maintenance burden and misleads both developers and LLMs.
- **Verify at every level** - Set up automated guardrails (linters, type checkers, pre-commit hooks, tests) as the first step, not an afterthought. Prefer structure-aware tools (ast-grep, LSPs, compilers) over text pattern matching. Review your own output critically. Every layer catches what the others miss.
- **Bias toward action** - Decide and move for anything easily reversed; state your assumption so the reasoning is visible. Ask before committing to interfaces, data models, architecture, or destructive/write operations on external services.
- **Finish the job** - Don't stop at the minimum that technically satisfies the request. Handle the edge cases you can see. Clean up what you touched. If something is broken adjacent to your change, flag it. But don't invent new scope — there's a difference between thoroughness and gold-plating.
- **Agent-native by default** - Design so agents can achieve any outcome users can. Tools are atomic primitives; features are outcomes described in prompts. Prefer file-based state for transparency and portability. When adding UI capability, ask: can an agent achieve this outcome too?

## Code Quality

### Hard limits

1. ≤100 lines/function, cyclomatic complexity ≤8
2. ≤5 positional params
3. 100-char line length
4. Absolute imports only — no relative (`..`) paths
5. Google-style docstrings on non-trivial public APIs

### Zero warnings policy

Fix every warning from every tool — linters, type checkers, compilers, tests. If a warning truly can't be fixed, add an inline ignore with a justification comment. Never leave warnings unaddressed; a clean output is the baseline, not the goal.

### Comments

Code should be self-documenting. No commented-out code—delete it. If you need a comment to explain WHAT the code does, refactor the code instead.

### Error handling

- Fail fast with clear, actionable messages
- Never swallow exceptions silently
- Include context (what operation, what input, suggested fix)

### Reviewing code

Evaluate in order: architecture → code quality → tests → performance. Before reviewing, sync to latest remote (`git fetch origin`).

For each issue: describe concretely with file:line references, present options with tradeoffs when the fix isn't obvious, recommend one, and ask before proceeding.

### Testing

**Test behavior, not implementation.** Tests should verify what code does, not how. If a refactor breaks your tests but not your code, the tests were wrong.

**Test edges and errors, not just the happy path.** Empty inputs, boundaries, malformed data, missing files, network failures — bugs live in edges. Every error path the code handles should have a test that triggers it.

**Mock boundaries, not logic.** Only mock things that are slow (network, filesystem), non-deterministic (time, randomness), or external services you don't control.

**Verify tests catch failures.** Break the code, confirm the test fails, then fix. Use mutation testing (`cargo-mutants`, `mutmut`) to verify systematically. Use property-based testing (`proptest`, `hypothesis`) for parsers, serialization, and algorithms.

## Development

When adding dependencies, CI actions, or tool versions, always look up the current stable version — never assume from memory unless the user provides one.

### CLI tools

| tool           | replaces     | usage                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rg` (ripgrep) | grep         | `rg "pattern"` - 10x faster regex search                                  |
| `fd`           | find         | `fd "*.py"` - fast file finder                                            |
| `ast-grep`     | -            | `ast-grep --pattern '$FUNC($$$)' --lang py` - AST-based code search       |
| `shellcheck`   | -            | `shellcheck script.sh` - shell script linter                              |
| `shfmt`        | -            | `shfmt -i 2 -w script.sh` - shell formatter                               |
| `actionlint`   | -            | `actionlint .github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions linter                   |
