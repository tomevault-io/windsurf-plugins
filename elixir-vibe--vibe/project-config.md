# Vibe Agent Guidelines

This repository is part of the Elixir Vibe organization.

## Core architecture

- Keep model-facing tool count minimal. Prefer Vibe helper modules callable from `Vibe.Eval` over narrow external tools.
- User-facing interactions should flow through UI-neutral session commands, typed semantic events, reducers, and renderer-neutral presentation values. Keep execution ownership in lifecycle modules such as `Vibe.Session.*Lifecycle`; keep context serialization in dedicated context helpers; keep TUI/Web limited to input adaptation and rendering.
- Auth, plugins, runtimes, slash commands, providers, storage imports, and similar extension points should be behaviour/protocol based so future implementations can be added without changing callers.
- Avoid static catalogs/registries when modules can be discovered idiomatically from compiled application modules or dependency availability.
- Design APIs for agents to use comfortably: return structured, compact, actionable maps with summaries and failure details in one call.
- Keep durable runtime state in local SQLite through Ecto schemas, migrations, and `Vibe.Repo`; do not add app-level raw SQL storage helpers. Use `Vibe.Storage.migrate!/0`, `Vibe.Storage.status/0`, and storage/search modules for lifecycle and introspection. Keep SQLite FTS DDL/query fragments isolated under storage FTS modules.
- Domain structs that cross JSON/storage/transport boundaries should use explicit boundary protocols or typed representation modules. Keep primitive JSON helpers primitive/container-only; avoid broad centralized encoders, arbitrary semantic `Jason.Encoder` impls, or static event-type codec maps when typed decoders can do the job.

## Eval, commands, and context

- Prefer eval aliases: `Cmd` (`Vibe.Command`) for supervised shell commands, `MD` (`Vibe.MD`) for Markdown output, and `Web` (`Vibe.Plugins.WebSearch`) for web access. Use `System.cmd/3` only for tiny bounded commands.
- Session eval state belongs in `Vibe.Eval`; per-agent scratch state belongs in `Vibe.Agent.Memory`; curated long-term facts belong in `Vibe.Memory` / `Vibe.Memory.Manager`.
- Model/role preferences live in editable TOML via `Vibe.Agent.Profile`. Model and effort switching are session-level semantic commands/keybindings first; slash commands should be thin aliases. Internal effort values follow Pi-style atoms: `:off`, `:minimal`, `:low`, `:medium`, `:high`, `:xhigh`; parse strings only at UI/config boundaries.
- `mix vibe` is the default interactive TUI entrypoint; preserve non-interactive paths through flags like `--print`, `--eval`, `--checks`, and `--sessions`.
- `vibe sessions` should be human-friendly by default: recent useful sessions only. Put exhaustive listings behind `--all` and destructive cleanup behind explicit subcommands.

## Web, plugins, and presentation

- Web access should go through `Web` and provider behaviours. Put network/provider concerns in request opts (`provider`, `timeout`, `headers`, search filters); put local result transformations in pipeable helpers (`Web.select!/2`, `Web.truncate/2`, `Web.filter_domain/2`, `Web.take/2`).
- Parse HTML with `Web.parse_html!/1` and Floki; never use regular expressions or ad-hoc string stripping for HTML.
- Markdown rendering belongs to `Vibe.Markdown` implementations and should be invoked with `MD.doc/1` or `MD.to_markdown/1`; do not add renderer-specific markdown/text helpers to unrelated modules.
- Plugins may run supervised background children, update semantic UI state through `Vibe.Plugin.UI`, register slash command modules through `Vibe.Plugin.commands/1`, and expose renderer-neutral output through `Vibe.Markdown` or `Vibe.Presentation.*` values.
- Core web UI should expose generic plugin surfaces only. Plugins own specific forms, labels, actions, and result semantics; core owns discovery, status, lifecycle, and generic rendering.
- Plugin-owned UI should use renderer-neutral presentation (`Vibe.Presentation.Document` / `Section` / `Widget`) and `Vibe.Plugin.UI`; avoid plugin-specific HEEx/HTML/Tailwind/ANSI contracts in core.

## Terminal/TUI

- Terminal rendering primitives live under `Vibe.Terminal.*`. TUI rendering should stay semantic and iodata-first; avoid raw markdown markers/fences and renderer-owned canonical semantics.
- Put detailed TUI behavior and reusable rendering guidance in the relevant module docs (`Vibe.TUI.*`, `Vibe.Terminal.*`, widgets, renderers) so both agents and users see it at the API boundary.
- Use shared TUI layout/widget helpers instead of ad-hoc width math. Preserve chat vertical rhythm: blank space between message blocks and between history and footer/status, no gap between footer and prompt.
- Loader/working indicators should be driven by BEAM events/timers and repaint immediately without waiting for keyboard input.
- Use MDEx streaming documents for partial LLM Markdown and Lumis terminal highlighting for fenced code blocks instead of hand-rolled parsers/highlighters.
- Storybook output is a visual regression surface; inspect it after changing TUI/Markdown rendering.
- Prefer `IO.ANSI` or established terminal libraries over raw ANSI escape strings. If raw terminal control is unavoidable, isolate it behind a small named adapter and document why.
