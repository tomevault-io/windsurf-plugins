# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agents1 when working with code in this repository.

## Project

`gnhf` ("good night, have fun") is a CLI that runs a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Rovo Dev, or OpenCode) in a loop inside a git repo. Each successful iteration is a separate commit on a dedicated `gnhf/<slug>` branch; failures get `git reset --hard` with exponential backoff. Target: Node 20+, published to npm as a single-file ESM bundle.

## Commands

```sh
npm run build          # tsdown bundle → dist/cli.mjs (the published binary)
npm run dev            # tsdown --watch
npm run lint           # ESLint on src
npm run format         # Prettier on src (format:check for CI)
npm run typecheck      # tsc -p tsconfig.typecheck.json --noEmit
npm test               # build, then vitest run (all tests)
npm run test:e2e       # build, then vitest run test/e2e.test.ts
npm run test:coverage  # vitest with coverage, excludes the e2e test
```

Run a single test file: `npx vitest run src/core/orchestrator.test.ts`. Filter by name: `npx vitest run -t "name substring"`. Unit tests live next to source as `*.test.ts`; the e2e test under `test/e2e.test.ts` shells out to the built `dist/cli.mjs` against a mock `opencode` server in `test/fixtures/`, so it requires a prior build (`npm test` and `npm run test:e2e` do this automatically).

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, format:check, typecheck, and test on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows with Node 24 - keep all four green. Releases are automated via release-please; never hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or `.release-please-manifest.json`.

## Architecture

Entry point is `src/cli.ts`. It parses flags with commander, resolves config, handles stdin/worktree/resume setup, then hands off to the orchestrator. Everything else is plain modules under `src/`.

### Run lifecycle (the critical flow)

1. `cli.ts` decides one of three modes: new branch, resume an existing `gnhf/<slug>` branch, or `--worktree` (creates a sibling `<repo>-gnhf-worktrees/<slug>/` checkout). When resuming with a different prompt, it asks whether to overwrite the saved prompt, start a new branch, or quit; if stdin is piped, that confirmation comes from the controlling terminal before any sleep-prevention re-exec. `setupRun`/`resumeRun` in `src/core/run.ts` create `.gnhf/runs/<runId>/` with `prompt.md`, `notes.md`, `output-schema.json`, `base-commit`, and `gnhf.log`, and add `.gnhf/runs/` to `.git/info/exclude` so run metadata stays local.
2. `Orchestrator` (`src/core/orchestrator.ts`) is an `EventEmitter` loop. Each iteration: build prompt via `src/templates/iteration-prompt.ts` (injects current `notes.md`), call `agent.run(...)`, then on success `commitAll` + append to `notes.md`; on failure `resetHard` and back off. Three consecutive failures abort. The `RunLimits` object enforces `--max-iterations` (between iterations), `--max-tokens` (mid-iteration via AbortController), and `--stop-when` (post-iteration, honored on both successful and failed iterations when the agent sets `should_fully_stop` in its output).
3. `Renderer` (`src/renderer.ts` + `src/renderer-diff.ts`) is a cell-based TUI using the alt screen buffer. `cli.ts` enters/exits alt screen around it. The renderer subscribes to orchestrator events, diffs frames to minimize writes, and updates the terminal title live. `MockOrchestrator` (`src/mock-orchestrator.ts`) drives the renderer offline via `--mock` for demos/testing.
4. Shutdown path: SIGINT/SIGTERM → `orchestrator.stop()` (aborts the active iteration, rolls back uncommitted work) → renderer exits → 5s force-exit timeout. If it's a `--worktree` run with zero commits, the worktree is removed; otherwise it's preserved and the path is printed.

### Agents (`src/core/agents/`)

Each agent implements the `Agent` interface in `types.ts` (`name`, async `run(prompt, cwd, options)` returning `{ output, usage }`, optional `close()`). They share two responsibilities: stream stdout, extract a structured `AgentOutput` (`success`, `summary`, `key_changes_made`, `key_learnings`) that matches `AGENT_OUTPUT_SCHEMA`, and accumulate `TokenUsage`. `factory.ts` picks one based on config.

- `claude.ts` / `codex.ts`: spawn the CLI per iteration in non-interactive mode. Codex uses `--output-schema` pointing at the run's schema file; Claude uses `--json-schema`.
- `rovodev.ts` / `opencode.ts`: long-running local HTTP servers managed via `managed-process.ts` (start once, reuse across iterations, close on shutdown). OpenCode creates a per-run session and applies a blanket allow rule to avoid prompt blocking.
- `stream-utils.ts`: shared JSONL parsing, `AbortSignal` wiring, and child-process lifecycle helpers. When touching agent streaming, start here.

Reserved args managed by gnhf are rejected in `config.ts` via `isReservedAgentArg` - if you add a new flag that gnhf controls, add it to that list so user overrides can't shadow it.

### Config (`src/core/config.ts`)

Loads `~/.gnhf/config.yml` (bootstrapped on first run). CLI flags override config; runtime-only flags (`--max-iterations`, `--max-tokens`, `--stop-when`) are never persisted. `agentPathOverride` and `agentArgsOverride` are per-agent; paths resolve relative to `~/.gnhf/` and support `~` expansion.

### Git helpers (`src/core/git.ts`)
