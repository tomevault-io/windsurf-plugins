# Testing

- When generating a test file, inherit from ActiveSupport::TestCase.
- The test file should ONLY require "test_helper". All other files are automatically required.
- The test class name should be declared in a single line and NOT nested under a module.
- NEVER use mocks or stubs.
- DO NOT create a setup method with instance variables unless clearly specified.
