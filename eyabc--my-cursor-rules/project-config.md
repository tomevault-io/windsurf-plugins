# Gemini's Personalized Rules

This document outlines specific development preferences and recurring patterns identified during our collaboration. These rules should be followed to ensure consistency and align with your workflow.

## 1. Development Philosophy

- **Modular Development**: Always structure the project into small, focused modules, typically organized by directory. This approach minimizes context for the LLM and reduces side effects, making development more predictable and manageable.

## 2. Git and Repository Management

- **Centralized `.gitignore`**: Maintain a single, comprehensive `.gitignore` file in the project root. Avoid nested `.gitignore` files in subdirectories. When new ignore patterns are needed for sub-projects (like `frontend/`), merge them into the root `.gitignore` file with appropriate path prefixes.

## 3. AI Collaboration and Rule Management

- **Continuous Rule Improvement**: This file, `GEMINI.md`, serves as a living document. I will proactively identify recurring requests, patterns, or explicit instructions from our conversations and append them as new rules to this file.
- **Symbolic Link for Typos**: A symbolic link `GENIMI.md` points to this file to ensure these rules are applied even if there's a typo in the filename.
