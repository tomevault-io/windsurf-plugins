# Working on SAX

**Use spec-driven flow by default unless prompted otherwise.** Keep it lightweight:
read the relevant contract, state the intended change and verification, implement,
then update specs/tests together. A small clear change needs only a short plan in
chat, not an approval ceremony or a new spec file.

## Specs and skills

- Start at [`specs/README.md`](specs/README.md); load only relevant subsystem specs.
- Baseline descriptions are evidence-backed observations, not proof that every quirk
  is intentional. [`specs/open-questions.md`](specs/open-questions.md) is not permission
  to silently fix unrelated behavior.
- Use [spec-change](.agents/skills/spec-change/SKILL.md) for behavioral changes or
  proposals, and [spec-check](.agents/skills/spec-check/SKILL.md) for reviews/refreshes.
  In Pi: `/skill:spec-change <task>` and `/skill:spec-check <scope>`.
- Record a proposal in `specs/changes/<slug>.md` only for consequential, ambiguous,
  or multi-session work. Keep proposed behavior distinct from the implemented baseline.
- Keep `specs/` out of the user-facing documentation build by default. Update `docs/`
  deliberately when users need an explanation of a changed contract.

## Code and verification

- Implementation: `src/sax/`; tests: `src/tests/`; notebook tests: `src/tests/nbs/`.
  Public exports live in `src/sax/__init__.py` and submodule exports.
- Read [`specs/verification.md`](specs/verification.md) for commands and known setup
  limitations. Prefer focused pytest checks first, then relevant regression checks.
- Normal targeted command:
  `uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test pytest <test-path> -q`.
  The tracked lockfile now passes `uv lock --check`. Do not silently regenerate it
  during unrelated work. Use `just smoke` for fast checks without synchronization;
  report use of an existing environment and any verification limits.
- `just test` includes notebook execution and user-kernel setup. Inspect `justfile`
  first: `just dev` clears `.venv`; `just clean` is destructive. Do not run them as
  routine inspection commands. Lint/type tooling is in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  and `pyproject.toml`; avoid auto-fixing unrelated files.
- Preserve S-dictionary `(input, output)` versus dense/COO `(output, input)` indexing,
  documented units, and static topology during numerical evaluation. Use asymmetric
  tests; check broadcasting, JIT, and real-objective gradients when relevant.
- Do not assume every backend/model is reciprocal, passive, energy-conserving,
  differentiable, or shape-equivalent. Specify the applicable domain and tolerances.
- Report checks as passed, failed, or not run. Never describe skipped checks as passes.

## Scope and working tree

Preserve unrelated changes. Do not create/switch branches, commit, stash, change
runtime behavior during spec-only work, or update dependencies without appropriate
user authorization. Ask about material ambiguity, not facts discoverable in code.
