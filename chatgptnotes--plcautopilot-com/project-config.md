## Karpathy Coding Guidelines

> Source: https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills
> Derived from Andrej Karpathy's observations on LLM coding pitfalls.

### 1. Think Before Coding
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — do not pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that was not requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

### 3. Surgical Changes
- Do not improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Do not refactor things that are not broken.
- Match existing style, even if you would do it differently.
- Only remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution
- Transform tasks into verifiable goals before starting.
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with a verify step for each.
- Define success criteria concretely — weak criteria require constant clarification.
