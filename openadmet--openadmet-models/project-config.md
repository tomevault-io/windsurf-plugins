# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

`openadmet-models` is a machine learning library for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) molecular property prediction. It provides traditional ML, deep learning, and active learning workflows through a unified, registry-based API.

## Install & Setup

```bash
mamba env create -f devtools/conda-envs/openadmet-models.yaml
python -m pip install -e --no-deps .
```

## Commands

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pytest -v -n auto --cov=openadmet.models openadmet/models/tests/unit

# Run a single test file
pytest -v openadmet/models/tests/unit/models/test_xgboost.py

# Run a single test
pytest -v openadmet/models/tests/unit/models/test_base.py::test_save_load_pickleable
```

Lint/format is enforced via pre-commit hooks (ruff, black, isort, flake8). There is no standalone lint command — run `pre-commit run --all-files` to check manually.

## Architecture

The library is organized around four registries, each backed by a `ClassRegistry` from `class-registry`:

- **`models`** — ML model implementations (`openadmet/models/architecture/`)
- **`featurizers`** — Molecular feature extractors (`openadmet/models/features/`)
- **`trainers`** — Training loops (`openadmet/models/trainer/`)
- **`evaluators`** — Metrics and cross-validation (`openadmet/models/eval/`)
- **`splitters`** — Data splitting strategies (`openadmet/models/split/`)

All registries are populated in `openadmet/models/registries.py` via wildcard imports. Import order in that file matters — concrete classes must be imported before the registry object.

Every component follows the same pattern: a Pydantic `BaseModel` ABC with `build()`, `save()`, `load()`, and `serialize()` abstract methods. Models fall into two subclasses of `ModelBase`:
- `PickleableModelBase` — sklearn-style models (XGBoost, CatBoost, RF, SVM, LightGBM)
- `LightningModelBase` — deep learning models using PyTorch Lightning (ChemProp, NEPARE)

The CLI entry point is `openadmet` (`openadmet/models/cli/cli.py`), with subcommands `predict`, `compare`, and `anvil`.

## Key Conventions

**Registering new components** — Decorate the class with `@models.register("key")` (or the relevant registry). Use wildcard `__all__` exports so `registries.py` picks them up via `from module import *`.

**Model config** — All model hyperparameters are Pydantic fields on the class. Extra kwargs are allowed via `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="allow")` so that underlying library kwargs pass through to the estimator.

**Training loops** — Use PyTorch Lightning (`lightning.pytorch`) for all deep learning training. Do not write vanilla PyTorch training loops.

**Docstrings** — NumPy-style for all classes, methods, and functions. Test files are exempt from docstring requirements.

**Code style**
- Max line length: 120 characters
- Ruff + Black formatting; isort with Black-compatible profile
- Sentence case in comments and print statements; acronyms (MPNN, MVE, ADMET, FFN) stay capitalized
- Do not number steps in comments; do not end comments with a period

## Unit Testing & Refactoring Rules

When writing or refactoring tests, you must strictly adhere to the following guidelines to ensure tests are mathematically sound, robust, and non-tautological:

* **Avoid Tautological Mocks:** Do not mock the system under test. Mock heavy I/O, external dependencies, or heavy data loading, but ensure the core logic of the target function is actually executed. Use lightweight synthetic datasets (e.g., small tensors or pandas DataFrames) instead of bypassing the execution entirely.
* **Standard Mocking:** Never write custom nested dummy classes or custom mock fixtures. Always use the standard `pytest-mock` library (the `mocker` fixture) to patch objects and verify calls.
* **No Lazy Assertions:** Never use `assert True`. Assert actual state changes, specific dictionary keys, object types (e.g., `isinstance(obj, matplotlib.figure.Figure)`), or verify file creation via the `tmp_path` fixture.
* **Robust ML Data Testing:** When testing data splitters or clustering algorithms, you must explicitly assert that the resulting train/validation/test sets are mutually exclusive (e.g., checking that set intersections of indices or arrays are empty). Ensure synthetic testing data has enough variance (e.g., diverse SMILES scaffolds) to meaningfully test the algorithm.
* **Safe Floating-Point Math:** Never use strict equality (`==`) to compare floating-point numbers. Always use `pytest.approx()` or `numpy.testing.assert_almost_equal()` to prevent cross-platform precision failures. Assert the actual math (e.g., UQ or metric calculations), not just the existence of the output.
