# Atlas Workspace

## Reading order

1. `context/08_AI_HANDOFF.md` — current pipeline state and next actions. **Read this first.**
2. `context/00_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — what this project is and is not.
3. `context/01_GOVERNANCE.md` — how the agents system behaves and how decisions are made.
4. `agents/GOVERNANCE.md` — binding rules for agent interaction.
5. `agents/journal/` — committed decisions with verbatim dissent.

## Constraints (always on)

- Do not redesign `agents/` without founder evidence requiring it.
- Do not generate products, startups, or architectures in research sessions.
- Do not auto-import content from any external skill library; consult only by name via `agents/REFERENCES.md`.
- Every committed decision produces a journal entry at `agents/journal/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`.
- Do not amend frozen docs without following the amendment process in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Working conventions

- The current canonical name of the framework is **`agents`**. "FounderOS" is historical only.
- The current canonical project name is **Atlas**. Previous names are preserved in `docs/project/PROJECT_HISTORY.md`.
- Confidence labels: High / Medium / Low / None. Confidence without cited evidence is forbidden.
- Files are changed explicitly, not silently. Edits always pass through the relevant governance rule.
