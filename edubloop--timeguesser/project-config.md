# AGENTS.md — TimeGuesser

<!-- workspace-kit-sync: v1.5.0 | synced: 2026-04-18 -->

## Architecture

TimeGuesser is a React Native (Expo SDK 54) iOS game. Players view a photo and guess where and when it was taken. Scoring rewards proximity to the actual location and year.

**Stack**: Expo Router (file-based), react-native-maps, react-native-reanimated, AsyncStorage. No backend — all logic runs on-device.

**Provider chain** (defined in `app/_layout.tsx`):
ThemeProvider → SettingsProvider → GameProvider → NavThemeProvider → Stack

**Game flow**: Home (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) → `startGame()` loads 5 rounds via `buildRoundsForGame()` → Game screen (`app/(tabs)/game.tsx`) cycles rounds → player places pin + picks year → `submitGuess()` scores via `lib/scoring.ts` → ScoreReveal overlay → after 5 rounds → Results screen (`app/(tabs)/results.tsx`) → reset.

**Photo pipeline** (`lib/photos.ts`): Fetches from Wikimedia Commons API, filters by metadata/category/quality, caches locally (max 50 images), tracks seen rounds via ledger, enforces era/geo diversity per game.

**Hints** (`lib/hints.ts`): 5 deterministic tiers — region → 1000km circle → 250km circle → exact location → full answer. No LLM dependency. Tier 1 free, tiers 2–5 cost −1,000 each.

**Settings** (`lib/SettingsContext.tsx`): Persisted to AsyncStorage under key `timeguesser.settings.v1`. Covers map provider, timer, photo source, filters, hint config, diagnostics.

**Design system**: Canonical tokens live in `constants/theme.ts` and `constants/Colors.ts`. Canonical design entrypoint for humans/agents is `TimeGuesser Design System/README.md` (ownership contract in `TimeGuesser Design System/CANONICAL.md`). `TIMEGUESSER_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` is the full rationale/spec narrative.

**Orientation**: Portrait locked globally. Only `app/photo-viewer.tsx` unlocks landscape.

## Workspace session-start check

From `TimeGuesser/`, run:

```sh
bash ../.workspace-notes/cadence_due_check.sh
```

If output is `[DUE]`, run `bash ../.workspace-notes/harness_healthcheck.sh` and append a row in `../WORKSPACE_AUDIT.md` under `Cadence Log`.

## Key Files

**Reading order**: For any change, read the spec first (`TIMEGUESSER_SPEC.md`), then the file(s) for the area you're touching, then check the hard constraints below.
