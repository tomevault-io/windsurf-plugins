# Human-in-the-Loop TDD Rules

Ensure the human stays engaged and can provide guidance at critical decision points during Test-Driven Development. Pause and explicitly ask for user feedback in these specific situations.

## Rule 1: End-of-Phase Confirmation

### When to Apply
At the **end of every TDD phase** (Red, Green, or Refactor), before proceeding to the next phase or test.

### What to Do
1. **Stop after completing the current phase**
2. **Summarize what was just completed**:

   **After Red Phase**: Which test was activated, prediction made and whether correct, type of failure achieved

   **After Green Phase**: Implementation approach taken, confirmation that test passes, trade-offs or decisions made

   **After Refactor Phase**: Refactorings attempted/completed (naming, mass calculations, structural improvements, rejected opportunities and why)

3. **Explicitly ask for permission to continue**:
   - **After Red**: "Red phase complete. Should I proceed to Green phase?"
   - **After Green**: "Green phase complete. Should I proceed to Refactor phase?"
   - **After Refactor**: "Refactor phase complete. Should I proceed to the next test?"

### Examples
```
Red Phase Complete:
Test Activated: "should return sum for two numbers"
Prediction: Runtime assertion error (Expected: 3, Received: 1) - Correct
Result: Test fails as expected with assertion error

Red phase complete. Should I proceed to Green phase?
```

```
Green Phase Complete:
Implementation: Added split/map/reduce logic for comma-separated numbers
Result: All tests now pass
Approach: Minimal implementation using built-in array methods

Green phase complete. Should I proceed to Refactor phase?
```

```
Refactor Phase Complete:
Refactoring:
- Evaluated naming: kept `sumCommaSeparatedNumbers` (already clear)
- Mass calculation: remains at 38 (no improvements found)
- Considered helper functions but would increase complexity

Refactor phase complete. Should I proceed to the next test?
```

## Rule 2: Failed Prediction Recovery

### When to Apply
When the **"Guessing Game" prediction fails** - the actual test result differs significantly from what was predicted.

### What to Do
1. **Stop the TDD cycle immediately**
2. **Explain**: What was predicted, what actually happened, why the prediction was wrong
3. **Assess**: Does this indicate a misunderstanding? Are there issues with the test or implementation?
4. **Explicitly ask**: "My prediction was incorrect. Should I continue with the TDD process, or would you like me to investigate this discrepancy further?"

## Core Principle: Never Proceed Without Permission

- **Stop after every single phase** (Red, Green, Refactor)
- **Implement only what the current phase requires**
- **No lookahead or anticipatory coding**
- **No additional features without explicit human approval**
- **Each phase must be approved before continuing to next phase**

### When to ALWAYS Stop
- After every TDD phase (Red, Green, Refactor) - MANDATORY
- Before proceeding to next phase - Human must approve
- Before writing any additional code

### When to IMMEDIATELY Stop
- Significant prediction failures
- Unexpected test results
- Unanticipated compilation errors
