# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
flutter pub get              # Install dependencies
flutter analyze              # Run linter
flutter run -d linux         # Run on Linux (or macos/windows)
flutter build linux --release
flutter test                 # Run tests
flutter test test/widget_test.dart  # Run single test file
```

## Architecture

LLMtary is a Flutter desktop app for AI-assisted penetration testing. It accepts JSON reconnaissance data for a target, uses an LLM to identify vulnerabilities, then executes test commands to validate each finding.

### Core Data Flow

1. **Input**: User enters targets (IPs, hostnames, FQDNs, or CIDR ranges — comma or newline separated, or imported from a file) into the **SCOPE / RECON** tab, with optional exclusions and Rules of Engagement. The built-in `ReconService` then autonomously collects scan data via an LLM-guided recon loop. Recon output is stored per-target and merged into the device data.
2. **Analysis** (2-phase): `VulnerabilityAnalyzer` runs a phased pipeline:
   - **Phase 1** — fast context discovery: CVE/version matching, DNS/OSINT, network services, SNMP. Results build a context block.
   - **Phase 2** — full vulnerability analysis: all web, AD, tech-specific, and specialized prompts, each enriched with Phase 1 context. Phase 2 findings are more targeted because they know what Phase 1 found.
   - Post-analysis: deduplication, evidence-quote validation, businessRisk-aware sort, and (if ≥2 HIGH/CRITICAL AD findings) a BloodHound-style attack chain reasoning pass.
3. **Execution**: `ExploitExecutor` runs an agentic loop (max 10 iterations per vuln) generating and running OS commands, then determining vuln status (confirmed/not_vulnerable/undetermined). Includes OPSEC guidance injection and rate-limit detection.
4. **Chain reasoning**: After all vulns are tested, if ≥2 are confirmed, a post-execution chain reasoning pass identifies multi-step attack paths and adds them as `AttackChain` findings.
5. **Persistence**: SQLite via `DatabaseHelper`; global UI state via `AppState` (Provider/ChangeNotifier)

### Key Services

- **`recon_service.dart`** — Autonomous LLM-guided reconnaissance engine. Runs discovery commands (nmap, DNS, web fingerprinting) and builds/enriches device JSON before analysis. Defines `ReconPhase` enum (`portScan`, `serviceBanner`, `webFingerprint`, `dnsEnum`, `osDetect`), `ReconResult` model (structured recon output that merges into device JSON), nmap XML parser, banner grabber, WAF detector, and DNS/certificate hostname extractors. The `enrichWithRecon()` static method is the integration point — call it before `VulnerabilityAnalyzer.analyzeDevice()` to enrich user-supplied JSON with automated recon data.
- **`exploit_executor.dart`** (largest file, ~91KB) — Orchestrates the active testing loop. Builds compact context from device JSON (only ports relevant to the vulnerability), calls LLM for commands, executes them, detects stuck loops (repeated failures / unreachable target), validates whether tests actually reached the target. Includes lockout-aware spray counter (hard interception when safety threshold exceeded), subdomain takeover fast-path verification, and post-exploitation pillaging with lateral movement/persistence/domain dominance/pivoting prompts.
- **`vulnerability_analyzer.dart`** — Fires batched analysis prompts based on target scope (internal RFC-1918 vs external/FQDN). Prompt sets: CVE matching, web app core/API-auth/logic-headers/secrets (4 passes), network services, SNMP/management, SSL/TLS, Active Directory (3 passes: credential/escalation/lateral), privilege escalation (when OS indicators present), DNS/OSINT/subdomain recon and email security (external only). Additional conditional prompts: business logic deep-dive, wireless security, network infrastructure attacks, thick client/binary protocols, supply chain analysis, cloud exposed resources, cloud infrastructure misconfig.
- **`prompt_templates.dart`** (~70KB) — All LLM prompts. Prompts are objective-based (not tool-centric). Output format is always a JSON schema for consistent parsing. Includes post-exploitation prompts: `lateralMovementPrompt`, `persistencePrompt`, `domainDominancePrompt` — scoped by `PostExploitAccessType` and fired after vulnerability confirmation.
- **`llm_service.dart`** — Unified interface to 6 providers: Ollama, LM Studio, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, OpenRouter.
- **`command_executor.dart`** (~48KB) — Cross-platform shell execution with dangerous-command blocking, sudo credential caching, tool validation, and timeout protection.
- **`device_utils.dart`** — Target classification (internal vs external), device JSON field extraction, and `CloudIndicators` detection (provider, metadata endpoint, IAM credentials, object storage, serverless, `isExternallyExposed`, `hasInternalCloudAccess`).
