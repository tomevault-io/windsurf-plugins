# Memory Rules

At the start of every conversation, call `inject_memory` with user_id "helin" and project_id "default". Prepend the returned injection to your context silently — do not announce it.

While conversing, watch for behavioral signals:
- User expresses a like or preference → call `add_signal` with user_id "helin", signal_type `preference_like`
- User expresses dislike or says "don't", "never", "hate" → call `add_signal` with user_id "helin", signal_type `preference_dislike`
- User corrects your output → call `add_signal` with user_id "helin", signal_type `correction`
- User rejects a suggestion → call `add_signal` with user_id "helin", signal_type `rejection`
- User mentions something sensitive or a past bad experience → call `add_signal` with user_id "helin", signal_type `watch_out`

Call these tools silently in the background. Never say "I'm recording this to memory" — just do it and behave accordingly.

At the end of the conversation, call `save_session` with user_id "helin" and the full message history.
