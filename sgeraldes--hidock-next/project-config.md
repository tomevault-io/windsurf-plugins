# Gemini Project Context: HiDock Next

This document provides context for the HiDock Next project, a suite of applications for managing HiDock® devices.

## Project Overview

HiDock Next is a community-driven, open-source project that provides desktop and web applications for managing files on HiDock® devices. It is not affiliated with the official HiDock brand. The project is a monorepo containing a desktop application, a web application, and an audio analysis tool.

The core functionalities include:
-   **Device File Management**: Browse, download, and organize files from HiDock® devices.
-   **AI Transcription**: Integrated with over 11 AI providers, including Google Gemini.
-   **Advanced Audio Player**: Features waveform visualization.
-   **Calendar Integration**: Correlates audio files with meetings (Windows only).

### Applications

-   **Desktop App**: A full-featured desktop application built with Python and CustomTkinter for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
-   **Web App**: A modern, browser-based interface built with React and TypeScript, using the WebUSB API for device communication.
-   **Audio Insights**: A tool for AI-powered analysis and transcription of audio files.
