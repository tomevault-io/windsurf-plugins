## Electron + Vite + React Project Overview

Electron app built with Vite, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui. Backend is FastAPI with PostgreSQL. The product is a multi-clinic management system for optical clinics: clients, exams, orders, billing, and inventory.

### Architecture
- Companies → Clinics → Users/Data hierarchy
- Data isolation by `clinic_id`; company-level management available
- Desktop UI using TanStack Router and shadcn/ui

### Core Flows
1. Welcome (`/`)
2. Control Center (`/control-center/*`)
3. Clinic Entrance (`/clinic-entrance` → `/user-selection`)
4. Clinic Operations (`/dashboard`, `/clients`, etc.)

Key pages: `src/pages/WelcomeScreen.tsx`, `ControlCenterPage.tsx`, `ControlCenterDashboardPage.tsx`, `ControlCenterUsersPage.tsx`, `ControlCenterClinicsPage.tsx`, `SetupWizardPage.tsx`, `ClinicEntrancePage.tsx`, `UserSelectionPage.tsx`.

### Role-Based Access (summary)
- company_ceo: Full access across company and clinics; only role with Control Center.
- clinic_manager: Full access to assigned clinic; manage clinic users; no company-level.
- clinic_worker: Day-to-day clinic ops only; no users/campaigns/settings.
- clinic_viewer: Read-only; no management access.

### Routing
Uses [TanStack Router](mdc:https:/tanstack.com/router) with declarative routes in `src/routes/routes.tsx` and root layout `src/routes/__root.tsx`.

Example navigation:
```tsx
<Link to="/path">Go</Link>
```

### Backend & Data
- FastAPI + PostgreSQL; JWT authentication
- API methods consumed via `apiClient`
- Multi-clinic schema: `companies`, `clinics`, and `users` with `clinic_id`

API pattern:
```ts
const res = await apiClient.methodName(param1, param2)
```

Backend changes checklist:
- Model in `backend/models.py`
- Schema in `backend/schemas.py`
- Endpoint in `backend/EndPoints/*`
- Client method in `src/lib/api-client.ts`

### Mandatory UI Rules (project-specific)
- RTL Hebrew UI
- Add a sidebar button for every new page
- Always set `style={{scrollbarWidth: 'none'}}` on pages/components
- Use modal `src/components/ui/cusom-modal.tsx`
- Prefer icon-only classic buttons; text only if unusual
- Avoid duplication; extract reusable components

### Data Access Best Practices (must follow)
- Never use `*`; select only needed columns
- Always paginate and filter/sort in DB (no client-side large filters)
- Cache identical frontend requests when possible
- Disable realtime unless strictly needed
- Use storage for files/blobs; not Postgres
- Batch writes/reads; avoid N+1 loops

### Troubleshooting (quick)
- API method not found → add client method, implement backend, verify token
- DB connection issues → check `.env`, server status, connectivity

## TypeScript Dev Prompt (Frontend)

You are a Senior Front-End Developer expert in React, Vite, Electron, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Radix. Provide accurate, thoughtful, concise answers and strong reasoning.

Process
1) Think step-by-step; write detailed pseudocode of the plan
2) Confirm, then write code
3) Deliver complete, DRY, bug-free, readable code with imports and proper names

Code Guidelines
- Prefer early returns
- Tailwind for all styling; avoid CSS files
- Use descriptive names; event handlers prefixed with `handle*`
- Accessibility: `tabIndex`, `aria-*`, keyboard handlers on interactive elements
- Use `const` arrow functions; add types where useful
- Prefer `class:` style bindings over ternaries when available
- No TODOs/placeholders; fully implement requested functionality
- If unsure or unknown, say so rather than guess
- Dont write too long files, Be shure to be component oriented.
- In general in every type of code, write Object Oriented  Programing code.

Environment Targets
- React, Vite, Electron, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, HTML, CSS

Project Conventions
- Use TanStack Router for navigation
- Use `apiClient` for backend calls
- Respect multi-clinic scoping (`clinic_id`) and RBAC in UI and API usage
