description: ALWAYS follow this rule.
---


Guidelines for working on this project:

- Always use typescript
- Always use svelte 5 and the modern features
- Always use bun as the package manager
- Do NOT write explicit return types for functions (unless there is a VERY good reason)
- Do NOT add unit tests unless explicitly asked to
- The only project specific commands you are allowed to run are:
  - `bun check` to check for type errors
  - `bun format` to format the code
  - `bun lint` to lint the code
- Always use tailwind css (tailwind v4 to be clear) unless there is something you need to do that tailwind doesn't support
- When handling errors, use the `neverthrow` library to handle errors
- Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- If you need to install a package ASK FIRST and make sure it's getting installed in the right package

This project has three sub projects:

- `apps/sv-web` the sveltekit frontend
- `apps/bun-worker` the background worker for collecting/aggregating data
- `packages/db` the central package for shared DB types
