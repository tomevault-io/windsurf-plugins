# TEA Test Design

# TEA — Test Design

**Goal.** For **one story**: declare the test split, the fixtures, the mocks, the environments, and the assertion targets. This is Hawkeye's contract Shuri implements against. No story enters dev without one.

Hawkeye drives. Runs at the start of every story (advisory; can be relaxed only when `tea.toml` says so).

## Inputs

- `.wize/solutioning/stories/{epic}/{story}.md`
- `.wize/solutioning/architecture.md`
- `.wize/implementation/tea/risk-profile.md`
- Overlay test playbooks if active:
  - `web-overlay/playbooks/playwright-vitest.md`
  - `app-overlay/playbooks/detox-maestro.md`

## Output

- `.wize/implementation/tea/{epic}/{story}/design.md`

## Steps

### 1. Read the story; map every AC

For each AC, write **one assertion-shape sentence**: *"There will be a {kind} test that does {what} and expects {observable}."*

### 2. Pick the test split

Defaults (from `playwright-vitest.md` / `detox-maestro.md`):
- **Low-risk story:** 70% unit / 20% integration / 10% E2E.
- **Risk-profile flagged story (R-1..R-3):** add 1–2 dedicated E2E + integration for the risk area.
- **UI-only story:** 60% unit / 30% component (Testing Library) / 10% E2E.
- **Server-only story:** 80% unit / 20% integration; no E2E unless an upstream consumer story bundles it.

### 3. Declare fixtures + mocks

- Fixtures: known users, known DB rows, known files.
- Mocks: external services at the network boundary (MSW). Don't mock the unit under test.

### 4. Environment

- Where it runs (local sim, headless emulator, real device farm).
- Network conditions (offline / 3G slow / lossy WiFi).
- OS / browser matrix (from `device-matrix.md` or playwright projects).

### 5. Edge cases (cheap; pay back × 10)

List 3–7 edge cases the ACs don't name but the user might hit:
- Empty / max-length inputs.
- IME / paste / autofill.
- Offline mid-action.
- Concurrent users on the same resource.
- Time-zone / DST.
- Localized number/currency.

Each gets a test of its own (usually unit).

### 6. Hand off

Mark `status: ready-for-dev` in the design.md frontmatter. Shuri reads before starting.

## YAML frontmatter (canonical)

```yaml
---
gate: design
story_id: E01-S03
ac_ids: [AC-02-1, AC-02-2]
status: PASS
created_at: 2026-06-11T12:00:00Z
test_split:
  unit: { count: 4, description: "validation, server-action contract, error mapper, mailer payload" }
  integration: { count: 1, description: "server action calls mailer with right args, against MSW" }
  e2e: { count: 1, description: "happy path; Playwright @chromium @ios" }
fixtures:
  - "new-admin user"
  - "empty team"
mocks:
  - "Resend via MSW"
  - "Auth session via fixture cookie"
environment: "local + Playwright project chromium + ios"
risk_links: [R-1]
edges:
  - "invalid email rules: blank, missing @, weird IME chars"
  - "duplicate teammate email"
  - "offline at submit time"

```

## Body of `design.md`

```markdown
## Per-AC assertion shapes

- **AC-02-1**: Vitest unit on `validateInviteEmail()` → returns `{ ok: true }` for `name+tag@example.com`. Vitest integration on `inviteTeammate()` server action → asserts `mailer.send` called once with `{ to: 'name@example.com', template: 'team-invite' }`. Playwright E2E → clicks "Send invite", asserts `[data-testid="invite-sent-banner"]` appears within 1s.

- **AC-02-2**: Vitest unit on `validateInviteEmail()` → returns `{ ok: false, code: 'invalid_format', field: 'email' }` for empty/no-@. Component test (Testing Library) on `<InviteForm>` → asserts the input's `aria-describedby` error region announces "Enter a valid email."

## Edge cases (additional tests)

- E1: Empty email — `validateInviteEmail('')` → `invalid_format`.
- E2: 254-char local part — boundary check; expect graceful clipping.
- E3: Same email submitted twice — second call hits `inviteTeammate()`, asserts second insert is a no-op (idempotency key based on `(team_id, email)`).
- E4: Offline at submit — Playwright `context.setOffline(true)` after click; banner shows "We'll retry when you're back online."

## Run plan
- On every PR: full unit + integration; E2E `@smoke` tag only (≤ 30s).
- Nightly: full E2E suite + Lighthouse baseline.
```

## Anti-patterns Hawkeye rejects

- **`design.md` written after dev started.** Then the story slipped through; flag.
- **One test per AC, no edges.** Edges are where users live.
- **Mocking the unit under test.** You'd be testing the mock.
- **E2E that test the happy path only.** Cover failure too.
- **Selectors by visible text in a multilingual app.** Use `data-testid` or `role` with locale-aware patterns.

## Hand-off

> Test design for E01-S03 at `.wize/implementation/tea/E01-S03/design.md`. 4 unit, 1 integration, 1 E2E, plus 4 edges. Shuri can start; I'll check `tea-trace.md` against this when the PR opens.
