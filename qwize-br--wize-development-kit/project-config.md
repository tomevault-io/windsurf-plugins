# Create PRD

# Create PRD

**Goal.** Turn brief + research + trigger map into a Product Requirements Document the team can build from. The PRD names *what* and *why* with measurable boundaries. Mantis, Fury, Tony will read it. Shuri ships against the acceptance criteria.

Maria Hill drives. Peggy edits prose. Output lands in `.wize/planning/prd.md`.

## Inputs

- `.wize/planning/brief.md` (vision, audience, success criteria).
- `.wize/planning/research.md` (when present).
- `.wize/planning/ux/trigger-map.md` (every PRD goal references rows of this map).
- `.wize/planning/prfaq.md` (when present — PRD scope mirrors FAQ Q5 "what's in/out").

## Outputs

- `.wize/planning/prd.md`
- `.wize/solutioning/epics/` — coarse epic outlines Tony refines later.

## Steps

### 1. Goals (3–5)

Pull the success criteria from the brief; restate as PRD goals. Each goal is:
- One sentence.
- Measurable (named metric + target + deadline).
- Tied to a trigger-map row.

Example: *"Reduce signup time from 3.5min to 1min by Q3 (signal: `signup_completed` median; row 1)."*

### 2. Scope — in / out (explicit)

| In | Out (for now) |
|---|---|
| First-team signup flow | Multi-team admin roles |
| Self-serve invite | SSO via SAML |
| English (US) | Other locales |

If a stakeholder asked for it and it isn't here, they will ask again at gate review. Put their item in **Out** with a one-line reason, not silence.

### 3. User stories backbone

Coarse stories that map to scope items. "As a {role}, I want to {action}, so that {outcome}." Each story will be sliced finer by Tony in `wize-create-epics-and-stories`.

Use the trigger-map rows as backbone:
- Row 1 (Sign up) → "As a team admin, I want to sign up with my work email, so that I can invite my team within 5 minutes."

### 4. Acceptance criteria per scope item

For every In-scope item, write 3–7 ACs Hawkeye can test.

Format: `Given … When … Then …` or a numbered behavioral list.

ACs are **observable**. ✓ "If the user enters an invalid email, the input shows error text within 200ms." ✗ "The form validates emails correctly."

Each AC gets an ID: `AC-{epic}-{n}`. Hawkeye references these in `tea-trace.md`.

### 5. Constraints + assumptions

Pull constraints from the brief. Add:
- **Assumptions** that, if wrong, change scope.
- **Dependencies** on other teams/services with name + deadline.

Each assumption is one line + verification plan. *"Assumption: Stripe Connect onboarding average 7 days. Verification: confirm with Stripe by 2026-07-01."*

### 6. NFR pointer

Don't redefine NFRs in the PRD. Reference `.wize/planning/nfr-principles.md` (Fury's) once. Note any project-specific tightening.

### 7. Open questions

What still needs deciding before solutioning starts. Each with an owner + deadline. Blockers can't carry into Phase 3.

### 8. Hand off

- Mark `status: ready-for-validation`.
- Run `wize-validate-prd` (Maria Hill + Mantis + Fury sign-off).
- Then Mantis starts `wize-ux-scenarios`.

## Output template

```markdown

status: draft | ready-for-validation | validated

# PRD — {{project_name}}

## Goals
1. {{goal}} (metric: …, target: …, deadline: …, trigger-map row: …)
2. …

## Scope

### In scope
- {{item}} — {{2–3 lines of detail}}

### Out of scope
- {{item}} — {{one-line reason: not now / not us / not yet}}

## Backbone (coarse stories)
- E01: As a {{role}}, I want to {{action}}, so that {{outcome}}.
- E02: …

## Acceptance criteria

### E01 — Sign-up
- **AC-01-1:** Given a new visitor on `/signup`, When they submit a valid work email + password, Then an account is created and they land on `/onboarding` within 1.5s.
- **AC-01-2:** Given an invalid email, When the user blurs the field, Then error text appears within 200ms identifying which rule failed.
- **AC-01-3:** Given a duplicate email, When the user submits, Then they see a "Sign in instead?" CTA and the request returns HTTP 409.
- …

## Constraints
- Deadline: …
- Budget: …
- Compliance: GDPR, LGPD, SOC2.

## Assumptions
- Stripe Connect onboarding ≤ 7 days avg. — verify by …
- Auth0 free tier sufficient for first 6 months. — verify by …

## Dependencies
- Design system tokens from Mantis by {{date}}.
- Database from infra team by {{date}}.

## NFR pointer
See `.wize/planning/nfr-principles.md`. Project tightening: p95 LCP ≤ 2.0s (vs. global 2.5s) on signup pages.

## Open questions
- [ ] (blocker) Pricing tier exposed pre-payment? — *owner: NAME, by: DATE*
- [ ] (important) Brazil-only beta or global launch? — *owner: NAME, by: DATE*
```

## INVEST checklist (per AC group)

Maria Hill validates every story's ACs against INVEST:

- **I**ndependent: no implicit dependency on another story being built first.
- **N**egotiable: details can move; intent can't.
- **V**aluable: a real outcome to a real user.
- **E**stimable: Tony can size it.
- **S**mall: ≤ 1 PR worth (sliced finer in Phase 3 if not).
- **T**estable: every AC is observable.

If any letter fails, fix the story before it leaves Plan.

## Anti-patterns Maria Hill rejects

- **PRD as wishlist.** Pages of "the system shall…" with no Out-of-Scope. Force the cut.
- **ACs as descriptions.** "The form is responsive." → no. *"At 360px, the form fits in the viewport with no horizontal scroll."*
