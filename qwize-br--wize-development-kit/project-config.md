# Create Epics and Stories

# Create Epics and Stories

**Goal.** Slice the PRD + architecture into **epics** (each ships value end-to-end) and **stories** (each is one focused PR-sized unit Shuri can implement and Hawkeye can test).

Tony drives. Output lands in `.wize/solutioning/epics/` and `.wize/solutioning/stories/`.

## Inputs

Read central docs first, then expand by dependency — don't load unrelated files for padding:

- `AGENTS.md` + `.wize/config/project.toml` — active profiles, languages, conventions.
- `.wize/planning/prd.md` — the AC source (never reword ACs downstream).
- `.wize/solutioning/architecture.md`
- `.wize/planning/ux/ux-design/` (every story references one or more screens)
- `.wize/knowledge/document-project/` — brownfield baseline, if present.

## Outputs

- `.wize/solutioning/epics/{NN}-{slug}.md`
- `.wize/solutioning/stories/{epic-NN}/{story-id}.md`

## Epic shape

An epic:
- Ships **value** on its own (a user can do the thing after this epic, even if the next one improves it).
- Lasts 1–3 sprints when in flight.
- Has 3–10 stories.
- Has a single trigger-map row as its anchor.

Epic file:

# Epic 01: Sign-up + first invite

## Outcome
A first-time team admin signs up, lands in onboarding, and invites at least one teammate within 5 minutes (trigger-map row 1 + 2).

## Stories
- E01-S01: Sign-up empty + happy path (AC-01-1, AC-01-2)
- E01-S02: Sign-up error states (AC-01-3, AC-01-4)
- E01-S03: Onboarding step 1 — invite first teammate (AC-02-1, AC-02-2)
- E01-S04: Email delivery + retry (AC-02-3)
- E01-S05: Team list empty + with first member (AC-03-1, AC-03-2)

## Dependencies
- Design tokens by Mantis (S0 — already done)
- Resend account configured (Tony, before S04)

## Success
All ACs of all stories PASS gate. Telemetry shows `teammate_invited` ≥ 80% of `signup_completed` users within 24h in the beta cohort.
```

## Story shape — INVEST

Each story passes:
- **I**ndependent — can be implemented without waiting for another in-flight story.
- **N**egotiable — wording can move; intent stays.
- **V**aluable — a real outcome to a real user (or a clear test path that proves a slice).
- **E**stimable — Tony can size: S/M/L/XL.
- **S**mall — fits in one PR (≤ 1 day for an experienced dev, including tests).
- **T**estable — every AC is observable.

If a story is XL, slice it before merging it to `stories/`.

## Slicing patterns (Tony's defaults)

| Pattern | When |
|---|---|
| Walking skeleton | When you need the full user path to exist (even with stubs) before going deep on any single screen. |
| By user role | Admin vs member often slice naturally. |
| By acceptance criterion | One AC = one PR when ACs are independent. |
| By happy / error path | Ship happy path first; error states next story. |
| By back-end / front-end | Avoid unless the back-end can ship usable without UI; otherwise it bundles. |
| By feature flag | When a story partially ships, use a flag and write the flag retirement story now. |

# Story: Onboarding step 1 — invite first teammate

## Context
Comes right after sign-up. The user lands here with no team yet. The screen is the moment-of-truth from S1: if the user invites a teammate here, the product earned its value moment.

## Sources of truth (Shuri reads before coding)
- `AGENTS.md` + `.wize/config/project.toml` · `.wize/knowledge/document-project/*`.
- `prd.md` (AC source) · `architecture.md` · `ux-design/onboarding-step-1.md` · parent epic `01-onboarding.md`.
- The TEA test contract for this story · related code + tests already on this path.

## Acceptance criteria
- **AC-02-1:** Given a new admin on `/onboarding`, When they enter a valid email and click "Send invite", Then a `teammate_invited` event fires and the screen advances to "Invite sent" within 1s.
- **AC-02-2:** Given an invalid email, When the user blurs the field, Then error text appears (200ms) identifying which rule failed.

## Restrictions
- **Out of scope:** bulk invite → E01-S07; custom invite message → E02-S03.
- **Protected behaviors:** existing sign-up + session flow must not change.
- **Compatibility:** `(team_id, email)` idempotency key — don't break existing invite rows.
- **Security:** validate email at the server boundary; auth context required on `inviteTeammate`.

## Notes for Shuri (Dev)
- Touch points: `app/(onboarding)/invite/page.tsx`, new server action `inviteTeammate`, `lib/email/send-invite.ts`.
- Reuse `Button`, `Input`, `Banner` from design system.
- Add `data-testid="invite-form"`, `"invite-email"`, `"invite-cta"` (Hawkeye depends on these).

## Validation contract
- **AC → test:** AC-02-1 → E2E `invite happy path` + unit `validateInviteEmail`; AC-02-2 → unit `invalid email` + component error-state.
- **Required checks:** the unit/integration/E2E split Hawkeye declares below, plus lint, format, type-check, build. Authz asserted on the server action.
- **States:** loading, empty, error rendered and asserted.
