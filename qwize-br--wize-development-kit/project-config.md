# Create Story

# Create Story

**Goal.** Author one Pull-Request-sized story with crisp acceptance criteria, named touch-points, and a contract for Hawkeye's `tea-design.md`. This is the single most-edited artifact in the lifecycle; make it useful.

Tony drives. Shuri reads and proposes refinements before pulling the story.

## When to use

- New story splits from an epic (most common — done in `wize-create-epics-and-stories`).
- A story that comes in mid-sprint and needs a quick scaffold.
- A `tea-gate` waived rationale created a follow-up story.

## Inputs

Read central docs first, expand by dependency; don't pad with unrelated files:

- `AGENTS.md` + `.wize/config/project.toml` — profiles, languages, conventions.
- `.wize/solutioning/architecture.md`
- `.wize/solutioning/epics/{epic}.md`
- `.wize/planning/prd.md` (the AC list)
- `.wize/knowledge/document-project/` (brownfield baseline, if present)
- (optional) `.wize/planning/ux/ux-design/{screen}.md`

## Output

- `.wize/solutioning/stories/{epic}/{story-id}.md`

## Steps

### 1. Name it by outcome

Verb-led, user-visible. *"Onboarding: invite first teammate"* not *"Build invite form."*

### 2. Frontmatter

```yaml
---
story_id: E01-S03
epic: 01-onboarding
status: ready-for-dev
priority: 2          # 1=now, 2=next, 3=later
estimate: M          # S | M | L  (XL → slice further before merging here)
linked_screens: [onboarding-step-1, invite-modal]
linked_acs: [AC-02-1, AC-02-2]
---
```

### 3. Context (3–5 lines)

What place this story occupies in the user journey, why it matters here, what it depends on.

### 4. ACs (lifted from PRD; not reworded)

Don't reword PRD ACs in a story — copy them verbatim. If they're not crisp enough, fix in the PRD first.

### 5. Out of scope

Explicit. Other ACs the user might think this story touches, with a one-line reason it's not here.

### 6. Sources of truth

List the exact docs Shuri must read before coding: `AGENTS.md`, `project.toml`, `document-project/*`, the parent epic, `architecture.md`, the linked screen, the TEA test contract, and the related code + tests already on this path.

### 7. Restrictions

Beyond out-of-scope: name **protected behaviors** (what must not change), **compatibility** constraints (keys, contracts, migrations), and **security** constraints (boundary validation, authz). No silent scope creep — log recommended extras separately.

### 8. Validation contract

Declare the **AC → test** map and the **required checks** (unit / integration / e2e, lint, format, type-check, build, security when applicable) plus which UI states (loading / empty / error) must be asserted. Hawkeye writes the real `tea-design.md`, but this is the binding shape it fills.

### 9. Notes for Shuri

- Touch points: files Shuri will likely edit.
- Reuse: components from `design-system` already named.
- `testid` map: names Hawkeye expects.
- Edge cases worth flagging (only ones not derivable from ACs).

### 10. Notes for Hawkeye

A one-paragraph hint: suggested split, fixtures, mocks, environment. Hawkeye writes the real `tea-design.md` but reads this hint.

## INVEST rules

Every story passes:

- **I**ndependent.
- **N**egotiable.
- **V**aluable.
- **E**stimable (Tony sizes).
- **S**mall (≤ 1 PR).
- **T**estable.

If any letter fails, fix before queueing.

## Estimation rough guide

- **S** ≤ 4h.
- **M** 4h–1d.
- **L** 1–2d.
- **XL** > 2d → split.

These are intervals, not commitments. Hill plans capacity against M-median.

# Story: Onboarding step 1 — invite first teammate

## Context
After sign-up the admin lands on `/onboarding`. This story implements the first
moment-of-truth from scenario S1: inviting the first teammate.

## Sources of truth (Shuri reads before coding)
- `AGENTS.md` + `.wize/config/project.toml` · `.wize/knowledge/document-project/*`.
- `prd.md` (AC source) · `architecture.md` · `ux-design/onboarding-step-1.md` · parent epic `01-onboarding.md`.
- The TEA test contract for this story · related code + tests already on this path.

## Acceptance criteria
- **AC-02-1:** Given a new admin on `/onboarding`, When they enter a valid email and click "Send invite", Then a `teammate_invited` event fires and the screen advances to "Invite sent" within 1s.
- **AC-02-2:** Given an invalid email, When the user blurs the field, Then error text appears (200ms) identifying which rule failed.

## Restrictions
- **Out of scope:** bulk invite (multiple emails) → E01-S07; custom invite message → E02-S03; "Skip for now" button — not a moment-of-truth path; out.
- **Protected behaviors:** existing sign-up + session flow must not change.
- **Compatibility:** `(team_id, email)` composite idempotency key — don't break existing invite rows.
- **Security:** validate email at the server boundary; auth context required on `inviteTeammate`.

## Notes for Shuri (Dev)
- Touch points: `app/(onboarding)/invite/page.tsx`, `lib/email/send-invite.ts`, new server action `inviteTeammate`.
- Reuse: `Button` (primary), `Input`, `Banner` (success/error) from design-system.
- testid: `invite-form`, `invite-email`, `invite-cta`, `invite-sent-banner`.
