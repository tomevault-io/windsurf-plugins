# Domain Research

# Domain Research

**Goal.** Conduct domain and industry research to ground the product in its business, regulatory, and technical context.

Pepper Potts drives. Peggy Carter edits prose. Output lands in `.wize/planning/research/domain-{slug}-research-{date}.md`.

## When to use

- "I need domain research on..."
- "What are the regulations in this industry?"
- "What are the technical trends in this sector?"

## Inputs

- Open questions from `.wize/planning/brief.md`
- User-provided domain or industry
- Web search access

## Outputs

- `.wize/planning/research/domain-{slug}-research-{date}.md`

## Workflow architecture

Step-file architecture with six steps:

1. Scope confirmation
2. Domain analysis
3. Competitive landscape
4. Regulatory focus
5. Technical trends
6. Research synthesis

## On activation

1. Load `.wize/config/project.toml` and `.wize/config/user.toml`.
2. Ask for the domain/industry topic if not provided.
3. Derive `{research_topic_slug}` and create the output file from `research.template.md`.
4. Read fully and follow `./domain-steps/step-01-init.md`.

## Hand-off

> Domain research is in `.wize/planning/research/`. Hill can use it for PRD constraints; open questions route back to Wizer.
