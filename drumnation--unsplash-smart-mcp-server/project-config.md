# Rule: Automatic Git Commit Rules

Purpose:
Automatically commit staged changes at logical points in development using conventional commits and metadata logging.

Trigger Conditions:
- A feature, function, test, or refactor is logically complete
- Total changed lines exceed 300 (across all files)
- More than 8 files are staged
- A stable group of files is complete (e.g. component + styles + test)
- A previously failing test now passes due to these changes
- A `.rules`, `README.md`, or config file has been modified

Commit Message Structure:
1. `commitSubject` (max 50 chars, required): One-line summary using Conventional Commit format (e.g., `feat: add login screen`)
2. `commitBody` (optional): Wrap lines to ~72 chars, summarize key changes, bullet major additions if needed.
3. `commitFooter` (optional): For breaking changes or issue refs (e.g., `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `Closes #123`)

Commit Process:
1. Analyze `git diff` or fallback to `git status` + file list
2. Generate structured commit message: `Subject`, `Body`, `Footer`
3. Stage all changes explicitly: `git add -- ${changedFilesList.join(' ')}`
4. Commit using:
   ```bash
   echo "${fullMessage}" | git commit -F -
   ```

Metadata Logging:
- After successful commit, retrieve the hash:
  ```bash
  git rev-parse HEAD
  ```
- Create a metadata JSON file at `.brain/git/commits/[xx]/[hash].json` with:
  ```json
  {
    "hash": "<commit hash>",
    "messageSubject": "<subject>",
    "messageBody": "<body>",
    "messageFooter": "<footer>",
    "files": [<file list>],
    "timestamp": "<UTC timestamp>",
    "branch": "<branch name>"
  }
  ```
- Create parent directories with `mkdir -p` as needed.

Commit Policy Notes:
- Skip automatic commit if:
  - Files contain WIP, TODO, or FIXME comments
  - Code is not in a logically complete state
- Prefer small, atomic commits
- Avoid committing unrelated changes together

Final Output:
- Return only:
  ```json
  {
    "commitHash": "<commit hash>",
    "metadataPath": "<path to metadata file>"
  }
  ```
```
