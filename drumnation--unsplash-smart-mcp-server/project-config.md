# Rule: Auto-generate and maintain ONBOARDING.md

Purpose:
Provide new developers with an always up-to-date guide to set up their environment and get running fast.

When to run:

- When onboarding steps change (e.g., new .env vars, setup commands)
- When any new app or package is added that needs manual linking or config

Include:
- Prerequisites (OS, tools, package managers)
- Environment setup (.env, keys, accounts)
- How to run each app (with pnpm Nx or standalone)
- Required accounts/services (e.g., Supabase, Vercel)

Format:
Step-by-step markdown format with command snippets.
