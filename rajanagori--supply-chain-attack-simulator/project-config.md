description: Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring code to avoid overcomplication, make surgical changes, surface assumptions, define verifiable success criteria, and explore the codebase with minimal context while matching existing patterns.

# Karpathy behavioral guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Pattern-Aware Exploration

**Orient cheaply. Learn the pattern once. Verify only what you will change.**

At the start of a task (new session or new scope), build a mental model before reading large files or broad directories:

1. **Infer structure first** — Use paths, naming, README, and folder layout to guess where logic lives. Read `.cursor/rules/scenario-patterns.mdc` for the repo map; treat one representative example as canonical unless the task says otherwise.
2. **Search before read** — Prefer targeted `grep`/`glob` and semantic search for symbols and filenames. Read narrow slices (signatures, call sites, the function you will edit), not whole files or trees.
3. **Stop when the pattern is clear** — Once you see how similar work is done (e.g. mock servers, capture shipping, scenario docs), reuse that shape. Do not re-read every duplicate to "be thorough."
4. **Match nature of the project** — Educational labs with localhost-only malicious samples: preserve safety gates (`TESTBENCH_MODE`, isolated mocks), keep scenario parity when changing shared patterns, and treat `documentation/` as learner-facing copy that must stay accurate to runtime behavior. Doc maintenance scripts and lifecycle: `documentation/platform/TOOLING.md`.
5. **Minimum context, verified accuracy** — Spend tokens on files you will edit or that define the contract you must honor. Confirm behavior with a quick read of call sites or one sibling scenario, not a full-repo tour. Hub navigation starts at `documentation/index.md`, not `documentation/README.md`.

Ask yourself: "Do I know the pattern and the exact files I need?" If yes, implement. If no, one more targeted lookup — not another broad pass.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes, and exploration stays narrow while results still match how this project is actually built.
