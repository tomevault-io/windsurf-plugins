# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Sabela** is a reactive notebook environment for Haskell — a web-based IDE where users write executable Haskell code mixed with Markdown prose. Notebooks are stored as plain Markdown files. The name means "to respond" in Ndebele, reflecting its reactive execution model.

## Commands

```bash
# Build and run
cabal run                                  # Starts server on localhost:3000
cabal run sabela -- 3000 static .          # Custom port, static-dir, work-dir

# Tests
cabal test                                 # Runs HSpec test suite

# Lint and format
./scripts/lint.sh                          # HLint on src/, app/, test/
./scripts/lint.sh --fix                    # Auto-fix lint issues on edited files
./scripts/format.sh                        # Format with fourmolu
```

## Architecture

The system has three layers: a Haskell backend (Servant/Warp), a static frontend (`static/index.html`), and a long-lived GHCi subprocess.

### Module Responsibilities

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `Sabela.Model` | Core domain types: `Notebook`, `Cell`, `NotebookEvent`, `CellError` |
| `Sabela.State` | Composed `App` record with focused subsystems (`Environment`, `EventBus`, `NotebookStore`, `SessionManager`, `DependencyTracker`, `WidgetStore`, `BridgeStore`) |
| `Sabela.Session` | Spawns and manages a GHCi subprocess; uses marker-based output capture to separate cell results |
| `Sabela.LeanSession` | Lean 4 LSP client session management |
| `Sabela.PythonSession` | Python REPL subprocess management |
| `Sabela.SessionTypes` | `SessionBackend` record-of-functions interface shared by all language backends |
| `Sabela.Handlers` | Cell execution, reactivity engine, dependency tracking, session lifecycle |
| `Sabela.Reactivity` | Pure execution planning: `ExecutionPlan`, topological ordering, error message generation |
| `Sabela.Deps` | Pure metadata collection and merging for cabal dependencies |
| `Sabela.Bridge` | Pure preamble generation for cross-language bridge values and widgets |
| `Sabela.Topo` | Dependency graph construction and topological sort |
| `Sabela.Server` | Servant HTTP API, SSE event streaming, file explorer, IDE helpers |
| `Sabela.Api` | Request/response DTOs |
| `Sabela.Output` | MIME type parsing, rich output helpers (HTML, SVG, Markdown, LaTeX, JSON) |
| `Sabela.Errors` | Parses GHCi stderr to extract structured error locations |
| `Sabela.LeanLsp` | LSP wire protocol types and helpers for Lean integration |

### Key Data Flow

1. User edits a cell → `PUT /api/cell/{id}`
2. `handleCellEdit` bumps generation, runs `selectAffected` to find downstream cells
3. If package dependencies changed, `installAndRestart` resolves packages via `scripths`, restarts GHCi
4. For each affected cell: parse source → render to GHCi script → `runBlock` → parse output/errors → broadcast `EvCellResult` via SSE
5. Frontend receives events on `/api/events` (SSE) and updates the UI

### Reactivity Model

Dependency tracking is heuristic (textual, not compiler-based):
- `extractDefs`: parses `let`, `data`, `type`, `newtype`, `class`, and value bindings from a cell
- `extractTokens`: identifies all identifiers used in a cell
- `selectAffected`: builds a dependency DAG and finds cells transitively downstream of the edited cell

### Session Management

- Single long-lived GHCi process per notebook
- Output captured by a background thread using `TBQueue`; cells separated by unique `SABELA_MARKER_N` sentinels
- `withMVar` locks ensure only one cell runs at a time
- `displayPrelude` is injected at session start to enable rich MIME output

### Concurrency Primitives

- `MVar`: mutable state (notebook, session)
- `IORef`: counters, sets (installed deps/extensions)
- `TBQueue`: bounded queues for session output lines
- `TChan`: broadcast channel for SSE events (duplicated per client)
- `forkIO`: background tasks (dependency installation, cell execution)

### Dependency Resolution

Cells declare package metadata with `-- cabal:` comments. The `scripths` library merges metadata across all cells, then `cabal install --lib` creates a package environment in a temp directory. GHCi is invoked with `--package-env=<path>`.

### File Format

Notebooks are plain Markdown files. Code blocks become executable cells; prose between them becomes Markdown cells. On save, cells are reassembled back into Markdown.

## Key External Dependency

`scripths` (version `>= 0.2.0.1`) handles: markdown parsing, package/dependency resolution, and GHCi script rendering. Most cell execution logic in `Handlers.hs` delegates to it.

## Conventions

- Module namespace: `Sabela.*`
- HTTP handler functions use `H` suffix (e.g., `runCellH`, `getNotebookH`)
- State parameters named `app` (App) or `rn` (ReactiveNotebook)
- All file paths are canonicalized and security-checked to be within the work directory
- Formatter: fourmolu with 4-space indent, 80-column limit, leading commas (see `fourmolu.yaml`)
