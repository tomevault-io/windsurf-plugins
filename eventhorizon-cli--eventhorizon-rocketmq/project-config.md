# AGENTS.md

You are an AI coding assistant for this repository.

## Scope and working style

- These instructions apply repository-wide unless a more specific `AGENTS.md` exists below the target path.
- Follow [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) and nearby code before introducing a new style or abstraction.
- Keep changes focused, maintainable, and production-ready. Preserve unrelated user changes.
- Use the SDK selected by [`global.json`](global.json); do not change the SDK or target-framework policy incidentally.

## References

Use the following as the source of truth for detailed, evolving guidance instead of duplicating it here:

- [Design-note index](docs/README.md): bilingual architecture, protocol, instrumentation, and testing articles.
- [Protocol boundaries and type ownership](docs/en-US/architecture/protocol-boundaries.md): production-project split,
  duplicated models, public API ownership, and folder placement.
- [Dependency-injection registrations and lifetimes](docs/en-US/architecture/dependency-injection-and-lifetimes.md):
  role composition, keyed registrations, consumer engines, handlers, and hosted lifecycles.
- [gRPC consumer model](docs/en-US/grpc/consumer-model.md) and
  [classic Remoting transport and roles](docs/en-US/remoting/transport-and-client-roles.md): transport semantics.
- [Local and integration testing](docs/en-US/testing/local-and-integration-testing.md): test projects, Testcontainers,
  CI, coverage, and Compose boundaries.
- [Protocol guides](src/EventHorizon.RocketMQ.Grpc/README.md) and
  [classic Remoting guide](src/EventHorizon.RocketMQ.Remoting/README.md): public APIs, configuration, compatibility,
  and examples.
- [Samples index](samples/README.md) and [test-environment index](test-environments/README.md): runnable local
  setups and their prerequisites.

Read the relevant reference before changing an architectural boundary, transport behavior, DI lifecycle, test
topology, or manual environment.

## Architecture constraints

- Production contains exactly two independent client projects: `EventHorizon.RocketMQ.Grpc` for RocketMQ 5 Proxy/gRPC
  and `EventHorizon.RocketMQ.Remoting` for classic NameServer/Broker Remoting. Do not add a shared production project,
  transport-neutral root client, cross-protocol `ProjectReference`, common builder, or transport selector.
- Public APIs, options, models, results, exceptions, and DI registrations remain protocol-specific. Do not introduce
  transport-independent Producer, Consumer, Push, Pull, Simple, queue, result, status, or options abstractions.
- Matching foundational models are separate CLR types in each protocol project. Review the counterpart when changing
  one, but apply the change only when its semantics remain valid for both protocols.
- Keep reusable transport infrastructure under that protocol's `Protocol` folder. Feature scheduling, retries,
  transactions, headers, decoders, and lifecycle helpers stay beside their owning Producer or Consumer feature. Do not
  introduce generic `Common`, `Internal`, or `DependencyInjection` folders.
- Register gRPC through `AddRocketMQGrpc` and Remoting through `AddRocketMQRemoting`. Consumer engines are constructed
  at their protocol composition root, injected through the protocol-specific internal engine interface, and owned by
  the registered role; they are not global services.
- Namespaces mirror their owning project and source directory. Keep one top-level type per C# file, except for nested
  implementation details and test helpers.

## Transport constraints

- gRPC connects through a Proxy `Endpoint`; Remoting discovers Brokers through `NamesrvAddr`. gRPC Push and LitePush
  use client-initiated assignment queries and long polling, not protocol-level Broker push. Remoting Push also long
  polls but has classic compatibility and callback behavior, so do not assume the transports have identical features.
- Remoting uses the built-in `System.IO.Pipelines` transport. Do not reintroduce Bedrock Framework.
- Change checked-in `.proto` files for wire-contract changes; never edit generated files under `bin` or `obj`.

## Documentation

- Update documentation when behavior, configuration, public APIs, commands, architecture, setup, or user-facing
  functionality changes.
- Keep English and Simplified Chinese README or design-note pairs semantically synchronized. The root READMEs stay
  concise; protocol detail belongs in the protocol guides and design notes.
- Update the matching design note when an architectural, DI-lifecycle, transport, or testing decision changes. Update
  the relevant test-environment guide when a Compose environment changes.
- Do not change documentation for an internal refactor with no user-visible or architectural effect. State any
  documentation that could not be updated and why.

## C# and dependencies

- Target the frameworks declared by the project files and use only C# 12 language features. Keep nullable annotations,
  cancellation propagation, and `ConfigureAwait(false)` usage correct and consistent with nearby library code.
- Every C# file must use the Apache header from `.editorconfig`; keep configured analyzer diagnostics clean.
- Prefer concise modern C# when it clarifies the code. Use primary constructors for straightforward dependency or state
