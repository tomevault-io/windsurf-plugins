# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

Son of Simon is an LLM-powered macOS automation assistant that integrates with built-in Apple apps (Mail, Calendar, Reminders, Notes, Safari) through natural language. It consists of:

- **Python CLI/Service** (`src/macbot/`) — Agent loop, task system, cron scheduler, Telegram bot
- **Tauri Desktop App** (`app/`) — Svelte/TypeScript frontend with Rust backend for onboarding UI
- **macOS Automation Scripts** (`macos-automation/`) — AppleScript bridges to Apple apps

## Common Commands

```bash
# Python development
pip install -e ".[dev]"          # Install with dev dependencies
pytest                           # Run all tests
pytest tests/test_task.py        # Run specific test file
pytest -k "test_name"            # Run tests matching pattern
ruff check src/                  # Lint
mypy src/                        # Type check

# CLI usage
son run "<goal>"                 # Execute natural language goal
son chat                         # Interactive mode
son start                        # Start background service
son doctor                       # Check setup/permissions

# Tauri app (from app/ directory)
npm install                      # Install frontend deps
npm run dev                      # Dev server with hot reload
npm run tauri build              # Build complete app

# Build scripts
./scripts/build-sidecar.sh       # Build PyInstaller binary
./scripts/build-app.sh           # Full build (sidecar + Tauri)
./scripts/release.sh patch       # Bump version, tag, push
```

## Architecture

### Agent Loop (`src/macbot/core/agent.py`)
ReAct-style loop: LLM reasons → calls tools → observes results → repeats. The agent maintains conversation history and tracks token usage.

### Task System (`src/macbot/tasks/`)
- `Task` base class with `name`, `description`, `execute()` method
- Tool schemas auto-generated from type hints
- `TaskRegistry` holds all available tasks
- Tasks return `TaskResult` with success/output/error

### LLM Providers (`src/macbot/providers/`)
- `LLMProvider` abstract base with `create_message()`
- Implementations: `LiteLLMProvider` (100+ models), `AnthropicProvider`, `OpenAIProvider`
- Provider selected via `MACBOT_LLM_PROVIDER` env var

### Configuration (`src/macbot/config.py`)
Pydantic settings loaded from `~/.macbot/.env` with `MACBOT_` prefix. Key settings:
- `MACBOT_LLM_PROVIDER` — `anthropic`, `openai`, or any LiteLLM provider
- `MACBOT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `MACBOT_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `MACBOT_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `MACBOT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`

### Skills System (`src/macbot/skills/`)
Skills provide declarative guidance that improves agent reliability through examples, safe defaults, and behavior rules.

**Key distinction:**
- **Tools** = Batteries-included macOS automation (Mail, Calendar, Reminders, Notes, Safari tasks)
- **Skills** = Declarative guidance that improves reliability by providing examples, safe defaults, and behavior rules

**Directories:**
- `skills/` — Built-in skills (shipped with app)
- `~/.macbot/skills/` — User skills (override built-in by id)
- `~/.macbot/skills.json` — Enable/disable state persistence

**SKILL.md Format:** YAML frontmatter with fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `apps`, `tasks`, `examples`, `safe_defaults`, `confirm_before_write`, `requires_permissions`. Markdown body for detailed behavior notes.

### Service Architecture
`MacbotService` runs cron scheduler + Telegram bot together. Uses PID file at `~/.macbot/service.pid`. Maintains separate agent instances per Telegram chat.

### Tauri Integration
Python sidecar binary (PyInstaller) bundled at `Contents/MacOS/son`. Tauri spawns it via shell plugin. Config in `app/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`.

### Spotlight Search (`macos-automation/spotlight/`)
`spotlight_search` task wraps `mdfind` for fast indexed file/document search. Supports searching by name, content, type, modification date, and last-used date (`kMDItemLastUsedDate`).

**Important constraints:**
- **Mail.app is NOT searchable via mdfind.** Mail uses Core Spotlight, a private index inaccessible to `mdfind` or any external tool. Always use the AppleScript-based `search_emails` for Mail.app.
- `mdfind` does not support `!=` operator — use post-processing (grep -v) to exclude results.
- macOS BSD `awk` does not support 3-argument `match()` — use `$1` for field extraction instead.
- `.eml` files on disk have content type `com.apple.mail.email` (not `.emlx`).

### AppleScript Mail Performance
- **Always use `whose` clause** for message lookups: `messages of mb whose message id is targetId` is near-instant.
- **Never iterate all messages** checking properties one by one — each Apple Event takes ~0.1-0.5s, causing timeouts on large mailboxes.
- When searching by message_id, the `download-attachments.sh` and `search-emails.sh` scripts both use the fast `whose` pattern.
- Default mailbox search should include inbox + Archive (not just inbox).

### Mail SQLite Search
- `search_emails` uses a **two-tier strategy**: SQLite for metadata, AppleScript for content.
- SQLite queries the Envelope Index at `~/Library/Mail/V*/MailData/Envelope Index` (read-only, immutable mode).
