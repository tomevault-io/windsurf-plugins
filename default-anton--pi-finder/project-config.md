description: - Keep this package dependency-light. Do not add runtime dependencies unless strictly necessary.
---

## Invariants

- Keep this package dependency-light. Do not add runtime dependencies unless strictly necessary.
- `extensions/index.ts` is the only extension entrypoint; keep orchestration there.
- Model routing policy lives locally in `extensions/model-selection.ts`; keep behavior deterministic and dependency-light.
- Selection diagnostics contract lives in `extensions/finder-core.ts` (`subagentSelection`). Keep it tight: `reason`.

## Required validation

Run after changing code (not docs-only):

```bash
npm run pack:check
```

## Policy changes

When changing model-selection behavior:

1. Update README section `Model selection policy`.
2. Keep fallback behavior explicit and deterministic.

## Changelog

- Any change that modifies behavior must include a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under **[Unreleased]** in the same change.

## Release process

For commit/push/tag/GitHub release/npm publish workflow, follow `docs/release-playbook.md`.
