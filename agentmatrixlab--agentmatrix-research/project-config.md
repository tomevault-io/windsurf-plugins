# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Repository Entry

## What this repository is

AgentMatrix Research is a modular quantitative research project for A-share
alpha discovery. Code is split by role: pure data contracts in `contracts/`,
executable research code in `research_core/`, a legacy transition layer in
`backend/` + `scripts/`, and supporting docs in `docs/`. Everything must be
run from the repository root (the directory containing `research_core/`).

## Core directory map

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `research_core/factor_lab/` | Factor discovery, validation and truth-proof runs (Alpha101, GTJA191, Alpha158, Barra, WQ101) |
| `research_core/strategy_engine/` | Build target-weight / alpha-strategy packages from validated factor runs |
| `research_core/backtest_adapter/` | Package signals for external simulation engines (掘金 / PTrade / QMT) and parse their results |
| `research_core/qlib_lab/` | Qlib-based factor mining, Alpha158 workflow, backtesting and intern starter packs |
| `contracts/` | Typed dataclass contracts shared across modules: `factor.py`, `strategy.py`, `backtest.py`, `attribution.py`, `factor_research.py` |
| `docs/` | Detailed workflow and architecture docs (see "Further reading" below) |
| `backend/`, `scripts/` | Legacy transition layers. New work should target `research_core/` and `contracts/` only. |

## Existing CLI entry points

The following CLI entry points already exist in the repository. Read each
source file or run with `--help` for the exact parameters and subcommands.
This guide does not replicate the full CLI surface.
On Windows, prefer the `-X utf8` flag to avoid GBK mojibake when the help
text contains emoji or non-ASCII characters.

```bash
# Factor Lab — list factor sets, run research jobs, validate truth proof CSVs
python -X utf8 -m research_core.factor_lab.cli --help

# Strategy Engine — build target weights from a validated factor run
python -X utf8 -m research_core.strategy_engine.cli --help

# Backtest Adapter — package signals for GM / PTrade / QMT, then parse results
python -X utf8 -m research_core.backtest_adapter.cli --help

# Qlib Lab — Qlib factor mining, Alpha158 workflow, backtesting
python -X utf8 -m research_core.qlib_lab.cli --help
```

### Automated factor mining

```bash
# Closed-loop mining: candidates → compile → real IC evaluation → dedup → CSV
python -X utf8 -m research_core.factor_lab.cli auto-mine --source auto --mode gp

# Modes: gp (genetic programming search) | llm | builtin | auto (llm→builtin)
# Panel sources: auto (cache→API→synthetic) | cache | api | parquet | synthetic
```

External agents (openclaw / hermes / codex / cloudecode / Trae / WorkBuddy,
anything that speaks HTTP) can call the synchronous Agent Gateway instead of
shelling out:

```bash
# Start from the repository root
PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn research_core.factor_lab.agent_gateway:app --port 8710

# Submit candidate expressions and get IC / ICIR / dedup verdicts in one call
curl -X POST localhost:8710/mine/evaluate -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"expressions": [{"name": "mom_20", "expression": "Ref($close, 20) / $close - 1"}]}'

# Other endpoints: GET /health, GET /mine/panel,
# POST /mine/feedback (structured text for next LLM round), POST /mine/loop
```

Expressions use Qlib-style syntax (`Ref/Mean/Std/Corr/Log` on
`$open/$high/$low/$close/$volume`); they are bridged to the GTJA191 compiler
internally. When the panel falls back to synthetic data (no API token and no
cache), responses carry `synthetic_warning` — treat IC numbers as pipeline
self-check only.

## Prerequisites and environment

- Python 3.10+ (64-bit recommended; 32-bit Windows cannot load some
  optional numerical dependencies such as `scipy`).
- Install dependencies per your concrete workflow:
  - Research-wide basics: `pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`
  - Factor Lab additional deps: `pip install -r requirements-factor-lab.txt`
  - Strategy dashboard: `pip install -r deploy/strategy-dashboard/requirements.txt`
  - Other workflows may declare their own requirements; see the README or
    `pyproject.toml` in the corresponding subdirectory.
- `research_core/` and `contracts/` assume the working directory is the
  repository root. Do not `cd` into a subdirectory and run a CLI from there.
- Research runs write outputs under `runtime/`; never commit that directory.
- Qlib needs its own data directory; follow `docs/ALPHA158_STARTER.md` if you
  need it. The project does not ship market data.

## Skills packaged with this repository

For longer-running, opinionated research flows, prefer the bundled Skill
definitions. Each one documents its own commands, inputs and outputs:

- `.trae/skills/agentmatrix-alpha-pipeline/SKILL.md`
- `.trae/skills/alpha101-factor-research/SKILL.md`
- `.trae/skills/factor-research-proof-pipeline/SKILL.md`
- `.trae/skills/feeder/SKILL.md`
- `.trae/skills/quant-api-v2/SKILL.md`
