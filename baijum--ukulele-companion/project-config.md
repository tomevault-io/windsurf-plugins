# Compose UI Rules

## Compose-only UI

No XML layouts. All UI is built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 components.

## Material 3

Use Material 3 components and theming (`MaterialTheme.colorScheme`, `MaterialTheme.typography`). Do not use Material 2 (`androidx.compose.material`) — use `androidx.compose.material3`.

## Minimize recompositions

- Use `remember` to avoid recomputing values on every recomposition
- Use `derivedStateOf` when a value is derived from one or more state objects
- Use `key` to help Compose identify items in lists and avoid unnecessary recomposition

```kotlin
val sortedItems = remember(items) { items.sortedBy { it.name } }

val isValid by remember {
    derivedStateOf { name.isNotBlank() && age > 0 }
}
```

## Immutable data

Prefer immutable data (`val`, `data class`, `List` over `MutableList` in public APIs). This helps Compose's stability system skip unnecessary recompositions.

## Code style

- Files: PascalCase (`ChordDetector.kt`)
- Functions: camelCase
- Classes/Objects/Enums: PascalCase
- Use Kotlin idioms (`let`, `apply`, `also`, `when`) where they improve readability

## Navigation

The app uses `ModalNavigationDrawer` with ~30 sections grouped into Play, Create, Learn, and Reference. Screen selection is managed via `mutableIntStateOf` with a `when` block — there is no Compose NavHost or NavController.

## Theming

Verify UI changes in light, dark, and high-contrast themes. Theme configuration lives in `ui/theme/Theme.kt`.
