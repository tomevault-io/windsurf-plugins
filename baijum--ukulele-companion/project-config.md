# SwiftUI Accessibility Rules

A core user base relies on VoiceOver. **Every UI change must preserve and improve accessibility.** Breaking accessibility is treated as seriously as breaking functionality.

## Required modifiers

- Use `.accessibilityLabel()` on interactive elements and images
- Use `.accessibilityHint()` for non-obvious interactions
- Mark section titles with `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)`
- Use `.accessibilityValue()` for dynamic state (sliders, pickers)
- Custom drawn views need `.accessibilityRepresentation` or `.accessibilityElement(children:)`

## Never remove existing accessibility modifiers

Do not remove `.accessibilityLabel()`, `.accessibilityHint()`, `.accessibilityAddTraits()`, or `.accessibilityValue()` during refactoring. If restructuring a view, preserve all accessibility modifiers in the new structure.

## Label style

- Sentence case: `"Play all inversions"`, not `"Play All Inversions"`
- Action-oriented: `"Open settings"`, `"Delete note"`
- Conditional for toggles: `isPlaying ? "Stop" : "Play"`

## Helper utilities

`AccessibilityHelper` in `iosApp/UkuleleCompanion/Helpers/` provides VoiceOver announcement support. Use it for dynamic announcements that cannot be expressed with static modifiers.
