# Plan Files

## Location & Naming

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Plans | `.cursor/plans/{name}.plan.md` |
| Reports | `.cursor/plans/{name}-report.md` or project root `{AGENT}_REPORT.md` |

### Path Rules (CRITICAL)

**Correct paths** (relative to workspace root):
- `.cursor/plans/feature.plan.md`
- `.cursor/plans/multi-agent.plan.md`

**NEVER use these locations:**
- `~/.cursor/plans/` or `C:\Users\{user}\.cursor\plans\` (user home)
- `~/.cursor/projects/` (Cursor's internal folder)
- Any absolute path outside the repository

### Other Rules
- Multi-agent work: **ONE plan file** (`{feature}-agents.plan.md`), not separate files per agent

---

## Multi-Agent Plan Structure

All agents for a feature belong in a single plan file. This keeps coordination, boundaries, and handoffs visible in one place.

```markdown
# {Feature} Multi-Agent Plan

## Objective
What the combined work achieves.

## Agent Overview
| Agent | Responsibility | Owns | Dependencies |
|-------|---------------|------|--------------|
| Agent 1 | Core foundation | src/lib/core/* | None |
| Agent 2 | UI components | src/features/x/* | None |
| Agent 3 | Integration | src/lib/api/* | Agent 1 |

## Shared Files
| File | Owner | Rule |
|------|-------|------|
| src/types/index.ts | Agent 3 | Others append to their section |
| src/stores/index.ts | Agent 1 | Agent 2 requests additions |

---

## Agent 1: {Name}

### Prompt
> {Copy-paste ready prompt — see template below}

### Boundary
- **OWNS (exclusive write):** `src/lib/core/*`, `src/types/core.ts`
- **READS (no modify):** `src/types/index.ts`

### Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

### Deliverables
What this agent produces for others to consume.

---

## Agent 2: {Name}
... (same structure for each agent)
```

---

## Agent Boundaries

Clear boundaries prevent agents from stepping on each other's work.

### Ownership Rules

1. **Exclusive ownership** — Each agent OWNS specific files/directories and has sole write access
2. **Read-only access** — Agents can read other agents' files but must not modify them
3. **Shared files** — Designate one owner; others either append to designated sections or request the owner to make changes

### Handling Conflicts

If an agent MUST touch another agent's file:

- Document why in the plan before starting
- Coordinate timing — wait until the owner completes their work
- Limit changes to specific lines or functions, not broad edits

---

## Code Quality Expectations

All agent prompts should emphasize **enterprise-level code quality and organization**:

- Clean, readable, well-documented code
- Proper error handling and edge cases
- Consistent naming conventions and file organization
- Type safety — no `any` types, proper interfaces
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- No shortcuts or "quick fixes" that create tech debt

Include this expectation in every agent prompt.

---

## Agent Prompt Template

Each agent's prompt must be **copy-paste ready** with clear scope, boundaries, and deliverables:

```markdown
### Prompt
> Implement {feature} for BluePLM with enterprise-level code quality.
>
> **Scope:**
> - Create `src/features/x/` with components A, B, C
> - Add slice to `src/stores/slices/xSlice.ts`
> - Follow existing patterns and conventions
>
> **Boundaries:**
> - OWNS: `src/features/x/*`, `src/stores/slices/xSlice.ts`
> - Do NOT modify: `src/stores/pdmStore.ts`, `src/types/`
>
> **Quality Requirements:**
> - Enterprise-level code quality and organization
> - Proper TypeScript types (no `any`)
> - Error handling and edge cases covered
> - Clean, readable, documented code
>
> **Deliverables:**
> - Working feature with exports from index.ts
> - Report in `X_AGENT_REPORT.md`
>
> **When complete:** Run `npm run typecheck` and report results.
```

---

## Report Structure

Each agent should submit a completion report:

```markdown
# {Agent Name} Report

## Summary
Brief description of what was accomplished.

## Changes Made
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/lib/x.ts` | Added function Y |
| `src/features/x/index.ts` | Created with exports |

## Verification
- [ ] Typecheck passes (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Manual verification completed

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] No `any` types introduced
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] Follows existing code patterns

## Handoff Notes
What the next agent or user needs to know before continuing.
```

---

## Cleanup

When a plan is fully complete and verified:

- Prepend `COMPLETE-` to the filename, or
- Move to `.cursor/plans/completed/` subfolder
