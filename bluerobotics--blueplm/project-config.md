# SolidWorks Service

## Version Bumping (MANDATORY for every change)

Every change to the SolidWorks service MUST bump the version in BOTH files:

1. `solidworks-service/BluePLM.SolidWorksService/Program.cs` → bump `SERVICE_VERSION`
2. `src/lib/swServiceVersion.ts` → bump `EXPECTED_SW_SERVICE_VERSION` (and `MINIMUM_COMPATIBLE_SW_SERVICE_VERSION` for breaking changes)
3. `src/lib/swServiceVersion.ts` → add entry to `SW_SERVICE_VERSION_DESCRIPTIONS` with a short changelog
4. `src/lib/swServiceVersion.ts` → update the VERSION HISTORY comment block

Uses semver: bump PATCH for fixes, MINOR for features, MAJOR for breaking changes.

## ALWAYS After Changes

1. **Bump the version** (see above)
2. **Close BluePLM app** if running (the service exe is locked while in use)
3. **Rebuild** the service:

```powershell
cd solidworks-service/BluePLM.SolidWorksService && dotnet build -c Release
```

Why: The Electron app loads the compiled `.exe` from `bin/Release/`. Without rebuilding and restarting, your code changes won't take effect. Always build with `-c Release` (not Debug).
