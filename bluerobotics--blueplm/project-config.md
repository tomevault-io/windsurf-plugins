# Critical Rules

## Multi-Agent Plans (READ FIRST)

Before creating plans for multiple agents, you **MUST** read `.cursor/rules/plans.mdc` and follow its structure exactly.

---

## Tool Usage

| Task | Use This | Never This |
|------|----------|------------|
| Read | `read_file` | `cat`, `Get-Content` |
| Write | `write` | `echo >`, `Set-Content` |
| Edit | `search_replace` | `sed`, `awk` |
| Search | `grep` | `rg`, `findstr` |
| **Move** | `Move-Item` (terminal) | write new + delete old |
| **Rename** | `Rename-Item` (terminal) | write new + delete old |
| **Delete** | `Remove-Item` (terminal) | — |

## File Move/Rename/Delete (CRITICAL)

**NEVER** recreate files from scratch when moving or renaming. Use PowerShell:

```powershell
Move-Item -Path "old/path/file.ts" -Destination "new/path/file.ts"
Rename-Item -Path "file.ts" -NewName "newname.ts"
Remove-Item -Path "file.ts"
```

Why: Recreating files risks losing content, comments, or subtle details. Native file operations preserve everything exactly.

Terminal is also for: `git`, `npm`, `npx`, build scripts.

## Schema Versioning (BOTH files, every time)

1. `supabase/schema.sql` → bump INSERT version
2. `src/lib/schemaVersion.ts` → bump EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION

Mismatch = users see "database newer/older than app" warnings.

## API Versioning (BOTH files, every time)

When making API changes:

1. `api/package.json` → bump `version` field
2. `src/lib/apiVersion.ts` → bump `EXPECTED_API_VERSION`
3. Add entry to `API_VERSION_DESCRIPTIONS` with changelog

For **breaking changes** (major version bump):
- Also update `MINIMUM_COMPATIBLE_API_VERSION`

Mismatch = users see "API newer/older than app" warnings.

## Release Gate

Before creating a git tag:

```
npm run typecheck        # must pass
package.json             # version bumped
CHANGELOG.md             # entry added
docs/                    # updated if user-facing
```

## Plans Location (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS** create plan files in the **repository's** `.cursor/plans/` folder:

```
{workspace}/.cursor/plans/{name}.plan.md
```

**NEVER** create plans in:
- User home directory (`~/.cursor/` or `C:\Users\{user}\.cursor\`)
- Cursor's project folder (`~/.cursor/projects/`)
- Any location outside the repository

The correct path is always **relative to the workspace root**, not the user's home directory.

## CLI Commands

New commands go in `src/lib/commands/handlers/`, register in `index.ts`.

## New Features Checklist

Before adding features, verify:

1. **State** → Use `usePDMStore` slices, never new stores (`zustand.mdc`)
2. **Location** → Feature code in `src/features/`, shared in `src/components/` (`architecture.mdc`)
3. **Types** → Shared in `src/types/`, feature-specific in feature folder
