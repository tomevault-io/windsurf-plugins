Use these standards for Python code, focusing on maintainability, best practices, readability, and software organisation.

## Best Practices

### Dependencies

- Dependencies flow one-way, from leaves to root, without cycles (e.g., no circular dependencies).
- Declare all imports at the top of the file, never inside functions/classes.
- Prefer to only import modules and minimize namespace pollution (e.g., `import m; m.f()` over `from m import f; f()`).
- Avoid dynamic imports (e.g., `importlib.import_module`, `__import__`).
- Do not leave unused imports.

### Code Organization

- Avoid premature abstraction and DRYing. Things will often look the same early on, but diverge over time.
- Avoid module-scope logic; imports should have no side effects. Move the logic into functions.
- Prefer composition over subclassing (except `abc.ABC` for abstract base classes).
- List public methods before private methods in classes and modules.
- Prefer named constants and enums over magic values.
- Prefer well-maintained, widely used libraries over custom solutions (e.g., `tenacity` for retries, `gettext` for i18n).
- Prefer `with` context managers over manual resource management.
- Prefer f-strings over `str.format()`, `%`, `format()`.
- Extract constants, use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, place them at the top of the module.
- Avoid explanatory comments. Decompose unclear logic into smaller parts with clear, self-descriptive names.

### Concurrency & Performance

- In `async/await` codebases, avoid blocking I/O (e.g., the `requests` module). Filesystem reads/writes are acceptable.
- Use a single concurrency model (e.g., `async/await` or threads); do not mix models.
- Prefer `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` over `multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool` and `threading.Thread`.
- Prefer `asyncio.create_task()` over `asyncio.ensure_future()`.

### Function Design

- Keep functions small, focused, and single-responsibility.
- Prefer pure functions; when needed, isolate side effects in a clear, well-placed function.
- Avoid mutable default args (use `None` and create the mutable object in the function body).
- Name functions descriptively with verb+noun (e.g., `get_user_data()`, `validate_input()`, `calculate_area_of_circle()`).
- Functions named `from_*`: lookup by the specified identifier; typically returns `T | None`; may return small collections.
- Functions named `list_*`: always return a collection.
- Use British English in names where there is a difference.
- Prefer generators and lazy evaluation where appropriate.
- Prefer keyword-only arguments for functions with non-obvious argument order. (e.g., `def login(username: str, password: str, *, remember_me: bool) -> AuthGrant: ...`)
- Avoid exceptions, prefer `None`/`Enum` returns.

### Type Safety & Introspection

- Use static type hints for function arguments, return values, and collection-typed variables.
- When typing collections, specify the type of all elements.
- Explicitly type decorators (using `ParamSpec` and `Concatenate` when appropriate).
- Use generics (`TypeVar`) where appropriate.
- Avoid reflection (`getattr`, `setattr`, `hasattr`, `delattr`, `dir`, `globals`, `locals`, `exec`, `eval`, most of `inspect`). Exceptions: `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `callable`.
- Prefer `isinstance(x, T)` over `type(x) is T`.
- For singletons, prefer identity checks over equality checks.
- For generics, prefer built-in collections over `typing` aliases (e.g., `list` over `List`).
- Use new Python typing features, prefer `T | None` over `Optional[T]` and `T | Y` over `Union[T, Y]`. Use the `type` keyword when plausible.

### Error Handling & Logging

- Do not catch `BaseException` or use bare `except`; they catch `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`.
- Prefer structured/JSON logging over string interpolation (e.g., `logging.info("Hello", extra={"name": "John"})` over `logging.info(f"Hello {name}")`).
- Use `logging.exception()` instead of `logging.error()` when an exception has been raised to log the stack trace.
- Include `exc_info=True` in non-exception logging calls to log the stack trace when an exception is raised.

## Goals

Ensure the code follows Python best practices and is:

- **Maintainable**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend
- **Readable**: Clear naming and structure
- **Type-safe**: Proper type hints throughout
- **Well-organized**: Logical dependency flow and clean architecture
- **Robust**: Proper error handling and logging
