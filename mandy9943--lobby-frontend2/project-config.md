## IV. Hooks (`hooks/**/*`)

*   **Behavior:**
    *   Follow the "use" naming convention for custom hooks.
    *   Keep hooks focused on specific logic (e.g., data fetching, authentication).
    *   Utilize `useSWR` for data fetching and caching.
    *   Return a consistent object with `data`, `error`, `isLoading`, and `mutate`.
    *   Add error handling and loging in all hooks.
    *   Make sure that you consume data from the api in a type safe way, creating types or interfaces in `/types` when necessary.
    *   When logging errors, use the following convetion `console.error("Description of the error", error)`

## V. Email Template Generation (`app/(Home)/components/AiCustomizationDialog.tsx`, `app/(Home)/components/ResultsTable.tsx`, `services/leads-api/email-generator.ts`)

*   **Description:** Rules relating to generating email templates.
*   **File Pattern:** `app/(Home)/components/AiCustomizationDialog.tsx, app/(Home)/components/ResultsTable.tsx, services/leads-api/email-generator.ts`
