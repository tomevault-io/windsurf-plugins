# TH095 reconstruction agent rules

This repository reconstructs one exact binary: the original Japanese TH095
version 1.02a executable whose SHA-256 is
`bb54f6fc54f0eeffaec416ca9f64aef32b5f59b7427fa5a6579f6538e0eddc07`.
Do not analyze or substitute a localized, patched, Steam, trial, or earlier
executable.

## Before changing reconstruction state

1. Read `docs/RE_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
   `docs/RE_WORKFLOW.md`, and the relevant source.
2. Inspect `git status`, then run:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/verify-target.py
   python3 scripts/report-reconstruction-status.py --summary
   python3 scripts/validate-tracking.py --require-target
   ```

3. Before relying on IDA, call `check_connection`, `get_metadata`, and
   `get_entry_points` through IDA Pro MCP. The module SHA-256, MD5, size, image
   base, image size, and entry point must agree with `config/target.toml`.
   The GPT-web bridge performs this check plus mapped-byte sampling before
   every native IDA operation.
4. Confirm the address in `config/functions.csv`. IDA's function extent and
   the ledger's historical Ghidra extent are both provisional until complete
   control flow and padding are reconciled.
5. Keep mapping, source presence, semantic acceptance, and byte-exact matching
   as separate facts. None implies another.
6. Build and compare the smallest affected function or object before broad
   edits.

## Evidence and state

- Separate exact target observations, IDA observations, compiler-oracle
  results, external corroboration, inferences, and unknowns. Never paste
  decompiler output as source.
- `config/functions.csv` is the provisional boundary ledger.
- `config/function-origins.csv` separately classifies authored, compiler, and
  library ownership. Auto-analysis establishes no origin.
- `config/implemented.csv` means source-present only.
- `config/matches.csv` accepts only a reproducible 100% result against the
  verified target. A name, mapping, build, decompile, or visual similarity is
  not exact-match evidence.
- Record an exact result only after adding a reproducible unit to
  `config/match-units.toml` and replaying its canonical comparison.
- Record durable facts in `docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`; keep transient experiments
  below `.analysis/`.

## IDA safety

IDA Pro MCP is the primary semantic-analysis backend. Treat every active IDB as
untrusted until its executable identity, image base, entry point, and sampled
mapped bytes agree with `config/target.toml`. Re-attest after the user switches
the open IDB. The repository's legacy Ghidra project and exports may be used as
historical corroboration, but they are not the live backend.

Never patch target bytes. `patch_address_assembles` is forbidden. IDA databases
are private working state, not the durable record: mirror accepted names,
types, boundaries, and evidence into the repository ledgers. Read back database
writes before relying on them.

## ABI and implementation

- Preserve the Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 x86 ABI: calling conventions,
  scalar widths, class layout, vtable order, RTTI/EH behavior, static
  initialization, and translation-unit ownership.
- Compiler and linker build `3077` are target-observed. Optimization flags,
  runtime model, and object boundaries remain unknown until bounded evidence
  proves them.
- Do not use assembly, copied target bytes, inert locals, fake returns, ABI
  lies, or arbitrary padding to force a comparison.
- Keep generated files below `build/`, private scratch below `.analysis/`, IDA
  databases outside the repository, and any legacy Ghidra database below
  `ghidra-project/`.
- Never commit original executables, game archives/data, IDA or Ghidra
  databases, downloaded toolchains, generated decompiler output, or
  credentials.

## Session discipline

- Use one writable reconstruction session at a time. Do not delegate matching
  or run concurrent VC7.1 builds.
- Keep `config/claims.csv` header-only.
- Work on one bounded address or one coherent workflow-maintenance batch at a
  time and commit stable checkpoints before handoff.
- Re-run every affected accepted unit after changing a shared header,
  type/layout, compiler flag, object partition, or relocation ledger.
