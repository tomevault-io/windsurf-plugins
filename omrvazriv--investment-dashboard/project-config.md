# CLAUDE.md — Investment Aggregator

> This file is loaded into context at the start of every Claude Code session in

## What this project is

A single-user, self-hosted system that aggregates one person's investments from
five sources (Public, Webull, Robinhood crypto, Coinbase, and a Stellar/Lobstr
wallet) into one local dashboard, computes portfolio metrics, and feeds a
research-grounded AI assistant (Claude Cowork) that helps the owner shape and
improve an investment **strategy** over time.

It runs on an internal-network-only Ubuntu Server 26.04 VM. It is read-only with
respect to every brokerage: it observes and analyzes; it never transacts.

## Prime directives (do not violate)

1. **No execution. Ever.** There is no code path anywhere in this repository that
   places, modifies, or cancels an order; transfers, deposits, withdraws,
   converts, or moves funds or assets; or changes any brokerage account setting.
   Connector modules expose read methods only. See ADR-0002 and
   `scripts/check_readonly.sh`.
2. **Brokerage API keys are trade-capable and must be treated as high-risk
   secrets.** Public, Webull, and Robinhood keys can trade even though we never
   use that capability. They live only in `systemd` encrypted credentials,
   decrypted in memory at runtime. Never in code, env files committed to git,
   logs, the database, or anything served to the browser. See ADR-0008 and
   `docs/guides/02-security-model.md`.
3. **The agent is advisory, not directive, and never unsupported.** Outputs are
   decision-support for the owner, who ratifies every decision and performs every
   trade manually. No assertion about markets ships without a citation to fetched,
   dated research or to the deterministic pipeline. The model never answers
   time-sensitive questions (prices, rates, news, current conditions) from its own
   memory — it fetches. See ADR-0010 and
   `docs/guides/06-agent-grounding-and-strategy-evolution.md`.
4. **The owner is not a licensed financial advisor and neither is this software.**
   Frame analysis as options and reasoned recommendations tied to the owner's own
   written strategy, with tradeoffs and confidence — never as guaranteed outcomes.

## Architecture at a glance

- **Ingestion worker** (`worker/`): Python, polls the five sources hourly via a
  read-only connector layer, normalizes data, writes to SQLite. Runs as a
  hardened `systemd` service.
- **Pricing layer** (`worker/pricing/`): provider-agnostic quote service with
  failover and reconciliation. Equities: Finnhub → Twelve Data. Crypto:
  CoinGecko → CoinMarketCap → Coinbase public spot. See ADR-0007.
- **API** (`api/`): FastAPI, **GET-only**, serves computed read data to the
  dashboard. No credentials reach this layer's responses.
- **Web** (`web/`): Next.js + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Recharts dashboard. Holds
  no secrets and has no mutation capability.
- **Exports** (`exports/`): machine-readable snapshots (`portfolio_state.json`,
  `metrics.json`, `valuation_history.parquet`) synced out to the Cowork workspace
  folder. See `docs/reference/data-contracts.md`.
- **Cowork skill** (`cowork/investment-monitor/`): the Agent Skill that teaches
  Claude Cowork the monitoring/assessment/strategy workflow and its guardrails.
- **Strategy** (`strategy/`): the owner's living, versioned investment policy plus
  the evidence ledger and decisions log the agent reads and appends to.

Decisions are recorded as ADRs in `docs/architecture/`. Read the relevant ADR
before changing a decision it covers.
