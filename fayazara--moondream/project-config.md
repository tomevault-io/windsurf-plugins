# Agent Instructions

This is a **TanStack Start + Cloudflare Workers** template. Read this whole
file before generating code. The patterns here are the ones that work - most
AI training data is out of date for both frameworks.

## Stack

- **TanStack Start** (RC) - full-stack React on Vite, file-based routing
- **Cloudflare Workers** as the runtime (not Node, not Pages)
- **Cloudflare D1** (SQLite) as the database
- **Cloudflare R2** for object/file storage
- **Drizzle ORM** + **Drizzle Kit** for schema and migrations
- **Zod** for input validation (`drizzle-zod` for table-derived schemas)
- **Tailwind v4** + **Kumo** (`@cloudflare/kumo`) for UI
- **Phosphor Icons** (`@phosphor-icons/react`) for icons - Kumo's
  recommended icon set

## Skills

This template includes agent skills for common workflows. Load a skill
when the task matches - it will give you the exact steps and patterns.

| Skill | When to use |
|---|---|
| `new-api-route` | Creating a new HTTP endpoint (REST route) |
| `new-db-table` | Adding a table, modifying the schema, creating a model |
| `add-binding` | Adding a Cloudflare binding (KV, R2, D1, Queue, secret, var) |

## How bindings work - read this first

Bindings (D1, KV, R2, secrets, vars) are declared in `wrangler.jsonc` and
accessed on the **server only** via:

```ts
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers"

env.DB      // D1Database
env.STORAGE // R2Bucket
```

Rules:

- `cloudflare:workers` is a **virtual module**. Only import it from
  server-only code: server functions, API route `server.handlers`,
  middleware. Never from a client component or anything that runs in the
  browser.
- Do **not** pass `env` through function arguments. Import it where you
  need it. Top-level `import { env } from "cloudflare:workers"` is the
  blessed pattern.
- After editing `wrangler.jsonc`, run `npm run cf-typegen` to refresh
  `worker-configuration.d.ts` so `env.DB` and `env.STORAGE` are typed.

The Drizzle client in `src/db/index.ts` already wraps `env.DB`:

```ts
import { db } from "@/db"
import { items } from "@/db/schema"

await db.select().from(items).all()
```

## Server functions vs API routes

This template ships both. They are different things. Pick correctly.

### Server functions - `createServerFn`

Use for data the **app's own UI** consumes. They are typed RPCs, not URLs.

```ts
// src/routes/index.tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start"

const getItems = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  return await db.select().from(items).all()
})

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  loader: () => getItems(),
  component: App,
})
```

- Called like `getItems()` from a loader/component.
- Inputs validated via `.inputValidator(...)` / `.validator(...)`.
- No URL to think about, no manual `fetch`.

### API routes - file-based, `server.handlers`

Use for **external HTTP callers**: curl, mobile apps, webhooks, anything
that needs a stable URL + verb.

```ts
// src/routes/api/items.ts  →  /api/items
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router"

export const Route = createFileRoute("/api/items")({
  server: {
    handlers: {
      GET: async ({ request }) => Response.json([]),
      POST: async ({ request }) => {
        const body = await request.json()
        return Response.json(body, { status: 201 })
      },
    },
  },
})
```

- File path → URL. `src/routes/api/items.$id.ts` → `/api/items/:id`.
- Handlers take `{ request, params }` and return a Web `Response`.
- **No** `component` field needed if it's a pure API route.

### What NOT to do

- Don't write `createServerFileRoute(...)`. That's an old API. Use
  `createFileRoute(...).server.handlers`.
- Don't write a Hono/Express app inside the Worker entry. TanStack Start's
  server entry already handles routing - just add a file route.
- Don't import `process.env` for bindings. It won't work.
- Don't pass `env` as a parameter. Import it.

## Database workflow

The schema lives in `src/db/schema.ts`. To change it:

```bash
# 1. edit src/db/schema.ts
npm run db:generate       # writes SQL to ./drizzle/
npm run db:migrate        # applies to LOCAL D1 (default for dev)
npm run db:migrate:prod   # applies to REMOTE D1 (production)
```

Notes:

- Migrations live in `./drizzle/` and are applied by **wrangler**, not by
  drizzle-kit. This is intentional - D1 has its own migrations system and
  we want a single source of truth.
- `db:migrate` is `wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --local`. Local D1 data
  lives in `.wrangler/state/`.
- First-time setup requires creating the D1 database:
  ```bash
  npx wrangler d1 create tanstack-start-workers-template-db
  ```
  Then paste the printed `database_id` into `wrangler.jsonc`.

## R2 object storage

The `STORAGE` R2 bucket binding is declared in `wrangler.jsonc`. Use it
for file uploads, user content, generated assets, etc.

```ts
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers"

// Upload
await env.STORAGE.put("photos/cat.jpg", fileBody, {
  httpMetadata: { contentType: "image/jpeg" },
})

// Download
const object = await env.STORAGE.get("photos/cat.jpg")
if (object) {
  // object.body is a ReadableStream
  // object.httpMetadata?.contentType for MIME type
}

// Delete
await env.STORAGE.delete("photos/cat.jpg")

// List
