## Keep the Why

This project records the reasoning behind its code with the Keep the Why
skill (https://keepthewhy.com) — the `.keep-the-why` file at the project
root is its config. Before doing anything else in a session, whatever the
first request is about, load the skill: in Claude Code, invoke the
`keep-the-why` skill (Skill tool); in any other agent, read
`.claude/skills/keep-the-why/SKILL.md` and follow it, including the
`references/*.md` files it points to for the situation at hand.
