$meta:
  name: 'typescriptConventions'
  goal: 'establishTypescriptBestPractices'
  domain: 'development.typescript.standards'
  apply: 'typescriptFiles'
  version: 1.0
  purpose: "Define TypeScript coding conventions and best practices for type safety and maintainability"
  domains: ['development.typescript.standards', 'codebase.types.definition', 'architecture.type.safety']

types:
  purpose: "TypeScript type definition best practices"
  
  enumOverUnion:
    rule: "Prefer enums over union types for better maintainability and IDE support"
    rationale: "Enums provide better refactoring support, autocomplete, and value grouping for fixed sets of constants"
    examples:
      preferred: "enum Status { Pending = 'pending', Success = 'success', Error = 'error' }"
      avoid: "type Status = 'pending' | 'success' | 'error'"
    exceptions: "Use union types when you need type-only definitions or when values come from external sources"
      
  discriminatedUnions:
    rule: "Split complex types into discriminated unions for better type narrowing"
    description: "Break down types with optional properties into explicit success/failure states"
    example:
      bad: |
        type Response = {
          success: boolean;
          error?: string;
        }
      good: |
        type SuccessResponse = {
          success: true;
        }
        
        type FailedResponse = {
          success: false;
          error: string;
        }
        
        type Response = SuccessResponse | FailedResponse
      benefits: ['Better type narrowing', 'Eliminates invalid states', 'Improved IntelliSense']
      
  typeOverInterface:
    rule: "Prefer 'type' over 'interface' for type definitions"
    rationale: "Types are more flexible and provide better composition capabilities"
    examples:
      preferred: "type User = { id: string; name: string; }"
      avoid: "interface User { id: string; name: string; }"
    exceptions: "Use interfaces only when declaration merging is specifically needed"

practices:
  purpose: "General TypeScript development practices"
  
  typeLocation:
    rule: "Place types in separate files next to the entities they relate to"
    structure: "Create dedicated .types.ts files alongside implementation files"
    examples:
      preferred: "userService.ts + userService.types.ts"
      avoid: "Centralized types/ directory for domain-specific types"
    exceptions: "Shared utility types can be centralized"
  
  typeComposition:
    principle: "Build complex types through composition of smaller, focused types"
    benefits: ['Reusability', 'Maintainability', 'Clear separation of concerns']
  
  noNonNullAssertion:
    rule: "NEVER use non-null assertion operator (!)"
    rationale: "Non-null assertion bypasses TypeScript's type safety and can lead to runtime errors"
    examples:
      avoid: "const value = someValue!.property"
      preferred: "if (someValue) { const value = someValue.property }"
    alternatives: ['Proper null checks', 'Optional chaining', 'Type guards']
