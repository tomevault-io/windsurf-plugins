# RestBook Python Project Standards

## Filesystem & Structure
- Use `src/` layout with core logic under `src/modules/`
- Keep all user entrypoints (CLI, app init) under `src/main.py`
- Documentation lives under `docs/` (GitHub Pages via Jekyll)
- Example playbooks are in `examples/` and must cover core features
- Unit tests mirror `src/` under `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests (end-to-end) mirror `src/` under `tests/integration/`
- Shared test utilities go in `tests/utils/`

## Code Style
- Follow Black formatting (88 character lines)
- Use isort for consistent imports
- PEP 8 naming conventions:
  - `snake_case` for functions and variables
  - `PascalCase` for classes and Enums
  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- Use absolute imports within `src.modules`, avoid relative ones

## Typing & Models
- All config/data classes must inherit from `pydantic.BaseModel`
- Avoid `Any`; prefer strict types, `Literal`, or `TypedDict`
- Use `Field(...)` for required fields with metadata
- Use `Enum` instead of magic strings (e.g. `AuthType`, `MethodConfig`)
- Type all function parameters and return values
- Prefer `Optional[T]` over `Union[T, None]`
- Use `@model_validator(mode='after')` for inter-field validation
- Validator method names must be prefixed with `validate_`

## Modular Design
- Keep orchestration logic in `playbook/`, requests in `request/`, and sessions in `session/`
- Use factories (e.g., `client_factory.py`, `metrics/factory.py`) for DI-friendly instantiation
- Observers, metrics clients, and checkpoint backends must be pluggable
- Avoid tightly coupling business logic across modules
- CLI commands go under `command/` inside their respective domain

## Testing
- Unit tests use mocks and DI — no I/O or network
- Integration tests load full YAML playbooks and execute steps
- Use pytest and match test structure to `src/`
- Avoid mixing unit and integration logic
- Use `pytest.ini` and `conftest.py` for shared fixtures and config
- Mock HTTP and auth for fast, reliable test runs

## CLI & Interactive
- Interactive CLI is implemented with `Click` or `prompt_toolkit`
- Commands must call orchestrators, not contain business logic
- Commands must support auto-completion and prompt defaults
- Use `restbook run` style commands, support `--from-file`, `--session`, etc.

## Documentation & Developer UX
- Every public model and CLI command must be documented
- Each new config field must be reflected in `docs/playbook-structure.md`
- Jekyll docs must be kept in sync with feature changes
- Playbook examples must reflect retry, metrics, incremental, and auth flows

## Stability & Hardening
- All retries and circuit breakers must be configured, not hardcoded
- Use `timeout` and `on_error` consistently across steps
- Handle Ctrl+C or CLI interruption with graceful shutdown
- Validate checkpoint file integrity before resuming playbooks
- Don’t mutate state during retries or parallel execution

## Extensibility & Plugins
- All observers, metrics, session strategies, and checkpoint backends should register via factory patterns
- Allow 3rd-party plugins to be registered without modifying core
- Future macro or record mode logic must be isolated in its own module
