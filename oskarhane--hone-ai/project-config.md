## Project Overview

PRIMARY LANGUAGES: [Markdown, YAML]

hone-ai is a Claude Code plugin that orchestrates AI agents to implement features from PRDs. Distributed exclusively via the Claude Code plugin marketplace — no CLI, no compiled code.

## Build System

BUILD SYSTEMS: [Bun (dependency management + script runner only)]

Bun is used solely for `bun install` (prettier dep) and `bun run format`. No compilation or bundling.

## Testing Framework

TESTING FRAMEWORKS: [none]

No tests. All plugin content is plain markdown/YAML executed by Claude Code.

Skills are markdown files (SKILL.md) with YAML frontmatter defining step-by-step instructions for Claude Code.

Workflow skills: `init`, `agents-md`, `prd`, `prd-to-tasks`, `extend-prd`, `run`
Info skills: `status`, `prds`, `prune`

## Deployment

DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY: Claude Code plugin marketplace

Published via `/plugin marketplace`. No npm, no binary releases, no Docker.

## Conventions

- All plugin content is plain markdown/YAML; no compiled or transpiled code
- PRDs: `.plans/prd-<feature>.md`, tasks: `.plans/tasks-<feature>.yml`, progress: `.plans/progress-<feature>.txt`
- Run `bun run format` before committing
