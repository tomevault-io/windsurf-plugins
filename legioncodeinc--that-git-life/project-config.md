# Agents

> What agents are, how they work, and how they map across Cursor, Claude Code, and Claude Cowork.

## What an agent is

An agent (also called a subagent) is a focused AI persona with a narrow job, its own instructions, and its own guardrails. Instead of one general assistant trying to do everything, you give each domain its own specialist. A primary orchestrator reads the request, decides which agent owns it, and hands the work off. The agent runs with a clean, purpose-built brief and returns its result.

In this repo, agents are called **Bees**. Each Bee owns exactly one domain (Git, auth, databases, SEO, payments, and so on) and is paired with exactly one **Stinger** (a skill, see [SKILLS.md](./SKILLS.md)). The Bee is the persona and the judgment. The Stinger is the procedural arsenal it reads from. Routing across the whole roster is handled by a skill called `beekeeper-suit`, which keeps an index of every Bee, its trigger phrases, and when NOT to use it.

The agents live in [`.cursor/agents/`](./.cursor/agents/) (and a mirror in [`.claude/agents/`](./.claude/agents/)).

## Anatomy of an agent file

An agent is a single Markdown file with YAML frontmatter on top and instructions below:

```markdown
---
name: git-worker-bee
description: When to use this agent and what it owns. The orchestrator reads
  this to decide routing, so it is specific about trigger phrases and scope.
proactive: true
---

# Git Worker Bee

Identity, responsibilities, hard rules, and the workflow the agent follows.
```

- **name** is the handle the orchestrator invokes.
- **description** is the routing contract. Good descriptions say what the agent does, the phrases that should trigger it, and what it explicitly does NOT handle.
- **proactive** (optional) marks an agent that may volunteer when it sees relevant work, versus one that only runs when explicitly called.

## How agents map across harnesses

| Harness | Where agents live | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/agents/*.md` | Custom agents the Cursor orchestrator routes to. This is the source of truth in this repo. |
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/agents/*.md` | Subagents. Same Markdown + frontmatter shape, so the files port directly. Frontmatter may also carry `tools` and `model`. |
| **Claude Cowork** | runs on the Claude Agent SDK | Cowork is built on the same engine as Claude Code, so it executes subagents through its Agent and Task tooling. Cowork's primary distributable unit is the skill, so most cross-harness sharing happens at the skill layer. |

The short version: agents are a first-class concept in Cursor and Claude Code, and they share a file format, so the same agent definition works in both. Cowork leans on skills as the portable unit, while still running agent-style delegation under the hood.

## The orchestration model in this repo

This is not a loose pile of agents. It is a factory with a chain of command:

- **beekeeper-suit** (`.cursor/skills/beekeeper-suit/`) is the router. It holds the roster and decides which Bee owns a request.
- **Bees** (`.cursor/agents/*-worker-bee.md` and a few specials) are the domain specialists.
- **Stingers** (`.cursor/skills/*-stinger/`) are the skills each Bee reads from.
- **The factory line** (`command-center`, `scripture-historian`, `stinger-forge`, `bee-creator`, `hive-registrar`) is how new Bee + Stinger pairs get created, researched, written, and registered. `the-queen` and the proposal step drive that queue.

To see every Bee and its paired Stinger with direct links, check the catalog in the main [README](./README.md).
