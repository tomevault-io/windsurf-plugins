description: Mandatory structure, model routing, and ship gate for every multi-step plan

# Plan Construction Protocol

Every plan you produce MUST follow this structure. No exceptions.

## Step 1 (always first): branch off main

The first step is always to pick a worktree of `main` and create a new feature branch (e.g. `git worktree add ../<feature> -b feature/<slug> main`). All subsequent work happens on that branch, never on `main`.

## Model routing (every step after step 1)

For each task and sub-agent in the plan, name the best-fit model based on the scored rubric and routing heuristic in `legion-shared/model-comparison-matrix.md`. Match the task profile (reasoning depth, code quality, tool use, cost, speed, context, multimodal) to the model. State the chosen model inline with each step and a one-line justification tied to the matrix.

Always use the most recent relevant version of each model. Map the matrix routing choice to one of these current spawnable slugs:

- IDE-bound agentic coding: `composer-2.5` (or `composer-2.5-fast` for tight loops)
- Deep reasoning / autonomous multi-file refactor: `claude-opus-4-8-thinking-high`
- Broad agentic generalist (no single specialty dominant): `gpt-5.5-medium`
- Balanced daily-driver: `claude-4.6-sonnet-medium-thinking`
- High-throughput, cost-conscious agentic + multimodal: `gemini-3.5-flash`
- CLI / terminal / DevOps automation: `gpt-5.3-codex-high`
- Long-form creative / narrative: `claude-fable-5-thinking-high`
- Open-weight / self-hosted / math-research swarms: `kimi-k2.5`
- Build / scaffold automation: `grok-build-0.1`

## Execution on /loop

All plans operate execution on `/loop`. Drive each step in the loop until it completes before advancing.

## Watchdog timers

Spawn watchdog timers to monitor agent progress. If an agent is stalled for a reasonable amount of time, terminate it and respawn with the work distributed across agents (distributed task load). Keep doing this until the current step completes.

## Second-to-last step (always): security

Run `/security-worker-bee`, then remediate every flagged issue of medium severity or higher. Do not advance until all medium+ findings are fixed.

## Last step (always): quality gate

Run `/quality-worker-bee` in a loop, fixing any outstanding issues of medium importance or higher, until the QA report passes cleanly to that standard. Only when it passes cleanly may you declare the branch shippable.

## Ship: commit, push, PR, notify

Once shippable:

1. Commit and push all changes to the feature branch.
2. Open a pull request.
3. Notify the user by returning a message containing:
   - A link to the pull request.
   - A summary of work completed, including the security and QA remediation steps taken.
