# No em dashes

Do not use em dashes (`—`, U+2014) or en dashes (`–`, U+2013) in any prose written for the user. This applies to chat responses, documentation, commit messages, PR descriptions, code comments, and any other content authored on the user's behalf. Regular hyphens (`-`, U+002D) are fine.

## What to use instead

Pick the punctuation that matches the relationship between the clauses:

- **Comma** — brief pause or parenthetical
  - BAD: `Legion is fast — and signed.`
  - GOOD: `Legion is fast, and signed.`

- **Colon** — elaboration or definition
  - BAD: `Legion has one job — find leaks.`
  - GOOD: `Legion has one job: find leaks.`

- **Parentheses** — aside
  - BAD: `Legion — a senior team in a box — signs everything.`
  - GOOD: `Legion (a senior team in a box) signs everything.`

- **Period** — two independent thoughts
  - BAD: `Connect your repo — get a signed report in minutes.`
  - GOOD: `Connect your repo. Get a signed report in minutes.`

- **Semicolon** — two related independent clauses
  - BAD: `Scanners run in isolation — every container self-destructs.`
  - GOOD: `Scanners run in isolation; every container self-destructs.`

## Exceptions

- Preserve em or en dashes inside verbatim user quotes.
- Preserve em or en dashes inside code, regex, JSON, or any literal data being matched or processed.
- Do not rewrite em or en dashes in pre-existing file content that is outside the scope of the current edit.

## Self-check before sending

Before sending any response or saving any file, scan the output for `—` and `–`. If found in newly authored prose, replace per the substitution table above.
