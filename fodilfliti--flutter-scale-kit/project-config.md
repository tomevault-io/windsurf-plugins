# Flutter Scale Kit — session memory

This repo is the **flutter_scale_kit** pub package (responsive scaling). It is not an app.

## Where to look (in order)

1. `spec/` — product, architecture, invariants, decisions. Start at `spec/README.md`.
2. `lib/` — implementation truth.
3. Codebase Memory MCP project **`flutter_scale_kit`** — symbols, callers, clusters. Index if `list_projects` does not list it.
4. `CHANGELOG.md` — recent behavior.
5. `README.md` — user docs only. Do not load the whole file into context.

## Hard rules

- Do not double-scale: SK widgets must `resolve*` already-marked `.w/.h/.sp` values.
- Extension methods return FFI-safe plain doubles (Map tracker, never Expando on the number).
- `ScaleValueCache` stays LRU-capped; clear cache + tracker together on resize.
- Platform detection stays web/Wasm-safe (`kIsWeb` first).
- If you change behavior, update `spec/` in the same change.
- Device queries: `context.isMobile` = viewport **width** only (false on landscape phones). Use `isResponsiveMobile` / `isTypeOfMobile()` for scaling; `isMobilePlatform` for OS. Guide: `skills/flutter-scale-kit/device-classification.md`.
- `designType` on `ScaleKitBuilder` is not wired — use `deviceTypeOverride` to force.
- Sibling package `flutter_scale_theme_kit` is look-only. Do not import it from `lib/`. If a consumer app depends on it, merge via `createResponsiveTextTheme` on `appST.light` / `appST.dark`; do not use `ResponsiveThemeData.create` as the full theme.
