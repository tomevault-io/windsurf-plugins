description: Maintainer uses FVM to switch Flutter SDKs — never upgrade the global install
---


# Flutter SDK (this maintainer)

The author switches Flutter with **FVM** (`fvm`). This repo is pinned in `.fvmrc` to **3.35.7** (newest SDK in their FVM cache).

- Use `fvm flutter` / `fvm dart` in this project. Do **not** run `flutter upgrade` / `flutter channel` on `C:\Users\lemsa\Documents\flutter`.
- Package floor stays Dart `^3.7.2` and Flutter `>=3.29.0` so older apps still resolve this package.
