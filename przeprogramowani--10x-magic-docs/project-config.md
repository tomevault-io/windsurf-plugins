Developing React components in Astro application
## Frontend

### Guidelines for React

#### React Coding Standards

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Prefer relying on Tailwind media queries instead of manual style recalculations
- Use Tailwind responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs - under no circumstances calculate this manually
- When addining shadcn/ui components, always use new cli syntax: `npx shadcn@latest add hover-card`

#### Component Type Definitions

- All reusable component types should be defined in `src/components/tools/tools.types.ts`
- Each type definition must include:
  - Interface for component props
  - JSDoc comments with description and usage examples
  - Clear naming conventions (e.g., `ComponentNameProps`)

#### shadcn/ui Components

- All shadcn components are stored in `src/components/ui/`
- Each component should:
  - Use relative imports for utilities (e.g., `../../lib/utils`)
  - Include proper data-slot attributes for styling
  - Maintain the standard shadcn structure with Root/Trigger/Content pattern where applicable
