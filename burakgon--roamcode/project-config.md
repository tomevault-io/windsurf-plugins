# Repository instructions for coding agents

These instructions apply to the entire repository. This is a public repository: write every file, commit,
log, issue, release note, and command as if it will be visible to anyone on the internet.

## Public-repository safety

- Never commit, print, paste, or request credentials, access tokens, cookies, private keys, `.npmrc` contents,
  signing material, or authenticated URLs. Use the existing GitHub environments and trusted publishing.
- Never add a maintainer's username, home directory, machine-specific absolute path, private hostname, tunnel URL,
  session identifier, or production log contents to the repository.
- Keep local service data, live sessions, and unrelated worktree changes intact. Do not clean, reset, or overwrite
  changes that are outside the requested task.
- Do not mutate or restart a developer's installed RoamCode service merely to test a change. A live install, manual
  migration, rollback, or restart requires an explicit user request. Use isolated tests and GitHub Actions for boot
  and package-install smoke tests.

## Stable release and OTA contract

- A commit or push to `main` is not an update. Users discover updates only through stable, non-draft GitHub Releases.
- Stable SemVer (`X.Y.Z`) is the only release identity. The workspace, CLI, server, web package, npm artifacts,
  GitHub tag/release, release manifest, and Homebrew formula must agree on the exact version.
- The stable release workflow must publish npm artifacts and the Homebrew formula before it creates the discoverable
  GitHub Release. Never manually reverse this order.
- OTA installs the exact npm version whose integrity is recorded in `roamcode-release.json`; do not reintroduce
  commit-, branch-, or checkout-based update behavior.
- Release descriptions are user-facing OTA data. `scripts/release-notes.mjs` extracts them from `CHANGELOG.md`, and
  the web client groups their Markdown bullets under headings such as `Added`, `Fixed`, and `Changed`. Every release
  section must contain at least one accurate bullet so **What's new** is never empty.
- Never reuse a published version for different package bytes. If a workflow fails, first determine which external
  artifacts exist; resume only when the workflow can prove any existing immutable npm artifacts match exactly.

## Releasing a stable version

Only perform release mutations—version bump, release commit, push, workflow dispatch, tag, or external
publication—when the user explicitly asks to release or publish. For implementation-only requests, prepare and
verify the change but leave publication to the user.

The canonical design and channel details are in `docs/releases.md`. When a release is authorized:

1. Inspect the worktree and current releases. Preserve unrelated user changes and choose the next unused stable
   SemVer version.
2. Move the relevant notes from `CHANGELOG.md`'s `Unreleased` section into `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`. Write concise,
   user-facing Markdown bullets describing actual behavior; do not use commit messages as release notes.
3. Run `pnpm release:prepare X.Y.Z`. Confirm all four package manifests carry the same version and review the
   resulting diff.
4. Run proportionate local checks, including formatting, lint, type checking, relevant unit tests, and package builds.
   Keep this gate scoped to the changed behavior instead of routinely duplicating the complete CI suite locally. Do
   not use the developer's live service or default tmux/data locations as a test fixture. If that exact source diff
   already passed its proportionate checks before `release:prepare` and preparation changed only version manifests
   and release notes, do not rerun the same full test/build suite; review those mechanical changes and let exact-commit
   CI perform the expensive gate once.
5. Commit only the intended release scope and push the reviewed commit to `main`. That push starts the full parallel
   `CI` run, which performs the expensive verification once and preserves the attested npm tarballs.
6. Immediately dispatch the single release orchestrator; it waits for that exact commit's complete successful CI run
   and fails closed if CI fails or `main` moves:

   ```sh
   gh workflow run release.yml -f version=X.Y.Z
   ```

7. Monitor that exact workflow run through the CI wait, candidate checksum/attestation verification, npm publication,
   manifest creation, Homebrew update, and the final GitHub Release step. Do not report success while the run is
   queued or partial. A release workflow must never rebuild candidate bytes.
8. Verify the final GitHub Release has `roamcode-release.json` and non-empty notes, all three npm packages resolve to
   `X.Y.Z`, and the Homebrew formula references `X.Y.Z`.

The clean public installer smoke runs weekly and whenever installer code changes. Manually dispatch it for changes to
the installer, updater, package layout, native dependencies, or release infrastructure; an ordinary UI-only release
must not wait on a duplicate public install after its packed-runtime candidate has already passed.

Do not run `npm publish`, create the stable GitHub Release, push a release tag, or edit the Homebrew tap by hand during
