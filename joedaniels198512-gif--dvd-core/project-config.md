# SS1 / MiSTer DVD Core — Non-negotiable Constraints

Target: **SuperStation One (SS1) / MiSTer**. CPU: dual-core ARM **Cortex-A9,
ARMv7-A, NEON + VFPv3** (⚠️ **no VFPv4 / no fused multiply-add**).

## Toolchain

- ✅ Use `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf-gcc`.
- ❌ **NEVER** use `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf-gcc`. Its runtime emitted VFPv4
  `VFMA`/`VFMS` instructions → **SIGILL** on the Cortex-A9. This is proven.
- Compile flags: `-march=armv7-a -mcpu=cortex-a9 -marm -mfpu=neon-vfpv3 -mfloat-abi=hard`.
- Keep the `objdump` no-VFPv4 gate in `player/build_mac.sh`
  (`vfma|vfms|vfnma|vfnms` ⇒ refuse to deploy).

## Architecture

- ARM **decodes at native DVD resolution** (720×576 PAL / 720×480 NTSC) and does
  YUV→BGR0 (~3.5 ms/frame). It must **NOT** do final display scaling
  (CPU scale ≈ 104 ms/frame — not viable).
- **Scaling/output is the FPGA's job** via the MiSTer video framework.
- Before writing custom framebuffer/scaler RTL, **prefer the existing
  `MISTER_FB` / ASCAL infrastructure** in `fpga/sys/`.

## Do-not-touch / safety

- Do **not** modify files in `fpga/sys/` (framework; updates overwrite it) unless
  proven absolutely necessary.
- Do **not** make destructive changes to known-working player code without
  preserving it in Git first.
- Prefer scripts and normal source-file edits over generating source via shell
  heredocs.
- FPGA/Quartus compiles: **never** run locally. Do **not** use Docker image
  `quartus-mister-rosetta`, `raetro/quartus` on this Mac, or any other
  Rosetta/amd64-on-ARM Quartus. Local Rosetta compiles do not work for us.
- When an FPGA compile is required, use **GitHub Actions only**:
  `.github/workflows/build-core.yml` (`raetro/quartus:17.0` on `ubuntu-latest`).
  `gh workflow run build-core.yml --ref <branch>` after the FPGA source is
  on that remote branch. Download the `DVD.rbf` artifact. Do not start a
  second compile while one is running.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for full details and measurements.
