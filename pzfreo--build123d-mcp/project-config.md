# build123d-mcp

## Running tests

Always use `uv run pytest` — it auto-installs all dependencies from `pyproject.toml` before running.

```
uv run pytest tests/
```

The target is 100% passing. There are no accepted pre-existing failures — if tests are failing, fix them.

## Running the server

```
uv tool run --python 3.12 build123d-mcp
```

Communicates over stdio (FastMCP). When configuring an MCP client, set `cwd` to the project root.

## Project structure

```
server.py          — FastMCP entry point; registers all MCP tools; holds module-level _session singleton
session.py         — Persistent state: namespace, current_shape, objects dict, snapshots
security.py        — Three-layer defence: AST check → restricted builtins → exec timeout
tools/execute.py   — Thin wrapper delegating to session.execute()
tools/render.py    — pyvista-based PNG rendering; headless (xvfb) if no DISPLAY
tools/measure.py   — Geometry queries returning JSON (bounding_box, volume, area, wall thickness, clearance)
tools/export.py    — STEP/STL export; path traversal blocked
```

## Adding a new tool

1. Create `tools/<name>.py` with a function `def <name>(session, ...) -> str`.
   Optional parameters must carry their defaults on this function — the worker
   wire omits arguments the caller didn't supply.
2. Add a typed stub method on `WorkerSession` in `worker.py`:
   ```python
   @_op(_tool(f"{_T}.<name>:<name>"), _GEOMETRY_TIMEOUT)
   def <name>(self, arg1: str, arg2: float = 0.0) -> str:
       raise NotImplementedError
   ```
   The `@_op` decorator registers the op in `_OPS` and replaces the body with
   bind-and-send — the signature is the single typed wire interface, so keep
   its defaults equal to the tool function's. Ops that need more than
   `fn(session, **args)` in the worker get a small `_op_<name>` handler
   instead of `_tool(...)`.
3. Register in `server.py`:
   ```python
   @mcp.tool()
   def <name>(...) -> str:
       """Docstring shown to MCP clients."""
       return _session.<name>(...)
   ```
4. Classify the op in `tests/test_worker_boundary_coverage.py` (add it to the
   smoke inventory, `SESSION_STATEFUL_TOOLS`, or the reasoned allowlist) —
   `test_every_dispatch_op_is_classified` fails until you do.

## Session model

- **Namespace persists** across `execute()` calls — imports and variables accumulate.
- **`current_shape`** is auto-detected after each execute: an explicit `show()`/`annotate()` in the call wins, then a variable named `result`, then any new `BuildPart` or `Shape`.
- **`objects` dict** holds named shapes registered via `show(shape, name=None)`. Name defaults to `"shape"` if omitted.
- **Snapshots** save `current_shape` + `objects` only — the Python namespace is NOT restored on `restore_snapshot()`.
- **`reset()`** clears everything: namespace, shapes, objects, snapshots.

## Security model

Three layers, all must pass before user code runs:

1. **AST check** — blocks imports of anything not in the allowlist (`build123d`, `math`, `numpy`, `typing`, `collections`, `itertools`, `functools`, `copy`) and bare calls to `eval`, `exec`, `open`, etc.
2. **Restricted builtins** — exec namespace gets a filtered `__builtins__` dict; `open`, `eval`, `exec`, `compile` removed; `__import__` wrapped to enforce the same allowlist at runtime.
3. **Exec timeout** — default 120 s wall-clock, configurable via `--exec-timeout` CLI flag or `BUILD123D_EXEC_TIMEOUT` env var. After timeout, the thread continues in background and the namespace may be dirty; callers should `reset()` or `restore_snapshot()`.

Known limits: memory exhaustion is not bounded; Python introspection chains can escape the sandbox; part-library files (`--library`) are trusted input — the AST check on them is non-transitive.

## Gotchas

- After a timeout the namespace may be partially modified — don't trust state without a reset.
- `restore_snapshot()` restores geometry only; Python variables set after the snapshot remain in scope.
- `show()` stores shapes by reference; mutating the shape object after calling `show()` will affect the stored object.
- Clip plane in `render_view` slices at the mesh's own bounding-box midpoint, not world origin.

## Releasing

**Cutting a release means one command:** `gh release create vX.Y.Z --generate-notes` (or use the GitHub Release UI). That triggers the `Publish` workflow which builds, uploads to PyPI, and auto-bumps `pyproject.toml` to the next `.dev0` version. Nothing else is needed.

**Never edit `pyproject.toml` manually. Never push tags manually.** Manual edits/tags don't trigger the publish workflow and create orphan tags + version drift. If you see `pyproject.toml` showing `0.3.14.dev0`, that means `0.3.13` is the current PyPI release and `0.3.14` is the next planned release; don't "fix" the version.

**Version convention:** between releases, `pyproject.toml` carries a `.dev0` suffix (PEP 440 dev release). `0.3.12 < 0.3.13.dev0 < 0.3.13.dev99 < 0.3.13` — TestPyPI builds (`.devN`) are always newer than the last published release but older than the eventual real release.

**Before cutting a release:** make sure `CHANGELOG.md`'s top entry matches the version you're about to release (strip the `.dev0` suffix mentally — `pyproject.toml = 0.3.14.dev0` means you're cutting `v0.3.14`).
