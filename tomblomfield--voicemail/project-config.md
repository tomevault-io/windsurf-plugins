## Local development

Environment variables are not checked into the repo. Copy from the canonical source:

```
cp /Users/tom/Code/voice-email/.env .
```

Required vars: OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI, SESSION_SECRET.
See .env.example for details.

## Starting the server

Install dependencies if needed:

```sh
npm ci
```

Start the local dev server on port 3000:

```sh
npm run dev
```

If port 3000 is already in use, stop the existing listener first and then restart:

```sh
lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN
kill -9 <pid>
npm run dev
```

The app should be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Google OAuth 2.0 for Gmail + Calendar access
- OpenAI Realtime API for voice interaction

## Merging and deploying

**NEVER merge to main or deploy to Railway without the user's explicit instruction.**
Always wait for the user to say to merge/push/deploy before running those commands.

## Deploying to Railway

The app is hosted on Railway (project: `voice-email`, service: `voice-email`, environment: `production`).

```
railway link --project voice-email
railway up --detach --service voice-email
```

The production URL is https://voice-email-production.up.railway.app.

## Querying production users

The production database is PostgreSQL on Railway. To list all signed-up users:

```sh
railway link --project voice-email
railway variables -s Postgres 2>&1 | grep DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL
```

Then query using the public URL:

```sh
node -e "
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: '<DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL from above>' });
pool.query('SELECT email, created_at::date AS signed_up, last_session_at::date AS last_active FROM users ORDER BY created_at').then(r => {
  console.table(r.rows);
  console.log('Total:', r.rows.length);
  pool.end();
});
"
```

The public URL follows the pattern `postgresql://postgres:<password>@maglev.proxy.rlwy.net:<port>/railway`. The internal URL (`postgres.railway.internal`) only works from within Railway's network.

The `users` table schema:
- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `email` (VARCHAR 255, unique)
- `home_address`, `work_address` (TEXT)
- `phone_number` (VARCHAR 50)
- `conference_link` (TEXT)
- `created_at`, `last_session_at`, `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

Related tables: `google_accounts` (linked OAuth accounts), `user_memories` (conversation context).

## Testing

```
npm test
```

Uses Vitest. Tests live next to source files (e.g. `gmail.test.ts`).

**All tests must pass locally, including `db.test.ts`.** The db tests run against a
local PostgreSQL database (`voicemail_dev`). Before running tests, ensure:

1. Local Postgres is running (`pg_isready` should show "accepting connections")
2. The `.env` file is present with `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/voicemail_dev`
   (copy from canonical source: `cp /Users/tom/Code/voice-email/.env .`)

If `DATABASE_URL` is missing, `db.test.ts` will throw a clear error — do not skip or
bypass it. Always run `npm test` and confirm **0 skipped, 0 failed** before committing.
