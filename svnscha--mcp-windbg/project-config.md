# mcp-windbg

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that lets AI models
analyze Windows crash dumps and drive live or remote debugging through WinDbg/CDB. It is a
Python wrapper around `cdb.exe`: the model calls MCP tools, the server runs the matching
debugger commands and returns the text output. Windows-only (needs CDB). The single entry
point is `mcp-windbg`, which speaks MCP over stdio or streamable-http.

## Build / test / run

Python 3.10+ with the `uv` package manager. CDB must be installed for the live tests (WinDbg
from the Microsoft Store, or the Windows SDK).

```powershell
uv sync --dev                                                       # install incl. dev deps
uv run pytest src/mcp_windbg/tests/ -v                             # full test suite
uv run pytest src/mcp_windbg/tests/ -v -m "not live"              # hermetic subset (no CDB)
uv run python -m mcp_windbg --verbose                              # run the server (stdio)
uv run python -m mcp_windbg --transport streamable-http --port 8000   # HTTP transport
```

### Coverage

The code under test runs in **two** processes, and both must be measured or the number lies:

- the hosted server subprocess, where tool dispatch executes. Set `MCP_WINDBG_COVERAGE` so the
  harness launches it under `coverage run --parallel-mode`.
- the pytest process itself, where the hermetic unit tests (`tests/test_*.py`) run. This needs
  `coverage run -m pytest`, not plain `pytest`. Miss this and every unit test reads as dead
  code: that is how `kd_session.py` once reported 34% while fully tested.

Both write parallel-mode data files that `coverage combine` merges:

```powershell
uv run coverage erase
$env:MCP_WINDBG_COVERAGE = "1"
uv run coverage run -m pytest src/mcp_windbg/tests/     # measures pytest AND the server
$env:MCP_WINDBG_COVERAGE = $null
uv run coverage combine                 # merge the per-process .coverage.* files
uv run coverage report                  # or: uv run coverage html  ->  htmlcov/
```

CI runs exactly this and gates on `--fail-under=88`. To reproduce CI's number, leave
`MCP_WINDBG_KERNEL_CONNECTION` unset so the kernel scenarios skip as they do there. Run it with
the variable set for the honest local number, which covers `kd_session.py` against a real
target rather than a fake process.

### Test suite

The suite is a declarative end-to-end harness: each `tests/scenarios/*.yaml` file is run
against a real `python -m mcp_windbg` server hosted over stdio and driven by a real MCP client
(only the LLM is faked, by the scripted tool calls). Scenarios that need a debugger carry the
`live` (and `remote` / `kernel`) marker and `pytest.skip` cleanly when `cdb.exe` or the Git LFS
dump is absent, so `-m "not live"` always runs and stays green off-Windows. See
`src/mcp_windbg/tests/e2e/README.md` for the scenario format. Test dumps live in
`src/mcp_windbg/tests/dumps/` via Git LFS (`git lfs pull`).

**Kernel scenarios.** `kernel_session.yaml` drives a real kernel target through `kd.exe`. CI has
no target machine, so it skips there; locally, point it at a debuggable VM or box and it runs:

```powershell
$env:MCP_WINDBG_KERNEL_CONNECTION = "net:port=50005,key=1.2.3.4"   # the -k connection string
uv run pytest src/mcp_windbg/tests/ -m kernel -v
```

Kernel code paths that CI cannot reach are held up by the hermetic fake-`kd.exe` tests in
`tests/test_kd_session.py`. Treat those as the CI floor, not as proof the feature works: before
shipping a kernel change, run the `kernel` marker against a real target.

## Layout

```
src/mcp_windbg/
  __init__.py        main(): CLI argument parsing, picks the transport
  __main__.py        module entry point
  server.py          MCP server: tool param models + list_tools + call_tool dispatch
  cdb_session.py     CDBSession: spawns cdb.exe, sends commands, reads output
  filter_script.py   --filter-script loader and tool content hooks
  prompts/           prompt templates (dump-triage.prompt.md)
  tests/             e2e harness: e2e/ (runner + harness), scenarios/*.yaml, dumps/ (Git LFS)
scripts/             check-version-consistency.ps1, validate-server-schema.py, Format-Docs.ps1
examples/            small C++ programs that crash, for generating test dumps
docs/                MkDocs user guide (Material), deployed to GitHub Pages
.github/workflows/   ci.yml -> build-and-test.yml (tests), publish-mcp.yml (PyPI on v* tags),
                     pages.yml (docs deploy)
pyproject.toml       project + dependency config         server.json   MCP registry manifest
```

## Conventions

Topic-scoped conventions live in `.claude/rules/` and load automatically when you read a
matching file:

- `markdown.md` - Markdown typography for every `*.md`: plain hyphens (no em/en dashes), no
  emojis. Run `pwsh scripts/Format-Docs.ps1`. (`**/*.md`)
- `documentation.md` - authoring style for the `docs/` user guide (scenario-first, link to
  the reference, sentence-case). (`docs/**`)

Tool and CLI facts come from `src/mcp_windbg/server.py` (tool schemas) and
`src/mcp_windbg/__init__.py` (command-line options). Keep `docs/reference/` in sync with them.
