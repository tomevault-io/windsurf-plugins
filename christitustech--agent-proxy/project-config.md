# Copilot repository instructions

Read and follow `AGENTS.md`, `SPEC.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `TASKS.md` before
changing this repository.

The product is a per-login-user localhost gateway. Every inference request
routed to a built-in CLI must create or reuse a Herdr-managed agent owned by
the current user. Do not reintroduce a dedicated service account, root-owned
runtime paths, or an invisible headless provider fallback.

Keep changes aligned with the active Phase 4 tasks and run the validation gate
documented in `AGENTS.md`.
