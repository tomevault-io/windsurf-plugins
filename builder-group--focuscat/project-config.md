# Cursor Rules Documentation

Cursor rules are markdown files that provide AI-friendly documentation about our codebase's patterns, conventions, and best practices. Each rule should be structured to maximize AI understanding and application.

## Core Principles
- **Consistency** - Follow consistent structure and formatting for reliable AI interpretation
- **Clarity** - Use clear, specific language and avoid ambiguity
- **Examples** - Provide practical, real-world code examples with explanations
- **Context** - Include necessary implementation details and dependencies
- **Maintenance** - Keep rules updated with current best practices


## File Organization

### Directory Structure
- Always keep rules organized in a flat structure under `.cursor/rules/`
- Always use descriptive, purpose-indicating filenames
- Always follow the naming pattern: `{category}-{name}.mdc`

✅ Good:
```
.cursor/rules/
├── index.mdc                # Central index of all rules
├── style-guide.mdc          # Core coding standards
├── cursor-rules.mdc         # Meta documentation
└── api-patterns.mdc         # API design patterns
```

❌ Bad:
```
.cursor/rules/
├── index.md                 # Wrong: Missing .mdc extension
├── StyleGuide.mdc          # Wrong: Not kebab-case
├── rules/cursor.mdc        # Wrong: Nested directory
└── API_PATTERNS.mdc        # Wrong: Not kebab-case
```

### Rule Metadata
- Always include frontmatter at the start of each rule file
- Always provide all required metadata fields
- Always use descriptive values that aid AI understanding

✅ Good:
```markdown
---
name: api-patterns
description: REST API design patterns for consistent endpoints
---

# API Patterns
```

❌ Bad:
```markdown
# API Patterns  # Wrong: Missing frontmatter

---
name: API        # Wrong: Not matching filename
desc: API stuff  # Wrong: Vague description, wrong field name
---
```

## Document Structure

### Section Organization
- Always start with a clear title and purpose
- Always group related patterns together
- Always use consistent heading levels
- Always include both principles and examples

✅ Good:
```markdown
# Authentication Patterns

Core authentication patterns and best practices for secure user management.

## Core Principles
- **Security First** - Always prioritize security best practices
- **User Experience** - Make auth flows intuitive and reliable

## Implementation Guidelines

### Token Management
- Always use secure HTTP-only cookies for tokens
- Always implement proper token rotation
```

❌ Bad:
```markdown
Authentication  # Wrong: No heading level

This document is about auth.  # Wrong: Vague introduction

Guidelines  # Wrong: Inconsistent heading levels
* Use cookies  # Wrong: Inconsistent list style
* Rotate tokens  # Wrong: No context or explanation
```

### Example Format
- Always provide both good and bad examples
- Always explain why something is good or bad
- Always use consistent formatting for examples
- Always include relevant context

✅ Good:
```markdown
### Error Handling
- Always handle errors explicitly
- Always provide helpful error messages
- Always use typed error responses

✅ Good:
```typescript
// Type-safe error handling with context
async function authenticate(credentials: TCredentials): Promise<TResult> {
  try {
    return await auth.verify(credentials);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new AuthError('Invalid credentials', { cause: error });
  }
}
```

❌ Bad:
```typescript
// Missing types and error context
async function authenticate(credentials) {
  try {
    return await auth.verify(credentials);
  } catch (e) {
    throw e;  // Wrong: Lost error context
  }
}
```
```

❌ Bad:
```markdown
Here's how to handle errors:

```js
// No explanation of what's good/bad
function auth(cred) {
  return auth.verify(cred).catch(e => { throw e })
}
```
```

### Language and Precision
- Always use declarative language ("Always", "Never")
- Always provide specific, measurable criteria
- Always explain the reasoning behind rules

✅ Good:
```markdown
### Component Size
- Always limit components to 100 lines of code
- Always break down components that handle multiple concerns
- Always extract repeated logic into custom hooks

Reasoning: Smaller components are easier to test, maintain, and reuse.
```

❌ Bad:
```markdown
### Components
- Try to keep components small  # Wrong: Not specific
- Maybe split up big components  # Wrong: Not declarative
- Reuse when possible  # Wrong: No clear criteria
```

## Creating Effective Examples

### Example Guidelines
- **Always use simple, generic examples** - Create examples that demonstrate the pattern clearly without domain complexity
- **Never use complex codebase examples** - Avoid bloated, real-world code that obscures the main point
- **Always focus on the principle** - Make the good vs bad distinction obvious and immediate
- **Always keep examples short** - Use minimal code that still shows the complete pattern

✅ Good:
```typescript
// Simple example that clearly shows the pattern
const SUserDto = z
  .object({
    id: z.string().uuid(),
    name: z.string(),
    email: z.email()
  })
  .openapi('UserDto');

export type TUserDto = z.infer<typeof SUserDto>;
```

❌ Bad:
```typescript
// Complex real-world example that obscures the point
