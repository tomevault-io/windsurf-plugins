# Codex Instructions

## Behavior

1. **Think first, then act** - Read the codebase for relevant files before making changes.

2. **Check in before major changes** - Before making any significant changes, check in with me and I will verify the plan.

3. **Explain as you go** - Every step of the way, give me a high-level explanation of what changes you made.

4. **Keep it simple (KISS)** - Make every task and code change as simple as possible. Avoid massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.

5. **No speculation** - Never speculate about code you have not opened. If I reference a specific file, you MUST read it before answering. Investigate and read relevant files BEFORE answering questions about the codebase. Never make claims about code before investigating unless certain - give grounded, hallucination-free answers.
