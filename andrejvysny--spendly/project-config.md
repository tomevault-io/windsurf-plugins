# Subagent routing (always-on)

When a user request matches one of the domains below, **delegate early** to the corresponding project subagent and let it drive decisions in its specialty area. Prefer running subagents **in parallel** when work can be cleanly split (e.g. backend + frontend + verification).

## Domain → subagent mapping

- **Import wizard / CSV imports** → `import-wizard`
  - Triggers: “import wizard”, “CSV import”, “mapping”, “clean step”, “import failures”, “imports/wizard”, files under `app/Http/Controllers/Import/`, `app/Services/TransactionImport/`, `app/Services/Csv/`, `resources/js/pages/import/`.

- **GoCardless / Bank Data** → `gocardless`
  - Triggers: “GoCardless”, “bank data”, “requisition”, “institutions”, “token refresh”, “sync transactions”, “mock client”, settings/bank data pages, files under `app/Services/GoCardless/`, `app/Http/Controllers/Settings/BankDataController.php`, `resources/js/pages/settings/bank_data.tsx`.

- **Rule Engine** → `rule-engine`
  - Triggers: “rules”, “conditions”, “operators”, “actions”, “triggers”, “execute rules”, “dry run”, files under `app/Services/RuleEngine/`, `app/Models/RuleEngine/`, `resources/js/pages/rules/`.

- **Frontend UI / React / TypeScript** → `frontend`
  - Triggers: React components/pages/hooks, shadcn/Tailwind work, accessibility, performance, files under `resources/js/**` or `resources/css/**`.

- **Architecture / Algorithms / system design** → `architecture`
  - Triggers: API design, data modeling, performance strategy, algorithm choice, cross-cutting refactors. This agent is **read-only by default** and should return a plan/decision record + recommended next steps.

- **Debugging regressions / failing tests / runtime errors** → `debugger`
- **Run/fix tests** → `test-runner`
- **Independent verification** (after claiming work complete) → `verifier`

## Delegation best practices

- If the request is domain-specific, **route to exactly one specialist** first; only then proceed to implementation.
- If a change spans domains, delegate specialists in parallel (e.g. `gocardless` + `frontend`) and synthesize a single coherent plan before editing.
- Always include key file paths, routes, and invariants from repo docs/rules when delegating so subagents start with the right context.
