# Feedback Processor

Daily Celery task that consumes unconsumed user feedback signals (agent_feedback, judge_feedback, reference_output) to update agent descriptions. The feedback processor is the primary mechanism for translating user signal into improved agent knowledge.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Criteria are NEVER modified.** Only agent descriptions are updated. See `pipeline/criteria.mdc`.
- **Watermark-based consumption.** Two timestamps in `prompt.agent_description` track what has been processed:
  - `feedback_watermark`: latest consumed `agent_feedback`/`judge_feedback` signal
  - `reference_output_watermark`: latest consumed `reference_output` span
  Original feedback data on spans is NEVER deleted or modified.
- **Daily schedule** (86400s production, 60s debug). Feedback accumulates over the day; one daily cycle processes it.

## Eligibility Gates

Both must be true for a prompt to be processed:

1. `agent_description.initial_review_completed == True` — initial review must be done
2. At least **5 unconsumed signals** across agent_feedback, judge_feedback, and reference_output spans newer than the watermarks

## Signal Selection

Up to **20 spans** selected per cycle using diversity balancing:
- Split into positive (any "up" rating), negative (any "down" rating), neutral (reference_output only)
- Take up to 10 from each side (positive/negative)
- Fill remaining slots from the larger side, then neutral
- Minimum of 5 signals required; no cap on individual categories below the 10-per-side limit

## Pipeline

```
Daily trigger (or 60s in debug)
  │
  ▼
For each active prompt:
  ├── Check initial_review_completed → skip if false
  ├── Query unconsumed feedback spans (given_at > feedback_watermark)
  ├── Query unconsumed reference_output spans (created_at > ref_watermark)
  ├── Merge + deduplicate
  ├── Count < 5 → skip
  ├── Select ≤20 diverse spans (_select_diverse_spans)
  ├── Call update_agent_description_from_feedback(prompt_id, span_ids)
  └── Advance feedback_watermark and reference_output_watermark
```

## Interaction with Other Pipeline Stages

| Stage | How feedback processor feeds it |
| ----- | -------------------------------- |
| Judge scoring | Better agent description → more accurate context for scoring |
| Prompt improvement | Better description passed to suggestion generation and improvement LLMs |
| Backtesting | Better description → better model suggestions alignment |

The feedback processor does NOT trigger re-scoring or re-improvement directly. Those run on their own schedules and pick up the updated description on their next cycle.

## Location

`overmind/tasks/feedback_processor.py`

Celery task name: `feedback_processor.process_feedback`
Beat schedule key: `feedback-processor`
Lock name: `feedback_processor`

## Constants

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
| -------- | ----- | ------- |
| `MIN_SIGNALS_REQUIRED` | 5 | Skip if fewer unconsumed signals |
| `MAX_SIGNALS_PER_CYCLE` | 20 | Max spans per update cycle |

## When Modifying This Area

- If you change the watermark field names in `prompt.agent_description`, update `data-models.mdc`
- The processor runs with `@with_task_lock` — only one instance runs at a time across all workers
- The `_has_user_signal()` helper in `prompt_improvement.py` uses the same signal detection logic — keep them in sync if signal types change
- `update_agent_description_from_feedback` opens its own DB session; watermark updates happen in a separate commit in the processor's session after the description update returns
