# AlterLab Academic Skills — by AlterLab Creative Technologies Laboratory

> **Project**: AlterLab Academic Skills — 186+ Claude AI skills for faculty and researchers
> **Owner**: AlterLab Creative Technologies Laboratory

## Project Overview

This project provides **186+ professional Claude AI skills** organized into 13 domain categories for faculty members, academicians, and researchers. Each skill transforms Claude into a domain-specific expert assistant tailored to academic research, scientific computing, and scholarly publishing workflows.

### Audience
- Faculty members and academic researchers
- NOT students (see AlterLab FC for student skills)

### Naming Convention
- **Folder**: `alterlab-{name}` (lowercase, hyphenated)
- **Frontmatter name**: `"alterlab-{name}"`
- **Suite label**: `Part of the AlterLab Academic Skills suite.`

## Core Pipeline Routing Rules

The 4 core pipeline skills coordinate as a multi-agent research-to-publication system:

### Skill Routing

1. **alterlab-research-pipeline vs individual skills**: The pipeline is the full orchestrator (research -> write -> review -> revise -> finalize). If the user only needs a single function (just research, just write, just review), trigger the corresponding skill directly without the pipeline.

2. **alterlab-deep-research vs alterlab-paper-writer**: Complementary. Deep Research = upstream research engine (investigation + fact-checking). Paper Writer = downstream publication engine (paper writing + bilingual abstracts). Recommended flow: deep-research -> paper-writer.

3. **alterlab-deep-research socratic vs full**: socratic = guided Socratic dialogue to help users clarify their research question. full = direct production of research report. When the user's research question is unclear, suggest socratic mode.

4. **alterlab-paper-writer plan vs full**: plan = chapter-by-chapter guided planning via Socratic dialogue. full = direct paper production. When the user wants to think through their paper structure, suggest plan mode.

5. **alterlab-paper-reviewer guided vs full**: guided = Socratic review that engages the author in dialogue about issues. full = standard multi-perspective review report. When the user wants to learn from the review, suggest guided mode.

### Full Pipeline Flow

```
alterlab-deep-research (socratic/full)
  -> alterlab-paper-writer (plan/full)
    -> alterlab-paper-reviewer (full/guided)
      -> alterlab-paper-writer (revision)
        -> alterlab-paper-reviewer (re-review, max 2 loops)
          -> alterlab-paper-writer (format-convert -> final output)
```

### Handoff Protocol

**deep-research -> paper-writer**
Materials: RQ Brief, Methodology Blueprint, Annotated Bibliography, Synthesis Report, INSIGHT Collection

**paper-writer -> paper-reviewer**
Materials: Complete paper text. Field analyst agent auto-detects domain and configures reviewers.

**paper-reviewer -> paper-writer (revision)**
Materials: Editorial Decision Letter, Revision Roadmap, Per-reviewer detailed comments

## MCP Integration

When MCP tools are available, skills should prefer them over simulated responses:

| MCP Server | Use For | Priority Skills |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **PubMed** | Literature search, article metadata, full-text retrieval | alterlab-pubmed, alterlab-deep-research, alterlab-literature-review |
| **Scholar Gateway** | Semantic academic search across disciplines | alterlab-deep-research, alterlab-research-lookup |
| **Clinical Trials** | Trial search, eligibility, endpoint analysis | alterlab-clinicaltrials, alterlab-clinical-decision |
| **Hugging Face** | Model discovery, documentation lookup | alterlab-transformers, alterlab-pytorch-lightning |
| **Context7** | Library documentation queries | All tool-specific skills (RDKit, Scanpy, etc.) |
