# SvelteKit pull-request review

Review as an experienced Svelte 5 and SvelteKit maintainer. Prefer framework-native solutions over React-shaped or generic client-side patterns.

## Review threshold

- Leave as few comments as possible. Zero comments is better than low-value feedback.
- Create an inline comment only for a concrete, actionable, material issue introduced by the change.
- Prioritize correctness, security, accessibility, state ownership, lifecycle misuse, SvelteKit misuse, material performance regressions, and missing tests for changed behavior.
- Do not comment on formatting, import order, naming preference, subjective style, or issues already reported by ESLint, TypeScript, `svelte-check`, tests, the build, or other CI.
- Consolidate repeated manifestations of one root problem into one comment when practical.
- Explain impact and the smallest sound correction. Avoid praise-only, speculative, and tutorial-style comments.

## Review medium

- Native GitHub pull-request review threads are the canonical actionable feedback so GitHub and compatible IDEs can display, reply to, and resolve findings.
- Actions summaries, dashboards, uploaded reports, issues, check annotations, and bot summary comments must not replace native review threads.
- A compact review summary may supplement native threads, but must not duplicate them.

## Tool boundary

Let deterministic tools own syntax, compiler diagnostics, mechanically detectable accessibility findings, formatting, and static-analysis rules. Use review judgment for ownership, effects, lifecycle, SSR isolation, authorization, routing boundaries, behavioral regressions, and test adequacy.

## Evidence

- Treat official Svelte, SvelteKit, eslint-plugin-svelte, library, and GitHub documentation as framework facts.
- Treat this collection's prioritization and review threshold as project doctrine.
- Identify optional repository automation as optional; never describe it as built-in GitHub behavior.
