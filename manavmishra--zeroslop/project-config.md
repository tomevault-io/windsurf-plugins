# Development coordination

`AGENTS.md` remains the canonical repository contract. Preserve its runtime privacy, distribution, validation, versioning, and release requirements. These instructions add development housekeeping; they do not put Asana access into the packaged skill or change how the skill processes a user's writing.

## Track authorized development automatically

When the user authorizes implementation, a fix, tests, refactoring, documentation, or release work for Zero Slop, the coordinator must invoke a bounded **Asana housekeeping subagent** to maintain the corresponding delivery record. The user should be able to request the work without managing cards. If the harness cannot create subagents, the coordinator performs the same role in a separate bounded pass and states that honestly.

Questions, investigation, status, and review-only requests are read-only unless the user explicitly asks to record or update them. A status-only session must not flush pending writes. These instructions run during active authorized sessions; they install no skill, daemon, scheduler, or Asana Rule.

Use the approved `delivery-coordinator` skill when available, and give independent
candidate reviews to `delivery-reviewer` in a separate run. The housekeeping role
below remains required if those skills are unavailable. Do not ask the user to
maintain cards. Skill installation is separate from authentication and scheduling.

## Resolve the record and use only free features

- Prefer the authorized Asana connector and existing private local configuration. Resolve the exact **Zero Slop — Delivery** project and its workspace. If the target is ambiguous, ask one concise question before any mutation.
- If the connector is unavailable, the housekeeping agent may use already-authorized Chrome UI access. It must not extract browser credentials, cookies, tokens, or passwords or create a new account connection without authority.
- Use only ordinary projects, tasks, subtasks, sections, descriptions, comments, links, and List/Board views. Do not use paid Rules, custom fields, native dependencies, AI Teammates, or trial-only features. Do not change billing, invite bot accounts, or add seats.
- Match a task by an existing task URL or stable packet ID first; then inspect the repository, scope, and active work before creating anything. A similar title is not sufficient proof of a match. Reuse the existing record, including work tracked earlier in the session.
- Resolve the accountable human from the existing task or authorized user context. Record agents by role and actual run ID in the description; do not represent them as human reviewers or seats.

## One writer and evidence-based progress

The coordinator delegates all board mutations to one housekeeping writer at a time. Implementation and review workers return evidence to it. Asana ownership is advisory, not an atomic lease; reconcile a stalled worker before reassignment and preserve unrelated or unfinished changes.

Use **Intake, Ready, Active, Review, Release, Done, Blocked**. Record the outcome, repository, permitted scope, human owner, executor/run, base and candidate revisions, prerequisite links, acceptance checks, budget, and next action. Start with one active parent, up to three disjoint workers, 30 minutes total per packet and at most two attempts. Child work shares the parent's budget. Written limits are not runtime enforcement.

Update at meaningful checkpoints: scope ready, execution started, review ready, a material blocker, an authorized release, and verified completion. Avoid repetitive heartbeat comments. Read back every write. After a timeout, inspect actual state before retrying so an uncertain create or comment does not produce duplicates.

Review evidence must identify the actual reviewer and reviewed revision; the executor cannot approve its own output. Tracking does not authorize merging, publishing, deployment, destructive actions, or extra spending. Preserve valid existing authorization within its scope and request only missing authority. A merge that triggers production is a release action.

Mark Done and complete the task only after accepted work and any authorized release are verified. Attach the diff/PR, current checks, independent review, release/deploy receipt, and relevant public version or health evidence. For work requiring no release, explicitly record why and retain acceptance evidence. Failed, skipped, or unverified publication is not completion. Repository release pipelines remain authoritative.

## Per-work ADLC audit trail

For every authorized work packet, preserve a chronological checkpoint log from
intake through verified delivery or a documented blocker. Record the request and
applicable authority, scope and decision rationale, named agent runs and handoffs,
base and candidate revisions, checks with outcomes, independent review, release
target and receipt, and closure basis. Preserve failed and skipped attempts.
