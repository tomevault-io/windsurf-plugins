# Isaac Sim MCP Rules

# General Rules
- Before executing any code, always check if the scene is properly initialized by calling get_scene_info()
- When working with robots, try using create_robot() first before using execute_script()
- If execute_script() fails due to communication error, retry up to 3 times at most
- For any creation of robot, call create_physics_scene() first
- Always print the formatted code into chat to confirm before execution

# Physics Rules
- If the scene is empty, create a physics scene with create_physics_scene()
- For physics simulation, avoid using simulation_context to run simulations in the main thread
- Use the World class with async methods for initializing physics and running simulations
- When needed, use my_world.play() followed by multiple step_async() calls to wait for physics to stabilize

# Robot Creation Rules
- Before creating a robot, verify availability of connection with get_scene_info()
- Available robot types: "franka", "jetbot", "carter", "g1", "go1"
- Position robots using their appropriate parameters
- For custom robot configurations, use execute_script() only when create_robot() is insufficient

# Physics Scene Rules
- Objects should include 'type' and 'position' at minimum
- Object format example: {"path": "/World/Cube", "type": "Cube", "size": 20, "position": [0, 100, 0]}
- Default gravity is [0, 0, -981.0] (cm/s^2)
- Set floor=True to create a default ground plane

# Script Execution Rules
- Use World class instead of SimulationContext when possible
- Initialize physics before trying to control any articulations
- When controlling robots, make sure to step the physics at least once before interaction
- For robot joint control, first initialize the articulation, then get the controller
