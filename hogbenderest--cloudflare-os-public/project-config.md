This project is building a platform for "vibe coded" personal applications and AI agents that run inside a strong sandbox.

The following files are commonly important to reference:

* packages/workshop-shared/node_modules/capnweb/README.md: Explains how to use Cap'n Web RPC, which is used extensively for client-server communications.
* packages/workshop-shared/src/api.ts: Defines the RPC API used between the frontend and backend.

The project structure is:

* packages/workshop-frontend: The Gadgets Workshop UI.
    * This is a pure single-page app, running entirely client-side.
    * It speaks to the backend using an RPC API over a persistent WebSocket connection.
    * Uses React, Kumo UI (https://kumo-ui.com/api/component-registry), Phosphor icons, and Vite.
* packages/workshop-backend: The Gadgets Workshop server.
    * Runs on Cloudflare Workers.
    * This is the **kernel**: it defines the architecture and is held to a higher bar than UI/gatekeeper code. Reviewers read *every line* of `workshop-backend` and of API changes in `workshop-shared`, so keep diffs here small and elegant. Concretely: doc-comment **every** exported member of the `workshop-shared` public API (types, consts, and functions — not just interfaces); never introduce a hand-written interface that mirrors an RPC interface plus an `as unknown as` cast (derive from the real type instead, or rethink the design); and prefer reusing existing mechanisms over adding parallel ones. Capability-based security note: a resource becomes "ambient" (auto-injected) only by user/admin configuration — a gatekeeper must never assert its own ambience. When a change to this package is large, split it by concern into separate PRs (and at minimum group commits so `workshop-backend`/`workshop-shared` can be reviewed apart from UI), since fewer kernel lines = easier review.
    * `format-blueprints/` holds the **output format** blueprints the deployment ships with, committed as data: a `<name>.gadget` archive plus a `<name>.json` sidecar giving its `blueprintId`, prose, and `output` presentation. `scripts/build-format-blueprints.mjs` globs that directory (override with `FORMAT_BLUEPRINTS_DIR`, which lets a fork ship its own set without touching this submodule) into the gitignored `src/generated/format-blueprints.ts`, so `build` and `test` both run the generator first (it rewrites the module only when the content changes, so the repeat invocations don't invalidate the downstream task cache). Replace one with `pnpm import:format-blueprint <export.gadget> <blueprintId>`, or add one with `pnpm import:format-blueprint <export.gadget> --new <name>`; never edit a `blueprintId` after deploy, since the install and promotion are keyed on it and a rename orphans the old entry. See `format-blueprints/README.md`.
* packages/workshop-shared: Shared API definitions between client and server.
    * This defines the application's RPC interface.
    * The RPC protocol is Cap'n Web, which has similar semantics to Cloudflare's Worker-to-Worker RPC system, while being able to run in a browser over WebSocket. Read the readme for details.
* packages/configurator-ui: Type-only component helpers used by optional gatekeeper resource configurator UI modules.
    * Gatekeeper configurator UI modules are compiled by `scripts/build-gatekeeper-configurator.ts` as part of package builds.
* packages/gatekeeper-*: Gatekeeper workers for external service integrations.
    * Each gatekeeper runs as a separate Cloudflare Worker.
    * Gatekeepers handle OAuth flows and provide sandboxed access to external APIs.
