# Apify Actors Development Guide

Important: Before you begin, fill in the `generatedBy` property in the meta section of `.actor/actor.json`. Replace it with the model you're currently using. This helps Apify monitor and improve AGENTS.md for specific LLM models.

## What are Apify Actors?

- Actors are serverless programs that run in the cloud. They're inspired by the UNIX philosophy - programs that do one thing well and can be easily combined to build complex systems.
- Actors are programs packaged as Docker images that run in isolated containers

## Core Concepts

- Accept well-defined JSON input
- Perform isolated tasks (web scraping, automation, data processing)
- Produce structured JSON output to datasets and/or store data in key-value stores
- Can run from seconds to hours or even indefinitely
- Persist state and can be restarted

## Do

- accept well-defined JSON input and produce structured JSON output
- use Apify SDK (`apify`) for code running ON Apify platform
- validate input early with proper error handling and fail gracefully
- use CheerioCrawler for static HTML content (10x faster than browsers)
- use PlaywrightCrawler only for JavaScript-heavy sites and dynamic content
- use router pattern (createCheerioRouter/createPlaywrightRouter) for complex crawls
- implement retry strategies with exponential backoff for failed requests
- use proper concurrency settings (HTTP: 10-50, Browser: 1-5)
- set sensible defaults in `.actor/input_schema.json` for all optional fields
- set up output schema in `.actor/output_schema.json`
- clean and validate data before pushing to dataset
- use semantic CSS selectors and fallback strategies for missing elements
- respect robots.txt, ToS, and implement rate limiting with delays
- check which tools (cheerio/playwright/crawlee) are installed before applying guidance

## Don't

- do not rely on `Dataset.getInfo()` for final counts on Cloud platform
- do not use browser crawlers when HTTP/Cheerio works (massive performance gains with HTTP)
- do not hard code values that should be in input schema or environment variables
- do not skip input validation or error handling
- do not overload servers - use appropriate concurrency and delays
- do not scrape prohibited content or ignore Terms of Service
- do not store personal/sensitive data unless explicitly permitted
- do not use deprecated options like `requestHandlerTimeoutMillis` on CheerioCrawler (v3.x)
- do not use `additionalHttpHeaders` - use `preNavigationHooks` instead

## Commands

```bash
# Local development
apify run                              # Run Actor locally

# Authentication & deployment
apify login                            # Authenticate account
apify push                             # Deploy to Apify platform

# Help
apify help                             # List all commands
```

## Safety and Permissions

Allowed without prompt:

- read files with `Actor.getValue()`
- push data with `Actor.pushData()`
- set values with `Actor.setValue()`
- enqueue requests to RequestQueue
- run locally with `apify run`

Ask first:

- npm/pip package installations
- apify push (deployment to cloud)
- proxy configuration changes (requires paid plan)
- Dockerfile changes affecting builds
- deleting datasets or key-value stores

## Actor Input Schema

The input schema defines the input parameters for an Actor. It's a JSON object comprising various field types supported by the Apify platform.

### Structure

```json
{
    "title": "<INPUT-SCHEMA-TITLE>",
    "type": "object",
    "schemaVersion": 1,
    "properties": {
        /* define input fields here */
    },
    "required": []
}
```

### Example

```json
{
    "title": "E-commerce Product Scraper Input",
    "type": "object",
    "schemaVersion": 1,
    "properties": {
        "startUrls": {
            "title": "Start URLs",
            "type": "array",
            "description": "URLs to start scraping from (category pages or product pages)",
            "editor": "requestListSources",
            "default": [{ "url": "https://example.com/category" }],
            "prefill": [{ "url": "https://example.com/category" }]
        },
        "followVariants": {
            "title": "Follow Product Variants",
            "type": "boolean",
            "description": "Whether to scrape product variants (different colors, sizes)",
            "default": true
        },
        "maxRequestsPerCrawl": {
            "title": "Max Requests per Crawl",
            "type": "integer",
