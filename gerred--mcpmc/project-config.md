## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: JSON-RPC Warning

If you find yourself implementing JSON-RPC directly (e.g., writing JSON messages, handling protocol-level details, or dealing with stdio), STOP! You are going in the wrong direction. The MCP framework handles all protocol details. Your job is to:

1. Implement the actual Minecraft/Mineflayer functionality
2. Use the provided bot methods and APIs
3. Let the framework handle all communication

Never:

- Write JSON-RPC messages directly
- Handle stdio yourself
- Implement protocol-level error codes
- Create custom notification systems

## Overview

This project uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to bridge interactions between a Minecraft bot (powered by Mineflayer) and an LLM-based client.

The essential flow is:

1. The server starts up ("MinecraftServer") and connects to a Minecraft server automatically (via the Mineflayer bot).
2. The MCP server is exposed through standard JSON-RPC over stdio.
3. MCP "tools" correspond to actionable commands in Minecraft (e.g., "dig_area", "navigate_to", etc.).
4. MCP "resources" correspond to read-only data from Minecraft (e.g., "minecraft://inventory").

When an MCP client issues requests, the server routes these to either:
• The "toolHandler" (for effectful actions such as "dig_block")  
• The "resourceHandler" (for returning game state like position, health, etc.)

## MCP Types and Imports

When working with MCP types:

1. Import types from the correct SDK paths:
   - Transport: "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/shared/transport.js"
   - JSONRPCMessage and other core types: "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js"
2. Always check for optional fields using type guards (e.g., 'id' in message)
3. Follow existing implementations in example servers when unsure
4. Never modify working type imports - MCP has specific paths that must be used

## Progress Callbacks

For long-running operations like navigation and digging:

1. Use progress callbacks to report status to MCP clients
2. Include a progressToken in \_meta for tracking
3. Send notifications via "tool/progress" with:
   - token: unique identifier
   - progress: 0-100 percentage
   - status: "in_progress" or "complete"
   - message: human-readable progress

## API Compatibility and Alternatives

When working with Mineflayer's API:

1. Always check the actual API implementation before assuming method availability
2. When encountering type/compatibility issues:
   - Look for alternative methods in the API (e.g., moveSlotItem instead of click)
   - Consider type casting with 'unknown' when necessary (e.g., `as unknown as Furnace`)
   - Add proper type annotations to parameters to avoid implicit any
3. For container operations:
   - Prefer high-level methods like moveSlotItem over low-level ones
   - Always handle cleanup (close containers) in finally blocks
   - Cast specialized containers (like Furnace) appropriately
4. Error handling:
   - Wrap all API calls in try/catch blocks
   - Use wrapError for consistent error reporting
   - Include specific error messages that help diagnose issues

## File Layout

- src/types/minecraft.ts  
  Type definitions for core Minecraft interfaces (Position, Block, Entity, etc.). Also includes the "MinecraftBot" interface, specifying the methods the bot should implement (like "digArea", "followPlayer", "attackEntity", etc.).

- src/core/bot.ts  
  Contains the main "MineflayerBot" class, an implementation of "MinecraftBot" using a real Mineflayer bot with pathfinding, digging, etc.

- src/handlers/tools.ts  
  Implements "ToolHandler" functions that receive tool requests and execute them against the MinecraftBot methods (e.g., "handleDigArea").

- src/handlers/resources.ts  
  Implements "ResourceHandler" for read-only data fetches (position, inventory, weather, etc.).

- src/core/server.ts (and src/server.ts in some setups)  
  Main MCP server that sets up request handlers, ties in the "MineflayerBot" instance, and starts listening for JSON-RPC calls over stdio.

- src/**tests**/\*  
  Contains Jest tests and "MockMinecraftBot" (a simplified implementation of "MinecraftBot" for testing).

## Tools and Technologies

- Model Context Protocol - an API for clients and servers to expose tools, resources, and prompts.
- Mineflayer
- Prismarine

## Code

- Write modern TypeScript against 2024 standards and expectations. Cleanly use async/await where possible.
- Use bun for CLI commands

## Error Handling

- All errors MUST be properly formatted as JSON-RPC responses over stdio
- Never throw errors directly as this will crash MCP clients
- Use the ToolResponse interface with isError: true for error cases
- Ensure all error messages are properly stringified JSON objects

## Logging Rules

- DO NOT use console.log, console.error, or any other console methods for logging
- All communication MUST be through JSON-RPC responses over stdio
- For error conditions, use proper JSON-RPC error response format
- For debug/info messages, include them in the response data structure
- Status updates should be sent as proper JSON-RPC notifications
