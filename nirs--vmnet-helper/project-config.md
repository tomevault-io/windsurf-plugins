# Project Rules

## Before making code changes

- Discuss the design with the user
- Show example changes to make sure we are in the right direction
- If the user request is not clear, ask for more details
- List possible alternatives to make the change

## Making code changes

- Do the minimal change needed, no extra code that is not needed right now
- Keep changes small to make human review easy and avoid mistakes
- Update documentation if needed
- Use proper punctuation in comments (end sentences with periods)
- Avoid unrelated changes (spelling, whitespace, etc.)
- Run `black` after modifying Python code to maintain consistent formatting

## Building

- Use `./build.sh build` to build a release tarball
- Use `meson compile -C build/{arch}` for quick build for current architecture
- Never use direct `clang` commands that would create `.o` or `.d` files in the source directory

## Running tests

- Run `pytest` to verify all tests pass
- Running specific tests (e.g., `pytest -k test_name`) is fine for quick local verification

## File organization

- Keep files focused - separate files for different concerns
- All files need SPDX license headers - check existing files for the format

## Error handling

- Check existing code for error handling conventions

## Fact checking

- Verify facts before commenting — do not suggest names, links, handles,
  versions, APIs, or command line options without checking that they exist.

## Git workflow

- NEVER commit directly to main branch.
- NEVER push to GitHub without user review.
- Keep commits small and focused.
- For unrelated changes, create a new branch from main.
- Avoid complicated git operations. The user can rebase later.

## Commit messages

When the user wants to commit changes, suggest a commit message.

The main purpose is to explain why the change was made - what are we trying to do.

Content guidelines:
- Explain how the change affects the user - what is the new or modified behavior
- If the change affects performance, include measurements and description of how we measured
- If the change modifies the output, include example output with and without the change
- If the change introduces new logs, show example logs including the changed or new logs
- If several alternatives were considered, explain why we chose the particular solution
- Discuss the negative effects of the change if any
- If the change includes new APIs, describe the new APIs and how they are used
- Avoid describing details that are best seen in the diff

Example formatting:
- Use "Example:" header on its own line
- Blank line after the header
- Indent commands and output with 4 spaces
- Use "%" for command prompt
- Use backslash for command line continuation
- Wrap long log lines instead of using backslash

Example:

    % ./example server -v --operation-mode shared \
          --start-address 192.168.100.1
    ...
    DEBUG [main] starting interface mode 'shared' start-address '192.168.100.1'
        end-address '192.168.100.15' subnet-mask '255.255.255.240'
