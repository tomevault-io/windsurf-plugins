# AGENTS.md — for AI coding agents working in this repo

AudioBard converts public-domain books into multi-voice audiobooks with a
local LLM and TTS, then optionally generates a "radio play" scene version
and narration track. This file covers the rules agents must not violate.

## Verification gate (run before every PR)

CI runs exactly this; reproduce it locally:

```bash
ruff check src tests tools
mypy src/audiobard
pytest --cov=audiobard --cov-fail-under=90 -m "not integration"
python tools/guards.py
```

## Hard rules

- **Never edit a versioned prompt in place** (`src/audiobard/llm/prompts.py`,
  `PROMPT_V*`). Add a new version and switch the default. Any prompt or
  parser change requires benchmark output with no regression
  (`audiobard benchmark --llm ollama --model qwen2.5:7b`) — see
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **`tools/guards.py` is a contract, not lint.** Its allowlists
  (`REQUIRED_IGNORE_RULES`, `ALLOWED_IGNORE_NEGATIONS`,
  `ALLOWED_DATA_BOOK_FILES`, `SECRET_EXEMPT_PATHS`) are reviewed by hand.
  Do not add entries silently; changes to the guards and the files they
  protect belong in the same PR.
- **No secrets in code.** Keys come from `.env` (gitignored) or the
  environment. Never commit a literal key; never paste one into an issue
  or chat.
- **`data/books/` is for public-domain samples only.** Never commit
  copyrighted books, user uploads, or generated audio (`*.mp3`, `*.m4b`).
- **One change per PR.** Personal fork config (your AGENTS.md, local
  scripts) never enters a PR.

## Current state (2026-08)

All phases (1–5 including Desktop GUI) are complete and production-ready:
- `src/audiobard/` — all modules implemented (parser, llm, tts, audio, pipeline, persistence, cli, config, api, nim_client)
- `gui/` & `src-tauri/` — native Desktop GUI (Tauri v2 + Vue 3) with BYOK (NVIDIA NIM, OpenRouter, Gemini, Ollama) and i18n multi-language support (Spanish 🇪🇸 / English 🇺🇸)
- 254 unit tests passing across all source files
- CI gates green: ruff, mypy, guards, tests on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12, vue-tsc & vite build
- The project is in **production desktop release mode** — contributions welcome
