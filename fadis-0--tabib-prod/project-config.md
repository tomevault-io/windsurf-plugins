# GEMINI.md - AI-Powered Project Documentation

This file provides a comprehensive overview of the Tabibi project, designed to be understood and utilized by AI assistants and human developers alike.

## Project Overview

Tabibi is a web application designed to help users find and book appointments with doctors. The application is built using a modern frontend stack, including:

*   **Framework:** React
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Routing:** React Router
*   **Backend:** Supabase (for database and authentication)

The application features a clean, component-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns. Key features include user authentication, a doctor search page, and a doctor dashboard.

## Building and Running

To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variable, as mentioned in the `README.md`:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

4.  **Build for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command bundles the application for production into the `dist` directory.

5.  **Preview the Production Build:**
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
    This command serves the production build locally for previewing.

## Development Conventions

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The project is structured around reusable React components, located in the `src/components` directory.
*   **Functional Components and Hooks:** The codebase extensively uses functional components with React Hooks for state management and side effects.
*   **TypeScript:** The project is written in TypeScript, providing static typing for better code quality and maintainability.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Pages are lazy-loaded using `React.lazy` to improve initial load times.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for styling, with custom styles defined in `src/index.css`.
*   **Routing:** `react-router-dom` is used for client-side routing.
*   **State Management:** A combination of component state (`useState`, `useReducer`) and context (`AuthContext`, `LoaderProvider`) is used for state management.
*   **Backend Interaction:** The application interacts with a Supabase backend for data storage and user authentication, with the Supabase client initialized in `src/supabaseClient.ts`.

-- Insert the specialties from your enum
