## BOOT BLOCK
— # Last updated: 2026-03-31 | Boot Block: CC-HMCP-000001D


### PROJECT IDENTITY
- App: **Home MCP Compliance Lab** — home lab platform for building, operating, and auditing MCP servers with compliance visibility and structured controls
- Repo: home-mcp-lab
- Prompt schema: CC-HMCP-XXXXXX (tracks all Claude Code work for traceability)


## SYSTEM PURPOSE

MCP servers expose tools that Claude can call — file reads, database queries, API calls, shell commands. Without visibility, those actions are a black box. This lab builds the infrastructure to see, log, classify, and reason about tool usage across multiple projects and agents.

Three goals:
1. **Operational visibility** — know what tools are being called, by which agents, on which servers, and with what outcomes
2. **Compliance controls** — define and enforce boundaries around what MCP servers should and should not do
3. **Structured experimentation** — a safe environment to build and test MCP server configurations before broader deployment

### PLATFORM VS PROJECT MODEL
- The Home MCP Compliance Lab is a control plane and observability platform
- Software projects (e.g., ERATE Workbench, future demos) live in separate repositories
- Projects integrate via a defined registration contract (to be implemented)
- Compliance logic, audit logging, and control enforcement live in the platform layer
- Projects must not embed compliance logic directly into business code

## REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
- Repo: /home/drake/projects/home-mcp-lab
- project identity: Home MCP Compliance Lab

### ARCHITECTURAL LAWS (immutable — do not violate without explicit architect approval)

#### Platform Governance
- The platform owns compliance logic, audit schemas, and control patterns
- Projects remain independent and must not embed platform governance logic
- All work must be traceable via CC-HMCP-XXXXXX prompt IDs

#### Workflow Discipline
- Feature branches only — never commit directly to main
- PR process is mandatory: branch → push → PR → review → merge → delete branch → sync main
- All significant changes must produce durable artifacts (docs, schemas, or code)

#### Observability & Compliance
- All simulated workflows must be observable through structured events
- Visibility gaps must be explicitly documented (VG-HMCP-*)
- Control patterns must be explicitly defined (CTRL-HMCP-*)
- No silent or untraceable actions in platform-managed workflows

#### Platform Design
- Platform is project-agnostic — no project-specific constraints allowed
- Platform must support multiple independent project integrations
- Compliance controls must minimize developer friction (do not create bypass incentives)

#### Evolution
- Architectural decisions must be recorded (ADR-HMCP-*)
- Platform behavior must be reconstructible from repository artifacts (not memory)

### PROJECT INTEGRATION CONCEPT

A project plugs into the platform by:
1. **Declaring tools** — registering what the MCP server exposes and their risk classification
2. **Emitting audit events** — logging tool calls using the platform's audit event schema
3. **Implementing controls** — applying platform control patterns appropriate to the server's risk profile
4. **Reporting visibility gaps** — documenting what the server does that cannot currently be observed

The integration contract (schema + interface) is defined in this repo. Projects reference it externally.
