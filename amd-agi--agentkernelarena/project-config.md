# Configure agents and models in AgentKernelArena

AgentKernelArena evaluates one agent per run. The agent is selected by the
`agent.template` field in the chosen run configuration. This topic lists the
supported agents, explains how models and providers are configured, and
describes how to use the arena for A/B testing.

## Supported agents

The following agents are available.

| `agent.template` | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `cursor` | Cursor Agent CLI |
| `claude_code` | Anthropic Claude Code CLI |
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI |
| `forge` | KernelForge through the shared v2 task interface |
| `geak` | GEAK Workflow engine through the shared v2 task interface |
| `task_validator` | Task quality validator; does not optimize kernels (see [Validate tasks](task-validator.md)) |

The [registry](../../src/module_registration.py) maps the legacy names
`geak_v4` to `geak` and `forge_operator2flydsl` to `forge`, with the same
configuration and post-processing. There is no separate v1 task integration. See the [GEAK](../../agents/geak/README.md) and
[Forge](../../agents/forge/README.md) guides for runtime requirements. Registry
availability alone does not establish GPU or model qualification.

Select one in a run configuration:

```yaml
agent:
  template: claude_code
```

Each agent lives under `agents/<agent_name>/` and is registered into a shared
registry, so the framework loads only the agent you select.

The supported identifiers are defined by `AgentType` in
`src/module_registration.py`. Retired templates and compatibility notes are
listed in the [release notes](../reference/release-notes.md#unreleased).

The Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex integrations reuse their host CLI login
state. Specialized integrations have additional setup and configuration under
their respective `agents/<agent_name>/` directories.

`quality_loop` is intentionally not an `agent.template`. It is a repository-level
task maintenance workflow that invokes Codex roles across the tasks selected by its
run config and publishes at most one draft PR. It never creates GitHub issues. See
[Audit and harden tasks](quality-loop.md).

## Models, providers, and agent settings

The selected integration controls model, provider, authentication, effort,
timeout, and iteration settings. Its defaults live in its CLI and
`agents/<agent_name>/agent_config.yaml`; supported fields in the run config's
`agent` mapping override those defaults. See
[CLI run-level overrides](../reference/agent-model-defaults.md#run-level-overrides)
and each specialized integration's guide for supported fields and precedence.
These settings do not belong in task configurations.

For Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex, authenticate with the host CLI. A normal run
preflights only the selected CLI. When the config selects one of these
first-class integrations (or `task_validator`), select the run configuration
first and check its CLI/backend:

```bash
CONFIG_PATH=example_configs/quickstart_claude_mi300.yaml
make docker-check-agents CONFIG="$CONFIG_PATH"
```

Use `AGENTS=<comma-separated names>` for an explicit subset or `AGENTS=all` for
all three first-class CLIs and login states. GEAK and its v2 aliases resolve to
Claude Code for this check; normal runs also check the pinned GEAK engine and
SDK. Other specialized integrations have their own checks; their README files
document dependencies and provider configuration.

`make vllm` starts an OpenAI-compatible local endpoint on port `30001`, but it
does not automatically reconfigure an agent. Point the selected integration at
that endpoint using the integration's own provider/base-URL mechanism.

## A/B testing and ablation studies

AgentKernelArena is designed to test changes to agent behavior: a model, Model
Context Protocol (MCP) server, skill, prompt strategy, tool integration, memory
strategy, or policy.

Run the same task set twice, once with the capability enabled and once
without, then compare the standardized scores:

```bash
CONFIG_PATH=example_configs/quickstart_claude_mi300.yaml

# Baseline
make docker-run CONFIG="$CONFIG_PATH" RUN_ARGS="--run-suffix baseline"

# With the new capability enabled in the agent configuration
make docker-run CONFIG="$CONFIG_PATH" RUN_ARGS="--run-suffix with_capability"
```

Both runs land in the same workspace directory with distinct run names, so the
[visualization dashboard](visualization.md) can show them side-by-side. Hold
every non-treatment factor constant—including tasks, hardware, environment, and
scoring—and repeat matched trials when agent behavior is stochastic. The
observed deltas estimate the effect of the capability under test.

You can also generate a text comparison directly:

```bash
python3 src/tools/compare_runs.py \
  workspace_MI300_claude_code/run_<timestamp>_baseline \
  workspace_MI300_claude_code/run_<timestamp>_with_capability
```

The resulting `task_result.yaml` files expose compilation, correctness, timing,
speedup, and score fields that an external RL system can consume as reward
signals. AgentKernelArena does not itself update a policy.

## Add a new agent

To integrate a custom agent:

1. Create `agents/<your_agent>/` with a
   `launch_agent(eval_config, task_config_dir, workspace)` function decorated
   with `@register_agent("<your_agent>")`.
