## WritBase Task Context

WritBase tasks track work items for this project.

### Task Tracking (mandatory when doing task-related work)
- When working on tasks or features, follow the `writbase:worker` skill patterns.
- When starting non-trivial work (code changes, features, bug fixes), search for an existing
  task and update it, or create one. Skip for quick questions or exploratory reads.
- Update task status on completion (`done` with commit SHA) or when blocked.
- Before ending a session where WritBase tools were used, run `/extract-tasks`.
