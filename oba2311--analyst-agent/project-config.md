# Project Organization and Documentation Guidelines

## Documentation Best Practices

1. All feature documentation should be placed in the docs/ folder
2. Each feature requires a markdown file with:
   - Detailed description
   - Purpose statement
   - Mermaid diagram using theme colors (dark gray and light purple)
3. Use consistent naming convention: feature_name.md
4. Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
5. Include usage examples where appropriate
6. Reference architecture diagrams when explaining component interactions

## Code Structure

1. Maintain the established project hierarchy:
   - src/agents/ - Agent definitions and core logic
   - src/tools/ - Individual analysis tools
   - src/config/ - Configuration settings
   - src/utils/ - Utility functions
   - tests/ - Unit and integration tests
2. Each tool should be implemented in a separate file with a consistent structure
3. Follow single responsibility principle - one class/module for one functionality
4. Keep class and file names descriptive and consistent with their purpose

## Code Style

1. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
2. Use Black for code formatting
3. Add docstrings to all functions and classes following Google style
4. Use type hints wherever possible
5. Maximum line length: 88 characters
6. Use descriptive variable and function names

## Testing Guidelines

1. Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
2. Place tests in the tests/ directory with a matching structure to src/
3. Name test files with test\_\*.py pattern
4. Aim for at least 80% test coverage for core functionality
5. Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate

## Versioning and Changelog

1. Update CHANGELOG.md for all notable changes following Keep a Changelog format
2. Adhere to Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
3. Document all changes before submitting pull requests
4. Group changes by Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security

## Git Workflow

1. Create feature branches from main for all new work
2. Use descriptive branch names (feature/add-sentiment-analysis, fix/query-parsing)
3. Write clear commit messages that explain what and why
4. Keep pull requests focused on single features or fixes
5. Reference issue numbers in commits and PRs

## Dependencies Management

1. Add all new dependencies to requirements.txt
2. Specify version numbers for all dependencies
3. Document purpose of new dependencies in comments
4. Consider compatibility with existing dependencies

## Security Best Practices

1. Never commit API keys or credentials
2. Use .env.example for showing which environment variables are needed
3. Validate and sanitize all user inputs
4. Follow principle of least privilege in code design

## Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation for all changes
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
4. Ensure all tests pass locally before submitting
5. Use the PR template and fill out all sections
