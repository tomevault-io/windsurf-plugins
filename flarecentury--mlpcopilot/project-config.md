# MLP Copilot Development Context

This repository is the canonical `mlpcopilot` MLP-focused product line, adapted from the general-purpose `mlpcopilot` project for MLP-focused agent runtime work.

## Current Goal

Build a practical vertical agent system for machine-learning-potential work, especially dataset validation, checkpoint validation, validation planning, artifact tracking, and human-approved decisions.

The intended implementation order is:

1. First modify the inherited runtime into the MLP Copilot host runtime.
2. Then build MLP MCP servers and MLP skills as plugins.

## Product Split

There are three active PRD files:

- `prd/MLPCOPILOT_RUNTIME_PRD.md`
  - Defines the mlpcopilot runtime modifications only.
  - Covers runtime profile, TUI, Telegram-only gateway, ApprovalManager, ArtifactIndex, workspace schema, MCP/skill plugin loading, and OpenAI-compatible API.
  - Must not include MLP scientific algorithms.

- `prd/MLPCOPILOT_MCP_SKILL_PRD.md`
  - Defines the plugin layer.
  - Covers MLP MCP servers and MLP skills.
  - Includes dataset validation MCP, model MCP, validation MCP, job MCP, report MCP, and skills such as `mlp-dataset-validation`.

- `prd/MLPCOPILOT_TUI_CODEX_INTERACTION_PRD.md`
  - Defines the TUI interaction layer.
  - Covers Codex-style slash commands, overlays, jobs, model switching, approvals, and layout behavior.

## Architecture Boundary

Keep the boundary strict:

- MLP Copilot runtime is the host.
- MCP servers are executable scientific tool plugins.
- Skills are method/process plugins.

Do not put dataset validation algorithms, checkpoint inference, benchmark execution, or validation methodology directly into mlpcopilot core.

MLP Copilot core should provide:

- agent loop
- session and memory
- plugin loading
- MCP client integration
- TUI
- Telegram gateway
- OpenAI-compatible API
- ApprovalManager
- ArtifactIndex
- workspace initialization

MCP/Skill should provide:

- dataset validation
- model inference and checkpoint metrics
- validation plan execution
- job monitoring
- report rendering
- MLP-specific workflows and guidance

## Important Product Decisions

- Do not make the agent look more impressive by adding unnecessary multi-agent behavior.
- Keep the product requirements focused on runtime, plugins, workflows, and evidence; avoid external narrative goals.
- Do not hard-code a fixed validation gap for one material system.
- The agent should help users generate a project-specific validation plan based on target use case, dataset inventory, checkpoint, reference data, acceptance criteria, and compute budget.
- Human-in-the-loop must be a real blocking approval workflow, not a vague statement.
- Scientific data should move by file path, object id, or artifact reference, not by large pasted coordinate payloads in LLM context.
- Metrics must come from tool artifacts, not from LLM judgment.
- Agent-side built-in tool and MCP tool calls use one runtime approval policy. Exact `tools.approvalAllowlist` entries are the normal bypass; MCP tools must not implement `approval_hint`, `requires_approval`, or `approved=true` approval shims.
- TUI `!<cmd>` is an explicit terminal mode and does not use agent tool approval or exec allowlists.

## Current Implementation Status

As of the current implementation state:

- The runtime PRD, MCP/skill PRD, and TUI interaction PRD remain the product source of truth.
- Runtime work has moved beyond planning and is being ported into the canonical MLP Copilot codebase.
- `runtimeProfile = "mlpcopilot"` is implemented in config/profile policy.
- The MLP workspace initializer is implemented and creates runtime, project, run, artifact, approval, memory, and skill directories.
- Channel/tool whitelisting for the MLP profile is implemented.
- ApprovalManager and decision storage are implemented.
- ArtifactIndex and run manifest support are implemented.
- `mlpcopilot tui` exists as a modular terminal workbench with Chat, Tool Log, Artifacts, Campaign, and Approvals views.
- OpenAI-compatible API approval handlers exist.
- MLP MCP server packages exist for training control, dataset validation, and first-pass model metrics ingestion.
- The training controller MCP currently uses a DP-GEN backend provider and includes read/config/status/log/report tools plus run, stop, and rewind controls; approval is enforced by the runtime when these tools are called through the agent.
- Initial MLP skills exist, including `mlp-active-learning`, `dpgen-machine-writer`, `mlp-initial-dataset-preparation`, `mlp-dataset-validation`, `mlp-validation-planner`, and `mlp-checkpoint-evaluation`; model inference skill packs are not complete yet.
- The old mixed PRD was removed and replaced by the split PRDs under `prd/`.

## Inherited MLPCopilot Facts

MLPCopilot already supports:

- OpenAI-compatible API via `mlpcopilot serve`.
- MCP servers via `stdio`, `sse`, and `streamableHttp`.
- Workspace skills under `skills/`.
- Multiple channels, though the MLP Copilot runtime should default to Telegram only.

Useful existing files:

- `mlpcopilot/api/server.py`
- `mlpcopilot/agent/tools/mcp.py`
- `mlpcopilot/config/schema.py`
- `mlpcopilot/channels/telegram.py`
