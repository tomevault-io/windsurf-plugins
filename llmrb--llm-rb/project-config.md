## Agents
### Introduction

#### Overview

[`LLM::Agent`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html)
is the recommended entry point for most use-cases. It provides a
class-level DSL for defining reusable, preconfigured assistants
with defaults for model, tools, schema, and instructions. Under
the hood it delegates to
[`LLM::Context`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html),
so it has the same runtime surface: message history, streaming,
serialization, compaction, and concurrency.

#### How it works

An agent holds a conversation with a model. You send input with
[`LLM::Agent#talk`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html#talk),
the model responds, and if it requests tools the agent
executes them automatically and feeds the results back. It enables
[a loop guard by default](https://r.uby.dev/llm/deepdive/advanced/guard)
that detects repeated tool-call patterns
and blocks stuck execution. The tool loop can also be bounded with
[`LLM::Agent.tool_budget`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html#tool_budget-class_method)
(see the Tool budget section). Instructions are injected once
unless a system message is already present.

#### Why would I use it?

Agents manage the tool loop for you. They guard against infinite
loops, keep conversation state across turns, and let you define
reusable configurations at the class level. If you need manual
control over the tool loop, use
[`LLM::Context`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html)
directly instead.

#### Notes

Agents support the same concurrency strategies, compaction,
cancellation, and serialization as contexts. The trade-off between
a subclass and a direct instance is only in how the agent is
organized, not in what it can do. Tool loop execution can be
configured with `concurrency: :sequential`, `:thread`, `:async`,
`:fiber`, `:fork`, or `:ractor`.

### Class-based

#### Overview

A subclass of
[`LLM::Agent`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html)
gives you a reusable agent with its own behavior. You define the model, tools, and other
attributes at the class level, and each instance picks them up
as defaults. Attributes can be overridden per-instance, and they
can be plain values, blocks, or Symbols that resolve to methods.
The class becomes a self-contained worker that you can instantiate
and talk to from anywhere.

#### How it works

A subclass declares its defaults with
[`LLM::Agent.set`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html#set-class_method).
Each key is a
class-level accessor: `name`, `description`, `model`, `tools`,
`skills`, `instructions`, `stream`, `tracer`, `concurrency`,
`schema`, `confirm`, `path`, `tool_budget`, `retry_budget`.
Keyword arguments in the constructor override these defaults.

```ruby
class Agent < LLM::Agent
  set model: "deepseek-v4-pro",
      description: "system administration agent",
      tools: [Shell]
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
agent = Agent.new(llm)
agent.talk "Run 'date'"
```

#### Why would I use it?

A subclass is useful when multiple parts of an application need to
call the same agent. The configuration and any helper methods live in one place. Define a
`research!` method that kicks off the agent's work. The subclass
becomes a self-contained worker.

#### Notes

Attributes passed to
[`LLM::Agent.set`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html#set-class_method)
can be plain values, blocks, or
Symbols. A Symbol is evaluated as an instance method on the
subclass, so `tracer: :set_tracer` calls `set_tracer` on the
instance. A block like `stream: -> { $stdout }` is evaluated
when the attribute is first accessed.

Set `path:` on a subclass or instance for automatic filesystem
persistence; the agent restores conversation history from the
file on startup and saves it back after every turn with no
manual
[`LLM::Agent#save`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html#save)/
[`LLM::Agent#restore`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html#restore)
calls. See the
[database deepdive](../fundamentals/database.md) for details.

### Object-based

#### Overview

An
[`LLM::Agent`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html)
instance is the simplest way to get started. You pass a provider and any configuration as keyword
arguments, and the agent runs the tool loop and manages state
just like a subclass would. This is the right choice when you
are prototyping, running a one-off task, or when the agent's
configuration is determined at runtime.

#### How it works

A direct instance takes the same attributes as keyword arguments
to
[`LLM::Agent.new`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html#initialize-instance_method).
The first argument is always the provider.
Everything else is optional. The agent runs the tool loop
and manages state under the hood through a
[`LLM::Context`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html).

```ruby
llm = LLM.deepseek(key: ENV["KEY"])
agent = LLM::Agent.new(llm, stream: $stdout)
agent.talk "Hello world"
```

#### Why would I use it?

A direct instance is the right choice for quick experiments, one-shot
tasks, or when defining a class would be overkill. It is also
the right choice when the agent's configuration is determined at
