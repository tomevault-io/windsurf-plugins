# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository contains the standalone `opencode-bytheway` OpenCode plugin.

It provides the `/btw`, `/btw-merge`, `/btw-end`, `/btw-status`, and `/btw-prompt` workflows for temporary side sessions through a TUI-only plugin.

## Important Files

- `tui.ts`: dual-runtime package entrypoint. It lazily selects the V1 or V2 implementation.
- `v1.tsx`: V1 TUI plugin implementation.
- `v2.ts`: V2 TUI plugin implementation.
- `tui.test.tsx`: Bun test coverage for the TUI behavior.
- `scripts/build.ts`: builds the dual entrypoint and lazy runtime chunks into `dist/`.
- `dist/tui.js`: built artifact published by the package. Rebuild it after changing either runtime.

## Runtime Invariants

- Keep the runtime plugin id aligned with the published package name: `opencode-bytheway`.
- Keep the session storage key aligned too: `opencode-bytheway.active`.
- If either value changes in `protocol.js`, `v1.tsx`, or `v2.ts`, update tests and rebuild `dist/tui.js` in the same change.
- Avoid changing slash command names unless the user explicitly asks for a behavior change.

## Local Development

Use Bun for local work.

```bash
bun install --ignore-scripts
bun run build
bun run test
bun run test:integration
```

Useful extra check before release work:

```bash
npm pack --dry-run
```

## Compatibility Target

When working on this plugin, treat `/home/tim/projects/opencode` as a read-only compatibility target.

Do not edit, patch, build, regenerate, or commit anything in the OpenCode repo unless explicitly instructed. All compatibility fixes must be made in this plugin repo.

Integration tests should run against the target OpenCode binary, optionally via `OPENCODE_BTW_OPENCODE_BIN=/absolute/path/to/opencode`.

## Editing Guidance

- Keep host-specific behavior in `v1.tsx` or `v2.ts`; extract only genuinely shared behavior.
- Do not add compatibility aliases for old plugin ids or state keys unless there is a concrete migration requirement.
- Preserve the existing command behavior around blocked nested `/btw` sessions and cleanup of temporary sessions.
- When changing user-visible copy, update tests if they assert the string.

## Verification Expectations

After code changes:

1. Run `bun run build` if `tui.ts`, `v1.tsx`, or `v2.ts` changed.
2. Run `bun run test` for behavioral changes.
3. Confirm generated `dist/tui.js` reflects any runtime identifier or command changes.

For releases, ensure `CHANGELOG.md` states the OpenCode version the plugin was built against, and copy the same release details into the `README.md` changelog section so npmjs.com displays them.

## Config Notes

Example OpenCode `tui.json[c]` entry:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-bytheway@latest"]
}
```

Example OpenCode V2 `~/.config/opencode/cli.json` entry:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["opencode-bytheway@0.8.1"]
}
```

If OpenCode still reports the old plugin after a rename or rebuild, the user may need to restart or reload plugins so the new module instance is picked up.
