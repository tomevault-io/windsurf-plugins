# Admin Backend Rules

## Read

- `docs/guides/backend.md`
- `docs/guides/permission.md`
- `docs/guides/ai-coding-rules.md`

## Boundaries

- Admin business features live in `apps/admin/src/features/`.
- Shared auth and permission code stays in `crates/auth/`.
- Admin migrations live in `apps/admin/migrations/`.

## Rules

- New features use `mod.rs`, `handler.rs`, `service.rs`, `repo.rs`, and `types.rs`.
- Handlers only handle requests and responses; do not write SQL there.
- Services handle orchestration, validation, and transactions.
- Repos only handle persistence and must not cross feature boundaries.
- Documented read-only aggregation exceptions, currently `features/dashboard/`,
  may omit `repo.rs`; see `docs/guides/backend.md`.
- Use `Require(...)` as the default permission check.
- Do not add compatibility fallbacks or extra abstraction layers.

## Command Source

- Use root `justfile` as the command source of truth.
