# Important commands

- `cargo check` - to compile and check the code
- `cargo test` - run all the tests
- `cargo test SPECIFIC_TEST -- --nocapture` - run one specific test (replace
  SPECIFIC_TEST with the desired test)
- `cargo fmt` - format all the code
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` - check the code for lint errors
- `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` - use clippy to try and automatically fix
  lint errors

# Running one shot mode

If you want to test the one shot mode you should use
commands like: `cargo run -- -- "100 GiB / 10 minutes"` (it's important to have the double escape "-- --").

# General workflow

- Make the changes requested, making sure to always add unit tests for new
  functionality
- When applicable, also run the tool in one-shot mode to make sure it works
- Always make sure there are no regressions in other tests at the end
- Once you are done, make sure to run `cargo fmt` to format all the code properly
- We want to be very careful whenever we have to change existing tests to make
  sure we are no introducing any regressions in behavior, if you are in doubt
  ask the human for verification if you are going to have to change an existing
  test in a non-trivial way

## Important notes

- Mathypad runs in raw mode, so if we ever need to exit it cannot be through
  'std::process::exit(0)' without first reseting raw mode, otherwise it will
  mess up the terminal
- Because Mathypad runs in a TUI, we cannot print text in the UI mode otherwise
  it will not render properly and mess up the TUI
- You cannot run mathypad in TUI mode directly (i.e., 'cargo run' will not work
  unless you are using one-shot mode). So do not try to run it in TUI mode.
  Instead you can rely on the UI snapshot tests

## Testing

Since the main application is a TUI that requires interactive tty, you will not
be able to run it directly. Instead you should rely on the various testing
suites we have for simulating interactions, and multi-line notebooks. We prefer
to havefast unit tests that cover all the various typse of operations, edge
cases, conversions, and behaviors of mathypad. It is important that all tests
cases pass, it is not acceptable to have even one failure. If you are really
stuck trying to get tests to pass, you should ask for human input.

## Code Quality Standards
- Compiler warnings should be treated as errors and fixed, not ignored
- Linter warnings should be treated as errors and fixed, not ignored
- Code should be thoroughly tested with appropriate unit tests
- Follow standard Rust idioms including error handling

## Key Components

### Core Application (`app.rs`)
- Manages the application state including text lines, cursor position, and scroll offset
- Handles variable storage and retrieval
- Implements mode switching between Insert and Normal modes
- Contains the main application logic for text editing operations

### Expression Module (`expression/`)
- **`tokens.rs`**: Defines the token types used in parsing (numbers, operators, functions, etc.)
- **`parser.rs`**: Expression parsing utilities and helper functions
- **`chumsky_parser.rs`**: Main parser implementation using the Chumsky parser combinator library
- **`evaluator.rs`**: Evaluates parsed expressions and performs calculations
- **`tests.rs`**: Comprehensive unit tests for expression parsing and evaluation

### Units Module (`units/`)
- **`types.rs`**: Defines unit types, dimensions, and conversion factors
