# SQL Rules
This rule applies to all SQL files in the project.
## File Pattern
*.sql
## Description
When working with SQL files, we use DuckDB as our database engine. SQL files should be executed using the command `duckdb $DUCKDB_DATABASE -f {file}`.
## Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use SQLFluff for formatting with DuckDB dialect
- Format on save
## Commands
- Run SQL file: duckdb $DUCKDB_DATABASE -f {file}
## Best Practices
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include comments for complex queries
- Use proper indentation for readability
- Follow DuckDB's SQL dialect specifications
