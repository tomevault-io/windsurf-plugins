# Project Instructions

## Branch Policy

**Never push directly to `main`.** All changes must go through a pull request:

0. Always create a branch specific to the change before committing: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `test/`, etc.
1. Push the branch and open a PR — never `git push origin main`.
2. If you find yourself on `main`, create a branch first: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.

## Design Standards

**Any change that touches UI (screens, components, styles) must comply with the design system:**

- Read `docs/design/VISUAL_HIERARCHY_STANDARD.md` before writing or modifying any UI code.
- Check `docs/design/` for any other relevant design documents.
- Use `TYPOGRAPHY` tokens — never hardcode font sizes or weights.
- Use `COLORS` tokens — never hardcode color values.
- Use `SPACING` tokens — never hardcode margin/padding values.
- Weights must stay ≤ 400 (no bold).
- Never use emojis or emoticons in UI text — always use `react-native-vector-icons` instead. Feather is the default; MaterialIcons is allowed only when Feather lacks a suitable icon (e.g. `whatshot` for trending).
- Never use `lucide-react` or any other icon library — only `react-native-vector-icons`.
- Follow the 5-category text hierarchy: TITLE → BODY → SUBTITLE/DESCRIPTION → META.

## Pre-Commit Quality Gates

All quality gates run automatically via Husky on every `git commit`, scoped to the file types you staged:

| Staged file type | Checks that run automatically |
|---|---|
| `.ts` / `.tsx` / `.js` / `.jsx` | eslint (staged only), `tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` |
| `.swift` | swiftlint (staged only), `npm run test:ios` |
| `.kt` / `.kts` | `compileDebugKotlin` (type check), `lintDebug`, `npm run test:android` |

**Requirements:**
- SwiftLint: `brew install swiftlint` (skipped with a warning if not installed)
- Android checks require the Gradle wrapper in `android/`

Before writing new code, ensure tests exist for your changes. If the hook fails, fix the issue and recommit — never skip with `--no-verify`.

## Testing Requirements

Always write **both** unit tests and integration tests for new features and significant changes:

- **Unit tests** (`__tests__/unit/`): Test individual functions, hooks, and store actions in isolation with mocked dependencies.
- **Integration tests** (`__tests__/integration/`): Test how multiple modules work together end-to-end (e.g., service A calls service B which writes to database C). Use mocked native modules but real logic across layers.

Do not consider a feature complete with only unit tests. Integration tests catch wiring bugs, incorrect data flow between layers, and lifecycle issues that unit tests miss.

## Push = Create PR + Address Review

When the user says "push" (or any equivalent like "ship it", "send it", "push this"), follow this full workflow:

### Before pushing
0. Write tests for any new or changed logic if they don't already exist.
1. Run `npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit && npm test` — fix any failures before continuing.
2. Commit all staged changes with a descriptive message.
3. Ensure you are NOT on `main`. If you are, create an appropriately named branch first: `git checkout -b feat/...` or `fix/...` or `chore/...` etc.

### Pushing & PR
4. Push the branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
5. If no PR exists for this branch, create one with `gh pr create`. **Do NOT include "Generated with Codex" or any AI attribution in PR descriptions.**
6. If a PR already exists, update its description to reflect **all commits in the PR** (not just the latest push). Read the full commit history with `git log main..HEAD` and write a coherent description that summarises the entire change set — what it does, why, and how.

### Review loop
7. Wait for Gemini to review the PR (poll with `gh pr checks` and `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews` until a review appears).
8. Pull down review comments: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments` and `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews`.
9. Address every review comment — fix the code, re-run quality gates (lint, tsc, test).
10. Reply to **each** review comment individually using `gh api` (`/pulls/comments/{id}/replies`). Every comment gets its own reply — do not post a single summary comment.
11. Push fixes, update the PR description again to stay coherent across all commits.
12. Report what was changed in response to the review.

## CI Review Loop

The repo has three automated reviewers on every PR. After pushing, loop until all are green:

| Reviewer | What it checks | How to address |
|---|---|---|
| **Gemini Bot** | Code quality, style, logic issues | Read comments via `gh api`, fix code or reply explaining why it's fine, then comment `/gemini review` to trigger a fresh pass |
| **Codecov** | Test coverage thresholds | Add missing tests, ensure new code is covered. Check the Codecov report for uncovered lines |
| **SonarCloud** | Security hotspots, code smells, duplications, bugs | Fix flagged issues — especially security hotspots and duplications. Resolve quality gate failures before merging |

**Workflow:**
1. Push code → wait for all three reviewers to report
2. Pull down Gemini comments, Codecov report, and SonarCloud findings
3. Fix issues: code changes for Gemini/SonarCloud, add tests for Codecov
4. Re-run local quality gates (`npm run lint && npm test && npx tsc --noEmit`)
5. Push fixes, comment `/gemini review` on the PR to re-trigger Gemini
6. Repeat until all three reviewers pass with no blocking issues
