# forty-two-watts — project orientation

Unified Home Energy Management System, written in Go with Lua drivers.
See `docs/archive/rust-go-wasm-migration-plan.md` only if you need the
historical Rust→Go migration context.

## Mental model

**Site sign convention**: positive W = energy flowing INTO the site across
the grid-meter boundary. Grid import (+), PV generation (−), battery
charge (+ as load), battery discharge (−). The driver layer is the ONLY
place sign conversion happens — above it, every layer uses the site
convention. Read `docs/site-convention.md` before touching any power-math
code.

**Lua drivers**: `drivers/*.lua` loaded by `gopher-lua` are the only
driver path. Each driver file implements the lifecycle (`driver_init`,
`driver_poll`, `driver_command`, `driver_default_mode`,
`driver_cleanup`) and talks to hardware through the `host.*` capabilities
exposed by `go/internal/drivers/lua.go`. Drivers are hot-editable on the
Pi and need no build step.

**Clamping discipline**: every clamp must protect against a *quantifiable
risk*. Read `docs/clamping.md` for the seven current clamps and the
saturation-curve feedback-loop bug we shipped then fixed.

**Hardware-stable identity**: every device a driver talks to gets a
`device_id` resolved in priority order — `make:serial` (from
`host.set_make` + `host.set_sn`) > `mac:<arp-resolved>` (for TCP devices
on the same L2) > `ep:<endpoint>` (fallback). Persistent state such as
battery models is keyed on `device_id` internally, so renaming a driver
in YAML or re-adding it doesn't orphan a trained model. See
`go/internal/state/devices.go` and `go/internal/arp/arp.go`.

## Key packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `go/internal/config` | YAML config + validation + atomic save |
| `go/internal/state` | SQLite persistence, tiered history, long-format TS + Parquet rolloff, devices |
| `go/internal/telemetry` | DerStore with Kalman per signal + driver health + WatchdogScan |
| `go/internal/control` | PI + dispatch modes + slew + fuse guard |
| `go/internal/battery` | ARX(1) model + RLS + cascade + saturation curves |
| `go/internal/selftune` | Step-response state machine + fitter |

| `go/internal/api` | HTTP endpoints (Go 1.26+ method mux) |
| `go/internal/configreload` | fsnotify watcher + reload dispatch |
| `go/internal/ha` | Home Assistant MQTT autodiscovery + bridge |
| `go/internal/mqtt` | paho client wrapper implementing drivers.MQTTCap |
| `go/internal/modbus` | simonvetter wrapper implementing drivers.ModbusCap |
| `go/internal/arp` | L2 MAC resolver for device identity (linux/darwin) |
| `go/internal/sunpos` | Physics-only solar zenith/azimuth (Spencer 1971) |
| `go/internal/priceforecast` | Price twin — fills beyond day-ahead publication |
| `go/internal/loadmodel` | Household load twin (bucketed + heating coefficient) |
| `go/internal/pvmodel` | PV twin (RLS over sunpos / cloud prior) |
| `go/internal/mpc` | MPC planner — DP over SoC grid, 48 h horizon |
| `drivers/` | Lua drivers (`ferroamp.lua`, `sungrow.lua`, …) |
| `go/test/e2e` | Full-stack test: sims + main + drivers + HTTP |

## Building & testing

```bash
make test         # unit + integration tests
make e2e          # full-stack end-to-end test
make dev          # start sims + main app locally
make build-arm64  # cross-compile for RPi
make release      # tarballs for deploy
```

Lua drivers need no build step — `drivers/*.lua` ships verbatim with the
release tarball and is loaded on startup.

No CGo anywhere — pure Go + embedded Lua 5.1 (gopher-lua). `go build`
produces a static single-binary distribution.

## Releases (Changesets)

The release pipeline is driven by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
**Every PR with a user-visible change needs a changeset file.** The pattern
is lifted from `umara/u-front` — start there if you need a reference setup.

**Workflow per PR.** From the repo root:

```bash
npx changeset      # interactive: pick bump (patch/minor/major) + summary
```

That writes a `.changeset/<name>.md` file you commit with your change. The
`changeset-check` workflow on the PR enforces presence (or one of the
exempt paths below).

**Bump types.**
- `patch` — bug fix, perf tweak, internal refactor, doc fix that affects
  user-visible content.
- `minor` — new driver, new feature flag, new API endpoint, new UI
  surface, expanded device support.
- `major` — breaking change (config schema rename, removed endpoint,
  removed driver capability, sign-convention change at the boundary).
  Pair with `BREAKING CHANGE:` notes in the changeset body.

**Auto-exempt paths.** If a PR touches only `*.md` / `*.mdx` / `*.txt`,
`docs/`, `.github/`, `.vscode/`, or root dotfiles (`.editorconfig`,
`.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `LICENSE`), the gate auto-passes — no
changeset required. The full allowlist lives in
`.github/workflows/changeset-check.yml`; extend it in the same PR if a
new "obviously doesn't ship to users" path appears.

**Manual escape hatch.** Apply the `no-changeset` label to the PR if the
allowlist doesn't cover your case but the change genuinely doesn't merit
a release entry. Use sparingly — the allowlist exists to make this rare.

**Release flow.**
