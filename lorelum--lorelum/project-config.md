## Project

Lorelum is an engineering-knowledge infrastructure for AI coding agents. It retrieves team "Practices" (discrete engineering guidelines) and injects them into AI context on demand. This repo will hold the core engine, CLI (`lore`), local MCP server, and format spec.

The codebase is **Bun + TypeScript**, organized as a Bun workspace monorepo (`packages/*`). The exact commands are in [Commands](#commands) below; conventions in [Code style](#code-style) and [Testing](#testing).

The companion knowledge-pack repo lives elsewhere (`lorelum/lorelum-packs`). This repo does not contain knowledge-pack content.

## Layout

The source tree is a Bun workspace monorepo (`packages/cli`, `packages/engine`, `packages/format`, `packages/mcp`, `packages/shared`). Repo-root `package.json` declares `workspaces: ["packages/*"]`.

**The product contract to be aware of:**
- **Practice / pack format** — the public schema that packs and users depend on. Changes are high-impact; see CONTRIBUTING.md.
- **Retrieval engine** — performance-sensitive; benchmark before changing.

## Commands

- **Runtime:** Bun ≥ 1.1 (TypeScript support is built in — no separate `tsc`/Node install needed)
- **Install deps:** `bun install`
- **Run a workspace script:** `bun run <script>` (or just `bun <script>`)
- **Test:** `bun test` (uses `bun:test`)
- **Lint:** `bun run lint` (oxlint)
- **Format:** `bun run fmt` (oxfmt)
- **Typecheck:** `bun run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`)
- **Build single binary:** `bun build --compile`

Precise scripts live in each `packages/*/package.json`; the above is what the root delegates to. Keep CI green on whatever it runs.

## Code style

TypeScript is the language; Bun runs it. These rules apply from day one.

- **Strict mode.** `tsconfig.json` has `strict: true`. No `any` without justification; if unavoidable, mark `// @ts-expect-error: <reason>` (reason required).
- **Naming.** TypeScript community norms: `PascalCase` for types/interfaces/classes, `camelCase` for functions/variables. Apply uniformly.

- **Small, composable modules.** Prefer pure functions. Avoid deep class hierarchies unless modeling genuine state.
- **Typed errors over bare strings.** Throw specific error types; let the CLI/MCP boundary translate them into user-facing messages. Never throw a bare string.
- **No silent failures.** A function that can fail should signal it explicitly (typed error, Result, or similar) — not return `null` and hope.
- **Naming:** consistent with the chosen language's prevailing conventions. Whatever they are, apply them uniformly.

### File organization

Keep the tree navigable and each file independently understandable. These are principles, not a line-count budget — judge by whether a file can be understood on its own.

- **One responsibility per file.** A file owns one schema entity, one piece of closely-related logic, or one group of constants. If you are editing a file and the change is unrelated to its existing contents, that work probably belongs in a sibling file.
- **Group by function into subdirectories.** Don't accumulate files at the `src/` root. A package like `format` separates `schema/`, `validate/`, `frontmatter/`, `fixtures/` so each concern has a home. Cross-cutting helpers live in a `common.ts` within the relevant directory.
- **`index.ts` is a barrel, nothing more.** It re-exports the directory's public API. Business logic does not live in `index.ts` — put it in a named file and re-export it.
- **File name matches what it exports.** `practice.ts` exports the Practice schema and `Practice` type; `cycle.ts` exports cycle detection. A reader should predict the file's contents from its name.
- **Co-locate tests.** `*.test.ts` sits next to the source it covers, mirroring the same split — `schema/practice.test.ts` tests `schema/practice.ts`.

## Testing

- New code ships with tests. No exceptions for the format/parser and retrieval layers.
- Test framework is `bun:test`. Test files are `*.test.ts`, colocated next to the source they cover. The format/parser and retrieval layers must have tests for every new behavior.
- **Mock filesystem and network** — never hit the real registry in unit tests.
- When fixing a bug, add a regression test that fails before the fix and passes after.

## Git workflow

- **Never commit directly to `main`.** Every change goes through a PR.
- **One issue per PR.** Keep PRs focused and reviewable. If a change spans multiple issues, split it.
- **Conventional Commits** (`feat(cli): ...`, `fix(engine): ...`, `spec(format): ...`, `docs: ...`).
- **Every PR links to an issue** (`Closes #123`).
- **Behavioral changes need design discussion first** — open an issue or Discussion before implementing changes to the Practice format, retrieval model, or CLI surface.

## Boundaries

**Do not modify these without explicit maintainer approval:**
