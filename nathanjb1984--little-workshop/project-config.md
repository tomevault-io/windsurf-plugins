Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file

- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. *(File recreated after Vite scaffold reset.)*

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements *(React horror maze starring Lucy, monster whispers, timer/button/wall mechanics.)*
  - Ask for project type, language, and frameworks if not specified. Skip if already provided.

- [x] Scaffold the Project *(Ran `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts` and installed deps.)*
  - Ensure that the previous step has been marked as completed.
  - Call project setup tool with projectType parameter.
  - Run scaffolding command to create project files and folders.
  - Use '.' as the working directory.
  - If no appropriate projectType is available, search documentation using available tools.
  - Otherwise, create the project structure manually using available file creation tools.

- [x] Customize the Project *(Implemented Lucy maze gameplay, whisper audio, timer UI.)*
  - Verify that all previous steps have been completed successfully and you have marked the step as completed.
  - Develop a plan to modify codebase according to user requirements.
  - Apply modifications using appropriate tools and user-provided references.
  - Skip this step for "Hello World" projects.

- [x] Install Required Extensions *(No additional VS Code extensions requested.)*
  - ONLY install extensions mentioned in the get_project_setup_info. Skip this step otherwise and mark as completed.

- [x] Compile the Project *(Ran `npm run build` successfully.)*
  - Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
  - Install any missing dependencies.
  - Run diagnostics and resolve any issues.
  - Check for markdown files in project folder for relevant instructions on how to do this.

- [x] Create and Run Task *(Not required for simple npm scripts.)*
  - Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
  - Check https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks to determine if the project needs a task. If so, use the create_and_run_task to create and launch a task based on package.json, README.md, and project structure.
  - Skip this step otherwise.

- [ ] Launch the Project
  - Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
  - Prompt user for debug mode, launch only if confirmed.

- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete
  - Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
  - Verify that README.md and the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exist and contain current project information.
  - Clean up the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory by removing all HTML comments.

## Execution Guidelines
**Progress tracking**
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

**Communication rules**
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

**Development rules**
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Code—do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

**Folder creation rules**
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.
- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in VS Code.

**Extension installation rules**
- Only install extensions specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. Do not install any other extensions.

**Project content rules**
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
