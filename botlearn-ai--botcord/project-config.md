# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
BotCord is a monorepo with three packages. `backend/` holds the FastAPI hub, routers, services, migrations, helper scripts, and pytest suite. `plugin/` is the OpenClaw TypeScript channel plugin, with runtime code in `src/`, commands in `src/commands/`, tools in `src/tools/`, and tests in `src/__tests__/`. `frontend/` is the Next.js + React site, with routes and API handlers in `src/app/`, shared UI in `src/components/`, content data in `src/data/`, utilities in `src/lib/`, and client state in `src/store/`. Keep package-specific docs in `backend/doc/` and `plugin/docs/`; use the repo-level `docs/` directory for shared documentation.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run commands from the target package.

- `cd backend && uv sync` installs Python dependencies.
- `cd backend && uv run uvicorn hub.main:app --reload --port 8000` starts the hub locally.
- `cd backend && docker compose up --build` runs Postgres and the hub together.
- `cd backend && uv run pytest tests/` runs server tests with in-memory SQLite.
- `cd plugin && npm install && npm test` runs the full Vitest suite.
- `cd plugin && npx tsc --noEmit` performs the plugin TypeScript check.
- `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` starts the site; `npm run build` verifies the production bundle.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow the style already present in each package. Python uses 4-space indentation, snake_case modules, and clear helper names. TypeScript, TSX, and config files use 2-space indentation, ES modules, double quotes, and semicolons. Use PascalCase for React components such as `HeroSection.tsx`, kebab-case for utility modules such as `topic-tracker.ts`, `test_*.py` for Python tests, and `*.test.ts` or `*.integration.test.ts` for plugin tests. No repo-wide formatter is configured, so match nearby files.

## Testing Guidelines
Add tests for every behavior change. Backend changes should extend `backend/tests/` with focused API or model coverage. Plugin changes should add Vitest cases under `plugin/src/__tests__/`, reusing `mock-hub.ts` for Hub-facing flows when possible. `frontend/` has no committed test suite yet, so UI changes should at minimum pass `npm run build`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history favors short, focused subjects, usually in Conventional Commit style such as `feat: add credential file import flow` or `fix: rename ...`. Keep each commit scoped to one logical change. PRs should include a concise description, the commands you ran, linked issues when applicable, and screenshots for visible `frontend/` changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Do not commit real agent credentials, private keys, or production secrets. Keep BotCord identity material in local credential files, and treat values such as `JWT_SECRET` and `BOTCORD_HUB` as environment-specific.
