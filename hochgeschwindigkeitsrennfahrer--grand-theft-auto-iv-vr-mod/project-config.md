# Agent Contract — gtaiv-dxvk-vr

Standalone project. Do not assume any other repo.

## Prompt to start a chat

```text
Read AGENTS.md and docs/CURRENT-STATE.md and docs/HOME_CURSOR.md and docs/VR_STRATEGY.md.
Project: gtaiv-dxvk-vr — GTA IV CE VR: Stock-DXVK 3.0.2 d3d9.dll + ASI Glue + OpenVR (SteamVR), Win32, Reverb G2.
Flat with DXVK 3.0.2 as d3d9.dll ok. No OpenXR for v0. Do not use IronWolf-tiw-rel as the base.
I am not a programmer — give concrete click/command steps.
Mono-Submit milestone reached. Next: Stability / Stereo / Camera (one thing per session).
```

## Non-negotiable

1. **Win32 / x86** for everything that loads into `GTAIV.exe`.  
2. Singleplayer / offline during development.  
3. Do not distribute Rockstar assets or closed HL2VR/closed-VR binaries.  
4. **OpenVR (SteamVR) is the compositor** — first milestone without OpenXR.  
5. L4D2VR / IronWolf / sd805 are **references**; GTA needs its own glue.  
6. Do not sell a foreign game `d3d9.dll` 1:1 as "VR for GTA".  
7. One behavior change per test build; logs in a file next to the EXE.  
8. After headset tests, update `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`.  
9. Instructions for the user in **English**, concrete and short.

## Definition of Done (first milestone)

Stock-DXVK **3.0.2** `d3d9.dll` flat ok + ASI Glue: SteamVR/OpenVR, **Mono** eye image via `ID3D9VkInterop*` → `IVRCompositor::Submit`.
