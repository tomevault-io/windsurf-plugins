# Spawn

Spawn is a matrix of **agents x clouds**. Every script provisions a cloud server, installs an agent, injects OpenRouter credentials, and drops the user into an interactive session.

## The Matrix

`manifest.json` is the source of truth. It tracks:
- **agents** — AI agents and self-hosted AI tools (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex CLI, ...)
- **clouds** — cloud providers to run them on (Sprite, Hetzner, ...)
- **matrix** — which `cloud/agent` combinations are `"implemented"` vs `"missing"`

## File Structure

### Architecture

All cloud provisioning and agent setup logic lives in TypeScript under `packages/cli/src/`. Agent scripts (`sh/{cloud}/{agent}.sh`) are thin bash wrappers that bootstrap bun and invoke the CLI.

**`sh/shared/github-auth.sh`** — Standalone GitHub CLI installer + OAuth login helper. Used by `packages/cli/src/shared/agent-setup.ts` to set up `gh` on remote VMs.

**`sh/shared/key-request.sh`** — API key provisioning helpers sourced by the QA harness (`qa.sh`) for loading cloud credentials from `~/.config/spawn/{cloud}.json`.

## After Each Change

1. `bash -n {file}` syntax check on all modified scripts
2. `cd packages/cli && bunx @biomejs/biome check src/` — **must pass with zero errors** (lint + format) on all modified TypeScript
3. Update `manifest.json` matrix status to `"implemented"`
4. Update the cloud's `sh/{cloud}/README.md` with usage instructions
5. Commit with a descriptive message

## Filing Issues for Discovered Problems

When you encounter bugs, stale references, broken functionality, or architectural issues that are **outside the scope of your current task**, file a GitHub issue immediately rather than ignoring them or trying to fix everything at once:

```bash
gh issue create --repo OpenRouterLabs/spawn --title "bug: <brief description>" --body "<details>"
```

Examples of when to file:
- Dead code or stale references to files/functions that no longer exist
- Broken features (e.g., `spawn delete` references non-existent shell scripts)
- Security concerns that need separate review
- Architectural debt that would be too large to fix in the current PR

**Do NOT silently ignore problems.** If you find something weird and won't fix it now, file an issue so it's tracked.
