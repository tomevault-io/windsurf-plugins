1. prefer one class per file.
2. use Google C++ coding styles.
3. make classes immutable as much as possible.
4. follow guidelines of effective modern c++.


Name methods (casing, etc) like "is_valid", "stream_text"

Lean on auto. Let the compiler deduce obvious types and keep code DRY. 

Use nullptr, never 0 or NULL. A unique keyword prevents overload ambiguities and makes pointer intent explicit. 

Express ownership with smart-pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, std::weak_ptr). Raw pointers say nothing about lifetime. 

Move more, copy less. Pass/return by value when cheap-to-move; use std::move to convey transfer of resources. 

Mark intent with keywords (const, constexpr, noexcept, override, delete). They document guarantees and enable optimisations. 

Prefer brace initialisation. It prevents narrowing, works with std::initializer_list, and unifies syntax. 

Capture carefully in lambdas; avoid default capture ([=], [&]). Explicit captures beat accidental lifetime bugs. 

Think tasks, not threads. Launch work with std::async, std::future, or std::packaged_task; join or detach thoughtfully. 

Use std::atomic for inter-thread data, not volatile. Atomics give ordering guarantees; volatile is for hardware registers. 

Emplace instead of insert / push_back. Construct elements in place to avoid extra moves or copies.
