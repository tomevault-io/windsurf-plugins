# Repository instructions

This repository supports a beginner-friendly webinar showing designers how to build from Figma with a coding agent.

## Source of truth

Use the supplied Figma file and the selected Figma node as the source of truth for structure, content, states, spacing, typography, colour, and other visual decisions.

## Implementation rules

- Use semantic HTML and CSS only.
- Do not add JavaScript, a framework, a build tool, or third-party dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Place component styles in `src/components`.
- Place design tokens as CSS custom properties in `src/tokens`.
- Prefer native HTML behaviour and accessibility semantics. For the accordion, use `details` and `summary`.
- Keep the implementation easy for designers with no coding experience to follow during a live session.
- Do not add unrelated files, features, tooling, or abstractions.
