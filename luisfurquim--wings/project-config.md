# WINGS authoring

This project builds UI as **Go compiled to WASM** with the WINGS framework. The
canonical, always-current authoring guide lives in `AGENTS.md` at the repository
root — read it and follow it. Its full contents:

@AGENTS.md

Two non-negotiable gotchas it covers, repeated here so they're never missed:

1. **Binding names in attributes must be snake_case.** The browser lowercases
   attribute names, so a camelCase binding name (`?isLoading`, `*myItems`,
   `&myValue`) becomes a silent no-op — `go run ./cmd/build <target>` fails the
   build on it.
2. **Handlers needing `obj` can't be built in `InitData`** (`obj` isn't ready);
   put `wings.TriggerHandler(nil)` there and set the real handler in `Render`.

For deeper, area-specific guidance (components, i18n, skins, widgets, build,
and security), this repo also ships the `wings-authoring` Claude Code plugin —
see the README "AI-Assisted Development" section.
