# Aztec Bridge UI — Project Rules

## Design & UX — read first

**For ANY UI / UX / frontend / design work, read these two docs FIRST, before writing a component:**

1. Parent brand principles — `assets/brand/brand-principles.md` (universal, app-agnostic)
2. Shield product SOP — `products/shield/design-sop.md` (Shield-specific bindings + overrides)

Both live in [`holonym-foundation/internal-docs`](https://github.com/holonym-foundation/internal-docs). Follow the inheritance chain top to bottom: **parent brand → design system ([`human-tech-design-system`](https://github.com/holonym-foundation/human-tech-design-system)) → Storybook (synced components) → product SOP.** A product SOP may tighten a universal rule but never loosen brand hygiene or contrast; if a mock and the SOP disagree, the SOP wins until it's updated.

- **Before shipping / deploy:** run `cd frontend && pnpm design-lint` (the harness in `frontend/scripts/design-lint.mjs`). It is **advisory today, to become blocking** once the tree is clean — see the SOP §11. Every product build should include a design-linting step.
- **If a rule is unclear, wrong, or you find yourself fighting it:** don't silently deviate. **PROPOSE an update to the SOP or RECORD the conflict** as a comment on [#1769](https://github.com/holonym-foundation/internal-docs/issues/1769) (or a new issue). The SOP is a living contract, not a frozen doc.

## Project Overview

This is the **Aztec Token Bridge** — a full-stack system for bridging ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum L1 to Aztec L2 with optional atomic fuel swaps (swap a portion of bridged tokens into FeeJuice for L2 gas).

### Architecture

```
frontend/                    — Next.js app (bridge UI)
packages/sdk/                — @human.tech/clean.sdk (core bridge logic, env-agnostic)
bridge-script/               — Deployment & testing scripts (TypeScript + viem)
  ├── index-testnet-compliant.ts — Main deployment + test script (deploy, seed, test all flows)
  ├── seed-pools.ts          — Standalone pool seeding script (direct USDC/FJ pool primary)
  ├── test-fuel-swap.ts      — Standalone fuel swap E2E test
  ├── recover-liquidity.ts   — Recover ETH/tokens from old pool positions
  ├── constants/tokens.ts    — Token configurations (USDC, USDT, DAI, HUMN, GOAT, WBTC, WETH)
  └── deployments/           — Persisted deployment state (JSON)
l1-contracts/                — Solidity contracts (Foundry)
  ├── src/UniswapFuelSwap.sol    — Multi-hop V4 swap: ERC20 → ETH → FeeJuice (also supports a WETH intermediate)
  ├── src/SwapBridgeRouter.sol   — Permit2-based atomic bridge + fuel swap
  ├── src/TokenPortal.sol        — L1↔L2 token bridging
  └── script/SeedUniswapPools.s.sol — PoolSeeder contract (idempotent pool init + liquidity)
```

### Key Flows

- **Bridge only**: User deposits ERC-20 via TokenPortal → claims on L2
- **Bridge + Fuel**: User deposits via SwapBridgeRouter → splits into token deposit + fuel swap → claims both on L2 using FeeJuice for gas
- **Fuel swap route** (mainnet): `USDC → [USDC/ETH native pool] → ETH → [ETH/AZTEC pool] → FeeJuice`. The intermediate is **native ETH** (`address(0)`), which nets inside V4 flash accounting. The contract still supports a legacy WETH intermediate (`USDC → WETH → unwrap → ETH → AZTEC`) for pools that pair against WETH.

### Tech Stack

- **L1**: Solidity, Uniswap V4, Permit2, Foundry
- **L2**: Aztec (Noir contracts), `@aztec/*` packages
- **Scripts**: TypeScript, viem, `@aztec/ethereum`
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React
- **Network**: Aztec Alpha (settles on Ethereum mainnet), Aztec v4.2.0-aztecnr-rc.2

## Debugging & Code Trust Rules

**NEVER trust ANY existing code when debugging — not the Solidity contracts, not the Aztec L2 contracts, not the scripts, not the frontend.** Always re-read and audit every layer from scratch. This project has L1 Solidity contracts, L2 Aztec/Noir contracts, TypeScript deployment scripts, and test files that must stay in sync. When something fails:

1. **Debug in source-of-truth order: Smart Contracts → Database → APIs → Scripts → Frontend** — Always start from the lowest, most authoritative layer. Don't assume scripts, wrappers, or helper code are correct. Read the actual implementation (Solidity contracts, DB schemas, API endpoints) before forming hypotheses. Work upward only after verifying each layer.

2. **Never trust L1 contracts (Solidity) as correct** — Always re-read `l1-contracts/src/` when debugging. Check for: incorrect settlement logic, missing edge cases in multi-hop swaps, wrong token ordering assumptions, unsafe ETH handling, reentrancy vectors, missing access controls. The contracts may have bugs too — don't assume they're correct just because they compiled.
