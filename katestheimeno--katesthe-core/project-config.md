# Primary/Replica DB Routing Rule

## Core behavior (matches `config/db_router.py`)
- **Writes** always go to **primary** (`default`) via `db_for_write`.
- **Reads** go to a **healthy replica** by default (`db_for_read`), when `DB_ROUTING_ENABLED` and `REPLICA_DATABASE_ALIASES` are configured.
- Reads go to **primary** when either:
  - router hint is used: `hints={"primary": True}`
  - request/thread is pinned to primary: `force_primary_for_request()`

## Default: let the router pick (replica for reads)
Use the default behavior when:
- The query is **read-only** and does **not** depend on a write performed earlier in the same request/task code path.
- You’re implementing list/detail GET endpoints, searches, and general `exists()/count()` checks.

Avoid forcing replica or primary explicitly for ordinary reads.

## After writes: prevent stale reads (route the follow-up read to primary)
Use **one** of these patterns when you need read-after-write consistency:

### Preferred: `with read_from_primary(): ...` (scoped)
- After `save()`, `create()`, `update()`, `delete()`, or any operation where replication lag could affect a subsequent read.
- Around any `refresh_from_db()`.
- Around any re-fetch used to build the response.

Example:
```python
from config.db_utils import read_from_primary

obj = MyModel.objects.create(...)

with read_from_primary():
    obj = MyModel.objects.get(pk=obj.pk)  # guarantees it sees the write
```

### Request-wide pin: `force_primary_for_request()` (use sparingly)
- When an endpoint writes and then performs multiple reads/serializations that must all see the new state.
- Prefer the scoped context manager when possible to reduce replica load.
- For normal HTTP requests, `DBConsistencyMiddleware` clears this automatically at request start/end.

Example:
```python
from config.db_router import force_primary_for_request

force_primary_for_request()
# serialize response using freshly written state
```

## Background tasks
If a Celery task runs **immediately after** a write (triggered post-commit or right after calling `.delay()`), treat it as read-after-write:
- Wrap the initial entity fetch and any `refresh_from_db()`/follow-up reads in `with read_from_primary(): ...`.

## Don’t hardcode replica aliases
- Do **not** use `.using("replica_0")` / `.using("replica_1")`.
- For primary, use `read_from_primary()` or `.using("default")` only when you truly need to pin an already-constructed queryset.

If you need to pin an existing queryset to primary:
```python
from config.db_utils import queryset_on_primary

qs = queryset_on_primary(MyModel.objects.filter(...))
```

## Evaluate inside the correct scope
Be careful not to evaluate querysets before entering `read_from_primary()`:
- Build querysets outside is usually fine.
- **Evaluate** (`list(qs)`, iteration, `.get()`, `.first()`, `refresh_from_db()`, etc.) inside the context when you need primary consistency.

## Migrations
- Migrations should run on primary only.
- In `RunPython` migrations, prefer explicit `.using("default")` for clarity/future-proofing.
