# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Apex Log MCP Server - a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Apex Log Analysis. It provides AI agents with tools to analyze Salesforce Apex debug logs for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the TypeScript project
pnpm run build

# Development with watch mode
pnpm run dev

# Run the server standalone
pnpm start
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **src/index.ts**: Main MCP server implementation (`ApexLogServer` class)
  - Implements 4 MCP tools: `analyze_apex_log_performance`, `get_apex_log_summary`, `find_performance_bottlenecks`, `execute_anonymous`
  - Uses stdio transport for communication
  - Handles file validation, log parsing, analysis, and anonymous Apex execution

- **src/ApexLogParser.ts**: Complex log parsing engine (33k+ tokens)
  - Exports `parse()` function and `ApexLogParser` class
  - Handles Apex debug log format parsing into structured data
  - Tracks governor limits, performance metrics, and log issues

### Key Data Structures

- `ApexLog`: Root log structure with duration, governor limits, namespaces
- `LogLine`: Individual log entries with hierarchical relationships
- `SlowMethod`: Performance analysis result with timing and resource usage
- `GovernorLimits`: Salesforce platform limits tracking

### MCP Integration

This server is designed to integrate with the Apex Log Analyzer VS Code extension:

- Registered automatically by the extension
- Communicates via MCP protocol over stdio
- Provides structured JSON responses for AI analysis

## TypeScript Configuration

- Target: ES2022
- Module: ESNext with Node resolution
- Strict mode enabled
- Output to `dist/` directory
- Source maps and declarations generated

## File Structure

```
src/
  index.ts          # MCP server implementation
  ApexLogParser.ts  # Log parsing engine
dist/               # Compiled JavaScript output
```

## Tools

The server provides four main capabilities:

1. **Performance Analysis**: Identifies slowest methods with detailed metrics
2. **Log Summary**: High-level execution statistics and governor limit usage
3. **Bottleneck Detection**: Analyzes CPU, database, and method performance patterns
4. **Execute Anonymous**: Executes anonymous Apex code snippets, saves the debug log to a file, and returns a summary with the file path

Log analysis tools (1-3) accept absolute file paths to `.log` files and return structured JSON for AI processing.
Anonymous execution (4) accepts multi-line strings containing Apex, saves the resulting debug log to a local file (default: `.apex-log-mcp/` in the project root), and returns a summary with the file path. The `outputDir` parameter overrides the default save location. It supports an optional `debugLevel` parameter to configure trace flag log levels per category or set all categories at once. The `execute_anonymous` tool is disabled by default and only registered when `--allowed-orgs` is configured. The allowlist supports special tokens (`ALLOW_ALL_ORGS`, `DEFAULT_TARGET_ORG`, `DEFAULT_TARGET_DEV_HUB`) as well as org usernames/aliases. Aliases are resolved to usernames for matching. The response includes the org alias alongside the username when available.
