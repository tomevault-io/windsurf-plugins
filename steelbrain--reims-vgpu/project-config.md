## For Claude

- **CRITICAL — never persist anything outside this workspace.** Do not write to your global
  memory store (`~/.claude/...`) or any location outside this repo. Memory kept there does not
  travel with the project and **will be lost** to the next session, agent, or machine. Durable
  operating rules belong in `AGENTS.md`; other durable project information belongs in the relevant
  tracked doc or source comment.
