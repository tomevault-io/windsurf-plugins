# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

claude-resume is a Go-based TUI (Terminal User Interface) application that allows users to browse and resume recent Claude Code sessions. It provides a sophisticated split-screen interface where users can browse projects, view sessions, and preview conversation messages in real-time before resuming.

## Architecture

The application follows the Go standard project layout with a clean separation of concerns:

### Directory Structure
- **cmd/claude-resume/** - Application entry point and CLI commands
- **internal/sessions/** - DuckDB queries and data operations for fetching projects and sessions
- **internal/tui/** - Bubble Tea-based terminal UI implementation
- **internal/db/** - Database initialization and connection management
- **pkg/models/** - Shared data models (Project, Session)

### Data Flow

1. DuckDB queries read from `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` files
2. Projects are fetched first with aggregated statistics (session count, last activity)
3. Sessions are lazily loaded only when a project is selected
4. Messages are lazily loaded when navigating sessions (first 10 + last 10 messages)
5. When a session is selected, the app changes to the project directory and executes `claude --resume <session-id>`

### Key Components

- **cmd/claude-resume/main.go**: CLI commands using Cobra (show, debug-session)
- **internal/sessions/sessions.go**: Core data fetching logic with SQL queries
- **internal/tui/tui.go**: Interactive terminal UI with viewport support
- **internal/db/duckdb.go**: DuckDB initialization with JSON extension
- **pkg/models/models.go**: Shared Project and Session structs

### Key SQL Patterns

The app uses three main query patterns:

- **Project aggregation**: Groups all events by `cwd` (project path) to get session counts and last activity
- **Session details**: Filters events by project path and aggregates by sessionId
- **Message preview**: Uses SQL window functions (ROW_NUMBER() OVER) to efficiently select first 10 and last 10 messages, with support for all message types (user, assistant, tool calls)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Build the application
make build

# Build and run immediately
make run

# Install to Go's bin directory
make install

# Run tests
make test

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Update dependencies
go mod tidy
```

## Testing and Debugging

When working on the TUI:
- The app uses viewport components for scrolling - be aware that color codes need special handling
- Split-screen mode is triggered when entering session view with left/right viewports
- Test with projects that have many sessions to verify scrolling behavior
- Initial render issue fixed by calling `updateViewport()` on first WindowSizeMsg

For SQL query debugging:
- DuckDB requires explicit installation of the json extension (`INSTALL json; LOAD json;`)
- Session IDs must be cast to VARCHAR to avoid binary data issues
- Use `COALESCE(cwd, 'Unknown')` to handle null project paths
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER() OVER) used for efficient message selection

For message parsing:
- Messages can be string or array format in JSON
- Tool calls have nested structure with `type`, `name`, and `input` fields
- System reminders and interruption messages are filtered out

## Important Implementation Details

### Terminal Handling
- Uses `tea.WithAltScreen()` for clean terminal restoration
- Split-screen mode with separate left/right viewports in session view
- Viewports are dynamically resized on window resize events
- Uses `lipgloss.JoinHorizontal()` for proper split-screen layout
- Initial render fix: calls `updateViewport()` when window size is first received

### Session ID Handling
- Session IDs from JSONL files may contain binary data
- Always use `CAST(sessionId AS VARCHAR)` in SQL queries
- The app changes to the project directory before executing `claude --resume`

### Message Display Features
- **Smart Truncation**: All messages truncated to 50 characters for readability
- **Role-Based Formatting**: Different colors for User (blue), Assistant (pink), and tool messages
- **Tool Call Visualization**: 
  - Tool calls shown with 🔧 icon and truncated parameters
  - Tool results shown with ↩ icon
- **Omission Indicator**: Shows "... (N messages omitted) ..." when middle messages are skipped
- **Efficient Loading**: Messages loaded lazily when navigating sessions

### Performance Considerations
- Sessions are loaded on-demand when a project is selected (not all at once)
- Messages are loaded lazily when navigating sessions in split-screen view
- SQL window functions used for efficient first/last message selection
- Queries limit results to prevent overwhelming the UI (100 projects, 100 sessions per project)
- Singleton DuckDB connection pattern prevents connection overhead

## IMPORTANT: Git Commit Policy

⚠️ **NEVER EXECUTE GIT COMMIT COMMANDS UNLESS EXPLICITLY REQUESTED** ⚠️

Claude Code MUST NOT run any git commit commands automatically or proactively. Git commits should only be created when the user explicitly asks for them using phrases like:
- "commit these changes"
- "create a commit"
- "git commit"
