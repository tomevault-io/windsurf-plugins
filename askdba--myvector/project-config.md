# MyVector agent workflow

Follow `tasks/PLANNING.md` in this repository.

**Always:**

- Use plan mode for non-trivial work (3+ steps or architecture); stop and re-plan if derailed.
- Verify before marking done: tests, logs, or equivalent proof; ask if a staff engineer would ship it.
- Prefer simplicity and root-cause fixes over hacks.
- On user correction: append the pattern to `tasks/lessons.md`.

**Tasks:**

- Use `tasks/todo.md` for checkable plans and a short review when done.

**Optional:**

- Delegate exploration/research to subagents when it keeps context clean.
