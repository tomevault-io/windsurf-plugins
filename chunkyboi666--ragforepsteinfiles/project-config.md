description: Backend architecture and constraints; source of truth is docs/BACKEND_PLAN.md
---


# Source of truth

- **At session start:** Read **`docs/BACKEND_PLAN.md`** (full plan: DB design, ingestion, retrieval, API, build order) and **`docs/PROGRESS.md`** (current phase status). This rule summarizes constraints; the docs are the source of truth.
- **When work advances:** Update **`docs/PROGRESS.md`** whenever a phase moves to "In progress" or "Complete", or when notes need to change. Keep it in sync with actual progress.

---

# Stack (non-negotiable)

- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI only.
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector) only. No SQLite in the codebase (no `sqlite3`, no `.db` reads, no SQLite-backed endpoints). No Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, FAISS.
- **Config:** Environment variables only. No hardcoded credentials, URLs, or keys. Use `config.py` for env parsing.

---

# Backend folder structure (match the plan)

```
backend/
├── ingestion/   — migrate_sqlite.py, chunk_documents.py, embed_chunks.py, create_indexes.py
├── retrieval/  — query_expansion.py, summary_search.py, chunk_search.py, triple_lookup.py, context_builder.py
├── api/        — main.py, chat.py, documents.py, search.py, stats.py
├── config.py
└── requirements.txt
```

Do not add parallel layouts (e.g. `src/`, `services/`) unless the plan changes.

---

# Retrieval (6 stages, every /api/chat)

1. Query expansion (entity_aliases)
2. Summary-level search (summary_embedding) → candidate doc_ids
3. Chunk-level search (embedding, within candidates) → top chunks
4. Triple lookup (rdf_triples for those doc_ids, filter by query terms)
5. Context assembly (chunks + triples + system instruction)
6. LLM generation (Claude) → answer + sources + triples

Do not skip or reorder stages.

---

# API contract

Every chat-style response MUST include:

- **answer** (string)
- **sources** (array)
- **triples** (array)

Use empty arrays when there are none; never omit these fields.
