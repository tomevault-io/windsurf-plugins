_# Nx Monorepo Structure

This is an Nx monorepo containing applications and reusable packages.

## Core Technologies

- **Runtime**: Node.js (version specified in `.nvmrc`)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM for entity persistence
- **Cache**: Redis for caching
- **Background Jobs**: BullMQ for job queue management
- **Testing**: Jest with @swc/jest as test runner. Tests are run with `./node_modules/.bin/nx run <project-name>` as detailed below.

## Directory Structure

- `apps/` - Deployable applications (API, frontend, CLI, MCP server, e2e tests, docs)
- `packages/` - Reusable domain and infrastructure packages shared across apps
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipelines for build, test, quality checks, and deployment

## Local Development Environment

Local development uses Docker Compose to run all services (API, frontend, database, Redis, etc.):

```bash
docker compose up
```

This starts the entire development environment.
Docker Compose automatically provisions PostgreSQL and Redis - no manual setup required.
## Working with Nx

The following commands apply for both NX apps and packages (use `./node_modules/.bin/nx show projects` to list actual apps and packages.)
- Test a project: `./node_modules/.bin/nx test <project-name>`
- Lint a project: `./node_modules/.bin/nx lint <project-name>`
- Build a project: `./node_modules/.bin/nx build <project-name>`
- Test affected projects: `npm run test:staged`
- Lint affected projects: `npm run lint:staged`

## Code Quality

- **Linting**: `./node_modules/.bin/nx lint <project-name>` runs ESLint, using the config file `eslint.config.mjs`.
- **Formatting**: Prettier is used for code formatting. You don't have to run it, it's set as a pre-commit hook.

## Commands

- When running commands, ensure you use the correct Node version (see .nvmrc at the project's root level)
- When renaming or moving a file that is commited to git, use `git mv` instead of `mv`
- Ensure the env variable `PACKMIND_EDITION` is properly set to `oss`

## Git Workflow

- The project uses **trunk-based development** (all work on `main` branch)
- Do NOT create branches yourself - let developers decide on branching strategy
- Each sub-task should have its own commit (as per Task splitting section)

## Security

- **Secrets Detection**: GitGuardian runs in CI to detect leaked secrets
- **Secrets Retrieval**: Always use `Configuration.getConfig()` from `@packmind/node-utils` to access secrets in code
- **Secrets Storage**: Infisical or environment variables are used for secrets management - never hardcode secrets

## Documentation

Public end-user documentation is maintained in the `apps/doc/` folder (Mintlify-based).

## Task splitting

- For any task you perform, you MUST split it into multiple into sub-tasks which have a logical increment (eg: new endpoint, new component, new use case etc). When a task is done, run all the validation steps (lint, test, packmind etc) and ask me for validation of the work you did.
- Each sub task MUST have its own commit.
- Use the `./node_modules/.bin/nx lint` and `./node_modules/.bin/nx test` commands on the apps and packages you've edited

# Packmind Standards

Before starting your work, make sure to review the coding standards relevant to your current task.

Always consult the sections that apply to the technology, framework, or type of contribution you are working on.

All rules and guidelines defined in these standards are mandatory and must be followed consistently.

Failure to follow these standards may lead to inconsistencies, errors, or rework. Treat them as the source of truth for how code should be written, structured, and maintained.

# Standard: Changelog

Maintain CHANGELOG.MD using Keep a Changelog format with a top [Unreleased] section linked to HEAD, ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD), and per-release comparison links like [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/compare/release/<previous>...release/X.Y.Z to ensure accurate, consistent release documentation and version links. :
* Ensure all released versions have their corresponding comparison links defined at the bottom of the CHANGELOG.MD file in the format [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/compare/release/<previous>...release/X.Y.Z
* Format all release dates using the ISO 8601 date format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-11-21) to ensure consistent and internationally recognized date representation
* Maintain an [Unreleased] section at the top of the changelog with its corresponding link at the bottom pointing to HEAD to track ongoing changes between releases

Full standard is available here for further request: [Changelog](.packmind/standards/changelog.md)

# Standard: Typescript good practices

Enforce TypeScript error and DTO conventions by prohibiting Object.setPrototypeOf in custom errors and requiring intersection types (DomainType & { extraField: T }) for presentation DTO enrichment to improve reliability and catch domain-field drift at compile time. :
* Do not use `Object.setPrototypeOf` when defining errors.
* When defining a presentation DTO that enriches a domain type, use an intersection type (`DomainType & { extraField: T }`) instead of manually re-declaring the domain type's fields, so that structural drift is caught at compile time.
