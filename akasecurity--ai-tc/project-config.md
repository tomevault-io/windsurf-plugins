# AI Traffic Control — Conventions for AI Agents

Read this before generating any code in this repository. These conventions are enforced by ESLint and CI — code that violates them will fail to merge.

AI Traffic Control (`ai-tc`, by AKA Security — the `aka` CLI and plugin names come from
the company) is a **local-first** security control plane for AI coding agents. The whole surface
runs on one machine with **no server, no Docker, and no database engine**: the Claude Code
plugin and the `aka` CLI capture agent activity into a local SQLite store at
`~/.aka/data/aka.db`, and the web dashboard reads that same store directly. Nothing leaves
the machine — there is no account, no network hop, and no backend to stand up.

## Tech stack

- **Language:** TypeScript strict mode, ESM everywhere (`"type": "module"`)
- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- **Runtime:** Node.js 24+ (the CLI and plugin hooks use the built-in `node:sqlite` — no native dependency); `.nvmrc`, CI, and `@types/node` all track the Active LTS line, matching the `engines` floor
- **Local store:** SQLite via `node:sqlite`, wrapped by `@akasecurity/persistence`; the schema is defined with Drizzle in `@akasecurity/schema`
- **Validation:** Zod schemas in `@akasecurity/schema` — the single source of truth
- **Web dashboard:** Next.js 15 + React 19 (Server Components read the store; Server Actions mutate it)
- **Testing:** Vitest
- **Packaging:** the `aka` CLI and the Claude Code plugin, published to npm as self-contained bundles

## Architecture principles

### 1. Fail-open everywhere in the plugin

The plugin **must never break a user's Claude session**. Every hook handler wraps everything in try/catch and falls back to `{ action: 'allow' }`.

### 2. Contracts before code

`@akasecurity/schema` is the spine. The Zod schemas in `src/zod/` define every data boundary. Add shapes there before implementing them anywhere else.

**Do not create new types and interfaces — use the ones exported from `@akasecurity/schema` to the maximum extent.** Consumers (web-ui, CLI, plugin) import the schema types directly rather than redefining local "view-model" shapes or adapters. A new type is justified only when there is genuinely no schema equivalent (e.g. pure presentation descriptors like `{ label, icon, color }`). If a shape is missing, add it to `@akasecurity/schema/src/zod/` first, then consume it.

### 3. `process.env` is off by default

ESLint (`n/no-process-env`) forbids reading `process.env` across the workspace — a violation is a CI failure, not a warning. The few places that genuinely need the host environment (the plugin's LLM-provider resolution, the CLI spawning the dashboard server) opt out explicitly in their own ESLint config.

### 4. No network calls

The OSS product is **local-only**: it runs on Node + the SQLite store under `~/.aka` and talks to **no AKA service** — no account, no backend, no HTTP hop. A direct `fetch()` must never appear in OSS source. The only network access is `@akasecurity/local-ops` shelling out to package managers (`npm`/`claude`) for update-and-apply, and the Claude Code plugin's own `npm audit signatures` child process — run from inside the plugin's dependency closure (a plugin script or `@akasecurity/plugin-sdk`, since the plugin cannot import `@akasecurity/local-ops`).

## Package dependency rules

The store-reading packages read the local SQLite store directly through
`@akasecurity/persistence`; they never reach for an HTTP client or an ORM at the app layer.
Keep these package boundaries intact — a forbidden import across a package wall is a defect.

@akasecurity/persistence   → node:sqlite, @akasecurity/schema
