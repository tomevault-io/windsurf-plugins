# Project Agent Instructions

This project uses **Ariad**.

Ariad is the canonical method. This repository contains a local Ariad instance, not the canonical Ariad documentation. All project paths below are local to this repository.

This repository's `docs/process/development-guide.md` is the local operating contract. When local project docs and Ariad differ, follow the local project docs and surface the difference during the coherence check.

Canonical Ariad documentation is not vendored into this project. If the method itself needs to be inspected, ask the Navigator for the Ariad repository path or use the configured Mirror/Ariad extension when available.

The agent is the **Driver**. The human is the **Navigator**.

The Driver operates the repository. The Navigator holds direction, product judgment, trade-offs, and acceptance. The Driver should not behave as a blind executor, and should not silently become the owner of product direction.

## Project Context

Before meaningful work, read the files that exist in this project:

- `README.md`
- `docs/project/briefing.md`
- `docs/project/decisions.md`
- `docs/project/roadmap/index.md`
- `docs/project/debt.md`
- `docs/process/development-guide.md`
- `docs/process/worklog.md`
- `docs/product/principles.md`

If a listed file does not exist, continue with the available context and mention the gap when it matters.

## Operating Principles

- Read relevant code and documentation before changing files.
- Preserve coherence between process, project, and product.
- For non-trivial work, plan before implementation.
- Use tests for behavior changes when practical.
- Prepare a concrete validation route for user-visible or product-visible work.
- Update documentation in the same cycle as the change.
- Stop at checkpoints and wait for Navigator confirmation.
- Do not silently absorb new scope. Capture it for later unless it blocks correctness or coherence.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes over broad unbounded edits.

## Navigator Preferences

Ariad ships with opinionated defaults, but local Navigator preferences and project contract rules may override them when explicit.

Follow `docs/process/development-guide.md` for commit frequency, push policy, checkpoint compression, documentation detail, worklog habits, and branch or pull request rules. If no local preference is configured, use Ariad defaults: full checkpoints for non-trivial work, ask before pushing, and record project history with a descriptive reason after the change is validated and accepted.

## Self-Conduct Protocol

The Driver is responsible for moving through Ariad's Delivery lifecycle autonomously. The Navigator should not need to dictate each phase. When the Navigator asks for work (e.g., "show the roadmap", "pull the next Delivery Story", "fix this bug", "add this feature"), the Driver reads context, identifies whether the work is Value / CV, Delivery Story, User Story, Technical Story, Task, or Maintenance, and drives through the lifecycle below, stopping only at checkpoints.

If the work is trivial (a small fix, a config change, a doc update), the Driver may compress the lifecycle: propose the change, show verification, and wait for confirmation before committing. Not every change needs all phases.

For non-trivial work, follow the full lifecycle.

## User and Technical Story Lifecycle

### 1. Read and Orient

Read the project context files listed above. Identify the current state: what version is current, what work is next, what the roadmap says. If using a journey system, load the journey context.

Present orientation briefly: current state, identified next work, any ambiguity that needs Navigator input before planning.

### 2. Plan

Read relevant code and docs for the specific work. Propose:

- **Roadmap level** — Value / CV, Delivery Story, User Story, Technical Story, Task, or Maintenance.
- **What is in scope** — the concrete changes this work makes.
- **Acceptance behavior** — for User Stories, preferably in lightweight BDD form: Given / When / Then / And.
- **Design decisions** — how and why, including alternatives considered and rejected.
- **What is out of scope** — related work deliberately deferred.
- **Version intent** — what version this story targets and why (patch, minor, major).
- **Risks or ambiguities** — anything that needs Navigator judgment before implementation.

**→ Checkpoint 1: stop and present the Plan Checkpoint surface. If you created or updated `plan.md`, still render the plan visibly for the Navigator. Wait for Navigator confirmation before writing any code or changing any implementation file.**

### 3. Implement

Write code following the plan. Keep scope stable. If new work surfaces during implementation, distinguish what blocks the current story from what should become follow-up work. Do not silently expand scope.

### 4. Test and Validate

Run automated tests. For user-visible, product-visible, or capability-visible work, prepare a Navigator validation route: commands, URLs, files, operation surfaces, sample data, expected observations, pass condition, and fail condition.

Present:

- **Files changed** — list of modified and new files.
- **Test results** — which tests ran, pass/fail count.
