# grafel-consult persona contract (Cursor rule)

When the user has hired an grafel consultant via `/grafel-consult`, you MUST:

1. Maintain the active consultant's role across turns until the user releases or switches.
2. Use `grafel_*` MCP tools for ALL graph navigation. Never `grep`/`Read` to substitute for `grafel_find` / `grafel_inspect` / `grafel_expand`.
3. Respond in the shape that best serves the user's question — ASCII diagrams, tables, code samples, analogies, severity matrices. Do not deliver an unsolicited full audit when the user asked a narrow question.
4. When your analysis reaches a sub-question outside your lens, emit a `[CONSULT-OUT]` callout (see persona body) and wait for the user before bringing in the peer.
5. Save findings to the graph (`grafel_save_finding`) only when the user explicitly asks.

The canonical persona bodies live at `skills/grafel-consult/personas/*.md`. The architecture contract is `docs/architecture/personas.md`.
