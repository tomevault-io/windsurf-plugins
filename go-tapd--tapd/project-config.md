# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The repository is a Go SDK for TAPD. Core client logic lives in the root
package: `client*.go`, `request.go`, `response.go`, and `helpers.go`. API
services are grouped by resource in files such as `api_story.go`,
`api_bug.go`, and `api_workspace.go`, with matching unit tests in
`api_*_test.go`. Test fixtures live under `internal/testdata/api/<resource>/`.
Webhook support is isolated in [`webhook/`](webhook/). Use
[`guide.md`](guide.md) and [`features.md`](features.md) when adding endpoints.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use the `Makefile` as the default entry point:

- `make test`: run `go test ./... -race` across the repo.
- `make lint`: run `go mod tidy` and `golangci-lint`.
- `make lint-fix`: apply auto-fixes from enabled linters/formatters.
- `make go-mod-tidy`: normalize module dependencies for Go `1.25.0`.

For focused work, use standard Go commands such as
`go test . -run TestStory_GetStories -v` or
`go test -v -run ^TestStory_Prod_GetStories$ ./tests/` for a single
integration test when available.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow Go defaults and keep code `gofumpt`/`goimports` clean. Use tabs for
indentation. Keep public API names consistent with existing patterns: request
types like `GetStoriesRequest`, service methods like `GetStories`, and
resource structs named after TAPD objects. In this repository, request fields
use pointer types with `url:"...,omitempty"` tags; response fields use value
types unless the field is nullable. Add concise Chinese comments to exported
request and response fields when implementing new TAPD APIs.

## Testing Guidelines
Unit tests sit beside the code in `api_*_test.go`, `client_test.go`, and
similar files. Prefer table-driven tests and assert HTTP method, path,
query/body parameters, and a few representative response fields. Store canned
API payloads in `internal/testdata/api/...`. Run targeted tests first, then
`make test`. If you add a production/integration test, run it individually,
not in batch.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history uses Conventional Commits, for example
`docs(skills): refine implement-api skill workflow` and
`chore(deps): update module ...`. Keep subjects imperative and scoped when
useful: `feat(story): add story field labels endpoint`. PRs should describe
the user-visible change, list affected APIs/files, note test coverage, and
link related issues. Include sample requests/responses when behavior changes
or a new endpoint is added.

## Project Memory

Reusable project memory lives in `internal/docs/memories/`.

Before non-trivial work, read `internal/docs/memories/index.md` and then open only the memory files relevant to the task.

Update memories when the user requests memory maintenance or when the current task explicitly includes maintaining reusable project knowledge. If memory maintenance is outside the current task scope, recommend the update instead of editing memory files. Do not store one-off task notes, temporary debugging details, raw chat logs, secrets, credentials, or conversation-specific context.

When changing memories, keep entries concise and actionable. Update `internal/docs/memories/index.md` when adding, removing, renaming, or materially changing memory files.
