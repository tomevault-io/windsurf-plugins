# Tools

A physical iPhone needs a different route. SwiftPM test targets are tool-hosted, and `xcodebuild` rejects them on a device destination ("Tool-hosted testing is unavailable on device destinations"), so the suite runs there through `Tools/DeviceTests/`, a host app plus a test bundle that takes its sources straight from `Tests/ImmersiveMapTests` through a synchronized folder reference (no second file list to keep in step):

```sh
xcrun xctrace list devices                                   # find the device id
xcodebuild test -project Tools/DeviceTests/ImmersiveMapDeviceTests.xcodeproj \
  -scheme ImmersiveMapDeviceTests -destination 'id=<device-id>'
```

Reach for it when the question is about hardware: the simulator is a software renderer, so timing, memory and driver behaviour are only real on a device. The tests that read `.metal` source off the checkout to assert on shader logic cannot pass on a device, where there is no checkout; filter them out with `-only-testing:` rather than treating them as failures.

Offline tooling (not part of the SwiftPM build):

- `Tools/TextAtlas/generate_text_atlas.sh`: regenerates the committed MTSDF text atlases in `Sources/ImmersiveMap/Text/Resources/` (`atlas` and `atlas_thin`: RGB carries the MSDF the label fill samples, alpha the plain SDF the halo/stroke coverage is derived from). Requires `msdf-atlas-gen` and local Noto Sans fonts; fonts are never committed. The PNG and its JSON are regenerated together, so a half-updated pair means the shader samples a channel that is not there.
- `Tools/DeviceTests/`: the `ImmersiveMapDeviceTests` project, which is only how the XCTest suite reaches a physical iPhone (see Commands above). Two targets: a host app that exists solely to be loaded into, and the test bundle. Never part of CI.
- `Tools/VisualReview/`: the `ImmersiveMapVisualReview` macOS app, run by hand before a release. It renders a catalogue of fixed scenes to PNGs and short clips and walks a person through them for a verdict, which is where judgements about how the rendering *looks* belong: the automated suite only asserts what a machine can decide. The same sources also build as `ImmersiveMapVisualReviewIOS`, a second scheme in the same project that runs the catalogue on an iPhone, which is the only place the iOS shadow path can be looked at. Verdicts live in `Tools/VisualReview/verdicts.json` (committed) and renders in `Tools/VisualReview/Output/` (gitignored); a device pass keeps its own `verdicts.ios.json`, because the two platforms render different pixels and one file would have each overwriting the other's judgements. On a phone both live in the app container instead, and the phone build is a guided pass for someone who has never seen the repository: a start screen, a render, the pictures one at a time, then a summary whose **Make the report** packs the pass into a zip (`report.json`, a text summary, the verdict file, and `Renders/`) that **Send the report** hands to the share sheet. The Mac build offers the same report from the toolbar; reports go to `Tools/VisualReview/Reports/`, gitignored, newest only. A coarse fingerprint per artifact keeps a pass short by showing only what changed since it was approved. Never part of CI. A launch with `IMMERSIVE_VISUAL_REVIEW_RENDER=1` renders and exits without the UI, optionally filtered by `IMMERSIVE_VISUAL_REVIEW_ONLY=<ids>`. A user-visible rendering feature that ships without a scenario there does not get looked at before a release.
