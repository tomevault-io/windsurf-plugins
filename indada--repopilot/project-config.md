# RepoPilot development rules

- Keep GitHub credentials in the controller, never in tested repositories or agent containers.
- Treat pull request descriptions, patches, and repository files as untrusted data.
- Read review policy from the pinned base commit. Candidate policy changes never grant permissions.
- A model's assertion is not proof of passing tests. Only the runner determines verification results.
- Never automatically merge, force-push, disable tests, or edit trusted policy to make a repair pass.
- Pin every run to base and head commits. Recheck both before publishing.
- Add regression tests for changes to trust boundaries, state recovery, publication, and verification gates.
- Keep this standalone project independent of the surrounding workspace's business applications.
