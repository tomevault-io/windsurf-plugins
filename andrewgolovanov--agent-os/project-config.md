# Agent OS repository instructions

## Purpose

This repository is the portable Agent OS source. Keep user project code and mutable operational state in the selected private `AGENT_OS_HOME`; only Agent OS core, app/plugin components, reusable workflows, tests, and product documentation belong in the source candidate.

## Always

- Treat private `AGENT_OS_HOME/config/projects.yaml` as the canonical registry for project keys, aliases, project roots, and repository paths.
- Automatic Codex project sync may add deterministic existing local project roots discovered from public active-thread `cwd` metadata or the current task `cwd`; Git is optional. It may attach or fill verified repository metadata later only when the Git root equals the registered project root. It must skip conflicts, missing paths, ambiguous overlaps, and transient worktrees without a durable checkout; it never imports thread content or creates Task Board outcomes. After registration it may link a known stable Slack channel only when the normalized channel name has exactly one registered project owner and every labeled outcome is either unassigned or already attributed only to that project. It may attribute only unfinished unassigned outcomes; completed and conflicting attribution are immutable. All ambiguous Slack cases, manual onboarding, nested or multi-repository changes, and relinking remain preview-first.
- Resolve a project through the registry before substantive project work.
- Read the registered project root `AGENTS.md` before working on that project. For a multi-repository registration, then obey any more specific repository `AGENTS.md` before editing that repository.
- Before Git-sensitive conclusions or mutations, verify the exact path, repository root, remotes, branch, HEAD, and worktree status.
- Preserve unrelated changes. Never move project repositories, change remotes, publish, deploy, or write to external services without explicit user intent.
- Record durable current state through `tools/task-board`; do not rely on chat history as the only copy of an important decision or next step.

## Route by task

| Task | Read first |
| --- | --- |
| Agent OS architecture or documentation | `docs/README.md`, then the owning document |
| Add or change a registered project | `.agents/skills/onboard-project/SKILL.md` |
| Work on a registered project | `AGENT_OS_HOME/config/projects.yaml`, then the registered project root `AGENTS.md` |
| Start or resume durable work | `docs/task-board.md`, then resolve the exact private outcome through `tools/task-board` or Task Bridge |
| Task correlation, Codex activity, or checkpoints | `AGENT_OS_HOME/config/task-bridge.yaml`, then `docs/task-bridge.md` |
| Slack monitor or review intake | `AGENT_OS_HOME/config/monitors.yaml`, then `docs/slack-monitor.md` or `docs/review-intake.md` |
| Install or repair optional integrations | `docs/optional-integrations.md`, then the relevant plugin skill and provider state |
| Create or change a skill | `docs/extending.md` and the skill's `SKILL.md` |

## Working contract

1. Discover and verify facts before editing structured records.
2. Keep one canonical owner for each fact; documentation may explain a fact but must not silently fork it.
3. Prefer a small reversible change. Use preview or dry-run behavior for tools that can mutate state.
4. Validate the affected layer and report exactly what was and was not verified.
5. For material Agent OS changes, update the owning doc, `docs/state.md`, and `docs/changelog.md`; add a decision record when rationale must survive.

## Documentation maintenance

- Treat documentation as part of the implementation, not as later cleanup. In the same change, update every relevant document whose claim became inaccurate because user-visible behavior, setup, commands, paths, naming, architecture, security boundaries, validation, or release behavior changed.
- Keep agent-facing commands, required checks, routing, and ownership rules in the nearest applicable `AGENTS.md`. Keep human installation, usage, and contribution guidance in the nearest relevant README. Keep deeper product facts in the owning document under `docs/`.
- Write repository documentation, READMEs, agent instructions, examples, and release notes in English. Private user-authored project and task content may follow the user's language.
- Update only affected documents; do not mechanically touch every `AGENTS.md` or README. Before handoff, search for removed or renamed commands, paths, and product names, and run every validation command that was added or changed.

## Validation

Run `ruby tools/validate-agent-os` after structural or registry changes. Run `tools/sync-plugin-runtime --check` after changing any runtime file bundled by the plugin or app. Run `tools/task-board validate` after task-state tooling changes and `tools/slack-state validate` after dispatcher-state changes. Validate every changed plugin skill, run `node test/plugin_packages_test.mjs` after plugin hook or manifest changes, and start a fresh Codex task for real hook-pickup verification. Run repository-specific checks from the registered repository and its closest `AGENTS.md`.
