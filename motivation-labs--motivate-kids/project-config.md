## Branching & Release Strategy

**`main` is the production branch.** It is deployed to Vercel on every push.

- **Never commit directly to `main`.**
- All work — features, fixes, chores — must happen on a dedicated branch.
- Branch naming convention:
  - `feat/<short-description>` — new features
  - `fix/<short-description>` — bug fixes
  - `chore/<short-description>` — dependency updates, config, tooling
  - `refactor/<short-description>` — code restructuring with no behaviour change
  - `docs/<short-description>` — documentation only

### Workflow for Every Change

#### Phase 1: Analyze & Design (before writing any code)

When receiving a feature request or bug report:

1. **Deeply analyze the request** — don't take it at face value. Ask:
   - What is the user actually trying to accomplish?
   - What surfaces/pages are affected?
   - What existing code and patterns are involved?
   - What edge cases, failure modes, or UX pitfalls exist?
   - How does this interact with the rest of the system?
2. **Audit the live state** — read the current code for all affected surfaces. Identify gaps between what exists and what the ideal UX should be.
3. **Design the solution thoroughly** — define the exact changes needed per file, the user flow, and any data/type changes.
4. **Update `prd.md`** — add a structured Build Queue entry with acceptance criteria, technical notes, and test cases. Show the user and confirm before building.

#### Phase 2: Build (one feature at a time)

1. Branch off `main`: `git checkout -b feat/<name> main`
2. Implement **one feature only** following the one-feature-at-a-time rule (see `~/CLAUDE.md`)
3. Run lint + type-check + build — all must pass
4. Open a PR targeting `main`
5. Squash-merge the PR; delete the feature branch after merge
6. **Verify the feature works** before moving to the next one
7. Only then start the next feature — never batch multiple features into one PR
