# Project Overview

This repository provides automation scaffolding for Cursor IDE, including commands, skills, and GitHub workflow automations. It serves as a template repository for setting up consistent development workflows, automated dependency management, and code quality checks.

## Purpose

- Provide reusable Cursor commands and skills structure
- Standardize GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- Automate dependency management via Dependabot
- Enforce code quality through pre-commit hooks
- Maintain consistent repository settings and branch protection

## Technology Stack

- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflows for automation
- **Pre-commit**: Code quality hooks (black, bandit, trailing-whitespace, etc.)
- **Python**: Primary language for scripts and tools
- **YAML**: Configuration for workflows, pre-commit, and GitHub settings
- **Markdown**: Documentation and instructions
- **Shell/Bash**: Utility scripts

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- **Line Endings**: Use LF (Unix-style) line endings, not CRLF
- **Indentation**: Use spaces, not tabs (4 spaces for Python, 2 spaces for YAML)
- **File Endings**: Always end files with a newline
- **Trailing Whitespace**: Remove all trailing whitespace
- **Encoding**: Use UTF-8 without BOM (Byte Order Mark)

### Python Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use `black` for code formatting (enforced by pre-commit)
- Use `bandit` for security linting
- Avoid debug statements in committed code
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

### YAML Standards

- Indent with 2 spaces
- Use lowercase for keys
- Quote strings when they contain special characters
- Keep workflow files organized with clear job and step names
- Add comments to explain non-obvious configurations

### Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Follow consistent heading hierarchy
- Include code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Add links to relevant resources
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use relative links for internal documentation

## GitHub Actions Patterns

### Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: Descriptive Workflow Name

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  job-name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Descriptive step name
        run: |
          # Commands here
```

### Best Practices

- Use specific action versions (e.g., `@v4`, not `@latest`)
- Cache dependencies when possible
- Use matrix builds for multi-version testing
- Set appropriate permissions for workflows
- Use secrets for sensitive data
- Add descriptive names to all jobs and steps
- Group related steps with clear comments

## Pre-commit Hooks

All code must pass pre-commit hooks before committing:

- `end-of-file-fixer`: Ensures files end with newline
- `trailing-whitespace`: Removes trailing spaces
- `mixed-line-ending`: Enforces consistent line endings
- `check-merge-conflict`: Detects merge conflict markers
- `check-ast`: Validates Python syntax
- `black`: Python code formatting
- `bandit`: Python security checks
- `forbid-crlf` and `remove-crlf`: Enforce LF line endings
- `forbid-tabs` and `remove-tabs`: Enforce spaces over tabs

### Running Pre-commit

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run on staged files
pre-commit run
```

### For AI Agents (CRITICAL)

**AI agents and automated tools MUST install and run pre-commit hooks** to prevent CI failures:

```bash
# 1. Install hooks at session start
pre-commit install

# 2. Run pre-commit before committing
pre-commit run --all-files

# 3. Then use automated commit tools (e.g., report_progress)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Automated commit tools bypass local git hooks
- Without pre-commit, commits fail CI/CD checks
- Causes PR failures requiring fix-up commits

## Automation Patterns

### Dependabot

- Daily dependency updates for all ecosystems
- Automatic grouping of patch updates
- Auto-merge enabled for minor/patch updates
- Major version updates require manual review

### Branch Protection

- All changes must go through pull requests
- PRs must be up-to-date with `main` before merging
- Required status checks: `pre-commit`, `sync`
