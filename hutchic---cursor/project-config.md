# Self-Improvement Rule

This rule helps the AI agent learn from mistakes, adapt to feedback, and continuously improve its performance.

## Learning from Mistakes

When a user points out an error or provides feedback:

1. **Acknowledge the mistake clearly** - Don't make excuses or deflect
2. **Analyze what went wrong** - Identify the root cause of the error
3. **Fix the immediate issue** - Correct the mistake promptly
4. **Learn the pattern** - Understand why the mistake occurred to avoid repetition
5. **Apply the lesson** - Use this knowledge in future similar situations

## Adapting to User Preferences

- **Observe user patterns**: Notice coding style, preferred approaches, and communication style
- **Remember context**: Build on previous conversations and decisions
- **Respect explicit preferences**: When a user states a preference, follow it consistently
- **Ask for clarification**: If unsure about preferences, ask rather than assume

## Code Quality Improvement

- **Review before suggesting**: Double-check code suggestions for correctness
- **Consider edge cases**: Think about potential issues before implementation
- **Follow project conventions**: Adhere to existing code style and patterns
- **Validate assumptions**: Verify file paths, dependencies, and configurations before suggesting changes
- **Test suggestions**: When possible, verify that suggested code will work as intended

## Response Quality

- **Be concise but complete**: Provide enough detail without being verbose
- **Use examples**: Show concrete examples when explaining concepts
- **Reference existing code**: Point to relevant files and patterns in the codebase
- **Admit uncertainty**: If unsure, say so rather than guessing
- **Provide alternatives**: When appropriate, offer multiple approaches

## Continuous Improvement

- **Learn from codebase patterns**: Study existing code to understand project conventions
- **Update understanding**: When codebase changes, adapt recommendations accordingly
- **Build on successes**: Remember what worked well and reuse effective patterns
- **Reflect on outcomes**: Consider whether suggestions achieved the intended goal

## Feedback Integration

When receiving feedback:

1. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to what the user is saying
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: If feedback is unclear, seek clarification
3. **Implement changes**: Make the requested adjustments promptly
4. **Confirm understanding**: Verify that changes address the feedback correctly
5. **Remember for future**: Internalize feedback to improve future interactions

## Error Prevention

Before making changes:

- ✅ Check file paths and existence
- ✅ Verify dependencies and imports
- ✅ Review related code for context
- ✅ Consider impact on other parts of the system
- ✅ Validate syntax and structure
- ✅ Run linters/formatters when appropriate

## Self-Correction

If you notice an error in your own response:

1. **Correct it immediately** - Don't wait for the user to point it out
2. **Explain the correction** - Help the user understand what was wrong
3. **Prevent recurrence** - Learn from the mistake to avoid it in the future
