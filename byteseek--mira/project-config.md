# Mira Agent Guide

This repository is the `Mira` research workspace. Mira is a named research
protocol, not a fictional personality, adviser, trade bot, or background
automation promise.

## Read Order

1. `MIRA.md` for the wake word, identity boundary, and memory contract.
2. `OPERATING_CONTRACT.md` for the one-screen lazy-loading map.
3. `START_HERE.md` when the user asks how to start, what Mira covers, or wants prompt examples.
4. `AGENT_QUICKSTART.md` only when agent execution details, output locations, or extended examples are needed.

## Fast Paths

| user intent | do this |
| --- | --- |
| empty first prompt, `hi Mira`, `你好 Mira`, `Mira mode`, or onboarding request | Return a concise `START_HERE.md` summary before any research workflow. |
| `update mira`, `Mira self-update`, `从 GitHub 拉最新 Mira` | Run `scripts/mira_update.sh`. Do not run `scripts/check_updates.sh` first. |
| `Mira help`, `怎么用 Mira`, `Mira 能做什么`, `start here` | Return the layered Start Here card from `START_HERE.md`; keep it user-facing and concise. |
| start a `standard` / `deep_dive` research task | Run `scripts/check_updates.sh` once (local-first by default, 24h remote TTL; add `--always-fetch` to force a remote check now). Report if behind; never auto-update or elevate sandbox permissions — a blocked fetch degrades to cached local refs and is disclosed. |
| start a `quick_map` / `看一下` task | Skip the freshness check; it is not worth a network round-trip for throwaway triage. |
| `Mira, 看一下 X` | Treat as `quick_map`; route first, then answer with source notes and refresh triggers. |
| time-sensitive market question (`今天`, `现在`, `目前`, `latest`, intraday, premarket, after-hours, crash/pullback) | Run `data/time-policy.md` Market-Date Resolution, then `data/live-data-source-policy.md`; anchor relative dates to the market timezone, search or refresh live sources before judging, and show quote/publish time plus freshness caveat. |
| `现在能不能买/卖 X`, `能不能加/减/追/抄底 X`, actionability ask | Run `data/marginal-buyer-payoff-bridge.md` before `data/actionability-risk-control.md`; identify marginal buyer/seller, payoff source, repricing trigger, priced-in status and failure mode before posture. |
| daily/weekly market report, market brief, 盘前简报, 收盘复盘, 日报, 周报 | Use `loops/market-briefing-loop.md`; set `market_scope`, `briefing_type`, quote/publish time, source notes and escalation queue. |
| `Mira, 研究 X` | Use `loops/research-loop.md` unless routing selects a narrower path. |
| `Mira, 更新 X` | Use `loops/monitoring-loop.md`; focus on incremental evidence and thesis impact. |
| earnings, guidance, or transcript work | Use `skills/earnings-report-analysis/` before updating a standard research package. |
| research report, sell-side note, rating change, target price, or user-provided report/PDF | Use `skills/research-report-interpretation/`; run ingestion/restricted-source handling before using the report as evidence. |
| methodology reliability | Use `loops/methodology-research-loop.md`. |
| PM, position, portfolio, or decision review | Use the matching review loop from `OPERATING_CONTRACT.md`. |

If a user already provides a concrete research task as the first prompt, do not
block with onboarding. Route and answer the task, optionally adding one short
line that `Mira help` shows the full prompt menu.

## Research Rules

- Start by identifying `research_object`, `market_scope`, `time_boundary`, and
  available sources.
- Before formal analysis, run `loops/analysis-routing.md`.
- For time-sensitive market questions, run `data/live-data-source-policy.md`
  before judging the move; do not answer from memory or stale market data.
- For relative market dates (`今天`, `现在`, `latest`), resolve the date in the
  instrument's market timezone first. US equities default to
  `America/New_York`; do not use China/Singapore/user-local date as the US
  `market_session_date`.
- For daily or weekly market briefings, use `loops/market-briefing-loop.md`
  instead of `monitoring-loop.md`; briefings start from a market/time window,
  then route high-information objects into follow-up research.
- Use `quick_map`, `standard`, or `deep_dive` to control depth. Do not let a
  quick look become a full package unless the user asks.
- For single-equity research, run thesis horizon and framework routing; add
  overlay routing only when it materially improves the evidence path.
- Use the quant dependency gate when conclusions rely on derived numbers,
  valuation math, peer ranking, or time-series comparisons.
- Keep facts, inferences, and judgments separate.
- Tie every durable conclusion to an evidence log or explicit source note.
- Keep user-specific views, watchlists, preferences, holdings, weights, and
  portfolio constraints in gitignored `private/` state by default. Tracked Mira
  files are product state unless the user explicitly asks to contribute a
  de-identified example or method.
- State `stale_after`, `must_refresh_if`, or an equivalent refresh condition.
- Downgrade conclusions when source quality, freshness, or calculation support
  is weak.
- Do not present position-size or portfolio-construction conclusions without
  user-provided holdings, weights, mandate, and risk budget.
- Use research actions only; never present autonomous trade execution.
