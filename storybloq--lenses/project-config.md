# Lenses -- Multi-Lens Code Review MCP Server

## What This Is

An MCP server that runs 8 specialized code reviewers in parallel and returns a structured verdict. Three tool calls: `lens_review_start` (returns agent refs — promptHash + expiresAt — plus any cached findings), `lens_review_get_prompt` (fetches one lens's full prompt, called once per spawn), and `lens_review_complete` (takes results, returns verdict with rich envelope including parseErrors / deferred / nextActions). The agent spawns subagents -- the server handles everything else: lens selection, prompt construction, deduplication, confidence filtering, blocking policy, tension resolution, verdict computation, and cooperative retry protocol.

## Why This Exists

The previous lens review system required the AI agent to orchestrate 7 steps manually (prepare, read files, spawn agents, collect, synthesize, parse, present). Every step was a failure point. Results varied between runs. This server moves all orchestration logic server-side, leaving the agent with one job: spawn agents with provided prompts and pipe results back.

## Architecture

### Two-Hop+ Flow

**Hop 1: `lens_review_start`**
- Input: stage (PLAN_REVIEW or CODE_REVIEW), artifact (plan text or diff), changed files, config
- Server: selects active lenses, builds complete self-contained prompts (never truncated), decides model per lens, computes per-lens `expiresAt` from `lensTimeout`
- Output: `{ reviewId, agents: [{ id, model, promptHash, expiresAt }], cached: [{ id, findings }] }` — refs, not prompts, so the hop-1 payload stays small (<5KB for 6 lenses)

**Hop 1.5: `lens_review_get_prompt`**
- Input: `{ reviewId, lensId }`
- Server: returns the full activation prompt for that lens
- Output: `{ prompt }`. Stateless — same input always yields the same output for the review's lifetime.

**Hop 2+: `lens_review_complete`**
- Input: `reviewId`, per-lens outputs with optional `attempt` (default 1)
- Server: validates envelopes with `.passthrough()` (unknown keys ignored), validates per-finding with `.strict()` (hallucination rejected and surfaced as `parseErrors[]`), deduplicates, filters by confidence (with dropped findings surfaced in `deferred[]`), applies blocking policy, resolves tensions, computes verdict. Emits `nextActions[]` for retryable failures while attempts remain; rejects stale or non-contiguous attempts.
- Output: `{ verdict, findings, tensions, blocking, major, minor, suggestions, sessionId, parseErrors, deferred, suppressedFindingCount, hadAnyFindings, nextActions }`

The caller honors the cooperative retry protocol: when `nextActions[]` is non-empty, re-spawn the named lenses with `retryPrompt` and resubmit via `lens_review_complete` with `attempt: N+1`. `max_attempts` defaults to 2.

### 8 Lenses

| Lens | Default Model | Focus |
|------|--------------|-------|
| security | opus | Auth, injection, secrets, cryptography |
| error-handling | sonnet | Failure modes, rollback, circuit breakers, partial failure |
| clean-code | sonnet | SRP, naming, dead code, coupling, abstraction |
| performance | sonnet | Hot paths, N+1, caching, memory, sync-in-request |
| api-design | sonnet | Contracts, versioning, error envelopes, pagination |
| concurrency | opus | Races, deadlocks, actor isolation, atomicity |
| test-quality | sonnet | Coverage, assertion quality, fixture reuse, flaky tests |
| accessibility | sonnet | WCAG, focus, labels, contrast, screen reader |

### No API Key Required

The server never calls the Claude API. Claude Code is the execution engine -- the server provides the prompts, the agent spawns subagents, and the server processes results. No API key management needed.
