# Performance work

Always add benchmarks created during performance investigations to the permanent
benchmark corpus. Register runnable cases in `benchmarks/manifest.json`, include
them in `benchmark all`, and retain correctness gates and reproducible commands.
Temporary probes and saved reports alone do not satisfy this requirement. Cover
both sides of any discovered threshold or performance cliff.
