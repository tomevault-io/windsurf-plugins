# CLAUDE.md

## 1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing.
- Always provide a high level design plan

## 2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No “flexibility” that wasn't requested.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.

## 3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- “Fix the bug” → “Reproduce it in a test, then fix”
- “Refactor X” → “Ensure tests pass before and after”

## Development

- check for relevant rust crates 
- for launching terminal tasks Use "nix develop"
