# Core Compatibility Policy

- `cicada-tg==0.3.5` is the canonical core and source of truth.
- Do not modify runtime behavior in `cicada/`, `core/*.py`, or `vendor/cicada-dsl-parser/cicada/` by hand.
- Runtime changes must happen upstream in `cicada-tg`, then be synced into this repo and verified with `npm run core:guard`.
- Studio is a thin UI/editor layer. It may generate DSL, show hints, and call adapters, but it must not override parser, executor, runtime, event, adapter, or DB semantics.
- Put integration glue in `services/`, `src/`, or explicit adapter/extension files. Never import `legacy/` from core runtime paths.
- Mark obsolete compatibility behavior with `@obsolete` and isolate it under `legacy/`.
- Before finishing core-adjacent work, run `npm run ci:compat` and `npm run build`.
