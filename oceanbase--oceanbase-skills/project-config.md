# AGENTS.md — OceanBase Skills Repository

This file provides context for AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, etc.) working inside this repository.

---

## Repository Purpose

`oceanbase-skills` is a monorepo of **AI Agent Skills** for OceanBase products. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` (with YAML frontmatter) and optional `references/` for supplemental documentation, following the **Agent Skills Specification**.

Skills are published as a single npm package (`oceanbase-skills`) so they can be installed into any project and loaded by any AI agent.

### Conventions

- **One skill per directory** under `skills/`.
- **`SKILL.md` is the primary artifact.** It uses YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `compatibility`, `metadata`) and is written for AI agents to read and follow.
- **`references/*.md`** contains supplemental documentation loaded on demand — keeps `SKILL.md` under 500 lines.
- **`README.md`** (where present) explains how end-users install and integrate the skill. It is human-facing.
- **`oceanbase-deploy` is a complete routed bundle.** Packaging and manual-install instructions must retain its root entrypoint, shared references, and child skill directories; do not instruct users to paste only the root `SKILL.md`.
- **The root `package.json` is the published npm package authority.** Keep its release version and SPDX license synchronized with the intended release and root `LICENSE`; the nested legacy package is not a substitute.

## How to Work in This Repository

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/oceanbase-deploy/<new-skill-name>/`.
2. Write `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `compatibility`, `metadata`) and clear instructions.
3. Add `references/` for detailed content that should be loaded on demand.
4. Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines — move details to `references/`.

### Editing an Existing Skill

- The source of truth for skill content is `skills/oceanbase-deploy/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- When updating commands, flags, or behaviors, verify against official OceanBase documentation.
