# Research note: The official Cline rules filename was verified against
# https://github.com/cline/cline and community documentation — `.clinerules`
# is the established convention Cline uses at the repository root to load
# project-specific rules and context for autonomous coding sessions.
# Confirm the current recommendation in the official documentation before
# deploying, as Cline's tooling evolves frequently.

# Agent Context — [Your Project Name]

## Project Purpose

<!--
  2-3 sentences describing what this project does, who it's for, and what
  problem it solves. Helps Cline understand the domain and make
  appropriate autonomous decisions.

  Example:
  "A REST API for inventory management used by warehouse operations teams.
  Built with Go and PostgreSQL. Handles ~10K requests/minute in production."
-->

[Describe your project here]

---

## Architecture

<!--
  Describe the high-level structure: major components, how they interact,
  key technology choices, and what patterns the codebase follows.

  Example:
  "Monorepo with packages/ for libraries and apps/ for services.
  All services communicate via gRPC with protobuf schemas in proto/.
  Shared utilities live in packages/common."
-->

- **Primary language:** [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust]
- **Framework/runtime:** [e.g., Next.js 14, FastAPI, Go stdlib]
- **Key dependencies:** [e.g., Prisma + PostgreSQL, Redis for caching]
- **Project structure:**

```
project-root/
├── src/              # Application source code
├── tests/            # Test files
├── docs/             # Documentation
└── ...
```

---

## Coding Conventions

<!--
  Rules Cline should follow when generating or modifying code.
  Be explicit — the agent has no way to infer unwritten conventions.
-->

- **Formatting:** [e.g., Prettier with default config; Black + isort for Python]
- **Naming:** [e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes, SCREAMING_SNAKE for constants]
- **Imports:** [e.g., absolute imports only; group as stdlib / third-party / local with blank lines between]
- **Types:** [e.g., strict TypeScript — no implicit `any`; type hints required on all public functions]
- **Comments:** [e.g., explain why, not what; JSDoc on all public APIs]

---

## Error Handling

<!--
  How errors should be surfaced, logged, and propagated.
-->

- [e.g., "Use typed error classes — never throw raw strings"]
- [e.g., "All async functions must have explicit try/catch or propagate via Result<T, E>"]
- [e.g., "Log errors at the point of origin; do not re-log at callers"]
- [e.g., "User-facing error messages must not expose internal stack traces"]

---

## Testing

<!--
  Test framework, file location conventions, naming conventions,
  and coverage expectations.
-->

- **Framework:** [e.g., Jest + Testing Library; pytest; Go testing]
- **Location:** [e.g., `__tests__/` next to source; `tests/` at root]
- **Naming:** [e.g., `*.test.ts`; `test_<module>.py`; `*_test.go`]
- **Coverage expectations:** [e.g., all public functions must have tests; 80% line coverage minimum]
- **Test data:** [e.g., fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`; factories in `tests/factories/`]

---

## Development Workflow

<!--
  Branch strategy, commit message format, PR requirements,
  and anything Cline should know when helping with git or CI tasks.
-->

- **Branches:** [e.g., `feature/<ticket>-<slug>`, `fix/<ticket>-<slug>`]
- **Commits:** [e.g., Conventional Commits — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`]
- **PRs:** [e.g., must link to issue; must pass CI; require one reviewer]
- **CI:** [e.g., GitHub Actions — lint, test, build on every push]
- **Local setup:** [e.g., `make dev` starts the dev server; `make test` runs the full suite]

---

## Parallelization Rules

<!--
  How work should be divided when multiple agents or tasks run concurrently.
  Prevents conflicts when Cline and other agents work in parallel across the codebase.
-->

- [e.g., "Each agent works in its own git worktree — never share a working directory"]
- [e.g., "Database migrations are sequential — only one agent may write migrations at a time"]
- [e.g., "Shared config files (package.json, pyproject.toml) require coordination — flag conflicts"]
- [e.g., "Generated files (OpenAPI, protobuf) are regenerated from source — do not edit directly"]

---

## Autonomy Guidelines

<!--
  Bounds for Cline's autonomous behavior. Cline can execute commands, write files,
  and take multi-step actions without manual approval at each step — these guidelines
  define what it may do freely, what requires confirmation, and what is off-limits.

  Example:
  "Cline may autonomously: run tests, install dev dependencies, create and edit source files,
  run linters and formatters, and make git commits on feature branches."

  "Cline must ask before: installing new production dependencies, modifying CI/CD configuration,
  changing environment variable definitions, or running database migrations."

  "Cline must never: push directly to main or production branches, delete non-generated files
  without confirmation, expose credentials or secrets in any file, or run commands that affect
  production infrastructure."
-->

- **Cline may autonomously:**
  - [e.g., "Run tests, linters, and formatters"]
