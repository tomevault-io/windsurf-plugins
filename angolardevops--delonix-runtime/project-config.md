# Delonix Runtime — agent rules

This repository's agent/AI-assistant rules live in a single canonical file: **[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)**
at the repository root. Read it before making changes — it covers the architecture (8 crates), the
CLI command surface, the i18n convention (English source + `pt.po` catalog, never inline
translations), the security-review history, and the "no dependency on private repos" boundary that
this public repo must never cross.

This file exists only so tools that look specifically for `.github/copilot-instructions.md` find a
pointer to the real rules, instead of nothing.
