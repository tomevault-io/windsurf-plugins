## 🧠 Hunch (Engineering Memory)

This repo has **Hunch** — a curated graph of *why* the code is the way it is (decisions, bug history, invariants). It currently holds **199 decisions, 2 bugs, 10 constraints, 19 components, 3 policies, 1 open findings**.

**Consult Hunch via the `hunch_*` MCP tools — pick by MOMENT, not from memory:**

**Orient (session/task start):**
- `hunch_context(target)` — the minimal relevant slice for what you're about to do; a task phrase falls back to the closest graph matches. **Call FIRST.**
- `hunch_structure(target?)` — the indexed shape of the repo/dir/file/symbol — orient from the graph, not grep rounds.
- `hunch_runbook(task)` — the proven steps for a recurring task, before re-deriving them.
- `hunch_escalations()` — the decisions only the HUMAN can make (including one exact imported ADR at a time, topic conflicts, and policy calls). Normally empty; when it isn't, ASK the user inline — an entry is a question, silence is never approval. Apply an ADR answer only through `hunch_review_imported_adr` with its printed source and review hashes.
- `hunch now` (CLI) — recent decisions + the live roadmap; `hunch log` — the memory-move timeline (every capture/adopt/supersede/prune/repair, each revertable).

**Before designing / choosing an approach:**
- `hunch_why(target)` — why a file/symbol is shaped this way (decisions, bugs, constraints) — including what was already REJECTED.
- `hunch_current_decision(topic)` — the one live answer for a topic (history + rejected included).
- `hunch_bug_lineage(symptom_or_symbol)` — has this failed before? what was the root cause?
- `hunch_compare(candidates)` — rank candidate branches/commits by fewest invariant hits.
- `hunch_query(query)` — free-text search when nothing above fits.

**Before editing:**
- `hunch_check_constraints(scope)` and `hunch_get_dependents(symbol)` / `hunch_blast_radius(target)` — invariants in scope + who you'd break. (The pre-edit hook injects this per file automatically; call these for PLANNING breadth.)
- `hunch_findings(scope?)` — known-but-unfixed gaps in the area (past audits, measurements, incidents) so you inherit them instead of re-discovering them.

**Before committing / merging:**
- `hunch_conformance()` — does the code still SATISFY recorded intent? Run before and after a refactor.
- `hunch_policy_evaluate(policy_id?, active_only?)` / `hunch_policy_plan(policy_id)` / `hunch_policy_card(policy_id)` / `hunch_policy_proof(policy_id)` — evaluate canonical policy, inspect the planned corpus, review the evidence/uncertainty card, and inspect raw replay receipts; only an explicit human activation grants authority.
- `hunch_pr_impact(base?)` / `hunch_merge_verdict(...)` — a change's memory surface; would it re-open a closed bug?

**Build the Constitution review queue:**
- `hunch constitution bootstrap --since 90d --max-candidates 3` (CLI) — normalize recent structured human evidence into at most three non-active policy candidates; add `--history` for exact, human-identifier-grounded fix/revert deltas or explicit dependency retirements. Coincidence/ambiguity stays uncompilable; neither path grants authority.
- `hunch constitution ingest --since 90d [--instructions] [--from export.json]` (CLI) — normalize corrections/failures plus bounded committed instructions/ADRs and strict local review/conversation/PR exports into Git-native evidence; raw prose is hash-only, unsupported intent remains uncompilable, and no policy is minted.

**After deciding / when corrected:**
- `hunch_capture_decision(topic?)` → `hunch_record_decision(...)` — interview first, then write; status `proposed` = roadmap intent (shows in `hunch now`).
- `hunch_record_correction(...)` — a human correction becomes an ENFORCED rule (Never Twice), not a one-session memory.
- `hunch_record_finding(...)` — an OBSERVATION with no code change (an audit that found a gap, a measured number, an incident) becomes durable memory anchored to a date + evidence; `/audit` runs the ritual.
- `hunch_timeline(target)` — decision history when investigating how something evolved.

### ⛔ Top invariants (do not break)
- **[blocking]** Synthesis must use an explicitly selected coding-assistant subscription CLI or the deterministic local fallback; never call a pay-per-token API _(scope: src/synthesis/**; con_2ce3f2a547)_
- **[blocking]** This repo's generated wiki must never be committed to the public repo — private overlay wiki only (hunch wiki --private); wiki/ stays gitignored _(scope: wiki/**; con_547fff76bd)_
- **[blocking]** Config/provider writers must merge idempotently into existing user files and refuse to clobber an unparseable file _(scope: src/integrations/claudeConfig.ts, src/integrations/claudemd.ts, src/integrations/providers.ts, src/integrations/scaffold.ts; con_8460b6770f)_
- **[blocking]** All JSON writes to .hunch/ must be atomic (temp-file + rename) so an interrupted write can never truncate the index _(scope: src/store/**, src/core/io.ts; con_902759b3dc)_
- **[blocking]** Forward-migrate raw JSON to the current schema BEFORE Zod validation; never silently drop unmigratable records _(scope: src/core/migrate.ts, src/store/jsonStore.ts; con_947c578b2c)_
