# AGENTS.md (operator)

See the [root AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for repo-wide setup and PR guidelines. This file adds rules specific to `operator/`.

## Layout

- `api/aistore/v1beta1/` — `AIStore` CRD types and validation.
- `api/aisauth/v1alpha1/` — `AIStoreAuth` and `AIStoreAuthProfile` CRD types and validation.
- `internal/controller/` — reconcile loops, one subdirectory per CRD group (`aistore`, `aisauth`).
- `internal/resources/` — builds the K8s objects the controllers apply: `aistore/{proxy,target,adminclient,cmn}`, `aisauth/` (AuthN deployment, ConfigMap, services, volumes, plus its `config/` types), `certificates`, `ownerref`.
- `internal/services/` — clients the operator uses at runtime: AIS API (`aisapi.go`), auth token exchange (`auth_api.go`, `auth_profile.go`), TLS client config.
- `internal/webhook/` — admission webhooks, one subdirectory per CRD group (`aistore/v1beta1`, `aisauth/v1alpha1`).
- `internal/client/`, `internal/svcaddr/`, `internal/truststore/`, `internal/opinfo/` — smaller shared helpers (K8s client wrapper, service address resolution, CA trust pool, cluster domain and operator identity).
- `config/` — kustomize manifests. `make manifests` writes generated CRD, RBAC, and webhook YAML into `config/base/`. `config/overlays/` holds the `default`, `helm`, `certmanager`, `metrics`, and `test` overlays. `config/samples/` holds example CRs, one per resource or scenario.
- `cmd/main.go` — entrypoint.
- `tests/` — E2E specs (`e2e/`), shared test helpers (`tutils/`), in-cluster CI runner (`ci/`).
- `scripts/` — shell helpers the Makefile calls for tests, lint, and tool installation.

## Development Workflow (Operator)

```bash
cd operator
go mod download
```

Make targets:

```bash
make build      # go build the manager binary
make run        # run the controller against the cluster in ~/.kube/config
make manifests  # regenerate CRD/RBAC/webhook YAML from kubebuilder markers
make generate   # regenerate deepcopy/mock code
```

`build`, `run`, `test`, and `test-e2e` each depend on `manifests` and `generate`, so they rewrite generated files. `build` and `run` also depend on `fmt` and `vet`, so they reformat the tree.

If you change types under `api/`, run `make generate` and `make manifests`, then regenerate the Helm chart. Pass the version the chart already declares:

```bash
make build-installer-helm VERSION=<current version in helm/ais-operator/Chart.yaml>
```

`build-installer-helm` rewrites `.version` and `.appVersion` in `helm/ais-operator/Chart.yaml` and the image tag in `config/overlays/default/kustomization.yaml`. Pass a different version only during a release. `make build-installer` writes `dist/ais-operator.yaml`, which is gitignored and needed only at release time.

## Testing Instructions

Run from `operator/`. Full details: `tests/README.md`.

Unit tests live beside the code they cover, as one ginkgo suite per package (`*_suite_test.go` bootstraps the suite). A `*_internal_test.go` file uses the package under test for white-box coverage.

```bash
make test                                       # unit tests
make kind-setup                                 # create a local kind cluster for E2E
make test-e2e-bootstrap                         # install E2E test dependencies
make test-e2e-in-cluster                        # run E2E tests inside the cluster
AIS_TEST_API_MODE=public make test-e2e          # run E2E tests from outside the cluster
TEST_E2E_MODE=manual make test-e2e-in-cluster   # include ginkgo `manual`-labeled specs
make test-e2e-teardown                          # tear down E2E dependencies
make kind-teardown                              # delete the kind cluster
```

E2E test behavior is configurable via environment variables (test images, storage class, API mode) — see the table in `tests/README.md`.

To iterate on a single package or spec, call ginkgo directly instead of `make test`:

```bash
ginkgo ./internal/services                          # one package
ginkgo --focus "<spec text>" ./internal/services    # one spec
```

The suites in `internal/controller/aistore/` and `api/aistore/v1beta1/` start envtest and need `KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS`; use `make test` for those.

## Code Style Guidelines

Run from `operator/`:

```bash
make lint       # golangci-lint
make lint-fix   # golangci-lint with autofix
make fmt-check  # go mod tidy check, copyright headers, import block spacing
make fmt-fix    # gofmt -s -w only
make check-gen  # verify config/ and helm/ais-operator/ match the generators
```

`make fmt-fix` fixes nothing that `make fmt-check` reports. Fix those by hand: run `go mod tidy`, add the file header, or collapse the blank lines in the `import` block.

- Every `.go` file needs a `Copyright ... NVIDIA CORPORATION. All rights reserved.` line within its first 10 lines, or `// no-copyright`. Copy the header from a neighboring file.
- An `import` block may hold at most one blank line.

`make check-gen` diffs `config/` and `helm/ais-operator/` against `HEAD`, so commit regenerated manifests before you run it.

CI runs `make lint`, `make fmt-check`, and `make check-gen` on every operator change — run these locally before committing.
