# AGENTS.md

Must read [README.md](README.md) first.

This project uses the mloda framework. Assume any given task is related to mloda.

## Environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Dependencies

Use `uv` to install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

## Running checks

Use `tox` to run all checks:
```bash
tox
```

Run checks from the project virtualenv:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && tox
```

`tox` is the required final verification step after code or dependency changes.
Running only `pytest` is not sufficient for completion.

### Run individual checks

```bash
pytest
ruff format --check --line-length 120 .
ruff check .
mypy --strict --ignore-missing-imports .
bandit -c pyproject.toml -r -q .
```

## Commit messages

Use Conventional Commit format for all commits so semantic versioning/release tooling can parse intent.
Do not include `Co-Authored-By` lines or any other mention of AI agents in commit messages.

Examples:
- `fix: handle empty feature set`
- `chore(deps): bump mloda to 0.4.6`

## Claude Code Skills

The mloda-registry provides Claude Code skills that assist with plugin development:

- https://github.com/mloda-ai/mloda-registry/tree/main/.claude/skills/

When helping with FeatureGroups, ComputeFrameworks, or Extenders, leverage these skills for pattern guidance and best practices.

## Project Practices

`tox` is the gate. It runs `pytest`, then `ruff format --check`, `ruff check`, `mypy --strict --ignore-missing-imports`, and `bandit`. All of these must pass before a PR is mergeable. CVE scanning lives in a separate `tox -e security` environment that runs `pip-audit`; it is not part of the PR merge gate. Scheduled CVE scanning is left to GitHub's native Dependabot security alerts, with `tox -e security` available for on-demand local scans.

- **Python**: supported range is `>=3.10`. The default tox env is `python310`.
- **Type hints**: use modern forms (`list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, `X | None`).
- **Formatting**: ruff format with line length 120.
- **Tests**: every new feature or bug fix must come with tests; follow the patterns in the existing `open_kgo/.../tests/` trees.
- **Test contract harness (in-repo, not a published library)**: KG connectors are tested via a shared, inherited contract suite, the same pattern mloda-registry uses, but it currently lives **inside this repo** and is **not** packaged or published for external reuse (unlike mloda-registry's separate `mloda-testing` package). Structure: a universal `KgConnectorContractBase` in `open_kgo/feature_groups/kg/tests/kg_contract.py`, a per-family `<Family>ContractTestBase` in each `open_kgo/feature_groups/kg/<family>/tests/kg_<family>_contract.py`, the shared `run_query`/`make_valid_credentials` helpers in `open_kgo/feature_groups/kg/tests/_helpers.py` (reader discovery in `_discovery.py`), and the resource-cache loaders in the production module `open_kgo/feature_groups/kg/fixtures.py` (caches cleared per-test by `open_kgo/feature_groups/kg/conftest.py`). A holistic all-family smoke plus cross-family gap diagnostics live in `open_kgo/feature_groups/kg/tests/test_kg_usage_smoke.py`, `test_kg_registry_integrity.py`, and `test_kg_catalog_declarations.py`, all over the shared `_family_cases.py` registry. Each concrete plugin's test class subclasses its family base and supplies a few small adapter methods. When adding a connector, extend the existing family base rather than writing standalone tests. Note also that, unlike mloda-registry, there is no framework-adapter-mixin layer and no single canonical fixture dataset.
- **Supply chain**: `[tool.uv] exclude-newer = "7 days"` in `pyproject.toml` defers new dependency releases by 7 days; `exclude-newer-package` pins mloda, mloda-testing, and mloda-registry to a longer window. Do not edit these without a reason.
- **Commits**: use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `perf:`). semantic-release computes the next version: `feat:` triggers a minor bump, all other types trigger a patch bump (see `.releaserc.yaml`).

## Issue Creation

When filing a GitHub issue (via `gh issue create` or otherwise), follow the structure in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue.yml`:

- Summary in one sentence
- Reproduction (for bugs) or motivation (for features)
- Code pointers if relevant (`file:line`)
- Definition of done if scoped (what counts as complete)

Issues that meet this bar are eligible for the `good first issue` label without further sharpening.
