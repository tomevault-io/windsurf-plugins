# Repository Guidelines

Read `dev/source_reproduction_protocol.md` after every context compaction.
Before editing `crates/cosmolkit-core/`, the operation registry, topology
operations, or macro-controlled operation machinery, read `dev/README.md`.

## Project Structure

- `crates/cosmolkit-core/`: current molecular graph, state, operation, IO, and
  chemistry core.
- `crates/cosmolkit-macros/`: proc macros for operation bodies, registries, and
  generated tables.
- `crates/cosmolkit/`: Rust facade and top-level public API.
- `python/`: PyO3 bindings, Python packaging, examples, and docs.
- `crates/<crate>/tests/`: public integration, regression, and parity tests for
  the owning crate.
- `testdata/`: shared committed fixtures/corpora and generated expected-data
  locations; see `dev/repository_organization_policy.md`.
- `tools/testdata/`: explicit reference-data preparation entrypoints.
- `dev/`: normative design documents and development operating rules.

Keep public APIs in `lib.rs` or narrow public modules. Keep implementation
helpers private unless there is a deliberate public API reason.

## Source Reproduction

Ports from RDKit, Gemmi, OpenBabel, or other C/C++ libraries must follow
`dev/source_reproduction_protocol.md`.

- Do not implement ported chemistry or structural-biology behavior by
  heuristic approximation.
- Copy the relevant original source lines into the corresponding Rust function
  as review anchors.
- Use the required two-axis source markers for behavior and complexity status.
- Unsupported source behavior must return structured unsupported errors or stay
  marked unsupported; do not hide gaps behind silent fallbacks.

## Operation System

Topology-related public molecule operations must go through `molecule_ops!` and
the operation-contract machinery. Do not bypass `TopologyOnlyParts`, direct
mutable storage, generated registries, or invariant checks.

The generated registry and matrices are the source of truth:

```text
MOLECULE_OPS
SUPPORT_MATRIX
OPERATION_INVARIANT_MATRIX
PARITY_MATRIX
```

Mutation of public `Molecule` values must be explicit:

- Non-mutating methods return new molecule values.
- Public in-place `Molecule` operations must end with trailing `_`.
- No public `Molecule` method may use trailing `_` for any other meaning.

Code comments that define operation requirements, agent guardrails, or
human-author approval requirements are binding project rules. If a requested
change appears to require violating such a comment, stop and ask for explicit
human-author approval.

## Required Validation

For core, topology-operation, or operation-registry changes, use strict checks:

```bash
cargo check -p cosmolkit-core --features op-contracts-strict
cargo test -p cosmolkit-core --release --features op-contracts-strict
```

For cross-crate changes, also run:

```bash
cargo test --workspace --release --features cosmolkit-core/op-contracts-strict
```

Small focused test filters may use the default debug profile while iterating.
Large local runs, parity suites, and CI test runs should use release mode with
the same strict feature set. Release-mode testing must not relax operation
contracts or runtime invariants; those checks are controlled by
`op-contracts-strict`.

Plain `cargo check -p cosmolkit-core` is acceptable only as a quick syntax pass.
Run formatting after Rust edits:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
```

Release builds should use default features unless runtime checks are explicitly
requested:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Python Tooling

Use project-level `uv` environment management from the repository root:

```bash
uv sync --group dev
.venv/bin/maturin develop --manifest-path python/Cargo.toml
.venv/bin/pytest
```

Generate stubs with:

```bash
cargo run -p cosmolkit-py --no-default-features --features dev-stub --bin stub_gen
```

The generated file is `python/cosmolkit.pyi`; do not edit it by hand.

Build docs and run type checks with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m sphinx -b html python/docs/source python/docs/build/html
.venv/bin/basedpyright python/tests python/examples
```

Python APIs should follow the current Rust core API, should not expose internal
helpers, and should not preserve superseded compatibility behavior unless there
is an explicit public API decision.

## Coding And Testing

Use Rust 2024 defaults: 4-space indentation, `snake_case` functions/modules,
`CamelCase` types/traits, and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` constants.

Prefer narrow modules and explicit types. Do not expose mutable molecule storage
through public APIs.

Place unit tests near code with `mod tests`; use integration tests under
`tests/` when a cross-module fixture is needed. Name tests by behavior, for
example `kekulize_handles_fused_aromatics`.

For operation changes, tests should run under `op-contracts-strict`. Unsupported
behavior should return structured unsupported errors, not panic, silently no-op,
or emit placeholder chemistry.

## Commits

Use Conventional Commits, for example:

```text
feat: add sdf streaming parser
fix: correct aromatic valence handling
```

Keep commits focused and buildable where practical. PR descriptions should
include scope, validation steps, fixture notes, linked issues when applicable,
and support-status or parity-policy changes.
