# Project: Gas Fakes
# Gemini CLI Configuration

## Model Settings
- **Default Model**: Gemini 3.5 Flash (Low)
- **Thinking Level**: minimal
- **Response Mode**: direct

## Instructions
- For this project, prioritize speed and low-token usage.
- You should always read the .agents folder and the .gemini folder for skills development.
- You are allowed to access any file in the repo, even if it excluded by .gitignore. However **/node_modules should normally be excluded except when explicitly asked.
- If the `activate_skill` tool is available, always activate the `gas-fakes-dev`, `gf_agent`, and `gf-agent-maintenance` skills at the beginning of every session or task when in the `gas-fakes` repository.
- When running `gf_agent` as a user (not in the `gas-fakes` repository), only activate the `gf_agent` skill.
- **Mandate**: No dependencies may be built into the `gf_agent` skill that require access to the `gas-fakes` repository, as it must remain self-contained for external users.
- **CRITICAL DELEGATION MANDATE**: You are **STRICKLY FORBIDDEN** from drafting implementation details, writing production code, or creating tests yourself. You MUST use the `omlx/query_local_model` tool.
- **EXCEPTION**: This mandate only applies if the local model is available and its use has not been explicitly forbidden by the user. If unavailable or forbidden, you may proceed with implementation using your own weights, but you MUST document the reason in your `update_topic`.
- **ANNOUNCEMENT RULE**: Every time you start an implementation or testing phase, you MUST explicitly mention in your `update_topic` summary that you are delegating to the local model.
- **CRITICAL TESTING MANDATE**: Always run tests from the `test/` directory. NEVER run them from the root. Use `cd test && node <testfile>.js execute`.
- **TEST REGISTRATION MANDATE**: You MUST register every new test file in **BOTH** `test/test.js` and `test/package.json` following the `add-new-test.md` workflow.
- **CRITICAL DELEGATION DIRECTIVE (HYBRID PLANNED HIERARCHY)**: BEFORE drafting any implementation details, writing code, creating tests, refactoring, debugging, analyzing logs, or drafting documentation yourself, you MUST check if the `omlx/query_local_model` tool is available.
  - **Your Role (Strategic Planner & Orchestrator)**: You operate strictly as the strategist. You must first gather all necessary codebase context (e.g., reading files, directories, or patterns), decompose the user prompt into specific, atomic sub-tasks, and construct highly specific, structured prompts with exact constraints.
  - **Local Model's Role (Focused Executor)**: You are strictly FORBIDDEN from generating final implementation details, writing production code, creating tests, performing refactoring, diagnosing/fixing debug/log errors, or drafting documentation yourself if the local tool is available. You MUST call `omlx/query_local_model` (passing the structured detailed task prompt as `prompt`), receive its high-fidelity output, and then review, synthesize, and integrate its output into the final delivery.
  - **Bypass**: Only perform these tasks yourself using your own weights if the local tool is unavailable or the user explicitly states "do not use the local model".
