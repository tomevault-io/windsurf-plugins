# Engineering Standards for Senior Python Development

These standards define how Python code should be generated across this repository to ensure readability, reliability, and production readiness.

---

## 1. Core Principles

### Clarity and Maintainability
- Prefer explicit, intention-revealing code over cleverness.
- Optimize for readability first; optimize performance only when there is evidence of a bottleneck.
- Keep functions/classes focused on a single responsibility.

### Production Readiness
- Code must include robust error handling and observable behavior.
- Runtime behavior should be debuggable through structured logging.
- Interfaces must be type-safe and static-analysis friendly.

### Documentation Discipline
- Every public module, class, and function must include a concise docstring covering:
  - Short purpose
  - key side effects (if any)
  - high-level error behavior (if relevant)

---

## 2. Python Language and Style

### Type Hints (Required)
- Fully type all function signatures, method signatures, and class attributes.
- Use Python 3.10+ syntax (`str | None`, `list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`).
- Keep code compatible with `mypy`/`pyright` expectations.

### Preferred Language Features
- Use `dataclasses` for simple immutable domain containers when appropriate.
- Use `match` when it improves clarity.
- Use context managers for resources (files, sessions, locks, network clients).

### Strings and Filesystem
- Use `pathlib.Path` for filesystem operations.
- Use f-strings for regular string interpolation.

### Imports

- Follow PEP 8 import order: standard library, third-party, then local/project imports, with one blank line between groups.
- **Placement:** Place all imports at the top of the file immediately after the module docstring and before constants, classes, or functions.
- **Grouping:** Group imports in three sections with one blank line between groups: standard library, third-party, local/project imports.
- **Ordering:** Sort imports within each group alphabetically. Use `isort` to enforce automatically.
- **Style:** Prefer absolute imports. Avoid wildcard imports (`from module import *`) and avoid deep relative imports when possible.
- **Unused & Linting:** Remove unused imports. Enforce with `ruff`/`flake8`/`pylint` in CI.
- **Type-only imports:** For imports used only for typing that are expensive or cause cycles, use `if TYPE_CHECKING:` or `from __future__ import annotations` and `typing.TYPE_CHECKING`.
- **Conditional imports:** When importing conditionally (platform, optional dependency), add a short comment explaining why.
- **Shared models:** Import shared models at module level.
- **No lazy-import helpers:** Do not use lazy-import helper functions for shared models. Only defer imports when required to avoid a verified import cycle or an expensive optional dependency, and document the reason briefly.
- **Example:**

```
# module docstring

import logging
import math

from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.requests import Request

from myproject.utils import helper_function
```

### Logging (Mandatory, Non-Negotiable)
**Hard Rule:** All runtime logging must use Python's standard library `logging` module.

- Use module-level loggers only:
  - `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- Do not use `print()` for runtime diagnostics.
- Do not use third-party logging libraries (e.g., `loguru`) unless explicitly requested.
- Log call message templates must be literal strings.
- Use `%`-style parameterized logging for dynamic values:
  - `logger.info("Processed %s records", count)`
- Never use f-strings in logging calls.
- Log failures with context using `logger.exception(...)`.

### String Formatting Precedence
- Use f-strings for non-logging strings.
- Logging calls are the explicit exception and must use `%`-style placeholders.
- If any conflict exists, logging rules take precedence for all `logger.*(...)` calls.

### Global State
- Avoid mutable module-level state.
- Constants must be uppercase and typed.

## 3. Data Modeling and Validation

### Default Modeling Strategy (Mandatory)
**Hard Rule:** Prefer `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for application/domain configuration and internal data structures.

**Modeling Precedence Rule:** If both dataclass and Pydantic are possible, choose `@dataclass(frozen=True)` unless boundary parsing/serialization explicitly requires Pydantic.

- Use dataclasses as the default for:
  - internal DTOs
  - domain models
  - settings/config objects (unless a framework requires otherwise)
- Prefer immutability:
  - `@dataclass(frozen=True)`
- Validate invariants in `__post_init__`.
- Keep validation deterministic and side-effect free.
- Do not place business logic in model validation methods.

### When Pydantic Is Allowed
- Use `pydantic.BaseModel` only at external boundaries where schema parsing/serialization is required:
  - FastAPI request/response models
  - external payload parsing
- If Pydantic is used, prefer strict mode and explicit schemas:
  - `model_config = ConfigDict(strict=True, extra="forbid")`
- Do not use Pydantic for internal domain models by default.
