## Build / Lint / Test Commands

**Not applicable** — This is a content-only repository with no executable code.

Verify manually:
- YAML frontmatter is valid
- `name` field matches directory name exactly
- `name` is 1-64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only
- `description` is 1-1024 characters

## Agent Skills Specification

Skills follow the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification.md).

### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What this skill does and when to use it. Include trigger phrases.
---
```

### Frontmatter Field Constraints

| Field         | Required | Constraints                                                      |
|---------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | Yes      | 1-64 chars, lowercase `a-z`, numbers, hyphens. Must match dir.   |
| `description` | Yes      | 1-1024 chars. Describe what it does and when to use it.          |
| `license`     | No       | License name (default: MIT)                                      |
| `metadata`    | No       | Key-value pairs (author, version, etc.)                          |

### Name Field Rules

- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Cannot start or end with hyphen
- No consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Must match parent directory name exactly

**Valid**: `deep-customer-research`, `icp-discovery`, `facebook-ad-copy`
**Invalid**: `Deep-Customer-Research`, `-icp`, `facebook--ad`

### Optional Skill Directories

```
skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md        # Required - main instructions (<500 lines)
├── references/     # Optional - detailed docs loaded on demand
├── scripts/        # Optional - executable code
└── assets/         # Optional - templates, data files
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Structure

- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines (move details to `references/`)
- Use H2 (`##`) for main sections, H3 (`###`) for subsections
- Use bullet points and numbered lists liberally
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)

### Tone

- Direct and instructional
- Second person ("You are a customer research expert")
- Professional but approachable

### Formatting

- Bold (`**text**`) for key terms
- Code blocks for `ask_twins` examples
- Tables for reference data
- No excessive emojis

### Clarity Principles

- Clarity over cleverness
- Specific over vague
- Active voice over passive
- One idea per section

### Description Field Best Practices

The `description` is critical for skill discovery. Include:
1. What the skill does
2. When to use it (trigger phrases)
3. Related skills for scope boundaries

```yaml
description: Use this skill to conduct deep qualitative customer research. Triggers include requests to understand customer pain points, unmet needs, motivations. For ICP discovery, see icp-discovery.
```

## Claude Code Plugin

This repo also serves as a plugin marketplace. The manifest at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists all skills for installation via:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ovlabs/audienceresearchskills
/plugin install audience-research-skills
```

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat: add skill-name skill`
- `fix: improve clarity in deep-customer-research`
- `docs: update README`

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] `name` matches directory name exactly
- [ ] `name` follows naming rules (lowercase, hyphens, no `--`)
- [ ] `description` is 1-1024 chars with trigger phrases
- [ ] `SKILL.md` is under 500 lines
- [ ] `ask_twins` calls use well-crafted, open-ended questions

## Tool Integrations

All skills in this repository use the OriginalVoices Digital Twins API via the `ask_twins` function.

- **Tool discovery**: Read `tools/REGISTRY.md` for capabilities
- **MCP-enabled**: OriginalVoices is available as an MCP server

### When to Use Tools

Every skill uses `ask_twins` to gather audience insight before generating outputs. The research step is what makes these skills different from generic AI generation.

## Checking for Updates

When using any skill from this repository:

1. **Once per session**, on first skill use, check for updates:
