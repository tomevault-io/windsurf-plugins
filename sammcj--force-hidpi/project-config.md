# Force HiDPI

macOS menu bar app (Swift/SwiftPM) that creates a CGVirtualDisplay and hardware-mirrors a 4K panel from it to bypass the M4/M5 DCP pipe budget limitation.

## Project structure

- `Sources/ForceHiDPI/main.swift` - App entry point, AppDelegate, NSStatusItem menu
- `Sources/ForceHiDPI/DisplayManager.swift` - Display enumeration, virtual display lifecycle, mirror config, PQ gamma, colour profile matching, SkyLight dlopen bridge
- `Sources/ForceHiDPI/BrightnessController.swift` - DDC/CI brightness control over IOAVService (ported from MonitorControl's Arm64DDC). Resolves one `IOAVService` for the mirror-target physical display; coalesces rapid slider writes on a background queue
- `Sources/ForceHiDPI/HotKey.swift` - Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` wrapper for global shortcuts without requiring Accessibility permission
- `Sources/ForceHiDPI/ShortcutWindow.swift` - Preferences window and shortcut-recorder view for rebinding brightness hotkeys
- `Sources/ForceHiDPI/BrightnessSliderView.swift` - Custom NSView hosting the brightness slider inside an NSMenuItem
- `Sources/CPrivateAPI/` - ObjC bridging module for CGVirtualDisplay + IOAVService + CoreDisplay private API declarations
- `Makefile` - build/install/uninstall targets
- `com.force-hidpi.plist` - LaunchAgent template (binary path substituted at install time)

## Versioning

Version is defined in `main.swift` as `appVersion`. Uses semantic versioning (major.minor.patch).

When to increment:

- **Patch** (1.0.x): Bug fixes, minor tweaks, no behaviour change
- **Minor** (1.x.0): New features, new menu options, non-breaking changes
- **Major** (x.0.0): Breaking changes, API changes to CGVirtualDisplay usage, major rewrites

You **MUST** update the version string in `main.swift` when you have completed making changes that warrant a version bump!

## Build

```bash
make build        # release
make build-debug  # debug
make install      # install + start (restarts if already running)
```

## Key technical details

- `CGVirtualDisplay` is a semi-public CoreGraphics API (used by DisplayLink). Declared via a Clang module in `Sources/CPrivateAPI/` since there are no public headers
- SkyLight framework functions (BitsPerSample, HDR status, colour space) are resolved at runtime via `dlopen`/`dlsym` with `@convention(c)` typed function pointers
- The virtual display mode uses `transferFunction: 1` (PQ/ST 2084) for 16-bit compositing. A PQ-to-SDR gamma correction table is applied via `CGSetDisplayTransferByTable`
- Mirror config uses `.forSession` (not `.permanently`) so a crash doesn't leave displays stuck
- Duplicate instance prevention uses `flock` on `/tmp/force-hidpi.lock`
- Settings persist via a plist file at `~/Library/Preferences/com.force-hidpi.plist` (UserDefaults suiteName silently fails for non-bundled executables on modern macOS)
- The "Start at Login" toggle generates a LaunchAgent plist pointing to the current binary path (not hardcoded)
- Brightness control uses **DDC/CI over `IOAVService`** (Apple-Silicon replacement for `IOFramebufferService`). `BrightnessController.resolve(displayID:)` walks the IORegistry for `AppleCLCD2`/`IOMobileFramebufferShim` + `DCPAVServiceProxy` pairs and scores matches against `CoreDisplay_DisplayCreateInfoDictionary`. The matched service is cached and re-resolved on display reconfiguration. Writes are dispatched on a background queue and coalesce to the latest pending value, so slider drags never queue more than one write at a time
- Global hotkeys use Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`, **not** `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents` — the Carbon path does not require the Accessibility permission and dispatches in-process via `InstallEventHandler` on the event dispatcher target
- Carbon modifier flags (`cmdKey`, `optionKey`, `controlKey`, `shiftKey`) are distinct from Cocoa `NSEvent.ModifierFlags`; `HotKey.Combo` bridges between them. Don't pass Cocoa flags to `RegisterEventHotKey` or vice-versa

## Dangerous APIs / what not to do

Hard-won lessons from SkyLight spelunking. Do not repeat these.

- **Never call `SLSConfigureDisplayIndependentOutput`.** Despite its name suggesting a runtime-only config call, it writes an `IndependentOutput: true` flag into `~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver.displays.<UUID>.plist` that persists across reboots, logouts, and monitor power-cycles. Once set, affected displays refuse to participate in a hardware mirror set — they go black and disappear from device enumeration. There's no documented API to un-set it. Recovery requires editing the WindowServer plist by hand (walk `DisplaySets.Configs[*].DisplayConfig[*]` and delete the `IndependentOutput` key) and logging out. `.forSession` scope does NOT protect you here.
