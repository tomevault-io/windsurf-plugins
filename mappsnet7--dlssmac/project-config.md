# Repository conventions

Use neutral branch names. The primary branch is `main`. The user explicitly
prohibits naming branches after an assistant, model or tool (including the
`codex/` prefix). Follow explicit user branch names when provided.

End-user releases must be prebuilt applications. Do not make users install
Python, compilers, command-line dependencies or edit Wine registry entries by
hand. Keep source-build documentation separate from the normal installation flow.
Do not publish the repository or release assets without the user's instruction.
