# Spettro agent manifest

Spettro supports a project-level agent manifest at:

- `spettro.agents.toml`

If the file is missing, Spettro uses an internal default manifest.

## Goals

This file lets you define, in one place:

- which agents exist
- what each agent is good at
- which tools each agent can use
- what actions each tool and agent is allowed to perform
- handoff relationships between agents
- runtime safety defaults

## Schema

### Root fields

- `version` (int, required): schema version, currently `10`. Older manifests
  are migrated on load (with a `.bak` backup): v3 rewrites the previously
  inert `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` default to `full-access` (the
  field is now enforced — re-set it explicitly if you want the OS sandbox);
  later versions retrofit new built-in tools (v5 `view-image`, v6
  `hover`/`rename-symbol`, v7 `repo-search`, v8 the
  `pty-start`/`pty-write`/`pty-kill` interactive terminal tools, granted to
  agents that already hold `shell-exec`, v9 `tool-output` for agents that
  already hold `file-read`, v10 `ask-user`). Each retrofit widens only
  allow-lists that already show the same level of trust, so a deliberately
  restricted agent is never opened up.
- `default_agent` (string, required): agent ID to start from.
- `[metadata]` (table, optional): human-facing metadata.
- `[runtime]` (table, required): global execution defaults.
- `[[tools]]` (array of tables, required): tool registry.
- `[[agents]]` (array of tables, required): callable agents.

### `[runtime]`

- `default_permission`: one of `ask-first`, `restricted`, `yolo`.
- `default_timeout_sec`: positive integer.
- `sandbox_mode`: `off`/`full-access` (no OS sandbox, default), `workspace-write`
  (writes confined to workspace + temp, reads confined to system + workspace),
  or `read-only` (also blocks workspace writes). Enforced via Seatbelt (macOS) /
  Landlock (Linux) for shell commands AND in-process for the `file-write`/
  `file-edit` tools, and the spettro process is write-confined as a backstop.
  The boundary is invisible to the model (no tool, no prompt hint); overridable
  with the `--sandbox` CLI flag. See `docs/configuration.md`.
- `sandbox_net`: optional network policy for sandboxed commands: `all`
  (default), `localhost`, `none`, or `ports:443,8080`. CLI: `--sandbox-net`.
- `sandbox_allow_dirs`: optional extra writable roots inside the sandbox.
  CLI: `--sandbox-allow-dir` (repeatable).
- `sandbox_allow_read_dirs`: optional extra readable-only roots (e.g. a
  toolchain cache outside the workspace when reads are confined).
  CLI: `--sandbox-allow-read-dir` (repeatable).
- `log_tool_calls`: boolean.
- `permission_rules`: optional layered policy rules (`permission`, `pattern`, `action`).
- `[runtime.delegation]`: defaults for `max_parallel_workers` and `max_depth`.

### `[[tools]]`

- `id` (required, unique)
- `name` (required)
- `description`
- `kind`: `builtin`, `mcp`, `script`, `http`
- `enabled`: boolean
- `entry_point`: required when `kind` is `mcp`, `script`, or `http`
- `timeout_sec`: positive integer
- `requires_approval`: boolean
- `permitted_actions`: non-empty string list, e.g. `read`, `write`, `search`, `execute`, `git`, `chat`, `network`
- `aliases`: optional alternate tool IDs
- `input_schema`: optional JSON-like schema metadata
- `risk_level`: optional `low|medium|high`
- `primary_only`: optional boolean (only primary/orchestrator agents can use)
- `permission_rules`: optional tool-scoped policy rules

### `[[agents]]`

- `id` (required, unique)
- `name` (required)
- `description`
- `skill` (short capability keyword)
- `mode` (e.g. `planning`, `coding`, `chat`, `custom`)
- `role`: `primary`, `subagent`, `orchestrator`, or `worker`
- `model_provider` / `model` (optional override; fallback is active UI model)
- `system_prompt` or `prompt_file`
- `allowed_tools`: non-empty tool ID list
- `permitted_actions`: action list for high-level policy
- `permission`: `ask-first`, `restricted`, or `yolo`
- `temperature`, `max_tokens`
- `permission_rules`: optional agent-scoped policy rules
- `handoffs`: list of target agent IDs
- `enabled`: boolean

`allowed_tools` and `permitted_actions` are both filters: a tool is callable
only when its ID is allow-listed *and* the agent holds at least one of the
tool's `permitted_actions`. An allow-listed tool whose action family the agent
lacks is silently unavailable to the model.

### Asking the user a question

`ask-user` is the only way an agent can put a decision back to the person
driving it. It is granted to the agents a human converses with directly — the
`primary` and `orchestrator` roles, i.e. `plan`, `coding`, and `ask` in the
default manifest — and withheld from workers and subagents (`code` included):
their runs inherit the parent's callback, so a nested worker's question would
interrupt the user mid-orchestration with no context about who is asking.

Granting it to another agent takes both halves: `"ask-user"` in
`allowed_tools` and `"ask"` in `permitted_actions`.

One call carries a **form**, not a single question: an ordered list of up to 4
questions, each with a short `header` (the tab label, unique within the form and
the key the answer comes back under), the question line, up to 8 options
