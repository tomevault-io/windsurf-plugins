# SeedhiBaat

SeedhiBaat is a self-hosted WhatsApp marketing automation system. Its Python
CLI is the operator interface; its Go daemon receives Meta and Shopify
webhooks, runs durable YAML workflows, and stores state in SQLite. There is no
browser UI.

## Operating rules

- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical project instruction file.
- Canonical project skills live in `.agents/skills/`.
- Never place access tokens, app secrets, customer data, signing keys, or
  verification tokens in source, examples, commands committed to Git, logs,
  test fixtures, or chat responses.
- Treat every message operation as a dry run unless the user explicitly asks
  for a live send.
- Before every live send, state the exact template, validated message count,
  and unique recipient count. Require explicit approval for those values.
- Never add `--send --yes`, `--submit --yes`, campaign activation, production
  workflow activation, or `--allow-resend` based on implied intent.
- The only authorized live test recipient is the number designated by the
  repository owner. Never copy that number into tracked files or fixtures.
- Never activate a customer-facing campaign or always-on production workflow
  until its audience definition, exclusions, templates, timing, frequency cap,
  and frozen recipient count have been shown to and explicitly approved by the
  user.
- Preserve `state/sends.ndjson` and the SQLite database. Both protect against
  duplicate sends.
- Meta API acceptance is only `accepted`; never describe it as sent,
  delivered, or read without the corresponding verified webhook.
- Marketing use cases must be submitted as `MARKETING`. Do not attempt to
  influence or bypass Meta classification.
- Keep both production gates off by default:
  `SEEDHIBAAT_OUTBOUND_SENDING_ENABLED=false` and
  `SEEDHIBAAT_PRODUCTION_FLOW_ENABLED=false`.
- Preview and report commands must never display phone numbers, decrypted PII,
  or rendered private template parameters.
- Preserve Wallfacer and unrelated VPS services. SeedhiBaat owns only its
  dedicated service, user, directories, loopback port, and Nginx virtual host.
- Preserve the verified test WABA/phone profile separately from the active
  profile until production identity and access have been proven.
- Manual replay is limited to failed jobs. Never replay an accepted or unknown
  Meta outcome; reconcile it first to avoid a duplicate.

## Development

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
go test -race -timeout 90s ./...
go vet ./...
python3 tools/privacy_scan.py
git diff --check
```

Run the no-network load test with:

```bash
go run ./cmd/seedhibaat-loadtest 10000
```

The SeedhiBaat skill is only a discovery router. See `docs/runbook.md` for
operator and production procedures.
