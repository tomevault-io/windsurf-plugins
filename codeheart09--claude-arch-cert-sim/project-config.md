# Claude Certified Architect Exam Simulator — AI Instructions

## Project overview

A local-only Next.js exam simulator for engineers preparing for the Claude Certified Architect certification. Users clone and run it locally. No hosted deployment, no authentication.

It is an **agentic application** — agents interact with the user to generate unseen questions, evaluate performance, and drive other intelligent interactions. The RAG knowledge base (see `DATABASE.md`) is what grounds those agents.

**Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router) · TypeScript (strict) · CSS Modules · SQLite + Drizzle ORM · Biome · Vitest

---

## Package management

- Always install dependencies using `pnpm add <package>@latest` (or `pnpm add -D <package>@latest` for dev). Never edit `package.json` version fields directly — that risks resolving older cached versions.
- Use `pnpm` for all script invocations (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, etc.).

## Library research

Before writing code that uses any library (Next.js, Drizzle, Biome, Vitest, React, etc.), **search and fetch the latest documentation**. Training data is likely stale for all packages in this project — Next.js 16 and Drizzle in particular have breaking changes from earlier versions.

---

## Next.js conventions

- **App Router only.** Never introduce Pages Router patterns (`pages/`, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, `_app.tsx`).
- **Server Components by default.** Only add `'use client'` when the component needs browser APIs, event listeners, or React state/effects.
- **Server Actions for mutations.** Use `'use server'` functions for writes. Avoid API routes unless exposing an endpoint for external consumers.
- Never use `useEffect` to fetch data — use Server Components or the `use()` hook.

## TypeScript

- `strict: true` is enabled — do not disable it.
- No `any`. No `@ts-ignore` or `as any` casts. Use proper types or `unknown` with narrowing.
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions, intersections, and primitives.
- No default exports except for Next.js page and layout files (which require them).

## Styling & UI

**Read `DESIGN.md` before writing UI.** It defines the design approach and is the
authoritative source for component/styling patterns. Summary of the non-negotiables:

- **Mantine 9 is the component library.** Use a Mantine component before writing custom
  markup. Follow the decision hierarchy in `DESIGN.md`: Mantine component → props/style
  props → theme → CSS Module → custom component.
- **Global design decisions live in `app/theme.ts`** (`createTheme`), not on instances.
- **Fine-tuning uses CSS Modules.** Co-located `ComponentName.module.css`, applied via
  `className` / `classNames`. Inside CSS, reference **Mantine CSS variables**
  (`var(--mantine-spacing-md)`, `var(--mantine-color-blue-6)`, …) — never hardcoded
  colors/sizes.
- **No inline `style={{...}}` and no Mantine `styles={{...}}` prop** (it's inline style
  and outranks CSS Modules). Use `classNames` + a CSS Module instead.
- Global styles only in `app/globals.css`.
- **No Tailwind** and no second styling/component library — none is installed.
- Mantine interactive components are `'use client'`; keep pages/layouts as Server
  Components and push Mantine into client leaf components.
- **Light and dark mode are both mandatory.** Every view must work in both; use semantic
  Mantine color variables / `light-dark()`, never per-scheme hardcoding. An
  always-visible color-scheme toggle lives in a corner of the screen on every route.

## Database (Drizzle + SQLite + sqlite-vec)

See `DATABASE.md` for the full architecture. Key points:

- One file, `db/local.db`, holds two responsibilities: the **knowledge base** (RAG source — read-only at runtime) and **generated content** (runtime read/write). Keep them in separate tables.
- Query/repository functions live in `db/` (e.g., `db/questions.ts`). Use Drizzle's query builder or the `sql` tagged template — no raw string-concatenated SQL.
- Embeddings come from a **local model** — no external embedding API.
- **Knowledge-base tables (`kb_*`, incl. their `vec0` table) are owned by the seed** — it drops and recreates them each run. **Runtime tables are owned by Drizzle migrations** — their data must survive.
- Never modify the `.db` file manually. To reset, truncate runtime tables — do not delete `db/local.db` (that discards knowledge-base vectors and forces a full re-embed).
- **Never run `pnpm db:migrate` or `pnpm db:seed` without explicit user approval.** Both mutate `db/local.db`. Show the command you intend to run and wait for the user to confirm.

**When changing the database**

1. Classify the table first: *reference material the agent reads* → knowledge base; *data created by app usage* → runtime.
2. **Knowledge-base table** → edit its DDL in `db/seed.ts` (it drops and recreates KB tables). Do **not** add it to `schema.ts`, do **not** create a migration, and never put corpus content in migration history. After the change, run `pnpm db:seed`.
