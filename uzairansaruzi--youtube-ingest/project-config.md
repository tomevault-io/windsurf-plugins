description: Ingest YouTube podcasts into your knowledge base — fetch transcripts, split by speaker/chapter, generate summaries, and save to any markdown vault (Obsidian, etc). Use when the user shares a podcast URL, asks to ingest a YouTube interview/episode, or wants to archive spoken long-form content for later reference.

# YouTube Podcast Ingestion

Ingest YouTube podcasts, interviews, and long-form spoken content into a structured markdown knowledge base. Extracts transcripts, identifies speakers and chapters, generates summaries, and saves everything as linked markdown files.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install youtube-transcript-api
```

Optional but recommended:
```bash
pip install openai  # for AI-powered speaker identification & chaptering
```

## Overview

This skill handles the full pipeline for podcast ingestion:

1. **Fetch** — extract transcript from any YouTube URL (standard, shorts, live, embed, youtu.be)
2. **Chunk** — split long transcripts into manageable segments by time or topic
3. **Structure** — identify speakers, chapters, and key segments
4. **Summarize** — generate per-chapter and full-episode summaries
5. **Save** — write structured markdown to your vault with frontmatter, tags, and backlinks

## When to Use

- User shares a podcast, interview, or long-form YouTube URL
- User says "ingest this podcast" or "save this episode"
- User wants to build a personal knowledge base from spoken content
- User references a podcast episode and wants it searchable in Obsidian

**Don't use for:** Short clips under 5 minutes (use `youtube-content` instead), music videos, or videos without spoken dialogue.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Ingest a podcast episode
python3 scripts/ingest.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --vault ~/obsidian-vault/Podcasts

# With speaker identification (requires OpenAI API key)
python3 scripts/ingest.py "URL" --vault ~/obsidian-vault/Podcasts --identify-speakers --api-key $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Just fetch and preview, don't save
python3 scripts/ingest.py "URL" --dry-run
```

## Set Your Vault Path

The `--vault` flag points to **any** directory you choose. Examples:

```bash
# Obsidian vault (iCloud or local)
python3 scripts/ingest.py "URL" --vault ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/MyVault/Podcasts

# Any local folder
python3 scripts/ingest.py "URL" --vault ~/Documents/podcast-notes

# Current directory
python3 scripts/ingest.py "URL" --vault .
```

You can also set a default in `~/.config/youtube-podcast-ingestion/config.yaml`:

```yaml
vault_path: ~/obsidian-vault/Podcasts
```

## The Ingestion Pipeline

### 1. Fetch Transcript

Uses `youtube-transcript-api` to extract the full transcript. Handles:
- Auto-generated and manual captions
- Language fallback (e.g., `--language en,tr`)
- Any YouTube URL format

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py "URL" --timestamps
```

### 2. Detect Chapters

YouTube chapters (if present) are extracted from the video description. If no chapters exist, the script can optionally generate them via AI or use fixed time windows.

**From description (free):**
```bash
python3 scripts/ingest.py "URL" --vault ~/vault --chapters-from-description
```

**AI-generated (requires API key):**
```bash
python3 scripts/ingest.py "URL" --vault ~/vault --generate-chapters --api-key $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

**Fixed windows (free, deterministic):**
```bash
python3 scripts/ingest.py "URL" --vault ~/vault --chunk-minutes 10
```

### 3. Identify Speakers

For multi-speaker podcasts, speaker labels can be inferred from:
- **AI diarization** (best quality, requires API key)
- **Pattern heuristics** (free, catches "Host:" and "Guest:" patterns in transcript)
- **Manual override** via `--speakers "Host Name,Guest Name"`

```bash
python3 scripts/ingest.py "URL" --vault ~/vault --speakers "Lex Fridman,Elon Musk"
```

### 4. Generate Summaries

Summaries are generated at three levels:
- **Episode summary** — 3-5 sentence overview
- **Chapter summaries** — one paragraph per chapter
- **Key quotes** — notable statements with timestamps

AI-powered (default if `--api-key` provided):
```bash
python3 scripts/ingest.py "URL" --vault ~/vault --api-key $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Template-based (free, no API key):
- Uses simple extractive summarization: first/last sentences of each chapter + longest sentence as key quote

### 5. Save to Vault

Output is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Podcast Title"
channel: "Channel Name"
date: "2026-05-01"
duration: "2:34:56"
url: "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."
tags: [podcast, ai, interview]
speakers: ["Lex Fridman", "Elon Musk"]
chapters:
  - title: "Introduction"
    start: "0:00"
    end: "5:30"
    summary: "Host introduces the guest and topics."
---

# Podcast Title

## Episode Summary

[AI or template-generated summary]

## Chapters

### Introduction (0:00 - 5:30)

**Summary:** Host introduces the guest and topics.

**Key Quotes:**
- "..." — Speaker Name (0:45)

**Transcript:**
> [Timestamped transcript excerpt]

---

### [Next Chapter] ...
