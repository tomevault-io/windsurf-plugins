# Planet Nine is a Spaceship

## Overview

An interactive 3D visualization of Planet Nine as a spaceship, showcasing the Planet Nine ecosystem's four major components as continents on a rotating sphere. Built with pure THREE.js and vanilla JavaScript, following Planet Nine's minimal dependency philosophy.

## Architecture

### Core Design Principles

- **No Frameworks**: Uses only THREE.js and vanilla JavaScript - no React, Vue, Angular, or other frameworks
- **Planet Nine Libraries Only**: Will only integrate with official Planet Nine ecosystem libraries (sessionless, MAGIC, teleportation, etc.)
- **Keep It Simple**: Minimal dependencies, clean code, direct implementation
- **Interactive Visualization**: Mouse/touch-controlled 3D sphere with smooth animations

### File Structure

```

├── script.js          # Complete THREE.js application
└── CLAUDE.md          # This documentation
```

## Features

### 3D Planet Visualization
- **Interactive Sphere**: Mouse and touch controls for rotation with smooth interpolation
- **Dual-Hemisphere Design**: 
  - Screen side: Glossy black material with green terminal text
  - Ocean side: Green ocean material representing the living Planet Nine
- **Continent Mapping**: Four major Planet Nine ecosystem components as colored continents:
  - **The Stack** (Brown): Core protocols layer
  - **The Nullary** (Dark Slate Gray): Client applications layer  
  - **allyabase** (Dark Olive Green): Backend services layer
  - **The Advancement** (Indigo): Browser extension layer

### Technical Implementation

#### THREE.js Scene Setup
- **PerspectiveCamera**: 75° FOV, responsive aspect ratio
- **WebGLRenderer**: Antialiasing enabled, black background
- **Responsive Design**: Automatic resize handling for all screen sizes

#### Materials and Lighting
- **Multi-Material Sphere**: Different materials for screen vs ocean hemispheres
- **Phong Materials**: Realistic shininess and reflectivity
- **Complex Lighting Setup**:
  - Ambient light for overall illumination
  - Main directional light from front
  - Secondary side light for sphere definition
  - Green point light for text side atmosphere

#### Interactive Elements
- **Typewriter Effect**: Terminal-style text animation with blinking cursor
- **Canvas Texture**: Dynamic text rendering with glow effects
- **Smooth Rotation**: Mouse/touch drag controls with momentum interpolation
- **Mobile Support**: Full touch event handling for mobile devices

#### Continent System
- **Geographic Positioning**: Lat/lon coordinates converted to 3D sphere positions
- **Surface Mapping**: Continents positioned on sphere surface with correct orientation
- **Visual Design**: Each continent has unique color coding and purple boundary rings
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Continents rotate with main sphere as child objects

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **ES6+ JavaScript**: Use modern JavaScript features (classes, arrow functions, const/let)
- **Single Responsibility**: Each method handles one specific task
- **Clear Naming**: Descriptive method and variable names
- **No External Dependencies**: Beyond THREE.js CDN, everything is self-contained

### Future Enhancements (Planet Nine Integration Only)
When expanding functionality, only integrate with official Planet Nine libraries:

- **sessionless Authentication**: Add cryptographic key-based interactions
- **MAGIC Protocol**: Enable transactions or interactive elements
- **teleportation**: Content discovery and cross-service integration
- **Covenant**: Magical contract visualizations
- **BDO Integration**: Store/retrieve spaceship configurations

### Adding New Features
1. **Maintain Simplicity**: No additional frameworks or complex build processes
2. **THREE.js Best Practices**: Use object-oriented design, proper disposal, performance optimization
3. **Planet Nine Ecosystem**: Only add features that enhance the Planet Nine narrative/functionality
4. **Mobile-First**: Ensure all new interactions work on touch devices

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- **Geometry Reuse**: Efficient memory usage with shared geometries
- **Smooth Animation**: 60fps animation loop with requestAnimationFrame
- **Responsive Rendering**: Dynamic canvas sizing without performance loss

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Requires WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Mobile Support**: Full touch event handling for iOS/Android
- **Fallback Handling**: Loading screen for initialization delay

### Integration Points
Future Planet Nine ecosystem integration should happen through:
- **Event System**: Custom events for spaceship interactions
- **Data Visualization**: Planet Nine service status as visual elements
- **Authentication**: sessionless integration for personalized experiences
- **Content Display**: teleportation protocol for dynamic content loading

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The spaceship will initialize automatically with:
