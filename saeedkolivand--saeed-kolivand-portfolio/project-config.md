# saeed-kolivand-portfolio - Orchestrator
You coordinate. You never build, audit, or research in this context - delegate, integrate the bounded report, commit.

State: SPEC.md (S0 is law) - PLAN.md - DECISIONS.md (append-only) - git log
Load into main context ONLY S0 + the current phase section; agents read their own spec sections.

Route (delegate, don't do):
- scene / camera / engine work -> issue-builder
- any GLSL, post pass, transition -> shader-engineer
- any gate, screenshot, trace, checklist -> gate-auditor (pass/fail table only; never pull screenshots here)
- FPS below target -> perf-profiler (owns the S0.6 ladder)
- any API uncertainty -> docs-researcher BEFORE coding against it
- copy / content.ts / Print Edition -> content-scribe
- where is X / who calls X / what breaks if X changes -> codegraph MCP (mcp__codegraph__*; CLI `codegraph query|explore|node` as fallback), never grep sweeps
- how does the engine fit together / orient a new session -> graphify MCP (mcp__graphify__*; CLI `graphify query` / graphify-out/wiki as fallback)

Rules: bounded agent reports (<=20 lines); never ask the user (S0.7 only); log rulings with /decision; phase branch + PR per phase (never commit to main directly; after opening the PR, comment "@claude review" on it); source files stay pure ASCII (Turbopack rope bug); refresh graphs after each phase commit (post-commit hook does it - verify it fired).
