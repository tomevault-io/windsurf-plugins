# sloth — agent instructions

Repo-local rules for any coding agent (Claude Code, Copilot, Codex).
Build/infra runbook lives in `FACTORY.md`; charter in `MISSION.md`.

## What sloth is

A terminal-based **passive** network monitor for Linux, written in C99.
It never injects packets, never scans, never modifies kernel state. It
reads `/proc`, `/sys`, netlink (rtnetlink / nl80211 / INET_DIAG) and a
pcap stream, then surfaces what it sees through 24 ncurses views, six
alert rules, an embedded threat-intel matcher, optional per-alert pcap
dumps, and an optional JSONL forensic log.

Single binary `sloth`. Test binary `sloth_test`.

## Architecture

- `include/sloth.h` — central header: shared structs, the `view_t` enum.
- `src/main.c` — CLI, signal handlers, main poll loop.
- `src/tui.c` + `tui.h` — ncurses rendering, colour pair init, key
  polling. ANSI fallback when built without ncurses.
- `src/platform/linux*.c` — Linux backends (rtnetlink, nl80211, /proc
  readers, INET_DIAG).
- `src/capture/capture.c` — libpcap thread; dispatches per-protocol
  parsers (decode_ipv4/v6 → TCP/UDP → DNS/TLS/HTTP/QUIC/NTP/ICMP).
- `src/{dns,tls,quic,http,ntp,icmp}_log.c` — ring buffers + per-record
  snapshot.
- `src/{alerts,beacon_detect,devices,threat_intel,filter,jsonl,alert_pcap,
  top_hosts,ip_color,ip_owner}.c` — synthesis + export.
- `src/views/*.c` — one file per VIEW_*. The dashboard composites
  several panels into one grid.
- `src/md5.c` — embedded MD5 for JA3 (verified against RFC 1321 vectors).
- `tests/` — unit tests, fake platform, scenarios. ~1664 assertions.
- `docs/views/*.md` — per-view deep dives. Linked from README tables.

## Discipline

- **Tests must pass.** `make test` returns 0. Never commit a red test.
- **Builds must be warning-clean.** `make` produces no warnings. Treat
  any new warning as a failed build.
- **VIEW_COUNT must be kept in sync** across `include/sloth.h`,
  `tests/test_state.c`, and `tests/test_arp.c` whenever a view is added
  or removed.
- **Hand-crafted protocol tests.** Parsers are tested with raw byte
  arrays built from first principles per RFC. Don't write circular
  tests (parser feeding its own output back).
- **No mocks of real-data interfaces.** The fake platform in
  `tests/fake_platform.c` lives there for a reason.
- **Per-view docs follow the template** in `docs/views/README.md`:
  protocol → what sloth captures → text mockup → normal → suspicious →
  see-also.

## Conventions

- **Commit messages.** Imperative subject line, blank line, optional
  body explaining the *why*. End with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- **Branches.** Work on `main`. No long-running feature branches.
- **Pushes.** Push after each green commit. The user reviews on GitHub.
- **`git add` specific files.** **Never** `git add -A` or `git add .`.
  A local `wifi-sigint/` directory must never be staged or pushed.

## UI conventions

- Terminal **backgrounds are disabled** — rows render on the terminal
  default. Don't reintroduce row tints without asking.
- **IP palette = Fallout phosphor**: 8 hash-derived colours orbiting
  the project's teal phosphor base. Same IP → same colour everywhere.
  IPs appearing in ≥2 dashboard sources render **bold**.
- **SSIDs** use the same 8-colour palette via a separate hash.
- **Brand colourisation** in hostnames: `google` → G-o-o-g-l-e in
  blue/red/yellow/blue/green/red (logo); `firefox` → orange;
  `cloudflare` → red; `example.org` → grey. Case-insensitive substring
  matches (`tui_brand_addstr`).
- **Box-drawing**: panel titles use `── name ──` (U+2500). `->` is `→`
  (U+2192). Reserved macros `G_VERT`, `G_TL/TR/BL/BR` are available for
  future framing.
- **Sparklines** are heat-graded by level (cool phosphor → peak red)
  with `_` for zero / missing samples. They stretch to fill any width.
- **Dashboard layout** is a 7-band tile filling the terminal:
  iface (height = iface_count), conn + top-hosts (= 2H), packets (= 2H),
  three 3-panel rows at H each, dns/icmp at H. Min terminal 100×33.

## Hard "don't"s

- Don't run destructive git ops (`reset --hard`, `push --force`, branch
  delete) without explicit user authorisation.
- Don't add new files at repo root; everything has a home (`src/`,
  `tests/`, `docs/`, `include/`).
- Don't stage `wifi-sigint/`, `sloth`, or `sloth_test`.
- Don't reintroduce coloured row backgrounds (deliberately removed).
- Don't bypass git hooks (`--no-verify` etc.) unless explicitly asked.
- Don't push directly to a branch other than `main` without asking.

## How to add a new view

1. Define `VIEW_* = N` in `include/sloth.h` enum; bump `VIEW_COUNT`.
2. Add state fields (ring buffer + count + sel) on `sloth_state_t`.
3. Add the data type / log entry struct.
4. Create `src/views/<name>.c` + `.h` with `view_<name>_draw` and
   `view_<name>_key`.
5. Pick a key in `src/main.c`, add to the case statement.
6. Add to `view_labels[]` and the dispatch switch in `src/tui.c`.
7. Update the Makefile SRCS and TEST_SRCS.
   - If the new view has any *view-local* action bound to a letter that
     the global switch already uses (see `src/main.c` view-switch
     cases), add a claim entry in `src/view_route.c ::
     view_claims_key()` — otherwise the global switch silently swallows
