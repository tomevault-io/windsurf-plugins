## Project Guidelines

### Folder Structure
| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `specs/` | PRDs with Problem Statement, Proposed Solution, Success Metrics, Open Questions |
| `insights/` | Synthesized research with quotes, recommendations, and spec backlinks |
| `research/` | Market analysis, competitive intel, user studies |
| `research/data/` | Raw CSV datasets for analysis |
| `roadmap/` | Quarterly plans, OKRs, prioritization |
| `prototypes/` | Disposable HTML demos — no build step |
| `analysis/notebooks/` | Jupyter notebooks for data exploration |

### Conventions
- **File naming**: `kebab-case.md` everywhere
- **Spec headers**: Use Markdown metadata (not YAML frontmatter): `**Status:** Draft`, `**Author:**`, `**Last Updated:**`, `**Stakeholders:**`
- **Cross-linking**: Specs link to `insights/`, insights link back to `specs/` — unlinked content is "unvalidated"
- **Prototype stack**: HTML + [Tailwind CDN](https://cdn.tailwindcss.com) + Alpine.js — stakeholders open files directly

### Design System — Adventure Editorial Dark Theme

**Colors:**
| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Dark base | `#0a0c0a` | Page background |
| Card bg | `rgba(17, 20, 17, 0.85)` | Glass cards |
| Border | `rgba(163, 171, 163, 0.12)` | Subtle borders |

| Text secondary | `#a3aba3` | Muted text |
| Forest | `#4ade80` | Primary accent, success, CTAs |
| Sage | `#7a9b7e` | Brand accent |
