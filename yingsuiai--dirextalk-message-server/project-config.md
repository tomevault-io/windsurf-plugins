# Dirextalk Message Server

This Go service is the backend contract authority for Dirextalk Matrix APIs,
ProductCore actions, policy, projections, external MCP, and the account-control
boundary for the separately deployed Native Agent runtime.

## Read By Scope

- Public ProductCore actions: `docs/product-action-contract.json` (generated
  from `p2p/serviceapi.ActionSpecs`).
- Agent/MCP behavior: `docs/agent-mcp-current-contract.md`.
- Cross-service Agent topology and capability protocol:
  `docs/agent-core-integration-development-contract.md`.
- Current architecture and product facts: `docs/current-project-documentation.md`.
- Stable releases: `.codex/skills/dirextalk-message-server-release/SKILL.md` and the target `release/vX.Y.Z.json`.
- Contract, Matrix state, projection, or storage changes: `.codex/skills/dirextalk-backend-contract-state-storage/SKILL.md`.

Read only the references needed by the touched behavior. Current code, generated contracts, and tests override stale narrative notes.

This repository owns only the Message Server image build and formal version-tag
publication. Production server deployment, Compose topology, host lifecycle,
image update, rollback, recovery, and their operational tests belong to
`dirextalk-deployer`.

## Architecture

- `cmd/dirextalk-message-server` is the production entry point; `setup/monolith.go` wires Matrix and Dirextalk routes.
- `p2p/action_registry.go` and `p2p/service_*.go` own ProductCore orchestration.
- `internal/productpolicy` gates Matrix Client-Server writes into product rooms.
- `internal/dirextalktransport` defines product-originated Matrix writes; its Dendrite adapter performs room/member/state/message/redaction operations.
- `internal/dirextalkmatrix`, `internal/dirextalkprojection`, `internal/dirextalkstate`, and `internal/dirextalkdomain` own shared Matrix reads, projection helpers, state builders, and domain records.
- `p2p/consumer.go` and `p2p/projector.go` turn roomserver output into Dirextalk projections and product events.
- `internal/dirextalkmcp` is the shared registry and invocation layer for Native Agent tools and `POST /mcp`.
- `p2p/internal/agent` owns only Agent password/Matrix-session controls and
  short-lived owner data-plane ticket issuance. Caddy routes same-origin
  `/agent/v1/*` directly to `dirextalk-agent`; Message Server has no Agent
  business-action proxy or Agent-owned database.

Trace changes through entry point, auth, policy, durable state, Matrix writes, roomserver output, projection, sync/federation visibility, and client contract. Keep behavior in the owning package and preserve existing public interfaces unless the task changes them.

## Stable Invariants

- Matrix APIs remain Matrix-native. Product APIs use the existing action envelope; `POST /mcp` is the standard Streamable HTTP exception.
- Ordinary messages, media, history, search, unread, read markers, and redaction stay on Matrix Client-Server APIs. Do not copy them into a second ProductCore message store.
- Product read models are projections unless a documented domain rule makes a table authoritative.
- Product-originated Matrix writes use the transport boundary; normal Matrix client writes remain subject to product policy.
- User-visible facts that must survive restart use durable PostgreSQL storage and migrations. PostgreSQL is the only supported server database; configuration must fail closed for SQLite/file DSNs.
- Product roles are `owner` and `member`. Matrix `m.room.member membership=join` is the final joined fact.
- Direct, group, channel, Agent, and system identities are real Matrix rooms. Typed UI behavior is derived from room state or timeline content rather than parallel room/message models.
- Channels are unified post+chat rooms with shared history; `channel_type`
  metadata does not split current behavior.
- Remote public lookup validates Matrix IDs and uses the request-provided `remote_node_base_url`; never derive an outbound URL from a room ID.
- Keep secrets and bearer tokens out of storage records, logs, errors, command arguments, docs, and tests unless the contract explicitly stores a protected hash/reference.
- Flutter uses one public origin. Login/account controls go to Message Server;
  `/agent/v1/*` goes through Caddy directly to Agent with a short-lived owner,
  account-generation, and scope-bound ticket. No Agent internal address or
  long-lived service token is sent to Flutter.
- Native Agent execution, profiles, credentials, conversations,
  Knowledge/memory, Tasks, schedules, Skills/MCP, AWS, Execution V2, and runner
  state belong to `dirextalk-agent` and are not projected through ProductCore.
- Agent and Message Server may share a PostgreSQL cluster only through separate
  roles and databases/schemas. Product Capability handlers never synchronously
  call back into Agent; call-chain loops fail closed.
- Agent integration is fresh-state. Do not add embedded-runtime fallback,
  dual-write, legacy import, or compatibility shims.

## Change And Verification

1. Reproduce the affected path and identify the owning packages and contract source.
2. Add or update a focused regression/contract test when behavior changes.
