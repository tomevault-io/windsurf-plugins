# Oorlogsbronnen MCP Server: Concept Document

## Overview

The Oorlogsbronnen MCP Server is a specialized server implementation based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that provides structured access to Dutch World War II archives through the Oorlogsbronnen API. This server acts as a bridge between AI assistants and the rich historical data contained in these archives, enabling natural language queries about historical events, people, places, and artifacts from 1940-1945 in the Netherlands.

## Architecture

The server is built using the MCP SDK and implements three key components:

1. **Transport Layer**: Utilizes the StdioServerTransport for communication via standard input/output streams
2. **API Client**: Encapsulates communication with the Oorlogsbronnen REST API
3. **MCP Tools**: Exposes functionality through standardized tools, prompts, and resources

## Data Sources

The server interfaces with the Oorlogsbronnen archive system through a REST API:

- **Base URL**: https://rest.spinque.com/4/netwerkoorlogsbronnen/api/in10
- **Content Types**: 
  - Person (biographical records)
  - Photograph (historical images)
  - Article (news articles and documents)
  - VideoObject (video footage)
  - Thing (physical artifacts)
  - Place (geographical records)

## Available Tools

### 1. search_ww2_nl_archives

A comprehensive search tool for querying the Dutch WW2 archives with the following parameters:

- **query** (required): Main search term (e.g., "Anne Frank", "Rotterdam bombing")
- **type** (optional): Filter by content type (Person, Photograph, Article, VideoObject, Thing, Place)
- **count** (optional): Number of results to return (1-100, default: 10)

The tool returns structured data including:
- Total result count
- Item ID
- Title
- Content type
- Description (when available)
- URL to the full record

## Prompt Templates

### 1. search_help

Provides guidance on how to effectively search the Dutch WW2 archives, including:
- Parameter explanations
- Example search queries
- Available content types

## Resource Handling

The server exposes an "oorlogsbronnen" resource with the URI format:
```
oorlogsbronnen://{query}
```

This resource handler is currently implemented as a placeholder for future expansion.

## Implementation Details

1. **Error Handling**: The server implements robust error handling and logging to capture API errors and return formatted error messages.

2. **Data Transformation**: Raw API responses are transformed into structured, user-friendly formats that extract the most relevant information from each record.

3. **Debugging**: The implementation includes detailed logging of API requests and responses to facilitate troubleshooting.

## Use Cases

1. **Historical Research**: Retrieve information about specific historical events, people, or places related to WWII in the Netherlands.

2. **Educational Assistance**: Support students and educators in accessing primary source materials about the war period.

3. **Museum and Archive Integration**: Provide programmatic access to digital archive collections for integration with other applications.

4. **Family History**: Help users discover records related to family members who lived during the occupation period.

## Future Enhancements

1. Resource handler implementation for expanded functionality
2. Additional specialized search tools for specific content types
3. Integration with related historical data sources
4. Enhanced filtering capabilities for more precise search results
