Guidance for coding agents working in this repository. Read this before changing code.

## What this project is

jeval is a provider-neutral CLI that measures the calibration of probabilistic AI classifiers
and, from a cost matrix, derives the confidence threshold at which a decision should be
automated or handed to a human. Everything is driven by labeled decision records stored as
JSONL on the filesystem; `jeval report` emits a single dependency-free HTML file, and
`jeval drift` (milestone M2) is meant to make model change a CI failure instead of a
three-week-late discovery.

## Non-goals — do not build these

Scope creep kills this project faster than bugs do. The following are explicitly out of scope,
and a pull request adding them will be closed:

- Model gateways, routers, proxies, or provider adapters (adapters: not before v0.3)
- Model hosting, prompt optimization, fine-tuning
- SaaS dashboards, servers, background daemons, account systems
- Databases, ORMs, migrations — storage is JSONL files
- Plotting libraries: the report is hand-written inline SVG
- Any chart that carries meaning in colour alone, or any chart without `<title>`/`<desc>`
- A report that writes configuration (`thresholds.yaml` belongs to `jeval threshold`), fetches
  anything at runtime, or posts to a PR (jeval never holds a token)
- Vendor-specific behavior of any kind: jeval must work for anything that returns a probability
- Non-English artifacts: no i18n, no translated docs, no localized CLI strings
- `score`-type records folded into binary accuracy (they are excluded and counted)

## Architecture map

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `jeval/schema.py` | `DecisionRecord` and the per-`question_type` normalization rules |
| `jeval/store.py` | JSONL read/write; the only module that knows about `.jeval/` |
| `jeval/config.py` | `config.yaml` defaults and the ingest field mapping |
| `jeval/ingest.py` | raw JSONL/CSV rows to decision records, one record per question |
| `jeval/calibration.py` | binning, ECE/MCE/Brier, Wilson and bootstrap intervals — pure functions |
| `jeval/evaluate.py` | record set to report-ready structures; gold/silver separation |
| `jeval/synth.py` | synthetic logs with known miscalibration; shared by tests and `jeval demo` |
| `jeval/costs.py` | cost matrix, threshold sweep, the bootstrap interval on the threshold, impact table |
| `jeval/drift.py` | slices by model version or period, model-change detection, `--fail-on` checks, CI text block |
| `jeval/baseline.py` | baseline snapshots: measurements only, never records |
| `jeval/collect.py` | the provider-neutral recorder: `track()`/`record()`, env-gated, best-effort, never raises |
| `jeval/presets.py` | ingest presets: where a product's field spelling is written down, as data |
| `jeval/score.py` | score-type questions: MAE, RMSE, rank correlation, level view — never binary accuracy |
| `jeval/planning.py` | label-needed projections: interval-width scaling, with an explicit refusal below 200 labels |
| `jeval/active.py` | the labeling queue: threshold band, flat distributions, sparse bins; CSV sheet round-trip |
| `jeval/recalibrate.py` | temperature and isotonic fits, cross-validated, exported as YAML; declines when the gain is noise |
| `jeval/report/model.py` | the frozen data contract every chart and the template render from |
| `jeval/report/svg.py` | pure SVG primitives: scales, ticks, axes, legends, error bars |
| `jeval/report/charts/` | one module per chart: reliability, cost, segments, drift |
| `jeval/report/verdict.py` | verdict branching and the markdown summary |
| `jeval/report/assets.py` | inline CSS and JavaScript |
| `jeval/report/template.py` | section assembly in the fixed reading order |
| `jeval/cli.py` | the Typer command surface; thin, no statistics logic |

Statistics belong in `calibration.py`. If a metric needs to be computed anywhere else, it
needs to move there instead.

## Development commands

```sh
uv sync --all-groups
uv run pytest
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy jeval
uv run jeval demo --out-dir /tmp/jeval-demo
```

## Code rules

- **English only** in code, identifiers, comments, docstrings, error messages, CLI help, docs,
  and commit messages.
- The collector may never become a failure mode: no raising, no blocking, no vendor SDK import, and
  it never calls a model. Collection is off with `JEVAL_COLLECT=0`. Product-specific field names go
  in `presets.py` as data — never as a conditional branch in the core.
- New runtime dependencies require discussion before the change, not after. The runtime set is
  `numpy`, `pydantic`, `pyyaml`, `typer` and should be treated as closed by default.
- No database, no server, no network calls in any command.
- Public functions carry type hints and are checked by mypy; `jeval/calibration.py` is under
  strict typing because its correctness is the product.
- User-facing messages explain what was measured and what is missing, never oversell. If a
  number cannot be supported by the sample, say so.
- Never quote a number in the README that you have not run. `tests/test_readme_example.py` checks
  the report figures, and `tests/test_documented_features.py` checks that every command, flag and
