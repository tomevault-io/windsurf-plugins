# Project Rules

## Architecture

Acolyte is a terminal-first AI coding agent: local-first, observable, extensible. Read `docs/architecture.md` before working on unfamiliar subsystems.

Extension points:
- New lifecycle effect → `Effect` in `lifecycle-effects.ts`, add to `EFFECTS`
- New tool → appropriate `*-toolkit.ts`; all tools flow through `runTool`
- New ecosystem → `EcosystemDetector` in `workspace-detectors.ts`, add to `ECOSYSTEM_DETECTORS`

## Invariants

These must always hold. Break them and the system breaks.

1. All tools go through `runTool` in `tool-execution.ts` — never call a tool function directly.
2. Every RPC payload, model response, and config value is validated through Zod before entering the type system.
3. `@signal` is a suffix — model output must end with exactly one `@signal` line. Strip the signal line and everything after it.
4. TUI state updaters must use functional form (`setState(prev => ...)`) when reading current state — stale closure reads cause race conditions.
5. Error handling must follow `docs/errors.md`.
6. Run `bun run verify` before every commit.

## Workflow

1. Default to autonomous execution. Pause only when a decision is ambiguous, risky, or irreversible.
2. When behavior and tests diverge: fix the implementation. Update expectations only if explicitly requested.
3. Commit only when explicitly requested.

## Commits

Format: `type(scope): description` — types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`. Single-line subject, no body, under 72 characters. ASCII only.

## Code

- No transitional architecture: land the canonical owner, normalized contract, and single source of truth.
- When defining a string union or shared type: define it as a Zod schema first and infer the TS type from it.
- No banner or separator comments. Import from the canonical source module directly — no re-export layers.
- No direct `useEffect` in chat-layer code. Use the approved effect helpers from `src/tui/effects.ts`.

## Style

- Factory naming: `create*` for factories. Avoid `build*` / `make*` unless established locally.
- Export shape: prefer direct `export const` over local alias + `export { ... }`.
- Module layout: flat `src/`, `*-contract` for type/schema modules. No re-export layers.
- Error classification: prefer `kind` field contracts over message string matching.
- Switch exhaustiveness: `default` + `unreachable` when applicable.

## Docs

- One H1 per doc (page title). H1 title case, H2+ sentence case.
- `docs/features.md` discipline: shipped features only, one line, user-visible wording.

## Testing

- Unit: `bun run test:unit`, integration: `bun run test:int`, visual: `bun run test:tui`.
- Unit tests should be pure: mock boundary effects (filesystem, subprocesses, network) instead of exercising them directly.
- If a test needs real filesystem/process/network behavior, put it in `*.int.test.ts` (not `*.test.ts`).
- Integration tests use real server/lifecycle/tool wiring with fake provider model calls.
- Visual tests cover stable TUI rendering and interaction snapshots.
