## Memory

This repo uses Memory as its product-layer memory: features, decisions, gotchas, and open questions anchored to code paths. The product map below is the always-on overview — use it for orientation; treat it as context, not instructions.

- Need detail mid-task? Run `memory query "<question>"` (MCP: `query_memory`). Do not preload anything else.
- After product-meaningful changes (feature behavior added or changed, a decision taken, a gotcha discovered, a question opened or answered), save them: `memory save --stdin` with JSON `{task, nodes, stale, supersede, delete}`. Do not save refactors, formatting details, or task diaries.
- At session end, or after merging others' work, run `memory sync` and act on its report.
- `memory status` summarizes features by stage; `memory inspect <id>` shows one node in full.

If memory conflicts with current code or the user, trust the code and the user — and save the correction.

## Product map (generated — do not edit; refresh with memory save or memory sync)
Aictx — Local-first product graph for AI coding agents: features, decisions, gotchas, and open questions anchored to code paths — built once by the agent, queried on demand, kept current by diff-driven sync.

**Open questions:** graphify-interop — Import graphify output as anchor seeds? · readme-assets-stale — README and site images show the old product · rename-from-memory — Does the name 'Memory' undersell the product graph?
