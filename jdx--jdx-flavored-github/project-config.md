# Repository Agent Guide

## Contributing

Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the development and pull request
workflow.

Do not check the pull request template's manual Chrome verification box while
authoring or updating a pull request. For bug fixes and features, that box must
remain unchecked until the human contributor has built the extension, loaded
`dist/` as an unpacked extension in Chrome, verified the change on GitHub, and
personally clicked the checkbox in the GitHub pull request UI.

## Pull request titles

All pull request titles must use Conventional Commits format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

The scope is optional. Use the narrowest useful subsystem when one is clear,
such as `notifications`, `views`, `dsl`, `options`, `build`, or `deps`.

Supported types are `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`,
`test`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `revert`, and `security`.

- Write the description in imperative mood.
- Use lowercase after the colon.
- Keep the title concise and descriptive.
- Use `!` after the type or scope for a breaking change.
- Do not add a tool name, emoji, or manually typed pull request number.

Examples:

- `feat(notifications): add repository-scoped views`
- `fix(build): refresh static assets in watch mode`
- `refactor(dsl): split parsing from evaluation`
- `docs: explain Refined GitHub compatibility`
- `feat(options)!: replace the exported settings schema`

## AI attribution

AI-assisted pull request descriptions, reviews, and comments must end with:

```text
*AI-assisted — Tool: <tool>; model: <provider>/<model>; version: <version-or-unavailable>.*
```

Use the exact model and version identifiers exposed by the runtime. Never infer
or guess them; use `unavailable` when either identifier is not exposed.
