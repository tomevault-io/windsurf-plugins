# agent-bridge — notes for agents working in this repo

Keep the docs in sync with the code. When you change how the bridge behaves — e.g. 
`scripts/` (`bridge.sh`, `render.py`, `adapter.py`, `meta.py`), `scripts/adapters/*.json`,
or `SKILL.md` — update `README.md` and any affected `references/*.md` in the **same** change.

Docs must match actual behavior. Keep them short, accurate, concise. No one wants to read pages of AI slop, so before expanding and growing the doc ensure that what you're writing is actually valuable. 

Stale docs are worse than none.
