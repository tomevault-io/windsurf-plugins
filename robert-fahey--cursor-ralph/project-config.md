# Project Rules for Cursor

This file contains project conventions and patterns discovered during development.
Ralph (the autonomous agent loop) updates this file with learnings from each iteration.

## Project Structure

```

## Conventions

### Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic

### Commits

- Format: `[STORY-ID] Brief description`
- One story per commit when possible
- Keep commits atomic and focused

### Quality Checks

- All code must pass type checking
- All code must pass linting
- All tests must pass
- Add tests for new functionality

## Patterns Discovered

<!-- Ralph will append patterns here during execution -->

## Useful Context
