# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

A terminal-centric IDE desktop app built on Electron that wraps CLI tool sessions. Users manage projects and sessions, each backed by a PTY running a CLI tool (currently Claude Code, with an abstraction layer for future providers like Copilot CLI and Gemini CLI), rendered via xterm.js.

## Build & Run

```bash
npm run build    # Compile all three targets (main, preload, renderer) + copy assets
npm start        # Build then launch Electron app (alias: npm run dev)
```

No hot reload — changes require rebuild + app restart.

Requires Node v24 (see `.nvmrc`). No lint tooling is configured.

Cross-platform: builds and runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Release artifacts (via electron-builder) include `.dmg`/`.zip` (mac), `.deb`/`.AppImage` (linux), and NSIS installer + portable `.exe` (win). CI covers all three platforms.

## Testing

```bash
npm test             # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch   # Watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:coverage # Run with coverage report (terminal + HTML)
```

Uses **Vitest** with v8 coverage. Tests are co-located with source files as `*.test.ts`. Coverage HTML report outputs to `coverage/index.html`.

Test files are excluded from production builds via `exclude` in `tsconfig.main.json` and `tsconfig.renderer.json`.

Three renderer modules (`session-cost.ts`, `session-activity.ts`, `session-context.ts`) expose `_resetForTesting()` to clear module-level state between tests. Main process tests mock `fs`, `child_process`, `node-pty`, and `os` via `vi.mock()`.

## Architecture

Three-process Electron architecture with strict context isolation:

- **Main process** (`src/main/`) — Node.js side: window creation, PTY lifecycle via `node-pty`, filesystem access, persistent state (`~/.vibeyard/state.json`). IPC handlers in `ipc-handlers.ts` dispatch to `pty-manager.ts` and `store.ts`. CLI tool behavior is abstracted via the provider system (`src/main/providers/`).
- **Preload** (`src/preload/preload.ts`) — Secure bridge exposing `window.vibeyard` API via `contextBridge` with namespaces: `pty`, `session`, `store`, `fs`, `provider`, `menu`.
- **Renderer** (`src/renderer/`) — Vanilla TypeScript DOM UI (no framework). `AppState` singleton in `state.ts` uses an event emitter pattern; components in `components/` subscribe to state changes.

### Data Flow

Renderer → IPC invoke/send → Main process → PTY/filesystem → IPC send back → Renderer updates xterm terminal.

### Build Targets

Each process has its own `tsconfig.*.json`. Main and preload compile via `tsc` (CommonJS). Renderer bundles via esbuild (IIFE format, browser platform, with sourcemaps).

### CLI Provider System

CLI-specific behavior is encapsulated behind a `CliProvider` interface (`src/main/providers/provider.ts`). Each provider handles binary resolution, env vars, args, hooks, config reading, and cleanup. Providers are registered in a registry (`src/main/providers/registry.ts`) at app startup.

- **Provider per-session**: Each `SessionRecord` has a `providerId` (defaults to `'claude'`). A project can contain sessions from multiple providers.
- **Capabilities pattern**: Providers declare what they support via `CliProviderCapabilities`. UI can conditionally enable features per-session.
- **Current providers**: `ClaudeProvider` (`src/main/providers/claude-provider.ts`) — extracts all Claude-specific logic from `pty-manager.ts`, `prerequisites.ts`, `claude-cli.ts`, and `hook-status.ts`.

### Key Components

- `terminal-pane.ts` — xterm.js wrapper per session, handles PTY data streaming and WebGL rendering with software fallback
- `state.ts` — Reactive AppState singleton; debounced persistence (300ms) to `~/.vibeyard/state.json`
- `split-layout.ts` — Manages tab mode (single terminal) vs split mode (side-by-side)
- `session-activity.ts` — Tracks working/waiting/idle status with debounced transitions
- `session-cost.ts` — Structured cost tracking via Claude CLI status line (`statusLine` setting), with regex fallback for older CLI versions. Provides per-session and aggregate cost data (USD, tokens, cache, duration)
- `browser-tab/` — Browser tab pane split into focused modules: `types.ts`, `instance.ts` (registry + preload path), `navigation.ts`, `viewport.ts`, `selector-ui.ts`, `inspect-mode.ts`, `flow-recording.ts`, `flow-picker.ts`, `session-integration.ts`, and `pane.ts` (DOM build + event wiring). `browser-tab-pane.ts` is a re-export shim for backward compatibility.

### Platform Checks

Platform detection is centralized in `src/main/platform.ts`. Import
`isWin`/`isMac`/`isLinux` (and derived constants `pathSep`, `whichCmd`,
`pythonBin`) from there — do **not** inline `process.platform === 'win32'`
or redefine `isWin`/`isMac` locally in source or test files. The
three-way managed-path branch in `claude-cli.ts` is the one intentional
exception.

### State Persistence
