# Working on NodeJAX

This is the repository-wide instruction entry point for coding agents. Read it
before changing code. If `CLAUDE.md` exists, read it completely as well; it
contains additional local prose, naming, and workflow decisions and is equally
binding. Nested `AGENTS.md` files may only add rules for their own subtree.

## Values do not change underneath the caller

If code receives a Node, parameter tree, state tree, definition, or input, it
does not change that value. It computes and returns another value.

```python
# Good: the old state still means what it meant before the call.
next_state = state.replace(count=state.count + 1)
return next_state

# Bad: the caller's state changes behind its back.
state.count += 1
return state
```

This rule is about what a value means to its caller. It is not a claim that no
Python object may ever change internally.

These mutations are fine:

- A constructor fills the fields of the new object it is constructing.
- A function builds a fresh local `dict` or `list`, fills it, and consumes it
  before returning.
- A cache remembers an answer without changing the answer or any other
  caller-visible behavior. `cached_property` is fine.
- An invocation-local helper such as `KeyStream` or an authored wiring scope
  advances while one call is running, then does not escape as model data.

These mutations are not fine:

- Changing an object received from a caller.
- Changing a bound tree, definition, or retained collection as a side effect
  of an operation that promises to return a value.
- Requiring a caller to know that an apparently functional operation mutated
  something elsewhere.

Python allows somebody to reach into a private attribute such as `_def` and
assign to it. That misuse does not make the design mutable and is not a reason
to freeze every Python field. Do not write a test that mutates private storage
and then report the mutation as a framework defect.

Use a simple immutable container where it naturally matches the data:

- Return immutable collections by default. Keep mutable accumulators inside
  the function that builds and consumes them so their mutation cannot appear
  to escape its scope. If a helper genuinely must return mutable working
  storage, make that exceptional contract explicit in its name, return type,
  and docstring.
- Use `Struct` for a fixed set of named fields when attribute access makes the
  code clearer.
- Use `frozendict` when mapping access makes the code clearer.
- Framework-returned object hierarchies use Nodes, ordinary objects, or
  `Struct` records so named parts have normal attribute access.
- Keep fresh local working dictionaries as ordinary `dict` values.

Do not add custom `__setattr__` machinery, post-init wrappers, defensive-copy
layers, or proxy types merely to make private mutation impossible.

## Framework terminology

A Node is called a Node. In prose, comments, and docstrings, never substitute “component” merely for variety. Use “component” only when it denotes a genuinely different concept rather than a NodeJAX Node.

## Polymorphism and type probing

In NodeJAX library code and first-party NodeJAX examples, `hasattr` and
`isinstance` are forbidden unless the user explicitly approves the use. Do not
replace them with exact-class dispatch over a hierarchy. Put behavior on the
owning class and dispatch through a common method, property, or explicit
contract instead.

Comparison implementations for other frameworks are exempt from this style
rule. They should use that framework's ordinary idiom.

## Nullability and compatibility

Do not add defensive `None` states, optional branches, compatibility shims, or
dual representations. Values are concrete unless absence is part of the
contract. When a representation changes, update every producer and consumer in
the same change.

## Documentation

Files under `docs/` are intentional public writing. Edit them only when the
user explicitly asks for a documentation change.

Do not hard-wrap prose in Markdown files. Keep each paragraph and each list item on one physical line, and let the editor or renderer wrap it. Preserve line structure where Markdown requires it, including headings, tables, lists, quotations, and code blocks.

Use a 100-character line-length target for newly authored code. Do not reflow existing code merely to enforce it.

## Remote Git operations

Never run `git push` without explicit and unambiguous approval to push. A request to prepare a release, work toward a push, create a commit, or perform release checks does not authorize any remote write.

## Scope and verification

- Targeted user-requested edits and focused tests may proceed without asking.
- Present a plan and get confirmation before sweeping core-contract refactors,
  deleting files, or destructive Git operations.
- Verify behavior by running the relevant code. Do not turn an assumption into
  a stated result.
- Tests describe an evolving design. Do not preserve a stale behavior solely
  to keep an old assertion green.
