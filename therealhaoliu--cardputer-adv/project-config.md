# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

## OpenSpec Apply Workflow

When running `/openspec:apply`:

### Step 1: Discover and Display Proposals

1. Find all proposals in `openspec/changes/` (exclude `archive/`)
2. For each proposal, check git status to determine if it has uncommitted changes:
   - `??` (untracked), `M` (modified), `A` (staged), `AM` (added+modified) = uncommitted
3. Read each `proposal.md` to get a brief description
4. Display all proposals with their status:

```
Available proposals:

1. add-demo-apps ✓ (committed)
   Brief description from proposal.md

2. refactor-launcher-lazy-load ✗ (uncommitted)
   Brief description from proposal.md
```

### Step 2: Handle Based on What's Available

**If all proposals have uncommitted changes:**
- STOP and tell the user which proposals need to be committed
- Provide the git commands to commit them:
  ```
  git add openspec/changes/<id>/
  git commit -m "Add <id> proposal"
  ```

**If one or more proposals are fully committed:**
- Ask the user which one to apply (always confirm, even if there's only one)

### Step 3: Pre-Implementation Checks

1. **Assess context needs** - Check remaining context window and read the plan complexity (tasks.md). If context is low (<50% remaining) or the plan is complex, recommend the user run `/clear` first and re-run the command.

### Step 4: Set Up Worktree and Implement

1. Create a new git worktree with a branch named after the change-id:
   ```
   git worktree add ../cardputer-<change-id> -b <change-id>
   ```
2. Change to the new worktree directory
3. Run `uv sync` to create the venv
4. Run `direnv allow` to enable the environment
5. Run `uv run pre-commit install` to set up git hooks
6. Implement the changes following the tasks.md checklist

## OpenSpec Archive Workflow

When running `/openspec:archive`:

1. Run `openspec list` to check task completion status
2. **If there are incomplete tasks**: STOP and ask the user before proceeding
   - Show which tasks are incomplete
   - Ask if they want to complete them first or archive anyway
3. Only run `openspec archive <id> --yes` after user confirms

## Hardware Feedback Loop

When the Cardputer is connected via USB, use `mpremote` to run code directly on the device:

```bash
# Basic command execution (mpremote auto-connects)
mpremote exec "import sys; print(sys.implementation)"

# Check WiFi status
mpremote exec "import network; w = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF); print(w.isconnected(), w.ifconfig()[0] if w.isconnected() else 'N/A')"

# Draw on display
mpremote exec "import M5; M5.Lcd.clear(); M5.Lcd.print('Hello')"

# File operations
mpremote fs ls /flash
mpremote fs cat /flash/boot.py
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use short `exec` commands for quick tests - these work reliably
- Avoid long-running code (infinite loops, framework startup) via mpremote - these can lock up the serial connection
- For long-running operations, ask the user to run them manually
- If serial locks up, user may need to reset the device or close the terminal

**Safe poe tasks (Claude can run these):**
- `poe deploy` - Deploy to flash

**Avoid running directly:**
- `poe run [file]` - Starts framework loop, can lock up serial

**Use mpremote directly for device operations:**
- `mpremote exec "code"` - Run Python one-liner
- `mpremote eval "expr"` - Evaluate expression and print result
- `mpremote run /tmp/test.py` - Run local script (only sees /flash)
- `mpremote mount . + run /tmp/test.py` - Run with local dir mounted at /remote (sees local lib/apps changes)
- `mpremote fs ls /flash` - List files
- `mpremote fs cat /flash/file.py` - Read file
- `mpremote fs tree /flash` - Directory tree
- `mpremote df` - Check disk space
- `mpremote reset` - Reset device

## Commit Message Style

Use conventional commit format: `<type>: <description>`

### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature or functionality |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace (no code logic change) |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `build` | Build system or dependencies (PlatformIO, libs) |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration changes |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks, tooling |
| `revert` | Reverting a previous commit |
| `openspec` | Proposals, specs, and archives |

### Subject Line Rules

- **Imperative mood**: `add feature` not `added` or `adds`
- **Lowercase after type**: `feat: add settings app` not `feat: Add Settings App`
- **No trailing period**: `fix: resolve memory leak` not `fix: resolve memory leak.`
- **Under 50 characters**: keep it concise
