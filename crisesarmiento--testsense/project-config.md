# TestSense — Cursor Rules

## What this project is
A CLI tool that analyzes TypeScript/JavaScript codebases and identifies test coverage gaps.
It does NOT generate tests blindly — it finds what's critically missing and explains why.

The core question it answers: "Given my codebase, my existing tests, and this PR — what's the most important thing I'm not testing?"

## Stack
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Node.js 18+
- ts-morph (AST parsing)
- @anthropic-ai/sdk (Claude Sonnet for LLM reasoning)
- commander (CLI)
- vitest (tests)
- tsup (build)

## Architecture
The pipeline has 7 stages, each in its own file:
1. collector.ts — file discovery (source files + test files)
2. parser/ — AST analysis → CodebaseGraph (pages, API routes, components, hooks)
3. test-mapper.ts — existing tests → TestCoverageMap
4. summarizer.ts — compresses graph + coverage into <4K token LLM context
5. analyzer.ts — LLM call #1 → GapReport (ranked list of missing tests)
6. generator.ts — LLM call #2 → Playwright test stubs for top gaps
7. renderer.ts — formats output (terminal / JSON / markdown)

## Key design decisions
- DO NOT send raw source code to the LLM. Build a semantic graph first, send the graph summary.
- The summarizer is the critical performance gate — keep LLM context under 4,000 tokens per run.
- Tiered parsing: parse pages/routes/stores first, hooks/utils only if under file limit.
- Target cost: under $0.05 per full analysis run at Claude Sonnet pricing.
- CLI-first: no server, no database, no auth in Phase 1.

## Code conventions
- No default exports — named exports only
- Types in types.ts, not inline in implementation files
- Pure functions preferred — side effects only in cli.ts and renderer.ts
- Error messages should tell the user what to do, not just what went wrong
- No console.log in library code — use the renderer

## What Phase 1 is
Only packages/cli matters right now. packages/action and packages/mcp are stubs for future phases.
Do not add SaaS features, auth, or database logic — that belongs in a separate private repo.
