# Manual PR checklist

This is an **Apply Manually** project rule: no `description`, no `globs`,
`alwaysApply` is false. It is included only when the user `@mention`s
`@manual-pr-checklist` (or `@manual-pr-checklist.mdc`) in chat.

When this rule is attached, review against:

1. Diff matches the stated intent; no drive-by refactors.
2. New behavior has a colocated `*.spec.ts` or a reason it does not.
3. Rules/skills/hooks that were added are linked from `README.md`.
4. No secrets or `.cursor/logs/` transcripts in the diff.
5. Suggested commit subject is imperative and ≤ 72 characters.
