# Always-on project rule

This is an **Always Apply** project rule (`alwaysApply: true`).

- Stack is SvelteKit. Put new code where the user says. Do not invent a
  second project at the repo root unless they ask.
- There is no existing application source tree. List the directory before
  claiming files exist. Do not assume a previous demo.
- Prefer editing rules, skills, MCP config, and hooks over drive-by refactors.
- GitHub issues, PRs, and repo facts go through the connected GitHub MCP.
- Do not commit `.cursor/logs/*.log` or `.cursor/logs/*.jsonl`.
  Tail `.cursor/logs/hooks.log` to see every hook run.
- Never put credentials in source or client code. Hooks block `.env` paths and
  credential-like strings.
