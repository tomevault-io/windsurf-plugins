# Core Pipeline Modules

## Source Router (`packages/core/router`)

Decides which sources to query per request — not every query needs every source. For voice: fast path (memory + cached context, sub-300ms) vs full path (full fan-out) based on topic shift detection.

## Ranking (`packages/core/ranking`)

Score on: semantic similarity, recency, importance, confidence, user personalization, source reliability.

## Dedup (`packages/core/dedup`)

Embedding-similarity threshold across contexts from different sources — collapse duplicate facts to one representation.

## Conflict Resolution (`packages/core/conflict-resolution`)

Detect contradictions across sources. Default: most-recent-source-wins. Expose conflicts in `diagnostics` so calling app can override.

## Compression (`packages/core/compression`)

Summarize oversized retrieved chunks to maximize information per token.

## Token Budget (`packages/core/budget`)

Dynamic allocation based on query and source relevance (not fixed split). Tokenizer-based counting per section; truncate/summarize on overflow.

## Prompt Builder (`packages/core/prompt-builder`)

Structured sections — not inline string concatenation:
system instructions → user memory → relevant documents → workspace context → retrieved API data → conversation → current message.

Voice: live transcription injected into conversation section, bypassing router/rank/dedup.

## Memory Writer (`packages/core/memory-writer`)

Async post-response: extract durable facts, merge duplicates, update importance, archive stale, delete obsolete. Voice: extract on finalized turns only, not mid-utterance ASR.

## Query Planning (`packages/core/query-planning`)

Decompose complex/multi-part questions into retrieval sub-steps.

## Adaptive Retrieval (`packages/core/adaptive-retrieval`)

Track which retrieval strategies perform best over time and adjust.

## API return shape

Every `getContext()` / `getContextFast()` call must return full contract including `diagnostics` (ranking scores, discarded context, conflicts, latency by source).
