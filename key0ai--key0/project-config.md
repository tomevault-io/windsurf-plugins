# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: Key0 SDK

Payment-gated A2A (Agent-to-Agent) endpoints using the x402 protocol with USDC on Base. Lets sellers monetize any API: agents request access, pay via on-chain USDC, and receive either a signed JWT (subscription plans) or a direct API response (per-request plans).

Package name: `@key0ai/key0` (single package, not a monorepo despite README references to packages).

## Commands

```bash
bun install          # Install dependencies
bun test             # Run all tests
bun run typecheck    # Type-check without emitting
bun run lint         # Lint with Biome
bun run build        # Compile TypeScript to ./dist
```

Run a single test file:
```bash
bun test src/core/__tests__/challenge-engine.test.ts
```

Run examples:
```bash
cd examples/express-seller && bun run start
cd examples/client-agent && bun run start
```

## Architecture

### Two-Phase Payment Flow

**Subscription plans** (default `mode: "subscription"`):
```
Client → AccessRequest → X402Challenge (amount, destination, chainId)
Client → PaymentProof (txHash) → AccessGrant (JWT)
Client → Protected API with Bearer JWT
```

**Per-request plans** (`mode: "per-request"`) and **per-request routes** (`routes: [{ routeId, ... }]`):
```
Client → POST /x402/access { planId | routeId, resource: { method, path } } → 402 + PaymentRequirements
Client → POST /x402/access + PAYMENT-SIGNATURE → ResourceResponse (API response proxied inline)
  (standalone gateway) or
Client → GET /api/route + PAYMENT-SIGNATURE → direct 200 response (embedded, no token issued)
```

### Core Layers

1. **Types** (`src/types/`) — Protocol-agnostic interfaces: `IPaymentAdapter`, `IChallengeStore`, `ISeenTxStore`, `IAuditStore`, plus all message types (`AccessRequest`, `X402Challenge`, `PaymentProof`, `AccessGrant`).

2. **Core** (`src/core/`) — Business logic:
   - `challenge-engine.ts` — State machine (PENDING → PAID → DELIVERED | PENDING → EXPIRED | PENDING → CANCELLED | PAID → REFUND_PENDING → REFUNDED | PAID → REFUND_PENDING → REFUND_FAILED | REFUND_FAILED → PAID via `retryFailedRefunds`). Owns the full challenge lifecycle, on-chain verification dispatch, and token issuance. Key methods: `requestAccess` (A2A), `requestHttpAccess` (HTTP x402 PENDING record), `preSettlementCheck` (avoid burning USDC), `processHttpPayment` (PENDING → PAID → DELIVERED for HTTP/MCP flows), `submitProof` (A2A proof verification), `recordPerRequestPayment` (settles a per-request payment — PENDING → PAID without issuing a token), `markDelivered` (transitions PAID → DELIVERED after the backend response is returned to the client).
   - `access-token.ts` — JWT issuance/verification (HS256 or RS256). Supports fallback secrets for zero-downtime rotation.
   - `agent-card.ts` — Auto-generates A2A discovery card from `SellerConfig`.
   - `storage/` — `IChallengeStore` + `ISeenTxStore` + `IAuditStore`. Redis implementations: `RedisChallengeStore`, `RedisSeenTxStore`, `RedisAuditStore`. Postgres implementations: `PostgresChallengeStore`, `PostgresSeenTxStore`, `PostgresAuditStore`. Uses atomic Lua scripts (Redis) for concurrent state transitions. `IChallengeStore` and `ISeenTxStore` are required; `IAuditStore` is optional (audit trail).

3. **Adapter** (`src/adapter/`) — `X402Adapter`: verifies ERC-20 Transfer events on Base via viem. Supports `mainnet` (chainId 8453) and `testnet`/Base Sepolia (chainId 84532).

4. **Integrations** (`src/integrations/`) — Framework adapters mount a unified `POST /x402/access` endpoint (with `X-A2A-Extensions` header routing to A2A JSON-RPC), `GET /discover` (plan catalog, no PENDING record), and export `validateAccessToken` middleware for protecting routes. Available for Express, Hono, Fastify, and MCP (Streamable HTTP transport via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`). CLI builder in `cli.ts` + `cli-template.ts`: `buildCli(opts)` compiles a standalone branded binary with the service URL baked in; the template implements `discover`, `request`, `install`, `help`, and `version` commands. Settlement helpers in `settlement.ts`: `buildHttpPaymentRequirements`, `buildDiscoveryResponse`, `decodePaymentSignature`, `settleViaFacilitator`, `settleViaGasWallet`, and the unified `settlePayment` entry point (auto-selects strategy based on config, serialises gas wallet calls via `withGasWalletLock`). Per-request middleware in `pay-per-request.ts`: `key0.payPerRequest(routeId, opts?)` factory for embedded route-level gating (settles inline, calls `next()`, no token issued); `resolveConfigFetchResource(config)` determines whether standalone proxy mode is active. The `routeId` path inside `POST /x402/access` is handled directly in express.ts, hono.ts, and fastify.ts (not via `pay-per-request.ts`) with a full two-phase PENDING → PAID → DELIVERED flow and inline proxy call to `fetchResource`/`proxyTo`. MCP routeId flow uses `engine.recordPerRequestPayment` for double-spend protection and state tracking.

5. **Executor** (`src/executor.ts`) — `Key0Executor` implements `@a2a-js/sdk`'s `AgentExecutor` for the A2A protocol flow.
