# Conventions and Coding Style

It is encouraged that you follow Kohana's coding style. This makes code more readable and allows for easier code sharing and contributing. 

## Class Names and File Location

Class names in Kohana follow a strict convention to facilitate [autoloading](autoloading). Class names should have uppercase first letters with underscores to separate words. Underscores are significant as they directly reflect the file location in the filesystem.

The following conventions apply:

1. CamelCased class names should be used when it is undesirable to create a new directory level.
2. All class file names and directory names must match the case of the class as per [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md).
3. All classes should be in the `classes` directory. This may be at any level in the [cascading filesystem](files).

### Examples  {#class-name-examples}

Remember that in a class, an underscore means a new directory. Consider the following examples:

Class Name            | File Path
----------------------|-------------------------------
Controller_Template   | classes/Controller/Template.php
Model_User            | classes/Model/User.php
Model_BlogPost        | classes/Model/BlogPost.php
Database              | classes/Database.php
Database_Query        | classes/Database/Query.php
Form                  | classes/Form.php

## Coding Standards

In order to produce highly consistent source code, we ask that everyone follow the coding standards as closely as possible.

### Brackets

Please use [BSD/Allman Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#BSD.2FAllman_style) bracketing.  

#### Curly Brackets

Curly brackets are placed on their own line, indented to the same level as the control statement.

	// Correct
	if ($a === $b)
	{
		...
	}
	else
	{
		...
	}

	// Incorrect
	if ($a === $b) {
		...
	} else {
		...
	}

#### Class Brackets

The only exception to the curly bracket rule is, the opening bracket of a class goes on the same line.

	// Correct
	class Foo {

	// Incorrect
	class Foo
	{

#### Empty Brackets

Don't put any characters inside empty brackets.

	// Correct
	class Foo {}

	// Incorrect
	class Foo { }

#### Array Brackets

Arrays may be single line or multi-line.

	array('a' => 'b', 'c' => 'd')
	
	array(
		'a' => 'b', 
		'c' => 'd',
	)

##### Opening Parenthesis

The opening array parenthesis goes on the same line.

	// Correct
	array(
		...
	)

	// Incorrect:
	array
	(
		...
	)

##### Closing parenthesis

###### Single Dimension

The closing parenthesis of a multi-line single dimension array is placed on its own line, indented to the same level as the assignment or statement.

	// Correct
	$array = array(
		...
	)

	// Incorrect
	$array = array(
		...
		)

###### Multidimensional

The nested array is indented one tab to the right, following the single dimension rules.

	// Correct
	array(
		'arr' => array(
			...
		),
		'arr' => array(
			...
		),
	)
	
	array(
		'arr' => array(...),
		'arr' => array(...),
	)
	
##### Arrays as Function Arguments


	// Correct
	do(array(
		...
	))
	
	// Incorrect
	do(array(
		...
		))

As noted at the start of the array bracket section, single line syntax is also valid.

	// Correct
	do(array(...))
	
	// Alternative for wrapping long lines
	do($bar, 'this is a very long line',
		array(...));

### Naming Conventions

Kohana uses under_score naming, not camelCase naming.

#### Classes

	// Controller class, uses Controller_ prefix
	class Controller_Apple extends Controller {

	// Model class, uses Model_ prefix
	class Model_Cheese extends Model {

	// Regular class
	class Peanut {

When creating an instance of a class, don't use parentheses if you're not passing something on to the constructor:

	// Correct:
	$db = new Database;

	// Incorrect:
	$db = new Database();

#### Functions and Methods

Functions should be all lowercase, and use under_scores to separate words:

	function drink_beverage($beverage)
	{

#### Variables

All variables should be lowercase and use under_score, not camelCase:

	// Correct:
	$foo = 'bar';
	$long_example = 'uses underscores';

	// Incorrect:
	$weDontWantThis = 'understood?';

### Indentation

You must use tabs to indent your code. Using spaces for tabbing is strictly forbidden.

Vertical spacing (for multi-line) is done with spaces. Tabs are not good for vertical alignment because different people have different tab widths.

	$text = 'this is a long text block that is wrapped. Normally, we aim for '
		  .'wrapping at 80 chars. Vertical alignment is very important for '
		  .'code readability. Remember that all indentation is done with tabs,'
		  .'but vertical alignment should be completed with spaces, after '
		  .'indenting with tabs.';

### String Concatenation

Do not put spaces around the concatenation operator:

	// Correct:
	$str = 'one'.$var.'two';

	// Incorrect:
	$str = 'one'. $var .'two';
	$str = 'one' . $var . 'two';

### Single Line Statements

Single-line IF statements should only be used when breaking normal execution (e.g. return or continue):

	// Acceptable:
	if ($foo == $bar)
		return $foo;

	if ($foo == $bar)
		continue;

	if ($foo == $bar)
		break;
