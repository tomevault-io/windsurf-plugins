- This codebase uses progressive disclosure to manage agent context.
  - For each package in `src/` and each script in `scripts/`, maintain an `AGENTS.md` outlining each file's functionality and that of any subpackages.
  - Summaries should be very brief, one or two sentences per file or subpackage. Additional context can be held at the top of the file.
  - Maintain an overall outline of packages in `CODEBASE.md`.
- Run `npm run typecheck && node_modules/.bin/biome check . && node_modules/.bin/biome format --write .` after writing code and before committing.
