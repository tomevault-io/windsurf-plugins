# Benchmark Fairness And Speed

- Benchmarks must be fair but fast. Do not add repeated decode, loader construction, conversion, synchronization, checksum, materialization, dependency setup, or process orchestration unless it is explicitly part of the named measurement scope or required to force lazy work to complete.
- Requirement lock refresh is expected once per library or joined-environment launch when refresh is enabled. Do not add cross-library refresh coordination unless it removes real work without changing dependency freshness semantics. Use `--no-refresh-requirements` for repeated local reruns with fixed locks.
- Micro benchmarks should preload media once per library and reuse that cache for per-transform timing. Pipeline benchmarks should only include decode, collation, tensor conversion, and device copy when their `pipeline_scope` says those costs are included.
- Micro transform specs must measure only the named transform in each library's native layout. The micro runner must force returned outputs into contiguous memory before timing stops. Do not add `Normalize`, `ToTensor`, axis conversion, or DataLoader collation work to micro specs.
- DataLoader pipeline specs own recipe-level `Normalize+ToTensor`: AlbumentationsX uses `ToTensorV2`, Pillow uses `torchvision.transforms.PILToTensor` before normalization, and torchvision/Kornia already produce tensors. `pipeline_runner.py` should use default PyTorch collation and must not guess or repair channel layouts.
- If an optimization changes what is measured, do not do it. If an optimization only removes benchmark harness overhead outside the measurement contract, prefer it.
- Keep benchmark matrix and policy centralized. Scenario/library/mode support belongs in `benchmark/matrix.py`; shared media defaults and slow-skip thresholds belong in `benchmark/policy.py`; subprocess command construction belongs in `benchmark/jobs.py`; backend dispatch belongs in `benchmark/orchestrator.py`.
- Do not reintroduce special backend branches in `benchmark/cli.py`. DALI and future non-standard backends should be represented as `BenchmarkJob.backend` values and dispatched by the orchestrator.
