# AGENTS.md

why712 tells you why an EIP-712 signature doesn't verify. It reads the contract's real domain
separator over RPC, recomputes the digest locally, and reports the specific cause of the
mismatch — and where it can, which change makes the signature work.

Two developer surfaces, one core: a TypeScript/WASM SDK (`why712` on npm) and a CLI (`why712`).
There is no hosted application or backend.

## Repository map

This is a Cargo workspace.

- `crates/why712-core` — deterministic diagnosis plus transport-neutral chain snapshot types.
  Diagnosis is pure and synchronous; the optional native `rpc` feature is the only network code.
- `crates/why712-cli` — the `why712` binary. Argument parsing and rendering only.
- `crates/why712-wasm` — JS bindings and a `globalThis.fetch` RPC transport for Node/browser.
- `packages/why712-sdk` — the public TypeScript facade and npm package tests.
- `docker/` — the shipped CLI image and the development toolchain image.
- `scripts/` — helper scripts, notably `dev-cargo.sh`.

## Docs

`docs/` is the source of truth for system-level and process-level knowledge. **"The docs" always
means this directory, not the web.** Look here before searching online; these files record the
conventions and gotchas you cannot derive from the code.

When you learn something durable — a convention, a gotcha, a piece of system context that will
outlive the current task — update a doc. Code-level facts belong in a comment next to the code.

| Doc | What's in it |
|---|---|
| [docs/diagnostics.md](docs/diagnostics.md) | Every `FindingCode`: what it means, why it happens, how to fix it |
| [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) | Crate layering, the pure-core boundary, how RPC stays out of it |
| [docs/coding-standards.md](docs/coding-standards.md) | What gets merged and what doesn't |
| [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) | Test vectors, fixtures, snapshots, wasm tests |
| [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) | Local setup, building and testing the SDK and CLI |
| [docs/release.md](docs/release.md) | Release playbook |
| [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) | Threat model and what never leaves the user's machine |

## Local working context

Two paths are **untracked** (see `.gitignore`) but load-bearing. They will not appear in a fresh
clone; if they exist, they are current.

- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — the full plan, its milestones, and their status.
- `.vault/` — working memory: blockers, open questions, decisions, backlog, journal.
  Read `.vault/README.md` first; it defines the format and the boundary against `docs/`.

**Protocol.** Before non-trivial work, read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `.vault/STATUS.md`, and
`.vault/BLOCKERS.md` — they exist so you don't rediscover a dead end someone already mapped.
When you finish, update `.vault/STATUS.md` and append to `.vault/JOURNAL.md`.

**Record a barrier as a `B-…` entry before you work around it, not after.** The workaround is
what survives in the code; the reason for it is what gets lost.

## Project skills and research

Use `.agents/skills/why712-workflow/SKILL.md` when continuing implementation, maintenance,
research, or release work in this repository.

Use `.agents/skills/keep-docs-current/SKILL.md` for every feature, public behavior change, PR,
or release. Update affected canonical and public docs in the same change, or record a concrete
`Documentation impact: none` rationale in the PR.

Do not guess when a fact is absent from local docs or may have changed. Inspect the exact pinned
dependency source first, then consult current primary sources such as the applicable EIP/ERC,
official Rust or crate documentation, or the upstream repository. Promote durable conclusions
to `docs/` and record unresolved questions in `.vault/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

When a non-obvious workflow will recur or would help another agent work correctly, package it
as a focused skill under `.agents/skills/` using the `skill-creator` workflow. Do not turn
one-off facts or rules already clear in `AGENTS.md` or `docs/` into skills.

## Language

English is canonical for code, docs, comments, identifiers, CLI output, finding text, SDK API,
templates, and commit messages. Deliberate README translations are the only exception:
name them `README.<locale>.md`, keep the language switcher synchronized, and update them when a
canonical README change affects users.

## Quick start

With Rust installed natively:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check -p why712-core --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
pnpm build:sdk
pnpm check:sdk
pnpm test:sdk
```

Without Rust, run the same commands through the pinned toolchain container:

```bash
scripts/dev-cargo.sh test --workspace
```

The wasm check is not optional busywork. `why712-core` must build for
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` or the TypeScript SDK cannot exist, and a dependency that breaks it is far
cheaper to catch now than after the code is written. CI runs it on every push.

## Non-negotiables

- **Diagnosis never performs I/O.** No network, filesystem, clock, or randomness may enter the
  diagnosis path. Chain data enters it as a plain `OnchainSnapshot`. The only concrete I/O in
