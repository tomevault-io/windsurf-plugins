# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repo is a Bun + Turborepo monorepo.

- `apps/cli`: published CLI (`create-kubojs`, bins `create-kubojs` + `kubojs`), with source in `apps/cli/src` and tests in `apps/cli/test`.
- `apps/web`: Next.js docs/site (`apps/web/src`, `apps/web/content/docs`, `apps/web/public`).
- `apps/video`: Remotion app for brand/launch videos (`@kubojs/video`). Not part of the Next site; Studio + `remotion render` only.
- `packages/template-generator`: template generation engine used by the CLI.
- `packages/types`: shared schemas/types.
- `packages/backend`: Convex backend used by web features.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `bun install`: install workspace dependencies.
- `bun dev`: run web app locally (`next dev --port 3333`).
- `bun run dev:video`: run Remotion Studio (`apps/video`).
- `bun cli`: watch-build CLI package.
- `bun build`: build all packages/apps through Turbo.
- `bun build:cli`: build only the CLI target.
- `bun run check`: format + lint (`oxfmt . && oxlint .`).
- `cd apps/cli && bun run test`: run CLI tests.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Language: TypeScript (strict mode enabled across projects).
- Modules: ESM-first (`"type": "module"` where applicable).
- Formatting/linting: `oxfmt` and `oxlint`; run `bun run check` before committing.
- File naming: prefer kebab-case files (for example `database-setup.ts`).
- Symbols: `camelCase` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for types/components.
- Keep feature logic near domain folders (`helpers`, `utils`, `template-handlers`).

## Maintainability Guardrails

When touching an existing TypeScript file, actively remove small, high-confidence sources of
branching and type noise encountered in the touched area:

- Replace unnecessary or unsafe `as` assertions with typed boundaries, type guards, or shared
  canonical helpers. Do not remove an assertion blindly when it documents a real external boundary.
- Replace repeated `else`/`else if` chains and more than four sequential conditionals with a small
  typed lookup, dispatcher, predicate, or focused helper when that preserves the behavior clearly.
- Prefer small local refactors over broad rewrites: keep the public behavior and architecture
  stable, avoid speculative abstractions, and do not refactor generated files or tests merely to
  improve a metric.
- Whenever one of these patterns is found in the file being changed, fix the highest-confidence
  occurrence in the same change and add or run focused tests for the affected behavior.
- Treat this as a maintainability rule, not a ban on `as` or `if`: a single clear guard or a
  boundary assertion is preferable to a clever abstraction.

## Error Handling Conventions

- In CLI code, prefer `better-result` over ad-hoc `try/catch` for recoverable flows.
- Return typed `Result<T, E>` and use `Result.ok`, `Result.err`, `Result.try`, and `Result.tryPromise`.
- Reuse domain errors from `apps/cli/src/utils/errors.ts` (`CLIError`, `ProjectCreationError`, `UserCancelledError`) and convert thrown prompt errors at boundaries.

## Template Authoring (Handlebars)

- Templates live in `packages/template-generator/templates` and use helpers from `packages/template-generator/src/core/template-processor.ts` (`eq`, `ne`, `and`, `or`, `includes`).
- For conditional ORM-specific output, use helper form with quoted values:
  - `{{#if (eq orm "prisma")}}`
  - `{{else if (eq orm "drizzle")}}`
  - `{{/if}}`
  - Example: `packages/template-generator/templates/packages/infra/alchemy.run.ts.hbs`.
- When files must contain literal `{{ ... }}` (Vue/JSX/template syntax), escape opening braces as `\{{` in `.hbs` files so Handlebars does not evaluate them.
  - Example: `packages/template-generator/templates/frontend/nuxt/app/pages/index.vue.hbs`.

## Testing Guidelines

- Framework: `bun:test`.
- Test files use `*.test.ts` naming (see `apps/cli/test` and `packages/template-generator/test`).
- Add or update tests with behavior changes, especially prompt flows, template output, and config validation.
- Keep tests deterministic; reuse shared setup utilities in `apps/cli/test/setup.ts`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Use Conventional Commits with scope, matching history:
  - `feat(cli): ...`, `fix(web): ...`, `docs(video): ...`, `chore(video): ...`
- Open an issue/discussion before major feature work.
- PRs should include:
  - clear summary,
  - linked issue (if applicable),
  - verification steps run (`bun run check`, relevant tests),
  - screenshots/GIFs for web UI changes.

## Agent skills

### Start here

For practical KuboJS usage in a generated project, use the [KuboJS guide](.agents/skills/kubojs/SKILL.md).

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues for `albuquerquesz/kubo` using the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The canonical triage roles map directly to same-named GitHub labels. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

This repo uses a single-context domain doc layout. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
