# Project Guidelines

## Code Style
- Follow existing FastAPI and Pydantic typing style used in app code.
- Keep endpoint handlers asynchronous (`async def`) unless there is a clear CPU-bound reason.
- Preserve request/response model separation in [app/models/todo.py](app/models/todo.py).

## Architecture
- App entrypoint is [app/main.py](app/main.py): creates `FastAPI` app and includes routers.
- API routes live in [app/routers/](app/routers/) and should contain HTTP behavior only.
- Data schemas live in [app/models/](app/models/) using Pydantic models.
- Storage currently uses in-memory globals in [app/storage/todo.py](app/storage/todo.py).
- Keep this boundary: router -> models/storage. Avoid business logic in `main.py`.

## Build and Test
- Run server: `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Python requirement is 3.12+ (see [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)).
- If adding tests, prefer `pytest` and document the exact command in [README.md](README.md).

## Conventions
- TODO endpoints are under `/todos` in [app/routers/todo.py](app/routers/todo.py).
- Validate query/body constraints with `Query(...)` and `Field(...)`.
- Use `exclude_unset=True` for partial updates as shown in [app/routers/todo.py](app/routers/todo.py).
- Raise `HTTPException` with explicit status codes for not-found and validation paths.
- Remember storage is process-local and resets on restart; do not assume persistence.
