# Quality Gates

Run these checks after making any changes to Dart files.

## Dart Code Quality

After modifying any `*.dart` files, use the dart tool to run the following checks:

1. Run `format` in the affected packages to format the code
2. Run `analyze` in the affected packages to check for issues
3. Fix all infos, warnings, and errors surfaced by these commands
4. Run `test` in the affected packages to ensure all tests pass
5. Fix any failing tests
6. Repeat steps 1-5 until all issues are resolved and all tests pass
