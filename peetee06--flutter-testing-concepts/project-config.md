# Effective Dart Rules

<!-- Source: https://github.com/evanca/flutter-ai-rules/blob/1cc9bf82daaf65cb3291f82c661bb82f24c641df/combined/flutter_dart_riverpod_mockito.md -->

### Naming Conventions
1. Use terms consistently throughout your code.
2. Follow existing mnemonic conventions when naming type parameters (e.g., `E` for element, `K`/`V` for key/value, `T`/`S`/`U` for generic types).
3. Name types (classes, enums, typedefs, type parameters) using `UpperCamelCase` (also known as `PascalCase`, especially for classes).
4. Name extensions using `UpperCamelCase`.
5. Name packages, directories, and source files using `lowercase_with_underscores`.
6. Name import prefixes using `lowercase_with_underscores`.
7. Name other identifiers (variables, parameters, named parameters) using `lowerCamelCase`.
8. Capitalize acronyms and abbreviations longer than two letters like words.
9. Avoid abbreviations unless the abbreviation is more common than the unabbreviated term.
10. Prefer putting the most descriptive noun last in names.
11. Consider making code read like a sentence when designing APIs.
12. Prefer a noun phrase for non-boolean properties or variables.
13. Prefer a non-imperative verb phrase for boolean properties or variables.
14. Prefer the positive form for boolean property and variable names.
15. Consider omitting the verb for named boolean parameters.
16. Use `lowerCamelCase` for function names.
17. Use `snake_case` for file names.

### Types and Functions
1. Use class modifiers to control if your class can be extended or used as an interface.
2. Type annotate variables without initializers.
3. Type annotate fields and top-level variables if the type isn't obvious.
4. Annotate return types on function declarations.
5. Annotate parameter types on function declarations.
6. Write type arguments on generic invocations that aren't inferred.
7. Annotate with `dynamic` instead of letting inference fail.
8. Use `Future<void>` as the return type of asynchronous members that do not produce values.
9. Use getters for operations that conceptually access properties.
10. Use setters for operations that conceptually change properties.
11. Use a function declaration to bind a function to a name.
12. Use inclusive start and exclusive end parameters to accept a range.

### Style
1. Format your code using `dart format`.
2. Use curly braces for all flow control statements.
3. Prefer `final` over `var` when variable values won't change.
4. Use `const` for compile-time constants.

### Imports & Files
1. Don't import libraries inside the `src` directory of another package.
2. Don't allow import paths to reach into or out of `lib`.
3. Prefer relative import paths within a package.
4. Don't use `/lib/` or `../` in import paths.
5. Consider writing a library-level doc comment for library files.

### Structure
1. Keep files focused on a single responsibility.
2. Limit file length to maintain readability.
3. Group related functionality together.
4. Prefer making fields and top-level variables `final`.
5. Consider making your constructor `const` if the class supports it.
6. Prefer making declarations private.

### Usage
1. Use strings in `part of` directives.
2. Use adjacent strings to concatenate string literals.
3. Use collection literals when possible.
4. Use `whereType()` to filter a collection by type.
5. Test for `Future<T>` when disambiguating a `FutureOr<T>` whose type argument could be `Object`.
6. Follow a consistent rule for `var` and `final` on local variables.
7. Initialize fields at their declaration when possible.
8. Use initializing formals when possible.
9. Use `;` instead of `{}` for empty constructor bodies.
10. Use `rethrow` to rethrow a caught exception.
11. Override `hashCode` if you override `==`.
12. Make your `==` operator obey the mathematical rules of equality.

### Documentation
1. Format comments like sentences.
2. Use `///` doc comments to document members and types; don't use block comments for documentation.
3. Prefer writing doc comments for public APIs.
4. Consider writing doc comments for private APIs.
5. Consider including explanations of terminology, links, and references in library-level docs.
6. Start doc comments with a single-sentence summary.
7. Separate the first sentence of a doc comment into its own paragraph.
8. Use square brackets in doc comments to refer to in-scope identifiers.
9. Use prose to explain parameters, return values, and exceptions.
10. Put doc comments before metadata annotations.
11. Document why code exists or how it should be used, not just what it does.

### Testing
1. Write unit tests for business logic.
2. Write widget tests for UI components.
3. Aim for good test coverage.

### Widgets
1. Extract reusable widgets into separate components.
2. Use `StatelessWidget` when possible.
3. Keep build methods simple and focused.

### State Management
1. Choose appropriate state management based on complexity.
2. Avoid unnecessary `StatefulWidget`s.
3. Keep state as local as possible.

### Performance
1. Use `const` constructors when possible.
2. Avoid expensive operations in build methods.
3. Implement pagination for large lists.

# Dart 3 Updates

### Branches
1. Use `if` statements for conditional branching. The condition must evaluate to a boolean.
