# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Builder** is a Go CLI tool for iOS development without a Mac. It has two main capabilities:
1. **Remote builds**: Build iOS apps via GitHub Actions from any platform
2. **Dev tools**: Hot reload on real iOS devices using MobAI (Flutter and React Native)

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build
go build -o builder ./cmd/builder

# Test
go test ./...

# Install
go install ./cmd/builder

# Run
./builder auth github       # Authenticate with GitHub (OAuth device flow)
./builder init              # Set up workflow in current repo
./builder ios build         # Trigger build and download IPA to ./dist/
./builder dev flutter       # Flutter hot reload with MobAI
./builder dev rn            # React Native hot reload with MobAI
./builder dev flutter --skip-install --bundle-id <id>  # Use already installed app
./builder dev rn --skip-install --bundle-id <id>       # Use already installed app
```

## Architecture

```
builder auth github ─────► GitHub OAuth (device flow)
                                │
                                ▼
                          Token stored in OS keychain

builder init ────────────► Detects git remote (origin)
                                │
                                ▼
                          Creates .github/workflows/ios-build.yml
                          Creates builder.json
                          Optionally commits/pushes and runs build

                                │
                                ▼
                          GitHub Actions (macos-14)
                            ├─ Detects Flutter/native
                            ├─ Caches DerivedData
                            ├─ Builds unsigned IPA
                            └─ Uploads artifact
                                │
                                ▼
                          Downloads IPA to ./dist/

builder dev flutter ─────► Connects to MobAI
                                │
                                ▼
                          Installs IPA on device (with optional re-sign)
                                │
                                ▼
                          Launches app with debugger
                                │
                                ▼
                          Captures VM Service URL
                                │
                                ▼
                          Runs flutter attach (hot reload)

builder dev rn ──────────► Starts Metro bundler (if not running)
                                │
                                ▼
                          Connects to MobAI
                                │
                                ▼
                          Installs IPA on device (with optional re-sign)
                                │
                                ▼
                          Launches app with Metro URL env vars
```

### Module Layout

```
cmd/builder/         # CLI entrypoint (Cobra)
internal/
  auth/              # GitHub OAuth device flow + keyring storage
  github/            # GitHub REST API (workflow dispatch, artifacts)
  build/             # Build coordination (trigger + poll + download)
  workflow/          # Workflow template (embedded)
  config/            # builder.json management
  dev/               # Development session (Flutter/React Native hot reload)
  mobai/             # MobAI API client (device control, app install/launch)
```

## Key Patterns

- **OAuth Device Flow**: No gh CLI dependency, uses GitHub's device authorization
- **Keyring Storage**: Token stored via `go-keyring` (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux SecretService)
- **Interactive Init**: Prompts to commit/push and run first build
- **Remote Selection**: `--remote` flag to use non-origin remotes
- **Flutter Detection**: Auto-detects Flutter projects, runs `flutter pub get`, uses `Runner` scheme
- **DerivedData Caching**: Single static cache key for incremental builds
- **MobAI Integration**: HTTP/WebSocket API for device control, app install, debug launch
- **Flutter Custom Devices**: Auto-configures `~/.config/flutter/custom_devices.json` for `mobai-ios` device
- **Debug URL Capture**: WebSocket stream captures VM Service URL from app launch
- **React Native Metro**: Auto-starts Metro bundler, passes Metro URL to app via environment variables
- **FrameworkHandler Interface**: Common session with pluggable handlers for Flutter/React Native

## Configuration

`builder.json`:
```json
{
  "project": "MyApp",
  "platform": "ios",
  "github": { "owner": "username", "repo": "my-ios-app" },
  "ios": { "path": "ios", "scheme": "" }
}
```

## Workflow Features

The embedded workflow template (`internal/workflow/templates/ios-build.yml`):
- Triggered via `workflow_dispatch` with `build_id`, `ios_path`, `scheme`
- Runs on `macos-14`
- Detects Flutter projects (checks for `pubspec.yaml`)
- Caches DerivedData with static key for fast incremental builds
- Auto-detects workspace/project and scheme
- Flutter: uses `Runner` scheme, runs `flutter pub get`
- Installs CocoaPods if Podfile exists
