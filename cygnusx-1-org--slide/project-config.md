description: do not modify quoted strings
---

When working with strings.xml files, do not modify any string resources that contain single quotes (either as apostrophes or escaped with backslash like \') unless specifically requested to do so.

Examples of strings that should NOT be modified without explicit instruction:
- <string name="profile_tag_user_existing">User tagged as ‘%s’</string>
- <string name="profile_block_user">Block user\'s messages, posts, and profile</string>
- <string name="profile_unblock_user">Unblock user\'s messages, posts, and profile</string>
- <string name="misc_setting_up_message">Please don\'t leave this screen. Shouldn\'t take long!</string>
- <string name="user_btn_gotomultis">Go to user\'s multis</string>
- <string name="wiki_err_msg">This subreddit doesn\'t have a wiki!</string>
- <string name="subreddit_err_msg">The subreddit %1$s could not be found. Perhaps it\'s spelled wrong?</string>
- <string name="subreddit_err_msg_new">The subreddit %1$s could not be found. Perhaps it\'s spelled wrong, or you do not have access to this subreddit.</string>
- <string name="offline_comments_not_loaded">Please go back online and select ‘Cache comments’ from the 3 dot menu to view comments offline</string>
- <string name="dialog_color_sync_message">This will try to retrieve the subreddit’s ‘key color’ set by the moderators. It will not overwrite already colored subreddits.</string>
- <string name="login_failed_err_decline">Be sure you didn’t select ‘Decline’ on the last screen, and try again in a minute</string>
- <string name="err_couldnt_save_choose_new">Slide couldn\'t save to the selected directory. Would you like to choose a new save location?</string>
- <string name="multireddit_title_empty">Title can\'t be empty</string>

If a string contains single quotes and needs modification, first ask for confirmation before making changes. When adding new strings, follow the established patterns for escaping single quotes with backslashes where appropriate.
