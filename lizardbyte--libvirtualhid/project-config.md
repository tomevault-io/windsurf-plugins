On Windows we use msys2 and ucrt64 to compile.
You need to prefix commands with `C:\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd -defterm -here -no-start -ucrt64 -c`.

Prefix build directories with `cmake-build-`.

The test executable is named `test_libvirtualhid` and will be located inside the `tests` directory within
the build directory.

The project uses gtest as a test framework. GoogleTest is vendored as a submodule under `third-party/googletest`.

Keep the public c++ API platform-neutral. Platform-specific virtual HID details belong behind backend
implementations and should not leak into consumer code.

Gamepad support is the primary target. Remote streaming hosts are the first consumer class, so validate API
and behavior changes against the adapter examples and lifecycle tests.

Windows support must remain user-mode. Do not add a custom kernel-mode driver. The normal c++ library should
remain buildable with both MSVC and MinGW/UCRT64; any future UMDF driver package is a separate WDK/MSVC build
artifact.

Linux gamepad support should prefer uhid for descriptor-driven controllers. Keyboard and mouse support should
prefer uinput, with X11 XTest only as a fallback.

Always update public documentation when changing headers, backends, or consumer-facing behavior.

Always follow the style guidelines defined in .clang-format for c/c++ code when that file is present.
