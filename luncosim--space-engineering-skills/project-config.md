# AI Agent Guidelines (AGENTS.md)

Welcome, AI Coding Agent! This file provides the context, rules, and preferences you need to effectively contribute to the LunCo space-engineering-skills repository.

## Project Context
This repository houses a suite of **Space Engineering Skills**. These skills empower AI agents to perform complex space engineering tasks, from early conceptual systems engineering to detailed thermal and structural analysis.

## Core Principles
1. **Focus on the Objective**: The primary goal is to build robust, modular, and easily verifiable skills that space engineers can rely on.
2. **Standardization**: When dealing with industry data, always prefer established standards (e.g., ReqIF for requirements, XTCE for telemetry) *as an export/import layer*, while keeping the internal human-readable layer simple (Markdown/YAML).
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Keep skill files concise. The main `SKILL.md` should be under 500 lines. Use the `scripts/` and `references/` directories to offload complexity.

## Current Capability Map
As an agent, you have the following specialized skills available in the `skills/` directory to help you solve complex mission design tasks:

- **Requirements Management**: `requirements-manager` (Define, update, and trace system requirements).
- **Integrated Systems Assessment**: `systems-engineering-assessment` (The Integrator - Mass, Power, and Link budgets).
- **Mission Context**: `orbital-conops-manager` (Earth orbit) and `lunar-conops-manager` (Lunar surface & night survival).
- **Mission Execution**: `mission-operations-manager` (Planning & Ops) and `mission-analysis-specialist` (Astrodynamics & Trajectory).
- **Domain Analysis**: `power-assessment` (Solar array & battery sizing), `communications-assessment` (Link budgets), `thermal-assessment` (Heat balance), `structural-assessment` (Loads & MoS), `propulsion-assessment` (Delta-V), `gnc-assessment` (Pointing & actuators), `payload-assessment` (Instrument sizing & data rates).
- **Reliability & Safety**: `reliability-assessment` (Risk & Radiation), `hazard-analysis` (Safety & Inhibits).
- **Embedded Systems**: `flight-software-architect` (FSW architecture, FDIR, CI/CD, and simulation-in-the-loop testing).
- **Architecture & Decision-Making**: `trade-study-manager` (Structured trade studies & Figures of Merit).
- **Cost & Production**: `cost-modeling` (Parametric cost estimation & lifecycle costing), `manufacturing-assessment` (DFM/DFA & production planning), `reusability-analysis` (Recovery systems & flight-rate economics).
- **Human Spaceflight & ISRU**: `eclss-assessment` (Life support: O₂, CO₂, water, habitable volume), `isru-assessment` (In-situ resource utilization & propellant production).
- **Constellation**: `constellation-design` (Walker patterns, coverage analysis, ISLs, deployment).
- **Ground Segment**: `ground-systems-assessment` (Mission control, ground stations, launch facilities, GSE).
- **Closure & Execution**: `v-and-v-manager` (Compliance audit) and `ait-manager` (Assembly, Integration, and Test).


## Directory Structure Rules

When creating or modifying a skill, adhere strictly to this structure. Create folders only when nessesary:

```text
skills/
└── [skill-name]/
    ├── SKILL.md                 # Required: The core instructions and triggers
    ├── evals/                   # Required: The evaluation JSON and outputs
    │   └── evals.json           # Test cases for the skill
    ├── scripts/                 # Executable code for deterministic tasks
    ├── references/              # Context documents loaded as needed
    └── [skill-specific-data]/   # e.g., requirements/, templates/
```

**Crucial Directory Rule:** NEVER write output files to the root directory or global generic folders unless explicitly requested by the user. An agent running a skill must keep all generated artifacts contained *within* that skill's specific directory (e.g., `skills/requirements-manager/requirements/`).

## Tech Stack & Formatting
*   **Documentation**: Markdown (`.md`) is heavily preferred for documentation and human-readable data (like requirements).
*   **Data Serialization**: Use JSON or YAML. JSON is preferred for programmatic evals and configurations. YAML is preferred for human-editable configurations.
*   **Skill Creation**: When building new skills, always use the `skill-creator` methodology. Do not attempt to build a skill "from scratch" without writing evaluation prompts first.

## Workflow Rules
1. **Ask for Clarification**: Space engineering is an exact science. If an instruction regarding margins, thermal limits, orbital mechanics, or other things is ambiguous, stop and ask the user. Do not guess engineering values.
2. **Cross-Skill Collaboration**: Skills are designed to work together. When performing an assessment (e.g., `v-and-v-manager`), proactively look for outputs from other skills (like `thermal-assessment`) to use as evidence.
3. **Output Management**: While artifacts should generally stay within a skill's directory, high-level "Integrated Reports" (e.g. Mission Assessment Reports) that combine data from multiple skills should be placed in a dedicated `missions/[mission-name]/` directory at the project root for consolidated review.
