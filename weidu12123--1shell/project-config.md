# 1Shell Project Guardrails

Every Codex run in this repository must treat these as non-negotiable:

1. Do not pile up prompts. Do not put small operational preferences into core prompts; prompt changes must be rare, minimal, and justified.
2. Do not pile up architecture. Architecture must not impersonate, pre-answer for, or replace the AI's own judgment and output.
3. Do not hide context from the model. The model must receive complete relevant context, including tool output, errors, interruptions, and execution state.

把时间用在思考上,你不需要使用commentary和我汇报进度。
