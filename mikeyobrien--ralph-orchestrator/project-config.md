# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> The orchestrator is a thin coordination layer, not a platform. Agents are smart; let them do the work.

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo test -p ralph-core test_name           # Run single test
cargo test -p ralph-core smoke_runner        # Smoke tests (replay-based)
cargo run -p ralph-e2e -- --mock             # E2E tests (CI-safe)
./scripts/setup-hooks.sh                     # Install pre-commit hooks (once)
```

**IMPORTANT**: Run `cargo test` before declaring any task done. Smoke test after code changes.

### Web Dashboard

```bash
ralph web                                    # Launch both servers (backend:3000, frontend:5173)
npm install                                  # Install all dependencies
npm run dev                                  # Dev mode (both)
npm run dev:server                           # Backend only
npm run dev:web                              # Frontend only
npm run test:server                          # Backend tests
```

## Architecture

```
ralph-cli      → CLI entry point, commands (run, plan, task, loops, web)
ralph-core     → Orchestration logic, event loop, hats, memories, tasks
ralph-adapters → Backend integrations (Claude, Kiro, Gemini, Codex, Roo, etc.)
ralph-telegram → Telegram bot for human-in-the-loop communication
ralph-tui      → Terminal UI (ratatui-based)
ralph-e2e      → End-to-end test framework
ralph-proto    → Protocol definitions
ralph-bench    → Benchmarking

backend/       → Web server (@ralph-web/server) - Fastify + tRPC + SQLite
frontend/      → Web dashboard (@ralph-web/dashboard) - React + Vite + TailwindCSS
```

## The Ralph Tenets

1. **Fresh Context Is Reliability** — Each iteration clears context. Re-read specs, plan, code every cycle. Optimize for the "smart zone" (40-60% of ~176K usable tokens).

2. **Backpressure Over Prescription** — Don't prescribe how; create gates that reject bad work. Tests, typechecks, builds, lints. For subjective criteria, use LLM-as-judge with binary pass/fail.

3. **The Plan Is Disposable** — Regeneration costs one planning loop. Cheap. Never fight to save a plan.

4. **Disk Is State, Git Is Memory** — Memories and Tasks are the handoff mechanisms. No sophisticated coordination needed.

5. **Steer With Signals, Not Scripts** — The codebase is the instruction manual. When Ralph fails a specific way, add a sign for next time.

6. **Let Ralph Ralph** — Sit *on* the loop, not *in* it. Tune like a guitar, don't conduct like an orchestra.

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Building features into the orchestrator that agents can handle
- ❌ Complex retry logic (fresh context handles recovery)
- ❌ Detailed step-by-step instructions (use backpressure instead)
- ❌ Scoping work at task selection time (scope at plan creation instead)
- ❌ Assuming functionality is missing without code verification

## Specs & Tasks

- Create specs in `.ralph/specs/` — do NOT implement without an approved spec first
- Create code tasks in `.ralph/tasks/` using `.code-task.md` extension
- Work step-by-step: spec → dogfood spec → implement → dogfood implementation → done

### Memories and Tasks (Default Mode)

Memories and tasks are enabled by default. Both must be enabled/disabled together:

When enabled (default):
- Scratchpad is disabled
- Tasks replace scratchpad for completion verification
- Loop terminates when no open tasks + consecutive LOOP_COMPLETE

To disable (legacy scratchpad mode):
```yaml
memories:
  enabled: false
tasks:
  enabled: false
```

## Parallel Loops

Ralph supports multiple orchestration loops in parallel using git worktrees.
