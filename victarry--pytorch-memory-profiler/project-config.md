# Python Coding Standards for Memory Profiler

## Code Style
- Follow Black formatting with line length of 100
- Use isort for import organization (profile: black)
- Type hints are encouraged but not mandatory
- Use f-strings for string formatting

## Imports
- Group imports: standard library, third-party, local
- Use absolute imports for memory_profiler modules
- Import specific classes/functions, not entire modules

## Documentation
- All public classes and methods must have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings format
- Include Args, Returns, and Raises sections where applicable
- Add type hints in function signatures when possible

## Logging
- Use the project's logger from `memory_profiler.core.logger`
- Use appropriate log levels: DEBUG for detailed tracing, INFO for general flow, WARNING for issues
- Include context in log messages (e.g., tensor shapes, memory sizes)

## Error Handling
- Catch specific exceptions, not bare except clauses
- Provide informative error messages
- Use custom exceptions when appropriate
- Handle missing optional dependencies gracefully

## Memory Tracking Specific
- Always use context managers for resource management
- Clean up hooks and modes properly in exit handlers
- Track both peak and current memory
- Include device information in memory reports

## Testing Considerations
- Mock external dependencies (torch.cuda, distributed)
- Test with both real and fake tensors
- Verify memory calculations are correct
- Test plugin loading and error handling
