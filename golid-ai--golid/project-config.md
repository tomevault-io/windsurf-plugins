# Plan a Feature

Use this structure when planning a new feature module.

## Planning Checklist

1. **Explore existing code** — read the schema, related services, frontend routes. Understand what exists.
2. **Scaffold boilerplate** — run `make new-module name=<module>` to generate migration, service, handler, and route stubs.
3. **Identify the data model** — what tables, enums, relationships are needed? Check if any already exist in `backend/migrations/000001_init.up.sql`.
4. **Define the API surface** — list every endpoint (verb + path + purpose).
5. **Identify auth requirements** — who can do what? Map to the two-layer pattern (handler: authn, service: authz).
6. **Note side effects** — what happens on status changes? Cascading updates? History entries?
7. **Plan seed data** — test accounts need realistic data for manual testing during development.

## Plan Structure (phases)

```
Phase 1: Database Migration
  - New enums, tables, ALTER existing tables
  - Down migration

Phase 1b: Seed Data (immediately after migration)
  - Enables manual testing during backend development

Phase 2: Backend Service
  - Types (input/output structs)
  - Auth helper (verifyXMembership)
  - CRUD methods + business logic

Phase 3: Backend Handler + Routes
  - Request types, validation
  - Handler methods
  - Route registration in main.go

Phase 4: Frontend API Types + Client
  - TypeScript interfaces matching backend structs
  - API client object (itemsApi pattern)

Phase 5: Frontend Pages + Components
  - Sidebar nav entry
  - List page (with filters, empty states)
  - Detail view (modal or page)
```

## Key Decisions to Make Upfront

- **Modal vs page** for detail views — prefer modal for "detail within a list" (notes, items). Use page for standalone content.
- **Transaction boundaries** — identify which operations need multi-write transactions.
- **Permission model** — who can create/read/update/delete? Map to `verifyResourceAccess` or similar. See "Role-Based Permissions" below.
- **Status side effects** — what happens on transitions? Auto-history? Cascading approvals?
- **Computed vs stored** — prefer computed fields (via SQL subquery) over stored aggregates.
- **Side effects** — what happens on key events? Emails, webhooks, audit logging?
- **Real-time updates** — for features that need server push (live notifications, collaborative edits), consider SSE. Exclude SSE endpoints from gzip and timeout middleware in `middleware/stack.go`.

## Role-Based Permissions

When planning a feature, map each action to user roles. Example role levels:

| Role | Who |
|---|---|
| **User** | Can view own data |
| **Admin** | Can create/edit/manage all resources |

In handlers, extract auth and check roles:
```go
userID, err := requireUserID(c)
userType, err := requireUserType(c)
if userType != "admin" {
    return apperror.Forbidden("Admin access required")
}
```

Services accept `userID` directly from the handler (extracted from JWT context) — never look up user details in the service layer for auth purposes.

## Frontend Component Rule

**Use existing components from `~/components` — never create raw HTML equivalents.** If a component doesn't exist, ask before building one.

- Dropdowns/selects: `<Select>` + `<SelectItem>` (not raw `<select>`)
- Multi-select: `<MultiSelect>` + `<MultiSelectItem>`
- Buttons: `<Button>` with variant/size props
- Inputs: `<Input>` with size/variant props
- Textareas: `<Textarea>` with autoGrow
- Modals: `<Modal>` for general, `<DestructiveModal>` for destructive confirms
- Tabs: `<Tabs>` + `<TabList>` + `<Tab>` + `<TabPanel>`
- Status badges: `<Chip>` with variant/size props

Check `frontend/src/components/index.ts` for the full list of available exports before writing UI code.

## Reference Files

- Service pattern: `backend/internal/service/auth.go`, `backend/internal/service/user.go`
- Handler pattern: `backend/internal/handler/auth.go`, `backend/internal/handler/user.go`
- Migration pattern: `backend/migrations/000001_init.up.sql`
- Frontend page: `frontend/src/routes/(private)/dashboard/index.tsx`, `frontend/src/routes/(private)/settings/index.tsx`
- API types: `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- Component barrel: `frontend/src/components/index.ts`
- Auth context helpers: `backend/internal/handler/context.go`
- Frontend auth helpers: `frontend/src/lib/auth.ts`

## Post-Implementation

After implementing, run the audit checklist (`@audit-bugs`) against all new files before considering the feature complete.
