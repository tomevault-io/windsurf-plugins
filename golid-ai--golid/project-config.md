# Frontend Test Workflow

> **Thesis:** Ratchet coverage, keep tests in sync with public interfaces, and verify types before push — workflow discipline prevents silent CI failures.

## Coverage Thresholds

After writing tests, update `vitest.config.ts` thresholds to 5% below the new actual coverage. This prevents regression without blocking future work. Ratchet up as coverage grows.

Current thresholds: `statements: 75, branches: 54, functions: 78, lines: 75` (included files; recalibrated 2026-06-07). CI fails if coverage drops below these. Codecov project gate (`target: 80%`) is documented in `docs/plans/archive/6-7-26/coverage-and-eslint.md`.

## Keep Tests In Sync With Code

Any commit that changes a component's **public interface** must include test updates in the same commit. Public interface means:

- Placeholder text, labels, or rendered copy
- Toast/snackbar message strings (title, subtitle)
- Component swaps (checkbox → button, outline → neutral)
- Props that tests assert on (variant, size, disabled state)
- API mock shapes (new fields, changed signatures)
- Route changes or navigation targets

**Search for affected tests before committing.** Use `rg "the old text"` across `*.test.tsx`, `*.test.ts`, and `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`. If a test references something you changed, fix it in the same commit.

E2E tests (`tests/e2e/`) use browser selectors that match rendered HTML — placeholder changes, button text changes, and form restructuring all break them silently until CI runs. See `write-tests-e2e` for browser-test patterns.

## Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing any test file changes, run both:

```bash
cd frontend && npx vitest run          # runtime tests
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit        # type checking
```

TypeScript catches import errors (non-existent exports, using types as values) that JavaScript silently ignores at runtime. CI runs `npm run typecheck` and will reject type errors even when all tests pass.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Frontend unit + component tests
cd frontend && npm test

# Frontend type check (run before pushing — catches import errors tests miss)
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
```
