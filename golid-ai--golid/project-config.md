# Seed Data Patterns

Follow the established pattern in `dev_seed.sql`.

## UUID Convention

Use stable, predictable UUIDs for cross-referencing:

```sql
-- Entity type encoded in the UUID for readability
-- users:     a0000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000N
-- resources: a0000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000N0
-- items:     a0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000N00
```

Document the UUID mapping at the top of the file so they're easy to find.

## Idempotency

Every INSERT must use `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` or `ON CONFLICT ... DO NOTHING` so the seed can be re-run safely:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, email, ...) VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE SET
  registration_step = EXCLUDED.registration_step,
  email_verified = EXCLUDED.email_verified;
```

## Data Quality

- **Realistic content** — real-sounding names, descriptions, skills. Not "test123" or "Lorem ipsum".
- **All profile fields populated** — except file-based fields (resume_url, microview_url, etc.) which require actual uploads.
- **Varied statuses** — seed entities in different states (new, in_progress, complete, approved) to test all UI states.
- **Realistic timestamps** — use `NOW() - INTERVAL 'N days'` for created/updated dates to simulate a timeline.

## Cross-Entity Relationships

When adding a new entity type, seed the full chain. For example, items require:

1. Users (user, admin)
2. Parent resources (if applicable)
3. Items (varied statuses)
4. Related records (comments, history, etc.)

## When to Update

- After creating a new migration that adds tables — seed sample data immediately.
- When adding a new feature — add seed data that exercises all states visible in the UI.
- Seed data enables manual testing during development. Don't skip it.
