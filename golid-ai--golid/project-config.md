# Document a Module

> **Thesis:** Use this when documenting an existing module. `plan-feature.mdc`
> plans forward. This documents backward — capturing what was built, why, and
> how it behaves.

## Order of Operations

1. **Schema first** — read the migrations in `backend/migrations/` to understand tables, enums, relationships, indexes
2. **Service logic** — read `backend/internal/service/*.go` for business rules, auth checks, transactions, status transitions
3. **Handler surface** — read `backend/internal/handler/*.go` for request validation, response shapes, route registration in `cmd/server/main.go`
4. **Frontend routes** — read `frontend/src/routes/(private)/*.tsx` for pages, modals, state management
5. **Write the spec** — fill the template below

## Evidence Standards

- Every business rule must be marked:
  - `[Verified: service/item.go:142]` — confirmed by reading the code
  - `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` — inferred from naming or partial evidence
- Do NOT invent business rules. If you can't confirm it, mark it unverified.
- Use concrete evidence: function names, line numbers, SQL column names, enum values

## Spec Template

```markdown
# Module: [Name]

> **Thesis:** [One sentence — what this module does and why it exists]

| | |
|---|---|
| **Domain** | [e.g., Core, Billing, User Management] |
| **Complexity** | Low / Medium / High / Critical |
| **Status** | Complete / In Progress / Not Started |

---

## Scope

**Includes:**
- [entities, services, handlers this spec covers]

**Excludes:**
- [what belongs in other module specs]

**Depends On:**
- [other modules referenced by FK or service call]

---

## Entities

Derived from `backend/migrations/*.sql`:

| Table | Key Columns | Relationships | Notes |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| | | | |

---

## State Machine

Derived from service status checks and enum definitions:

| Status | Transitions To | Guard | Side Effects |
|--------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| | | | |

---

## Business Rules

Derived from service methods. Mark each rule.

### Validation
- [Verified: service/x.go:line] Rule description

### Auth / Permissions
- Handler: `requireUserID` + `requireUserType` (authn)
- Service: `verifyResourceAccess` or equivalent (authz)

### Side Effects
- Emails, webhooks, SSE events, cascading status changes
- Fire-and-forget goroutines with `service.Retry()`

---

## API Surface

Derived from handler route registration in `cmd/server/main.go`:

| Method | Route | Handler | Auth | Description |
|--------|-------|---------|------|-------------|
| GET | /api/v1/x | List | JWT | List with pagination |
| POST | /api/v1/x | Create | JWT | Create new |
| GET | /api/v1/x/:id | GetByID | JWT | Get single |
| PUT | /api/v1/x/:id | Update | JWT | Update |
| DELETE | /api/v1/x/:id | Delete | JWT | Soft delete |

---

## Frontend

| Route | Page | Key Components | Data Fetching |
|-------|------|---------------|--------------|
| /x | List page | Table, filters, modals | onMount + signals |

---

## Current Implementation

| Layer | Files |
|-------|-------|
| Handler | `backend/internal/handler/x.go` |
| Service | `backend/internal/service/x.go` |
| Migration | `backend/migrations/000XXX_*.up.sql` |
| Frontend | `frontend/src/routes/(private)/x/` |
| Tests | `backend/internal/handler/x_test.go` |
```

## Complexity Ratings

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| Low | < 500 lines, simple CRUD, no state machine |
| Medium | 500-1,500 lines, has state machine or moderate rules |
| High | 1,500-3,000 lines, complex state machines, financial calcs |
| Critical | 3,000+ lines, polymorphic entities, cross-system deps |

## Output

Save to `docs/modules/[module-name].md`. Create the directory if it doesn't exist.
