description: How to write, update, and maintain Cursor rules — use when creating a new rule or updating an existing one

# Writing Cursor Rules

> **Thesis:** Every rule opens with a thesis. The thesis is the contract —
> everything below it is the implementation.

## Structure

1. **Thesis (required)** — one sentence after the heading. States what the rule
   enforces and why. This is the most important line — a thesis enables the AI
   to generalize to novel situations; a pointer only enables pattern-matching.

2. **Reference files** — "Follow the established patterns in X" goes here,
   not in the thesis. The thesis says _what_; references say _where_.

3. **Sections** — BAD/GOOD examples for the highest-consequence patterns.
   Keep examples minimal — one BAD, one GOOD, showing the exact mistake and fix.

## When to Create a New Rule

- A pattern has been explained 3+ times across conversations
- A bug was caused by violating a convention that isn't written down
- A new file category has no glob coverage

## When to Extend an Existing Rule

- The new guidance applies to the same file glob
- It's a sub-pattern of an existing rule's thesis

## Updating Rules During Execution

When a code change invalidates or reveals a gap in an existing rule, update the
rule in the same pass — not as a follow-up task. Stale rules are worse than
missing rules because they actively mislead.

Update triggers (only these — don't edit rules speculatively):

- Bug fix exposed an unwritten convention → add to the relevant domain rule
- Refactor moved/renamed files referenced by a rule → update the references
- New pattern discovered (naming conflict, type safety convention) → add to
  the rule covering that file category
- Audit finding that should be enforced going forward → add to audit checklist
  AND the relevant domain rule

Keep rule edits minimal — update the specific line or section affected, don't
rewrite the entire rule. The goal is accuracy, not polish.

## Naming

`{domain}-{concern}.mdc` — e.g., `go-service`, `frontend-forms`, `write-tests`.
Workflow rules use verb phrases: `plan-feature`, `document-module`, `audit-bugs`.

## Activation

- **Glob-triggered** for domain rules (fires when editing matching files)
- **Description-triggered** for workflow rules (fires when the task matches)
- **alwaysApply** only for universal guardrails — every line costs context on
  every interaction, so this is reserved for codebase-standards and
  parallel-subagents

## Size

Aim for 40-80 lines of content (excluding frontmatter). Over 120 lines suggests
the rule covers two concerns and should be split.
