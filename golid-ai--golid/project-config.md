# Codebase Audit Checklist

Run this checklist for release readiness audits. Cite exact file paths and line numbers for every finding. Check docs/decisions/ for ADRs before flagging documented design decisions.

## Backend

- [ ] All SQL uses $N parameterized placeholders (no fmt.Sprintf with values)
- [ ] No `_ = fn()` discarded errors in production code
- [ ] No `echo.NewHTTPError` in production code (use apperror)
- [ ] Token refresh is transactional and TOCTOU-safe (atomic UPDATE...RETURNING)
- [ ] Password reset uses SELECT...FOR UPDATE inside transaction
- [ ] Verification tokens hashed with selector/verifier pattern
- [ ] All `rows.Next()` loops check `rows.Err()` after iteration
- [ ] JWT_SECRET rejects CHANGE_ME placeholder at startup
- [ ] Production entrypoint exits on migration failure
- [ ] Timeout middleware uses Echo's built-in (no custom goroutine race)
- [ ] All operational constants in Config struct with env var overrides
- [ ] ForgotPassword/ResendVerification log errors server-side (anti-enumeration: always return 200)

## Frontend

- [ ] Zero `createResource` (use onMount + signals)
- [ ] Zero nested `<Show>` for mutually exclusive content states (use Switch/Match)
- [ ] Zero `window.confirm()` (use DestructiveModal)
- [ ] Zero onMount/createEffect returning cleanup functions (use onCleanup)
- [ ] Zero `any` in production code (test files acceptable)
- [ ] Auth store reacts to token clearing (`auth:session-expired` event)
- [ ] Auth cookie Secure on HTTPS (both set and clear paths)
- [ ] Skip link present with correct target and tabindex
- [ ] Auth guard effects use `on()` syntax (without defer — documented exception in solidjs-pages.mdc)
- [ ] `batch()` wraps signal updates after every `await`

## Security

- [ ] No endpoints leak DB errors or stack traces to clients
- [ ] Rate limiting covers auth (strict) and general API
- [ ] SSE excluded from gzip and timeout middleware
- [ ] CSP configurable via `CSP_POLICY` env var
- [ ] CORS rejects all origins when `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` unset (deny-by-default)
- [ ] Password hashing uses bcrypt with 72-byte max enforcement
- [ ] Refresh token rotation is atomic (revoke + issue in one transaction)

## Tooling — Rename Tool

- [ ] Handles hyphenated names (`my-app` → `MyApp` for PascalCase identifiers)
- [ ] ALL-CAPS form handles hyphens (`my-app` → `MY_APP`, not `MY-APP`)
- [ ] Covers all file types: Go, TSX/TS, CSS, docs, Cursor rules, CI, infra, env files, entrypoints, .gcloudignore, benchmarks, openapi.yaml, scaffold, testutil, teardown.sh
- [ ] ALL-CAPS replacement applied to env files, entrypoints, and config files
- [ ] Validates project name format (lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens)
- [ ] Protects domain (`golid.ai`) from corruption via `replaceInFileSafe`
- [ ] `frontend/.env.example` gets lowercase + titled + ALL-CAPS passes

## Tooling — Scaffold Tool

- [ ] `singularize()` handles -us/-is/-as suffixes (prevents `status` → `statu`)
- [ ] Template includes `rows.Err()` after `rows.Next()` loops
- [ ] Template uses `toast` (not `snackbar`) for success/error notifications
- [ ] Generated Pagination component props match the actual `PaginationProps` interface
- [ ] Generated code compiles without modification (`go build`, `tsc --noEmit`)

## Documentation

- [ ] Zero broken internal links (check all `*.md` files in docs/)
- [ ] README Quick Start works on fresh clone (including JWT_SECRET generation)
- [ ] `docs/quick-start.md` Option B includes JWT_SECRET generation
- [ ] `example-module.md` matches scaffold output: constructor signatures, interface pattern, ParsePagination, 5-arg List with search, rows.Err, Pagination props, toast, reactive page refetch
- [ ] Cursor rules reference correct function names, arities, and store APIs — cross-check against actual source:
  - `go-service.mdc` constructor and `NormalizePagination` signature
  - `write-tests.mdc` constructor and pagination helper
  - `frontend-lib.mdc` store method names
  - `sse-realtime.mdc` `NewSSEHub` signature and notification store
- [ ] CHANGELOG accurate (rule count, coverage thresholds, feature claims)
- [ ] All test counts, coverage numbers, and version badges match actual values
- [ ] Migration numbers in examples don't conflict with existing migrations

## Integration Tests

- [ ] All integration test files compile with current constructor signatures
- [ ] Test assertions match current service behavior (e.g., error codes, return values)
- [ ] Concurrency tests enforce correct outcomes (e.g., exactly 1 success for token refresh race)

## Grading

Score out of 100 with subgrades per category. List every finding with severity:
- **Blocker**: security vulnerability, data loss risk, or generated code that won't compile
- **Important**: incorrect behavior, stale references that mislead developers, or missing coverage
- **Minor**: style inconsistency, cosmetic, or documentation clarity
