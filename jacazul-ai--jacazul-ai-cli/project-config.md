# Jacazul AI CLI — Gemini Bootstrap

## 🏛 Architectural Boundaries

### Structure vs. Dynamics (Setup vs. Runtime)
- **Setup (Structure - `scripts/configure`):** One-time environment preparation. Handles immutable filesystem changes: directory creation, symbolic links in `~/bin`, and initial template deployment. It sets the stage but does not run the show.
- **Runtime (Dynamics - `scripts/bootstrap/`):** Session-specific initialization. Handles mutable configuration and dynamic environment detection: injecting environment variables, surgical updates to settings JSONs (e.g., `experimental.enableAgents`), and locating system resources (e.g., finding the real `task` binary).

## 🔊 Logging Philosophy

The project adheres to a "Silent by Default" logging policy to maintain CLI usability and focus.

- **Standard Execution:** Silence is mandatory if the environment is healthy and checks pass.
- **State Changes:** Output MUST be emitted when the system state is modified (e.g., "Creating directory X").
- **Verification:** Verification of existing resources MUST stay silent unless `DEBUG=true`.
- **Debug Mode:** Enabled via `DEBUG=true`. Provides full verbosity for troubleshooting.
- **Dry Run:** Enabled via `DRY=true`. Allows verifying the entire bootstrap process (Dynamics) without executing the final CLI binary.
- **Error Handling:** Errors MUST be emitted to `stderr` with clear instructional context.

## 🔒 Engineering Mandates

### 1. Taskwarrior Abstraction
- **Mandate:** Agents and tools MUST NOT invoke the raw `task` binary directly.
- **Security:** The raw `task` command is obfuscated to prevent accidental bypass. If an agent encounters the `scripts/task` wrapper, it MUST stop and consult the user.
- **Admin Bypass:** The `rtask` command provides a project-specific bypass to the real binary. This tool is for MANUAL ADMINISTRATIVE USE ONLY.
- **Protocol:** All operations MUST go through the `taskp` project-aware wrapper or the `tw-flow` workflow manager.
- **Isolation:** Project isolation via `TASKDATA` MUST be preserved at all costs.

### 2. Context Preservation
- **Mandate:** Closing a task without documentation is FORBIDDEN.
- **Protocol:** The `tw-flow done` command requires an `OUTCOME:` annotation. Discarded tasks MUST include an automatic audit record.
## 🧠 Session Stabilization & Context Engineering

These directives ensure that the AI ecosystem remains functional and context-aware across different platforms and tool availability states.

### 1. Multi-Agent Diagnostic Loop
- **Protocol:** Technical challenges should follow a cross-agent verification loop. A diagnosis produced by one agent (e.g., Copilot/Haiku) MUST be re-interpreted, validated, and implemented by the session navigator (e.g., Gemini). This ensures that "things work the first time" by using multiple perspectives to identify the root cause before acting.

### 2. Tool-Agnostic Resilience
- **Directive:** Agents MUST be capable of operating in "limbo" states where high-level tools (create/edit) are unavailable.
- **Fallback:** Use base system primitives (standard bash redirection: `cat >`, `touch`, `echo >>`) to achieve filesystem changes. Always verify the state change manually (`ls`, `cat`) after a workaround execution.

### 3. Horizontal Skill Architecture
- **Mandate:** Agents MUST activate required expert skills (`jacazul-engine`, `taskwarrior-expert`, `git-expert`) directly and simultaneously. 
- **Goal:** Avoid cascading dependencies where one skill activates another. Independence ensures that a failure in one subsystem does not blind the entire agent.

### 4. The Keystone Pattern (Context Resolution)
- **Philosophy:** Skills are not "optional tools"—they are the foundation that resolves instruction ambiguity. Activating a skill is equivalent to loading the project's Distribution (Distro).
- **Protocol:** Agents MUST activate the four core required skills in the **first turn**, in parallel with tactical state discovery (e.g., `tw-flow focus`).
- **Resolution:** Mandates defined within a loaded skill ALWAYS take precedence over generic system prompts when resolving operational conflicts. This ensures that the agent adopts the Jacazul identity and technical standards before the first response.

## 🧬 Interaction Standards
- **Context Hunting Protocol:** Agents MUST NOT ask the user for session context that exists in the system. Upon activation, the agent MUST "hunt" for the mission state:
  1. **Orientation (The Anchor):** Run `tw-flow focus`.
  2. **Decision Branch:** IF anchored, run `tw-flow status` and `tw-flow context <uuid>`. IF empty, run `tw-flow ponder` for a strategic overview.
- **UUID Priority:** Tasks MUST be referenced by their 8-character UUID. Numeric Task IDs are transient and MUST NOT be shown to users.
- **Persona Voice:** Responses MUST align with the active persona (Jacazul/Codana) and the detected user language, while persistent data (tasks, commits) remains in English.
- **Agent vs. Skill Distinction:**
  - **Copilot/Opencode:** Use the **Agent** pattern (`jacazul.md` in `~/.copilot/agents`).
  - **Gemini CLI:** Operates via the **Skill** pattern or direct **Onboard Prompt** logic. The `jacazul-engine` skill provides the protocols in this environment.
  - **Claude Code:** Operates via the **Skill** pattern using the `Skill()` tool. Skills (`jacazul-engine`, `taskwarrior-expert`, `git-expert`) MUST be activated in the first turn, in parallel with `tw-flow focus`.
- **Prompt Marketing & Workflow Awareness:** 
  - **Concept:** Low-friction, high-value alerts within scripts (`tw-flow focus`, `onboard`) that notify the user of specific task attributes (e.g., "ALERT: External ticket detected, git-expert will use it for automated commit referencing.").
  - **Goal:** To maintain alignment between the developer's focus and the project's technical requirements (like Git/Ticket integration) without interrupting the productive flow.

## 🎓 Core Lessons Learned

### Behaviour Enforcement
System integrity is maintained by "vaccinating" tools. If an agent tries to bypass the workflow (e.g., calling raw `task` instead of `taskp`), the tool itself MUST intercept and provide tactical guidance. This turns a "rule violation" into a "learning prompt."

### Error as Prompt
Workflow and control scripts MUST NOT simply fail. Their `stderr` output must act as a functional **Prompt** for the Agent.
- **Mandate:** Errors must provide clear tactical guidance (e.g., "Stop and consult the user", "Intent mismatch: use X instead of Y").
- **Goal:** Turn terminal failures into actionable instructions that maintain the Agent's productive flow and adherence to project standards.
- **Pattern:** A failing command is a signal, not a dead end. Read the error, extract the intent, correct the path.

### Test-First (Empirical Failure)
Validation is the only path to finality. No logic change should occur without a prior failing test.
- **Mandate:** Bug fixes and new features MUST start with an empirical reproduction test case (smoke test or script) that fails in the current environment.
- **Goal:** Prove the existence of the problem and verify that the solution actually addresses the root cause.

## 🧪 Platform Testing (GitHub Broker)

- **Test Mandate:** All experimental, POC, or non-production GitHub Broker operations MUST target the dedicated sandbox repository: `jacazul-ai/jacazul-ai-sandbox`.
- **Integrity:** Never create test issues, labels, or milestones in the main `jacazul-ai-cli` repository.

## 🐊 GitHub Broker Protocol (The Protocol)

- **Mandate:** Agents MUST NOT handle raw GitHub tokens or ask the user for credentials.
- **Authority:** The `jacazul-broker` binary (global) or `jacazul.cli.broker` (Python) is the SOLE authority for GitHub interactions.
- **Security:** Credential resolution is hierarchical (Project > Org > User) and handled via `cryptozoid` and `vault.json`.
- **Sync:** Use `jacazul-broker sync #ID` to synchronize GitHub Issue states with Taskwarrior local tasks.
