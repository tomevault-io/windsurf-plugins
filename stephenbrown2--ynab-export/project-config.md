# Agent Instructions for ynab-export

This document provides guidance for LLM agents working in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Go 1.25+ project that exports YNAB budgets for import into Actual Budget. It uses:

- **Go Modules** for dependency management
- **Just** for build automation and task running
- **golangci-lint** for linting and formatting
- **GoReleaser** for automated releases
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Experimental Go features**: `GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2` (required for building)

## Essential Commands

### Always Use `just` Commands

This project uses [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) as the task runner.
**Always prefer `just` commands** over direct `go` commands, as they include necessary
environment setup (like `GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2`).

View all available commands:

```bash
just
```

### After Every Code Change

**CRITICAL**: After making any code changes, always run:

```bash
just lint-fix
```

This will:

- Auto-format code with gofumpt and goimports
- Fix common linting issues automatically
- Ensure code style consistency

### Common Development Workflow

1. **Make code changes** to `.go` files
2. **Run lint-fix** (ALWAYS):

   ```bash
   just lint-fix
   ```

3. **Build and test**:

   ```bash
   just build
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   just run
   ```

5. **Run full checks** before committing:

   ```bash
   just check
   ```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build for current platform
just build

# Build for all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows - amd64 & arm64)
just build-all

# Clean build artifacts
just clean
```

### Linting Commands

```bash
# Auto-fix issues (USE THIS AFTER EVERY CHANGE)
just lint-fix

# Check formatting only
just fmt-check

# Run full linter (checks without fixing)
just lint

# Format code manually
just fmt
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run tests
just test

# Run all checks (format, lint, test)
just check
```

## Important Environment Variables

### GOEXPERIMENT

This project **requires** `GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2` to be set. The Justfile handles this
automatically, which is why you should always use `just` commands.

If you must run `go` commands directly:

```bash
GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go build
GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go run .
GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go test ./...
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Formatting

- Use **gofumpt** (stricter than gofmt)
- Use **goimports** for import ordering
- **Run `just lint-fix` after every change**

### Linting

This project uses golangci-lint with comprehensive rules including:

- `govet`, `errcheck`, `staticcheck`
- `gosimple`, `ineffassign`, `unused`
- `gofumpt`, `goimports`, `misspell`
- `revive`, `stylecheck`, `unconvert`
- And many more (see `.golangci.yml`)

### Commit Messages

Use **Conventional Commits** format:

```text
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

Examples:

```text
feat: add last modified date to budget list
fix: handle empty currency symbol gracefully
docs: update README with new screenshots
chore: update dependencies
```

### Git Configuration

This repository uses **Commit signing**: Enabled (SSH)

## File-Specific Notes

### main.go

- Entry point with CLI flag parsing
- Handles `--version` flag
- Checks for `YNAB_API_TOKEN` environment variable
- Launches Terminal UI (Bubble Tea)

### tui.go

- Implements Bubble Tea state machine for terminal interface
- States: token validation, budget selection, exporting, done, error
- Handles all user interaction and display in terminal mode

### ynab.go

- YNAB API client implementation
- Budget fetching and exporting
- Data structure definitions
- Budget summary calculations
- Provides both async (Bubble Tea messages) and sync (return values) functions

## Release Process

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions when tags are pushed:

```bash
# Create and push a release tag
just release v0.0.2

# Or manually:
git tag -a v0.0.2 -m "Release v0.0.2"
git push origin v0.0.2
```

This triggers:

1. GoReleaser builds binaries for all platforms
2. GitHub Release is created
3. Binaries are uploaded as release assets

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Don't Do This

```bash
# Don't run go commands directly (missing GOEXPERIMENT)
go build
go run .

# Don't skip lint-fix
