# Repository Guidelines

本文件是本仓库的项目级规范，优先于以下跨工具通用规则。

非 Codex 运行环境如果存在全局规则文件，请一并阅读：

- Windows：`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\AGENTS.md`
- macOS / Linux：`~/.codex/AGENTS.md`

## Project Overview

PackingProof-Mobile is a Flutter app for continuous package-recording and shipping-label barcode marking. Android is the primary release target. Recordings, indexes, and settings are stored locally unless the operator explicitly configures LAN backup.

## Project Structure

- `lib/controllers/` contains recording and work-session state machines.
- `lib/services/` contains barcode recognition, persistence, speech, order receiving, and LAN backup logic.
- `lib/screens/` and `lib/widgets/` contain the Flutter UI.
- `test/` contains unit and widget regression tests; `integration_test/` contains device-level flows.
- `android/` and `ios/` contain platform projects.
- `dist/android/` contains generated release artifacts and must not be committed.

## Product Constraints

- Maintain one unified app edition. Do not reintroduce standard/standalone flavors or multiple APK variants.
- Generate fixed speech assets with Edge TTS on the build machine and bundle them in the APK. The app runtime must never call Edge TTS or require internet access; dynamic text and missing assets fall back to Android system TTS in offline-only mode.
- Treat `assets/audio/tts/` and its manifest as tracked release assets, not disposable runtime cache. Reuse valid files and regenerate only missing or changed prompts.
- Keep `flutter_edge_tts` build-tool-only. Do not import it from `lib/` or add any runtime Edge generation path.
- Dynamic speech is not currently persisted. If a runtime speech cache is introduced, keep it separate from bundled assets and add bounded size, stale-entry cleanup, and regression tests.
- The refund warning sound is generated locally and must remain consistent with the desktop warning behavior.
- Barcode scanning and uninterrupted recording are the core workflow. Avoid changes that require touch interaction during normal scanning work.
- Preserve local recordings and settings during upgrades. Never delete recordings based only on missing, stale, or partially matched metadata.
- Recording records, tracking numbers, and video files are strictly one-to-one: one tracking number maps to one independent video file and one recording record. Do not describe, create, or preserve a master-video/sub-video, shared-file, or one-file-to-multiple-records model in product behavior, protocol documentation, developer documentation, or tests.
- Keep LAN backup and remote-recording cleanup semantics distinct from deleting local source recordings.
- Keep the LAN backup device ID derived anonymously from Android ID so the same formally signed app can identify the physical phone again after uninstall/reinstall. Do not expose the raw Android ID.
- Keep at least 2 GB free for recording. Storage-pressure cleanup must reuse guarded file deletion. The default 「优先保留录像」 strategy may remove only computer-verified backups and must never remove unbacked recordings; the explicit 「优先继续录制」 strategy may also delete the oldest unbacked recordings so recording can continue, and must record a cleanup reason for every deletion. Storage notices remain silent and modal reminders are deferred until work ends, at most twice per local day.
- 用户可见文案整段结尾不使用句号（。）；多句提示内部可保留句号分隔。

## 平台能力与实现纪律

- 平台适配器禁止“伪成功、空实现、硬编码占位”：能力要么真实实现，要么不声明并隐藏 UI 入口；不支持的调用必须抛出类型化异常，不得静默返回假数据。
- `PlatformCapabilities` 声明、平台适配器和 UI 入口必须三者一致；新增平台边界时同时核对这三处并补充测试。
- 现有 iOS 占位实现（存储回收、Wi-Fi 检测、网络诊断、解码能力探测等）按审计清单逐步替换为真实现，禁止再新增同类占位。

## 必读专项文档

- 日常命令、保留数据的 Android 安装、Mac/Windows 对等 SSH 验证或跨机同步：必须阅读 `docs/cross-machine-development.md`
- 修改 iOS、Xcode、CocoaPods、Flutter iOS 插件或 IPA 构建：必须阅读 `docs/ios-development.md`
- 修改局域网发现、配对、鉴权、上传、回执、远程播放或清理：必须阅读 `docs/mobile-backup-v2.md`
- 构建本地 Release 测试 APK、准备版本、签名、打 tag 或发布：必须阅读 `docs/android-release.md` 和 `RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md`；`docs/android-release.md` 的「脚本总览」是发布的唯一入口清单，先跑 `./Tools/Check-ReleasePrereqs.sh` 自检，不要自行拼凑发布命令
- 发布凭据一律通过仓库根目录 `.env` 提供，键名见已跟踪的 `.env.example`；缺凭据时向持有发布权限的人索取或重新签发，禁止从 shell 历史、会话记录或其他缓存中翻找密钥

## Testing

- 发布门禁是本地 CI：`./Tools/test-ci.sh`，检查项与 `.github/workflows/ci.yml` 一致。CI 分 macOS 与 Windows 两半，脚本只跑当前机器那一半并显式列出跳过项，发布前两半都要在各自机器跑通。
- Add or update focused tests for every behavior change.
- Run the affected test file while iterating.
- Before committing, run `flutter analyze` and the relevant tests.
- Recording, camera, audio, permissions, background lifecycle, installation upgrades, and LAN backup changes still require real-device validation when affected.

## Change Discipline

- Keep changes focused and preserve the existing Flutter/Dart style.
- Before investigating or fixing a bug, first search upstream GitHub issues and PRs for the affected component (Flutter framework, plugins, native dependencies), note the relevant issue/PR numbers and conclusions, then implement.
- Keep `README.md` product-facing: describe user value, setup, privacy, and download paths; put internal implementation rules in this file or focused developer documentation.
- Do not mix unrelated fixes, features, refactors, documentation, or release maintenance in one commit.
- Avoid broad formatting, generated-file churn, dependency upgrades, or platform changes unless required.
