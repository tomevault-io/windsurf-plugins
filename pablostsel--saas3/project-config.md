 # Template-specific Features

## Problem
Each template may have unique features that require special handling.

## Details
Templates have unique visual elements and interactions that define their identity. Modifying shared components without understanding template-specific features can break these unique elements.

## Example
Template2 has laptop-style project cards that require specific CSS and HTML structure. Changing the layout structure without understanding this feature would break the laptop display.

## Solution
- Understand the special features of each template before modifying
- Preserve unique visual elements that define each template's identity
- Test template-specific interactions after making changes
- When adding features to one template, consider if they should be template-specific or shared across all templates
- Document any special template-specific features for future reference
