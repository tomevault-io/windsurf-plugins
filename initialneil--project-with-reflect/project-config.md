# project-with-reflect

When the user asks to register, check in to, manage, or reflect on a project/connection, follow
`skills/project-with-reflect/SKILL.md`.

Core loop: load the generated project or connection skill first, work while logging notable events,
record durable results immediately, then run reflect to distill logs into lessons and decisions.

Use `$PROJECT_WITH_REFLECT_ROOT` for persistent state. Keep secrets out of disk state; store env-var
names or ssh aliases only.
