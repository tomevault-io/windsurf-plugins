Next Steps
At this point the AMM is up and running, and trades in the DEX automatically use this AMM in combination with Offers to achieve the best exchange rate possible between the two assets in the AMM's pool. If the flow of funds between the two assets is relatively balanced and there are no major shifts in the value of one asset compared to the other, this can become a source of passive income for you and anyone else who deposits liquidity into the AMM's pool.
When you want to withdraw liquidity from the AMM, you can use [AMMDeposit][] to cash in your LP Tokens to receive a share of the AMM's assets. You can also use LP Tokens like any other tokens in the XRP Ledger, which means you can trade them, use them in payments, or even deposit them in another AMM.

To ensure the front-end implementation aligns with the recommendations from the XRPL documentation on trading in the decentralized exchange (DEX), we should follow the practices and functions as outlined in the XRPL tutorial.

Version 1 – Functionality in the Front End
To implement the AMM interface directly in the front end using JavaScript, you will leverage the xrpl.js library to interact with the XRPL AMM. Here's how to set it up:
Step 1: Setup xrpl.js in Your Front-End Project
First, ensure you have xrpl.js installed in your project. If you are using a package manager like npm or yarn, you can install it as follows:
Bash:
npm install xrpl
Step 2: Configure Your Wallet
You need to configure your wallet to connect to the XRPL and perform transactions.
Javascript:
import { Client, Wallet, Transaction } from 'xrpl';

const client = new Client('wss://s1.ripple.com');
await client.connect();
const wallet = Wallet.fromSeed('your-wallet-seed');  // Replace with your actual seed

Step 3: Create the Swap Function
Create a function that handles the swap operation by interacting with the XRPL AMM.
Javascript:
async function performSwap(inputAmount, inputCurrency, outputCurrency) {
  try {
    // Prepare the transaction
    const transaction = {
      TransactionType: 'AMMTrade',
      Account: wallet.address,
      TakerPays: {
        currency: inputCurrency,
        value: inputAmount
      },
      TakerGets: {
        currency: outputCurrency,
      }
    };

    // Autofill and sign the transaction
    const prepared = await client.autofill(transaction);
    const signed = wallet.sign(prepared);

    // Submit the transaction
    const result = await client.submitAndWait(signed.tx_blob);

    if (result.resultCode === 'tesSUCCESS') {
      console.log('Swap successful', result);
      return result;
    } else {
      console.error('Swap failed', result);
      throw new Error(result.resultMessage);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error performing swap:', error);
  }
}
Step 4: Implement Front-End UI
Create a simple user interface to allow users to input their swap details and trigger the performSwap function.

  <h1>XRPL AMM Swap</h1>
  <form id="swap-form">
    <label for="inputAmount">Input Amount:</label>
    <input type="text" id="inputAmount" name="inputAmount" required>
    <label for="inputCurrency">Input Currency:</label>
    <input type="text" id="inputCurrency" name="inputCurrency" required>
    <label for="outputCurrency">Output Currency:</label>
    <input type="text" id="outputCurrency" name="outputCurrency" required>
    <button type="submit">Swap</button>
  </form>

  <script src="bundle.js"></script>  <!-- Assuming you bundle your JS files -->
  <script>
    document.getElementById('swap-form').addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      
      const inputAmount = document.getElementById('inputAmount').value;
      const inputCurrency = document.getElementById('inputCurrency').value;
      const outputCurrency = document.getElementById('outputCurrency').value;

      try {
        const result = await performSwap(inputAmount, inputCurrency, outputCurrency);
        console.log('Swap Result:', result);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Swap Error:', error);
      }
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
Step 5: Bundle Your JavaScript
If you are using a bundler like Webpack or Parcel, make sure to include your script and configure the bundler to handle the xrpl package.

Summary
By following these steps, you can implement an XRPL AMM swap interface directly in the front end using JavaScript. This setup allows users to perform swaps via the XRPL AMM seamlessly. This method leverages the xrpl.js library to interact with the XRP Ledger, managing wallet operations, transaction preparation, signing, and submission all from the front end.
