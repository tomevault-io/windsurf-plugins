# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ClaudeCodeMonitor is a macOS menubar application that monitors Claude Code API usage and costs. It wraps the [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) CLI tool to provide real-time usage tracking with a native macOS interface.

## Build and Run Commands

```bash
# Run tests
swift test

# Build debug version
swift build

# Build release version
swift build -c release

# Create app bundle (required after CLI build)
mkdir -p ClaudeCodeMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS
mkdir -p ClaudeCodeMonitor.app/Contents/Resources
cp .build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/ClaudeCodeMonitor ClaudeCodeMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/
cp Info.plist ClaudeCodeMonitor.app/Contents/
open ClaudeCodeMonitor.app

# Build release with code signing (requires Developer ID)
./scripts/build-release.sh

# Open in Xcode (recommended for development)
open Package.swift
# Then Build (⌘B) and Run (⌘R) in Xcode

# Clean up processes if needed
killall ClaudeCodeMonitor 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **ccusage Integration**: Directly executes ccusage via CommandExecutor (bunx preferred, npx fallback)
2. **Session-Based Monitoring**: Claude Code uses 5-hour session blocks with token limits
3. **Real-Time Updates**: 5-minute auto-refresh with manual refresh option
4. **MainActor Isolation**: SwiftUI views and UsageMonitor are @MainActor isolated

### Command Execution Strategy
- **CommandExecutor.swift**: Manages ccusage command execution
- Preference order: bunx > npx
- Automatic fallback if preferred command is not available
- Environment setup validation before app launch
- **Version Pinning**: ccusage is pinned to version 15.3.0 to prevent breaking changes

### Dependency Management
- **package.json**: Defines ccusage version.
- **Dependabot**: Configured to check for updates weekly.
- **Info.plist**: The ccusage version is automatically inserted into Info.plist during the build process by the `scripts/update-ccusage-version.sh` script.
- **Format Tests**: CcusageFormatTests.swift ensures output format compatibility.
- **Xcode Build Phase**: A 'Run Script' phase in Xcode executes the update script. To set this up manually:
  1. In Xcode, select the `ClaudeCodeMonitor` project, then the `ClaudeCodeMonitor` target.
  2. Go to the `Build Phases` tab.
  3. Click `+` and choose `New Run Script Phase`.
  4. Name it "Update ccusage Version".
  5. In the script area, add: `"$SRCROOT/scripts/update-ccusage-version.sh"`
  6. Drag this new phase to be right after the `Dependencies` phase.
- When updating ccusage version:
  1. Dependabot will open a PR to update `package.json`.
  2. After merging, the new version is automatically used in the next build.
  3. Run CcusageFormatTests to verify compatibility.

### Environment Requirements
- Claude Code installed (~/.claude/projects directory)
- Either Bun (bunx) or Node.js (npx) installed
- EnvironmentSetupView guides users through missing requirements

### Key Components

**AppDelegate.swift**
- Manages NSStatusItem (menubar icon) and NSPopover
- Updates menubar display: SF Symbol + percentage (e.g., "bolt.fill 24%")
- Handles popover show/hide with outside click detection
- Checks environment requirements on launch

**UsageMonitor.swift**
- Central data management with @Published properties
- Direct command execution via CommandExecutor
- Handles Pro/Max5/Max20 plan detection and persistence
- Implements UsageMonitoring protocol for dependency injection
- Key methods: `fetchUsageData()`, `startMonitoring()`, `stopMonitoring()`

**CommandExecutor.swift**
- Executes ccusage commands with bunx/npx
- Handles command detection and fallback logic
- Provides environment checking functionality
- Thread-safe singleton pattern

**EnvironmentSetupView.swift**
- Replaces ClaudeNotInstalledView
- Comprehensive environment checking
- Guides users to install missing dependencies
- Shows Claude Code, Bun, and Node.js status

**ContentView.swift**
- Three-tab interface: Current Session / History / Settings
- CurrentSessionView: Large remaining tokens display, progress bar, burn rate
- Compact 480x300 popover with scrollable content
- Visual effects blur background for modern appearance

**SessionModels.swift**
- Token limits: Pro (7K), Max5 (35K), Max20 (140K) per 5-hour session
- Auto-detects plan from historical usage or manual selection
- Calculates burn rate, remaining time, and usage percentage
- Extends UsageData with session-specific properties

**NotificationManager.swift**
- Sends notification when usage reaches 90%
- One notification per session (tracked by session ID)
- Handles Xcode debug build limitations with bundle checks
- Implements UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with mocks for UsageMonitor and network services
- CI environment detection to skip locale-dependent tests
- Test files follow naming pattern: `*Tests.swift`
- Mock implementations in `Tests/ClaudeUsageMonitorTests/Mocks/`

### Localization
- Supports English and Japanese
- Uses Localization.swift with generated L10n enum
- Resource bundles in `Sources/ClaudeUsageMonitor/Resources/`
