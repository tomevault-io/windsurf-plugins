# Agent Runtime 🤖

Bitterbot runs a single embedded agent runtime derived from **pi-mono**.

## Workspace (required)

Bitterbot uses a single agent workspace directory (`agents.defaults.workspace`) as the agent’s **only** working directory (`cwd`) for tools and context.

Recommended: use `bitterbot setup` to create `~/.bitterbot/bitterbot.json` if missing and initialize the workspace files.

Full workspace layout + backup guide: [Agent workspace](/concepts/agent-workspace)

If `agents.defaults.sandbox` is enabled, non-main sessions can override this with
per-session workspaces under `agents.defaults.sandbox.workspaceRoot` (see
[Gateway configuration](/gateway/configuration)).

## Bootstrap files (injected)

Inside `agents.defaults.workspace`, Bitterbot expects these user-editable files:

- `GENOME.md` — immutable identity blueprint (safety axioms, hormonal homeostasis, phenotype constraints, core values)
- `MEMORY.md` — living working memory (Phenotype, Bond, Niche, active context), rewritten by the Dream Engine
- `PROTOCOLS.md` — operating instructions + behavioral protocols
- `TOOLS.md` — user-maintained tool notes (camera names, SSH hosts, voice preferences)
- `HEARTBEAT.md` — optional tiny checklist for heartbeat runs

On the first turn of a new session, Bitterbot injects the contents of these files directly into the agent context.

Blank files are skipped. Large files are trimmed and truncated with a marker so prompts stay lean (read the file for full content).

If a file is missing, Bitterbot injects a single “missing file” marker line (and `bitterbot setup` will create a safe default template).

To disable bootstrap file creation entirely (for pre-seeded workspaces), set:

```json5
{ agent: { skipBootstrap: true } }
```

## Built-in tools

Core tools (read/exec/edit/write and related system tools) are always available,
subject to tool policy. `apply_patch` is optional and gated by
`tools.exec.applyPatch`. `TOOLS.md` does **not** control which tools exist; it’s
guidance for how _you_ want them used.

## Skills

Bitterbot loads skills from three locations (workspace wins on name conflict):

- Bundled (shipped with the install)
- Managed/local: `~/.bitterbot/skills`
- Workspace: `<workspace>/skills`

Skills can be gated by config/env (see `skills` in [Gateway configuration](/gateway/configuration)).

## Heritage

Bitterbot's channel routing and base agent runner build on the pi-mono framework. Session management, multi-agent orchestration, tool wiring, the biological memory system, economic layer, P2P network, and identity architecture are all Bitterbot-original.

## Sessions

Session transcripts are stored as JSONL at:

- `~/.bitterbot/agents/<agentId>/sessions/<SessionId>.jsonl`

The session ID is stable and chosen by Bitterbot.

## Steering while streaming

When queue mode is `steer`, inbound messages are injected into the current run.
The queue is checked **after each tool call**; if a queued message is present,
remaining tool calls from the current assistant message are skipped (error tool
results with "Skipped due to queued user message."), then the queued user
message is injected before the next assistant response.

When queue mode is `followup` or `collect`, inbound messages are held until the
current turn ends, then a new agent turn starts with the queued payloads. See
[Queue](/concepts/queue) for mode + debounce/cap behavior.

Block streaming sends completed assistant blocks as soon as they finish; it is
**off by default** (`agents.defaults.blockStreamingDefault: "off"`).
Tune the boundary via `agents.defaults.blockStreamingBreak` (`text_end` vs `message_end`; defaults to text_end).
Control soft block chunking with `agents.defaults.blockStreamingChunk` (defaults to
800–1200 chars; prefers paragraph breaks, then newlines; sentences last).
Coalesce streamed chunks with `agents.defaults.blockStreamingCoalesce` to reduce
single-line spam (idle-based merging before send). Non-Telegram channels require
explicit `*.blockStreaming: true` to enable block replies.
Verbose tool summaries are emitted at tool start (no debounce); Control UI
streams tool output via agent events when available.
More details: [Streaming + chunking](/concepts/streaming).

## Model refs

Model refs in config (for example `agents.defaults.model` and `agents.defaults.models`) are parsed by splitting on the **first** `/`.

- Use `provider/model` when configuring models.
- If the model ID itself contains `/` (OpenRouter-style), include the provider prefix (example: `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2`).
- If you omit the provider, Bitterbot treats the input as an alias or a model for the **default provider** (only works when there is no `/` in the model ID).

## Configuration (minimal)

At minimum, set:

- `agents.defaults.workspace`
- `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom` (strongly recommended)
