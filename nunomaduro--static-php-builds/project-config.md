# The project

Read `.hod/PROJECT.md` first. It holds the intention of this project.

`hod` writes this file. Write no sentence in it, because `hod update` writes it again. Write the intention of the project in `.hod/PROJECT.md`. Write a rule in a file in `.hod/rules/`. Write a skill in a directory in `.hod/skills/`.

---

## 1. The reader of this file

This file is for a coding agent. No user reads it. Write an instruction that an agent obeys during its work, then stop. Do not write an introduction, a conclusion, an argument for a decision that the project made, or a sentence that no agent can obey. Give a reason only when the reason changes the next decision of the agent.

Start each rule with a verb in the imperative. Put the condition before the instruction. Give the exact path, the exact command and the exact name that the agent must use. If a rule needs a test, give the command that does the test.

The public files are different. `README.md`, the website, the release notes and the `description` in each manifest are for a user. Section 3 controls them. Section 5 controls each message that you give the user.

## 2. How to write for an agent

Write in [ASD-STE100](https://www.asd-ste100.org) Simplified Technical English: one instruction in one sentence, the imperative, the active voice, one meaning for one word, no contraction, and no synonym for variety. The standard holds the full rules. Do not copy them here. Four items keep their exact form: a quotation from a standard, an identifier in the code, a path or a command, and a name from a different supplier.

Write GitHub flavored Markdown. Put one `#` heading in a file. Write one paragraph on one line, thus a change stays small in `git diff`. Number the sections of a long file, thus a different file can point to "section 3". Put a path, a command and a name from the code in `code font`.

Write the intention of the project in `.hod/PROJECT.md`. Write a decision about one directory in the `AGENTS.md` file of that directory. If `.hod/PROJECT.md` and the `AGENTS.md` file of a directory disagree, obey `.hod/PROJECT.md` and correct the other file.

Write no new rule. This is the correct result of each task, and a task that adds a command, a module or a workflow does not change it. A rule needs a fault that happened: name the decision that you made wrong, or name the decision that these files refused to give you. A wrong change that you imagine is not a fault, thus write no rule to protect the code that you write today.

A fact that you learned during one task is not a rule. Use it in that task, then write no sentence for it.

`.hod/PROJECT.md` holds two items: the intention of the project, and a reason that the code cannot hold. Write no sentence below that level.

Write no sentence for a fact that an agent finds when it reads the code. The cost of that read does not change the answer: a fact that four files hold is in the code. Put the fact in the code first, because a test stops the agent that breaks it and a sentence here does not.

Ask the user before you write a rule. Give the fault, and write the rule after the user agrees. Give the file the path `.hod/rules/<name>.md`. Give `<name>` two or three words with a hyphen between them, and name the subject of the rule. Give the file `name` and `description` in its front matter, and write one rule in one file. Run `hod update --project` after the write, thus this file names the rule in section 6. Keep the number of the rules: delete a rule file in the same change, or ask the user to accept one more rule. A correction from the user is a rule and needs no question: write it in a file before you continue the work.

When the user asks you to learn or to remember a fact, treat the request as a correction: write the fact in `.hod/rules/<name>.md` in the form of this section, then run `hod update --project`. Write no fact into the memory directory of Claude Code or of a different client, and read no fact from that directory, because a file outside the project reaches no other client and no other computer.

Give no new part of the program its own rule, because the code of that part holds its design. Delete text that follows the order of a file of source code: that text describes the file, and the file describes itself. Replace an old rule. Do not write a second rule near it. Delete a rule that the project does not obey. Do not keep a record of what the project stopped doing, in a file or in a directory. Git holds the history.

## 3. How to write the public text

These rules control `README.md`, the website, the release notes, the announcement and the `description` in each manifest. Sections 1 and 2 do not control these files.

The voice is calm and certain. Say what the project does, then stop. Do not say that the project is fast, simple, powerful or intelligent. Show the command and let the reader form that opinion. Cut each superlative. Cut each sentence that a competitor can also write about itself.

Write for one person and call that person "you". Put the result first and the mechanism second. Keep the sentences short, and let one sentence stand alone when it carries the idea. A demonstration is the strongest argument: one command in a terminal is worth one paragraph of adjectives.
