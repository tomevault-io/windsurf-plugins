# Floxenvs — Agent Instructions

## Overview

This repo contains ready-to-use
[Flox](https://flox.dev) environments published to
[FloxHub](https://hub.flox.dev/flox). Each environment
follows a dual-layer pattern and is tested, containerized,
and published via GitHub Actions CI.

## Dual-layer pattern

Every environment has two layers:

### Minimal (`<name>/`)

Designed for `[include]` composition. Users include
this in their own manifest:

```toml
[include]
environments = [{ remote = "flox/<name>" }]
```

Rules for minimal environments:

- No gum, no coreutils, no spinner UI
- No sample project files
- No `[options]` systems list (ADR-004)
- Use `pkg-group = "<name>"` for the main package
- Use `schema-version = "1.10.0"` or newer
- Silent hooks (no echo/print on activate)
- Store data in `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/<name>`
- Service commands must re-derive the data path
  (don't rely on hook exports)
- Port numbers prefixed with `1` (ADR-003):
  PostgreSQL 15432, Redis 16379, MySQL 13306, etc.
- Include a comment block showing `[include]` usage
- `test.sh` verifies commands exist and services start
- `README.md` documents usage, variables, and links
  to demo

### Demo (`<name>-demo/`)

Interactive variant with gum UI and sample projects:

```toml
[include]
environments = [
  { dir = "../<name>" }
]

[install]
gum.pkg-path = "gum"
gum.pkg-group = "demo-tools"
```

Rules for demo environments:

- Always includes the minimal env via `[include]`
- Adds `gum` in `demo-tools` pkg-group
- Hook shows a styled banner (skip when
  `FLOX_ENVS_TESTING=1`)
- Contains sample project files (requirements.txt,
  package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
- `test.sh` verifies the sample project works
- `README.md` includes setup walkthrough

## Writing a new environment

### Step 1: Create minimal environment

```bash
mkdir -p <name>/.flox/env
```

Write `<name>/.flox/env/manifest.toml`:

```toml
schema-version = "1.10.0"

# Minimal <Name> environment for use with [include].
#
# Include it in your own manifest:
#
#   [include]
#   environments = [{ remote = "flox/<name>" }]

[install]
<pkg>.pkg-path = "<pkg>"
<pkg>.pkg-group = "<name>"

[vars]
# Environment variables with sensible defaults

[hook]
on-activate = '''
# Setup logic: create cache dirs, detect changes, etc.
'''

[services]
# Optional: service definitions
```

Generate the lockfile:

```bash
cd <name> && flox edit -f .flox/env/manifest.toml
```

Write `<name>/test.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eo pipefail

if ! command -v <cmd> >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Error: '<cmd>' command not found."
  exit 1
fi
echo ">>> <cmd> version: $(<cmd> --version)"
echo ">>> <name> environment is working"
```

Write `<name>/README.md` documenting:

- What it provides
- `[include]` usage (dir and FloxHub)
- Configuration variables
- How services work (if applicable)
- Link to `<name>-demo`

### Step 2: Create demo environment

```bash
mkdir -p <name>-demo && cd <name>-demo && flox init
```

Write the manifest with `[include]` and gum.
Apply: `flox edit -f .flox/env/manifest.toml`

Add sample project files, test.sh, README.md.

### Step 3: Add CI workflow

Create `.github/workflows/ci_<name>.yml`:

```yaml
name: "CI: <name>"

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
    paths:
      - "<name>/**"
      - "<name>-demo/**"
      - "flake.nix"
      - "flake.lock"
      - "scripts/**"
      - ".github/workflows/environment.yml"
      - ".github/workflows/ci_<name>.yml"
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "<name>/**"
      - "<name>-demo/**"
      - "flake.nix"
      - "flake.lock"
      - "scripts/**"
      - ".github/workflows/environment.yml"
      - ".github/workflows/ci_<name>.yml"
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: "read"
  packages: "write"
  attestations: "write"
  id-token: "write"

jobs:
  run:
    uses: "./.github/workflows/environment.yml"
    with:
      environment: "<name>"
    secrets: inherit
```

No change to `ci.yml` or `scripts/wait-should-poll.sh` is
