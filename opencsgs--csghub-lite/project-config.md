# Network & Proxy Conventions

The dev environment requires proxy for external sites but direct access for internal sites.

## Rules

- **GitHub / PyPI / external sites**: Run `source ~/.myshrc` first to enable proxy.
- **GitLab (`git-devops.opencsg.com`) / internal sites**: Use direct connection. If proxy was previously enabled, run `unset https_proxy` before accessing.

## Git Push Workflow

When pushing to both remotes:

1. Push to **GitLab** first (no proxy needed): `git push gitlab main`
2. Then push to **GitHub** (proxy needed): `source ~/.myshrc && git push origin main`

## Download / Upload Workflow

- Downloading from GitHub releases: `source ~/.myshrc` then `curl` / `wget`
- Uploading to GitLab: `unset https_proxy` then use GitLab API

## GitLab API token (local only)

- **`local/secrets.env`** (gitignored): set `GITLAB_TOKEN="glpat-..."` for `scripts/push.sh`.
- Copy from `local/secrets.env.example`. **`scripts/push.sh` auto-sources `local/secrets.env`** when `GITLAB_TOKEN` is unset.
- **Never commit** `local/secrets.env`. If a PAT was pasted in chat, **revoke and rotate** it in GitLab.
