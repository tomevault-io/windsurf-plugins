# Cross-Platform Compatibility

csghub-lite must run on **macOS, Linux, and Windows**. Every code change must consider all three platforms.

## File Paths

- Always use `filepath.Join()`, never hardcode `/` or `\` separators.
- Use `os.UserHomeDir()` instead of hardcoding `$HOME` or `%USERPROFILE%`.

## Binary & Library Names

- Binaries: `llama-server` on Unix, `llama-server.exe` on Windows. Use `exec.LookPath()` which handles this automatically.
- Shared libraries differ per platform:
  - macOS: `.dylib`
  - Linux: `.so`, `.so.*`
  - Windows: `.dll`
- When scanning for libraries, always check all three suffixes using `runtime.GOOS`.

## Process & Permission Management

- `sudo` does not exist on Windows. Use `runtime.GOOS` to branch:
  - Unix: `sudo` for privilege escalation
  - Windows: `cmd /C` or prompt the user to run as Administrator
- Signal handling: `syscall.SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` work differently on Windows.

## Environment Variables

- Library search paths differ:
  - macOS: `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  - Linux: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  - Windows: `PATH` (DLLs are found via PATH)
- Use `os.PathListSeparator` (`:` on Unix, `;` on Windows), never hardcode.

## Shell Scripts

- `scripts/install.sh` covers macOS + Linux.
- `scripts/install.ps1` covers Windows.
- Changes to install/uninstall logic must update **both** scripts.

## Default Install Locations

| Platform | csghub-lite | llama-server |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| macOS    | `/usr/local/bin` | same dir or `/opt/homebrew/bin` |
| Linux    | `/usr/local/bin` | same dir |
| Windows  | `$HOME\bin`      | same dir |

## Testing Checklist

When modifying platform-sensitive code, verify:

1. Path construction uses `filepath.Join()`
2. Binary/library lookups cover all three OS variants
3. Permission escalation branches on `runtime.GOOS`
4. Environment variable names are platform-appropriate
5. Install script changes are reflected in both `.sh` and `.ps1`
