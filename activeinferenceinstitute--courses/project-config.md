| `software/` | Python engine: 21 modules, 22 scripts, 18 docs, 1,021 tests | [AGENTS.md](software/AGENTS.md) |
| `summaries/` | Generated course summaries | [AGENTS.md](summaries/AGENTS.md) |

## Universal Rules

### 1. Real Methods Only

All code and content must use **real methods** — no mocks, stubs, fakes, `[TODO]`, `[PLACEHOLDER]`, or `TBD` markers. Every function must have a real implementation; every module must contain substantive, accurate content.

### 2. Modular, Intelligent, Functional, Logged, Tested, Documented

Every component must be:

- **Modular** — Self-contained, reusable, independently testable
- **Intelligent** — Thoughtfully designed with clear purpose
- **Functional** — Working implementation with proper error handling
- **Logged** — Appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Tested** — Covered by real tests (no mocks)
- **Documented** — README.md and AGENTS.md at every level

### 3. AGENTS.md at Every Level

Every directory in this repository must have an `AGENTS.md` file that documents:

- Directory purpose and contents
- Critical rules and conventions for that context
- Links to child and parent AGENTS.md files

### 4. Audience-Appropriate Content

Course content must match the target audience's level:

| Level | Formalism | Code | Lab Style |
|-------|-----------|------|-----------|
| ES (K-5) | None | None | Stories, drawing |
| Family (0-6) | None | None | Parent-child activities |
| MS (6-8) | Fractions | Scratch | Group challenges |
| HS (9-12) | Algebra | Python basics | Guided labs |
| 101 (Undergrad) | Full notation | Python/NumPy | Simulations, essays |
| Core (Graduate) | Full formalism | Custom library | Case studies, proofs |
| 401 (PhD) | Advanced | Research code | Seminars, proposals |

### 5. The 8-Topic Spine

All 10 courses follow this exact topic order in every unit:

1. **Systems** → 2. **Agents** → 3. **Perception** → 4. **Cognition** → 5. **Action** → 6. **Learning** → 7. **Communication** → 8. **Planning**

This order is fixed and reflects the logical dependency chain of the Free Energy Principle.

## Cross-Reference Convention

Always use relative paths when linking between files:

```markdown
See [QUICKSTART.md](software/docs/QUICKSTART.md) for setup instructions.
See [Curriculum Overview](course_development/README.md) for the full course map.
```
