# AGENTS.md

Before making implementation changes, read and follow the repo-wide
[`CODING_STANDARDS.md`](./CODING_STANDARDS.md).

## First-time setup

Run once after cloning to activate the committed git hooks:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The pre-commit hook keeps `model_prices_backup.json` in sync with the
upstream litellm JSON on every commit. It warns and skips silently if
the network is unavailable — it never blocks a commit.

## MCP integration invariants

`mcp_server_ids` (in `AgentDraft`) is the **sole source of truth** for which
MCP integrations are attached to an agent.

- `createInputFromDraft` must derive `mcp_servers` and `mcp_toolset` tool
  entries exclusively from `mcp_server_ids`. Never read `mcp_toolset` entries
  back out of `draft.tools` to build the output — those may be stale.
- Strip all `mcp_toolset` entries from `draft.tools` before building
  `allTools`, then append fresh toolsets from `resolvedMcpServers`.
- Only emit a toolset for an ID that resolved to a known `INTEGRATIONS` entry.
  An ID with no matching integration produces no toolset and no server URL.

On the backend (`runtime_provision.rs`), `integration_mcp_toolsets` must
cross-check each toolset's `mcp_server_name` against the resolved `mcp_servers`
list. Any toolset whose server name is absent from `mcp_servers` is dropped.
