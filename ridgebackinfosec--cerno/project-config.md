# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## General Development Principles

**IMPORTANT**: Always adhere to Python development and architecture best practices when working on this project.

This includes:

- **Code Quality**: Follow PEP 8 style guidelines, use type hints for function signatures, clear and descriptive naming conventions, and proper docstrings for modules, classes, and functions
- **Architecture**: Apply SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion), maintain separation of concerns, follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and use dependency injection and loose coupling
- **Database Design**: ALWAYS follow relational database best practices and SQLite-specific optimizations (see Database Design Principles section below). Normalize data properly, avoid redundant storage, use foreign keys, leverage SQL views for computed values, and design for query efficiency
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for isolated logic, integration tests for database/filesystem operations, use parametrized tests for multiple input variations, and maintain high coverage on critical paths
- **Error Handling**: Use specific exception types, proper context managers for resources, and graceful degradation where appropriate
- **Performance**: Write efficient database queries, implement caching where beneficial, and avoid N+1 query patterns
- **Security**: Validate all inputs, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, and prevent command injection vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: Always update relevant documentation alongside code changes to keep everything synchronized and up-to-date automatically. This includes docstrings, CLAUDE.md, README.md, and **MANDATORY** updates to the [Unreleased] section in CHANGELOG.md for all user-visible code changes
- **Smoke Testing**: After completing ANY changes (code, documentation, configuration), ALWAYS provide a concise smoke test summary with manual testing steps the user can perform to verify the changes work correctly. Include specific commands, expected outputs, and edge cases to validate
- **Git Operations**: The user handles all git staging and commits manually. However, ALWAYS provide a concise one-line git commit message suggestion that accurately describes the change following conventional commit format (e.g., "feat: add user authentication", "fix: resolve parsing edge case", "docs: update installation guide", "refactor: extract validation logic"). Keep messages under 72 characters when possible. Do NOT execute git commands like `git add` or `git commit` - only provide the suggested commit message

## Database Design Principles

**CRITICAL**: Cerno uses SQLite as its primary data store. ALL database design and modifications MUST follow these principles:

### Normalization (Required)
1. **Eliminate Redundant Data**: Never store derived/computed values (counts, sums, durations) in tables - use SQL aggregation or views instead
2. **Lookup Tables**: Extract reference data (severity levels, artifact types, etc.) into separate lookup tables with foreign key constraints
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of data should exist in exactly one place - use JOINs to combine data, not duplication
4. **Functional Dependencies**: If column B is always determined by column A, create a separate table or use a view

### Foreign Key Integrity (Required)
1. **Always Define FKs**: Every relationship between tables MUST use `FOREIGN KEY` constraints
2. **Enable FK Enforcement**: Use `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` on all connections (already configured in database.py)
3. **Cascade Behavior**: Explicitly define `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON DELETE SET NULL` for each FK based on business logic
4. **Referential Integrity**: Design schema to prevent orphaned records through proper FK constraints

### Computed Values (Required)
1. **Use SQL Views**: For derived statistics (counts, durations, aggregates), create SQL views instead of storing in tables
2. **Aggregate on Query**: Use `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `GROUP BY` in SELECT queries rather than maintaining cached counts
3. **Generated Columns**: For simple computed values, consider using SQLite's GENERATED ALWAYS columns
4. **Materialized Views**: Only cache computed values if performance profiling proves it necessary (and document why)

### Data Consistency (Required)
1. **CHECK Constraints**: Use CHECK constraints for enum-like fields (e.g., `CHECK(severity_int BETWEEN 0 AND 4)`)
2. **UNIQUE Constraints**: Enforce uniqueness at database level, not just application level
3. **NOT NULL**: Use NOT NULL for required fields to prevent NULL-related bugs
4. **Triggers for Audit**: Use triggers only for audit logging, not for maintaining derived data

### SQLite-Specific Best Practices
1. **Indexes**: Create indexes on foreign keys and frequently-queried columns (but avoid over-indexing)
2. **Transactions**: Always use transactions for multi-statement operations (use `db_transaction()` context manager)
3. **JSON Columns**: Use JSON columns only for truly variable/unstructured metadata - prefer structured columns when schema is known
4. **Type Affinity**: Be explicit with types (TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, BLOB) and use CHECK constraints to enforce
5. **Query Planning**: Use `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` to optimize slow queries

### Cross-Scan Data Tracking
1. **Shared Entity Tables**: Create dedicated tables for entities that span multiple scans (hosts, plugins, CVEs)
2. **Junction Tables**: Use proper many-to-many junction tables with composite keys
3. **Temporal Tracking**: Add `first_seen` / `last_seen` timestamps to track entity history across scans
4. **Global Queries**: Design schema to enable "all findings for host X across all scans" type queries

### Schema Management
- Database uses normalized structure created on initialization
- Schema version tracked in `database.py:SCHEMA_VERSION` (current: 1)
- Future schema changes will include migration system when needed
- Always test schema changes with fresh database before release

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ **Never** store counts/sums in tables when you can compute them with SQL
❌ **Never** duplicate reference data (severity labels, service names) across records
❌ **Never** use boolean flags for data that can be computed (e.g., `is_ipv4` from `ip_address`)
❌ **Never** use freeform text fields for categorical data (use lookup tables with FKs)
❌ **Never** skip foreign key constraints "for performance" (they're fast and prevent bugs)
❌ **Never** cache data without a clear performance justification (measure first)

### Design Review Checklist
Before implementing any schema change, verify:
- [ ] All relationships have foreign key constraints
- [ ] No redundant/derived data is stored in tables
- [ ] Reference data is normalized into lookup tables
- [ ] Computed values use views or aggregation queries
- [ ] CHECK constraints enforce valid values
- [ ] Indexes exist for foreign keys and query patterns
- [ ] Schema tested with fresh database
- [ ] Breaking change documented in CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Major version bumped if needed

## Project Overview

**Cerno** is a Python CLI tool for reviewing Nessus vulnerability scan findings and orchestrating security tools (nmap, NetExec, Metasploit). It features a Rich-based TUI for interactive review, SQLite-backed persistence, and session state tracking.

**Core workflow**: Import `.nessus` files → Review findings in TUI → Run security tools → Track progress in database

**Target Python**: 3.11+ (3.8+ may work but not the target)

## Python Packaging Best Practices

**CRITICAL**: When adding new Python subpackages to the project, you MUST update `pyproject.toml` to include them in the distribution. Failure to do so will cause missing modules in pipx/pip installations.

### Package Structure

Cerno uses setuptools with the following structure:
- `cerno.py` - Main entry point (top-level module)
- `cerno_pkg/` - Main package directory
  - `migrations/` - Database migration scripts (SUBPACKAGE - must be explicitly included)
  - Other modules...

### pyproject.toml Configuration

**Current configuration** (lines 59-64):
```toml
[tool.setuptools]
packages = ["cerno_pkg", "cerno_pkg.migrations"]
py-modules = ["cerno"]

[tool.setuptools.package-data]
cerno_pkg = ["*.yaml"]
```

### Adding New Subpackages

When adding a new subdirectory with `__init__.py` under `cerno_pkg/`:

1. **Add to packages list**: Update `[tool.setuptools] packages` in pyproject.toml
2. **Test installation**: Install via `pip install -e .` and verify subpackage is accessible
3. **Verify in pipx**: If users install via pipx, check that the subpackage appears in site-packages

**Example**: Adding a new `cerno_pkg/plugins/` subpackage:
```toml
[tool.setuptools]
packages = [
    "cerno_pkg",
    "cerno_pkg.migrations",
    "cerno_pkg.plugins"  # NEW
]
```

### Package Data (Non-Python Files)

For non-Python files (YAML, JSON, etc.) that need to be included:

```toml
[tool.setuptools.package-data]
cerno_pkg = ["*.yaml", "*.json"]  # Files in cerno_pkg/
"cerno_pkg.migrations" = ["*.sql"]  # Files in cerno_pkg/migrations/
```

### Testing Package Distribution

**Before releasing**, always verify the package contents:

```bash
# Build distribution
python -m build

# Check package contents
tar -tzf dist/cerno-*.tar.gz | grep cerno_pkg

# Expected output should include:
# cerno_pkg/
# cerno_pkg/__init__.py
# cerno_pkg/migrations/
# cerno_pkg/migrations/__init__.py
# cerno_pkg/migrations/migration_001_plugin_output.py
# cerno_pkg/migrations/migration_002_remove_filesystem_columns.py
# cerno_pkg/migrations/migration_003_foundation_tables.py
# cerno_pkg/*.yaml
```

**Test installation in isolated environment**:
```bash
# Install in clean venv
python -m venv test_env
source test_env/bin/activate  # or test_env\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install dist/cerno-*.whl

# Verify subpackage exists
python -c "from cerno_pkg.migrations import get_all_migrations; print(get_all_migrations())"
# Should print list of migrations, not ModuleNotFoundError
```

### Common Packaging Mistakes

❌ **DON'T**: Assume setuptools auto-discovers subpackages
```toml
packages = ["cerno_pkg"]  # WRONG: migrations/ won't be included
```

✅ **DO**: Explicitly list all subpackages
```toml
packages = ["cerno_pkg", "cerno_pkg.migrations"]  # CORRECT
```

❌ **DON'T**: Forget to test pipx installations
```bash
# Developer only tests pip install -e .
pip install -e .  # Works because source is available
```

✅ **DO**: Test actual wheel installation
```bash
python -m build
pipx install dist/cerno-*.whl  # Test real installation
```

### Verification Checklist

Before releasing a new version:
- [ ] All subpackages listed in `pyproject.toml` packages
- [ ] All non-Python files listed in package-data (if needed)
- [ ] `python -m build` runs without errors
- [ ] Wheel contains all expected files (check with `unzip -l dist/*.whl`)
- [ ] Test installation in clean venv works
- [ ] Import all subpackages succeeds
- [ ] Migrations directory exists in installed package (if applicable)

## Build & Development Commands

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Install package in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or install from requirements (production dependencies only)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Direct execution (development)
python cerno.py --help

# Installed command (after pip install)
cerno --help

# Common commands
cerno import nessus scan.nessus   # Import Nessus scan
cerno review                      # Start interactive review
cerno scan list                   # List all scans
cerno scan delete <scan_name>     # Delete scan from database
cerno scan compare <s1> <s2>      # Compare findings between two scans
cerno scan history <host_ip>      # Show vulnerability timeline for a host
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest

# Run with verbose coverage report
pytest --cov=cerno_pkg --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_parsing.py

# Run by marker
pytest -m unit                      # Fast unit tests only
pytest -m integration               # Integration tests (DB, filesystem)
pytest -m "not slow"                # Skip slow tests

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_parsing.py::TestSplitHostPort::test_ipv4_with_port

# Show test durations (find slow tests)
pytest --durations=10
```

**Coverage goals**: 85% overall, 90%+ for critical modules (database.py, models.py, parsing.py, nessus_import.py)

### Linting & Formatting

```bash
# Format code with black
black cerno.py cerno_pkg/ tests/

# Type checking with mypy (primary checker)
mypy cerno.py cerno_pkg/ --ignore-missing-imports

# Type checking with pyright (secondary checker)
pyright cerno.py cerno_pkg/

# Generate full type checking report (JSON)
pyright . --outputjson > pylance-report.json

# Check specific file
pyright cerno_pkg/tui.py
```

### Type Checking Philosophy

Cerno uses **dual type checking** for maximum coverage:

- **MyPy**: Primary checker, runs in CI/CD (currently `continue-on-error: true`)
- **Pyright**: Secondary checker, catches edge cases MyPy misses, used locally

**When to use each:**
- Always run both locally before committing
- Fix mypy errors first (will eventually block CI/CD)
- Fix pyright errors to maintain type safety and prevent Pylance issues
- Use tool-specific ignore comments sparingly and document why

**Type annotation standards:**
- All public functions must have parameter and return type hints
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` for forward references
- Use `TYPE_CHECKING` guards for circular imports
- Prefer explicit types over `Any` (use `Any` only when truly dynamic)
- Document complex types with docstring examples

**Configuration files:**
- `pyproject.toml`: Contains `[tool.mypy]` configuration
- `pyrightconfig.json`: Contains pyright configuration (typeCheckingMode: "basic")

**Known type checking issues** (as of v1.1.0):
- Current CI/CD mypy checks set to `continue-on-error: true` (non-blocking)
- Several modules have type errors revealed in `pylance-report.json`
- Type checking will become stricter in future releases as issues are resolved

## Architecture

### Database Architecture

Cerno uses a **fully normalized database architecture** with SQLite as the source of truth:

- **Location**: `~/.cerno/cerno.db` (global, cross-scan)
- **Schema version**: Tracked in `database.py:SCHEMA_VERSION` (current: 1)
- **Schema approach**: Normalized structure created on initialization
- `.txt` files are **reference only** - all data lives in database

**Key design principles**:
- Database is source of truth for review state, host:port data, session state
- File browsing queries database directly (no filesystem walks during review)
- Review state tracked in `findings.review_state` column, synchronized to filename prefixes
- CVEs cached in `plugins.cves` JSON column after fetching from Tenable
- Normalized host/port tables enable cross-scan tracking
- SQL views compute statistics on-demand (no redundant cached data)

```

**Module organization**:
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Context dataclasses eliminate massive parameter lists (`ReviewContext`: 14 fields)
- Clear separation: `tui.py` handles navigation, `fs.py` handles file operations, `render.py` handles display
- Database objects (`Plugin`, `Finding`) flow through entire call chain

### Core Data Flow

1. **Import**: `.nessus` XML → `nessus_import.py` → SQLite (`scans`, `plugins`, `findings`, `finding_affected_hosts`)
2. **Review**: `Finding.get_by_scan_with_plugin()` → `(Finding, Plugin)` tuples → `render.py` tables → User actions → Update `review_state` column
3. **Tools**: TUI menu → Pass `Plugin`/`Finding` objects → `tools.py` → Execute command → `tool_executions` + `artifacts` tables
4. **Session**: Auto-save to `sessions` table (start time, duration, statistics)

**Key principle**: Plugin and Finding database objects flow through entire call chain. No filename parsing for plugin_id extraction - synthetic paths used only for display/directory structure.

### Parsing Architecture

**Canonical parser**: `parsing.py:parse_hosts_ports()` returns `ParsedHostsPorts` model:
- Stable host order (original order preserved)
- Unique, sorted ports
- Explicit `host:port` detection (IPv4, IPv6 with brackets)
- In-process LRU cache for performance

**Usage**: All host:port parsing must use `parse_hosts_ports()` to ensure consistency.

### Tool Registry Pattern

`tool_registry.py` defines `ToolSpec` with `builder: Callable[[dict], tuple[Any, dict]]`:
- Entries for `nmap`, `netexec`, legacy builders
- Decouples tool definitions from execution logic
- Enables adding new tools without modifying core code

### Database Schema

**Foundation Tables**:
- `severity_levels`: Normalized severity reference data (0-4, labels, colors)
- `artifact_types`: Artifact type definitions
- `hosts`: Normalized host data across ALL scans (enables cross-scan tracking)
- `ports`: Port metadata
- `audit_log`: Change tracking (future feature)

**Core Tables**:
- `scans`: Top-level scan metadata (scan_name, export_root, .nessus hash)
- `plugins`: Plugin metadata (plugin_id, severity_int, CVSS, CVEs, Metasploit modules)
  - Note: `severity_label` accessed via `severity_levels` table JOIN
- `findings`: Findings per scan (scan_id + plugin_id, review_state)
  - Note: `host_count`, `port_count` computed via `v_finding_stats` view
- `finding_affected_hosts`: Host:port combinations (finding_id, host_id FK, port_number FK, plugin_output)
  - Uses foreign keys to normalized `hosts` and `ports` tables
- `host_services`: Per-scan service discovery (scan_id, host_id, port_number, protocol, svc_name)
  - Populated from Nessus ReportItem `svc_name`/`protocol` attributes during import
  - Uses foreign keys to `scans`, `hosts`, and `ports` tables
- `sessions`: Review session tracking (start time, end time)
  - Note: Statistics computed via `v_session_stats` view
- `tool_executions`: Command history (tool_name, command_text, exit_code, duration, sudo usage)
- `artifacts`: Generated files (artifact_path, artifact_type_id FK, file_hash, file_size, metadata JSON)
  - Uses `artifact_type_id` foreign key to `artifact_types` table
- `workflow_executions`: Custom workflow tracking

**SQL Views** (Computed Statistics):
- `v_finding_stats`: Host/port counts per finding
- `v_session_stats`: Session duration and statistics
- `v_plugins_with_severity`: Plugins with severity labels
- `v_host_findings`: Cross-scan host analysis
- `v_artifacts_with_types`: Artifacts with type names
- `v_http_services`: HTTP/HTTPS services per scan (identifies web services by svc_name heuristics)

**Schema changes**: Update `database.py:SCHEMA_SQL_TABLES` and `SCHEMA_SQL_VIEWS`. Test with fresh database before release.

### Version Management

Version is defined in `pyproject.toml:project.version` (single source of truth).

`_version.py` resolves version with fallback chain:
1. `importlib.metadata.version("cerno")` (installed package)
2. Parse `pyproject.toml` (development mode)
3. "unknown" (fallback)

**When bumping version**: Update `pyproject.toml` only. Do NOT hardcode version elsewhere.

#### Incremental Changelog Updates

**MANDATORY**: All code changes that affect functionality, behavior, or user experience MUST be documented in the `[Unreleased]` section of CHANGELOG.md immediately after implementation.

**When to update [Unreleased] (Required):**
- ✅ After implementing any feature (Added section)
- ✅ After fixing any bug (Fixed section)
- ✅ After modifying existing behavior (Changed section)
- ✅ After deprecating functionality (Deprecated section)
- ✅ After removing features (Removed section)
- ✅ After addressing security issues (Security section)

**When to skip [Unreleased] updates (Exceptions):**
- Internal refactoring with no user-visible changes
- Pure documentation updates (README, comments only)
- Test-only changes with no production code impact
- Development tooling changes (CI/CD, scripts)

**Process (Automatic):**
1. After making code changes with Edit/Write tools, IMMEDIATELY update CHANGELOG.md
2. Locate the `[Unreleased]` section (line 8)
3. Add bullet points under appropriate subsections (Added/Changed/Fixed/etc.)
4. Follow existing format and style from recent releases (v1.1.0 as reference)
5. Include file references where helpful (e.g., `render.py:render_actions_footer()`)
6. Preserve any existing [Unreleased] content (append, don't replace)

**Format Guidelines:**
- Start bullets with action verbs (Added, Fixed, Improved, Resolved, Updated)
- Be specific about what changed and why (not just "updated code")
- Include file/function references for complex changes
- Use sub-bullets for multi-part changes
- Group related changes together

**Example [Unreleased] entry:**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Resolved import optimization bug in render.py affecting color output
- Fixed host parsing edge case in nessus_import.py for malformed IPv6 addresses

### Changed
- Improved terminal width detection fallback logic (ansi.py:get_terminal_width())
- Updated error messages for invalid plugin IDs to include suggestions
```

**Enforcement:**
- This is NOT optional - Claude will proactively update [Unreleased] after code changes
- If you make changes without updating [Unreleased], that is a bug in Claude's behavior
- You should never need to ask "did you update the changelog?" - it happens automatically

#### Version Increment SOP

**CRITICAL**: Whenever the user requests a version increment, you MUST follow this comprehensive process with mandatory user confirmation.

**Phase 1: Gather All Changes**
1. **Read current version** from `pyproject.toml` line 7 (`version = "X.Y.Z"`)
   - This is the last version that was documented
   - Git tags are only created on release (main branch merge), not on every version bump

2. **Read [Unreleased] section** in CHANGELOG.md (line 8)
   - Extract all documented changes
   - Note which subsections have content (Added/Changed/Fixed/etc.)

3. **Review git commit history** since last version in CHANGELOG.md:
   ```bash
   # Find the last version section in CHANGELOG.md (e.g., ## [1.1.1])
   # Then get commits since that version was documented
   git log --oneline --since="<date from last changelog entry>" HEAD
   ```
   - Identify commits that might not be documented in [Unreleased]
   - Look for conventional commit prefixes (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:)

4. **Check for uncommitted changes** in git status
   - Review modified files that might not be documented yet
   - Cross-reference with [Unreleased] section

5. **Compile comprehensive change list**
   - Combine [Unreleased] content + undocumented git commits + unstaged changes
   - Organize into Keep a Changelog categories

**Phase 2: Present Changes for Approval (MANDATORY)**
Present the gathered changes to the user in this format:

```
I found the following changes since version [LAST_VERSION]:

### Added
- [List all items from [Unreleased] Added section]
- [Any undocumented features from git history]

### Changed
- [List all items from [Unreleased] Changed section]
- [Any undocumented behavior changes from git history]

### Fixed
- [List all items from [Unreleased] Fixed section]
- [Any undocumented bug fixes from git history]

[Include other sections as applicable: Deprecated, Removed, Security]

### Undocumented Changes
[If any commits found without corresponding [Unreleased] entries, list them here]
- Commit abc123: feat: add new feature (NOT DOCUMENTED)
- Commit def456: fix: resolve edge case (NOT DOCUMENTED)

---

Questions before proceeding:
1. Are all changes listed above accurate and complete?
2. Should any undocumented commits be added to the changelog?
3. Are there any additional changes to document?
4. What version number should this be? (Current: X.Y.Z)
```

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to Phase 3.**

**Phase 3: Update Both Files Atomically (After Approval)**
Only after user confirms the changelog content:

1. **Update `pyproject.toml`**: Change `project.version` to the approved version number

2. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`**:
   - Create new version section: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` (use current date)
   - Move all approved content from [Unreleased] to the new version section
   - Add any additional items the user requested
   - Organize sections in standard order: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
   - Ensure proper formatting (bullets, sub-bullets, indentation)
   - Reset [Unreleased] section to empty (keep header `## [Unreleased]`, remove all content below it)

3. **Verify final state**:
   - New version section exists with format `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   - [Unreleased] section is empty and ready for next development cycle
   - Both files updated in same operation

**Phase 4: Validation**
- Confirm both files updated atomically
- Verify changelog entry matches required format for release workflow
- Check that all user-requested changes are included
- Ensure [Unreleased] section reset correctly

**This is mandatory** - never increment the version without:
1. Gathering changes from ALL sources ([Unreleased], git history, user input)
2. Presenting changes to user for confirmation
3. Waiting for explicit approval before updating files
4. Documenting ALL changes in the final changelog entry

**Important Notes:**
- Git tags are created automatically by the release workflow when changes are merged to `main` branch
- Not every version bump in `pyproject.toml` gets a git tag immediately
- Always check `pyproject.toml` for current version, not git tags
- The automated release workflow will fail if CHANGELOG.md is missing the version entry or has incorrect format

**Example transformation:**

User requests: "Bump version to 1.1.1"

Claude presents:
```
I found the following changes since version 1.1.0:

### Fixed
- Resolved race condition in session persistence (session.py)
- Fixed terminal width detection on Windows (ansi.py)

### Changed
- Improved error messages for invalid plugin IDs

### Undocumented Changes
- Commit a1b2c3d: fix: handle empty host list in parsing.py (NOT DOCUMENTED)

Questions:
1. Should I add the undocumented parsing fix to the changelog?
2. Any other changes to include?
3. Confirm version 1.1.1?
```

User confirms: "Yes, add the parsing fix, version 1.1.1 is correct"

Claude updates CHANGELOG.md:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

#### Automated Release Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

The release workflow is **automatically triggered** when `pyproject.toml` is modified on the `main` branch (via PR merge or direct commit).

**Workflow steps**:
1. **Version detection**: Compares current `pyproject.toml` version with previous commit
2. **Validation**: Ensures version follows semver format (X.Y.Z)
3. **Changelog extraction**: Parses `CHANGELOG.md` using `scripts/extract_changelog.py`
4. **Build**: Creates wheel and source distribution (`python -m build`)
5. **Tag creation**: Creates annotated git tag (e.g., `v1.0.1`) as `github-actions[bot]`
6. **Release creation**: Creates GitHub Release with extracted changelog and distribution artifacts
7. **Mark as latest**: Release is automatically marked as latest

**Key features**:
- Works for both PR merges and direct commits to main
- Idempotent (re-running doesn't duplicate releases)
- Skips release if version unchanged (prevents false triggers)
- Attaches built wheel/sdist to release for distribution

**Creating a new release**:
1. Update version in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., `1.0.1` → `1.0.2`)
2. Add release entry to `CHANGELOG.md` with format: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Commit changes and push/merge to `main`
4. Workflow automatically creates tag and GitHub Release

**Changelog format**: Must follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format:
```markdown
## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- New feature description

### Fixed
- Bug fix description
```

**Helper script**: `scripts/extract_changelog.py` extracts version-specific sections from `CHANGELOG.md`

**Testing locally**:
```bash
# Test changelog extraction
python scripts/extract_changelog.py 1.0.1

# Verify version parsing
python -c "import tomllib; print(tomllib.load(open('pyproject.toml', 'rb'))['project']['version'])"
```

### Constants & Configuration

**Configuration** (`~/.cerno/config.yaml`): All user preferences managed via config file. Auto-created with defaults on first run. All configuration values are set through this file only.

**CLI commands**:
- `cerno config show` - Display all configuration settings with current values
- `cerno config set <key> <value>` - Change a configuration value
- `cerno config get <key>` - Get current value of a setting
- `cerno config reset` - Reset configuration to defaults (creates backup)

**Note**: Environment variables are not used for configuration. Use `config.yaml` for all settings including:
- `results_root` - Artifact storage path (default: `~/.cerno/artifacts`)
- `log_path` - Log file location (default: `~/.cerno/cerno.log`)
- `debug_logging` - Enable DEBUG level logging (default: `false`)
- `no_color` - Disable ANSI color output (default: `false`)
- `default_tool` - Pre-select tool in menu (e.g., `nmap`, `netexec`)
- `default_netexec_protocol` - Default protocol for NetExec (e.g., `smb`, `ssh`)
- `nmap_default_profile` - Default NSE profile name
- `custom_workflows_path` - Path to custom workflows YAML file

**NSE profiles** (`constants.py:NSE_PROFILES`): Pre-configured nmap script sets (SMB, SSL, HTTP, etc.)

### Workflow Mappings

`workflow_mappings.yaml`: Maps plugin IDs → verification workflows (YAML format).

**CLI options**:
- `--custom-workflows PATH`: Supplement bundled workflows (custom overrides on conflict)
- `--custom-workflows-only PATH`: Replace bundled workflows entirely

**Workflow features**:
- Multi-plugin workflows (comma-separated plugin IDs)
- Display-only (commands, notes, references)
- Press `[W]` in TUI to view workflow for current plugin

### Logging

**Backend**: Prefers loguru with rotation (1 MB, 7 days retention), falls back to stdlib logging.

**Decorators**: `@log_timing` logs execution duration at DEBUG level.

**Global exception hook**: Logs unhandled exceptions (Rich still shows pretty tracebacks).

**Shims**: `_log_info()`, `_log_debug()`, `_log_error()` keep code backend-agnostic.

## Development Patterns

### Data vs Render Separation

**Pattern**: Compute pure data first, then render with Rich.

**Example**: `analysis.py:build_compare_data()` returns data dict → `render_compare_table()` creates Rich table.

**Why**: Enables testing business logic without Rich rendering, keeps functions focused.

### Severity Handling

**Centralized helpers**:
- `_severity_color_name(severity_int: int) -> str`: Returns Rich color name
- `colorize_severity_label(label: str, severity_int: int) -> str`: ANSI-colored label
- `severity_style(severity_int: int) -> Style`: Rich Style object
- `pretty_severity_label(severity_int: int) -> str`: Formatted Rich text

**Mapping**: `0=Info, 1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High, 4=Critical`

### Review State Management

**States**: `pending`, `reviewed`, `completed`, `skipped`

**Database-first**: Update `findings.review_state` column → Sync to filename prefix (`[R]`, `[X]`, `[S]`).

**Reversible**: Press `[U]` to undo review-complete (multi-select support).

### Session Persistence

**Auto-save**: Review progress saved to `sessions` table (no `.cerno_session.json` files in DB-only mode).

**Resume prompt**: On startup, shows session details (reviewed/completed/skipped counts, session start time).

**Cleanup**: Auto-delete session after successful completion.

### Terminal Responsiveness

**Terminal width detection**: `ansi.py:get_terminal_width()` detects current terminal width with graceful fallback to 80 chars.

**Responsive layouts**: UI adapts to terminal width for optimal display:
- **Action footer** (`render.py:render_actions_footer()`):
  - Wide terminal (≥100 chars): 2-column grid layout
  - Narrow terminal (<100 chars): Single-column layout to prevent wrapping
- **Status line** (`cerno.py:browse_file_list()`):
  - Wide terminal (≥120 chars): Single line with separators
  - Medium terminal (80-119 chars): Two-line layout
  - Narrow terminal (<80 chars): Multi-line layout (one item per line)

**Group filter descriptions**: Enhanced `group_filter` tuple from `(index, plugin_ids)` to `(index, plugin_ids, description)` to provide context in status line (e.g., "Group #1: Identical host:port combinations").

**Page size configuration**: Users can override auto-detected page size via `config.yaml`:
```yaml
default_page_size: 20  # Fixed page size (overrides auto-detection)
```
Set to `null` or omit for automatic detection from terminal height. Falls back to 12 if detection fails (logs debug hint).

**UI Improvements**:
- **Streamlined file view**: Default to grouped format, offer post-view menu for Copy/Change format/Back (reduces 4 steps to 1-2)
- **Smart CVE format**: Auto-selects combined format for 1-2 findings, separated for 3+ (shows preview before asking)
- **MSF indicator**: Metasploit module indicator moved to panel subtitle for cleaner visual hierarchy
- **Completed findings clarity**: Renamed from "Reviewed findings (read-only)" to "Completed Findings (Undo Available)" with updated help text
- **Comparison groups pager**: Large group details (>8 findings) accessible via [D] option to view full list in pager

## Testing Practices

### Fixture Usage

**Database**: Use `temp_db` fixture (in-memory SQLite, schema initialized) for integration tests.

**Filesystem**: Use `temp_dir`, `sample_scan_dir`, `sample_plugin_file` fixtures (auto-cleanup).

**Nessus data**: Use `minimal_nessus_fixture` (3 plugins, 3 hosts) for fast tests, `goad_nessus_fixture` (74 plugins, 755 hosts) for slow tests.

### Test Markers

- `@pytest.mark.unit`: Fast, isolated (< 0.1s each)
- `@pytest.mark.integration`: DB or filesystem (< 1s each)
- `@pytest.mark.slow`: Large file processing (mark as slow)

### Parametrized Tests

Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for testing multiple input variations:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_str,expected_host,expected_port", [
    ("192.168.1.1:80", "192.168.1.1", 80),
    ("[::1]:8080", "::1", 8080),
])
def test_split_host_port(input_str, expected_host, expected_port):
    host, port = split_host_port(input_str)
    assert host == expected_host
    assert port == expected_port
```

### Coverage Practices

- Run `pytest --cov-report=html` to identify untested branches
- Exclude boilerplate with `# pragma: no cover` sparingly
- Focus coverage on critical paths (DB ops, parsing, import)

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Command

1. Add Typer command in `cerno.py` (use `@app.command()` decorator)
2. Import required functions from `cerno_pkg`
3. Add docstring for `--help` output
4. Test manually: `python cerno.py <command> --help`

### Adding a New Database Column

**Note**: Database schema changes currently require bumping the major version and having users re-import scans. A proper migration system will be implemented in a future release.

1. Update `database.py:SCHEMA_SQL_TABLES` with new column
2. Update `schema.sql` (documentation reference)
3. Update `models.py` dataclass if applicable
4. Test with fresh database: `pytest tests/test_database.py`
5. Document breaking change in CHANGELOG.md
6. Bump major version in `pyproject.toml`

### Database Schema Management

**Current approach**: The database is created directly in its final normalized structure. There is no migration system currently implemented.

**Key points**:
- `initialize_database()` creates all tables in final structure on first run
- Uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency
- Foundation tables (severity_levels, artifact_types) populated automatically
- SQL views created automatically for computed statistics

**Schema changes**: Currently require major version bump and users re-importing scans. A proper migration system will be implemented in a future release from a clean slate.

**Testing the schema**:
```bash
# Delete existing database
rm ~/.cerno/cerno.db

# Run cerno (creates fresh database)
cerno scan list

# Verify schema
sqlite3 ~/.cerno/cerno.db ".schema"

# Check foundation tables populated
sqlite3 ~/.cerno/cerno.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM severity_levels;"  # Expected: 5
sqlite3 ~/.cerno/cerno.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artifact_types;"   # Expected: 5
```

### Adding a New Tool

1. Add tool spec to `tool_registry.py:TOOL_REGISTRY`
2. Implement builder function: `def build_<tool>_cmd(ctx: dict) -> tuple[Any, dict]`
3. Add tool-specific constants to `constants.py` if needed
4. Update `tools.py` to handle tool-specific prompts
5. Test in TUI: `cerno review` → Run tool → Verify command generation

### Updating Workflow Mappings

1. Edit `cerno_pkg/workflow_mappings.yaml` (or create custom YAML)
2. Follow schema: `version`, `workflows` list, each with `plugin_id`, `workflow_name`, `description`, `steps`, `references`
3. Test in TUI: `cerno review --custom-workflows <path>` → Press `[W]` on matching plugin

### Debugging Database Issues

```bash
# Enable DEBUG logging via config
cerno config set debug_logging true
cerno review
tail -f ~/.cerno/cerno.log

# Inspect database directly
sqlite3 ~/.cerno/cerno.db
sqlite> .schema
sqlite> SELECT * FROM scans;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM v_review_progress;
```

## Important Notes

- **Database migrations**: ALWAYS test migrations with existing database before release
- **Version bumps**: Update `pyproject.toml` version, create git tag, push tag for release workflow
- **Breaking changes**: Document in README "Database-Only Architecture" section if schema changes
- **Backward compatibility**: `.txt` files still created for human reference, but database is source of truth
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions runs tests on Python 3.11/3.12, Ubuntu/Windows/macOS (see `.github/workflows/test.yml`)
- **Dependencies**: Keep `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml:dependencies` in sync
- **Nessus XML parsing**: Based on DefensiveOrigins/NessusPluginHosts (respect attribution)
