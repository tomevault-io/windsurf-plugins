# CLAUDE.md — Open CoDesign

Instructions for Claude Code (and any AI coding agent) working in this repository. Read this before making changes.

## What this project is

open-codesign is an Electron desktop app that turns natural-language prompts into design artifacts (HTML prototypes, PDFs, PPTX decks, marketing assets). It's the open-source counterpart to Anthropic's Claude Design, with multi-provider model support via `pi-ai` and a local-first storage model.

The full vision and locked decisions live in `docs/VISION.md`. Read it before suggesting architectural changes.

> Note: `docs/` is gitignored — internal team materials (research, roadmaps, handoffs) live there but are not part of the public repo. Clone contributors will not have this directory; team members will find it present locally after cloning and copying the internal docs back.

## Hard constraints (do not violate)

These are project-level commitments, not preferences:

1. **Install size budget: ≤ 80 MB.** Adding a dependency that pushes us over requires PR justification with size diff and alternatives considered. CI enforces this.
2. **No bundled model runtimes.** No Ollama, llama.cpp, Python, or browser binaries shipped in the installer. Use system installs or lazy-download on demand.
3. **BYOK only.** No proxied API calls, no cloud account, no telemetry by default. User credentials stay in `~/.config/open-codesign/config.toml` (encrypted via Electron `safeStorage`).
4. **Local-first storage.** Designs, history, and codebase scans live on disk (SQLite via `better-sqlite3`). No mandatory cloud sync.
5. **MIT-compatible permissive licenses only.** Reject GPL/AGPL/SSPL/proprietary deps. Check license before adding anything.
6. **Lazy-load heavy features.** PPTX export, web capture, codebase scan, etc. must dynamic-import on first use, not on app start.
7. **Compatibility, upgradeability, no bloat, elegance** — the four PRINCIPLES §5b checks. Every PR description must mark all four green.

## Stack & conventions

- **Package manager**: `pnpm` only. Never use `npm` or `yarn`. Workspace declared in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- **Build orchestration**: Turborepo.
- **Lint + format**: Biome (single tool, no ESLint + Prettier).
- **Tests**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E). New features require at least one Vitest test.
- **TypeScript**: `strict: true`, `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`, `moduleResolution: "bundler"`. No `any`.
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits, enforced by commitlint.
- **Versioning**: Changesets. Don't hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Node**: 22 LTS (pinned via `.nvmrc` + `engines`).
- **Model layer**: All LLM calls go through `@mariozechner/pi-ai`. Don't import provider SDKs directly in app code; if pi-ai lacks a feature, add it to `packages/providers` as a thin extension.

### Frontend stack (locked)

- **UI framework**: React 19 + Vite 6
- **Styles**: Tailwind v4 + CSS variables (tokens in `packages/ui`)
- **State**: Zustand (do not introduce Redux / Recoil / MobX)
- **Routing**: native `useState` view switching at first; TanStack Router only when route count > 5
- **Components**: Radix UI primitives + custom shadcn-style wrappers in `packages/ui`
- **Icons**: `lucide-react` (only)
- **Forms**: native `<form>` + `FormData` (do not introduce react-hook-form / formik)
- **Animations**: Tailwind transitions (do not introduce framer-motion / motion)
- **Sandbox renderer**: Electron iframe `srcdoc` + esbuild-wasm + import maps (see `docs/research/03-sandbox-runtime.md`)
- **Electron version**: latest stable, but NOT 41.x (cross-origin isolation regression)
- **Storage**: better-sqlite3 for design history; TOML files for config (no electron-store blob)

  exporters/         # PDF / PPTX / ZIP exporters (lazy-loaded)
  templates/         # Built-in demo prompts and starter templates
  shared/            # Types, utils, zod schemas
docs/                # Vision, roadmap, principles, RFCs (gitignored — internal only)

```

## Doing tasks here

- **Always read `docs/VISION.md` and `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` first** for any non-trivial change. The constraints are not negotiable.
- **Use the planning-with-files workflow** for any task spanning > 5 tool calls or > 3 files. Plans live in `.claude/workspace/`.
- **Use git worktrees for parallel work.** See `docs/COLLABORATION.md` for the workflow. Never run two unrelated feature branches in the same checkout.
- **Check `docs/RESEARCH_QUEUE.md`** before starting work that touches sandbox / inline-comment / slider / PPTX / pi-ai capabilities — research may still be pending and decisions unresolved.
- **Respect the lean budget.** Before adding a dependency: search for a tiny alternative, consider inlining, ask if it can be a peer dep.
