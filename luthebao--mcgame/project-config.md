# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

This file is the single source of truth for AI coding assistants in this repo (Claude Code, Codex / `AGENTS.md`, GitHub Copilot / `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are all symlinks to it).

**Project**: Go 1.23 game server for a Flash MMO client using RTMPE (encrypted RTMP) with AMF0 serialization.

## Hard Rules

- **Languages**: Go only for backend/tools/scripts; TypeScript + pnpm only for frontend. No other languages or frameworks.
- **Never**: edit `.as` (ActionScript) files (decompiled Flash client). Never run `git commit` / `git push`, use worktrees unless the user asks.
- **Binaries**: `go build -o bin/<name> ./<pkg>` only. Never `go build ./...` or `./cmd/...` without `-o bin/...`. `bin/` is the only sanctioned output path.
- **`.go` files**: no inline comments — file-level notes at the top only. Split files >300–400 lines.
- **DB**: all database and migration work goes through the compose stack only: the project Supabase MCP (`.mcp.json` → `http://127.0.0.1:54323/api/mcp`) or the Supabase CLI with `--db-url "$DB_URL"` built from `docker/.env`. Never use the claude.ai cloud Supabase connector (`mcp__claude_ai_Supabase__*`) or any other database. `auth_database` and `database` may point to the same Supabase Postgres.
- Read the reference files (below) before starting.

## Code Layout

- `internal/application/<feature>/` — feature services (e.g. `battle/`, `quest/`).
- `internal/presentation/rtmp/handlers/<feature>/` — RPC handlers grouped by domain (e.g. `item/`, `combat/`).
- Shared RTMP helpers in `internal/presentation/rtmp/utils/`. Feature-specific helpers stay in the feature package.
- Layers depend inward: `presentation` → `application` → `domain` ← `infrastructure` (postgres/redis/rtmp/grpc). Wiring lives in `cmd/gameserver/main.go`; `pkg/rtmp` (forked go-rtmp with RTMPE) and `pkg/amf0` are vendored forks, not upstream.
- Request flow: Flash client → RTMPE → `pkg/rtmp` → `internal/infrastructure/rtmp/dispatcher.go` → handler → service → repository → Postgres. Deployable as one monolith or split into `main` (auth + registry) and `line` (gameplay) over gRPC.
- Skills and subagents live in `.agents/skills/` and `.agents/agents/`; `.claude/skills` and `.claude/agents` are directory symlinks to them. Add new ones under `.agents/` only.
- Postgres schemas: `public` (auth), `player` (runtime state), `data` (static templates).
- Other `cmd/` tools (`seedgen`, `seedsync`, `exportgamedata`, `dataimport`, `codegen`) are seed/data pipelines; build them with `-o bin/<name>` like everything else.

## Flash Client Reference

- The decompiled client is in `docs/client/` (read-only; `config/Language.as`, `system/CallBack.as`, `system/CallBackGlobal.as` are the entry points).
- RPC method names, arg order and callback payload keys must match the client exactly (typos included, e.g. `chooseCharactor`). AMF0 numbers arrive as `float64`; `iconCode` / `resCode` / `imgCode` / `portraitCode` / `colorCode` must be `int64`.
- Client tracing goes through the `flash-client-researcher` agent; end-to-end features go through the `feature-pipeline` skill.

## Database & Migrations

- **Access**: only two sanctioned paths, both against the docker compose database. (1) Project Supabase MCP (`mcp__supabase__*`, Studio port `STUDIO_LOCAL_PORT=54323`). (2) Supabase CLI with `DB_URL="postgresql://postgres:$(grep ^POSTGRES_PASSWORD= docker/.env | cut -d= -f2-)@127.0.0.1:${POSTGRES_DIRECT_PORT:-54322}/postgres"` — password and ports come from `docker/.env` (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DIRECT_PORT`, `STUDIO_LOCAL_PORT`); never hard-code or print them. If the stack is down, `make game up` first.
- Schema changes: apply to the compose database, then capture with `supabase db diff --db-url "$DB_URL" -f <migration_name>`. Never hand-write migrations, never use MCP migration tools, never put `insert` statements in migrations.
- Seeds: export with `pg_dump` or `supabase db dump` to `supabase/seeds/`, one table per file.
- **Long SQL (SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE) goes through schema-qualified Postgres functions, not inline strings in Go.** Call from Go as `select schema.fn(...)` or `select * from schema.fn(...)`. One-line lookups on a single indexed column are the only exception.
- Function workflow:
  1. Draft the functions in a `.sql` file. Defaults: `language sql` (use `plpgsql` only when you need branching or `EXECUTE`), `security invoker`, `set search_path to ''`, schema-qualify every relation as `"schema"."table"` in the body.
  2. Apply to the compose database. For multi-function files, use `docker exec -i supabase-db psql -U postgres -d postgres < file.sql` — `supabase db query -f` only runs a single statement and rejects multi-statement files.
  3. Smoke-test against real data, then capture with `supabase db diff --db-url "$DB_URL" -f <name>` so the migration lands in `supabase/migrations/`.
- Reusable function patterns:
  - `returns setof <schema>.<table>` for `Get`/`List` — reuses the existing Go `Scan` signature, and `QueryRow` surfaces "no row" as `pgx.ErrNoRows` for free.
