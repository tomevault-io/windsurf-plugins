# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Lucky Lillia Desktop (幸运莉莉娅桌面端) is a cross-platform desktop control panel for LLBot (QQ robot framework). Built with Avalonia UI + ReactiveUI on .NET 8.0, it manages the lifecycle of PMHQ (QQ protocol handler), LLBot, and various bot frameworks (Koishi, AstrBot, Zhenxun, etc.).

The codebase is primarily in Chinese (comments, UI strings, log messages).

## Build & Run Commands

```bash
# Restore and build
dotnet restore
dotnet build

# Run in development
dotnet run

# Publish for Windows (single-file self-contained exe)
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64

# Publish for macOS
./build-macos-app.sh arm64

# Run tests (test project is standalone, not referenced by main .sln)
dotnet test LuckyLilliaDesktop.Tests/LuckyLilliaDesktop.Tests.csproj

# Run a single test
dotnet test LuckyLilliaDesktop.Tests/LuckyLilliaDesktop.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TestMethodName"
```

## Architecture

### MVVM with Reactive Extensions

- **ViewModels** extend `ViewModelBase` (which extends ReactiveUI's `ReactiveObject`). Properties use `[Reactive]` attribute (via ReactiveUI.Fody, configured in `FodyWeavers.xml`) or `RaiseAndSetIfChanged`. Commands use `ReactiveCommand`.
- **Views** are Avalonia AXAML files. Pages live under `Views/Pages/`, dialogs under `Views/Dialogs/`.
- **Services** are interface-based, all registered as **singletons** in DI. ViewModels are **transient**.

### Dependency Injection

Configured in `App.axaml.cs:ConfigureServices()` using `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`. The `IServiceProvider` is stored as `App.Services` and accessed by ViewModels to resolve dependencies.

### Navigation

Tab-based navigation via `MainWindowViewModel.SelectedIndex` (Home → Log → Config → LLBotConfig → IntegrationWizard → About). ViewModels receive navigation callbacks as `Action` delegates (e.g., `HomeViewModel.NavigateToLogs` sets `SelectedIndex = 1`). Dialogs are injected into ViewModels as `Func<T>` delegates for loose coupling.

### Key Service Responsibilities

| Service | Role |
|---------|------|
| `ProcessManager` | Start/stop/monitor PMHQ and LLBot processes. Uses Windows Job Objects for subprocess cleanup. |
| `ResourceMonitor` | Real-time CPU/memory monitoring via `IObservable<T>` streams. |
| `PmhqClient` | HTTP client to local PMHQ API (QR login, account info, device info, SSE events). |
| `ConfigManager` | JSON config I/O (`app_settings.json`) with caching and raw JSON node preservation. |
| `*InstallService` (7 services) | Each handles installation of a specific bot framework (Koishi, AstrBot, Zhenxun, DDBot, Yunzai, ZeroBotPlugin, OpenClaw). |
| `PythonHelper` | Python/uv runtime management for Python-based bot frameworks. |
| `DownloadService` | File downloads with progress tracking and multi-mirror npm registry support (mirrors rotate on failure). |
| `SelfInfoService` | Polls PMHQ for QQ account info; provides separate `UinStream` and `NicknameStream` observables. |

### Process Management Rules

- **PMHQ is a launcher** — it starts the QQ process and then exits. Always check QQ process status (not PMHQ) for login state: use `_processManager.GetProcessStatus("QQ")`, not `GetProcessStatus("PMHQ")`.
- **SelfInfo timing** — UIN arrives before Nickname. `ISelfInfoService` exposes them as separate observable streams (`UinStream`, `NicknameStream`). Never gate logic on both being available simultaneously.
- **Windows cleanup** — Windows Job Objects ensure the entire process tree is terminated. On macOS/Linux, relies on parent-child signal propagation.

### Platform-Specific Behavior

Cross-platform logic uses `PlatformHelper` (in `Utils/`). Key differences:
- **Windows**: Software rendering forced (`Win32RenderingMode.Software`), Windows Job Objects for process tree cleanup, Task Scheduler for startup, `System.Management` for WMI queries.
- **macOS**: `.app` bundle handling in `Program.cs`, App Translocation detection/recovery, `~/Library/Application Support/LuckyLilliaDesktop` as working directory when installed to `/Applications`.
- Working directory is set in `Program.cs` before the Avalonia app starts — this is critical because all relative paths (config, logs, binaries) depend on it.

### UI Theme Rules

All UI must support both light and dark themes. **Never hardcode colors** — use `DynamicResource` bindings:

| Purpose | Resource Key |
|---------|-------------|
| Primary background | `SystemControlBackgroundAltHighBrush` |
| Secondary background | `SystemControlBackgroundBaseLowBrush` |
| Card background | `CardBackground` |
| Primary text | `SystemControlForegroundBaseHighBrush` or `TextPrimary` |
| Secondary text | `SystemControlForegroundBaseMediumBrush` or `TextSecondary` |
| Border | `SystemControlForegroundBaseLowBrush` or `BorderColor` |
| Accent/primary button | `PrimaryBrush` |
| Danger action | `DangerColor` |

Exceptions: brand colors (e.g. `#6C7BFF`), QR code background (must be white), and other functionally-fixed colors are acceptable with justification. Always verify contrast in both themes.
