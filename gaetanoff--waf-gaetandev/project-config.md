# SQL & Database

## Schema Design

- Use singular table names (`user`, not `users`) or be consistent — pick one convention.
- Primary keys: prefer `id` with UUID or auto-increment.
- Use `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps on every table.
- Add `NOT NULL` constraints by default. Allow `NULL` only with explicit reason.
- Use foreign keys for referential integrity. Name them: `fk_<table>_<referenced_table>`.

## Naming

- Tables and columns: `snake_case`.
- Indexes: `idx_<table>_<columns>`.
- Constraints: `chk_<table>_<description>`, `uq_<table>_<columns>`.
- Avoid reserved words as column names.

## Queries

- Always use parameterized queries — never string concatenation.
- Select only the columns you need — avoid `SELECT *` in application code.
- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand and optimize query plans.
- Add indexes for columns used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`.
- Paginate results with `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` or cursor-based pagination.

## Migrations

- Use a migration tool (Prisma Migrate, Flyway, Alembic, Knex).
- Each migration is a single, atomic schema change.
- Migrations must be reversible — always write `up` and `down`.
- Never modify a migration that has been applied to production.
- Test migrations against a copy of production data before deploying.

## ORM Best Practices

- Be aware of N+1 queries — use eager loading / `include` / `join`.
- Use transactions for operations that must be atomic.
- Use raw queries for complex reporting — ORMs aren't always the best tool.
- Monitor query performance with slow query logs.
