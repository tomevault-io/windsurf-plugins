# Git Conventions

## Commit Messages

Follow **Conventional Commits** format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body — explain WHY, not WHAT]

[optional footer — BREAKING CHANGE, closes #issue]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `style`, `build`, `spec`.

- `spec`: changes to specifications (OpenAPI, JSON Schema, Gherkin, contracts).
- Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 72 chars.
- Body: wrap at 80 chars, explain motivation and context.
- One logical change per commit. Don't mix refactoring with features.
- Spec changes and implementation changes should be in **separate commits**.

## Branches

- `main` / `master`: production-ready code. Never commit directly.
- `develop`: integration branch (if using Git Flow).
- Feature: `feat/<ticket-id>-short-description`
- Bugfix: `fix/<ticket-id>-short-description`
- Hotfix: `hotfix/<ticket-id>-short-description`
- Specification: `spec/<ticket-id>-short-description`

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs small and focused — under 400 lines of diff when possible.
- Write a clear description: what changed, why, how to test.
- For spec PRs: describe the contracts added/changed and their impact.
- For implementation PRs: reference the spec the code conforms to.
- Link related issues/tickets.
- Ensure CI passes (including spec lint and conformance tests) before requesting review.
- Squash or rebase before merging to keep history clean.

## Hygiene

- Pull and rebase frequently to avoid large merge conflicts.
- Delete branches after merging.
- Never commit secrets, `.env`, or build artifacts.
- Use `.gitignore` appropriate for the tech stack.
- Commit specs alongside code — they live in the same repo.
