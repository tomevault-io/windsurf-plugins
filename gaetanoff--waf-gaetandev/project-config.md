# Technology Selection

## Decision Criteria

Evaluate every technology choice against:

1. **Fitness**: Does it solve the actual problem well?
2. **Maturity**: Is it production-proven with a stable API?
3. **Ecosystem**: Are there good libraries, tools, and integrations?
4. **Community**: Active maintenance, documentation, Stack Overflow presence?
5. **Team expertise**: Can the team be productive quickly?
6. **Scalability**: Will it handle the expected growth?
7. **Cost**: Licensing, infrastructure, and operational costs.

## Stack Recommendations by Project Type

### SaaS Web App

| Layer | Recommended | Alternatives |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js + React + TypeScript | Nuxt + Vue, SvelteKit |

| **Backend** | Node.js (Fastify/Express) or Next.js API routes | Python (FastAPI), Go (Gin/Fiber) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + Prisma | MySQL, MongoDB |
| **Auth** | NextAuth.js / Lucia / Clerk | Auth0, Supabase Auth |
| **Cache** | Redis | Memcached |
| **Hosting** | Vercel / AWS / GCP | Railway, Fly.io |

### API / Backend Service

| Layer | Recommended | Alternatives |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Runtime** | Node.js + TypeScript | Python, Go, Rust, Java, C# |
| **Framework** | Fastify / Hono | Express, FastAPI, Gin, Actix |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB |
| **ORM** | Prisma / Drizzle | SQLAlchemy, GORM, Diesel |
| **Validation** | Zod | Joi, class-validator, Pydantic |
| **Testing** | Vitest | Jest, pytest, go test |

| **Language** | Go / Rust | Python, Node.js |
| **CLI Framework** | Cobra (Go), Clap (Rust) | Click (Python), Commander (Node) |
| **Distribution** | Single binary (Go/Rust) | pip/npm package |

## Dependency Selection Criteria

Before adding any dependency:

- [ ] Is it actively maintained (commits in last 6 months)?
- [ ] Does it have adequate documentation?
- [ ] How many open issues and PRs? Are they addressed?
- [ ] Are there known security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] What's the bundle size impact (for frontend)?
- [ ] Can you implement it yourself in reasonable time? (if yes, consider it)
- [ ] Is it the most popular/standard solution for this problem?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Resume-Driven Development**: choosing tech to learn, not to ship.
- **Hype-Driven Development**: choosing the newest/trendiest tool without evaluating fit.
- **Over-engineering**: microservices for a todo app, Kubernetes for a blog.
- **Lock-in Blindness**: deep coupling to a vendor without abstraction layer.
- **Dependency Bloat**: npm-installing a package for a 5-line utility function.

## Version Pinning

- Always pin exact versions for production dependencies.
- Use lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `uv.lock`, `go.sum`) and commit them.
- Update dependencies regularly (weekly or bi-weekly) with automated tools.
- Run tests after every dependency update. Never blindly bump versions.
