# Go Standards

## Style

- Follow `gofmt` — no debates about formatting.
- Run `golangci-lint` with a strict config in CI.
- Use `golint`/`staticcheck` for catching common mistakes.
- Package names: short, lowercase, no underscores (`http`, `json`, not `http_utils`).

## Error Handling

- Always check returned errors. Never discard with `_` unless explicitly justified.
- Wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` for stack-like tracing.
- Use sentinel errors (`var ErrNotFound = errors.New(...)`) for expected error conditions.
- Check errors with `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()`, not string comparison.
- Return errors, don't panic. Reserve `panic` for truly unrecoverable situations.

## Concurrency

- Prefer channels for communication, mutexes for shared state.
- Always use `context.Context` for cancellation and timeouts.
- Start goroutines only when you know how they'll stop — prevent leaks.
- Use `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for goroutine completion.
- Use `errgroup.Group` for parallel tasks that can fail.

## Patterns

- Accept interfaces, return structs.
- Keep interfaces small — 1-2 methods (Go proverb).
- Use table-driven tests for comprehensive test coverage.
- Use `struct{}` for signals/sets (zero memory allocation).
- Use `defer` for cleanup — but be aware of loop pitfalls.

## Project Layout

```
cmd/            # Entry points (main packages)
internal/       # Private packages
pkg/            # Public, reusable packages
api/            # API definitions (proto, OpenAPI)
```

## Dependencies

- Use Go modules. Keep `go.mod` tidy with `go mod tidy`.
- Vendor dependencies for reproducible builds when needed.
- Minimize external dependencies — Go stdlib is comprehensive.
