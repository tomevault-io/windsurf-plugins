# Vue.js 3 Standards

## Composition API

- Use `<script setup>` syntax — it's the recommended default.
- Use `ref()` for primitives, `reactive()` for objects.
- Extract reusable logic into composables (`use` prefix): `useAuth()`, `useFetch()`.
- Use `computed()` for derived state. Never manually sync reactive values.
- Use `watch` / `watchEffect` sparingly — prefer computed or template bindings.

## Components

- One component per `.vue` file. Use PascalCase for component names.
- Define props with `defineProps<T>()` using TypeScript generics.
- Define emits with `defineEmits<T>()` for type-safe events.
- Use `v-model` with `defineModel()` for two-way binding.
- Keep templates readable — extract complex logic into computed properties.

## Component Design

- Use slots for flexible content distribution.
- Use `provide/inject` for deep prop passing (theme, config), not for general state.
- Prefer small, focused components over large monolithic ones.
- Colocate styles with `<style scoped>`. Use CSS modules for complex cases.

## State Management

- Use Pinia as the standard store. One store per domain concern.
- Access stores directly in components — no mappers needed.
- Keep store actions for async operations and complex mutations.
- Use `storeToRefs()` to destructure store state reactively.

## Performance

- Use `v-once` for static content that never changes.
- Use `v-memo` for expensive list rendering.
- Lazy-load routes with `defineAsyncComponent` or dynamic `import()`.
- Use `<KeepAlive>` for components with expensive initialization.
- Use `shallowRef` / `shallowReactive` for large objects when deep reactivity isn't needed.
