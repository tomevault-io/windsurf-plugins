# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsibility (SRP)

- Each module/class/function should have one reason to change.
- If you describe what a class does and use "and", it probably does too much.
- Extract distinct responsibilities into separate units.

## Open/Closed (OCP)

- Open for extension, closed for modification.
- Use interfaces, strategy pattern, or composition to extend behavior without modifying existing code.
- Prefer adding new code over changing existing working code.

## Liskov Substitution (LSP)

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking correctness.
- Don't override methods in ways that violate the base contract.
- Prefer composition over inheritance when behavior diverges.

## Interface Segregation (ISP)

- Don't force clients to depend on methods they don't use.
- Split large interfaces into smaller, focused ones.
- A class implementing an interface should use all its methods.

## Dependency Inversion (DIP)

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Inject dependencies via constructor/parameters — don't instantiate them internally.
- Use dependency injection for external services (DB, API clients, file system).

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract duplicated logic into shared functions/modules.
- But avoid premature DRY — wait for 3 occurrences before abstracting (Rule of Three).
- Shared code should represent the **same concept**, not just similar-looking code.

## KISS & YAGNI

- **KISS**: Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements.
- **YAGNI**: Don't build features or abstractions you don't need yet.
- Refactor toward patterns when complexity demands it, not before.
