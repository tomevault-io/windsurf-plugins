# Performance

## Performance Philosophy

- **Measure first, optimize second.** Never optimize blindly without profiling.
- Algorithmic improvements always beat micro-optimizations (e.g., O(1) > O(n) > O(n^2)).
- Performance expectations are formalized as SLO targets (see `core-observability`).
- Favor deterministic background processing (queues) over blocking user-facing requests.

## Performance Budgets

Define rigid limits for application metrics to prevent regression:

### Frontend Budget
- **Bundle Size**: Initial JS payload < 200KB (gzipped).
- **Core Web Vitals** (75th percentile):
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
  - First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: < 3.5s on Fast 3G.

### Backend Budget
- **API Response Latency**: p95 < 200ms, p99 < 500ms.
- **Database Query Time**: < 10ms for OLTP queries.
- **Payload Size**: < 100KB uncompressed for standard JSON payloads (paginate otherwise).

## Database Query Optimization

The database is usually the bottleneck.

### 1. The N+1 Query Problem
- **Smell**: Fetching a list of $N$ items, then making $N$ separate sub-queries to fetch related data.
- **Fix**: Use JOINs, Batching (e.g., GraphQL DataLoader), or `WHERE id IN (...)` to fetch related data in exactly 1+1 queries.

### 2. Indexes
- Add indexes to all Foreign Keys.
- Add indexes to fields used frequently in `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, or `GROUP BY` clauses.
- Use Compound Indexes intelligently (order of columns matters!).
- Avoid over-indexing (slows down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

### 3. Query Selectivity
- **NEVER use `SELECT *`**. Only query the exact columns defined by the data contract (JSON Schema).
- Use database-level pagination (`LIMIT`, `OFFSET` or Cursor-based pagination).

### 4. Analysis
- Run `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on slow queries to understand query plans and identify missing indexes or sequential scans.

## Caching Strategy Decision Tree

Caching is hard. Choose the right cache for the job:

```
Is the response identical for all users?
│
├── YES ↓
│   Is the data rarely changed? (e.g., static assets, config lists)
│   ├── YES → HTTP Cache (CDN, Varnish) + Cache-Control max-age.
│   └── NO  → App-Level Cache (Redis, Memcached) with pub/sub invalidation.
│
└── NO  (Data is user-specific) ↓
    Does the query take > 50ms to run?
    ├── YES → Cache the *fragment* or *query result* in Redis using `user:{id}:data:{hash}` key.
    └── NO  → Do not cache. Query the database directly. Keep complexity low.
```

- **Cache Invalidation is hard**: Prefer expiring caches (TTL) over explicit invalidation whenever the business logic allows "eventual consistency".

## Frontend Performance Patterns

### 1. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- Never load the entire app bundle on the first paint.
- Split bundles by Route/Page.
- Lazy load heavy components (charts, rich text editors) or data outside the viewport until the user scrolls `IntersectionObserver`.

### 2. Image Optimization
- Use next-gen formats (WebP, AVIF).
- Resize images on the server — never send a 4MB 4K image and render it in a `200x200` CSS box.
- Use `loading="lazy"` on images below the fold.

### 3. Rendering
- Prevent unnecessary React component re-renders (use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` deliberately, not universally).
- Virtualize/window massive lists (e.g., `react-window` for a list of 10,000 logs).
- Keep CSS selectors simple (avoid huge descendant chains). Use utility classes (Tailwind) which minimize CSS payload.

## Node.js / Backend Performance

- **Async I/O**: Use `Promise.all` for parallel execution of unrelated HTTP or DB calls. Don't block the event loop with synchronous heavy CPU tasks.
- **Worker Threads**: Offload CPU-heavy computation (hashing, image processing, massive JSON parsing) to Worker Threads or separate microservices.
- **Connection Pooling**: Keep a persistent pool of database connections open to avoid the overhead of a TCP handshake per request.
- **Garbage Collection**: Avoid massive in-memory objects (e.g., buffering a 1GB CSV file into an array). Stream files instead (`fs.createReadStream`).
