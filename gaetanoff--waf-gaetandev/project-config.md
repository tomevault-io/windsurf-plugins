# Rust Standards

## Ownership & Borrowing

- Prefer borrowing (`&T`, `&mut T`) over cloning. Clone only when necessary.
- Use `&str` for function parameters accepting strings, `String` for owned data.
- Prefer `&[T]` over `&Vec<T>` for function parameters.
- Use `Cow<'_, str>` when a function may or may not need to allocate.

## Error Handling

- Use `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors, `panic!` only for unrecoverable bugs.
- Define custom error types with `thiserror` for libraries, `anyhow` for applications.
- Use the `?` operator for error propagation — avoid manual `match` on `Result` when not needed.
- Provide context with `.context("message")` (anyhow) or custom error variants.

## Idiomatic Patterns

- Use iterators and combinators (`map`, `filter`, `collect`) over manual loops.
- Prefer `match` over `if let` chains for exhaustive pattern matching.
- Use `Option` methods: `unwrap_or`, `unwrap_or_else`, `map`, `and_then`.
- Use `impl Trait` in function signatures for cleaner APIs.
- Derive common traits: `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq` on structs.

## Safety

- Avoid `unsafe` unless absolutely necessary. Document every `unsafe` block with a safety comment.
- Use `clippy` with `--deny warnings` in CI.
- Use `rustfmt` for consistent formatting.
- Prefer `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for shared mutable state across threads.

## Project Structure

- Use workspaces for multi-crate projects.
- Keep `lib.rs` as the public API surface. Use `mod.rs` or file-based modules.
- Expose minimal public API — default to private, make public only what's needed.
- Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules for unit tests colocated with source.

## Performance

- Use `&str` / slices to avoid unnecessary allocations.
- Use `Vec::with_capacity()` when the size is known upfront.
- Profile with `cargo flamegraph` or `criterion` before optimizing.
- Prefer stack allocation over heap when data size is small and known.
