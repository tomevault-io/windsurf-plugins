# Spec-Driven Iteration

## Feedback Loop

After each implementation cycle:

1. **Review**: Compare implementation against specs and conformance test results.
2. **Identify gaps**: What spec scenarios are missing? What contracts are incomplete?
3. **Update specs**: Evolve specs first — add missing contracts, refine existing ones.
4. **Update conformance tests**: Generate new tests from updated specs.
5. **Implement**: Make targeted changes to pass the new conformance tests.
6. **Validate**: Re-run all conformance gates to confirm nothing broke.

## Spec Evolution Triggers

Update specs when you see:
- **Missing scenarios**: real usage reveals behavior not covered by any spec.
- **Contract gaps**: edge cases or error conditions not defined in the contract.
- **Performance misses**: SLOs need adjustment based on real-world measurements.
- **Security findings**: new threat vectors require additional security contracts.
- **User feedback**: UX issues require changes to UI contracts or behavior specs.
- **Integration changes**: external service changes require contract updates.

## Spec Evolution Rules

- **Spec changes come first**. Never change code without updating the spec.
- Spec changes require review — they affect the contract with consumers.
- Backward-compatible changes: add new fields (optional), new endpoints, new error codes.
- Breaking changes: require a major version bump and migration guide in the spec.
- Run all conformance tests before and after spec changes. Green → evolve → green.
- Make small, incremental spec changes. Don't rewrite entire contracts at once.

## Refactoring (Spec-Aware)

Refactoring triggers remain the same, but with a spec constraint:

- **Duplication**: same logic in 3+ places → extract, but ensure the shared code still conforms.
- **Long functions**: >40 lines → split, but each piece must still satisfy its spec contract.
- **Large files**: >300 lines → break into modules, but maintain spec conformance at each boundary.
- **Contract violations**: code that no longer matches the spec → fix code, not spec (unless spec is wrong).

Refactoring rules:
- Refactor in dedicated commits — never mix refactoring with spec changes.
- Run conformance tests before and after. Green → refactor → green.
- Internal refactoring (no contract change) doesn't require spec updates.
- If refactoring changes a public interface, update the spec first.

## Performance Optimization Cycle (Spec-Driven)

1. **Check SLOs**: compare actual metrics against performance specs.
2. **Profile**: identify the actual bottleneck with tools.
3. **Hypothesize**: propose a change that brings metrics within SLO bounds.
4. **Implement**: make the change.
5. **Measure**: compare against SLOs. If within bounds, done. If not, iterate.
6. **Update specs**: if SLOs were unrealistic, update the performance spec with justification.

## Technical Debt Management

- Track debt as **spec conformance gaps** — where code doesn't fully match specs.
- Track debt as **spec completeness gaps** — where specs don't cover all real behavior.
- Allocate time for debt reduction in each iteration.
- Prioritize debt that causes conformance test failures or blocks new specs.
- Distinguish between intentional debt (trade-off documented in ADR) and accidental debt.

## UX Refinement (Driven by UI Specs)

- Review the UI against UI contracts and component specs.
- Check consistency: do components match their prop contracts?
- Verify responsive behavior against breakpoint specs.
- Test with keyboard-only navigation per accessibility specs.
- When UX needs change, update the UI spec first, then the components.

## Documentation Updates

After each iteration:
- Specs are the documentation — ensure they're up to date.
- Auto-generate API docs from OpenAPI specs.
- Auto-generate type docs from data contracts.
- Update ADRs if architectural decisions evolved.
- Update changelog with spec version changes.
- Remove outdated specs — stale specs mislead worse than stale docs.

## Continuous Improvement Mindset

- After completing a project, conduct a retrospective on the spec process.
- Which specs were most valuable? Which were over-specified?
- Capture reusable spec patterns and templates for future projects.
- Update bootstrap rules based on lessons learned.
- Share spec authoring knowledge across the team.
