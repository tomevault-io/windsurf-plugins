# C++ Standards (C++17/20/23)

## Memory & Resource Management (RAII)

- Never use raw `new`/`delete`. Use `std::make_unique` and `std::make_shared`.
- `std::unique_ptr` by default. `std::shared_ptr` only when ownership is truly shared.
- Use RAII for every resource: memory, files, locks, sockets, handles.
- Pass smart pointers to functions only when transferring or sharing ownership. Otherwise pass `T&` or `T*`.
- Use `std::span<T>` (C++20) for non-owning views into contiguous data.

```cpp
// ✅ RAII + smart pointers
auto user = std::make_unique<User>("Alice", 30);
auto config = std::make_shared<Config>(load_config());

// ✅ Non-owning parameter — no smart pointer needed
void process(const User& user);
```

## Modern C++ Patterns

- Use `auto` when the type is obvious. Be explicit when it aids readability.
- Use structured bindings: `auto [key, value] = map_entry;`.
- Use `constexpr` for compile-time computation. Prefer `constexpr` over `#define` macros.
- Use `std::optional<T>` for values that may be absent. Never return raw pointers for "maybe null".
- Use `std::variant` for type-safe unions. Use `std::visit` for exhaustive handling.
- Use `std::string_view` for non-owning string references.

## Error Handling

- Use exceptions for truly exceptional failures. Use `std::expected<T, E>` (C++23) or a Result type for expected errors.
- Prefer `noexcept` on functions that cannot throw (move constructors, destructors).
- Avoid exception specifications other than `noexcept`.
- Use RAII so cleanup is automatic — no need for try/catch just for resource management.

## Containers & Algorithms

- Prefer STL containers (`std::vector`, `std::array`, `std::unordered_map`) over C arrays.
- Use `std::vector` as the default container. Reserve capacity when size is known.
- Use range-based `for` loops. Use `<algorithm>` and `<ranges>` (C++20) over hand-written loops.
- Use `emplace_back` over `push_back` to avoid unnecessary copies.
- Prefer `std::array` over C-style arrays for fixed-size collections.

## Const Correctness

- Mark everything `const` that shouldn't change: variables, references, member functions.
- Use `const&` for function parameters that don't need mutation.
- Use `consteval` (C++20) for functions that must run at compile time.
- Make member functions `const` unless they modify state.

## Concurrency

- Use `std::thread`, `std::jthread` (C++20), or `std::async` for parallelism.
- Protect shared data with `std::mutex` + `std::lock_guard` / `std::scoped_lock`.
- Prefer lock-free structures (`std::atomic`) for simple shared state.
- Use `std::condition_variable` for thread signaling.
- Avoid data races — they are undefined behavior in C++.

## Build & Safety

- Compile with `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror`. Enable sanitizers in debug builds.
- Use `clang-tidy` with the C++ Core Guidelines checks.
- Use CMake as the build system. Structure: `src/`, `include/`, `tests/`, `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Use `#pragma once` or traditional include guards in all headers.
- Minimize includes in headers — use forward declarations where possible.
