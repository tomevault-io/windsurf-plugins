# Dart & Flutter Standards

## Style & Naming

- Follow the official Dart style guide. Use `dart format` (enforced).
- Classes, enums, typedefs: `PascalCase`. Variables, functions, parameters: `camelCase`.
- Constants: `camelCase` (Dart convention, not UPPER_SNAKE).
- Private members: prefix with `_`. Libraries: `snake_case`.
- File names: `snake_case.dart` matching the primary class/content.

## Null Safety

- Dart is sound null-safe by default. Embrace it fully.
- Use `?` only when null is a valid semantic value — not as a lazy default.
- Prefer `late` over nullable for fields guaranteed to be initialized before access.
- Use `??` (if-null) and `?.` (null-aware) operators to handle nullable values concisely.
- Avoid `!` (null assertion) — handle the null case explicitly.

## Patterns

- Use enhanced enums with fields and methods for structured constants.
- Use sealed classes (Dart 3) for exhaustive state modeling.
- Use pattern matching (`switch` expressions, destructuring) for cleaner branching.
- Use extension types for zero-cost type wrappers.
- Prefer `final` variables by default — use `var` only when mutation is needed.

```dart
// ✅ Sealed class + pattern matching
sealed class AuthState {}
class Authenticated extends AuthState { final User user; ... }
class Unauthenticated extends AuthState {}
class Loading extends AuthState {}

Widget build(BuildContext context) => switch (state) {
  Authenticated(:final user) => HomeScreen(user: user),
  Unauthenticated() => LoginScreen(),
  Loading() => CircularProgressIndicator(),
};
```

## Flutter Widgets

- Extract widgets into separate classes — don't build deep `build()` methods.
- Use `const` constructors wherever possible for widget reuse optimization.
- Prefer `StatelessWidget` unless local mutable state is needed.
- Use `Keys` correctly: `ValueKey` for data identity, `UniqueKey` for forced rebuilds.
- Keep `build()` methods pure — no side effects.

## State Management

- Use Riverpod, Bloc, or Provider (pick one per project, stay consistent).
- Separate business logic from UI. Never put logic in `build()`.
- Use immutable state objects. Create new instances for state changes.
- Handle loading, error, and data states explicitly (AsyncValue in Riverpod, etc.).

## Async

- Use `async/await` over raw `Future` chaining.
- Use `Stream` for multiple async events. Prefer `StreamController` broadcast sparingly.
- Always handle errors in Futures — unhandled errors crash the app.
- Use `Completer` only when bridging callback-based APIs to Futures.

## Testing

- Use `flutter_test` for widget tests. `test` for pure Dart.
- Use `mocktail` or `mockito` for mocking. Prefer fakes for simple cases.
- Widget tests: `pumpWidget`, `pump`, `find`, `expect`. Test interaction flows.
- Use golden tests for visual regression when UI precision matters.
