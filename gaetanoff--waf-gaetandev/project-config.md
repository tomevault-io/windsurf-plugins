# Project Structure

## Principles

- Organize by **feature/domain**, not by file type (prefer `user/controller.ts` over `controllers/user.ts`).
- Keep related files close together (colocation).
- Maintain a flat structure — avoid deep nesting beyond 3-4 levels.
- Every directory should have a clear, single purpose.

## Naming Conventions

- Directories: `kebab-case` (e.g. `user-profile/`, `api-clients/`).
- Files: match the language convention (PascalCase for components, kebab-case for modules, snake_case for Python).
- Index/barrel files: use sparingly — they can hide dependencies and slow builds.

## Standard Layout

```
src/
  features/          # Feature-based modules
  shared/            # Shared utilities, types, constants
  infrastructure/    # Database, external services, config
  tests/             # Test files (or colocated with source)
docs/                # Documentation
scripts/             # Build, deploy, migration scripts
```

## Configuration Files

- Keep config files at the project root (`tsconfig.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.).
- Use `.env.example` as a template — never commit `.env`.
- Centralize environment-specific config in a single module.

## Boundaries

- Define clear module boundaries. Modules should expose a public API and hide internals.
- Avoid circular dependencies between modules.
- Shared code goes in `shared/` or `common/` — not duplicated across features.
