# Docker

## Dockerfile

- Use official, minimal base images (`alpine`, `slim`, `distroless`).
- Use multi-stage builds to separate build and runtime stages.
- Order layers by change frequency: system deps → app deps → source code.
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude `node_modules`, `.git`, `.env`, build artifacts.
- Don't run as root — create and switch to a non-root user.

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine
RUN addgroup -S app && adduser -S app -G app
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
USER app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]
```

## Best Practices

- Pin base image versions (`node:20.11-alpine`, not `node:latest`).
- Combine `RUN` commands to reduce layers: `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ...`.
- Use `COPY` over `ADD` unless you need tar extraction or URL fetching.
- Set `HEALTHCHECK` for production containers.
- Use build args for build-time config, env vars for runtime config.

## Docker Compose

- Use `docker-compose.yml` for local development orchestration.
- Define named volumes for persistent data (databases).
- Use `depends_on` with health checks for service startup ordering.
- Override with `docker-compose.override.yml` for local dev settings.
- Keep production deployment in separate compose files or use orchestrators.

## Security

- Scan images for vulnerabilities (`docker scout`, `trivy`).
- Don't store secrets in images — use runtime secrets/env vars.
- Use read-only file systems where possible (`--read-only`).
