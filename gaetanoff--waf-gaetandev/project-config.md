# DevOps & CI/CD (Spec-Aware)

## CI Pipeline

Every project should have a CI pipeline with **spec validation** as a first-class step:

### Minimum Pipeline

```yaml
# Stages (run in order)
1. Install dependencies
2. Spec lint (OpenAPI, JSON Schema validation)
3. Spec conformance check (detect spec-to-code drift)
4. Lint and format check
5. Type check (if applicable)
6. Conformance tests (spec-generated)
7. Unit tests
8. Build
9. Integration tests (on PR/merge)
```

### Extended Pipeline (for production projects)

```yaml
# Additional stages
10. Contract tests (Pact / consumer-driven)
11. Security scan (dependency audit, SAST)
12. E2E tests from behavior specs (on merge to main)
13. Docker image build
14. Deploy to staging
15. Smoke tests on staging (conformance subset)
16. Deploy to production (manual trigger or auto)
```

### Spec-Specific CI Steps

- **Spec lint**: validate OpenAPI with `spectral`, JSON Schema with `ajv`, AsyncAPI with `asyncapi-cli`.
- **Spec drift detection**: compare generated types against spec schemas — fail if they diverge.
- **Conformance tests**: run `dredd`/`prism`/`schemathesis` against the running API.
- **Contract tests**: run `pact` tests to validate integration contracts.
- **Spec change detection**: on PRs that modify `specs/`, require spec review approval.

## Deployment Strategy

Choose based on risk tolerance:

| Strategy | Risk | Downtime | Complexity |
|----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Rolling** | Medium | Zero | Low |
| **Blue-Green** | Low | Zero | Medium |
| **Canary** | Low | Zero | High |
| **Recreate** | High | Yes | Very low |

## Environment Management

- Maintain at least 3 environments: development, staging, production.
- Staging should mirror production as closely as possible.
- Use environment variables for all environment-specific configuration.
- Never use production data in development. Use seed data or anonymized copies.
- Run conformance tests against staging before promoting to production.

## Infrastructure as Code

- Define infrastructure with Terraform, Pulumi, CDK, or similar.
- Version control all infrastructure definitions.
- Use modules/stacks for reusable infrastructure components.
- Apply least privilege to all service accounts and IAM roles.

## Containerization

- Containerize all services for consistent deployment (see `specific-docker` rule).
- Use multi-stage builds for smallest possible images.
- Pin base image versions. Scan images for vulnerabilities.
- Define health checks for all containers (matching the health endpoint contract).
- Use docker-compose for local development, orchestrators for production.

## Monitoring & Observability

### The Three Pillars

1. **Logs**: structured JSON logs with correlation IDs. Centralize with ELK/Grafana Loki.
2. **Metrics**: request rate, error rate, latency (RED). CPU, memory, disk (USE). Export to Prometheus/Datadog.
3. **Traces**: distributed tracing for request flow across services. Use OpenTelemetry.

### SLO-Based Alerting (Spec-Driven)

- Define SLOs in performance specs (p50/p95/p99 latency, error rate, availability).
- Alert when SLI approaches the error budget defined in specs.
- Alert on symptoms (high error rate, high latency), not causes.
- Avoid alert fatigue — every alert should be actionable.
- Establish on-call runbooks for common alerts.

## Secrets Management

- Never store secrets in code, config files, or environment variables in CI/CD config.
- Use a secrets manager: Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault.
- Rotate secrets on a schedule and after any breach.
- Audit secret access logs regularly.

## Backup & Recovery

- Automate database backups. Test restoration regularly.
- Define RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) in specs.
- Document and test the disaster recovery plan.
- Keep backups in a different region/zone than production.
