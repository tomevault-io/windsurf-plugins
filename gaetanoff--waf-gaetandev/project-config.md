# Code Review

## Before Submitting

- [ ] Code compiles/builds without errors or warnings.
- [ ] All tests pass. New tests cover the changed behavior.
- [ ] No debug code, console logs, or commented-out code left behind.
- [ ] Self-reviewed the diff — read every changed line.
- [ ] PR description explains what changed and why.

## Review Checklist

### Correctness
- Does the code do what it claims?
- Are edge cases handled (null, empty, boundary values)?
- Are race conditions or concurrency issues possible?

### Security
- Is user input validated and sanitized?
- Are secrets and credentials kept out of code?
- Are authorization checks in place?

### Maintainability
- Is the code easy to understand without the PR description?
- Are names clear and consistent?
- Is complexity justified or can it be simplified?

### Performance
- Are there N+1 queries or unnecessary loops?
- Are large datasets paginated?
- Are expensive operations cached or debounced?

### Testing
- Are new code paths tested?
- Do tests verify behavior, not implementation?
- Are error paths tested?

## Giving Feedback

- Be specific: point to the line, suggest an alternative.
- Distinguish between blocking issues and nits/suggestions.
- Ask questions instead of making demands ("Could we...?" not "You should...").
- Praise good patterns and clever solutions.
