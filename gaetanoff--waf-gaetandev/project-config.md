# Spec-Driven Planning

## Requirements as Specifications

- Decompose the project into epics → features → specs → tasks.
- For each feature, write a **feature spec** defining: inputs, outputs, contracts, edge cases, error cases.
- Distinguish between must-have (MVP), should-have, and nice-to-have specs.
- Identify external dependencies and define **integration contracts** for each.
- Map out the user journey for each core use case as a sequence of contract interactions.

## Scoping

- Define MVP scope as a **minimal set of specs** that delivers value.
- Identify risks and unknowns early. Write **spike specs** to prototype the riskiest contracts.
- List assumptions and validate them against specs before building on top of them.
- Estimate relative complexity for each spec (S/M/L/XL).
- Plan for incremental delivery — each increment delivers a complete set of conforming specs.

## Spec-Based Acceptance Criteria

Write acceptance criteria as **executable specifications**:

```
Feature: [Feature Name]
Spec: [Contract Reference]

Given [precondition — initial state / data contract]
When [action — API call / user interaction / event]
Then [expected outcome — response contract / state change / side effect]
And [contract validation — response matches schema X]
```

Every feature spec needs:
- Happy path criteria with exact input/output contracts.
- Error path criteria with exact error response contracts.
- Performance criteria (response time, throughput) as measurable SLOs.
- Security criteria (access control, data protection) as authorization contracts.

## Spec-Driven Task Breakdown

For each feature, create a spec-first implementation plan:

1. **Spec authoring**: write data contracts, API contracts, UI contracts.
2. **Spec review**: validate contracts with stakeholders, check consistency.
3. **Conformance tests**: generate tests from specs before any implementation.
4. **Data layer**: models and schema derived from data contracts.
5. **Business logic**: services and validation derived from behavior specs.
6. **API/Interface**: endpoints derived from API contracts.
7. **UI** (if applicable): components derived from UI contracts.
8. **Conformance validation**: all tests pass against implementation.
9. **Documentation**: auto-generated from specs (OpenAPI docs, type docs).

## Prioritization

- Start with **foundational contracts** (auth contract, core entity schemas).
- Build specs that unblock other specs first (shared types, common error contracts).
- Defer optimization and polish specs until core contracts are stable.
- Allocate time for spec review, conformance testing, and contract evolution.

## Constraints Checklist

Before writing specs, clarify:
- [ ] Target platforms and browsers.
- [ ] Performance requirements as SLOs (latency p50/p95/p99, throughput, concurrent users).
- [ ] Security and compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2) as security contracts.
- [ ] Accessibility standards (WCAG level) as UI contracts.
- [ ] Internationalization / localization needs as data format contracts.
- [ ] Deployment environment (cloud provider, containers, serverless).
- [ ] API versioning strategy and backward compatibility constraints.
- [ ] Budget constraints for infrastructure and third-party services.

## Spec Formats by Layer

| Layer | Spec Format | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **API** | OpenAPI 3.x / AsyncAPI | `specs/api/openapi.yaml` |
| **Data** | JSON Schema / TypeScript interfaces | `specs/schemas/user.schema.json` |
| **Events** | AsyncAPI / CloudEvents schema | `specs/events/order-created.yaml` |
| **UI** | Component prop types / Storybook stories | `specs/ui/button.props.ts` |
| **Integration** | Contract tests (Pact, Dredd) | `specs/contracts/payment-api.pact.json` |
| **Behavior** | Given-When-Then / Cucumber | `specs/features/checkout.feature` |
