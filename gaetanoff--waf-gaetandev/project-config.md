# Spec-First Implementation

## Spec-Driven Vertical Slices

Build features as complete vertical slices, starting from the spec:

```
❌ Code-first (write code, spec later):    ✅ Spec-first (spec drives code):
1. Write models                             1. Auth spec → conformance tests → model → service → API → UI
2. Write services                           2. Users spec → conformance tests → model → service → API → UI
3. Write controllers                        3. Orders spec → conformance tests → model → service → API → UI
4. Write UI                                 4. Dashboard spec → conformance tests → model → service → API → UI
5. Write tests
6. Write docs
```

Each slice: **spec → conformance tests → implementation → validation**.

## Implementation Order

1. **Shared contracts**: error envelope, pagination, auth headers, shared schemas.
2. **Conformance test harness**: set up spec validation tooling and test runners.
3. **Authentication**: auth contract is usually a dependency for all other contracts.
4. **Core entities**: implement data contracts as models, schemas, migrations.
5. **Business logic**: implement behavior specs as services and use cases.
6. **API layer**: implement API contracts as routes, controllers, middleware.
7. **UI layer**: implement UI contracts as components, pages, state management.
8. **Integration layer**: implement integration contracts as external service clients.

## Spec-First Coding Patterns

### Contract-to-Code Flow

For each spec contract:

1. **Read the spec**: understand the exact input/output contract.
2. **Generate types**: derive TypeScript interfaces / Pydantic models / Go structs from the schema.
3. **Write conformance tests**: tests that validate the implementation matches the spec.
4. **Implement**: write the minimal code that passes conformance tests.
5. **Validate**: run conformance tests. Green = done. Red = fix implementation, not the test.

### Spec Gap Protocol

When implementation reveals something the spec didn't cover:

1. **Stop implementing**. Don't invent behavior not in the spec.
2. **Document the gap**: what scenario is missing from the spec?
3. **Update the spec**: add the missing contract/scenario.
4. **Review the spec change**: get approval if needed.
5. **Write conformance test**: for the new spec.
6. **Resume implementation**: now implement the new behavior.

### Error-First from Contracts

- The error contract defines all possible error responses.
- Implement error handling FIRST — the error envelope is a shared contract.
- For every endpoint, implement error responses before success responses.
- Every error code in the spec must be reachable and tested.

## Code Generation from Specs

Leverage specs to generate boilerplate:

| Spec | Generated Code |
|------|---------------|
| OpenAPI | Route definitions, request/response types, API client SDK |
| JSON Schema | TypeScript interfaces, validation functions, DB schema |
| AsyncAPI | Event handlers, message types, pub/sub boilerplate |
| Pact contracts | Integration test stubs, mock servers |
| Gherkin features | E2E test skeletons, step definitions |

Use code generation tools when available:
- `openapi-generator` / `orval` / `swagger-codegen` for API types and clients.
- `json-schema-to-typescript` / `quicktype` for data types.
- `dredd` / `prism` for API contract testing.

## Incremental Delivery

### Conforming Software at Every Step

- Every commit should leave the project in a **spec-conforming** state.
- Use feature flags to merge incomplete features without exposing non-conforming endpoints.
- Deploy to a staging environment frequently — validate conformance in realistic conditions.

### Progressive Spec Implementation

- Implement the core contracts first with minimal UI.
- Add interactivity, animations, and polish incrementally.
- Optimize only after conformance tests pass and profiling shows a real bottleneck.

## Common Anti-Patterns

- **Code Before Spec**: writing code then retro-fitting a spec to match. Spec first, always.
- **Spec Ignorance**: implementing behavior not defined in any spec. If it's not spec'd, don't build it.
- **Test-Last Conformance**: writing conformance tests after implementation. Tests come from specs, before code.
- **Spec Drift**: implementation diverges from spec without updating the spec. Conformance tests catch this.
- **Over-Implementation**: building more than the spec requires. The spec is the scope.
- **Hardcoded Contracts**: embedding contract values in code instead of deriving from spec definitions.

## Code Organization Within Features

```
features/users/
  specs/                  # Feature-level specs (if not in top-level specs/)
  __tests__/
    conformance/          # Spec conformance tests
    unit/                 # Unit tests for business logic
    integration/          # Integration tests
  components/             # UI components matching UI contracts
  hooks/                  # Custom hooks for this feature
  services/               # Business logic matching behavior specs
  types.ts                # Types generated from data contracts
  schema.ts               # Validation schemas derived from JSON Schema
  routes.ts               # Routes derived from API contract
  constants.ts            # Feature-specific constants
  index.ts                # Public API of the feature module
```
