# Swift & SwiftUI (Spec-Driven)

## Language Fundamentals

- Swift emphasizes safety and clarity. Leverage the compiler to enforce correctness.
- Prefer `let` (constants) over `var` (variables). Mutability should be explicit and scoped.
- Prefer `struct` (value types) over `class` (reference types) by default. Use classes only when identity or shared mutable state is required.
- Name types using `UpperCamelCase` and properties/methods using `lowerCamelCase`.
- Use descriptive naming that reads like English. Include argument labels to clarify intent (e.g., `func fetchUser(withID id: String)`).

## Null Safety & Optionals

- Avoid force-unwrapping (`!`) and implicitly unwrapped optionals as much as possible. They circumvent Swift's safety guarantees and cause crashes.
- Use optional binding (`if let`, `guard let`) to cleanly unwrap optionals.
- Use the nil-coalescing operator (`??`) to provide sensible defaults.
- Use `guard` statements for early exits to prevent nested `if` statements (the "Happy Path" should not be indented).

## Error Handling

- Follow `global-error-handling` rules.
- Use `Throws` and `Result<T, Error>` for recoverable errors.
- Create custom `Error` enums that conform to `LocalizedError` for user-facing error messages.
- Use `do-catch` blocks to handle errors gracefully.

## Concurrency (async/await)

- Embrace modern Swift concurrency (`async`/`await`, `Task`, `TaskGroup`). Avoid legacy completion handlers and Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) where possible.
- Use `@MainActor` to ensure UI updates happen on the main thread.
- Use `Task.detached` only when the work is completely independent of the current context. Handle cancellation appropriately using `Task.isCancelled` or `Task.checkCancellation()`.

## SwiftUI Best Practices

- Make Views as small, focused, and reusable as possible.
- Separate logic from presentation. Views should mostly reflect state, not compute it. (MVVM or pure Redux-like flow).
- Use proper state wrappers:
  - `@State` for simple, purely local, and private UI state.
  - `@Binding` to pass read/write access down to child views.
  - `@Environment` and `@EnvironmentObject` for global/dependency injection.
  - `@StateObject` to instantiate an observable object that the view owns.
  - `@ObservedObject` to pass an observable object down from a parent.
- Leverage SwiftUI's built-in modifiers before creating custom ones.
- Ensure accessibility. Provide meaningful accessibility labels (`.accessibilityLabel(_:)`) and traits, and support dynamic typing (`.font(.body)`).

## Data Models & Parsing

- Derive data models from JSON Schema specs.
- Use `Codable` for parsing JSON. Don't write manual parsing code.
- Keep network and parsing logic in dedicated services/repositories, separate from UI and ViewModels.
- Use custom `CodingKeys` when API keys don't match Swift naming conventions (e.g., snake_case to camelCase).

## UI/UX Rules

- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).
- Support Dark Mode dynamically. Use system colors (e.g., `.primary`, `.secondary`, `.systemBackground`) or define adaptive color assets in the Asset Catalog.
- Ensure tap targets are minimum 44x44 points.

## Example: Spec-Driven SwiftUI View

```swift
import SwiftUI

// Feature specified in specs/features/profile.feature
struct ProfileView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ProfileViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Group {
                switch viewModel.state {
                case .loading:
                    ProgressView()
                case .loaded(let profile):
                    ProfileContentView(profile: profile)
                case .error(let error):
                    ErrorView(error: error, retryAction: viewModel.loadProfile)
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Profile")
        }
        .task {
            // Uses async/await inside .task
            await viewModel.loadProfile()
        }
    }
}
```
