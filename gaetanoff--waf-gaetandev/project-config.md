# UX & UI Design

## Principles

- **Clarity over cleverness**: users should immediately understand what they can do.
- **Consistency**: same action → same result, same element → same appearance.
- **Feedback**: every user action should produce visible feedback (loading, success, error).
- **Forgiveness**: allow undo, confirm destructive actions, make errors recoverable.
- **Progressive disclosure**: show the essential first, reveal complexity on demand.

## Layout & Visual Hierarchy

- Use a clear visual hierarchy: size, weight, color, and spacing signal importance.
- Maintain consistent spacing with a base unit system (4px or 8px grid).
- Use whitespace generously — it improves readability and reduces cognitive load.
- Group related elements visually. Separate unrelated groups with space or dividers.
- Align elements to a grid. Inconsistent alignment looks unprofessional.

## Interactive States

Every interactive element needs these states:

- **Default**: normal appearance.
- **Hover**: visual feedback on mouse over.
- **Focus**: visible focus ring for keyboard navigation (WCAG requirement).
- **Active/Pressed**: feedback during click/tap.
- **Disabled**: visually distinct + non-interactive + tooltip explaining why.
- **Loading**: spinner or skeleton when waiting for async data.

## Forms

- Label every input. Don't use placeholder text as the label.
- Show validation errors inline, next to the field, in real-time.
- Use appropriate input types (`email`, `tel`, `url`, `number`) for mobile keyboards.
- Pre-fill known values. Remember previous entries when appropriate.
- Group related fields. Use multi-step forms for complex flows.
- Place the primary action button at the end of the form, aligned with fields.

## Empty States & Errors

- Design empty states: show helpful guidance, not just "No data."
- Error messages should be: specific, human-readable, actionable ("Try X" not "Error 500").
- Provide a clear path forward from every error state (retry button, help link).
- Use 404 pages that help users navigate back to useful content.

## Responsive Design

- Design mobile-first, enhance for larger screens.
- Test on real devices, not just browser dev tools.
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile.
- Adjust layout, font sizes, and spacing per breakpoint.
- Use responsive images (`srcset`, `<picture>`) for different screen sizes.

## Loading & Performance Perception

- Show skeleton screens instead of spinners for content-heavy pages.
- Use optimistic updates for responsive-feeling interactions.
- Prioritize above-the-fold content loading.
- Show progress indicators for long operations (upload, processing).
- Lazy-load content below the fold.

## Color & Typography

- Use a consistent color palette with defined semantic roles (primary, secondary, error, success).
- Ensure text contrast meets WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text.
- Limit to 2-3 font families maximum.
- Use a type scale for consistent sizing (e.g., 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48).
- Line height for body text: 1.5-1.75 for readability.

## Navigation

- Keep primary navigation consistent across all pages.
- Use breadcrumbs for deep hierarchies.
- Indicate the current page/section in navigation.
- Provide a search function for content-heavy applications.
- Use clear, descriptive labels — not jargon or clever names.

## Accessibility (a11y)

- Use semantic HTML: `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<button>`, `<a>`.
- All images need meaningful `alt` text (or `alt=""` for decorative images).
- Support keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
- Use `aria-` attributes when semantic HTML isn't sufficient.
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver).
- Support `prefers-reduced-motion` and `prefers-color-scheme`.
- Never rely on color alone to convey information (use icons, text, or patterns).

## Micro-interactions

- Animate state transitions smoothly (150-300ms for UI, 300-500ms for emphasis).
- Use easing curves, not linear transitions.
- Animate only what changes — don't animate entire page reloads.
- Respect user preferences: disable animations when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set.
