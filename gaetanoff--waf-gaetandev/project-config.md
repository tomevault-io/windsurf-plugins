# Security

## The SDD Approach to Security

Security is a contract, not an afterthought. Secure by design means that security constraints (authentication, authorized roles, rate limits) are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI and JSON Schema specs.

## OWASP Top 10 2025 Mapping & Mitigations

### 1. Broken Access Control (IDOR)
- **Vulnerability**: A user can access another user's data by guessing their ID.
- **Spec Rule**: Define precise authorization policies per endpoint.
- **Code Rule**: Validate resource ownership on *every* access. Never rely on hidden UI elements.
  ```typescript
  // BAD: Accessing without checking ownership
  const order = await db.orders.find(req.params.id);

  // GOOD: Always scoping by the authenticated user's ID
  const order = await db.orders.find({ id: req.params.id, userId: req.user.id });
  ```

### 2. Cryptographic Failures
- **Vulnerability**: Exposing sensitive data in transit or at rest.
- **Code Rule**: Always use HTTPS. Encrypt sensitive fields (PII, SSN, tokens) at rest using a strong cipher (AES-256-GCM). Hash passwords with Argon2, scrypt, or bcrypt (min work factor 12).
- **Code Rule**: Never write your own crypto. Use standard library or libsodium.

### 3. Injection (SQL, NoSQL, OS Command)
- **Vulnerability**: Untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command.
- **Code Rule**: Parameterize *all* queries. Use an ORM/query builder that parameterizes automatically.
- **Code Rule**: Never safely interpolate user strings into native SQL: `WHERE email = '${userInput}'`.

### 4. Insecure Design
- **Code Rule**: Threat model before writing code. Enunciate the boundaries of trust. Fall back to secure defaults (Deny-by-Default).

### 5. Security Misconfiguration
- **Vulnerability**: Unnecessary features are enabled, default passwords kept, verbose error messages leaked.
- **Code Rule**: Ensure production environments strip stack traces from errors (see `global-error-handling`). Disable directory listing. Configure CORS restrictively.

### 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- **Code Rule**: Run `npm audit`/`pnpm audit`/`cargo audit` in CI. Pin dependencies via lockfiles. Upgrade aggressively.

### 7. Identification and Authentication Failures
- **Vulnerability**: Session fixation, weak passwords, missing MFA.
- **Code Rule**: Enforce strong password complexity. Throttle login attempts (prevent brute force). Use secure, HTTPOnly, SameSite=Strict cookies for session management (never `localStorage` for sensitive tokens unless mitigated against XSS).

### 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
- **Vulnerability**: CI/CD pipeline compromise, missing package signatures, insecure deserialization.
- **Code Rule**: Verity checksums. Avoid `eval()`, `pickle.loads()`, or YAML's `unsafe_load()`.

### 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- **Vulnerability**: Breaches go undetected for months.
- **Code Rule**: Log all authentication events, authorization failures, and critical data changes. Add alerting triggers (see `core-observability`).

### 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Vulnerability**: The server fetches a URL submitted by a user without validating the destination.
- **Code Rule**: If fetching external URLs is required, use an allowlist of domains. Block internal IP addresses (e.g., 169.254.169.254, 127.0.0.1, 10.x.x.x).

## Security Headers

All web responses must include these headers:

- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` (HSTS)
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (or `SAMEORIGIN`)
- `Content-Security-Policy`: Restrict scripts, styles, fonts, and iframes to trusted origins. Default to `default-src 'self'`.
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` (Legacy, but good to keep)

## Rate Limiting

Define rate limits in the API Spec and enforce them at the API Gateway or Application layer.

- Limit per User IP or Bearer Token.
- Distinguish between standard API endpoints (e.g., 100/min) and sensitive endpoints (e.g., `/login` → 5/min).
- Include standard `RateLimit` headers in responses (`RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset`).
- Return `429 Too Many Requests` when limits are exceeded.

## Data Classification

Annotate your JSON Schemas or code models with data classification tags to prevent accidental leakage.

1. **Public**: Intended for public consumption (e.g., marketing copy, blog posts).
2. **Internal**: Default for standard operational data (e.g., system logs without PII).
3. **Confidential**: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) — names, emails, order histories. Requires authorization to access. Must NOT appear in standard logs.
4. **Restricted**: Highly sensitive data — passwords, SSNs, credit card numbers. Must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

## Secrets Management

- **NEVER** commit secrets to version control. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`.
- Use an external Secrets Manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) in staging/production.
- Rotate secrets systematically.
- Scan repositories for leaked secrets using `git-secrets` or TruffleHog in the CI pipeline.
