# Next.js (App Router)

## Server vs Client Components

- Default to Server Components. Add `"use client"` only when you need interactivity, hooks, or browser APIs.
- Push `"use client"` boundary as low as possible in the component tree.
- Server Components can import Client Components, but not vice versa.
- Pass serializable props from Server to Client Components.

## Data Fetching

- Fetch data in Server Components using `async/await` directly.
- Use `fetch()` with Next.js caching: `{ cache: 'force-cache' }`, `{ next: { revalidate: 60 } }`.
- Colocate data fetching with the component that uses it.
- Use `loading.tsx` for streaming/suspense fallbacks.
- Use `error.tsx` for error boundaries at the route level.

## Routing

- Use the `app/` directory with folder-based routing.
- Leverage layouts (`layout.tsx`) for shared UI. They persist across navigations.
- Use route groups `(group)` for organization without affecting URLs.
- Use `generateStaticParams` for static generation of dynamic routes.

## Performance

- Use `<Image>` component for automatic optimization.
- Use `<Link>` for client-side navigation with prefetching.
- Implement metadata with `generateMetadata` for SEO.
- Use Parallel Routes and Intercepting Routes for complex UIs.

## Patterns

- Use Server Actions (`"use server"`) for mutations/form handling.
- Validate inputs in Server Actions with Zod or similar.
- Use `middleware.ts` for auth, redirects, and request-level logic.
- Keep API Routes (`route.ts`) for webhook handlers and external API integrations.
