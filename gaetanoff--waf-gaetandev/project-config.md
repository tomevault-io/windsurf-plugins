# Documentation (Spec-Driven)

## Specs ARE Documentation

In SDD, specifications are the primary documentation. Code comments and separate docs are secondary.

- **API documentation** is auto-generated from OpenAPI specs (Swagger UI, Redoc).
- **Data model documentation** is auto-generated from JSON Schemas.
- **Behavior documentation** is the Gherkin/Given-When-Then feature files.
- **Architecture documentation** is the ADRs referencing spec decisions.
- **Type documentation** is generated from TypeScript interfaces / data contracts.

## Code Comments

- Code should be self-documenting first. Use comments only for the **why**, not the **what**.
- Never add comments that restate the code (`// increment counter` above `counter++`).
- Document non-obvious business rules, workarounds, performance trade-offs, and constraints.
- Reference the spec when implementing non-obvious contract requirements: `// Per spec: specs/api/openapi.yaml#/paths/users/post`.
- Use `TODO:`, `FIXME:`, `HACK:` prefixes for actionable items — include a ticket/name.
- Keep comments up to date. Stale comments are worse than no comments.

## Function/Method Documentation

- Document public APIs and exported functions with:
  - Brief description of purpose.
  - Parameter descriptions (types, constraints, defaults).
  - Return value description.
  - Exceptions/errors that can be thrown.
  - Reference to the spec contract this function implements.
- Skip docs for self-explanatory functions (`getName()`, `isValid()`).

## Project Documentation

- Every project needs a `README.md` with: purpose, setup, usage, spec overview.
- Document environment variables in a `.env.example` file.
- Keep an `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system-level design decisions, referencing specs.
- API documentation is auto-generated from `specs/api/openapi.yaml` — never hand-written.
- Data model documentation is auto-generated from `specs/schemas/` — never hand-written.

## ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

- Record significant technical decisions in short docs.
- Format: Context → Decision → Consequences → **Spec References**.
- Store in `specs/decisions/` (colocated with specs, not separate).
- Every ADR must reference the specs that drove or were affected by the decision.

## Documentation Anti-Patterns in SDD

- **Hand-Written API Docs**: if you have an OpenAPI spec, generate the docs. Don't duplicate.
- **Stale Docs**: docs that don't match the current spec. Auto-generation prevents this.
- **Docs Without Spec Reference**: documentation that doesn't link back to the authoritative spec.
- **Over-Documenting Code**: if the spec defines the contract, the code doesn't need to re-explain it.
- **Under-Documenting Specs**: specs with no descriptions, no examples, no context.

## Auto-Generation Tooling

| Source | Generated Doc | Tool |
|--------|--------------|------|
| OpenAPI spec | Interactive API docs | Swagger UI, Redoc, Stoplight |
| JSON Schema | Type/model reference | json-schema-docs, Docusaurus |
| Gherkin features | Living behavior docs | Cucumber reports, Pickles |
| TypeScript types | API reference | TypeDoc, TSDoc |
| ADRs | Decision log | adr-tools, Log4brains |
