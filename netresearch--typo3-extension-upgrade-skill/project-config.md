## Commands

No build system scripts defined in `composer.json`. This is a content-only skill repo.

Key skill commands (run in target extension, not this repo):
- `./vendor/bin/rector process --dry-run` -- Rector PHP migrations
- `./vendor/bin/fractor process --dry-run` -- Fractor non-PHP migrations
- `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` -- Static analysis
- `./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix` -- Code style fixes

## Rules

- **Scope**: Extension code upgrades only; NOT for TYPO3 project/core upgrades
- **Workflow**: Always complete planning phase before code changes (see `references/pre-upgrade.md`)
- **Caution**: Do NOT blindly apply Rector/Fractor for dual-version compatibility or untested extensions
- **Verification**: Always verify success criteria after upgrade (see `references/verification.md`)
- **Assets**: Config templates in `assets/` are starting points; adapt per extension
