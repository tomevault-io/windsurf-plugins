# Iterative Refactoring Approach

This rule outlines a methodical approach to refactoring code for improved reliability, maintainability, and readability.

## Core Principles

1. **Make incremental changes**: Refactor step by step, testing after each meaningful change.
2. **Preserve behavior**: Ensure refactoring doesn't alter the functionality of the code.
3. **Improve reliability**: Focus on making the code more robust against failures.
4. **Use meaningful commits**: Each commit should represent a specific improvement.
5. **Run related tests after each refactor**: Make sure to run tests and they pass before you commit. 
6. **Fix all type issues**: Fix type issues once you spot them.

## Refactoring Techniques

### 1. Method Extraction
- Extract repeated or complex logic into separate, well-named methods
- Aim for methods that do one thing and do it well
- Keep method signatures clear and consistent

### 2. Error Handling
- Catch errors at appropriate levels
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log detailed error context (IDs, timestamps, relevant state)
- Ensure clean resource cleanup in finally blocks
- Handle edge cases explicitly

### 3. Code Simplification
- Replace complex conditionals with simpler expressions
- Remove redundant code
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Extract helper methods for clarity

### 4. Atomic Updates
- Prefer atomic operations where possible
- Minimize the chance of leaving data in inconsistent states
- Use transactions or locking when necessary

### 5. Testing Approach
- Run tests after each significant change
- Don't proceed with further changes if tests are failing
- Add tests for edge cases discovered during refactoring

## Implementation Process

1. **Analyze**: Understand the code before changing it
2. **Plan**: Identify specific areas for improvement
3. **Refactor**: Make small, focused changes
4. **Test**: Verify behavior is preserved
5. **Commit**: Save the working state with descriptive messages
6. **Repeat**: Continue with the next improvement

## Example Refactorings

- Extracting validation logic
- Improving error handling and recovery
- Adding robust null/undefined checks
- Creating helper methods for repeated operations
- Enhancing logging for better debugging
- Simplifying complex conditional flows
