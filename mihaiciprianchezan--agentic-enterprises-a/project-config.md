# CLAUDE.md — Agent-Native Cell

Context for Claude Code (or any agent) picking up this repo. Read this first.

## What this is

One sovereign **cell** of the Agent-Native Enterprise model — the smallest complete unit
of the architecture, scoped around a **software-delivery workflow**: intake a feature/bug
request → produce a code change → verify it → hand the change back to the existing human
review/merge process. It is **not** a federation; one cell first, by design.

The full design lives in `docs/` and is the source of truth. Code must conform to it.

## Read the design before coding (in this order)

0. `docs/Anatomy-of-a-Run.md` — the operational overview: one ticket → verified PR, role by role. Start here for the big picture.
1. The model — https://github.com/MihaiCiprianChezan/Agentic-First-Enterprises (the canonical
   spec repo). The 11 design invariants in §1 are non-negotiable.
2. `docs/One-Cell-Build-Plan.md` — the build plan and milestone order (M0–M9).
3. `docs/Cell-Constitution.md` — the constitution this cell runs under (Articles 1–11).
4. `docs/Role-Contracts.md` — the seven role contracts (four operating + three system roles).
5. `docs/Handbrake-Interface.md` — the control plane (M4).
6. `docs/Build-Spec.md` — **the spec code is built against**: schemas (§1–2), trace/cost (§3),
   the idempotency wrapper (§4), and the governance rule set R1–R12 (§5).
7. `docs/Component-Selection.md` — capability → tool mapping; what's built vs. deferred.

## The invariants that constrain every line of code

- **#1** Depend on the contract, not the implementer. Bind to the Protocols in `cell/roles/contracts.py`.
- **#3** Every flow has a handbrake (pause/inspect/inject/resume/replay). Structural, not a feature.
- **#4** Side effects are safe to retry: exactly-once for reversible, **at-most-once** for irreversible.
  The outside world is never assumed idempotent. All effects go through `cell/effects/wrapper.py`.
- **#5** State lives outside the actor. Nothing durable in an agent's memory — it goes to the event plane.
- **#9** A human who takes over a Role is bound by that Role's authority, not their human Office.
- **#10** Governance is compiled from the constitution; agents never author their own rules.

## Build status: M0–M9 complete

The whole one-cell build plan is **implemented, reviewed, and merged** (the full suite is green).
All milestones are done:

- **M0** durable hash-chained event store + idempotent-action wrapper (exactly-once / at-most-once
  across a kill-and-resume — the acceptance tests in `tests/test_m0_idempotency.py` and the
  whole-cell gate in `tests/test_full_flow_kill_resume.py` pass).
- **M1** ratified constitution · **M2** role contracts · **M3** observability (trace + cost) ·
  **M4** the handbrake · **M5** governance compiled R1–R12 · **M6** autonomy graduation ·
  **M7** the Steward · **M8** the Optimizer (capability/cost routing) · **M9** the Auditor
  (Article 11 amendment + rate/report + the suspend-and-escalate breaker).
- Plus: the composition harness (`Cell.assemble`), the real CLI-agent runtime (`claude -p` in the
  Executor seat), the observability inspector (`python -m cell.observe`), cost-into-events (measured
  wall-clock + reported tokens), `start()` re-entry, and the version layer (`cell/versions.py`).

**Only optional federation / the supra-constitution remains** — and its precondition is a *second
cell*. Per invariant #8, it is not built until one exists.

> `docs/M0-Implementation-Notes.md` is retained as the historical M0 playbook.
