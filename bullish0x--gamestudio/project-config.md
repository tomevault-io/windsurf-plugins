# GameStudio Cursor Adapter

Follow `AGENTS.md` as the primary instruction file.

GameStudio is harness-neutral:

- Use `.agents/skills/` as the canonical skill source.
- Use `.agents/agents/` as the canonical role source.
- Use `.agents/hooks/` as the canonical lifecycle hook source for any external
  automation Cursor delegates to.
- Use `.agents/hooks.json` as the event-to-script registry for that automation.
- Use `.agents/rules/` as the canonical path-scoped standards source.
- Use `.claude/` and `.codex/` only as adapter examples for Claude Code and
  Codex-style harnesses.
- Keep model/provider selection in Cursor settings or an external gateway.
- Do not hardcode Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, GLM/Z.ai, Qwen, or local
  model choices into skills, agents, hooks, or project docs.

When the user invokes a slash-style skill such as `/start`, `/dev-story`, or
`/design-review`, open the matching `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` and follow
that workflow.

When editing files, apply the matching standards from `.agents/rules/`:

- `src/gameplay/**` -> `gameplay-code.md`
- `src/core/**` -> `engine-code.md`
- `src/ai/**` -> `ai-code.md`
- `src/networking/**` -> `network-code.md`
- `src/ui/**` -> `ui-code.md`
- `src/scenes/**` -> `scenes.md`
- `src/shaders/**` -> `shaders.md`
- `assets/data/**` -> `data-files.md`
- `assets/shaders/**` -> `shader-code.md`
- `assets/3d/**` -> `assets-3d.md`
- `design/gdd/**` -> `design-docs.md`
- `design/narrative/**` -> `narrative.md`
- `tests/**` -> `test-standards.md`
- `prototypes/**` -> `prototype-code.md`

Maintain the GameStudio collaboration protocol:

1. Ask focused questions.
2. Present options with trade-offs.
3. Let the user decide.
4. Draft or summarize the proposed change.
5. Ask explicit approval before writing files.

If a skill names `AskUserQuestion`, present the same options in chat when
Cursor has no structured question UI available. If a skill names `Task`, use
Cursor's agent/subagent feature when available or inline the referenced role's
instructions from `.agents/agents/`.

For provider routing or man-in-the-middle gateway setup, use
`docs/HARNESS-COMPATIBILITY.md` as the source of truth.
