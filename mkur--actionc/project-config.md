## Project context

This repository implements `actionc`, a modern compiler for the Action! language.
The `nir` module contains the Normalized Intermediate Representation. Treat
`nir` as the current code home for NIR hardening.

The long-term pipeline is:

```text
Action source -> AST -> semantic model -> SemIR -> NIR -> MIR6502 -> emission
```

## Architecture rules

- SemIR owns Action! meaning: name resolution, typing, lvalue legality, callable
  facts, array/routine disambiguation, record facts, pointer facts, and source
  control-flow meaning.
- NIR owns normalized typed computation: explicit blocks, temps, loads, stores,
  casts, compares, branches, calls, static data references, storage facts, and
  conservative effects.
- MIR6502 owns target strategy: byte/word expansion, 6502 addressing choices,
  zero-page decisions, A/X/Y/flags use, ABI placement, helper selection, and
  target-specific peepholes.
- Emission owns final instruction/data writing, labels, patching, maps, listings,
  and proof hooks.
- Do not make MIR6502 look back into SemIR to recover facts that should be in
  NIR.
- Do not put source-language semantic decisions into MIR6502 or emission.
- Do not add optimizer passes over legacy/stringly NIR forms.
- When removing or replacing a legacy NIR shape, tighten the verifier so the old
  shape cannot silently reappear.

## NIR Migration Rules

Verifier-clean NIR must eventually contain no executable:

- `NirOperand`;
- expression-summary strings;
- raw source strings;
- unresolved names;
- `Symbol(String)` storage identity;
- field names instead of byte offsets;
- index syntax strings;
- indirect callee target strings;
- metadata operations inside executable blocks;
- unknown/open control-flow boundaries;
- string labels as the long-term CFG identity.

Use stable IDs and fact tables for MIR-relevant entities whenever practical:

- routines;
- blocks;
- temps;
- params;
- locals;
- globals;
- statics;
- machine blocks;
- signatures.

Keep display names and source syntax only as debug/printing/source metadata, not
as executable semantics.

## Optimization rules

- Optimizer passes may run only after NIR verification.
- Every optimization pass must preserve verifier-clean NIR.
- Prefer small, obviously safe passes first: CFG cleanup, constant folding, copy
  propagation, branch simplification, unreachable block removal, and dead temp
  elimination.
- Be conservative around calls, absolute memory, OS/runtime calls, hardware
  registers, pointer dereferences, and machine blocks.
- Treat calls and machine blocks as ordering barriers unless structured effects
  prove a narrower behavior.
- Do not perform aggressive alias-sensitive optimization until storage identity,
  memory effects, and dominance/use-def validation are strong enough.

## Implementation discipline

- Make migrations as small vertical slices.
- Keep existing fixtures green unless the task explicitly updates the expected
  output.
- Preserve readable printed IR output when replacing internal string identities
  with stable IDs.
- Do not perform broad module renames unless explicitly requested.
- Do not mix unrelated cleanup, optimization, and emission changes in one patch.
- If a semantic behavior is unclear, document the uncertainty and prefer an
  explicit unsupported diagnostic over guessing.
- Do not add special cases for individual sample programs; add general compiler
  behavior with focused regression coverage.

## Required checks

After changing NIR, semantic lowering, verifier, printer, or related code,
run the relevant checks before submitting the change:

```sh
cargo test nir_fixtures_match_snapshots
cargo run --bin actionc-nir-sweep -- fixtures/nir
cargo test
```

When a task introduces NIR-specific fixtures or commands, also run their matching
checks, for example:

```sh
cargo test nir_fixtures_match_snapshots
cargo run --bin actionc-nir-sweep -- fixtures/nir
```

If a fixture changes, explain whether the change is an intentional IR contract
change, a printer-only change, or a bug fix.

## Documentation expectations

- Update the relevant design document when changing an IR boundary.
- Keep boundary documents focused on contracts and invariants, not implementation
  diary entries.
- Prefer documenting rejected legacy forms and verifier guarantees explicitly.
- When adding a new NIR form, document who owns it: SemIR, NIR, MIR6502, or
  emission.

## Review Checklist

Before considering a NIR migration patch complete, check:

- Does verifier-clean IR become stricter or at least no weaker?
- Did any executable path gain a new stringly or summary-based dependency?
- Can MIR6502 consume the new shape without consulting SemIR?
- Are calls, machine blocks, absolute memory, and pointer writes still handled
  conservatively?
- Are printed names still readable even if internal IDs changed?
- Are tests or fixtures updated for the specific behavior changed?
