# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents working in this repository.

## Project overview

This repository is a secure-by-default GitHub repository template for new projects.

It is intended to remain:

- container-first for build, test, lint, and release
- easy to adapt without weakening security, reproducibility, or review quality

## Project defaults

- Use TDD by default for new features, bug fixes, and behavior changes
  - However, write tests for **code** only, do not write tests for written content/filenames/directory structures, etc.

## Public interface

Use `make help` as the source of truth for available root targets. Prefer a small stable root `Makefile` interface, with this core set when supported by the repository:

```shell
make build
make test
make run
make stop
make status
make logs
make clean
make update
make example
```

Use `make scan` for template security and workflow checks, and `make dist` for release artifact and integrity outputs when those areas are affected. Use `make k8s` for the optional Kubernetes Helm scaffold and `make k8s-test-local` only when a real kubeconfig/context is available for server-side dry-run validation. Treat specialized targets such as `make shell`, `make renovate`, `make k8s`, `make k8s-test-local`, and `make infra` as task-specific conveniences rather than the core public interface.

Rules:

1. Keep the root public interface condensed and easy to remember.
2. Hide extra complexity behind `scripts/`, `config/project.cfg`, and compatibility targets when needed.

## Skill routing

Use a repo-local skill only when a matching skill actually exists in `.agents/skills/` and its description matches the task.

Typical routing:

- Use `repo-adaptation` when adapting this template or a forked repository to a real project, inspecting inserted `src/` code, or revising customization points.
- Use `workflow-validation` when changing `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `scripts/`, tests, packaging manifests, CI, or release workflows.
- Use `github-hardening` when updating GitHub-side hardening guidance or required repository settings.
- Use `terraform-hardening` when changing or reviewing the Terraform-backed GitHub repository hardening workspace under `config/infra`.
- Use `release-integrity` when working on SBOMs, attestations, artifact scanning, signing guidance, or release workflow safety.
- Use `language-profile-guidance` when adding or revising optional Go, Node.js, SQL, or polyglot guidance.
- Use `pr-draft-summary` when drafting a PR handoff after substantive repository changes.
- Use `security-review` only when the user explicitly invokes `$security-review`; do not select it by semantic matching.

If no matching skill exists, follow this file and the repository itself.

## Before making changes

- Read the relevant files before editing.
- Identify the affected workflow from the repository itself before choosing checks or commands.
- For complex, ambiguous, multi-step, or high-risk work, inspect the repository first, then make a short plan and ask clarifying questions only for unresolved intent or tradeoffs.
- If the task depends on tool versions, commands, flags, APIs, package versions, or installation steps, verify them against the latest official documentation before acting.
- Prefer targeted changes over broad rewrites.

## Repository rules

- `scripts/` contains implementation details for build, test, lint, release, and security checks.
- `config/project.cfg` is the main customization point.
- `Dockerfile` provides the development and CI runtime baseline.
- `.github/workflows/` should call `make` targets instead of duplicating project logic inline.
- `.agents/code_review.md` contains the detailed `/review` checklist; keep `AGENTS.md` focused on durable operating rules.
- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` contains task-specific agent workflows; keep skill routing in this file aligned with the actual local skills.
- `config/infra/` and `config/k8s/` have subtree `AGENTS.md` files with local hazards and verification rules.
- `docs/gitops-conventions.md` defines branch, PR, issue, label, commit, and release naming conventions.
- Keep template packaging and release manifests aligned.
- Follow the repository's existing structure, naming, and style.
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless necessary and justified.
- Preserve intended behavior unless the task explicitly requires a change.
- Preserve backwards compatibility unless the task explicitly allows a breaking change.
- Do not add broad error handling that hides failures.
- Prefer explicit error propagation or clear surfaced failures over silent fallbacks.
- When behavior changes, update or add the relevant tests.
- Keep secrets, tokens, and credentials out of code, logs, fixtures, examples, and documentation.

## Security and reproducibility

- Build, test, lint, and release through non-root Docker-based workflows unless the task explicitly requires a host-only action.
- Do not require host-installed language toolchains for normal use.
- Keep Dockerfiles deterministic and easy to audit.
- Prefer lockfiles, checksums, pinned versions, and pinned GitHub Actions where practical.
- Verify checksums or signatures for downloads when feasible.
- Keep generated artifacts and caches out of the Docker build context.
