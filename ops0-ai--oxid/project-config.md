# Repository Guidelines

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

Read [skills/bd-issue-tracking](.claude/skills/bd-issue-tracking/README.md)

**Check for ready work:**

Use filters to stay focused.

```bash
bd ready [--label ... ] [--limit 10]
```

**Create new issues:**


```bash
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 [--parent epic] [--design "hOW"] [--acceptance "WHAT success looks like" ]
bd create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123
```

**Claim and update:**
```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress
bd update bd-42 --priority 1
```


**Document information discovered during implementation:**
```bash
bd comments add bd-42 "zitadel/oidc requires key generation and key ID to sign"
```

**Complete work:**
```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed"
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`
6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:
- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow the existing conventional prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`) and keep messages imperative and under 72 characters. Reference related issues in the body and mention migrations, proto changes, or new binaries explicitly. PRs should include a concise summary, testing evidence (`make test-unit`, `make test-integration`, etc.), and screenshots or CLI transcripts when behavior changes. Request reviews from domain owners and ensure generated artifacts and docs stay in sync with code changes.
