## Task completion commits

After an authorized repository task is genuinely complete and relevant checks pass:

- Stage only the task-scoped changes.
- Create a Conventional Commit automatically without asking for additional permission.
- Do not commit incomplete work or changes with failing required checks.
- An explicit instruction not to commit overrides this default.
- Never push without explicit authorization.
