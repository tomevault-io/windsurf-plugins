# General Rules:
- Put all parameters and configuration variables that you think would be customizable in the [app_config.py](mdc:src/config/app_config.py) or another configuration module in the config folder, do not hard code them in the module you're working on or place them at the top of the module.
- Any changes to do with stored objects (in appdir or other permanent folder) should go through or use the 'services/storage/' folder modules or add to them. Centralize storage operations and only call them where needed, don't decentralize storage definitions and handling.
