# AGENTS.md — Project Instructions for AI Agents

## How to Start a Loop

See README.md → "Developing with the Loop" for the Report/Build mode
commands. Skills
live in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

## Project Purpose

A task management web application built with Next.js and developed
through loop engineering. Treat this as a real product codebase: the
backlog in BACKLOG.md defines what to build next, and every change goes
through the verifier pipeline. Whatever the product owner puts in
BACKLOG.md is the product — build that.

## Stack

```
Next.js 15 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript (strict)
Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui conventions (components.json is configured)
SQLite + Drizzle ORM (zero external services)
Vitest (unit) · Playwright (e2e, deterministic config)
```

## Commands

```bash
pnpm db:reset         # push schema + deterministic seed — run once after clone
pnpm e2e              # Playwright e2e (starts its own server, reseeds DB)
pnpm verify           # THE verification pipeline — same as CI
pnpm snap [routes]    # screenshot pages for visual inspection (dev server must run)
```

## Code Rules

### TypeScript
- `strict: true` and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` — never use `any`
  (the verifier rejects diffs containing `any`)
- Validate every external input (form data, search params) with Zod

### Next.js
- Server Components by default — add `"use client"` only where the
  component needs state, effects, or event handlers
- Mutations go through Server Actions in `actions.ts` files colocated with
  the route (see `src/app/tasks/actions.ts` for the reference pattern:
  auth check → Zod parse → ownership check → mutate → `revalidatePath`)
- Every route with async data gets `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx`
  (see `src/app/tasks/` for the reference implementation)
- Auth: call `getCurrentUser()` from `@/lib/auth` in server code.
  **Never edit `src/lib/auth.ts`** — it is denylisted.

### Database (Drizzle + SQLite)
- Schema: `src/db/schema.ts`. Always query through `db` from `@/db/client`
- Schema change flow: edit schema → `pnpm db:push` locally → note in the
  PR that a migration is needed. Schema changes always need human review
- Deletes are soft (`deletedAt`) — follow the pattern in `tasks`
- Never edit `src/db/seed.ts` randomness rules: seeds stay deterministic
  (fixed IDs, fixed dates), e2e depends on it

### UI Conventions
- Use the shadcn/ui primitives in `src/components/ui/` (Button, Input,
  Label, Card, Badge). Add new primitives in the same style, or via
  `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` (components.json is configured)
- Colors only through semantic tokens: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`,
  `text-muted-foreground`, `bg-primary`, `text-destructive`, `border-border`…
  Never hardcode colors (`bg-white`, `text-gray-500`, hex values)
- Spacing: Tailwind scale only, prefer `gap-*` over margins between siblings
- Every interactive element needs an accessible name (visible text,
  `aria-label`, or an associated `<label htmlFor>`)
- Shared components → `src/components/`; page-local pieces stay next to
  their route

### Tests
- Every feature and bug fix ships with tests:
  - Pure logic → unit test next to the module (`__tests__/*.test.ts`)
  - Rendering/props → component test (see `task-item.test.tsx`)
  - User-visible flows → e2e in `e2e/*.spec.ts`
- E2E selectors: prefer roles and labels (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`);
  `data-testid` only when semantics don't identify the element
- E2E must stay deterministic: rely on seeded data (`src/db/seed.ts`),
  never on ordering across test files, never on real time

### Visual Verification
After changing any UI, run the `$ui-verify` skill (or manually:
`pnpm snap /tasks` then Read the PNG) and inspect the result before
calling the verifier. You are expected to *look at* what you changed.

## Git Protocol

### Branch
Always branch off fresh main — never commit to main:
```bash
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only     # dirty tree or failed pull → stop, escalate in STATE.md
git checkout -b feature/F-XXX-short-name    # e.g. feature/F-101-dashboard
```

### Commit
```
feat(F-XXX): <what was done>                # e.g. feat(F-101): add dashboard summary
```

**No AI attribution — ever.** Commit messages and PR bodies must not
contain `Co-Authored-By` lines naming AI tools, "Generated with …"
footers, robot emojis, or any mention of the tool that wrote the code.
The message describes the change, not the author's tooling. Enforced in
CI by `scripts/check-commits.sh`.

### Opening a PR
Use `gh pr create`; the body must state which F-XXX it implements, paste the `pnpm verify` APPROVE summary line, and check off each acceptance criterion plus the visual check.

### Verification before any PR
1. Run `bash scripts/run-verifier.sh F-XXX` (this is `pnpm verify`)
2. It must end with `APPROVE`. On `REJECT`: fix, re-run — max 5 attempts
   (Max rejects, LOOP.md ## Limits), then escalate in STATE.md and stop
3. The verifier agent definition lives in `.claude/agents/loop-verifier.md`

## Loop Engineering Context

- **STATE.md / LOOP.md / BACKLOG.md** — loop memory, config (denylist
  and limits are single-sourced in LOOP.md), and backlog. Skills:
  loop-plan (Planner), loop-report (Report mode), loop-build (Build
