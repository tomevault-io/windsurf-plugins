# CLAUDE.md — AI Dev Operating System

This file defines how Claude Code and other AI coding agents should behave inside this repository.

The purpose of this repo is to provide a day-zero operating system for AI-assisted SaaS development: rules, agents, skills, commands, documentation layers, sprint system, changelog discipline, session logs, security gates, and prototype workflows.

---

## Golden rules

1. Do not code before context.
2. Use `START-HERE.md` and `WIZARD.md` for new projects.
3. Keep documentation layers separate.
4. Preserve decision memory in `session-log/`.
5. Human review is mandatory for BP v0.0.1 before BP v0.0.2.
6. Use multi-agent review when relevant.
7. No invented facts in market, competitor, legal, pricing, or regulatory claims.
8. Use separation of concerns and keep code files under 200 lines where practical.
9. Generated code files should include purpose/version/sprint headers.
10. Use stable dependencies by default; avoid alpha/beta unless explicitly accepted.

## Required generated artifacts for a new project

```txt
docs/product/PRODUCT-BRIEF.md
docs/business/BUSINESS-PLAN.md
docs/technical/TECHNICAL-PLAN.md
docs/SPRINTS.md
CHANGELOG.md
session-log/INDEX.md
session-log/YYYY-MM-DD-project-genesis.md
knowledge-base/README.md
prototype-lab/README.md
```

---

## Project Genesis Wizard

The canonical wizard is `WIZARD.md`.

Do not simplify it. Do not skip phases. Do not move to code before ideation, research, BP, human review, product brief, technical plan, sprint roadmap, and prototype lab are complete.
