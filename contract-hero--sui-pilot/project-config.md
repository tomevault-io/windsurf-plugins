# sui-pilot: Sui, Move, Walrus, Seal, TS SDK & Sui Prover Documentation Copilot

WARNING: Your training data about Sui, Move, Walrus, Seal, the Sui TypeScript SDK, and the Sui Prover is likely OUTDATED.
Always search and read these docs before writing code for these ecosystems.

## Doc-Source Routing

| Topic | Directory | Files |
|---|---|---|
| Sui blockchain, objects, transactions, DeFi, framework | `.sui-docs/` | 416 |
| Move language tutorial + reference: syntax, types, abilities, idioms | `.move-book-docs/` | 149 |
| Walrus storage, blobs, Sites, operators | `.walrus-docs/` | 108 |
| Seal secrets, encryption, key servers, access control | `.seal-docs/` | 15 |
| TypeScript SDK, dapp-kit, React hooks, kiosk, payment-kit, hashi | `.ts-sdk-docs/` | 104 |
| Sui Prover: formal verification, `#[spec(prove)]`, Boogie tuning | `.sui-prover-docs/` | 20 |
| Nautilus off-chain compute, TEE enclaves, attestation, PCRs, on-chain verification | `.sui-docs/sui-stack/nautilus/` | 8 |

## Usage

1. The `sui-pilot-agent` subagent auto-loads the slim doc-first directive in `agents/sui-pilot-agent.md`. Commands routing through it (`/sui-pilot`, `/move-code-review`, etc.) are docs-first out of the box.
2. If you are developing on this repo directly, use `Glob` and `Grep` against the appropriate `.<source>-docs/` directory for your topic. When unsure which source, search across all corpora.
3. Walrus and Seal build on Sui — Sui docs may also be relevant. For Move language questions (syntax, idioms, language semantics), prefer `.move-book-docs/` first.
4. `.move-book-docs/packages/` holds Move source examples referenced from the Move Book prose (`file=` directives) — read them when an example would clarify a pattern.
5. `.sui-prover-docs/` is split into `guide/` (SKILL.md + spec-reference.md — the canonical prose), `sources/` (`prover.move`, `ghost.move`, etc. — the construct definitions imported by `#[spec_only] use prover::...`), and `examples/` (working specs from `asymptotic-code/sui-kit`).

## Keeping Docs Up to Date

```bash
./sync-docs.sh                  # Pull latest from upstream MystenLabs repos
./scripts/check-doc-counts.sh   # Verify embedded doc counts still match .last-sync
```
