## PDSF skills

The PDSF skills are installed under `.agents/skills/`. Invoke any of them as `/<skill>` (e.g.
`/build-factory`) — your harness loads the skill's markdown into context on demand. This block is
managed by the installer; `/build-factory` refines it with the method constants and the workflow map.

Git flow — every instance must know it:

@.agents/skills/git-flow/SKILL.md

**Next step: run `/build-factory`** to wire this project's backlogs, triage, and domain.
