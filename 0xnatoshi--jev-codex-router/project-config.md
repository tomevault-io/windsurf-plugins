# AGENTS.md — autonomous install & operations playbook

This file lets a coding agent (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, …) install, verify
and operate the **Jev Codex Router** on a user's machine without asking for
context it can discover itself. Follow it top to bottom. Do not skip the
verification step after each stage — they are what makes autonomy safe here.

## What you are installing

A local server plus a Codex Router extension that adds one model to the Codex
picker — **"Jev Codex Router"** (`jev/auto`). Every turn sent to it is classified by
[Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai) (TypeSafe System One) and served by the
cheapest model that can handle it, at a thinking depth adapted to the task.
All traffic stays on loopback; the design is fail-open; there is a kill switch.

## Hard rules (never violate)

1. **Never print, log, commit, or transmit secrets** — the TypeSafe API key,
   the router `caller-secret`, or ChatGPT tokens. Reference them by file path.
2. **Never edit router-owned files**: `litellm.yaml` under the router's state
   directory, anything under `<router checkout>/src/`, or the
   `codex-router-managed` blocks of `~/.codex/config.toml`. The router
   regenerates or oversees them; edit only through its CLI and documented
   state files (`user-models.json`, `generic-providers.json` via CLI).
3. The server binds `127.0.0.1` only. Never expose it on another interface.
4. If `launchctl` is restricted in your environment (supervised agents often),
   skip the service install — use the watchdog pattern and let the user run
   `server/install-service.sh` from their own Terminal instead. Never fight
   the restriction.
5. Treat prompt excerpts in local logs (`jev-router-live.jsonl`,
   `shadow-log.jsonl`) as private user data: read locally, never republish.

## Prerequisites (check, and report what you found)

- **macOS** with **Codex** and a **Codex Router installation** (the local router
  that serves native GPT models to Codex on `127.0.0.1:4202`).
  Check: `<router checkout>/bin/codex-router status` → expect
  `{"state":"running"}`; `./bin/codex-router providers generic list` must exist.
- **Python ≥ 3.11** — `python3 -V`.
- A **TypeSafe API key** for Jev. The server looks for `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in
  `~/.hermes/.env` first, then `~/.jev.env`, then the process environment.
  If none exists, **stop and ask the user where their key file is — never ask
  for the key value itself in chat.**

## Install, step by step

### 1 — Start the server

```bash
cd <repo>
python3 server/jev_server.py &            # long-lived; launchd service in step 6
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4319/health      # expect: {"ok": true, "service": "jev-router"}
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4319/v1/models   # expect: one model, id "auto"
```

### 2 — Declare the model

Create `~/.codex/codex-router/user-models.json` (hand-editable state file; if
it already has `models`, append to the array instead of overwriting):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "models": [
    {
      "slug": "jev/auto",
      "gatewayModel": "jev-auto",
      "compHash": "jev-auto-user-v1",
      "upstreamModel": "auto",
      "provider": "jev",
      "listed": true,
      "displayName": "Jev Codex Router",
      "description": "Auto-routing by Jev (TypeSafe): every turn is classified and served by luna, sol or astra at the thinking depth it needs.",
      "priority": 95,
      "defaultEffort": "medium",
      "reasoningLevels": [
        {"effort": "low", "description": "Quick reasoning"},
        {"effort": "medium", "description": "Balanced reasoning"},
        {"effort": "high", "description": "Deep reasoning"},
        {"effort": "xhigh", "description": "Extended reasoning"},
        {"effort": "max", "description": "Maximum reasoning"}
      ],
      "contextWindow": 258400,
      "autoCompact": 219640,
      "inputModalities": ["text", "image"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3 — Register the generic provider (router CLI)

```bash
cd <router checkout>
./bin/codex-router providers generic add jev --name "Jev Router" \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:4319/v1 --adapter openai-responses --allow-private
./bin/codex-router providers generic list
# expect:  SHOW jev   Jev Router (openai-responses)
```

### 4 — Share native ChatGPT access with local clients

```bash
./bin/codex-router chatgpt-session enable
# expect: "enabled for this user's local Codex Router clients (session valid
# for about NNNh)". Re-run this when native calls later return Unauthorized.
```

### 5 — Publish and show

```bash
./bin/codex-router refresh-catalog        # merged catalog must now contain "jev/auto"
./bin/control picker set jev/auto show    # returns the picker JSON with jev/auto visible
```

### 6 — Persistent service (optional)

Ask the user to run, in **their own Terminal**:

```bash
bash <repo>/server/install-service.sh     # launchd service, keep-alive, logs in ~/Library/Logs
```

Alternative (any scheduler, every 5 min): `<repo>/server/watchdog.sh` —
silent when healthy, restarts the server when down.

### 7 — Restart Codex

Fully quit and reopen the Codex app so it reloads the picker catalog, then the
user can select **Jev Codex Router**.

## End-to-end verification (must pass before declaring success)

```bash
SEC=$(cat ~/.codex/codex-router/caller-secret | tr -d '\n')
