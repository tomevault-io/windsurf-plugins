# inmojomni — project rules for Claude sessions

Bare-metal RP2040 firmware + SDK in pure Mojo. Public repo, actively promoted:
**every public claim must have a machine-checked gate** (test, checksum, or
diff). If you add a capability, add its gate in the same change; if you can't
gate it, don't claim it. Global rules: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

## Policy

- **Tracks the LATEST Mojo nightly.** Early in a session run `pixi update`,
  fix breakage, bump lower bounds in pixi.toml to the tested nightly. The
  scheduled CI job `nightly-latest` (ignores lockfile) is the canary — red
  canary is priority zero.
- Docs: README/BENCHMARKS = English, rigorous, no hype adjectives.
  docs/ROADMAP.md = internal, zh-TW. Never mention "pico-drone" or
  "pico-mojo" in public docs (user directive; project name is inmojomni).
- Tooling language: new tools are Mojo (`tools/*.mojo`). Python exists only
  as test rig (run_tests.py, hil.py, dap_client.py) — don't grow it.
- Commit/push: user has authorized push to THIS repo. Commit messages end
  with the Claude co-author line. CI must be green before you call a push done.

## Commands (all via pixi; `pixi run <task>`)

| build / flash / uf2 / build-debug / flash-debug | firmware via tools/build.mojo |
| test | full suite; hardware stages auto-skip without probe |
| test-host | host-only tier — minimum bar for ANY change |
| bench → chart | 4-language benchmark (needs probe+clang+rustc) → docs/assets/benchmarks.svg |
| sizes | 4-language blink size comparison (no hardware) |
| svd-update | refresh .vscode/rp2040.svd from pinned pico-sdk |

Output filters are mandatory — canonical recipes live in
`~/.claude/playbooks/00-diagnosis.md` §1. The `/summary/,$p` sed trick works
ONLY for `test`/`test-host` (they print `=== summary ===`); for builds use
`| grep -cE "error"` first, rerun filtered only on nonzero.

## Hardware facts (this user's bench)

- One Pico + one Pico 2 + one CMSIS-DAP Debug Probe. **The probe is a
  mutex** — never let two agents/commands use SWD concurrently, including
  background polls (openocd gdb-server counts: kill it when done).
- RP2350 flash/debug go through ~/.local/bin/openocd (raspberrypi fork;
  Ubuntu's 0.12 lacks rp2350 targets). Flash: `pixi run flash-rp2350`.
  Debug gate: `pixi run debug-test-rp2350`. probe-rs still cannot attach
  to a running Hazard3. Consult wren6991/hazard3 repo for core facts
  (user directive; see memory).
- SWD wiring is marginal: tools already flash at `--speed 1000 --verify` with
  one retry (hil.py / hil.mojo). Don't remove these. Unverified flashes have
  silently corrupted and produced phantom bugs (cost: a full bisect session).
- If SWD dies (reads fail, "device not responding"): try 1 MHz + verify; if
  USB enumeration is gone (error -71 in dmesg), software cannot recover —
  ask the user to replug the probe (and possibly reseat the 3 SWD wires).
- Never poll SWD while a timing run executes: each probe-rs attach steals
  ~6 ms of AHB from the core. Sleep past the run, then read.
- RAM survives reset: zero mailboxes/counters before reading them (stale
  benchmark residue has masqueraded as results).
- Leave the board running blink at session end (`pixi run flash`).

## Mojo nightly gotchas (all verified on hardware/IR; keep list updated)

- `_ = read32(addr)` **discards the volatile load in the elaborator** — it
  never reaches LLVM. Route the value into a compare whose branch has a side
  effect (pattern in src/pico/multicore.mojo `_fifo_drain`).
- `len(myString)` is a compile error → `s.byte_length()`; slice `s[byte=a:b]`.
- Bare int literals may not compare with UInt32 on newer nightlies — write
  `UInt32(10) > x`, not `10 > x` (packaging builds resolve the NEWEST nightly,
  not the lockfile, so this breaks there first).
- `comptime VALUE = f()` materialization requires the type to be
  `Copyable, ImplicitlyCopyable, Movable` (see `Asm` in src/pico/pio.mojo).
- No module-level `var` (globals unsupported); no regex/json/socket in stdlib;
  `std.subprocess.run` goes through a shell, captures stdout, does NOT raise
  on nonzero exit — use the `; echo __RC$?` marker pattern (tools/build.mojo `sh`).
- `import` paths: `std.ffi.external_call` (not std.sys.ffi). When unsure,
  probe-compile a 6-liner before writing real code.

## Recipes

**Add an on-target test:** bump `NUM_TESTS` in tests/on_target/main.mojo →
write `def test_x() -> Bool` → add `report(idx, test_x())` in start() →
append name to `TEST_NAMES` in tools/hil.py → update README test-count →
`pixi run test` with probe. Scratch RAM for test state: 0x20024000+ (document
each address in the test file).

**Add a retarget rule (nightly broke the build):** reproduce with
`pixi run build` → add a string-scan rule in tools/retarget.mojo → add a
synthetic-IR case to tests/host/test_retarget.mojo → `pixi run test-host`.
Volatile-op preservation is checked automatically; never weaken it.

**Add a driver:** registers into src/pico/rp2040.mojo (datasheet § in comment)
→ module in src/pico/x.mojo (docstring with usage example) → export in
__init__.mojo → on-target test → README SDK section + tests table.

**Verify like the project does:** parity gates (md5 the ELF before/after a
tooling refactor), goldens (runtime/boot2.bin), spread gates (bench <2%),
checksums across implementations. Copy these patterns, don't invent weaker ones.
