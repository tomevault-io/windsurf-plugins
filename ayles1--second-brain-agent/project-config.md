# Second Brain Agent contributor instructions

- Keep the public project free of personal notes, identifiers, credentials,
  databases, OAuth files, Telegram sessions, backups, and absolute local paths.
- Configuration must be environment-based and documented in `.env.example`.
- Preserve the single-user Telegram allowlist.
- Run `pytest` and `python -m compileall -q src` after code changes.
- Do not weaken the export scanner to make a failing export pass.
