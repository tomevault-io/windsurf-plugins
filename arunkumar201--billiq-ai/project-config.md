# ChatDocs AI and Custom Chatbot AI: Scalable Architecture

## Vision
Build a scalable, decoupled architecture that powers document-based AI chatbots (chatDocs) with the flexibility to extend into custom chatbot implementations. The platform will leverage modern cloud infrastructure, asynchronous processing, and LLM capabilities to deliver high-performance AI conversations tailored to specific use cases.

## Core Objectives

1. **Build a Decoupled Architecture**: Implement highly independent services with clear boundaries and communication protocols
2. **Enable Multi-Model Support**: Create abstractions to support multiple LLM providers beyond just OpenAI
3. **Ensure Horizontal Scalability**: Design systems that can scale with increased load through distributed processing
4. **Implement MCP Server Architecture**: Develop Message Control Protocol servers for custom chatbot scenarios
5. **Establish Monorepo Structure**: Organize code efficiently while maintaining modularity
6. **Create Reliable CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate testing, deployment, and quality assurance
7. **Implement Progressive Rollouts**: Use feature flags for controlled feature deployment

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### Frontend Layer
- **Next.js Application**: Server-side rendering with client components where needed
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets/SSE for live chat interactions
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile-first approach with modern UI frameworks

#### API Gateway Layer
- **REST/GraphQL Endpoints**: For standard CRUD operations
- **WebSocket Server**: For real-time bidirectional communication
- **Authentication Middleware**: Using Better-auth for secure access

#### Service Layer
- **Document Processing Service**: Handles document ingestion, chunking, and vector embeddings
- **Chat Service**: Manages conversations, context windows, and prompt engineering
- **MCP Server Framework**: For custom chatbot implementations
- **Analytics Service**: Tracks usage patterns and performance metrics

#### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database for structured data
- **MongoDB**: For flexible schema requirements
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for semantic search
- **Redis**: For caching and session management

#### Queue System
- **BullMQ**: For asynchronous task processing
- **Kafka**: For real-time analytics and event streaming

#### Infrastructure
- **AWS S3**: Document storage
- **AWS EC2**: Compute resources
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployments
- **Stripe**: Payment processing and subscription management

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & chatDocs MVP
- Set up monorepo structure and CI/CD pipeline
- Implement core document processing workflow
- Develop basic chat interface with OpenAI integration
- Establish data persistence layer with Prisma

### Phase 2: Scalability & Performance
- Implement asynchronous processing with BullMQ
- Add vector storage with Pinecone
- Design and implement caching strategy
- Set up monitoring and alerting

### Phase 3: MCP Server Architecture
- Develop MCP server framework
- Create client-side SDK for MCP integration
- Implement sample custom chatbot use cases
- Document API specifications

### Phase 4: Multi-Model Support & Analytics
- Add support for alternative LLM providers
- Implement analytics pipeline with Kafka
- Create dashboards for usage insights
- Optimize for cost and performance

## Key Performance Indicators

- **Scalability**: Ability to handle 1000+ concurrent users
- **Latency**: Chat response time under 1 second
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for critical services
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize resource usage for minimal AWS spend
- **Developer Experience**: Streamlined workflow for adding new features

## Technology Choices

| Category | Technology | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Frontend | Next.js | Server components for better performance, modern React patterns |
| Authentication | Better-auth | Secure, flexible authentication with minimal configuration |
| Database | Prisma + PostgreSQL | Type-safe ORM with relational data model |
| Vector Database | Pinecone | Optimized for embeddings retrieval at scale |
| Queue | BullMQ | Redis-based queue system with monitoring and retry capabilities |
| Analytics | Kafka | High-throughput event streaming for real-time analytics |
| AI | OpenAI (extensible) | Industry-leading models with plans to support alternatives |
| Infrastructure | AWS, Docker | Cloud-native approach with containerization |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Integrated with code repository, extensive marketplace |

## Development Practices

- **Code Quality**: Enforce linting, testing, and code review processes
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive technical and API documentation
- **Feature Flags**: Use for progressive rollouts and A/B testing
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and performance tracking
- **Security**: Regular security audits and dependency vulnerability scanning
