# Bun + Elysia + Drizzle + Postgres rules

## Stack assumptions

- Runtime: **Bun** (do not propose Node-only APIs without checking Bun support)
- HTTP: **Elysia** plugins, one per feature module
- DB: **PostgreSQL** via **Drizzle ORM** (`drizzle-orm/bun-sql`)
- Dashboard (if any): server-rendered Elysia JSX (`@elysiajs/html` + `@kitajs/html`)
- Migrations: `drizzle-kit` (`db:generate` / `db:push` / `db:migrate`)

## Project layout (do not deviate)

```
src/
  index.ts                 ← Elysia app + plugin registration + lifecycle
  config.ts                ← Env reads + runtime validation; throws at import
  db/
    index.ts               ← Drizzle DB connection
    schema.ts              ← Re-exports all model schemas
  middleware/              ← Auth, rate-limit, CORS
  utils/                   ← Tiny pure helpers shared by 3+ modules
  modules/<feature>/
    <feature>.plugin.ts    ← Elysia plugin (route group)
    services/              ← Business logic — sole DB access point
    dtos/                  ← Elysia t.Object validation
    models/                ← Drizzle pgTable schemas
    serializations/        ← Response mappers
    types/                 ← Module-local types
  pages/                   ← Server-rendered dashboard (if applicable)
test/
  unit/                    ← Pure logic; no DB
  e2e/                     ← Plugin-level integration tests with mocked services
docs/
  api.md, <module>.md      ← Per-module + global API docs
ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, SECURITY.md
```

**Never introduce new top-level folders under `src/` except** `modules/`, `db/`, `utils/`, `middleware/`, `pages/`. Do not create new top-level dirs at the repo root without justification (`scripts/`, `docs/` are fine; ad-hoc dumps are not).

## TypeScript rules

- **No `any`.** Use generics, type narrowing, or `unknown` + a guard.
- **No unsafe casts** like `value as SomeType`. Refactor to make the type flow naturally.
- Prefer `as const` arrays + `(typeof X)[number]` for env-validated unions (e.g. `LogLevel`).
- Public service / route function signatures must have explicit return types.

## Elysia rules

- One `Elysia` plugin per feature, exported from `<feature>.plugin.ts`. Compose them in `src/index.ts` via `.use()`.
- Set `normalize: true` on every plugin so `/api/v1/foo` and `/api/v1/foo/` both work.
- Validate request body / params / query with `t.Object({...})` from Elysia's `t`.
- **Do not write business logic or DB calls inside route handlers.** Handlers parse → call a service → serialize → return. If the handler is more than ~10 lines, the service is missing logic.
- Use `onBeforeHandle` for auth / rate-limit guards; use `resolve` to add per-request context (e.g. `apiKeyId`). Cache cross-hook lookups via a `WeakMap<Request, T>` rather than re-querying.
- Use `set.status` + a returned object to short-circuit, not `throw new Response(...)`.

## DTO rules

- File name: `<action>-<entity>.dto.ts` (e.g. `send-email.dto.ts`).
- Cap every string field with `maxLength`. Unbounded strings are a memory + abuse vector.
- Don't import DTOs across modules.

## Service rules

- Services are the **only** layer that talks to the DB.
- Write functions, not classes, unless you genuinely need state.
- Each service function has an explicit return type. Errors are thrown; the global `onError` formats them.
- Read methods filter `deleted_at IS NULL` by default when soft-delete exists. Trash methods explicitly target `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`.

## Database rules

- Schemas in `models/<entity>.schema.ts`, named `<entityPlural>` (e.g. `emails`, `inboundEmails`).
- Always declare indexes for the queries your service runs (filter, sort, paginate).
- Foreign keys must specify `onDelete` explicitly: `"set null"`, `"cascade"`, or document why default is acceptable.
- For mutable user data, prefer **soft delete** (`deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL` + index) plus a periodic purge service.
- `db:push` is for local dev only. Production uses generated migration SQL.

## Logging rules

- Use the structured logger in `src/utils/logger.ts`. **Never `console.log` in committed code.**
- `LOG_LEVEL` must be validated against the union (`"debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error"`) at config load — fail loud on bad input.
- Logs are JSON. Don't log full request/response bodies — log identifiers only. Be careful with PII in `to`/`from` fields (consider an `LOG_REDACT_PII` env flag in production).

## Test rules

- `test/unit/` — pure functions. No DB, no framework. Bun test runner: `import { describe, test, expect } from "bun:test"`.
- `test/e2e/` — Elysia plugin-level. Mock services at the module boundary with `mock.module(...)`.
- **Mock leakage is real.** When you `mock.module()` a service file, that mock can persist into the next test file when run as a single process. Two defenses:
  1. CI runs unit and e2e as **separate** Bun processes: `bun test test/unit && bun test test/e2e`.
  2. When mocking a shared service module, include **all** of its exports as `mock(() => ...)` even if your test doesn't use them — otherwise downstream tests in the suite lose those exports.
- Don't pin Bun to `latest` in CI — pin a specific version (e.g. `1.3.10`) so test ordering stays deterministic.
