# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Communication Style

- **Always plan before coding**: Use EnterPlanMode for any non-trivial task. Present the plan, explain trade-offs, and get approval before writing code.
- **Explain the "why" before each edit**: Before making any code change, state the goal — what problem it solves and why this approach. The user is a senior JS/TS developer (5+ years) who wants to collaborate and co-decide.
- **Keep the user in the loop**: Share potential impacts, edge cases, and alternatives. Don't make silent assumptions.
- **No `any` types**: Use proper TypeScript types. Avoid unsafe casts (`as SomeType`) — prefer type narrowing, generics, or extending interfaces.

## Project Overview

BunMail is a self-hosted email API for developers — a free alternative to SendGrid/Resend. REST API for sending transactional emails with direct SMTP delivery, DKIM/SPF/DMARC signing, email queue with retries, templates, and a web dashboard.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Backend:** Elysia
- **SMTP Sending:** Nodemailer (direct mode, no provider)
- **SMTP Receiving:** smtp-server
- **Email Auth:** DKIM signing, SPF/DMARC DNS verification
- **Database:** SQLite (default) or PostgreSQL
- **Queue:** Custom with retries (3 attempts)
- **Dashboard:** React or Svelte frontend
- **Deploy:** Docker

## Development Commands

```bash
bun install                # install dependencies
bun run dev                # start dev server
bun test                   # run all tests
bun test <file>            # run a single test file
bun run build              # build for production
bunx tsc --noEmit          # type-check without emitting
docker compose up          # run full stack with Docker
```

## Architecture

```
Elysia API (routes/) → Services (services/) → Database (db/)
                            ↓
                       Queue (retries) → SMTP Send (Nodemailer + DKIM)
                                             ↓
                                       Webhooks fired on delivery/bounce
```

- **Routes** (`src/routes/`) — REST API endpoints under `/api/v1/`. Auth via Bearer API key.
- **Services** (`src/services/`) — Core business logic: mailer, DKIM signing, email queue, DNS verification, webhook dispatch.
- **Middleware** (`src/middleware/`) — API key authentication and rate limiting.
- **Database** (`src/db/`) — Schema, migrations, and connection setup.
- **Dashboard** (`dashboard/`) — Separate frontend app for managing emails, templates, domains, and API keys.

## Code Conventions

### General

- Use module-per-feature under `src/modules/<feature>/` when organizing domain logic.
- Keep route handlers thin; put business logic in services.
- Use kebab-case for filenames; PascalCase for classes; camelCase for methods/variables.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase — match the style of surrounding code.
- Keep changes minimal and focused — don't refactor unrelated code.

### Module Layout

Each feature module follows this pattern:
```
src/modules/<feature>/
  ├── <feature>.plugin.ts     ← Elysia plugin (route group)
  ├── services/               ← Business logic
  ├── dtos/                   ← Request/response validation schemas (Elysia t.Object)
  ├── models/                 ← Database schemas
  ├── serializations/         ← Response mappers/serializers
  └── types/                  ← Shared types for this module only
```

- Never introduce new top-level folders under `src/` except: `modules/`, `db/`, `utils/`, `email-templates/`.

### Elysia Specifics

- Define route groups as Elysia plugins (`.use()` pattern) — one plugin per feature module.
- Use Elysia's built-in validation with `t.Object()` schemas for request body/params/query.
- Use Elysia's `onBeforeHandle` for guards and middleware (auth, rate limiting).
- Route handlers call services. No DB or cross-cutting logic in route handlers.
- Route prefix: the module's feature name in kebab-case (e.g., `api-keys` → `/api/v1/api-keys`).

### DTOs and Serialization

- Place validation schemas in the module's `dtos/` directory. File names: `<action>-<entity>.dto.ts`.
- Responses should be mapped via `serializations/` when shaping output or hiding internals.
- Do not import DTOs or serializers across modules; keep them feature-local.

### Database

- Define schemas in `models/` with file name: `<entity>.schema.ts`.
- Only services may access the database — never from route handlers directly.

### Error Handling

- Throw Elysia-compatible errors from services and let Elysia's error handler format responses.
- Do not return raw errors or stack traces from route handlers.

### Email

- Email templates live under `src/email-templates/`. Place email send logic in `src/services/mailer.ts`. Do not send mail from route handlers directly.

### Tests

- Place unit tests alongside source or under `test/unit/` matching the module structure.
- New endpoints must include or update tests for both route and service logic.

### Cross-Module Types

- Keep types local in `src/modules/<feature>/types/`. Promote to a shared place only if used across 3+ modules.
