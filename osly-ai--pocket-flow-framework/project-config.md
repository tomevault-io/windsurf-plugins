# Agent

For many tasks, we need agents that take dynamic and recursive actions based on the inputs they receive.
You can create these agents as **Nodes** connected by *Actions* in a directed graph using [Flow](./flow.md).

### Example: Search Agent

This agent:
1. Decides whether to search or answer.
2. If it decides to search, loops back to decide if more searches are needed.
3. Finally answers once enough context has been gathered.

```typescript
import { BaseNode, Flow, DEFAULT_ACTION } from "../src/pocket";

// Placeholder for an LLM call
async function callLLM(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
  // Example function to call a Large Language Model
  // Return a YAML-like string (or any structured string) in practice
  return `
\`\`\`yaml
action: "search"
reason: "Need more results"
search_term: "Nobel Prize 2024"
\`\`\`
`;
}

// Placeholder for a web search
async function searchWeb(searchTerm: string): Promise<string> {
  // Example function that interacts with an external API
  return `Search Results for: ${searchTerm}`;
}

export class DecideAction extends BaseNode {
  // The 'prep' method extracts data from sharedState to pass into execCore
  public async prep(sharedState: any): Promise<[string, string]> {
    const context = sharedState.context ?? "No previous search";
    const query = sharedState.query;
    return [query, context];
  }

  // The main logic calls callLLM to decide whether to search again or to answer
  public async execCore(inputs: [string, string]): Promise<any> {
    const [query, context] = inputs;
    const prompt = `
Given input: ${query}
Previous search results: ${context}
Should I: 1) Search web for more info 2) Answer with current knowledge
Output in YAML:
\`\`\`yaml
action: search/answer
reason: Explanation
search_term: search phrase if action is search
\`\`\`
    `;

    const resp = await callLLM(prompt);

    // Parse YAML from resp (this is example logic; you'd use a real YAML parser)
    const yamlStr = resp.split("```yaml")[1]?.split("```")[0]?.trim() || "";
    // Assume the structure is { action, reason, search_term? }
    const parsed = { action: "search", reason: "Need more results", search_term: "Nobel Prize 2024" };
    // In a real scenario, you'd do something like:
    // const parsed = yaml.load(yamlStr); // using js-yaml or similar

    if (parsed.action === "search" && !parsed.search_term) {
      throw new Error("Missing search_term for 'search' action!");
    }

    return parsed;
  }

  public async post(prepResult: [string, string], execResult: any, sharedState: any): Promise<string> {
    if (execResult.action === "search") {
      sharedState.search_term = execResult.search_term;
    }
    return execResult.action;
  }
}

export class SearchWebNode extends BaseNode {
  public async prep(sharedState: any): Promise<string> {
    return sharedState.search_term;
  }

  public async execCore(searchTerm: string): Promise<string> {
    return await searchWeb(searchTerm);
  }

  public async post(prepResult: string, execResult: string, sharedState: any): Promise<string> {
    const previous = sharedState.context || [];
    sharedState.context = [...previous, { term: prepResult, result: execResult }];

    // Loop back to the DecideAction node
    return "decide";
  }
}

export class DirectAnswer extends BaseNode {
  public async prep(sharedState: any): Promise<[string, any]> {
    return [sharedState.query, sharedState.context ?? ""];
  }

  public async execCore(inputs: [string, any]): Promise<string> {
    const [query, context] = inputs;
    const prompt = `Context: ${JSON.stringify(context)}\nAnswer this query: ${query}`;
    return await callLLM(prompt);
  }

  public async post(
    prepResult: [string, any],
    execResult: string,
    sharedState: any
  ): Promise<string> {
    console.log("Answer:", execResult);
    sharedState.answer = execResult;
    return DEFAULT_ACTION; // or any string that indicates the flow is done
  }
}

// Connect nodes
const decide = new DecideAction();
const search = new SearchWebNode();
const answer = new DirectAnswer();

decide.addSuccessor(search, "search");
decide.addSuccessor(answer, "answer");
search.addSuccessor(decide, "decide");  // loop back

const flow = new Flow(decide);
flow.run({ query: "Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics 2024?" });
```

In this TypeScript example:

- **DecideAction** checks the shared state, queries an LLM, and sets the next action to either “search” or “answer.”
- **SearchWebNode** performs a web search and appends the result to `sharedState.context`, then loops back to the decision node.
- **DirectAnswer** produces a final answer when enough context has been gathered.

**Notes:**

- **YAML Parsing:** In the `execCore` method of `DecideAction`, replace the placeholder parsing logic with a proper YAML parser like [`js-yaml`](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) to handle the YAML response from `callLLM`.

  ```typescript
  import yaml from 'js-yaml';

  // Inside execCore
  const parsed = yaml.load(yamlStr) as { action: string; reason: string; search_term?: string };
  ```
