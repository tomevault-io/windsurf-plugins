Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working on **oink**.

## What is oink

**oink — gamebooks for e-ink.** A librogame (gamebook) engine for e-ink
devices, written in Rust. The first target is the M5Paper (ESP32 + 960x540
16-level grayscale e-ink + touch); more e-ink hardware, iOS, and Android come
later. The name is a pun: **oink** (pig, the mascot) / **Ink** (the narrative
language) / **e-ink** (the display). Stylized forms like "o·ink" may appear in
branding only — the canonical name for repo, crates, and binaries is `oink`.

## Core design decisions

These were deliberate choices. Do not revisit them without a strong reason.

1. **Ink for narrative, YAML for data.**
   - Story, scenes, branching, choices, skill-check flow: **Ink**
     (`assets/story/*.ink`).
   - Item definitions, perks, engine config (dice rules, starting stats,
     starting inventory): **YAML** (`assets/data/*.yaml`).
   - Ink references data by ID; rich item/perk structure never lives in Ink
     (Ink has no structs). Runtime state (inventory, HP) lives in the engine
     and is exposed to Ink via external functions.

2. **Rust, not Go, not Arduino/C++.**
   - Go/TinyGo has immature Xtensa/ESP32 support — rejected.
   - Target the `std` route via **esp-idf** (`esp-idf-hal`/`esp-idf-svc`) so
     `serde_yaml`, heap, threads, and FS work on device. Toolchain: `espup`.

3. **No emulator; display abstraction instead.**
   - There is no M5Paper emulator. All rendering goes through
     `embedded-graphics`'s `DrawTarget` trait.
   - Desktop dev uses `embedded-graphics-simulator` (SDL2). On device the
     target is the IT8951 e-ink driver (`it8951` crate). Same engine and UI
     code, two mains behind crates.
   - The engine core is a plain Rust crate, unit-testable with `cargo test` —
     faster iteration than any emulator.

4. **Ink runtime: `bladeink` (2.x).**
   - Pure-Rust port of inkle's reference runtime; full language support
     (threads, flows, external functions, choice tags, save/load state).
   - Compiled with `bladeink-compiler`: at startup in the simulator
     (`Engine::new`), at build time for firmware (`Engine::from_json` loads
     precompiled `.ink.json`).
   - Replaced `inkling` (0.12, unmaintained since 2020, no external
     functions/tags). Keep engine code runtime-agnostic where cheap.

5. **Not published to crates.io.** This is an application (firmware +
   simulator), not a library. The crate name `oink` is taken on crates.io
   (pig latin crate) — irrelevant since we distribute via git/releases/flash.
   If the core is ever extracted as a library, publish as `oink-engine` or
   similar, not `oink`.

```

## Engine API (oink-core)

- `GameData::from_yaml(config, items, perks)` — parse the three YAML docs.
- `Engine::new(ink_source, data)` — compile ink, load story; seeds
  `inventory` from `config.starting_inventory`.
- `Engine::from_json(story_json, data)` — load precompiled `.ink.json`
  (build-time compile path for firmware).
- `Engine::start() -> Result<Event, EngineError>` /
  `Engine::choose(index) -> Result<Event, EngineError>`.
- `Event::Scene { text, choices }` — prose paragraphs + choices to render.
- `Event::TheEnd { text }` — story over. House flavor: the death/ending screen
  references the classic librogame line *"La tua vita e la tua missione
  terminano qui"* (Lupo Solitario). Fighting Fantasy trivia: those books had
  400 paragraphs, paragraph 400 = victory.
- `EngineError::{Compile, Story}` — runtime-agnostic error type (no `bladeink`
  types leak into the public API).

## Presentation modes: the tag contract

Ink is UI-agnostic; it emits text + tags and the engine interprets them.
oink defines its own tag vocabulary (this is OUR scene format — keep this
section updated as the single source of truth):

| Tag | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `# mode: prose` | knot | default full-text gamebook rendering |
| `# mode: dialog` | knot | portrait/name dialog layout |
| `# mode: map` | knot | choices render as tappable map locations |
| `# speaker: <id>` | line | character speaking (id defined in YAML) |
| `# mood: <id>` | line | portrait variant |
| `# portrait: <id>` | line | explicit portrait override |
| `# map: <id>` | knot | which map layout (defined in YAML) |
