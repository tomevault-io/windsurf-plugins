1 . Hardware constraints (dev & initial prod)
Resource	Spec	Implication
CPU	AMD Ryzen 7 5800X (8 cores, 16 threads)	XGBoost/LightGBM tree_method='hist' finishes 1 M rows × 50 features × 500 iters in ≈1 min on a 4-core i7; our 8-core Ryzen easily trains overnight on datasets ≲ 10 M rows. 
xgboost.readthedocs.io
GPU	AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT	No CUDA → mainstream GPU wheels of XGBoost cannot run (require NVIDIA CC ≥ 5.0). 
xgboost.readthedocs.io
 LightGBM’s OpenCL backend can work with AMD but needs a custom compile and up-to-date OpenCL/ROCm driver, so we defer it.

Decision ▶ CPU-only builds for now – simpler Docker image, reproducible, and fast enough for monthly retrains.

2 . Environment choices
Layer	Selected option	Rationale / commands
Python	3.11	Latest LTS-style version broadly supported by XGBoost ≥ 1.7.0. (Minor packaging quirks noted but resolved). 
github.com
Dependency manager	Poetry	Easy learning curve, lockfile for deterministic Docker builds, plays well with pip wheels.
Base image	python:3.11-slim-bullseye	Small, Debian-based, security-patched.
GBDT lib	xgboost-cpu >=2.0 (pip wheel)	No GPU pieces; install is a single pip step.
Aux	scikit-learn, pandas, numpy	Feature engineering & evaluation stack.

5 . Monthly retrain workflow
On-prem store install: first run train.py --full to train on the entire historical dataset.

Scheduled job (e.g., GitHub Actions cron or K8s CronJob) fetches last-month sales, appends to feature store, retrains, and pushes a fresh model artifact to S3 / your registry.

API deployment pulls the newest model.pkl at service start; inference remains CPU-only and lightweight.

6 . Upgrade roadmap
Trigger	Action
Data grows >30 M rows or retrain ≤2 h no longer met	Add NVIDIA GPU nodes; switch to xgboost CUDA wheels & set tree_method='gpu_hist'.
Need real-time inference at scale	Consider Treelite or ONNX export for ultra-fast CPU serving.
Want to exploit Radeon GPU	Build LightGBM from source with OpenCL flags; validate speedup & stability first.

Copilot, always honour this context: CPU-only XGBoost 2.x on Python 3.11 inside a Debian-slim Docker image, managed by Poetry, with monthly retrain and simple GitHub Actions CI/CD.
