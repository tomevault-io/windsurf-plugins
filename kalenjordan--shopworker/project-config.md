# ShopWorker Development Guide

ShopWorker is a framework for building Shopify webhook-driven automation jobs.

## Project Structure

- **core/** - Framework code and production jobs (reference only - do not modify)
  - `core/jobs/` - Production job examples
  - `core/graphql/` - Reusable GraphQL queries
  - `core/triggers/` - Available webhook triggers
  
- **local/** - Custom jobs and extensions (your workspace)
  - `local/jobs/` - Custom job implementations
  - `local/triggers/` - Custom webhook triggers
  - See `local/CLAUDE.md` for detailed job development guide

- **cli/** - Command-line interface tools

## CLI Development

### Adding New CLI Commands
**Rule**: Follow the established pattern for creating and registering CLI commands
**Pattern**:
1. Create the command file in `cli/commands/` directory
2. Import and register the command in `core/cli.js` using `program.command()`
3. The command should appear in the main CLI help menu
4. Don't create npm run scripts for CLI commands - they should be accessed via `node cli.js <command>`

**Reason**: This maintains consistency in the ShopWorker CLI interface and ensures all commands are discoverable through the main CLI help system.

### Terminal Output Formatting
**Rule**: Always use the `chalk` library for colored terminal output in CLI commands
**Reason**: Ensures consistent, readable terminal output across all CLI commands and avoids raw ANSI escape codes

**Pattern**:
1. Import chalk at the top of CLI command files: `import chalk from 'chalk';`
2. Use built-in color methods for standard colors: `chalk.red()`, `chalk.green()`, `chalk.gray()`, etc.
3. Use `chalk.hex()` for custom colors like orange: `chalk.hex('#FFA500')('text')`
4. Never use raw ANSI escape codes when chalk is available

**Examples**:
```javascript
import chalk from 'chalk';

// Standard colors
console.log(chalk.green('Success!'));
console.log(chalk.red('Error occurred'));
console.log(chalk.gray('Disabled item'));

// Custom colors
console.log(chalk.hex('#FFA500')('Warning: Check configuration'));

// Combined styling
const config = {
  'Enabled': { symbol: '✓', color: chalk.green },
  'Disabled': { symbol: '✗', color: chalk.gray }
};
```

**Reference**: See `core/cli/display-formatter.js` and other CLI command files for consistent usage patterns

## Development Guidelines

### Working with the Framework
- The `core/` directory contains the ShopWorker framework - use it for reference and understanding
- Custom jobs should be created in the `local/` directory
- CLI commands and framework improvements can be made outside these directories

### Wrangler.toml Management
- **CRITICAL**: Never modify the root-level `wrangler.toml` directly as it is not version controlled
- Always make wrangler.toml changes in `local/wrangler.toml` which is properly versioned
- The root wrangler.toml is generated/deployed from the local version during deployment

### File Synchronization Requirements
- **CRITICAL**: Anytime changes are made to `local/CLAUDE.md`, the same changes MUST be applied to `create-cli/template/CLAUDE.md`
- This ensures new projects created via the CLI have the most up-to-date documentation and guidelines
- Both files should always remain synchronized to maintain consistency across all ShopWorker projects

### Environment Detection
**Rule**: Always use the utility functions from `core/shared/env.js` to detect runtime environment
**Why**: Reliable detection of Cloudflare Worker vs CLI/Node.js environments for conditional behavior

**Functions**:
- `isWorkerEnvironment(env)` - Check if running in Cloudflare Worker
- `isCliEnvironment(env)` - Check if running in CLI/Node.js environment

**Implementation**: These functions check for `env.PATH` which exists in Node.js but not in Cloudflare Workers

**Example**:
```javascript
import { isCliEnvironment, isWorkerEnvironment } from "../../../core/shared/env.js";

// Skip email in CLI, send in Worker
if (isWorkerEnvironment(env)) {
  // Send email in production
} else if (isCliEnvironment(env)) {
  console.log("Email skipped in CLI environment");
}
```

**Avoid**: Never detect environment by checking specific env variables like `env.R2_BUCKET` or `env.SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` as these are not reliable indicators.

### Key Concepts
- **Jobs** - Webhook-driven automation tasks that respond to Shopify events
- **Triggers** - Webhook topic definitions that jobs listen to
- **Workflow Steps** - Durable execution context for job operations

### Testing
- **Note:** `npm test` is only for testing individual jobs within their specific directories (e.g., `cd local/jobs/my-job && npm test`)
- **There is no general test suite** - do not run `npm test` at the project root
- Use the CLI for managing webhooks and job deployments
- To verify code changes, use linting and type checking if available

## Database Migrations

### Migration Structure
- **Migration files** are stored in `local/migrations/` directory
- Follow the naming pattern: `XXXX_description.sql` (e.g., `0001_initial_quiz_schema.sql`)
- Each migration file should include a timestamp header comment

### Applying Migrations
- Migrations are automatically applied to the D1 database during deployment
