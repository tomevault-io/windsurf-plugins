# Mainframe

AI-native development environment for orchestrating agents.

# Workflow

- Before any new bug/feature work, pull latest main and start a new branch on it
- Before any work, check needed skills to guide your development see [Skills](#skills)
- For Claude CLI behavior, use the `claude-source-researcher` skill (reads the CLI source directly). Protocol docs are in `docs/adapters/claude/`: [PROTOCOL_REVERSED](docs/adapters/claude/PROTOCOL_REVERSED.md), [COMPACTION](docs/adapters/claude/COMPACTION.md), [INTERRUPT](docs/adapters/claude/INTERRUPT.md), [CONTEXT_USAGE](docs/adapters/claude/CONTEXT_USAGE.md), [MODELS](docs/adapters/claude/MODELS.md), [TODOS](docs/adapters/claude/TODOS.md), [PR_TRACKING](docs/adapters/claude/PR_TRACKING.md)
- Be sure to typecheck when you're done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- For git workflow and commit practices, see [Git](#git)

## Tech Stack

- Language: TypeScript (strict mode, NodeNext modules) + Rust (Tauri shell, `packages/app-tauri/src-tauri`)
- Runtime: Node.js 22+ (daemon); Tauri 2 + Electron desktop shells
- Package Manager: pnpm workspaces (+ Cargo for the Rust shell)
- Database: SQLite (better-sqlite3)
- UI: React + Tailwind v4 in `packages/ui`, shared by the Tauri and Electron shells

## Commands

- `pnpm install` — Install dependencies
- `pnpm build` — Build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @qlan-ro/mainframe-types build` — Rebuild shared types after changing them
- `pnpm --filter @qlan-ro/mainframe-ui test` — Test a specific package
- `pnpm --filter @qlan-ro/mainframe-ui exec vitest run <file>` — Single test file (preferred; large multi-suite runs hit cross-file `React.act` failures)
- `pnpm --filter @qlan-ro/mainframe-ui typecheck` — Typecheck the UI. Core/types have no `typecheck` script; use `pnpm --filter @qlan-ro/mainframe-core exec tsc --noEmit`
- `pnpm dev:desktop` — Dev stack: core daemon + Vite + Electron
- `pnpm tauri:dev` (from `packages/app-tauri`) — Tauri dev app; run in background with output to a log file
- `cargo check` (from `packages/app-tauri/src-tauri`) — Fast Rust validation
- `pnpm test:e2e` — Playwright E2E suite
- `pnpm changeset` — Required before committing (see [Git](#git))

## Architecture

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design.

- **Monorepo Structure**: pnpm workspaces with seven packages:
    - `@qlan-ro/mainframe-types`: Shared TypeScript interfaces and domain models.
    - `@qlan-ro/mainframe-core`: The background Daemon (Node.js). Process management, session lifecycle, metadata storage.
    - `@qlan-ro/mainframe-ui`: The shared React renderer, consumed by both desktop shells.
    - `@qlan-ro/mainframe-app-tauri`: Tauri 2 desktop shell (Rust in `src-tauri/`). Ships the daemon as a bundled Node sidecar.
    - `@qlan-ro/mainframe-app-electron`: Electron desktop shell (legacy, being replaced by app-tauri).
    - `@qlan-ro/mainframe-e2e`: Playwright end-to-end suite.
    - `@qlan-ro/mainframe-mobile`: Git submodule (separate repo — cross-cutting changes need their own PR there; don't bump the pointer in feature PRs).
- **Metadata Storage**: SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) for project tracking and chat metadata. Message history is NOT duplicated; CLI agents replay it via `--resume`.

## Terminology

**AgentAdapter** = a CLI tool integration (Claude, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode) the daemon spawns as a child process — interface in `packages/types/src/adapter.ts`. **Agent/Subagent** = a task worker spawned _within_ a session by the AI (the left-panel "Agents" tab), not a CLI adapter.

## Skills

Invoke the listed skill **before** taking the described action. No exceptions.

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| Any bug, error, or unexpected behavior — even when the cause looks obvious | `systematic-debugging` |
| Building a new feature, adding functionality, or changing behavior | `brainstorming` |
| Multi-step implementation task, or after brainstorming approval | `writing-plans` |
| Writing implementation code for any feature or bugfix | `test-driven-development` |
| About to claim work is done, commit, or open a PR | `verification-before-completion` |
| Building UI components, pages, or making visual design decisions | `ui-ux-pro-max` |
| Writing docs, commits, PRs, error messages, or UI copy | `writing-clearly-and-concisely` |

Domain skills (typescript-expert, nodejs-best-practices, vercel-react-best-practices, senior-architect, code-audit) are preloaded by the roster agents in `~/.claude/agents/` — delegate to core-dev/ui-dev/planner/test-writer/quality-reviewer instead of invoking them inline.

## Git

- **Never commit to `main`.** Always work on a feature or fix branch. Run `git branch --show-current` before any commit or reset to confirm you are not on `main`.
- **Check branch before destructive git ops.** Before `reset`, `rebase`, or `push --force`, verify the current branch with `git status` or `git branch`.
- **Never discard unstaged changes you didn't create.** They may be in-progress work from another session. When committing, stage only your own files by name. Do not `git checkout --`, `git restore`, or `git stash` other people's changes.
