# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Setoku is a self-hosted MCP server between Claude and a company's data — curated context plus a governed read-only query path into ClickHouse (the lake plus the `biz.*` business-DB mirror; the gateway holds no direct business-Postgres credential); no LLM runs on the server (I8). See the README for the product picture.

This repo is the **dev/test harness**. The installable plugin lives in `./plugin` (its own `package.json`, deps installed on the box by a `SessionStart` hook). Root `package.json` (`setoku-dev`) drives development, build, and deploy.

Runtime is **Bun** throughout (`bun:sqlite`, `Bun.hash`, etc.) — not Node. TypeScript is type-checked but never emitted (`tsc --noEmit`); Bun runs `.ts`/`.tsx` directly.

## Commands

```bash
bun install                  # deps (root); plugin deps are separate (plugin/package.json)
bun run typecheck            # tsc --noEmit — the only "build" for the gateway
bun test                     # fast suite: test/ + ingest/ (~4s) — ingest/ needs a local Postgres
bun test test/http.test.ts   # a single test file
bun run test:e2e             # browser e2e (e2e/) — slower, needs Chrome; run before deploys
bun run setup:hooks          # install the pre-push hook (gates pushes on the fast suite)

# Admin SPA (React, served by the gateway at /admin)
bun run dev:admin            # local dev server for the admin app
bun run build:admin          # rebuild app.css (Tailwind) + dist/app.js (committed artifacts)

# Marketing site (static, site/ — served by Caddy at setoku.com, NOT by the gateway)
bun run build:site           # regenerate site/openapi.json + site/api/*.json (committed artifacts)

bun run deploy               # rsync this checkout to a box + rebuild the server container
bun run deploy:site          # rsync site/ to the box (runs build:site first, then verifies)
```

The fast suite's gateway tests run against a fake in-process lake (`test/lib/fakelake.ts`); only the `ingest/` tests (pg-mirror) need a reachable Postgres (defaults to a unix socket in `/tmp`; override with `SETOKU_E2E_PG_HOST`, `SETOKU_E2E_DB_URL`, `SETOKU_E2E_PG_MAINTENANCE_DB`). Real-ClickHouse suites gate on `SETOKU_E2E_CH_URL`. The browser e2e is deliberately **not** in the pre-push gate.

The admin CSS/JS bundles in `plugin/gateway/web/{app.css,dist/app.js}` are **committed build artifacts** served at startup — re-run `bun run build:admin` and commit them after changing `web/app/` or `web/input.css`.

`site/openapi.json` and `site/api/*.json` are **committed build artifacts** too: `scripts/build-site-api.ts` derives them from the plugin manifest (version), `gateway/app.ts` (the tool surface and its capability gating), and `ingest/schemas/` (connectors), so the published spec can't drift from the shipped product. Re-run `bun run build:site` and commit after changing the tool surface or adding a connector; `test/site-api.test.ts` fails the pre-push gate if you forget. The site's Caddy block lives at `deploy/caddy.d/setoku-com.caddy` — changing *content* just needs `deploy:site`, but changing that *block* needs a caddy force-recreate on the box.

## Architecture

Everything runs as one `docker compose` on one VPS (single-tenant, I6). Only Caddy (HTTPS edge) faces the internet; Postgres and ClickHouse are never exposed (I1).

**`plugin/gateway/` — the MCP server.**
- `app.ts` — `buildServer()` registers the tool surface. Context tools (`find_context`, `list_entities`, `describe_entity`, `get_metric`), the propose path (`report_correction`, `list_corrections`), curated-write tools (`upsert_context`, `resolve_correction` — registered only when `canWrite`), and data tools (`list_sources`, `get_schema`, `run_query`). `find_context` is documented as "always call FIRST."
- `http.ts` — the deployed entry point. Streamable-HTTP MCP transport with bearer-token auth; **a fresh stateless `McpServer` per request**, identity bound from the token. Also serves the `/admin` React SPA + its session-cookie JSON API (`/admin/api/*`), the `/healthz` aggregate, and the `/i/<token>` one-line installer. Shared state lives in the SQLite store, not the server instance.
- `lib/store.ts` — `KnowledgeStore`, the owned SQLite DB (docs, corrections, append-only revisions + audit log, accounts/sessions). Lives **outside the repo** by default (`~/.setoku/projects/<slug>/knowledge.db`); `.setoku/context/` files seed it once.
- `lib/config.ts` — loads `.setoku/config.json` from the *business* repo, resolves DB/lake URLs from env-var **names** (the credential never reaches the model), enforces the table allow/deny list.
- `lib/db.ts` / `lib/lake.ts` — the shared read-statement gate and the ClickHouse query execution (the gateway's only query engine; the direct Postgres read path is retired — business tables are read via the `biz.*` mirror).
- `admin-cli.ts` — bootstraps the first admin account on the box (no authenticated channel exists yet).

**Two identities, one membrane (I2/I9) — the load-bearing security design.**
