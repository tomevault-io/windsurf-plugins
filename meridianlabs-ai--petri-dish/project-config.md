## Principles

- Shortcuts become someone else's problem; hacks compound into debt
- Patterns get copied—establish good ones
- Flag issues; ask before fixing
- Strict typing required
  - Python: modern syntax (`X | None`, `dict[str, Any]`)
- Error handling: do not use Exceptions gratuitously, unless an error is expected in a context and needs to be computed on it should be allowed to propagate.
- Respect existing patterns
- Before committing, run the appropriate checks for code you touched (lint, typecheck, test)

### Testing
- Test observable behavior, not internal implementation details
- Do not test things that are enforced by the type system
- Test through the narrowest public API that covers the behavior
- Be efficient; avoid duplicate coverage
- Prefer data/table driven tests for maintainability
- Tests must be isolated; no shared mutable state or order dependencies
- Tests must be deterministic; control randomness with seeds
- Prefer real objects over mocks when possible

### Common Pitfalls
- Stay within scope—don't make unrequested changes
- During development, run only implicated tests; run the full suite when the work is complete

## Pull Requests

- Title PRs as Conventional Commits (`<type>: <description>`)—we squash-merge, so the PR title becomes the commit message that drives releases; `pr-title-lint` enforces it
- `feat:`/`fix:` are for user-facing changes only: they headline the release notes and bump the version. `perf:`/`revert:` also appear in the notes (no bump); `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `style:` are hidden
- Body lines starting with `<type>:` are parsed as extra changelog entries—don't begin description lines with a conventional-commit prefix unless that's intended
- Never edit `CHANGELOG.md`, version numbers, or `.release-please-manifest.json`—Release Please owns them
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full guidelines

## Python

Directory: `src/petri_dish/`

### Scripts
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make check` | Run all checks (lint, format, typecheck) |
| `make typecheck` | Run typechecking only |
| `make test` | Run all tests |
| `pytest` | Run all tests |
| `pytest tests/path/to/test.py::test_name -v` | Run single test |
| `ruff format` | Format code |
| `ruff check --fix` | Lint and auto-fix |

### Style
- **Formatting**: Follow Google style convention. Use ruff for formatting
- **Imports**: Use isort order (enforced by ruff)
- **Types**: All functions must have type annotations, including in tests.
- **Naming**: Use snake_case for variables, functions, methods; PascalCase for classes
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings required for public APIs. Use single backtick (`) around symbols. Do not use hard line breaks within paragraphs or list items — each paragraph should be a single unwrapped line, separated by blank lines.
- **Error Handling**: Use appropriate exception types; include context in error messages
- **Testing**: Write tests with pytest; maintain high coverage

### Common Pitfalls
- Use the venv for all Python commands: either reference `.venv/bin/` directly or run `source .venv/bin/activate`

## Architecture

Dish is a thin layer on petri. It reuses petri's `Channel`/`Controller`/`TargetContext`, auditor agent, most auditor tools, and `audit_solver`. All auditor↔target communication goes through petri's `TargetContext` methods — dish adds no extra channels.

Key components:
- `dish_target` / `_DishTarget` — target agent that drives an ACP scaffold (replaces petri's `model.generate` target). A fresh `_DishTarget` is constructed per trajectory; its `_drive` method relays user messages and its `_filter` method is installed as the scaffold's `GenerateFilter`.
- `REWRITE` slot + `ScaffoldInjectionNotification` — dish's extension of petri's `Slot`/`Response` protocol for scaffold-injection rewriting.
- `auditor_execute` — bridged MCP tool; the filter wraps native tool calls into it so the auditor can supply simulated results via `TOOL_RESULT` staging.
- Dish-specific `resume` and `rewrite_scaffold_injection` auditor tools — handle `ScaffoldInjectionNotification` responses.
