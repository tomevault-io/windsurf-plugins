## How to commit

- Stage only relevant files.
- Prepare a commit message with:
  - A short headline.
  - A longer paragraph describing the change.
  - A co-author line for Codex: `Co-authored-by: Codex <codex@openai.com>`.

## Testing preferences

- When patching in tests, prefer `unittest.mock.patch` decorators.
- Prefer patch decorators over patch context managers.
- Prefer patch decorators over pytest `monkeypatch` unless there is a specific need.
