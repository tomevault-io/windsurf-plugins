# FEN Project Context

## Project Overview

FEN is an AI-powered Insurance Deck Builder that transforms insurance plan PDFs into dynamic Slidev presentations with synchronized narration. The system uses LangGraph orchestration, GPT-5 for content analysis, and OpenAI TTS for audio generation.

## Critical Workflow Principles

### Deck Synchronization (CRITICAL)

**The most important rule**: `slides.md` and `audio_script.md` must be perfectly synchronized.

**Formula**: `Total Script Paragraphs = 1 (title paragraph) + N (number of v-clicks)`

- Paragraph 1 always addresses the slide title/headline (v-click 0)
- Paragraphs 2+ each correspond to one v-click in sequence
- Always run `node scripts/deckSyncCounter.js <DECK_ID>` before audio/video generation
- Content alignment: Script paragraphs should describe what appears or gets highlighted on slides at each click
- Tables appearing on click 1 need a paragraph describing the table structure

**Never proceed with audio or video generation if sync check fails.**

### Deck Duplication Workflow

When creating a new deck from an existing one:

1. **Copy the entire template deck folder** (the template deck will be specified in instructions - may be MVP or another deck)
2. **Update all references systematically**:
   - Deck ID in `slides.md` frontmatter (`id:` field)
   - Deck ID in `<SlideAudio deckKey="">` component
   - Deck ID in `audio/config.json` (`deckId` field)
   - Plan sponsor, plan type, network/association info
   - All plan-specific content (benefits, limitations, etc.)
3. **Maintain the template deck's structure**:
   - Keep slide layouts and formatting
   - Preserve click timing structure
   - Maintain table structures
   - Keep audio config click counts (update deck ID only)
4. **Update audio script**:
   - Replace all content with new plan information
   - Maintain paragraph structure matching slide clicks
   - Keep section headers format: `---- Section Name ----`
5. **Verify synchronization**:
   - Run sync check before any export operations
   - Fix any mismatches immediately

### Export Workflow Structure

The complete export workflow consists of 5 main steps:

1. **Google Docs Sync** (`scripts/google-docs-api.js`)
   - Creates/updates Google Docs for script and slides
   - Auto-creates 3-level folder structure: `FirstEnroll || Videos` → `Product Videos` → `<DECK_ID>`
   - Time: ~15-40 seconds | Cost: $0

2. **PDF Export** (`scripts/export-steps/03-export-pdf.js`)
   - Exports slides to PDF using Slidev
   - Auto-versions output (e.g., `FEN_PXH_001.pdf`)
   - Time: ~30-60 seconds | Cost: $0

3. **PDF Upload** (`scripts/upload-to-drive.js`)
   - Uploads PDF to Google Drive folder
   - Time: ~5-10 seconds | Cost: $0

4. **Audio Generation** (`scripts/export-steps/04-generate-audio.js`)
   - Sanitizes script (replaces "comprehensive" → "extensive")
   - Checks slide/script synchronization (aborts if misaligned)
   - Deletes old audio files
   - Generates new audio via OpenAI TTS API
   - Time: ~2-5 minutes | Cost: ⚠️ OpenAI TTS API credits (~$0.30-0.60 per deck)

5. **Video Export** (`scripts/export-steps/05-export-video.js`)
   - Checks slide/script sync (aborts if misaligned)
   - Starts Slidev server on port 3030
   - Records presentation with Playwright
   - Encodes as MP4 with audio sync
   - **Requires manual screen sharing** (Chrome tab with audio)
   - Time: ~15-25 minutes | Cost: $0

6. **Video Upload** (`scripts/upload-to-drive.js`)
   - Uploads video to Google Drive folder
   - Time: ~30-120 seconds | Cost: $0

### Content Alignment Principles

When writing or updating audio scripts:

- **First paragraph** always introduces the slide topic naturally
- **Subsequent paragraphs** match the visual progression of v-clicks
- **Table descriptions**: When a table appears on click 1, include a paragraph describing what the table shows
- **Bold highlighting**: Script should describe what gets bolded at each click
- **Natural flow**: Sentences can flow between paragraphs - mid-sentence slide changes are natural
- **Numbers**: Always spell out numbers (e.g., "three hundred" not "300")
- **Acronyms**: Most acronyms spelled with spaces (A M L, D O I), except HIPAA has no spaces

### Script Sanitization

**Automatic word replacement** happens before audio generation:
- `comprehensive` → `extensive` (preserves casing)
- `Comprehensive` → `Extensive`
- `COMPREHENSIVE` → `EXTENSIVE`

**Never use "comprehensive"** in any context (slides, audio scripts, or documentation).

### Video Export Requirements

- **Port 3030** must be available (script checks and kills existing processes)
- **Manual screen sharing** required:
  1. Press F to enter Slidev fullscreen
  2. Select "Chrome Tab" in screen picker
  3. Check "Share tab audio"
  4. Click Share
- **Fullscreen browser window** recommended for proper recording dimensions
- Video export will abort if sync check fails

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Mismatched click counts**: Always verify sync before audio/video generation
2. **Content misalignment**: Script paragraphs must describe what's visible at each click
