# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

All root scripts delegate to `app/`:

```bash
npm run dev          # start dev server (Vite)
npm run build        # typecheck + build + asset size check
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run test         # vitest watch mode
npm --prefix app run test:run   # run tests once (CI mode)
```

To run a single test file:
```bash
cd app && npx vitest run src/utils/units.test.ts
```

The build also runs `scripts/check-pages-asset-sizes.mjs` against `app/dist/` to enforce Cloudflare Pages asset size limits.

## Architecture

### Project layout

- `app/` — the entire frontend (React 19 + TypeScript + Vite). All active development happens here.
- `functions/api/contact.js` — single Cloudflare Pages Function for feedback submissions.
- `wrangler.toml` — Cloudflare Pages config.

### State management (`app/src/store/`)

Global state is a single Zustand store with Immer middleware, composed from slice creators in `store/slices/`:

| Slice | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `tracksSlice` | `GPXTrack[]`, active track, comparison tracks |
| `playbackSlice` | playback state (`isPlaying`, `progress`, `currentTime`, `speed`, timing mode) |
| `journeySlice` | `Journey` with ordered `JourneySegment[]` (track or transport segments) |
| `mediaSlice` | `PictureAnnotation[]`, pending placements, text annotations, icon changes |
| `settingsSlice` | `AppSettings` (map style, units, camera, trail style, video export, social share) |
| `uiSlice` | sidebar open, active panel, loading/error state, explore mode |

All slices share a single `AppState` type from `store/storeTypes.ts`. Each slice creator is typed as `AppSliceCreator<T>` (defined in `store/slices/types.ts`).

### Data model

The core data flow: GPX/KML files → `GPXTrack[]` → `Journey` (ordered segments) → `ComputedJourney` (flattened coordinates with timing).

Key types in `app/src/types/index.ts`:
- `GPXPoint` — lat/lon/elevation/time/HR/cadence/power/speed/distance
- `GPXTrack` — parsed track with aggregate stats and bounds
- `JourneySegment` — either a `TrackSegment` (references a `GPXTrack` by id) or a `TransportSegment` (interpolated connector)
- `ComputedJourney` — flattened `JourneyPoint[]` with segment timings, computed by `useComputedJourney` hook via `journeyUtils.buildComputedJourney()`

### Map rendering (`app/src/components/map/`)

`TrailMap.tsx` is the main map component, built on MapLibre GL. It delegates logic to focused hooks in `map/hooks/`:
- `useMapInitialization` — creates the MapLibre map instance
- `useTrailLayerData` — manages GeoJSON sources and trail/marker layers
- `useTrailPlaybackCamera` — drives camera position during playback (overview / follow / follow-behind modes)
- `usePictureMarkers` — photo pin markers
- `useTextAnnotationsLayer` — text annotation overlays
- `useComparisonTrackLayers` — renders comparison track lines
- `useManualPicturePlacement` — handles click-to-place photo flow
- `useTilePreload` — prefetches map tiles ahead of playback

The map ref is exposed via `app/src/utils/mapRef.ts` for access outside the component tree (used during video export).

**Before changing how the replay camera moves, read `app/src/components/map/CAMERA.md`.** It covers the camera's invariants (the marker must stay framed, live preview and export must stay identical, behaviour must not depend on route length), how to measure the camera per frame instead of eyeballing it, and the traps that make browser measurements silently wrong.

### Playback engine (`app/src/components/playback/`)

`PlaybackProvider` drives the animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame`. It reads the current `playback` state from the store and calls `setPlayback` each frame. The stats overlay (`StatsOverlay`) computes live stats from the `useComputedJourney` hook at the current progress position.

### Video export

Video export is orchestrated from the Export panel in the sidebar (`components/sidebar/ExportPanel.tsx`). It captures the MapLibre canvas frame-by-frame and muxes video using `mp4-muxer` (MP4) or the MediaRecorder API (WebM). Social share image export uses `html2canvas` on a dedicated offscreen poster element in `components/sidebar/export/`.

Photos and clips both pause the timeline and are encoded as a hold. A photo's hold advances `exportPictureHoldElapsedMs`; a clip's advances `exportVideoHoldTimeSeconds`, and the popup *seeks* to that point rather than playing, because a playing clip would run far ahead of an encoder that takes longer than real time per frame. `html2canvas` cannot rasterize a `<video>` (or an `object-fit: contain` `<img>`), so both are drawn onto the overlay canvas by hand in `useExportOverlayCapture.ts`.

### GPX/KML parsing (`app/src/utils/gpx/`)

Parsing is split across dedicated modules:
- `parseGpxDocument.ts` — GPX XML → raw points
- `parseKmlDocument.ts` — KML XML → raw points
- `trackStats.ts` — builds a `GPXTrack` with computed stats from raw points
- `interpolateTrackPoint.ts` — interpolates a track point at arbitrary progress

Entry point: `app/src/utils/gpxParser.ts` (`parseGPX`, `parseKML`, `parseGPXFiles`). The `useGPX` hook wraps this for file input handling.
