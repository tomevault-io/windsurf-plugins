# AIKON (formerly Claude S40) – development notes (public)

AI chat client (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok) for Nokia Series 40
and Symbian S60 phones (Java ME) + its Go server. Named Claude S40 until 0.11.0; the repository is github.com/emir/AIKON
(was emir/claude-s40); Java package, RMS stores and server/service names
keep the old name.
Maintainer: Emir Karşıyakalı (github.com/emir). This repository is the only
place the project is developed. Private operational details (server address,
devices, phone) are in `CLAUDE.local.md` (gitignored), never in tracked files.

## Layout and commands

    app/     Java ME MIDlet (CLDC 1.1 / MIDP 2.0, class 46.0), package io.github.emir.claudes40
    server/  Go server: phone TLS + chat + SQLite + admin API, Docker
    docs/    SETUP.md (user guide), ARCHITECTURE.md (protocol, TLS, rules)

    make test                     server tests (race) + app build/checks
    make -C app                   build + 42 package checks + reproducible rebuild
    make -C app emu FREEJ2ME=...  optional emulator screenshots; make -C app promo
    make -C server test | docker
    server/deploy/push.sh HOST [--execute]   plan by default
    server/deploy/admin.sh HOST pair|devices|revoke|logs

Run `make test` after changes. On macOS use Homebrew's JDK if /usr/bin/java
is only a stub: `make -C app JAVA=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin/java`.

## Rules

- Keep tracked files free of personal data, IPs, host names, device ids and
  secrets; `check.py` scans the JAR/JAD, keep the repo equally clean.
- Ask before: deploying the server, anything that writes to the phone
  (installs are run by the user with `--execute`), paid Claude API calls
  beyond the user's own use, infrastructure/firewall changes, pushing to
  GitHub.
- Phone app: CLDC 1.1 / MIDP 2.0 API only (no StringBuilder, generics,
  String.format); every user-visible string is bilingual `L.s("Türkçe",
  "English")`; sizes from getWidth()/getHeight(), softkeys as Commands,
  arrows via getGameAction(); networking only on worker threads; HTTPS only.
  Bump VERSION/BUILD in `app/app.properties` for every build given to a phone;
  never reuse a version. JAD/manifest values must stay ASCII.
- Protocol `S40/1` is shared by phone and server: keep changes backwards
  compatible or bump both together (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Paid calls: never retry automatically; keep request_id replay, the
  pending-before-call record and `uncertain` semantics. No exactly-once claims.
- TLS: never add a plain-HTTP fallback, never disable certificate checks,
  never offer RC4/3DES. The phone (Nokia 6300) offers only TLS 1.0 +
  RSA/AES-CBC-SHA, no SNI; it verifies SHA-1 certificates from our root.
- Logs never contain message text, replies, tokens, keys or client IPs.
- Mock replies say "[Test mode]"; never present them, or emulator results,
  as real Claude output or device results.
- Since AIKON (2026-10-02) the app shows no "unofficial" wording and names
  no single phone model; README and TRADEMARKS.md keep the statement that
  the project is not affiliated with the model providers or Nokia, and the
  About Info page says so too. The app's mark is its own (not the Claude
  spark).
