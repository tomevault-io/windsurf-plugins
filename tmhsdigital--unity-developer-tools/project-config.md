You are working on Unity Developer Tools, a Cursor IDE plugin for Unity game development.

## Repo structure

- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` - plugin manifest (version is auto-managed by CI)
- `skills/` - 18 SKILL.md files (project setup, MonoBehaviour, ScriptableObjects, physics, UI, shaders, animation, audio, input, networking, editor scripting, performance, render pipelines, ECS/DOTS, visual scripting, testing, addressables, platform targeting)
- `rules/` - 8 .mdc rule files (C# conventions, lifecycle, performance, naming, serialization, shaders, visual scripting, security)
- `snippets/` - 20 code snippets organized by type (csharp, shaders, visual-scripting)
- `templates/` - 5 starter templates (2d-platformer, 3d-fps, ui-menu-system, scriptableobject-architecture, editor-tool)
- `mcp-server/` - Python FastMCP server with 4 tools and JSON data files
- `docs/` - architecture, roadmap, contributing, getting started
- `.github/workflows/` - validate, release, deploy-docs, label-sync, update-unity-api, stale
- `mkdocs.yml` - MkDocs Material documentation site configuration
- `.github/scripts/` - refresh_unity_data.py (data update script)
- `AGENTS.md` - full workflow and contribution guide for AI agents
- `CHANGELOG.md` - manually maintained release history

## Commit conventions

Use conventional commits. The release workflow auto-bumps version based on prefix:
- `feat:` = minor bump
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` = major bump
- `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc. = patch bump

## Version management

Never manually edit the version in `plugin.json` or the README version badge. The release workflow (`release.yml`) auto-updates both on push to main.

## Hard rules

- No em dashes or en dashes anywhere. Use hyphens or rewrite.
- No hardcoded credentials, tokens, API keys, or passwords.
- All C# code should target Unity 6.x conventions.
- Use Awaitable over IEnumerator coroutines for new async code.
- Use FindFirstObjectByType, not FindObjectOfType (deprecated).
- Use HLSLPROGRAM, not CGPROGRAM (deprecated in URP/HDRP).
- Use UI Toolkit for editor tools, not IMGUI/OnGUI.
- Python in `mcp-server/` must pass `py_compile`.
- URP is the default render pipeline. HDRP is maintenance-only. Built-in is deprecated.

## When editing skills or rules

- Skills are SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter. Keep them accurate to current Unity 6.x APIs.
- Rules are .mdc with frontmatter (`description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`). They enforce conventions in generated code.
- After adding/removing a skill or rule, update `plugin.json` to register it and update counts in README.md.

## When editing the MCP server

- All tool logic lives in `mcp-server/server.py`.
- Placeholder modules in `mcp-server/tools/` maintain directory structure.
- Data files in `mcp-server/data/` provide reference databases.
- Dependencies are listed in `mcp-server/requirements.txt`.

## When editing templates

- Every template directory needs at minimum a README.md and working C# scripts.
- Follow Unity 6 conventions: Awaitable, new Input System, [SerializeField] private.

## When editing snippets

- Each snippet has a header comment explaining what it does and when to use it.
- Use modern Unity patterns throughout.

## When editing workflows

- `release.yml` uses `[skip ci]` on its version bump commit. Don't remove that.
- `release.yml` paths-ignore excludes `.github/**`, `docs/**`, `*.md`, `LICENSE`. Content-only changes won't trigger releases.
- `release.yml` has a concurrency guard. Only one release can run at a time.
- `release.yml` builds and attaches a zip artifact to each GitHub Release.
- `update-unity-api.yml` commits with `chore:` prefix (patch bump). Don't change to `feat:`.
- `validate.yml` runs 8 parallel jobs on PR and push. Keep checks fast.
- `label-sync.yml` auto-labels PRs by path. Add new label mappings when adding top-level directories.
- `deploy-docs.yml` builds and deploys the MkDocs Material site to GitHub Pages on every push to main.
- When adding a new skill, also add it to the `nav:` section in `mkdocs.yml`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` is manually maintained. Update it for significant changes.

## When editing MCP data files

- Do not manually edit files that `update-unity-api.yml` manages unless you also update the refresh script.
- Each JSON data file has a schema validated by `validate.yml`. Adding or renaming fields requires updating the validation job.
