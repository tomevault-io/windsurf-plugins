# A2UI Agent Source of Truth (AGENTS.md)

This document is the authoritative guide for AI agents working within the A2UI repository. It outlines design philosophy, repository structure, and synchronization guidelines.

---

## How to Use these Guides

> **INSTRUCTION FOR ALL AGENTS (Gemini CLI, Claude, OpenAI, Antigravity, etc.):**
> Before performing any specific tasks, load and read the respective skill recipe file in full:

- **For working with Spec-Driven Development (SDD) or repository blueprints:** Read [blueprints/README.md](blueprints/README.md)
- **For implementing new SDKs in a client language:** Read [.agents/skills/a2ui-implement-new-sdks-for-client-language/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/a2ui-implement-new-sdks-for-client-language/SKILL.md)

---

## 1. What is A2UI?

**A2UI (Agent-to-User Interface)** is a platform-agnostic, streaming-first UI protocol designed specifically to allow Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents to generate user interfaces.

Key capabilities:

- **Streaming UI:** Progressive rendering of components and values on the fly to minimize latency.
- **Two-Way Data Binding:** Seamless state synchronization between client and agent.
- **Local Function Evaluation:** Execution of validation/logic functions registered in Component Catalogs.

---

## 2. Protocol Versioning & Authority

The repository supports multiple versions of the A2UI protocol:

- **v0.8**: Stable specification; not supported by the latest SDKs.
- **v0.9**: Stable specification; implemented in SDKs; very minor differences from v0.9.1.
- **v0.9.1**: **Latest published and active protocol version** implemented by our multi-language SDKs, renderers, and sample clients.
- **v1.0**: Candidate specification for stable release (previously v0.10).
- **Authority Rule:** Default to version **v0.9.1** as the primary authority when working on SDKs or adapters, unless the user specifies otherwise or a different version is requested.

---

## 3. Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

> **IMPORTANT:** By default, agents should **IGNORE the `blueprints/` folder** unless explicitly instructed by the user to work with blueprints or Spec-Driven Development.

To scale development across multiple programming languages and UI frameworks, the A2UI repository adopts **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**. Under this methodology:

- **Language-Agnostic Blueprints** define high-level architecture and features under the `blueprints/` directory (`blueprints/modules/` and `blueprints/features/`).
- **Concrete Codebases** track their module compliance by git commit hash using a `codebase.blueprint.md` file stored under `blueprints/codebases/<relative_codebase_path>/codebase.blueprint.md`.
- **SDD Skills**: SDD skills live in `blueprints/skills/` and can be symlinked into `.agents/skills/` by running `./blueprints/link_skills.sh`. To remove them when done, remove the `.agents/skills/a2ui-*` symlinks.

For a detailed explanation of the methodology, lifecycle, and workflows, read the [Spec-Driven Development Proposal](specification/proposals/spec_driven_development.md).

## 4. Codebase & Repository Structure

- **`blueprints/`**: Isolated central repository for language-agnostic module blueprints (`modules/`), feature blueprints (`features/`, `features/archived/`), codebase compliance blueprints (`codebases/`), and SDD skills (`skills/`).
- **`docs/`**: Documentation hierarchy. Public site documentation published via MkDocs resides in `docs/public/`, while non-public contributor or internal documentation resides under `docs/` alongside `docs/scripts/`.
- **`specification/`**: Versioned subdirectories (`v0_8/`, `v0_9/`, `v0_9_1/`, `v1_0/`) containing JSON schemas, component/function catalogs, and human-readable guides. The `specification/<version>/docs/a2ui_protocol.md` file is the most important source of truth for each protocol version, and the `specification/<version>/json` directory contains the associated schemas for the protocol.
- **`agent_sdks/`**: Server integration SDKs for Python (`python/`) and core conformance tests (`conformance/`).
- **`kotlin/`**: Legacy Kotlin agent SDK (`agent_sdk_legacy/`).
- **`renderers/`**: Shared core state logic (`web_core/`), Lit renderer (`lit/`), Angular renderer (`angular/`), React renderer (`react/`), markdown parser (`markdown/`), and placeholder for Flutter (`flutter/`).
- **`samples/`**: Ready-to-run demo agents utilizing Python ADK (`agent/adk/`), MCP server (`agent/mcp/`), and sample clients (`client/lit/`, `client/angular/`, `client/react/`, `client/flutter/`).
- **`tools/`**: Developer utility suite including visual Editor (`editor/`), visual Composer (`composer/`), payload Inspector (`inspector/`), and catalog builder (`build_catalog/`).

---

## 5. Yarn Workspaces & Standard Script Targets

All Node.js and TypeScript projects inside the repository must be managed as **Yarn workspaces** registered inside the `"workspaces"` array of the root `package.json`.

When creating or modifying workspaces, guarantee strict script uniformity by implementing canonical targets:

- **`"build"`**: TypeScript compilation via `wireit` or `tsc -b`.
