description: Use `uv run` for running Python code instead of raw python3
---


# Running Python code
- **Do not** run `python3 -c` directly.
- Always invoke Python code using `uv run python <script>` or `uv run <module>` when executing project scripts.
- Use the `uv` environment so that dependencies from `uv.lock` are respected.
- This applies to both interactive code execution and testing.
