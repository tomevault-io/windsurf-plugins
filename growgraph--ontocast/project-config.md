# Python Coding Rules
- Use python 3.12 conventions: use `type | None` instead of `Optional` etc
- Use type hints everywhere (PEP 484).
- Use snake_case for functions and variables, PascalCase for classes.
- Use `pydantic.BaseModel` for structured data, not dataclasses
- Avoid unused imports.
- Use `async`/`await` where appropriate.
- Always keep functions small and composable.
- Avoid using hasattr at all costs, it's not safe
