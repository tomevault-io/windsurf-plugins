# bigfoot — Project Instructions

## Certainty is the Contract

bigfoot's entire value proposition is certainty: when a test passes, you **know** exactly what happened — not just that nothing crashed.

### Full Assertion Certainty is Mandatory for All Plugins

Every plugin MUST enforce that all recorded fields are asserted. This is non-negotiable.

**The rule:** `assertable_fields(interaction)` MUST return `frozenset(interaction.details.keys())` minus any fields explicitly excluded for ergonomic reasons (e.g., fields that are already implicit from the source sentinel). The default implementation in `BasePlugin` enforces this.

### Auto-Assert is PROHIBITED

**Auto-asserting interactions is not acceptable under any circumstances.** Auto-assert means calling `timeline.mark_asserted(interaction)` at the time an interaction is *recorded*, before the test author has explicitly called `assert_interaction()`. This defeats the entire purpose of bigfoot.

Do **not** implement auto-assert. Do **not** suggest auto-assert as a design option. Do **not** add it back under any framing ("convenience", "ergonomic default", "opt-in certainty", etc.). It is wrong. It was already removed from StateMachinePlugin and RedisPlugin for this reason.

If you encounter code that calls `timeline.mark_asserted()` inside a `record()` or intercept hook (anywhere other than inside `assert_interaction()`), treat it as a bug and fix it.

The codebase also enforces this at runtime: `Timeline.mark_asserted()` raises `AutoAssertError` immediately if called while `Timeline.record()` is in progress (detected via `ContextVar`). Any test that triggers the auto-assert pattern will fail loudly rather than silently passing. Do not remove or work around this guard.

**What is PROHIBITED:**
- Auto-asserting interactions without requiring explicit `assert_interaction()` calls
- Calling `timeline.mark_asserted(interaction)` from any plugin record/intercept method
- Returning `frozenset()` from `assertable_fields()` without a documented, specific reason
- Recording data in `interaction.details` that callers are not required to assert

**What is REQUIRED:**
- Every field stored in `interaction.details` must be assertable and required by default
- If a field is not meaningful to assert (e.g., internal metadata), exclude it from `details` entirely — do not record it and then silently skip it
- New plugins must use `frozenset(interaction.details.keys())` as their `assertable_fields` implementation unless there is a specific, documented ergonomic reason to exclude a field

### Ergonomic Assertion Helpers are Encouraged

Plugins may (and should) provide typed assertion helper methods on their proxy objects to make asserting common patterns ergonomic. These helpers MUST still enforce full field coverage — they are wrappers around `assert_interaction()`, not bypasses.

### The Test of Certainty

Ask yourself: if every `assert_interaction()` call in a test were removed, would the test still pass? If yes, the plugin is not providing certainty. Fix it.
