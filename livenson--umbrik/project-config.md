# Working on umbrik

Conventions for anyone — human or agent — changing this repository. Read this before the first
edit; several rules below exist because breaking them produced containers no other CDOC2
implementation could read.

## The one rule that matters

**Never guess a cryptographic constant.** Every salt, info string, iteration count, hash choice
and byte range is published. If you cannot find a value in the specification or in
`open-eid/cdoc2-java-ref-impl`, stop and say so. Do not write a placeholder and do not "reason"
your way to a plausible value.

All constants are recorded with citations in [`docs/CRYPTO-CONSTANTS.md`](docs/CRYPTO-CONSTANTS.md).
Add to it rather than scattering literals through the code. That citation, not CodeQL, is what
guards this: `rust/hard-coded-cryptographic-value` is excluded in
[`.github/codeql/config.yml`](.github/codeql/config.yml), which explains why it cannot be right
about published wire constants.

Four that look wrong but are not:

- HKDF is **HMAC-SHA-256 everywhere**, including the P-384 ECDH path. Habit says pair P-384 with
  SHA-384; the format does not.
- RSA-OAEP uses **SHA-256 for MGF1** as well as the digest. Defaulting MGF1 to SHA-1 is the
  classic interop failure.
- The **key label is a KDF input for SC05 and SC06** but not for SC01 or SC02. Editing a label
  breaks decryption for the first two and nothing for the last two.
- SC02 uses **no KDF at all** — the KEK is transported directly under RSA-OAEP. (Not
  implemented; the constants are recorded for anyone adding it back.)

## Verification

**A round trip proves nothing.** A constant applied consistently in both directions passes every
self-test. Only two things catch it:

```bash
tests/interop/run.sh    # round trips against the reference cdoc2-cli, both directions
cargo test              # includes a fixed-RNG golden file pinning our exact output
```

Run interop for any change touching cryptography, the container layout, or a dependency of
either. It is a required check on `main`.

**Do not trust the committed test vectors' pairings.** Three have drifted from the keys, labels
and passwords committed beside them. Verify a pairing with a test before relying on it; see
[`tests/vectors/PROVENANCE.md`](tests/vectors/PROVENANCE.md).

## Layering

- **L0 `header`** — framing and FlatBuffers codec. Pure; no traits, no I/O. Attacker-controlled
  input is parsed here *before* anything is authenticated, so it must never panic: no indexing,
  no slicing.
- **L1 `schemes`** — one KEK function per scheme. Pure and individually vector-testable.
- **L2 `container`** — orchestration; the only place traits and the RNG are injected.

`umbrik-core` must not depend on `cryptoki`, `reqwest`, `ldap3`, or any hardware or HTTP crate.
Hardware lives in `umbrik-pkcs11`, network in `umbrik-ldap`.

## Invariants worth preserving

- **The header MAC cannot be checked before the private-key operation** — its key descends from
  the FMK. `VerifiedHeader` encodes this: it is only constructible by passing the check, and is
  the only thing payload decryption accepts. Do not add a path around it.
- **The payload is one AEAD invocation.** Authentication completes before any plaintext exists,
  so nothing unauthenticated reaches disk. Do not introduce an incremental streaming API.
- **The RNG is a parameter, never a global.** This is what makes golden files possible.
- **`Limits` is a struct, not a trait**, enforced inside the reader. A trait would attract a
  permissive implementation.
- **`ErrorCode` discriminants are frozen** across major versions; they cross the C ABI. Add at
  the end, never reorder.

## Diagnostics

`-v`/`-vv` on the CLI prints to stderr through `Verbosity`, which has no method that accepts a
secret. Keep it that way: making a leak require a new method is a stronger guarantee than
remembering not to pass the wrong value. `verbose_output_never_contains_secrets` runs the binary
at `-vv` and greps its output for the password, key and plaintext.

## Directory lookups

A single id code returns several credentials — ID-card, Digi-ID, Mobile-ID, each with an
authentication and a signing certificate. `umbrik-ldap` keeps every authentication certificate on
a physical card and reports the rest with a reason; `-v` prints them. Silently dropping a
candidate makes "no usable certificate" impossible to diagnose, which is why `Lookup` carries
`rejected` alongside `matches`.

When several survive, all of them become recipients: the holder can open the container with any
of their cards.

## Certificates

Validity dates are checked and a certificate outside its window is refused unless
`--allow-expired` is given. Chain and revocation checking are deliberately absent — they need a
trust store and an OCSP/CRL lookup, and add little where recipients come from an authenticated
directory or a file the user chose. Do not add a partial version that implies more than it
delivers.

## Out of scope

Do not implement without asking: **SC02** (RSA — pre-2018 cards; removing it dropped the `rsa`
crate and the project's only security advisory), **SC07** (key shares — 2.0 draft, needs an SK
relying-party contract, and could not be gated by interop), **SC03/SC04** (capsule server),
