# Kazoo - Voice-Driven Synthesizer

## Project Overview

Kazoo transforms vocal input (humming, mouth noises, beatboxing) into synthesized instrument sounds through genuine synthesis techniques. This is NOT effects processing over voice — it is real synthesis driven by vocal analysis.

## Architecture

Two-crate Rust workspace:
- **kazoo-core**: Audio library with zero UI dependencies. Any frontend consumes this API.
- **kazoo-tui**: Ratatui terminal frontend.

### Thread Architecture (kazoo-core)
1. **cpal input callback** (OS-managed) — writes mic samples to ring buffer. ZERO processing.
2. **cpal output callback** (OS-managed) — the main audio workhorse. Reads mic from ring buffer, drains commands, runs mixer (synth + effects), applies soft limiter, writes directly to output buffer, pushes display state. All processing state is owned by this callback's closure.
3. **Analysis thread** — pitch detection, FFT spectrum, formant extraction, onset detection. Allowed to allocate.
4. **Disk I/O thread** — writes recorded audio to WAV files.

### Communication
- UI → Engine: `crossbeam-channel` (bounded MPSC) for commands
- Engine → UI: `ringbuf` (lock-free SPSC) for display state snapshots
- Input callback → Output callback: `ringbuf` for mic samples

## Coding Standards

This codebase runs mission-critical infrastructure for financial, legal, and healthcare settings.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- **NO LAZY CODE:** Every implementation must be complete and robust
- **NO SHORTCUTS:** Handle all edge cases, no partial implementations
- **NO DEVIATING FROM PLAN:** Follow agreed approach; raise concerns before changing direction
- **NO DEFERRED WORK:** Set work is NOT optional, you must not defer tasks "for later"
- **PRODUCTION READY:** All code deployable immediately
- **STABLE:** All error cases handled, inputs validated
- **PERFORMANT:** Consider memory, complexity, efficiency

**The standard:** Would you trust this code with patient records, financial transactions, or legal documents? If not, it's not ready.

## Critical Architectural Rules

1. **Output callback is the processing engine:** No allocations, no locks, no file I/O, no panics. Pre-allocated state is moved into the callback at engine start.
2. **Pre-allocate everything:** All buffers allocated at engine creation, reused throughout lifetime.
3. **`unsafe_code = "forbid"`** across the entire workspace. No exceptions.
4. **Lock-free communication only:** Ring buffers between real-time threads, channels for command dispatch.
5. **NaN/Inf defense:** All audio processing must handle NaN/Inf inputs gracefully (output silence).

## Module Dependency Graph

```
lib.rs (Processor trait, Error, Db, Pan, TimePosition, constants)
  │
  ├── transport/    (TransportClock — no other internal deps)
  ├── analysis/     (PitchDetector, SpectrumAnalyzer, OnsetDetector, FormantExtractor, EnvelopeFollower)
  ├── io/           (device enumeration, file I/O, disk recorder)
  ├── effects/      (BiquadFilter, Delay, Reverb, Chorus, Distortion, FormantShift, EffectChain)
  ├── synthesis/    (PitchTracked, Wavetable, Granular, Vocoder, PhaseVocoder — uses analysis types)
  ├── mixer/        (Track, Mixer — uses effects + synthesis)
  └── engine/       (EngineHandle, threading, ring buffers — uses ALL modules)
```

## Build Commands

## Code Review Standards

Reviews must use the Opus model. There is no such thing as a minor issue. Everything needs to be dealt with. Nothing can be skipped, nothing can be deferred, nothing can be of any standard other than the highest.
