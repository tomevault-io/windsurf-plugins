# Contributor Guide

Use this file when changing this repository. It is not an operating guide for using Dataiku through the plugin; that workflow starts in `skills/dataiku-headless/SKILL.md`.

## Start here

- Read `CODING_STANDARDS_AND_STRUCTURE.md` before changing code. It owns the detailed design, validation, async, release, and review conventions.
- Read the files you will change, their tests, and the relevant skill reference before editing.
- Inspect the worktree first and preserve unrelated changes.
- Prefer the smallest coherent change. Do not add compatibility layers, new dependencies, or new public tools unless the task requires them.

## Architecture and boundaries

- `dataiku_mcp/server.py` constructs the FastMCP server, request middleware, and stdio/HTTP runners. `dataiku_mcp/__init__.py` re-exports that public server API and imports each tool module so decorators register their tools.
- `dataiku_mcp/tools/` contains thin adapters over the synchronous `dataikuapi` client. Shared client authentication and executors live at the package root; validation, serialization, and error helpers live under `dataiku_mcp/tools/utils/`.
- `dataiku_mcp/tools/cobuild.py` owns retained Cobuild conversations. Cobuild is the default path for constructing or modifying project-level flow and analytic assets.
- Cobuild owns construction and modification of project-level flow and analytic assets. Direct writes are allowed only for the fixed exception categories defined by the **Cobuild Write-Routing Convention** in `CODING_STANDARDS_AND_STRUCTURE.md`; do not infer permission for a new direct write from existing implementation.
- `skills/dataiku-headless/SKILL.md` is the operator-facing router. Its `references/` directory owns object-specific inspection, mutation, and verification workflows.
- `runtime/run_mcp.py` is the entry point used by manifests through `uv run --quiet`. It owns the PEP 723 runtime metadata. Stdout is reserved for MCP JSON-RPC; diagnostics belong on stderr. `runtime/launcher.sh` is inactive legacy fallback code retained for possible future use.

## Sources of truth

- Registered MCP surface: `tests/test_tool_surface.py`.
- User-facing capability boundary and tool inventory: `docs/capabilities.md`, enforced by `tests/test_capabilities_doc.py`.
- Tool registration imports: `dataiku_mcp/__init__.py`.
- Project dependencies, Python support, version, and CLI entry points: `pyproject.toml`.
- Standalone server dependency pins and Python floor: the PEP 723 block in `runtime/run_mcp.py`.
- Plugin launch configuration: `.mcp.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.
- User-facing installation and architecture overview: `README.md`.
- Release behavior: `RELEASE.md` and `.github/workflows/bump.yml`.
- CI behavior: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`.

Do not copy volatile inventories, versions, or command details into this file when a source above can be referenced instead.

## Changing MCP code

- Keep tool handlers `async def`. Put every blocking SDK or filesystem operation inside `run_blocking(...)`; use `run_cobuild_blocking(...)` only for retained Cobuild turns.
- Capture any client or instance identity needed for consistency before the first `await` when a concurrent instance switch could otherwise change the target.
- Keep handlers thin: validate boundary invariants, call the SDK, shape a compact response, and let Dataiku validate deeper domain rules.
- Reuse helpers from `tools/utils/` instead of adding local variants. Use `compact_json`, `columnar`, and `omit_empty` for consistent responses where appropriate.
- Raise clear exceptions for whole-operation failures. Return structured per-item or uncertain-outcome payloads only when callers need partial results or durable job/run identities for recovery.
- Never return API keys, credentials, unredacted connection secrets, or sensitive exception text.
- Represent destructive intent with semantic parameters such as `overwrite`, `drop_data`, or a replace/run mode. Do not add `confirm*` parameters; confirmation is a harness concern.
- If adding a tool module, import it in `dataiku_mcp/__init__.py`. For every add, remove, or rename, update `tests/test_tool_surface.py` in the same change.
- Give a tool you add or change the advertised metadata described under **Tool Metadata** in `CODING_STANDARDS_AND_STRUCTURE.md`. Every registered tool now carries it; a tool without it is a regression.
- Add focused tests with fakes or monkeypatching. Tests must not require a live Dataiku instance.

## Changing Cobuild, launch, or packaging code

- Preserve Cobuild conversation ownership by instance and project, one active turn per conversation, exact turn IDs for answers, and recoverable polling after timeouts or cancellation.
- Keep general SDK work and long-running Cobuild calls on their separate executors.
- Keep `runtime/launcher.sh` POSIX `/bin/sh` compatible and silent on stdout if modifying its retained legacy fallback behavior.
