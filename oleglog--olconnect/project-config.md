# Olcrtc_client agent rules

- Never run Gradle, Android, APK, native, lint, unit-test, instrumentation-test, or other validation commands locally.
- Run every check, build, and release only through GitHub Actions workflows in this repository.
- Keep `docs/` local-only. Do not add, commit, or push it.
- Release from `main` with semantic tags. This project rolls the minor version after patch 9 (`1.0.9` -> `1.1.0`).
- Keep only the five newest GitHub Release objects; preserve Git tags and Git history.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **Olcrtc_client** (4263 symbols, 11783 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
