# MAV Engineering Protocol (Gemini CLI Context)

This file defines project-specific rules, specifications, and context for Gemini CLI when working on the "Mini-Auto" Vacuum Platform (MAV).

## 🌍 Language & Communication
- **Primary Language:** All technical communication, code comments, and documentation MUST be in **English**.
- **Exception:** Only use German if explicitly requested by the user for a specific task.

## 🎯 Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Core Rules
1. **Spec-First:** Before any implementation or bug fix, you MUST verify requirements in the local component's specification file (e.g., `**/docs/specs/SPEC.md`).
2. **Component Autonomy:** Documentation and specs remain within their respective component folders (e.g., `firmware/mav-esp-drive/`).
3. **Traceability:** Every code change must be traceable to a Requirement ID (`REQ-[PLATFORM]-[ID]`) and a Task ID in `docs/tasks/`.
4. **No Phantom Features:** Do not implement functionality not defined in a spec. Propose a spec update first if needed.
5. **Validation is Mandatory:** A task is "Done" only when it passes validation (tests/logs) defined in its local `test/` or `docs/specs/` folder.

## 🔄 Continuity & State Management
- **Seamless Handoff:** To ensure a seamless start for the next session, you MUST update the project status (e.g., in `STATUS.md`) after every major task or at the end of a session.
- **Progress Tracking:** Always check `STATUS.md` first to understand the current "Active" tasks and milestones.

## 🛠 Workflow
1. **Research:** Identify the affected component and locate its `docs/specs/SPEC.md`. Check `STATUS.md` for current progress.
2. **Strategy:** Propose changes to the spec, the code, and the status.
3. **Act:** Update the spec first, then implement the code, then update the status.
4. **Validate:** Run the local test suite (e.g., `pytest`, `pio test`, or `colcon test`).

## 📁 Key Specifications & Documentation
- **Project Rules:** `.mav-rules.md` (Original Source)
- **Current Status:** `STATUS.md` (Primary source for progress tracking)
- **Hardware Platform:** `docs/specs/HARDWARE_PLATFORM.md` (REQ-HW-*)
- **Firmware Spec (ESP32):** `firmware/mav-esp-drive/docs/specs/SPEC.md` (REQ-COM-*, REQ-MOT-*, REQ-SYS-*)
- **Tasks:** `docs/tasks/`

## 🏗 Technology Stack
- **Languages:** C++20 / C, Python (Scripts/Tests)
- **Middleware:** ROS 2 (Humble/Iron), micro-ROS (XRCE-DDS)
- **Build System:** CMake / Colcon, PlatformIO
- **Testing:** GTest, Pytest (with QEMU Simulation or Hardware)

## 🤖 Persona
Act as a Senior Systems Architect. Ensure consistency between hardware layers (ESP32, RPi, Cloud) and strictly adhere to the SDD protocol and English language standards.
