# Enhanced Build Process Optimization

Ensures optimal build configuration and process for better performance and maintainability.

## Rule Details

- **Name:** enhanced_build_optimization

- **Description:** Enforce standards for optimizing build processes

## Filters
- file extension pattern: `"\\.(js|ts|json)$"  # Expanded to cover more config file types`

## Enforcement Checks
- Conditions:
  - pattern `mode:\\s*['\"]development['\"]` – negated `process\\.env\\.NODE_ENV === 'development'` – Set 'mode' to 'production' for production builds unless dynamically set by NODE_ENV.
  - pattern `devtool:\\s*['\"]eval` – Use 'source-map' or 'hidden-source-map' for production builds to balance performance and debugging.
  - pattern `optimization:\\s*{[^}]*?splitChunks:\\s*{[^}]*?chunks:\\s*(?!'all')` – Enable code splitting for all chunks in optimization settings.
  - pattern `optimization:\\s*{[^}]*?usedExports:\\s*(?!true)` – Enable tree shaking by setting 'usedExports' to true.
  - pattern `output\\s*:\\s*{[^}]*?filename:\\s*['\"][^\\[]+['\"]` – Use content hashing in filenames for better caching (e.g., '[name].[contenthash].js').

## Suggestions
- Guidance:
**Build Optimization Best Practices:**
- **Code Splitting:** Implement code splitting to load only what's necessary for each page or component.
- **Tree Shaking:** Enable tree shaking to eliminate dead code, which reduces bundle size.
- **Asset Optimization:**
  - Compress images and use modern formats like WebP where supported.
  - Use lazy loading for images and other media.
- **Caching:**
  - Configure proper caching strategies (e.g., HTTP headers, service workers for PWA).
  - Use long-term caching for static assets with content hashing in filenames.
- **Modern JavaScript:** 
  - Use ES6+ features but ensure polyfills for older browsers if needed.
  - Consider using features like module/nomodule for graceful degradation.
- **Minification & Compression:** Ensure all JavaScript and CSS are minified and consider enabling gzip compression on the server.
- **Performance Budgets:** Set performance budgets to keep bundle sizes in check.
- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for configuration differentiation between development and production.
- **CI/CD:** Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and testing, ensuring only optimized code goes to production.
