# PHP Memory Optimisation Standards

Guidance and automated checks to reduce peak memory usage in PHP applications. Based on widely accepted practices and the article "PHP Memory Optimization Tips" by Khouloud Haddad.

      **PHP memory optimisation recommendations:**

      - **Stream database results:** Prefer `$stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)` in a `while` loop or use generators instead of `fetchAll()`.
      - **Use generators (yield):** Iterate large datasets without allocating full arrays.
      - **Stream files:** Use `SplFileObject` or chunked reads instead of `file_get_contents()` for large files.
      - **Minimise array copying:** Avoid `array_merge()` in loops; push items directly or pre-size with known capacity (e.g., `SplFixedArray`).
      - **Free memory explicitly:** `unset($var)` after large data is no longer needed; consider `gc_collect_cycles()` for long-running scripts.
      - **Profile memory:** Use `memory_get_usage()` and tools like Xdebug/Blackfire to spot peaks.
      - **OPcache:** Ensure OPcache is enabled and sized appropriately in production.

  - type: validate
    conditions:
      # Detect full-file reads that likely could be streamed.
      - pattern: "\\bfile\\s*\\("
        message: "file() reads entire files into memory; prefer SplFileObject for line-by-line streaming."

description: Recommend enabling OPcache for lower memory and better performance when editing php.ini
filters:
  - type: file_extension

actions:
  - type: suggest
    message: |
      **OPcache recommendations (php.ini):**
      - Set `opcache.enable=1` and `opcache.enable_cli=1` for CLI scripts that process large datasets.
      - Size memory pool appropriately, e.g., `opcache.memory_consumption=128` (adjust to your project).
      - Consider `opcache.interned_strings_buffer` and `opcache.max_accelerated_files` for larger codebases.

  - type: enforce
    conditions:
      - pattern: "(?mi)^opcache\\.enable\\s*=\\s*0"
        message: "Enable OPcache in production (set opcache.enable=1) to reduce memory and CPU overhead."
