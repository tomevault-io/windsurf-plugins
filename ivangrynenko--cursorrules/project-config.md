# Enhanced Code Generation Standards

Ensures high-quality, executable code generation adhering to best practices across multiple programming languages.

## Rule Details

- **Name:** enhanced_code_generation_standards

- **Description:** Enforce standards for code generation ensuring high quality and integration readiness

## Filters
- file extension pattern: `"\\.(php|js|ts|vue|jsx|tsx|py|rb|java)$"  # Expanded to include Ruby and Java`

## Enforcement Checks
- Conditions:
  - pattern `// TODO:|#\\s*TODO:` – Replace TODOs with actual implementation - no placeholders allowed.
  - pattern `function\\s+\\w+\\s*\\([^)]*\\)\\s*\\{\\s*(?:return\\s+null|throw\\s+new\\s+Error|console\\.log)\\s*\\}` – Implement full functionality - no stub methods.
  - pattern `\\bif\\b\\s*\\(\\s*false\\s*\\)` – Remove or replace conditional statements that are always false.
  - pattern `\\bconsole\\.[^(]+|print\\s*\\(` – negated `DEBUG|LOGGING` – Remove debug logging unless it's conditional on a debug flag.
  - pattern `^\\s*#\\s*\\w+:\\s*\\w+\\s*$` – In Python, prefer type hints over comments for type annotations.

## Suggestions
- Guidance:
**Code Generation Best Practices:**
- **Executable Solutions:** Generate fully functional code, not just skeletons or stubs.
- **Readability:** 
  - Prioritize code readability, with clear naming conventions and logical structure.
  - Use whitespace effectively to enhance code clarity.
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Implement comprehensive error handling with appropriate exceptions or error codes.
  - Consider edge cases and provide meaningful error messages.
- **Imports/Dependencies:** 
  - Include all necessary imports or require statements at the beginning of the file.
  - Manage dependencies to ensure the code is self-contained or clearly documented for setup.
- **Integration:** 
  - Code should be immediately usable within the project's existing framework or technology stack.
  - Ensure compatibility with existing patterns or libraries used in the project.
- **Formatting:** 
  - Adhere to the project's coding style guide (e.g., Prettier, Black for Python, etc.).
  - Use linters and formatters to maintain consistent code style.
- **Testing:** 
  - Include unit or integration tests where applicable to validate generated code.
  - Encourage test-driven development if part of the project's culture.
- **Documentation:** 
  - Provide inline comments for complex logic or algorithms.
  - Write docstrings or JSDoc for functions, classes, and modules to describe usage, parameters, and return values.
  - Consider generating external documentation if the project uses tools like Swagger for APIs or Sphinx for Python.
- **Security:** 
  - Avoid hardcoded credentials or sensitive information.
  - Follow security best practices for the language (e.g., SQL injection prevention in PHP, XSS in JavaScript).
- **Performance:** While readability takes precedence, be mindful of performance implications of the generated code.
