description: Testing standards for Next.js/TypeScript with Vitest and Playwright

# Testing Standards (Next.js + TypeScript)

## 1. Tooling & Environment
- **Unit, component and API tests:** Vitest via npm scripts (`npm run test`, `npm run test:run`).
- **E2E:** Playwright via `npm run test:e2e` (or `npm run test:e2e:ui` for local interactive runs).
- Keep TypeScript type checks active; tests should compile under the same strict project settings as app code.
- Prefer local, deterministic environments: avoid relying on production services in tests.
- Mock external HTTP/API calls in unit/component tests unless explicitly testing integration contracts.

## 2. Directory Structure
- **Unit logic:** `tests/lib/**/*.test.ts` (pure functions/services, no UI runtime).
- **Component behavior:** `tests/components/**/*.test.tsx` (React Testing Library + Vitest).
- **API/data-layer behaviors:** `tests/api/**/*.test.ts` (service calls, data mappers, client wrappers).
- **Playwright E2E:** `e2e/**/*.spec.ts` and `e2e/**/*.spec.tsx`.

## 3. Test Implementation Standards
- Write tests in TypeScript and keep assertions behavior-focused.
- Use `describe`/`it` with clear scenario names that state intent.
- Use `@testing-library/react`, user events, and accessible queries (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`) for component tests.
- Use `vi.mock`, `vi.spyOn`, and explicit mocks for external dependencies.
- Reset shared test state in `beforeEach` (`vi.clearAllMocks`, `vi.resetAllMocks`, `cleanup` patterns where needed).
- Set up shared DOM/browser polyfills in `src/test/setup.ts`; avoid duplicating this setup in each file.
- For async behavior, use `await` + `waitFor`/RTL expectations instead of sleep-based polling.
- Avoid hardcoded URLs with secrets; pass endpoints through env vars and keep credentials out of the repository.

## 4. Security in tests
- Never embed secrets/tokens in test fixtures.
- External calls in tests must be HTTPS/TLS-backed and should be mocked unless there is a dedicated integration target.
- Prefer local/stubbed responses over live third-party calls to reduce flakiness and security risk.
- For Playwright flows that touch auth, validate redirects and session state without leaking provider tokens in logs.

## 5. Anti-Patterns
- Do not depend on arbitrary timeout sleeps (`setTimeout`, `sleep`) as stability gates.
- Do not assert via fragile selectors (deep class selectors) when role/text/label queries exist.
- Do not mix unrelated assertions in the same test; keep one behavior per test.
- Do not bypass lint, typecheck, or format rules in test files.
- Avoid using `any` just to satisfy quick assertions; prefer explicit test types or helper builders.

## 6. CI and execution guidance
- **Pre-merge baseline:** `npm run check` (`lint` + `format:check` + `tsc --noEmit` + `vitest run`).
- **Component/unit test gate:** `npm run test:run`.
- **E2E gate:** `npm run test:e2e` (starts app server automatically via Playwright config).
- Keep Playwright selectors resilient: `getByRole`, `getByText`, explicit URLs, and retries where UI is dynamic.
- Run ad-hoc scripts like `test-routes.js` only for local smoke diagnostics, not as a replacement for `npm run test:e2e`.
