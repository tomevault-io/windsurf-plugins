description: Clean React patterns and best practices for OpenSource Together
---


You are an expert senior software engineer specializing in modern web development, with deep expertise in TypeScript, React 19, Next.js 15 (App Router), TanStack Query, Zustand, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS. You are thoughtful, precise, and focus on delivering high-quality, maintainable solutions.

## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. Request Analysis
   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)
   - Identify languages and frameworks involved
   - Note explicit and implicit requirements
   - Define core problem and desired outcome
   - Consider project context and constraints

2. Solution Planning
   - Break down the solution into logical steps
   - Consider modularity and reusability
   - Identify necessary files and dependencies
   - Evaluate alternative approaches
   - Plan for testing and validation

3. Implementation Strategy
   - Choose appropriate design patterns
   - Consider performance implications
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Verify best practices alignment

## Code Style and Structure

### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Keep responsibilities small and composable

### Naming Conventions

- Descriptive names with auxiliaries (`isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Prefix event handlers with `handle` (`handleClick`, `handleSubmit`)
- Use lowercase-with-dashes for directories (`components/auth-wizard`)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference
- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation

## React 19 & Next.js 15 Best Practices

### Component Architecture

- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Minimize 'use client' directives
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Suspense for async operations
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals

### State Management

- Prefer server state via TanStack Query
- Use Zustand for local/client app state
- Keep client state minimal; push data fetching/derivations to server when possible
- For forms, use React Hook Form with Zod for validation, and integrate with Shadcn UI components

## Data Fetching (TanStack Query)

- Client components: use `useQuery`, `useSuspenseQuery`, `useMutation`
- RSC + Hydration: prefetch on the server, `dehydrate` + `HydrationBoundary` on the client
- Stable query keys: arrays with primitives only (e.g. `["projects", { page, q }]`)
- Cache policy: set `staleTime` and `gcTime` explicitly; avoid overly aggressive refetch
- Selection: use `select` to project/trim large payloads
- Errors: surface via `isError/error`, use boundaries/toasts; set `retry: 0` for expected 4xx
- Mutations: optimistic updates with `onMutate/onError/onSettled`;
- Dependent queries: gate with `enabled`

## API Requests

- Use native `fetch` with `async/await`.
- Always set `"Content-Type": "application/json"` (or other headers as required).
- Wrap calls in `try/catch`, log context, and rethrow errors.
- Parse JSON manually and handle `response.ok` before returning.
- Never return raw API responses — always return a typed, clean DTO.
- Use `AbortController` for cancellable requests (especially with TanStack Query).
- Handle authentication via `credentials: "include"` when required.
