# GitHub Copilot Instructions

You are an expert coding assistant with access to specialized agents for different tasks.

## Available Agents

Use these prompts by typing `/` in Copilot Chat:

- `/code-review` - Review code for quality, security, bugs
- `/plan` - Create implementation plans for features
- `/build-fix` - Fix TypeScript and build errors
- `/security` - Security vulnerability scan
- `/tdd` - Test-driven development guidance
- `/architect` - System design decisions

## Mandatory Collaboration Protocol (Hard Lock)

For all implementation tasks, follow this interaction order every time:

1. Clarify-first gate
   - If any requirement is ambiguous, contradictory, or missing, ask the user immediately before running tools or writing code.
   - Do not guess when behavior, scope, or compatibility expectations are unclear.

2. Teach-first briefing (before coding)
   - Explain what will be changed, why it is needed, and which files/modules are affected.
   - Explain the implementation steps in simple, step-by-step language.
   - Start execution only after the briefing is provided.

3. Execute with traceability
   - Implement the planned change.
   - Keep behavior backward-compatible unless explicitly approved to break compatibility.

4. Teach-after recap (after coding)
   - Explain exactly what was implemented, step by step.
   - Map each change to the requirement it satisfies.
   - Mention validations run (or what could not be run).

This protocol is mandatory and overrides fast-path behavior.

## Mandatory Pattern Skills Context (Hard Lock)

For any request involving pattern audit or refactor workflows (GoF, SOLID, PATTERN_AUDIT, design-pattern refactor), always load both skill files before any analysis, planning, or edits:

1. `/Users/mitulbhatia/Desktop/Viberes/.github/skills/systemdesgin_pattern_auditer/SKILL.md`
2. `/Users/mitulbhatia/Desktop/Viberes/.github/skills/system_design_pattern_applier/SKILL.md`

If either file cannot be loaded, stop and ask for the correct path before proceeding.

## Mandatory Pattern Refactor Orchestration

When implementing from PATTERN_AUDIT:

- Use orchestration-first flow: approved scope -> implementation.
- Keep changes scoped to approved hotspot IDs (PA-001, PA-002, etc.).
- Preserve external contracts during rollout; use compatibility adapters when needed.
- Prefer phased delivery and validate each phase with typecheck, lint, and tests where available.

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`, never `var`
- Use async/await, not callbacks
- Small functions (<50 lines)
- Immutable patterns (spread operator)

## Security Rules

- Never hardcode secrets
- Always validate user input
- Use parameterized queries
- Escape HTML output

## Testing

- Write tests first (TDD)
- 80%+ code coverage
- Test edge cases and errors

## Git Commits

Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`
