# OpenClaw Technical Brief for AI Coding Assistants

> **Version:** 2026.3.8 — Update monthly or after major releases. Prefer this over web searches for architecture decisions.

---

## 1. What OpenClaw Is

OpenClaw is an open-source, self-hosted autonomous AI assistant. Runs as a single long-lived Node.js daemon (the **Gateway**) on hardware you control, connects to messaging platforms as its UI, and executes tasks via LLM-driven tool calls. MIT-licensed.

- **Language:** TypeScript, Node.js >= 22
- **Build:** pnpm monorepo, tsdown bundler
- **Testing:** Vitest
- **Install:** `npm install -g openclaw@latest`
- **Default port:** 18789 (WebSocket + HTTP multiplexed)
- **Config:** JSON5 at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`

---

## 2. Message Lifecycle

Inbound message → Channel Manager → security checks (pairing, access control) → Router resolves agent → Session Manager loads session → Agent Runtime assembles system prompt (AGENTS.md + SOUL.md + USER.md + IDENTITY.md + TOOLS.md + memory tiers + skills + history) → LLM → tool calls execute → response routes back → memory updated.

---

## 3. Key Subsystems

### Channel Manager
Each platform has its own adapter. Active in this project: **WhatsApp** (Baileys — linked device, no Business API), **Telegram** (grammY). Others supported: Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage, Google Chat, IRC, Teams, Matrix, and more. Channels are decoupled from models.

### Session Manager
```json5
{
  session: {
    dmScope: "per-channel-peer",  // main | per-peer | per-channel-peer | per-account-channel-peer
    reset: { mode: "daily", atHour: 4, idleMinutes: 120 },
  },
}
```
Use `per-channel-peer` for multi-user deployments to prevent context leakage. Skills snapshot at session start; changes take effect on next new session.

### Router / Multi-Agent
```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      { id: "main" },
      { id: "support", tools: { profile: "messaging" } },
      { id: "coder",   tools: { profile: "coding" } },
    ],
  },
}
```
Each agent gets independent workspace and sessions. Switch via `/agent <id>`.

### Cron & Webhooks
- **Cron:** Schedule agent actions (e.g., morning briefing at 9 AM)
- **Webhooks:** External triggers (e.g., Gmail Pub/Sub → agent action)
- **Heartbeat:** Default 30 min. Agent reads HEARTBEAT.md, replies HEARTBEAT_OK (silently dropped) or messages user.

---

## 4. Configuration Reference

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace",
      model: {
        primary: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
        fallbacks: ["openai/gpt-5.2"],
      },
      sandbox: {
        mode: "non-main",  // off | non-main | all
        scope: "agent",     // session | agent | shared
      },
      heartbeat: { every: "30m" },
    },
    list: [
      { id: "main", groupChat: { mentionPatterns: ["@openclaw", "openclaw"] } },
    ],
  },

  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      allowFrom: ["+15555550123"],
      groups: { "*": { requireMention: true } },
    },
    telegram: {
      enabled: true,
      botToken: "123:abc",
      dmPolicy: "pairing",  // pairing | allowlist | open | disabled
    },
  },

  gateway: {
    port: 18789,
    mode: "local",       // local | cloud
    bind: "loopback",
    auth: { token: "..." },
  },

  tools: {
    profile: "full",     // full | coding | messaging
    allow: [],
    deny: [],
    loopDetection: { enabled: true, warningThreshold: 10, criticalThreshold: 20 },
  },

  skills: {
    load: { extraDirs: ["~/Projects/skills"], watch: true },
    install: { preferBrew: true, nodeManager: "npm" },
    entries: {
      "my-skill": { enabled: true, env: { MY_API_KEY: "KEY_HERE" } },
    },
  },
}
```

**Hot reload:** Gateway watches config and applies changes automatically.  
**Schema validation:** Unknown keys cause Gateway to refuse to start.

## 5. Workspace Files

Root: `~/.openclaw/workspace`

| File | Purpose | Loaded When |
|---|---|----|
| `AGENTS.md` | Master workflow: session startup, safety rules, memory protocol, heartbeat behavior | Every session |
| `SOUL.md` | Persona: tone, temperament, values, anti-patterns | Every session |
| `USER.md` | User context: name, timezone, work context, preferences | Every session |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Agent identity: name, emoji, theme | Every session |
| `TOOLS.md` | Local tool notes and conventions (guidance only, does not gate tools) | Every session |
| `MEMORY.md` | Tier 1: Curated long-term memory (~100 lines) | Main DM session only |
| `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Tier 2: Daily append-only log | Today + yesterday |
| `memory/people/`, `projects/`, `topics/`, `decisions/` | Tier 3: Deep knowledge, vector search | On-demand via `memory_search` |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Heartbeat checklist — keep minimal | Each heartbeat |
| `BOOT.md` | Startup checklist, runs on gateway restart | Gateway restart |
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | One-time first-run ritual (delete after) | First run only |

**Best practices:**
- SOUL.md under 100 lines; specific rules beat vague ones
- Stable rules → AGENTS.md; personal preferences → USER.md
- MEMORY.md is curated memory, not a transcript
- HEARTBEAT.md minimal — reply HEARTBEAT_OK or message user, nothing else

---

## 6. Memory System

| Tier | Location | Loading | Purpose |
|---|----|---|---|
| Tier 1 | `MEMORY.md` | Always in context (main DM) | Curated essentials, ~100 lines |
| Tier 2 | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Today + yesterday auto-loaded | Raw daily observations, append-only |
| Tier 3 | `memory/people/`, `projects/`, etc. | On-demand via `memory_search` | Deep knowledge, semantic search |

- **`memory_search` tool:** Hybrid 0.7 vector + 0.3 BM25 relevance
- Notable events append to daily log during conversations
- A librarian process promotes durable knowledge upward over time

---

## 7. Tools

Configure via `tools.allow` / `tools.deny` (deny wins).

| Tool | Description |
|---|----|
| `exec` | Run shell commands (`yieldMs`, `background`, `elevated`, `host`) |
| `process` | Manage background exec sessions (poll, log, write, kill, clear) |
| `web_search` | Web search |
| `web_fetch` | Fetch web page content |
| `browser` | CDP-controlled Chrome: navigate, snapshot, actions, uploads, profiles |
| `canvas` | Drive A2UI visual workspace: push, reset, eval, snapshot |
| `nodes` | Paired devices: camera, screen record, location, notifications, commands |
| `image` | Analyze images |
| `pdf` | PDF analysis |
| `message` | Send messages (constrained to current session) |
| `cron` | Manage scheduled jobs from conversations |
| `gateway` | Restart gateway, inspect config schema |
| `sessions_list/history/send/spawn` | Session management |
| `agents_list` | List configured agents |
| `apply_patch` | File editing via patches |

**Tool profiles:** `full` (default), `coding`, `messaging` — predefined allowlists applied before allow/deny.

---

## 8. Skills System

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions). Agent matches requests against skill descriptions and injects matching instructions.

**Precedence (highest → lowest):**
1. `<workspace>/skills/` — per-agent
2. `~/.openclaw/skills/` — shared across agents
3. Bundled skills (~53 shipped)
4. `skills.load.extraDirs`

### Skill Runtime Resolution (critical for MyGopher)

The system prompt only includes a **short description** per skill (~200-600 chars). When the agent
needs full instructions (command syntax, workflow details), it reads the SKILL.md file via `read` tool.

**The agent does NOT inherently know where custom skills are stored.** It may guess the bundled path
(`/usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills/`) which only has OpenClaw's built-in skills (gog, tmux,
weather, etc.) — NOT any `mygopher-*` skills.

**Fix: TOOLS.md must list every custom skill's absolute path.** TOOLS.md is loaded into every session
(see Workspace Files table). By listing paths there, the agent always has the correct location
without guessing. This is done in `_render_workspace_markdown_templates()` in `mygopher_service.py`.

**Key paths on MyGopher droplets:**
- Custom skills: `/home/openclaw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Bundled skills: `/usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- CLI tools: `/opt/mygopher/tools/` (send_email.py, verified_send.py, gmail_history.py)
- Pipeline libs: `/opt/mygopher/pipeline/`, `/opt/mygopher/lib/`

**When adding a new skill:** add its path to the TOOLS.md managed section (generated by
`_render_workspace_markdown_templates()` in `mygopher_service.py`) so the agent can find it.
Also add any exec commands the skill uses to `/etc/gopher/exec-allowlist.txt`.

### Skills Snapshot Caching

`sessions.json` may cache a `skillsSnapshot` from session start. If you push updated skill files
but the agent keeps using old instructions, delete the `skillsSnapshot` entries from
`/home/openclaw/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json` and restart OpenClaw.

### Lossless-Claw Memory (LCM)

The `lcm.db` SQLite database stores conversation history that persists across sessions. If the agent
learned a wrong pattern (e.g., using a broken command that was later fixed), the LCM may reinforce
the old pattern. Fix by deleting the offending messages from the `messages` table and optionally
injecting a `SYSTEM CORRECTION` message. Table schema: `conversation_id`, `seq`, `role`, `content`.

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: "What this skill does — write like describing a task to a coworker"
metadata:
  openclaw:
    skillKey: "my-skill"
    requires:
      config:
        - key: skills.entries.my-skill.apiKey
          description: "API key"
---

# Instructions
When asked to [do the thing]:
1. Step one
2. Step two
```

- Description is a **trigger phrase**, not marketing copy
- Skills snapshot at session start; `skills.load.watch: true` refreshes mid-session
- Token cost: ~97 chars + field lengths per eligible skill
- **ClawHub** (`clawhub.com`): 13,000+ community skills — always review before installing (prompt injection risk, CVE-2026-25253)

---

## 8b. Workspace Files — Managed vs User Content

MyGopher workspace files use a two-section pattern:

```markdown
<!-- MYGOPHER-MANAGED:BEGIN -->
(generated by mygopher_service.py — overwritten on upgrade)
<!-- MYGOPHER-MANAGED:END -->

<!-- USER-OVERLAY-PRESERVED:BEGIN -->
(user-written content — preserved across upgrades)
<!-- USER-OVERLAY-PRESERVED:END -->
```

`_upgrade_workspace_markdown_via_ssh()` in `mygopher_service.py` handles the merge: it replaces the
managed block while preserving any user overlay. Files that use this pattern: SOUL.md, USER.md,
IDENTITY.md, AGENTS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, TOOLS.md.

**TOOLS.md is the agent's cheat sheet.** It's loaded every session and should contain:
- Exact exec commands for common operations (email send, sheets, calendar)
- All custom skill paths (so the agent never reads from the wrong location)
- Python version notes and gotchas
- Operator-specific config (email, timezone)

The managed section is generated by `_render_workspace_markdown_templates()` which takes the user
record from Firestore and renders per-user values (operator email, assistant email, timezone, etc.).

### Environment on Droplets

- **Only `python3` is installed** — always use `python3`, not `python`. A symlink exists as safety net.
- **`gog` CLI** is used for Gmail/Calendar/Sheets operations. DWD (Domain-Wide Delegation) for
  Gmail send is broken in gog — use `python3 /opt/mygopher/tools/send_email.py` instead.
- **Exec allowlist** at `/etc/gopher/exec-allowlist.txt` gates which commands the agent can run.
  New scripts must be added here or exec calls will be denied.

---

## 9. Deployment (DigitalOcean VPS)

- Gateway runs as **systemd service** on Linux
- Remote access via **Tailscale** Serve/Funnel or SSH tunnels
- Secrets via **Infisical** or environment variables (no macOS Keychain)
- macOS-only skills won't work: apple-notes, apple-reminders, Bear, Things, iMessage legacy
- Install daemon: `openclaw onboard --install-daemon`

**Per-client deployments:** Each user gets their own Gateway instance, workspace, session state, and skills config. Use golden image snapshots for reproducible provisioning.

---

## 10. CLI Reference

```bash
# Setup
openclaw onboard              # Full setup wizard
openclaw configure            # Config wizard
openclaw doctor               # Diagnose issues, surface risky configs
openclaw doctor --repair      # Auto-fix common issues
openclaw security audit       # Security scan

# Gateway
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw status               # Session status (model, tokens, cost)

# Skills
openclaw skills list
npx clawdhub@latest install <name>
npx clawdhub@latest sync --all

# Sessions & Memory

## 11. Common Patterns

### Morning Briefing Cron
```json5
{
  cron: {
    jobs: [
      { schedule: "0 9 * * *", message: "Good morning! Run my morning briefing.", session: "main" },
    ],
  },
}
```

### Gmail Integration
Gmail Pub/Sub → webhook endpoint → triggers agent to process new emails.

### Model Cost Optimization
- Frontier model (Claude/GPT) for primary reasoning; cheaper model for heartbeats and sub-agents
- Keep SOUL.md under 500 lines to reduce token burn
- Curate MEMORY.md aggressively
- Set heartbeat interval conservatively

### Isolated Multi-Agent Workspaces
```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      { id: "personal", workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace-personal" },
      { id: "work",     workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace-work" },
    ],
  },
}
```

---

## 12. Security

- Gateway binds loopback by default; use Tailscale or SSH for remote access
- Run `openclaw doctor` after config changes
- Use `per-channel-peer` session scope to prevent context leakage
- Sandbox untrusted skills and non-main agents (`sandbox.mode: "non-main"`)
- Review community skills before installing — prompt injection risk
- Store API keys in `.env`, not in `openclaw.json`
- Known vulnerability: CVE-2026-25253 (malicious skill gateway compromise)
