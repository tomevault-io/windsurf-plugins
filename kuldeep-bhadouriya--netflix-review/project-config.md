Execution Guidelines
- Use manage_todo_list for multi-step work and update after each action.
- Keep explanations concise and avoid dumping full command output.
- Mention skipped steps briefly (e.g., “No extensions needed”).

Development Rules
- Use the workspace root (.) for commands and avoid creating extra folders.
- Limit placeholders and explain when one is used.
- Only call VS Code API docs for extension projects.
- Never revert user changes unless explicitly asked.

Folder Creation Rules
- Treat the current directory as the project root.
- Run CLI scaffolding directly in this folder.
- Only add .vscode/tasks.json when a task is required.

Extension Installation Rules
- Install only the extensions specified by get_project_setup_info.

Project Content Rules
- Default to Hello World if requirements are missing.
- Add external links or media only when requested or essential.
- Ensure every generated artifact supports the stated requirements.

Task Completion Rules
- Project scaffolded and compiled without errors.
- README.md and this instruction file stay current.
- Provide users with clear guidance to run or debug the project.
- Update this checklist before starting new work.
