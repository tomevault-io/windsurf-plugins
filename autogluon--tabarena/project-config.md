# CLAUDE.md

The primary agent guide for this repo is [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md). **Read it first** — everything in it applies here.

This file only documents Claude-specific extensions.

## Claude-Specific Tooling

### Skills (`.claude/skills/`)

- **`add-model`** — Use whenever the user asks to add/integrate/wrap a new tabular ML model. It encodes the full change: a per-model folder (`model.py` wrapper, `hpo.py` search space, `info.py` registry entry) plus edits to `models/__init__.py`, `models/utils.py`, and the `pyproject.toml` extra — and points to reference implementations for each model class (foundation, torch, sklearn-like). It also decides the model's untimed environment `warmup` (classmethod convention in `models/warmup.py`), asking the user when the library's warm-up/pre-compile entry point is unknown and reporting warm-up's limitation (main process + disk-backed caches only; parallel-fold Ray workers stay cold). The model is auto-discovered from its `info.py` and fit-tested automatically by `tests/tabarena/models/test_all_models.py` (no per-model test file); only add a `smoke_configs.py` override if its toy fit needs faster hyperparameters.
- **`benchmark-model`** — Use whenever a maintainer wants to *run* an already-integrated model on the benchmark cluster (e.g. "benchmark TabM", "run Nori on the cluster", "make a setup/eval script for DenseLight"). It scaffolds a single `tmp_scripts/run_<model>.py` with `setup` and `eval` subcommands that share one `benchmark_name` + `PathSetup` (so they can't drift), auto-filling GPU/CPU, eval `subsets`, the pip-extra install reminder, foundation-model prefetch by introspecting the model's registry `info.py` + `supported_problem_types()`, and — mandatory for every GPU model — `fake_memory_for_estimates` set to the partition's VRAM in GB (asking the user when the VRAM isn't inferable from context) so AutoGluon caps parallel bagging folds by VRAM instead of node RAM. Sits in the lifecycle between `add-model` (integrate) and `upload-method` (publish).
- **`upload-method`** — Use whenever a maintainer points at a benchmark run's output dir and wants to process / upload / register a method's results (e.g. "upload this method", "host/publish `<model>`'s results", "register `<model>` in the leaderboard"). By default Claude runs the whole flow itself after stating the plan (`scripts/run_process_method.py` inspect → `--process`; `scripts/run_upload_results.py` dry-run → `--no-dry-run`, background + monitors, r2 verified after upload) and lands the edits: the model's `info.py` `MethodMetadata` (suite / date / `cache_type` / `cache_kwargs` / verified, plus inspect-diff fixes) and the arena-collection registration in `contexts/<arena>/methods.py`. A command sheet is only handed off when the env can't run a step (no `tabarena[benchmark]` venv / no R2 creds). Mirrors AGENTS.md → "Processing & uploading method artifacts (maintainers)".
- **`update-leaderboard`** — Use whenever a maintainer wants to regenerate the website artifacts and refresh a leaderboard Space with the latest results (e.g. "update the leaderboard", "regenerate the artifacts and refresh `leaderboard-testing`", "push the new results to the leaderboard"). Takes the **path to the leaderboard Space repo** (`data/` + `main.py` + its own `.venv`) as its key input. It (1) pre-checks that newly added models classify correctly in `website/website_format.py` (Foundation Model / Tree-based / … not `❓ Other`) before generating, (2) runs `scripts/run_generate_website_artifacts.py` (background + monitor; the trailing ray SIGTERM traces are harmless), (3) refreshes the Space's `data/` via delete-then-copy to avoid the stale-unzipped-`.png` gotcha, (4) bumps the version history in the Space's `website_texts.py` (new dated entry + current-version line, verified/unverified from the model's `info.py`), and (5) optionally serves the Space locally (its own `.venv`, `127.0.0.1:7860`). Last stage after `upload-method`; the maintainer commits/pushes (Git LFS + Xet).

When the user describes work that matches a skill's trigger criteria, invoke the skill via the Skill tool instead of recreating the steps manually.

## Working Style in This Repo

- **Always run `ruff check --fix`** on touched files before reporting a task complete. The `from __future__ import annotations` requirement (isort `required-imports`) is the most common CI failure on new files. CI now enforces `ruff check .` + `ruff format --check .`, and a pinned `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is available (`pre-commit install`) — see AGENTS.md "Lint & Format".
- **Tests live in the top-level `tests/`, grouped by package** — when adding a test for `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/<area>/foo.py`, mirror the path under `tests/tabarena/<area>/test_foo.py`. (`tests/bencheval/` and `tests/tabflow_slurm/` hold the other two packages; `tests/integration/` is for cross-package tests.)
