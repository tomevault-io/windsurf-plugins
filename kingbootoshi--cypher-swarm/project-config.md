# Agent-X Development Guidelines

## Key Principles for Development

- **Modularity**: Ensure all components are highly modular to facilitate the easy addition of new terminal commands and pipelines.

- **Terminal Interface**:
  - The AI agent interacts with the world through a custom terminal interface.
  - Focus on seamless communication between the AI agent and the terminal system.

- **Twitter Integration**:
  - Prioritize Twitter functionality as the primary interface with external systems.
  - Design commands and pipelines that make interfacing with Twitter straightforward and efficient.

- **Sub-Agent Pipelines**:
  - Certain commands could trigger sub-agent pipelines to perform complex tasks.
  - Sub-agents execute commands and return results to the main AI agent.
  - Structure these pipelines to be easily extendable and maintainable.

- **Memory Management**:
  - Terminal logs and AI inputs are stored in a short-term memory buffer within the database.
  - This mimics AI chat message history where:
    - **USER**: Represents terminal logs.
    - **ASSISTANT**: Represents AI inputs to the terminal.

- **Extensibility**:
  - Design the system to simplify the creation and integration of new pipelines, starting with Twitter and expanding to other platforms.

## Development Guidelines

- **Code Quality**:
  - Write concise, efficient code with clear comments explaining the "why" and "how".
  - Use Logger.log() to log messages to the console. Log logic pipeline always. Import via import { Logger } from './utils/logger';
  - Preserve the original code's formatting and structure when making changes.
  - Avoid redundancy by modularizing code and reusing components where possible.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Prioritize comprehensive error handling and consider edge cases.
  - Provide meaningful error messages to assist in debugging and user feedback.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Keep components small with minimal props to enhance maintainability.
  - Use declarative programming paradigms and iterate functionally.
  - Implement efficient data fetching strategies, leveraging server-side capabilities when appropriate.

## Notes

- **Collaboration**: Encourage contributions by maintaining clear guidelines and an organized code structure.
- **Scalability**: Build with future growth in mind to accommodate new features and integrations.
- **Communication**: Ensure that interactions between the main AI agent and sub-agents are well-defined and documented.
