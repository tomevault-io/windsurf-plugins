# forge

Project-specific rules for this plugin repo. The pipeline lives in `skills/forge/SKILL.md`, the review wave in `skills/crossfire/SKILL.md`; stage, primitive, and lens briefs sit beside them. Global rules live in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. This file does not ship to consumers - Claude Code only loads CLAUDE.md from the user's working directory.

## Versioning

Plugin version lives in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (canonical) and is mirrored in every file registered in `scripts/version_mirrors.py` - that registry, not any list here, is the source of truth for where the version lives. Bump with `python3 scripts/bump-version.py <version>`, the only sanctioned writer; never edit version strings by hand.

- **Patch bump** after a successful task when the workflow itself changes: anything under `skills/` or `adapters/`. Same trigger: add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and update `README.md` if the public surface description shifts.
- **No bump** for doc-only changes (README, CHANGELOG, CLAUDE.md, comment polish). `marketplace.json` listing edits (description, keywords) are metadata, not workflow.
- **Minor and major** are manual. Don't auto-bump.

## CHANGELOG style

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` § "Changelog style" - one canonical home for the rules.

## Doctrine hygiene

Before adding an instruction anywhere under `skills/`, `adapters/`, or `.claude/skills/`, run a four-check meta-rule:

1. **Does an existing channel or slot already carry this?** If a map, contract, or section already owns the fact, extend it not restate - one home, not a second copy somewhere a reader will diverge from.
2. **Is the fact defined exactly once?** A rule repeated across files drifts: one copy gets edited, the other rots. Pick the canonical home and cross-reference it from anywhere else that needs to point at it.
3. **Does a cheap canary protect it?** A load-bearing literal earns a short pinned phrase the self-audit watches, so deleting or rewording it past recognition trips the doctrine-integrity check instead of silently rotting.
4. **If it is conditional, does it read a token or demand a judgment?** A gate keyed on a token some stage already emits, on a marker in the run dir, or on the user's own words is cheap - the agent looks it up. A gate whose condition the agent must decide for itself is not, and **judgment-bearing gates are the budget**: line count is nowhere near any cap, and a literal if-then count has run past 30 in `skills/forge/SKILL.md` for its whole working life. Prefer the token - name a condition some stage emits, or write a marker, before writing an adjective the agent has to interpret. A change that adds routing states the judgment-bearing count before and after.

This rule binds this repo's own changes - it governs how forge is authored, not anything shipped to a consumer. Its teeth are exactly two: the self-audit's doctrine-hygiene check (which flags an instruction line duplicated verbatim across skill files) plus author discipline at edit time. CLAUDE.md itself is neither shipped nor injected into any agent, so nothing enforces this for you automatically - the lens catches cross-file duplication after the fact, and the rest is the author honoring the four checks above. Check 4 has no canary even in principle, since deciding what counts as a judgment is itself one; the worked count that set it is the resolution on [#88](https://github.com/alp82/forge/issues/88).

## Leitwort usage

A leitwort is a leading word: a short, memorable phrase an agent restates in its own reasoning to steer its own behavior. When authoring an agent or doctrine stage, anchor its core stance on one, and prefer a phrase with trained lineage the model already carries ("deletion test", "tracer bullet", "test seams", "YAGNI ladder", "name the danger") over a coined one.

1. **Anchor over enumerate.** Give a stage one named leitwort and let its checklist of concerns hang off that anchor as supporting detail; a flat list with no anchor is the weakest form.
2. **Reinforce it.** A leitwort used once is inert. Recur it at the points where the agent acts - the anchors woven through `skills/forge/CHALLENGER.md` ("loyal opposition", "a plan is wrong until proven") are the canonical example.
3. **One concept, one name.** Naming the same idea two ways across stages dilutes both; pick the canonical phrase and reuse it verbatim.
4. **Keep it earned.** A job that reads fine as a literal instruction stays literal; a forced or fluffy coinage with no trained association tickles nothing and just spends words.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in the `alp82/forge` GitHub repo, managed via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles use their default label strings. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
