# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Claude Code Guardian** is a comprehensive validation framework for Claude Code that provides security,
performance, and policy enforcement. The project validates Claude Code tool usage and provides suggestions for
better alternatives.

Currently in early development.

## Architecture

### Package Structure

The project follows a modular architecture:

- **`ccguardian/cli/`**: CLI commands and entry points
  - `main.py`: Primary CLI group with help system
  - `hook_command.py`: Hook validation command for Claude Code integration
  - `rules_command.py`: Rule management and display commands
- **`ccguardian/config/`**: Configuration management system
  - `types.py`: Core data classes (Configuration, Rule, SourceType)
  - `models.py`: Pydantic models for configuration validation, rule definitions, and rule object conversion
  - `manager.py`: Configuration loading and merging orchestration  
  - `loader.py`: YAML configuration file parsing with Pydantic validation
  - `merger.py`: Multi-source configuration merging, rule creation, and priority sorting
  - `default.yml`: Built-in default rules
- **`ccguardian/rules.py`**: Rule definitions and validation logic

### Hook Integration

Uses cchooks library for Claude Code hook contexts. The system intercepts tool usage events
and applies validation rules before execution.

## Development Commands

### Package Management

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Build and install package locally
uv sync  # Automatically builds due to tool.uv.package = true
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Show help (exits with code 1 when no args)
uv run claude-code-guardian
uv run claude-code-guardian -h
uv run claude-code-guardian --help

# Execute hook validation (main entry point for Claude Code)
uv run claude-code-guardian hook
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage (default configuration)
uv run pytest

# Run tests without coverage  
uv run pytest --no-cov

# Run specific test files
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_cli.py
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_config_models.py
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_config_factory.py
uv run pytest tests/integration/

# Run tests with verbose output
uv run pytest -v

# Test CLI functionality manually
uv run claude-code-guardian  # Should show help and exit code 1
uv run claude-code-guardian hook --help
uv run claude-code-guardian rules

# Test CLI as if installed with a built package
uvx --no-cache --from /path/to/claude-code-guardian claude-code-guardian <args>
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Check lint and formatting issues
scripts/lint.sh

# Fix formatting issues automatically
scripts/format.sh
```

**REQUIRED**: After editing code files, IMMEDIATELY run `scripts/format.sh` before proceeding

**Test Structure:**

- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests
- `tests/conftest.py` - Shared fixtures and mock contexts

## Configuration

### Project Configuration

- **Package Name**: `claude-code-guardian` (CLI command name)
- **Python Package**: `ccguardian` (internal package name)
- **Python Version**: `>=3.12`
- **Dependencies**: `cchooks`, `click`, `pydantic`, `PyYAML`
- **Dev Dependencies**: `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`

### Configuration System

The application uses a modern hierarchical configuration system with Pydantic validation:

#### Configuration Sources (in priority order)

1. **Default rules**: Built-in rules from `ccguardian/config/default.yml`
2. **User config**: `~/.config/claude-code-guardian/config.yml`
3. **Shared config**: `/etc/claude-code-guardian/config.yml`
4. **Local config**: `.claude-code-guardian.yml` in project root

#### Key Features

- **Pydantic Validation**: All configuration files are validated using Pydantic models for type safety and structure
  validation
- **Rule-Specific Merging**: Configuration merging uses rule-specific logic with support for both complete and partial
  rule definitions
- **Pattern Validation**: Regex patterns (for bash rules) and glob patterns (for path rules) are validated at load
  time
- **Flexible Default Rules**: Support for enabling all defaults (`default_rules: true`), disabling all
  (`default_rules: false`), or pattern-based filtering (`default_rules: ["pattern.*"]`)

#### Configuration Sources Capabilities

- Enable/disable default rules with pattern-based filtering
- Define custom validation rules with full type validation
- Set rule priorities and patterns with validation
- Support both complete rule definitions and partial overrides

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% (enforced by pytest-cov)
- **Coverage Reports**: Terminal, HTML (htmlcov/), and XML formats
- **Branch Coverage**: Enabled for comprehensive testing

## Guidelines to follow at all times

- Always keep your changes limited to what was explicitly mentioned
- Don't use any 3rd party libraries/framework/code unless explicitly requested
- Focus on simplicity both in terms of design/architecture and implementation
- Code has to be easy to reason about, and easy to extend/change in the future
