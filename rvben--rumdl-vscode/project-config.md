## VS Code Engine Compatibility

**CRITICAL**: When updating `@types/vscode`, you MUST also update `engines.vscode` to match, and vice versa.

The `vsce` packaging tool validates that `@types/vscode` version is NOT greater than `engines.vscode`. If they mismatch, the release will fail with:

```
@types/vscode ^X.Y.Z greater than engines.vscode ^A.B.C
```

### Cursor/Windsurf/VSCodium Compatibility

These VS Code forks are built on older VS Code versions:
- **Cursor**: Based on VS Code ~1.93
- **VSCodium**: Varies, often behind latest

The extension marketplace only shows versions compatible with the editor's base VS Code version. If `engines.vscode` is set too high, users on these editors will be stuck on old versions.

### Current Requirements (as of v0.0.144)

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "vscode": "^1.82.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/vscode": "^1.82.0"
  }
}
```

The actual minimum is `^1.82.0` (from `vscode-languageclient@9.0.1`).

### Update Strategy

**Policy: Only update when necessary, stay compatible with Cursor/VSCodium.**

1. **Don't auto-merge** `@types/vscode` Dependabot PRs (configured to be ignored)
2. **Only update when needed** - if the extension actually needs a new VS Code API
3. **Check Cursor's base version first** - see https://github.com/cursor/cursor/issues/1602
4. **Update both together** - `engines.vscode` and `@types/vscode` must match
5. **Test with `npx vsce ls`** to validate packaging before release

### Before Bumping VS Code Version

1. Check if the extension actually uses any new APIs from that version
2. Check what VS Code version Cursor is currently based on
3. Consider impact on Cursor/VSCodium users - they will be stuck on old versions if incompatible
4. Always update BOTH `engines.vscode` AND `@types/vscode` together
5. Test with `npx vsce ls` to validate packaging
