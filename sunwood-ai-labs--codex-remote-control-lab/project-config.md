# Repository Instructions

- Keep this repository public-safe: do not commit local tokens, credentials, `.codex-home*`, or generated session databases.
- Operate this repository with Git Flow. Use `main` as the production branch and `develop` as the integration branch.
- If `develop` does not exist yet, create it from `main`, push it to `origin`, and use it for normal development work.
- Start normal work from `develop` on `feature/<short-description>` branches, then merge completed features back into `develop`.
- Use `release/<version>` branches from `develop` for release stabilization, merge finished releases to `main`, tag them as `v<version>`, and merge the release result back to `develop`.
- Use `hotfix/<version>` branches from `main` for urgent production fixes, then merge the fix back to both `main` and `develop`.
- For normal documentation and code changes, commit to `develop` or finish a `feature/*` branch into `develop`, then push `develop` to `origin`.
- Push to `main` only when finishing a `release/*` or `hotfix/*` flow.
- After each meaningful change, run a focused verification command before committing and pushing the relevant Git Flow branch.
- Prefer small commits that describe the working increment, such as adding the phone bridge, updating docs, or fixing protocol handling.
- Keep the Codex app-server bound to localhost in examples; expose only the token-protected bridge on the LAN.
