description: Standards for Rust documentation comments
---

This rule establishes standards for Rust documentation comments across all code.

## General Principles

Doc comments should be formatted with line comments (`///` or `//!`) in accordance with the [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/style-guide/#doc-comments).

All public and private components **must** have documentation following the conventions defined in [The RustDoc Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/how-to-write-documentation.html).

## Structure

### Summary Sentence
- **Always** start with a single-line summary that describes **what** the item does
- Use present tense ("Returns", "Creates", "Calculates" not "Will return", "Will create")
- Be concise and direct
- End with a period

### Additional Sections (when needed)
These sections are only needed if they are not implied by the summary sentence.
- Add blank line after summary before additional details
- Use `# Arguments` for parameter descriptions
- Use `# Returns` for complex return value explanations
- Use `# Errors` to document error conditions
- Use `# Panics` to document panic conditions
- Use `# Safety` for unsafe functions

## Specific Guidelines

### Functions and Methods
- Start with what the function **does** (not what it "will do")
- Document preconditions that may cause errors or panics
- Follow recommendations from [Better Code: Contracts](https://github.com/stlab/better-code/blob/main/better-code/src/chapter-2-contracts.md) adapted to Rust conventions
- For grammar production parsers, the production itself is sufficient documentation

**Good:**
```rust
/// `additive_expression = multiplicative_expression { ("+" | "-") multiplicative_expression }.`
fn is_additive_expression(&mut self) -> Result<bool>
```

**Bad:**
```rust
/// This function will parse additive expressions
fn is_additive_expression(&mut self) -> Result<bool>
```

### Structs and Enums
- Describe the purpose and role of the type
- State any invariants

**Good:**
```rust
/// A scope-based operation lookup with stack support.
///
/// Provides a stack of scopes for operation resolution, with built-in operations
/// as the fallback. Scopes are searched in LIFO order (most recently pushed first).
pub struct OpLookup { /* ... */ }
```

### Traits
- Describe what types implementing this trait represent
- Document trait semantics and contracts
- Provide examples of implementation

### Modules
- Use `//!` for module-level documentation
- Provide comprehensive overview with context
- Include examples demonstrating typical usage patterns
- Serve as a tutorial for the module's components

**Good:**
```rust
//! Operation table for dynamically dispatching operations based on type signatures.
//!
//! This module provides a scope-based registry for operations that can be looked up
//! based on an operation name (string) and the types of the operands.
//!
//! # Examples
//! ```
//! // Show typical usage
//! ```
```

### Type Aliases
- Explain what the alias represents
- Clarify why the alias exists (readability, semantics)

### Constants
- Describe what the constant represents
- Include units or context if applicable

## Error Documentation

When functions can return errors:
- List specific error conditions in `# Errors` section
- Be explicit about **when** errors occur

**Good:**
```rust
/// Looks up and applies an operation to the segment.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if no scope or built-in operation can handle the request.
pub fn lookup(&self, name: &str, types: &[TypeId], segment: &mut DynSegment) -> Result<()>
```

## Panic Documentation

When functions can panic:
- Document **all** panic conditions in `# Panics` section
- Be specific about what causes the panic

**Good:**
```rust
/// Returns the TypeId for this signature.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if the type_id_index is out of bounds (should never happen for valid signatures).
fn type_id(&self) -> TypeId
```

## Examples

Include examples (`# Examples`) for:
- Public APIs
- Non-obvious usage patterns
- Types with specific initialization requirements
- Functions with multiple valid usage patterns

Use triple backticks with `rust` for proper syntax highlighting.

## Conciseness

- Avoid redundant information (don't restate the obvious from signatures)
- Focus on **why** and **when**, not just **what**
- Keep it brief but complete

## Cross-References

- Use backticks for code elements: `TypeId`, `DynSegment`, `OpLookup`
- Use `[Type]` for links to other documented items
- Link to related functions/types when helpful

## Special Cases

- **Getters/Setters:** Brief description is sufficient ("Returns the X" / "Sets the X")
- **Grammar Productions:** The production itself is sufficient for parser functions
- **Internal/Private Items:** Documentation encouraged but not required; focus on public API clarity
