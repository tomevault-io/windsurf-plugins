**Global Rule: Testing Strategies & Philosophy (Template)**

**Purpose:** To guide the AI in suggesting, generating, and discussing software tests in a manner that aligns with the user's preferred testing methodologies, quality standards, and overall testing strategy.

**Instructions for the AI:**
"When generating, reviewing, or suggesting tests, or when discussing testing strategies, you **must** adhere to the following principles. If the current project has specific testing guidelines or uses particular testing frameworks with established conventions, integrate those and prioritize them."

**1. Overall Testing Goals:**
    * "(User to specify, e.g.:
        * 'The primary goal of testing is to increase confidence in the correctness and reliability of the software.'
        * 'Tests should prevent regressions effectively.'
        * 'Tests serve as a form of living documentation for the code's behavior.'
        * 'Aim for a balanced test suite that provides good coverage without being excessively slow or brittle.')"

**2. Preferred Testing Methodologies:**
    * "(User to specify, e.g.:
        * **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** 'If I indicate a TDD approach, guide me through the red-green-refactor cycle. Help draft failing tests first, then the minimal code to pass, then suggest refactorings.'
        * **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** 'If using BDD, help formulate Gherkin-style scenarios (`Given-When-Then`) or similar user-story-focused tests. Focus on testing observable behavior.'
        * **Test-After Development:** 'If writing tests after implementation, help identify key functionalities and edge cases to cover. Suggest tests that verify existing behavior and protect against future regressions.'
        * 'No strong preference, but ensure comprehensive coverage as appropriate for the context.')"

**3. Test Pyramid & Scope:**
    * "(User to specify emphasis, e.g.:)
        * **Strong emphasis on Unit Tests:** 'A large base of fast, isolated unit tests is preferred. These should form the bulk of the test suite.'
        * **Balanced Approach:** 'Aim for a healthy mix of unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests. The number of tests should decrease as you move up the pyramid (fewer E2E than integration, fewer integration than unit).'
        * **Focus on Integration Tests:** 'For [specific type of project, e.g., API-driven services], robust integration tests are critical and should be prioritized alongside necessary unit tests.'"

**4. Unit Testing Specifics:**
    * **Definition:** "Unit tests should verify the smallest testable parts of an application, isolated from their dependencies."
    * **Scope:** "Focus on a single class, module, or function."
    * **Isolation:** "External dependencies (e.g., database, network, file system, other services) **must** be mocked, stubbed, or faked to ensure tests are fast, deterministic, and isolated. (User to specify preferred mocking/stubbing libraries or techniques for common languages, e.g., `unittest.mock` in Python, `Moq` for C#, `Mockito` for Java, `gMock` for C++)"
    * **Characteristics:** "Good unit tests are Fast, Independent/Isolated, Repeatable, Self-Validating, and Timely (FIRST principles)."

**5. Integration Testing Specifics:**
    * **Purpose:** "Integration tests verify the interactions between two or more components, modules, or services of the application (e.g., interaction with a database, communication between microservices, API endpoint behavior with its underlying logic)."
    * **Scope:** "Test the integration points and contracts between components."
    * **Managing Dependencies:** "(User to specify, e.g., 'For database integration tests, use a dedicated test database or in-memory alternatives if feasible.' 'For external service integration, consider using test doubles like fakes or stubs, or test against controlled test instances of those services.')"

**6. End-to-End (E2E) Testing Specifics:**
    * **Purpose:** "E2E tests validate the entire application flow from the user's perspective, simulating real user scenarios through the UI or API entry points."
    * **When to Use:** "Use sparingly for critical user paths due to their higher cost, slower execution, and potential flakiness."
    * **Scope:** "Cover key workflows and user journeys."
    * **Tools:** "(User to specify preferred E2E testing tools if any, e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, Puppeteer)."

**7. Test Structure & Organization:**
    * **Naming Conventions:**
        * "Test files: (User to specify, e.g., `test_*.py`, `*.spec.ts`, `*_test.go`, `ClassNameTests.cs`)"
        * "Test functions/methods: (User to specify, e.g., `test_should_do_x_when_y()`, `Should_DoX_When_Y()`, `GivenA_WhenB_ThenC()`, `it('should do x when y')`)"
    * **Arrangement:** "(User to specify preferred pattern, e.g.:
        * **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA):** 'Structure tests clearly with distinct Arrange (setup), Act (execution), and Assert (verification) sections.'
        * **Given-When-Then (BDD style):** 'Use comments or structure to reflect this pattern within test methods if applicable.')"
    * **Readability:** "Tests should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. They act as documentation."

**8. Code Coverage:**
    * "(User to specify stance, e.g.:)
