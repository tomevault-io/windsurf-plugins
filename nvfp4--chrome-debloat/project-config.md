# AGENTS.md

This repository contains a terminal user interface application written in Rust (v1.95, edition 2024) and Ratatui (v0.30+).

## Project Structure

```
src/
  app.rs          # Application state and state transitions
  main.rs         # Startup, teardown, top-level error handling
  tui/            # TUI module
    term.rs       # Terminal setup, restore, event loop integration
    event.rs      # Keyboard/mouse/tick/input events
    action.rs     # User/application actions
    ui.rs         # Pure rendering code
    ui_*.rs       # Smaller focused view-specific render code
  chromium/
    detection/    # browser detection module
    policy/       # browser policy read/write module
```

## Commands

* `cargo +nightly fmt --all --check`
* `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
* `cargo build --workspace --all-features`
* `cargo test --workspace --all-features`

Prefer to cross-compile when validating Windows behavior:
* `cargo xwin clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
* `cargo xwin build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

Note: we use nightly rustfmt for enabling `unstable_features`

## Code Guidelines

### Core Rules

* PREFER clear, simple Rust over clever Rust. ALWAYS keep functions small and focused.
* ALWAYS encode invariants in types, not comments. PREFER newtypes, enums, and builders over raw `bool`, `u16`, or `Option` parameters when the meaning matters.
* PREFER expression-oriented Rust without overusing combinators. PREFER `map`, `and_then`, and iterator chains when they clarify data flow; PREFER `match`, `if`, `for`, and early returns when they reduce mental load.
* ALWAYS be explicit about ownership and allocation costs. Borrow for read-only access; accept owned values when a function stores, transforms, or consumes data. Avoid intermediate collections unless they improve clarity.
* PREFER concrete internal functions unless a generic abstraction is clearly worth its compile-time and codegen cost.
* NEVER clone needlessly. ALWAYS clone deliberately at ownership boundaries.
* ALWAYS structure modules for readers. PREFER public entry points near the top, helper types and functions below, and tests at the bottom.
* NEVER use `unsafe` unless it is truly required. ALWAYS isolate required `unsafe`, document the safety invariant, and add tests.
* NEVER use `panic()` or `unwrap()` outside tests and prototypes. PREFER `expect(...)` only when the invariant is obvious and the message explains why failure is impossible.
* PREFER typed errors with `thiserror` in library and domain code. PREFER `anyhow::Result` in application binaries. ALWAYS keep user-facing errors concise and actionable.

## TUI Guidelines

Keep the TUI architecture simple, deterministic, and testable.

* PREFER to enter raw mode, alternate screen, mouse capture, or custom panic hooks in one clearly owned setup path.
* PREFER guard/RAII-style cleanup over scattered teardown calls.
* ALWAYS restore terminal state on all exit paths, including errors and panics where practical.

**Event Loop**
* ALWAYS separate the main loop into:
  1. reading terminal events,
  2. converting events into typed actions,
  3. updating application state,
  4. rendering from state.
* ALWAYS keep input handling, state updates, and rendering separate.
* ALWAYS keep draw frequency reasonable. PREFER coalescing redraws when practical.

**State and Actions**

* ALWAYS represent user input as typed actions, not raw key events passed throughout the app.
* ALWAYS keep state transitions testable. PREFER update functions that take current state plus an action and return the next state or side effect request.
* PREFER keeping IO, subprocesses, timers, and network work outside rendering code.

**Rendering**

* ALWAYS derive rendered UI from application state. NEVER perform business logic, IO, task spawning, or global mutation while rendering.
* PREFER declarative layout and text composition over push/extend-style buffer assembly.
* ALWAYS respect terminal size; ALWAYS handle narrow and short layouts gracefully.
* ALWAYS use Unicode deliberately. NEVER rely on glyphs whose width or availability is inconsistent unless the app provides a fallback.
* ALWAYS render empty, loading, error, and success states explicitly.

```rust
pub fn render(frame: &mut Frame<'_>, app: &App) {
    // Draw the full scene from app state.
    // NEVER read files, spawn tasks, mutate global state, or perform network IO here.
}

fn render_widget(frame: &mut Frame<'_>, area: Rect, app: &App) {
    // Draw a widget into `area` using only app state and local formatting.
}
```

## Cross-Platform Behavior

* ALWAYS make the app behave well on:
  * Linux terminals
  * macOS terminals
  * Windows Terminal and modern Windows consoles
* NEVER make assumptions about:
  * path separators or absolute path formats
  * shell availability or shell syntax
  * terminal dimensions
  * custom color support
  * Unicode width and UTF-8 rendering behavior
  * environment variables such as `HOME`, `USER`, `SHELL`, or `TERM`

* PREFER `Path`, `PathBuf`, and platform-aware standard library APIs instead of string-building paths.
