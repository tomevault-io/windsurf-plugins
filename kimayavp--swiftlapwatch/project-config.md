# SwiftLapWatch

SwiftLapWatch is the Apple Watch companion app for SwiftLap — an iPhone app for swimmers. It tracks laps, heart rate, stroke type, and fatigue during swim workouts, then syncs session data to the SwiftLap backend.

## Stack

- **Language:** Swift
- **UI:** SwiftUI (watchOS)
- **Health data:** HealthKit
- **Platform:** watchOS (watch-only, no iPhone target in this repo)

## Sister repo

The iPhone app and backend live at https://github.com/KimayaVP/SwiftLap.  
**Never edit that repo from this session.** It is read-only context here.

## House rules

- Run a build (`Cmd+B` in Xcode) before opening a PR — no broken builds in review.
- Never push directly to `main`. All changes go through a PR.
- Prefer small, focused commits. One logical change per commit.

## Working with Kimaya

Kimaya is learning iOS/watchOS development. Sahil is her mentor.

**How to collaborate:**
- Explain decisions out loud before making them — don't silently change code.
- Treat Kimaya as a smart beginner: assume she can reason through things, but define jargon the first time you use it (e.g., explain what HealthKit is before referencing it casually).
- If a choice has trade-offs, name them briefly so Kimaya can weigh in.
