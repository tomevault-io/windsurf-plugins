# AGENTS.md — agentgrid Agent-Orchestration Conventions

> How AI coding agents (and the humans steering them) should work inside **this** repo.
> This is the agent-native operating contract for agentgrid itself. Co-evolve it over time.

agentgrid is two products in one repo plus a self-improving harness:

- a **TypeScript CLI** (`src/` → `dist/index.js`) that spawns a grid of AI coding agents, one per tmux pane;
- a **desktop app** (`app/`, Electron + electron-vite + React) — a visual mission-control for those grids;
- a **harness** (`.claude/`, `identity/`, `memory/`, `brain/`) so a coding agent can improve agentgrid using agentgrid's own conventions.

## Directory map (what lives where)

```
src/                  # The CLI — TypeScript, compiled by tsc to dist/
  index.ts            #   commander entry point (the `agentgrid` binary)
  commands/           #   one file per command group: grid, panes, send, broadcast,
                      #     status, dashboard, monitor, presets, sessions, sound,
                      #     harness, harness-gen, agents, init, misc
  lib/                #   shared helpers: tmux.ts, config.ts, constants.ts,
                      #     agents.ts (agent detection), sound.ts
  mcp-server.ts       #   exposes agentgrid as an MCP tool for external orchestration

## Sub-agents available in this repo (`.claude/agents/`)

Use the right one; sub-agents research and review, the parent implements.

| Sub-agent              | Use it for                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `architect`            | grid/IPC/topology design trade-offs before coding       |
| `code-reviewer`        | reviewing a diff before commit                          |
| `test-writer`          | generating vitest/Playwright cases for a new command     |
| `security-reviewer`    | auditing tmux command construction / IPC / hook scripts |
| `performance-analyzer` | terminal-throughput / render perf in the app            |
| `research-agent`       | scouting prior art (e.g. the collaborator analysis)     |
| `loop-auditor`         | auditing long-running monitor/dashboard loops           |

## Build, test, run (must stay green)

CLI (the published package):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build          # tsc → dist/index.js
pnpm test           # vitest, scoped to src/
node dist/index.js --version && node dist/index.js --help   # smoke
bash eval/smoke.sh  # regression eval
```

Desktop app (separate workspace, native node-pty):

```bash
pnpm --dir app install   # builds node-pty via its own postinstall
pnpm --dir app test      # vitest unit tests
pnpm --dir app dev       # run the app locally (electron-vite)
# Playwright e2e: cd app && pnpm exec playwright test
```

## Working conventions

- **Spotify-queue rule:** a follow-up bug discovered while editing a surface goes back to the worker that owns that surface (CLI command files vs app main/renderer modules), not a cold broadcast.
- **Test before signal:** `pnpm build` + `pnpm test` must pass before a change is "done". The app has its own gate (`pnpm --dir app test`).
- **One source of truth:** IPC channels are defined once in `app/packages/shared/src/types.ts` (`IPCChannels`) — never redeclare them. Agent list lives in `src/lib/agents.ts` + `src/lib/constants.ts`.
- **No bespoke focus-stealing:** never `tmux select-pane` in code or scripts — it steals the user's focus.
