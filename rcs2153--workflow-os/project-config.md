# Workflow OS Agent Instructions

This repository uses Workflow OS as the governing layer for Workflow OS work.

If you are a coding agent working in this repository, treat the kernel as the governance boundary and Codex/Claude/human editing as the execution layer.

Core rule:

```text
Agent executes. Workflow OS governs.
```

## Required Posture

- Read `docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md` before implementation or review work.
- Use the relevant roadmap, ADR, implementation plan, report, and review docs before changing files.
- Validate the relevant Workflow OS project or dogfood project before governed work where the task requires it.
- Start or resume the appropriate governed workflow when the task asks for kernel dogfooding or phase execution.
- For material Workflow OS roadmap work, use `npm run dogfood:benchmark -- phase-start --phase <phase>` and `npm run dogfood:benchmark -- phase-close <run-id> --phase <phase>` unless explicitly exempted.
- Treat Workflow OS approval checkpoints as mandatory.
- When `phase-start` emits `approval_handoff_required: true`, preserve and present the complete `approval_handoff` block in the user-facing approval request. Do not replace it with vague prose such as "waiting for approval." If the turn must end while waiting for approval, the final response must include the complete handoff block or a verbatim copy-safe equivalent.
- When `phase-start` emits `copy_safe_approval_request_required: true`, use the emitted copy-safe approval request as the final approval request. Commentary that includes the handoff is not enough if the final response collapses the approval into vague prose.
- Do not ask for approval from an underspecified governed phase handoff. If the handoff does not explain the concrete work being approved, expected scope, strict non-goals, likely touched surfaces, validation expectations, and why the phase is next, stop and report the missing work context instead of asking for approval.
- Preserve deterministic validation, policy gates, durable state, auditability, and final reporting.
- Return structured implementation/review reports in the repository's established format.

## Do Not Bypass Governance

Do not:

- bypass failed validation, denied policy, missing approval, or failed checks;
- invent workflow state, run IDs, approval IDs, evidence references, audit events, work reports, validation results, or command outputs;
- widen phase scope without explicit user approval;
- silently enable local command execution;
- mutate Workflow OS state files by hand to force a result;
- replace deterministic validation with model self-review.

## Current Boundary

Workflow OS currently supports local kernel execution, sequential multi-step runs, approvals, durable local state, selected evidence/report foundations, and explicit local check handler infrastructure.

It does not currently provide:

- recursive agents;
- agent swarms;
- production nested harness execution;
- hosted/distributed runtime;
- automatic local check execution by default;
- write-capable adapters;
- side-effect boundary implementation;
- production self-hosting;
- Level 3/4 autonomy by default.

## Recommended Agent Loop

1. Read the relevant docs and current roadmap state.
2. Validate the relevant Workflow OS project.
3. Start or resume the governed workflow if this is a governed phase, preferably through the repo-local phase runner.
4. Pause for approval when required.
5. Implement only the approved scope.
6. Run required validation commands.
7. Inspect the governed event trail.
8. Report completed scope, deferred scope, validation results, dogfood workflow ID, run ID, approval ID and outcome, event summary, out-of-kernel work, and next recommended phase.

For the detailed user-facing setup path, see `docs/user-guide/agent-harness-quickstart.md`.

For Workflow OS kernel work, use the self-governed build benchmark runbook in `docs/user-guide/self-governed-build-benchmark.md`. The benchmark is the maintained dogfood loop for using the local kernel to govern Workflow OS development while agents and maintainers execute the work.
