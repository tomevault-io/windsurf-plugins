# Gemini TUI Writer

## Project Overview

A TUI that you run to transcribe and edit text. It's like a companion that dictates for you, engaging in a dialogue to collaboratively update a block of text rather than performing a direct transcription.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

### Installation

This project uses `nbdev`, so installation typically involves cloning the repository and running `nbdev_install_hooks` and `nbdev_prepare`.

```bash
conda create -n tui_writer python=3.10 -y
conda activate tui_writer
uv pip install -e .
```

### Running the Application

If the application is exported from `nbdev` notebooks, you might run it directly as a Python module.

## Development Conventions

This project uses `nbdev` for development, testing, and documentation. All code is written in Jupyter notebooks and exported to Python modules.
