# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

This repo *is* a single Codex skill package named `graph-engineer` (plus its
README/LICENSE). There is no application code, no build step, no test suite, and no
package manifest — the repo's only artifact is the skill definition itself:

```
skills/graph-engineer/
├── SKILL.md                       # the skill's instructions (source of truth)
└── references/
    ├── goal-templates.md              # ready-to-use /goal templates per scenario
    ├── quality-gate-detection.md      # generic quality-gate command resolver algorithm
    ├── elevated-assurance.md          # optional opt-in multi-lens CRITIQUE variant
    └── sources.md                     # provenance: what's official Anthropic/OpenAI vs. not
```

`README.md` at the repo root is the human-facing explanation of the same skill and
must stay consistent with `skills/graph-engineer/SKILL.md` — they describe the same
8-node cycle from two angles (marketing/usage vs. operational instructions). When
editing one, check whether the other needs a matching update (e.g. node numbering,
flag names, the anti-loop cutoff wording).

## Working in this repo

There is nothing to build, lint, or test. "Development" here means editing Markdown
(`SKILL.md`, `README.md`, the reference files) and keeping the following
consistent across all of them:

- The 8-node cycle order and names: PRE-FLIGHT → SPEC → IMPL → QUALITY GATE → CRITIQUE
  → DEBATE/TRIAGE → REFACTOR → VERIFY.
- The single entry point claim: every Codex interaction routes through the
  `codex:codex-rescue` subagent — no other `/codex:*` command is invoked
  programmatically by this skill.
- The pinned plugin version (`openai-codex` v1.0.6) that the routing assumptions were
  verified against. If that version changes, `README.md`, `SKILL.md`, and
  `sources.md` all reference it and need to move together. Elevated assurance's
  fan-in barrier specifically depends on this version's `--resume-last` semantics
  (see `sources.md`'s Verification method section) — a plugin update that adds
  resume-by-thread-ID could relax that barrier's requirements, but don't assume it
  without re-verifying the source.

## Core design invariant

**Codex never edits implementation files with Edit/Write anywhere in the cycle** —
only Codex does, via `codex:codex-rescue --write`. `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` in the
*consuming* repo is Codex's only writable artifact across the entire cycle:
PRE-FLIGHT writes the `### Quality gate` resolution metadata there, SPEC writes
the feature contract there, and (in write-authorized modes) PRE-FLIGHT/SPEC also
finalize the `### Critique assurance` resolution there before IMPL — see
`references/elevated-assurance.md`. All three are namespaced per feature under
the applicable `## <feature-name>` heading, and `### Critique assurance` is a
finalized resolution, not a runtime progress log — don't have any node write
intermediate elevated-assurance state (which lens finished, whether
canonicalization happened yet) to `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Any change to `SKILL.md`
that would have Codex editing code directly breaks the reasons this skill
exists: preserving Codex's context/tokens for orchestration and judgment,
reducing correlated self-review failure by putting Codex in the arbitration
path, and specializing Codex and Codex into explicit writer/reviewer and
contract/triage roles.

Related invariants worth preserving when editing `SKILL.md`:

- CRITIQUE calls never pass `--write` — this is enforced by the underlying
  `codex-companion.mjs` sandbox (`workspace-write` vs `read-only`), not just a prompt
  convention. Don't describe it as a soft/optional guarantee. This includes every
  elevated-assurance lens and the exit challenger — none of them ever pass `--write`.
- After the first CRITIQUE in a cycle, every subsequent CRITIQUE and normal REFACTOR
  call passes `--resume-last` so Codex retains its own prior findings and Codex's
  triage decisions. The documented REFACTOR exception applies if a resumed read-only
  session rejects `--resume-last --write`: compare a before/after snapshot (untracked
  status, tracked diff, content hashes — `git diff --check` alone doesn't prove
  nothing changed) and, only if they match, start a fresh non-resumed session with
  `--write` from the beginning instead of retrying the resume. Elevated assurance adds
  further exceptions to the blanket "every subsequent call resumes" rule: the initial
  3 lenses are fresh, the canonicalization call after fan-in is fresh, and the exit
  challenger is fresh and deliberately becomes the new canonical thread — only the
  calls between those points resume as usual.
- DEBATE (node 5) must classify every finding as valid / debatable / false positive —
  never a flat pass/fail — and false-positive rulings need one line of written
  justification, not silent discard. This holds under elevated assurance too:
  cross-lens corroboration is recorded as metadata only, never as a fourth verdict,
  and never as a substitute for evidence.
- The anti-loop cutoff (two consecutive CRITIQUE rounds restating the same underlying
