# AgentCompass documentation guide

This file applies to everything under `docs/`.

## Source of truth

Use the following sources in order:

1. `docs/docs.json` for site structure and navigation.
2. Existing pages in the same section for terminology and style.
3. AgentCompass implementation and configuration for behavior, defaults, and
   supported components.
4. Upstream project documentation for provider-specific behavior.

Do not guess commands, flags, defaults, or compatibility. Verify details against
the implementation before documenting them.

## Public environment boundary

Public documentation may describe public environment providers:
`host_process`, `docker`, `daytona`, `modal`, and `opensandbox`.

Classify a provider by its deployment and access boundary, not by the SDK or
protocol it implements. `opensandbox` is public because it targets the generic
OpenSandbox interface. `hsandbox` is internal because it depends on the private
H platform control plane, project credentials, and platform-managed mounts,
even though it uses the OpenSandbox SDK for sandbox operations.

Internal providers are `brainpp`, `pcluster`, `hbox`, `hsandbox`, and
Env-Gateway. Do not mention them in publishable pages, navigation, snippets, or
assets under `docs/`. This contributor guide names them only to define the
boundary. Do not publish internal executable paths, service endpoints, image
names, credentials, mount points, or setup procedures. Keep that material in
the internal configuration repository instead.

Recipes that target an internal provider or depend on internal infrastructure
belong in the internal configuration repository and must not be registered as
builtin recipes under `src/agentcompass/recipes`. Public documentation may
describe only recipes that target public providers.

## Structure and localization

- Keep English pages under `docs/en/<section>/`.
- Keep Chinese pages under `docs/zh/<section>/`.
- Keep the same relative page path in both languages.
- Under `developer_guide/`, mirror the navigation groups with `architecture/`,
  `extensions/`, and `contributing/`; use `overview.mdx` for a group landing page.
- Treat each language as independently maintained content. Do not mix languages
  within a page.
- Store assets shared by both languages under `docs/images/`.
- Store reusable interactive MDX/JSX components under `docs/snippets/`.
- Use root-relative internal links without file extensions. English links start
  with `/en/`; Chinese links start with `/zh/`.

When you add, move, or remove a page, update both languages, all affected links,
and `docs/docs.json`.

## Navigation

- Organize related pages with shallow, nested groups in `docs/docs.json`.
- Add an icon to each tab and top-level section group.
- Do not add icons to nested groups inside a section.
- Do not add `icon` to page frontmatter. Page hierarchy supplies the visual
  indentation.
- Do not add leading whitespace to group or page titles to simulate nesting.
- Add redirects when a published path changes.
- Import shared interactive components with a root-relative path and pass
  locale-specific content explicitly.

## Writing guidelines

- Lead with the reader's goal, then provide the steps.
- Address the reader as "you".
- Use direct language and active voice (e.g. "Run the command" not "The command should be run").
- Keep headings and sections short and scannable.
- Use consistent AgentCompass component IDs and terminology.
- In Chinese pages, translate ordinary English terms, but retain product names, acronyms, code identifiers, and the project terms `agent`, `Model`, `Benchmark`, `Harness`, `Environment`, `Recipe`, `runtime`, `provider`, and `sandbox`.
- When listing the four core components, always use the order Model, Benchmark, Harness, Environment. Preserve lowercase `model` when it is a code identifier and preserve the actual `BENCHMARK HARNESS MODEL` positional syntax in commands and syntax descriptions.
- Keep examples copyable and test them when practical.
- Do not put a long command, path-plus-symbol reference, or deeply nested field
  chain in one inline-code span. Put copyable commands and path templates in a
  fenced block, separate a source file from its symbol, and describe nested
  lookups one level at a time.
- In prose, use the shortest identifier that preserves meaning. Prefer “the
  `_run_attempts` method of `UnifiedEvaluationRuntime`” to one combined
  `UnifiedEvaluationRuntime._run_attempts` span, and link to the source map
  instead of repeating a full path when the path is not needed.
- Add language identifiers to fenced code blocks and descriptive alt text to
  images.
- Keep each Chinese prose paragraph on one source line, including list items
  and prose inside MDX components. Soft line breaks can render as visible
  spaces in Chinese text.
- Avoid filler, marketing language, decorative emoji, and repeated summaries.

Every MDX page requires frontmatter with a clear `title`. Do not add a
`description` field; put the page summary in the first paragraph below the
frontmatter instead.

## Before submitting

From the documentation root, run:

```bash
cd docs
mint broken-links
mint validate
```

Also verify that English and Chinese page paths remain symmetric and every
published page appears in `docs.json`.
