# TokensBurned

TokensBurned publishes aggregate AI coding token usage as a live GitHub profile card.

- Use the bundled `connect`, `backfill`, `server`, `privacy`, `update`, and `doctor` skills only for matching user requests.
- Treat ambiguous privacy requests as read-only status checks. Never publish or install an update silently.
- For Gemini CLI collection, prefer the official OpenTelemetry GenAI stream with prompt logging disabled.
- Never upload prompts, responses, source code, repository names, transcript paths, API keys, or raw session files.
- Keep harness, provider, and model as separate identities.
