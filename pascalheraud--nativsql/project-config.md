# NativSQL Development Rules

## GOLDEN RULE - NO GIT OPERATIONS
NEVER perform any git operations (commit, push, rebase, reset, branch deletion, force operations, etc.).
This is strictly forbidden and non-negotiable.

If code needs modification, use file editing tools only (Read, Edit, Write tools).
Do not use git under any circumstances.

This projects builds with gradle.

## Code Modification Guidelines
- Always use Read/Edit/Write tools for file changes
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Never create unnecessary files or documentation unless explicitly requested
- Avoid over-engineering - keep solutions simple and focused on the immediate task

## File Operations
- Before editing, read the file first with the Read tool
- Use Edit tool for targeted replacements with clear context
- Use Write tool only when overwriting entire files or creating new ones
- Always specify absolute paths, never relative paths

## Task Management
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress on multi-step tasks
- Mark tasks as in_progress before starting work
- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing
- Only have ONE task in_progress at a time

## When to Use Agents
- Use Task tool with specialized agents (Explore, Plan, Bash) for complex multi-step operations
- Use Bash agent for terminal operations and command execution
- Use Explore agent for codebase navigation and search operations
- Never use agents for simple file edits that can be done with Read/Edit/Write

## Communication Style
- Output text directly for communication (no tool use for printing messages)
- Be concise and clear
- Provide code references in markdown format: `file.java:42` or [FileName.java:42](path/to/FileName.java#L42)

# NativeSQL Coding Standards

## Exception Handling
- Never use `catch(Exception e)` - be specific about exceptions you catch
- Only catch exceptions you actually handle
- Prefer letting unexpected exceptions propagate
- Use specific exception types: `SQLException`, `IllegalArgumentException`, etc.
- For checked exceptions, either handle them or declare them in `throws`

## Visibility & Encapsulation
- Make methods `private` by default, only use `protected` or `public` when necessary
- Make fields `private` - use getters if external access is needed
- Methods that are only used internally should not be public
- Package-private methods should only be used within the same package

## Field Accessor Pattern
- `FieldAccessor` should be stateless - instance context must be passed as method parameters
- Use `getValue(Object instance)` and `setValue(Object instance, Object value)` signatures
- Instance-specific state should never be stored in the accessor itself

## Repository & Caching
- Cache field metadata per repository instance using a `Fields` object
- Initialize `Fields entityFields` in the repository constructor: `this.entityFields = ReflectionUtils.getFields(entityClass)`
- Do not use static/global caches for field metadata
- Field lookups should use the cached `entityFields` object for O(1) access

## Association Loading
- Use batch loading with IN clauses instead of N+1 queries
- Consolidate single-entity and batch-entity loading paths into one method
- Validate configuration early (fail-fast):
  - Throw exception if `Association` configuration is missing required columns
  - Throw exception if annotation is missing or field doesn't exist
  - Never silently skip with `continue`

## OneToMany Annotation
- Only specify `mappedBy()` and `repository()` in the annotation
- Derive target entity from repository's generic type parameter using reflection
- Never require redundant `targetEntity()` configuration
- Repository access must be explicit via `association.getRepositoryClass()`

## Code Simplification
- Extract helper methods to reduce complexity in main logic
- Separate concerns into dedicated methods (e.g., `ensureForeignKeyInColumns()`)
- Avoid intermediate variable assignments when possible
- Use streams and functional APIs where they improve readability

## Overengineering Avoidance
- Don't add features beyond what's explicitly requested
- Don't refactor surrounding code unless necessary
- Don't add error handling for impossible scenarios
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees
- Validate only at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)

## CRITICAL RULES (Non-negotiable)

### Explicit Braces ALWAYS
```java
// ✅ REQUIRED
if (condition) {
    statement;
}

// ❌ NEVER
if (condition) statement;
```

### Jakarta Annotations ONLY
Use Jakarta namespace annotations, not javax

### Database-Agnostic Names
- Use dbTypeName not pgTypeName
- Use "database" not "PostgreSQL" in comments
- Use DatabaseDialect interface (generic code)
- Use PostgresDialect implementation (only in db/postgres/ package)

### PGobject ONLY in db/postgres/ Package
- ❌ Never import org.postgresql.util.PGobject outside postgres/
- ❌ Never use :: casting syntax outside PostgresDialect
- ✅ Always delegate through DatabaseDialect interface
