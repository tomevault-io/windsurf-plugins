Read before coding:
- Refer to `/docs` for any context or patterns before implementation.

Design priorities (in order): dev experience, simplicity, fit with underlying APIs, API quality, testability, best practices.

Structure/complexity:
- Keep modules around ~500 lines and functions around ~20 cyclomatic complexity.
- Split modules/functions intelligently to avoid high complexity or large files.
- If splitting would reduce clarity, ask for a decision before doing it.

Hard rules:
- Avoid dataclasses unless there is a clear, documented benefit.
- Avoid runtime type/attribute checks (hasattr/getattr/isinstance/EAFP-with-pass).
- No silent EAFP; `except AttributeError: pass` is forbidden.
- Use `uv run python` (never plain `python`).
- Define and use explicit Protocols/adapters for interfaces; validate at boundaries instead of ad-hoc attribute probes.
- Ordinary gameplay turns must remain LLM-proposal-first. Do not introduce parser-first or command-table-first routing for normal story turns.
- Deterministic systems are commit authorities for NPC initial locations, NPC stable traits, timed story events, player characteristics, item locations/characteristics, map topology/room characteristics, story goals, puzzles, clues, and world-state mutations through the fact store. LLM outputs may propose dialogue, action framing, and bounded consequences around those facts; deterministic code validates and commits accepted deltas.
- Parser handling must stay limited to control-plane commands (`save`, `load`, `quit`, `help`). Ordinary gameplay turns must not degrade into parser-authored substitutes.
- NPC dialogue should generally be LLM-authored from deterministic context. If the runtime cannot obtain an LLM-authored conversational proposal, fail closed for that turn rather than fabricating deterministic NPC dialogue or narrator scaffolding.
- LLM-authored NPC dialogue must answer in character rather than merely restating or paraphrasing the player's prompt. Prompt-parroting conversational payloads are coherence failures and must be rejected before display.
- When the player directly addresses or questions a visible NPC, the accepted conversational proposal must come back with that NPC as the dialogue speaker. Do not surface player-speech echoes or narrator summaries in place of the NPC reply.
- Opening prose, turn narration, NPC dialogue, and in-scope action framing should be LLM-authored from deterministic facts. Do not let narration invent parallel state that is not representable in the fact store.
- If accepted LLM narration explicitly introduces a bounded state change, convert that prose into validated fact-store ops before finalizing the turn. Do not leave visible item/location/relationship changes as prose-only state.
- Do not auto-target the nearest NPC for unrelated player actions. If the player did not clearly address someone, the LLM path should stay narrator-scoped or ask for clarification.
- Preserve protagonist/assistant identity continuity in narrator context and output editing. Do not let room-entry or reviewed prose invent replacement names for already-canonical characters.
- Mystery bootstrap/opening should preserve a canonical male detective identity and name consistently across opening prose, turn narration, and reviewed output. Use `Detective Elias Wren` unless an explicitly approved contract changes that canon everywhere.
- Preserve role and clue continuity across bootstrap text, opening text, and turn-based text. Do not let the same character be both assistant and suspect at once without an explicit in-story change, and do not let the same clue be both held by a character and simultaneously placed elsewhere in the scene.
- Opening/bootstrap planning should prefer a single cached story-bootstrap agent call over multiple narrow planning calls. Do not reintroduce seeded setup/objective/public-setting text as the authoritative runtime story plan.
- The player must be allowed to attempt any gameplay action or story move. Do not treat surprising, disruptive, or goal-breaking prompts as forbidden at the gameplay layer.
- High-impact actions must require explicit confirmation before state mutation only when they would break the current story goals beyond repair.
- When confirmation is required, interrupt before generating the official LLM-authored response to the original prompt. On `PROCEED`, commit disruption facts, replan if needed, then generate the official response to that same player prompt.
- If the player prompt does not break current goals beyond repair, the engine must adapt the fact database and story state to the prompt rather than refusing it as out-of-scope.
- Preserve explicit typed proposal/validation boundaries. Prefer contract types and adapters for runtime turn proposals over ad-hoc dict plumbing or special-case command branches.
- Goals, clues, puzzle state, NPC locations, NPC relationships, discovered leads, event flags, reveal state, and item possession/location must remain assertable/retractable fact-store data, and narration must read from those facts rather than carrying its own competing truth.
