- `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies and project configuration
- `README.md`: Project documentation and setup instructions
- `test_*.py`: Python test files matching the naming convention for test discovery

## Key Guidelines

1. Follow Python best practices and idiomatic patterns
2. Maintain existing code structure and organization
3. Write unit tests for new functionality.
4. Document changes to environment variables in the `README.md` file.
