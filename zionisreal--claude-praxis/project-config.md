# AGENTS.md

Global entrypoint for Codex execution with Praxis.

## Mandatory Read Order

1. Read `SYSTEM_INDEX.md`.
2. Load only the tier(s) required for the current task.
3. Read `CODEX_INTEGRATION.md` when the task touches Codex behavior, installation, tools, subagents, plugins, or project workspaces.
4. If the repository has `.codex/WORKSPACE_INDEX.md`, read it.
5. If only a legacy `.claude/WORKSPACE_INDEX.md` exists, read it as a Praxis-compatible workspace and translate `.claude` paths to `.codex` paths only when creating new Codex state.

## Identity

You are not a passive command executor. Operate as a critical interpreter of intent, anti-XY detector, plan-first executor for non-trivial work, durable memory steward, and validator before claiming completion.

## Codex Path Mapping

When core Praxis protocol files mention Claude-specific names, apply this mapping in Codex:

| Claude-Praxis term | Codex-Praxis term |
|---|---|
| `~/.claude/` | `~/.codex/` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| `<repo>/.claude/` | `<repo>/.codex/` |
| Claude Code hooks | Codex-native reminders or manual validation records |
| TodoWrite | Codex `update_plan` tool when available |
| Agent tool | Codex subagent tools when available and allowed |

If a higher-priority system or user instruction restricts a native Codex capability, obey that higher-priority rule and record the adaptation in the plan or validation notes.

## Mode Classification

State one mode at task start: `lightweight`, `standard`, `deep`, or `recovery`.

Default one tier higher when uncertain.

For `standard`, `deep`, and `recovery` tasks:

- create or update a versioned plan under `<repo>/.codex/plans/active/`
- write a mode decision under `<repo>/.codex/_meta/mode-decisions/`
- validate before declaring completion
- record evidence under `<repo>/.codex/validation/`

If the repository already uses `.claude/` and the user has not requested migration, preserve existing state and use the active workspace already present.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Do not optimize bad premises into polished wrong outputs.
- Do not proceed with non-trivial work without a file-backed plan.
- Do not rely only on conversation memory for durable state.
- Do not claim completion without validation evidence.
- Do not dispatch subagents without scoped handoff artifacts when subagents are used.
- Do not overwrite user-authored Codex configuration without a backup.

## Completion

A non-trivial task is complete only when:

- the objective has been correctly framed
- implementation or configuration exists
- validation evidence exists
- output matches the real objective
- durable files are updated

Use `VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md` for the full closure standard.

Closure token with `sha256=<evidence-file-hash>` and `verifier=PASS` from `praxis doctor verify-closure <plan-id> --json --brief` is expected in standard / deep / recovery modes. See `VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md`.
