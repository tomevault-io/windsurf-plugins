# Agent instructions

Maintain this as a small, reliable public open-source project. Read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and validation and
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for trust boundaries and private reporting.

## Protect private data

- Treat tracked files, commit metadata, issues, pull requests, CI output, and
  release archives as public. Review each surface before publishing to it.
- Use synthetic examples and fixtures. Never copy real conversations, desktop
  captures, audio, transcripts, runtime traces, credentials, private session
  links, personal email addresses, or machine-specific paths into public files.
- Keep necessary local investigation artifacts under ignored `docs/private/`
  or `benchmarks/`, with restrictive permissions. Do not add internal handoffs,
  audit evidence, experiment journals, or generated logs to the repository.
  Ignored files are still private: do not upload or package them.
- Use your own GitHub noreply identity for both author and committer metadata.
  Preserve contributor credit; do not impersonate another contributor.
- Report findings by file and rule, without echoing secret values. Scanners
  supplement manual review and cannot guarantee that data is safe to publish.
- If a real credential is exposed, stop publishing the affected material,
  report it privately, and arrange revocation or rotation. Removing a file does
  not remove its history. Explain any retained fork, clone, or GitHub cache
  exposure; do not claim those copies have been erased.

## Keep the project lean and dependable

- Prefer focused changes and existing abstractions. Add dependencies only for
  a concrete need; consider maintenance, compatibility, and licensing costs.
- Keep the README focused on installation and use. Put durable reference
  material in the relevant existing guide; avoid duplicate development docs.
- Remove obsolete tooling, dead code, and orphaned tests together. Keep tests
  that protect user behavior, failure handling, privacy, and security boundaries.
  Test count alone is not a reason to remove coverage.
- Use temporary directories, fake providers, and mocked desktop/audio services
  in automated tests. Keep tests offline and independent of personal accounts,
  API keys, microphones, screens, and a running desktop. Paid or live integration
  checks must remain explicit opt-ins.
- Preserve policy checks, confirmation boundaries, path restrictions, and
  sandboxing. Fix the test environment instead of weakening production controls.
- Update user documentation when behavior changes. Keep supported Python
  versions, package metadata, installers, and CI consistent. Preserve licenses
  and attribution; document material limitations without overstating guarantees.

## Publish only reviewed work

- Inspect the current branch, working tree, and remote heads first. Preserve
  unrelated and concurrent edits. Use a separate clean worktree when a checkout
  contains unfinished work; never reset, clean, or stash it indiscriminately.
- The camera companion is part of the public application. Review its runtime,
  integration, documentation, and regression tests with the same publication
  checks as voice. Camera samples, transcripts, benchmark runs, and local audit
  evidence remain private and must never be published or packaged.
- Enable repository hooks with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Stage
  explicit paths, review `git diff --cached`, and run:

  ```sh
  git diff --cached --check
  python3 tools/check_public_files.py --staged
  ```

- Before pushing, scan the complete ancestry of every proposed branch or tag
  with `python3 tools/check_public_files.py --history <revision>`. Check commit
  messages and identities as well as file contents. Do not bypass failed hooks
  or privacy CI, and do not reintroduce old unsanitized ancestry through a merge.
- Run the relevant checks in CONTRIBUTING.md. Code changes require the behavior
  suite; docs-only edits need link, whitespace, and publication checks. For
  packaging changes, inspect both source and wheel archives for private files.
- Push only explicitly intended refs to the verified remote. Do not use blanket
  `--all` or `--mirror` pushes. History rewrites and branch deletion need explicit
  authorization; use exact leases for authorized force pushes.
- Follow the maintainer's existing authorization without asking again for the
  same action. After publishing, verify remote heads and required CI, and report
  the actual result and any remaining limitations.

## Code Review Rules

- Flag private data in content or metadata, real-data fixtures, and changes that
  allow private artifacts into source archives, wheels, logs, or CI output.
- Flag bypassed publication checks, weakened execution boundaries, and removed
  regression coverage without an equivalent check or removed feature.
- Flag publication of camera samples, evaluation artifacts, or unrelated local changes.
