# Tale

The canonical contract for working in this repository lives in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) at the
repo root. **Read it in full and follow it.** It defines how to work, the Definition of Done, the
Ripple Map ("change X → also touch Y"), the mandatory verification doctrine, the coding standards for
every language and framework here, and an index of deep guides.

Key reflexes, summarized (the full rules and rationale are in `AGENTS.md`):

- **Look before you build.** Reuse/extend existing code — search `packages/ui`, then shared
  `app/`/`lib/`, then the feature — before writing anything new. Don't reinvent or fork primitives.
- **A change is rarely one file.** Translations ship in all base locales (`en`/`de`/`fr`), docs ship
  with code, data-model changes ship a migration, UI changes meet WCAG 2.1 AA, and everything carries
  its test. Walk the Ripple Map.
- **Verify, don't assume.** A change is done when you've observed the expected outcome, not when the
  code looks right.
- **Think first.** Classify the task (fix / refactor / feature / review), weigh impact, prefer the
  smallest correct, most reversible change. Never make a radical change without understanding its
  blast radius.
