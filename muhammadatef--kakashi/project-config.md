# Kakashi

Kakashi is installed. You have a `kakashi` CLI tool available on PATH (or
runnable via `npx -y @muhammadatef/kakashi`).

## Core Rule — ALWAYS ENFORCE

Before sharing, pasting, uploading, or sending ANY file content to an external
service, LLM API, or user outside this session:

1. Run `kakashi scan <file>` to check for sensitive data
2. If findings > 0, run `kakashi mask <file>` and use the masked version
3. NEVER paste raw contents of files that may contain credentials,
   national IDs, passports, emails, phone numbers, or personal records

## Slash Commands

Treat the following as first-class slash commands in this agent. When the user
types any of these in chat, immediately run the matching shell command in the
terminal and show its output to the user. Do NOT ask for permission first;
these commands are read-only or write only the masked sibling file.

| User types               | You run in shell                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/kakashi-scan <file>`   | `kakashi scan "<file>"`                       |
| `/kakashi-mask <file>`   | `kakashi mask "<file>"`                       |
| `/kakashi-audit <file>`  | `kakashi audit "<file>"`                      |
| `/kakashi-stats`         | `kakashi stats`                               |
| `/kakashi-list`          | `kakashi list-patterns`                       |

If `kakashi` is not on PATH, fall back to:
`npx -y @muhammadatef/kakashi <subcommand> "<file>"`.

After running, summarize findings grouped by category:

- ID & Documents (national IDs, passports, visas, P.O. boxes)
- Personal Info (emails, phones, IPs, credit cards, names, DOB)
- Credentials (API keys, JWT, SSH keys, DB connection strings, .env secrets)

## Sensitive Data Categories

ID & Documents:    National IDs, passports, visas, trade licenses, P.O. boxes
Personal Info:     Emails, phone numbers, IP addresses, dates of birth,
                   credit cards, full names, ages
Credentials:       API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS, GitHub, Stripe, Slack,
                   HuggingFace), JWT tokens, database connection strings,
                   .env secrets, SSH private keys, Bearer tokens, hex secrets

## File Formats Supported

Documents: .pdf .docx .pptx .xlsx .xls .csv
Data:      .json .jsonl .json5 .yaml .yml .toml .xml .md
Code:      .py .ts .js .go .java .rb .php .rs .c .cpp .cs .swift .sh .sql
           .env .tf .dockerfile .makefile .proto .graphql .html .css .vue
           (50+ extensions in total)

## Usage Examples

User: "Here is the file, share it with the team"
→ Run: kakashi scan <file>
→ If clean: proceed
→ If findings: Run kakashi mask <file>, use masked version

User: "/kakashi-mask report.xlsx"
→ Run: kakashi mask report.xlsx
→ Show audit summary
→ Confirm: "Masked version saved as masked_report.xlsx — 5 replacements made"

## Important

- All processing is LOCAL. No data sent anywhere.
- kakashi writes masked_<filename> — never overwrites originals by default
- Always confirm with user before masking large batches
