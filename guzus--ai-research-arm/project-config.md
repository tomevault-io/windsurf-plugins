# AGENTS.md

Agents working in this repo: read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — it is the
full operating guide (pipeline architecture, workflows, output
locations, authentication, and the load-bearing rules). This file is a
short pointer plus the few genuinely agent-specific notes.

## Agent-specific notes

- **Scheduled model workflows** use the Claude-harness `.github/actions/agent-run`
  directly or, for RSS, community, arXiv, Bluesky, and wiki, the trusted
  `.github/actions/agent-dispatch`. Those five reference the shared
  `research-editorial` route, so its backend profile can select a registered
  isolated editorial adapter without workflow edits. Two registered
  compatible adapters exist: strict OpenCode Go (the current production
  default) and Cursor CLI (`cursor-grok-4p6-fast`, Grok 4.6 Fast). Host-checkout
  `agent-run` is deliberately capability-incompatible and rejected. While the
  OpenCode profile is selected, one key/cap failure can stale all five together. Direct
  Claude workflows may still use
  `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`; when they do, pass the model via
  `claude_args`, never as a separate `model:` input:

  ```yaml
  # Correct (v1)
  claude_args: "--model claude-sonnet-5"

  # Wrong (do not use a separate model input here)
  model: <versioned-model-name>
  ```

  (action repo: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action)

- **GLM-5.2 is the preferred fallback for Claude-harness content lanes.** The
  five editorial lanes are routed as a group; their current strict profile runs
  the containerized OpenCode CLI at `opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash`. Known
  credential slots are prewired for a future isolated adapter, but the current
  host-checkout `agent-run` profiles cannot be selected by this route. `agent-run`
  probes the requested provider and walks the ordered `fallback.chain` from
  `data/agent-backends.json` when it is unavailable (currently native Claude →
  Z.ai GLM); lanes marked `"strict": true` and `fireworks-fallback:
  none` runs never fall back. Set `expected-paths` in `agent-run`, or call
  `.github/actions/require-output` after deterministic commit steps, so green
  no-op runs do not leave the freshness watchdog stale. RSS, HN/Reddit
  community, arXiv, Bluesky, and wiki fail closed; only daily-digest has a
  deterministic publishing fallback. Check the agent/fallback step logs before
  drawing provider conclusions.

- **Backend routing SSOT: `data/agent-backends.json`.** Every model lane,
  the backend profile table, and the ordered `fallback.chain` are defined
  there. Runtime-dispatched lanes resolve lane → route → backend profile;
  `.github/actions/agent-dispatch` selects the registered adapter while
  `agent-run` lanes select at runtime via `scripts/select_backend.py`
  (workflow steps pass `lane:` and all provider secrets — editing the file
  re-routes or re-orders fallbacks with no workflow change; on provider
  outage the chain is walked in order and the first available candidate
  runs); pi, opencode, and direct claude-code-action lanes are CI-enforced mirrors;
  strict lanes (zai-canary) never fall back. After any routing change run
  `uv run python scripts/build_backend_matrix.py` to regenerate
  `docs/backend-matrix.md` (CI runs `--check` and fails on drift, missing
  secrets, orphan lanes, or mirror divergence).
  To switch all five editorial lanes, edit only
  `routes.research-editorial.backend` to a pre-registered compatible backend,
  then run the generator. To split one lane, change only that lane's `route`
  reference (define the new route/profile first when needed).

- **Z.ai GLM-5.2** is available through `agent-run` as `zai-glm-5p2` using
  `ZAI_API_KEY` and Claude Code's Anthropic-compatible route. It is the
  preferred manual `hourly-twitter.yml` backend and writes to
  `research/twitter-zai/`; use `zai-claude-code-canary.yml` for focused
  provider diagnostics.

- **Codex generative-research workflows** use the Codex CLI with
  ChatGPT-managed file auth, not OpenAI API billing. Seed the workflow
  from `CODEX_AUTH_JSON`, whose value is the file-backed
  `~/.codex/auth.json` produced by `codex login`:

  ```bash
  codex login
  jq '{auth_mode, has_refresh_token: ((.tokens.refresh_token // "") != "")}' ~/.codex/auth.json
  ```

  Treat `auth.json` like a password. Do not commit it, print it, or share
  one copy across concurrent jobs. Do not switch this lane to
  `openai-api-key` unless the intent is API billing instead of the
  ChatGPT/Codex subscription.

- **OpenCode + DeepSeek V4 Flash runs** use the opencode CLI
  (pinned `opencode-ai@1.18.3`) driving `deepseek-v4-flash` with plain env-var
  auth — a single secret is the whole login; there is no `opencode auth
  login` step and no auth-file seeding. The workflow resolves the route
  exclusively through `OPENCODE_API_KEY` (OpenCode Go subscription — sign in
  at https://opencode.ai/auth, subscribe, copy the key). The Go plan caps are
  $12/5h, $30/week, and $60/month; because RSS, community, arXiv, Bluesky, and
