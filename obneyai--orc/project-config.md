## Project Overview

ORC (Orchestrator) is a behavior-tree-based workflow execution engine built on the Grain event-sourcing framework. It provides composable primitives for building, optimizing, and evaluating LLM-powered workflows.

**Top namespace**: `ai.obney.orc`

This is a **library** — no web layer, no auth, no database config. Consumers pull it in as a git dep and provide their own Grain infrastructure (event store, cache, web server).

> **Read first:** [`docs/ORC-PRINCIPLES.md`](docs/ORC-PRINCIPLES.md) — the durable, framework-level principles for thinking about and building with ORC (the node palette, composition via `:delegate`, events-first discipline, fitness-gate-as-objective, adversarial verification). Read it before designing or verifying a workflow.

## Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **orc-service** | Core behavior tree execution engine, DSL for workflow building, event-sourced state |
| **gepa** | LLM instruction optimization with Pareto frontier selection |
| **evaluation** | LLM-as-judge evaluation with grounding, reasoning, completeness judges |
| **colbert** | Late-interaction retrieval via Python ColBERT bridge |
| **ontology** | Three-layer concept graph with embeddings and pattern discovery; also a general-purpose evolutionary ontology extractor for JSON / CSV / SQL sources |
| **mcp-sheet-builder** | Dynamic workflow generation from MCP tool schemas |

## Architecture

Built on **Grain v2** (event sourcing + CQRS):
- `defcommand` — validate and emit events
- `defreadmodel` — project events into queryable state
- `defquery` — compose read models, return data
- `defprocessor` — event-driven side effects (auto-registered)
- `defperiodic` — scheduled trigger events (auto-registered)

## Development Setup

```bash
# Start nREPL
clj -M:dev -m nrepl.cmdline --port 7888
```

## Running Tests

```bash
clj -M:poly test                    # changed bricks only
clj -M:poly test :all-bricks        # all bricks
clj -M:poly test brick:orc-service  # specific brick
```

## Consumer Usage

Add to your project's `deps.edn`:

```clojure
obneyai/orc {:git/url "https://github.com/ObneyAI/orc.git"
             :git/sha "..."
             :deps/root "projects/orc"}
```

Then require components:

```clojure
(require '[ai.obney.orc.orc-service.interface :as orc])
(require '[ai.obney.orc.gepa.interface :as gepa])
```

## RLM Generalization Benchmark

The repo includes an end-to-end benchmark suite that demonstrates ORC RLM (`emit-tree!`) genuinely adapts behavior tree design to task type:

- Entry point: [`development/bench/README.md`](development/bench/README.md)
- Headline report: [`development/bench/RESULTS.md`](development/bench/RESULTS.md)
- Runner: `development/bench/runner.clj`
- Aggregator: `development/bench/all.clj`
- Per-task examples: `development/bench/{document_analysis,risk_analysis,contract_comparison,contract_comparison_validated,legal_issue_detection}.clj`

5 task types tested with goal-only instructions (no hardcoded trees) on real documents. The model designed 4 distinct tree patterns + 1 "no tree" decision, with zero hallucinations across spot-checks. See the headline report for the story.

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..."
# Run a single task
clj -M:dev -e '(require (quote [risk-analysis :as t])) (require (quote [runner])) (runner/start!) (runner/run! t/task) (runner/stop!)'
# Or run the full 5-task suite
clj -M:dev -e '(require (quote [all :as bench])) (bench/start!) (bench/run-all!) (bench/summary!) (bench/stop!)'
```

## RLM Mode (repl-researcher node)

The `:repl-researcher` node type provides a two-phase execution pattern. See [`docs/RLM-GUIDE.md`](docs/RLM-GUIDE.md) for the comprehensive guide — including the recursive-mode opt-in, sandbox primitives, drill-down primitives (`tree-detail`, `tree-trajectory`, `tree-failures`, `node-output`, `node-input-profile`), the Phase 2 tree DSL (including `:code` for model-authored transforms), observability events, partial-result handling, budget controls, and how to compose `:repl-researcher` as a node inside a larger behavior tree.

**Two modes**, controlled by the `:rlm` config on the node:

```clojure
;; Terminal mode (default) — model designs ONE tree, Phase 2 runs, result returns
{:rlm true}                          ; or {:rlm {:debug? true}}

;; Recursive mode (opt-in) — emit-tree! returns to Phase 1; model can inspect and continue
{:rlm {:recursive? true}}            ; or {:rlm {:recursive? true :debug? true}}
```
