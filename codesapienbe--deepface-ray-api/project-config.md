# Enterprise DeepFace Ray API - Cursor IDE Rules

## CORE PRINCIPLES
- Implement TODOs in priority batches (P0 → P1 → P2)
- Log ALL changes in CHANGELOG.md with detailed descriptions
- Update TODO.md status after each implementation
- Maintain enterprise-grade code quality standards
- Focus on security, performance, and scalability

## BATCH IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### P0 (Critical) - Security & Core Infrastructure
1. Authentication & Authorization (JWT, RBAC)
2. Image Encryption & Security Middleware  
3. Performance Optimization & Caching
4. Error Handling & Circuit Breakers

### P1 (Important) - Enterprise Features
1. Monitoring & Observability Stack
2. Database Integration & Data Management
3. Kubernetes & Container Orchestration
4. CI/CD Pipeline & Testing

### P2 (Enhancement) - Advanced Features
1. MLOps & Model Management
2. Advanced APIs & Streaming
3. Admin Dashboards & Analytics
4. Documentation & SDKs

## CODE QUALITY STANDARDS
- Follow Python PEP 8 with Black formatting
- Type hints for all functions and classes
- Comprehensive docstrings (Google style)
- Unit tests with >90% coverage
- Security-first mindset (validate all inputs)
- Performance considerations (async/await, caching)

## LOGGING REQUIREMENTS

## IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW
1. **Select Batch**: Choose 3-5 related TODOs from same priority
2. **Plan Implementation**: Design approach, identify dependencies
3. **Code Development**: Implement with tests and documentation  
4. **Update Documentation**: Log changes, update TODO status
5. **Validate**: Run tests, security checks, performance tests
6. **Commit**: Use conventional commits with clear messages

## FOCUS GUIDELINES
- Work on ONE priority level at a time (complete P0 before P1)
- Implement related TODOs together for better context
- Always consider security implications first
- Write production-ready code (not prototypes)
- Test thoroughly before moving to next batch

# Cursor AI Assistant Instructions for DeepFace Ray API

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
You are implementing an enterprise-ready facial recognition API. Your focus is on:
- **Security First**: Every feature must be secure by design
- **Production Ready**: Code must meet enterprise standards
- **Systematic Progress**: Implement TODOs in organized batches
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Log everything in CHANGELOG.md

## CURRENT PROJECT CONTEXT
- **Base**: FastAPI + Ray + DeepFace facial recognition API
- **Target**: Enterprise-grade application with JWT auth, encryption, monitoring
- **Architecture**: Microservices with Kubernetes deployment
- **Security**: Zero-trust, end-to-end encryption, RBAC

## BATCH IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### 1. PREPARATION PHASE (Before Each Batch)
Always start by reviewing current state
Check TODO.md for next priority batch

Review existing codebase for dependencies

Plan implementation order within batch

Identify potential breaking changes

text

### 2. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE (During Development)
For each TODO item:
Create feature branch: feature/P{priority}-{description}

Implement with comprehensive error handling

Add unit tests (minimum 90% coverage)

Add integration tests for API endpoints

Update documentation and type hints

Perform security review

text

### 3. DOCUMENTATION PHASE (After Implementation)
Update documentation systematically:
Add detailed entry to CHANGELOG.md

Mark TODO as completed in TODO.md

Update README.md if needed

Add API documentation updates

Create/update deployment guides

text

## CODE IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS

### Security Requirements
Always implement these security measures:
Input validation with Pydantic models

SQL injection prevention

XSS protection

CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

Rate limiting on all endpoints

Audit logging for sensitive operations

Encryption for data at rest and in transit

text

### Performance Requirements  
Optimize for enterprise performance:
Async/await for I/O operations

Connection pooling for databases

Redis caching for frequent queries

Ray distributed computing for ML tasks

Response compression (gzip)

Database query optimization

Memory usage monitoring

text

### Error Handling Standards
Implement comprehensive error handling:
try:
# Business logic here
result = await process_face_verification(img1, img2)

except ValidationError as e:
logger.error(f"Validation failed: {e}")
raise HTTPException(status_code=422, detail=str(e))

except AuthenticationError as e:
logger.warning(f"Auth failed for user {user_id}: {e}")
raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Authentication required")

except RateLimitExceeded as e:
logger.warning(f"Rate limit exceeded: {e}")
raise HTTPException(status_code=429, detail="Too many requests")

except Exception as e:
logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}", exc_info=True)
raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Internal server error")
