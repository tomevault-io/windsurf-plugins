description: Use sequential thinking for non-trivial tasks (plan, then execute with verification gates).

# Sequential thinking workflow (soft guidance)

When a task has 3+ steps or touches multiple modules:

- Start with a **short plan**:
  - goal, constraints, key files, verification steps.
- State any assumptions explicitly and validate them quickly.
- Execute in **small diffs**; avoid “mega changes”.
- Add **verification gates**:
  - run `pytest` (or targeted tests) after code changes,
  - validate key user flows when changes affect UX.
