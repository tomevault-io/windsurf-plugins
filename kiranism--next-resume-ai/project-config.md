## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. Request Analysis

   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)
   - Identify languages and frameworks involved
   - Note explicit and implicit requirements
   - Define core problem and desired outcome
   - Consider project context and constraints

2. Solution Planning

   - Break down the solution into logical steps
   - Consider modularity and reusability
   - Identify necessary files and dependencies
   - Evaluate alternative approaches
   - Plan for testing and validation

3. Implementation Strategy
   - Choose appropriate design patterns
   - Consider performance implications
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Verify best practices alignment

## Code Style and Structure

### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleSubmit)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference
- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation

## React 19 and Next.js 15 Best Practices

### Component Architecture

- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Minimize 'use client' directives
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Suspense for async operations
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals

### Async Request APIs

```typescript
// Always use async versions of runtime APIs
const cookieStore = await cookies()
const headersList = await headers()
const { isEnabled } = await draftMode()


### App Structure and About the App

Project Summary for Cursor AI
App: Open-source resume builder using Next.js.
Goal: Generate tailored resumes using AI based on job descriptions (JD) and user profiles.

Key Components:
Authentication:

Clerk for user sign-up/login.

Users create and manage profiles (basic info, skills, work experience, education).

Resume Creation Flow:

Stepper UI:

Step 1: Select a profile.

Step 2: Input job metadata (title, JD, other details from job portals).

AI Processing:

Backend sends profile + JD to AI (e.g., OpenAI GPT).

AI returns a tailored resume (JSON) with optimized keywords, reordered sections, and JD-aligned summaries.

Prefill & Preview:

JSON populates the resume form.

React PDF Renderer shows a live preview.

Export: Download as PDF or save JSON.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js, React, react-pdf, Zustand (state).

Backend: Next.js API routes for AI processing.

Database: Profiles stored via Clerk or external DB (e.g., PostgreSQL).

User Flow:

Copy
Auth → Create Profile → Resume Creation (Stepper) → AI Processing → Edit/Export

- src/server/db/schema/index.ts: This file contains the schema for the database.
- src/server/db/index.ts: This file contains the database connection and queries.
- src/server/jstack.ts: This file contains the authentication middleware.
- src/server/router.ts: This file contains the router for the API.
```
