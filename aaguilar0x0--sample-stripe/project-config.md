description: Project database context and data type and data flow
---

This project is using supabase and there is a file [database.types.ts](mdc:src/lib/extern/db/supabase/database.types.ts) that describes the database schema.

It is then decoupled and abstracted as Data Transfer Object (DTO) for the architecture, and is using zod for schema validation

each entity has a DTO file in `src/lib/core/dtos` directory.
