# Solar Control Add-on - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is a Home Assistant add-on for solar power management and device control. The project consists of:
- A Flask web application for configuration and monitoring
- A solar controller that manages device states based on available power
- Integration with Home Assistant API for device control and sensor data
- Support for both production (`solar-control`) and development (`solar-control-dev`) versions

## CRITICAL: Development Workflow
- **ONLY work in the `solar-control-dev/` folder**
- **NEVER edit files in the `solar-control/` (production) folder**
- Production deployments are handled by automated scripts
- All development, testing, and changes must be made in the development version
- The production version is for deployment only, not for direct editing

## Code Structure (Development Version)
- **Main Application**: `solar-control-dev/rootfs/usr/bin/my_program.py` - Flask web server
- **Core Logic**: `solar-control-dev/rootfs/usr/bin/solar_controller.py` - Solar power management
- **Device Management**: `solar-control-dev/rootfs/usr/bin/device.py` - Device abstraction
- **Battery Management**: `solar-control-dev/rootfs/usr/bin/battery.py` - Battery configuration
- **Utilities**: `solar-control-dev/rootfs/usr/bin/utils.py` - Helper functions
- **Web Interface**: `solar-control-dev/rootfs/usr/bin/templates/` - HTML templates
- **Static Assets**: `solar-control-dev/rootfs/usr/bin/static/` - CSS, JS, images

**Note**: All file paths shown are for the development version. Never edit files in the production `solar-control/` folder.

## Key Technologies
- **Python 3** with Flask web framework
- **Home Assistant API** integration via supervisor token
- **Docker** containerization for add-on deployment
- **Nginx** as reverse proxy
- **MQTT** for communication (configurable)
- **JSON** for configuration and data storage

## API Call Patterns

### Flask API Endpoints (Internal)
- **Purpose**: Internal communication within the add-on
- **Usage**: Use `apiCall()` function for calling Flask routes
- **Examples**: 
  - `/api/devices` - Device management
  - `/api/status` - System status
  - `/api/control/run` - Manual control execution
- **Context**: These are the add-on's own REST API endpoints

### Supervisor API Calls (External)
- **Purpose**: Communication with Home Assistant core
- **Usage**: Direct HTTP requests to supervisor API
- **Authentication**: Use supervisor token from environment
- **Base URL**: `http://supervisor/core`
- **Examples**:
  - `/api/states/{entity_id}` - Get entity state
  - `/api/services/switch/turn_on` - Control switches
  - `/api/services/switch/turn_off` - Control switches
- **Context**: These are Home Assistant's native API endpoints

### Key Distinction
- **Flask API**: Internal add-on functionality, use `apiCall()` function
- **Supervisor API**: External Home Assistant integration, use direct HTTP requests with supervisor token
- **Never confuse**: Flask routes with supervisor API endpoints - they serve different purposes

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include comprehensive docstrings for classes and methods
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add logging statements for debugging and monitoring

### Architecture Patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep web interface, business logic, and device management separate
- **Configuration Management**: Use JSON files for persistent configuration
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper exception handling with logging
- **State Management**: Track device states and controller decisions
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for device and configuration management

### Home Assistant Integration
- Use supervisor token for API authentication
- Follow Home Assistant entity naming conventions
- Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
- Support both sensor and switch entities
- Implement proper state synchronization

### Data Persistence
- Store configuration in `/data/` directory (persistent across restarts)
- Use JSON format for configuration files
- Implement file validation and fallback defaults
- Handle file corruption gracefully

### Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before storing or displaying
- Use proper authentication for API endpoints
- Follow Home Assistant add-on security best practices

### Testing and Debugging
- Include debug endpoints for troubleshooting
- Log important state changes and decisions
- Provide configuration validation
- Support manual override modes for testing

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Features
1. Update the main Flask application (`solar-control-dev/rootfs/usr/bin/my_program.py`)
2. Add corresponding template files if UI changes needed
3. Update configuration schema in `solar-control-dev/config.yaml`
4. Add any new dependencies to `solar-control-dev/requirements.txt`
5. Test in development environment first
6. **Remember**: Only work in `solar-control-dev/` folder

### Device Management
- Devices are defined in JSON format with properties like name, switch_entity, power_entity, etc.
- Support both mandatory and optional device types
