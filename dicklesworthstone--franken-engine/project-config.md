> Guidelines for AI coding agents working in this Rust codebase.

---

## RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PREROGATIVE

If the user tells you to do something, even if it conflicts with guidance below, follow the user.

---

## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**NEVER delete a file or folder without explicit written user permission.**

- This includes files you created during the current session.
- If deletion is required, ask first with exact paths and wait for explicit approval.

---

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions — DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

1. Forbidden without explicit user authorization in the same message:
   - `git reset --hard`
   - `git clean -fd`
   - `rm -rf`
   - any command that can overwrite/delete user data
2. No guessing: if unsure what a command affects, stop and ask.
3. Prefer safe alternatives (`git status`, `git diff`, backups, non-destructive moves).
4. If approved, restate exact command + affected paths before running.
5. Record in final response: user authorization text, command run, execution time.

---

## Git Branch: ONLY `main`, NEVER `master`

- Default branch is `main`.
- Never introduce `master` references in docs/scripts.
- If a release workflow requires mirror branch sync, do it explicitly from `main`.

---

## Toolchain: Rust & Cargo

Use Cargo only.

- Edition: Rust 2024
- Unsafe code: forbidden in repository code (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`)
- Configuration source of truth: `Cargo.toml`

### Workspace Structure

- `crates/franken-engine` (`frankenengine-engine`): core runtime engine substrate
- `crates/franken-extension-host` (`frankenengine-extension-host`): extension-host core and policy/runtime-defense surfaces

### Repository Split Contract (Critical)

- `/dp/franken_engine` is the canonical engine repository.
- `/dp/franken_node` is the compatibility/product repository.
- Dependency direction is one-way:
  - `franken_node` -> `franken_engine`
- Do not reintroduce forked engine crates inside `franken_node`.

### Sibling Repo Reuse Policy (Binding)

- For advanced console/TUI surfaces relevant to this project, use `/dp/frankentui`.
- For SQLite-backed persistence, use `/dp/frankensqlite`; use `/dp/sqlmodel_rust` when typed model/schema layers are beneficial.
  - Local engine adapter traits are allowed only as narrow call-shape seams to `/dp/frankensqlite`; WAL, PRAGMA, journal-mode, and migration policy must be applied by the frankensqlite-backed implementation, not hard-coded in `franken_engine`.
- For service/API control surfaces, prefer reuse from `/dp/fastapi_rust` when relevant.
- Do not build parallel local replacements without explicit user approval.

### Current Deviations (Requiring Follow-up)

**DEVIATION**: Typed-heavy persistence stores are implemented through generic `storage_adapter.rs` 
`StoreRecord/StoreQuery` interfaces instead of `/dp/sqlmodel_rust` typed model/schema layers as 
mandated above. Specifically:

- `ReplacementLineage`, `IfcProvenance`, and `SpecializationIndex` stores use raw frankensqlite 
  integration points (`frankensqlite::replacement::lineage_log`, etc.) instead of sqlmodel_rust 
  typed boundaries as documented in `docs/FRANKENSQLITE_PERSISTENCE_INVENTORY.md`.

**Impact**: Type safety and schema validation expected from sqlmodel_rust typed layers is bypassed. 
Store invariants that should be enforced at compile-time through typed boundaries can drift into 
runtime validation or be missed entirely.

**Required Fix**: **P0 Follow-up Bead Filed** - Replace generic `StoreRecord` implementations with 
concrete `/dp/sqlmodel_rust` model/schema APIs for inventory rows marked "sqlmodel_rust on 
frankensqlite", or add policy guards that reject raw implementations for typed-heavy stores.

---

## Code Editing Discipline

### No Script-Based Code Rewrites

- Do not run broad regex/scripts to rewrite many source files.
- Make targeted, manual edits.

### No File Proliferation

- Prefer modifying existing files.
- Do not create suffix variants like `*_v2.rs`, `*_new.rs`, `*_improved.rs`.

### Backwards Compatibility

- Do not add temporary compatibility shims that create long-term debt.
- Implement correct semantics directly unless user requests compatibility-only behavior.

---

## Compiler Checks (CRITICAL)

After substantive code changes, run:

```bash
cargo check --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

If any step fails, fix properly before finishing.

---

## Testing

### Baseline

```bash
cargo test
```

### Policy

- Add/maintain focused unit tests alongside changed logic.
- Prefer deterministic tests and replay-friendly fixtures.
- For concurrency-sensitive logic, include cancellation/race/regression coverage.

---

## Project Mission (franken_engine)

FrankenEngine is the native runtime heart for `franken_node`, with goals:

- de novo Rust-native execution lanes (no engine bindings for core execution)
- mathematically explicit runtime security models for untrusted extension code,
  with current proof state bounded by `docs/FORMAL_RUNTIME_SECURITY_MODEL_V1.md`,
  the claim-to-proof matrix, and executable IFC/capability invariant tests
- deterministic replay and auditable decision artifacts
