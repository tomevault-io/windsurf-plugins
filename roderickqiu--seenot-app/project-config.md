# Project Instructions

## Intent And Parser Rules

1. Do not use regexes, string matching hard-code, or other local heuristic patches to fix semantic interpretation bugs.
2. For parser semantic errors, prefer fixing the parser prompt, output schema, or upstream representation. Do not add local fallback normalization logic in app code or debugger code as a semantic band-aid.
3. Always design parser and screen analyzer behavior with future multilingual support in mind. Even if the current UI is Chinese-first, implementation must not assume users only speak or input Chinese, and must remain extensible to 20+ languages.
4. Always preserve generalizability across apps and domains. A fix must target the semantic class of behavior rather than a single named app, vendor, or screen. Do not ship a fix that only works for one app-specific phrasing if the same intent should work for other apps and platforms.

## Engineering Expectations

1. When fixing intent parsing bugs, validate the result through the parser path itself instead of masking the symptom in downstream rendering or post-processing.
2. Prefer solutions that improve cross-language and cross-app behavior together. If a change only helps one Chinese phrasing or one app family, treat it as incomplete.
3. Never commit changes without actual testing. If the relevant verification has not been run successfully, do not create a commit.
4. If Android verification or build tooling updates `app/version.properties` as part of the checked workflow, treat that version bump as part of the change and include it in the commit unless the user explicitly says otherwise.
5. Unless the user explicitly asks for a feature branch or says not to, commit directly to `main` in this repo.

## Design Expectations

1. For user-facing home or settings surfaces, avoid implementation-centric technical wording unless the screen is explicitly an advanced configuration surface. Prefer ordinary product language over terms like model maintenance, API keys, or provider internals.
2. Style lower-priority maintenance or configuration actions with weaker visual emphasis so they do not compete with primary actions or current-state information.
3. Design UI and write copy with the judgment of someone with strong product design and UX ability. Favor clear hierarchy, accurate semantics, realistic product behavior, and user-facing language that feels intentional rather than merely functional.
4. When producing plans, analysis reports, or other durable planning artifacts, create a standalone HTML file rather than a Markdown-only artifact unless the user explicitly asks otherwise. Use the dark-mode report style: dark page background, raised dark surfaces, clear table/card hierarchy, high-contrast code blocks, restrained blue accent for primary emphasis, warm warning accent for risks, and dense but readable product-planning layout.
