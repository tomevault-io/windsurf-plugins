# Godot Runtime Regression Loop

After any substantive code/content change, run a real runtime smoke test before declaring the task done.

- Use Godot run equivalents:
  - **F6 scene run** for scene-local changes.
  - **F5 project run** for gameplay/system changes or cross-scene edits.
- Collect and review runtime evidence from Output/debug logs (errors, warnings, stack traces).
- If any regression appears, immediately fix it and re-run until green.
- Repeat the cycle: **change -> run -> inspect logs -> fix -> re-run**.
- Do not finalize with known runtime errors.

## Minimum verification checklist

- No parse/compile errors in modified scripts.
- No new runtime errors in Output after the change.
- Changed feature behavior is exercised at least once in a real run.

## If execution is blocked

When F5/F6-style execution cannot be run (environment/tooling limitation), explicitly report:

1. what could not be run,
2. why it was blocked,
3. exact manual run steps for the user,
4. which logs/checks are still required after running.
