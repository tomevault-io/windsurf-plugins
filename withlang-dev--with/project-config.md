# AGENTS.md — With Compiler

Rules for AI agents working in this repository.

The With compiler is **self-hosting**. Small mistakes corrupt the
stage chain. Strict discipline is required.

---

## Mission

(Canonical copy: `docs/mission.md`.)

With is an ergonomics-first systems language: close to the
machine, native by default, exactly as safe as Rust, and built
to remove the suffering.

Every unnecessary character is a compiler failure. If With can
infer it, import it, fetch it, bind it, prove it, generate it,
link it, migrate it, wrap it, or make it safe, the programmer
should not have to spell it out.

C interop is first-class, not an escape hatch. With should
understand C headers, ABIs, native libraries, linkers, package
managers, and existing C code well enough to import, integrate,
and migrate them without making the programmer become the build
system.

With pays compiler complexity to remove ceremony without
removing guardrails. Raw C stays explicit; modeled C becomes
humane. The goal is native control, Rust-level safety, and
C-level reach — with the suffering automated away.

## Core Principles

**We own every bug.** There is no such thing as "pre-existing."
If a bug exists, we fix it. Never defer. Never work around.

**Root cause, always.** Perform a 5 Whys analysis. Trace the
failure chain to the deepest credible cause. Fix that. Never
fix symptoms.

**Build is verification, not experimentation.** A build takes
5 minutes. Before running `with build`, state what specific
question you're answering and what each possible outcome tells
you. If you can answer the question with `grep`, `nm`, `otool`,
`lldb`, or reading code — do that instead.

**Use the debugger.** The project has debug symbols. `lldb` with
a single breakpoint answers in seconds what print-and-rebuild
answers in minutes. Stop adding debug prints and rebuilding.

## Language Design Philosophy

**Don't make the user write anything the compiler already knows,
could figure out, or that doesn't matter.** This is the single
principle behind With's surface syntax, and it must be applied
*pervasively and consistently*. It is why:

- a function returning `i32` doesn't need a trailing `0`
- you don't write `Ok(())` or `Ok(value)` — `?` handles the sad
  path, the happy path just returns the value
- return types are inferred when the body makes them obvious
- `fn main:` not `fn main -> i32:`
- enum variants use `.Variant` when the type is known

**Never force the user to write ceremony for something that does
not matter.** The clearest violation is requiring `let _ = expr`
to discard a value whose discard has no effect. A dropped `Result`
does nothing, so a "must-use Result" diagnostic that forces
`let _ =` is **forbidden** — it makes the user annotate a fact the
compiler already knows and that changes nothing. (Contrast: a
dropped `Task` *cancels* it, so requiring an explicit choice there
is acceptable — the discard actually matters.)

Before adding any rule, error, or required annotation, ask: *does
this make the user state something the compiler already knows, can
infer, or that has no consequence?* If yes, don't add it. A
diagnostic earns its place only by catching a real mistake the
compiler cannot otherwise resolve — not by enforcing ritual.

## No Silent Fallbacks

When code cannot be correctly generated, the only acceptable
behavior is to fail loudly with a diagnostic and exit non-zero.
The following are **forbidden** regardless of what tests or
downstream compilation say:

- Emitting a placeholder function body (`-> Never`,
  `comptime_error(...)`, `panic("TODO")`, `return 0`, etc.)
  when translation fails
- Emitting an `extern fn` declaration to paper over a
  function the translator couldn't handle
- Silently dropping a clause, arm, or statement that the
  translator can't lower
- "Simplifying" a construct into something that compiles but
  behaves differently from the source
- Adding a `TODO` comment to emitted output and continuing

**A migrator that produces 30/30 files with silent stubs is
worse than one that produces 0/30 with a loud error.** The
first lies about completeness. The second tells the truth.

If you find yourself reaching for any of these patterns, stop.
The correct action is: emit a diagnostic naming the function
and source location, return non-zero from the tool, and leave
the work visible for a human to prioritize.

If you cannot produce correct output and you cannot fail
loudly (e.g., you're deep in a helper without error-return
plumbing), wire the plumbing. Do not invent a placeholder.

## "Done" Is a Claim That Requires Evidence

A task is not done because:

- Tests pass
- The build succeeds
- No compiler errors remain
- The commit was accepted
- Output files exist in the expected directory

A task is done when:

- The output is correct — meaning it does what a human
  familiar with the source would expect, not just what
  happens to compile
- The edge cases you noticed have tests or comments
  explaining why they're not covered
- Anything you couldn't solve is filed as an issue or
  surfaced as a loud failure, not hidden as a passing stub

Before claiming done, do the gut check: *did I make the
success condition true by doing the work, or by redefining
