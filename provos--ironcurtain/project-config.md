# IronCurtain Copilot Review Instructions

IronCurtain is a secure agent runtime that mediates between an AI agent and MCP servers. Every tool call passes through a trusted process that evaluates it against policy rules before forwarding. The policy engine and MCP proxy are the security boundary.

## Platform Support

IronCurtain runs on macOS and Linux. Windows is only supported under WSL2 — native Windows is not a target platform.

## Security Invariants

- Every tool call MUST pass through `policyEngine.evaluate()` before forwarding to a real MCP server. Any code path that skips evaluation is a security bypass.
- **Trusted servers** are an intentional exception to annotation requirements. Servers in the `trustedServers` set (currently only the memory MCP server) bypass structural invariants and compiled rules via an early return in `evaluate()`. This is by design: trusted server tools have no filesystem paths or URLs, so structural invariants (protected paths, sandbox containment, domain gate) are not applicable and would require fake annotations. Trust is verified by matching both the server name AND the expected entrypoint path (`MEMORY_SERVER_ENTRY`), not name alone. The normal flow (annotation lookup → evaluate → forward → audit) still runs; only `prepareToolArgs` is skipped when no annotation exists.
- Path containment checks MUST use `resolveRealPath()` (symlink resolution) before comparison. Raw `path.resolve()` is a symlink-escape vulnerability.
- `isWithinDirectory()` appends a trailing `/` before `startsWith()`. Without it, `/tmp/sandbox-evil` matches `/tmp/sandbox`.
- Multi-role evaluation uses most-restrictive-wins (deny > escalate > allow). Least-restrictive is a privilege escalation.
- Unknown tools (without annotations) MUST be denied, unless the server is in the `trustedServers` set.
- The auto-approver can only return `approve` or `escalate`, never `deny`. Error paths must return `escalate` (fail-open to human).
- `SERVER_CREDENTIALS` must be deleted from `process.env` immediately after parsing to prevent child process leakage.
- Audit logging must occur for every tool call outcome. No code path should skip it.

## AI SDK v6 API (Breaking Changes)

This project uses AI SDK v6. Any use of the old API will fail at runtime:

- `tool()` uses `inputSchema` (NOT `parameters`)
- `generateText()` uses `stopWhen: [stepCountIs(n)]` (NOT `maxSteps`)
- Tool call results use `toolCalls[].input` (NOT `.args`)
- `CoreTool` is now `ToolSet`

## Code Conventions

- All imports MUST use `.js` extensions (Node16 module resolution). Missing extensions cause runtime failures.
- `PolicyDecisionStatus` is a three-state union: `allow | deny | escalate`. Code handling only `allow`/`deny` without `escalate` has a missing case.
- User-facing output uses `process.stdout.write()` / `process.stderr.write()`, NOT `console.log()` (intercepted by logger module).
- Shell commands must use `shell-quote` for construction, not string concatenation or template literals.
- Avoid hand-crafted code for problems where well-established Node.js modules or built-ins exist (e.g., use `node:util` `parseArgs` for CLI argument parsing, not manual `argv` loops).

## Common Mistakes

1. Missing `.js` extension in imports
2. Using old AI SDK v4/v5 API (`parameters`, `maxSteps`, `.args`, `CoreTool`)
3. Path comparison without symlink resolution (`path.resolve()` instead of `resolveRealPath()`)
4. Handling only `allow`/`deny` without `escalate`
5. Skipping audit logging in proxy or trusted process code paths
6. Passing raw arguments to policy engine instead of `argsForPolicy` from `prepareToolArgs()`
7. String concatenation for shell commands instead of `shell-quote`
8. Using `console.log` in session/transport code
