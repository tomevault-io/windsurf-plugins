description: * fix errors without prompting
---

This is a monorepo.

* fix errors without prompting
* don't ask to proceed, just go
* fix all warnings along the way without prompting
* ONLY when making changes to /packages/dofs-rust-client:
    * run `cargo build` after each change to be sure it compiles
    * run `cargo test` after each change to be sure it passes tests
* when making changes to /packages/dofs:
    * do not automatically build
    * do not automatically install packages
