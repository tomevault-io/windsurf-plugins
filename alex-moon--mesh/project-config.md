# MESH Guidelines

## 1. Do not attempt to run any builds

* Please do not attempt to run npm, go, templ, docker or any other CLI tool that builds,
  generates or executes code. Leave this to the user.
* Assume that your code will work. The user will do any bugfixes.
* If at any point you are not sure and need feedback from a build process,
  prompt the user to run a command and provide feedback with context.
