# Agent Guidelines for gpt_3d_skill

## Project Role and Overview
`gpt_3d_skill` is an open, modular repository of agent-executable loose Markdown skills for procedural modeling, cinematic architectural animation, WebGL walkthroughs, and character rigging/local motion capture. The skill pack is vendor-agnostic and usable by humans and coding agents alike.

## Repository Structure
- `AGENTS.md`: Operational policies, workspace rules, and test contracts for coding agents.
- `README.md`: Public-facing project value, capabilities, and installation instructions.
- `docs/`: Design documents, specifications, and project history:
  - `docs/prd.md`: Product requirements, skill breakdown, and acceptance criteria.
  - `docs/rfc.md`: Architecture design, root router pattern, artifact boundaries, and baking decisions.
  - `docs/test.md`: Verification strategy distinguishing offline document integrity from external execution tests.
  - `docs/working.md`: Running changelog and observed lessons learned from actual pipeline runs.
- `skills/`: Loose Markdown skill definitions:
  - `skills/skill_gpt_3d.md`: Sole root router skill exposed to agents.
  - `skills/blender_modeling.md`: Focused procedural modeling capability.
  - `skills/blender_animation.md`: Focused architectural animation and video encoding capability.
  - `skills/hybrid_ai_video.md`: Focused hybrid 3D and AI video production capability.
  - `skills/web_walkthrough.md`: Focused WebGL/Three.js walkthrough capability with baked fidelity.
  - `skills/character_rigging_mocap.md`: Focused character motion-model, skinning, retargeting and local capture capability.
- `tests/`: Offline document integrity and repository hygiene checks.
- `templates/`: Reusable application source and synthetic test fixtures, without user models or deployment data.

## Operational Rules for Agents

### Working Log and Lessons
- Keep `docs/working.md` updated whenever new capabilities, conventions, or verified facts emerge.
- Never record hypothetical benchmarks or unverified test claims. Distinguish empirically verified facts from planned workflows.

### Git, Remote, and Deployment Restrictions
- Do not commit, push, alter remotes, or discard work without explicit user instruction. Read-only Git inspection is permitted.
- Do not publish, deploy, or upload repository contents or generated assets without explicit user request.
- Do not bind public network interfaces or share URLs without explicit authorization.

### Python Environment and uv Policy
- Check for a default `.venv` virtual environment in the repository root.
- If `.venv` does not exist, create it using `uv venv`.
- Whenever installing Python dependencies, always use `uv pip install` instead of standard `pip install`.
- Always activate the virtual environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`) before running Python commands or tools.

### Artifact Boundary Policy
- This repository contains skills, documentation, reusable templates and tests.
- Never store runtime user artifacts, temporary build output, `.blend` project files, rendered PNG sequences, MP4 video files, or exported GLB models inside this repository.
- All task-specific generation scripts, reference images, source 3D files, render outputs, and deployed web builds must be stored in dedicated task workspaces external to this repository. Templates may generate synthetic local test assets; those artifacts must remain ignored.

### Testing Contract
- Repository tests are executed with:
  ```bash
  python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
  ```
- These tests verify document integrity, relative reference links, and hygiene (e.g., absence of local paths, secrets, or broken relative links).
- Maintain the tests when changing the document contracts.
- Document integrity tests do not certify visual or rendering output. 3D visual certification occurs via opt-in checks in external task workspaces.

### Scope and Minimal Dependencies
- Keep a single Markdown root/router skill, with focused instructions and reusable templates linked locally.
- The mobile walkthrough template uses vanilla Three.js and Vite. Do not add React, native-app wrappers, trackers, private endpoints or heavyweight frameworks without a concrete requirement.
