# CLAUDE.md — Legal Document Intelligence System

> Project governance for every Claude Code session in this folder.
> Source of truth for scope: `CE_PLAN.md`. Current status: `RUN_STATE.md`.
> Read this file and `RUN_STATE.md` at the start of every session before doing anything.

> **This is a standalone, self-contained project**, living at `~/projects/legal-doc-intelligence/`.
> It is unrelated to any other project on this machine (in particular the "Proposal & SOW Generation
> Agent"). The only instructions that govern this project are this file, the other docs in this
> folder, and the user's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. No other project's `CLAUDE.md` applies here.

## What this project is

A **private, local-first document intelligence system** for a **solo attorney**. It lets the
attorney search, retrieve, summarize, and ask plain-English questions across **their own**
documents and get back answers that are **grounded in and cited to the source** (file + page +
section + chunk + verbatim span). The attorney verifies every answer against the cited source.

## What this project is NOT

- **It is NOT an AI lawyer.** No legal advice, no legal conclusions, no outcome predictions, no
  strategy recommendations. It locates and summarizes what the documents say. Nothing more.
- **It is NOT an autonomous agent.** It never acts, sends, files, or changes anything in the
  outside world. The answering component has no action tools and no network egress.

## Hard safety rules (non-negotiable)

These are boundaries, not backlog items. Do not violate them, and do not build features that would.

1. **Fake / public / sanitized documents ONLY in development.** Use synthetic contracts, sample
   pleadings, public-domain legal texts, and fabricated correspondence. Nothing real.
2. **Never process real attorney/client documents on this machine.** Real data is touched only at
   Milestone 6, onsite, on attorney-owned hardware, after **written** approval. Not here. Not now.
3. **No cloud dependencies unless explicitly approved in writing.** Local-only inference,
   embedding, OCR, and storage. No API keys are required for the local path. If a task seems to
   need a cloud service, stop and ask.
4. **Do not expose ports publicly.** Services bind to `127.0.0.1` (loopback) only, never `0.0.0.0`.
   No public DNS, no public IP, no tunnels, no port-forwards.
5. **No autonomous legal actions.** Specifically, the system must never:
   - send email (no SMTP, no mail API, no draft-and-send),
   - file court documents (no e-filing, no submission),
   - contact clients or third parties,
   - modify or delete legal documents (originals are read-only; only derived stores are written),
   - take any action on the attorney's behalf.
6. **No unsourced answers.** Every factual claim traces to a retrieved chunk. If the documents do
   not support an answer, the system says **"I could not find this in the documents."**
7. **Secrets are never committed.** `.env` is git-ignored; only `.env.example` with placeholders.

## Current milestone — Milestone 2-3 (custom citation-grade pipeline)

**Milestone 1 PASSED** (2026-06-20, go/no-go = PASS at filename level — see `DECISIONS.md` **D-33**).
The turnkey pilot proved grounded answering + filename grounding (100%) + not-found refusal (100%) +
DRM right-matter, and proved that **verifiable page+span citation is impossible on the turnkey stack**
— which authorizes the custom build. **We are now executing Milestone 2-3.** See `TASKS_M2.md` for the
M2 checklist and `BUILDER_STATE.md` for the M1 handoff/constraints.

**Milestone 2-3 goal:** build the custom citation-grade pipeline that delivers **verifiable
page+span citations** the turnkey stack could not — FastAPI + LlamaIndex + Docling/PyMuPDF ingestion
(real page metadata) + Qdrant/LanceDB + metadata-filter + reranker + **mechanical span-level citation
verification** (`DECISIONS.md` D-13..D-20). Re-measure against the existing `eval/` golden set at
page+span level.

**How we work in M2-3 (unchanged discipline):** each task is small, tested, and **owner-gated** —
new installs/deps/config are approved one step at a time via the relay prompt, exactly as in M1.

### Still blocked (do NOT do yet)

- **Do not buy or spec production hardware.** That is Milestones 4-5, after M2-3 validates on this
  machine. (CE_PLAN D-21/D-22; no purchase on spec.)
- **No real attorney/client documents.** Synthetic/public only until Milestone 6 (onsite, on
  attorney hardware, after written approval). The hard safety rules above still govern.

## How to work in this repo

- **Every task must be small, tested, and summarized.** Prefer the smallest change that proves
  the next thing. State assumptions before acting; if something is ambiguous, ask.
- **Surgical changes only.** Touch only what the task requires. Match existing style.
- **Do not install anything or run setup steps without confirming the task calls for it.** When a
  task does require installs, say exactly what will be installed and why first.

## Required report after every change

After making changes, always report:

1. **Files changed** — paths, with a one-line note on each.
2. **Commands run** — exact commands, and whether each succeeded.
