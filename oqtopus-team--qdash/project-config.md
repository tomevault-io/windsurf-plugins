# QDash Agent Guide

This file is the Codex-facing project guide. Keep it concise and update it when repository-wide conventions change. The older `CLAUDE.md` is retained as a Claude Code reference, but Codex should use this file first.

## Project Overview

QDash is a web platform for managing and monitoring qubit calibration workflows.

- Repository: `oqtopus-team/qdash`
- License: Apache 2.0
- Public docs: <https://oqtopus-team.github.io/qdash/>

## Architecture

- Frontend: `ui/` uses Next.js, React, TypeScript, DaisyUI, TanStack Query, and Bun.
- Backend API: `src/qdash/api/` uses FastAPI with MongoDB/PostgreSQL-related services.
- Workflow engine: `src/qdash/workflow/` uses Prefect 3 and qubex.
- Shared data/model code lives under `src/qdash/common`, `src/qdash/datamodel`, `src/qdash/dbmodel`, and repository/service modules.

Read `docs/getting-started/architecture.md` and the more specific docs under `docs/development/` before making broad changes.

- Database structure: `docs/reference/database-structure.md`
- Database indexes: `docs/reference/database-indexes.md`

## Generated Code

Do not manually edit generated files:

- `ui/src/client/`
- `ui/src/schemas/`
- `docs/oas/openapi.json`

When backend API schemas or routes change, run `task generate` from the repository root to regenerate the OpenAPI document and TypeScript client.

## Common Commands

Run commands from the repository root unless a directory is specified.

- Show available tasks: `task -l`
- Install host-side local dependencies: `task dev-local-setup`
- Start lightweight host-side stack: `task dev-local`
- Start full Docker Compose stack: `task deploy-local`
- Start API only: `uvicorn src.qdash.api.main:app --reload`
- Start UI dev server: `task dev-ui` or `bun run dev` in `ui/`
- Generate API client: `task generate`
- Python tests: `task test`
- Fast Python test loop: `task test-fast`
- API tests: `task test-api`
- Workflow tests: `task test-workflow`
- UI tests: `task test-ui`
- Python CI checks: `task ci`
- Full local checks including UI: `task check-all`
- Python lint/format with fixes: `task lint-python`
- UI lint/format with fixes: `task lint-ui`
- UI production build: `task build` or `task ci-ui-build`
- Docs dev server: `task docs`
- Docs build: `task build-docs`

Prefer focused tests for narrow changes, then broader checks when touching shared behavior, API contracts, generated clients, or UI routing.

## Python Conventions

- Python supports `>=3.10,<3.13`.
- Use `uv run ...` for Python tooling when invoking commands directly.
- Ruff line length is 100. The project uses Ruff for linting and formatting.
- Mypy is strict for application code. Keep types explicit when adding public helpers or cross-module interfaces.
- Tests use pytest. Many tests are designed to run in memory without MongoDB.
- Avoid changing `tools`, `scripts`, or generated requirement exports unless the task is specifically about those areas.

## UI Conventions

- Use Bun in `ui/`.
- `ui/src/app/` should contain routing-only App Router files. Keep `page.tsx` files thin and delegate substantial UI to `*PageContent` components.
- Use named exports for ordinary components, hooks, utilities, and contexts. `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` use default exports.
- Use imports from established aliases and locations, especially `@/contexts/*`, `@/hooks/useUrlState` or `@/hooks/url-state`, and `@/lib/utils/*`.
- Keep reusable primitives in `ui/src/components/ui/`, feature UI in `ui/src/components/features/`, charts in `ui/src/components/charts/`, and layout in `ui/src/components/layout/`.
- Use TanStack Query for server state and `nuqs` for URL query state when matching existing patterns.
- Use Lucide React icons where an icon is appropriate.
- Follow `docs/development/ui/guidelines.md` and `docs/development/ui/design-policy.md` for implementation and visual design details.

## Documentation Conventions

- Follow `docs/development/docs-guidelines.md`.
- Start docs with a direct context sentence.
- Do not add manual tables of contents, summary sections, empty checklists, future-enhancement sections, or emoji.
- Link relevant docs inline instead of adding broad related-document lists.
- Do not restructure `docs/task-knowledge/`; those files have a fixed template consumed by the copilot system.

## Git And PR Conventions

- Use Conventional Commits style: `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`.
