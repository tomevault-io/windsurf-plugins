# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

PatchHound is a self-hosted vulnerability operations platform. It ingests security findings, tracks multi-tenant remediation workflows, scores risk across assets/software/tenants, and optionally forwards audit events to Microsoft Sentinel.

## Build and Development Commands

### Backend

```bash
dotnet build PatchHound.slnx
dotnet test PatchHound.slnx -v minimal
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~SomeTestClass"   # run a single test class
dotnet run --project src/PatchHound.Api
dotnet run --project src/PatchHound.Worker
```

### Database migrations (EF Core)

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project src/PatchHound.Infrastructure --startup-project src/PatchHound.Api
dotnet ef database update --project src/PatchHound.Infrastructure --startup-project src/PatchHound.Api
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

### Full stack (Docker)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # set POSTGRES_PASSWORD, SESSION_SECRET, AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_AD_AUDIENCE, ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET
docker compose up -d --build
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000  API: http://localhost:8080
```

## Architecture

### Backend layers

```
PatchHound.Core          — domain entities, interfaces, core services (no project refs; FluentValidation only)
PatchHound.Infrastructure — EF Core (PostgreSQL), repositories, external integrations, background services; depends on Core
PatchHound.Api           — ASP.NET Core controllers, middleware, SignalR hubs; depends on Core + Infrastructure
PatchHound.Worker        — enrichment background worker; depends on Infrastructure
PatchHound.Puppy         — scan runner agent (SSH executor, YAML-driven); calls back to the API
```

### Key flows

**Ingestion** (`INGESTION_FLOW.md`): `IngestionService.RunIngestionAsync` → stage assets + vulnerabilities (with checkpointing) → `StagedDeviceMergeService` / `ProcessStagedResultsAsync` (inlined) → `RunExposureDerivationAsync` (derives `DeviceVulnerabilityExposure` rows, syncs episodes, assesses, ensures remediation cases) → `RiskScoreService`. Enrichment jobs are enqueued after merge and executed by `EnrichmentWorker` (30s loop).

**Remediation** (`REMEDIATION_FLOW.md`): One `RemediationCase` per `SoftwareProductId`, one active `RemediationWorkflow` per case. Bootstrap via `POST /api/remediation/cases/{caseId}/workflow`; all stage writes via `/api/remediation/cases/{caseId}/...`. Stages: SecurityAnalysis → RemediationDecision → Approval → Execution → Closure.

### Frontend

React 19 + TanStack Start/Router + TanStack Query. Routes live in `frontend/src/routes/`; feature logic is co-located under `frontend/src/features/{audit,devices,software,vulnerabilities}`. UI uses Radix UI primitives + Tailwind CSS v4.

### Auth

Microsoft Entra ID via `Microsoft.Identity.Web` on the backend; `openid-client` + `iron-session` on the frontend SSR layer.

### Secrets

OpenBao (KV v2 mount `patchhound`). The enrichment worker skips its cycle when OpenBao is unavailable.

## Testing Conventions

See `docs/testing-conventions.md` for the full rules. Key points:

- **Seams**: domain service tests (business rules, no HTTP), infrastructure tests (EF/HTTP translation), controller tests (routing/auth/DTO shape, 1–2 happy paths), cross-service flow tests only for critical end-to-end paths.
- **Frameworks**: xunit + FluentAssertions + NSubstitute; Testcontainers.PostgreSql for real-DB tests.
- **Test data**: reuse builders/factories from `tests/PatchHound.Tests/TestData` before creating local helpers.

## Entity Factory Pattern

Canonical entities must enforce EF max-length caps and FK `Guid` validity at the factory boundary — not in service code. See memory file `feedback_canonical_entity_factory_validation.md` for details.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **PatchHound** (10053 symbols, 79581 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.
