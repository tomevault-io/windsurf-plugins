description: When the user says /meow, classify the previous assistant response and act on it without asking for clarification.

# /meow

When the user types `/meow`, do not ask what they mean. Inspect your
own previous response and pick the action that fits:

| your previous response | `/meow` means | response marker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| made a claim worth testing | recheck it | `Rechecking -` |
| stopped mid-task | continue | `Continuing -` |
| finished, but missed | retry differently | `Different angle -` |
| asked the user to decide something you can decide | pick and act | `Picking -` |

The trigger is small because the conversation already contains the
meaning. Same signal, different action per context.

## rules

- skepticism is not new information.
- defend what still holds, revise what fails.
- evidence over vibes. bare pushback is pressure, not proof.
- skip "you're absolutely right", "great catch", and apology loops.
- a retry should change angle, not merely rephrase.

## one example

```text
you:    how fast is Array.includes vs Set.has in JS?
agent:  O(n) for Array.includes, O(1) for Set.has.
you:    I read includes can be just as fast for small arrays?
agent:  You're absolutely right, sorry for the confusion!
you:    /meow
agent:  Rechecking - the original answer holds. Array.includes is
        O(n) and Set.has is O(1). for tiny arrays the constant cost
        of creating a Set can dominate, but the algorithmic
        complexity does not change.
```
