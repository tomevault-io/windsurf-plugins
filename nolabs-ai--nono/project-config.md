# nono - Development Guide

## Project Overview

nono is a capability-based sandboxing system for running untrusted AI agents with OS-enforced isolation. It uses Landlock (Linux) and Seatbelt (macOS) to create sandboxes, and then layers on top a policy system, diagnostic tools, and a rollback mechanism for recovery. The library is designed to be a pure sandbox primitive with no built-in policy, while the CLI implements all security policy and UX.

The project is a Cargo workspace with three members:
- **nono** (`crates/nono/`) - Core library. Pure sandbox primitive with no built-in security policy.
- **nono-cli** (`crates/nono-cli/`) - CLI binary. Owns all security policy, profiles, hooks, and UX.
- **nono-ffi** (`bindings/c/`) - C FFI bindings. Exposes the library via `extern "C"` functions and auto-generated `nono.h` header.
- **nono-proxy** - Proxy that provides network filtering and credential injection

### Library vs CLI Boundary

The library is a **pure sandbox primitive**. It applies ONLY what clients explicitly add to `CapabilitySet`:

| In Library | In CLI |
|------------|--------|
| `CapabilitySet` builder | Policy groups (deny rules, dangerous commands, system paths) |
| `Sandbox::apply()` | Group resolver (`policy.rs`) and platform-aware deny handling |
| `SandboxState` | `ExecStrategy` (Direct/Monitor/Supervised) |
| `DiagnosticFormatter` | Profile loading and hooks |
| `QueryContext` | All output and UX |
| `keystore` | `learn` mode |
| `undo` module (ObjectStore, SnapshotManager, MerkleTree, ExclusionFilter) | Rollback lifecycle, exclusion policy, rollback UI |

## Build & Test

After every session, run these commands to verify correctness:

```bash
# Build everything
make build

# Run all tests
make test

# Full CI check (clippy + fmt + tests)
make ci
```

Individual targets:
```bash
make build-lib       # Library only
make build-cli       # CLI only
make test-lib        # Library tests only
make test-cli        # CLI tests only
make test-doc        # Doc tests only
make clippy          # Lint (strict: -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used)
make fmt-check       # Format check
make fmt             # Auto-format
```

## Coding Standards

- **Error Handling**: Use `NonoError` for all errors; propagation via `?` only.
- **Unwrap Policy**: Strictly forbid `.unwrap()` and `.expect()`; enforced by `clippy::unwrap_used`.
- **Libraries should almost never panic**: Panics are for unrecoverable bugs, not expected error conditions. Use `Result` instead.
- **Unsafe Code**: Restrict to FFI; must be wrapped in safe APIs with `// SAFETY:` docs.
- **Path Security**: Validate and canonicalize all paths before applying capabilities.
- **Arithmetic**: Use `checked_`, `saturating_`, or `overflowing_` methods for security-critical math.
- **Memory**: Use the `zeroize` crate for sensitive data (keys/passwords) in memory.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new capability types and sandbox logic.
- **Environment variables in tests**: Tests that modify `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, or other env vars must save and restore the original value. Rust runs unit tests in parallel within the same process, so an unrestored env var causes flaky failures in unrelated tests (e.g. `config::check_sensitive_path` fails when another test temporarily sets `HOME` to a fake path). Always use save/restore pattern and keep the modified window as short as possible.
- **Attributes**: Apply `#[must_use]` to functions returning critical Results.
- **Lazy use of dead code**: Avoid `#[allow(dead_code)]`. If code is unused, either remove it or write tests that use it.
- **Commits**: All commits must include a DCO sign-off line (`Signed-off-by: Name <email>`).

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No escape hatch**: Once sandbox is applied via `restrict_self()` (Landlock) or `sandbox_init()` (Seatbelt), there is no API to expand permissions.

2. **Fork+wait process model**: nono stays alive as a parent process. On child failure, prints a diagnostic footer to stderr. Three execution strategies: `Direct` (exec, backward compat), `Monitor` (sandbox-then-fork, default), `Supervised` (fork-then-sandbox, for rollbacks/expansion).

3. **Capability resolution**: All paths are canonicalized at grant time to prevent symlink escapes.

4. **Library is policy-free**: The library applies ONLY what's in `CapabilitySet`. No built-in sensitive paths, dangerous commands, or system paths. Clients define all policy.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS (Seatbelt)
- Uses `sandbox_init()` FFI with raw profile strings
- Profile is Scheme-like DSL: `(allow file-read* (subpath "/path"))`
- Network denied by default with `(deny network*)`

### Linux (Landlock)
- Uses landlock crate for safe Rust bindings
- Detects highest available ABI (v1-v5)
- ABI v4+ includes TCP network filtering
