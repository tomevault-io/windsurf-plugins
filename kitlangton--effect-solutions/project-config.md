# Effect Solutions

Effect best practices and patterns for humans and AI agents — https://www.effect.solutions

> **Living Document**: This is an opinionated collection exploiting Cunningham's Law ("the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer"). Disagree with a recommendation? Think we should cover something? [Open an issue](https://github.com/kitlangton/effect-solutions/issues/new)

## Project Structure

- `packages/website/` - Documentation site (Next.js)
- `packages/cli/` - CLI for local docs access
- `.github/workflows/` - Automated validation & bots

## Quick Links

- **Website**: https://www.effect.solutions
- **CLI**: `bunx effect-solutions@latest list`

## Local Reference Repos

- Effect core monorepo (source for `@effect/*`, including `@effect/vitest` / `it.layer`): `/Users/kit/code/effectful/repos/effect`

## Development

```bash
bun install          # Install dependencies
bun run dev          # Website dev server
bun run dev:cli      # CLI dev mode
bun run check        # Biome (writes), tsc --build, tests
bun --cwd packages/website run format  # Format website/docs
bun --cwd packages/website run generate:og  # Rebuild Open Graph images
```

### Open Graph Images

The Playwright generator lives at `packages/website/scripts/generate-og.ts` and renders the static template in `packages/website/src/app/og/template/page.tsx`. Run `bun --cwd packages/website run generate:og` to refresh every image (or `OG_ONLY=slug1,slug2 bun --cwd packages/website run generate:og` to target a subset). The resulting PNGs are written to `packages/website/public/og/` and referenced automatically in the Next.js metadata.

## Changesets & Publishing

```bash
bun scripts/changeset-named.ts "description"  # Create named changeset
bun release                                    # Version + tag packages, push tags for CI publish
```

**Creating changesets:**

- Use `bun scripts/changeset-named.ts "fix audio overlap"` to create descriptive changeset files
- Avoids random names like "purple-olives-look.md"
- Script prompts for package selection and change type interactively
- Resulting file: `.changeset/fix-audio-overlap.md`

**Change types:**

- `patch` - Bug fixes, docs updates, minor tweaks
- `minor` - New features, backwards-compatible changes
- `major` - Breaking changes

## Workspace

Bun workspace with `workspaces: ["packages/*"]`. Effect Language Service configured via `tsconfig.base.json`.

## Design Notes

UI components use hard edges; no border radius (use `rounded-none` or omit rounding).

## Writing Style

- Avoid em dashes (—). Use semicolons, commas, or separate sentences instead.

## Documentation Structure

Documentation lives in `packages/website/docs/`. Each file follows this pattern:

```
NN-slug.md          # NN = sort order (00-99)
```

Files are processed by Next.js and rendered with MDX support. The slug becomes the URL path.

### Adding New Docs

1. Create new file in `packages/website/docs/` with proper numbering
2. Add frontmatter with title, description, and optionally group
3. **Create corresponding test file in `tests/`** - All code examples must have tests to ensure they're correct
4. Run `bun --cwd packages/website run generate:og` to create social images
5. Test locally with `bun run dev`
6. Run `bun run test` to verify all examples work

### Frontmatter Groups

Docs are organized into groups on the homepage via the `group` frontmatter field:

- **Setup**: Getting started guides (`group: Setup`)
- **Core Patterns**: Default if unspecified (`group: Core Patterns`)
- **Ecosystem**: @effect packages like cli, platform, rpc (`group: Ecosystem`)
- **Drafts**: Shown in dev only when `draft: true` (overrides group)

Valid values: `Setup`, `Core Patterns`, `Ecosystem`

```yaml
---
title: Command-Line Interfaces
description: "Build CLIs with @effect/cli"
order: 13
group: Ecosystem
---
```

### Doc Typechecking Tips

- `bun run typecheck:docs` extracts every ```ts/```typescript code block and compiles it as an isolated module. Keep snippets self-contained.
- Use `// hide-start` / `// hide-end` inside code fences to include helper stubs (types, imports, small services) that are needed for typechecking but should not render in the docs. This keeps examples focused while staying type-safe.

### MDX Components

Custom components available in docs:

- Code blocks with syntax highlighting (via Shiki)
- Copy buttons on code blocks
- LLM instructions button for AI-friendly content
- Automatic table of contents generation

## CLI Package

The CLI (`packages/cli/`) provides offline access to documentation:

```bash
bunx effect-solutions list          # List all topics
bunx effect-solutions show <slug>   # Show specific topic (supports multiple)
bunx effect-solutions open-issue    # Leave feedback
```

Built with Effect CLI and Schema for validation (from `effect/Schema`). Tests in `packages/cli/src/cli.test.ts` validate all commands.

**Maintenance:** When adding/removing docs, update the topics list in:
- `<!-- effect-solutions:start -->` block at the bottom of this file
- `packages/website/src/lib/llm-instructions.ts` (the template for agent files)

Run `bun run dev:cli -- list` to see current non-draft topics.
