# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Godot 4.5 addon (`addons/dynamic_2d_grass/`) implementing a stylised 2D pixel-art grass system with wind animation, character-reactive displacement, grass destruction via effector decals, and world-space cloud shadows. Created by Jomoho Games, based on original work by Dylearn. Published on the Godot Asset Library.

## Running

Open in Godot 4.5+. Example scene: `example/scenes/Demo2D.tscn`. No build system — run directly from the Godot editor.

## Architecture

### Shader Pipeline

- **Grass2D.gdshader** — Core 2D grass shader. MultiMesh quads with:
  - Stepped framerate animation (per-instance phase offset to avoid synchronized updates)
  - World-space wind sway via dual scrolling noise textures diverged at an angle
  - Fake perspective UV squishing in fragment
  - Noise-based colour patches (albedo2/albedo3) and accent grass variants selected by instance ID
  - Displacement via terrain data texture (R channel = push, G channel = coverage)
- **cloud_overlay.gdshader** — Full-screen cloud shadow overlay (blend_mul). Renders in a CanvasLayer ColorRect, darkens entire scene (sprites, tiles, grass). Reads terrain data A channel for cloud immunity, B channel for pseudo-3D Y-offset. Cloud noise functions inlined
- **effector_channel.gdshader** — Channel-routing shader for effector mirrors in the terrain data SubViewport. Uses `blend_disabled` + `hint_screen_texture` to independently modify a single RGBA channel. A `BackBufferCopy` node precedes each effector for correct accumulation
- **mask_coverage.gdshader** — Coverage mask shader for MeshInstance2D nodes. Uses `blend_premul_alpha` with alpha=0 to write G=1 without touching the A channel (reserved for cloud immunity)

### Scripts (GDScript)

#### Addon scripts (`addons/dynamic_2d_grass/scripts/`)

- **GrassChunkManager2D.gd** — Camera-adaptive grass streaming. Pre-computes per-chunk MultiMesh buffers and nav-polygon coverage masks from the TileMapLayer, streams chunks in/out based on camera viewport
- **GrassEffectManager2D.gd** — Manages a SubViewport that renders effector sprites and coverage masks into a terrain data texture (RGBA). Creates mirror sprites with channel-routing shader for each GrassEffector2D, with BackBufferCopy nodes for accumulation. Coverage masks use blend_premul_alpha. Syncs transform/modulate each frame. Supports runtime effector registration via `node_added` signal
- **GrassEffector2D.gd** — Extends Sprite2D. Add as a child of any Node2D to affect grass. Set the sprite texture for effect shape, use node transform for placement/size. Exports: `target_channel` (R/G/B/A), `blend_operation` (ADD/SUB). Hidden at runtime; visible in editor
- **CloudOverlay2D.gd** — Creates a CanvasLayer with full-screen ColorRect for cloud shadows. Syncs camera position/zoom and terrain bounds to the cloud overlay shader each frame

#### Example scripts (`example/scripts/`)

- **ZeldaCamera2D.gd** — Zelda-style camera with grid-quantized scrolling and smooth mousewheel zoom
- **Bomb2D.gd** — Bomb with accelerating pulse animation, spawns crater + particles + camera shake after fuse
- **Crater2D.gd** — Crater decal with GrassEffector2D (SUB). Holds, then fades effector (grass regrows), then fades visual

### Key Conventions

- Grass effectors must be in the `"grass_effectors"` group and extend Sprite2D with `target_channel` (R=0, G=1, B=2, A=3) and `blend_operation` (ADD=0, SUB=1) exports
- Terrain data SubViewport channel map: R = displacement strength, G = grass coverage mask, B = cloud Y-offset (pseudo-3D), A = cloud immunity
- Grass uses MultiMeshInstance2D — individual blade transforms are set by Godot's MultiMesh, not by scripts
- Shaders use `group_uniforms` for organized inspector UI

### GDScript Typing Rules

This project treats the "inferred Variant type" warning as a **parse error**. Never use `:=` when the right-hand side returns `Variant`. Common pitfalls:

- `Array.pop_back()`, `Array.pop_front()`, `Array.back()`, `Array.front()` — always return `Variant` even on typed arrays. Use explicit type: `var x: int = arr.pop_back()`
- `Dictionary[key]` — returns `Variant`. Use explicit type: `var x: MyType = dict[key]`
- `for x in [1.0, 2.0]:` — untyped array literals make `x` Variant. Use a typed array: `var arr: Array[float] = [1.0, 2.0]` then `for x in arr:`
