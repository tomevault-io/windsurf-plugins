# Project Notes

## ⚠️ PYTHON 3.9 COMPATIBILITY — MANDATORY ⚠️

**KiCad bundles Python 3.9.** All code in `src/kicad_jlcimport/` MUST be compatible with Python 3.9. This is non-negotiable — violations silently break the plugin inside KiCad with no error shown to the user.

**DO NOT USE:**
- `str | None`, `int | str` (PEP 604 union syntax — requires 3.10) → use `Optional[str]`, `Union[int, str]`
- `match`/`case` (structural pattern matching — requires 3.10)
- `type X = ...` (type aliases — requires 3.12)
- `ExceptionGroup`, `except*` (requires 3.11)
- `tomllib` (requires 3.11) → use `tomli` backport
- `asyncio.TaskGroup` (requires 3.11)

**ALWAYS USE:** `from typing import Optional, Union, List, Dict` instead of built-in generics (`list[str]`, `dict[str, int]` — requires 3.9+ but `Optional`/`Union` require `typing`).

**CI enforces this.** The test matrix runs the full suite on Python 3.9. Any 3.10+ syntax in `src/` will fail the CI build. Do NOT try to work around this with local compatibility shims or skip markers — just write 3.9-compatible code.

Tests and tools (`tests/`, `tools/`) may use newer syntax since they run in the dev venv, not inside KiCad.

## DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

All work must be done inside the project's virtual environment. Activate it before running any commands:

```bash
source install.sh
```

This creates the venv and installs dependencies on first run, or just activates the existing venv.

## BEFORE COMMITTING - MANDATORY BUILD CHECKS

**NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT RUNNING ALL THREE CHECKS:**

```bash
# Run from project root directory (venv must be active)
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
pytest tests/ -q --cov=kicad_jlcimport --cov-fail-under=80
```

ALL THREE must pass with zero errors before any commit or push.

## GIT WORKFLOW

**NEVER push directly to main.** Always create a feature branch and open a PR. Do not push to or modify main without explicit user permission. Do not revert commits on main without explicit user permission.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

This project uses the standard **src layout**. The package source lives in `src/kicad_jlcimport/`.

```
src/kicad_jlcimport/         # main package
├── easyeda/                  # EasyEDA data fetching, types, and parsing
├── kicad/                    # KiCad file generation and library management
├── gui/                      # wxPython GUI
├── tui/                      # Textual TUI
├── importer.py               # import orchestration
└── ...
tests/                        # test suite
tools/                        # developer utilities (not part of the package)
```

## TWO UIs

This project has two separate UIs: a wxPython dialog (`src/kicad_jlcimport/dialog.py`) and a Textual TUI (`src/kicad_jlcimport/tui/app.py`). When the user shows a screenshot or describes a UI issue, verify which UI it applies to before implementing changes. Native-looking widgets = wxPython dialog; terminal-rendered widgets = TUI.

## GIT STASH

NEVER run `git stash` without asking the user first. Stashing someone's in-progress work without permission is not acceptable — ask how they want to handle uncommitted changes.

## FIXING TEST FAILURES

**Understand the root cause before changing anything.** Don't jump to the first edit that makes tests pass.

- **Never modify production code just to make a test pass.** If a test fails, first determine whether the test or the production code is wrong. Read the production code's docstrings, comments, and recent commit history before deciding.
- **Treat merged/reviewed production code as intentional.** If code is deliberately designed a certain way (especially error handling, security boundaries, or API contracts), fix the tests to match the design — not the other way around.
- **Mock external dependencies.** When tests fail because they make real network, filesystem, or OS calls, mock the external dependency. Don't weaken production error handling to tolerate environment differences.

## RELEASING — `/release`

When the user says `/release` or asks to cut a release, follow these steps exactly.

### 1. Determine the new version

Ask the user for the version bump type (patch, minor, or major) if not specified. Parse the current version from `pyproject.toml` and compute the new version.

### 2. Run all checks

```bash
source install.sh
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
pytest tests/ -q --cov=kicad_jlcimport --cov-fail-under=80
```

All three must pass. Do not proceed if any fail.

### 3. Merge to main if on a feature branch

If currently on a feature branch:
1. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed.
2. Check if an open PR exists for this branch (`gh pr list --head <branch>`). If not, create one.
3. Merge the PR: `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`
4. Switch to main and pull: `git checkout main && git pull`

If already on main, just ensure it's up to date: `git pull`

### 4. Update version in these files

| File | Field |
|---|---|
| `pyproject.toml` | `version = "X.Y.Z"` |
| `metadata.json` | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` in the `versions[0]` object |

### 5. Add a changelog entry to README.md

Add a line to the **Recent Updates** section at the top of the list:
