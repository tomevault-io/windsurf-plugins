# CopilotCustomizer

A VS Code GitHub Copilot customization framework for generating tech-stack-specific agents, instructions, prompts, and skills. Uses a **unified orchestrator architecture**: the **CopilotCustomizer** orchestrator routes all workflows — both external user repository operations and toolkit self-improvement — through specialized subagents via programmatic orchestration.

## Documentation

- [QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md) — Get started in 5 minutes
- [HOW-TO.md](docs/HOW-TO.md) — Complete commands reference
- [README.md](README.md) — Overview and key commands

## Unified Orchestrator Architecture

**CopilotCustomizer** (single entry point for all workflows):
- `CopilotCustomizer.agent.md` — Unified orchestrator for all workflows
  - `Bootstrap.agent.md` — Repository bootstrap workflow (subagent)
  - `Planner.agent.md` — Asset recommendation and specification (subagent)
  - `Generator.agent.md` — Multi-asset creation engine (subagent)
  - `Editor.agent.md` — Precise file operations (subagent)
  - `Verifier.agent.md` — Schema validation + harmonization (subagent)
  - `Evolve.agent.md` — Toolkit self-improvement specialist (subagent)

**Orchestration model**: All workflows are driven programmatically via the `agent` tool. No manual handoff buttons — the orchestrator manages the full subagent chain autonomously.

## Asset Types

- **Agents** (7): CopilotCustomizer (orchestrator), Bootstrap, Planner, Generator, Editor, Verifier, Evolve  
- **Instructions** (12): AgentAuthoring, AgentsFile, Framework, InstructionAuthoring, Maintenance, Orchestration, PromptAuthoring, RepoReview, Security, SkillAuthoring, Standards, ToolkitOps  
- **Prompts** (10): Bootstrap, Evolve, NewAgent, NewAgentsFile, NewInstructions, NewMultiAgent, NewPrompt, NewSkill, QuickFix, Review  
- **Skills** (6): asset-design, deployment-automation, documentation, orchestration, planning, repo-analysis  
- **Standards** (43 across 8 categories): architecture, databases, devops, frameworks, languages, practices, security, testing
- **Templates** (4): Analysis, ChangeLog, ImplementationPlan, OrchestrationPlan
