# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**⚠️ KNOWLEDGE-FIRST:** If `doc/loom/knowledge/` exists, read ALL files there BEFORE doing any work — they are your primary source of truth for understanding this codebase. Read `architecture.md` first, then `entry-points.md`, then the rest.

## Project Overview

Loom is a self-propelling agent orchestration CLI written in Rust. It coordinates Claude Code sessions across git worktrees, enabling parallel task execution with automatic crash recovery and context handoffs.

This is an unreleased project under active development NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILTY OR MIGRATION ROUTINES SHOULD BE ADDED AT THIS STAGE.

## Build Commands

```bash
cd loom
cargo build                    # Development build
cargo build --release          # Release build
cargo test                     # Run all tests
cargo test stage_transitions   # Run single test file
cargo test --test e2e          # Run end-to-end tests
cargo clippy -- -D warnings    # Lint with warnings as errors
cargo fmt --check              # Check formatting
```

Tests use `serial_test` for isolation - many tests cannot run in parallel.

## Architecture

### Source Layout (`loom/src/`)

```text
main.rs              CLI entry point (clap-based command definitions)
lib.rs               Module exports

commands/            Command implementations (init, run, status, stage, etc.)
daemon/              Unix socket server for IPC (protocol.rs, server.rs)
orchestrator/
  core/              Main orchestrator loop and state machine
  terminal/          Terminal window spawning abstraction
  monitor/           Session health monitoring and context tracking
  signals/           Signal generation for agent communication
  auto_merge.rs      Git merge automation
  retry.rs           Failure retry with backoff
models/
  stage/             Stage state machine (types.rs, transitions.rs)
  session/           Session lifecycle tracking

  parser.rs          Markdown plan document parser
  schema/            YAML metadata validation
  graph/             Execution DAG building
fs/                  File operations for .work/ directory
git/                 Git operations (worktrees, branches, merges)
verify/              Acceptance criteria execution
```

### Key Abstractions

**ExecutionGraph** (`plan/graph/`): DAG of stages with dependency tracking. Determines which stages are ready to execute.

**Stage** (`models/stage/types.rs`): Unit of work with lifecycle:
`WaitingForDeps → Queued → Executing → Completed/Blocked/NeedsHandoff`

**Session** (`models/session/`): Represents a Claude Code process executing a stage. Tracks PID, context usage, timestamps.

**Orchestrator** (`orchestrator/core/orchestrator.rs`): Main loop that polls stage/session state, spawns ready stages, handles crashes.

**TerminalBackend** (`orchestrator/terminal/`): Abstraction for spawning sessions in OS terminal windows.

### State Directory (`.work/`)

All state is file-based for git-friendliness:

- `config.toml` - Active plan reference and settings
- `stages/*.md` - Stage state files (markdown with YAML frontmatter)
- `sessions/*.md` - Session tracking files
- `signals/*.md` - Agent assignment signals
- `handoffs/*.md` - Context dump records
- `orchestrator.sock` - Unix socket for daemon IPC
- `orchestrator.pid` - Daemon process ID

### Daemon Architecture

`loom run` spawns a background daemon that:

1. Listens on Unix socket for status/stop commands
2. Polls stage files every 5 seconds
3. Creates git worktrees for parallel stages
4. Spawns Claude Code in terminal windows
5. Detects crashes via PID liveness checks
6. Generates git-based crash reports

### Plan Format

Plans are markdown files in `doc/plans/` with embedded YAML for use by loom:

````markdown
<!-- loom METADATA -->

```yaml
loom:
  version: 1
  stages:
    - id: stage-id
      name: "Human Name"
      description: "Task details"
      dependencies: ["other-stage"]
      acceptance: ["cargo test"]
      files: ["src/**/*.rs"]
```
````

Look in doc/plans for the plan files!

**Stage Types:** `standard` (default), `knowledge`, `integration-verify`. The `integration-verify` stage serves as the final quality gate, combining code review (security, architecture, quality) with functional verification.

<!-- END loom METADATA -->

### Plan File Lifecycle

Plan files are automatically renamed to reflect execution status:

| State       | Filename                      | When                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Not started | `PLAN-feature.md`             | Initial plan file          |
| In progress | `IN_PROGRESS-PLAN-feature.md` | After `loom run` starts    |
| Completed   | `DONE-PLAN-feature.md`        | When all stages are merged |

Behavior details:

- `loom run` renames the plan file to add `IN_PROGRESS-` prefix
- When orchestration completes successfully and all stages have `merged: true`, the prefix changes to `DONE-`
- If not all stages are merged, the plan stays as `IN_PROGRESS-` for manual intervention
- Re-running a `DONE-` plan does not rename it (prevents accidental status reset)
