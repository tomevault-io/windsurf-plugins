# Cursor Rules for onnx-hipdnn-ep

## CRITICAL: HIP Architecture Detection

When building this project, you MUST set `HIP_ARCHITECTURES` to match the target GPU.
Failure to do so will cause runtime crashes (Access Violation in hipLaunchKernel).

### How to Detect GPU Architecture

Use one of these tools from the TheRock SDK:

```bash
# Method 1: amdgpu-arch (recommended - outputs just the arch)
$THEROCK_DIST/lib/llvm/bin/amdgpu-arch
# Example output: gfx1151

# Method 2: hipInfo (look for gcnArchName field)
$THEROCK_DIST/bin/hipInfo | grep gcnArchName
# Example output: gcnArchName: gfx1151
```

### CMake Configuration

ALWAYS include `-DHIP_ARCHITECTURES=<detected-arch>` when configuring:

```bash
cmake -B ../build/onnx-hipdnn-ep -S . \
  -DTHEROCK_DIST=$THEROCK_DIST \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$PWD/../local \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/../local \
  -DHIP_PLATFORM=amd \
  -DHIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1151  # <-- CRITICAL: Use detected value!
```

### Common GPU Architectures

| GPU Model | Architecture |
|-----------|--------------|
| Radeon RX 7900 XTX/XT | gfx1100 |
| Radeon RX 7800/7700 | gfx1101, gfx1102 |
| Radeon RX 7600 | gfx1102 |
| Radeon 880M/780M (Strix Point) | gfx1150, gfx1151 |
| Radeon RX 6900/6800 | gfx1030 |

### What Happens If You Forget

If HIP_ARCHITECTURES is not set or mismatched:
- Build may succeed, but runtime will CRASH
- Error: `Exception Code: 0xC0000005` in `hipLaunchKernel`
- HIP kernels are compiled for a specific architecture and cannot run on mismatched GPUs

## Build Environment

- Use Visual Studio 2022 Developer Command Prompt or PowerShell with VS DevShell
- Use Ninja generator (not Visual Studio generator)
- THEROCK_DIST must point to TheRock ROCm SDK installation

## Shell Notes

- PowerShell 5.1: Do NOT use `&&` for command chaining (use `;` instead)
- Git Bash: `&&` works normally
