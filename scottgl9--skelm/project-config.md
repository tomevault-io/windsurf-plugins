Guidance for AI coding assistants and human contributors working on **skelm** — a TypeScript-first framework for authoring, running, and operating agentic and deterministic pipelines.

## What skelm is

skelm is a Node/TypeScript framework. The high-level unit is a **pipeline**: a typed, inspectable, executable orchestration that may be a single agent, a multi-step workflow with parallel branches, loops, and nested pipelines, or anything in between. Pipelines run from the CLI, are hosted by a long-running gateway service, and integrate with LLMs, agent runtimes, and tool servers under explicit, default-deny permissions.

If you are about to make a change to this repo, you are working on framework code that other developers and enterprises will depend on. Treat every change accordingly.

## Tenets

These are the tiebreakers. When goals conflict, the higher tenet wins.

1. **Security.** Pipelines run user code, invoke LLMs, and may drive agents with executable tools. Default-deny is the design posture. Agent permissions (allowed executables, skills, tool servers, tools, network egress, fs roots) are part of the authoring API, not an afterthought. A backend that cannot enforce a declared permission must fail at step start rather than silently bypass it.
2. **Ease of maintenance.** A small core, single-sourced vocabulary, narrow public surface, no DSL. Internals are replaceable; the API is stable. Every package boundary exists to keep blast radius small under future change.
3. **Robustness for long-running workflows.** Once a pipeline is authored, it runs reliably: typed context end-to-end, explicit error semantics, deterministic event log, durable wait/resume, no implicit magic. Failures are observable; recovery is explicit.

These tenets explicitly outrank performance, surface area, and feature breadth.

## Repo shape

```
skelm/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/        — runtime, types, builders, run store, MCP host
│   ├── cli/         — bin: skelm
│   ├── server/      — HTTP + SSE surface
│   └── gateway/     — long-running service, embeds server + scheduler
├── pipelines/
│   └── internal/    — skelm dogfooding pipelines (review, test-gen, release)
├── examples/
├── scripts/
│   └── guards/      — small focused architectural-invariant checks
├── tests/
└── docs/            — public documentation
```

`planning/` and `plan.md` (if present locally) are internal design notes, gitignored, not part of the shipped repository.

## Working with the codebase

### Before you change anything

- Read the relevant package's `README.md` and the touched module's TSDoc.
- Run `pnpm check` once on a clean tree to confirm the gates are green before you start. If gates are red on `main`, fix or revert before opening a PR for unrelated work.
- For non-trivial changes, sketch the diff in your head and check it against the tenets above. If a change makes the framework less secure, less maintainable, or less robust without a clear win in another tenet, reconsider.

### While you work

- Prefer editing existing files to creating new ones.
- Default to writing no comments. Only add one when the *why* is non-obvious — a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, a workaround. Do not explain what the code does; well-named identifiers do that.
- Avoid TODO comments. If something needs doing, open an issue or do it.
- Do not add features, refactor, or introduce abstractions beyond what the task requires. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding cleanup; a one-shot doesn't need a helper.
- Do not add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs, plugin entries).

### Implementation discipline (non-negotiable)

Every new feature, bug fix, or behavior change follows this loop **before any commit lands**:

1. **Build.** `pnpm build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors and no warnings escalated to errors.
2. **Update or write tests.** New behavior gets new tests. Changed behavior gets the existing tests updated. No exceptions for "obvious" code.
3. **Run all tests.** `pnpm check` passes — every gate, in order. Build, typecheck, lint, unit, guards, adversarial security fixtures, backend-contract suite, doc-link verification.
4. **Commit only when green.** A commit on a red tree is a defect. Pre-commit hooks block obvious failures; CI catches the rest.

If a change is large enough that intermediate states are red, develop on a branch and squash. Never push a red commit to `main`. Never bypass the pre-commit hook (`--no-verify`) without an explicit justification line in the commit body.

### Big features: commit and push at every validated checkpoint

Large features are landed in **small, green increments**. The rhythm:

1. Make a focused change (one decision per commit).
2. Run `pnpm check` — pass.
3. Validate the increment (manual smoke, fixture run, or specific test that exercises the new path).
4. Commit with a clear message.
5. Push to the working branch.
6. Continue.
