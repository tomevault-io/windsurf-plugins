# Audio Optimization Strategy

## Default Behavior

**ALL files are optimized by default with 1.2x speed** (based on A/B test results)

### Why 1.2x Speed?

A/B testing showed (see [test/compare.ts](mdc:test/compare.ts)):
- 99.5% file size reduction (2.7GB → 12.8MB)
- 9% faster processing (65.4s vs 72s)
- Same cost ($0.006/min charged on original duration)
- ~98% accuracy maintained
- Automatic timestamp adjustment back to original speed

### Implementation

See [src/optimize.ts](mdc:src/optimize.ts):

1. **Check file size**: Display size for user awareness
2. **Speed up audio**: Use FFmpeg `atempo=1.2` filter
3. **Adjust timestamps**: Divide all SRT timestamps by 1.2 to restore original timing
4. **Cleanup**: Remove optimized file after transcription

### Disabling Optimization

Users can disable with `--raw` flag:
```bash
transcribe video.mp4 --raw  # Use original audio
```

Or programmatically:
```typescript
await transcribe({ inputPath, apiKey, optimize: false })
```

### Timestamp Adjustment

Critical: All SRT timestamps must be divided by the speed factor to match original video timing.

See `adjustSRTTimestamps()` in [src/optimize.ts](mdc:src/optimize.ts) - converts timestamp to milliseconds, divides by speedFactor, then converts back.

## Alternative: Opus Compression

Tested but not used by default (see [test/test-opus.ts](mdc:test/test-opus.ts)):
- Target: <25MB files
- Uses Opus codec in OGG container
- ~99% accuracy
- Slower than speed optimization (86.8s vs 65.4s)

## When Modifying Optimization

1. Update [test/](mdc:test/) with new strategy
2. Run comparison tests
3. Update CHANGELOG with results
4. Consider making it opt-in first (new flag)
