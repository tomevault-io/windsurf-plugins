description: Run Agents Shipgate as the deterministic merge gate for AI-generated agent capability changes.
---


Agents Shipgate is the deterministic merge gate for AI-generated agent
capability changes — a local-first, static Tool-Use Readiness review.

When a change affects agent tools, MCP exports, OpenAPI specs, prompts,
permissions, approval policies, or release gates, run Agents Shipgate.
Default to advisory verification while adopting the gate.

Before protected edits, run preflight and read `PreflightResultV2`:

  agents-shipgate preflight --workspace . --plan - --json

For local agent control, run:

  shipgate check --agent cursor --workspace . --format codex-boundary-json

Read the check stdout JSON only. It is
`shipgate.codex_boundary_result/v1`; switch on `decision`,
`completion_allowed`, and `must_stop`, then follow `first_next_action`,
`human_review`, `repair`, and `policy`. Do not infer a decision from prose.

If `decision=allow` or `warn`, continue and summarize. If
`first_next_action.kind` is `repair` and `repair.safe_to_attempt=true`, make
only the listed mechanical repair and rerun the command. If
`human_review.required=true` or `must_stop=true`, stop and surface the JSON
result to a human.

Before editing `shipgate.yaml`, Shipgate CI, AGENTS/CLAUDE/Cursor rules,
policy packs, baselines, waivers, suppressions, Codex hooks/config, Codex
plugin manifests, `.mcp.json`, `.app.json`, or `SKILL.md`, run
`agents-shipgate preflight --workspace . --plan - --json` with a
`PreflightPlanV1` object. Legacy shorthands such as
`agents-shipgate preflight --changed-files changed.txt --json` remain available.
If `requires_human_review` is `true` or
`first_next_action.actor` is `human`, stop and route the change to a human.

For committed PR/CI verification, run `agents-shipgate verify --base
origin/main --head HEAD --json` after making the base ref available; it never
fetches. Read `agents-shipgate-reports/agent-handoff.json` first for
`gate.merge_verdict`, `gate.can_merge_without_human`, and `controller`; then read
`agents-shipgate-reports/verifier.json` for detailed controller context,
`agents-shipgate-reports/verify-run.json` for reproducibility metadata, and
`agents-shipgate-reports/report.json.release_decision.decision` for the
release gate.

Apply only high-confidence safe patches. Do not invent approval, confirmation,
or idempotency evidence.

Do not bypass the verifier by suppressing findings, lowering severity,
expanding baselines or waivers, removing Shipgate CI, or weakening agent
instructions. Verify-mode `SHIP-VERIFY-*` checks make those trust-root edits
release-visible.

For one-fetch counts and a deterministic next step, read
`report.json.agent_summary` (v0.12+): verdict, blocker_count,
review_item_count, auto_appliable_patches, needs_human_review,
first_recommended_action.

For per-finding routing read `findings[].agent_action` (v0.12+):
auto_apply, propose_patch_for_review, escalate_to_human,
suppress_with_reason, informational. Do not synthesize an action from
the underlying flags when the enum is present.

For reviewer triage by source reliability, run
`agents-shipgate findings --from agents-shipgate-reports/report.json
--provenance-kind keyword_heuristic,regex_heuristic --json`. The
underlying `findings[].provenance_kind` field is a filter signal only,
not a gate input.

To translate a single finding into user-facing prose, run:

  agents-shipgate explain-finding <FINGERPRINT> \
      --from agents-shipgate-reports/report.json --json

The payload includes the full Finding shape plus `metadata` (catalog
CheckMetadata) and `explanation` (a deterministic 3–5 sentence prose
summary). See `prompts/explain-finding-to-user.md` for the
translation rubric.
