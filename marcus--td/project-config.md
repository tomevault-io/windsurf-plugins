## MANDATORY: Use td for Task Management

Run td usage --new-session at conversation start (or after /clear). This tells you what to work on next.

Sessions are automatic (based on terminal/agent context). Optional:
- td session "name" to label the current session
- td session --new to force a new session in the same context

Use td usage -q after first read.

## MANDATORY: Use `td` for Task Management

Run `td usage --new-session` at conversation start (or after /clear). This tells you what to work on next.

Sessions are automatic (based on your terminal/agent context). Optional:
- `td session "name"` to label the current session
- `td session --new` to force a new session in the same context

**Do NOT start a new session mid-work.** Sessions track implementers—new session = bypass review.

Use `td usage -q` after first read.

## Build & Install

```bash
go build -o td .           # Build locally
go test ./...              # Test all
```

## Version & Release

```bash
# Commit changes with proper message
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of changes

## Architecture

- `cmd/` - Cobra commands
- `internal/db/` - SQLite (schema.go). DB stored at `<project>/.todos/issues.db`
- `internal/models/` - Issue, Log, Handoff, WorkSession
- `internal/session/` - Session management (DB-backed, scoped by branch + agent)
- `pkg/monitor/` - TUI monitor (see [docs/modal-system.md](docs/modal-system.md) for modal architecture)

Issue lifecycle: open → in_progress → in_review → closed (or blocked)

## Settings Persistence

Monitor settings stored in two places:
- **`config.json`**: pane heights, filter state (search, sort, type filter, include_closed)
- **Database**: last viewed board (`boards.last_viewed_at`), board view mode, board issue positions

Save pattern: async `tea.Cmd` via `saveFilterState()` / `savePaneHeightsAsync()` (fire-and-forget).

**Known issue**: `saveFilterState()` doesn't persist when td runs embedded in sidecar. The quit interceptor in `sidecar/internal/plugins/tdmonitor/plugin.go:241-250` wraps `tea.Batch` commands in a single `func() tea.Msg`, which may prevent Bubble Tea from dispatching batched sub-commands (like the config save alongside `fetchData`).

## Undo Support

Log actions via `database.LogAction()`. See `cmd/undo.go` for implementation.
