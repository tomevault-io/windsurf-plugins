# Context-Based Logging with Loguru
The `distant_sunburn` codebase uses Loguru with automatic extras support. You can bind contextual information to your logger and have it automatically displayed in all log messages. The logger has been set up for you already, and you can directly import it as `logger` from `loguru`.

```python
from loguru import logger

# Bind context information
logger = logger.bind(ip="192.168.1.1", user="john_doe")
logger.info("User logged in successfully")
```

For usage in classes, assign the bound logger to the class and use it thereafter.
Example:
```python
from loguru import logger

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, some_important_metadata: str):
        self.logger = logger.bind(well_chosen_name=some_important_metadata)

    def do_thing(self):
        self.logger.info("Doing thing") # will include "well_chosen_name=some_important_metadata" in the log message
```

You _must_ ensure that any complex data structures are well-formatted before binding to the logger.

**BAD**:
```python
foo = {{{{...}}}} # complex data structure
logger = logger.bind(foo=foo)
```

**GOOD**:
```python
foo = {{{{{...}}}}} # complex data structure
formatted: str = # pick elements of foo to show as a string
logger = logger.bind(foo=formatted)
```

Another pattern you can use is:
```python
from loguru import logger

with logger.contextualize(foo=foo):
    logger.info("Doing thing")
```

This is useful when you want to bind for a short period of time.

## Guidelines
1. Do not create and assign too many bound loggers.
2. If assigning a logger using `self.logger = logger.bind(...)`, do so in the `__init__` method of the class or _very sparingly_ in other dedicated methods for logging. _AVOID_ doing this dynamically in other methods.
3. Do not pass around loggers as arguments to functions.
4. Use `logger.contextualize(...)` for short-term bindings rather than assigning a logger to a class attribute.


# Common Mistakes
## Passing in arguments that have no format placeholders
```python
from loguru import logger

logger.info("This is a log message", foo="bar") # Will not be formatted
```
