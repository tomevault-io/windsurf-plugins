# Meldra Project Development Manual

This is the repository-root `AGENTS.md` for Meldra development; global Profile instructions may add general operating rules.

## Scope and Sources

- Apply this file to this repository and its subdirectories. More specific project instructions and the user's latest explicit decision take priority.
- Read relevant Markdown files completely and follow their links before editing.
- Use `docs/development.en.md` for architecture and delivery, `docs/setup-and-distribution.en.md` for distribution, `CONTEXT.md` for domain terms, and `docs/adr/` for accepted decisions.
- Treat current source, callers, tests, schemas, ADRs, upstream material, and real runtime behavior as evidence. Do not infer contracts from names.
- Preserve defaults and user-visible behavior until the exact change is investigated and approved. Make the smallest scoped change and record validation and rollback.

## Repository and Release Identity

- Product: `Meldra`. Public repository: `https://github.com/Slapq/Meldra`; public default branch: `main`.
- A private branch such as `metapi/main` is not the public tree's direct Git history.
- Never push the private development history directly to public `main` or force-push over public history.
- Publish through an existing redaction-audited public worktree or equivalent public base: apply only the approved incremental patch, audit it, then commit.
- Before publication, exclude private Profile Agent context, user Profiles and Sessions, credentials, machine paths, temporary files, build output, unreviewed external sources, and internal files not approved for the public tree. Repository governance files may be published only when they are intentional source files in the reviewed patch.

## Version Boundaries

- Meldra product tags such as `v0.1.1` are independent from Pi workspace package versions.
- The private root version is a Pi workspace baseline field; `packages/coding-agent/package.json` retains its upstream Pi package version; Starter has its own Profile package version; public Pi packages retain upstream lockstep versions.
- Do not mechanically align product tags, CLI, Starter, workspace packages, dependency ranges, lockfiles, or shrinkwraps.
- `scripts/sync-versions.js` and the upstream `scripts/release.mjs` implement Pi workspace/npm release semantics. Do not use them as the Meldra product release flow without an explicit version decision.

## Pi, Meldra, and Runtime Boundaries

- Meldra is a distribution and compatibility layer over Pi, not the upstream Pi project or release repository.
- User-facing CLI names and errors use `meldra`; compatibility code may retain `metapi` names and upstream package/import names.
- Preserve upstream capabilities, parameters, errors, and protocol semantics. Put Meldra behavior in Profiles, Starter, providers, adapters, Extensions, or explicit boundaries.
- Native Meldra Profiles, the reserved Pi compatibility Profile, and external Profile Runtimes do not implicitly share state, Sessions, models, Skills, packages, plugins, or lifecycle.
- External Runtimes remain authoritative for their Agent loop, protocol, state, and native capabilities; do not reproduce them in generic Pi core.

## Profile, Starter, and Package State

- Keep user assets, user preferences, Profile `agentDir`, project `.pi`, Session overrides, and external Runtime state in their documented ownership domains.
- Starter source is `packages/coding-agent/starter-profile/`; a deployed Profile package is a separate copy. Distinguish source tests, Bundle restore, and deployed validation.
- Read `packages/coding-agent/starter-profile/DEVELOPMENT.md` and `docs/extensions/profile-config-protocol.md` before Starter or Profile Config changes.
- Keep Starter top-level Extension entries unique. `questionnaire.ts` is imported by Workflows and must not be registered as another package entry.
- Never clean, rewrite, migrate, or delete existing Profiles, packages, settings, model assets, Sessions, or credentials to simplify tests or release work. Upgrade and uninstall preserve user state.
- `meldra install` and `remove` must await Settings flush before reporting success. Normal package commands resolve `agentDir` from the active Profile; tests may inject an isolated directory.
- Project-local `-l` writes to project `.pi` and requires project trust or explicit `--approve`. Use `node:path` in Windows-sensitive tests.
- Meldra distribution self-update is disabled. Mark unsupported upstream paths explicitly; never fake success.

## Windows and Installer Rules

- Validate Unix socket filesystem semantics only on Unix. Do not present Windows named pipes as inode, chmod, stale-socket, or Unix `EACCES` compatibility.
- Installer source is `scripts/windows-installer/`; build with `scripts/build-windows-installers.mjs` and Inno Setup 6.
- A formal Windows release produces `Meldra-Setup.exe`, `Meldra-Setup-NodeJS.exe`, and `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- Preserve the existing AppId and install directory so installer variants upgrade each other in place. Never implement upgrade as user-data deletion and reinstall.
