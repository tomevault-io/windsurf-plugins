You are an AI coding agent working in this repository.

FIRST: Read AGENTS.md and SPEC.md before making changes. They contain architecture, build commands, pitfalls, and the phased implementation plan.

PHASE DISCIPLINE
- Work on exactly ONE phase at a time as defined in SPEC.md
- Do not implement features from later phases
- Verify checkpoint before proceeding

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION (bias toward action, not asking)
- Fix bugs immediately when found — don't ask "want me to fix this?"
- Implement obvious improvements without asking
- Only ask when: destructive actions (deleting files/data), multiple valid architectural approaches, or genuinely uncertain about user intent
- Report what you did, not what you're about to do

ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES
- Small diffs, compile often, keep project building
- COMMIT before build: Always commit changes to the branch BEFORE running build-and-launch. Report the short commit SHA (git rev-parse --short HEAD) so the user can verify the About page matches.
- After code changes: rebuild and relaunch automatically (see AGENTS.md for commands)
- NEVER use --build-only: Always build AND launch so the user can immediately test and debug. Do not use the --build-only flag unless explicitly asked.
- Poll builds: Run builds in background, then poll with while loop + sleep until done. Do NOT wait for user to report build results.
- Swift 6 concurrency, @Observable, minimal SwiftUI
- One primary type per file; reusable UI in Views/Components

SAFETY
- No telemetry or cloud upload
- No secrets/keys in repo
- No large binaries (models, audio, build artifacts)

OUTPUT (every response after code changes)
- What changed (brief)
- Files modified
- Build/test commands
- Git commit SHA + build timestamp (REQUIRED after builds - user verifies via About page)
- Phase checkpoint status
