## graphify

This project uses a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Note: graphify-out/ is **gitignored** (machine-specific generated output). It won't exist on a fresh clone — run `graphify update .` once to generate it locally. The rules below apply only when the files are present.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

## Loop protocol

Every **code change** runs as a loop, not a line. Sessions with no code changes
(brainstorming, design, planning, config review) skip this loop entirely.

1. Write the change.
2. Run the checks: `xcodebuild test -scheme QuickProtect -destination 'platform=macOS' -quiet`,
   then `swiftlint --strict`. No silencing errors with try?, try!, force-unwraps, or empty catch blocks.
3. If anything fails, read the error, fix the cause, go back to step 2.
4. Repeat up to 5 times.

Stop conditions:
- All checks pass: report "done" with the passing output as proof.
- 5 attempts used: stop and report what still fails and what you tried.
- Same error appears twice in a row: stop. You're guessing, not fixing.

Never report "done" without check output from this session.
Never fix a test by weakening it. Fix the code, not the test.

Hook enforcement (see .claude/settings.json):
- Editing a `.swift` file marks the session "dirty" (a `/tmp/qp-dirty-$SESSION_ID`
  marker) and runs a fast per-file lint that blocks only on **error-severity** violations.
- On Stop, if the session is dirty, the full gate runs automatically: `xcodebuild test`
  then `swiftlint --strict` (whole project). Either failure blocks the stop and is fed
  back for fixing. A clean (non-code) session stops immediately with no checks.

SwiftLint baseline: .swiftlint.yml disables rules the legacy code still violates.
Don't add new violations of those rules; re-enable rules as files get cleaned up.
