# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for the LunchMoney personal finance API (v2). Provides 59 tools across 10 domains (transactions, categories, budgets, manual accounts, tags, recurring items, user, Plaid accounts, crypto, balance history). Uses stdio transport and is published to npm as `@akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp`.

## Commands

- `npm run build` — compile TypeScript and chmod the entry point
- `npm run build:mcpb` — build + package as `.mcpb` for Claude Desktop
- `npm run dev` — run with MCP Inspector (set `LUNCHMONEY_API_TOKEN` in the script first)
- `npm run format` — run Prettier on the entire codebase

- `npm test` — build, then run the test suite with Node's built-in runner

Tests live in `test/*.test.mjs` and are plain ESM JavaScript, not TypeScript: `tsconfig.json` sets `rootDir: ./src`, so tests can't be compiled by the main build. They import the **compiled** output from `build/`, which is why `npm test` builds first — that also makes the run a typecheck. Shared fixtures (sandbox directories, magic-byte samples, env-var juggling) live in `test/helpers.mjs`; use them rather than rolling new ones.

Coverage is currently limited to `src/attachments.ts`, the security-sensitive path from [issue #16](https://github.com/akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp/issues/16). The tool handlers themselves are still exercised manually via `npm run dev` with the MCP Inspector against a real LunchMoney account.

`npm run lint` is currently broken — `typescript-eslint` does not yet support TypeScript 7. This predates the test suite.

A husky pre-commit hook runs `npm run format` automatically before every commit.

## Architecture

**Entry point:** `src/index.ts` — creates `McpServer`, registers all tool modules, initializes config, connects via `StdioServerTransport`.

**Config:** `src/config.ts` — singleton initialized at startup via `initializeConfig()`. Requires `LUNCHMONEY_API_TOKEN` env var. Base URL (`https://api.lunchmoney.dev/v2`) is hardcoded. Access via `getConfig()`.

**Debug logging:** Set `LUNCHMONEY_DEBUG=true` to log API requests and responses (method, path, status, duration, body) to stderr. Controlled via `isDebug()` in `src/api.ts`.

**Types:** `src/types.ts` — TypeScript interfaces matching LunchMoney API response shapes (snake_case field names).

**Attachments:** `src/attachments.ts` — reads local files for `attach_file_to_transaction`. Treats `file_path` as hostile input, since it reaches the server from a model that may be acting on untrusted content. The MIME type is decided by sniffing the file's leading bytes, never by its extension or the caller's `content_type`; the optional `LUNCHMONEY_ATTACHMENTS_DIR` confines reads to one directory, enforced after `realpath`. Kept as its own module so it can be unit-tested without standing up an `McpServer`. Changes here need a matching test in `test/`.

**Tools:** `src/tools/` — one file per domain. Each exports a `register[Domain]Tools(server: McpServer)` function called from `index.ts`.

**Response format:** `src/format.ts` — uses [TOON](https://github.com/nicfontaine/toon) encoding instead of JSON for tool responses. TOON is a compact text format that reduces token count by stripping quotes and braces. Before encoding, `compact()` drops object keys that are blank (null/undefined/empty array) in every element of an array, while keeping keys that are partially present as explicit nulls. This preserves key uniformity across rows so TOON emits its compact tabular form (header once, rows as CSV) instead of a verbose repeated-key list. Primitive arrays (e.g. `tag_ids`) are joined into a single `|`-delimited scalar so they don't disqualify a row from the tabular form; arrays of objects (e.g. `children`, `files`) are left intact and compacted recursively.

## Tool Implementation Pattern

Every tool uses `server.registerTool()` with a config object containing `description`, optional `inputSchema`, and `annotations`:

```typescript
import { formatData } from "../format.js";

server.registerTool(
    "snake_case_name",
    {
        description: "Description for AI",
        inputSchema: {
            /* Zod fields with .describe() — no z.object() wrapper */
            field: z.string().describe("Field description"),
        },
        annotations: {
            readOnlyHint: true, // see annotation guide below
        },
    },
    async ({ field }) => {
        const response = await api.get(`/endpoint`);
        if (!response.ok) {
            return handleApiError(response, "Failed to do something");
        }
        return dataResponse(await response.json());
    },
);
```

In practice, prefer the shared helpers from `src/api.ts`:
`api.{get,post,put,delete,upload}` (which include retry, debug
logging, and auth), plus `dataResponse`, `successResponse`,
`handleApiError`, and `catchError`.

Key conventions:

- Tool names are `snake_case`; Zod `.describe()` is required on all parameters for AI discoverability
- All responses use `formatData()` (TOON encoding) — never raw JSON or markdown
- Error responses use `errorResponse()` and `getErrorMessage()` from `src/errors.ts`
