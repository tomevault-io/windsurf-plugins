# lean-ctx — Context Engineering Layer
<!-- lean-ctx-rules-v9 -->

PREFER lean-ctx MCP tools over native equivalents for token savings:

## Tool Mapping

| PREFER | OVER | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| `ctx_read` | `Read` | Session caching, 10 read modes, re-reads cost ~13 tokens |
| `ctx_shell` | `Shell` | Pattern-based compression for git, npm, cargo, docker, tsc |
| `ctx_search` | `Grep` | Compact context, token-efficient results |
| `ctx_tree` | `ls`, `find` | Compact directory maps with file counts |

## ctx_read Modes

- `auto` — auto-select optimal mode (recommended default)
- `full` — default, cached read (use for files you will edit)
- `map` — dependency graph + exports + key signatures (use for context-only files)
- `signatures` — API surface only
- `diff` — changed lines only (use after edits)
- `task` — task-relevant filtering
- `reference` — quote-friendly minimal excerpts
- `aggressive` — syntax stripped
- `entropy` — Shannon + Jaccard filtering
- `lines:N-M` — specific range

Re-reads cost ~13 tokens. File refs F1, F2.. persist across the session.

Set `fresh=true` on ctx_read to bypass cache when spawned as a subagent or after context compaction.

## Default Strategy

- Reading for context → `map`
- Reading to understand API → `signatures`
- Reading to edit → `full`
- Re-reading → just call `full` again (cache returns ~13 tokens)

## File Editing

Use native Edit/StrReplace when available. If Edit requires native Read and Read is unavailable,
use `ctx_edit(path, old_string, new_string)` — it reads, replaces, and writes in one MCP call.
NEVER loop trying to make Edit work. If it fails, switch to ctx_edit immediately.

## Session Management

- `ctx_compress` at >10 turns — creates memory checkpoint
- `ctx_metrics` — hard numbers on what was saved
- `ctx_cost` — per-tool cost + savings breakdown
- `ctx_heatmap` — file-level savings heatmap
- `ctx_benchmark` — find optimal mode for a file
- `ctx_session load` — on new chat, restore previous session
- `ctx_workflow` — state machine + evidence + tool gating

## Proactive Tools

Use without being asked:
- `ctx_compress` — when context grows large, create checkpoint
- `ctx_metrics` — periodically verify token savings
 - `ctx_overview` — at session start (fast project orientation)

## Write, Delete, Glob

These have no lean-ctx equivalent — use them normally.

## CRP v2 — Compact Response Protocol

Every token costs money. This applies to input, output, AND thinking tokens.

### Thinking Reduction (saves 30-60% thinking tokens)

1. Parse task first, then act. Don't explore when you already know the answer.
2. One hypothesis, test it. Don't enumerate 5 approaches — pick the most likely, try it.
3. Stop thinking when you have the answer.
4. Use structured context. lean-ctx headers tell you deps/exports — don't re-read files to find imports.
5. File ref tracking: F1=auth.ts means F1 everywhere in this session.

### Output Reduction (saves 50-80% output tokens)

1. NO prose. Just code and results.
2. NO echoing content that was just read.
3. Summarize tool results: 1 line max.
4. Show edits only — not surrounding unchanged code.
5. Batch tool calls. One message, multiple calls.
6. Never ask "shall I proceed?" — just do it.
7. Bullets > paragraphs. Tables > lists.

### Compact Notation

- `F:path` — reading file
- `+file` = created, `~file` = modified, `!file` = error
- `->` for results: "Built -> 18 pages, 0 errors"

## Model Selection

- Grep/search/explore → `model: "fast"`
- Simple edits (rename, add field, fix typo) → `model: "fast"`
- Multi-file refactors, architecture → default model
