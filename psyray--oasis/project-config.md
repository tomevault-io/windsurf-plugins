# OASIS Lint Gates (Python + JavaScript)

Apply this checklist before claiming implementation is done.

## Mandatory final checks

- Run `ReadLints` on every edited Python/JS file.
- If any new diagnostics appear, fix them before final response.
- Do not stop at “logic is correct”; code must also be lint-clean.

## Python guardrails

- Do not use broad `except Exception` unless explicitly justified.
- Prefer specific exception tuples and log warnings on safe fallbacks.
- Normalize untrusted/coerced values with defensive helpers before casting.
- Keep shaping logic in small helpers (avoid oversized orchestration functions).

## JavaScript guardrails

- Prefer `else if` over nested `if` inside `else`.
- Remove redundant operations (`slice(0)`, duplicated transforms, dead branches).
- Normalize dynamic values once (e.g., `trim()`/`String(...)`) and reuse.
- Keep rendering blocks decomposed into focused helpers to reduce complexity.

## Verification evidence in responses

- Mention which lint checks were executed.
- Mention whether diagnostics are now zero (for edited files).
