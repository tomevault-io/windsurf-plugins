# AI Agent Instructions for openclaw-crypto-ai-quant

This file is the short catalogue for AI coding agents working in this
repository. Keep it concise. Load deeper instructions on demand from
`docs/agent-instructions/` instead of expanding this file again.

## Catalogue Contract

- Do not change `AGENTS.md` or its core guardrails unless the user explicitly
  asks to update repository agent instructions.
- `AGENTS.md` keeps only essential repository-wide instructions that every
  agent must know before starting work.
- Topic-specific guidance belongs in `docs/agent-instructions/` and should be
  loaded only when the task needs it.
- Expand the instruction system by adding or splitting topic modules under
  `docs/agent-instructions/`, not by turning `AGENTS.md` back into a monolith.

## Non-Negotiable Guardrails

- The production worktree at `/home/fol2hk/openclaw-plugins/ai_quant` MUST stay
  on `master`.
- Never run branch-changing commands inside
  `/home/fol2hk/openclaw-plugins/ai_quant`.
- Never edit application code directly in the production worktree.
- Make every code change in a separate non-`master` worktree, for example
  `/home/fol2hk/openclaw-plugins/ai_quant_wt/<ticket-branch>`.
- Every change MUST land as one atomic PR to `master`: exactly one logical
  change per PR, with no unrelated batching.
- Do not commit ticket work directly on `master`.
- Mandatory PR flow for every successful code update:
  1. Create one atomic PR to `master`.
  2. Before PR review, run a documentation subagent for that PR.
  3. Have the documentation subagent update the relevant repo docs, refresh the
     active plan doc when the task follows one, and refactor docs if coverage
     or structure needs improvement.
  4. Run a reviewer subagent for that PR only after the documentation pass is
     complete.
  5. Be patient with PR reviewer subagents: let them finish, avoid duplicate
     reviewer launches, and do not interrupt them unless the review context has
     genuinely changed.
  6. Merge only after the review is acceptable.
  7. After merge, delete the PR branch locally and remotely if you created it.
  8. After merge, remove the PR worktree(s) if you created them.
  9. After merge, close any subagents opened specifically for that PR.
  10. Move to the next task only after the merge and cleanup are complete.
- Never delete branches, worktrees, or subagents owned by other concurrent
  agents or sessions.
- Never commit sensitive material, including `secrets.json`, `.env`, private
  keys, wallet addresses, or API keys.
- Never disable kill switches or weaken live-trading guardrails without explicit
  user approval.
- Never auto-tune strategy configuration through unattended scripts. Suggestion
  mode only.

## Active Stack

Active execution ownership lives in:

- `runtime/aiq-runtime` and `runtime/aiq-runtime-core`
- `backtester/`
- `ws_sidecar/`
- `hub/`

The repository is zero-Python in the active trust chain. Treat legacy
alternate-language runtime/tooling assumptions as obsolete unless the user asks
about archived history.

## Operational Defaults

- Config merge order:
  `Rust defaults <- global YAML <- symbols.<SYM> YAML <- live YAML`.
- `engine.interval` is not hot-reloadable; restart the affected service if it
  changes.
- Keep production on the `production` profile unless the user explicitly wants
  a parity/debug lane.
- `entry_min_confidence` defaults to `high`; set it explicitly to `low` in YAML
  if all confidence tiers should pass.
- Hyperliquid REST backfill is window-limited. Always query real DB coverage and
  keep backtests on identical date ranges across intervals.
- Rust indicator changes must match the external Python `ta` reference within
  `0.00005` absolute error.
- Use `behaviour_trace` plus `pipeline` inspection before changing runtime or
  parity logic.
- Use `parity_baseline` and `parity_exit_isolation` before ad hoc debug edits.
- Treat replay-alignment gates as fail-closed unless the user explicitly
  approves an emergency bypass.

## Load On Demand Catalogue

Load only the instruction file you need from `docs/agent-instructions/`:

| Topic | Load on demand |
|---|---|
| Index of all instruction docs | `docs/agent-instructions/README.md` |
| SDLC, branching, documentation sweep, PR flow, and review patience | `docs/agent-instructions/sdlc.md` |
| Runtime ownership, services, and operator commands | `docs/agent-instructions/runtime-and-operations.md` |
| Config rules, parity lanes, and debugging flow | `docs/agent-instructions/configuration-and-debugging.md` |
| Backtester, GPU parity, and validation rules | `docs/agent-instructions/backtester-and-parity.md` |
| Release/versioning guidance | `docs/agent-instructions/release-and-versioning.md` |

If a new topic does not fit an existing module, add a new file under
`docs/agent-instructions/` and keep the main catalogue short.

## Quick Commands

Use these first-class commands before inventing alternatives:

```bash
cargo run -p aiq-runtime -- paper effective-config --lane paper1 --project-dir "$PWD" --json
cargo run -p aiq-runtime -- pipeline --mode paper --json
cargo run --manifest-path backtester/Cargo.toml -p bt-cli -- replay --candles-db candles_dbs/candles_1h.db
echo "close_only" > /tmp/ai-quant-kill
```
