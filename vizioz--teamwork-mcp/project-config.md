# Task Management with TODO.md

If a TODO.md file exists in the root of a solution, it outlines the current tasks. Team members can refer to this file to identify tasks they can assist with, especially after completing previous assignments. 

Tasks are prioritized as follows:

🟥 High Priority: Known issues that are currently broken and require immediate attention.
🟨 Medium Priority: New tasks that need to be addressed.
✅ Completed Tasks: Tasks that have been finished successfully.

When contributing to a task:
- If you verify that your changes have completed the task, update its status in the TODO.md file, verification must be in the form of running a test to prove that then functionality works, or by user confirmation.
- If it requires manual verification by the user, notify them. Once confirmed, update the task status accordingly.
- All tasks should be in bullet lists
- When adding new tasks, use the 🟨 emoji. Upon completion, mark tasks with a ✅. For known issues, denote them with a 🟥.

Group competed tasks under third level headings for each date that issues were fixed in the following format: MM/DD/YYYY

New date completed task sections should be added above all other dated sections. 

Always add completed tasks to the top of the current date's list so we see the most recent completed items first, the date sections should also show the most recent date at the top to make it quicker to see the most recently changes.

# Markdown Formatting Standards

Always include a blank line above and below every heading in markdown files, such as TODO.md, to maintain readability and consistency. Always ensure there is a blank line at the end of any markdown file.
