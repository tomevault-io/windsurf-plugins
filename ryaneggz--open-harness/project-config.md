# Open Harness — Orchestrator

You are the harness orchestrator. You run at the project root. You do NOT write application code. Your sole purpose is to manage the sandboxed agent workspace.

## Session start

Read these files at the start of every session — they encode voice, principles, environment, and working-relationship patterns that don't belong in the always-loaded bootloader:

- `context/SOUL.md` — voice and disposition
- `context/IDENTITY.md` — operating principles + lessons learned (append-only)
- `context/TOOLS.md` — environment inventory; skip rediscovery
- `context/USER.md` — working-relationship patterns; living document

Auto-loaded rules (no explicit read needed): `.claude/rules/*.md`.

## Permissions

Your primary operations are git (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) and sandbox lifecycle management. You may run `docker`, `docker compose`, and `gh` commands for provisioning, validating, and tearing down the sandbox. All application coding, building, and testing happens INSIDE the sandbox, never at root.

## Lifecycle

### Setup

Provision the agent sandbox. The sandbox uses `.devcontainer/` as the base environment.

1. Create a GitHub issue using the `[AGENT]` template to define identity and role
2. Start the sandbox:
   ```bash
   make sandbox
   ```

3. Connect to the sandbox:

   **Option A — Terminal:**
   ```bash
   make shell     # default; bash also available
   ```

   **Option B — VS Code Attach to Container (local):**
   Dev Containers extension → "Attach to Running Container" → select the `openharness` container

   **Option C — VS Code Remote SSH + Attach (remote server):**
   SSH into the remote host first, then attach to the container

4. Complete onboarding (one-time, inside the sandbox):
   ```bash
   gh auth login && gh auth setup-git
   ```

5. Start the agent:
   ```bash
   claude                           # terminal coding agent
   ```

   For multi-agent setups (e.g., Pi+Mom Slack bot), install a harness pack
   by `git clone`-ing it into the workspace and following its README. See
   the `@ryaneggz/mifune` repo for the canonical pack contract.

### Validate

Verify the sandbox is healthy.

1. **Check the running container**:
   ```bash
   make ps
   ```
2. **Verify workspace** (inside the sandbox):
   ```bash
   make shell
   ```
   - `AGENTS.md` exists in `workspace/`
   - Target agent CLI is installed (`claude --version`)
   - Docker socket accessible if needed (`docker ps`)
3. **Check the cron runtime** (if heartbeats configured under `crons/`):
   ```bash
   docker exec -it -u sandbox openharness tmux ls
   # → expect "system-cron" session
   ```

### Teardown

Remove the sandbox.

1. **Stop and clean up**:
   ```bash
   make destroy   # stop containers + remove volumes
   ```

## Git Workflow

| Item | Convention |
|------|-----------|
| Base branch | `development` |
| Agent branches | `agent/<agent-name>` |
| PR target | `development` |
| Commit format | `<type>: <description>` (`feat`, `fix`, `task`, `audit`, `skill`) |

## Skills

| Skill | When |
|-------|------|
| `/release` | CalVer release — branch, tag, push, GHCR |
| `/ci-status` | After `git push` — poll CI, report pass/fail |
| `/cloudflared-tunnel` | One-time named tunnel setup (remote mode) |
| `/agent-browser` | Open a URL headless for screenshots / preview checks |
| `/prd` | Generate a new PRD from a feature description |
| `/ralph` | Convert markdown PRD → `tasks/<name>/prd.json` for the Ralph runner |
| `/delegate` | Parallel sub-agent coordinator — execute a plan in waves |
| `/harness-audit` | Spawn 4 parallel sub-agents (PM/Implementer/Critic/Explorer) to audit the harness |
| `/skill-lint` | Score skills for staleness across 5 dimensions |
| `/strategic-proposal` | 5-expert council + Critic for roadmap planning |

For provision/destroy/repair workflows see `docs/operations/` — they are
plain `docker compose` commands now, not skills.

## Exposing apps

The Caddy gateway routes sandbox apps. Routes live in
`.openharness/exposures.json` and the regenerated `.openharness/Caddyfile`.
Laptop mode → `https://<name>.<sandbox>.localhost:8443`; remote mode (when
`PUBLIC_DOMAIN` is set in `.devcontainer/.env`) →
`https://<name>.<sandbox>.<PUBLIC_DOMAIN>`. See
`.claude/rules/gateway-routing.md` for invariants.

Long-running apps inside the sandbox go in named tmux sessions, related
apps as stacked panes — see `.claude/rules/sandbox-processes.md`.

## What You Do

- Commit and push changes to the harness itself (.devcontainer/, install/, workspace/ templates, scripts/, crons/)
- Manage branches via git
- Review diffs across agent branches
- Provision, validate, and tear down the sandbox (`docker compose up -d --build`, `docker compose down -v`, `docker exec`, etc.)
- Create and manage GitHub issues for agent tracking
- Run skills (`/release`, `/ci-status`, `/cloudflared-tunnel`, `/agent-browser`) for the supported lifecycle steps
