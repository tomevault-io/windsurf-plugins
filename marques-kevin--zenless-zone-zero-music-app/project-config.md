# Storing YouTube-Downloaded Songs

When a user downloads a song from YouTube using `yarn mp3`, follow these steps to properly store it in the database:

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Move and Rename the File

- **Source**: Files are downloaded to `scripts/youtube-downloader/files/`
- **Destination**: Move to `musics/` directory
- **Naming Convention**: `{version}--{title-in-kebab-case}.mp3`
  - Example: `Ye_Shunguang_EP_-_A_Thousand_First_Meetings_Zenless_Zone_Zero.mp3` → `2.5--ye-shunguang-ep--a-thousand-first-meetings.mp3`
  - Filename must start with the ZZZ version (e.g., `2.4`, `2.5`)
  - Use double dashes (`--`) to separate version from title
  - Convert title to kebab-case (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces)

### 2. Get Track Duration

Run the duration script:

```bash
./scripts/get-music-durations.sh "filename.mp3"
```

or multiple files

```bash
./scripts/get-music-durations.sh "2.5-*.mp3"
```

The output will show the duration in seconds (e.g., `292.392000` → use `292`).

### 3. Determine Album and Artist

- **Version Albums**: Tracks belong to version albums (e.g., `2.4`, `2.5`) defined in `src/database/albums.ts`
- **Character Albums**: If the track is character-specific (EP, theme), it may also belong to a character album
- **Artists**: Use version numbers as artists (e.g., `Artists["2.5"]`)

### 4. Add Track to Version Album

Edit the version album file (e.g., `src/database/albums/2.5.ts`):

```typescript
{
  title: "Ye Shunguang EP - A Thousand First Meetings",
  title_id: "ye-shunguang-ep--a-thousand-first-meetings", // kebab-case, unique
  source: "/musics/2.5--ye-shunguang-ep--a-thousand-first-meetings.mp3",
  duration: 292, // from step 2
  created_at: new Date("2025-12-26"), // release date
  ...Artists["2.5"], // spread artist
}
```

Then map to add album properties:

```typescript
].map((track) => ({
  ...track,
  ...Albums["2.5"],
}));
```

### 5. Add Character Album (if applicable)

If the track is character-specific (EP, character theme):

**5a. Add album definition** to `src/database/albums.ts`:

```typescript
"ye-shunguang": {
  playlist_name: "Ye Shunguang",
  playlist_cover: "/characters/ye_shunguang.webp",
  playlist_id: "ye-shunguang",
  playlist_type: "character",
},
```

**5b. Create character album file** `src/database/albums/ye-shunguang.ts`:

```typescript
import { Track } from "@/types/track.type";
import { Albums } from "../albums";
import { Artists } from "../artists";

export const YeShunguangTracks: Track[] = [
  {
    title: "Ye Shunguang EP - A Thousand First Meetings",
    title_id: "ye-shunguang-ep--a-thousand-first-meetings",
    source: "/musics/2.5--ye-shunguang-ep--a-thousand-first-meetings.mp3",
    duration: 292,
    created_at: new Date("2025-12-26"),
    ...Artists["2.5"],
  },
].map((track) => ({
  ...track,
  ...Albums["ye-shunguang"],
}));
```

### 6. Update tracks.ts

**6a. Add import** at the top:

```typescript
import { YeShunguangTracks } from "./albums/ye-shunguang";
```

**6b. Add to exports** in the `Tracks` array:

```typescript
export const Tracks: Track[] = [
  // ... other tracks
  ...YeShunguangTracks,
];
```

### 7. Verify

- Check that `title_id` is unique across all tracks
- Ensure file path matches actual file location
- Verify duration is accurate
- Confirm album and artist exist in their respective files

## Important Notes

- **Same track, multiple albums**: If a track belongs to both a version album and character album, create separate entries with the same `title_id` but different album spreads
- **File naming**: Always use double dashes (`--`) between version and title
- **title_id**: Must be unique, kebab-case, and match the filename pattern (without version prefix)
- **Character images**: Ensure character image exists in `static/characters/` or `public/characters/`
- **Date format**: Use `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")` for `created_at`

## Example: Complete Flow

1. File downloaded: `scripts/youtube-downloader/files/Ye_Shunguang_EP_-_A_Thousand_First_Meetings_Zenless_Zone_Zero.mp3`
2. Move & rename: `musics/2.5--ye-shunguang-ep--a-thousand-first-meetings.mp3`
3. Get duration: `292 seconds`
4. Add to `2.5.ts` (version album)
5. Create `ye-shunguang.ts` (character album) if needed
6. Add album definition to `albums.ts` if new character
7. Import and export in `tracks.ts`
8. Done!
