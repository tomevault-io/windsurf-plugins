# AGENTS.md

## Development

* `make all` builds and tests everything - a good general check
* `make test` runs the full test suite and should always pass
* `make check` runs assorted linters and should always pass
* `make fix` will attempt assorted auto-fixes and also do a partial lint run and is worth running after every change

## Documentation

* Update documentation in `docs/source` where appropriate

## Style

* Prefer to declare variables as `var foo = bar` and not `foo := bar`, unless necessary e.g. with a `for` loop variable
* As this started as a port from C (Dire Wolf) there are a lot of things that aren't idiomatic Go yet - new things should be, but we don't need to change existing things if not necessary
* Prefer to use `new(Foo)` over `&Foo{}` - the latter makes the exhaustruct linter grumble

### Test Callsigns

* Use `Q1TEST`, `Q2TEST`, etc. as synthetic callsigns in tests - the `Q` prefix is ITU-reserved for Q-codes and never assigned to amateur radio operators, so these can't be real callsigns
* Avoid `N0CALL` as a test callsign - Dire Wolf uses it as a sentinel value

### Test File Naming

* Per Go convention, generally tests for `foo.go` live in `foo_test.go` but we also do the following:
    * Tests ported from Dire Wolf are often in `foo_test_shim.go` because `go test` doesn't support cgo in _test.go files so that was a place to put the test code while the port was ongoing. Now we don't (directly) use cgo, this is obsolete, and they should live in `foo_direwolf_test.go` - kept separately to make it easier to track upstream
    * Tests where an LLM has just generated a test suite for complex functionality live in `foo_impl_test.go` - this signifies that they don't necessarily reflect intended/specified behaviour, they just test an implementation as-is, so failing tests may not necessarily signify a bug

## Licensing

* `make reuse` checks [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) compliance and must always pass
* New files should have copyright assigned to "The Samoyed Authors" and be GPL-2.0-or-later, as per REUSE.toml
* New individual files should declare this via SPDX headers where possible - if adding new entire directories, then adding an annotation path to REUSE.toml is acceptable
