# SkipClass — Agent Directive

> 此文件是本项目最高行为准则。所有 AI Agent 必须遵守。

**规则 1：涉及代码操作前必须先 `skill()` 加载对应 Superpowers Skill，禁止凭记忆执行。**

**规则 2：文档管理（TODO、归档、技术债、决策记录）必须严格 `skill(name="skipclass-doc-management")` 执行，详见该 Skill 完整流程。**

Skill 映射表：`brainstorming`(新功能) | `writing-plans`(计划) | `executing-plans`(执行) | `test-driven-development`(实现) | `systematic-debugging`(调试) | `verification-before-completion`(验证) | `requesting-code-review`(审查) | `dispatching-parallel-agents`(并行) | `using-git-worktrees`(隔离)

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

LLMs often pick an interpretation silently and run with it. This principle forces explicit reasoning:

- **State assumptions explicitly** — If uncertain, ask rather than guess
- **Present multiple interpretations** — Don't pick silently when ambiguity exists
- **Push back when warranted** — If a simpler approach exists, say so
- **Stop when confused** — Name what's unclear and ask for clarification

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

Combat the tendency toward overengineering:

- No features beyond what was asked
- No abstractions for single-use code
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested
- No error handling for impossible scenarios
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it

**The test:** Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked

**The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform imperative tasks into verifiable goals:

| Instead of... | Transform to... |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "Add validation" | "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass" |
| "Fix the bug" | "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass" |
| "Refactor X" | "Ensure tests pass before and after" |

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```
