# Conventional Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for every commit message.

## Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

- **First line**: type (required), optional scope in parentheses, colon and space, short description in imperative mood (lowercase, no period).
- **Body** (optional): wrap at 72 chars; explain what and why, not how.
- **Footer** (optional): e.g. `BREAKING CHANGE:`, `Refs #123`.

## Types

| Type       | Use for |
|-----------|---------|
| `feat`    | New feature (MINOR bump) |
| `fix`     | Bug fix (PATCH bump) |
| `docs`    | Documentation only |
| `style`   | Formatting, whitespace, no code change |
| `refactor`| Code change that is not a fix or feature |
| `perf`    | Performance improvement |
| `test`    | Adding or updating tests |
| `build`   | Build system, dependencies, tooling |
| `ci`      | CI configuration |
| `chore`   | Other changes (e.g. repo maintenance) |
| `revert`  | Revert a previous commit |

## Examples

```text
feat(api): add pagination to skills list
fix(auth): resolve token expiry race condition
docs: update README installation steps
chore(deps): bump composer dependencies
feat(parser)!: drop support for PHP 7.4

BREAKING CHANGE: PHP 8.0+ is now required.
```

## Rules

- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature".
- No period at the end of the subject line.
- For breaking changes, use `!` after type/scope and/or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
- When suggesting or writing commits, always use this format.
