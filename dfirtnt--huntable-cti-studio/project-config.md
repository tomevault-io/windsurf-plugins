# Agent Config — Test Mutation Confirmation

## Rule

You **MUST** double-check and get **explicit confirmation** from the user before:

1. **Creating new tests** that mutate active agent configs (e.g., workflow config, agent prompts, LLM provider settings).
2. **Running existing tests** that mutate active agent configs.

## What Counts as Mutating Agent Configs

- Writing to or modifying workflow configuration files
- Changing agent prompts, presets, or prompt versions
- Altering LLM provider/model settings used by the running system
- Tests that call APIs or services that persist config changes to the active environment

## Required Behavior

- **Before** proposing or implementing such tests: state that they will mutate agent configs and ask for explicit approval.
- **Before** running such tests: confirm with the user that they approve the run.
- Do **not** assume approval from "go", "implement", or "run tests" unless the user has explicitly confirmed they approve config-mutating tests.

## Example

```
⚠️ These tests will modify active workflow/agent config. Do you approve running them?
```

Wait for explicit "yes" or equivalent before proceeding.
