description: Modal UX contract — Escape, click-away, stack, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter

# Modal UX Contract

**Authoritative source:** `docs/contracts/ui-designer.md` Section 6. This file is a condensed mirror kept only so Cursor auto-attaches it when `modal-manager.js` or templates are open -- edit the canonical doc first, then sync this excerpt; don't let them diverge.

Quick reference (see Section 6 for full rules): Escape closes the topmost modal only, restoring the previous stack entry or the base page; click-away behaves the same via `elementFromPoint` + `closeModal(modalId, clickedElement)`; opening pushes onto the stack via `ModalManager.register`/`ModalManager.open(id, hidePrevious)`; any modal with inputs MUST support Ctrl+Enter/Cmd+Enter for its primary action (plain Enter in textareas must not submit).

**Implementation reference:** `src/web/static/js/modal-manager.js` (header and `closeModal` / `setupClickAwayHandler` / `setupKeyboardShortcuts`).

**Tests:** `tests/ui/test_modal_interactions.py` — extend to cover stack restoration, click-away target, and Cmd/Ctrl+Enter where missing.
