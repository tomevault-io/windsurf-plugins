# Pytest — run_tests.py Integration

## Rule

All pytest tests built for **ongoing use** in this project **MUST** be integrated into the `./run_tests.py` wrapper. Tests must be discoverable and executable via one of the runner’s categories or markers—not only via raw `pytest` invocations.

## What “integrated” means

- **Discovery:** Tests live under `tests/` and are selected by an existing `run_tests.py` category (e.g. `smoke`, `unit`, `api`, `integration`, `ui`) or by a marker category (e.g. `regression`, `contract`, `security`, `a11y`) that `run_tests.py` already supports.
- **Execution:** A full run of the relevant category (e.g. `python3 run_tests.py unit` or `python3 run_tests.py regression --paths tests/quality/...`) includes the new tests.
- **No orphan tests:** Do not add pytest files that are only meant to be run manually with `pytest path/to/file.py` or custom one-off commands, unless they are explicitly one-off/throwaway (e.g. spike scripts). Ongoing tests belong in the wrapper.

## When adding new tests

1. Place tests under `tests/` in the appropriate subtree (e.g. `tests/api/`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/quality/`).
2. Use the markers/paths already used by `run_tests.py` so the new tests are included when that category is run (path-based discovery is the norm; only add `run_tests.py` changes if a new category or marker is required).
3. If introducing a **new category or marker**, update `run_tests.py` (e.g. `RunTestType`, `_build_pytest_command`, subparser) so the new tests are runnable via e.g. `python3 run_tests.py <category>`.

## Summary

- **Ongoing pytest tests → must be runnable via `run_tests.py`.**
- One-off / spike scripts may stay outside the wrapper if clearly marked as such.
