# Python Package Safety (safety-mcp)

## When Adding or Importing Packages

Whenever you:
- Add a package to `requirements.txt`, `requirements-*.txt`, or `pyproject.toml`
- Import a new Python package in code

You **MUST**:
1. Call **safety-mcp** `get_recommended_version` (or `check_package_security`) for the package.
2. Use the **recommended / latest secure version** returned by safety-mcp—not an arbitrary or outdated version.
3. If safety-mcp reports vulnerabilities for your chosen version, upgrade to the secure version before adding it.

## When User Asks to Check Existing Package

When a user asks you to check an existing package for vulnerabilities:
1. Call **safety-mcp** `check_package_security` with the package name and current version.
2. Evaluate whether there are **secure versions within the same major version** (e.g., 2.x → 2.y) and report these options.
3. Inform the user of the **latest secure version** of the package (from `get_recommended_version`).
4. For vulnerability details, use `list_vulnerabilities_affecting_version` only when the user asks for more detail.

## Tool Usage

- **get_recommended_version**: `packages: [{"name": "package-name", "ecosystem": "pypi"}]` — returns recommended secure version.
- **check_package_security**: `packages: [{"name": "package-name", "version": "1.2.3", "ecosystem": "pypi"}]` — checks if version has vulnerabilities.
- **list_vulnerabilities_affecting_version**: Use when user explicitly asks for vulnerability details.
