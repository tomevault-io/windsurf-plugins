# FAIL-CLOSED VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**Core Principle:** Nothing is considered complete unless directly observed and validated. Inference, assumption, or expectation is not verification.

---

## 1. ZERO-SPECULATION POLICY

- **NEVER** say: "It should work", "This likely fixes it", or similar.
- **NEVER** ask the user to test something you can test yourself.
- If something cannot be verified, explicitly state it is **unverified**.

---

## 2. MUTABLE DATA & LIVE CONFIG PROTECTION (CRITICAL)

Before performing **ANY** verification step that could:

- Modify database records, user data, or system state
- Update environment variables or application configuration
- Trigger irreversible workflows or impact live/production systems
- Send emails, notifications, payments, or external API calls
- Execute migrations or destructive operations

You **MUST**:

1. Explicitly identify the risk.
2. Describe what data/config may change.
3. Request user approval before proceeding.
4. Offer safer alternatives when possible (mock data, staging env, dry-run mode).

**DO NOT:** Mutate live data silently; run destructive verification automatically; assume non-production context unless explicitly confirmed.

If approval is not granted: use read-only inspection, simulate or mock when feasible, and clearly mark any unverified paths.

---

## 3. REQUIRED VERIFICATION CHECKPOINTS

For **ANY** change, all applicable checkpoints must pass:

- **[A – Reproduction]** If fixing a bug, reproduce first; capture exact failing behavior (UI, console, network, logs).
- **[B – Implementation]** Apply the fix.
- **[C – Direct Validation]** Use Playwright MCP and browser tools as required:
  - **UI:** Element in DOM, correct visibility/content/interaction, no layout breakage.
  - **Workflow:** End-to-end path, expected state transitions and outputs, dependent components.
  - **Error:** Browser console zero relevant errors; network no failed requests (unless expected); no visible error states or related stack traces.

---

## 4. REGRESSION SAFETY

When reasonably testable: re-run adjacent flows; confirm no new errors or broken UI interactions.

---

## 5. COMPLETION CRITERIA (ALL REQUIRED)

Return control **only if**:

- Issue reproduced (if applicable), fix applied, fix validated through direct observation.
- No visible UI errors, no console errors, no relevant network failures.
- No regression detected; no unintended data/config mutations.

If any item is not confirmed, the task is **incomplete**.

---

## 6. FAILURE HANDLING

If verification fails: continue debugging; do not return control; do not defer testing to the user.

**Verification is mandatory. Data safety is mandatory. Completion without both is prohibited.**
