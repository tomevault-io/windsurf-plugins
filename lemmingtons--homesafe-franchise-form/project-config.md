# AGENTS.md

This repository uses Codex GitHub PR review guidance from this file.

## Review guidelines

Codex PR review should stay high-signal and focus on P0/P1 issues:
- Flag correctness, security, privacy, data loss, authorization, migration, concurrency, billing, deployment, and user-visible workflow regressions.
- Check changed behavior against the closest `AGENTS.md`, existing project patterns, and the affected runtime workflow.
- Treat missing or misleading verification as a review issue when a change touches user-visible behavior, data writes, auth, jobs, billing, or deployment.
- Do not leave low-priority style comments unless they hide a real bug or future maintenance risk.
