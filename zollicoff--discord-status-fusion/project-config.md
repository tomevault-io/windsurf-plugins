# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Discord Status Fusion is an AI-powered Discord Rich Presence application that intelligently displays current professional applications and music. It uses Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite Preview for ultra-fast status generation with smart change detection to minimize API calls.

## Development Commands

### Running the Application
```bash
npm start               # Run directly
npm start -- --verbose  # Run with detailed debug output
dsf start               # Start daemon (runs in background)
dsf stop                # Stop daemon
dsf status              # Check if daemon is running
dsf help                # Show CLI help
```

### Development & Maintenance
```bash
npm run dev        # Run with nodemon (auto-restart on changes)
npm run lint       # Run ESLint to check code quality
npm run lint:fix   # Run ESLint with automatic fixes
npm install -g .   # Install dsf CLI globally
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test           # Run all tests using node:test
npm run test:watch # Run tests in watch mode
```

Tests are located in `src/core/__tests__/` using Node.js built-in test runner.

## Architecture & Key Design Patterns

### Main Application Loop (main.js)
The `DiscordStatusFusion` class orchestrates the entire application:
- **Smart Change Detection**: Only calls LLM when apps/music actually change
- **Forced Refresh**: Updates status periodically regardless of changes (configurable)
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforces 2-second minimum between LLM API calls
- **Visual Feedback**: Spinner UI shows app is running (only in TTY mode, disabled when logging to file)
- **Connection Recovery**: Auto-reconnects to Discord with exponential backoff (max 10 retries)
- **Configuration Validation**: Validates DISCORD_CLIENT_ID format before starting

### Core Components Interaction Flow
1. **Process Detection** (`src/core/detector.js`): Scans system processes using `execFile`, filters to professional apps
2. **Music Detection** (`src/core/music.js`): Checks Apple Music/Spotify via AppleScript (macOS only, shows warning on other platforms)
3. **LLM Processing** (`src/core/llm.js`): Generates formatted status via Gemini API when changes detected
4. **Discord Update**: Sets Rich Presence with generated status

### Key Implementation Details

#### API Key Security
Google AI API key stored in system keychain (never in code/env files):
- **macOS**: `security add-generic-password -s "GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY" -a "$(whoami)" -w "your-key"`
- **Windows**: `cmdkey /add:GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY /user:discord-status-fusion /pass:your-key`
- **Linux**: `secret-tool store --label="Google AI API Key" service "GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY" username "discord-status-fusion"`

The LLM client provides detailed error messages if keychain access fails, with platform-specific instructions.

#### Professional Apps Whitelist
The `isProfessionalApp()` method in `src/core/detector.js:103-154` uses regex patterns to identify professional applications. To add support for new apps, add patterns to the `professionalApps` array.

#### LLM Prompt Engineering
The prompt in `src/core/llm.js:143-156` is carefully crafted to:
- Include ALL detected apps (no cherry-picking)
- Apply specific renames (e.g., "stable" -> "Warp", "code" -> "VS Code")
- Format consistently with "+" separators
- Generate appropriate secondary status line based on music presence

#### Daemon Process Management
The CLI (`bin/dsf`) uses:
- **PID file** (`dsf.pid`): Tracks running daemon process (not tracked in git)
- **nohup**: Ensures process survives terminal closure
- **Process detachment**: Unlinks child from parent process

## Environment Configuration

Create `.env` file from `.env.example`:
```bash
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_app_id  # Required: 17-19 digit number from Discord Developer Portal

# Optional: Update intervals (in milliseconds)
UPDATE_INTERVAL=10000         # How often to check for changes (default: 10s)
FORCE_UPDATE_INTERVAL=300000  # Force refresh interval (default: 5min)

LOG_LEVEL=info  # Optional: error, warn, info, debug, verbose
```

## Dependencies & Version Requirements

**Runtime Dependencies:**
- `discord-rpc@4.0.1`: Discord Rich Presence client
- `dotenv@16.6.1`: Environment variable management
- `node-fetch@3.3.2`: HTTP client for API calls

**Development Dependencies:**
- `eslint@8.0.0`: Code quality enforcement
- `nodemon@3.0.0`: Development auto-restart

**Node.js:** Requires v16.0.0 or higher (uses built-in `node:test` for testing)

## Platform-Specific Behavior

### macOS (Full Support)
- Process detection via `ps -eo comm` using `execFile`
- Music detection via AppleScript for Apple Music & Spotify
- Keychain access via `security` command with detailed error handling

### Windows (Partial Support)
- Process detection via `wmic process get Name`
- Music detection not implemented (shows informational warning once)
- Credential storage via `cmdkey`

### Linux (Partial Support)
- Process detection via `ps -eo comm` using `execFile`
- Music detection not implemented (shows informational warning once)
- Secret storage via `secret-tool`

## Common Modifications

### Adding New Professional Apps
Edit `src/core/detector.js:115-151` and add regex patterns to the `professionalApps` array.

### Adjusting Update Intervals
Set environment variables in `.env`:
- `UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often to check for changes (default: 10000ms)
- `FORCE_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: Maximum time between LLM calls (default: 300000ms)

### Customizing Status Format
Modify the prompt in `src/core/llm.js:143-156` or the parsing logic in `src/core/llm.js:213-241`.

## Testing

The project uses Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test`). Tests are located in `src/core/__tests__/`:

- `detector.spec.js`: Tests for process detection and filtering
- `llm.spec.js`: Tests for LLM client, prompt building, and response parsing
- `music.spec.js`: Tests for music detection

Run tests with `npm test`. All 51 tests should pass.
