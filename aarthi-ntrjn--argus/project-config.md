# Copilot Instructions for Argus

## Project Purpose

Argus is a tool for centrally monitoring and remotely controlling Claude Code and GitHub Copilot sessions. The repository currently contains application code and the Speckit SDD (Specification-Driven Development) infrastructure for building it.

All feature work follows a strict spec → plan → tasks → implement pipeline, orchestrated by AI agents.

---

## Speckit Workflow

The 9-step workflow commands (available as Claude slash commands in `.claude/commands/` and as GitHub Copilot agents in `.github/agents/`):

| Command                  | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `/speckit.specify`       | Create/update `spec.md` from a feature description    |
| `/speckit.clarify`       | Identify ambiguities and encode answers into the spec |
| `/speckit.plan`          | Generate `plan.md` with technical design and phases   |
| `/speckit.tasks`         | Generate dependency-ordered `tasks.md`                |
| `/speckit.analyze`       | Cross-artifact consistency and quality check          |
| `/speckit.implement`     | Execute tasks from `tasks.md`                         |
| `/speckit.checklist`     | Generate a domain-specific checklist                  |
| `/speckit.constitution`  | Create/update immutable project principles            |
| `/speckit.taskstoissues` | Convert tasks to GitHub Issues                        |

**Ordering matters**: `specify` → `clarify` → `plan` → `tasks` → `analyze` → `implement`. Earlier phase artifacts are immutable during later phases.

## Repository Structure

```
.specify/
  init-options.json        # Framework config (ai, version, script, branch_numbering)
  memory/constitution.md   # Immutable project principles
  templates/               # Markdown templates for all artifacts
  scripts/powershell/      # Automation scripts (common.ps1, create-new-feature.ps1, etc.)
.claude/commands/          # Claude custom slash commands (9 Speckit commands)
.github/
  agents/                  # GitHub Copilot agent definitions (*.agent.md)
  prompts/                 # System prompts for each agent (*.prompt.md)
.vscode/settings.json      # Auto-approves .specify/scripts/ execution
```

Feature specs are written to `specs/[###-feature-name]/` on a dedicated branch.

---

## Feature Artifact Layout

Each feature lives in `specs/[###-feature-name]/`:

```
spec.md          # User stories (P1/P2/P3), FR-### requirements, SC-### success criteria
plan.md          # Tech context, architecture decisions, implementation phases
research.md      # Phase 0 decisions and clarifications
data-model.md    # Entity definitions
contracts/       # API/interface contracts
tasks.md         # Dependency-ordered tasks with phase grouping
checklists/      # Domain-specific checklists (requirements.md, etc.)
```

---

## Key Conventions

**Branch naming**: `[###-feature-name]` with sequential numbering (e.g., `001-session-monitor`). Controlled by `create-new-feature.ps1`.

**Requirement IDs**: `FR-###` for functional requirements, `SC-###` for success criteria.

**User story priorities**: `P1` = MVP critical, `P2` = important, `P3` = nice-to-have.

**Task format**: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description` where `[P]` marks parallel-executable tasks.

**Ambiguity markers**: `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question]` (max 3 per document) — resolve these with `/speckit.clarify` before proceeding to plan.

**Constitution**: Principles in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` use normative language (MUST/SHOULD) and are **never modified during feature work**. Constitution violations are `CRITICAL` findings in `/speckit.analyze`.

**Scripts**: All automation is PowerShell (`.ps1`). Scripts use `common.ps1` helpers — `Find-SpecifyRoot` and `Get-RepoRoot` — to locate the repo root. VS Code auto-approves execution of scripts under `.specify/scripts/`.

**Extensions**: Optional lifecycle hooks defined in `.specify/extensions.yml` — `before_specify`, `after_specify`, `before_plan`, `after_plan`, `before_tasks`, `after_tasks`, `before_implement`, `after_implement`.

## Coding Style

All generated code must conform to the ESLint and Prettier configuration in this repo. Key rules:

- **Always use curly braces** for all control-flow bodies (`if`, `else`, `for`, `while`), even single-statement ones. Opening `{` on the same line, closing `}` on its own line (1tbs style).
- **No unused variables or imports.** Prefix intentionally unused parameters with `_`. Destructured variables that are intentionally skipped must also start with `_`.
- **No `any` type** in production code (`backend/src/`, `frontend/src/` outside `__tests__`). Use typed assertions or interfaces.
- **Formatting is owned by Prettier.** Do not manually tune indentation, quotes, or trailing commas — Prettier will reformat on save and on `/merge`.
- After generating code, run `npm run lint:fix --workspace=backend` or `npm run lint:fix --workspace=frontend` to auto-fix violations before committing.
