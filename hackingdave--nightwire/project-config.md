# Verification after changes and before production deploy

## After coding changes
When you change application code in this repository, treat the task as incomplete until verification passes:

1. Run `bash scripts/cursor-agent-verify.sh` from the repo root (activates `.venv` or `venv` if present, then `python3 -m pytest`).
2. Fix failures and re-run until clean.
3. Briefly review touched areas for logic and security issues relevant to the change.

The Cursor `stop` hook runs `scripts/cursor-agent-verify.sh` when this generation included agent file edits; if it fails, fix the issues in a follow-up.

## Production deploy in the same task
If **your instructions include deploying to production**:

- Run `bash scripts/cursor-agent-verify.sh` **immediately before** the first production deploy command in that same task.
- Do **not** wire this into deploy scripts so that human-only standalone deploys stay unchanged.

## Standalone deploy
Human-only production deploys outside an agent session do not require this rule.
