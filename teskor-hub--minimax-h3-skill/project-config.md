# MiniMax H3 skill — working notes

## What this is

A **Claude Code skill** (plus two **portable chat prompts**) that teaches prompt-writing
and ComfyUI setup for **MiniMax H3** — an open-weight, omni-modal video model that
generates video *and* native stereo audio in one forward pass, at 24 fps, over a trained
clip length of ~124–362 frames. It ships as two separate checkpoints, `fl2va`
(frame-conditioned) and `ref2va` (reference-conditioned). The skill is built on MiniMax's
own prompt-writing guides, plus the failure modes those guides don't cover.

This repo is documentation. There is nothing to build, run, or test — the "product" is the
prose in `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `portable-prompt.md` and `reels-portable-prompt.md`,
and the one script in `tools/`.

## After every edit: hand over the push commands

The git repo with `origin` (`teskor-hub/minimax-h3-skill`) lives **on the PC**, at
`D:\claude\minimax-h3-skill`. The VPS copy has no remote — nothing can be pushed from
there. So the last thing every editing session does is:

1. Copy the changed files to the PC over the tunnel
   (`scp -O -T -i ~/.ssh/vps_to_pc -P 2222 <file> win10@127.0.0.1:'D:\claude\minimax-h3-skill\<file>'`).
2. **End the reply with a ready-to-paste command block** the user runs on the PC — `cd`,
   `git add` naming exactly the files that changed, `git commit -m`, `git push`. One block,
   nothing to edit by hand, no commentary inside it.

   **The shell is Windows PowerShell 5.1, not git-bash.** No `&&`, no trailing `\` line
   continuations — they are parse errors there. Write one command per line, backslash paths,
   and let PowerShell run the lines in order. Always include the `cd`, or `git` runs in
   `C:\Users\win10` and fails with `not a git repository`.

Don't commit or push on the user's behalf; hand over the commands.

## Where things live

- **Source of truth:** this repo, `/workspaces/usual/minimax-h3-skill` — git, remote
  `teskor-hub/minimax-h3-skill`, branch `main`.
- **Installed copy:** `/root/.claude/skills/minimax-h3` — what Claude Code actually loads.
  Currently byte-identical to this repo. **After editing `SKILL.md`, `references/`, or
  `tools/`, re-sync the installed copy** (git pull / re-clone / copy) or the running skill
  is stale.
- This session's cwd `/workspaces/h3 minimax` is an empty scratch dir, not the project.

## Three deliverables, kept in sync

The same knowledge ships in three shapes:

1. `SKILL.md` + `references/*.md` + `tools/` — the Claude Code skill (references are
   lazy-loaded only when needed).
2. `portable-prompt.md` — one self-contained block pasted into any chat model (ChatGPT,
   Grok, Gemini). Same knowledge **minus the ComfyUI half**, because a chat model can't
   lazily load `references/`.
3. `reels-portable-prompt.md` — the same H3 knowledge wrapped in a **reel pipeline**:
   shot breakdown → per-clip length → reference shopping list → one prompt per clip →
   edit sheet. Also chat-model-only, also without ComfyUI. It restates most of
   `portable-prompt.md`, because a pasted prompt has to stand alone.

**Rule: any factual change to one must be propagated to the others, and to `SOURCES.md`.**
The git log is full of "propagate corrections to every copy" and "close the last copy
divergences" passes — drift between the skill and the portable prompts is the recurring bug
here. When you change a claim, grep all three surfaces for it.

**Rule: editing `tools/reel_shots.py` means editing `reels-portable-prompt.md` too.** The
reel prompt tells the chat model what the tool outputs and how to read it — its CLI, its
flags, `manifest.json`'s field names, `h3_length_options`, the `frames/` naming. Change the
tool's interface or output shape and that prompt starts describing a script that no longer
exists. `references/reel-to-prompt.md` documents the same tool and needs the same pass.

## Provenance discipline — the core working rule

`SOURCES.md` tags every claim as **Official** (MiniMax docs) / **Implementation** (read from
ComfyUI source) / **Empirical** (observed tendency) / **Community** (third-party, unverified).

- Never state Empirical or Community claims as documented fact. Say which kind you're
  leaning on when it affects a decision.
- When you add or alter a claim in any model-facing file, **add or update its `SOURCES.md`
  row**. If a statement isn't traceable to a row, that's a gap worth flagging.
- Implementation facts were read against ComfyUI `master` on **2026-08-04**
  (`comfy/text_encoders/minimax.py`, `comfy_extras/nodes_minimax_h3.py`,
  `video_minimax_h3_r2v.json`). Re-verify against current source before trusting them —
  they change when ComfyUI does.
- Several widely-repeated figures are **community, not primary**: the 2K/1440 output cap,
  the 7000-char prompt field, the "12-file limit", "standalone audio is rejected". The last
  two are contradicted by the node schema. Don't present any of them as documented.

## Domain invariants — don't let an edit break these

Load-bearing facts the whole skill rests on; see `SKILL.md` for the full treatment.

- **`fl2va` and `ref2va` are separate weights, not modes of one model.** Mode → checkpoint
  table is `SKILL.md` §1. `fl2va` powers T2VA/I2VA/FL2VA/L2VA; `ref2va` powers Ref2VA.
