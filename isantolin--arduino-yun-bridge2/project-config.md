# GEMINI.md: Your AI Assistant's Guide to Arduino MCU Bridge 2

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Arduino MCU Bridge 2 project, designed to be used as a context file for AI assistants like Gemini.

## Project Overview

Arduino MCU Bridge 2 is a modern, high-performance replacement for the original Arduino MCU Bridge system. It facilitates robust and efficient communication between the Arduino-compatible microcontroller (MCU) and the Linux-based microprocessor (MPU) on the Arduino MCU and compatible boards.

The core of the project is a Python daemon that runs on the Linux MPU and a C++ library that runs on the Arduino MCU. They communicate over the serial port using a custom, efficient, and reliable binary RPC protocol. The protocol is formally defined in a TOML file, and the corresponding C++ and Python code is generated from this specification, ensuring consistency between the two sides of the bridge.

The project also includes a LuCI web interface for configuration and monitoring, as well as example code for both Python and Arduino.

### Key Technologies

*   **Python:** The main daemon on the Linux MPU is written in Python (3.13.9-r2), using `asyncio` for high-performance, non-blocking I/O.
*   **C++:** The library for the Arduino MCU is written in C++11, strictly adhering to **SIL-2** safety standards (no STL, no dynamic memory) and **MIL-SPEC** (FIPS 140-3) for cryptographic integrity.
*   **Cryptography:** Implements **HKDF-SHA256** (RFC 5869) for key derivation and mandatory **Power-On Self-Tests (POST/KAT)** at startup.
*   **Lua:** The LuCI web interface is written in Lua.
*   **OpenWrt:** The target operating system is **OpenWrt 25.12.2** (APK based).
*   **MQTT:** The bridge uses MQTT v5 for communication with other devices.
*   **TOML:** The communication protocol is defined in a TOML file.

## Building and Running

The project provides a set of shell scripts to automate the build, deployment, and installation process.

### Building

To build the project for OpenWrt 25.12.2, run the `1_compile.sh` script. This script will:

1.  Download and configure the OpenWrt SDK (25.12.2).
2.  Copy the project's packages into the SDK.
3.  Compile the packages to create `.apk` files (modern package format).
4.  Place the resulting `.apk` files in the `bin/` directory.

```bash
./1_compile.sh
```

### Expanding the Filesystem (Optional)

If your device has limited storage, you can use the `2_expand.sh` script to expand the filesystem onto a microSD card or USB drive.

```bash
./2_expand.sh
```

### Installing

To install the bridge on your Arduino MCU, transfer the project files to the device and run the `3_install.sh` script as root. This script will:

1.  Install the necessary system dependencies.
2.  Install the project's `.apk` packages.
3.  Configure the system.
4.  Start the `mcubridge` daemon.

```bash
./3_install.sh
```

### Testing

The project uses `tox` to run a comprehensive suite of tests. To run the tests, simply run the `tox` command in the root of the project. This will run unit tests, linting, type checking, and more.

```bash
tox
```

## Development Conventions

The project follows modern, best-practice development conventions:

*   **Code Formatting:** Python code is formatted with `black`.
*   **Import Sorting:** Python imports are sorted with `isort`.
*   **Linting:** The code is linted with `ruff` and `flake8`.
*   **Static Type Checking:** Python code is type-checked with `pyright`.
*   **Protocol as Code:** The communication protocol is defined in `tools/protocol/spec.toml` (enums, constants) and `tools/protocol/mcubridge.proto` (payload schemas). The corresponding code is generated using `tools/protocol/generate.py` to produce both Python (`structures.py`) and C++ (`rpc_structs.h`) bindings. This ensures that the protocol is always in sync between the C++ and Python codebases.
*   **Architecture:** Payload serialization uses **MsgPack** (array format) on both sides: `msgspec` (Python) and a minimal header-only codec `msgpack_codec.h` (C++, static allocation, no heap). Frame-level constructs (CRC, header) are handled by `construct` (Python) and internal C++ helpers. The `rpc_structs.h` file provides native `rpc::payload::*` structs with `encode()`/`decode()` methods and `Payload::parse<T>()` / `sendPbFrame<T>()` wrappers for type-safe MsgPack encode/decode.
    *   **Frame Layer (Sustitución Drástica):** Uses the `construct` library for declarative frame definition. This eliminates manual offset logic and centralizes integrity validation (CRC32) in a single, auditable schema.
    *   **RLE Protocol (Refactor):** Compression uses deterministic grouping logic (`itertools.groupby`) and declarative decoding via `construct`. It is encapsulated under a `msgspec` payload handler for seamless integration with the rest of the Python system.
    *   **Packet Layer:** Uses **MsgPack** (`msgspec` Packet classes) to decode payloads into typed messages.
    *   **C++ Dispatch:** Uses O(1) jump tables of member function pointers for command dispatch, eliminating `switch/case` overhead and reducing stack depth.
    *   **C++ Validation:** Implements `rpc::Payload::parse<T>` using `msgpack::Decoder` with struct-level `decode()` methods generated from `mcubridge.proto`.
*   **Hardware Abstraction:** Automatic detection of MCU capabilities including GPIO limits, Big Buffer, EEPROM, DAC, FPU, I2C, and SPI.
*   **Observability:** Built-in Prometheus exporter exposes extensive runtime metrics, including task supervisor health, queue depths, serial latency histograms, CPU temperature, and I/O throughput. Logs use structured hex format `[DE AD BE EF]` with directional labels `[MCU -> SERIAL]` and `[SERIAL -> MCU]`.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   **Jitter:** Handshake retries use exponential backoff with jitter to prevent network resonance.
    *   **Race Condition Guard:** State machine includes guards to prevent invalid transitions during high-speed asynchronous responses.
    *   **Cleanup:** Child processes are robustly terminated using `psutil` traversal on shutdown.
    *   **E2E Testing:** Automated integration testing (`tox -e e2e`) verifies the full stack against a native C++ emulator.
*   **Status:** The ecosystem is fully modernized and synchronized. All services use **MsgPack** typed messages for payload serialization. The C++ library strictly adheres to SIL-2 standards with O(1) dispatch and ETL integration.
*   **Automated CI/CD:** The project uses GitHub Actions to automate the build and test process.
