# Repository language and previews

- Keep all repository content in English. This includes documentation, comments,
  notebook markdown and outputs, examples, UI labels, filenames, and generated
  artifacts. Do not introduce Chinese text.
- Keep pull request titles and descriptions in English.
- A reviewer preview must use the same English notebook source and content that
  readers receive. Execution outputs may be included; do not create a separate
  translated or customized reviewer version.
- Apply the same language rule to preview pages and exported review artifacts,
  even when they are generated outside the Git checkout.
- Conversation with the maintainer may use their preferred language; that does
  not change the language of the repository or its previews.
- Run `python3 scripts/check_repository_language.py` before submitting changes.
  The CI check rejects Chinese/Han text in tracked text files and filenames,
  including JSON-escaped notebook text. Review rendered media for English labels
  as well, since text embedded in images or videos is not covered by that check.
