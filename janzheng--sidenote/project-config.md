svelte/store
Store contract
A store is an object that allows reactive access to a value via a simple store contract. The svelte/store module contains minimal store implementations which fulfil this contract.

Any time you have a reference to a store, you can access its value inside a component by prefixing it with the $ character. This causes Svelte to declare the prefixed variable, subscribe to the store at component initialisation and unsubscribe when appropriate.

Assignments to $-prefixed variables require that the variable be a writable store, and will result in a call to the store’s .set method.

Note that the store must be declared at the top level of the component — not inside an if block or a function, for example.

Local variables (that do not represent store values) must not have a $ prefix.


<script>
	import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

	const count = writable(0);
	console.log($count); // logs 0

	count.set(1);
	console.log($count); // logs 1

	$count = 2;
	console.log($count); // logs 2
</script>
When to use stores
Prior to Svelte 5, stores were the go-to solution for creating cross-component reactive states or extracting logic. With runes, these use cases have greatly diminished.

when extracting logic, it’s better to take advantage of runes’ universal reactivity: You can use runes outside the top level of components and even place them into JavaScript or TypeScript files (using a .svelte.js or .svelte.ts file ending)
when creating shared state, you can create a $state object containing the values you need and then manipulate said state
state.svelte

export const userState = $state({
	name: 'name',
	/* ... */
});
App

<script lang="ts">
	import { userState } from './state.svelte.js';
</script>

<p>User name: {userState.name}</p>
<button onclick={() => {
	userState.name = 'new name';
}}>
	change name
</button>
Stores are still a good solution when you have complex asynchronous data streams or it’s important to have more manual control over updating values or listening to changes. If you’re familiar with RxJs and want to reuse that knowledge, the $ also comes in handy for you.

svelte/store
The svelte/store module contains a minimal store implementation which fulfil the store contract. It provides methods for creating stores that you can update from the outside, stores you can only update from the inside, and for combining and deriving stores.

writable
Function that creates a store which has values that can be set from ‘outside’ components. It gets created as an object with additional set and update methods.

set is a method that takes one argument which is the value to be set. The store value gets set to the value of the argument if the store value is not already equal to it.

update is a method that takes one argument which is a callback. The callback takes the existing store value as its argument and returns the new value to be set to the store.

store

import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

const count = writable(0);

count.subscribe((value) => {
	console.log(value);
}); // logs '0'

count.set(1); // logs '1'

count.update((n) => n + 1); // logs '2'
If a function is passed as the second argument, it will be called when the number of subscribers goes from zero to one (but not from one to two, etc). That function will be passed a set function which changes the value of the store, and an update function which works like the update method on the store, taking a callback to calculate the store’s new value from its old value. It must return a stop function that is called when the subscriber count goes from one to zero.

store

import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

const count = writable(0, () => {
	console.log('got a subscriber');
	return () => console.log('no more subscribers');
});

count.set(1); // does nothing

const unsubscribe = count.subscribe((value) => {
	console.log(value);
}); // logs 'got a subscriber', then '1'

unsubscribe(); // logs 'no more subscribers'
Note that the value of a writable is lost when it is destroyed, for example when the page is refreshed. However, you can write your own logic to sync the value to for example the localStorage.

readable
Creates a store whose value cannot be set from ‘outside’, the first argument is the store’s initial value, and the second argument to readable is the same as the second argument to writable.


import { readable } from 'svelte/store';

const time = readable(new Date(), (set) => {
	set(new Date());

	const interval = setInterval(() => {
		set(new Date());
	}, 1000);

	return () => clearInterval(interval);
});

const ticktock = readable('tick', (set, update) => {
	const interval = setInterval(() => {
		update((sound) => (sound === 'tick' ? 'tock' : 'tick'));
	}, 1000);

	return () => clearInterval(interval);
});
derived
Derives a store from one or more other stores. The callback runs initially when the first subscriber subscribes and then whenever the store dependencies change.
