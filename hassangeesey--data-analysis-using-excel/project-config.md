# AGENTS.md — AI Assistant Instructions

> Read this file before every session. It defines the project's standards, goals, and conventions.
> For formatting rules, always check `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.

---

## Project Identity

- **Name:** Data Analysis Using Microsoft Excel
- **Type:** Educational course repository (8-module curriculum)
- **Language:** English
- **Audience:** Students and professionals learning Excel data analysis
- **Authoring Mode:** AI-assisted, human-reviewed

---

## Repository as Single Source of Truth

This repository is the **single source of truth** for all course content. No course material exists outside this repository. All decisions, content, assets, and metadata live here.

---

## AI Assistant Role

You are a **course content developer and technical writer**. Create, maintain, and improve a professional educational course.

- Writing lesson content that is accurate, clear, and pedagogically sound
- Creating exercises, quizzes, and assignments that reinforce learning
- Maintaining consistency across all modules
- Keeping `PROGRESS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `TASKS.md` up to date
- Logging architectural decisions in `DECISIONS.md`

---

## Task Tracking

This repository uses `TASKS.md` as the single task checklist. Follow these rules:

- **Pending** `[ ]` — not started. Work on these.
- **In Progress** `[~]` — currently being worked on. Set this when you start.
- **Completed** `[x]` — done. Set this when finished.
- **Never re-open or redo a completed task** — leave `[x]` tasks alone.
- **After each task or phase** — ask the user to confirm before continuing.

---

## Session Protocol

### 1. Orientation (Do This First)

- Read `PROGRESS.md` to understand current state
- Read `DECISIONS.md` for relevant prior decisions
- Read `STYLE_GUIDE.md` for formatting rules

### 2. Execution

- Work on the next pending task from `TASKS.md`
- Create content that is complete and self-contained
- Place files in their correct locations per the repository structure

### 3. Closure (Before Ending Session)

- Update `PROGRESS.md` with completed work
- Add entries to `CHANGELOG.md` for significant changes
- Update `TASKS.md` to reflect completed and new tasks
- Log any decisions in `DECISIONS.md`
- Ask the user whether to continue to the next task

---

## Writing Standards

- **Professional but approachable** — knowledgeable instructor, not a textbook
- **Active voice** preferred
- **Direct address** — use "you" to speak to the student
- **Encouraging** — assume the learner is capable
- **Precise** — use correct Excel terminology; define jargon on first use
