# Working language

Use English for code, CLI help and agent skill instructions. Maintain public documentation in English and Ukrainian, with matching `.md` and `.uk.md` files and reciprocal language links. Update both versions together; keep commands, configuration keys and evidence claims consistent. Preserve the original build specification unchanged as historical input.

# Source repository

Use https://github.com/apexrest-dev/apexrest-codex as the canonical repository for this project's code and the Git origin.

# Engineering rules

Preserve APEXREST_CODEX_PLUGIN_BUILD_SPEC.md. Use the acceptance matrix in docs/acceptance.json.
Never claim mocks as Oracle/native-host evidence. Keep implementation, verification and blockers separate.
Run relevant checks and update docs/implementation-status.md and docs/next-actions.md.
Do not publish, tag, provision paid resources or mutate an existing database without active authorization.

# Authorized application import rule (user amendment, 2026-09-12)

An explicit request to create, update or import an identified development/test APEX application authorizes the necessary application import within that scope. Complete validation, plan, apply and runtime verification; do not stop at a plan or ask the same permission again. Record existing user authorization as a short-lived, exact-project/target/plan local deploy grant when required by the runtime. Do not invent authorization or widen it to business-table writes, authentication changes, other targets or production. Preserve backup, identity, drift, coordination and unknown-outcome safeguards; production still requires protected external approval.

For an application-only change, use checks appropriate to that change: Oracle compilation, real read-only source-query checks and in-app browser verification. Do not make unrelated empty SQL/E2E suites or installing utPLSQL prerequisites for importing a page. Preserve existing suite results; changing an established required-suite scope needs user authorization. An explicitly authorized isolated application-only profile may declare no automated suites and record its actual source/browser checks separately, never as passed automated SQL/E2E tests. This amendment supersedes conflicting workflow guidance, not the original specification as historical input.

# In-app browser verification rule (user amendment, 2026-09-12)

For user-visible application changes, verify the affected pages and behavior in the selected verification browser (`codex` by default, or `external` when selected in plugin settings) when its controls are available. The development dashboard stays inside Codex. Follow the browser verification rule in plugins/apexrest-apex/skills/apexrest-test/SKILL.md. Record actual observations separately from automated test results; if browser access or the deployed change is unavailable, report the missing verification and its reason.

# Clean APEX deployment rule (user amendment, 2026-09-12)

Deploy must work with a clean supported APEX installation. APEXREST control tables are not prerequisites: use local durable migration history and local coordination by default. Do not ask to create service tables merely to unblock a normal plan/apply. Database-backed coordination is an explicit optional environment mode. Explain local versus cross-machine coordination accurately. Preserve identity, backup, approval, drift and unknown-outcome protections. This user amendment supersedes the original specification's mandatory control-table assumption; preserve the original specification as historical input.
