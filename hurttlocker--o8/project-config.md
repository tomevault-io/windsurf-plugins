# GEMINI.md

Project memory for Gemini CLI when dispatched by the o8 orchestrator against this repo. Gemini CLI auto-loads this file from the workspace hierarchy (see `~/.gemini/settings.json` `contextFileName`). Keep it focused — context is expensive.

## What this repo is

**o8** — the governance layer for autonomous engineering teams. A Next.js 16 + Tauri v2 desktop app that dispatches coding agents (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, opencode) against isolated git worktrees, gates merges behind review, and persists organizational memory.

You are running as a **worker** in that pipeline. A Claude orchestrator designed the packet you're executing and will review your diff before it merges to `main`. Stay in your scoped packet; don't refactor outside the stated files.

## Non-negotiables

- **800-line file ceiling.** If your edits would push a file past 800 lines, extract into focused modules first, then edit. Layout orchestrators (`page.tsx`) and multiplexers (`ws-server.ts`) are explicitly waived.
- **Inline styles only.** No CSS classes in React components. Use `style={{ }}` props. This is an iOS Safari reliability requirement, permanent.
- **No CSS shorthand.** Write `paddingTop: 8, paddingLeft: 12` — never `padding: "8px 12px"`. React 19 warns on mixed shorthand/longhand.
- **Never use emojis** in UI, comments, or commit messages. Icons are Phosphor raw SVG.
- **Never hardcode port 3001/3002.** Use `getApiBase()` from `@/lib/panel/api-port` — the Tauri sidecar picks dynamic ports.
- **Never hardcode `/Users/<name>/...` paths.** Use `process.cwd()`, `os.homedir()`, `process.env.HOME`, or an explicit env var.
- **Never hardcode theme colors like `rgba(255,255,255,0.56)`.** Use `var(--t-bg-card)`, `var(--t-panel)`, `var(--t-input-bg)` — they adapt across light/midnight themes.
- **Tauri webview cannot render React icon libraries.** No `@phosphor-icons/react`, no `lucide-react`. Extract raw SVG path data.
- **Never use `ai` SDK.** Use `fetch` against `/api/v2/proxy/llm`.
- **Never throw in API routes.** Return structured error responses.
- **Never use native `<select>` or `<input>` inside packet cards.** Mission Control uses clickable row + custom popover.

## Commit discipline

- Message prefix: `feat:` `fix:` `refactor:` `perf:` `chore:` `design:` `docs:`
- Console log prefix: `[feature-name]` (e.g. `[memory-recall]`, `[compaction]`, `[gemini]`)
- Stage only the files your packet was supposed to touch. If a pre-commit hook auto-stages unrelated files (e.g. `.claude/settings.json`), reset the commit, `git reset HEAD <unrelated-file>`, re-stage only your intended diff, and commit again.
- Always end with a `<self-review>` block per the packet prompt. Confidence: `high` only when diff cleanly matches spec.

## Architecture touchpoints (skim before editing)

- **Runtime adapters** live in `src/lib/runtimes/` with shared primitives under `src/lib/runtimes/shared/` (cli-resolver, owned-session-store, turn-dispatcher, cost-parser-registry). Adding a new runtime is a 6-file patch — see `docs/internals/runtime-adapter-contract.md`.
- **Orchestrator types** — `src/lib/orchestrator/types.ts:3` has the canonical `OrchestratorRuntime` union. `src/lib/orchestrator/runtime-capabilities.ts` has the `ORCHESTRATOR_RUNTIMES` map keyed by runtime id. UI reads from the map instead of branching on strings.
- **Desktop UI** lives in `src/components/desktop/`. Mobile UI lives in `src/components/mobile/` and is **completely separate** — no shared components. Don't cross the streams.
- **API security** — `src/middleware.ts` gates dangerous prefixes (`/api/panel/`, `/api/orchestrator/`, `/api/runtime/`, etc.) on loopback origin + ws-token. Never add a new state-mutating route without going through the gate.
- **Database** — SQLite via better-sqlite3 + Drizzle at `~/.cortex-ide/`. Schema at `src/lib/db/schema.ts`. WAL mode, FK on. Schema auto-migrates on boot.

## Paths you will edit often

- `src/lib/orchestrator/` — orchestrator types, capability map, scheduling
- `src/lib/runtimes/` — runtime adapters and shared primitives
- `src/components/desktop/thoughts/` — orchestrator chat + mission control UI
- `src/components/desktop/workspace-terminal/` — CLI tabs + live tail
- `src/components/desktop/repo-registry/` — agent panel + repo rows
- `docs/` — architecture docs; `runtime-adapter-contract.md` is the canonical reference

## Paths you should NEVER edit

- `out/` — build artifacts
- `src-tauri/target/` — Rust build cache
- `node_modules/`
- `.cortex-worktrees/` — isolated worktrees belong to sibling dispatches
- `~/.o8/` — owned-session data outside the repo

## How to verify your diff before committing

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit             # must pass, always — the one blocking gate
npx eslint <changed files>   # advisory, CHANGED FILES ONLY — never repo-wide `npm run lint` (slow; blocks nothing)
git diff main...HEAD         # self-review gate before the <self-review> block
```
