# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

git-p4son is a Python CLI tool that bridges Perforce (P4) and Git. It maintains a local git repository within a Perforce workspace, keeping a `main` branch in sync with the Perforce depot while supporting feature branches for local development.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run the tool
git p4son [command] [options]
python -m git_p4son [command] [options]
```

The project has zero external dependencies (standard library only). Python 3.11+ is required.

Run tests with:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

Format code with `autopep8`:
```bash
autopep8 -i -r git_p4son/ tests/
```

**Important:** Before committing, always run `autopep8 -i -r git_p4son/ tests/` to format all changed code. The
project must stay PEP 8 compliant at all times.

## Architecture

The CLI (`cli.py`) dispatches to command modules, each exposing a `*_command(args)` entry point:

- **`sync.py`** — Syncs git repo with a Perforce changelist. Validates both git and p4 workspaces are clean, performs
  `p4 sync`, then creates a git commit. Accepts an explicit CL number or `last-synced`; omitting the argument syncs to
  the latest changelist. Uses threaded real-time output processing (`P4SyncOutputProcessor`) to parse p4 sync progress.

- **`new.py`** — Creates a new Perforce changelist, opens git-changed files for edit, and optionally creates a Swarm
  review (with `--review` flag) or shelves (with `--shelve` flag). Alias defaults to the current branch name; use
  `--no-alias` to skip alias creation.

- **`update.py`** — Updates an existing changelist description, opens git-changed files for edit, and optionally re-shelves (with `--shelve` flag).

- **`list_changes.py`** — Lists git commit subjects since a base branch in chronological order. Used for generating changelist descriptions.

**`lib.py`** contains all reusable Perforce/git library functions: changelist creation/update, file status checking, opening files for edit, shelving, and Swarm review keyword management.

**`changelist_store.py`** provides changelist alias utilities, storing named aliases for changelist numbers in
`.git-p4son/changelists/<name>`.

**`config.py`** manages per-repo configuration stored in `.git-p4son/config.toml`. Currently stores the depot root
(the Perforce path to sync, e.g. `//my-workspace` or `//my-workspace/Engine/Source`).

**`common.py`** provides shared utilities: workspace detection (walks up directory tree for `.git`), subprocess execution
with timing (`run()`), and real-time output streaming via threading (`run_with_output()`).

## Python Version

When bumping the minimum Python version, update all of these locations:
- `pyproject.toml` (`requires-python` and classifiers)
- `README.md` (install requirements)
- `CLAUDE.md` (this file, development commands section)
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (CI test matrix)

## Code Style

- Prefer short one-line docstrings. Avoid verbose Args/Returns sections when the function signature already makes the
  purpose and parameters obvious.

## Git Conventions

- Never mention "Claude" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" in commit messages.
- Version bump commits should use the format: `Release git-p4son vX.Y.Z`
- Never commit plan/analysis markdown files (e.g. `release-notes.md`, `default-message.md`) together with the
  implementation changes. These files are a communication tool between the user and Claude, not part of the codebase.
