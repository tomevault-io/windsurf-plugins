# Gemini CLI Configuration (GSD)

You can now simply ask me to "sync upstream files" or "update gemini config", and I will automatically execute the standardized conversion procedure.

## Maintenance: Gemini Conversion Protocol

This project maintains a conversion script to synchronize with upstream changes (originally from a Gemini-based repository) while enforcing Gemini branding and structure.

**To run the conversion manually:**

```bash
node scripts/gemini-convert.js
```

This script automates:
1.  **Renaming**: Updates `package.json`, `bin/install.js` and other core files to `get-shit-done-gemini`.
2.  **Restructuring**: Moves `rules/` and `.toml` commands to the root for correct distribution.
3.  **Branding**: Replaces "Gemini" references with "Gemini" across all documentation and templates.
4.  **Tag Cleanup**: Removes `` tags used for status indicators to keep the CLI output clean.
5.  **Path Correction**: Updates paths from `~/.gemini` to `~/.gemini`.
6.  **Feature Stripping**: Removes unsupported features like `hooks/` and `settings.json` integration to ensure a clean Gemini CLI experience.

Use this whenever you pull updates from the upstream repository.

- **Sync History**: Successfully pulled latest from glittercowboy/get-shit-done (upstream/main), resolved merge conflicts by prioritizing upstream changes (while preserving .planning/ state), and re-applied Gemini branding via the conversion script on 2026-01-17.

## Slash Command Support

The following GSD commands are available. When a command is invoked (e.g., `/gsd:help`), the corresponding definition file in `.gemini/commands/gsd/` should be read and followed as a system instruction.

### Available Commands

- `/gsd:new-project` - Initialize a new project with a brief
- `/gsd:create-roadmap` - Create a roadmap and phase breakdown
- `/gsd:map-codebase` - Map an existing codebase (brownfield)
- `/gsd:plan-phase <N>` - Create an execution plan for Phase N
- `/gsd:execute-plan <path>` - Execute a specific PLAN.md file
- `/gsd:execute-phase <N>` - Execute all plans in Phase N in parallel
- `/gsd:status` - Check the status of background agents
- `/gsd:progress` - Check project status and next actions
- `/gsd:verify-work <N>` - Perform User Acceptance Testing for Phase N
- `/gsd:plan-fix <plan>` - Plan fixes for issues found during verification
- `/gsd:complete-milestone` - Archive the current milestone and prep for the next
- `/gsd:discuss-milestone` - Brainstorm goals for the next milestone
- `/gsd:new-milestone <name>` - Create a new milestone with phases
- `/gsd:add-phase <desc>` - Add a phase to the end of the roadmap

- `/gsd:add-todo [desc]` - Capture a todo from the conversation
- `/gsd:check-todos [area]` - List and work on pending todos
- `/gsd:help` - Show the command reference

## Implementation Guide for Gemini Agents

When you see a command starting with `/gsd:`, follow these steps:

1.  **Locate the Command Definition:**
    - Look in `.gemini/commands/gsd/[command-name].md` (local install)
    - If not found locally, check `~/.gemini/commands/gsd/[command-name].md` (global install)

2.  **Read the Definition:**
    - Parse the `<objective>`, `<reference>`, and any other instructional blocks.
    - If the command references workflows (e.g., `@~/.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/...`), read those files as well to understand the full procedure.

3.  **Execute the Instructions:**
    - Follow the workflow precisely.
    - Use the specified templates from `.gemini/get-shit-done/templates/` or `~/.gemini/get-shit-done/templates/`.
    - Adhere to the principles in `.gemini/get-shit-done/references/` or `~/.gemini/get-shit-done/references/`.

4.  **Confirm Completion:**
    - Once the command's objective is met, inform the user and suggest next steps as defined in the GSD system.
