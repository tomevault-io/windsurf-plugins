# Candle Agent Rules

This file defines mandatory development order and verification gates for all contributors and coding agents working on candle.

## Scope

- Applies to all changes under `src/candle/` and `tests/`.
- Priority: mechanism alignment with PyTorch behavior over adding new operator count.

## Non-Negotiable Order

For any new operator or API path in candle, follow this order:

1. Register schema first in `src/candle/_dispatch/schemas.py`.
2. Add or update contract tests in `tests/contract/`.
3. Register backend kernels (CPU/MPS/NPU/Autograd/Functionalize).
4. Add or update functional/tensor API exports.

Do not register a kernel before schema registration.

## Hard Invariant

`OpRegistry.register_kernel` enforces schema-first registration.

If schema is missing, registration must fail with:
- `schema must be registered before kernel registration for op ...`

Treat this as a design guardrail, not a temporary check.

## Required Tests Before PR

**Determine validation scope based on what changed.** Do NOT blindly run pylint and the full test suite on every PR.

### Change scope → validation matrix

| Change scope | Pylint | CPU + contract tests | Local backend tests (MPS/NPU) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Only docs, markdown, scripts, CI yaml | Skip | Skip | Skip |
| Only `tests/` (no `src/candle/` changes) | Skip | Run affected test files | Run if touching backend tests |
| `src/candle/` code changes | **Required** | **Required** | **Required** if local hardware available |

### When pylint is required

```bash
pylint src/candle/ --rcfile=.github/pylint.conf
```

### When tests are required

Every PR touching `src/candle/` must pass locally before pushing:

```bash
# Always required
pytest tests/cpu/ tests/contract/ -v --tb=short

# Required on macOS with Apple Silicon
pytest tests/mps/ -v --tb=short

# Required on Ascend NPU hosts
pytest tests/npu/ -v --tb=short
```

**CI is a safety net, NOT a substitute for local testing.** Do NOT push untested code and rely on CI to catch failures. Run all locally available tests before opening a PR.

## PR Scope Rule

- Keep PRs mechanism-focused and small.
- Do not mix unrelated features in one PR.
- If you add a new operator family, include only required schema/tests/registration/API for that family.

## PyTorch Alignment Rule

- Match PyTorch dispatch semantics first (schema binding, error class, dispatch path), then optimize implementation.
- Error message wording can differ slightly unless a contract test requires exact match.

## Worktree & Branch Rules (Mandatory)

These rules apply to Claude Code, Codex, and all coding agents. No exceptions.

### 1. Always use a worktree

Before making ANY code change, create an isolated worktree and sync upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream main
git worktree add .worktrees/<branch-name> -b <branch-name> upstream/main
cd .worktrees/<branch-name>
```

Never edit files on `main` directly. If you find yourself on `main` with uncommitted changes, stop immediately, create a worktree, and move the changes there.

### 2. Never modify main

The `main` branch is read-only during development. All commits go on feature branches inside `.worktrees/`. If a command would alter `main`, abort it.

### 3. Rebase upstream before PR

Before pushing and opening a PR, rebase onto the latest upstream main:

```bash
git fetch upstream main
git rebase upstream/main
```

Resolve any conflicts before proceeding.

### 4. Pre-PR validation gate

Follow the validation matrix in [Required Tests Before PR](#required-tests-before-pr). Only run pylint and tests when the change scope requires it.

Do NOT open a PR if pylint or tests fail. Fix all issues first.

### 5. Clean up after merge

After a PR is merged (manually or via command), delete ONLY the worktree and branch YOU created:

```bash
# From the repo root (not inside the worktree)
git worktree remove .worktrees/<your-branch-name>
git branch -d <your-branch-name>
git push origin --delete <your-branch-name>
```

NEVER touch worktrees or branches created by other agents or contributors.

## GPU/NPU Kernel Fallback Policy (Mandatory)

This rule applies to all MPS, CUDA, and NPU backend code. Violations will block PR merge.

### NEVER fall back to CPU

- **NEVER** move computation from GPU/NPU to CPU (numpy) to work around a kernel bug or missing op.
- CPU fallback hides real problems, breaks device-placement guarantees, and will not be accepted in review.

### Composite workarounds ARE allowed

- When a native kernel (Metal shader, ACLNN large kernel, CUDA kernel) has a bug, you MAY reimplement the op as a **composite of smaller on-device ops** that already work.
- Every op in the composite must execute on the **same device** — no CPU round-trips.

### Preserve native kernel entry points

- Do NOT delete broken native kernel code. Keep it guarded so it can be re-enabled when the underlying platform is updated (CANN SDK, CUDA toolkit, macOS/Metal).
- Mark with: `# TODO: re-enable native kernel when <platform> fixes <issue>`

### Document every known issue

- Record every known kernel issue in `docs/known-kernel-issues.md`.
