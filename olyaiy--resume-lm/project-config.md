Database Structure
- Tables follow a relational structure with UUID primary keys and timestamps.

Tables:
1. profiles
   - Stores user's base information and resume components
   - Contains JSON fields for complex data (work_experience, education, skills, etc.)
   - One-to-one relationship with auth.users

2. jobs
   - Stores job listings with requirements and details
   - Public read access, user-specific write access
   - Contains salary_range as JSONB for flexible structure
   - Tracks application status and requirements

3. resumes

   - Links to jobs table for tailored resumes
   - Contains same fields as profiles for resume content
   - Uses JSONB for section_order and section_configs

Key Relationships:
