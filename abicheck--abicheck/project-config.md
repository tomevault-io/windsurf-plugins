<!--
  This is a thin adapter, not the canonical source (CLAUDE.md "M1-1").
  Canonical, vendor-neutral repository instructions live in /AGENTS.md —
  read that file for the architecture map, ChangeKind conventions,
  test-quality gates, and the full "what NOT to do" list. Keep this file
  short: only the minimum a Copilot session needs before it opens AGENTS.md.

# Copilot instructions — abicheck

Read `/AGENTS.md` first — it is the canonical repository contract: setup,
architecture, conventions, and the `scripts/verify.py` verification
contract. This file only orients Copilot to that fact and to the one
command that matters before proposing a change is done —
`python scripts/verify.py --profile pr` (documented there, not repeated
here; that command is also exactly what `pixi run check` runs).

Do not duplicate commands, invariants, or counts from `AGENTS.md` into this
file — if something here and `AGENTS.md` disagree, `AGENTS.md` is correct and
this file is stale.
