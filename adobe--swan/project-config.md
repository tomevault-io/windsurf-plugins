## Project Overview

Swan is a Swift WebGPU binding library that provides Swift APIs for using WebGPU across multiple platforms. The initial implementation is a Swift binding to Google's Dawn library. This is currently a work-in-progress project not ready for production use.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **WebGPU**: Cross-platform facade that clients import. Conditionally re-exports `WebGPUDawn` (native) or `WebGPUWasm` (WASM)
- **WebGPUDawn**: Native backend wrapping Dawn (macOS, Windows)
- **WebGPUWasm**: WASM backend bridging to the browser's WebGPU API (WASI)
- **Dawn**: Swift wrapper around Google's Dawn WebGPU implementation
- **CDawn**: C bindings layer for Dawn
- **DawnData**: Data structures and utilities for Dawn integration
- **GameOfLife**: Demo/example application

### Code Generation

The project uses Swift Package Manager plugins for code generation:

- **GenerateDawnBindingsPlugin**: Generates Swift bindings from Dawn's C API
- **GenerateDawnAPINotesPlugin**: Generates API notes for better Swift integration

Both plugins depend on executable targets that process `dawn.json` to generate appropriate Swift code.

### Binary Dependencies

The project uses a binary target `DawnLib` that contains pre-built Dawn WebGPU libraries for multiple platforms (macOS, iOS, Linux, Windows). These are built via GitHub Actions and distributed as releases.

## Development Commands

### Building
You need to use the swift version that is defined in .swift-version. 
Please do so by ensuring that swiftly is first in the PATH variable:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.swiftly/bin:$PATH"
```
and let swiftly install and use the defined version:
```bash
swiftly install
swiftly use
```
It might be useful to clean up old artifacts when the version was changed. In that case run:
```bash
swift package clean
```
before finally running a build with:
```bash
swift build
```

#### WASM builds
The WASM SDK version is defined in `.wasm-sdk-version`. WASM builds need to set the swift-sdk and specify the WebGPU target in the build command:
```bash
BUILD_WASM=1 swift build --target WebGPU --swift-sdk $(cat .wasm-sdk-version)
```

### Testing
```bash
swift test
```

### Code Generation Plugins
```bash
# Generate Dawn API notes
swift package generate-dawn-apinotes

# Bindings are generated automatically during build via GenerateDawnBindingsPlugin
```

### Code Formatting
The project uses swift-format with configuration in `.swift-format`:
- Line length: 140 characters
- Uses tabs for indentation
- Ordered imports enabled

## Platform Requirements

- macOS 15+ 
- iOS 18+
- Swift 6.3+
- Uses development snapshot toolchain (6.3-snapshot-2026-01-29)

## Dependencies

- swift-testing (for tests)
- swift-log (for logging)
- swift-syntax (for code generation)
- swift-argument-parser (for CLI argument parsing)
- swift-format (for code formatting)

## Key Files

- `Package.swift`: Swift Package Manager configuration
- `Dawn/ci_build_dawn.py`: Python script for building dawn in CI
- `.wasm-sdk-version`: WASM SDK version for cross-compilation to WebAssembly
- `.swift-format`: Code formatting configuration
- `.vscode/settings.json`: VS Code configuration with specific Swift toolchain path

## Dawn Integration

The project maintains its own Dawn builds through GitHub Actions workflows that:
1. Fetch specific Chromium/Dawn versions
2. Build Dawn for multiple platforms
3. Package as binary releases
4. Update Package.swift with new binary target URLs

The Dawn source management and building is handled by Python scripts in the `Dawn/` directory.
