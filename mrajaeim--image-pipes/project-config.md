# Incremental Commits (No Big Bang)

Ship reviewable progress. Never dump a large unfinished or multi-layer change in one commit or one unreviewed blob.

## Execution loop

1. Pick the **smallest logical slice** that still leaves the tree green.
2. Change only that slice (prefer ≤5 files; exception: renames/refactors).
3. Run the relevant checks for what you touched.
4. `git add` only those files, then commit.
5. Move to the next slice.

## Slice order (feature work)

Prefer this layering—**one layer per commit**:

1. Types / schemas
2. Core logic
3. Tests
4. API / WebSocket
5. Store / hooks
6. UI

Do **not** mix backend engine work and frontend components in the same commit unless the change is a shared type/schema only.

## Quality gate before every commit

- Backend touched: `uv run ruff check` and `uv run pytest` (from `backend/`)
- Frontend touched: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` (from `frontend/`)
- Never commit a knowingly broken build, lint, or test state

## Commit messages

Use Conventional Commits:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`  
Scopes (examples): `backend/engine`, `backend/nodes`, `backend/api`, `frontend/canvas`, `frontend/store`, `shared/types`

```text
# ✅ GOOD
feat(backend/engine): cache multi-port node outputs
fix(frontend/canvas): refresh handle internals after run

# ❌ BAD
feat: finish playground
chore: lots of updates
```

## Anti-patterns

- One mega-commit for an entire feature or phase
- Staging unrelated files “while we’re here”
- Leaving WIP that does not compile or fails tests
- Amending or force-pushing unless the user explicitly asks
