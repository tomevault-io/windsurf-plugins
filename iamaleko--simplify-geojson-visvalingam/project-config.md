# Repository Guidelines

## Project structure and module organization
The main library code lives in `src/`: the public entrypoint is `src/index.ts`, and helper type guards are placed in `src/lib/`. Automated tests live in `test/`, input fixtures are in `test/geojson/in/`, and expected outputs are in `test/geojson/out/`. For manual inspection use `playground/`: `playground/index.ts` for local runs and `playground/generate.py` for generating data. The `dist/` directory contains build artifacts and must not be edited manually.

## Build, test, and development commands
- `npm test`: run the Mocha test suite.
- `npm run lint`: check the code with ESLint using `--max-warnings=0`.
- `npm run lint:fix`: apply safe lint autofixes.
- `npm run format`: format `ts`, `js`, and `json` files with Prettier.
- `npm run build`: run lint, tests, and the `tsup` build in sequence.
- `npm run watch`: rebuild the library on file changes.
- `npm run playground`: start the local playground with `tsx watch`.

## Code style and naming conventions
The project uses TypeScript in ESM mode. Follow the existing style in `src/` and `test/`: 2-space indentation, single quotes, and omit semicolons unless tooling inserts them. Keep the public API in `src/index.ts`, and move helper logic into small files inside `src/lib/`. Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, and `PascalCase` for GeoJSON types. Fixture names should describe the scenario explicitly, for example `smallPolygonNoCommonPositions.json`. When changing the simplification algorithm in `src/`, preserve the performance-first approach: do not add extra coordinate passes, extra allocations, or more expensive data structures unless there is a clear need and a measurable correctness gain.

## Agent-facing documentation
Agent-facing Markdown files such as `AGENTS.md` and files under `docs/memory/` must be written in English only.

Use a compact technical reference style:
- prefer precise statements over conversational explanation
- keep sections easy to scan
- avoid storytelling, marketing language, and unnecessary repetition
- describe current behavior, constraints, invariants, and rationale directly
- separate verified behavior from assumptions or future work

When documenting implementation details:
- anchor statements in the current code, tests, README, or changelog
- keep design rationale explicit when it affects performance or behavior
- avoid speculative bug reports or unsupported interpretations
- update agent-facing files together with tests or algorithm changes when the documented behavior changes
- treat synchronization as mandatory: if code, tests, invariants, API semantics, or performance rationale change, update the relevant agent-facing files in the same work so they do not drift out of date

When internal structure changes:
- keep `docs/memory/` synchronized with the current code layout and behavior
- document moved internal helpers, new unit-test coverage, and changed validation or performance rationale when relevant

## Testing rules
Tests use Mocha with Node.js `assert`. Place new coverage by concern: validation and options go in `test/simplify.validation.test.ts`, behavioral and invariant scenarios in `test/simplify.behavior.test.ts`, simplification without shared positions in `test/simplify.no-common-positions.test.ts`, and simplification with shared positions in `test/simplify.common-positions.test.ts`. If library behavior changes, keep the input and expected JSON fixtures in `test/geojson/in/` and `test/geojson/out/` in sync. For new non-trivial GeoJSON scenarios, do not inline large objects in tests: create named fixtures following the existing pattern, for example `polygonWithSmallInteriorRing.json` and `polygonWithSmallInteriorRingFraction0Tolerance1.json`. Prefer one asserted scenario per `it(...)`, with names in the `should ...` style. Always run `npm test` before opening a pull request; use `npm run build` for full verification.

When fixing bugs or changing behavior, use a TDD-style workflow:
- reproduce the issue first
- add or update a failing test before changing production code
- confirm the new test fails for the expected reason
- make the smallest production change that turns the test green
- run the targeted test first, then run the full relevant test suite

For debugging and root-cause confirmation:
- prefer isolated confirmation over guesswork
- when useful, add temporary local logging to the relevant code path to inspect internal state directly
- use logs to compare behavior before and after a minimal temporary fix
- when comparing old and fixed behavior, do it in the development environment against `src/` and the real test runtime; do not use `dist/` as an investigative environment
- temporary investigative edits must be removed once the evidence is collected

When a minimal fix makes a new test green but causes older tests to fail:
