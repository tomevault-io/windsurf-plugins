## About This Project

OpenEmu-Silicon is a community-maintained fork of OpenEmu, rebuilt to run natively on Apple Silicon (arm64) without Rosetta. It descends from:

- [OpenEmu/OpenEmu](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu) — the original project
- [bazley82/OpenEmuARM64](https://github.com/bazley82/OpenEmuARM64) — the foundational ARM64 port

The goal is to honor the original OpenEmu spirit — a beautifully designed, first-class native macOS game emulation frontend — while making it work reliably on M-series Macs with modern macOS and Swift.

**The maintainer is not a professional developer.** If you are writing explanations, commit messages, or comments, please use plain language. Avoid jargon where a plain word works just as well.

## Ground Rules

1. **Never commit directly to `main`.** All work goes through feature branches → PRs → `main`.
2. **Branch from `main`, open PRs against `main`.** There is no staging branch.
3. **Build before committing.** Run an `xcodebuild` check on any Swift/ObjC changes before staging a commit.
4. **Don't rewrite files wholesale.** This is a large, complex Xcode project. Make surgical changes. Rewriting `.pbxproj` or large ObjC files without understanding them will break the build.
5. **Respect the flattened architecture.** Submodule directories (`Nestopia/`, `BSNES/`, etc.) are regular directories — do not attempt to re-initialize them as git submodules.
6. **Do not commit build artifacts.** No `.o` files, derived data, `.app` bundles, build logs, or compiled executables.
7. **Note AI assistance in commit messages.** If a commit was written or significantly assisted by an AI tool (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.), say so in the commit message. Example: `fix: resolve VICE dlopen crash (assisted by Claude Code)`.

## Language and Tooling

- **Swift 6.2.4** — strict concurrency is enforced. Use `@MainActor`, `Sendable`, and structured concurrency correctly.
- **Objective-C** — many core files are ObjC. Bridge headers are in place. Don't break them.
- **Xcode 26.3** — use `xcodebuild` for CLI builds. The primary workspace is `OpenEmu-metal.xcworkspace`.
- **No package manager** — no SPM, no CocoaPods, no Carthage. Dependencies are vendored or flattened submodules.

---

## Build Command

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -workspace OpenEmu-metal.xcworkspace \
  -scheme OpenEmu \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
  build 2>&1 | tail -30
```

A clean build is the definition of "passing." Run this before every commit touching source files.

## Branch and PR Rules

These rules exist because AI-assisted sessions have previously created orphaned branches, duplicate issues, and commits without PRs. Follow them exactly.

**Branches:**

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Always branch from `main` | Prevents tangled history |
| One branch = one concern | Keeps PRs focused and reviewable |
| Never reuse a merged branch | New commits on a merged branch have no PR — invisible |
| Branch name must match content | If scope changes, start a new branch |
| Delete local branch after merge | `git branch -d` immediately after syncing main |

**PRs:**

- **Target branch:** `main` on `nickybmon/OpenEmu-Silicon`
- **Push and open a PR in the same step — never push without immediately opening a PR**
- **PR title format:** `fix: description` / `feat: description` / `chore: description`
- **Use the PR template** — `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` auto-populates. Fill every section.
- Each PR addresses one issue or one logical change — no bundled unrelated fixes
