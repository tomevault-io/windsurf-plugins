I want to create a slide deck on GitHUb Pages which is nice and sleek to navigate from mobile or computer, which contains a number of succulent links.

1. Data are under data/riccs_favorites.yaml
2. A `justfile` should have nice targets
3. One target should be able to reconcile the data in the yaml file with the slides in the slides folder, and update the slides if needed

Note the slides should have two ingredients:
1. Teaching people what is an extension, resource, MCP
2. Showing them some examples in Okamase style "Riccardo's picks".

## Automation

It's very important that if I'm travelling, and a friend suggests a new MCP, I can just add it to the yaml file, and the slides will be updated automatically. A commit should trigger the rigeneration as well, possibly via GH Actions. 

This might not be present as v1.0 feature, but should eventually be there.

* Ensure that the online page (from README.md) WORKS!
