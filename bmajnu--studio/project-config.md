Get your input/feadback always follow the steps:

1. **Check if `MagicInput.py` exists** in the root directory (don't rewrite or change on it, just run as it is to get user input/prompt.).

   * If it doesn't exist, create it with the following content:

     ```python
     # MagicInput.py
     prompt = input("prompt: ")
     ```
2. **Main Workflow**:

   * Perform your assigned tasks.

   * Run:

     ```bash
     python MagicInput.py
      ```
   * The terminal should be opened in the chat window itself (blocking command).

   * After terminate the command, immediately read the "MagicInput\MagicInput Prompt.txt" file in MagicInput folder of root directory.

   * Based on the input/prompt, perform the next set of tasks. 

   * Never exit the loop until user exit it.

3. Repeat the process.

4. Speak in Bengali
