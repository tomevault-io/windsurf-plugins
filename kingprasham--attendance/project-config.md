# Kalina Engineering — Attendance Management System

## Project Summary

Geofenced, biometric attendance system for Kalina Engineering Pvt. Ltd. Employees clock in/out using fingerprint + GPS verification. Includes leave management, payroll/salary slips, and push notifications.

**Full design spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-01-kalina-attendance-system-design.md`

## Architecture

Three independent subsystems, built in this order:

1. **PHP REST API + MySQL** (GoDaddy shared hosting) — ~30 endpoints, vanilla PHP, JWT auth
2. **Flutter Mobile App** (employee-facing) — biometrics, geofence, attendance, leaves, salary
3. **Admin Web Dashboard** (superadmin only) — Bootstrap 5, PHP, HTML/CSS/JS

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Mobile App | Flutter 3.27+, Dart, Riverpod, Dio, GoRouter |
| Backend API | Vanilla PHP (no framework), PDO, firebase/php-jwt |
| Database | MySQL on GoDaddy shared hosting |
| Admin Dashboard | HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JS, PHP sessions |
| Push Notifications | Firebase Cloud Messaging |
| Maps | Google Maps JS API (admin dashboard only, one-time branch setup) |
| Hosting | GoDaddy shared hosting (existing domain + web hosting) |

## Color Theme (from Kalina logo)

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Primary Dark Blue | `#0055A4` | App bars, primary buttons, sidebar |
| Primary Light Blue | `#4A9BD9` | Accents, links, secondary elements |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | Backgrounds |
| Background | `#F8F9FB` | Screen/page backgrounds |
| Text | `#1F2937` | Primary text |
| Success | `#059669` | Present, approved |
| Error | `#DC2626` | Absent, rejected |
| Warning | `#D97706` | Late, pending |

## Key Design Decisions

- **Geofence validation is SERVER-SIDE** — Haversine formula in PHP. Client GPS check is UX only, not trusted.
- **Device binding** — Each employee locked to one device via `persistent_device_id`. Admin can reset.
- **Anti-spoofing** — Client uses `safe_device` to detect mock GPS/rooted devices. Server validates distance.
- **UTC storage** — All datetimes stored in UTC. Convert to IST (UTC+5:30) at display layer only.
- **Single admin** — One superadmin role, no RBAC. Daily reports only.
- **Leave policies per branch** — Different branches can have different leave quotas.
- **Payroll calculation** — `net = (monthly_salary / working_days) × (present + paid_leave) - (per_day × lwp_days)`
- **No framework for PHP** — Vanilla PHP with clean MVC-like structure. Deploys via FTP, no Composer needed.
- **JWT auth** — Access token 30min, refresh token 30 days with rotation.

## Database (10 tables)

`admins`, `branches`, `employees`, `attendance_logs`, `leave_policies`, `leave_balances`, `leave_requests`, `salary_slips`, `holidays`, `notifications`

See full schema with all columns in the design spec, Section 4.

## API Endpoints (~30 total)

- **Auth:** login, admin_login, refresh, register_device
- **Branches (admin):** create, list, update, delete
- **Employees (admin):** create, list, view, update, delete, reset_device, profile
- **Attendance:** clock_in, clock_out, today, history, report (admin)
- **Leaves:** apply, cancel, balance, history, pending (admin), approve (admin), reject (admin)
- **Salary:** generate (admin), slips, slip_detail
- **Holidays:** create (admin), list, delete (admin)
- **Notifications:** list, mark_read
- **Leave Policies:** set (admin), view

## Flutter Packages

`flutter_riverpod`, `dio`, `go_router`, `local_auth`, `geolocator`, `persistent_device_id`, `flutter_secure_storage`, `firebase_messaging`, `hive_flutter`, `safe_device`, `intl`, `table_calendar`
