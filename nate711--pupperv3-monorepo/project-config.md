# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the Pupper V3 monorepo - a quadruped robot with ROS2 control, neural network locomotion policies, and an AI voice assistant interface.

Explore the repository files to understand context. There aren't that many files.

## Coding guidelines

Never write fallbacks. Instead warn the user about potential failure modes. This means avoid most try excepts.

Use uv to manage packages. Never modify the PATH manually in files.
