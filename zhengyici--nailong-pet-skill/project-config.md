description: Install the bundled Codex pet named 奶龙 from this repository. Use when the user asks for 奶龙.skills, 奶龙宠物, this yellow character pet, or wants Codex to install a prebuilt pet package into ~/.codex/pets without regenerating images.
---


# 奶龙.skills

## Purpose

Install the bundled 奶龙 Codex pet immediately. The repository already includes a validated Codex-compatible `spritesheet.webp` and a reference preview, so do not regenerate images unless the user explicitly asks for a new visual version.

## Quick Install

From this skill directory, run:

```bash
python scripts/install_nailong_pet.py
```

This creates:

```text
~/.codex/pets/nailong/
  pet.json
  spritesheet.webp
```

After installing, tell the user to restart Codex and select the pet from:

```text
Settings -> Appearance -> Pets -> Select -> 奶龙
```

## Custom Name

If the user wants a different installed name or id:

```bash
python scripts/install_nailong_pet.py --pet-id huang-tuan-tuan --display-name "黄团团"
```

Use lowercase ASCII ids with hyphens. Display names may be Chinese.

## Bundled Assets

- `assets/nailong-spritesheet.webp`: Codex pet atlas, 1536 x 1872, 8 columns x 9 rows, transparent background.
- `assets/nailong-reference.png`: First-frame preview of the pet.

The bundled state mapping is:

| Codex row | Pet behavior |
|---|---|
| `idle` | 待机 |
| `running-right` | 向右跑，拖动宠物右移时 |
| `running-left` | 向左跑，拖动宠物左移时 |
| `waving` | 开心挥手备用 |
| `jumping` | done / 开心跳一下 |
| `failed` | sleeping / 趴下睡觉 |
| `waiting` | 等待输入 |
| `running` | working / 敲代码中 |
| `review` | thinking / 歪头冒问号 |

## If The User Wants A New Version

Use the installed `hatch-pet` skill if available for a full image-generation workflow. Preserve this skill's bundled assets unless the user explicitly asks to update 奶龙.skills itself.
