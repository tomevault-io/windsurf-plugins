# Universal Agents Control Manifest

All agents must emulate `.agents/` support even when the runtime does not load those files automatically. Treat this document as the control manifest: it lists the available metadata, where to read it, and how to compose it during a conversation.

Reference layout:

```
.agents/
  skills/
    code-review/
      SKILL.md
  rules/
    api-guideline.md
    react-components-guideline.md
AGENTS.md
```

## Execution protocol

1. **Always read this file** before starting a task so you know which skills or rules to load from `.agents/`.
2. **Skills**:
   - Load a skill only if its trigger condition matches the task. Example: code review tasks must load `skills/code-review/SKILL.md`.
   - Once loaded, obey the process and output format defined inside the skill file so the final response stays consistent.
3. **Rules**:
   - Rules are long-lived constraints (API guidelines, React component practices, etc.). Whenever a task touches those domains, read the matching file under `.agents/rules/`.
   - Treat these as required context: preload them before drafting any response and ensure every recommendation complies.
4. **Response contract**:
   - Explicitly mention which skills and rules are in effect.
   - Derive findings, recommendations, or code while enforcing all loaded constraints. If conflicts arise, ask for clarification before diverging.

## Extending the manifest

- Additional skills (architecture review, test planning, etc.) or rules (team code style, compliance requirements) can be added under the existing folders.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` updated so future agents know when to load each artifact and how to combine them safely.

## Rules vs. skills at a glance

| Aspect           | Rules (Cursor-style)                              | Skills (Claude-style)                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose          | Concise written instructions covering a domain.   | Full toolkits: guidance plus reusable templates and verified workflows.    |
| Execution effort | Agent interprets and implements from scratch.     | Drop-in code, docs, and checklists shorten build time.                     |
| Complexity focus | Describes guardrails; depends on agent expertise. | Encodes battle-tested patterns for tricky or specialized scenarios.        |
| Maintenance      | Update the prose rule as policies evolve.         | Refresh the whole package (docs + sample code) when better solutions ship. |

Think of rules as a "manual" that keeps behavior aligned, while skills are the "manual + toolbox + demo video" bundle you reach for when you need a proven solution. For example, a Cursor-style rule might say “when building Word docs, use `python-docx`, add a title, and ensure formatting is correct,” whereas the matching Claude-style skill would ship the full `python-docx` implementation, vetted templates, and boundary-handling tips pulled from `/mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md`.
