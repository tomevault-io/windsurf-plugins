# AGENTS.md

## Current product direction

**The active goal is [docs/GOAL.md](docs/GOAL.md) (owner-approved 2026-09-28):
Beta 1 on real Figma files and real codebases.** Read it before choosing any
work. It freezes the six V1 criteria, new benchmark cells, update channels and
plan documents, and caps work at two lanes with one PR each. Every task cites a
smoke-gate failure, a cold-start blocker, a real-design-system miss or an
outside user's report. Write American English.

[docs/CURRENT.md](docs/CURRENT.md) remains the record of the V1 architecture,
benchmark and regression gates; it is no longer the work order. It is shared by
the playground and documentation site. Numbered plans and handoffs are historical context,
not competing current instructions. Preserve signed evidence and owner-only
grades; do not equate a rendering draft or a green internal gate with a complete
autonomous journey. Verify the actual checkout, source revision and PR state.

V1 targets React ↔ contracts ↔ Figma, including composed components and
two-way repair. Lit/Web Components integration is paused for planned V1.1;
preserve its implementation and evidence, but do not expand it as a V1
prerequisite. Prioritize shared conversion rules and complete user journeys
over component-specific converters. Existing regression gates remain required.

## Repository instructions

This is `ds-contracts-poc` ("Design System Contracts"), an npm-workspaces monorepo.
Use the Node version in `.nvmrc` (20.19.4, the version CI pins). `engines` in
`package.json` says `>=20`, but Vite 8.3.0 declares `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`. Install
with `npm ci`; `npm install` under npm 10.8.2 rewrites the tracked `package-lock.json`.
Standard commands live in `package.json` scripts and `CONTRIBUTING.md`; the notes below
are only the non-obvious things.

### Environment / setup gotchas
- **npm workspaces only cover `packages/*`.** `workers/assist/` has its own
  `package.json` and is not installed by the root `npm ci`. `npm run test:worker` and
  `npm run typecheck:worker` do not need that install: they resolve `tsx` and `tsc`
  from the root `node_modules`, and CI runs them with no separate install. Only the
  Worker's `wrangler` commands (`dev`, `deploy`) need
  `npm --prefix workers/assist install`.
- **`packages/schema/dist` is gitignored and must be built.** Anything importing
  `@ds-contracts/schema` (root `npm run typecheck`, the CLI package, `extract/*`)
  fails with `Cannot find module '@ds-contracts/schema'` until you run
  `npm run prep:schema` (compiles `packages/schema` → `dist`). The startup update
  script builds it; if you re-clone or wipe `packages/schema/dist`, re-run
  `npm run prep:schema`.
- **Playground startup needs schema and core builds.** Run `npm run prep:core`
  after `npm ci` on a fresh checkout; it builds both in order. Schema alone leaves
  Vite’s server config unable to resolve `@ds-contracts/core`. The client aliases
  in the Vite config do not cover dependencies while loading that config.
- **The gates need all four package builds on a cold tree**, in this order:
  `npm --prefix packages/schema run build`, `npm --prefix packages/core run build`,
  `npm --prefix packages/cli run build`,
  `npm --prefix packages/emitter-web-components run build`. Without them
  `npx tsc --noEmit` fails on `@ds-contracts/emitter-web-components`, the
  `paste-door-open` eval fails on the missing `packages/cli/dist/cli.js`, and
  `publish:check` refuses. `CONTRIBUTING.md` §"The gates" has the full cold-tree step.
- **`npm run build` is NOT required to run the apps.** The generated output it
  produces (`src/components/**`, `tokens/**` CSS, `catalog/`) is committed and
  regenerates byte-identically, so `git status` stays clean after a build. The
  dev apps read those committed files directly. Only run `npm run build` when you
  change a contract/token/generator.

### Running the apps (dev servers)
- Playground (flagship end-to-end demo): `npm run playground` → http://localhost:5181
- Dashboard ("Contract Hub"): `npm run dashboard` → http://localhost:5180
- Storybook (component gallery): `npm run storybook` → http://localhost:6006
- The dashboard's Vite config exposes dev-only POST endpoints (`/api/run`, etc.)
  that shell out to repo scripts, so it is interactive against the real engine.

### Testing / gates
- Fast local checks: `npm run lint` (oxlint), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:cli`,
  `npm run test:worker`, `npm run test:playground`. `CONTRIBUTING.md` §"The gates"
  is the source of truth for the full gate list and CI lanes (`npm run ci:lane fast|full`).
- **`npm run parity` is deliberately excluded from the gates and will exit 1 on a
  healthy tree** with `snapshot-stale` findings — the committed Figma snapshots
  expire by design and can only be refreshed from Figma desktop. A `snapshot-stale`
  finding is not a code regression, but stale live-file evidence can still make a
  reconciliation gate red. Refresh the snapshots from Figma desktop before
  claiming a fully green lane. Any *other* parity finding is a product defect.
  See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
