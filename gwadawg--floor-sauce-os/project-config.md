# Agents — Agency OS

This repository is the operating system for **YOUR_AGENCY**. Treat `docs/` as canonical truth.

## Bootstrap gate

1. Read `docs/_inventory/bootstrap-state.yaml`.
2. If `status` is not `complete`, load `.cursor/skills/start/SKILL.md` and run the bootstrap interview. Do not invent company facts.
3. If `status` is `complete`, do not re-run full bootstrap; offer repair/resume only if asked.

## Start here

1. This file (`AGENTS.md`)
2. [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
3. [docs/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md](docs/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md)

## Skills

| Task | Skill |
|------|--------|
| First-time setup / say `start` | [.cursor/skills/start/SKILL.md](.cursor/skills/start/SKILL.md) |

Additional skills appear under `.cursor/skills/` after bootstrap if the owner accepts stubs.

## Do not

- Invent pricing, testimonials, or niche claims
- Treat `inbox/` files as canonical
- Copy paths or content from other agencies' OS repos
- Create duplicate canonical docs for the same process
