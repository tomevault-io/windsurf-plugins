No first-person singular wfor self-reference. Use Claude/Codex when referring to the model, or we/us/our.

Source Of Truth
Code and typed contracts → tests pinning non-obvious behavior → docs in dashboard/docs/.

Docs must not overrule working code. If docs and code disagree, fix the docs in the same change unless the code is deliberately being corrected.

Authoritative typed sources:

engine/types.py — all shared domain types
engine/arb/routing/route_registry.py
engine/api/schemas.py — HTTP-specific response wrappers only
engine/db/backend.py, engine/venues/base.py, engine/web3_utils.py
Architecture Rules
engine/types.py is zero-dependency; any layer may import from here.
No module outside engine/api/ imports from engine/api/. engine/api/schemas.py holds HTTP-specific wrappers only and does not re-export from engine/types.py.
engine/venues/ — thin adapters only. No strategy, LP, or arb logic.
engine/market/ — market data, pool cache, volume, gas. No execution policy. Must stay importable in isolation: no engine/api/ or concrete adapter imports.
engine/lp/ — LP strategy and V4 position management. No arb-specific knowledge.
engine/arb/ — detection, routing, execution, risk. No LP internals.
engine/db/ — depend on store protocols in engine/db/backend.py, not concrete query modules.
engine/scheduler/core.py and engine/main.py are wiring shells. Business logic belongs in domain modules or engine/scheduler/jobs/.
In EngineRuntime, venues and lp_managers are parallel dicts keyed by venue name. LP position state → lp_managers; swap execution or price queries → venues.
Portfolio totals are governed by engine/market/portfolio_registry.py. Unregistered positions must not silently affect global totals.
The engine must stay splittable into three packages (Prices/dashboard, LP, Arbitrage). Cross-subsystem dependencies need explicit justification.
LP core decisions (range setting, rerange, lifecycle) must not depend on arb or blended fair value.
Code Style
No safe defaults for anything. Fail quickly and alert.
No defensive coding, dead abstractions, or compatibility shims.
No unused fields, parameters, or dataclass attributes after a refactor.
Comments only where logic cannot be reconstructed without them.
Prefer precise types, protocols, and narrowing helpers over Any.
Normalize once at Web3 boundaries; keep the representation consistent throughout.
Execution Flow Invariants
Review all when touching detection, routing, execution, recovery, or arb persistence.

Route and sizing

engine/arb/routing/route_registry.py is the sole source of truth for direction, pipeline, leg type, venue names, and cngn_effect. No duplicate direction lists or ad hoc classifiers elsewhere.
select_route() produces a decision (ranking, adjusted size, rescored profit, inventory tiebreaking). SelectedRoute holds routed size and profit metadata only — no execution-time token amounts or live state.
Inventory

Inventory is venue-local. quidax, uni-base, uni-bsc balances are independent and capped independently. A fill on one venue makes nothing available on another.
Router caps protect both legs: buy-side stablecoin and sell-side cNGN.
Serialization

_arb_executing serializes all execution and recovery across both pipelines. No queue — signals during a live trade or recovery are skipped.
Preflight

All on-chain legs must be preflighted with simulate_swap() before the live transaction. CEX REST legs are the explicit exception.
Error handling in engine/arb/execution/preflight.py is intentionally asymmetric: balance errors zero inventory for the venue; rpc, permit2, and unknown errors do not mutate inventory; pool_paused trips the circuit breaker. Do not widen inventory mutation without a concrete incident-driven reason.
Live amounts

Execution derives amounts locally at execution time. CEX sell legs use the actual buy fill. DEX sell legs use the preflight cNGN estimate — not a routing field or live wallet balance. Recovery uses persisted buy_amount_cngn, never a fresh wallet query.
Half-open and recovery

Half-open = buy succeeded, sell failed. Immediately persist buy_tx_hash, buy_amount_cngn, executed size/status. Immediately trip the circuit breaker.
CEX-DEX and DEX-DEX recovery are separate flows. DEX-DEX: retry sell if preflight passes, else reverse the buy. CEX-DEX: reverse the buy using the stored buy amount.
Persistence And DB Invariants
CEX-DEX and DEX-DEX use separate persistence paths: update_arbitrage_opportunity / update_dex_arbitrage_execution_state. Preserve that split.
buy_amount_cngn and other recovery-critical fields must never be dropped by later updates.
For Optional numeric fields from DB or schemas: use is not None, never truthiness when zero is meaningful.
engine/arb/risk/history.py is append-only. Pipeline and direction come from the route registry.
Scheduler Invariants
TradingScheduler owns lifecycle and job registration only. Dependencies flow through SchedulerContext and narrow protocols. Do not add parallel ad hoc listeners for WS-driven arb updates or wallet activity.
DEX arb bootstrap is gated: seed pool state → seed gas → first DEX-DEX update.
