# TermPlot

TermPlot renders Plotly plots inside terminals by running a local web app in a
browser, taking a screenshot, and printing the image through terminal image
escape codes. It supports a plain CLI and a Nushell plugin path.

## Agent Docs Compatibility

This repository uses `AGENTS.md` as the source of truth for agent instructions.
Do not create an independent `CLAUDE.md`.

Every `AGENTS.md` must have a corresponding `CLAUDE.md` in the same directory,
and `CLAUDE.md` must be a symlink to `AGENTS.md`:

```bash
ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
```

This applies in every folder, not just the repository root. When adding,
moving, or removing agent docs, update both names together and keep
`CLAUDE.md` as a symlink to `AGENTS.md`.

## Project-Local Skills

Project-local skills live in the top-level `skills/` directory. Keep
`.codex/skills` and `.claude/skills` as symlinks to `../skills`; do not let them
become divergent copies.

Current project-local skills:

- `commit`: write GitPoet-style commit messages.
- `adversarial-review`: run fresh-context review gates for experiment designs,
  experiment results, implementation diffs, and technical claims.

## Issues and Experiments

Every significant piece of work gets an issue in `issues/`. Issues describe the
problem, provide background, and frame the solution space. Experiments are the
incremental steps that solve the issue.

### Issue Structure

Each issue is a folder. The `README.md` is the issue spine: frontmatter, goal,
background, analysis, an ordered index of experiments, and the final conclusion.
Every experiment is its own numbered file in the same folder. The README never
contains experiment bodies, only links to them.

```text
issues/0001-rendering-pipeline/
|-- README.md                    # spine: frontmatter, goal, background,
|                                # experiments index, conclusion
|-- 01-audit-current-pipeline.md # Experiment 1 body
|-- 02-rework-cli-rendering.md   # Experiment 2 body
`-- 03-...                       # one file per experiment, in sequence
```

The folder name is `{NNNN}-{slug}`. The number is zero-padded to 4 digits and
globally sequential within this repository. The slug is lowercase, hyphenated,
and describes the topic.

The full issue index is `issues/README.md`. If the repository has an index
generation script, regenerate the index after opening or closing issues.

### Frontmatter

Every issue `README.md` starts with TOML frontmatter:

```toml
+++
status = "open"
opened = "2026-06-15"
+++
```

For closed issues:

```toml
+++
status = "closed"
opened = "2026-06-15"
closed = "2026-06-15"
+++
```

Issues may add their own TOML frontmatter keys to `README.md`, experiment
files, or other issue docs for issue-specific metadata, as long as:

- `README.md` always preserves the reserved keys `status` and `opened`, plus
  `closed` when closed;
- additive keys are valid TOML between the `+++` delimiters;
- additive keys do not contradict the reserved keys or index tooling;
- the issue documents any added schema in its own `README.md`.

### README.md Structure

After the frontmatter, a new issue's `README.md` has these sections:

1. Title: `# Issue {N}: {descriptive title}`
2. Goal: one or two sentences describing the desired outcome.
3. Background: context, prior work, constraints.
4. Architecture, Analysis, or Proposed Solutions: technical details.

A new issue README has no experiments listed yet.

As experiments are created, the README grows an `## Experiments` section: an
ordered list linking to each experiment file, one per line, with a one-line
status. The README holds links and statuses only, never experiment bodies.

```markdown
## Experiments

- [Experiment 1: Audit current rendering behavior](01-audit-current-rendering-behavior.md) -
  **Pass**
- [Experiment 2: Rework CLI rendering path](02-rework-cli-rendering-path.md) -
  **Partial** (needs Nushell plugin coverage)
- [Experiment 3: Add PNG output](03-add-png-output.md) - **Designed**
```

Keep each status to one of: `Designed`, `In progress`, `Pass`, `Partial`,
`Fail`. Update the line when the experiment result is recorded, so the README is
an at-a-glance progress tracker.

When the issue is solved or abandoned, add a `## Conclusion` section to the
README.

### Experiment Files

Each experiment lives in its own file `NN-{slug}.md` in the issue folder, where
`NN` is a zero-padded two-digit number in creation order (`01`, `02`, ...,
`99`). The slug is lowercase-hyphenated and describes the experiment.

An experiment file may begin with optional TOML frontmatter (`+++ ... +++`)
before its H1 title for issue-specific metadata such as agent provenance.
Experiment frontmatter is optional and must not replace the required H1 title
and H2 sections.

Each experiment file contains:

1. Title: `# Experiment {N}: {descriptive title}`
2. `## Description`: what and why.
3. `## Changes`: specific code changes, listed by file.
4. `## Verification`: concrete test steps and pass/fail criteria.
5. `## Result` and `## Conclusion`: added after the experiment runs.

Keep each file focused. If one grows past roughly 1000 lines, split the work
into the next numbered experiment.
