# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SpreadPaper is a native macOS app (Swift 6 / SwiftUI) that spreads a single high-resolution image across multiple monitors as wallpaper. Requires macOS 15.0+ (Sequoia) and Apple Silicon. The repo also contains a Vite + Tailwind CSS marketing website.

## Build & Run

**macOS App (Xcode):**
```bash
open SpreadPaper.xcodeproj    # Open in Xcode, then Cmd+R to build/run
xcodebuild -scheme SpreadPaper -configuration Debug build   # CLI build
```

**Website:**
```bash
npm ci
npm run dev      # Local dev server
npm run build    # Production build to dist/
```

## Architecture

The app has only 4 Swift source files:

- **SpreadPaperApp.swift** — App entry point, integrates UpdateChecker on launch
- **ContentView.swift** (~950 lines) — All UI and core logic:
  - `WallpaperManager` (ObservableObject) — Screen detection, image rendering via CGContext, wallpaper application via `NSWorkspace.setDesktopImageURL()`, preset persistence as JSON
  - `SavedPreset` / `DisplayInfo` / `AppSettings` — Data models
  - NavigationSplitView layout with sidebar (presets) and detail (canvas editor)
- **UpdateChecker.swift** — Fetches latest GitHub release, parses CHANGELOG.md for version history
- **UpdatePopupView.swift** — Update notification popup UI

### Key Implementation Details

- Images are stored in `~/Library/Application Support/SpreadPaper/` with UUID filenames
- Per-screen wallpapers saved as `spreadpaper_wall_{screenName}_{timestamp}.png`
- Old wallpapers are auto-cleaned on reapplication
- Multi-monitor rendering uses CGContext with coordinate transforms to handle scaling, offsets, and image flipping across displays
- Presets serialized to `spreadpaper_presets.json` in the app support directory

### App Sandbox

Entitlements: sandbox enabled, user-selected read-only file access, network client (for update checking). App is not code-signed with a paid Apple Developer ID.

## Release Process

Automated via GitHub Actions with `release-please`:
- Pushes to `main` trigger release-please to create/update release PRs
- On release, the app is archived with `xcodebuild`, ad-hoc signed, and distributed as both DMG and ZIP
- Version is sourced from `.release-please-manifest.json` and synced into the Xcode project's `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`

## Conventions

- Swift 6 strict concurrency
- SwiftUI with `@StateObject` for managers, `@State` for local UI state, `@AppStorage` for persisted settings
- Combine for async operations (update checker)
- Conventional commits (feat/fix/chore) — release-please generates CHANGELOG.md from these
