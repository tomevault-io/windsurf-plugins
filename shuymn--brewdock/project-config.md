<!-- Maintenance: Update when tasks, hooks, or project scope changes. -->
<!-- Audience: All docs under docs/ and this file are written for coding agents (LLMs), not humans. Use direct instructions, not tutorials or explanations of concepts the agent already knows. Apply this rule when creating or updating any documentation. -->

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- Use Task ([Taskfile.yml](Taskfile.yml)) as the default interface
- `task build` / `task test` / `task lint` / `task fmt` / `task check` — primary workflow; `task check` runs formatting check, Clippy, tests, `cargo doc`, and build; `task check:fast` skips tests and docs (see [docs/tooling.md](docs/tooling.md))
- `task bench:vm -- --formula tree [--formula-set jq,wget] [--manager <name> ...]` — comparative install benchmark in a disposable Tart macOS VM for Homebrew / brewdock / zerobrew / nanobrew; destructive only inside the VM
- Rust-native equivalents work without Task: `cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings` (same as `task lint`; see [docs/tooling.md](docs/tooling.md) for Clippy policy details)
- Run the CLI: `cargo run -p brewdock-cli -- <args>` (binary name: `bd`)
- Focused test run: `cargo test -p brewdock-core -- layout`, `cargo test -p brewdock-formula -- types`, etc.
- VM smoke test: `./tests/vm-smoke-test.sh [--keep] [--formula <name> ...]` runs destructive install verification inside a disposable Tart macOS VM so the local `/opt/homebrew` environment is not modified; prerequisites live in [tests/vm-smoke-test.sh](tests/vm-smoke-test.sh)
- Prefer `cargo add` / editing `Cargo.toml` for dependencies; run `cargo build` or `task build` after manifest changes
- `unsafe_code` is **denied** via workspace `[lints]` and allowed only in `brewdock-sys` (FFI wrappers); `unwrap`/`expect`/`todo`/`dbg!` are **denied** — applies to all code including tests
- 6-crate workspace: `brewdock-cli` (bin: `bd`), `brewdock-core`, `brewdock-formula`, `brewdock-bottle`, `brewdock-cellar`, `brewdock-sys` — see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)

## Git Conventions

- When asked to commit without a specific format, follow Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>`
- Never use `--no-verify` when committing or pushing; fix the underlying hook failure instead

## Documentation Scope

<!-- Keep this file limited to always-on repository rules. -->
- Read `docs/coding.md` before writing or modifying any Rust code.
- Read `docs/testing.md` before writing or modifying tests.
- Read `docs/tooling.md` when working with build, CI, hooks, or adding tools.
- Read `docs/review.md` when performing code review.
- Read `docs/architecture.md` for crate boundaries, dependency graph, and tech decisions.
- Read `docs/adr/` only when historical rationale matters.
