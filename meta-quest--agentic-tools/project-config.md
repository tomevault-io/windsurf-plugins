# Agent Guide — Meta Quest Agentic Tools

This file helps AI agents navigate and use this repository effectively.

## What this repo is

A skills repository for AI coding agents that provides domain-specific guidance for **Meta Quest and Horizon OS** development. Skills are not code libraries — they are structured prompts and reference documentation that teach agents how to perform Quest development tasks. The repo includes Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Gemini-compatible packaging, and the skill format is intended to remain compatible with the broader open Agent Skills ecosystem.

## How skills work

Each skill is a directory under `skills/` with:

- `SKILL.md` — required; the main skill definition and prompt
- optional supporting files/directories such as `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`, `examples/`, and `agents/`

Agents should read `SKILL.md` first, then selectively load only the supporting files needed for the current task. Do not assume every skill has a `references/` directory, and avoid loading all supporting files upfront.

## Shared references

The current repo keeps general hzdb reference material in:

- `docs/hzdb.md` for the generated end-to-end CLI reference
- `skills/hzdb-cli/` for install guidance, MCP usage, and focused hzdb deep dives

When a skill needs generic hzdb command guidance, prefer referencing those existing docs instead of creating another parallel copy.
