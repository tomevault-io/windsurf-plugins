# SQL Rules

This rule applies to all SQL files in the project.

## File Pattern
*.sql

## Description
When working with SQL files, we use DuckDB as our database engine. SQL files should be executed using the command `duckdb local.db -f {file}`.

## Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use SQLFluff for formatting with DuckDB dialect
- Format on save

## Commands
- Run SQL file: `duckdb local.db -f {file}`

## Best Practices
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include comments for complex queries
- Use proper indentation for readability
- Follow DuckDB's SQL dialect specifications
