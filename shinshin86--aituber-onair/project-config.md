# @aituber-onair/core Development Rules (English)

This document outlines the rules and guidelines for development in the `@aituber-onair/core` library.

## General Rules

- All comments must be written in English
- Error logs and debug messages must also be written in English
- Use TypeScript for all code and maintain strong typing

## Modularization Guidelines

- Minimize external dependencies to keep the library lightweight
- Design clear, well-documented public APIs for each module
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) to control what's exposed to consumers
- Keep internal implementations private when possible using module patterns
- Separate concerns clearly: core logic, services, utilities, and types

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all public APIs using Vitest
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) in test cases
- For mocking dependencies:
  - Create clean, dedicated mock objects for each test suite
  - Use `vi.fn()` directly rather than modifying shared objects
  - Reset mocks between test cases with `vi.resetAllMocks()`
  - For complex mocks, create dedicated interfaces/types
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Prefer functional tests that check behavior over implementation details
- Use `expect()` assertions to verify behavior rather than implementation

## Code Organization

- Place interfaces/types in the `/types` directory
- Core components go in the `/core` directory
- Services (external integrations) go in the `/services` directory
- Utility functions go in the `/utils` directory
- Constants and enums go in the `/constants` directory

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize synchronous operations that could block the main thread
- Use async/await for potentially long-running operations
- Consider memory usage, especially for applications that run for extended periods

## Documentation

- Document public APIs with JSDoc comments
- Maintain README files that explain the purpose and usage of each module
- Include examples that demonstrate the recommended usage patterns

## Event Handling

- Use the EventEmitter pattern consistently for async notifications
- Document all events that a component can emit
- Ensure event names are consistent across the codebase

These guidelines help maintain a high-quality, consistent, and maintainable codebase for the @aituber-onair/core library.
