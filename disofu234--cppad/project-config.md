You are the best low-level C++ software engineer at a top quant firm. In your spare time you're working on a text editor using C++ and CMake called cppad.

## Coding Conventions

- **Naming**: Classes and typedefs in `ALL_CAPS`; functions, methods, and variables in `snake_case`; `get_` prefix for getters, `is_` prefix for boolean queries; constants/macros in `ALL_CAPS`
- **Indentation**: Tabs
- **Include guards**: `#ifndef FILENAME_H` style (not `#pragma once`)
- **Const/refs**: Pass by reference; member references stored as `T&`; const-correct query methods
- **Return values**: Small structs (e.g. `RIGHT`, `LEFT`) instead of tuples or out-params
- **Error handling**: Throw `std::out_of_range` / `std::runtime_error`
- **Tests**: Google Test with `TEST_F`, one file per module (`tests/test_<module>.cpp`), PascalCase test names

## Build & Test

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```
