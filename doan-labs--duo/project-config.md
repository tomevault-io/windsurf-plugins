# AGENTS.md

A folding iPhone Duo rendered with Three.js, shipping as a web page and as a native desktop window.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime, bundler, dev server | Bun |
| Language | TypeScript, strict |
| UI | React 19, StyleX 0.19 compiled by a Bun plugin (`stylex-plugin.ts`) |
| 3D | Three.js r186, USDLoader |
| Desktop shell | Tauri 2 (Rust) |
| Model | Apple's iPhone Duo USDZ, flattened to USDC |

## Commands

```sh
bun run dev          # web dev server
bun run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
bun run format       # biome check --write .
bun run build        # dist/
bun run desktop      # native window
bun run desktop:build
```

Fresh clone also needs the model, once: `pip install usd-core && python3 scripts/prepare-model.py`.

## Structure

The authoritative file tree is in [README.md](README.md).

## Docs

`docs/` is the memory of this project. Start with the [documentation index](docs/README.md),
then read the pages relevant to the task before changing anything non-trivial:

| Task | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Scene, fold, displays, SpringBoard or native shell | [Architecture](docs/architecture.md), [working guide](docs/working.md) |
| SDK, sandbox, app sessions, storage or lifecycle | [Platform overview](docs/platform/README.md), [accepted contract and amendments](docs/platform/contract.md), [runtime](docs/platform/runtime.md), [security](docs/platform/security.md); [manifest](docs/platform/manifest.md) or [updates](docs/platform/updates.md) as relevant |
| App authoring, CLI, UI kit or Store | [Development](docs/platform/dev.md), the relevant package README, [UI kit](docs/platform/uikit.md) or [Store](docs/platform/store.md); distinguish trusted baked apps from sandboxed apps |
| Verification, website integration or release preparation | [Debugging](docs/debug.md) before verification, [local review](docs/platform/review.md) for reproducible platform checks for measured limits; [website handoff](docs/platform/website-integration.md), [website plan](docs/platform/web.md) and [publishing](docs/platform/publishing.md) when relevant |
| Community app submission, review checks or catalog publication | [Publication](docs/platform/publishing.md), [community-apps guide](community-apps/README.md); the publisher moves data only, never runs app code in a credentialed job |
| Scope or design changes | [Project decisions](docs/decisions.md), [roadmap](docs/platform/roadmap.md), [current scope](docs/platform/README.md) |
| Browser AI builder, providers, compilation or live revisions | [Browser builder](docs/platform/builder.md), [security](docs/platform/security.md), [local review](docs/platform/review.md) |

Current platform references describe enabled behavior; the roadmap separates deferred work.
The contract governs enabled safety guarantees. Resolve apparent code/contract conflicts
explicitly; do not silently weaken the contract to match code. Verification claims belong
in the current review guide with their limits. Chromium evidence is not native parity,
publication or deployment evidence. Do not recreate progress or archive folders; Git history
retains committed historical documents.

Update the owning guide in the same change: constraints and gotchas in working.md,
responsibilities in architecture.md, observation procedures and false alarms in debug.md.
Append numbered design decisions to decisions.md; preserve history and explicitly supersede
conflicting entries. Update platform references for SDK/runtime changes and regenerate
`docs/platform/api/uikit.json` through `scripts/generate-kit-docs.ts`, never by hand.
Keep [the documentation index](docs/README.md) and this task routing current when pages move;
fix inbound links and check website doc consumers. The root README remains the only repository
file tree.

## Verification

Use the `agent-browser` CLI (`.agents/skills/agent-browser`) as the default for
web UI, behavior checks, and screenshots; load its workflow first with
`agent-browser skills get core`. Do not reach for Playwright or any other
browser driver unless the user asks for one. Follow
[docs/debug.md](docs/debug.md) for what to assert: run the local web server,
exercise the real page, and inspect both state and captured pixels.

Use the visible Tauri app when testing native integration, window behavior,
WKWebView-specific rendering, or a GPU/timing issue a Chromium browser cannot
resolve, or when the user explicitly requests it. Report which runtime was
verified; Chromium results do not establish native WebKit parity.

## Conventions

- Hard rule: em dashes (U+2014) are banned throughout the repository. Use only the normal ASCII dash (`-`, U+002D) instead.

- One responsibility per file, named after it. New feature the web can call: a file in `packages/shell/desktop/commands/`. New OS-specific code: behind the `Platform` trait in `packages/shell/desktop/platform/`. Never inline either in `main.rs`.
- `packages/shell/native.ts` owns every Tauri check. The rest of the web code never touches `window.__TAURI__`.
- Shaders are TS modules exporting a string, not `.glsl` files - the bundler treats those as assets.
