# Repository Entry

This file is the local repository entry for this checkout. The plugin package supports Codex, Copilot CLI, and Claude Code: Codex install metadata lives in `.codex-plugin/` and `.agents/`, Codex custom agent adapters live in `.codex/agents/`, Copilot installable agents live in root `agents/`, Claude Code agent adapters live in root `claude-agents/`, shared installable skills live in root `skills/`, role-specific workflow skills live in `skills/*-workflow/`, and repository instructions live in `.github/instructions/**`. Platform, system, and explicit user instructions have higher priority than repository files; when there is no conflict, read the entries below.
This project provides plugins for Codex, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot. As such, the .github, .agents, .codex-plugin, .claude, and .claude-plugin directories, along with AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md, are used by this project itself rather than by the plugins it generates or manages. Unless explicitly required, do not modify the contents of these directories or files.

## Required Entries

1. `.github/instructions/must.instructions.md`: core rules, memory layers, prompt assembly, state contracts, language policy, and verification gates.
2. `.github/instructions/skills-index.instructions.md`: lightweight repo skill index.
3. `.github/instructions/project.instructions.md`: repository facts, build/test commands, and high-frequency conventions.
4. `skills/target-*-bootstrap/SKILL.md`: installable templates used to create target-local instructions, memory, and spec scaffolds after repo init.
5. `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `.agents/skills`, and `.codex/agents/*.toml`: Codex plugin manifest, local/repo marketplace metadata, repo-scoped skills, and Codex custom agent adapters.
6. `claude-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `claude-agents/*.md`: Claude Code plugin manifest and lowercase-hyphen subagent adapters.

## Local Conventions

- Before non-trivial repository tasks, read the relevant parts of `.github/instructions/project.instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/must.instructions.md`.
- For repository initialization checks, use `repo-init-gate` first. It should read only the target root `best-copilot.md` and skip `repo-init-scan` only when the sentinel frontmatter version matches the current contract.
- When choosing a skill, read `.github/instructions/skills-index.instructions.md` first, then open only the selected skill under root `skills/`. Do not bulk-read `skills/`.
- When working in a target repository that has its own memory, progressively read that target repository's `memories/repo/INDEX.md -> current-workstreams.md -> linked_spec/linked_memory`.
- This plugin checkout does not keep active target-project `memories/**` or `spec/**`; installed projects should be initialized through the bootstrap skills.
- Edit Codex install metadata through `.codex-plugin/` and `.agents/`; edit Codex custom agent adapters through `.codex/agents/`; edit Copilot installable agents through root `agents/`; edit Claude Code adapters through root `claude-agents/`; edit shared installable skills through root `skills/`; edit repository instructions through `.github/instructions/**`.
- Do not commit or run destructive commands unless explicitly requested.
- Detect the user's primary language and answer in that language unless the user asks otherwise.

## Runtime Adapter

| Copilot Capability | Local Mapping | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| agent / handoff | `spawn_agent` + `wait_agent` / `send_input` | Use only when the user explicitly asks for agents, delegation, or parallel agent work. |
| read / search | `rg`, `sed`, `find`, `git diff`, and other read-only commands | Prefer explicit user paths and index hits; avoid unbounded scanning. |
| edit | Top-level session uses `apply_patch` | `.github/instructions/**`, `.codex/agents/**`, root `agents/`, root `skills/`, `AGENTS.md`, and bootstrap skill template changes are handled inline by the top-level session. |
| execute | `exec_command` | Real command evidence must include command and result. |
| todo | `update_plan` | Session plan only; does not replace formal spec/task state. |
