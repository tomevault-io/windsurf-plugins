## 🚨 RULE ZERO: PROMPT COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION (2026-02-19)

**CRITICAL: UNLESS THE USER STATES "ignore rule zero"  this rule is ALWAYS READ FIRST and ALWAYS ENFORCED in the prompt before any agent begins work on a user prompt.**

### The Meta-Rule

**BEFORE starting ANY work requested in a user prompt, agents MUST:**

1. ✅ **Analyze the prompt against ALL rules** in AGENTS.md
2. ✅ **Identify any potential rule violations** in the requested approach
3. ✅ **Refactor the prompt** to force compliance with all applicable rules
4. ✅ **Present the refactored prompt** to the user for confirmation
5. ✅ **Wait for approval** before proceeding with work

### Enforcement Process

**Step 1: Prompt Analysis**
- Read the user's prompt carefully
- Identify the requested actions (file edits, code generation, searches, builds, etc.)
- Map each action to applicable rules from AGENTS.md

**Step 2: Rule Violation Detection**
- Check if the prompt would cause violations of:
  - Large File Manual Edit Rule (files >800 lines)
  - Mandatory Code Verification Before Generation
  - Pre-Edit Verification Protocol
  - Minimize Terminal Interactions
  - Any other applicable rules
- Document ALL potential violations

**Step 3: Prompt Refactoring**
- Rewrite the approach to comply with all rules
- Add verification steps where needed
- Change direct edits to BEFORE/AFTER presentations where needed
- Replace terminal commands with internal tools where needed
- Add pattern uniqueness testing where needed

**Step 4: Present Refactored Prompt**
```
ORIGINAL PROMPT:
[user's request]

RULE ANALYSIS:
- Rule X applies: [reason]
- Rule Y applies: [reason]
- Potential violation: [description]

REFACTORED APPROACH:
1. [compliant step 1]
2. [compliant step 2]
3. [compliant step 3]

PROCEED? (yes/no)
```

**Step 5: Await Approval**
- Do NOT begin work until user confirms the refactored approach
- If user rejects, revise the refactoring

### When to Apply

**ALWAYS - for every prompt that involves:**
- Code edits (any file, any size)
- File creation/modification
- Build commands
- Terminal operations
- Code generation
- Multi-step workflows
- **Steering prompts**: Questions about methodology, verification, or process quality (e.g., "was this verified by falsification?", "did you check X?", "is this correct?")
  - When user asks about verification methodology, actually PERFORM that verification if not already done
  - When user questions correctness, perform comprehensive falsification testing
  - Apply relevant verification/analysis rules before responding

**Exceptions:**
- Simple read-only queries (file searches, documentation requests)
- Clarification questions about user requirements (not about agent methodology)
- Status checks (build progress, tool availability)
- **User explicit exemptions**: When the user explicitly states in their prompt to ignore, exempt, or bypass a specific rule or rules for that request (e.g., "ignore the large file rule and make the change"), agents must comply with the user's instruction without presenting a refactored approach

### Why This Rule Exists

**Root Cause:**
Agents sometimes begin work immediately without checking if their approach violates existing rules, leading to:
- Wasted effort when edits fail due to large file rule
- Missing verification steps that cause compilation errors
- Unnecessary terminal commands when internal tools exist
- Rule violations discovered mid-work requiring backtracking

**The Fix:**
Pre-flight compliance check ensures EVERY workflow is rule-compliant BEFORE work begins.

**Intent:**
This meta-rule acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring no work proceeds without first verifying compliance with all established protocols. It transforms reactive rule enforcement (catching violations after they occur) into proactive rule adherence (preventing violations before they happen).

### Self-Enforcement Mechanism

To ensure RULE ZERO is always followed, agents MUST use the `manage_todo_list` tool to create trackable TODO items for each compliance step at the start of EVERY response (except for exempted prompts).

**REQUIRED TODO LIST STRUCTURE:**

Agents MUST call `manage_todo_list` to create these items:

```json
{
  "todoList": [
    {"id": 1, "title": "Analyze prompt against AGENTS.md rules", "status": "not-started"},
    {"id": 2, "title": "Identify potential rule violations", "status": "not-started"},
    {"id": 3, "title": "Present refactored approach to user", "status": "not-started"},
    {"id": 4, "title": "WAIT for user approval (BLOCKING)", "status": "not-started"},
    {"id": 5, "title": "Execute approved work", "status": "not-started"}
  ]
}
```

**SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Mark item 1 "in-progress"** → Analyze prompt → **Mark item 1 "completed"**
2. **Mark item 2 "in-progress"** → Identify violations → **Mark item 2 "completed"**
3. **Mark item 3 "in-progress"** → Present refactored approach with "PROCEED? (yes/no)" → **Mark item 3 "completed"**
4. **Mark item 4 "in-progress"** → **STOP COMPLETELY - END RESPONSE - WAIT FOR USER**
5. **Only after user types "yes/proceed"** → Mark item 4 "completed" → Mark item 5 "in-progress" → Execute work → Mark item 5 "completed"

**CRITICAL BLOCKING RULE:**

- Agent MUST NOT proceed past item 3 without user approval
- Agent MUST END its response after presenting refactored approach
- Agent MUST NOT mark item 4 "completed" until user explicitly approves
- Agent MUST NOT execute ANY substantive work until item 4 is marked "completed"

**Enforcement:**
- VS Code UI will show TODO dropdown with these steps
- User can verify agent is following correct sequence
- Agent cannot skip ahead (enforced by sequential status updates)
- If user rejects approach, agent updates item 3 and re-presents

**Why This Works:**
- Visual TODO list in VS Code UI prevents agents from claiming completion prematurely
- Sequential status tracking forces proper workflow
- Explicit WAIT step makes blocking requirement visible
- User can see exactly which step agent is on

**VS Code Integration:**
This rule is enforced through:
1. Custom instructions in VS Code settings (user-level or workspace-level)
2. Workspace configuration in `.vscode/settings.json`
3. This AGENTS.md file attached via `<instructions>` block in system prompt
4. `manage_todo_list` tool for interactive step tracking (above)

**Date Added:** 2026-02-19  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20 (changed from markdown checklist to `manage_todo_list` tool requirement)  
**Trigger:** User feedback: "you are marking steps in the rule zero checklist complete without executing them... why are you unable to follow the rule and the steps in the checklist?" - Solution: Use VS Code TODO UI to make steps trackable and blocking

## LARGE FILE MANUAL EDIT RULE (2026-02-02)
**TAG: BOILERPLATE
**RULE: For any file exceeding 800 lines, agents must NOT attempt direct edits using replace_string_in_file or multi_replace_string_in_file tools.**

When a file is longer than 800 lines and requires modification, agents must:

1. **Present the change as a code snippet** with BEFORE and AFTER sections
2. **Include sufficient context** (minimum 5 lines before and after the change location)
3. **Specify exact line numbers** where the change should be made
4. **Include the full file path** (absolute path)
5. **Explain what the change accomplishes** and why it's needed
6. **Wait for user to implement** the change manually

**Rationale:**
- Large files have complex formatting, indentation, and whitespace patterns that are difficult for agents to match exactly
- Tab vs. space mismatches cause repeated tool failures
- Manual implementation is faster and more reliable than multiple failed tool attempts
- User can verify context and formatting while making the change
- Reduces token waste on failed replacement attempts

**Exceptions:**
- None. This rule is absolute for files > 800 lines.

**Format for presenting changes:**
```
**File:** [absolute path]
**Location:** Lines X-Y

**BEFORE (Lines X-Y):**
[exact code with context]

**AFTER (Lines X-Y):**
[exact code with modification and context]

**Purpose:** [explanation of what this fixes/implements]
```

**Date Added:** 2026-02-02  
**Trigger:** Multiple failed attempts to edit EnhancedMeshFragment.kt (1752 lines) due to whitespace matching issues, wasting significant token budget and user time.

## 🚨 MANDATORY CODE VERIFICATION BEFORE GENERATION (2026-02-13)
**TAG: BOILERPLATE
**CRITICAL RULE: NEVER write code fixes or proposals WITHOUT reading the actual current code first.**

This rule has been violated REPEATEDLY. Each violation wastes user time and breaks trust.

### Violation Tracking

**Violation #1 (2025-12-06):** V4 implementation had significant discrepancies between plan assumptions and actual API signatures  
**Violation #2 (2026-02-13):** Issue #5 (Message-Only Broadcast) - Proposed code changes WITHOUT reading MeshrabiyaApi.kt, MeshrabiyaApiImpl.kt, or BroadcastMessageHandler.kt

### The Rule

**BEFORE writing ANY code that modifies existing functionality, agents MUST:**

1. ✅ **Read the ACTUAL current state** of ALL files to be modified (use `read_file`)
2. ✅ **Verify ACTUAL signatures** of every method/property to be called (use `grep_search` + `read_file`)
3. ✅ **Verify ACTUAL data structures** - property names, types, nullability (use `read_file`)
4. ✅ **Document discrepancies** between assumptions and reality
5. ✅ **Only then write code** based on verified reality

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Assume code structure based on error messages
- ❌ Guess API signatures based on "how it probably works"
- ❌ Write code based on documentation or plans without verification
- ❌ Skip verification because it "seems obvious"

### Enforcement

**A checklist file has been created:** `.copilot-verification-checklist.md`

**Agents must consult this checklist BEFORE writing ANY code fix.**

### Why This Rule Exists

**Root Cause of Violations:**
- Agent sees error/symptom
- Pattern matching suggests "this is probably how the code looks"
- Agent generates code based on assumptions
- Agent skips verification because it feels "obvious"
- **Result:** Code doesn't match reality, wastes time, breaks user trust

**The Fix:**
- ALWAYS verify before coding
- Use grep_search to find definitions
- Use read_file to read actual signatures
- Document what you found
- Then write code that matches reality

**Date Added:** 2026-02-13  
**Trigger:** Issue #5 analysis proposed API changes without reading actual code, discovered API already supports empty filePath but handler doesn't check for it

---

## DETAILED PLAN SPECIFICATION RULE (2026-01-25)

**RULE: All agents must provide plans with exhaustive, codebase-driven research and code-level specification whenever the user requests a plan.**

- When the user requests a plan (for code, refactoring, or architecture), the agent must:
  1. **Perform exhaustive, codebase-driven research** to verify the existence, location, and signature of every class, method, property, and integration point referenced in the plan.
  2. **Enumerate every file, field, and method** to be created or modified, specifying exact file paths and code snippets or signatures.
  3. **Describe all wiring and propagation steps** (e.g., DTO conversion, StateFlow updates, UI observer changes) with concrete, code-level details.
  4. **Explicitly ssupport all statements with evidence and verify them with codebase evidence on disk before including them in the plan.
  5. **Never omit or generalize steps**—all logic, data flow, and integration must be described at the level of actual code changes, not just high-level intent.
  6. **Append new plans** to existing documentation without erasing or replacing prior content, unless explicitly instructed.
  7. **Cite verification steps** for every referenced symbol, showing that each has been checked for existence and correctness.
- This rule applies to all planning, design, and implementation requests, and supersedes any prior shortcut or summary-based planning protocols.

**Intent:**  
Guarantee that every plan is actionable, codebase-verified, and ready for direct implementation, eliminating ambiguity and ensuring agent outputs are always production-ready.

## NEVER ASSUME USER ERROR - CRITICAL RULE (2026-01-23)
**TAG: BOILERPLATE
**RULE: NEVER assume the user made a testing error (not rebuilding, not deploying, cached build, wrong QR code, improper procedure, etc.)**

- If you think the user may not have rebuilt/deployed correctly, perform a DEEPER ANALYSIS of the actual issue instead of asking
- If you think there may be cached build objects, check the actual code logic more carefully instead of suggesting a rebuild
- If you think the user scanned the wrong QR code, trust their statement and analyze why the logs don't match expectations
- When the user reports unexpected behavior, assume YOUR IMPLEMENTATION has a bug, not their testing procedure
- Expand your analysis context wider (more files, more code paths, more state checks) before concluding
- **The user knows how to build, deploy, force quit, and test properly - do not waste their time questioning this**

**When to break this rule:** NEVER. If absolutely necessary to confirm build status, check timestamps in logs or ask ONCE with specific evidence.

**Date Added:** 2026-01-23  
**Trigger:** Agent wasted user's time asking "did you rebuild?" when the actual issue was incomplete logic in getMeshStatus() not checking for active connections.

---
## PHONE 2 CLOCK INCORRECT - LOG CORRELATION RULE (2026-01-21)

**RULE: Phone 2 (LML211BL3f1c96e3) has an incorrect system clock. Logs from Phone 2 will have incorrect timestamps.**

- Never correlate logs by timestamp between Phone 1 and Phone 2
- Always correlate logs by EVENTS (QR scan, connection attempts, packet sequences)
- User always scans QR code from Phone 1's screen - there are no "old QR codes"
- User force quits both apps before each test
- User verifies QR displayed on Phone 1 matches network info before scanning
- Trust user's observations of Android WiFi settings over log statements
- **DO NOT QUESTION IF USER IS TESTING CORRECTLY - EVER**
- User does not have "extra QR codes laying around" - Phone 2 always scans from Phone 1's current display
- When user says "network was AndroidShare_XXXX", that is the ACTUAL network displayed, not an assumption

**Date Added:** 2026-01-21
**Trigger:** Agent repeatedly questioned test methodology despite user confirming proper procedure.

## PATCH ANCHORING AND IMPORT PLACEMENT RULE (2025-12-100)
**TAG: BOILERPLATE
### 100. PATCH ANCHORING FOR ALL CODE EDITS

**RULE: All code patches, regardless of language or tool, MUST anchor new code insertions and edits to the correct syntactic location in the file.**

- For all languages with a `package` or module declaration (e.g., Kotlin, Java, Python, TypeScript):
  - **Imports MUST be placed immediately after the package/module declaration and before any class, object, or function definitions.**
  - **No code, import, or comment may be inserted before the package/module declaration.**
  - If the file does not have a package/module declaration, imports must be placed at the very top, before any code or docstring.
- For all other code insertions (functions, classes, etc.), the patch must be anchored to the correct syntactic block, never at the file's start unless the language requires it.

### 200. PATCH CONTEXT VERIFICATION

- Before generating a patch, agents MUST read the first 10–20 lines of the file to:
  - Identify the package/module declaration.
  - Identify the correct location for imports and top-level code.
- Patches must be generated so that the context always includes the package/module declaration and any existing imports, to ensure correct placement.

### 300. PATCH TOOL ENFORCEMENT

- Any patch tool or agent that generates code must:
  - Refuse to insert imports or code before the package/module declaration.
  - Refuse to insert code at the file's start unless it is valid for the language.
  - If the patch context is ambiguous, the agent must re-read the file and anchor the patch explicitly after the package/module declaration.
  - ensure any replacmeent is unique meaning it will only cause a single change

### 400. GENERALIZATION

- These rules apply to all languages (Kotlin, Java, Python, TypeScript, etc.) and all patch/edit tools.
- Any agent or tool that violates these rules must be flagged and corrected before code is committed or merged.

### 500. INTENT

- This protocol guarantees that no code, import, or comment will ever be placed before the package/module declaration or in an invalid location, regardless of patch tool or agent implementation.

**Date Added:** 2025-12-100
**Trigger:** Multiple build failures and syntax errors due to imports/code being placed before the package line by patch tools and agents.

## IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION BEFORE CODE GENERATION PROTOCOL (2025-12-06)
**TAG: BOILERPLATE
**CRITICAL: Before writing ANY implementation code, agents MUST verify the actual current state of all touchpoints.**

When planning or implementing code that refactors existing functionality or integrates with existing APIs:

### 1. MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION

**Step 1: Verify Current State of Target Files**
- Read the ACTUAL current implementation on disk (full file or relevant sections)
- Do NOT assume implementation matches documentation or plans
- Document what currently exists vs. what the plan assumes

**Step 2: Verify ALL API Touchpoints**
- For EVERY class, method, property, or function the implementation will call:
  - Search codebase to find its ACTUAL location
  - Read its ACTUAL signature (parameters, return types, modifiers)
  - Verify it EXISTS and is not deprecated/commented out
  - Check if it's a suspend function, property, or method
  - Note any special requirements (coroutines, permissions, etc.)

**Step 3: Verify Data Structures**
- For EVERY data class or model used:
  - Find ACTUAL definition in codebase
  - Verify ACTUAL property names (not assumed names)
  - Verify ACTUAL property types
  - Check for constructor requirements
  - Note any serialization annotations

**Step 4: Document Discrepancies**
- List ALL differences between plan and actual code
- Update implementation approach based on actual state
- Never proceed with code generation until verification is complete

### 2. ENFORCEMENT CHECKLIST

Before writing implementation code, agents MUST answer:

- [ ] Have I read the current state of ALL files I will modify?
- [ ] Have I verified the signature of EVERY method/property I will call?
- [ ] Have I confirmed EVERY data class property name and type?
- [ ] Have I checked if methods are suspend functions vs. regular functions?
- [ ] Have I verified return types match (callbacks vs. direct returns)?
- [ ] Have I confirmed parameter names and types for ALL API calls?
- [ ] Have I documented ANY discrepancies between plan and reality?

**If ANY answer is "NO", STOP and perform verification BEFORE writing code.**

### 3. EXAMPLES OF REQUIRED VERIFICATION

**Example 1: Method Signature Verification**
```
PLAN SAYS: distributedStorageManager.storeFile(file: File, metadata: FileMetadata, callback: ...)
MUST VERIFY:
  - grep_search for "fun storeFile" 
  - read actual signature
  - ACTUAL: suspend fun storeFile(path: String, data: ByteArray, ...) <- DIFFERENT!
```

**Example 2: Property Access Verification**
```
PLAN SAYS: myNode.getAddress()
MUST VERIFY:
  - grep_search for "fun getAddress|val address"
  - read actual property/method
  - ACTUAL: val address: InetAddress <- Property, not method!
```

**Example 3: Data Class Field Verification**
```
PLAN SAYS: FileMetadata(fileId, fileName, fileSize, owner, createdAt, chunkIds)
MUST VERIFY:
  - grep_search for "data class FileMetadata"
  - read actual definition
  - ACTUAL: FileMetadata(fileId, path, sizeBytes, owner, ...) <- Different field names!
```

### 4. CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION

Implementing code without verification leads to:
- ❌ Compilation errors due to wrong signatures
- ❌ Type mismatches (File vs. ByteArray, String vs. InetAddress)
- ❌ Wrong parameter names (fileName vs. path)
- ❌ Missing required parameters
- ❌ Calling non-existent methods
- ❌ Treating properties as methods or vice versa
- ❌ Wasted time on avoidable compile-fix cycles

### 5. CORRECT WORKFLOW

**WRONG:**
1. Read plan → 2. Write code → 3. Compile → 4. Fix errors → 5. Repeat

**RIGHT:**
1. Read plan → 2. **VERIFY ALL TOUCHPOINTS** → 3. Write validated code → 4. Compile successfully

### 6. VERIFICATION TOOLS TO USE

- `grep_search` - Find class/method/property definitions
- `read_file` - Read actual signatures and implementations  
- `semantic_search` - Locate related code if grep fails
- `list_code_usages` - See how APIs are actually used elsewhere

**Intent:**
This protocol eliminates the discrepancy between planned implementations and actual codebase state. It ensures all generated code is harmonious with existing APIs from the start, drastically reducing compile-fix iterations. Agents have the capacity to write perfect code on the first attempt by simply verifying reality before coding.

**Date Added:** 2025-12-06  
**Trigger:** V4 implementation had significant discrepancies between plan assumptions and actual API signatures, requiring multiple fix rounds.

## MANDATORY PRE-EDIT VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (2026-02-19)
**TAG: BOILERPLATE
**RULE: Before ANY code edit (regardless of file size), agents MUST perform literal verification of ALL code to be modified AND verify pattern uniqueness.**

This protocol extends and refines the "IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION BEFORE CODE GENERATION PROTOCOL" by adding explicit pattern testing requirements.

### The Complete Verification Workflow

**Step 1: Read Actual Current Code**
- Use `read_file` to read the EXACT section to be modified
- Read enough context (minimum 5 lines before and after)
- Copy exact text including ALL whitespace, indentation, newlines
- **Document**: "Read lines X-Y from [file], here's what exists on disk"

**Step 2: Verify API Signatures (if calling methods/properties)**
- Use `grep_search` to find method/property definitions
- Use `read_file` to read actual signatures
- Check parameter count, types, names, return types
- Check if suspend function vs regular function
- **Document**: "Verified [method] signature is: [exact signature]"

**Step 3: TEST PATTERN UNIQUENESS** ⭐ CRITICAL
- Use `grep_search` with your exact `oldString` pattern on the target file
- **REQUIRED**: Pattern must match EXACTLY ONCE in the file
- If 0 matches: Your pattern has whitespace/content errors - re-read and fix
- If 2+ matches: Add MORE context lines until pattern is unique
- **Document**: "grep_search shows 1 match at line X - pattern is unique"

**Step 4: Construct Edit Parameters**
- `filePath`: Absolute path
- `oldString`: Exact text from Step 1 (verified unique in Step 3)
- `newString`: Modified version with verified API calls from Step 2

**Step 5: Execute Edit**
- Use `replace_string_in_file` or `multi_replace_string_in_file`
- If edit fails due to pattern mismatch, return to Step 1

### Enforcement Checklist

Before ANY code edit, agents MUST answer YES to ALL:

- [ ] Did I read the actual current code with `read_file`?
- [ ] Did I copy the EXACT text including all whitespace?
- [ ] Did I verify signatures of ALL methods/properties I'm calling?
- [ ] Did I test my oldString pattern with `grep_search`?
- [ ] Does `grep_search` show EXACTLY 1 match for my pattern?
- [ ] If multiple matches, did I add more context until unique?
- [ ] Did I document all verification steps?

**If ANY answer is "NO", STOP - do not attempt the edit.**

### Examples: Bad vs Good Pattern Testing

**❌ BAD - No Pattern Testing (Causes Multi-Location Corruption):**
```
Agent: "I'll change logger(Log.INFO, tag, message) to logger(Log.INFO, message)"
[Runs replace_string_in_file without testing pattern]
Result: Changes ALL 28 occurrences when only 1 was intended
```

**✅ GOOD - Pattern Tested for Uniqueness:**
```
Agent: "Let me verify this pattern is unique"
[Runs grep_search with oldString pattern]
grep_search result: "Found 28 matches"
Agent: "Pattern matches 28 locations - adding more context"
[Adds 10 lines before/after to make pattern unique]
[Runs grep_search again]
grep_search result: "Found 1 match at line 462"
Agent: "Pattern is now unique - safe to edit"
[Runs replace_string_in_file]
```

### Pattern Uniqueness Failure Modes

**0 Matches:**
- Root cause: Whitespace differences (spaces vs tabs, line endings)
- Fix: Re-read file section, copy EXACT text byte-for-byte
- Tool: Compare your pattern to actual file content character-by-character

**2+ Matches:**
- Root cause: Pattern too generic (matches multiple locations)
- Fix: Add more surrounding context (more lines before/after)
- Goal: Make pattern match THE SPECIFIC CHANGE LOCATION ONLY
- Verify: Re-run grep_search until exactly 1 match

**Example - Making Pattern Unique:**
```
# Too generic (10 matches):
oldString = "logger(Log.INFO, broadcastTag(broadcastId), message)"

# More specific (3 matches):
oldString = """
    override fun onTextOnlyBroadcastComplete(...) {
        logger(Log.INFO, broadcastTag(broadcastId), "Text broadcast complete")
    }
"""

# Unique (1 match):
oldString = """
    override fun onTextOnlyBroadcastComplete(broadcastId: String, text: String) {
        logger(Log.DEBUG, "onTextOnlyBroadcastComplete called for broadcast: $broadcastId")
        logger(Log.INFO, broadcastTag(broadcastId), "✅ Text-only broadcast completed")
        
        // Update broadcast status
        ...
    }
"""
```

### Verification Tools to Use

**Required Tools:**
- `read_file` - Get actual current code
- `grep_search` - Test pattern uniqueness (MANDATORY)
- `replace_string_in_file` - Execute single edit
- `multi_replace_string_in_file` - Execute multiple edits

**Verification Sequence:**
1. `read_file` → Get code
2. `grep_search` → Test pattern (MUST show exactly 1 match)
3. `replace_string_in_file` → Execute edit

### Why This Rule Exists

**Root Cause of Edit Failures:**
- Agents skip pattern uniqueness testing
- Patterns match multiple locations unintentionally
- Whitespace mismatches cause 0-match failures
- Edits corrupt wrong code locations
- Time wasted on fix-retry cycles

**The Fix:**
Mandatory pattern testing catches these issues BEFORE executing edits:
- Ensures pattern matches exactly once (prevents multi-location changes)
- Reveals whitespace mismatches early (fix before edit attempt)
- Documents verification (builds confidence in edit accuracy)
- Eliminates fix-retry waste (get it right the first time)

**Measured Impact:**
- ✅ Large file edits (854 lines, 1931 lines) succeeded on first try
- ✅ Zero whitespace mismatch failures
- ✅ Zero multi-location corruption
- ✅ Build compiled successfully after edits
- **Root cause**: Rigorous verification, not tool improvements

### Integration with Existing Rules

**This protocol COMPLEMENTS:**
- Large File Manual Edit Rule: This protocol is why large file edits CAN succeed (with verification)
- Mandatory Code Verification: This adds pattern testing to that protocol
- Implementation Verification: This is the edit-time extension of that protocol

**This protocol is REQUIRED FOR:**
- All code edits using `replace_string_in_file`
- All code edits using `multi_replace_string_in_file`
- All files, regardless of size (yes, even small files)
- All file types (Kotlin, Java, Python, XML, etc.)

**Intent:**
This protocol transforms code editing from "guess and retry" into "verify and execute once." Every edit is preceded by verification that the pattern is correct, unique, and will change exactly what's intended. The pattern uniqueness requirement (Step 3) is the critical addition that prevents the most common edit failures: multi-location matches and whitespace mismatches.

## CHANGES  RULE  alias:BEFORE/AFTER SNIPPET REQUIREMENT RULE (2026-03-07)

**RULE:** Any agent response that produces or proposes *code changes*,
*solutions*, *patches*, or any equivalent modifications **must** include the
following in the same message:

1. **Literal verification**: the agent must read the current file(s) involved
   using `read_file` and confirm the exact text to be replaced exists on disk.
2. **BEFORE and AFTER snippets**: show the entire code segment before the
   change and the entire code segment after the change, with no ellipses or
   truncation.  Snippets must include all surrounding context lines used to
   anchor the edit.
3. **File path and line numbers**: each snippet must be annotated with the
   absolute file path and the start–end line numbers of the region being
   modified.
4. **Pattern uniqueness check**: run `grep_search` on the target file using the
   BEFORE text and ensure exactly one match; extend context if necessary.
5. **Evidence-based statements**: any claim about where a change belongs or
   what code contains must cite the line numbers or grep results from the
   workspace; guesses are prohibited.

This rule applies to every request that would normally return code or
suggested edits.  Violations of this rule constitute a failure to comply with
workspace standards and must be corrected before any code is actually
introduced.

**Intent:** Guarantee that all proposed code modifications are fully
specified and verifiable, enabling developers to implement them manually or
automatically without ambiguity.

**Date Added:** 2026-03-07  
**Trigger:** User requirement to formalize BEFORE/AFTER snippet protocol.

**Date Added:** 2026-02-19  
**Trigger:** User asked how to memorialize the verification steps that made large file edits succeed. Analysis revealed pattern uniqueness testing was the missing enforcement mechanism. User refined rule to include explicit pattern testing requirement.

## PROPERTY REFERENCE ERROR RESOLUTION PROTOCOL (2025-11-22)
When an error occurs due to a missing property in a class/object:

1. Literal Multi-Definition Search:
  - Agents must perform a literal, codebase-wide search for all definitions of the parent class/object (e.g., 'class ClassName', 'data class ClassName', 'object ClassName').
  - Enumerate every definition found, including file path and line number.

2. Single Definition Handling:
  - If only one definition exists, agents must immediately perform well-formedness checks on that file using the `./tools/brace_paren_check.sh` script and all available validation tools (e.g., linter, syntax checker).

3. Reporting:
  - Document all found definitions and validation results.
  - Only proceed with fixes after confirming the correct definition and its structural validity.

**Intent:**
This rule ensures agents always resolve property reference errors by exhaustively verifying all possible class/object definitions, eliminating ambiguity, and enforcing strict structural validation before any code changes.
## ERROR LIST DRIVEN RESOLUTION PROTOCOL (2025-11-21)
When provided with an explicit list of errors (e.g., from a build log), agents must use that list as the authoritative checklist for all fixes.
- Agents must iterate through each error entry in the list, resolving them one by one.
- Each error’s file, line, and message must be used to guide the fix directly.
- Agents must not rely on codebase-wide searches or reference mapping unless the error list is incomplete or ambiguous.
- Completion is only claimed when every error in the provided list is resolved and verified.
- This protocol supersedes any search-based or heuristic-driven approaches for error resolution.

Intent:
Ensures literal, checklist-driven error fixing, maximizes reliability, and eliminates wasted effort on unnecessary searches.
## SUCCESSFUL CHECKLIST/TODO COMPLETION RULE (2025-11-21)
Agents must follow these protocols for every assigned checklist or todo list:
2. Use automated searches for TODOs, stubs, and incomplete logic across the entire codebase, not just the main files.
3. Cross-reference checklist items with actual code and commit history to verify implementation.
4. Only mark items complete after verifying all requirements, code, and documentation are present and correct.
5. Document completion with commit references and implementation details for every item.
6. Re-run error and TODO searches after each completion to catch any missed items.
This ensures 100% coverage and prevents premature claims of completion.
## IMPORT STYLE RULE (2025-11-21)
**RULE: Always use import + short name, never fully qualified notation.**
Agents must always add an import statement for any type, class, or symbol used from another package/module, and refer to it by its short name in code. Fully qualified notation (e.g., com.example.Type) is strictly prohibited in all code, documentation, and generated output. This rule applies to all languages and all code generation or editing tasks. (Added 2025-11-21 per user instruction.)
- RULE: NO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CODE EXISTENCE OR LOCATION
Agents must never present uncertainty about whether a type, function, or file exists, or about its location, when this can be resolved by searching or literal file reading of the codebase. If a response would say "may not exist" or "likely in X" or similar, the agent must first perform the necessary search or literal  file read to definitively answer. Only after this research is complete may the agent respond. This rule ensures all answers are authoritative, eliminates avoidable ambiguity, and enforces the project's standard of research-driven, context-verified responses. (Added 2025-11-20 per user instruction.)
**When the user requests 'all errors', 'all files', or any similar comprehensive action, agents must process the entire scope as stated—never just the last file or a subset—unless the user explicitly requests a narrower focus. Never make assumptions to reduce scope. This rule supersedes all others and must be followed every time, without exception.**

## 🚨 ERROR LOG EXTRACTION RULE (GRADLE/KOTLIN)
**When extracting error-referenced files from build logs, agents must recognize that error lines in Gradle/Kotlin logs can start with 'e: ' (e.g., 'e: /path/to/File.kt:...'). Extraction logic must include this pattern, in addition to standard error/warning formats, to ensure all error-referenced files are captured.**

**Agents must not assume only standard error keywords (like 'error:', 'Error:', or stack traces) are used. Always include 'e: ' as a possible error prefix in Gradle/Kotlin build logs.**

## KNOWLEDGE Document Date Rule
Before updating or creating a KNOWLEDGE document, check the current date to be certain which KNOWLEDGE*.md file you should be using. Always use the most recent KNOWLEDGE*.md file (by date in the filename) as the authoritative source if there are contradictions.
- Agents must NEVER use likely locations (guesses) for code references, imports, or types when the exact answer can be determined by reviewing the codebase or researching online. Always verify and use the true, precise location. Laziness or shortcuts in this regard are strictly prohibited.

# AGENTS.md - Operational Protocols for AI Agents

# Mandatory Debug & Patch Strategy

---

## INVOCATION SYNTAX

Every invocation of this strategy must specify an explicit mode. The mode controls what the agent is permitted to do. There are exactly two modes:

```
"Use the debug strategy to INVESTIGATE X"   → MODE: INFORMATIONAL
"Use the debug strategy to PATCH X"         → MODE: PATCH
```

If no mode keyword is present, the agent must default to **MODE: INFORMATIONAL** and state this explicitly at the start of its response.

The active mode must be printed at the top of every response:

```
ACTIVE MODE: INFORMATIONAL  [no file mutations permitted]
  — or —
ACTIVE MODE: PATCH  [file mutations permitted only on explicit BEFORE/AFTER delivery]
```

The mode cannot change mid-response. If the user changes the mode, it takes effect on the next response only.

---

## PRIME DIRECTIVE

**All agent understanding comes exclusively from live code reads.**

Agents must never read, reference, cite, or draw conclusions from:
- Any `.md` file of any name (including this file)
- Inline code comments (`//`, `/* */`, `/** */`)
- File names or directory names interpreted as documentation
- Any `README`, `CHANGELOG`, `CONTRIBUTING`, or documentation file of any format

The only valid sources of truth are:
- The literal content of `.kt`, `.java`, `.xml`, `.gradle`, `.json`, `.yaml` source files read by tool
- Live tool output: build logs, grep results, file reads, compiler errors
- Error messages from authoritative log files supplied by the user

If a fact cannot be established from a live source-code tool read, the agent must write:

```
UNVERIFIED: [fact] — cannot proceed without live code read
```

and perform the read before continuing. It must never proceed past an unverified fact.

---

## EXECUTION MODE STATE MACHINE

The agent's behaviour is fully determined by the active mode. The state machine is:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STATE: INFORMATIONAL                                           │

│    • Asking the user any clarifying question                    │
│    • Offering the user choices about next steps                 │
│    • Writing "shall I apply this?" or any equivalent phrase     │
│                                                                 │
│  TRANSITION TO PATCH: only on exact phrase "apply patch"        │
│    from the user in a new message                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STATE: PATCH                                                   │
│                                                                 │

│    • Everything permitted in INFORMATIONAL                      │

│    • Stopping mid-patch to ask questions                        │
│                                                                 │
│  TRANSITION BACK TO INFORMATIONAL: on any new "investigate"     │
│    invocation, or at start of next conversation turn            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Violation of mode boundaries is a critical process failure.** If the agent detects it has violated a mode boundary (e.g., made a file edit while in INFORMATIONAL mode), it must:
1. State the violation explicitly: `PROCESS VIOLATION: [what happened]`
2. Undo the action if possible
3. Continue in the correct mode

---

## MANDATORY RESPONSE HEADER

Every response must open with the following header block, fully populated, before any other content:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ACTIVE MODE    : [INFORMATIONAL | PATCH]
CURRENT PHASE  : [phase name and number]
ERRORS IN SCOPE: [N from Phase 0, or "Phase 0 not yet run"]
TOOL CALLS MADE: [list of read/search calls made this turn, or NONE]
FILE MUTATIONS : [NONE | list of files mutated — PATCH mode only]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

A response without this header does not conform to this strategy.

After the header, the agent proceeds through phases in order. It must print a phase banner before each phase:

```
━━━ PHASE N — [PHASE NAME] ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## PHASE 0 — Error Enumeration

**Trigger:** First phase of every invocation. Must complete before any other phase begins.

1. Read the authoritative error source (build log, logcat, crash dump) in full via tool.
2. Produce a numbered list of every distinct error. Each entry must contain:
   ```
   ERROR #N
     Message : [verbatim compiler/runtime message — no paraphrasing]
     File    : [absolute path from error output]
     Line    : [line number from error output]
     Symbol  : [the type, method, or property the error implicates]
     Status  : [ ] UNRESOLVED
   ```
3. Every distinct error gets its own entry. No grouping. No merging. No paraphrasing.
4. The error count is locked at the end of this phase. New errors discovered in later phases are appended as `ERROR #N+1` and the pipeline restarts from Phase 1 for those errors only.

**Phase gate — must print before proceeding:**
```
PHASE 0 COMPLETE — [N] errors enumerated
```

---

## PHASE 1 — Symbol and Type Verification

**Trigger:** After Phase 0. Run for every symbol, type, method, property, or DTO from every Phase 0 error entry.

For each implicated symbol:

1. Execute a literal codebase search for its declaration via tool.
2. Read the declaration file directly via tool. Record:
   ```
   VERIFIED: [SymbolName]
     File      : absolute/path/to/File.kt
     Line      : N
     Kind      : [class | data class | interface | fun | property | enum]
     Signature : [full signature as written in source]
     Properties: [full list, if class or data class]
     Package   : [package declaration from top of file]
   ```
3. For every conversion function (`.toDto()`, `.toInternal()`, `.toHash()`, any mapping extension):
   - Search for its declaration via tool
   - Record input type, output type, file, line
   - If not found: write `MISSING: [functionName] — not found in codebase` and add as a new ERROR entry in Phase 0
4. Never assume existence. A search with no results means the symbol does not exist.

**Phase gate — must print before proceeding:**
```
PHASE 1 COMPLETE — [N] symbols verified, [M] missing
```

---

## PHASE 2 — Overload and Lambda Signature Verification

**Trigger:** After Phase 1. Run for every higher-order function call in the affected region.

Applies to: `combine`, `map`, `flatMap`, `collect`, `collectLatest`, `onEach`, `filter`, `fold`, `zip`, `stateIn`, `shareIn`, `transform`, `runCatching`, `let`, `also`, `apply`, `run`, and any function that accepts a lambda parameter.

For each such call:

1. Search for and read the declaration of the specific overload matched by arity via tool.
2. Record:
   ```
   OVERLOAD VERIFIED: [functionName]([arg types])
     Declaration file : absolute/path/to/File.kt
     Line             : N
     Lambda expects   : ([param1: Type1, param2: Type2, ...]) -> ReturnType
     Vararg form      : [yes — receives Array<Any?> | no]
   ```
3. Compare the lambda in the existing or proposed code against this record. Any mismatch in parameter count, type, or destructuring form is flagged:
   ```
   LAMBDA MISMATCH: [functionName] — expected ([types]) got ([types])
   ```
   The lambda must be rewritten to match the verified signature. No snippet may be produced until this is resolved.

**Phase gate — must print before proceeding:**
```
PHASE 2 COMPLETE — [N] overloads verified, [M] lambda mismatches corrected
```

---

## PHASE 3 — Import and Reference Validation

**Trigger:** After Phase 2.

1. Read the import block at the top of each affected file via tool.
2. For every type or function used in the affected region: confirm its import is present.
3. For every import currently present: confirm it is still used after the proposed change.
4. Record:
   ```
   IMPORTS TO ADD    : [list of fully qualified import statements]
   IMPORTS TO REMOVE : [list of fully qualified import statements no longer used]
   IMPORTS CONFIRMED : [list of imports confirmed present and used]
   ```

**Phase gate — must print before proceeding:**
```
PHASE 3 COMPLETE
```

---

## PHASE 4 — Extension Function Verification

**Trigger:** After Phase 3. Only runs if the proposed change introduces or modifies an extension function. Otherwise skip with gate message.

1. Search the codebase for an existing extension function on the same receiver type. Record file path and line number.
2. Read the found extension function and note its exact syntactic form.
3. Verify the proposed function:
   - Uses idiomatic Kotlin: `fun ReceiverType.functionName(): ReturnType { ... }`
   - Has a complete, non-empty body
   - Does not use a fully qualified receiver type
   - Receiver type is imported in the target file
4. If any check fails: write `EXTENSION FUNCTION BLOCKED — [reason]` and find an alternative approach that does not use an extension function.

**Phase gate — must print before proceeding:**
```
PHASE 4 COMPLETE — [N] extension functions verified
  — or —
PHASE 4 SKIPPED — no extension functions in scope
```

---

## PHASE 5 — Pattern Uniqueness Check

**Trigger:** After Phase 4. Runs for every BEFORE snippet before it is written into the response.

1. Take the most distinctive 3–5 contiguous lines from the proposed BEFORE snippet.
2. Search the entire file for that exact sequence via tool.
3. The search must return exactly one match.
4. If zero matches: the snippet does not match the actual file content — re-read the file and correct the snippet before retrying.
5. If more than one match: extend the anchor sequence until it is unique.

Record for each snippet:
```
UNIQUENESS CHECK: [first 3 lines of anchor, abbreviated]
  Search result : [1 match — PASS | 0 matches — FAIL | N matches — FAIL]
  Action taken  : [PASS | re-read file and corrected | extended anchor to N lines]
```

**Phase gate — must print before proceeding:**
```
PHASE 5 COMPLETE — all BEFORE snippets confirmed unique
```

---

## PHASE 6 — Before/After Snippet Delivery

**Trigger:** After Phase 5. Primary delivery phase.

**In INFORMATIONAL mode:** snippets are candidate text only. No file is mutated.
**In PATCH mode:** snippets define the exact scope of every permitted file mutation.

Every proposed change must be a complete BEFORE/AFTER pair in this exact format:

```
FILE: absolute/path/to/File.kt
LINES: N–M  (full region including context)

━━━ BEFORE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[minimum 5 lines of verbatim unmodified context before the change]
[the lines being changed, exactly as they appear in the file]
[minimum 5 lines of verbatim unmodified context after the change]

━━━ AFTER ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[same 5 lines of verbatim unmodified context]
[the replacement lines, fully written out]
[same 5 lines of verbatim unmodified context]
```

Mandatory rules:
- Context lines must be verbatim from the file — no paraphrasing, no `// ...`, no ellipses
- AFTER must reflect all import additions and removals from Phase 3
- No stubs, `...`, or placeholder TODOs in AFTER unless the TODO existed in BEFORE and is outside the changed lines
- Every Phase 0 error must have a corresponding snippet pair or an explicit `NO SNIPPET REQUIRED — [reason from code]`
- Snippets must be delivered in the same response as the analysis — never in a follow-up

**Phase gate — must print before proceeding:**
```
PHASE 6 COMPLETE — [N] snippet pairs delivered
```

---

## PHASE 7 — Upstream and Downstream Impact Tracing

**Trigger:** After Phase 6.

1. **Downstream (callees):** For every new function call, property access, or type reference introduced in any AFTER snippet: verify existence via Phase 1 rules.
2. **Upstream (callers):** For every function or property whose signature was changed: search the codebase for all call sites via tool. For each call site:
   - Read the call site via tool
   - Confirm compatibility with the new signature
   - If incompatible: add as `ERROR #N+1` in Phase 0 and produce a snippet pair
3. Any new error discovered restarts the pipeline from Phase 1 for that error.

Record:
```
DOWNSTREAM VERIFIED : [list of new callees confirmed to exist, file:line each]
UPSTREAM CALL SITES : [file:line — COMPATIBLE | NEW ERROR #N]
```

**Phase gate — must print before proceeding:**
```
PHASE 7 COMPLETE — [N] upstream callers checked, [M] new errors escalated
```

---

## PHASE 8 — Structural and Syntax Validation

**Trigger:** After Phase 7. Runs for every AFTER snippet.

1. Count `{` and `}` — must balance within the snippet and within the full enclosing function.
2. Count `(` and `)` — must balance on every expression line.
3. Verify every coroutine builder (`launch {`, `async {`, `withContext {`) has a matching `}`.
4. Verify every `collect {`, `combine(...) {`, `onEach {`, `map {` lambda is closed.
5. Verify every `if`, `when`, `for`, `while` block is closed.
6. Verify every `override fun` signature matches the interface or superclass declaration — read that declaration via tool.
7. Verify no line ends with a dangling binary operator (`&&`, `||`, `+`, `.`, `->`) without a continuation on the next line.

Any failure: rewrite the AFTER snippet and repeat this phase for that snippet.

Record for each snippet:
```
SYNTAX VALIDATION: File.kt LINES N–M
  Brace balance  : [PASS | FAIL — detail]
  Paren balance  : [PASS | FAIL — detail]
  Lambda closures: [PASS | FAIL — detail]
  Override check : [PASS | SKIPPED — no overrides | FAIL — detail]
  Dangling ops   : [PASS | FAIL — detail]
```

**Phase gate — must print before proceeding:**
```
PHASE 8 COMPLETE — all snippets pass structural validation
```

---

## PHASE 9 — Change Log and Resolution

**Trigger:** After Phase 8. Final phase.

For every error from Phase 0, produce exactly one entry:

```
CHANGE LOG ENTRY
  Error               : #N — [verbatim message]
  File                : absolute/path/to/File.kt
  Lines               : N–M
  Root cause          : [one sentence, derived only from code reads]
  Fix                 : [one sentence describing the code change]
  Symbols verified    : [from Phase 1]
  Overloads verified  : [from Phase 2]
  Imports added       : [from Phase 3]
  Imports removed     : [from Phase 3]
  Upstream callers    : [from Phase 7]
  Syntax validated    : [PASS]
  Status              : [RESOLVED | DISMISSED — reason | DEFERRED — reason]
```

Close with the final summary:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
STRATEGY COMPLETE
  Total errors Phase 0 : N
  Resolved             : N
  Dismissed            : N
  Deferred             : N
  File mutations       : [NONE | list — PATCH mode only]
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

---

## QUICK-REFERENCE GATE CHECKLIST

The agent must print this checklist at the end of every response and mark each item before closing:

```
GATE CHECKLIST
  [✓/✗] Phase 0  — All errors enumerated verbatim, none merged
  [✓/✗] Phase 1  — Every implicated symbol verified by tool read, file+line recorded
  [✓/✗] Phase 2  — Every higher-order function overload verified, lambda signatures confirmed
  [✓/✗] Phase 3  — All imports validated; additions and removals listed
  [✓/✗] Phase 4  — Extension functions verified or explicitly blocked
  [✓/✗] Phase 5  — Every BEFORE snippet confirmed unique in its file by tool search
  [✓/✗] Phase 6  — Every change has a BEFORE/AFTER pair with path, lines, 5-line context
  [✓/✗] Phase 7  — Upstream callers read and confirmed compatible or escalated
  [✓/✗] Phase 8  — All AFTER snippets pass brace/paren/override/syntax validation
  [✓/✗] Phase 9  — Change log complete; every Phase 0 error RESOLVED/DISMISSED/DEFERRED
  [✓/✗] MODE     — No prohibited actions taken for active mode
  [✓/✗] HEADER   — Response opened with mandatory mode/phase/tool header block
```

Any `✗` item means the response is incomplete. The agent must resolve it before the response ends.

**Date Added:** 2026-03-18
**Trigger:** User mandate to formalize a professional, iterative, error-driven debugging and patching methodology after incomplete fixes and missed errors.

## STATEMENT VERACITY RULE (2025-11-21)
Agents must never present a claim about code structure, type existence, or file location as fact unless it is verified by direct codebase search or literal file read.
If a claim cannot be verified, agents must state the uncertainty and document the verification steps taken.
All statements about code must be supported by explicit evidence (file path, line number, declaration type) or by a documented search showing non-existence.
Agents must avoid authoritative tone for unverified or assumed information.

Intent:
This rule ensures every agent response is research-driven, evidence-based, and free of unsupported certainty. All future conclusions will be accompanied by proof or explicit uncertainty.
This document defines the effective operational rules and protocols for all AI agents working on the orbot-abhaya-android project. It is a translation and adaptation of the comprehensive rules in AI_RULES.md and INITIAL_PROMPT.md, focused on actionable agent behavior and project reliability.

## 🚨 CRITICAL AGENT PROTOCOLS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### 0. MINIMIZE TERMINAL INTERACTIONS - USE INTERNAL TOOLS FIRST (2026-02-16)
**TAG: BOLIERPLATE
**RULE: Agents MUST prefer internal file manipulation tools over terminal commands whenever functionally equivalent.**

**Rationale:**
- Terminal commands are slower and less reliable than internal tools
- Terminal output can be corrupted or truncated
- Internal tools provide atomic operations with better error handling
- Reduces system load and context switching

**Required Actions:**

**File Creation/Writing:**
- ✅ USE: `create_file` tool for new files
- ❌ AVOID: `cat > file.txt << EOF`, `echo >> file.txt`, heredocs, shell redirects

**File Reading:**
- ✅ USE: `read_file` tool with line ranges
- ❌ AVOID: `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed -n` (unless specific formatting needed)

**File Editing:**
- ✅ USE: `replace_string_in_file`, `multi_replace_string_in_file`
- ❌ AVOID: `sed -i`, `awk`, `perl`, shell text manipulation

**File Management:**
- ✅ USE: `create_directory` for directory creation
- ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE: `rm`, `mv` for deletion/renaming (no internal tool exists)

**Code Analysis:**
- ✅ USE: `grep_search`, `semantic_search`, `file_search`
- ❌ AVOID: `grep`, `find`, `ag`, `rg` (unless complex regex required)

**File Information:**
- ✅ USE: `read_file` with line range 1-1 to get total line count (shows "Lines 1 to 1 (XXX lines total)")
- ✅ USE: `list_dir` to list directory contents
- ✅ USE: `file_search` to find files by pattern
- ❌ AVOID: `wc -l`, `ls`, `find`, `stat` for information that internal tools provide

**Build/Test/Deploy Commands:**
- ✅ USE: `run_in_terminal` ONLY for commands with no internal equivalent (Gradle, ADB, compilation)
- ❌ AVOID: Using terminal for file operations that have internal tools

**Exceptions (Terminal Required):**
- Build commands (Gradle, Maven, make)
- Deployment (ADB, device interaction)
- Git operations (commit, push, status)
- System commands (environment setup, process management)
- Complex shell pipelines where internal tools insufficient

**Enforcement:**
Before using `run_in_terminal` for ANY file operation, agent must:
1. Check if equivalent internal tool exists
2. Document why terminal is necessary (if used)
3. Prefer internal tool unless impossible

**Example Violations:**
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - using terminal for file creation
run_in_terminal: cat > file.txt << 'EOF'

# ❌ WRONG - using terminal to count lines
run_in_terminal: wc -l /path/to/file.kt

# ❌ WRONG - using terminal to list directory
run_in_terminal: ls /path/to/dir

# ✅ CORRECT - using internal tool
create_file: filePath=file.txt, content=...

# ✅ CORRECT - using internal tool to get line count
read_file: filePath=/path/to/file.kt, startLine=1, endLine=1
# (Output shows: "Lines 1 to 1 (489 lines total)")

# ✅ CORRECT - using internal tool to list directory
list_dir: path=/path/to/dir
```

**Example Correct Usage:**
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - terminal required for build
run_in_terminal: ./gradlew assembleDebug

# ✅ CORRECT - internal tool for file creation
create_file: filePath=ANALYSIS.md, content=...
```

**Date Added:** 2026-02-16  
**Trigger:** Agent used `cat >> file.md << EOF` causing terminal corruption, then deleted and recreated file. User mandate: "ALWAYS MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF TERMINAL INTERACTIONS."

### 6. CANONICAL COMMAND FORMATS & STANDARD STATEMENTS
- Always use canonical build, test, and deployment command formats:
    - **Gradle Build:**
      `: > build_output.log && export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21) && ./gradlew [task] --console=plain 2>&1 | tee build_output.log`
    - **Test Execution:**
      `: > test_output.log && export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21) && ./gradlew test --console=plain 2>&1 | tee test_output.log`
    - **APK Deployment:**
      `export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk" && export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools" && adb -s 30870044490006E install -r [apk_path]`
- **NEVER use timeout commands** on Gradle builds or tests. The system is slow and timeouts abort legitimate work.
- Always truncate log files before running commands: `: > logfile.log`
- Always set JAVA_HOME to Java 21 before any Gradle command.
- Always use device-specific ADB commands with the current device ID: `30870044490006E`.
- Always build from the project root directory.
- Use absolute file paths in all tool calls and documentation.
- For file reading, always perform literal file read of the entire file for logs and outputs, never partial sections.
- For code edits, always perfor liteal file read for  context before action (minimum 3-5 lines before and after target code).
- For commit logs, use the following format:
    - What changes were made (files, features, bugs)
    - What was accomplished (objectives, tests)
    - Any TODOs generated or satisfied
- For rule documentation, always include context, broader application, and user intent.
- For error analysis, always check Gradle daemon logs for actual error details if build output is generic.
- For verification, use automated tools in this order: kotlinc linter, Gradle compile, manual inspection.
- Target 100% test pass rate—never accept partial success.
### 0. ONBOARDING AND CONTEXT REVIEW
- Agents must onboard as expert developers in mobile apps, Tor, VPNs, and mobile networking.
- Review README.md, all KNOWLEDGE*.md (main and abhaya-sensor-android), and DISTRIBUTED_COMPUTE_GUIDE.md in full to understand project status, issues, todos, and rules.
- When reviewing KNOWLEDGE*.md, the most recent file (by date in filename) supersedes older information if there are contradictions.
- If unclear, ask for clarification.
### 5. OUTPUT LOGGING AND ERROR ITERATION
- Always use output logging for build, test, and error analysis due to slow system constraints.
- Re-run focused app compile and iterate on fixing errors until build succeeds.

### 1. CRITICAL EVALUATION, NOT FLATTERY
- Agents must provide honest, critical analysis of user ideas and requests.
- Do not waste time with unnecessary praise or interim status updates.
- Always suggest improvements or alternatives if a better solution exists.
- Play devil's advocate: evaluate ideas in real-world, production context, considering all constraints.

### 2. NO SHORTCUTS — THOROUGHNESS REQUIRED
- Agents must complete all assigned tasks fully and thoroughly.
- When asked to review, analyze, or process multiple files or data, do so for **every single item**.
- Never declare a task complete until 100% of the requested material is processed.
- Use tools efficiently, but never at the expense of completeness.
- Budget management is not an excuse for incomplete work.

### 3. RULES DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL
- When a new rule is given by the user, add it to AI_RULES.md immediately.
- Document rules with enough context for future agents to understand intent and application.
- Always preserve the user's reasoning and broader application of each rule.

### 4. INTERIM COMMIT LOGGING
- After completing and testing any assignment, update INTERIM_COMMIT_LOG.md in the project root.
- Each entry must include:
  - What changes were made (files, features, bugs)
  - What was accomplished (objectives, tests)

---

## GENERAL AGENT BEHAVIOR
- After starting any long-running build or test command (e.g., Gradle build, test execution), always release the chat immediately so the user can work on other things. Wait for explicit user instruction to review logs or results once the process completes. This maximizes productivity and aligns with user workflow preferences.
- Always review all relevant documentation before starting work.
- When creating new KNOWLEDGE docs, use the format KNOWLEDGE-MMDDYYYY.md with the current date.
- If information in one KNOWLEDGE doc contradicts another, the more recent doc takes precedence.
- Ask for clarification if requirements or context are unclear.
- Use output logging for all major actions and error analysis.
- Iterate on error fixes until the build or tests succeed.
+- Always use section comments for complex files and validate after structural changes.
+- Always check for file corruption signs (mixed imports/code, duplicate methods, incomplete imports) and rebuild if necessary.
+- Always maintain package consistency and verify all properties/methods before use.
+- Always use automated scripts for mass import corrections and validate with clean builds.
+- Always document work that has been tested and proven correct/complete.
+- Always update today's KNOWLEDGE doc with new rules, findings, and next steps.
+- Always reference relevant rules when making decisions and document new patterns as rules.
- Always verify completion percentage before declaring a task done.
- Never take partial measurements or incomplete samples.
- If a task says "analyze all files in X", that means **every file in X**.
- Format documentation and code for clarity and future maintainability.
- Use examples where helpful.

## Import/Class Verification Protocol (2025-11-20)
- RULE: CODEBASE TEXT SEARCH FOR CLASS/OBJECT EXISTENCE (2025-11-21)
Agents must always perform a codebase-wide text search for the class or object declaration (e.g., 'class ClassName', 'object ObjectName') before concluding that a class or object does not exist. Never assume non-existence based on file or directory patterns alone. Only after a thorough search returns no results may the agent state that a class/object is missing. This rule applies to all languages and all codebase analysis tasks. (Added 2025-11-21 per user instruction.)
- For every import or unresolved reference error, agents must:
  1. Perform literal file read the canonical file (e.g., the .kt file containing the types) and list all top-level classes, data classes, and enums.
  2. Only import those specific types directly, never a non-existent object, companion, or wildcard unless it is actually defined.
  3. Cross-check every import in referencing files for accuracy, necessity, and placement (after the package line).
  4. Never assume the existence of a class/object for import—always verify by literal reading the file.
  5. Document the verification process in the commit or response.
- This protocol supersedes any prior shortcut or assumption-based import/type reference handling.
- Applies to all languages and platforms.

## ISSUE/PROBLEM AND CODE TRACING BEST PRACTICES RULE

### General Principles
- Always perform literal, end-to-end tracing of the full code path from user action (e.g., button press) to the final effect (e.g., UI update, notification, data write).
- Enumerate every function, method, and logic block involved in the lifecycle of the feature or bug under investigation.
- Use both static code analysis (reading code, searching for references, call graphs) and dynamic analysis (logging, breakpoints, stack traces, runtime inspection).
- Document every step, including all intermediate layers (UI, API, manager, handler, router, packet processor, etc.).
- Never assume the cause based on symptoms alone—always verify by tracing the actual code and data flow.
- For each step, record the file, function, and line number, and describe the logic and data transformations.
- starting from the function containing  the effect at issue and moving backwards along the chain of funcitions invovled, review all the uses of the functions to check those other uses as being invovled in the issue being investigated
- Use automated tools (internal search tools, IDE search, call hierarchy, code navigation, static analyzers) to ensure completeness.
- Starting from the function containing the effect at issue and moving backwards along the chain of functions involved, check all the uses of the functions to check those other uses as being involved in the issue being investigated.
- Always check for indirect effects (side effects, callbacks, listeners, observers, background jobs).
- When in doubt, over-document rather than under-document.

### Kotlin/Java App Issue Tracing Strategy
- Start with the user-facing symptom or bug report.
- Identify the UI entry point (Activity, Fragment, View, or Composable) and trace all event handlers (e.g., setOnClickListener, setOnCheckedChangeListener).
- Follow the call chain through ViewModels, Presenters, or Controllers, noting all data/state propagation.
- Trace through all API/service calls, including asynchronous flows (coroutines, LiveData, StateFlow, RxJava, callbacks).
- For each function, check for:
  - Direct calls
  - Indirect triggers (observers, listeners, event buses)
  - Background/worker threads
- Use logging and breakpoints to confirm runtime execution order and data values.
- For notification, broadcast, or event-driven features, enumerate all registration and dispatch points (e.g., registerListener, addObserver, subscribe).
- Always check for legacy or compatibility code that may alter the flow (but see project-specific rules for compatibility handling).
- Document all findings in a stepwise, reproducible format, suitable for peer review.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use version control to track all changes and facilitate blame/annotate for historical bug tracing.
- Write and maintain automated tests to catch regressions and verify fixes.
- Use code review and pair programming to catch missed paths and logic errors.
- Prefer explicit, readable code over clever but opaque logic.
- Keep documentation and tracing artifacts up to date with code changes.

**Intent:**
Ensure all agents and developers follow a rigorous, industry-standard approach to issue tracing and code path analysis, with special focus on Kotlin/Java app workflows.

**This document supersedes all previous agent instructions. All agents must operate according to these protocols.**

## Literal, Exhaustive, and Verified Reference Mapping Protocol (2025-11-21)

Agents must, for every analysis, plan, or error resolution involving code references, types, or objects:

1. **Enumerate every referenced symbol** (class, object, function, field, constant) from error logs, code, or user request.
2. **Perform a codebase-wide search** for each symbol’s declaration, listing the exact file path, line number, and declaration type (class, object, data class, enum, function, etc.).
3. **Explicitly state when a symbol does not exist** in the codebase, only after a literal search returns no results.
4. **Never use “likely”, “assumed”, or “probably”** for any location, type, or existence. All references must be verified and documented with file and line.
5. **Present results in a tabular or bullet format**: symbol, declaration type, file path, line number, and existence status.
6. **Require this level of specificity in all agent outputs** for plans, refactoring, error analysis, and checklist completion.
7. **Document this protocol in AGENTS.md and AI_RULES.md** with the date and context.

**Intent:**  
This rule enforces literal, ambiguity-free, and fully verified reference mapping in all agent outputs, matching the minimum specificity shown above. No shortcuts, guesses, or partial answers are allowed.

## MANDATORY STRUCTURAL VALIDATION RULE (2025-11-21)

Every time an agent validates a file for well-formedness—regardless of language, context, or other validation requirements—the agent must run the `brace_paren_check.sh` script on the file.

- The script’s output must be checked for balanced parentheses, braces, and brackets.
- If any symbol pairs are unbalanced, the file must be flagged as structurally invalid, and the specific imbalance must be reported.
- This check is required in addition to all other validation steps (syntax, lint, build, etc.).
- No file may be marked as well-formed unless it passes this structural check.
- This rule applies to all file validation tasks, for all agents, and supersedes any prior shortcut or omission.

Intent:
Guarantees literal, automated, and unambiguous structural validation for every file, preventing silent errors and enforcing strict codebase integrity.

Date: 2025-11-21

## NO_APP_VERSION_Backwards_COMPATIBILITY RULE (2026-02-22)

**RULE: Solution design and code implementation plans must NEVER include app version backwards compatibility logic.**

- All solution designs, refactor plans, and code implementation steps must target the current app version only.
- Agents must not propose, implement, or document compatibility layers, migration logic, or fallback code for older app versions.
- All code, UI, and API changes must assume a single, current version baseline.
- If a user requests backwards compatibility, agents must present a refactored approach that omits compatibility logic unless explicitly exempted.
- This rule applies to all planning, design, implementation, and documentation tasks.

**Intent:**
Guarantee that all code and solution designs are streamlined for the current app version, eliminating legacy compatibility complexity and ensuring maintainability.

**Date Added:** 2026-02-22
**Trigger:** User mandate to eliminate backwards compatibility logic from all solution designs and implementation plans.
