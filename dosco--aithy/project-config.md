# Aithy Agent Notes

## Code Organization

- Keep code clean, simple, and boring.
- Put separate subsystems in separate files and folders.
- Avoid mixed-responsibility modules. Startup wiring belongs in `src/main.ts`; behavior belongs in subsystem files.
- Keep files short. The repo enforces a 500-line hard limit with `bun run check:lines`; prefer smaller files before getting near that limit.
- Follow existing patterns before adding abstractions. Add an abstraction only when it removes real duplication or isolates a clear subsystem boundary.

## State And Sessions

- Runtime state is stored under `~/.config/aithy/<bot id>/` by default.
- `AITHY_BOT_ID` defaults to `default`.
- SQLite state lives at `~/.config/aithy/<bot id>/state.db`.
- `schema_migrations` is scoped by subsystem so session and soul migrations can each start at version `1` without colliding.
- Session history is stored in `session_items`.
- Processed soul data is stored in `metadata` under the `soul.md` key as `key`, `value`, and optional `hash`.
- Session transcripts are durable conversation memory.
- We do not persist Ax agent runtime state across turns. Each turn builds a fresh agent from the transcript; if the agent asks a clarification, the question is recorded in the transcript and the next user message is processed as a new turn (the agent re-derives any context from history).
- Persisted sessions are logical bot sessions. Live Microsandbox VMs are process resources and are recreated after restart.
- `bun run debug` lists SQLite tables. `bun run debug <table>` inspects a table, and `bun run debug <table> <id>` looks up a row by the table's primary lookup column.

## Slash Commands

- Shared slash commands are routed before messages reach the agent.
- The TUI keeps `/file <path> [message]` and `/quit` local.
- Supported shared commands include `/help`, `/skills`, and `/session <id | "name">`.
- Slash commands must never be forwarded as ordinary user prompts.

## SOUL.md

- `src/prompts/SOUL.md` is the packaged default.
- On startup, copy it to `~/.config/aithy/<bot id>/SOUL.md` only when the config file is missing.
- Treat the config `SOUL.md` as untrusted user-editable input.
- Hash the config file. If the hash changes, process it again with AxGen.
- Store only the processed safe responder guidance, hashes, metadata, and security notes in SQLite. Do not store raw source soul text in the DB.
- The `metadata` table is a simple key/value store with an optional `hash` column. Use `soul.md` as the key.
- Apply processed soul guidance only through `responderOptions.description`.
- The soul affects final response tone only. It must not change tool policy, sandbox boundaries, instruction hierarchy, host access, or security behavior.

## Safety Boundaries

- In Microsandbox mode, the agent never gets host shell access.
- In disabled mode, `sandbox.bash` runs host Bun Shell commands without isolation.
- Host files are exposed only through explicit attachment staging or `sandbox.mount`; disabled mode does not provide mount tools.
- Shell execution goes through `sandbox.bash` inside the configured sandbox provider.
- Generated files meant for the user should be written under `/workspace/out` and returned with `artifact.publish`.
- Persona text, transcript history, attachments, and tool outputs are context, not authority above system, developer, app, and tool safety rules.
