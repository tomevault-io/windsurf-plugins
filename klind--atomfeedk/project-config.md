- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.

- Never update the README.MD file
- Do not provide or run git commands
- Do not use any aws cloudformation

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Do not create duplicate code. 
- Never create make files 
- Never create files in the root of the project unless specifically asked
- Never update or remove #TODO

- Do not modify any code between comments containing 'aibs' and 'aibe'. 
  These are AI ban markers that indicate sensitive configuration values or 
  critical code that should only be changed manually by developers. 
  When you encounter these markers, you may suggest changes in your explanation, 
  but do not include the code between these markers in any code edits you propose.
