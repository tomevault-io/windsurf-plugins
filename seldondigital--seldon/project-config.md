## Seldon Themes

Themes package reusable visual decisions as tokens. Components reference theme tokens with `@` paths, such as `@fontSize.medium`, `@swatch.primary`, and `@font.body`.

Use `packages/core/themes/README.md` as the canonical reference for theme shape, token cells, type safety, imports, and adding theme content.

Use `packages/core/properties/README.md` for the property-style tagged values used inside look token `parameters`.

### Stock Themes

Stock theme template ids are:

- `earth`
- `highContrast`
- `industrial`
- `googleMaterial`
- `popPunk`
- `ibmCarbon`
- `seldon`
- `adobeSpectrum`
- `sunsetBlue`
- `wildberry`

`seldon` is the default stock preset. A workspace always keeps a `seldon` theme entry, and it cannot be removed. Other stock themes are optional.

`ThemeTemplateId` is the stock template id union. `ThemeInstanceId` equals `ThemeTemplateId`. Workspace theme refs and keys in `workspace.themes` are opaque strings at workspace boundaries until workspace theme types are aligned.

### Theme Structure

Theme files use fixed top-level sections in this order:

1. `metadata`
2. `modulation`, `colorHarmony`, `fontFamily`, `matchColor`, `highContrast`, `opticalPadding`, `autoFit`
3. `size`, `dimension`, `margin`, `padding`, `gap`, `corners`, `borderWidth`, `blur`, `spread`
4. `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`
5. `iconSet`
6. `swatch`
7. `font`, `border`, `gradient`, `shadow`, `scrollbar`

`iconSet` is not a token table. It has no `TokenType`, no `@iconSet.*` reference path, no `customN` slots, and no `THEME_TOKEN_SECTIONS` entry. It selects the active icon set and default render values.

### Token References

Use `ValueType.THEME_ORDINAL` for ordered scales, such as `@fontSize.medium`, `@margin.compact`, and `@borderWidth.small`.

Use `ValueType.THEME_CATEGORICAL` for named sets, such as `@swatch.primary`, `@font.body`, `@gradient.primary`, and `@shadow.moderate`.

Reference types live in `types/theme-reference-keys.ts`. Token id unions live in `types/theme-token-ids.ts`.

### Token Tables

Token tables use `ThemeTokenTable<TUnion, TCell>`. Reserved keys are required. `customN` keys are optional. Do not add ordinary custom slots to `theme-token-ids.ts`; only edit those unions for new reserved keys or new sections.

Every token except `@fontFamily.*` can accept `customN` keys. `@fontFamily.*` only has fixed `primary` and `secondary` slots.

`@swatch.swatch1` through `@swatch.swatch4` are reserved dynamic palette slots, not custom slots.

`computeTheme` injects cleared looks that stock themes do not author: `@font.normal`, `@border.none`, and `@shadow.none`. Each sets every facet to `EMPTY` and appears in the look picker like a stock look. The `@gradient.*` section has no cleared look.

### Token Types

Theme token cells use `TokenType`:

- `MODULATED` for scale steps against `modulation.parameters.baseSize` and `modulation.parameters.ratio`.
- `EXACT` for fixed numeric values with units.
- `DYNAMIC_SWATCH` for palette roles resolved from `colorHarmony` by `computeTheme`. The roles are `white`, `gray`, `black`, `primary`, and `swatch1` through `swatch4`. Do not hand-author the eight palette colors. Switching base color or harmony retunes the whole palette.
- `SWATCH` for explicit color values.
- `FONT_FAMILY` for `fontFamily.primary` and `fontFamily.secondary`.
- `OPTION` for discrete option keys.
- `LOOK` for compound recipes under `font`, `border`, `gradient`, `shadow`, and `scrollbar`.

Look token `parameters` contain property-style tagged values. Resolving an `@<scope>.<key>` reference into CSS values is property-side work in `helpers/resolution`, not the themes module.

### Materialization

Use `computeTheme(stockTheme)` to normalize a full theme object and resolve dynamic swatches into a `ComputedTheme`.

Use `instantiateTheme(templateId, overrides, STOCK_THEMES_BY_ID)` to derive a theme from a stock template and overrides. Empty overrides skip the merge and compute the base theme.

Import `instantiateTheme`, `normalizeThemeInput`, `getDynamicSwatchColors`, `getPalette`, and colorspace helpers from `@seldon/core/themes/compute`. Import `computeTheme`, `normalizeTheme`, `THEMES_BY_ID`, `STOCK_THEMES_BY_ID`, and `defaultTheme` from `@seldon/core/themes`.

Workspace files store raw theme authoring state only. Computed theme rows come from read-side selectors such as `computeWorkspaceThemes` and `getComputedTheme`; they are not persisted.

The editor renders from the computed theme. Only the factory emits CSS variable swatch refs such as `--sdn-*` during export. Do not define theme tokens as CSS variables in core, and do not add editor logic that depends on those variables.

High Contrast is a computed color, not a stored theme token. Property-side resolution derives it from the effective background up the parent chain. A transparent or `NONE` background makes the resolver continue up.

### Adding Themes And Tokens

When adding a stock theme:

1. Add the id to `ThemeTemplateId` in `types/theme-id.ts`.
2. Create the stock file under `catalog/` with every section from `packages/core/themes/README.md`.
3. Register it in `catalog/index.ts` by adding the import and including it in `STOCK_THEMES`.
4. Do not edit token id unions unless adding reserved keys or sections.
