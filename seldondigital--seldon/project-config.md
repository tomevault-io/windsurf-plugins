## Seldon Properties

Properties define component appearance and behavior. They flow from catalog defaults through workspace overrides and theme tokens into computed values for rendering and export.

Use `packages/core/properties/README.md` as the canonical reference for property shapes, value types, categories, merge behavior, path rules, and adding property content.

### Property Shapes

Properties use three primary shapes:

- `atomic`: one stored value is one style decision, such as `color`, `gap`, `opacity`, or `display`.
- `compound`: related facets live under one property, such as `border.color`, `border.width`, `font.size`, or `board.width`.
- `shorthand`: one property controls parallel fields, such as `margin.top`, `padding.left`, or `corners.topLeft`.

Layered paint properties are stored as arrays of compound layers:

- `background[]`
- `shadow[]`

Layer index `0` is topmost. Treat these as ordered stacks. Do not model them as single compound objects. Gradients are not a separate node stack. A gradient paints through a `background[]` layer with `kind: gradient`.

### Value Types

Use the current `ValueType` set:

- `EMPTY` for unset values.
- `INHERIT` for explicit parent inheritance.
- `EXACT` for concrete values.
- `OPTION` for fixed choices.
- `COMPUTED` for values derived from other properties.
- `THEME_CATEGORICAL` for named theme token sets, such as `@swatch.*` and `@font.*`.
- `THEME_ORDINAL` for ordered theme scales, such as `@fontSize.*`, `@margin.*`, and `@borderWidth.*`.

Do not use `PRESET` as a value type. Preset-like choices use `ValueType.OPTION`, or theme references such as `@border.hairline`, `@font.body`, and `@gradient.primary` where the property supports them.

### EMPTY, INHERIT, And None

- `EMPTY` means unset. It resolves to the platform or default value. Author it as `{ type: ValueType.EMPTY, value: null }`.
- Prefer `EMPTY` over `INHERIT` when both produce the same result. Use `INHERIT` only when a property must take the parent value on purpose.
- `None` is an explicit choice, not the same as `EMPTY`. Author it with `ValueType.OPTION` and a `*.NONE` value, such as `Gap.NONE`.
- `None` means an explicit absence the user selected. `EMPTY` means the value is unset and falls back to a default. Do not conflate them.
- For default layered paint, prefer a cleared look such as `@shadow.none` or `@border.none` over a bare `preset: EMPTY` where the property supports it.

### Theme References Over Literals

- Prefer `@token` references and variant styles over hardcoded literals for color, spacing, corners, and shadows.
- Author theme references with a single prefix, such as `@fontSize.xxlarge`. Never double the prefix, such as `@fontSize.@fontSize.xxlarge`.

### Categories And Ordering

Use `PROPERTY_DISPLAY_ORDER` and `properties/constants/property-display.ts` for category order:

1. Attributes
2. Layout
3. Appearance
4. Typography
5. Effects
6. Accessibility

Accessibility properties (`role`, `aria*`) come last, after effects. Behavior, motion, and data sections are documented as future areas. Do not treat them as implemented property surfaces unless code support exists.

### Property Vocabulary And Visibility

- A property absent from a schema is not part of that component's vocabulary. It cannot be set or overridden.
- When a control is missing in the editor, confirm the schema exposes the property, set to `EMPTY`. Do not add editor-only property logic.
- Change property order through `PROPERTY_DISPLAY_ORDER` in core so the editor picks it up. Do not reorder in the editor.

### Compound And Layer Behavior

Compound presets copy theme look parameters onto the compound. Applying a preset overwrites every parameter the preset defines. Any parameter not mentioned by the preset is set to `EMPTY`.

If a user changes a compound sub-field by hand, treat the compound as custom until it matches a named preset again.

For layered paint, merge by layer slot when `mergeSubProperties` is enabled. Preserve ordering and treat missing layer facets like missing compound facets.

### Merge And Serialization

Use `mergeProperties(base, patch, options)` for two property snapshots. Pass the earlier or broader source first and the newer or narrower source second. Chain calls when combining defaults, variants, and instances.

Workspace files store raw authoring state only. Node entries persist `template` and `overrides`. Effective merged properties and `ValueType.COMPUTED` results come from read-side compute selectors and are not persisted back into the workspace file.

### Paths And References

Authoritative property key unions live in `types/property-keys.ts`. They cover top-level keys, compound facet names, shorthand sides, and the layered paint keys `background` and `shadow`.

Runtime lookup paths used by `findInObject` are dot-separated, such as `background.0.color`. Schemas do not author computed source paths. Each compute function derives its own source. `getBasedOnValue` resolves an explicit path such as `#self.background.color` or `#parent.buttonSize`, and normalizes schema-style layered paint paths to layer `0` lookup paths.

Theme references are validated by restricted theme key unions where properties opt in. Use `@` token paths that match the property type.
