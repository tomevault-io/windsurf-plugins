## Seldon Components

Components are catalog schemas, not workspace state. A schema declares identity, hierarchy level, default `Properties`, and optional composition trees. Workspaces own variants, instances, user edits, ids, and runtime state.

Use `packages/core/components/README.md` for schema shapes, hierarchy, composition, and child-tree rules.

Use `packages/core/properties/README.md` for property shapes, value types, theme references, and property ordering.

### Hierarchy

- `screen` may contain anything.
- `module` may contain modules, parts, elements, primitives, and frames.
- `part` may contain parts, elements, primitives, and frames.
- `element` may contain elements, primitives, and frames.
- `primitive` has no `default`, `variants`, or children.
- `frame` is the cross-level container and may appear anywhere.
- Choose the level by what the component composes, not by its name. A container of parts is a module or part. A leaf with no children is a primitive.

### Schema Shapes

All schemas share `id`, `name`, `intent`, `icon`, `tags`, and `properties`.

Schemas may set an optional `layout` meta of type `ComponentLayout`. When absent it means `FLEXBOX`. Set `layout: ComponentLayout.GRID` to make the component a CSS grid container, which scopes its LAYOUT properties to the grid vocabulary (columns, rows, item placement) instead of the flexbox vocabulary (orientation, wrapChildren).

Primitives use `level: ComponentLevel.PRIMITIVE` and stop there.

Complex schemas use `default: { children: [...] }` for the canonical tree and may use `variants: [...]` for alternate trees. A variant may also define root `overrides`. Composition trees should be fully flattened. Keep intermediate schemas only when they are reusable across multiple parents.

Author schemas with `as const satisfies ComponentSchema` so TypeScript validates the shape while preserving literal property and option values.

### Schema Files And Folders

- Use one schema file per component family. Name it `X.schema.ts` after the family default.
- Put the default tree in `default` and alternate trees in `variants`. Do not keep a separate file per variant.
- When consolidating, move each old variant schema into the family file as a variant, then delete the old file.
- Place schema files directly at the root of their level folder, such as `elements/` or `parts/`. Use a subfolder only for a genuine grouping, such as `tables/` or `cards/`.
- Use `Button.schema.ts` as the reference for a family with multiple variants.

### Properties

Schema properties use the same shapes as the properties system:

- atomic values use `{ type: ValueType, value: ... }`
- compound values are objects of tagged sub-values
- shorthand values are objects of tagged side or corner values
- layered paint values are arrays of compound layers

Properties absent from a schema are not part of that component's vocabulary and cannot be set or overridden for that component.

Use these value types in schemas:

- `EMPTY` for exposed but unset properties.
- `INHERIT` to take the parent value.
- `EXACT` for literals.
- `OPTION` for fixed enum-style choices.
- `THEME_CATEGORICAL` for named token sets like swatches and font families.
- `THEME_ORDINAL` for ordered token scales like sizes and spacing.
- `COMPUTED` for values resolved from another property at compute time.

Follow property ordering from `PROPERTY_DISPLAY_ORDER`: attributes, layout, appearance, typography, effects, accessibility. Accessibility properties (`role`, `aria*`) come last, after effects. Within compounds, follow the facet order in `packages/core/properties/README.md`.

### Children And Overrides

Complex schemas declare children inside `default.children` and optional `variants[i].children`. Each child entry is a `SchemaChild` record.

```typescript
default: {
  children: [
    {
      component: Seldon.ComponentId.BUTTON,
      overrides: {
        buttonSize: {
          type: Sdn.ValueType.THEME_ORDINAL,
          value: "@fontSize.medium",
        },
      },
      children: [
        {
          component: Seldon.ComponentId.TEXT,
          variant: "label",
          overrides: {
            content: { type: Sdn.ValueType.EXACT, value: "Add" },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
},
variants: [
  {
    id: "secondary",
    label: "Secondary",
    intent: "Alternate button for a lower-emphasis action.",
    children: [
      {
        component: Seldon.ComponentId.BUTTON,
        children: [
          {
            component: Seldon.ComponentId.TEXT,
            variant: "label",
            overrides: {
              content: { type: Sdn.ValueType.EXACT, value: "Cancel" },
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
],
```

Use `overrides` in component schemas. Overrides must use full typed property values and are matched against the target child schema. Unknown override keys are dropped by merge logic. Do not invent child properties that the referenced schema does not expose.
