## Seldon Testing

Vitest is the test runner for the repo. The project moved fully off `bun test`. Do not import from `bun:test`.

### Running Tests

- Run all tests from the repo root with `npm test`.
- Watch mode is `npm run test:watch`. Coverage is `npm run coverage`.
- A single package runs through its own script, such as `npm test --workspace @seldon/core`.
- Coverage is enabled for `core` and `factory`. The editor has no Vitest setup yet.

### Test Files

- Co-locate a test next to its source as `X.test.ts`.
- Use explicit imports: `import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest"`. Globals are off.
- Batch trivial type guards from one folder into a single spec.

### No Shared Fixtures

Do not add a shared fixture module or golden JSON files. Hand-maintained copies of workspace, theme, or property shapes drift when `core` changes. Use one of three scoped patterns instead.

1. Pure functions: build inputs as inline literals inside each test. Do not construct a `Workspace`.
2. Behavior over real state: build inputs through the real `core` API at the top of the test so inputs track `core` automatically. Use `createEmptyWorkspace()`, then `addComponent` and `addVariant`. Resolve schemas with `getComponentSchema(id)`. Use stock themes from `STOCK_THEMES_BY_ID` or `THEMES_BY_ID`.
3. Narrow config or gate tests: a small inline node literal kept local to the test is fine. The rules contract test follows this pattern.

If a snapshot is ever justified, use a small `toMatchInlineSnapshot`. Never write a file snapshot.

### Resolution Note

The package Vitest configs alias `@seldon/core` to the package source. Node-style package exports do not resolve directory-index files such as `components/catalog/index.ts`, so the alias is required for subpath imports to load in tests.

### Adding Tests Is Opt-In

Follow `engineering.mdc`. Do not add or update tests unless the task explicitly asks for it.
