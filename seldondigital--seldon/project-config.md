## Seldon Workspace

Workspaces are serialized design files. They store catalog rows, node entries, theme entries, and resource entries as flat maps. Runtime reducers and services may use helper shapes, but `packages/core/workspace/README.md` is the canonical reference for the saved JSON format.

Use `packages/core/workspace/README.md` as the source for field names, id patterns, referential integrity, and migration behavior.

### Top-Level Shape

Serialized workspaces use these top-level keys in this order:

1. `metadata`
2. `boards`
3. `nodes`
4. `themes`
5. `font-collections`
6. `icon-sets`
7. `media`

`boards` is the catalog row index. It does not hold node properties directly. Rows point to entries in `nodes`, `themes`, `font-collections`, `icon-sets`, or `media`.

### Mutations Through Actions

- Change a workspace only through workspace actions and reducer handlers. Do not mutate workspace state with editor-only logic.
- The editor fires actions. An AI agent fires the same actions. Any new mutation must be available as an action so both paths reach it.
- Validation middleware rejects an invalid action and returns the workspace unchanged. Verification middleware checks invariants after every action.
- Persist edits as actions and `overrides`. Do not store design state as editor side state.

### Mutation Policy By Entity

- Operation reach depends on the target entity: board, default variant, user variant, or instance. Read the policy from `packages/core/rules/config/rules.config.ts`.
- `Local` changes only the target. `Syncs` also applies to linked instances. `Blocked` is a no-op.
- Default variants are locked against structural change. They accept `setProperties` and `setTheme`, but not create, insert, delete, rename, reorder, or move at index `0`.
- Reset drops overrides so the value falls back to its template. `setProperties` and `reset` stay `Local`.
- Deleting a `schema` instance inside the default variant hides it with `display: EXCLUDE`. Every other instance deletes, including `schema` instances in user variants.

### Parallel Entry Handling

- Handle component, theme, font-collection, icon-set, and media entries with parallel reducer logic.
- When you fix or add behavior for one entry type, apply it to the others that share the pattern. Do not fix one type in isolation.

### Catalog Rows

`boards` rows may have these `type` values:

- `component`
- `playground`
- `theme`
- `font-collection`
- `icon-set`
- `media`

Component and playground rows reference `nodes`. Theme rows reference `themes`. Resource rows reference their matching resource map.

The first item in every row's `variants` list is the default variant. Default rows must stay aligned with the catalog. Change the shipped default through `overrides`, not by changing default structure.

### Nodes

`nodes` is a flat map for component and playground nodes only. It does not store themes, icon sets, font collections, or media.

Node entries use:

- `type`: `"default"`, `"variant"`, or `"instance"`
- `template`: `catalog:{ComponentId}` or `node:{nodeId}`
- `overrides`: property values layered over the template
- `theme`: a theme entry id string or `null`

Default nodes use `template: catalog:{ComponentId}`. Variant and instance nodes may use `template: node:{nodeId}`. Instance nodes may also use `template: catalog:{ComponentId}` when they point straight to a catalog schema.

Only write property keys in `overrides` when the referenced template exposes those properties. Unknown override keys are ignored by merge logic.

### Themes

`themes` is a flat map for theme entries.

Theme entries use:

- `type`: `"default"` or `"variant"`
- `template`: `catalog:{ThemeTemplateId}` or `theme:{themeId}`
- `overrides`: token values layered over the template

Default themes use `template: catalog:{ThemeTemplateId}`. Variant themes use `template: theme:{themeId}`.

### Integrity Rules

When editing workspace code or docs:

- Keep catalog row `variants` references in the map required by the row `type`.
- Use `children` only for `component` and `playground` row trees.
- Keep theme, font collection, icon set, and media `variants` entries as `{ "id" }` only.
- Keep template references in `{prefix}:{suffix}` form.
- Reject template prefixes that are not valid for the entry type.
- Keep component and playground child graphs acyclic.
- Keep theme template graphs acyclic.
- Keep top-level map keys unique.
- Resolve every id in `variants` and nested `children` to a key in the map for the board `type`: `component` and `playground` to `nodes`, `theme` to `themes`, `font-collection` to `font-collections`, `icon-set` to `icon-sets`, `media` to `media`.
- Resolve every `template` suffix to a key in the map implied by its prefix.
- After a delete, remove or repoint references so no id dangles. Remove node rows that reference nothing.

### Naming And Migration

Use camelCase catalog ids and component keys. Use id patterns from `packages/core/workspace/README.md`, such as `component-{componentKey}-{suffix}`, `playground-{componentKey}-{suffix}`, and `theme-{componentKey}-{suffix}`.

`metadata.version` is the migration counter. It is separate from the file format specification version. The migration middleware lives in `packages/core/workspace/middleware/migration/middleware.ts`. The v0 baseline ships no migration steps.
