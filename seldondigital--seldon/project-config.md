## Editor JSX Authoring

Important: This is a hard rule. No exceptions. Resolve every JSX value before the `return`. Returned JSX holds element tags and identifier references only. Nothing is computed inside returned JSX.

A helper or function call inside a JSX prop is a violation, even a short one. `comboboxField={buildFieldStateProps({ selected })}` is wrong. Hoist it: `const comboboxField = buildFieldStateProps({ selected })`, then `comboboxField={comboboxField}`.

- Do not write expressions inside returned JSX. This covers ternaries, `&&`, `||`, comparisons, computed objects or arrays, inline `style` objects, function calls that build a value, template literals, and inline arrow or function handlers.
- Hoist each value into a named `const`, `useCallback`, or `useMemo` above the `return`.
- A conditional element tree becomes a named constant. Write `const childrenSection = hasChildren ? <Children /> : null`, then render `{childrenSection}`.
- Resolve lists before the `return`. Precompute the array into a `const`, or extract a child component. A `.map` callback passes identifier or item-field props only, and computes nothing inline.
- Event handlers are named functions or `useCallback` values. Do not define an arrow handler inside a JSX prop.

Bare literal slot enablers stay inline. A positional `{}`, `null`, or `undefined` that turns a generated slot on or off carries no logic, so it does not need a name.
