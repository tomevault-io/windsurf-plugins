## Engineering Guidance

Use the local code first. Follow nearby patterns, public APIs, and domain rules before adding a new abstraction.

### TypeScript

- Prefer named exports and pure functions for shared TypeScript modules.
- Use classes only when matching existing code or when stateful encapsulation is justified.
- Use descriptive names. Do not force auxiliary verbs on every variable.
- Avoid `any` in production code unless the boundary is unknown data, migration, legacy compatibility, or a narrow type escape.
- Allow enums where they are already part of the public or serialized API. Do not apply a blanket `avoid enums` rule.
- All comments should be about current behavior, not legacy, deprecated, past behavior, or anything that is not relevant going forward. 
- Do not add comments that are obvious or referential to markdown files. 
- Add JSDocs as needed.
- In `*.schema.ts` files, inline every property and `overrides` object literal at its child. Do not hoist shared schema values into a module `const` and reuse it. The only module-level values are the `schema` export and its `exportConfig`. See `.cursor/rules/components.mdc`.

### Naming

- Match the local filename convention of the area you are editing.
- Most general TypeScript modules use lowercase kebab-case, such as `set-node-properties.ts`.
- Component schema files use `PascalCase.schema.ts`.
- Service and helper modules keep their existing suffix-based names, such as `theme.service.ts` and `workspace-mutation.helper.ts`.
- Match exported reducer handler names to their file names in camelCase verb+noun form, such as `set-node-properties.ts` -> `setNodeProperties`.
- Group workspace reducer handlers by action verb, such as `add/`, `remove/`, `set/`, `reset/`, `insert/`, `move/`, `reorder/`, and `duplicate/`. Use support folders such as `shared/`, `normalize/`, and `stubs/` only when the file is not a direct action handler and matches the existing structure.
- Avoid `handle*` prefixes for reducer handlers unless nearby code already uses that pattern.

### Change Scope

- Keep edits scoped to the requested behavior.
- Avoid unrelated refactors, formatting churn, and metadata changes.
- Add abstractions only when they reduce real duplication or match an established local pattern.

### Package Boundaries

- Put behavior and data in `core`. The editor consumes `core` and must not special-case or re-implement core logic.
- Keep export concerns in the `factory`. CSS variable refs and language-specific output belong to factory export, not to `core` or the editor.
- When a value or ordering looks wrong in the editor, fix it in `core` so every consumer gets the same result. Do not patch it in the editor.
- Persist user edits as workspace actions and reducers. Do not store design state as editor-only side state.

### Consistency Over Special Cases

- Follow existing patterns. A new case should behave the same way as its siblings. A new compound property behaves like other compound properties.
- Do not add special code or special casing when a general pattern already exists.
- Prefer the simplest change that fits the existing model. Do not over-complicate a fix.

### Tests And Migrations

- Do not add or update tests unless explicitly asked.
- Do not add or update migrations unless explicitly asked.

### Debugging And Regressions

- When something that worked breaks, first find the specific recent change that caused it. Prefer the smallest targeted fix over a broad refactor.
- Do not keep code that breaks existing behavior. If a change regresses atomic, shorthand, or compound behavior, revert that part.
- Do not spiral into deep rewrites for a small regression.

### Verification

- After changes, run `tsc` across the whole repo and resolve all type errors before reporting done.
- Keep all imports valid and remove dead or redundant code touched by the change.

### Workflow

- Analyze and report a plan before editing. Wait for approval before making file changes.

### Version Control

- Run inspection commands freely, such as `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, and `git stash`.
- Never run a command that changes the working tree, switches or edits a branch, or opens a PR without asking first. This covers `git commit`, `git push`, `git reset`, `git restore`, `git checkout`, `git switch`, `git branch`, `git merge`, `git rebase`, and `gh pr create`.

### Framework Guidance

Keep React, Next.js, Web Vitals, image, and URL-state guidance out of this global rule. App-code framework rules live in file-scoped rules.

### JSX Authoring (Always Enforced)

Important: When you edit any `.tsx` file under `packages/editor/`, you MUST follow `.cursor/rules/editor-jsx.mdc`. The core rule, repeated here so it is always in scope:

- Returned JSX holds element tags and identifier references only. Compute nothing inside the returned JSX.
- No expressions in returned JSX. This covers ternaries, `&&`, `||`, comparisons, computed objects or arrays, inline `style` objects, template literals, inline arrow or function handlers, and helper or function calls that build a value, such as `comboboxField={buildFieldStateProps({ selected })}`.
