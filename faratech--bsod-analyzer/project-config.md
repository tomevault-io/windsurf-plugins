**Project Overview**

The BSOD AI Analyzer is an enterprise-grade application designed to diagnose Windows crash dump errors using Google's Gemini AI. It features a secure client-server architecture, with a React frontend for user interaction and a Fastify backend that proxies sensitive Gemini API calls. The application supports various crash dump formats, provides detailed analysis reports, and integrates advanced debugging capabilities. A key aspect of its design is robust security, including server-side API key protection and in-memory processing of crash dumps to ensure no sensitive data is stored.

**Building and Running**

This project uses Node.js and npm for dependency management and script execution.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Node.js 22+
*   npm 11
*   Google Cloud account (for deployment)
*   Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

**Local Development:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/faratech/bsod-analyzer.git
    cd bsod-analyzer
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your Gemini API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
    ```
    For additional secrets like `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` and `SESSION_SECRET`, you can add them to `.env.local` or set them as environment variables directly.

4.  **Start development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command concurrently starts both the backend (on port 8080) and the frontend development server.

**Development Commands:**
*   `npm run dev`: Starts both backend and frontend servers.
*   `npm run dev:backend`: Starts the backend server only.
*   `npm run dev:frontend`: Starts the frontend development server only.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the production-ready frontend and adds SRI hashes.
*   `npm test`: Runs the Node test suite.
*   `npm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript checks without emitting files.
*   `npm run check`: Runs tests, typecheck, production build, and SRI generation.
*   `npm start`: Runs the production server.

**Deployment:**

The application can be deployed to Google Cloud Run. The `README.md` provides detailed instructions for quick deployment using `deploy-with-secret.sh` script, manual deployment via Docker and gcloud CLI, and CI/CD setup with Cloud Build.

**Development Conventions**

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite
    *   **Backend:** Fastify with ES modules
    *   **AI Service:** Google Gemini via `@google/genai` SDK with server-owned JSON response schemas
    *   **Styling:** Custom CSS
    *   **Deployment:** Docker, Google Cloud Run, Secret Manager
*   **Secret Management:**
    *   **Production:** All secrets (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `WINDBG_API_KEY`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`) are stored in Google Secret Manager and injected as environment variables by Cloud Run.
    *   **Local Development:** Secrets are managed via `.env.local` files or direct environment variables. The `.env.local` file is git-ignored and should never be committed.
    *   Dedicated scripts (`setup-all-secrets.sh`, `update-turnstile-secret.sh`, `deploy-with-secret.sh`) are provided for secret management.
*   **Security Best Practices:**
    *   Never commit secrets to the repository.
    *   Regularly rotate secrets.
    *   Utilize Secret Manager for production environments.
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege for secret access.
*   **Code Structure:**
    *   Frontend components are located in the `components/` and `pages/` directories.
    *   Backend logic is primarily in `server.js` and `services/`.
    *   Utility functions are in the `utils/` directory.
*   **Testing:** Use `npm run check` before shipping. It runs the Node test suite, TypeScript checks, production build, and SRI generation.
