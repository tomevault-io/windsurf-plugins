# calibr — repository operating guide

This is the source of truth for work in this repository. Historical material
under `architecture/design`, `architecture/ux`, `spec`, `plans`, `memories`,
and `ROADMAP.md` is useful context but does not override this file.

## Product state

calibr is an installable Node.js + Ink CLI. The primary user journey is
`guided run`: choose llama.cpp, choose local or catalog models, select scope
and policies, run the benchmark, and inspect the results/report.

The migration from the original PowerShell application is well advanced:

- TypeScript owns the interactive CLI, guided-run policy, llama-server
  lifecycle on the CUDA path, repeated-run coordination, HTTP benchmark
  sequence, streaming telemetry, metric derivation, result aggregation, and
  CLI result views.
- PowerShell remains the portable engine adapter and fallback. It owns
  configuration/platform probes, model discovery, sweep expansion, catalog
  download/rotation, report file emission, non-CUDA fallback paths, and the raw
  maintenance interface.
- `engine/workflow.ps1` is the unified raw workflow invoked by guided run.
  `discover.ps1`, `plan.ps1`, `bench.ps1`, and `report.ps1` are internal stage
  modules with separate artifacts; they are not the primary UX.

Do not describe the product as a set of four commands. The raw commands exist
for maintainers, diagnostics, CI, and resumable/headless work.

## Operating principles

- Keep process minimal. No spec/plan ceremony unless it helps the task.
- Prefer the smallest complete implementation and verify it proportionally.
- Update `README.md` for user-visible behavior, `METRICS.md` for metric
  semantics, and `HOW-IT-WORKS.md` for architecture/runtime changes.
- Preserve user changes in a dirty worktree. Do not reset or overwrite them.
- Add cheap tests for real regressions.
- Breaking changes are acceptable during this phase; explain them in commits.
- Do not create migration shims for hypothetical users.

## Measurement and methodology decisions

Benchmark methodology is product behavior, not an implementation detail.
Before implementing a change that can alter what a metric means, how a
workload is constructed, or how results are compared, stop and obtain explicit
maintainer approval.

This includes:

- prompt, prefill, KV-fill, warm-up, cache reuse, and token-count construction;
- measurement clocks, sampling, aggregation, thresholds, and failure
  classification;
- sweep progression, pruning, rescue behavior, and winner eligibility;
- defaults that trade accuracy, quality, runtime, memory, or reproducibility.

Present a compact decision brief containing:

1. what is being measured and why;
2. the viable implementation choices;
3. the recommended choice and rationale;
4. how each choice changes metric meaning, comparability, or limitations;
5. assumptions and values that will be recorded in results.

Do not hide methodological choices to reduce interaction or cognitive load.
Keep the explanation concise, but ensure the maintainer understands the
mechanism before approving it.

A decision is methodological when two technically valid implementations could
produce numbers with different meanings. Refactors that preserve workload,
formulas, provenance, and interpretation remain routine.

## Architecture direction

Current phase: ship and harden the TypeScript CLI.

Later phases are conditional, not scheduled:

1. a local HTTP/backend boundary when multiple clients justify it;
2. a web UI only after that API exists and has a demonstrated need.

Do not scaffold NestJS or Angular ahead of those decisions. Continue moving
PowerShell responsibilities only when there is a concrete product,
cross-platform, testability, or performance reason.

## Vocabulary

`architecture/domain.md` is authoritative. Use `lineage`, `series`, `model`,
`variant`, `run config`, `sweep`, `level`, `winner`, `backend`, `WDDM`,
`saturation`, and `headroom`. Do not reintroduce `family`, `quant`, or the old
A/B/C tier terminology.

## Branch flow

- Normal work starts from `dev`.
- Feature branches merge into `dev`.
- `dev` is promoted to `master` for release.
- Hotfixes on `master` must be merged back into `dev`.

## Check in with the maintainer for

- new top-level dependencies;
- schema/public-interface breaks with lasting consequences;
- language/framework changes or a new engine adapter;
- a phase transition;
- benchmark or telemetry methodology changes, including implicit workload
  construction;
- changes to metric semantics, comparability, aggregation, thresholds,
  pruning, rescue, or winner policy;
- work likely to exceed half a day.

Routine implementation and consistency decisions do not need a check-in.
