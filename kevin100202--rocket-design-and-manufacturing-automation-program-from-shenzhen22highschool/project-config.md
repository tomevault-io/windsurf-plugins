# AGENTS.MD

Telegraph style. Root rules only. Read scoped `AGENTS.md` before subtree work.
Skills own workflows; root owns hard policy and routing.

## Start

- Repo: `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw`
- Replies: repo-root refs only: `extensions/telegram/src/index.ts:80`. No absolute paths, no `~/`.
- Docs/user-visible work: `pnpm docs:list`, then read relevant docs only.
- Fix/triage answers need source, tests, current/shipped behavior, and dependency contract proof.
- Dependency-backed behavior: read upstream docs/source/types first. No API/default/error/timing guesses.
- Live-verify when feasible. Never print secrets.
- Missing deps: `pnpm install`, retry once, then report first actionable error.
- CODEOWNERS: maint/refactor/tests ok. Larger behavior/product/security/ownership: owner ask/review.
- Product/docs/UI/changelog wording: "plugin/plugins"; `extensions/` is internal.
- New channel/plugin/app/doc surface: update `.github/labeler.yml` + GH labels.
- New `AGENTS.md`: add sibling `CLAUDE.md` symlink; edit `AGENTS.md` only.

## ClawSweeper Review Policy

- OpenClaw-specific review rules live here; generic ClawSweeper prompts stay repo-agnostic.
- ClawSweeper-owned schema, labels, close reasons, protected-label gates, maintainer-item gates, and mutation rules live in `openclaw/clawsweeper`.
- Review workers read this full root `AGENTS.md` before judging; no reliance on search snippets, `head`, partial ranges, local excerpts, or truncated copies. Then read every scoped `AGENTS.md` that owns touched paths.
- Optional integrations, providers, channels, skill bundles, MCP surfaces, and service workflows route to plugins, ClawHub, or owner repos when current seams suffice. Keep core items for missing core/plugin APIs, bundled regressions, security/core hardening, or maintainer product decisions.
- Plugin APIs, provider routing, auth/session state, persisted preferences, config loading, config/default additions, migrations, setup, startup checks, and fallback behavior are compatibility/upgrade-sensitive. Treat config breaks, new config/default surfaces, removed fallbacks, fail-closed changes, stricter validation, or new operator action as merge risk even with green CI when they can affect existing users, upgrades, provider/plugin behavior, or maintainer operations.
- For PRs that add, remove, or change config/default surfaces with possible compatibility, upgrade, provider/plugin, operator, setup, startup, or fallback impact, ClawSweeper review should emit a `reviewMetrics` entry when practical. The metric should name the count and direction of the changes, such as added, changed, or removed config/default surfaces, and explain why the metric matters before merge. When the metric indicates concrete merge risk, also surface the concern in `risks`, use `mergeRiskLabels` when the risk matches the label rubric, make `bestSolution` name the desired pre-merge state, and ensure `labelJustifications` explain the specific reason rather than restating the label.
- Review whole decision surfaces, not only the touched runtime, provider, channel, harness, plugin seam, or context path. Check sibling Codex/Pi-style runtimes, provider/model routing, channel delivery, gateway/protocol, plugin SDK, and context-management paths when relevant.
- One-sided fixes need sibling-surface proof, an explanation for why siblings are unaffected, or explicit follow-up work.
- Changelog findings: see Docs / Changelog.
- Public ClawSweeper comments prefer `https://docs.openclaw.ai/...` when a public docs page exists; structured evidence still cites repo files, lines, SHAs.
- Findings need current source, shipped/current behavior, tests/CI evidence, and dependency contract proof when dependency-backed behavior is involved. Validation is judged against touched and sibling surfaces plus this file's commands; real behavior proof matters for user-visible changes, with Telegram/Desktop proof for Telegram-visible behavior when feasible.
- Prefer findings for concrete behavior regressions, missing changed-surface proof, owner-boundary violations, security/API contract issues, or docs/config mismatches.
- Do not file findings for repo policy preference when changed code follows the relevant scoped guide and no user-visible, runtime, security, or maintainer-risk impact is shown.

## Map

- Core TS: `src/`, `ui/`, `packages/`; plugins: `extensions/`; SDK: `src/plugin-sdk/*`; channels: `src/channels/*`; loader: `src/plugins/*`; protocol: `packages/gateway-protocol/*`; docs/apps: `docs/`, `apps/`.
- Installers: sibling `../openclaw.ai`.
- Scoped guides: `extensions/`, `src/{plugin-sdk,channels,plugins,gateway,agents}/`, `packages/`, `test/helpers*/`, `docs/`, `ui/`, `scripts/`.

## Docs

- Source docs: `docs/**`; publish repo: `openclaw/docs`; host: `https://docs.openclaw.ai`.
- Flow: source -> `docs-sync-publish.yml` -> mirror build -> R2 -> Worker router.
- Docs AI: `openclaw/ask-molty`; see its `AGENTS.md`.

## Architecture

- Core stays plugin-agnostic. No bundled ids/defaults/policy in core when manifest/registry/capability contracts work.
- Plugins cross into core only via `openclaw/plugin-sdk/*`, manifest metadata, injected runtime helpers, documented barrels (`api.ts`, `runtime-api.ts`).
