# Brain OS Plugin

Claude Code plugin for managing a second brain powered by Obsidian. 16 skills across Learn, Think, and Act.

## Key Paths

- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — Skill logic (+ optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `evals/`)
- `hooks/hooks.json` — Plugin hooks (auto-registered on install)
- `evals/smart-diff-check.sh` — PostToolUse hook: validates SKILL.md changes
- `brain-os.config.md` — User config (vault_path)
- `install.sh` — Unified installer

## Key Conventions

- **Skills are pointers, not containers.** Skills read from the vault at runtime via `brain-os.config.md` → `vault_path`. Never hardcode knowledge in skills.
- **SKILL.md is the skill.** Each skill's logic lives in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Complex skills also have `scripts/` and `references/`.
- **Vault structure matters.** All skills expect the vault layout defined in `setup-vault.sh`. Zones: context/, business/, personal/, thinking/, knowledge/, daily/, private/.
- **Config path:** `~/.brain-os/brain-os.config.md` (remote install) or `./brain-os.config.md` (local).

## Development

```bash
# Local install (symlinks skills to ~/.claude/skills/)
./install.sh

# Install with force (replace existing symlinks)
./install.sh --force

# Test a specific skill's evals
/eval self-learn

# Run gmail scripts
npm run gmail:clean
npm run gmail:bootstrap
```

## Skill Categories

| Category | Skills | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Learn** | study, self-learn, verify, ingest, absorb, research | self-learn/verify need Python 3.12+ and notebooklm-py |
| **Think** | think, grill, audit | /think subsumes old emerge/challenge/drift/connect/trace/ghost; /audit = one-shot principle check via advisor |
| **Act** | status, aha, journal, handover, pickup, gmail, gmail-bootstrap, triggers, eval | gmail needs Node deps + OAuth setup |

## Hooks

Plugin hooks live in `hooks/hooks.json` and are auto-registered on install:
- **SessionStart**: shows open tasks from vault kanban
- **PostToolUse** (Edit|Write): validates SKILL.md changes via smart-diff-check
- **SessionEnd**: auto-commits vault changes, captures session summary, archives done tasks

## Editing Rules

- Plugin editing + auto commit/push rules: see `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (canonical)
- When editing SKILL.md: the PostToolUse hook will validate. If it blocks, review what was removed.
- ALL_SKILLS arrays in `install.sh` and `skills.sh` must stay in sync
