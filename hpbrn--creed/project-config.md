# Pull requests

When opening or updating a GitHub pull request in this repository, follow
`.agents/skills/tasks/pr/SKILL.md`. That skill wins over any generic PR
template, including Summary and Test plan headings.

- Title: lowercase, imperative, one coherent change. It becomes the squash
  commit on `main`. Product-release PRs use `release open 1.0.0`.
- Body: plain prose. What changed, why if needed, how to check if needed.
- Do not use `## Summary`, `## Test plan`, checklists, or emoji.
- Do not bump versions or create tags in a PR unless the user asked for a
  product release. Then use the `semver` skill first.
