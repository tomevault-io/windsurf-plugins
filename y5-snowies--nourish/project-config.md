# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

It is written to describe **conventions and discovery commands**, not fixed file lists or
directory names, so it stays correct as crates and workspaces are added or renamed. When you
need a concrete name or path, run the discovery command shown rather than trusting a hard-coded
value.

## What this is

`y5` is a Wayland compositor written in Rust. It is built on **vendored** forks of
`smithay` (Wayland), `bevy` + `wgpu` + `naga_oil` (rendering) and `iced` + `cryoglyph`
(UI), all under `vendor/` and patched in-tree.

The shipped binary is **`y5_compositor`** — the crate that declares it via `[[bin]]` is the
compositor's entry point. Locate it without assuming the path:

```bash
# crate dir that produces the y5_compositor binary
dirname "$(grep -rl --include=Cargo.toml 'name = "y5_compositor"' compositor*)"
```

Toolchain is **stable** (`rust-toolchain.toml` at the repo root); crates use Rust edition 2024
(stable since 1.85), so a current stable toolchain builds the tree. There are no nightly-only
language features in use.

## Multi-workspace architecture (read this first)

The repo is NOT a single Cargo workspace. It is a set of **independent top-level Cargo
workspaces** that share crates by path. Each workspace is a top-level `compositor*/` directory:

```bash
ls -d compositor*/        # the current set of workspaces
```

Top-level `compositor*` dirs are either workspace roots or **containers** of workspace
roots (see `document/ARCHITECTURE.md`): `compositor.orchestration/` (the driving layer),
`compositor.support/` (system core, smithay dispatch, shared libs),
`compositor.expansion/` (integral expansions: `compositor.y5` — the stock experience —
plus `compositor.remote`, `compositor.background`), `compositor.extension/` (add-only:
`compositor.monitor`), and `compositor.kernel/` (the hardware layer: one root per domain
— `kernel.vulkan`, `kernel.drm`, ... — plus `kernel.loader`, which holds the
`y5_compositor` `[[bin]]`). Don't rely on this list being exhaustive — `ls -d
compositor*/` is the source of truth.

These workspaces depend on each other's crates via **generated** `[path]` dependencies, not by
being members of one workspace. The wiring is mechanical:

- Each workspace dir has a `link.json` listing the other workspaces it consumes.
- `workspace.link.js` reads a workspace's `link.json`, discovers every crate in those input
  workspaces (manual `Cargo.toml` parsing), and rewrites a
  `# --- GENERATED WORKSPACE LINKS START/END ---` block in that workspace's root `Cargo.toml`
  with `crate = { path = "..." }` entries.
- `./link.all.sh` runs `workspace.link.js` in every top-level workspace.

**Consequence:** after adding, removing, or renaming any crate or workspace, you MUST run
`./link.all.sh` from the repo root, or the cross-workspace path links go stale and downstream
workspaces fail to resolve the crate. Do not hand-edit the GENERATED block.

## Crate / directory naming convention

Crates live exactly two levels below a workspace root, with a strict **chain-prefix** naming
scheme enforced by the workspace member globs (e.g. `compositor.action/*/*`):

```
compositor.expansion/        container (organizational only for compositor.<x> roots)
  compositor.y5/             workspace root        (root_tail = "y5")
    y5.action/               L0  = <tail>.<seg>
      action.camera/         L1  = <seg>.<sub>
        camera.find/         L2  = the crate dir (<sub>.<name>)
```

The crate's package name is the dotted chain with dots → `_`. Roots named
`compositor.<x>` start the chain fresh (`compositor_y5_action_camera_find`); other roots
merge through their container (`compositor.support/support.smithay` →
`compositor_support_smithay_*`, `compositor.kernel/kernel.vulkan` →
`compositor_kernel_vulkan_*`). There is no `y5_` package prefix anywhere;
`workspace.lint.js` (run by `link.all.sh`, `environment/build.sh` and
`environment/check.sh`) enforces layout, chain, names, the 30~100-LOC single-module
size policy, FLAT crates — `lib.rs` plus at most one module file directly next to
`Cargo.toml`, never a `src/` dir — and DEPS: every dependency in a crate must be
`{name}.workspace = true` (paths + versions + feature selection live only at the
workspace root; no path/version/feature deps inside a crate), and WORLD-ID: rim
code must resolve the focused world via the Orchestrator focus accessors
(`camera()`/`canvas()`/`select()`/… — see `document/WORLD_DELEGATION.md`) or
`WorldManager::spawn_target()`, never a literal world id. The `MAIN_WORLD`
constant has been removed and the world-id allowlist in
`workspace.lint.allow.json` is empty (the rule is hard); standalone trees
(installer, dev-tools) are exempt from DEPS.

**To add a crate, use the `add-crate` skill** (`.claude/skills/add-crate/SKILL.md`), which
drives the `y5-template` binary and reminds you to run `link.all.sh`. Do not hand-create crate
dirs/`Cargo.toml`; the naming must match the convention exactly or the member globs won't pick
the crate up.

## Build & run

`cargo` commands must be run from inside a specific top-level workspace dir (there is no root
