# Signals and Systems — operating instructions

This file is authoritative for routine work. `AGENTS.md` links to it so Codex and Claude share one root contract. This file, `DESIGN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, and selected `.claude/` instruction files are tracked. Working plans, reports, source material, and other local records remain outside git and must be backed up with the working copy. The earlier full instructions are in `.claude/reference/archive/`.

## Communication and authority

- Be exact about what was verified. Do not invent source content, references, results, or gate outcomes.
- The build pipeline, content schema, and sections of `DESIGN.md` marked LOCKED are locked. If a requested change needs one of them to change, report the issue before modifying it.
- Use `TODO.md` for current work and release state. Read the relevant plan and latest report in `.claude/plans/slides/` when working on the slide redesign. Older kickoff files are historical when their status conflicts with `TODO.md` or a later report.
- Read `DESIGN.md` before editing a scene, figure, or style; read `PRODUCT.md` before design work. Read `.claude/reference/history.md` when the reason for a decision is unclear. Consult `.claude/reports/` when the source is ambiguous.

## Task-specific rules

Claude Code loads path-scoped `.claude/rules/` files automatically when it reads matching files. Codex must read the relevant rule files before making the corresponding change:

| Task | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Student-facing content, examples, questions, mathematics | `.claude/rules/content-writing.md` |
| Scenes, figures, plotting, styles, KaTeX | `.claude/rules/figures-and-math.md` and `DESIGN.md` |
| Notes or PDF production | `.claude/rules/notes-and-pdf.md` |
| Source-based authoring or correction | `.claude/rules/source-audit.md` |
| Build, verification, site, or generated output | `.claude/rules/build-pipeline.md` |

Read all applicable rows. These files hold the detailed editorial rules R1–R9, fixed mathematical and content decisions, commands, and known implementation traps. Keep them as the single source of those details; do not duplicate their full text here.

## Repository and working loop

- `build/src/` holds the interactive artifact; `notes/src/` holds lecture notes; `web/` builds the public site; `verify/` holds numerical checks; `dist/` is generated output. `source/` contains private reference PDFs and exam papers; never reproduce or redistribute them.
- The one place for chapter, section, address, and textbook anchors is `build/src/89_sections.js`. Scene order is assembled in `build/src/99_tail.html`.
- Run `git status` before writing generated output. Preserve unrelated changes in this shared tree. Stage only task-owned paths and state what a commit contains beyond your own work.
- Never hand-edit `dist/`, run `npm install`, or fetch dependencies from the network. Do not run blanket search-and-replace across `build/src/*.js`.
- `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` call one repository guard: `agent_guard.py` blocks common `npm install` calls and direct agent edits to `dist/` before a tool runs. `stop_guard.py` and `derivation_advisor.py` are temporarily unwired to cut per-edit overhead; they can still be run by hand. Codex requires review and trust of new hook definitions before it runs them. These agent hooks are not CI gates.
- For routine source changes (styling, wording, a single figure), rebuild and inspect a screenshot; that is the whole loop. Run the full gate chain only before a release, after a change to mathematics or laboratory logic, or when the owner asks. Run the PDF text and page inspection before shipping PDFs. Report actual gate numbers; do not substitute old baseline counts.
- Commit rebuilt tracked `dist/` files with the sources that produced them. For implementation work, commit and push to `main` unless the current task or active plan explicitly holds publication for review. No pull requests or AI attribution in commits.
- This repository and `digital-communications` share one engine. `build/src/40_core.js` is kept byte-identical in both; `60_plot.js`, `90_app.js`, `10_style.css`, `notes/src/notes.css`, `notes/src/render.js`, `notes/topdf.js`, and `web/` share their machinery but carry course-specific parts (π-form frequency axes here; noise, decision regions, and error-probability axes there). A fix to shared machinery (a browser bug, a layout or print fix, touch handling, a guard) goes into both repositories in the same working session, each rebuilt and checked, and each commit message names the sync. Course-specific additions stay in their own repository. Do not align the two files wholesale.
- If work spans hours or is interrupted, update `TODO.md` and append durable context to `.claude/reference/history.md` before ending.
