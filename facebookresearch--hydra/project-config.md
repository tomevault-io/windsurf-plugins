# AGENTS.md

Repo-specific directives for coding agents working in this project.

## Behavioral defaults

These guidelines are intended to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Apply them
alongside the repo-specific rules below. They bias toward caution over speed,
and for truly trivial tasks you may use judgment.

### Think before coding

- Do not assume.
- Do not hide confusion.
- Surface tradeoffs.
- State assumptions explicitly when they matter to the implementation.
- If multiple reasonable interpretations exist, present them instead of silently picking one.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- Push back when warranted.
- If something material is unclear or risky, stop, name what is confusing, and ask instead of guessing.

### Simplicity first

- Solve the requested problem with the minimum code necessary.
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No flexibility or configurability that was not requested.
- No error handling for scenarios that are effectively impossible in context.
- If a solution feels overbuilt for the task, simplify it before considering it done.
- If you write 200 lines and the same result could be achieved in 50, rewrite it.
- Ask: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

### Surgical changes

- Touch only what is needed for the request.
- Do not "clean up" adjacent code, comments, formatting, or structure unless the change requires it.
- Match the existing style and patterns of the codebase unless the user asks for a broader refactor.
- If you notice unrelated dead code or issues nearby, mention them instead of fixing them opportunistically.
- Remove imports, variables, functions, or other artifacts that your change makes unused.
- Do not delete unrelated pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Prefer focused tools over ad hoc shell

Use repository-aware file inspection and edit tools for file operations. Reserve
shell commands for things that genuinely require shell execution: `sl`
(Sapling) commands, `gh`, dependency installation, or `nox` / `pytest` /
`python` for tests, linting, and other repo tooling.

- Use `rg` for text search and `rg --files` for file discovery.
- Avoid inline Python snippets (`python -c ...`) when a dedicated tool or standard CLI utility is sufficient.
- Use structured tools such as `jq` to parse JSON shell output instead of piping to Python.

### Goal-driven execution

- Translate requests into concrete success criteria that can be verified.
- For bug fixes, prefer reproducing the issue with a test or other reliable check before fixing it.
- For refactors, prefer checks that demonstrate behavior is preserved before and after.
- For multi-step tasks, keep a brief plan in mind and verify each step before calling the work complete.
- Favor specific goals over vague ones:
  - "Add validation" -> write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass.
  - "Fix the bug" -> reproduce it with a test or reliable check, then make it pass.
  - "Refactor X" -> verify behavior before and after the refactor.

## Documentation map

- Website and docs source: [`website/`](./website/)
- Current docs: [`website/docs/`](./website/docs/)
- Development docs: [`website/docs/development/`](./website/docs/development/)
- Plugin docs: [`website/docs/plugins/`](./website/docs/plugins/)
- Versioned docs: [`website/versioned_docs/`](./website/versioned_docs/)

## Reproduction files

When asked to create a reproduction for an issue, place files under `temp/`:

- Single-file repro: `temp/<issue_number>.py`
- Multi-file repro: `temp/<issue_number>/`

## Stop and ask

- If a tracked repo file appears unexpectedly renamed, moved, regenerated, deleted, or otherwise changed, stop and ask before reverting, recreating, reclassifying, or staging over that change.
- Do not change supported Python versions, CI matrices, packaging metadata, release automation, or workflow triggers unless the request explicitly includes that scope.

## Verification

- For any new or changed functionality, test it in two layers when practical:
  - run relevant focused tests with `pytest path/to/test_file.py`
  - run the relevant `nox` session to ensure no regressions
- Hydra core tests run with `pytest` from the repository root.
- Plugin tests run from the plugin directory after installing the plugin, or via `nox -s test_plugins`.
- Use `PLUGINS=<plugin_dir_name>` with `nox` when validating one plugin.
- If the broader suite disagrees with focused tests, trust the broader result and do not call the change verified.
- If live verification is blocked by the current environment, request escalation if that would unblock it. If not, stop and ask for guidance.

## Linting and formatting

Run linting through `nox -s lint lint_plugins` when validating broad changes.
The repo's lint sessions include formatting, import sorting, type checks, style,
YAML linting, and security checks.

For focused local checks, use the same tools the noxfile runs:

- `ruff format .` / `ruff format --check .`
- `ruff check .` / `ruff check --fix .`
- `pyrefly check --config pyproject.toml`
- `yamllint --strict .`
- `bandit --exclude ./.nox/** -ll -r .`
