# Repository Guidelines

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Commit history follows Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `migrate:`, `chore:`, etc.) and must use a detailed, structured message format.

Commit message format:
1. First line: `<type>: <imperative summary>` scoped to one cohesive concern.
2. Blank line.
3. Bullet list describing what changed and why (APIs, models, migrations, deletions, wiring changes, behavior changes).
4. Include validation coverage in the body when relevant (tests/lint/commands run).

Example pattern:
```text
feat: add cronjobs API and expand proactive analyst bootstrap context

- add a new FastAPI cronjobs service with health and CRUD/list endpoints
- add typed cronjobs client helpers and API-key handling
- update proactive analyst bootstrap context to include profile cronjobs
- add/adjust tests for API, client, and prompt behavior
```

PRs should describe context, validation commands (e.g., `make check`, `npm run runtime:test`), linked issues, and screenshots/log excerpts for API or UI-affecting work. Highlight any Supabase branch or migration impacts and note required environment tweaks.
