# Research-Skills AGENTS.md

This repo is a **skills collection for OpenCode/Hermes** — not a code project with tests or builds. The skills live under `skills/` and are loaded on demand via the `skill` tool.

## First Things

**Read `skills/for_system_prompt.md`** — it's the meta-system prompt for the Academic Research Copilot role. Inject its content into your system prompt before using `paper-writing` or `patent-writing`.

## Primary Entry Points

Two umbrella skills cover the full academic workflow:

- **`skills/paper-writing/SKILL.md`** — 7-step paper writing pipeline (intent→feasibility→deep research→drafting→consistency→plagiarism→humanize)
- **`skills/patent-writing/SKILL.md`** — 7-step patent drafting pipeline (same structure)

Both reference sub-modules in `skills/paper-writing/references/`.

## Important Gotchas

### DO use paper-writing SKILL.md directly, NOT research-* sub-skills
The README documents `research-intent`, `research-idea-parser`, etc. as separate directories — **they don't exist as separate dirs anymore**. The full pipeline logic is embedded directly in `paper-writing/SKILL.md` and `patent-writing/SKILL.md`. Route via `for_system_prompt.md` instead.

### docx generation pitfalls (from paper-writing SKILL.md)
- For long Chinese documents (>20,000 characters), **use python-docx** not docx-js
- docx-js has f-string escaping issues with Chinese Unicode (`\u201c`/`\u201d` conflict with JS string delimiters)
- Subagent timeout: **do NOT delegate final docx generation to subagents** — they will time out (600s+). Generate in the main session.

### Data currency (paper-writing SKILL.md)
- Distinguish **Current Status** (past real data) from **Trends/Forecast** (future-only)
- Always ask user for "current time point" before writing
- Label data sources with cutoff dates
- SIA annual report, FAA, planet4589.org, UCS satellite database are top data sources

### Bibliometric papers
If keywords include "bibliometric", "文献计量", "VOSviewer", etc., **do NOT run the standard 7-step workflow**. Read `references/bibliometric-paper-workflow.md` first — the flow is fundamentally different (real data collection via CrossRef API, analysis + visualization, data export as CSV).

### arXiv skill
Uses curl + arXiv REST API (no API key). Parse Atom XML output with inline Python.

### Language
The repo is bilingual (Chinese/English). Primary documentation is in Chinese. Questions may come in either language.
