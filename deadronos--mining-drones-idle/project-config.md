## 🧠 Memory Bank System

**CRITICAL**: This project uses a structured Memory Bank for context preservation. Review these files before starting work:

- **Memory Location**: `/memory/` folder
- **Task Management**: `/memory/tasks/` with `_index.md` master list
- **Design Documentation**: `/memory/designs/` for architectural decisions
- **Context Files**: `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `projectbrief.md`

**ID Management**: Ensure unique Task/Design IDs across both active designs and tasks folders and `/COMPLETED/` subfolders.
📖 **Full Details**: See `.github/instructions/memory-bank.instructions.md`

## 📝 Before You Start

1. ✅ Check Memory Bank files in `/memory/`
2. ✅ Review existing tasks in `/memory/tasks/_index.md`
3. ✅ Update `activeContext.md` with current focus
4. ✅ Follow unique ID allocation rules
5. ✅ Document progress in memory system

- **Memory Updates**: Document significant changes in memory bank
