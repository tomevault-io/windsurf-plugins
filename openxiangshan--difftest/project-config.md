# Difftest Working Guidelines

Before working under `difftest/`, determine whether the task is a potentially complex, multi-file change or requires iterative testing/debugging. If so, review the relevant files in `difftest/docs/` as needed before proceeding.

For complex tasks, follow the plan/progress workflow defined in [`difftest/docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md): create a plan, create a progress log, execute in phases, and use `askQuestions` to confirm ambiguities and end-of-conversation next steps.
