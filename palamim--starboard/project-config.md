# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- Build: `swift build`
- Run: `.build/debug/Starboard` (or `swift run`, but `swift run` attaches the
  process's stdout/stderr to the terminal and blocks it — running the built
  binary directly and backgrounding it is usually more convenient for a
  persistent GUI app)
- There are no tests, linters, or CI configured.

## Architecture

Plain Swift Package Manager executable target (`Starboard`), no Xcode
project, no Info.plist. Three files in `Sources/Starboard/`:

- `main.swift` — entry point. Creates `NSApplication.shared`, sets the
  delegate, and calls `app.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)` *before*
  `app.run()`. This is what gives the app no Dock icon and no Cmd+Tab entry
  — there is no Info.plist / `LSUIElement` involved, since SPM executables
  don't bundle one.
- `KeyablePanel.swift` — an `NSPanel` subclass that overrides
  `canBecomeKey` to return `true`. Needed because a borderless panel with
  `.nonactivatingPanel` style won't accept keystrokes otherwise, and
  `.nonactivatingPanel` is what lets the terminal view become key *without*
  activating the app or stealing focus from whatever app the user is
  currently in.
- `AppDelegate.swift` — everything else: builds the panel, tracks the Dock
  to size/position it, and wires up the terminal.
  - The panel's `collectionBehavior` includes `.canJoinAllSpaces` and
    `.fullScreenAuxiliary` so it stays visible across every Space, including
    over full-screen apps. `effectView.layer?.masksToBounds = true` clips
    the (edge-to-edge) terminal view to the panel's rounded corners —
    without it, square corners get painted over the rounded blur.
  - The terminal itself is a [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm)
    `LocalProcessTerminalView`, started once via
    `startProcess(executable: "/bin/zsh", args: ["-l"], ...)`. This is a
    real PTY-backed shell process, not a `Process` spawned per command —
    that's what makes `cd`, shell history, and arrow-key line editing work
    across commands instead of resetting each time.
  - `nativeBackgroundColor`/`layer?.backgroundColor` are set to `.clear` on
    the terminal view so the panel's blur shows through behind the text;
    SwiftTerm's Metal renderer is off by default (`useMetalRenderer` starts
    `false`), which is what makes the transparent layer approach work — if
    that ever gets toggled on, the transparency handling would need
    revisiting.
  - `setUpMainMenu()` builds a minimal `NSMenu` (Quit + Edit: Copy/Paste/
    Select All) and sets it as `NSApp.mainMenu`. This menu is never
    visibly shown — the nonactivating panel never makes Starboard the
    frontmost app — but Cmd+C/Cmd+V/Cmd+A only resolve to a view's
    `copy(_:)`/`paste(_:)`/`selectAll(_:)` via AppKit's menu-key-equivalent
    system, so without *some* main menu those keystrokes go nowhere,
    silently, regardless of whether it's ever drawn on screen.

### Dock tracking

The panel positions itself as a companion to the Dock — same height, left
edge touching the Dock's right edge, same bottom margin as the Dock (so
they share a baseline), and its own right edge flush against the screen's
right edge, no margin there at all. A repeating `Timer`
(`dockTrackingInterval`, 1s) recomputes this and
calls `panel.setFrame` whenever it changes, so it follows the Dock live as
it's resized or gains/loses icons — there's no notification to observe for
this, so it's polled.

The Dock's geometry comes from `dockIconTrayFrame()`, which reads the
`AXList` element (the icon row) from the Dock process's accessibility tree
via `AXUIElementCreateApplication` / `AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue`. This
is deliberately **not** `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo`: on modern macOS the
Dock's own window frame spans the entire screen (the Dock process also
hosts desktop wallpaper/icon interaction — see the sibling "Wallpaper"
window owned by the same process), which is useless for positioning. The
`AXList` box is close but not exact: its bottom edge sits above the Dock's
real bottom margin, and its top edge overshoots above the Dock's real top
edge by a smaller amount — Apple doesn't expose the actual painted chrome
rectangle through Accessibility at all. `dockBottomCorrection` (5pt) and
`dockTopCorrection` (5pt) are empirical fixes for that gap, tuned pixel by
pixel against one real Dock; nudge them if the panel's edges visibly drift
from the Dock's, e.g. at a very different tile size.

Reading another process's accessibility tree requires the user to grant
Starboard Accessibility permission (`AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` is
called with the prompt option at launch to trigger the system dialog).
Until granted — or if the Dock's AX tree is ever unreadable —
`fallbackFrame(on:)` is used instead: a fixed-width panel in the
bottom-right corner, with height read from the gap between
`NSScreen.main.frame` and `.visibleFrame` (which doesn't need any special
permission, but also can't reveal the Dock's *width*).

No App Sandbox entitlements are set (SPM executables are unsandboxed by
default), which is required for spawning a shell process at all.
