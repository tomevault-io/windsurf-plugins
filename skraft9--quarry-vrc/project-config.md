# Quarry for AI agents

This guide is for an agentic AI - Claude Code, Cursor, or a custom local agent - working a bug
bounty hunt alongside a human in Quarry. It explains what Quarry is, how to record a lead the app
will index, how to query the console, and how to ship a report to HackerOne.

Quarry is deliberately simple to automate: **your research is plain Markdown on disk**, and the
whole corpus is queryable over an HTTP API. There is no SDK to learn and no lock-in - you read and
write files, and optionally call the API for structured queries.

## The mental model

| Thing | Where it lives | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| **Leads** (your working notes/findings) | Markdown files in the **workspace volume** | the files - you own them |
| **Reports** | pulled from the **HackerOne API** | HackerOne |
| **Programs / scopes / targets** | the **HackerOne API** | HackerOne |
| **Payloads** | a cloned reference library | the clone |
| **Retest verdicts** | the `regressions` table, via the console or `regression.py` | you - it is a judgement, not an entity |

The SQLite database is only a cache and a search index. You never edit it directly: you write a
Markdown file, and Quarry indexes it (immediately in-app, or on the next `ingest.py --rebuild`).

## Workspace layout

Leads and reports are files under the workspace root (mounted at `/workspace` in the container),
organised by target and vulnerability class:

```
/workspace/<target>/<CLASS>/notes/<slug>.md      a LEAD (your working note)
/workspace/<target>/<CLASS>/reports/<slug>.md     a REPORT (what you send to HackerOne)
/workspace/<target>/notes/<slug>.md               a lead with no class
```

`<CLASS>` is a short code taken from the directory name: `BAC`, `DoS`, `RCE`, `SECRETS`, `PRIVESC`,
`AUTHN`, `INJECTION`, `SSRF`, `INTEGRITY`, `API`, ... A file under `evidence/` or `bin/` is ignored,
so put PoC scripts and captures there without polluting the lead list.

## Recording a lead the app will index

A file becomes a **lead** when it carries a `**Status:**` marker **within its first 25 lines**.
Without that marker it is treated as a note (still searchable, but not a queue item). Write leads
to this house format so the app parses every field:

```markdown
# <ref> - <one-line title of the finding>

**Decision summary:** One or two sentences: what you think is wrong and whether it is worth chasing.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status:** | open |
| **Researcher** | yourhandle |
| **Date** | 2026-01-15 |
| **Target** | SomeProduct 1.2.3 |
| **Version** | 1.2.3 |
| **Class** | BAC / broken access control |
| **CWE** | CWE-284 |
| **Privilege** | low |
| **Impact** | Confidentiality - High |
| **Source** | https://github.com/vendor/product @ tag v1.2.3 |

## Claim
<the mechanism, precisely, with file:line where you can>

## Proof
<how to reproduce; put runnable PoCs under bin/, captures under evidence/>
```

**Status vocabulary** (the lead's place in the workflow), lowest to terminal:

`open` -> `confirmed` -> `ready` -> `submitted` -> `awarded`, plus `parked` (shelved) and `killed`
(dead, do not re-hunt). Move a lead by editing its `**Status:**` value. The **Researcher** row is
what attributes a lead to a collaborator, so fill it in.

**Rules that matter to the parser:**

- The `**Status:**` row is FIRST and within the first 25 lines.
- One finding per file. Name the file for the finding, e.g. `bac-idor-on-order-endpoint.md`.
- Keep the header a real Markdown table so `Class`, `CWE`, `Privilege` and `Impact` are read into
  their columns.

## Querying the console (API + Bearer tokens)

Every list is available over the API, so you can pull exactly the context you need instead of
re-reading the whole workspace. Issue a **Bearer token** in the **Tokens** tab, then:

```bash
TOKEN=tok_...
BASE=https://<host>:<port>

curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$BASE/api/leads?status=ready"
curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$BASE/api/reports?program=<handle>"
curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$BASE/api/programs"
curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$BASE/api/search?q=idor"
```

Bearer requests are CSRF-exempt (there is no ambient browser credential), so they are the right
channel for scripts and agents. A read token cannot mutate; ask the operator for a write token only
if you need to create leads through the API rather than by writing files.

## Drafting and shipping a report to HackerOne

When a lead reaches `ready`, turn it into a report and file it. A report is prose aimed at a triager:
lead with the impact, state the broken control in the first line, give exact steps to reproduce
(commands only in code blocks; what a command returns goes in the prose above it), and end with
remediation. Write it to `.../reports/<slug>.md`.

To submit, the human connects their HackerOne credential once in **Integrations** (username + API
token, stored write-only). Then a report is filed straight to the API - from the app's submit action
on the lead/report, or from the CLI:

```bash
# prints the payload and STOPS; add --confirm to actually send
python3 h1.py --submit reports/<slug>.md --program <handle> \
  --weakness cwe-284 --scope "<in-scope asset>" --severity medium
```
