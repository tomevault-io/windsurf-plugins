# FrontRow Project Cursor Rules
# =============================

## Project Overview
This is a real-time virtual venue application for live performances with audience interaction. The project includes:
- React frontend with Vite
- Node.js backend with Socket.IO
- Electron modal app for testing
- MCP server for AI integration

## Development Environment
- Use the Python development script: `python start_dev.py --full`
- The MCP server runs on port 8001 and provides tools for controlling the modal app
- The modal app is an Electron application that appears on all desktops

## MCP Server Configuration
The project includes a custom MCP server (`mcp_modal_server.py`) that provides tools for:
- Controlling the modal dialog application
- Sending test messages and notifications
- Managing E2E testing coordination
- Progress tracking and user interaction

### MCP Server Tools Available:
- `modal_connect` - Connect to the modal server
- `modal_show_message` - Display messages in the modal
- `modal_hide` - Hide the modal
- `modal_progress` - Update progress bar
- `modal_ask_question` - Ask questions via modal
- `modal_send_custom` - Send custom actions
- `modal_status` - Get server status
- `modal_test_sequence` - Run test sequence

## Code Style and Standards
- Use TypeScript for frontend components
- Follow React best practices
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Include proper error handling
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

## Testing
- Use the MCP server tools for E2E testing coordination
- Test modal interactions through the MCP server
- Run `python test_modal_mcp.py` to test MCP functionality
- Use `python packages/modal-app/test-modal.py` for direct modal testing

## File Organization
- Keep components in `front-row-vite/src/components/`
- Server code in `server/`
- Modal app in `packages/modal-app/`
- Test scripts in root directory
- Documentation in markdown files

## Important Notes
- The modal app must be running for MCP tools to work
- The backend server (port 3001) must be running for modal communication
- Use the Python development script for consistent environment setup
