# AGENTS.md: working notes for agents contributing to wacrg

> Guidance for any AI coding agent (and humans) working on this repository.
> Follows the [agents.md](https://agents.md) convention. wacrg is a
> GitHub-native, machine-readable, confidence-graded specification of the
> WhatsApp 1:1 call protocol: signaling, keying, media, transport.
>
> Read this first, then the doc it points you to for your task. This file is
> meant to accrete: when you learn something durable about the process,
> add it here so the next agent starts where you finished.

## The one rule

Confidence is earned, and provenance is mandatory. Every fact is graded
`confirmed | probable | speculative | unknown` and carries who/what/how/where.
A single technique (one static read, one capture, one reconstruction) is
`probable` at most. `confirmed` requires two or more independent
techniques or contributors agreeing. Never round up; put uncertainty in
`open_questions`, not in the grade. The full model:
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md),
[docs/methodology/index.md](docs/methodology/index.md).

## Repo layout

```text
spec/                 the CURATED corpus (YAML, schema-validated): the source of truth
  stanzas/ flows/ enums/ techniques/ glossary.yaml
  contributors/<id>.yaml   WHO (one per researcher)
  flavors/<id>.yaml        WHICH reimplementations exist (whatsapp-rust, zapo-caller, ...)
  flavors/<id>.map.yaml    WHERE each flavor realizes the spec (inverse Source-of-truth)
  schema/*.schema.json     validation
corpus/captures/      raw observations (intake), sanitized
docs/                 the published MkDocs site (hand-written narrative + generated)
  spec/**             GENERATED from spec/, committed, do not hand-edit
  methodology/  techniques/
  codec/mlow/   keying/   signaling/   reconstruction.md   ← deep RE narratives
scripts/              validate / generate / coverage / ingest (TypeScript, tsx)
```

`docs/media/` is gitignored (a prior raw dump used that path). Put new
sections under a real path like `docs/codec/`, `docs/keying/`, `docs/signaling/`.

## Before you commit: the build gate

```bash
npm run build   # validate (schema + referential integrity) → generate docs/spec → coverage
npm run check   # build + `git diff --exit-code` on generated files (CI parity)
```

`validate` fails if any `provenance.techniques`/`contributors` id is
unregistered. `generate` rewrites `docs/spec/**`; `coverage` rewrites
`COVERAGE.md` + `docs/coverage-badge.json`. Commit the regenerated files.
A root-level file (this one, README) does not affect the gate, but any `spec/`
change does.

Stage explicit paths, never `git add -A`: this repo is edited concurrently
by more than one agent/human. Check `git status` shows only your files first.
Commit, do not push. [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
`feat:` new fact/doc, `fix:` correction, `docs:` prose, `chore:` tooling.
No Claude/AI attribution in commit messages. No real PII/keys/media, ever.

## Attribution: the four provenance dimensions

Every spec attribute/child carries `provenance` with: `techniques` (fixed set),
`flavors` (independent
reimplementations that corroborate it, must exist in `spec/flavors/` — a
corroborating source, **not** a technique, and a port does not corroborate its
upstream), `contributors` (must exist in `spec/contributors/`), `sources`
(issue/PR/commit refs). Raw tool output (identity maps, dumps) lives under
`corpus/` (or off-repo warden tooling), not `docs/`. Full model:
[docs/attribution.md](docs/attribution.md). Register yourself once at
`spec/contributors/<handle>.yaml`.

## Methodology: techniques and independent reconstructions

The seven fixed techniques (the only `provenance.techniques` values):
`websocket-capture`, `baileys-instrumentation`, `frida-hooking`, `mitm-tls`,
`static-smali-analysis`, `memory-dump`, `wasm-analysis`.

The under-served area is keying and media internals. The main approach is
`wasm-analysis` of the WhatsApp Web engine (it ships the codec and KDFs
as WASM) plus independent reconstructions by the community. When two of
these agree on a fact, it is corroborated toward `confirmed`. Treat an
independent working reimplementation (e.g. a Rust/TS port that places real calls)
as strong evidence, but record it as a **flavor** (`spec/flavors/<id>.yaml`) and
cite it in `provenance.flavors` — a corroborating *source*, not a technique. Only
call a fact `confirmed` when the agreeing *techniques* are genuinely independent
(a reimplementation derived from the same capture is *not* independent of that
capture, and a flavor that `derives_from` another is *not* independent of its
upstream). External reconstructions are also surveyed in
[docs/reconstruction.md](docs/reconstruction.md).

## wasm-analysis operational guide

The `wa.wasm` Web engine is reversed with [warden](https://github.com/purpshell/warden)
into a knowledge base (`analysis/.warden/warden.db`, label `v1`). What works,
and the traps:

- Trust strings over agent names. The deep-analysis pass auto-named ~90% of
  functions by guessing; those names are leads, not facts. Ground truth is
  the binary's own strings: demangled C++ RTTI (`c++filt -t` on `N...E` typeinfo),
