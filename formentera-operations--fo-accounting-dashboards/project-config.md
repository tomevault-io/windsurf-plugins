# FO Accounting Dashboards — Developer Guide

This repo contains Claude.ai skill definitions that allow the Formentera Operations accounting team to query Snowflake gold models and generate Excel reports — replacing manual Quorum ODA downloads and pivot workflows.

## Before You Write a Skill

1. **Read the project README** for the report you're building → `projects/{domain}/README.md`
2. **Understand the gold model grain and filters** — see the Model Catalog below
3. **Check the analytics repo** (`Formentera-Operations/analytics`) for the actual SQL if you need column-level detail

## Snowflake Connection

Skills query the **production gold layer** in Snowflake:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Account | `YL35090.south-central-us.azure` |
| Database | `FO_PRODUCTION_DB` |
| Role | `DBT_ROLE` |
| Auth | RSA keypair |

**MCP tool:** Use the Snowflake MCP server configured in the Claude.ai Project. Never hardcode credentials in skill definitions.

## Gold Model Catalog

All gold models live in `FO_PRODUCTION_DB`. Schema names follow the pattern `gold_{domain}`.

### Accounts Receivable — `gold_financial`

#### `gold_fct_ar_aging_summary`
**ODA equivalent:** Report ARR (AR Report)
**Grain:** One row per invoice
**Standard filter:** `WHERE include_record = 1` for actionable outstanding items

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `invoice_id` | PK |
| `invoice_number` | Invoice identifier |
| `company_code` / `company_name` | Operating company |
| `owner_id` / `owner_code` / `owner_name` | Invoice recipient |
| `well_id` / `well_code` / `well_name` | Associated well/property |
| `invoice_date` | Invoice date (used to calculate aging) |
| `days_past_due` | Days since invoice_date; negative = future-dated (not yet due) |
| `total_invoice_amount` | Gross invoice amount |
| `remaining_balance` | Outstanding balance (used in aging buckets) |
| `current_balance` | Balance not yet due (days_past_due <= 0) |
| `balance_1_30_days` | 1-30 days past due |
| `balance_31_60_days` | 31-60 days past due |
| `balance_61_90_days` | 61-90 days past due |
| `balance_90_plus_days` | Over 90 days past due |
| `is_invoice_posted` | `true` = posted to GL |
| `include_record` | `1` = include in standard aging report |
| `hold_billing` | Invoice is on billing hold |
| `voucher_number` | GL voucher reference |
| `invoice_description` | Free-text description |

**Common filter patterns:**

Standard AR aging (matches ODA ARR report): `WHERE include_record = 1`

Posted invoices only: `WHERE is_invoice_posted = true AND include_record = 1`

Pre-JIB preview (unposted): `WHERE is_invoice_posted = false`

---

#### `gold_fct_ar_aging_detail`
**ODA equivalent:** Report 640 (AR Detail Report)
**Grain:** One row per AR transaction (invoice, payment, adjustment, netting)

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `invoice_id` | Parent invoice FK |
| `transaction_source` | `invoice` / `payment` / `adjustment` / `netting` |
| `transaction_date` | Date of the transaction |
| `transaction_type` | Invoice type label |
| `transaction_reference` | Free-text reference |
| `balance_due` | Transaction amount |
| `remaining_balance` | Parent invoice outstanding balance |
| `include_record` | `1` = include in standard report |
| `company_code` / `company_name` | Operating company |
| `owner_code` / `owner_name` | Invoice recipient |

| `invoice_number` | Parent invoice number |
| `voucher_number` | GL voucher reference |
| `is_invoice_posted` | Posted status of parent invoice |
| `sort_order` | Display ordering |

---

### Revenue — `gold_financial`

#### `gold_fct_owner_revenue_detail`
**ODA equivalent:** Report ORD (Owner Revenue Detail)
**Grain:** One row per owner revenue distribution line item
**Filter:** Redistributed items (payment_status_id = 8) excluded at model build time — no runtime filter needed

|--------|-------------|
| `id` | Natural key (ODA distribution ID) |
| `owner_revenue_detail_sk` | Surrogate key |
| `company_code` | Operating company |
| `owner_id` / `owner_code` / `owner_name` | Owner |
| `fid` | Owner federal tax ID |
| `well_code` / `well_name` | Associated well |

### General Ledger — `gold_financial`

#### `gold_fct_gl_details`
**ODA equivalent:** AR Cross-Clear report, GL Detail Extract (GLE)
**Grain:** One row per GL journal entry line
**Used for:** AR Cross-Clear skill — no dedicated gold model needed, query directly with filters

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `main_account` | GL main account code (e.g. 501, 130) |
| `sub_account` | GL sub account code (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4) |
| `account_name` | GL account name (e.g. REVENUE PAYABLE, A/R JIB) |
| `voucher_code` | Voucher number — use to pair debit/credit rows |
| `entity_type` | Type of entity (owner, vendor, well, etc.) |
| `entity_code` | Entity identifier |
| `entity_name` | Entity display name |
| `journal_date` | Transaction date |
| `accrual_date` | Accounting period date |
| `gl_description` | Transaction description |
| `net_amount` | Amount — debits positive, credits negative |

**AR Cross-Clear filter pattern:**
```sql
WHERE main_account IN ('501', '130')
  AND sub_account IN ('1', '2', '3', '4')
  AND (
    gl_description LIKE '%Net Revenue Against A/R%'
    OR gl_description LIKE '%AR Cross Clear%'
  )
```

**Pairing logic:** Each cross-clear voucher produces two rows that net to zero —
one debit (501.x Revenue Payable) and one credit (130.x A/R JIB). Group by
`voucher_code` to see matched pairs.

### Accounts Payable — `gold_financial`

#### `gold_dim_ap_check_register`
**ODA equivalent:** Report 330 (AP Check Register)
**Grain:** One row per AP check

| Column | Description |

| `company_code` / `company_name` | Operating company |
| `check_number` | Check / transaction number |
| `check_date` | Date issued |
| `check_type` | Payment type code |
| `check_type_name` | Full payment type label (System/Manual + type) |
| `check_amount` | Payment amount |
| `main_account` / `sub_account` / `account_name` | GL account |
| `voucher_code` | GL voucher reference |
| `entity_code` / `entity_name` | Payee (vendor entity) |
| `void_date` | Date voided (null if not voided) |
| `reconciled` | `YES` if reconciled, blank if not |

## Skill Structure

Each report domain lives in `projects/{domain}/skills/`. Each skill is a Markdown file defining the Claude prompt, expected inputs, query pattern, and output format.

```
projects/
  ar_aging/
    skills/
      ar_aging_summary.md     <- structured report skill (Report ARR)
      ar_detail_drilldown.md  <- entity drill-down skill (Report 640)
    docs/
      field_mapping.md        <- ODA column -> gold model column mapping
      business_logic.md       <- filter patterns, edge cases, gotchas
```

### Skill File Template

```markdown
# Skill: {Report Name}

## Purpose
[What accounting question this answers]

## ODA Equivalent
Report {code} - {name}

## Gold Models Used
- `FO_PRODUCTION_DB.{schema}.{model}` - {why}

## Input Parameters
- `period` (required): Accounting period, e.g. "February 2026"
- `company` (optional): Company code filter

## Standard Filters
[Document the WHERE clause pattern for standard report output]

## Output Columns
[Ordered list matching the ODA report layout]

## Excel Format
[Column widths, header row, summary totals, freeze panes]

## Edge Cases
[Known gotchas - pre-JIB invoices, voided checks, suspense categories]
```

## How to Build a Skill

1. **Find the ODA report** in the mapping table → `docs/brainstorms/2026-02-26-oda-reports-claude-skills-brainstorm.md`
2. **Identify the gold model** — confirm grain, key columns, and standard filters from this CLAUDE.md
3. **Check the analytics repo** for the actual SQL if column behavior is unclear
4. **Write the skill file** using the template above
5. **Test the query** against `FO_PRODUCTION_DB` using the Snowflake MCP before finalizing
6. **Update the project README** to mark the skill as complete

## Key Business Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `include_record = 1` | Include in standard AR aging — excludes paired advance/closeout transactions |
| `is_invoice_posted` | Invoice has been posted to the GL; unposted = pre-JIB or draft |
| `hold_billing` | Invoice is on billing hold — typically excluded from aging reports |
| `payment_status_id = 8` | Revenue redistributed — excluded from owner revenue detail at model build time |
| `days_past_due` | Negative = future-dated invoice (not yet due); zero = due today |
| WI | Working interest — operator's share of costs and revenue |
| ORRI | Overriding royalty interest — royalty carved out of WI |
| NRI | Net revenue interest — share of production revenue |
| JIB | Joint interest billing — billing between working interest partners |
| Suspense | Revenue held pending resolution (missing division orders, address, title issues) |
