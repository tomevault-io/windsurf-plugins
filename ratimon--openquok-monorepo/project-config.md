# Source-project neutrality in the codebase

When implementing behavior that was informed by or ported from another product, library, or external codebase, **do not name that source** in repository content.

**Also forbidden in this repo’s source and docs:**

- File paths, module names, or directory layouts that point at **another** project or machine (e.g. a personal clone, a different app’s `apps/…/file.tsx`, or any path outside this monorepo).
- JSDoc/TSDoc `@see` (or similar) that reference **other** codebases, repositories, or their files.

Applies to:

- SQL (`COMMENT ON`, migration headers, inline notes)
- Code comments and docstrings
- User-facing strings and public docs in-repo
- Cursor rules and other `.cursor` guidance

Describe intent, schema, and behavior in **neutral, first-party** terms (what this project does and why). If attribution or comparison is needed, keep it outside the repo (e.g. internal notes, PR discussion).

The assistant should follow this when adding or editing files.
