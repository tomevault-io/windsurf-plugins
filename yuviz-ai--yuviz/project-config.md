# Testing

## When to add tests

- Bug fix → add/adjust a regression test when practical.
- New business logic → add tests in the nearest existing `tests/` package.
- Isolation-sensitive behavior → cover **allowed** access and **cross-tenant reject**.

Follow existing pytest layout: `services/<svc>/tests/test_*.py`, `libs/*/tests/`. Gateway: GoogleTest under `tests/`, run via `ctest`.

## How to run

```bash
pytest                                 # or a focused path
pytest services/config/tests/test_api.py -k cross_tenant
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure   # C++ after cmake build
cd admin-ui && npm run lint                  # UI
```

Config Service tests share a session-scoped asyncio loop (see `pyproject.toml`) — don't "fix" that without understanding why.

## Before claiming done

Run the checks that matter for the change. Never claim pass unless executed.

No repo-wide mypy/ruff is configured — don't invent a gate. Prefer pytest for Python behavior.
