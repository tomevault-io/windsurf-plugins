description: How to review code changes in this repo (read-only unless asked to fix)

# Code review

When asked to review: **do not modify code** unless explicitly asked to fix.

Review the actual diff and relevant surrounding code (callers, schema, auth).

## Priority order

1. Correctness
2. Security / tenant isolation
3. Data integrity (soft delete, FKs, cache write-through)
4. API compatibility
5. Error handling
6. Concurrency / idempotency
7. Performance (complexity, redundant work)
8. Cleanliness (unused/duplicated code, **comment bloat**) — not personal style

When reviewing: flag (or remove if asked to fix) comments that narrate obvious code, exceed ~2 lines without a non-obvious *why*, or make the diff harder to read. Prefer deletion over rewriting essays.

## Finding format

`[P0]` Critical · `[P1]` High · `[P2]` Medium · `[P3]` Low

Each finding: severity, file/line, problem, why it matters, recommended fix.

Only real, actionable issues — no nitpicks on style that matches the repo.

## Verdict

End with one of: `APPROVE` · `APPROVE WITH FIXES` · `REQUEST CHANGES`
