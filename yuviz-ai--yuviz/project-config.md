# Tenant isolation & security

yuviz is multi-tenant. Isolation is a hard invariant.

## Identity

- Never trust tenant_id, user id, email, or role from the client body/query/headers.
- Use `CurrentUser` from verified JWT (`services/config/deps.get_current_user`).
- `superadmin` may be unscoped (`tenant_id` null); `admin`/`viewer` are tenant-scoped.
- Writes that mutate config require `require_role("superadmin", "admin")` (viewer is read-only).

## Data access

- Scope owned-data queries by tenant (UUID `tenant_id` on most tables; `calls.tenant_id` is a slug — follow existing call code).
- Reject cross-tenant FK assignment (e.g. agent pointing at another tenant's provider) — see existing checks in `agents.py` / provider routers and `test_*cross_tenant*`.
- Soft-delete with `deleted_at`; don't hard-delete unless the surrounding code already does.
- Enforce authorization server-side in routers/services; UI checks are not enough.

## Secrets

- Never log, commit, or return decrypted API keys, JWT secrets, passwords, or `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- Store credentials as `enc:` / `k8s:` / `env:` refs via `libs/config_sdk/secrets.py` — never plaintext in Postgres.
- Do not commit `deployment/.env` or invent hardcoded fallbacks for real secrets.

When a change touches owned data, auth, roles, or permissions: explicitly consider cross-tenant impact and prefer a regression test for both allowed and rejected access.
