# Zune Explorer - Development Guide

## Project Overview
A Zune HD-inspired file explorer built with Electron, featuring a panoramic horizontal scrolling interface. Runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Architecture

### Platform Modules
Platform-specific code is isolated in `src/main/platform-darwin.js`, `src/main/platform-win32.js`, and `src/main/platform-linux.js`. All three export the same interface:
- `getAllowedPrefixes()` — security path validation prefixes
- `scanApplications(homePath)` — discover installed applications
- `getRecentFiles(homePath)` — platform-native recent file discovery
- `getAppIcon(appPath)` — extract application icons
- `getExternalVolumes()` — discover mounted external drives

`main.js` loads the correct module at startup via `process.platform`.

## Zune HD Design Principles
Based on the Zune HD interface design:

### Typography
- Large, bold section headers (60px+ font size) as primary navigation
- Clean, sans-serif typography (Segoe UI preferred)
- High contrast text on dark backgrounds

### Color Scheme
- Background: Pure black (#000000) to dark gray (#0a0a0a)
- Accent colors: Orange (#ff6900) to magenta gradient
- Text: White (#ffffff) for primary, light gray (#b0b0b0) for secondary
- Interactive elements use orange highlights

### Layout Structure
- Horizontal panoramic scrolling interface
- Full viewport width sections placed side-by-side
- Smooth momentum scrolling between sections
- Vertical scrolling within sections for overflow content

### File Categories
The app organizes files into 5 main sections:
1. **music** - Audio files (.mp3, .wav, .m4a, .flac) — auto-scanned
2. **videos** - Video files (.mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv) — auto-scanned
3. **pictures** - Image files (.jpg, .png, .gif, .svg) — auto-scanned
4. **documents** - Document files (.pdf, .txt, .doc, .xlsx) — browsable file system
5. **applications** - Executable files (.app on macOS, .exe on Windows, .desktop on Linux) — auto-scanned

### Interaction Design
- Smooth horizontal scrolling via mouse wheel, trackpad, and arrow keys
- Optional section snapping to viewport edges
- Touch-friendly with large hit targets
- Subtle animations and transitions

## Development Commands
```bash
npm start     # Run the application
npm run dev   # Run in development mode with DevTools
npm run build # Build for distribution
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Horizontal scrolling works smoothly
- [ ] Files are correctly categorized by extension
- [ ] Section headers are prominently displayed
- [ ] Dark theme with proper contrast
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Empty sections show appropriate placeholders
- [ ] File metadata (size, date) is displayed correctly
- [ ] Windows: custom title bar shows with working controls
- [ ] Windows: applications discovered from Start Menu
- [ ] Windows: recent files populated from Recent folder
- [ ] Linux: custom title bar shows with working controls
- [ ] Linux: applications discovered from .desktop files
- [ ] Linux: recent files populated from recently-used.xbel
- [ ] Linux: external volumes detected from /proc/mounts
