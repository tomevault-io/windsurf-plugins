# Type Rules

- When importing types, use `@/types`
- Name files like `example-types.ts`
- All types should go in `types`
- Make sure to export the types in `types/index.ts`
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases
- If referring to db types, use `@/db/schema` such as `SelectTodo` from `todos-schema.ts`

An example of a type:

`types/actions-types.ts`

```ts
export type ActionState<T> =
  | { isSuccess: true; message: string; data: T }
  | { isSuccess: false; message: string; data?: never }
```

And exporting it:

`types/index.ts`

```ts
export * from "./actions-types"
```
