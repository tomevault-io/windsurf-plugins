# Agent Guidelines

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Conventional Commits

All commit messages and PR titles MUST follow conventional commit format:

**Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes that affect the CLI behavior (not CI, docs, or infrastructure)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style/formatting (no logic changes)
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Testing changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks, releases, dependency updates, CI/infrastructure changes
- `security:` - Security-related changes

**Scopes:**
- For command-specific changes, use the command name: `check`, `fix`, `run`, `init`, `install`, `validate`, etc.
- For subsystem changes: `hook`, `step`, `config`, `lock`, `pkl`, `builtins`, `stash`, `deps`

**Description Style:**
- Use lowercase after the colon
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep it concise but descriptive

**Examples:**
- `fix(step): resolve race condition in file locking`
- `feat(check): add --slow flag for expensive linters`
- `feat(builtins): add biome linter`
- `docs: update pkl configuration examples`
- `chore: release 0.5.0`

## Development Commands

**Build the project:**
```bash
mise run build
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests (Rust unit tests + bats integration tests)
mise run test

# Run only Rust tests
mise run test:cargo

# Run a single Rust test by name
cargo test test_name

# Run only bats tests
mise run test:bats

# Run a specific bats test file
mise run test:bats test/check.bats
```

**Lint and format code:**
```bash
# Run all linters and checks
hk check --all
hk check --all --slow  # includes slower checks (cargo clippy)

# Fix formatting and linting issues
hk fix --all
hk fix --all --slow
```

## High-Level Architecture

hk is a git hook manager and project linting tool written in Rust with emphasis on performance and concurrent execution. The architecture leverages file locks to maximize concurrency while preventing race conditions.

### Workspace Structure

The project is a Cargo workspace with these crates:
- **hk** (root): Main CLI application
- **xx**: HTTP client and utility library
- **clx**: CLI/terminal UI utilities (progress indicators, styling)
- **ensembler**: Script/command execution engine

### Core Components

**Configuration System (src/config.rs):**
- Main config file: `hk.pkl` in project root
- Uses Pkl (github.com/apple/pkl) as the configuration language
- Config amends a base schema from `pkl/Config.pkl`

**Hook System (src/hook.rs):**
- Manages git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push, commit-msg, prepare-commit-msg)
- Supports custom hooks like "check" and "fix" for manual runs
- Implements stashing strategies for git hooks
- Handles concurrent step execution with proper locking

**Step Execution (src/step/):**
- Steps are individual linting/formatting tasks
- Each step can have: check, fix, shell commands
- Steps support glob patterns for file filtering
- Steps can depend on other steps
- Steps use read/write file locks to prevent conflicts

**File Locking (src/file_rw_locks.rs):**
- Implements a sophisticated file locking system
- Allows multiple readers or single writer per file
- Prevents race conditions during concurrent execution
- Critical for maximizing parallelism

**Built-in Linters (pkl/builtins/):**
- Extensive library of pre-configured linters and formatters
- Each builtin is a Pkl file defining step configuration
- Used via `Builtins.linter_name` in hk.pkl

**CLI Interface (src/cli/):**
- Subcommands: init, install, uninstall, check, fix, run, validate, config
- Uses clap for argument parsing
- Supports running specific hooks or steps

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Concurrent Execution:** Steps run in parallel when possible, using tokio for async runtime
2. **File-based Coordination:** Uses file locks instead of in-memory coordination for cross-process safety
3. **Pluggable Configuration:** Pkl-based config allows easy extension and customization
4. **Progressive Enhancement:** Works with or without git, libgit2, mise, etc.

### Integration Points

- **Git Integration:** Can use either libgit2 or shell git commands (controlled by `HK_LIBGIT2` env var, default: true)
- **Mise Integration:** Deeply integrated with mise for task running and tool management
- **Tool Discovery:** Automatically finds tools via PATH or mise shims

### Testing

Bats integration tests are in `test/*.bats`. Each test file uses a common setup pattern:
```bash
setup() {
    load 'test_helper/common_setup'
    _common_setup
}
```
Tests run in isolated temp directories with a clean git repo. The `$PKL_PATH` variable points to the pkl config directory for amending `Config.pkl`.

#### Testing Builtins

Builtins should have pkl-level tests defined via the `tests` field on the Step (see `pkl/Config.pkl` `StepTest`). These tests are run by `hk test` and exercised in CI via `test/builtins_tests.bats`, which loads all builtins and runs their tests.

**Tool stubs** in `test/builtin_tool_stubs/` use `mise tool-stub` to auto-install the correct tool version on demand. Each stub is a small script:
```bash
