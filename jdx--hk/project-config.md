# Coding agents

hk gives coding agents a narrow, inspectable way to run project checks and fixes. Agents can use structured CLI output everywhere, or the MCP server for persistent runs, cancellation, paged logs, diagnostics, diffs, and the interactive dashboard.

Generate a starting point without editing any host configuration:

```sh
hk agent instructions --target codex
hk agent hooks --target claude-code
hk agent mcp --target vscode
```

Claude Desktop uses global host configuration and does not reliably launch servers from the project directory. Replace `/absolute/path/to/project` in its generated snippet before installing it.

Every generator writes only to stdout. Review the result and place or merge it into the appropriate host configuration yourself.

## Safe agent workflow

1. Inspect the project and request a plan.
2. Scope execution to changed files. Use `--files0-from` when exact filenames matter and `--cd` to choose the project root.
3. Inspect command effects and prefer safe execution. `--safe` rejects a run before any step starts if a runnable command is unknown or destructive.
4. Consume JSON or JSONL diagnostics and retain raw output when investigating parser warnings.
5. Review the resulting diff before accepting a fix.

Without MCP, a portable invocation is:

```sh
{
  git diff --name-only -z
  git diff --cached --name-only -z
  git ls-files --others --exclude-standard -z
} | hk run check --files0-from - --safe --format jsonl
```

## MCP

`hk mcp --root <project>` starts a STDIO MCP server. It does not listen on a network port. The root is fixed at startup (plus roots supplied by the host), and tools cannot introduce arbitrary filesystem paths or unrestricted shell commands.

Generate configuration for a supported host:

```sh
hk agent mcp --target codex
hk agent mcp --target claude-desktop
hk agent mcp --target claude-code
hk agent mcp --target vscode
```

Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and VS Code can use the structured MCP tools. Hosts that implement MCP Apps also receive the hk dashboard; other hosts receive the same structured content and a useful text fallback.

## Rich dashboard

The dashboard shows the current run, step status and timing, normalized diagnostics grouped by file, searchable logs, and the resulting diff. Mutating actions are limited to confirmed safe fixes, and the server remains the source of truth.

See the [dashboard demo runbook](./agents/mcp-dashboard.md) for a deterministic project fixture.

## ChatGPT Desktop

ChatGPT Desktop can connect the local STDIO server through OpenAI's [Secure MCP Tunnel](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/secure-mcp-tunnels). Build hk, create the demo fixture, and initialize a local-STDIO tunnel whose MCP command is the absolute `hk mcp --root <fixture>` command. Run `tunnel-client doctor` before starting the tunnel, then create a development-mode app in ChatGPT and select the tunnel.

The tunnel is a development bridge. hk itself ships no HTTP listener, hosted service, or authentication system.

## Instructions and hooks

Use `hk agent instructions` for a concise block suitable for `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or a generic agent prompt. Use `hk agent hooks` for an optional Codex or Claude Code stop hook, or a VS Code task. Hook output is deliberately a snippet rather than an automatic installation: inspect its effect on your workflow before enabling it.
