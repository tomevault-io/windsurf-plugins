# AGENTS.md

This file is the working contract for AI coding agents in this repository. Keep
changes narrow, preserve existing runtime behavior, and never use real operator
credentials as fixtures or examples.

## Project Scope

Grok Register + Live Panel is a Camoufox-based registration workflow with a
local operations panel. It is intended for authorized research, integration,
and personal environments. Do not add features intended to evade access
controls, scrape or distribute third-party proxies, or conceal unauthorized
bulk abuse.

## Architecture And Ownership

- `register_flow.py`, `browser_session.py`, and `camoufox_adapter.py` own the
  browser registration flow, session lifecycle, exit checks, and Camoufox
  integration.
- `run_batch_headless.py` starts a batch. `batch_supervisor.py` supervises its
  child process, restarts driver crashes or idle runs, and resumes only the
  remaining slots through an atomic progress file.
- `run_until_100.py` owns multi-batch orchestration and runtime control state.
- `sso_to_auth_json.py` owns SSO/device OAuth conversion and CPA/Grok2API auth
  output. Successful output is not rolled back when a later slot fails.
- `email_providers/` contains provider adapters. Keep provider-specific API
  behavior there instead of branching throughout the registration flow.
- `webui/monitor.py` owns the HTTP server and embedded UI. Its focused stores
  and operations live in `webui/*_store.py` and `webui/*_ops.py`.
- `webui/proxy_store.py` owns proxy import, normalization, health, cooldown, and
  redacted API views. `webui/email_provider_store.py` owns provider config and
  secret-preserving updates. `webui/email_domain_store.py` owns domain rotation
  and rejection state.
- `runtime_platform.py` owns interpreter discovery, Xvfb selection, and process
  group flags. `webui/process_utils.py` owns project-scoped process discovery
  and termination.
- `static_asset_cache.py` is opt-in infrastructure. Its default-off behavior and
  request exclusions are security boundaries, not implementation details.
- `batch_traffic.py` owns the per-batch loopback proxy meter and aggregate byte
  state. It must never persist upstream proxy URLs, credentials, or content.

## Runtime Flows

1. A CLI or the panel starts `run_batch_headless.py` directly, or starts
   `run_until_100.py` for multiple rounds.
2. The supervisor isolates each browser batch and resumes incomplete work after
   a recoverable driver crash or idle timeout.
3. A worker selects an enabled, healthy proxy and keeps that same proxy for one
   account across registration, SSO, and OAuth.
4. Email provider/domain selection occurs before the registration form. Only an
   explicit xAI domain rejection increments domain rejection state.
5. Successful SSO can be converted to CPA/Grok2API auth. BFS detection is a JWT
   claim check separate from `botFlagSource` and policy denial.
6. The panel reads JSON/runtime state and controls only processes whose command
   line resolves to this project root.

## Setup And Run

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m camoufox fetch
cp config.example.json config.json

MONITOR_TOKEN="$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')" \
MONITOR_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
PANEL_INCLUDE_TAIL=0 \
  .venv/bin/python -u webui/monitor.py
```

For a headless Linux batch use:

```bash
xvfb-run -a .venv/bin/python -u run_batch_headless.py 20 3
```

Linux graphical sessions and macOS run the Python entry point directly.
Windows process management is supported, but the browser batch remains
experimental.

## Required Verification

Run the full repository check for every code or UI change:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN=.venv/bin/python scripts/run_tests.sh
git diff --check
```

Before deployment also run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip check
.venv/bin/python -m camoufox version
.venv/bin/python scripts/harden_runtime_permissions.py .
```

Add or update a focused test under `tests/` when behavior changes. The release
script intentionally uses direct Python test files, `compileall`, shell syntax
checks, and `git diff --check`; do not assume pytest is required.

For UI changes, review desktop and mobile layouts in light and dark themes.
Verify that operational API calls still require authentication and that no
credential appears in rendered HTML, JSON responses, console output, or
screenshots.

## Authentication And HTTP Rules

- `GET /` and `GET /api/health` are anonymous and must not expose runtime data.
- Operational GET endpoints require a token when `MONITOR_TOKEN` is configured.
- Every POST, PATCH, and DELETE operation requires `MONITOR_TOKEN`; an unset
  token does not make write operations public.
- Accept tokens through `Authorization: Bearer` or `X-Monitor-Token`. Never add
  token query parameters, include tokens in URLs, or log request headers.
- A non-loopback panel bind requires a strong token. Prefer an exact loopback,
  LAN, or Tailscale address over `0.0.0.0`.
- Keep CSP, frame denial, referrer policy, request-size limits, and the absence
  of wildcard CORS intact unless a reviewed design explicitly replaces them.
- `PANEL_INCLUDE_TAIL` defaults to `0`. Raw log tails can contain sensitive
