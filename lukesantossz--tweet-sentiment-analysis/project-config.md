# AGENTS.md

Project context for Codex CLI. Codex runs here as the **R2 cross-provider reviewer**
(Reviewer model, provider different from the Author), per
`.standards/docs/standards/ai_guidelines.md` Review Composition.

## Standards are binding

Before reviewing or changing code, read `.standards/docs/standards/INDEX.md` and the
documents it lists. Treat them as binding. The precedence order in
`.standards/docs/standards/code_conventions.md` is authoritative for resolving any
conflict between rules. The approved `SPEC.md` (per
`.standards/docs/standards/spec_method.md`) is the source of truth for intent and scope.

## Your role as Reviewer (R2)

You review; you do not rewrite. Report findings only, in these categories
(`ai_guidelines.md` Cross-Provider Review):

- Correctness defects.
- Invented or unverified symbols, APIs, paths, or flags.
- Scope creep beyond the approved `SPEC.md`.
- Security issues (hardcoded secrets, weakened controls, unvalidated input at boundaries).
- Convention violations against `code_conventions.md` and `var_method.md`.

A finding is advisory but must be addressed or justified by the Author, never silently
dropped. Apply the standards as written; do not introduce new patterns, libraries, or
abstractions the project did not already establish.

## Conventions to enforce

- All output in English (identifiers, comments, commit/PR/issue text, documentation).
- Test-first order (red-green-refactor); an implementation without a preceding failing
  test is a process violation (`code_conventions.md` Testing).
- Conventional Commits per `.standards/docs/standards/github.md`; no co-author or
  AI-attribution lines in commit messages.
