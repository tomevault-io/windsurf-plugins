# Rules

1. Do not add verbose comments.
   - Only write comments or doc comments when they are absolutely necessary to explain a gotcha, SwiftUI bug, or workaround.
   - Opt for self explanatory class/struct/enum/function names instead.
2. Do not create large .swift files.
   - Separate large classes/enums/structs using extensions, grouped into its own folder.
   - Avoid view builders if they are long. Separate the views and create their own .swift files.
3. Do not use single or double letter variable names. Spell all variable names out in full (time instead of t, xPosition instead of x).
4. After you've added localization keys, always localize for every langauge possible.
   - Generate the object for each string in a separate file, then use Python to set the object as the value for localization keys in the xcstrings file.
   - Do not make large edits.
   - Do not generate localization strings as part of Python scripts.
   - Remember to clean up these working files after you're done.
5. Ensure that you properly mark out MainActor or nonisolated functions to comply with Swift 6 concurrency checking.
6. Ensure that you fix all SwiftLint errors, except when:
  - log(:_, :_) patterns are concerned - use // swiftlint:disable:next line_length to disable warnings/errors for these lines.
  - Identifier names are deliberately short - e.g. for 2 letter HTML element names or X - use // swiftlint:disable:this identifier_name to disable warnings/errors.
  - iCloud, iPhone, or iPad is the first name in the type - use // swiftlint:disable:next type_name to disable warnings/errors.

# Copywriting

- Always use 'Web Feeds' when referring to the Petal feature
- Always use the term 'content' and never 'article', 'article' is used internally only
