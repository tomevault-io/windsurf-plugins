# Skill maintenance

When you change any of the following, update the corresponding skill(s) in `.cursor/skills/` and briefly mention in your response that skills were updated.

| Change | Update these skills |
|--------|----------------------|
| Key dependencies (WXT, Svelte, Playwright, changesets, oxlint, dprint) or build/config (wxt.config.ts, .oxlintrc.json) | wxt-svelte-extension (SKILL.md; reference.md if a new known issue) |
| package.json scripts (dev/build/zip) or new build targets | wxt-svelte-extension, releases-changesets if release steps change |
| E2E layout (e2e/tests, e2e/pages, fixture file path or name) | e2e-playwright-extension |
| Release workflow (.changeset/, release steps, workflow_dispatch) | releases-changesets |
| Issue refinement format or label set (issue-refinement-triage template) | issue-refinement-triage |
| New recurring “known issue” that should guide extension code | wxt-svelte-extension/reference.md |

Read the current skill file before editing so the update stays consistent with existing structure and wording.
