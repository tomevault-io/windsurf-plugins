# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with the codebase.

## Project Overview

The root project folder contains the following application:

```yml
backend:
    stack: python, uv, fastapi, langchain, read pyproject.toml for more information.
    description: This is the REST API for the ./frontend and ./cli clients.
    deployment: https://chat.ruska.ai/docs
    commands:
        - `make test` Run ALL test cases (uses ENV_FILE=~/.env/orchestra/.env.backend).
        - `make test ENV_FILE=~/.env/orchestra/.env.backend.test` Run tests with test env.
        - `make format` Format project files with ruff. Use after making changes.
        - `make lint` Lint check with ruff (no auto-fix).
        - `make dev` Run dev server.
        - `make seeds.user` Seed default users.
frontend:
    stack: typescript, vite, react, shadcn, tailwind, read package.json for more details.
    description: This is built during CI and bundled into the backend during `.github/build.yml`
    deployment: https://chat.ruska.ai
    commands: See package.json
website:
    stack: typescript, nextjs, shadcn
    description: Our main landing page
    url: https://ruska.ai
    commands: See package.json
wiki:
    stack: typescript, react, docusaurus
    description: Documentation for how to use the application interface of frontend and api of backend.
    url: https://docs.ruska.ai
    commands: See package.json
cli:
    stack: typescript, react-ink
    description: New server-side client we are working on for perform actions against the API
    commands: See package.json
```

The main way external AI Agents find out information about RUSKA will be from the `./website/public/llm.txt` that should ALWAYS reflect the current public documentation for LLM search engines. If something in the application is out of sync with this file we should make sure to update the file the `llm.txt` so that it reflects the most accurate picture of the application and how users can get the MOST out of it.

## Code Style

- Use Python 3.12+ features
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Type hints required for all functions
- Use Pydantic for data validation

# Repository Guidelines for Orchestra

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `backend/src` contains the FastAPI stack, with domain logic split into `controllers`, `routes`, `services`, and `repos`, plus shared helpers in `common` and `utils`.
- Database assets live in `backend/migrations` and `backend/seeds`; reusable automation sits under `backend/scripts`.
- `frontend/src` hosts the Vite/React client (`components`, `pages`, `routes`, `tests`), while `decks/`, `deployment/`, and `docker/` hold reference material and ops tooling.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- **Setup**: Run `make setup` from the repo root to install pre-commit hooks.
- Backend: `cd backend && uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv sync` installs dependencies, `make dev` runs the API with reload, and `make test` executes the suite. Use `ENV_FILE=~/.env/orchestra/.env.backend.test` for the test environment.
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`, `npm run dev` for local dev, `npm run build` for production bundles, and `npm run docs` regenerates MkDocs API docs.
- Infrastructure: `docker compose up postgres pgadmin` provisions Postgres + PgAdmin; stop with `docker compose down`.

## Docker Development Environment
- **When to use**: Backend development requiring all API services (backend, worker, postgres, redis, search) running together via `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
- **Start the stack**: `make dev.docker.up` — builds and starts all services in detached mode.
  - Override env files: `make dev.docker.up BACKEND_ENV_FILE=/path/to/.env`
  - Default: `./backend/.env.docker.dev`
- **Services and ports**:
  - `backend` — :8000 (FastAPI with hot-reload)
  - `worker` — TaskIQ worker (auto-reloads on code changes)
  - `postgres` — :5432 (pgvector/pg16)
  - `redis` — :6379
  - `search_engine` — :8080 (SearXNG)
  - `dozzle` — :8088 (container log viewer)
- **Frontend**: Run from the host (`cd frontend && npm run dev`) and connect to the backend API on :8000. Use the `agent-browser` skill for browser-based testing.
- **Management commands**:
  - `make dev.docker.logs` — tail logs for all services (override with `DOCKER_DEV_LOG_SERVICES="backend worker"`)
  - `make dev.docker.ps` — show running containers
  - `make dev.docker.down` — stop and clean up
  - `make dev.docker.migrate` — run Alembic migrations inside the backend container
- **Optional sandbox**: `COMPOSE_PROFILES=tools make dev.docker.up` starts `exec_server` on :3005 for sandboxed code execution.
- **Key details**: Source directories are volume-mounted for hot-reload. Backend runs `uv sync` and `alembic upgrade head` on startup automatically.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files`; hooks run backend format/lint/test and frontend prettier/lint/test.
- Python: ruff configured in `backend/pyproject.toml` with `line-length = 120`, select `["E", "F"]`. Per-file E402 ignores for files with `load_dotenv()` before imports. Use 4-space indents, `snake_case` files, typed Pydantic models in `backend/src/schemas`.
- React: Prettier 2-space indent; components in `PascalCase`, hooks in `camelCase`.
