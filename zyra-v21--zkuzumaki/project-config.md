- **General Principles**
    - Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy vulnerabilities.
    - Use the latest stable Solidity version (currently `^0.8.20` as defined in contracts). Keep pragma version consistent across all contracts.
    - Prioritize security and clarity over micro-optimizations, but be mindful of gas costs.

- **Naming Conventions**
    - `UpperCamelCase` for contracts, interfaces, libraries (e.g., `ZKMixer`, `IVerifier`, `PoseidonT3`).
    - `mixedCase` for functions, state variables, local variables, and parameters (e.g., `deposit`, `merkleRoot`, `_commitment`).
    - `ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE` for constants (e.g., `DENOMINATION`, `MERKLE_TREE_HEIGHT`, `ZERO_VALUE`).
    - `UpperCamelCase` for events (e.g., `Deposit`, `Withdrawal`).
    - `UpperCamelCase` for custom errors (e.g., `InvalidProof`, `NullifierAlreadySpent`).
    - Prepend parameters with an underscore (`_`) (e.g., `_commitment`, `_recipient`).

- **Code Structure & Layout**
    - Order within contracts: Interfaces/Libraries imports, Type declarations, State variables, Events, Modifiers, Constructor, receive/fallback functions, external functions, public functions, internal functions, private functions.
    - Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).

- **Security Best Practices**
    - **Input Validation**: Use `require()` statements with descriptive messages or custom errors for validating inputs and state conditions at the beginning of functions.
        ```solidity
        // ✅ DO
        require(_commitment != bytes32(0), "Commitment cannot be zero");
        // OR
        if (_commitment == bytes32(0)) revert InvalidCommitment();
        ```
    - **Access Control**: Implement access control where necessary (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`).
    - **Reentrancy**: Adhere strictly to Checks-Effects-Interactions. Use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` if complex external calls are unavoidable.
    - **Arithmetic**: Rely on Solidity >=0.8 default checked arithmetic. Be explicit with `unchecked` blocks only when overflow/underflow is impossible or intended and clearly documented.

- **Gas Optimization**
    - Minimize state variable writes (`SSTORE` is expensive).
    - Use `immutable` for variables set only in the constructor (like `verifier`, `poseidonHasherAddress` if used).
    - Use `constant` for true compile-time constants.
    - Prefer `calldata` over `memory` for external function parameters where possible (especially for large data like proofs).
    - Cache state variables in local memory variables if read multiple times within a function.

- **Error Handling**
    - Prefer custom errors over `require` strings for better gas efficiency and clearer error identification off-chain.
        ```solidity
        // ✅ DO
        error InvalidProof();
        // ...
        if (!verifier.verifyProof(...)) revert InvalidProof();

        // ❌ DON'T (Less gas efficient)
        // require(verifier.verifyProof(...), "Invalid ZK proof");
        ```

- **Documentation (NatSpec)**
    - Use NatSpec comments (`///` or `/** ... */`) for all public/external contracts, interfaces, functions, events, and state variables.
    - Include `@title`, `@notice`, `@dev`, `@param`, `@return`.
    - Explain the purpose and logic clearly.

- **Testing**
    - Aim for high test coverage using Hardhat (Mocha/Chai).
    - Test edge cases, access control, failure conditions (reverts), and event emissions.
    - **Hash Consistency Test:** Include tests specifically verifying that the hash function used in Solidity (e.g., `PoseidonT3.hash`) produces the **exact same output** as the hash function used in JavaScript tests (e.g., from `circomlibjs`) for known inputs (e.g., `H(0,0)`, `H(1,2)`). This catches crucial implementation discrepancies early.
    - Use mocks for external dependencies (like `IVerifier`) *only* for isolated unit tests.

- **Dependencies & Libraries**
    - Use audited and well-maintained libraries like OpenZeppelin (`@openzeppelin/contracts`).
    - Specify dependency versions clearly in `package.json`.
    - **Crypto Libraries (e.g., Poseidon):**
        - **Prefer Local Copy & Static Linking:** For critical cryptographic libraries needed by contracts (like Poseidon), **copy the library source code** (e.g., `PoseidonT3.sol`) into the local `contracts/libraries/` directory.
        - **Import Locally:** Import the library using a relative path (e.g., `import "./libraries/PoseidonT3.sol";`).
        - **Call Statically:** Call library functions statically (`PoseidonT3.hash(...)`) within the contract. Mark contract functions using them as `pure` or `view` accordingly.
        - **Link in Deployment/Tests:** Use Hardhat's library linking mechand tests to link the contract with the deployed library address (e.g., `getContractFactory("ZKMixer", { libraries: { PoseidonT3: deployedPoseidonLibAddress } })`).
        - This pattern avoids potential issues with calling external contracts via address and resolves linking ambiguities.
