# Repository Instructions

## Scope

Treat `skill/chemdraw/` as the deployable agent Skill and the source of truth for runtime behavior. Root Markdown is intentionally limited to `README.md`, its `README.zh-cn.md` translation, and `AGENTS.md`. Put detailed project guidance and direct translations in `docs/`, and GitHub-only policy in `.github/`; do not create standalone changelog, support, conduct, notice, or release ledgers when an existing authoritative section or GitHub feature is sufficient. Do not add repository-facing documents inside the deployable Skill.

## Skill Design

- Keep `SKILL.md` concise and route detail to one-level references.
- Preserve the progressive path: metadata -> core rules/router -> workflow/domain guide -> generated signatures -> inventory shards.
- Keep exact MCP signatures generated in `references/mcp-signatures.md`; do not duplicate handwritten signatures elsewhere.
- Preserve existing public tool names unless a documented breaking release is intentional.
- Keep chemistry grounded: do not invent or hand-edit SMILES, do not silently resolve ambiguous OCSR, and do not overwrite source artifacts.
- For image-recognition tasks, use DECIMER API directly with `confirm_upload=true`; do not add a separate upload-confirmation question. Respect explicit local/offline or no-upload requests. Keep the low-level no-upload preflight available for callers that request it.

## Changes

- Add or update a failing test before changing behavior.
- Use deterministic parsers/APIs instead of ad hoc text rewriting.
- Keep machine-specific paths, credentials, user data, generated caches, and proprietary test artifacts out of Git.
- Regenerate generated references after changing registry signatures:

```powershell
python .\skill\chemdraw\scripts\generate_tool_reference.py
python .\skill\chemdraw\scripts\audit_toolkit_interfaces.py --output-dir .\skill\chemdraw\references
```

## Verification

Run portable validation for every change:

```powershell
python .\scripts\validate_distribution.py
```

Run the full suite in a Python environment containing `cdxml-toolkit`:

```powershell
python -m pytest skill/chemdraw/scripts -q
.\skill\chemdraw\scripts\health_check.ps1 -SkipNativeChemDraw
```

For native or Office changes, also validate with an activated ChemDraw installation, native PNG rendering, and open/render checks for DOCX/PPTX outputs. Never report those gates as passed when they were skipped.

## Public-facing language

Write public documentation and example captions for readers without conversation history. Do not expose internal experiment identifiers, development stage names, handoff notes, session references or intermediate work logs. Explain technical terms when they help users; retain exact API names, scientific notation, paper compound numbering and necessary compatibility/version requirements. Keep test data identifiers out of homepage artwork and marketing examples.

## Language

Use English for all Skill instructions, references, scripts, and repository documentation except `README.zh-cn.md`. Keep non-ASCII test fixtures as Unicode escapes when needed to preserve test behavior.
