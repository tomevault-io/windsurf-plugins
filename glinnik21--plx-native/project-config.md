# Project instructions

## Project

PlxNative is a production-quality native Plex client for rooted LG webOS 4.5 TVs. Most of the
application is Rust under `rust-modules/src/`; `src/main.c` is the boot/crash shim,
`src/starfish.c` is the StarfishMediaAPIs/ACB seam, and `src/svg.c` rasterizes SVGs. Keep changes
properly factored and finished; "only a demo" is never a reason to leave a shortcut behind.

The target is a cross-compiled 32-bit ARM application with a hardware video plane. Host tests and
the macOS simulator are valuable, but they cannot prove every device behavior.

## Load the right context

- `docs/agent-reference.md` is the detailed architecture, build, portability, and verification
  reference. Read the relevant section before changing a subsystem; do not load the whole file
  when a narrower section is enough.
- Before playback work, read `rust-modules/src/player/CLAUDE.md`.
- Before Plex data-layer work, read `rust-modules/src/plex/CLAUDE.md` and `docs/pms-api.md`.
- Before UI work, read `rust-modules/src/ui/CLAUDE.md` and use the shared theme, layout, and widget
  systems instead of adding screen-local visual primitives.
- Repository skills live in `.agents/skills/`. Use the matching skill whenever its description
  fits the task; the TV, simulator, FFI, release, and verification workflows have non-obvious
  constraints that generic commands miss.

## Working rules

- **Trunk-based development, and `main` takes SQUASH merges only.** Work happens on short-lived
  branches or worktrees cut from `main`; when a piece of work is verified it lands on `main` as ONE
  commit (`git merge --squash <branch>` on `main`, then a single commit whose message is the
  change's own account), never as a fast-forward of a working branch's history and never as a
  merge commit. A fleet of lanes integrates into its integration branch however it likes; what
  reaches `main` is the squash of the whole. The reason is the history itself: `main` is read by
  `git log`, by the release audit and by `git bisect`, and a trunk of "fix typo" / "wip" / merge
  commits pollutes all three. Push `main` only when the user asked for it.
- Preserve unrelated user changes and generated artifacts. Never clean or reset a dirty tree to
  make a task easier.
- This repository is public. Never publish values from gitignored private files such as `.tv-host`,
  `.tv-mac`, `src/config.local.h`, `tests/manifest.local.json`, `pkg/auth.json`, `pkg/lab.json`, or
  the other paths enumerated by `.claude/hooks/outbound-guard.py`. Use the documented placeholders.
- webOS native behavior is under-documented. When an answer depends on platform behavior, verify it
  from primary documentation, vendored source, firmware inventories, or the device binaries; do not
  infer behavior from a symbol name or from a webOS web-app example.
- Fixing a reported bug starts with a regression test or reproducible artifact that fails against
  the broken behavior. Observe the failure, implement the fix, then observe it pass.
- Do not use `make -p` or `make -pn`; recursive variables such as `TV` are misleading there. Use
  the `make -s print-*` query targets documented in `docs/agent-reference.md`.

## Build and verification

- `make check` runs the fast host unit suite and lint gate. Use it for ordinary Rust changes.
- `make` performs the ARM cross-build. Do not assume a host-only green result proves the target
  still builds.
- After editing `rust-modules/src/**/*.rs`, also check the shipping feature set with
  `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo +nightly check --manifest-path rust-modules/Cargo.toml --lib
  --no-default-features` when the Claude-only release hook did not run. The prefix is not
  decoration: this command is the one cargo invocation here that does NOT go through `make`, so it
  is the one place the Makefile's linked-worktree `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` cannot reach — and a
  one-shot gate has nothing to reuse a multi-gigabyte cache for.
- **`make disk` before and after a fleet.** Build trees are per-checkout and were never collected;
  twelve lanes reached 45 GB with 3.2 GiB free on 2026-09-03. `tools/build-gc.sh
  --incremental|--lanes|--all` reclaims them and deletes nothing `make` cannot rebuild. Note what
  the measurement says rather than what everyone assumes: the cargo **incremental cache** was 24 GB
  of that, FFmpeg 2.6 GB. **Run `tools/build-gc.sh --orphans` after tearing a fleet down** — lane
  target dirs live outside the repo (`$PLX_FLEET_DIR`) and outlive their worktree; 36 GB of them
  had accumulated unseen.
- Use the `which-tier` skill to choose between host checks, `ui-sim`, and real-device verification.
  Pixel output, LG text rasterization, video-plane composition, performance, and native playback
  generally need the TV before being called verified.
- FFI, linkage, `dynlib!`, Starfish, ACB, curl, or bundled-FFmpeg changes require the
  `fw_compat_reviewer` custom agent (or the equivalent manual review) before push.
- After behavior changes, use the `doc_claim_auditor` custom agent (or perform the same audit) to
  find prose that the change made false. It reports contradictions, not missing documentation.
