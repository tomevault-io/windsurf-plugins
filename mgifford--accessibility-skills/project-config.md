# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Instructions

This file provides guidance for AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, and others) working on this repository.

## About This Repository

This repository contains **AI agent skills** for web accessibility work — distilled, agent-actionable rules derived from accessibility best-practice guides. Each skill in `skills/` covers a specific topic (forms, keyboard navigation, color contrast, etc.).

## General Accessibility Principles

When contributing to or using this repository, always follow these principles:

- **Follow WCAG 2.2 AA** as the baseline standard for all accessibility guidance.
- **Prefer semantic HTML** over ARIA engineering. Native elements (`<button>`, `<dialog>`, `<details>`) carry built-in accessibility semantics.
- **ARIA supplements HTML** — it does not replace it. Only use ARIA when a native element cannot meet the need.
- **Test with real assistive technologies** — screen readers, keyboard-only navigation, and zoom at 200 %.
- **Plain language** — write content at the lowest reading level appropriate for the audience.
