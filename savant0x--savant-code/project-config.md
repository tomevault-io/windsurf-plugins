# Savant-Code

Savant-Code is the multi-agent AI coding assistant built on the ECHO Protocol v0.2.0.

> **All work is governed by [ECHO Protocol](ECHO.md).** No code is written without a FID that has converged through the
  Perfection Loop.

## Key Technologies

- **TypeScript monorepo** (`strict: true`, `noImplicitReturns: true`)
- **Bun runtime + package manager** (≥ 1.3.11; root pins `1.3.14` per `engines.bun`)
- **OpenTUI + React CLI** (`@opentui/core` 0.5.3, `react` ^19)
- **JS/TS SDK** — embeddable via `SavantClient`
- **Composable agent runtime** — ECHO 10-agent roster with separation of duties
- **ECHO Protocol v0.2.0** — single bootstrap file

## Agent Roster (10 canonical ECHO roles)

The 10-agent roster is enforced in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Each agent has restricted tools. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) → "Helper Tool Libraries" for the distinction between the 10 runtime roles and the
filesystem entries in `agents/`.

| Agent | Phase | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | ALL | Routes work, enforces protocol, spawns agents |
| Detective | RED | Codebase analysis + grep call-graphs |
| Forge | GREEN | Implementation only — writes code from converged FID |
| Verifier | AUDIT | Double-audit, run tests, check call-graph, cite `file:line` evidence |
| Recorder | FID | Create, track, archive FIDs. Update CHANGELOG. |
| Thinker | Planning | Sequential reasoning via `sequentialthinking` tool |
| Scout | Explore | Glob/list_directory/read_files for context gathering |
| Researcher | Research | Web search + docs lookup |
| Scribe | Docs | Session summaries, LESSONS.md, knowledge files |
| Adversary | ADVERSARIAL | Meta-verification: refutes Verifier FAILs, re-audits unevidenced PASSes, verdicts override (FID-2026-0805-004) |

## Repo Map

| Workspace | Package | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `agents/` | `@savant-code/agents` | Public agent definitions shipped with the CLI (10 canonical + 6 helper tool-library/trace dirs) |
| `cli/` | `@savant-code/cli` | CLI source — UI, commands, state, hooks, OpenTUI/React components |
| `common/` | `@savant-code/common` | Shared types, tool definitions, utilities |
| `evals/` | `@savant-code/evals` | Eval benchmark runner + public eval fixtures |
| `savant-free/` | `@savant-code/savant-free` | CLI release + e2e tests for the free variant |
| `desktop/` | `@savant-code/desktop` | Tauri v2 desktop shell — Rust sidecar supervisor, React 19 renderer, 3D command deck |
| `packages/database/` | `@savant-code/database` | Database abstraction layer |
| `packages/agent-runtime/` | `@savant-code/agent-runtime` | Agent loop, tool executor, LLM API integration |
| `packages/code-map/` | `@savant-code/code-map` | tree-sitter code indexing, language detection |
| `packages/knowledge-graph/` | `@savant-code/knowledge-graph` | Deterministic codebase knowledge-graph engine (indexer, queries, clustering, export serializer) |
| `packages/llm-providers/` | `@savant-code/llm-providers` | Public LLM provider shims |
| `sdk/` | `@savant-code/sdk` | Public SDK — `SavantClient`, types, build + verify scripts |

## Conventions

- Use `bun install` and `bun run`.
- Prefer dependency injection over module mocking.
- Run interactive CLI tests in tmux.
- Do not force-push `main`.
- The full typecheck gate must pass before any merge: `bun run typecheck` (chains all 12 workspaces).
- New FIDs follow the format `dev/fids/FID-YYYY-MMDD-NNN-{title}.md`.

## Self-Improving Harness (FID-2026-0824-012)

Savant learns from its own failures and authors its own skills — under strict
operator governance. The agent can explain/demonstrate this on prompting;
key facts:

- **Mechanical capture** — `protocol.config.yaml` declares a
  `PostToolUseFailure` hook with `action: experience-capture` (in-process,
  fail-open): every tool failure appends one immutable record to
  `dev/experiences/raw-traces.jsonl` (never boot-read; context-hashed inputs;
