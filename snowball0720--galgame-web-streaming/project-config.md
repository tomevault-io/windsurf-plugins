# Agent deployment instructions

This repository is only for deploying a browser-accessible Windows galgame/visual-novel environment on the VPS where it was cloned. It is not a general Windows gaming or cloud-gaming setup and does not target other game genres such as action or real-time games. Treat `DEPLOYMENT.md` as the operational runbook and the checked-in Compose, Docker, Xorg, desktop, and Nginx files as templates to adapt to the actual host. Wine compatibility varies by title, so do not promise that every galgame will run.

## Work autonomously

- Inspect the host and this repository before changing anything. Use `scripts/preflight.sh` and read `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Complete routine, reversible setup without asking for confirmation. Back up host configuration before editing it.
- Do not assume the VPS architecture, GPU, distribution, domain, public address, existing firewall, or galgame executable from these examples.
- Keep the deployment and launcher scoped to the user's galgame. If asked to set up a non-galgame title, state that this repository is not designed or validated for it; do not present the result as a general game streaming server.
- If a required user-specific value is missing, gather the missing items in one concise question: domain, whether DNS already points to this VPS, galgame directory and executable, and any credentials needed to access those files. Do useful host inspection while waiting.
- Never print passwords, write them to shell history, or commit `.env`. Ask the user to enter passwords into `.env` through the available secure workflow. Set `.env` permissions to `0600`.
- Galgame binaries and archives are user-provided data. Do not download or redistribute commercial galgame files. Do not put them in the Docker build context or Git history.
- Do not replace an existing public web server, firewall policy, or unrelated Docker service blindly. Inspect it, make a narrow change, and preserve a rollback copy.

## Deployment outcome

When required values are available, finish the deployment rather than stopping at a plan:

1. Verify architecture and host capabilities. Prefer Linux x86-64 with the primary `Dockerfile`/`compose.yaml`. For ARM64, read `ARM64-EXPERIMENTAL.md` and use its separate files only after clearly explaining the slower, less compatible Box64/Box32 path; do not silently select it when an x86-64 option is available.
2. Install or verify Docker Engine and Compose for the host distribution.
3. Prepare `.env`, private galgame/prefix directories, the selected renderer/encoder access (Intel GPU or documented software fallback), and firewall rules. Keep Neko's HTTP port bound to loopback; expose WebRTC UDP 443 and serve the web UI behind HTTPS.
4. Build and start the Neko container. Check Compose status, container health endpoint, logs, and the selected rendering/encoding path. Validate VA-API only when using the Intel configuration.
5. Configure Nginx and a valid TLS certificate for the user's domain. Check the Nginx configuration before reloading it.
6. Create a galgame-specific desktop launcher using the actual executable path and correct Wine architecture. Initialize a persistent Wine prefix, start the galgame, and verify browser video, input, audio, and save persistence where the galgame permits.
7. Recheck restart behavior and report the URL, service state, verified GPU paths, unresolved galgame-specific compatibility issues, and backup/config locations. Never include secrets in the report.

Ask before an action only if it is irreversible, would disrupt an unrelated service, or requires a decision the host and repository cannot establish. Opening the ports and installing this service are implied by an explicit request to deploy it.
