# Fishword Project Guide

## Project Overview

Fishword is a local vocabulary learning project centered on a Rust CLI. The CLI
is the stable integration boundary for the Pi extension, npm packages, and
future terminal/editor integrations.

The project currently supports:

- SQLite-backed decks, cards, card state, settings, and review logs
- Importing Qwerty Learner JSON, fishword deck JSONL, CSV, and Anki TSV
- kajweb/dict JSONL dictionaries converted into Fishword's deck.v1 JSONL format
- FSRS-based review scheduling
- Card selection through `current`; `rate` records a review and returns the next card in JSON output
- Stable JSON protocol output for frontend integrations
- npm-distributed CLI wrapper and Pi extension packages

## CLI Role

The CLI is the public boundary of the system. Frontends should prefer JSON
protocol commands instead of parsing human-readable text.

Common command flow:

```bash
fishword init
fishword deck create CET-4 --description "大学英语四级" --json
fishword import jsonl assets/dicts/kajweb/cet4.jsonl --deck <numeric-deck-id>
fishword current --json
fishword rate good --json
```

Important CLI details:

- `import` currently takes a numeric deck id via `--deck`; create or list decks first.
- There is no standalone `next` command in the current CLI. Use `current` to select/show the current card, and `rate again|hard|good|easy --json` to record a review and receive the next card.
- Human-readable output remains available for manual testing, for example:

```bash
fishword current --format plain
fishword current --format compact
fishword current --format status
fishword status --format statusline
```

## Core Crates

### `crates/fishword-core`

Contains reusable domain logic:

- `card`: card, meaning, pronunciation, review state, rating, and source models
- `deck`: deck model
- `storage`: SQLite persistence, migrations, settings, current-card state, review logs
- `importer`: Qwerty JSON, deck.v1 JSONL, CSV, and Anki TSV importers
- `scheduler`: FSRS review scheduling
- `selector`: current-card and next-card selection policy
- `protocol`: stable JSON DTOs for frontend consumers

### `crates/fishword-cli`

Contains the command-line interface. Keep it thin and delegate domain work to
`fishword-core`.

## npm Packages and Pi Extension

The JavaScript workspace is managed by pnpm under `packages/`.

- `@fishword/cli` is the JavaScript wrapper and exposes the `fishword` npm binary.
- `@fishword/cli-*` packages contain platform-specific Rust binaries.
- `@fishword/pi-extension` is the Pi extension package.

The release workflow builds Rust binaries, publishes platform CLI packages,
publishes `@fishword/cli`, builds the Pi extension, then publishes
`@fishword/pi-extension`.

The Pi extension seeds three default decks on session start:

- `CET-4`
- `CET-6`
- `TOEFL`

The seed logic lives in:

```text
packages/pi-extension/src/defaultDecks.ts
```

It is intentionally driven from the extension, not Rust `init`: the extension
knows where its npm package assets are, while the Rust CLI only receives local
file paths and imports them.

The Pi extension build copies the three default kajweb JSONL files from
`assets/dicts/kajweb/` into package-local assets:

```text
packages/pi-extension/assets/dicts/kajweb/
```

That generated `packages/pi-extension/assets/` directory is ignored by Git but
included in the npm tarball through `packages/pi-extension/package.json`.

## Dictionaries

### kajweb/dict

Converted kajweb dictionaries live under:

```text
assets/dicts/kajweb/
```

They are Fishword deck.v1 JSONL files. The conversion script is:

```bash
uv run scripts/kajweb_to_jsonl.py --book CET4 -o assets/dicts/kajweb/cet4.jsonl
```

When working with Python scripts, use `uv run` as required by this repository.

### Qwerty Learner

Qwerty Learner source dictionaries still live under:

```text
assets/dicts/qwerty-learner/dicts/
```

Keep the source notice and upstream license files under:

```text
assets/dicts/qwerty-learner/SOURCE.md
assets/dicts/qwerty-learner/upstream/LICENSE
```

### Git LFS

Dictionary data files are tracked by Git LFS:

- `assets/dicts/qwerty-learner/dicts/*.json`
- `assets/dicts/kajweb/*.jsonl`

After changing LFS patterns for already tracked files, run:

```bash
git add --renormalize <path>
```

## Data Storage

The default database path is platform-specific. On macOS it is:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/fishword/fishword.db
```

For isolated manual tests, override `HOME`:

```bash
