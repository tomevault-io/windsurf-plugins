# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository contains only the Silo Android clients. Shared Kotlin logic lives in `shared/`, Android-only playback and UI helpers live in `android-shared/`, the phone app lives in `androidApp/`, and the TV app lives in `androidTvApp/`. Android playback notes live in `docs/playback/`; utility scripts live in `scripts/`.

## Current Product Exposure

- Ebooks/Reading are phone-only. Do not expose ebooks or Reading on Android TV.
- Android mobile navigation is Home, Libraries, For You, Calendar, and Downloads only when the active profile has downloads. Video, Audio, and Reading are library modes reached through Libraries, not bottom-nav tabs.
- Android TV navigation is Home, available media-type tabs from server libraries, For You (with its Watchlist/Favorites dropdown, mirroring tvOS `.recommendations`), and Calendar, plus search and profile actions. Reading/ebooks are excluded.
- Requests is live on phone and TV, server-gated by `requests_enabled` (profile menu + search entry points, matching Apple). The Admin STATS dashboard is live for acting admins (Settings entry on both platforms, matching Apple's dashboard design); the richer admin screens (users/sessions/logs/scans) and Watch Together are not accessible — do not add them to menus without an explicit product decision.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug` builds the Android phone APK.
- `./gradlew :androidTvApp:assembleDebug` builds the Android TV APK.
- `./gradlew :androidApp:installDebug` installs the phone app on a connected emulator or device.
- `./gradlew :androidTvApp:installDebug` installs the TV app on a connected emulator or device.
- `./gradlew test` runs available Kotlin/JUnit tests.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use Kotlin 2.1, Java 21 targets, and Compose idioms. The Silo package root is `org.siloserver.silo`. Both the phone and TV apps share a single `applicationId`, `org.siloserver.silo`, so they publish as one Google Play listing (Play routes each build by manifest feature filtering — the phone build requires `android.hardware.touchscreen`; the TV build requires `android.software.leanback`). The Gradle `namespace` stays distinct per module (`org.siloserver.silo.android`, `org.siloserver.silo.tv`) so generated `R`/`BuildConfig` classes don't collide. The two artifacts use distinct versionCodes (`base*2` for phone, `base*2+1` for TV), so each release bumps both by 2 with no reuse. Releases derive the base from the marketing version plus a build number (`base = 100_000_000 + (major*10000 + minor*100 + patch)*1000 + build`), so the same version can ship repeatedly as build 1, 2, 3 the way TestFlight does — bump the build number rather than inventing a new patch version for a re-release. This repo is on the full Silo namespace cut, so do not add legacy package IDs, legacy storage names, or old-brand symbols. Kotlin classes and composables use `PascalCase`; functions and properties use `camelCase`.

## Testing Guidelines

Android tests use Kotlin test/JUnit where present, especially under `android-shared/src/androidUnitTest`. Do not add tests for small changes or UI changes unless requested. For shared logic changes, add focused tests only for critical or high-risk behavior.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit local SDK overrides, signing material, logs, tool state, generated build output, or media fixtures. A running Silo server is required for realistic auth, browsing, and playback validation.
