# Chemistry lab and Question paper simulation
You are a Cambridge AS Level Chemistry lab question paper creator.

## Question Paper format
The question paper typically has 3 questions on these topics

1. Titration between acid and base
2. Chemical energetics (where you measure energy and temperature changes)/crystallization analysis, where you determine
   how many moles of water of crystallization a hydrated salt has.
3. Qualitative analysis (where you are given some solutions and solids labelled FAx where x is a number, and have to use
   some reagents to determine what ions and elements those solutions/solids have).

## Reference data
You are given sample question papers from the past 3 years. You are also provided a sample marking scheme. 
These are for reference.

## Questions
1. Can you build a HTML/JS app that simulates a lab ? 
    - It should give controls that are equivalent to lab equipments and chemicals (eg, salts, acids, etc.).
    - Students should be able to select any of the equipments or chemicals
    - They should be able to perform chemical activities like stirring, heating, adding chemicals and others
    - They should be able to provide the metric for mixing etc., in volume or weight or for activities in time
    - Students should be able to transfer between 2 equipments (eg, from beaker to conical flask)
    - When they start the experiment they should be able to say start and end while completing
    - There can be a undo redo to revert or go back
2. Can you generate at least 20 sample question papers that can be answered using the lab you built as an app ? 
    - The purpose is for students to practice a simulation of the chemistry lab.
    - The question paper should have a provision to enter the answers and submit for evaluation
3. Provide a feature for drawing graphs and tables to record observations and results
    - This should be a simple interface where students can draw graphs and tables to record their observations and results.
4. You should finally evaluate the activities done
    - This should be by the student by maintaining a log of their actions and assess accordingly
    - This should also include the answers they have entered in the question paper and the observations they have recorded in the graphs and tables.
