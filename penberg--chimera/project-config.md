This is the Chimera repository — a light-weight sandboxing runtime that runs unmodified Linux x86-64 binaries through same-ISA dynamic binary translation. Every system call the guest makes is routed to an embedder-supplied handler (default `Passthrough`), so sandboxing policy lives in the embedder, not the runtime.

The full design lives in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Read it before making architectural decisions.

## Building and Running Chimera

- **Build**: `make build` (or `cargo build`) — produces `chimera` in the cargo target directory.
- **Run a guest binary**: `chimera run <program> [args...]`, e.g. `cargo run -q -- run /bin/ls -l`.
  - `--code-cache-size <MiB>` sets the translated-code cache capacity (default 256).
- **Example embedders** (each has a README with details):
  - `cargo run --example strace -- <program> [args...]` — syscall tracer built on the `SystemCalls` trait.
  - `cargo run --example sandbox -- --allow '<regex>' [--allow ...] <program> [args...]` — allowlist syscall sandbox; anything unmatched returns `-EPERM`.

The cargo target directory may be shared across worktrees (`scripts/cargo-target-dir` prints it), so another checkout's build can clobber the `chimera` binary — rebuild before trusting a run.

## Project Layout

Cargo virtual workspace with two member crates:

- `runtime/` — the `chimera-runtime` package: the DBT runtime. `lib.rs` plus `dispatch.rs`, `elf.rs`, `exec.rs`, `syscall.rs`, `trampoline.rs`, `trampoline.S`, `translate.rs`. Example embedders in `runtime/examples/` (`sandbox/`, `strace/`). The lib name is `chimera`, so consumers write `use chimera::Sandbox` regardless of the package name.
- `cli/` — the `chimera-cli` package: thin front end (`main.rs`, `opts.rs`) producing the `chimera` binary. Intentionally thin — a stable harness for the conformance suite and performance work, not a product surface.
- `testing/` — conformance tests, driven by `testing/lit.py` (invokes `target/debug/chimera run`).
- `research/` — reference papers.

The workspace is shaped to accept a future `chimera-linux` crate alongside `chimera-runtime` — the natural home for userspace Linux semantics (`Vfs`, `Net`, …) layered on top of the DBT runtime.

## Tests

- **Conformance**: `make conformance` builds Chimera and runs each test under it; `make conformance-native` runs the same tests directly without Chimera.
- The runner is `testing/lit.py`, modeled after LLVM's LIT: each test source carries `// RUN:` directives the runner expands and executes. Tests live under `testing/conformance/`, organized by topic.
- **CI locally**: `make ci` runs the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — rustfmt, clippy, build, test, conformance) with [Agent CI](https://agent-ci.dev/). It uses a custom runner image, `.github/agent-ci.Dockerfile`; keep its pinned toolchain in sync with `rust-toolchain.toml`.

## Coding Style

### Imports

Group `use` statements by crate — `std`/`core` first, external crates next, local modules last — separated by blank lines. Collapse shared prefixes into a single `use crate::{a, b, c}` line:

```rust
use std::{ffi::OsString, path::PathBuf, process::ExitCode};

use chimera::Sandbox;

use opts::{Command, Opts};
```

### Comments

A comment must say something the code cannot: a kernel contract, an invariant, a non-obvious why. Say it once, on the item that owns it, and let every other site stand bare. Never restate a rationale at call sites, narrate what the next line does, or argue that the code is correct — that last kind is a review comment, and it goes stale the moment the review ends.

### Visibility

Don't use `pub(crate)`. Internal items live in private modules — `mod foo;`, not `pub mod foo;` — so plain `pub` there is already unreachable from outside the crate. If plain `pub` would genuinely widen the public API surface, move the item into a private module instead.

### Naming

The project name is **Chimera** in prose, comments, and doc comments. Lowercase `chimera` only inside backticks for code identifiers — the binary name, the crate path, `libchimera`, `chimera.h`, C-API symbols like `chimera_sandbox_t`.

### CLI Option Parsing

Options live in `opts.rs`, derived with [`argh`](https://github.com/google/argh). `Opts` carries a `Command` subcommand enum so new tools (`translate`, …) slot in alongside `run` without reshaping the top level. Do not switch to `clap` or another arg-parsing crate. Note: this version of `argh` accepts options only as `--name value`, not `--name=value`.

## Writing for ARCHITECTURE.md

Flowing Sun/DEC-style prose paragraphs. Bullets are reserved for genuine enumerations — auxv field names, lifecycle stages, layout entries — never as a substitute for explanatory sentences. Use numerals for technical quantities (`64-byte`, `16 bytes`). Citations are short: full first names, italicized venue abbreviation (e.g., *VEE '12*), DOI on its own at the end.
