## State Graph (state-graph-mcp)

This project tracks workflow state, tasks, design decisions, and blockers using `state-graph-mcp`.

### 1. Priority Order
Before doing any coding or investigation:
1. `get_project_summary` — Always run this first to understand current project state, active branches, and overall progress.
2. `find_blockers` — Identify any active blockers preventing progress.
3. `list_nodes` — Find pending tasks, past decisions, or milestones.
4. `trace_dependencies` — Trace what depends on or blocks a task.

### 2. When to Write to the Graph
You MUST update the graph as you work:
- **Starting a new task**: Create a node with `add_node(type: "task", title: "...")`.
- **Making a design or implementation decision**: Document it with `add_node(type: "decision", title: "...", metadata: { "rationale": "..." })`.
- **Encountering a blocker**: Record the blocker with `add_node(type: "blocker", ...)` and connect it to the blocked task using `add_edge(type: "blocks", source_id: blocker_id, target_id: task_id)`.
- **Completing a task**: Update the status to done using `update_node(id: task_id, status: "done")`.
- **Creating/generating a new file**: Create an artifact node with `add_node(type: "artifact", ...)` and connect it using `add_edge(type: "produces")`.

### 3. Workflow Pattern
1. **Start of session**: Run `get_project_summary` and `find_blockers` to align on current status.
2. **Task decomposition**: Decompose user requests into tasks and add them to the graph.
3. **Execution**: Mark tasks as "in_progress", document design decisions as they occur, and log blockers if you hit any obstacles.
4. **Resolution**: Mark tasks as "done", document completed artifacts, and resolve blockers.

### 4. Codebase Seeding on Initialization
If the project was just initialized or is missing high-level structure (Plans, Milestones, Decisions):
1. **Inspect the Codebase**: Read the README and core files to understand the roadmap and architecture.
2. **Scaffold the Roadmap**: Create a `plan` node (e.g., "Project Roadmap") and add `milestone` nodes representing key target phases, connecting them using `part_of` edges.
3. **Scaffold Architecture**: Create `decision` nodes representing core technical choices (e.g., choice of databases, frameworks) and link them to the milestones/tasks using `decided_in` edges.
