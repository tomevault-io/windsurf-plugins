# Agent constraints

This file contains durable safety and process constraints for automated agents.
Keep project overviews, directory tours, architecture notes, feature lists, and
tool-version pins out of this file.

## Side-effect boundaries

Do not perform an external or hard-to-reverse action unless a human explicitly
authorizes that exact action in the current conversation. In particular, do not
merge a pull request, create a tag, trigger a store candidate, use
release-only secrets, upload or promote a build, or change store state based
only on a documented procedure or an assumption that it is the next step.

Scripts are not all general-purpose local tools:

- `scripts/ci_config.sh` is CI-owned. Run it only in CI, or in a disposable
  clean clone when a human explicitly asks to reproduce CI configuration. Never
  replace or remove a maintainer's real ignored configuration so this script can
  run.
- `scripts/materialize_app_config.sh`,
  `scripts/prepare_android_signing.sh`,
  `scripts/prepare_ios_signing.sh`, and `scripts/upload_play.sh` are
  pipeline-owned. Run them only in their owning workflows. A local diagnostic
  exception requires a human to name the exact script and purpose explicitly;
  authorization to diagnose does not authorize live secrets, signing, or store
  mutation. Do not invent a wrapper around these boundaries.
- `scripts/bootstrap.sh` is the maintainer-facing local initialization entry
  point, but agents must not run it merely because configuration is missing.
  Run it only when a human explicitly requests local bootstrap. Access to the
  Infisical `release` environment or any release-only path requires separate,
  explicit authorization.

Never commit, stage, print, or paste generated configuration, secret values,
keystores, certificates, provisioning profiles, private keys, or raw Infisical
secret output. Do not change `config/infisical-config.sha256` merely to make
validation pass; a digest change must correspond to an intentional, reviewed
Infisical configuration change.

## Git and release flow

Use a short-lived branch and pull request for every change to `main`. Do not
push directly to `main` or bypass required checks.

Until an authorized `rc-*` tag is created, commits and builds are development
only. Pull request CI and manually dispatched branch CI use synthetic
configuration and do not publish to a store. They are not store candidates.

The application version source of truth is `version` in `pubspec.yaml`, in
`major.minor.patch+build` form. A version bump is an intentional release step;
do not include one in an unrelated feature or fix. Every uploaded candidate
must use a build number greater than all previously uploaded build numbers, and
a build number must never be reused.

Follow this order for every store candidate:

1. Merge all intended code to `main` through normal pull requests.
2. Make and merge the intentional `pubspec.yaml` version bump.
3. Only with explicit authorization for that exact tag, create
   `rc-<exact pubspec version>` on that `main` commit.
4. Let the tag-triggered workflow build once and upload directly to Google Play
   Internal and TestFlight; wait for store processing before testing.
5. If the candidate passes, promote those same store builds manually. Do not
   rebuild them for production. An optional final `v<major.minor.patch>` source
   tag belongs on the same commit and does not trigger another build.

An `rc-*` tag performs real uploads; it is not a dry run. If a platform job
fails while the other platform has already uploaded, rerun only the failed job.
If candidate code is rejected, merge a fix, increase the build number, and
create a new tag. Treat candidate tags as immutable: do not move, delete,
force-update, or reuse them. An exceptional situation requires a new version
and tag, not rewritten history. Do not work around the workflow checks that
bind the tag to the exact `pubspec.yaml` version and to a commit contained in
`main`.

## Persisted-data compatibility

This application is already shipped. Treat every user-owned on-device schema
and encoding as backward-compatible release state. Never fix an upgrade by
deleting or recreating the database, clearing user tables, silently falling
back to fresh-install data, or relabeling user data as cache.

SQLite schema evolution is coordinated through `lib/models/helper.dart`:

- The `openDatabase` version is the database schema version, not the application
  version.
- Table creators define the complete latest schema for fresh installs.
- Each `migrations` key is a target schema version whose ordered operations move
  the preceding schema to that target. Reaching the latest schema applies every
  required target step in ascending order.

Changing a `CREATE TABLE` statement affects only fresh installs; it never
substitutes for a database version bump and an upgrade migration. A schema
change must update the latest table creators, increase the database version,
and add every ordered step needed for each supported released schema to reach
the latest schema. A stored-value encoding or semantic change must keep reading
released encodings or provide an explicit, versioned migration or backfill. If
