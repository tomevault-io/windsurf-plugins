# securevector-ai-threat-monitor Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2026-02-01

## Active Technologies
- Python 3.10+, JavaScript ES6+ + FastAPI, aiosqlite, pywebview (existing — no new dependencies) (007-llm-cost-tracking)
- SQLite via existing `DatabaseConnection` — two new tables via migration v12 (007-llm-cost-tracking)
- TypeScript (hook handler), JavaScript ES6+ (integration page UI), Python 3.10+ (existing backend) + OpenClaw hook API (external), FastAPI (existing backend), native `fetch` (TypeScript handler) (008-openclaw-hooks-integration)
- N/A (hook is stateless; analysis results stored by existing SecureVector backend) (008-openclaw-hooks-integration)
- Python 3.10+, JavaScript ES6+ + FastAPI, aiosqlite, pywebview 5.0+, uvicorn (all existing — no new dependencies) (001-skill-scanner)
- SQLite via existing `DatabaseConnection`; new `skill_scan_records` table via migration V18 (001-skill-scanner)

- Python 3.10+, JavaScript ES6+ + pywebview 5.0+, FastAPI, uvicorn (existing) (005-crossplatform-lightweight-ui)

<!-- MANUAL ADDITIONS START -->
## Git

- Never commit. The user handles all commits themselves.

## Session continuity (every 10 interactions)

Every ~10 user-message interactions, write a fresh session summary so the conversation can be `/compact`-ed without losing state. Rules:

- **Path:** `.claude/sessions/session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md` (this directory is gitignored — line 29 of `.gitignore`).
- **Never commit session summaries.** They are local-only scratch state. Do not stage, do not add to git, do not include in PRs.
- **What to capture:** active task + sub-task, files in flight (path + what changed), pending TODOs, last command run, any uncommitted-but-applied edits, and the immediate next step. Skip transient tool output, full diffs, and conversation pleasantries.
- **Counting interactions:** count user messages, not tool calls. After every 10th user message, write the summary before responding to the 11th.
- **On resume after compaction:** read the most recent file in `.claude/sessions/` first to recover state.

## Skills to Use

### UI / Frontend
- **`frontend-design:frontend-design`** — use when building or redesigning any web UI components, pages, or layouts in `src/securevector/app/assets/web/`; produces polished, production-grade vanilla JS following the existing page-object pattern

### Feature Architecture & Code Quality
- **`feature-dev:feature-dev`** — use for deep feature analysis, understanding existing patterns, and planning changes that span multiple backend modules
- **`/simplify`** — run after implementation to review changed code for quality, reuse, and efficiency

### Security / Skill Scanner Domain
- When implementing or extending the Skill Scanner (`src/securevector/app/services/skill_scanner.py`), apply security-expert judgement: static analysis only, no code execution, check each of the 7 finding categories (network_domain, env_var_read, shell_exec, code_exec, dynamic_import, file_write, base64_literal), plus compiled_code, symlink_escape, missing_manifest. Community rule library is intentionally excluded — it targets LLM text, not source code. AI review (if enabled) provides context-aware false-positive filtering. Respect the severity-based risk aggregation (critical/high → HIGH, medium-only → MEDIUM, none/low → LOW)
