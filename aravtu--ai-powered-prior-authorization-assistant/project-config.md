# AI-Powered Prior Authorization Assistant

## Description
An AI tool that automates the prior authorization process for healthcare providers.

## Core Feature
Automating the prior authorization workflow to reduce manual effort and errors.

## Stack
Python, TensorFlow

## YOUR TASK - Do all of this autonomously, no questions:

1. Read every .py file. Find errors, TODOs, missing implementations.
2. CRITICAL FIX: If app.py loads a .pkl file that does not exist, replace with inline training:
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   import numpy as np
   model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
   X_train = np.random.rand(200, 20)
   y_train = np.random.randint(0, 3, 200)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
3. Install any missing packages: pip3 install --break-system-packages <pkg>
4. Make app.py start without crashing
5. Make index.html fully functional and connected to the Flask API
6. Update requirements.txt
7. Run python3 app.py to verify startup — fix anything that fails
