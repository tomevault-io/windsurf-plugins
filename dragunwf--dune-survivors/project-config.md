- **Core Loop:**
  1. **Survive:** Fight a wave of enemies.

  - Health: A simple heart-based health system.
  - Combat: Uses various guns with stats like `projectile count` and `fireRate`.

- **Enemies & Waves:**

  - Enemies have different behaviors (Melee and Ranged).

- **Upgrades & Progression:**
  - A upgrade menu appears between waves.
  - It offers options to upgrade the gun, increase max health, and heal.

## 3. Key Systems to Develop
