This file provides guidance to Codex when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Beagle is a Claude Code plugin marketplace providing framework-aware code review skills and verification workflows for pre-push reviews and GitHub bot feedback handling. It contains 11 focused plugins with 122 skills.

## Marketplace Architecture

```text
beagle/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json         # Marketplace manifest (11 plugins)
└── plugins/
    ├── beagle-core/             # Shared workflows, verification, git workflows (18 skills)
    ├── beagle-python/           # Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, pytest (7 skills)
    ├── beagle-go/               # Go, BubbleTea, Wish SSH, Prometheus (13 skills)
    ├── beagle-elixir/           # Elixir, Phoenix, LiveView, ExUnit, ExDoc (11 skills)
    ├── beagle-ios/              # Swift, SwiftUI, SwiftData, iOS frameworks (16 skills)
    ├── beagle-react/            # React, React Flow, shadcn/ui, Tailwind, Vitest (16 skills)
    ├── beagle-rust/             # Rust, tokio, axum, sqlx, serde (8 skills)
    ├── beagle-ai/               # Pydantic AI, LangGraph, DeepAgents, Vercel AI SDK (13 skills)
    ├── beagle-docs/             # Documentation quality, AI writing detection (10 skills)
    ├── beagle-analysis/         # Brainstorming, 12-Factor, ADRs, LLM-as-judge (8 skills)
    └── beagle-testing/          # Test plan generation and execution (2 skills)
```

Each plugin is self-contained with its own `plugin.json` and `skills/` directory.

## Local Development

Test the marketplace during development:

```bash
# In Claude Code settings (~/.claude/settings.json)
{
  "plugins": ["/path/to/your/beagle"]
}
```

Restart Claude Code after changes to reload. Skills are discovered from plugin `skills/` directories and trigger keywords in skill frontmatter. Codex users can install the same skills by linking each plugin into `~/.agents/skills/` (see [.codex/INSTALL.md](.codex/INSTALL.md)).

## Skills

See [Agent Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) for the canonical format.

Beagle treats skills as the canonical format. Former command workflows were unified into `SKILL.md` files under each plugin's `skills/` directory, where frontmatter controls user exposure and behavior.

**Skills** (`plugins/<name>/skills/` folders): Auto-loaded when relevant. Structure: `skill-name/SKILL.md` with optional `references/` folder and frontmatter such as `disable-model-invocation` and `user-invocable`.

## Creating New Skills

See [Agent Skills best practices](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) for authoring guidance.

Beagle-specific:
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; use `references/` for details
- Some skills use multiple root-level .md files (e.g., react-router-v7)
- Code review skills: use format `[FILE:LINE] ISSUE_TITLE`
- Place new skills in the appropriate plugin directory
- Mark workflow skills with `disable-model-invocation: true`
- Mark internal-only reference skills with `user-invocable: false`
