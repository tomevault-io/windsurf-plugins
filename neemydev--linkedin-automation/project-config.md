# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

---

## What This Is

Automated LinkedIn content generation pipeline. Reads your profile and content pillars, generates posts/carousels/infographics in your voice, and presents everything in a review dashboard before you publish.

**Profile:** Defined in `context/profile.md` — this is the source of truth for who you are and how to write for you. If this file doesn't exist, copy from `context/profile.template.md`.

**Three-phase pipeline:** Research trends → Create content → Review in dashboard → Publish

> **First time?** See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for setup instructions.

---

## First Time?

Run `/setup` once after cloning. Claude will ask you 10 questions and write all config files automatically.

## Session Start

Run `/prime` at the start of every session. Claude will read all context files and confirm readiness.

---

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/prime` | Load all context files and initialize session |
| `/research` | Phase 1: Trend scan → hooks → weekly brief |
| `/create posts` | Generate 5 text posts (Story/Data/Contrarian each) |
| `/create carousel [topic]` | 10-slide carousel PDF via fal.ai nano-banana-pro |
| `/create infographic [topic]` | Portrait PNG infographic via fal.ai nano-banana-pro |
| `/create custom [context]` | Custom post/carousel/infographic from YOUR data |
| `/create batch` | Full week: 5 posts + 1 carousel + 1 infographic |
| `/dashboard build` | Build React content review dashboard |
| `/dashboard update` | Refresh dashboard with new output/ files |
| `/publish` | Publishing checklist + open dashboard |

---

## Content Pillars (4 pillars)

| # | Pillar | % of Content | Frequency |
|---|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Healthcare AI Insights | 35% | 2x/week |
| 2 | Technical Deep Dives | 25% | 1-2x/week |
| 3 | Career Journey & Personal Stories | 15% | 1x/week |
| 4 | Industry Commentary | 10% | 1x/2 weeks |
| 5 | Claude & AI Tools | 15% | 1x/week |

## Content Rules

- First line is ALWAYS a hook (pattern interrupt, bold claim, or curiosity gap)
- One idea per post — if you have 3 ideas, that's 3 posts
- Short paragraphs: 1-3 lines maximum, mobile-first
- Use specific numbers: ~93% accuracy, 200+ hours, 5 models tested
- Write at 6th-grade reading level — short sentences, no jargon without explanation
- 3-5 hashtags at post end ONLY (never in body, algorithm penalizes >5)
- NO corporate buzzwords (synergy, leverage, ecosystem, excited to announce)
- NO engagement bait ("Like if you agree") — ask specific questions instead
- Every post must reinforce the positioning: healthcare AI engineer who ships production systems
- Best posting time: 8-10 AM PKT (Tue-Thu perform best)
- Respond to every comment within 4 hours

## How Commands & Skills Work

**Commands** (`.claude/commands/`) are short — they name the task and point to a skill.
**Skills** (`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`) contain the full detailed instructions.

When executing any command, Claude reads the relevant skill file first, then runs the process.

---

## Image Generation (fal.ai nano-banana-pro)

All visuals (infographics, carousel slides) are generated via fal.ai:

```bash
# Single image
