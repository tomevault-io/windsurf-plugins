Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, refer to the official Visual Studio Code documentation on Copilot customization.

- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. Completed 2025-11-05.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements – Comprehensive specification provided for React/Tailwind implementation.
	Ask for project type, language, and frameworks if not specified. Skip if already provided.

- [x] Scaffold the Project – Vite React TypeScript app created with npm install completed.
	Ensure that the previous step has been marked as completed.
	Call project setup tool with projectType parameter.
	Run scaffolding command to create project files and folders.
	Use '.' as the working directory.
	If no appropriate projectType is available, search documentation using available tools.
	Otherwise, create the project structure manually using available file creation tools.

- [x] Customize the Project – Implemented full multi-page UI, theming, interactivity, bilingual support, and booking flow per specification.
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed successfully and you have marked the step as completed.
	Develop a plan to modify codebase according to user requirements.
	Apply modifications using appropriate tools and user-provided references.
	Skip this step for "Hello World" projects.

- [x] Install Required Extensions – No additional extensions required for this stack.
	Only install extensions provided in the get_project_setup_info.

- [x] Compile the Project – `npm run build` (Vite) succeeds without errors.
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Install any missing dependencies.
	Run diagnostics and resolve any issues.
	Check for markdown files in project folder for relevant instructions on how to do this.
	Summary: `npm run build` via `cmd` succeeded on 2025-02-14; PowerShell policy blocked scripts so `cmd` was used instead.

- [x] Create and Run Task
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Check https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks to determine if the project needs a task. If so, use the create_and_run_task to create and launch a task based on package.json, README.md, and project structure.
	Skip this step otherwise.
	Summary: Added `.vscode/tasks.json` with `npm: build` and confirmed it runs cleanly.

- [x] Launch the Project – `npm run dev` running locally at http://localhost:5173/.
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Prompt user for debug mode, launch only if confirmed.

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Verify that README.md and this copilot-instructions.md file contains current project information.
	Clean up this file by removing any HTML comments.
	Summary: README updated with OTP verification notes; checklist reflects latest state.

## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless the user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use the VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Code—do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

FOLDER CREATION RULES:
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it (besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file).
- If any scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in VS Code.

EXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:
- Only install extensions specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. Do not install other extensions.

PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
