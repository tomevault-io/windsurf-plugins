# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview
- `GhostTile` is a Swift Package with three targets:
- `GhostTileCore`: shared process, config, signing, logging, and helper logic.
- `ghosttile`: CLI built with `swift-argument-parser`.
- `GhostTileApp`: macOS SwiftUI app and menu bar UI.

## Repository Layout
- `Sources/GhostTileCore`: core logic used by both the app and CLI.
- `Sources/ghosttile`: CLI entrypoint and subcommands.
- `Sources/GhostTileApp`: SwiftUI views, app lifecycle, and status bar integration.
- `Resources`: app bundle resources, `Info.plist`, icons, and `ghosthide.m`.
- `justfile`: local build, packaging, install, and release helpers.
- `docs/dev/roadmap.md`: shipped work and near-term follow-up.

## Architecture

### GhostTileCore — domain types
- `AppManager`: thin façade delegating to focused types below.
- `AppResolver`: resolves apps from bundle ID, path, name, or running app.
- `AppPreparationManager`: binary backup, Mach-O patching, entitlements, codesign.
- `AppRestoreManager`: binary restoration and cleanup.
- `AppLauncher`: launch/quit/focus, SIP and Apple-first-party checks.
- `ShellRunner`: command execution with stderr capture.
- `ManagedAppRecord` / `ManagedAppStateReader`: shared core model and snapshot factory.
- `Config`: reads/writes `~/.config/ghosttile/config.json`.

### GhostTileApp — services
- Service implementations live in focused subfolders under `Sources/GhostTileApp/Services`.
- `Services/ManagedApps`: managed app list, snapshots, config watching.
- `Services/Permissions`: System Settings permission guidance and helper overlay.
- `Services/Attention`: attention/notification observation and delivery.
- `Services/DockVisibility`: auto-hide, reapply, notification sending.
- `Services/AppActions`: high-level hide/launch/remove workflows.
- `Services/CLI`: consolidated CLI binary path resolution.
- `Services/Shortcuts`, `Services/Sponsors`, `Services/Updates`, `Services/Config`: focused support services.

### GhostTileApp — view models
- `AppViewModel`: app-wide coordinator for loading state, errors, workspace observers.
- `MainWindowViewModel`: query filtering, managed/running app lists, counts.
- `OverviewViewModel`: selection, arrow navigation, search.
- `SettingsViewModel`: CLI install status, version checking, launch-at-login.

### GhostTileApp — shared UI types
- `ManagedAppItem`: standalone UI wrapper over `ManagedAppRecord` (icon + category).
- `IconTileView`, `SearchFieldView`, `SectionHeaderView`, `StatusPill`: reusable primitives.
- `SettingsSectionCard`, `SettingsRowIcon`: settings-specific chrome.

### CLI — commands
- `CLIShared`: helper functions for JSON output and managed app resolution.
- `ManagePrepareCommands`, `QueryCommands`, `FocusCommand`, `RestoreCommand`, `VisibilityCommands`: individual command files.

## Common Commands
- `swift build`: build all targets in debug.
- `swift build -c release --product GhostTileApp`: build the app binary.
- `swift build -c release --product ghosttile`: build the CLI binary.
- `just build`: assemble `GhostTile.app`, compile `ghosthide.dylib`, and codesign the bundle.
- `just run`: rebuild and open the app bundle.
- `just build-cli`: build only the CLI in release.

## Version Control
- Use `jj` for source control operations in this repo: status, diff, log, change descriptions, bookmark movement, and Git pushes.
- Use `git` only when a task specifically needs GitHub/Git compatibility that `jj` does not cover.
- Abandon only empty jj changes with no description, and never abandon user work or non-empty changes without explicit confirmation.

## Release Pipeline
1. Bump the app version + build with `just set-version` (auto-bumps patch + build by default; pass explicit values like `just set-version 2.1.0 23` for major/minor). The `VERSION` file at repo root is the single source — the recipe also mirrors it into `project.yml`, `Resources/Info.plist`, and `BuildInfo.swift`.
2. Write release notes to `releases/<version>.html` as an HTML body fragment with no wrapper tags.
3. Run `just build` to verify the release still builds.
4. Run `just release-dry-run` if you want a local package check without signing or notarization.
5. Run `just release` to sign, notarize, zip, update `docs/appcast.xml`, update the `docs/index.html` download link (`just update-download`), and upload the draft GitHub release.
6. Before publishing, verify the exact release archive that will be uploaded: `bash scripts/verify-release-archive.sh dist/GhostTile-<version>.zip notarized`. This extracts the archive and runs `codesign`, `stapler validate`, and `spctl -av` against the extracted `GhostTile.app`.
7. Publish the draft GitHub release (`gh release edit v<version> --draft=false`) so the `v<version>` tag exists and the binary download URL works.
8. Commit and push `docs/appcast.xml` + `docs/index.html` to `main` so Sparkle clients and the marketing site see the new version.
9. Update the Homebrew tap via `just update-cask`, then commit + push `../tap/Casks/ghosttile.rb`.
10. Update the official Homebrew/homebrew-cask fork via `just update-homebrew-cask` (edits `../../github/homebrew-cask/Casks/g/ghosttile.rb`; set `HOMEBREW_CASK_DIR` to override). Commit on the fork branch, then push and open a PR to `Homebrew/homebrew-cask` manually.
