This is an awesome project! I use it every day, and I'm so glad you're helping me build it. Thank you!!!

## Project stage: proof of concept

pi-orb is still a POC (noted 2026-08-03). Do not build backwards-compatibility machinery unless explicitly asked: no deprecated route aliases, no dual-read/dual-write phases, no multi-deploy migration choreography. Breaking changes to internal contracts (runtime routes, protocol schemas, env contracts) ship directly; running orbs that break on an old contract are simply stopped and restarted. SQL schema migrations (`adapters/pg/migrations/*.sql`) remain the normal way to change the database — this note is about compatibility staging, not about avoiding migration files.

## Simplicity

Always consider simplicity an important criterion when planning and building. Prefer the smallest design that satisfies the actual requirements; question whether a problem can be removed instead of managed. Avoid speculative configurability, extra state machines, and compatibility machinery without a demonstrated need. When simplifying, remove obsolete code, options, tests, and documentation together while preserving safety and observability.

## Design documentation

The design docs are the source of truth for pi-orb's evolving design. `DESIGN.md` is the entry point: purpose, scope, product decisions, the architecture overview, and an index of the topical docs under `docs/` (one per subsystem: host provider, lifecycle, runtime protocol, history/replication, Pi adapter, control-plane API, web UI, credentials, deployment, testing, stack). Incident forensics live in `docs/postmortems/`, undecided design questions in `docs/open-questions.md`, and actionable work in `TODO.md`.

Whenever a conversation or implementation changes a requirement, decision, proposal, rejected approach, experimental finding, or open question:

1. Update the relevant `docs/` file in the same task. Do not let implementation silently diverge from the docs.
2. Distinguish clearly between decisions (dated), current proposals, and unresolved questions. Preserve important rationale and evidence, not just the latest conclusion — rejected alternatives stay next to the decision that rejected them.
3. Keep interfaces and examples synchronized with the surrounding prose.
4. Open questions live only in `docs/open-questions.md`. Numbering is frozen and append-only: mark resolved in place, never renumber or delete, because code and docs reference questions by number.
5. Actionable items (bugs, hardening, agreed follow-ups) live only in `TODO.md`: no TODO/FIXME comments in code, no TODOs buried in design prose. An item lives in exactly one of `TODO.md` / `docs/open-questions.md`; when a question is decided and the decision implies work, mark it resolved there and move the work to `TODO.md` in the same edit.
6. Incident forensics get a file in `docs/postmortems/`; the design doc keeps the resulting rule or invariant plus a link.
7. Reference docs by path (for example `docs/credentials.md`), never by section number. When adding a doc, add it to the index in `DESIGN.md`.

## Audience

This project is for one person. The UI does not need to explain itself, and it must not repeat itself: no orientation copy, no help text, no legends, no label next to an icon that already says the same thing, no fact shown in two places on one screen.

## Missing resources

When a requested resource does not exist, preserve the requested URL and show a clear resource-specific “doesn't exist” message with a link back to the dashboard. Never silently redirect a missing resource to the dashboard. Apply this consistently to all resource types and unknown application routes.

## Error handling

Do not use exceptions for expected or recoverable control flow. First-party fallible APIs return `neverthrow` `Result` or `ResultAsync` with explicit discriminated error types.

When third-party or platform code can throw or reject, catch it at the immediate adapter boundary with `Result.fromThrowable`, `ResultAsync.fromThrowable`, or an equally narrow wrapper and map it to a typed error. Do not let raw exceptions, rejected promises, or untyped `Error` objects cross into first-party domain code. Use exceptions only where a framework contract requires them, and document narrow lint overrides.

## Testing

Install repository dependencies with `npm ci` before running checks or starting the frontend. `npm run` does not install dependencies; if a local tool such as `tsc` is missing, install dependencies and continue validation rather than reporting the missing tool as a blocker.

Deterministic simulation testing with the `determined` package is a first-class design constraint. Keep concurrency-critical logic, clocks, persistence, runtime transport, and host lifecycle behavior behind simulation-friendly boundaries. New state machines and retry/reconciliation logic must include deterministic scheduling checkpoints, failpoints where appropriate, invariant-focused tests, and reproducible failure traces.
