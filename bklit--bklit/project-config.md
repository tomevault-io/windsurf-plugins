description: Practices for creating, updating and deletions, forms, fields, tRPC.
---


When building create, updated or deletes such as forms, fields; refer to our `/apps/dashboard/src/actions/**` where we use tRPC APIs for most effective data transformations.

Refer to docs: [tRPC](https://trpc.io/docs) and check our `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` file for our database models

## Key Patterns

### Server Actions vs tRPC

- **Use Server Actions** for form submissions and complex business logic
- **Use tRPC mutations** for simple CRUD operations and real-time updates
- **Server Actions** are better for: form validation, file uploads, complex workflows
- **tRPC mutations** are better for: simple updates, optimistic updates, real-time features

### Database Updates

- **Better Auth API** has limitations - use Prisma directly for custom fields (like `theme`)
- **Always use Prisma** for fields not supported by Better Auth API
- **Import Prisma** from `@bklit/db/client` in server actions

### Form Patterns

- **Use `useActionState`** for server actions with proper typing
- **Use `useMutation`** from React Query for tRPC mutations
- **Always invalidate queries** after updates using `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`
- **Use proper error handling** with try/catch and user feedback

### Type Safety

- **Export interfaces** from action files for reuse
- **Use proper return types** in server actions
- **Type form state** with `OrganizationFormState` pattern
- **Cast tRPC actions** when needed: `createOrganizationAction as (prevState: OrganizationFormState, formData: FormData) => Promise<OrganizationFormState>`

### Query Invalidation

- **Invalidate specific queries** with proper query keys
- **Use `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`** for cache updates
- **Pattern**: `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["organization", "fetch", { id: organizationId }] })`
