## What this is

`awesome-esp32` is a curated public list of ESP32 projects, in the awesome-list tradition: a single `README.md`, entries of the form `- [name](repo) - description. ([demo](url))`. It is a taste-driven project list, not a library index (that niche is taken by agucova/awesome-esp).

## How to run

The deliverable is `README.md`. `bun scripts/check-links.ts` verifies every link (a GitHub Action runs it Mondays and files a `linkcheck` issue on failures; export `GITHUB_TOKEN` locally to avoid API rate-limit noise).

## Conventions

- Every entry links to a source repository. **Verify the URL resolves** (`git ls-remote <url> HEAD`) before committing an entry.
- Demo links (tweet, video) ride along as a trailing `([demo](url))`; they never replace the repo link.
- Descriptions: one sentence, factual, no superlatives.
- Two fixed top-level sections: **Applications** (things people built and run on an ESP32) and **Tools, utilities & libraries**. An entry's home is decided by what it IS, not what it enables: firmware you flash and use is an application, a framework/SDK/flasher is a tool.
- Subcategories are provisional by design. When a category passes ~12 entries or the overall list doubles, restructure freely; do not preserve the current taxonomy out of caution.
- New entries go at the bottom of their category.
- README style: no badges, no ASCII art, no screenshots grid.

## Sourcing

The primary intake is Sylve pasting links (t.co, github, or tweet URLs) in session; the global `/awesome-esp32-add` skill codifies the procedure (resolve, verify, one-sentence description, classify, demo link, push). An X-bookmarks scraper once lived in `harvest/` (patchright, dedicated Chrome profile); it was removed to keep the repo pure markdown, recover it from git history if ever wanted, and do NOT relaunch it unless Sylve asks.

## Gotchas

- The list is public and pushed straight to `main` (no PRs for our own edits; external contributions arrive as PRs per `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- License is CC0; keep descriptions original rather than pasted from project READMEs.
