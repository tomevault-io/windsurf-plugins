# Bootstrap And Authority

- RULE: Read `AGENTS.md` first, then every applicable rule file, then the ADRs cited by those rules.
- RULE: Treat `docs/adr/**/*.md` as canonical doctrine.
- RULE: Treat `docs/bibliography/**/*.md` as supporting references, not as policy overrides.
- RULE: If a change affects repository policy, update ADR first.
- RULE: Repository-facing content is English only unless ADR explicitly allows a user-facing Spanish artifact.
