# AGENTS.md — Hermes Console

## What this is

Hermes Console is a local-first monorepo for inspecting Hermes Agent setups.

Current workspace shape:

- `packages/runtime` for pure schemas, types, and domain helpers
- `apps/api` for filesystem reads, CLI diagnostics, and the local HTTP boundary
- `apps/web` for the Vite React UI

It is:

- Hermes-native
- read-mostly at launch
- visibility-first, not chat-first
- intended as a clean, focused product

## Product priorities

When working in this repo, optimise for:

1. legibility
2. calm operator UX
3. simple local setup
4. modular code structure
5. strong naming and obvious file organisation
6. small, testable units

## Non-goals for v1

Do not let the repo drift into:

- generic multi-agent platform abstractions
- terminal emulator work
- chat-client parity work
- full file manager/editor scope
- enterprise auth / RBAC theatre
- Shan-specific bespoke workflow surfaces as core primitives

## Code structure expectations

- Prefer small composable components over giant page files.
- Keep reader/parsing logic in `apps/api` or `packages/runtime`, never in `apps/web`.
- Keep `packages/runtime` pure and framework-agnostic.
- Create explicit internal types for each source family.
- Prefer strong names that explain intent: `CronJobsTable`, `readSkillsIndex`, `formatMemoryUsage`.
- Keep file and folder structure obvious and domain-led.
- Avoid catch-all `utils` dumping grounds when a domain module is clearer.

## Testing expectations

Add unit tests for:

- readers
- parsers
- normalizers
- schedule / usage / warning calculations
- any non-trivial UI state helpers

If logic is important enough to deserve a helper, it usually deserves a test.

## Local config expectations

Expect `.env.local` for local overrides.
Planned important env vars:

- `HERMES_CONSOLE_HERMES_DIR`
- `HERMES_CONSOLE_WORKSPACE_DIR`
- `PORT`

Default assumption is a standard Hermes setup under `~/.hermes`.

## UX expectations

- Dark-first.
- Giles-style information clarity.
- Hermes-style branding and accents.
- Dense but breathable layouts.
- Make important state obvious in one screen when possible.
- Avoid noisy dashboards and fake enterprise complexity.

## Before major implementation work

Check:

- `docs/prd.md`
- `docs/implementation-plan.md`
- this file

If implementation starts drifting from the product thesis, stop and simplify.
