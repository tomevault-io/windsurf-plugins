# Agent Notes

Before changing terminal rendering, read:

- `.agents/design.md` for the fat prompt architecture and visual contract.
- `.agents/controller-design.md` for controller-owned transcript/history item
  architecture and module MVC responsibilities.
- `.agents/testing.md` for visual test and frame viewer workflow.
- `.agents/development-guide.md` for agent development and bugfixing rules.

Bug reports must be reproduced in visual tests before implementation changes.
Prefer expanding the main shakedown or another broad visual test; add narrow
one-off tests only as a last resort.
