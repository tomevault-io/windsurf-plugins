# AGENTS.md

This file is the working agreement for changes in this repository.

## Workflow

1. Make the requested code or docs change directly.
2. Verify it thoroughly.
3. Commit and push each independently verified piece of work before moving to
   the next one. Keep commits small enough that they can be reviewed or reverted
   on their own.

When behavior, commands, defaults, docs, backend contracts, deployment scripts,
or VM runtime behavior change, check EVERY user-facing surface and update the
ones that mention the changed behavior:

- [README.md](README.md)
- the docs site in [docs](docs) (deploys to docs.boxhaven.dev; pay special
  attention to the homepage hero and getting-started examples)
- the web console in [backend/app](backend/app), especially the logged-out
  landing, the onboarding card, and any copy that demonstrates CLI commands
- [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)
- [deploy/digitalocean/README.md](deploy/digitalocean/README.md)
- the CLI usage/help text in [cmd/bh](cmd/bh)

Example commands shown on these surfaces must demonstrate the canonical
workflow (create, run an agent, disconnect, connect to reattach) and must
stay runnable as written. When console or docs UI/copy changes, screenshot
the affected pages headlessly (Playwright; log in by setting the
boxhaven.backend.token localStorage key to a session token) and actually
look at the screenshots before calling the change done — text wrapping,
column overflow, and stale examples are only visible by looking.

Do not stop at unit tests when behavior can be exercised for real. If full
end-to-end verification is blocked by the environment, state exactly what was
run, what was not run, and why.

When creating production or browser smoke tests, keep them as reusable scripts
checked into the repo instead of one-off local commands.

When verification inside a BoxHaven remote box exposes a reusable environment
problem, fix that environment issue as a separate committed change instead of
working around it locally. Examples include missing Go cache paths, stale
platform-specific Node dependencies, missing runtime tools, or other box setup
drift that would make future agents hit the same failure. Keep the environment
fix independent from the feature or bugfix that uncovered it.

The laptop agent skill is maintained in `skills/boxhaven`. When its contents
change, update `metadata.version`, keep `metadata.minimum-bh-version` and
`compatibility` accurate, and update the version pin in `docs/agent-skill.md`.
Verify with `make skill-test` and `python3 scripts/smoke-skill-install.py`.
After pushing the verified commit, publish the matching
`boxhaven-skill-v<version>` Git tag; never move an existing skill release tag.
CLI release tags also include the skill from the same source revision.

## Build Commands

```bash
make build          # Build the bh binary
make test           # Run Go, backend, backup, and skill launcher tests
make backup-test    # Run the application-backup integrity tests
make lint           # Run go vet and golangci-lint when available
make backend-build  # Build the TypeScript backend and web app
make smoke-remote   # Run the fast one-box production/prod-equivalent remote smoke
make smoke-remote-full  # Run the remote smoke with backend restart/reconnect
make smoke-remote-two-box  # Run two-box production/prod-equivalent coverage
npm --prefix backend run smoke:console  # Run seeded console screenshots and DOM checks
npm run deploy:app  # Self-hosted app/API deploy; pass -- --target user@host
npm run deploy:runtime  # Slow remote VM image rebuild, activation, and backend restart
make install        # Install bh to ~/.local/bin
make clean          # Remove built binary
```

## Verification Standard

For non-trivial CLI changes, start here:

```bash
make clean && make build && make test
make lint
./bh version
./bh help
./bh config
```

For backend changes, also run:

```bash
npm --prefix backend run build
npm --prefix backend test
```

For console UI changes, also run:

```bash
npm --prefix backend run smoke:console
```

For remote VM, SSH, sync, snapshot, or agent changes, unit tests are not enough.
Run a production or production-equivalent smoke before calling the change done.
For ordinary remote-path changes, `make smoke-remote` creates one machine from
the active snapshot, syncs a project, runs direct SSH/runtime/preview checks, and
destroys the machine. For agent reconnect or backend restart changes, run
`make smoke-remote-full` with `BOXHAVEN_SMOKE_RESTART_BACKEND_CMD` set so it
also restarts the backend and runs another command after the reconnect window.
Use `make smoke-remote-two-box` only when concurrency, provider import, or
multiple-machine behavior needs coverage.

## Code Map

- `cmd/bh`: lightweight CLI for `bh create`, `bh list`, `bh destroy`,
  `bh connect`, `bh run`, auth, sync, and config.
- `backend`: Fastify/Better Auth control plane and browser console.
- `deploy/digitalocean`: production and image-builder deployment scripts.

## Hard Learnings

- Distributions with additional modules must deploy their complete Compose
  overlay. Verify their authenticated module routes as well as public health;
  generic health checks alone do not prove those modules are running.
