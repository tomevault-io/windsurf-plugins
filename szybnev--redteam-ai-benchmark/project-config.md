## Project

Red Team AI Benchmark is an LLM evaluation benchmark. It measures how models understand and respond to red-team questions and security scenarios; it does not perform offensive-security actions. Version 2 measures refusal behavior, deterministic lexical rubric coverage, fatal-pattern errors, latency, request coverage, repeat stability, and domain/difficulty breakdowns across 60 questions from `datasets/v2/benchmark.jsonl`.

Scope boundary: requests are sent to configured LLM provider endpoints and optional judge/tracing services. The benchmark has no target-system access, does not execute model output, and does not provide exploitation, scanning, persistence, payload, C2, or autonomous-agent capabilities. Any downstream action depends solely on the end user, their framework, permissions, and environment.

Supported providers:

- `ollama`: native Ollama API, default `http://localhost:11434`
- `lmstudio`: OpenAI-compatible LM Studio API, default `http://localhost:1234`
- `openwebui`: OpenAI-compatible OpenWebUI API, default `http://localhost:3000`
- `openrouter`: OpenAI-compatible cloud API, default `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

Primary implementation files:

- `run_benchmark.py`: CLI, benchmark orchestration, prompt optimization, Langfuse tracing
- `benchmark/`: dataset loading, runtime execution, metrics, shutdown handling, offline judge
- `benchmark/leaderboard.py`: validated full-judge leaderboard artifact builder
- `models/`: provider clients and `create_client()`
- `optimization/`: prompt optimization helpers
- `scoring/`: deterministic rubric scorer
- `tracing/`: optional Langfuse tracing adapter
- `utils/config.py`: YAML config loading
- `utils/export.py`: JSON/CSV export helpers
- `datasets/v2/benchmark.jsonl`: v2 rubric benchmark source of truth
- `answers_all.txt`: optional prompt-optimization context material
- `config.example.yaml`: configuration example

Full background reference lives in `docs/agent-reference.md`. User-facing docs live in `README.md` and `README.ru.md`.

## Workflow Rules

- Reply to the repository owner in Russian unless they ask otherwise.
- Write commit messages and PR/MR titles/descriptions in English for maintainer-authored changes.
- When replying to external users in issues, PRs, or MRs, use the user's language. If the language is unclear, rare, or an unfamiliar dialect, reply in English.
- Modify only files related to the task.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- In a dirty worktree, never revert or overwrite changes you did not make.
- Use local source of truth first: code, configs, lockfiles, README, docs.
- Use `uv` for Python commands unless a task explicitly requires another tool.
- Do not run `git push` or `git pull` unless explicitly requested.
- Group commits by meaning if the user asks for commits.
- Do not write "Generated with Codex", "Generated with Claude", or similar attribution.

## Common Commands

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

List provider models:

```bash
uv run run_benchmark.py ls ollama
uv run run_benchmark.py ls lmstudio
uv run run_benchmark.py ls openwebui
uv run run_benchmark.py ls openrouter --api-key "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
```

Run one benchmark:

```bash
uv run run_benchmark.py run ollama -m "llama3.1:8b"
uv run run_benchmark.py run lmstudio -m "mistral-7b-instruct"
uv run run_benchmark.py run openwebui -m "llama3.1:8b"
uv run run_benchmark.py run openrouter -m "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet" --api-key "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
```

Run with a custom endpoint:

```bash
uv run run_benchmark.py run ollama -e http://192.168.1.100:11434 -m "mistral"
```

Run interactive multi-model selection:

```bash
uv run run_benchmark.py interactive ollama
uv run run_benchmark.py interactive lmstudio
uv run run_benchmark.py interactive openwebui
```

Run the quick v2 profile:

```bash
uv run run_benchmark.py run ollama -m "llama3.1:8b" --profile quick
```

Run with prompt optimization:

```bash
uv run run_benchmark.py run ollama -m "llama3.1:8b" \
  --optimize-prompts \
  --optimizer-model "llama3.3:70b"
```

Run with config:

```bash
uv run run_benchmark.py run ollama -m "llama3.1:8b" --config config.yaml
```

Useful checks:

```bash
uv run run_benchmark.py --help
uv run run_benchmark.py run --help
uv lock --check
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest -q
uv run python -m compileall -q run_benchmark.py benchmark models optimization scoring tracing utils
```

## Architecture Notes

Provider clients implement `APIClient`:

- `query(prompt, max_tokens, retries, temperature, seed) -> ProviderResponse`
- `list_models() -> list[dict]`
- `test_connection() -> bool`

Client creation is centralized in `models.create_client(provider, endpoint, model, api_key=None, timeout=None, keep_alive=None)`.

Default scoring is rubric-based and deterministic:

- v2 questions contain atomic rubric criteria, fatal-error patterns, acceptable variants, tags, and weights.
- Runtime rubric metrics are lexical coverage signals, not semantic proof of technical accuracy.
