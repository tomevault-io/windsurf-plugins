# Agent Guide for meta-qcom

This file guides automation agents to run builds / checks the same way CI does:

- use **kas-container** (isolated from host),
- keep `DL_DIR` and `SSTATE_DIR` outside the repo so caches are shared,
- run `yocto-patchreview` and `oe-selftest` routinely, and run
  `yocto-check-layer` before opening/updating a PR, via the CI helper scripts.

## Project Overview

meta-qcom is an OpenEmbedded / Yocto Project hardware enablement layer for Qualcomm based platforms.

## Agent skills

Reusable agent skills for the qualcomm-linux projects are maintained in
[qcom-linux-skills](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/qcom-linux-skills),
in the `SKILL.md` format understood by Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and
similar agents. Several of them cover the workflows described in this file,
such as `qcom-yocto-build-image` (build images with kas-container),
`qcom-yocto-pre-pr-checks` (the CI-parity checks from section 4),
`qcom-yocto-update-base-lock` (refresh `ci/base.lock.yml`), and
`qcom-flash-qdl` / `qcom-boot-validate` (flash and boot-test a board).
Install them with the repository's `install.sh` and prefer an existing
skill over re-deriving the workflow; improvements go back to that catalog.

## 1) Prerequisites

1. `kas-container` available on PATH, or set `KAS_CONTAINER=/abs/path/to/kas-container`
   (from [kas-container](https://github.com/siemens/kas/blob/master/kas-container)).
2. Container runtime access (Docker/Podman backend used by `kas-container`).
3. Work directories outside the repository for build outputs and shared caches.

### Container runtime smoke test

`kas-container` uses Docker when it is installed and falls back to Podman
otherwise (set `KAS_CONTAINER_ENGINE` to override), so check the engine it
will pick:

```sh
docker run --rm hello-world    # or, on a Podman-only host: podman run --rm hello-world
```

Notes:

- Do not use `sudo` unless the host setup explicitly requires it.
- Do not create or modify user groups as part of this workflow.

## 2) Recommended environment

If `KAS_WORK_DIR`, `DL_DIR`, and `SSTATE_DIR` are already set in the environment, use them
directly — do not override them. Only set defaults when they are absent:

```sh
export REPO_DIR="$(pwd)"                               # meta-qcom checkout
export KAS_WORK_DIR="${KAS_WORK_DIR:-/path/to/kas-work}"      # outside repo to avoid polling the checkout
export DL_DIR="${DL_DIR:-/path/to/shared-cache/downloads}"
export SSTATE_DIR="${SSTATE_DIR:-/path/to/shared-cache/sstate-cache}"
mkdir -p "${DL_DIR}" "${SSTATE_DIR}" "${KAS_WORK_DIR}"
```

## 3) Build with kas-container (CI style)

CI build composition pattern:
`ci/<machine>.yml[:ci/<distro>.yml][:ci/<kernel>.yml]`

Example:

```sh
export KAS_YAMLS="ci/rb3gen2-core-kit.yml:ci/qcom-distro.yml"
"${KAS_CONTAINER:-kas-container}" build "${KAS_YAMLS}"
```

## 4) Run routine checks via CI helper scripts

For routine local validation, run:

```sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-patchreview.sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/oe-selftest.sh
```

Run `yocto-check-layer` only before opening/updating a pull request:

```sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-check-layer.sh
```

### oe-selftest details

- Script: `ci/oe-selftest.sh`
- Auto-discovers tests in `lib/oeqa/selftest/cases/` when no test list is given.
- Honors `DL_DIR` and `SSTATE_DIR` from environment (recommended for shared cache).

Run a subset:

```sh
"${KAS_CONTAINER:-kas-container}" shell ci/base.yml \
  --command "/repo/ci/oe-selftest.sh /repo /work qcom_fitimage.QcomFitImageMatrixTests"
```

## 5) Direct kas shell alternative (no helper wrapper)

For one-off commands:

```sh
kas-container shell --skip repos_checkout ci/rb3gen2-core-kit.yml -c "bitbake <target>"
kas-container shell --skip repos_checkout ci/rb3gen2-core-kit.yml -c "oe-selftest --run-tests qcom_fitimage"
```

Use the helper scripts for CI parity whenever possible.

## 6) Pull request / contribution workflow

Changes reach `qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom` as GitHub pull requests against
**master**, from a topic branch in a fork that is rebased on the latest
upstream `master`; review iterates in the pull request discussion. Commit
requirements are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (see section 7).

Open a pull request, backports included, only when the user asks for one.
Every pull request lands in the maintainers' review queue, so one the user
did not ask for, or does not know about, is review load nobody wanted.
Otherwise, stop once the change is committed and tell the user it is ready.

Before opening/updating a PR, run CI-equivalent checks in this order:

```sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-patchreview.sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-check-layer.sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/oe-selftest.sh
```

## 7) Commit message best practices (project style)

Follow the commit subject and message requirements documented in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): an atomic change per commit, a
`recipe-name: summary of the changes` subject, a plain-English body that
explains the problem before the imperative actions, and the mandatory
`Signed-off-by` (and, when applicable, `Assisted-by`) trailers.

When committing programmatically, take the `Signed-off-by` identity from the
