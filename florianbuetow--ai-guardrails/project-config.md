# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents and AI-assisted development tools when working with code in this repository. This includes Claude Code, Cursor IDE, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and any other AI coding assistants.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains Copier templates for Python, Java, Go, Elixir, C++, Rust, Kotlin, and TypeScript (React) that enforce strict validation guardrails on AI-generated code — catching antipatterns, suppressing silent defaults, and providing immediate feedback so AI agents write better, more maintainable code from the start.

## Core Coding Principles

These rules apply everywhere — repo scripts, justfiles, test infrastructure, and all language templates:

1. **Fail fast — never swallow errors.** Always propagate errors and exit with code 1 immediately. No silent fallbacks, no `|| true`, no ignored return codes. Use `set -e` or `&&` chaining in shell scripts.
2. **No default values — never assume missing values.** Check for required values explicitly and exit 1 if something is missing. Default values mask underlying issues and make them hard to debug.
3. **Never suppress checks with annotations.** Fix the underlying issue instead. No `@SuppressWarnings`, `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `#[allow(...)]`, `NOLINT`, `// noinspection`, `NOSONAR`, `@dialyzer`, `# shellcheck disable`, or any other mechanism that silences a checker.
4. **Use `printf` for color output — never `echo`.** Some terminals won't render ANSI escape sequences with `echo`. In shell scripts and justfiles, always use `printf` for colored or formatted text output. Plain `echo ""` is acceptable only for blank-line spacing.

## Git Commit Guidelines

**IMPORTANT:** When creating git commits in this repository:
- NEVER include AI attribution in commit messages
- NEVER add "Generated with [AI tool name]" or similar phrases
- NEVER add "Co-Authored-By: [AI name]" or similar attribution
- NEVER run `git add -A` or `git add .` - always stage files explicitly
- Keep commit messages professional and focused on the changes made
- Commit messages should describe what changed and why, without mentioning AI assistance
- ALWAYS run `git push` after creating a commit to push changes to the remote repository

### Violation Tests (`violations/`)

- `violations/<language>/<rule-name>/...` contains file overlays that intentionally introduce one forbidden pattern.
- Each violation case must map to an existing guardrail rule (Semgrep, Credo, or other checker) and use valid, compilable code.

**How violation testing works:**

The key principle is that we test the generated project's own CI justfile targets — the same `just code-semgrep`, `just code-security`, etc. that developers run. We're verifying that the project's built-in guardrails catch forbidden patterns, not running checks some other way.

1. **Generate** a fresh project from the template into a temp directory.
2. **Baseline** — run the project's full CI (`just ci`) on the clean project. It must pass. This confirms the template itself is valid.
3. **For each violation:**
   a. **Inject** — copy the violation's overlay files into the generated project (originals are backed up).
   b. **Stage** — `git add -A` so tools like semgrep see the new/changed files.
   c. **Run the project's targeted justfile recipe** — e.g. `just code-security`, `just code-semgrep`. The recipe name is read from a `check` file in the violation directory; if absent, defaults to `code-semgrep`.
   d. **Expect failure** — the justfile target **must exit non-zero**. If it passes, the project's guardrail failed to catch the violation and the test fails.
   e. **Restore** — put original files back and reset git state for the next test.

This is an inverted test pattern: a passing test means the project's own CI caught the bad code.

**To add a new violation test:**

1. Create a new subdirectory under the target language (for example `violations/python/no-default-values/`).
2. Add only the files that must be overlaid onto the generated project.
3. Optionally add a `check` file containing the justfile recipe name to run (one line, e.g. `code-security`). If omitted, `code-semgrep` is used.
4. Ensure the injected code triggers the intended rule without relying on placeholder/broken syntax.

### The Python CLI Template (`blueprints/python-cli-base`)

- Python 3.12+ with uv package management
- Project structure: src/, scripts/, data/
- Validation: ruff, mypy, pyright, bandit, semgrep, deptry, codespell, pip-audit, pytestarch, pytest
- Conventions: Justfile workflow, strict directory organization, no pip or python directly

### The Java CLI Template (`blueprints/java-cli-base`)

- Java 21+ with Gradle Kotlin DSL
- Validation: Spotless, Checkstyle, Error Prone, javac -Xlint:all -Werror, SpotBugs, semgrep, codespell, Gradle Versions Plugin, ArchUnit, JUnit 5

### The Go CLI Template (`blueprints/go-cli-base`)

- Go 1.23+ with Go modules
- Project structure: cmd/, internal/, scripts/, data/
