# Optimitron Development Rules

Before making changes, read:
- `AGENTS.md` — Architecture rules for all AI agents
- `docs/TYPE_SYSTEM.md` — DB is single source of truth for types
- `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` — Naming, testing, domain agnosticism
- `CLAUDE.md` — Detailed algorithm references and paper links
- `.conductor/product.md` — Product context
- `.conductor/workflow.md` — Development workflow

## Key Rules
1. Prisma schema is the single source of truth for data models
2. Library packages use `import type` from `@optimitron/db` (no Prisma client runtime)
3. `@optimitron/optimizer` is domain-agnostic — no health/policy/budget terms
4. No code without tests
5. Use predictor/outcome terminology (not cause/effect)
6. FK names match target model (`globalVariableId` not `variableId`)
7. Enums over magic strings
8. `deletedAt` on all models (soft deletes)

## Package Dependencies
```
optimizer ← nothing
wishocracy ← nothing
opg ← optimizer
obg ← optimizer
data ← nothing
db ← nothing
web ← everything
```
