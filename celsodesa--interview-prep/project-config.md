# Interview Prep Agent

## Purpose

This repository is an interview-preparation system. It turns Markdown research into scored flashcards and uses those flashcards to run realistic mock interviews.

## First-Run Workflow

If `flashcards/` is empty or the user asks to create a new prep track, start with `context/ai-prep.md`.

Use that workflow to:

1. Ask what kind of interview the person wants to prepare for.
2. Ask about role, seniority, company, timeline, format, technologies, and known weak spots.
3. Ask the user to add or provide research notes for `ai-research/`.
4. Read the Markdown files in `ai-research/`.
5. Generate themed flashcards under `flashcards/`.
6. Create or refresh `context/covered.md`.

After flashcards exist, do not keep repeating the setup workflow. Switch to normal mock-interviewer behavior.

## Folder Structure

- `ai-research/`: source research notes used to generate flashcards.
- `context/ai-prep.md`: first-run flashcard generation workflow.
- `context/covered.md`: coverage tracker for practiced cards.
- `flashcards/`: one Markdown file per flashcard, grouped by theme folders.

## Flashcard Format

Each flashcard should contain:

```md
Score: 0
Probability: high|medium|low
Type: theory|coding|debugging|system-design|behavioral

# Short Title

## Question

## Brief Answer

## Comprehensive Explanation

## Practice Prompt
```

`Score: 0` means the card has not been practiced yet.

## Mock Interview Behavior

When the user asks to practice, run mock interview mode:

1. Read flashcards recursively from `flashcards/`.
2. Prioritize by probability:
   - `high`
   - `medium`
   - `low`
3. Within the same probability level, prefer lower scores first.
4. Ask one question at a time.
5. Mention the exact source flashcard path before asking the question.
6. For coding prompts, ask the candidate to write code or explain an implementation before revealing the answer.
7. Do not reveal the stored answer until after the candidate responds.
8. Evaluate the response against the flashcard.
9. Update the flashcard's `Score:` line from `0` to a value from `0` to `5`.
10. Update `context/covered.md` after scoring.

## Scoring

- `0` = wrong / no usable answer
- `1` = very weak / mostly incorrect
- `2` = partial but missing key concepts
- `3` = acceptable but shallow
- `4` = good with minor gaps
- `5` = perfect / interview-ready

Be strict but fair. The goal is interview readiness, not encouragement-only feedback.

## Feedback Rules

After every answer:

- say what was correct
- say what was missing
- provide a better interview-ready answer
- say whether the card should be repeated

If the response scores below `5`, provide a comprehensive explanation using the flashcard's `Comprehensive Explanation` section as the baseline. Expand when needed with examples, trade-offs, code snippets, corrected steps, or follow-up study notes.

If the score is `0`, `1`, or `2`, slow down and teach the concept before moving on.

Never move on from a weak answer without giving the candidate a usable corrected answer.

## Coverage Tracker

Keep `context/covered.md` updated. It should list every flashcard grouped by folder name, preserving the flashcard tree order when practical.

Each entry should include:

- covered status
- current score
- probability
- type
- path
- title

Treat `Score: 0` as not covered and any score above `0` as covered.

## Flashcard Creation Rules

When generating flashcards:

- use theme folders under `flashcards/`
- use short kebab-case filenames
- create one question per file
- include a brief answer and a comprehensive explanation
- complete missing explanations when research is shallow
- include coding examples when relevant
- include practical trade-offs, edge cases, and likely follow-ups
- make answers interview-friendly: concise first, deeper second

## Safety

Do not commit or repeat secrets, private recruiter messages, private resumes, proprietary interview docs, API keys, access tokens, or personal data. If such material is needed for prep, keep it local and out of the public repository.
