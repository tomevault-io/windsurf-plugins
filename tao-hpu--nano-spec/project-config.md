description: Nano-spec task specification methodology - create and manage lightweight task specs with 4 documents
---


# nano-spec Instructions for Cursor

## What is nano-spec?
A lightweight task specification methodology using 4 documents:
- README.md (Context)
- todo.md (Plan + Acceptance Criteria)
- doc.md (Technical Decisions)
- log.md (Progress Journal)

## When to Create a nano-spec
- User asks to "create a spec for..."
- User asks to "plan a task..."
- User describes a multi-step development task
- User wants to document a technical decision

## How to Generate

### Step 1: Understand the Task
Ask clarifying questions if the description is vague:
- What's the end goal?
- What's explicitly NOT in scope?
- Are there dependencies on other work?

### Step 2: Create Files
Generate in `tasks/{task-name}/` or project root, following the exact structure below:

#### README.md
```markdown
# {Task Name}

## Background
{Why does this task exist? What problem are we solving?}

## Goals
- {Goal 1}
- {Goal 2}

## Scope

### In Scope
- {What's included}

### Out of Scope
- {What's NOT included - be explicit}

## Dependencies
- [ ] {Dependency 1 - e.g., another task, external API, team decision}

## Resources
- {Link to related docs}
- {Link to external references}
```

#### todo.md
```markdown
# TODO

## Research
- [ ] {Research item 1}
- [ ] {Research item 2}

## Implementation
- [ ] {Task 1}
- [ ] {Task 2}
- [ ] {Task 3}

## Verification
- [ ] {Verification step}

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] {Criterion 1 - specific, measurable}
- [ ] {Criterion 2}

### Nice to Have
- [ ] {Optional criterion}

### Out of Scope
- {Explicitly NOT part of this task's acceptance}
```

#### doc.md
```markdown
# {Task Name} - Technical Document

## Summary
{One paragraph summary of the solution/outcome}

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: {Title}
- **Options considered**: A, B, C
- **Chosen**: B
- **Rationale**: {Why B?}

## Technical Details

### Architecture / Data Flow
```
{Diagram using ASCII or describe the flow}
```

### Interfaces / Schema
```typescript
// Key interfaces if applicable
interface Example {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
```

### Implementation Notes
- {Note 1}
- {Note 2}

## Open Questions
- [ ] {Unresolved question 1}
- [ ] {Unresolved question 2}

## References
- {Link 1}
- {Link 2}
```

#### log.md
```markdown
# Development Log

## {YYYY-MM-DD}

### Done
- Task created

### In Progress
- {What's ongoing}

### Blocked
- {What's stuck and why}

### Notes
- {Discoveries, learnings, things to remember}

---

<!-- Copy the template above for each day -->
```

### Step 3: Confirm
Show user what was created and ask if adjustments needed.

## Updating Existing Specs
- Read all 4 files first to understand context
- Keep acceptance criteria aligned with changes
- Add log entry for significant updates

## Key Principles
1. Boundary first - scope before code
2. Acceptance criteria - know when done
3. Decisions documented - for future reference
4. Progress logged - track the journey
