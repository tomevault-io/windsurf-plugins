# Working in this repo

`mineru-runpod` is a published RunPod Hub serverless template. `main` is
released automatically: every push runs semantic-release, which reads the commit
titles, decides the next version, tags it, and publishes a GitHub Release. There
is no separate "release" step a human performs.

Read that again before you commit anything, because it is the fact behind the
rule below.

## Versioning

The version number here describes a **deployment template**, not a library on an
index. Neither client is published to PyPI -- both install from a git URL, so no
resolver ever reads the number and nobody can range-pin it. That is what makes the
scheme below workable, and it is also why the changelog carries the weight the
version number would carry elsewhere.

**Major** is reserved for an upstream engine major: a new major of `MinerU` or of
its models. It is the one fact a template user acts on, because it is when output
and behaviour actually move. The engine is minor-locked in `requirements.txt`
(`mineru[core,vllm]>=3.4.0,<3.5.0`), so this cannot happen by accident.

**A breaking change to the template's own contract ships on a minor.** A renamed
job field, a default that flips, a value that used to be accepted and now is not.
These do not earn a major, because reserving the major for the engine is what makes
the major mean something.

Two rules keep that from becoming a way to break people quietly:

1. **Use the `contract:` commit type.** It bumps the minor and renders its own
   section at the top of the release notes. A contract break committed as `feat:`
   is a contract break nobody will find.
2. **Use the `compat:` commit type for an installability break.** Raising
   `requires-python`, dropping a supported interpreter, removing an import path. Also
   a minor, also its own section at the top of the notes.

   It is deliberately *not* a major. Nothing range-pins a git-URL install, so a
   major version cannot warn those users any better than a release note can -- while
   spending the major here would leave it one behind the engine major it is reserved
   for, and further behind after every such change. The notes are the channel that
   reaches them; the digit is not.

State the engine version explicitly rather than encoding it in the major digit --
in the README, the docs compatibility table and `.runpod/hub.json`. "Version 4.0.0"
tells nobody which MinerU they are getting.

None of this changes the rule above: whether a change is worth a major is the
owner's call every time, never the agent's.

## Never mark a change breaking on your own

**Do not put `!` in a commit title, and do not write a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer,
without explicit approval from the human you are working with.** Ask first, in
plain words, and let them decide.

A `!` is not a note for readers. It is an instruction to cut a **major version**
and publish it, with no further gate. An agent that adds one has decided the
version number and shipped it.

This is written here because it happened here. On 2026-08-24 a per-job SSRF
hardening on `server_url` was committed as `fix(schema)!:` — it did reverse
behaviour that was documented and tested, so the marker was defensible as a
*proposal*. It reached `main` and released **2.0.0**: a major version, for four
bug fixes and one hardening change. Reversing it meant deleting a published
Release and tag and force-pushing `main` back to 1.10.1. The owner's verdict:
"you released 2.0 version just because of some nit bug fixes we decided to make."

So when a change might break a consumer — a renamed or removed job field, a
default that flips, a value that used to be accepted and now is not, a job that
used to succeed and now fails validation — **stop and ask**. Describe what breaks
and for whom, then offer the alternatives:

- ship it as breaking, and let the major version happen deliberately;
- put the new behaviour behind an opt-in env flag so no existing job breaks;
- drop it.

Whether a change is worth a major version is the owner's call every time, never
the agent's. The safe default when unsure is the opt-in flag — for the case
above, `MINERU_ALLOW_LOCAL_FETCH` already existed, so the whole break was
avoidable.

## Never replay a PR branch onto main

The same day, a commitlint `subject-case` failure needed one commit message
reworded on an open PR. The five commits were cherry-picked onto `origin/main`
and force-pushed. That put them in main's ancestry, semantic-release fired 31
seconds later, and GitHub auto-closed the PR because its commits were already in
the base branch. The review was bypassed and the release above went out.

To rebuild or reword a PR branch, replay onto the branch's **own base commit**,
never onto `origin/main`. Before force-pushing, check all three:

```bash
git merge-base --is-ancestor <new-head> origin/main   # must FAIL
git merge-base origin/main <new-head>                 # must be the original fork point
git diff <old-head> <new-head>                        # must be empty
```

`git diff` being empty does not make a force-push safe. It says the content is
unchanged; it says nothing about where the commits now sit. Making a PR's commits
reachable from `main` is a merge whatever it is called — and here a merge is a
release.
