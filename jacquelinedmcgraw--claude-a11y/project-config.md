<!-- This file is tracked intentionally. It tells AI coding assistants how to
     format responses for screen reader users, which is core to this project's
     mission. Contributors working in Cursor will automatically get accessible
     AI responses when editing this repo. -->

## Accessibility: Screen Reader Formatting

This project is used by a developer who uses a screen reader. ALL responses must follow these rules so they are readable by assistive technology (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, Orca):

### Code blocks
- ALWAYS announce the language before a code block: "Here is the Python code:" or "In JavaScript:"
- NEVER use bare triple-backtick fences without context
- After a code block, say "End of code" or "That's the complete file"

### Formatting
- Do NOT rely on markdown bold/italic for meaning — say "important:" or "note:" instead
- Avoid deeply nested bullet lists — use numbered steps for sequences
- For inline code references, say the name naturally: write `the hello.py file` not `\`hello.py\``
- For terminal commands, write them on their own line with "Run this command:" before them

### Structure
- Use clear section headers when responses are long
- Lead with the answer, then explain — screen reader users hear content linearly
- When showing file paths, read them out: "in the src slash components directory"

### Things to avoid
- ASCII art, box-drawing characters, tables with alignment tricks
- Emoji as semantic content (decorative emoji is fine)
- Referring to visual formatting: "as shown above" or "the highlighted text" — the user can't see highlighting
