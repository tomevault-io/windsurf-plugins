# AI Agent Workflow (Agentic Development)

This project was developed with the assistance of **Antigravity**, an advanced AI coding agent by Google DeepMind. The development process followed a strictly "Agentic" workflow, where the AI was responsible for planning, executing, and verifying the technical requirements.

## 🤖 The Agent: Antigravity
**Antigravity** is not just a code generator; it is an autonomous problem-solver that operates within the developer environment.

### Capabilities & Responsibilities
- **Autonomous Planning**: The agent analyzed `Instructions_v4_dev_tools.md` and `criteriumAIDEV.md` to create a logical roadmap for Zoomcamp compliance.
- **Full-Stack Execution**:
  - **Backend**: Implemented FastAPI endpoints, SQLAlchemy models, and Alembic migrations.
  - **Frontend**: Refactored the web UI for better UX and "Walkie-Talkie" responsiveness.
  - **DevOps**: Configured multi-container Docker environments and GitHub Actions CI pipelines.
- **Dynamic Tool Interaction**: Used the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to interact with the system:
  - `read_file` / `write_file`: For precise code manipulations.
  - `run_command`: To execute complex git flows, run migrations, and execute test suites.
  - `browser_subagent`: To verify the deployed application on Render and debug UI issues.

## 👥 Human-Agent Collaboration
- **User Role**: Acted as the high-level architect and supervisor, providing API credentials and approving major architectural pivots (like the move to Pointer Events).
- **Agent Role**: Acted as the lead implementer, proactively identifying bugs (like Render migration issues) and proposing fixes.

## 🛠️ Tooling & Protocol
The agent utilized a suite of internal MCP tools to bridge the gap between LLM reasoning and the local filesystem:
- **Git MCP**: For structured commits, branch management, and repository cleanup.
- **Terminal MCP**: For real-time feedback during Docker builds and Pytest execution.
- **Browser MCP**: To step into the user's shoes and verify that the "Natural Voice" and "Leaderboard Removal" were correctly reflected in the live environment.

## 📈 Trajectory Example: "Zoomcamp Compliance"
1. **Audit**: Agent scanned the existing codebase to identify "Fork" history and leaderboard dependencies.
2. **Clean-up**: Agent purged the git history and removed the leaderboard backend/frontend logic.
3. **Enhancement**: Agent built the persistence layer (Database) and the testing suite (Pytest) sequentially.
4. **Verification**: Agent ran the tests locally, fixed regressions, and then monitored the Render deployment to ensure a successful "Go-Live".
