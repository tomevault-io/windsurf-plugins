# Project Instructions

- Keep the application read-only with respect to Claude Code and Codex source directories.
- Store user-owned metadata only in the application database.
- Do not hardcode user home paths. Preserve CLI, environment, and platform-default precedence.
- Add or update tests before changing provider parsers, indexing, search, rename, or favorite behavior.
- Run `corepack pnpm test`, `corepack pnpm typecheck`, and `corepack pnpm build` before handoff.
- Keep code, comments, and commit messages in English.
