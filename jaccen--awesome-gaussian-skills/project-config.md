# Awesome Gaussian Skills — Project Context

This project is the most comprehensive catalog and AI Agent skill pack for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) research, covering 713+ methods across 25 categories with 101+ known bug patterns.

> **Anthropic Skills Standard Alignment**: This project follows the SKILL.md standard format compatible with Claude Code (`.claude/`), Cursor (`.cursor/rules/`), and other AI Agent frameworks. Each skill includes YAML frontmatter (name, description, version, when_to_use, tags) and structured Markdown body with capabilities, instructions, and reference data. Target: `anthropics/skills` official repository listing.
