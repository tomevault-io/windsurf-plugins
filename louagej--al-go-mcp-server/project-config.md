# AL-Go MCP Server — Copilot Instructions

This workspace is the **AL-Go MCP Server** project. It provides MCP tools for AL-Go documentation, domain specialists, and knowledge sources.

## Always use `alg-*` tools for AL-Go questions

When the user asks anything related to AL-Go, Business Central CI/CD, or the domain specialists in this server, **always use the `alg-*` tools from the `al-go-docs` MCP server**. Never route AL-Go questions to bc-code-intel or any other MCP server.

Use `#tool-name` syntax to invoke a tool directly.
