# AI Agent Development Context

This document provides context for AI assistants working on the runt runtime
agent library.

**Current Status**: A robust runtime agent library with Python execution,
real-time collaboration, and streaming output support. It provides granular,
type-safe events for rich display capabilities and is implemented with a focus
on stability and extensibility.

## Project Overview

Runt is a TypeScript/Deno library for building runtime agents that connect to
[Anode notebooks](https://github.com/runtimed/anode). It uses LiveStore for
event-sourcing and real-time sync between multiple users.

**Current Status**: Working system with 58 passing tests. Core functionality is
implemented and published to JSR. The system includes Python execution via
Pyodide, real-time collaboration, executable installation support, and agentic
AI behavior with iterative tool calls.

## Architecture

- **Schema Package** (`@runt/schema`): LiveStore schema definitions with
  TypeScript types
- **Library Package** (`@runt/lib`): Runtime agent implementation with lifecycle
  management
- **Pyodide Package** (`@runt/pyodide-runtime-agent`): Python runtime using
  Pyodide with IPython integration for rich display support
- **Python Package** (`@runt/python-runtime-agent`): Stub for a native Python
  runtime agent. **Note: This package is not yet implemented.**
- **TUI Package** (`@runt/tui`): A terminal-based UI for viewing notebooks with
  cell-based scrolling and output display.
- **LiveStore**: Event-sourcing framework for local-first apps with real-time
  sync
- **Deno**: TypeScript runtime with built-in testing and formatting

## What Actually Works

- ✅ LiveStore integration with event-sourced state management
- ✅ Runtime agent lifecycle (start, execute, shutdown)
- ✅ Python code execution via Pyodide with rich formatting (matplotlib, pandas,
  HTML)
- ✅ Real-time collaboration via LiveStore sync
- ✅ CLI configuration with environment variable fallbacks
- ✅ Cross-package TypeScript imports with proper typing
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with multi-platform testing
- ✅ JSR publishing for all packages with executable installation
- ✅ Global executable installation as `pyrunt` or `pyorunt` (pyodide)
- ✅ Agentic AI behavior with iterative tool call responses
- ✅ Interrupt-aware AI conversations with configurable max iterations
- ✅ Streaming output support with granular event types
- ✅ MediaBundle system for multi-format rich outputs with AI conversion
- ✅ TUI with cell-based navigation, left gutter numbering, and reduced spacing

## Core Features

- **Streaming Output System**: Granular events for different output types
  (multimedia, terminal, markdown, error)
- **Python Execution**: Direct Pyodide integration with IPython rich display
  support
- **AI Integration**: Agentic behavior with tool calling and iterative responses
- **Real-time Collaboration**: LiveStore-based event sourcing for multi-user
  support
- **Rich Media Support**: Handle plots, tables, HTML, and custom display formats
- **Terminal Interface**: TUI with cell-based navigation, left gutter numbering,
  and predictable scrolling

## Design Goals

The TUI aims to provide a fluid, paper-like notebook experience that mimics
reading and navigating a physical notebook. Current implementation includes:

- **Cell-based navigation**: j/k keys move between cells rather than
  line-by-line scrolling
- **Left gutter numbering**: Consistent 2-character margin with cell numbers
  (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- **Reduced spacing**: `marginBottom={1}` between cells, single-line footer
- **Predictable viewport positioning**: Selected cells remain consistently
  positioned during navigation
- **Conservative height estimates**: Simple line counting for reliable scrolling
  behavior

## What Needs Work (Non-blocking)

- Pyodide package loading can be slow on first run
- Available Python packages are constrained by Pyodide ecosystem
- Publishing requires `--allow-slow-types` flag due to LiveStore's complex types

## Development Workflow

The user typically runs:

```bash
deno task ci        # lint, format, type-check, test
deno task test      # just run tests
deno task dev       # run example echo agent
```

For TUI development:

```bash
# Type checking TUI
cd packages/tui && deno check src/*.tsx

# Format check TUI
cd packages/tui && deno fmt --check src/

# Run TUI (requires notebook ID from Anode UI)
NOTEBOOK_ID=your-notebook-id pnpm dev:runtime
```

When making changes:

- **Create a branch first** - never commit directly to `main`
- Edit code
- Run `deno task ci` to check everything
- Commit changes with focused, descriptive messages
- Push branch and create PR
- GitHub Actions runs the same checks

## Schema Linking for Development

The `@runt/schema` package provides the shared types and events between Anode
and Runt. The linking method depends on your development phase:

### Production (JSR Package)

```json
"@runt/schema": "jsr:^0.6.2"
```

Use this for stable releases and production deployments.

### Testing PR Changes (GitHub Reference)

```json
"@runt/schema": "github:runtimed/runt#1d52f9e51b9f28e81e366a7053d1e5fa6164c390&path:/packages/schema"
```

Use this when testing changes from a merged PR in the Runt repository. Replace
