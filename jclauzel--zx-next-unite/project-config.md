# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

ZX-Next-Unite is a cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS) PySide6 (Qt6) GUI application written in Python. It combines two tools for ZX Spectrum Next users:

1. **SD Card Utility** — mounts HDF disk images and provides a file explorer for uploading/downloading content to them, then launching the CSpect or MAME emulator.
2. **NextSync** — implements the server side of Jari Komppa's NextSync protocol (TCP port 2048), allowing files to be pushed from the PC over Wi-Fi to a physical Spectrum Next machine. The app also implements a backwards-compatible **Sync4** extension that adds the reverse direction (`.sync -send <file|dir>` on the Next pushes files/directories *back* to the app); legacy **Sync3** dots keep working unchanged (PC → Next only). The `.dot` client source lives under `nextsync/sync/`.

Additional tabs provide online browsing of ZX Spectrum software via three third-party APIs: **GetIt** (`zxnext.uk`), **ZXDB** (`api.zxinfo.dk/v3`), and **zxArt** (`zxart.ee/api`).

## Running the application

```
python zx-next-unite.py
```

Requires Python 3.13+ and PySide6:

```
python -m pip install pyside6
```

No build step is needed for development. There are no tests or linters configured in this project.

For quickly eyeballing the retro "Alien Floyd" Sir Clive promenade animations
(the ones drawn in `zxnu_pygame.py`), pass `--anim` to force one to play first
and switch the mode on without touching Settings — e.g.
`python zx-next-unite.py --anim aliens`. Choices: `walk`, `c5`, `ufo`, `aliens`
(the last spawns Clive's saucer plus the attacking green alien squadron).
Requires pygame.

## Packaging (optional)

Create a standalone executable with PyInstaller:

```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --noupx zx-next-unite.py
```

If the optional itch.io feature is in use, also fully bundle `itch-dl` and its
dependencies so installs work in the frozen exe (its submodules are not pulled
in by a bare `import itch_dl`, and the in-process installer in `zxnu_itchio.py`
imports `itch_dl.config` / `handlers` / `downloader` / `keys` / `api`):

```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --noupx --collect-all itch_dl --collect-all bs4 zx-next-unite.py
```

Note: in a frozen build `sys.executable` is the GUI exe, not a Python
interpreter, so itch-dl must be driven in-process — never via
`[sys.executable, "-m", "itch_dl", …]`, which would just relaunch the app. See
`_install_in_process` in `zxnu_itchio.py`.

## Regenerating embedded Qt resources

Background images are compiled into `rc_backgrounds.py` from `rc_backgrounds.qrc`. Regenerate after adding/removing image assets:

```
pyside6-rcc rc_backgrounds.qrc -o rc_backgrounds.py
```

## Source file map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `zx-next-unite.py` | Entry point; contains the single `MainWindow(QMainWindow)` class and all tab/pane UI logic |
| `zxnu_config.py` | Constants, `SETTING_*` keys, API base URLs, UI string tables, color defaults, and pure helpers (`resource_path`, `qcolor_to_hex`, etc.) |
| `zxnu_workers.py` | Background threading primitives: `WorkerSignals`, `NextSyncSignals`, `HdfTaskSignals`, `HdfTaskWorker`, `HdfProgressDialog`, `DotDotFirstProxyModel` |
| `zxnu_media.py` | ZX Spectrum `SCREEN$` decoder (`ZxSpectrumScreen`), placeholder-pixmap rendering, file-format tag helpers, and the shared pixmap cache |
| `zxnu_gallery.py` | Reusable gallery widgets: `GalleryCell`, the scrollable grid view, and the `AnimatedBackground` widget |
| `zxnu_itchio.py` | Optional itch.io integration: `itch-dl` detection, itch.io API access (collections/owned/search via the user's API key) and install-via-`itch-dl`. Drives the optional itch.io tab |
| `rc_backgrounds.py` | Auto-generated Qt resource module (do not edit by hand) |

## Key architecture patterns

**Configuration** is stored in `hdfg.cfg` (a `key = value` file, INI-like) created in the same directory as the script. All setting key names are `SETTING_*` constants in `zxnu_config.py`. The `_initialising` guard on `MainWindow` prevents `save_configuration_file()` from firing while widgets are being constructed.

**Threading** follows a consistent pattern: long-running work (hdfmonkey commands, network fetches, NextSync transfers) runs in a `QRunnable` submitted to `QThreadPool`. Results are marshalled back to the UI thread via `Signal`/`Slot`. The signal classes (`HdfTaskSignals`, `NextSyncSignals`, etc.) live in `zxnu_workers.py`.

**External tool dependencies** — `hdfmonkey` is invoked as a subprocess for all HDF image operations. On Windows, the app can auto-download it from `https://uto.speccy.org/downloads/hdfmonkey_windows.zip`. CSpect and MAME are detected via PATH and launched as subprocesses. `resource_path()` in `zxnu_config.py` handles path resolution for both development (source tree) and PyInstaller-frozen (`sys._MEIPASS`) contexts.
