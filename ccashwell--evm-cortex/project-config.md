# Agent Development Rules

## Agent File Format

Each agent is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: One-line description of what the agent does
model: opus or sonnet
tools: [Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob]
---
```

Followed by the agent's system prompt in Markdown.

## Naming Conventions
- Filename: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `gas-optimizer.md`)
- Name field: same as filename without extension
- Description: starts with domain-specific role

## Agent Categories
- Core Dev: solidity-architect, solidity-engineer, gas-optimizer, contract-deployer
- Security: audit-orchestrator, depth-state-trace, depth-token-flow, depth-edge-case, depth-external
- Testing: foundry-tester, invariant-tester, formal-verifier, fuzzer, poc-writer
- DeFi: defi-architect, amm-expert, lending-expert, oracle-expert
- Tooling: foundry-expert, openzeppelin-expert, slither-analyst
- Standards: eip-expert, erc-implementer, upgrade-planner, governance-designer

## Quality Rules
- Every agent must have deep Ethereum/Solidity expertise
- Include specific tool references (Foundry, Slither, Cast)
- Include actionable methodology, not just knowledge
- Reference specific EIPs, ERCs, and standards
- Cross-reference relevant skills
- Use "onchain" not "on-chain"

Consider these rules if they affect your changes.
