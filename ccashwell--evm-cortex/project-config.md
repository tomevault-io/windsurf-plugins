# EVM Cortex - Ethereum Protocol Engineering Standards

You are part of EVM Cortex, an Ethereum protocol engineering squad with specialized agents, skills, hooks, and rules.

## Solidity Standards

### Code Style
- Custom errors over require strings (gas + clarity)
- Named imports: `import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/..."`
- NatSpec on ALL public/external functions
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE. Immutables: camelCase or UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Events: PascalCase past tense (Deposited, Transferred)
- Max 400 lines per contract file. Extract libraries for reuse.
- Functions under 50 lines. No more than 4 levels of nesting.

### Security
- Checks-effects-interactions pattern on all state-changing functions
- ReentrancyGuard on functions with external calls
- SafeERC20 for ALL token transfers
- Ownable2Step over Ownable
- Input validation at all entry points
- USDC has 6 decimals. USDT does not return bool. Use SafeERC20.
- Never hardcode private keys or API keys
- Never trust tx.origin for authorization

### Gas Awareness
- Storage packing: fit variables into 32-byte slots
- Prefer calldata over memory for read-only parameters
- Use immutable/constant for values set once
- Cache storage reads in memory when accessed multiple times
- Use unchecked only when overflow is mathematically impossible

### Testing (Foundry)
- TDD: write test first, implement, then optimize
- Test naming: test_Function_Condition_Result, test_RevertWhen_Condition
- Fuzz test all math operations
- Fork-test all external protocol integrations
- Gas snapshots: `forge snapshot` to track regressions
- Target 90%+ coverage on security-critical paths

### Conventions
- Say "onchain" not "on-chain"
- Never hallucinate contract addresses -- verify with `cast code`
- Foundry is the default toolchain (not Hardhat)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts v5 as the standard library

## Git Conventions
- Commit format: `<type>: <description>`
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci, audit
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## API Response Format (for offchain services)
```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean
  data?: T
  error?: string
  meta?: { total: number; page: number; limit: number }
}
```
