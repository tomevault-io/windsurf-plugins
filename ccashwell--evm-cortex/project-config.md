# Smart Contract Security Rules

## Mandatory Patterns

### Checks-Effects-Interactions
Every state-changing function MUST follow this order:
1. Validate inputs and permissions (checks)
2. Update state variables (effects)
3. Make external calls (interactions)

### Reentrancy Protection
- Use OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard on any function making external calls
- Even with CEI pattern, add the guard as defense in depth
- Watch for read-only reentrancy through view functions

### Token Safety
- ALWAYS use SafeERC20 for token transfers
- Check token decimals -- USDC=6, WBTC=8, most=18
- Handle fee-on-transfer tokens (received != sent)
- Handle rebasing tokens (stETH balance changes)
- Handle tokens with blocklists (USDC, USDT)

### Access Control
- Every state-changing function needs explicit access control
- Use Ownable2Step (prevents accidental ownership transfer)
- Use AccessControl for multi-role systems
- Add timelock for admin functions affecting user funds
- Document all privileged roles

### Input Validation
- Validate ALL external inputs (zero address, zero amount, bounds)
- Use custom errors with descriptive parameters
- Validate array lengths match in batch operations

## Vulnerability Checklist (Before Every PR)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Checks-effects-interactions followed
- [ ] ReentrancyGuard on external call functions
- [ ] SafeERC20 used for all transfers
- [ ] Access control on all state-changing functions
- [ ] Events emitted for all state changes
- [ ] Edge cases handled (0, max, empty state)
- [ ] No tx.origin usage
- [ ] External call return values checked
- [ ] No delegatecall to untrusted addresses

## When Security Issue Found
1. STOP current work
2. Classify severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. Write PoC test demonstrating the issue
4. Fix following the recommendation pattern
5. Verify fix with the PoC test
6. If secrets leaked: rotate immediately
