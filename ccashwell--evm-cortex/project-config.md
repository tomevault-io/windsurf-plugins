# Hook Development Rules

## Hook Architecture

Hooks are TypeScript files compiled to ESM bundles (.mjs) via esbuild.

Source: `hooks/src/*.ts`
Built: `hooks/dist/*.mjs`
Shared: `hooks/src/shared/*.ts`

## When to Create Hooks

Hooks automate actions around agent events:
- Pre/post edit actions (run forge build, slither)
- Session lifecycle (start, end, compact)
- Memory and learning operations
- Security scanning (credential detection, SAST)

## EVM-Specific Hook Patterns
- `forge-compile-check`: Run `forge build` after .sol file edits
- `slither-on-save`: Run Slither after Solidity changes
- `gas-snapshot-diff`: Compare forge snapshots after edits
- `natspec-enforcer`: Check NatSpec on public/external functions
- `storage-layout-check`: Validate storage layout for proxy contracts

## Quality Rules
- Hooks must be fast (< 5 second execution)
- Never block on long-running operations
- Handle errors gracefully (log and continue)
- Keep hooks focused on one responsibility
- Use shared utilities from `hooks/src/shared/`

## Build
```bash
cd hooks && npm run build
```

Consider these rules if they affect your changes.
