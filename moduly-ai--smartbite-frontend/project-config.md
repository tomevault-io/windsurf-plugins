## Current Technical State

### Live Demo Credentials

### Configuration API Schema
```javascript
// GET /config/system response:
{
  success: true,
  config: {
    registers: { count: 2, names: ["Register 1", "Register 2"], reserveAmount: 400, enabled: [true, true] },
    business: { name: "SmartBite Restaurant", timezone: "Australia/Sydney", currency: "AUD", taxRate: 0.10 },
    reconciliation: { dailyDeadline: "23:59", varianceTolerance: 5.00, requireManagerApproval: true },
    posTerminals: { count: 4, names: ["Terminal 1-4"], enabled: [true, true, true, false] }
  },
  timestamp: "2025-08-19T..."
}

// PUT /config/system - automatically cleans server fields before submission
```

### Authentication Flow
1. `authService.login(employeeId, pin)` → JWT Bearer token
2. Token auto-included in all API requests via `apiClient.js`
3. Role-based access (employee/owner) enforced server-side
4. Session persistence in localStorage with expiration handling

## Application Features

### 1. Multi-Step Cash Reconciliation

### 2. Dynamic Configuration Management

### 3. Role-Based Authentication
