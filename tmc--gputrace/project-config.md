# Agent Guidelines

- Build the CLI with `go install ./cmd/gputrace` or `make reinstall` on macOS when you need the bundled app flow.
- Validate changes with `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...`.
- Keep public user documentation in `README.md` and `docs/`.
- Put reverse-engineering notes and implementation archaeology in `docs/research/`.
- Keep unsupported experiments and local-only tooling out of the published repo.
- Do not commit local binaries, trace dumps, or generated screenshots unless they are intentional test fixtures.
