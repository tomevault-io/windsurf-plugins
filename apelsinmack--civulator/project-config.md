# Civulator - Project CLAUDE.md

> **Last updated**: 2026-03-03

## What Is This?

Civulator is a **research project** exploring deep reinforcement learning in a simplified Civilization-like strategy game. The goal is not just to build a working agent, but to **systematically measure what works and what doesn't** -- comparing architectures, state representations, reward functions, and training configurations through controlled experiments.

Every change should be accompanied by evidence: training curves, win rate plots, and documented comparisons against previous versions. We improve incrementally by measuring performance, not by guessing.

The game simulates hex-grid turn-based strategy with cities, units, combat, and terrain. RL agents learn to play via DQN with a Select-and-Move action architecture.

**Origin**: Started as a collaboration between Erik (Python/RL) and Patrik (C# game engine). The C# code is archived/legacy -- only the Python codebase is active (2026-03-05).

## Research Methodology

- **Baseline first**: Before changing anything, establish a measurable baseline (win rate, training curve shape, convergence speed).
- **One variable at a time**: When testing a new idea (e.g., different state encoder, new reward function), change only that variable and compare against the baseline.
- **Document everything**: Each experiment should record: what was changed, hypothesis, training parameters, results (plots), and conclusions.
- **Keep old results**: Training plots and win histories are saved in `stats/`. Never delete previous results -- they are the project's scientific record.
- **Reproducibility**: Use fixed random seeds. Log hyperparameters. Save model checkpoints so experiments can be replicated or resumed.

## Project Location

`C:\Users\steen\projects\civulator` (Work Desktop, cloned 2026-03-18)

## Current State (as of 2026-03-20)

- **Codebase**: `civulator/` Python package + `cpp/` C++ module (pybind11)
- **C++ module**: `civulator_core` — hex A* pathfinding, hex distance (built with CMake + MSVC)
- **Coordinate system**: Axial (q, r) — replaced offset even/odd system
- **State encoder**: EnhancedStateEncoder (25 channels), cached terrain, numpy-based (11x faster)
- **Config**: `config.toml` drives terrain, LoS, map gen, training params
- **Unit stacking**: 4 slots (military/civilian/siege support/great person)
- **Training**: Target network, epsilon decay (1.0→0.05 over 5000 episodes)
- **Networks**: FullyConvNetwork for large maps (no FC layers, map-size independent)
- **Current scale**: 8 players on 24x48 map
- **Viewer**: `scripts/watch.py` — raylib live viewer with hex grid, zoom/pan
- **GPU**: RTX 3060 (Work Desktop), PyTorch with CUDA

## Architecture Overview

See `documents/design_document.md` for the full architectural vision and refactoring plan.

### Key Files (current, pre-refactor)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `python/v2_debugging/pyCiv.py` | Game environment: Terrain, Tile, Map, Unit, City, Player, GameEnvironment |
| `python/v2_debugging/GlobalDQNetworkSelectingAndMovingMultipleAgents.py` | DQN agent, network, replay memory, training loop |
| `python/v2_debugging/main_trainer.py` | Entry point with CLI args |
| `python/v2_debugging/ascii_map_display.py` | Debug visualization |
| `python/v2_debugging/debug_integration.py` | Debug versions of key functions |

### Core Concepts

- **Hexagonal grid** stored as a 2D matrix with offset coordinates (even/odd row adjacency)
- **Cylindrical map** wraps horizontally, not vertically
- **Select-and-Move action space**: agent first selects a unit tile, then selects a destination tile
- **State tensor**: `[d, n, m]` where `d = 2*num_players + 1` (cities, unit health, movement points per player)
- **Agent builds its own state**: `build_state_tensor(game_env)` -- the environment exposes raw state, agent decides representation

### Known Issues

See design document for full analysis. Remaining:
- Q-values for select and move are summed (branching DQN — intentional design choice)
- Multiple units on same tile overwrite in state tensor (mitigated by slot system)
- Lots of commented-out old code in pyCiv.py (archived, not active)

### Fixed (2026-03-20)
- ~~No target network~~ → target network with periodic sync
- ~~8-directional move masking~~ → axial hex directions
- ~~Fixed epsilon~~ → linear decay from config.toml
- ~~Build agent only sees first city~~ → per-city state tracking

## Tech Stack

- Python 3 (anaconda base environment)
- PyTorch (needs CUDA reinstall for GPU training)
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## Related Projects

- **Breach** (another game with similar tile system -- can share tile/map design patterns)

## Development Notes

- All version folders (`v1/version1-4`, `v2_debugging`, `deepQlearningBot`, `pyCiv`, `misc`) are historical. The refactoring will consolidate into a single clean codebase.
- The game environment should remain a pure simulation with no RL dependencies.
- pyCiv currently imports torch, nn, F, plt -- these should be removed from the game module.
