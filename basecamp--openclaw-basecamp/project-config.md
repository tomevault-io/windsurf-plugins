# Basecamp Channel Plugin for OpenClaw

## What This Is

An external OpenClaw channel plugin that integrates Basecamp with OpenClaw's agent framework. Campfire chats, card tables, to-do lists, check-ins, pings, message boards -- every Basecamp surface becomes a live interaction point for AI agents.

This plugin is developed independently by the 37signals team and can later be nominated for upstream OpenClaw inclusion.

## Architecture at a Glance

- **Channel type:** `basecamp` -- registers via `api.registerChannel()` like any OpenClaw channel
- **Peer model:** All Basecamp places map to OpenClaw's `dm | group` peer kinds using `recording:<id>` / `bucket:<id>` / `ping:<id>` conventions. `parentPeer` enables per-project routing without schema changes.
- **Event fabric:** Composite ingestion from five sources -- Activity Feed, Hey! Readings, Assignments, Webhooks, and a Safety-Net reconciliation pass. SQLite-backed dedup with 24h TTL and cross-source secondary keys ensures exactly-once delivery.
- **Multi-persona:** Multiple Basecamp service accounts per deployment, mapped via `channels.basecamp.personas` (agentId -> accountId).
- **Outbound:** Chat lines, comments, card creation, and media via `@37signals/basecamp` SDK.
- **Auth:** OAuth browser-based login with automatic token refresh. Onboarding imports credentials from the Basecamp CLI if available.
- **Resilience:** Per-source circuit breakers on polling, exponential backoff retry on outbound sends, graceful shutdown with webhook deactivation and state flush.
- **Agent tools:** 10 channel-specific tools (create/complete/reopen todos, boost, move cards, post messages, answer check-ins, read history, generic API read/write).
