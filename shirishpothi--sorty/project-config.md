# Sorty - AI Coding Agent Instructions

- `make dev` = fast debug build, `make now` = fast build + launch, `make build` = full build with unit tests, `make ci` = local CI gate, `make test` = parallel unit tests.
- Single test: `swift test --disable-sandbox --filter SortyTests.TestClass/testMethod`; coverage: `make test-full`; `make test-ui` currently does nothing because UI tests are disabled.
- There is no dedicated `swiftlint`/`swiftformat` repo command today; do not invent one. Use `make ci`, compiler warnings, and tests as the quality gate.
- Xcode entry point is `Sorty.xcodeproj`; run the `Sorty` scheme for the app and build `SortyFinderSync` separately when changing Finder integration behavior.
- Main targets: `Sources/SortyApp` (app lifecycle/windowing), `Sources/SortyLib` (shared product code), `Sources/LearningsCLI` (`learnings` executable), `Sources/SortyFinderSync` (Finder Sync extension).
- Core flow is `View -> Manager/ViewModel -> FolderOrganizer -> AIClientProtocol -> OrganizationPlan -> preview/apply`.
- Keep shared logic in `SortyLib`; only app-entry glue belongs in `SortyApp`; new files under `Sources/SortyApp` and `Sources/SortyFinderSync` still need correct Xcode target membership.
- Key internal APIs/services: `FolderOrganizer`, `AIClientProtocol` + `AIClientFactory`, `PromptBuilder`, `ModelCatalog`, `DeeplinkHandler`, `ExtensionCommunication`, `LearningsManager`, `SecurityManager`.
- `FolderOrganizer` owns the main state machine: `idle -> scanning -> organizing -> ready -> applying -> completed`.
- Persistence is not database-backed: there is no CoreData/SwiftData/SQLite layer. State is stored via `UserDefaults`/`@AppStorage`, security-scoped bookmarks, app-group IPC (`group.com.sorty.app`), keychain/security services, and app data files.
- Managers should be `@MainActor` `ObservableObject`s created in `SortyApp` as `@StateObject` and injected with `.environmentObject`.
- AI providers must implement `AIClientProtocol`, register in `AIClientFactory`, and keep provider-specific auth/network logic inside the client layer.
- Imports: one per line, Apple frameworks first (`Foundation`, `AppKit`, `SwiftUI`, `Combine`, etc.), local module imports last, and remove unused imports.
- Naming: `UpperCamelCase` for types, `lowerCamelCase` for members/tests/enum cases, predicate-style booleans, and typed `LocalizedError` enums with clear `errorDescription` for user-facing failures.
- Prefer Swift 6 concurrency (`async/await`, `Task { @MainActor in ... }`) over callback-heavy code; keep UI state mutations on the main actor.
- Tests should use `MockAIClient` where possible, create temp directories in `setUp`, clean them in `tearDown`, and preserve `accessibilityIdentifier` coverage on interactive UI.
- UI changes should preserve the existing polished macOS feel: subtle hover feedback, compact spacing, and short `.spring()` / `.easeInOut` transitions.
- Haptics are part of the contract: use `HapticFeedbackManager.shared.selection()` on hover, `.light()` or `.tap()` on click, and `.success()` / `.error()` for outcomes.
- For liquid-glass UI, use `systemLiquidGlassBackground(...)` and `systemLiquidGlassPopover(cornerRadius: 12)` only; never fake it with `.regularMaterial`, `.thinMaterial`, `.ultraThinMaterial`, custom blur, or clear-popover glass hacks.
