# For the AI agent running this project

Two separate modes - keep them separate, don't mix guidance between them.

## First-time setup (once only)

Triggers: "let's set up the LinkedIn outreach", "set me up for LinkedIn automation like this <repo URL>", or anything pointing at this project for the first time.

Follow **SETUP.md** exactly, start to finish - it has both the human steps and what you specifically need to do at each one. Do this once.

## Regular runs (every scheduled run, forever after)

Trigger: the prompt says "Follow outreach_run.md." or "Follow weekly_review_run.md."

Just follow that file. Do not read SETUP.md, do not re-ask about registering with Bloomy or connecting the MCP, do not re-interview the user about the product, ICP, or templates - all of that is already done. The one exception: if CAMPAIGN.md, PRODUCT.md, ICP.md, or TEMPLATES.md still show a `NOT CONFIGURED` marker, stop and point the user at SETUP.md instead of guessing or improvising.
