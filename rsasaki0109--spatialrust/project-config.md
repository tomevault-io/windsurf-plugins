# Long-horizon delivery

When the user asks to work a ROADMAP range, epic sequence, or says forms like
`iku`, `susumete`, `yatte`, `tudukete`:

1. Treat it as authorization to run end-to-end without step-by-step confirmation.
2. Default loop per deliverable: survey → ROADMAP slices → implement → tests →
   docs/CHANGELOG/notes → commit → push → PR → merge (unless merge is unsafe).
3. Prefer reviewable PR units (one Epic or one named slice family). Do not wait
   for the user between those steps.
4. Only pause for true blockers: irreversible git risk, secrets, or an explicit
   architecture fork with irreversible public-API consequences.
5. After merge, continue the next Epic in dependency order until the requested
   horizon is done or a blocker is reached. Report progress briefly in Japanese
   when the user has been using Japanese/romaji.
6. Never add `Co-authored-by: Cursor` to commits.
7. Keep `spatialrust-core` small; heavy formats/runtimes stay feature-gated
   dedicated crates.
