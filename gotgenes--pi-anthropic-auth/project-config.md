# AGENTS Guide: pi-anthropic-auth

This file contains shared context for agents working in this repository.
Keep it focused on information that multiple agents need: repository purpose, current architecture, constraints, commands, and known gotchas.
Do not turn this into a task log.

Project-level reusable workflows belong in `.agents/skills/`.
This repo currently includes skills for Anthropic OAuth debugging, Pi CLI repro loops, and Pi skill frontmatter conventions.

## Project

### Overview

`pi-anthropic-auth` is a small pnpm-based Pi package.
Its purpose is to minimally override Pi's built-in `anthropic` provider to improve Claude Pro/Max OAuth compatibility without breaking Pi's normal Anthropic API-key behavior.

The design intent is explicitly minimal.
Prefer wrapping or extending Pi's existing Anthropic behavior over replacing it wholesale.

### Primary Goal

Preserve all of Pi's normal Anthropic UX while adding only the compatibility layers Pi still appears to be missing for Claude Pro/Max OAuth.

That means preserving:

1. Built-in provider name: `anthropic`
2. Built-in model list
3. Normal Anthropic API-key behavior
4. Native `/login anthropic` UX

### Current Status

The current implementation does the following:

1. Re-registers the built-in `anthropic` provider with an `oauth` override only
2. Reuses Pi's native Anthropic login flow from `@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth`
3. Hardens refresh behavior so missing rotated refresh tokens fall back to the previous refresh token
4. Uses `before_provider_request` to shape only built-in Anthropic OAuth payloads
5. Prepends an Anthropic billing/content-consistency header block to `system[]`
6. Replaces Pi's default system prompt preamble with a minimal neutral prompt (inside `before_provider_request`, gated by the same OAuth detection)

It does not currently replace Pi's built-in Anthropic streaming transport.

## Principles

### Keep The Override Thin

Prefer the smallest integration point that works.
If Pi already supports a behavior upstream, reuse it instead of copying it locally.

### Preserve Built-In Behavior By Default

API-key Anthropic behavior is the baseline.
Any OAuth-specific logic must be narrowly gated so it does not affect non-OAuth Anthropic requests.

### Prefer Request Shaping Before Prompt Rewriting

Start with refresh-token hardening, billing/header injection, and exact request-shape fixes.
Do not add broader prompt rewriting unless real failures show it is necessary.

### Isolate Compatibility Logic

Anthropic validation rules drift.
Keep compatibility logic in small helpers so it is easy to adjust without touching the rest of the extension.

## Architecture

### Extension Surface

The main extension entrypoint is `src/index.ts`.

It currently uses two Pi extension seams:

1. `pi.registerProvider("anthropic", { oauth })`
2. `pi.on("before_provider_request", ...)`

All provider-specific logic (billing header injection, message ordering, system prompt shaping) is consolidated in `before_provider_request`, gated by `isOAuthAnthropicPayload`.

Important upstream behavior confirmed from `pi-mono`:

1. Re-registering `anthropic` with only `oauth` overrides `/login anthropic` auth handling without replacing built-in models
2. Omitting `models` preserves Pi's built-in Anthropic model list
3. `before_provider_request` runs for built-in provider requests, after Pi builds the provider-specific payload

### Local Files

Current source layout:

1. `src/index.ts`: extension registration
2. `src/anthropic-oauth.ts`: OAuth override wrapper and refresh fallback
3. `src/request-shaping.ts`: OAuth-only request shaping helpers
4. `src/system-prompt-shaping.ts`: minimal Anthropic OAuth prompt replacement for Pi's default prompt
5. `src/debug.ts`: opt-in structured debug logging for live OAuth repros

### Project Skills

Project skills live in `.agents/skills/`.

Current skills:

1. `anthropic`: Anthropic OAuth compatibility lessons and debugging workflow
2. `pi-cli-repro`: repeatable `pi -p ... -e ...` repro workflow
3. `frontmatter`: Pi skill frontmatter template and rules

### Upstream Dependencies

This repo depends on:

1. `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`
2. `@mariozechner/pi-ai`
3. `@anthropic-ai/sdk`

When possible, import Pi behavior from `@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth` rather than copying code from upstream.

## Upstream Findings

These were confirmed by inspecting upstream `badlogic/pi-mono`.

### Pi Already Handles

Pi's built-in Anthropic provider already includes:

1. Claude Code OAuth headers
2. Claude Code identity injection in `system[]`
3. Claude Code tool-name mapping
4. Native Anthropic OAuth login support

Note: Pi upstream already normalizes Anthropic OAuth tool names to Claude Code canonical casing. Do not add OpenCode-style `mcp_` tool prefix rewriting here unless a concrete Pi-specific transport failure proves the built-in normalization is insufficient.

### Gap Identified So Far

The clearest upstream gap found during initial inspection is refresh-token rotation robustness.
Pi's built-in Anthropic refresh helper currently expects a fresh `refresh_token` on refresh responses.
Other Pi OAuth providers already fall back to the previous refresh token when a new one is omitted.
