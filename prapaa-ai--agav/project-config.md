# Agents

Agents are named, purpose-built sub-agents that extend Agav with domain-specific capabilities. Each agent has its own tool set, system prompt, and isolated credentials. When your query involves a task an agent handles — listing GitHub PRs, searching Jira tickets, taking a screenshot — the LLM routes to it automatically.

## How agents work

When Agav starts, it loads all enabled agents and registers each one as a callable tool. The LLM reads a compact catalog (one line per agent, capped at ~500 tokens total) and chooses the right agent for the task.

An agent invocation runs a nested agent loop with the agent's tools, system prompt, and credentials — fully isolated from the parent session. Results stream back to you normally.

## Loading order

Agav discovers agents from three locations. Later tiers override earlier ones by name, so you can replace a bundled agent with a custom version:

| Tier | Location | Override priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bundled | Shipped with Agav binary (currently empty — reserved for future built-in agents) | Lowest |
| Global | `~/.agav/agents/` | Middle |
| Project | `.agav/agents/` in the working directory | Highest |

## Installing agents from the marketplace

Browse and install agents from the community marketplace:

```
/agents → [2] Marketplace
```

See [Agent Marketplace](/features/agent-marketplace) for full details.

## Creating agents

You can create custom agents directly from the TUI without writing a manifest by hand:

```
/agents → [3] Create
```

The **Create** tab opens a "My Agents" hub that lists your user-created agents and any saved templates. From here you can create a new agent or restore one from a template.

### Wizard flow

Selecting **New Agent** launches a four-step wizard:

1. **Name & Description** — pick a unique agent name and a short description of what it does.
2. **System Prompt** — write the agent's system prompt, or press `g` to auto-generate one. The LLM uses your name and description to draft a prompt you can edit before continuing.
3. **MCP Servers** — select which MCP servers the agent should have access to. The list is populated from your workspace config (`mcpServers` in `.agav/config.json` or `~/.agav/config.json`).
4. **Review & Save** — preview the full agent definition and confirm. The agent is saved to `~/.agav/agents/<name>/` and immediately available for use.

## Templates

When you delete a user-created agent, Agav automatically saves it as a **template** so you can recreate it later without starting from scratch.

- Templates appear in the Create tab's "My Agents" list with a `[template]` label.
- Opening a template pre-populates the wizard with the original name, description, system prompt, and MCP server selections — edit anything before saving.
- Press `d` on a template in the list to remove it permanently.
- Templates are stored in `~/.agav/agents/templates.json`.

## Per-agent MCP servers

Agents can declare MCP servers in their manifest. Each server entry supports an `env` field for passing environment variables (API keys, base URLs, etc.) to the server process.

Servers are started when the agent runs and stopped when it finishes — they are fully scoped to the agent's lifecycle and do not affect the parent session or other agents.

## Credentials

Each agent declares the environment variables it needs (`required-config` in the manifest). Credentials are:

- Stored encrypted in `~/.agav/agents/<name>/config.json` — never in plain text
- Injected into `process.env` only during that agent's execution — not shared with other agents or the parent session
- Editable from the agent inspect view: `/agents → inspect → e`

Agents with missing credentials show a `⚠ Needs config` indicator in the List tab. The LLM receives an error message if it tries to call an unconfigured agent.

## Tool permissions and confirmation

Every tool in an agent is classified as either `safe` (read-only) or `destructive` (creates, edits, or deletes data):

- **Safe tools** run without a confirmation prompt.
- **Destructive tools** pause and display a `[Y]es / [N]o / [A]lways` confirmation before executing.

The classification is declared in the agent manifest (`tool-permissions`) and is visible in the inspect view.

### Agent sandbox

Non-bundled agent tools run inside an OS-level sandbox that is **stricter than the shell sandbox** used by `run_command`:

| Property | Agent sandbox | Shell sandbox |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default policy | Deny all, then allow specific paths | Allow all, then deny specific paths |
| Network | Denied | Allowed |
| Filesystem writes | Working directory and temp directory only | Allowed except system directories |
| Credential directories | `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg` denied | Same |
| Environment secrets | Stripped (`KEY`, `TOKEN`, `SECRET`, `PASSWORD`, …) | Stripped |

On macOS the agent sandbox uses a deny-default Seatbelt profile; on Linux it uses Bubblewrap with `--unshare-net`. Bundled agent tools are excluded from sandboxing since they ship with Agav.
