# Rule Creation

## Category Organization

- Each directory in the rules folder represents a category
- When creating a new rule, attempt to fit it into an existing category
- Only create a new category if the rule cannot fit into any existing category

## Required Frontmatter

All rule files must include these fields in order:

```
---
alwaysApply: true | false
description: concise description
author: Himel Das
---
```

## Content Guidelines

- Be concise and generic
- Remain project and programming language independent
- Avoid code snippets, examples, or project-specific information
- Do not include confidential or personal information
- Explain what to do, not how to do it
- Follow professional best practices for AI agent rules

## File Format

- Always save rules in `.mdc` files
- Use lowercase words separated by dashes for filenames
