# pi-neuralwatt

Pi extension providing a Neuralwatt inference API provider.

## Purpose

Registers a `neuralwatt` provider with Pi that connects to [Neuralwatt Cloud](https://api.neuralwatt.com/v1), an OpenAI-compatible inference API with energy transparency. Models are hardcoded in `src/extensions/provider/models.ts` from the `/v1/models` API (including pricing, capabilities, and limits from the `metadata` field).

## Stack

- TypeScript (strict mode), pnpm, Biome, Changesets

## Scripts

- `pnpm typecheck` - Type check
- `pnpm lint` - Lint
- `pnpm format` - Format code
- `pnpm test` - Run model validation tests
- `pnpm changeset` - Create changeset for versioning

## Extension loading

Each extension in `pi.extensions` is loaded independently by Pi. They all call `await configLoader.load()` at startup (idempotent). The provider extension is always loaded and registers settings. Feature extensions check config at startup and listen for `neuralwatt:config:updated` events to toggle behavior at runtime.

Extensions self-register via `neuralwatt:extensions:register` events when the provider requests them (`neuralwatt:extensions:request`). This lets the settings UI show which features are actually loaded.

## Provider Configuration

- Provider name: `neuralwatt`
- Base URL: `https://api.neuralwatt.com/v1`
- API: `openai-completions`
- Auth: `auth.json` entry for "neuralwatt", fallback to `NEURALWATT_API_KEY` env var
- All models use `maxTokensField: "max_tokens"` and `supportsDeveloperRole: false`

## Quota Tracking

Two sources of quota data:

1. **Response headers** - `after_provider_response` event captures `x-allowance-remaining-usd`, `x-budget-remaining-usd`, `x-request-cost-usd`, `x-cache-savings-usd`, `x-subscription-plan`, `x-energy-included`, `x-energy-remaining`, `x-energy-used` from every Neuralwatt response. Emitted as `neuralwatt:quotas:updated` events (throttled to 5s).

2. **API fetch** - `/v1/quota` endpoint returns full balance, usage, limits, and subscription info. Used for the `/neuralwatt:quota` command and initial session fetch.

### Subscription vs credits

When a subscription is active, energy is the primary billing method. Credits are on-demand top-up only. The quota warnings system respects this: it only warns about credits when there is no active subscription. When subscribed, only energy warnings are shown.

### Quota tabs

- **Subscription** — plan details, energy quota with progress bar, billing period. Only shown when subscribed.
- **Credits** — credit balance with progress bar, accounting method.
- **Usage & Key** — monthly usage (cost, requests, tokens, energy), API key info, key allowance, rate limits. Always shown.

## Settings

`/neuralwatt:settings` allows toggling:
- **Quota command** (`quotaCommand`) - Show/hide `/neuralwatt:quota` command
- **Quota warnings** (`quotaWarnings`) - Enable/disable low quota notifications
- **Sub-bar integration** (`subBarIntegration`) - Show/hide usage in status bar

The provider itself cannot be disabled. Settings can also be changed via `pi config`.

## Model loading

The provider registers on startup with `NEURALWATT_MODELS` (hardcoded definitions) so models are available without network. Models must be updated manually in `src/extensions/provider/models.ts` when the Neuralwatt API adds or changes models.

## Updating Models

1. Check the Neuralwatt API (`https://api.neuralwatt.com/v1/models`) for current model list
2. Compare against hardcoded definitions in `src/extensions/provider/models.ts`
