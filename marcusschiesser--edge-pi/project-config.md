# Development Rules

## First Message

If the user did not give you a concrete task in their first message,
read README.md, then ask which module(s) to work on. Based on the answer, read the relevant README.md files in parallel.

- packages/env/package.json
- packages/coding-agent-sdk/package.json
- packages/coding-agent/README.md

## Code Quality

- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Check node_modules for external API type definitions instead of guessing
- **NEVER use inline imports** - no `await import("./foo.js")`, no `import("pkg").Type` in type positions, no dynamic imports for types. Always use standard top-level imports.
- NEVER remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated dependencies; upgrade the dependency instead
- Always ask before removing functionality or code that appears to be intentional
- Never hardcode key checks with, eg. `matchesKey(keyData, "ctrl+x")`. All keybindings must be configurable. Add default to matching object (`DEFAULT_EDITOR_KEYBINDINGS` or `DEFAULT_APP_KEYBINDINGS`)

## Commands

- After code changes (not documentation changes): `npm run check` (get full output, no tail). Fix all errors, warnings, and infos before committing.
- Note: `npm run check` does not run tests.
- NEVER run: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm test`
- Only run specific tests if user instructs: `npm test -- test/specific.test.ts`
- When writing tests, run them, identify issues in either the test or implementation, and iterate until fixed.
- NEVER commit unless user asks

## GitHub Issues

When reading issues:

- Always read all comments on the issue
- Use this command to get everything in one call:
  ```bash
  gh issue view <number> --json title,body,comments,labels,state
  ```

When creating issues:

- Add `pkg:*` labels to indicate which package(s) the issue affects
  - Available labels: `pkg:env`, `pkg:coding-agent-sdk`, `pkg:coding-agent`
- If an issue spans multiple packages, add all relevant labels

When closing issues via commit:

- Include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the commit message
- This automatically closes the issue when the commit is merged

## PR Workflow

- Analyze PRs without pulling locally first
- If the user approves: create a feature branch, pull PR, rebase on main, apply adjustments, commit, merge into main, push, close PR, and leave a comment in the user's tone
- You never open PRs yourself. We work in feature branches until everything is according to the user's requirements, then merge into main, and push.

## Tools

- GitHub CLI for issues/PRs
- Add package labels to issues/PRs: pkg:env, pkg:coding-agent-sdk, pkg:coding-agent

## Testing pi Interactive Mode with tmux

To test pi's TUI in a controlled terminal environment:

```bash
# Create tmux session with specific dimensions
tmux new-session -d -s pi-test -x 80 -y 24

# Start pi from source
tmux send-keys -t pi-test "cd /Users/badlogic/workspaces/pi-mono && ./pi-test.sh" Enter

# Wait for startup, then capture output
sleep 3 && tmux capture-pane -t pi-test -p

# Send input
tmux send-keys -t pi-test "your prompt here" Enter

# Send special keys
tmux send-keys -t pi-test Escape
tmux send-keys -t pi-test C-o  # ctrl+o

# Cleanup
tmux kill-session -t pi-test
```

## Style

- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text
- Technical prose only, be kind but direct (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")

## Examples

- Prefer streaming (`agent.stream()`) in examples.
- Use `printStream(result)` to show output in examples.
- Exception: `examples/02-streaming.ts` should demonstrate raw `textStream` usage.
- Only use non-streaming (`agent.generate()`) when the example specifically needs a final aggregated result object.

## Changesets

- Do not manually edit `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Use Changesets for all user-facing changes: `npm run changeset`.

### Rules

- Create a changeset for any user-facing change.
- Do not include manual changelog edits in feature PRs.

## Adding a New LLM Provider

Adding a new provider requires changes in `packages/coding-agent-sdk` and `packages/coding-agent`:

### 1. Model Registry (`packages/coding-agent-sdk/src/core/model-registry.ts`)

- Add the provider to the model registry
- Map to the standardized `Model` interface

### 2. Model Generation (`packages/coding-agent/scripts/generate-models.ts`)

- Add logic to fetch/parse models from provider source
- Generate model definitions

### 3. Coding Agent (`packages/coding-agent/`)

- `README.md` and `docs/providers.md`: Add provider setup instructions
- Add a changeset via `npm run changeset`

## Releasing

We use **Changesets** for release management.

- **Lockstep versioning** is enforced via Changesets `fixed` groups.
- Create a changeset for any user-facing change: `npm run changeset`

### Steps

1. Add changesets for the changes you want to release:
   ```bash
   npm run changeset
   ```

2. Bump package versions + update changelogs:
   ```bash
   npm run version
   ```

3. Publish to npm:
   ```bash
   npm run release
   ```

## **CRITICAL** Tool Usage Rules **CRITICAL**

- NEVER use sed/cat to read a file or a range of a file. Always use the read tool (use offset + limit for ranged reads).
