## Repo Notes

- When debugging provider failures in this repo, check `logs/provider-calls.log` for the exact request payload, target, response body, and provider error message.
- When debugging command execution or build/test failures in this repo, check `logs/shell-exec.log` for the executed command, policy outcome, exit code, stdout, and stderr.
- These logs are written automatically when Navi is launched from a workspace that contains a `Makefile`.
- If a user reports that a recent code or prompt change is not taking effect, verify whether an older daemon or TUI instance is still running before assuming the current binary is wrong.
