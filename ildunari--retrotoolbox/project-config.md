# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Static Socket Configuration

**CRITICAL**: RetroToolbox MUST use port 3004 exclusively:
- **Tailscale Access**: http://100.x.x.x:3004 (replace x.x.x with your Tailscale IP)
- **NEVER use `serve` command or dynamic ports**
- **Always use `npm run dev` which runs on port 3004**

## Project Overview

This is a React-based retro arcade game collection featuring multiple classic games with modern enhancements. The application uses a fully modular architecture with individual game components and optimized core systems.

## Development Commands

**Essential Commands for Codex:**
- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 3004 (REQUIRED for testing)
- `npm run build` - Build production bundle
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality checks
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix ESLint issues
- `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript type checking without building
- `npm install` - Install dependencies (run after package.json changes)

## Architecture

**✅ Fully Modular Implementation Complete**

The application uses a complete modular React architecture with extracted components:
- **Main App**: `src/App.tsx` handles game routing, settings, and statistics
- **Game Components**: Individual games in `src/components/games/` with full implementations
- **Core Systems**: Optimized shared systems in `src/core/` for audio, input, and particles
- **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements in `src/components/ui/` for menus and effects

**Extracted Core Systems**

All core systems have been optimized and extracted to `src/core/`:
- **SoundManager.ts**: Web Audio API sound engine with programmatic effects
- **InputManager.ts**: Unified input handling for keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepad
- **ParticleSystem.ts**: High-performance visual effects system
- **GameTypes.ts**: TypeScript interfaces and type definitions

## Key Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, useMemo)
- Game state persisted to localStorage (settings and high scores)
- Game loop implemented with requestAnimationFrame

### Canvas Rendering
- Each game uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Responsive canvas sizing with window resize handlers
- Custom particle effects and visual feedback

### Implemented Games

**✅ All Games Fully Implemented in Modular Components:**
1. **Snake++** (`SnakeGame.jsx`): Complete with power-ups, lives system, and particle effects
2. **Neon Pong** (`PongGame.jsx`): Complete AI opponent with difficulty scaling and visual effects  
3. **Brick Breaker** (`BreakoutGame.jsx`): Complete breakout clone with multi-hit bricks and power-ups
4. **Tetris Remix** (`TetrisGame.jsx`): Complete with enhanced mechanics and animations
5. **Space Defense** (`SpaceInvadersGame.jsx`): Complete with progressive enemy waves and upgrades
6. **Pac-Man** (`PacManGame.jsx`): Complete with maze navigation and mobile touch controls

## Development Notes

### Current Development Status

**✅ Modular Architecture Complete**
1. All games successfully extracted to individual components
2. Core systems optimized and moved to `src/core/`
3. All games fully functional with enhanced features
4. Shared utilities implemented for common game functionality

**Enhancement Opportunities**
1. Add multiplayer functionality to existing games
2. Implement achievement and progression systems
3. Add new game variants or difficulty modes
4. Enhance mobile touch controls and responsiveness
5. Add background music and enhanced sound effects

### Adding New Games (Current Process)
With the modular architecture in place:
1. Create new game component in `src/components/games/`
2. Follow the established pattern from existing game components
3. Import and add to `gameComponents` object in `src/App.tsx`
4. Add game metadata to `games` array in `src/App.tsx`
5. Integrate with core systems (SoundManager, ParticleSystem, InputManager)
6. Test thoroughly on desktop and mobile devices

### Sound System
- Sound effects are generated programmatically using Web Audio API
- Methods: `playTone()`, `playCollect()`, `playHit()`, `playGameOver()`, `playPowerUp()`
- Volume and enabled state controlled through settings

### Performance Considerations
- Particle systems are pruned when life <= 0
- Canvas operations are optimized with minimal redraws
- Game loops use deltaTime for consistent gameplay across frame rates

## Testing and Debugging with Playwright MCP

### Setup Local Playwright MCP Server

**IMPORTANT**: Always use the local headless Playwright MCP server for testing changes in RetroToolbox.

#### Installation (if not already installed):
```bash
# Install as dev dependency
npm install @playwright/mcp@latest --save-dev

# Add local MCP server
claude mcp add playwright-headless -s local -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest --headless
```

#### Verify Installation:
```bash
claude mcp get playwright-headless
```

### Testing Protocol

**CRITICAL**: After EVERY code change, especially for games, you MUST:

1. **Navigate to the game**:
   ```typescript
   mcp__playwright-headless__browser_navigate({ url: "http://localhost:3004" })
   ```

2. **Take screenshots before/after changes**:
