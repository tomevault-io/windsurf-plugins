# tweetxvault — Agent Guide

See `docs/PLAN.md` for the implementation plan, `docs/README.md` for the documentation index, and `reference/` for third-party repo snapshots.
This `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` covers ground rules, workflow, and repo conventions.

Instruction precedence: if this file conflicts with platform/system/developer instructions, follow those first.

## Project Overview

tweetxvault is a Python tool for regularly exporting Twitter/X bookmarks and likes into a local embedded database (SeekDB). Implementation details live in [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md).

Notes:
- `docs/initial/` is historical and intentionally frozen (do not edit; it may contradict current plans).
- `reference/` is for study only (read-only snapshots).

## Work Tracking

### WORKLOG.md (repo root)

Maintain `WORKLOG.md` in the repo root. This is the cross-session handoff file. Log all major actions — not just task completions:
- Implementation decisions and rationale
- Dependency additions and version info
- Blockers encountered and how they were resolved
- Config or infrastructure changes
- Key findings or results

Format: reverse-chronological, date headers, bullet points. Keep entries concise with evidence (commands run, outcomes).

### docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md

For multi-step work, maintain `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` as a checklist:
- Update checkboxes as items complete
- Note blockers or deferrals inline
- Multiple agents may coordinate here — append/patch carefully, don't overwrite others' work

### docs/README.md

Index of all documentation. Keep in sync when adding/removing docs.

### docs/PUBLISH.md

When preparing or publishing a new version, follow `docs/PUBLISH.md` as the
release punch list. Release work must update version metadata, `CHANGELOG.md`,
related docs, validation/build steps, tag creation, and PyPI/GitHub bookkeeping.

## Concurrent Work

- Run `git status -sb` before starting work and before each commit.
- Other agents or the human may be working in the repo at the same time.
- Pre-existing dirty or untracked files are non-blocking; leave them untouched.
- Stage and commit only files for your active task.

### Single-File Contention

- If two agents need the same file and edits may overlap, **stop and await instruction**.
- The designated agent stages and commits their scoped hunks first to unblock others.
- Never resolve contention by force-staging the whole file or reverting another agent's work.

### Never Discard Others' Work

Do not use destructive commands unless explicitly instructed:
- `git restore`, `git checkout --`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean`
- `rm -rf`, overwriting redirects like `> file`
- Bulk rewrites that destroy local edits

## Development Workflow

### Before Picking Up Work

- Read `WORKLOG.md` and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` for current state
- Check git status/log for recent changes
- Review relevant docs (see `docs/README.md` for index)
- Confirm your approach aligns with documented plans

### During Execution

- Keep changes incremental and testable
- Log decisions and progress in `WORKLOG.md`
- Test before committing
- When adding or changing user-facing CLI flags, command groups, or status markers:
  - Give every new flag/argument explicit CLI help text; do not rely on bare Typer defaults
  - Update `README.md` when the behavior is user-facing, especially for operational flags, state markers, reset/clear commands, or anything users are expected to interpret from `stats`/CLI output
  - Add or update CLI help tests so representative `--help` output proves the new flags/markers are actually exposed

### After Changes

- Run targeted tests for changed scope
- Update relevant docs if behavior changed
- Commit promptly when a logical unit of work is complete (see Git Practices)

## Project-Specific Rules

### Credential Safety

- **NEVER** commit cookies, auth tokens, session files, or any credential material
- Browser profile paths should be auto-detected or passed as CLI args, never hardcoded with user-specific paths
- `.gitignore` must exclude: `*.sqlite`, `*.db`, `twitter_session.json`, any `data/` output directories

### Reference Directory

- `reference/` contains third-party repos for study — treat as read-only
- See `reference/README.md` for source URLs and descriptions
- Do not modify vendored code for style or cleanup
- Research notes about reference code go in `docs/`, not inside `reference/`
- **Use reference code only for Twitter API reverse engineering** (query IDs, feature flags, cursor formats, headers) — never copy architectural patterns, code structure, or implementation decisions from any reference project
- tweetxvault is its own project with its own architecture; if the only rationale for a choice is "another tool does it this way", reject it

## Git Practices

### Commit Timing

**Commit on completed logical units of work.** A task is a coherent change — not every file edit, but not only milestone closures either. Config changes, doc updates, dependency additions, and working feature increments are all committable units.

- **Commit immediately** after validation passes — do not ask, do not wait to be asked, just commit
