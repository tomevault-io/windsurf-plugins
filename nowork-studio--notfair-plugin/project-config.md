# NotFair — Skill Resolver for AI Agents

**This file is the universal entry point.** Any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Cursor, etc.) reads this to know which NotFair skill to run for which user intent.

If you are an agent and a user mentions Google Ads, Meta Ads, SEO, GEO, or anything in the tables below, route to the named skill.

---

## How to use this file

1. **Match the user's intent** against the rows below.
2. **Read the named skill's `SKILL.md`** from the path shown.
3. **Follow the procedure** in that SKILL.md exactly.

Skills under `seo/`, `paid-ads/`, `google-ads/`, `meta-ads/`, `gemini/`, and `notfair-upgrade-skill/` are **host-agnostic** — they work the same on every supported agent host.
