# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MCP server bridging AI assistants (Claude Desktop) and Elgato apps (e.g., Stream Deck) via the Model Context Protocol. The bridge discovers tools/resources from connected apps over IPC and exposes them to MCP clients through stdio or HTTP transports.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm build              # Compile TypeScript (outputs to bin/)
pnpm lint               # ESLint with zero warnings tolerance
pnpm lint:fix           # Prettier formatting
pnpm test               # All tests (Jest with ESM via --experimental-vm-modules)
pnpm test:unit          # Unit tests only
pnpm test:integration   # Integration tests only
pnpm test:coverage      # Tests with coverage report
pnpm test:watch         # Watch mode
```

**Run a single test file:**
```bash
node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js src/__tests__/unit/McpBridge.test.ts
```

**Run a single test by name:**
```bash
node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js -t "test name pattern"
```

## Architecture

**Data flow:** MCP Client → Transport (stdio/HTTP) → McpBridge → ClientManager → IpcClient → App IPC socket

Four core components:

- **IpcClient** (`src/IpcClient.ts`) — Generic IPC socket client for communicating with a single app. Manages connection lifecycle with dual reconnection strategy (signal socket + polling fallback). Handles request/response correlation with timeouts. Platform-aware: Unix sockets on macOS/Linux, named pipes on Windows.

- **ClientManager** (`src/ClientManager.ts`) — Manages multiple IpcClient instances (one per known app). Aggregates tools and resources with `appname__` prefixes and routes tool calls to the correct client. Forwards connection events and notifications.

- **McpBridge** (`src/McpBridge.ts`) — Protocol bridge creating the MCP server with tool/resource handlers. Delegates to ClientManager for tool/resource operations, manages change notifications, and forwards elicitation requests. Two factory functions: `createInitializedBridge()` for HTTP (manual transport attachment) and `createConnectedBridge(transport)` for stdio (single transport).

- **Transport layer** (`src/transports/`) — `stdio.ts` wraps StdioServerTransport for Claude Desktop. `http.ts` runs Express with StreamableHTTPServerTransport, session management, idle timeout cleanup, CORS, and optional ngrok tunneling.

Supporting modules: `types.ts` (IPC protocol types), `constants.ts` (socket paths, timeouts, app registry), `utils.ts` (tool/resource conversion, CLI parsing).

## Development Workflow

All feature additions, bug fixes, and refactoring follow a three-phase workflow (see `.augment/rules/workflow.md`):

1. **Analysis & Planning** — Analyze the request, present a detailed plan (files, approach, risks, scope), then **stop and wait for user approval**
2. **Implementation & Testing** — Implement changes, add/update tests, run `pnpm test` and `pnpm test:coverage`. If coverage thresholds can't be met after 2 iterations, ask the user
3. **Documentation** — Update `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `README.md`, and `src/__tests__/README.md` as applicable

## Testing

- Jest 30 with ts-jest ESM preset. Config in `jest.config.js`
- Coverage thresholds: 80% for statements, branches, functions, and lines
- Test helpers and mocks in `src/__tests__/helpers/testUtils.ts` (MockSocket, MockServer, MockTransport, MockMcpBridge)
- `clearMocks`, `resetMocks`, `restoreMocks` are all **false** — tests manage their own mock lifecycle
- `src/index.ts` is excluded from coverage (tested via integration tests)

## Code Style

- ESM modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json), target ES2022, strict TypeScript
- Tabs for indentation, 120 char max line length, LF line endings
- Uses `@elgato/eslint-config` and `@elgato/prettier-config`
- JSDoc required for public methods
- All `.js` extensions in imports (ESM requirement with NodeNext module resolution)


Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
Auggie mcp is the primary tool for searching the codebase. Please consider as the FIRST CHOICE for any codebase searches.
