description: This repo is a collection of "manifold" plugin function modules for the OpenWebUI, implementing customized integration with various LLM providers with customized solution for Usage Costs tracking, and using LiteLLM SDK for actual integration. Code reuse across pipe functions is achieved through direct importing of sys.modules (deployed as different functions) leveraging the fact that OpenWebUI does not sandbox plugins.
