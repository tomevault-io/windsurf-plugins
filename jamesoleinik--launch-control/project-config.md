# Dataverse security model conventions (Episode 8)

When authoring or changing the security model, follow the ordered runbook in
`episodes/ep-08-security/REBUILD.md` and load the `dataverse-security` skill
(`episodes/ep-08-security/SKILL.md`) first. The runbook is the source of truth for
the sequence and the exact prompts; this rule pins the conventions every script and
the visualizer must honor.

## Environment and identifiers

- Resolve the target environment from `.env` at the repo root via `scripts/auth.py`.
  Never hardcode an environment URL, tenant id, application id, user id, or UPN in
  committed code or docs. Use placeholders (`<ENV_URL>`, `<cowork-app-user>`,
  `<demo-user>`) in prose and resolve real values at runtime by query.
- `seed_ep08_demo.py` is gitignored because it carries real persona UPNs. It is
  local-only; do not commit it or move its contents into a tracked file.

## Naming (must match exactly)

- Roles: `lc Member` (Business User, User depth), `lc Owner` (Business Owner, BU
  depth), `lc Viewer` (Business Reader, read-only at BU depth), `lc Admin`
  (Business Admin). Created in the root business unit.
- Owner-teams: `lc Members`, `lc Owners`, `lc Viewers`, `lc Admins`, each bound to
  the matching role.
- Column security profile: `lc Sensitive Readers`. Masking rule: `lc_EmailMask`
  (mask character `#`, reveals the first character and the domain).
- Layer roles on top of `Basic User`; never strip a principal below `Basic User`.

## What is secured, and what is deliberately not

- Column security applies to **only** the two `lc_teammember` PII columns:
  - `lc_email`: secured **and** masked by `lc_EmailMask` (partial reveal).
  - `lc_fullname`: secured with **pure column-level security** (no masking rule); the
    profile read grant is revoked to hide it entirely.
- Do **not** secure the task or launch columns (no `lc_task.lc_blockerreason`, no
  `lc_launch.lc_risksummary`). That scope was removed; keep it out.
- Do **not** field-secure the primary `lc_name` column (Dataverse rejects it,
  `0x8004f501`). Real names live in the securable `lc_fullname` column; `lc_name` is a
  non-PII ID (`TM-001` ...).

## Mechanics that bite

- A **System Administrator bypasses column-level security** (always reads cleartext),
  but a **masking rule masks even a sysadmin's plain read**. Cleartext behind a mask
  returns only with `?UnMaskedData=true` plus a `Read unmasked` grant. Because of the
  sysadmin bypass, the visualizer reads the PII table as a non-admin member of the
  `lc Sensitive Readers` profile, so the live policy is visible.
- Grant `canread` (`4`) and `canreadunmasked` (`0`/`1`/`3`, never `4`) in the **same**
  payload; patching the unmask flag alone fails `0x80040203`.
- Un-securing a column is a **PUT** on the attribute with the concrete `@odata.type`
  plus `MSCRM.MergeLabels: true` and `Consistency: Strong`, then `PublishAllXml`. A
  PATCH returns 405. Setting `IsSecured=false` does not delete field permissions;
  delete them explicitly.
- Column masking rules require a **Managed Environment**.

## Script conventions

- Every setup and teardown script is **idempotent** and supports `--dry-run` (or
  defaults to dry-run, like `teardown_security.py`, which needs `--confirm` to apply).
  Always preview before applying.
- Set `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"` before running.
- Reset to a clean slate with `teardown_security.py --confirm`.

## Prose

- Do not use em-dashes (the `—` character) in committed prose or comments. Use a
  period, comma, colon, semicolon, or parentheses instead.
