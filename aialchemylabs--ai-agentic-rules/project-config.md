# Mission
You are implementing a new public GitHub repository named `ai-agentic-rules`. The repository provides universal, tool-agnostic instruction packs for AI coding agents, plus tool-specific adapters (Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Kiro, Gemini/Antigravity-style rules). Optimize for clarity, composability, and minimal drift.

# Non-negotiables
- Everything must be public-safe: no secrets, no internal URLs, no client names unless already public.
- Write instructions that are explicit, testable, and short. Prefer checklists and concrete commands.
- Avoid tool lock-in: canonical rules live in one place; adapters are thin pointers.
- Add a clear conflict-resolution policy between rule packs (e.g., Bun-first vs pnpm/Express/Jest references).

# Source material to incorporate (convert into modular packs)
1) Bun-first agent rules (commands, APIs, frontend bundling, testing) — treat as a dedicated pack.
2) AI coding standards (TS strictness, naming, repo structure, stack conventions, testing, security, CI gates) — treat as a dedicated pack.

# Deliverables (must create all)
## Repo structure
Create:
- README.md (what, why, philosophy, how to use, quickstart)
- LICENSE (MIT)
- packs/
  - bun-first/
    - RULES.md  (from Bun-first source, edited for public + clarity)
  - ai-coding-standards/
    - RULES.md  (from coding standards source, edited for public + clarity)
  - core/
    - RULES.md  (universal agent behavior: plan-first, verification, safety, small PRs, etc.)
  - profiles/
    - bun-stack.md   (how to combine core + bun-first + optional ts standards)
    - node-stack.md  (how to combine core + typical node toolchain, for compatibility)
- adapters/
  - cursor/
    - rules/
      - 00-core.mdc
      - 10-bun-first.mdc
      - 20-ai-coding-standards.mdc
      - 90-conflicts.mdc
  - vscode-copilot/
    - copilot-instructions.md
  - kiro/
    - project.md (or equivalent steering prompt; short pointer to packs)
  - antigravity-gemini/
    - GEMINI.md (supports @includes; point to packs)
- install/
  - install-to-home.sh  (installs to ~/.ai from this repo)
  - update.sh           (re-run install, idempotent)
- examples/
  - sample-repo/AGENTS.md (canonical repo-level entry file that points to packs + ~/.ai optional)

## Canonical approach
- Canonical human/agent entry file should be `AGENTS.md` in a consuming repo.
- Show how to layer: Org (~/.ai) -> Repo (AGENTS.md + .ai/) -> Domain/folder rules.
- Adapters must be thin: they mostly tell tools to follow AGENTS.md and/or the chosen profile.

## Conflict policy (must be explicit)
Create a “Conflict resolution” section that states:
- Specific overrides general.
- Repo overrides ~/.ai.
- Profile selection decides toolchain (bun-stack vs node-stack).
- If bun-stack is selected: bun install/test/build/serve and Bun APIs take priority.

# Implementation steps
1) Scaffold folders/files above.
2) Convert Bun-first rules into `packs/bun-first/RULES.md` and Cursor adapter mdc.
3) Convert AI coding standards into `packs/ai-coding-standards/RULES.md` and Cursor adapter mdc.
4) Write `packs/core/RULES.md` (universal behavior: plan-first for >30 LOC, verify commands, tests, security, doc updates, small diffs).
5) Write README with:
   - Why layered rules
   - Quickstart (choose profile, install ~/.ai, add AGENTS.md)
   - Tool adapters overview
6) Ensure install scripts are safe:
   - create ~/.ai
   - copy selected packs or full packs (choose full packs by default)
   - silently replace everything in ~/.ai-coding-rules/
7) Final output must include:
   - a concise list of created files
   - how to test install locally
   - how a consumer repo uses it (example snippet)

# Quality bar
- No contradictions left unresolved: if standards mention pnpm/express/jest, keep it under node-stack profile, and note bun-stack alternative.
- Keep each RULES.md under ~200-300 lines; break into sections.
- Use consistent language: MUST / SHOULD / MAY.
