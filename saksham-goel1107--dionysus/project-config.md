- `tsconfig.json` is strict; avoid `any` and prefer precise types
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes that will be extended; use `type` for unions and mapped types
- Derive types from data/validators (e.g., `z.infer<typeof schema>`) to ensure parity
- Use descriptive names (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`); avoid abbreviations
- Keep functions small with early returns and clear error handling
- Respect `@/*` alias for imports; avoid deep relative import chains
