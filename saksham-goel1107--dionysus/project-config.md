- Use Next.js App Router patterns (React Server Components by default; limit `use client` to UI/interaction surfaces)
- Prefer TypeScript everywhere; strict mode is enabled; avoid `any`; model inputs/outputs with `zod`
- Match existing formatting (Prettier) and lint rules; run `npm run check` before proposing large edits
- Respect path alias `@/*` mapped to `src/*`
- Keep secrets and keys server-side; never expose credentials to the client; use `server-only` where appropriate
- Data access via Prisma; validate at the edge of the system; avoid N+1 by selecting only required fields
- API communication via tRPC where possible; keep routers cohesive and types end-to-end
- UI with Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Radix; favor composition, accessibility, and responsive design
- Observe security headers and CSP intent; sanitize any user-generated HTML with `sanitize-html` or `dompurify`
- Prefer incremental, focused edits; avoid broad refactors unless requested and justified
- Document assumptions and edge cases in code comments only when non-obvious; keep comments concise
- Use Conventional Commits; do not modify unrelated files in a single edit
