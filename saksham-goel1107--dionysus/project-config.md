- Use Clerk for auth; rely on middleware guards for protected areas
- Do not leak user/session info to the client; serialize minimal data
- Respect `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and CSP defined in `next.config.js`
- Sanitize any user-provided HTML/Markdown; use `sanitize-html` or `dompurify` on the server when possible
- Prefer server-side checks over client-side gating
