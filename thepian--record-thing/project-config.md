# Record Thing Project Rules

## Swift Code Rules

- When using UIKit or AppKit specific functionality, create a cross-platform function or class that implements using AppKit or UIKit based on the OS.
- General purpose iOS and macOS functionality (Services, Views, Models and ViewModels) is stored in libs/RecordLib.
- Concrete functionality with App Specific configurations should not be placed in libs/RecordLib.
- Always add debug logs (os logger) & comments in the code for easier debug & readability.
- Wrap SwiftUI previews with `#if DEBUG`.
- Wrap Mock structs and classes with `#if DEBUG`.
- For components that react to events or external @State variables, a toolbar should be added to the preview that allows triggering changes and events.

## Logging in Swift View Components

- Use Logger with proper subsystem and category:
  ```swift
  let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.thepia.toytown", category: "ui")
  ```
- Always ensure you're not capturing sensitive or personal user input.
- Segment logs using different subsystems (e.g., data, UI, network) and categories.
- Adopt uniform naming conventions for loggers.
- Use different log levels depending on the build (more verbose in debug, minimal in release).
- Incorporate metadata for better diagnostics.

## Service Documentation

- Methods in a service must have a doc-string that includes when to use and from where it is expected to be called.
- A docstring for the Service Class must summarize the Application feature the service oversees.

## Target Platforms

- The app supports both iOS and macOS.
- Use conditional compilation where necessary to handle platform differences.

## Database Rules

- Use Blackbird ORM for database access.
- Follow the established schema in libs/record_thing/db/.
- Use SQLite with Vector Extensions for ML features.
- Database migrations should follow the pattern in the example SQL migrations.

## ML Processing

- Use DINO v2 for computer vision and scene recognition.
- Optimize ML processing for on-device execution.
- Use MLX framework for Apple Silicon optimization.
- Implement KNN-based scene recognition for categorizing captured images.

## Sync Strategy

- Use B2/Bunny CDN for asset synchronization and storage.
- Handle conflict resolution for offline changes.
- Support both local storage and cloud synchronization.

## UI Components

- Follow MVVM architecture pattern.
- Use SwiftUI for declarative UI.
- Ensure components adapt to different screen sizes and input methods.
- Maintain consistent UX across iOS and macOS.

## Project Structure

- iOS and macOS apps in apps/RecordThing
- Shared Swift code in apps/RecordThing/Shared
- Python backend in libs/record_thing
- Swift library in libs/RecordLib

## Development Workflow

- Use uv for Python environment management.
- Use xcodebuild for iOS and macOS builds.
- Use CLI tools for database management.
- Follow the established testing and QA process.
