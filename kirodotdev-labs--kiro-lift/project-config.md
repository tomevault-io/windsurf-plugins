# AGENTS.md — orientation for AI agents working in kiro-lift

Read this first. It captures what the project is, how it's wired, and the
conventions to follow so you can be productive without re-deriving everything.

## What this is

Lift for Kiro measures the **lift** of knowledge augmentations for Kiro (MCP servers,
skills, steering, agents) by paired A/B testing against a baseline, using
headless `kiro-cli` runs + multi-model LLM judging + paired stats. The shipped
worked example studies the **Agent Toolkit for AWS** (the managed AWS MCP Server:
docs, `recommend`, `call_aws`, and skills via `retrieve_skill`) vs a model with
native tools (web + AWS CLI) vs a bare model.

Key framing: the question is **where** augmentation helps and **whether it's
worth the overhead**, sliced by task stratum — not a single global score.

## How a run works (pipeline)

1. `harness/config.py` loads `Task`s (`tasks/<stratum>/<id>/task.yaml`),
   `Condition`s (`conditions/<name>/agent.json` + optional `workspace/`), and an
   `Experiment` (`experiments/*.yaml`).
2. `harness/experiment.py` orchestrates `task x condition x rep`, **one stratum
   at a time**, running optional `tasks/<stratum>/setup.sh` before and
   `teardown.sh` after (teardown always runs, even on error).
3. `harness/runner.py` writes the condition's agent JSON into a temp workspace
   and invokes `kiro-cli chat --no-interactive --agent <name> --model <m>
   --trust-all-tools` (+ `--require-mcp-startup` when the condition has an MCP).
   Retries transient backend errors; marks still-failing ones `invalid`.
4. `harness/parse.py` strips ANSI and extracts credits, time, tool calls, MCP
   server names, and the cleaned answer/transcript from stdout.
5. `harness/judge.py` scores the answer with several judge models (no-tools
   grader agent emitting a JSON verdict). The model under test is dropped from
   the judge panel automatically.
6. `harness/stats.py` aggregates the JSONL into a per-stratum report (success,
   lift vs baseline, capability-unlock, hallucination, overhead, McNemar p).

## Strata (tasks/<stratum>/)

`stable_public` (≈0 lift sanity), `recent` (post-cutoff gap), `correctness`
(plausible-but-wrong), `architecture` (usage-pattern → recommendation advice),
`api` (deterministic, fixture-backed AWS API questions), `skills` (procedural/
SDK-correctness — does a skill prevent the common model mistake?). The list of
valid strata is `STRATA` in `harness/config.py`; update it if you add one. Each
stratum has a `README.md` explaining its intent. The repo ships a deliberately
small, discriminative set — **2 tasks per stratum**.

## Conditions

Each condition is a directory `conditions/<name>/` with an `agent.json` (the
Kiro agent config) and an optional `workspace/` whose contents are copied
verbatim into each run workspace before the run — so a condition can ship skills
(`workspace/.kiro/skills/<n>/SKILL.md`), steering, or any other context as part
of the augmentation. All share an identical prompt + base tools
(`read`/`grep`/`glob`); only the added retrieval/API tools or workspace files differ.

- `lift-baseline` — bare model, no AWS access (the reference).
- `lift-baseline-native` — + Kiro's native tools: `web_search`/`web_fetch` **and**
  the AWS CLI (`use_aws`/`shell`, read-only). The realistic "native tools" bar.
- `lift-aws-mcp` — + the Agent Toolkit for AWS (managed AWS MCP Server) via
  `mcp-proxy-for-aws` (us-east-1 endpoint, operates us-west-2; SigV4 → needs
  creds). Provides docs + `recommend` + `call_aws` + skill discovery
  (`retrieve_skill`).
- `lift-skill` — bare model + a locally-provided skill (`aws-sdk-python-usage`)
  shipped in `workspace/.kiro/skills/`. Demonstrates testing a skill you bring
  yourself, vs the toolkit discovering it at runtime.

`_lift` metadata in each `agent.json` (`role`, `augmentation`) is harness-only
and stripped before the agent sees it.

## Fixtures / setup-teardown contract

A stratum may declare `setup.sh` / `teardown.sh`. The harness execs them from
the repo root with env:
- `KIRO_LIFT_FIXTURE_OUT` — path where setup writes a flat JSON of outputs
- `KIRO_LIFT_STRATUM` — the stratum name

The harness stays cloud-agnostic: it injects only the generic `KIRO_LIFT_*`
contract above and inherits the rest of the environment. Any cloud-specific
config (AWS region, credentials, profiles) is the hook's own concern — the `api`
hooks read region from `AWS_REGION` / `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` (default us-west-2).

setup writes e.g. `{"DataBucket":"...","AppSg":"..."}`; the harness substitutes
`${DataBucket}` etc. into each task's `prompt`/`answer_key`/`rubric` at runtime.
Token names match the CloudFormation Output logical IDs (which must be
alphanumeric — no underscores).
The `api` stratum's hooks deploy/delete `tasks/api/fixtures.cfn.yaml` (the
template lives with the stratum that uses it).
Keep all AWS specifics inside the bash hooks — the harness stays cloud-agnostic.

`requires_account` (a per-task gate) and fixtures (per-stratum setup/teardown)
are independent. `requires_account` means the task needs a live external account
/ credentials (provider-agnostic — AWS/Azure/Figma/…) and may cost money; such
tasks are skipped unless `--allow-account-tasks`. A fixture can provision
