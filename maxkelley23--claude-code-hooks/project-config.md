# activation-workflow

The skill activation workflow implements a multi-tiered decision system for determining which organizational skills should be activated based on user prompts.

## Priority Levels
- Critical: Highest priority skills requiring immediate activation
- High: Essential business capabilities
- Medium: Standard operational skills
- Low: Optional supporting capabilities

## Matching Mechanisms
1. Keyword Analysis
   - Direct text matching against prompt content
   - Organization-specific terminology detection

2. Intent Pattern Recognition
   - Regex-based intent identification
   - Context-aware pattern matching

## Enforcement Policies
- Block: Mandatory skill activation
- Suggest: Recommended skill usage
- Warn: Advisory notification

## Skill Categories
1. Domain Skills
   - Business-specific capabilities
   - Organization processes

2. Guardrail Skills
   - Compliance requirements
   - Safety protocols

## Activation Process
1. Rule Source Hierarchy
   - Multiple rule repositories
   - Precedence-based evaluation

2. Priority Resolution
   - Grouping by priority levels
   - Hierarchical skill activation
   - Conflict resolution between overlapping skills

3. Output Generation
   - Skill activation notifications
   - Enforcement policy alerts
   - Priority-based recommendations
