# Clean-code rules for ks-cookbook

Applies to every Python file under `flagships/`, `recipes/`, and `mcp-python/`.

## Hard constraints

### SRP
- Each function does one thing. If its name or its docstring needs "and", split it.
- Each module has one concern. `agent.py` wires the agent; `schema.py` holds the output model; `__main__.py` is CLI-only.

### Small units
- Functions ≤ 30 lines.
- Modules ≤ 200 lines unless there is a clear reason.
- Recipes ≤ 100 LOC total (docstrings + comments don't count). Larger → promote to `flagships/`.

### Naming
- Intent-revealing. No `data`, `info`, `handler`, `manager` unless domain-meaningful.
- Boolean predicates: `is_*`, `has_*`, `should_*`.

### DRY & composition
- No copy-pasted agent wiring across flagships. Use the same `MCPServerStdio` boilerplate; if you find yourself duplicating more than a few lines across files, factor into `_shared/`.

### KISS
- No speculative abstractions. Three similar lines beats a premature helper.

## Forbidden

### Magic values
- No magic UUIDs or strings in code. Folder IDs belong in the Makefile as per-demo env defaults, not hardcoded in `agent.py`.

### Deep nesting
- Guard clauses and early returns. Max nesting depth 3.

### "What" comments
- Only write comments that explain **why** (a hidden constraint, a workaround, a non-obvious tradeoff). Never comments that describe what a line does.

### Error codes / sentinel returns
- Raise an exception or return a typed result. No `return None` to signal "failure" alongside valid `None`.

### God functions
- No function that orchestrates, does I/O, and transforms data. Split into pure helpers + a thin orchestrator.

## Error handling

- Errors surface as exceptions, typed when possible.
- Never swallow an exception silently. If retrieval fails, say so in the output — don't emit made-up content.
- For MCP tool calls, let `MCPServerStdio` errors propagate. The CLI (`__main__.py`) catches and prints a useful message before exiting non-zero.

## Style

- PEP 8 via `ruff`. Line-length 100. Import order enforced (`ruff check`).
- Prefer explicit types on public functions (`-> Memo`, `-> list[Hit]`). Private helpers can infer.
- Use `pathlib.Path`, never `os.path`.
- Use `pydantic` for every structured output. Never return a raw `dict` from an agent.

## The four prompt invariants

These are in every flagship system prompt and must stay there:

1. Enumerate with `list_contents(folder_id=__CORPUS_FOLDER_ID__)` first.
2. Pass UUID `path_part_id` values to `read` — not document names.
3. Citations (`Citation.chunk_id`, or inline `[chunk:<uuid>]` tags) must be copied verbatim from `read` output. Never synthesize.
4. If a fact isn't in the retrieved material, say so and lower confidence. Do not fabricate numbers.
