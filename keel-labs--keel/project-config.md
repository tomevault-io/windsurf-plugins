# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
Use Codex in a strict human-led workflow. Codex writes and analyzes code; humans own scope, architecture, safety, review, and merge decisions.

## Team Roles
- `Driver`: defines the task, constraints, and definition of done.
- `Reviewer`: reviews diffs, challenges assumptions, runs spot checks, and approves or rejects the change.

Every non-trivial change should have a clear Driver and Reviewer.

## Branch Discipline
- Never do Codex work directly on `main`.
- Keep `main` releasable and in sync with remote.
- Use one branch per outcome.
- If scope expands, start a new branch.
- Preferred branch names:
  - `feature/<topic>`
  - `fix/<topic>`
  - `chore/<topic>`
  - `codex/<topic>` for temporary Codex-only work

Before starting work:
1. Confirm the current branch is correct.
2. Commit or stash unrelated local changes.
3. Pull or merge the latest `main` if needed.

Before opening a PR:
1. Rebase or merge from `main` when needed.
2. Resolve conflicts intentionally.
3. Re-run required checks.

## Worktree Discipline
- Prefer a separate worktree for each active Codex task when practical.
- Do not reuse a dirty worktree for unrelated work.
- If multiple people or agents are working in parallel, isolate them by branch and ideally by worktree.

## Task Framing
The Driver should provide:
1. Goal
2. Constraints
3. Definition of done
4. Likely files or subsystems to touch
5. Checks that must pass before handoff

Prefer small, reviewable tasks:
- one bug
- one feature slice
- one refactor
- one test addition

Avoid bundling feature work, refactors, and cleanup in one pass unless explicitly requested.

## Git Checkpoints
- Make a checkpoint before risky Codex changes.
- Prefer small, reversible commits over one large commit.
- Keep unrelated changes out of the same commit.

Good commit style:
- `feat: add token refresh flow for expired sessions`
- `fix: handle missing org id in audit export`
- `test: cover retry backoff edge cases`
- `refactor: split provider auth helpers from api client`

## PR Discipline
Every branch should go through a PR before merge.

PRs should include:
- clear title
- short summary
- risks or edge cases
- test evidence
- screenshots or logs when relevant

At least one human reviewer should approve before merge. Codex review can help, but it is not the only approval signal.

## Diff Review Rules
Review Codex output as a diff, not as trusted truth.

Review for:
- correctness
- scope creep
- unnecessary complexity
- missing tests
- security issues
- performance regressions
- hidden behavior changes
- weak naming or unclear abstractions

Reject changes that are difficult to explain simply.

## Testing And Verification
For non-trivial changes, Codex should:
1. add or update tests when appropriate
2. run the smallest relevant checks first
3. run broader required checks before handoff
4. report the exact checks run and the results

Default expectation:
- targeted tests for touched code
- lint, typecheck, and build when applicable

Do not claim success without reporting actual results. If checks cannot run, say so explicitly and explain why.

## Guardrails
Codex must not:
- invent requirements
- silently change public APIs without calling it out
- add dependencies unless explicitly approved
- mix unrelated cleanup into the same task
- disable tests or checks to get green results
- commit secrets, tokens, or private keys
- bypass review or merge policy

Codex should explicitly call out:
- ambiguous requirements
- data model or migration risk
- auth or permission changes
- infra or deployment impact
- backward compatibility concerns

## Git hygiene — never use blanket staging
**NEVER** use `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git commit -a` in this repository.
**ALWAYS** stage files by explicit name (`git add path/to/file.ts`).

This repository's checkout has historically overlapped with the maintainer's
personal workspace folders (`projects/`, `meetings/`, `daily-log/`, `inbox/`,
`knowledge-bases/`, plus `pulse.md`, `tasks.md`, `keel.md`). Those paths are
gitignored as a defense, but agents must not rely on `.gitignore` as the only
line of defense. If `git status` shows more files than the agent intended to
modify, the agent must stop and surface the discrepancy before staging.

This rule exists because in May 2026 a Claude session used `git add -A` and
inadvertently pushed personal documents (including a private interview
transcript) to a public branch. The branch was deleted within minutes but
the cached commit required a GitHub Support ticket to fully purge. Don't
repeat it.

Never use `git push --force`, `git push --force-with-lease`, or any
history-rewriting operation (`git rebase` of pushed branches, `git commit
--amend` of pushed commits, `git reset --hard` followed by push) without
explicit user authorization in the same conversation.

## Refactors And Dependencies
- Refactors should preserve behavior unless behavior changes are explicitly requested.
- Separate refactor commits from behavior changes when practical.
- Major dependency adds or upgrades require explicit approval.

When proposing a new dependency, explain:
- why it is needed
- why existing code or dependencies are insufficient
