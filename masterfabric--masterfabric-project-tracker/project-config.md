# mf-expo — Ship checklist (i18n + API + Changelog)

Treat a slice of **mf-expo** work as **not finished** until the items below are done when the change affects **user-visible UI**, **GraphQL usage**, **auth/session flows**, or **navigation** that operators or release notes should know about.

## 1. Review what changed

- Inspect recent edits: `app/`, `src/screens/`, `src/shared/services/` (especially `mf-go-api.ts`, `graphql-client.ts`), hooks, store, and `packages/masterfabric-expo-core` when shared UI/helpers changed.
- If the change is **internal-only** (refactor, types, no user-visible or API contract change), you may skip `CHANGELOG.md` unless release notes should still mention it.

## 2. Internationalization (i18n)

- **User-visible strings** belong in **`mf-expo/src/shared/i18n/translations/`** — update **`en.json`** and **`tr.json`** together for the same keys.
- Avoid hard-coded English (or Turkish-only) copy on screens users see; use `t('…')` / existing i18n helpers.
- After adding keys, quick sanity check: switch device language (or app language) if the feature exposes it.

## 3. GraphQL / backend coupling

- New or changed operations must be reflected in **`mf-go-api.ts`** (or explicit `graphqlRequest` / Particular envelope helpers) and match the **core-base mf-go** (and Particular) schemas the app targets.
- If the backend added fields or operations: confirm **`EXPO_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL`** / `local.env` and document any **minimum server version** in the PR description when relevant.
- Prefer **`graphqlRequest` options** (e.g. `silent: true`) consistent with nearby calls; handle older backends only when the product explicitly supports version skew.

## 4. UX / platform notes

- **Destructive or irreversible flows** (delete account, sign out, data loss): confirm confirmation UI, loading/error states, and **token/session cleanup** paths.
- **Modals / bottom sheets:** verify **small-screen height**, scroll, and safe areas; avoid clipping primary actions.
- **Navigation:** `expo-router` routes and auth gates (`isAuthenticated`) should remain consistent after the change.

## 5. Changelog

- Update repo-root **`CHANGELOG.md`** for user-relevant or operator-relevant **mf-expo** changes (features, notable fixes, breaking UI).
- Match existing style: version/date section, **`### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed`**, bullet lines prefixed with **`mf-expo:`** (see current file).

## 6. Paired backend work

If this PR depends on **core-base mf-go** or **particular-project-tracker** schema/behavior changes, those land in the sibling repos (see `.cursor/rules/backend-ownership.mdc`). Link sibling PRs and note deploy order in the client PR description.

## 7. Before the PR is merged (human copy + order)

- On GitHub, align the PR description and any first comment with **`.cursor/rules/pr-reviews.mdc`**: readable maintainer voice *before* marking Ready, then follow the **Merge progression** there (ship steps → prose → ready → CI → merge). Skip the human polish only for truly internal-only diffs that skip this checklist anyway.

---

If this rule is in context because **`mf-expo/**`** files were edited, perform steps **2–5** before ending the task when the change is **user-visible**, touches **GraphQL**, or should appear in **release notes**.
