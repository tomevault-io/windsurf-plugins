# Pull requests — review conventions

Use this when opening or updating a PR so reviewers and future you can ship safely.

## Human voice before the PR ships

Automation and agents tend to spit out stiff bullets. **Normalize on maintainer-shaped copy on GitHub** before you mark a PR ready or merge:

- **Pull request description** — Same facts as below (what / why / verify / risk / pre-review), but written in short, plain paragraphs: how you’d explain the change to a teammate, not a spec template. It is fine to keep checklists under that prose.
- **First PR comment (optional but encouraged when the diff is large or non-obvious)** — One short note in your own words: tradeoffs, what you did not do, or how you tested. This is not a substitute for the description; it is context that reads like a human thread.

## Before opening / marking Ready for review

1. **One coherent slice** — PR title and description match the diff; unrelated refactors or drive-by edits belong in a separate PR.
2. **Description** — Include:
   - **What** changed (user- or operator-visible behavior)
   - **Why** (problem, constraint, or ticket reference if you use one)
   - **How to verify** (commands, screens, Postman flows if API-related)
   - **Risk / rollbacks** if migrations, auth, or data deletion are involved
   - **Pre-review** — A short checklist in the PR body tying back to this section (one coherent slice, cross-project note if needed, applicable ship-checklist items marked N/A or done) so drafts are review-ready when marked ready.
3. **Cross-project** — If the PR depends on **masterfabric-core-base** (mf-go) or **masterfabric-particulars**, say how they deploy together (API / Particular first vs compatible client fallbacks) and link sibling PRs.
4. **Checklists** — When applicable:
   - **`mf-expo`:** `.cursor/rules/mf-expo-ship-checklist.mdc` (i18n + `CHANGELOG.md` + API usage)
   - Backend ship checklists live in the sibling repos that own mf-go / Particulars — see `.cursor/rules/backend-ownership.mdc`

## Merge progression (do in order)

1. **Finish the work in git** — Commits pushed; scope matches the title.
2. **Run the ship checklists** for every area you touched in this repo (`mf-expo` rules above). Skip only what those rules say is skippable.
3. **Open or update the PR** — Draft is fine while iterating. When the diff stabilizes, set the **description** to human-shaped prose + structured sections (see **Human voice** above).
4. **Optional thread comment** — Add a brief human note if it helps reviewers orient.
5. **Mark Ready for review** — Only after description + applicable checklists are honest.
6. **Merge** — After required CI / review policy; prefer updating local `main` (`pull`) right after. Delete the branch when your workflow allows (`After merge` below).

## For reviewers (and authors self-reviewing)

- Confirm **user-facing copy** has **EN + TR** (or project-agreed locales) when strings ship to the app.
- Confirm **GraphQL** client usage (`mf-go-api.ts` / `graphqlRequest` / Particular envelope) matches the **core-base** / Particular schemas the app targets.
- Prefer **small commits** with clear messages; squash policy is team choice, but history should remain understandable from PR description + commits.

## After merge

- Delete merged feature branches when your workflow allows; keep `main` the integration branch.
