# decompose — Project Instructions

Inherits from `../CLAUDE.md`. Read that first.

## What This Is

Decompose is the deterministic foundation of the echology system. It classifies any text into structured semantic units — authority, risk, attention, entities — without an LLM. No probability. No hallucination. No cost.

**This is the most important project in echology.** Every other system depends on it. Changes here propagate everywhere.

## Architecture

Five modules, one pipeline:

```
text → chunker → classifier → entities → irreducibility → DecomposeResult
```

| Module | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `chunker.py` | Semantic chunking, Markdown-aware, sentence-boundary splitting |
| `classifier.py` | Regex-based authority + risk + content type classification. Attention scoring. |
| `entities.py` | Regex entity extraction: standards, dates, financial values, legal references |
| `irreducibility.py` | Detects content that must be preserved verbatim (specs, limits, formulas) |
| `core.py` | Orchestration. `decompose_text()` and `filter_for_llm()` |

## Interfaces

- **Python library:** `from decompose import decompose_text, filter_for_llm`
- **CLI:** `decompose --text "..." --pretty` or piped stdin
- **MCP server:** `decompose-mcp --serve` (exposes `decompose_text` and `decompose_url` tools)

## Rules

- **Zero runtime dependencies.** The library itself imports nothing outside the standard library. `mcp` is only required for MCP server mode. Do not add dependencies.
- **Deterministic.** Same input always produces same output. No randomness. No LLM calls. No network calls (except `decompose_url` which fetches the URL, then classifies deterministically).
- **Published on PyPI** as `decompose-mcp`. Changes must not break the public API (`decompose_text`, `filter_for_llm`, `DecomposeResult`, `Unit`).
- **63 tests.** Run `pytest` before any commit to a core module. Do not reduce test coverage.
- **Regex patterns are the core IP.** When modifying classifier patterns, test against real documents from multiple domains (AEC, insurance, legal, general). A pattern that improves one domain but breaks another is rejected.
