# AGENTS.md

## Project Mission

Build a Windows-first Lightroom Classic exposure assistant.

The user opens a Lightroom folder, selects the intended photos, and runs
AI Exposure Assist. The system renders Lightroom previews, asks a vision
model to judge exposure consistency, writes approved exposure changes to
XMP sidecars, and returns a result report.

The MVP adjusts exposure only.

## Required Read Order

Before changing any file, read these files in order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `docs/XMP_SAFETY.md`
4. `docs/AI_JUDGE_CONTRACT.md`
5. `work-orders/CURRENT_WORK_ORDER.md`
6. The active work order referenced by `CURRENT_WORK_ORDER.md`

Do not begin implementation until the active work order is identified.

## Sources of Authority

Authority order:

1. Active Work Order
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. `docs/XMP_SAFETY.md`
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. Existing tests
6. Existing implementation
7. README

When authorities conflict, stop and report the conflict.

## MVP Workflow

The canonical workflow is:

1. User opens the intended Lightroom Classic folder.
2. User selects the intended photos.
3. Lightroom plug-in renders JPEG previews.
4. Plug-in writes an ordered manifest.
5. Python CLI validates the job.
6. Vision AI returns one decision per image.
7. Python validates and clamps decisions.
8. Existing XMP files are backed up.
9. Only `crs:Exposure2012` may be changed.
10. A result report is written.
11. User reads metadata back into Lightroom.
12. User reviews, rejects unwanted photos, and exports manually.

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

- Do not edit RAW, NEF, JPEG originals, or Lightroom Catalog files.
- Do not read or write `.lrcat`, `.lrcat-wal`, `.lrcat-shm`, or `.lrdata`
  directly in the MVP.
- Do not modify EXIF camera-capture fields.
- Do not modify White Balance, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Crop,
  Masks, Keywords, Rating, Label, Sharpening, or Noise Reduction.
- The only editable Lightroom development property is
  `crs:Exposure2012`.
- Back up every affected XMP before any real write.
- Default execution mode is `dry_run`.
- Never delete or move user photographs.
- Reject decisions are suggestions only in the MVP.
- Do not automate final export in the MVP.
- Never store API keys or secrets in tracked files.

## XMP Rules

- Treat `crs:Exposure2012` as an EV value.
- New exposure equals existing exposure plus validated AI delta.
- Preserve all unrelated XML elements, attributes, namespaces,
  whitespace where practical, and file encoding.
- Write through a temporary file and replace atomically.
- A failed write must leave the original XMP intact.
- Missing, malformed, or ambiguous XMP must stop that image and create
  a review result. Do not guess.

## AI Decision Rules

- Produce exactly one decision for every manifest image.
- Never invent filenames or file paths.
- Preserve manifest order.
- `delta_ev` must be numeric.
- Clamp `delta_ev` to the configured maximum.
- Low-confidence decisions must not be applied automatically.
- AI output is untrusted input and must be schema validated.
- The AI never writes files directly.

## Seven Execution Rules

1. **Task Classification**  
   Classify the task, scope, risk level, and required evidence before editing.

2. **Define Done First**  
   Identify acceptance criteria and completion evidence before implementation.

3. **Parallel Evidence Gathering**  
   Inspect repository truth, relevant files, tests, Git state, and governing
   documents before choosing a solution.

4. **Single Recommendation**  
   Once sufficient evidence exists, choose one best bounded approach.
   Do not delegate routine technical decisions back to the user.

5. **Surgical Change**  
   Make the smallest correct change. Touch only files and behavior required
   by the active Work Order.

6. **Verify by Execution**  
   Prove behavior by running the required tests, commands, or validation.
   Reading code or relying on a worker report is not sufficient evidence.

7. **Outcome-First Reporting**  
   Report the implemented outcome, validation evidence, Git scope, and
   remaining risks. Avoid unnecessary process narration.

## Four Common AI Failure Modes

1. **Memory Over Repository Truth**  
   Repository files, Git status, current HEAD, and executed evidence always
   override memory, prior summaries, and stale reports.

2. **Treating Worker Reports as Final Evidence**  
   A worker report is a claim. The final reviewer must inspect the actual
   diff, validation output, and repository state.

3. **Leaving the Proof Chain Open**  
   Work is not complete until acceptance criteria, tests, diff review,
   allowed-file scope, and Git status have all been verified.

4. **Unauthorized Scope Expansion**  
   Do not add refactors, frameworks, features, dependencies, or cleanup
   outside the active Work Order, even when they appear beneficial.

## Engineering Rules

- Work on one bounded Work Order at a time.
- Make the smallest safe change satisfying the Work Order.
- Do not redesign architecture unless explicitly required.
- Do not add frameworks without a demonstrated need.
- Prefer the Python standard library when practical.
- Add or update tests for every behavior change.
- Do not use broad staging commands such as `git add .`.
