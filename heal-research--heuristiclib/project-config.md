# AGENTS.md

Contributor contract for this repository. Durable architectural rationale lives in [docs/design-goals.md](/C:/Users/phili/Repositories/HeuristicLib/docs/design-goals.md).

## Project posture

- HeuristicLib is in an early alpha stage.
- Backward compatibility is not a design goal yet.
- Current code and docs describe the current implementation, not a frozen target architecture.
- Public APIs and OOP structure may change when a materially better design is justified.

## Design rules

- Favor SOLID design and clear responsibility boundaries.
- Design for the pit of success.
- Prefer strong static typing, explicit invariants, and compile-time safety over conventions or late runtime checks.
- Keep abstractions small, composable, and explicit.
- Keep behavior-affecting dependencies such as randomness, time, caches, and execution context explicit.
- Avoid unnecessary magic runtime machinery, global registries, and opaque indirection.
- Optimize for human users first, with clear naming and predictable contracts.
- Do not treat current folders, assemblies, namespaces, or package names as the intended final architecture.

## Changing the design

- Start with a concrete problem, not stylistic preference alone.
- Compare meaningful alternatives before committing to a new direction.
- Prefer replacing a weak API with a stronger one over preserving compatibility with weak patterns.
- Justify design changes with clear usage examples.
- Update docs, examples, and tests when the architectural story changes.

## Workflow expectations

- Design public APIs to be easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly.
- Keep examples small, explicit, and representative of the intended usage style.
- Add or update tests when behavior or invariants change.
- Prefer removing accidental complexity over preserving familiar but weak patterns.
- Keep documentation aligned with code.
