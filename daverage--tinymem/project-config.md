# TINYMEM AGENT CONTRACT (Governed — Task-Externalised)

This contract governs all repository-related behavior when tinyMem is present.
Non-compliance invalidates the response.

---

## 0. Scope

A request is **repository-related** if it touches:

* code
* files
* documentation
* configuration
* architecture
* tasks
* planning
* repository state

---

## 1. Core Principle

Observation is free.
Sequencing is authority.
Mutation is explicit.

---

## 2. Tool Definitions (Authoritative)

### Memory Recall

* `memory_query`
* `memory_recent`

Available in ALL modes (implementing "Observation is free").
Required before any mutation in GUARDED/STRICT modes.

### Intent Declaration

* `memory_set_mode`

Required before any mutation.

### Memory Write

* `memory_write`

The **only** permitted mechanism for durable memory.

### Task Authority

* `tinyTasks.md` in the project root
* Optional task-authority helper tool

---

## 3. Definitions

### Observation

Reading, inspecting, analyzing, summarizing, or asking questions.

### Mutation

Any durable state change, including:

* writing or modifying files
* creating, updating, or completing tasks
* writing memory
* promoting a claim to a fact, decision, or constraint

### Task Authority

`tinyTasks.md` is the single source of truth for task state.
Task state must never be inferred.

### Task Identification

The moment the agent identifies, implies, or sequences more than one actionable step.

This includes:

* plans
* approaches
* checklists
* ordered bullets
* “first / then / next”
* step-by-step reasoning

---

## 4. Modes (Intent)

You operate in exactly one mode:

* **PASSIVE** — observation only
* **GUARDED** — bounded, reversible mutation
* **STRICT** — maximum caution, full enforcement

Mode MUST be declared via `memory_set_mode` before mutation.

---

## 5. Rule Set (Stable IDs)

### R1 — Recall Before Mutation

Memory recall tools (`memory_query`, `memory_recent`) are available in ALL modes (implementing "Observation is free").

Before any mutation in GUARDED/STRICT modes, you MUST:

* call `memory_query` or `memory_recent`
* acknowledge the result (even if empty)

---

### R2 — Task Externalisation Is Mandatory

The agent may NOT hold a task list internally.

If **Task Identification** occurs:

1. All steps MUST be externalised into `tinyTasks.md`
2. No mutation may occur until task authority is resolved

If `tinyTasks.md` does NOT exist:

* Create it and populate it with a proposed task list via `task_add` (or standard file tools if MCP is unavailable)
* Optionally ask the user to verify the proposed tasks before proceeding
* If the user requests verification, wait for review
* If the user declines or does not respond, proceed immediately

Planning in the response body is prohibited once this rule triggers.

#### Task Proposal Allowance

The agent MAY populate `tinyTasks.md` with a proposed task list and ask the
user to verify before proceeding.  Verification is optional — the agent must
not block waiting for a response that may not come.

---

### R3 — Tasks Are Authoritative

If `tinyTasks.md` exists:

* Continue the **first unchecked subtask**
* If no unchecked subtasks exist, STOP and request user input

The agent may NOT:

* skip tasks
* reorder tasks
* redefine tasks
* invent progress

---

### R4 — Mutation Requires Intent

Before any mutation, ALL of the following MUST be true, in order:

1. R1 satisfied (memory recall in GUARDED/STRICT modes)
2. Intent declared via `memory_set_mode`
3. R2 satisfied (task externalised if required)
4. R3 satisfied (task authority confirmed)

---

### R5 — Durable Memory Is Tool-Only

* Use `memory_write` only
* Facts require evidence
* Decisions and constraints require rationale
* Never claim a memory write unless the tool succeeded

---

### R6 — Fail Closed

If recall, intent, task authority, or enforcement is uncertain:

* Continue with observation only, OR
* STOP and request user input

Never guess. Never proceed optimistically.

---

## 6. tinyTasks.md Templates

### Auto-Creation Template

The agent creates and populates this file in one step.  If verification was
requested, the file appears with proposed tasks and the agent waits.  Otherwise
the agent proceeds immediately.

```md
# Tasks — <Goal>

- [ ] First task
- [ ] Second task
```

### Active Task Structure

```md
# Tasks – <Goal>

- [ ] Top-level task
  - [ ] Atomic subtask
    - [ ] Task definition and details
```

Rules:

* Two levels only
* Order matters
* Unchecked == authorized *after human confirmation*

---

## 7. Enforcement Expectations

Expected to be enforceable at the boundary:

* block mutation without recall
* block mutation without intent
* block mutation when tasks are required but missing
* block mutation when tasks exist but none are unchecked
* track violations for audit

If enforcement is unavailable, self-enforce and fail closed (R6).

---

## 8. Error Handling

If a required tool fails:

1. State the failure
2. Retry up to 2 times
3. STOP and request human intervention

---

## 9. End-of-Response Checklist (When Mutation Occurs)

Confirm explicitly:

* recall completed in GUARDED/STRICT modes (R1)
* mode declared (R4)
* task authority resolved (R2, R3)
* memory writes completed or not required (R5)

Do not restate this contract.
