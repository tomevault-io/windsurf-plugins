# Tracked step types registry

The plugin tracks "interactive step component types" — the React components rendered inside an interactive section that count as completable steps the user must execute (as opposed to passive content like markdown, image, or video).

This list is duplicated in **four sites** that drift independently. Adding, renaming, or removing a step type requires editing all four. There is no single source of truth, deliberately: two layers operate on parse-time element strings, two operate on runtime React component identity.

## The four registry sites

| # | File | Constant | Keyed by | What breaks if you forget |
|---|------|----------|----------|---------------------------|
| 1 | `src/docs-retrieval/content-renderer.tsx` | `INTERACTIVE_STEP_TYPES` | Parsed-element string name | Standalone steps of the new type don't get `stepIndex` / `totalSteps` props and won't appear in the document-wide progress counter. |
| 2 | `src/docs-retrieval/content-renderer.tsx` | `SECTION_TRACKED_STEP_TYPES` | Parsed-element string name | `countStepsInSection` undercounts; pre-render step-count predictions are wrong and the section's progress chip drifts. |
| 3 | `src/components/interactive-tutorial/interactive-section.tsx` | `stepComponents` useMemo branch | React component identity | The new component is invisible to the section: never gets `stepId`, never blocks "Do Section", never tracks completion. |
| 4 | `src/components/interactive-tutorial/section-child-classifier.ts` | `INTERACTIVE_STEP_COMPONENT_TYPES` | React component identity | Issue #842 acknowledgement gate misclassifies the new type as *passive* — the section wrongly requires "Mark section as complete" even though the user already did the work. |

Sites 1 and 2 use parse-time string keys because they operate on `ParsedElement` trees produced by `json-parser.ts`. Sites 3 and 4 use React component identity (`type === FooStep`) because they operate on rendered `React.Children`. Same conceptual list, two layers.

## Checklist when adding a new tracked step type

Assume you're adding a `FooStep` component:

1. **Component file** — create `src/components/interactive-tutorial/foo-step.tsx`. Copy the closest existing sibling (`terminal-step.tsx` is a good template for a self-contained step; `interactive-multi-step.tsx` for one that orchestrates sub-actions).

2. **JSON schema** — add `JsonFooBlock` to `src/types/json-guide.types.ts` and its Zod counterpart to `src/types/json-guide.schema.ts`. See `.cursor/rules/schema-coupling.mdc` for the type/schema coupling contract.

3. **Parser** — add a `case 'foo':` in `src/docs-retrieval/json-parser.ts` that emits a `ParsedElement` with `type: 'foo-step'`.

4. **Renderer case** — in `src/docs-retrieval/content-renderer.tsx` `renderParsedElement`, add a `case 'foo-step':` that produces `<FooStep ... />`.

5. **Registry site 1** — add `'foo-step'` to `INTERACTIVE_STEP_TYPES` in `content-renderer.tsx`.

6. **Registry site 2** — add `'foo-step'` to `SECTION_TRACKED_STEP_TYPES` in `content-renderer.tsx`.

7. **Registry site 3** — add a `React.isValidElement(child) && (child as any).type === FooStep` branch to the `stepComponents` useMemo in `interactive-section.tsx`. Push a `StepInfo` record with the appropriate `targetAction` / `isMultiStep` / `isGuided` / `isQuiz` flags.

8. **Registry site 4** — add `FooStep` to the `INTERACTIVE_STEP_COMPONENT_TYPES` set in `section-child-classifier.ts`. Add a test case in `section-child-classifier.test.tsx`.

9. **Block editor** (optional) — if authors should be able to create this block via the WYSIWYG editor, add a form in `src/components/block-editor/forms/`.

10. **CLI validation** (optional) — if the block needs CLI authoring support, register it in `src/cli/`.

## What counts as "interactive" vs "passive"

A step type is **interactive** (and therefore belongs in this registry) when it is a tracked step component the user is expected to encounter inside an interactive section. Existing interactive types:

- `InteractiveStep` for **every** `targetAction`, including `'noop'`. Per issue #842 (the acknowledgement-gate design), no-op blocks "still count as interactive" — they don't trigger the Mark Section Complete gate.
- `InteractiveMultiStep`, `InteractiveGuided`, `InteractiveQuiz`
- `TerminalStep`, `TerminalConnectStep`, `CodeBlockStep`

A block type is **passive** (and therefore does NOT belong here) when the user only reads it: markdown HTML, image, video, html blocks, and arbitrary non-tracked renderable children. Passive content is handled implicitly by `classifySectionChild` — anything not in the registry is treated as passive for the issue-#842 acknowledgement gate.

## Why not consolidate

It's tempting to derive sites 1–2 from sites 3–4 (or vice-versa) via a shared constant. The two layers genuinely operate on different value spaces:

- Parse-time (sites 1–2) cannot import React components without dragging the entire component tree into the parser's dependency graph.
- Runtime (sites 3–4) cannot use string keys because parsed strings have already been resolved to component types by the time these sites run.
