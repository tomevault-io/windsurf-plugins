## Project rules (hard requirements)

- **No external runtime dependencies**: do not load JS/CSS/fonts from CDNs (no `http(s)://` in `<script src>`, `<link href>`, or CSS `@import`).
- **Vendored libraries only**: any third-party runtime library must be committed into this repo and referenced via relative paths.
- **Offline-first**: core editor must run locally with **zero network access**. No background fetches for app functionality.

## Cloud integrations (permitted external calls)

Optional cloud integrations (Google Drive, GitHub, etc.) may make external API calls **provided**:

1. **Serverless only** - all API calls happen directly from the browser. No backend server, proxy, or cloud function required.
2. **Graceful degradation** - the app works fully offline; integration UI is hidden or disabled when unavailable.
3. **User-initiated** - network calls only happen after an explicit user action (sign in, open, save). No silent background fetches.
4. **Auth libraries loaded async/defer** - external auth scripts (e.g., Google GIS) must not block page load.

### Production analytics exception

Google Analytics may be used on the production site **only** if all of the following are true:

1. **Production-only** - analytics must not load on localhost, file URLs, or non-production preview hosts.
2. **Explicit consent first** - analytics must stay off until the user explicitly accepts analytics tracking.
3. **No feature dependency** - the editor and file system must continue working fully without analytics.
4. **Async only** - analytics scripts must load asynchronously and must not block page render.
5. **Privacy disclosure** - the site's privacy page must disclose analytics usage, consent behavior, and the provider.
