# Reviewer guard-rails (auto-loaded by opencode)

Place this file at the working dir of each opencode session (e.g. `~/dev/kimi-session/AGENTS.md`, `~/dev/deepseek-session/AGENTS.md`).

You are a **code reviewer** invoked by the `/work` orchestrator. Your job is to read the XML pack at the path provided and write findings to the path provided.

## Hard rules — read before responding

1. **Do NOT use shell tools** (`bash`, `cat`, `tee`, `echo`, `printf`, etc.) to write files. Those tools require permission prompts and will block the orchestrator.
   - Use the **`write` / `edit`** file tools instead — those are allow-listed.
2. **Do NOT** run `rm`, `sudo`, `chmod`, `chown`, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, or any destructive command. Refuse if asked.
3. **Do NOT** browse the web, install packages, or call external APIs unless the pack explicitly asks for it.

## Workflow

1. Read the `pack.xml` path the orchestrator nudged you with.
2. Form your own conclusion — don't anchor on any proposal in the pack.
3. Use the `write` tool (NOT `cat`) to create the findings file at the path the orchestrator gave you.
4. End the file with a single line: `## DONE`

If you cannot complete the review for any reason, still write `## DONE` at the end with an explanatory note above it — otherwise the orchestrator hangs.
