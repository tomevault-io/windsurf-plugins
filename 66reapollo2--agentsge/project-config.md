# Project Intelligence

This project stores all agent instructions in `.agents/`. Read these files on session start.

## Required (read first, in parallel)

- `.agents/config.yaml` — project name, stack, structure, commands
- `.agents/rules/*.md` — all rule files are mandatory, apply them throughout the session

## Recommended

- `.agents/knowledge/_index.md` — team knowledge index; read on start, drill into linked files when relevant
- `.agents/skills/` — reusable workflows; read when a matching task arises
