# gbl-chainload — Claude instructions

These rules apply to **every** Claude session in this project. They override
default and auto-mode behavior. They are also enforced at the tool layer by
`.claude/hooks/block-non-hlos-flash.py` (PreToolUse Python hook) and declared
in `.claude/settings.json` `autoMode.hard_deny`.

## Safety: never flash non-HLOS images

**Do not autonomously run** any of:

- `fastboot flash <X>` where `<X>` is **not** one of
  `system`, `vendor`, `product`, `system_ext`, `odm`, `userdata`, `cache`,
  `metadata` (with optional `_a` / `_b` slot suffix).
- `fastboot oem unlock` / `fastboot oem lock`
- `fastboot flashing unlock` / `fastboot flashing lock`
- `fastboot flashing unlock_critical` / `fastboot flashing lock_critical`
- `fastboot --set-active <slot>`
- `fastboot erase <non-HLOS partition>`

These are device-bricking commands. To test gbl-chainload revisions, use
**only**:

```
fastboot stage dist/<artifact>.efi
fastboot oem boot-efi
```

That path is a one-shot RAM load that survives a power cycle without
touching any persistent partition. If a non-HLOS flash is genuinely needed,
surface the proposed command and let the user run it themselves in a real
shell (`! <command>` from the input box).

The PreToolUse hook will block these patterns regardless of mode, but the
rule is documented here so the model doesn't waste turns trying to work
around it.

## Workflow: branch then PR

Work happens on feature branches; landing on `main` is via PR.

- Ceremony scales with the change. Use the lightest workflow that fits:
  - **Direct commit to `main`** is fine for a single-commit trivial fix —
    a typo, a one-line shell fix, a comment-only doc tweak — where the
    diff is self-evidently safe. Push directly; no PR.
  - **Single-commit PR** for anything touching multiple files or changing
    behavior in a non-obvious way, even when small.
  - **Multi-commit feature branch + PR** for larger work — iterate freely
    on the branch, the PR grows new commits as feedback comes in.
- Never force-push `main`, even for a typo fix. Push a follow-up commit.
- **Version bumps (`VERSION` + `CHANGELOG.md`) always land as their own
  focused PR — explicit on main, no bundling with feature work.** Use
  `scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z` to scaffold the branch + PR.

This applies regardless of mode. Auto mode does not opt out.

## File locations

Tooling defaults are fine — when a skill, plugin, or external tool has an
opinion about where it writes files (e.g., the `superpowers:brainstorming`
skill writing specs to `docs/superpowers/specs/`), use that default
location. Don't relocate files purely to fit the `docs/project/` "single
source of truth" norm; that norm describes durable hand-curated project
planning and RE distillations, not tool-managed artifacts.
