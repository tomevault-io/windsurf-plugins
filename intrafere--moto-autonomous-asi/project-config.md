# Cross-Field Workflow Testing

## #1 Rule: The Testing System Must Remain a Removable Overlay

The testing system is its own system that sits on top of the current production
program. Production code, launch paths, builds, and runtime behavior must never depend
on the testing folders, test artifacts, test-only imports, or test-only state. A user
must be able to delete the entire testing system (including `tests/` and generated test
artifacts) and still have a fully functioning MOTO program with unchanged production
behavior. This separability requirement takes priority over every other testing rule.

MOTO uses a project-specific testing overlay that combines executable product-law
invariants, deterministic state recombination, bounded real-code adapters with faked
dependencies, isolated scenario/result artifacts, inverse target-risk analysis, and a
support graph.

- Treat `tests/workflow_harness/invariant_catalog.py` and
  `tests/workflow_testing_plans/02_invariant_catalog.md` as the stable product-law catalog.
  Add invariant IDs instead of renaming existing IDs.
- Keep the overlay removable and behavior-neutral. Never add production dependencies on
  the testing system, runtime shortcuts, hidden stops/caps, impossible state transitions,
  or production-only test behavior.
- Keep external providers, Lean/SMT, browser services, credentials, and mutable runtime
  roots faked, blocked, or isolated unless a test explicitly owns that integration.
- Record safely unobservable interactions as `blocked`; never report synthetic coverage
  as a real-code pass.
- Run focused tests while developing and `npm run test:workflows` after workflow-test or
  deterministic-artifact changes.
- Run `npm run test:deep` after every major build and after substantial orchestration,
  persistence, provider, proof, prompt/RAG, event-contract, runtime-root, or cross-mode
  change. It is additive: run `npm test` separately for normal backend/frontend coverage.
- Regenerate deterministic cross-field artifacts with
  `python -m tests.workflow_cross_field.artifacts` when their inputs change, then verify
  that the checked-in projection is clean.
