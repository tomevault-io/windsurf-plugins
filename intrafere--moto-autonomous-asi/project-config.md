## Workflow Runtime Updates

- Aggregator, Compiler, and Autonomous Research are mutually exclusive runtime modes. Only one workflow mode may be active at a time, and starting any mode while another is running must be blocked.
- This rule explicitly supersedes any older wording in `part-1-and-part-2-cointeraction-architecture.mdc` that describes Aggregator and Compiler as concurrently runnable.

- Compiler critique skip and autonomous critique skip both support pre-emptive use during active paper-writing. If critique is already active, the skip happens immediately. If critique has not started yet, the skip is queued and auto-applies when critique is reached.
- This rule explicitly supersedes any older wording in `part-2-compiler-tool-design-specification.mdc` that describes compiler critique skip as active-critique-only.
