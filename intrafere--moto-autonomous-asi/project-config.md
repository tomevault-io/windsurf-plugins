Description of entire rule: Main Architecture layout/design of the aggregator portion of the two-part aggregation-distillation LLM work flow.

# OVERVIEW

## Workflow for Aggregator Note
Submitters run in parallel; single validator reviews and updates the shared database sequentially. This ensures coherent Markov chain evolution and database alignment with user prompt.

## AI Node Clusters and Validator Structure
Configurable 1-10 submitters + exactly 1 validator (default 3 submitters). Each submitter has its own model, context window, and max output tokens. First submitter labeled "Main Submitter" in UI.

**Single Validator Constraint**: Only one validator allowed — multiple validators would cause divergent database evolution, breaking coherent Markov chain alignment.

Validator accepts a submission if adding it makes the training database more useful toward finding solutions. Validator-distributed accepted submissions database starts blank, grows as submissions are accepted. Distributor updates it to all submitters after each acceptance.

## Queue Submissions and Overflow Behavior

Validator processes up to 3 submissions at once (batch validation). Takes whatever is available (1, 2, or 3) without waiting.

**Queue Overflow Threshold**: ≥10 submissions in queue → submitters paused until queue drops below 10.

## Batch Validation

Validator processes 1, 2, or 3 submissions simultaneously using batch-specific prompts.

**Independent Assessment**: Each submission assessed INDEPENDENTLY against existing database — does THIS submission provide unique value?

**Intra-Batch Redundancy Prevention**: After independent assessment, if multiple submissions would be accepted, check for redundancy between them. Keep only strongest; reject others as "Redundant with co-submitted submission X". Goal: maximize UNIQUE value per batch.

- 1 submission: standard validation
- 2 submissions: independent + pairwise redundancy check
- 3 submissions: independent + all-pairs check (1-2, 1-3, 2-3)

## Databases

**USER SHARED DATABASE** — User uploaded files + original prompt. Primary source for submitters.

**Validator-Distributed Database** — Accepted submissions (built by validator only; submitters have read-only access). Starts blank; distributed to all submitters on each acceptance.

**Local Submitter Databases** — Per-submitter rejection log: last 5 rejections (validator summary ≤750 chars + submission preview ≤750 chars). File: `Summary_Of_Last_5_Validator_Rejections_For_Submitter_{N}.txt`. Reset if submitter gets >15 consecutive rejections.

**Submission context injection**: Direct inject if fits. If too large: RAG the submission as file, keep user prompt direct. If user prompt + RAG'd submission still too large: RAG all user-prompt files. If user prompt itself too large after all RAG: halt with error + diagnostic.

## Context Allocation

User prompt ALWAYS direct injected. Use as much context as possible in every prompt.

### CONTEXT DISTRIBUTION RULES

Direct injection first; RAG only when doesn't fit. ~85% RAG retrieval, ~15% other direct injections (JSON, user files). Halt with error if user prompt exceeds (context_window - minimum_RAG_allocation).

No context carryover between prompts (only system-intended DB/submission transfers).

**RAG Offload Priority — Submitter:** Shared Training DB → Local Submitter DB → Rejection Log → User Upload Files

**RAG Offload Priority — Validator:** Shared Training DB → User Upload Files (submission under review is always direct injected)

## Role Selection

User selects model per role. Multiple roles can share a model. Models load with user-set context sizes.

## Single-Model Mode
When ALL submitters AND validator use the same model → single-model mode:
- Submitters run SEQUENTIALLY (S1 → S2 → ... → Sn)
- Validator processes all queued submissions after each full submitter round
- Prevents queue overflow from parallel tasks flooding when LLM completes
- Boost does NOT affect single-model detection (routing only, not model config)

## Multi-Submitter Configuration

Per-submitter: provider (LM Studio / OpenRouter), model, OpenRouter host provider, LM Studio fallback, context window, max output tokens. UI: "Number of Submitters" selector (1-10), "Copy Main to All" button.

Embeddings for RAG: LM Studio first, falls back to OpenRouter (`openai/text-embedding-3-small`) if LM Studio unavailable.

## Database Management

Accepted submissions database: never truncated. Live preview shows exact non-truncated log. Validator reasoning/results NOT included in the database (accepted submissions only).

## Database Cleanup Review

Every 7th acceptance (`total_acceptances % 7 == 0`, minimum 7 before first review):

**Phase 1**: Validator reviews ALL accepted submissions, identifies AT MOST ONE for removal (redundant, contradicted, superseded, or provides no unique value).

**Phase 2** (only if removal proposed): Validator self-validates its removal proposal. Conservative default: if uncertain, reject removal. If validated: execute removal + full RAG rebuild (all shared-training sources are dropped and re-indexed from the post-removal file so deleted content is no longer retrievable).
