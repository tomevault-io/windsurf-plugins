We build this app described in @SPEC.MD. Read that file for general architectural tasks or to double check the exact database structure, tech stack or application architecture.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Client-side tool for generating consistently formatted PDF documents from structured line data. Each line has: order, lat, lng, and note. Lines are entered via a form or imported as JSON.

**Key PDF requirements:**
- Lines must be aligned and printed consistently across pages
- Each page must end with a complete line — no line may be split across a page break
- PDF library choice is TBD

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server with hot reload
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run preview` — preview production build locally

No test runner or linter is configured.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** — Composition API with `<script setup>`
- **Vite** — build tool and dev server
- **Pinia** — state management (setup store syntax)
- **Vue Router** — client-side routing
- **Quasar Framework** — UI components and styling
- **pdfmake** — client-side PDF generation (declarative API, `dontBreakRows` for page-break control)
- **Plain CSS / scoped styles** — for custom styling alongside Quasar

## Architecture

- `src/main.js` — app entry, registers plugins (Pinia, Vue Router, Quasar)
- `src/App.vue` — minimal shell, renders `<RouterView />`
- `src/router/index.js` — route definitions
- `src/stores/` — Pinia stores (shared state)
- `src/views/` — page-level components mapped to routes
- `src/components/` — reusable UI components (not tied to a specific route)
- `src/composables/` — shared composition functions (`use*.js`)
- `@` alias resolves to `src/`

## Conventions

- Use `<template>` first, then `<script setup>` in Vue SFCs
- Use arrow functions (`const fn = () => {}`) instead of function declarations
- Prefer Quasar components (QBtn, QInput, QTable, etc.) over raw HTML elements for UI
- Keep components small and single-purpose; extract reusable pieces into `src/components/`
- Extract shared reactive logic into composables in `src/composables/`
