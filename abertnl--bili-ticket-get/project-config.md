# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

This is a local Bilibili 会员购 (show.bilibili.com) ticket-grabbing tool. It is a FastAPI web application with a vanilla HTML/JS/CSS frontend. Users configure a show, ticket tier, buyers, and a start time; the backend then polls Bilibili's order APIs until an order is created or limits are hit.

## Common commands

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python dependency and environment management (Python 3.13+ required).

- Install dependencies: `uv sync`
- Run the application: `uv run main.py`
  - Prints the local URL and admin token on startup.
  - Default address: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- Run all tests: `uv run pytest`
- Run a single test: `uv run pytest tests/test_regressions.py::ClassName::method_name`
- Run tests verbosely: `uv run pytest -v`

There is no project-local lint command. The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` installs `flake8` and `pytest` with pip and runs `flake8 .` followed by `pytest`, but day-to-day development is through uv.

## Configuration

- Runtime configuration is stored in `config.json` at the repository root (gitignored).
- `config.example.json` documents the schema.
- The config path can be overridden with the environment variable `TICKET_BUY_CONFIG`.
- Admin token priority: `TICKET_BUY_ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable > `server.admin_token` in config > auto-generated temporary token printed at startup.

## Architecture

### Backend (`app/`)

- `app/server.py` — FastAPI app, route layer, and WebSocket log broadcaster.
  - Holds global mutable state in `server.state` (config, active `Grabber`, connected WebSocket clients).
  - Enforces admin-token authentication for `/api/*` and `/ws` via cookie, `X-Admin-Token` header, or `Authorization: Bearer`.
  - Validates origin for API/WebSocket requests; `server.config.allowed_origins` can whitelist additional origins.
  - Serves the frontend from `web/`.
- `app/grabber.py` — Core ticket-grabbing state machine (`Grabber`).
  - Lifecycle: prewarm wait → refresh `bili_ticket` → resolve buyers/price → wait for start time → attempt order loop (with optional return-ticket monitoring).
  - Each attempt calls `ticket.prepare_order` then `ticket.create_order`.
  - Result codes are classified by `app/bili/errors.py` into `SUCCESS`, `RETRY`, `RATE_LIMIT`, `SOLD_OUT`, `RISK`, or `FATAL`.
  - On `RISK`, delegates to `RiskHandler` and retries with the returned `gaia_vtoken`.
  - Emits events through a callback; `server.py` broadcasts these events over WebSocket.
- `app/config.py` — Pydantic v2 models (`AppConfig`, `NotifyConfig`, `ServerConfig`) and JSON persistence.
- `app/notify.py` — Sends payment reminders through Bark, Server酱, or macOS Messages.

### Bilibili integration (`app/bili/`)

- `app/bili/client.py` — `BiliClient`, a thin `httpx.AsyncClient` wrapper that parses the raw cookie string, sets mobile UA / Referer headers, and can generate `bili_ticket`.
- `app/bili/auth.py` — QR-code login flow and cookie validation via the nav endpoint.
- `app/bili/ticket.py` — Dataclasses and API calls for project info, buyer list, `prepare_order`, and `create_order`.
- `app/bili/risk.py` — `RiskHandler` for the `gaia-vgate` flow: register → solve Geetest → validate → obtain `grisk_id` / `gaia_vtoken`.
- `app/bili/captcha.py` — `CaptchaSolver` protocol with two implementations:
  - `ManualSolver`: exposes `gt`/`challenge` to the web UI and waits for the user to submit the result.
  - `RrocrSolver`: third-party service integration (requires `rrocr_token`).
- `app/bili/errors.py` — Error-code descriptions and classification.

### Frontend (`web/`)

Static HTML/JS/CSS files served by FastAPI. The frontend communicates with the backend via REST and WebSocket (`/ws`) for real-time logs.

### Entry point

- `main.py` loads config, ensures/validates the admin token, and starts uvicorn with `app.server:app`.

## Testing

Tests live in `tests/test_regressions.py` and use `unittest` (run by pytest). They heavily mock Bilibili API calls, `BiliClient`, and `asyncio.sleep` to test the grabber state machine and server routes without network access.

When modifying the grabber or server, prefer adding regression tests that patch `app.grabber.ticket.*`, `app.grabber.BiliClient`, and `app.grabber.notify.send_all` rather than relying on live Bilibili calls.

## Security notes

- `config.json` is written with `0o600` permissions and excluded from the hatch wheel build.
- `rrocr_token`, cookie, and notify URLs/keys are redacted from public config responses and from error logs in `notify.py`.
- The admin token is required for all `/api/*` routes and `/ws`; configure a strong token in production rather than relying on the generated temporary one.
