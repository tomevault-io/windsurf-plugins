# SniffSec Workflow
## Security Standards
- Never hardcode secrets (Stripe, AWS, etc.) or PII.
- Use `npx sniffsec` as the primary verification tool.

## Build Commands
- Run Scan: `npx sniffsec`
- Install: `npm install`

## Verification
Before completing any coding task, run the scan. If `issuesFound > 0`, the task is not complete. Fix the leaks and re-run.
