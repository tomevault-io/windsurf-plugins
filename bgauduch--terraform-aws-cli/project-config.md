Claude Code adapter (ADR-0009). The imports below load the binding docs into
every session's context before any edit — `AGENTS.md` and the docs it points to
stay the single homes (nothing is restated here). `.claude/` holds the Claude
Code settings (adapter layer). Keep instructions in `AGENTS.md`, not here.
