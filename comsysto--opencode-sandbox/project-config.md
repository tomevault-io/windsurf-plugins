# AGENTS.md

See [README.md](README.md) for project overview, key files, commands, and per-project state layout.

README.md is intended for end users (developers setting up or using the sandbox). It may explain how things work internally, but must not document development practices — those belong here in AGENTS.md.

Every change to the user experience (new commands, changed behaviour, new files created in target projects, etc.) must be reflected in README.md.

## Execution environment

This project uses itself as its own sandbox — the AI agent runs **inside the opencode-sandbox container** for this repository. This means:

- The workspace is mounted at `/<project-name>` inside the container (derived from the host project directory name)
- Outbound network access is restricted to the domains whitelisted in `opencode-sandbox-config.yaml`
- Host environment variables are forwarded as configured in the `env-passthrough` section — in particular `GH_TOKEN` for GitHub CLI access
- `docker` and `podman` are **not available** inside the container — `ocs-rebuild-container` and `ocs-start-container` cannot be run here; ask the user to run them on the host
- The `gh` CLI is available and authenticated via `GH_TOKEN` for reading and commenting on PRs and issues, but **not** for pushing code or creating branches — do not attempt `git push` or `git fetch`
- SSH is not available inside the container — `git push` and `git fetch` will fail; do not modify `git remote` URLs
- `shellcheck` is available for linting

## Lint (only CI-equivalent check)

```sh
shellcheck bin/* shared entrypoint.sh
```

No tests, no formatter, no typecheck, no CI workflows.

## Conventions

- All `bin/` scripts: `set -euo pipefail` + `source shared`
- After sourcing `shared`, re-assign `SCRIPT_DIR` if the script references other `bin/` scripts by path — `shared` overwrites `SCRIPT_DIR` with its own location
- `shared` provides: `find_sandbox_root` (walks up to `.opencode-sandbox/`), `use_sandbox_root`, `open_url`, `refresh_root_paths`
- `ocs-rebuild-container` must run from the **project root** (where `mise.toml` lives); all other `ocs-*` commands auto-detect root by walking up
- Container name is derived from project dir name: `opencode-<dirname>`
- Init templates (copied into target projects by `ocs-init`) live in `init-templates/`

## Design decisions

### `opencode-sandbox-config.yaml` — YAML subset parsed in bash

The config file uses a YAML subset deliberately chosen to be parseable without any external dependencies. No `yq`, `python`, or other tools are required on the host.

The supported subset is intentionally narrow:
- Top-level keys only (section headers): `key:`
- List items one level deep: `  - value`
- Map entries one level deep: `  key: value`
- Line comments (`#`) and blank lines

Anything outside this subset — anchors, multi-line strings, nested structures, typed values — is silently ignored by the parser in `ocs-rebuild-container`. Do not add configuration that relies on YAML features beyond the above. If richer configuration is ever needed, switch to a proper YAML parser (`yq`) rather than extending the bash parser.

### bash 3.2 compatibility (macOS)

macOS ships bash 3.2 as the system shell. All scripts must be compatible with it:
- Non-greedy regex quantifiers (`*?`, `+?`) are **not supported** — use character classes instead (e.g. `[^:]+` rather than `.*?[^:]`)
- Test regex changes on both Linux (bash 5) and macOS (bash 3.2) before committing
