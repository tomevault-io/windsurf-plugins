# The Blue Board — Project Instructions

## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.

## Testing
Run the test suite with `bun run test` (which runs `bunx vitest run`), NEVER bare `bun test`.
Bun's built-in test runner reports ~28 false failures and silently drops ~33 tests here because
the suite is written for vitest's API (vi.stubEnv, fake timers, vi.mock). The canonical, green
command is `bun run test`. `tsc --noEmit` (via `bun run typecheck`) and `bun run build` must also
pass before any PR. This note overrides the global "use `bun test`" default for this repo.
