# General best practices

- Run shell scripts through shellcheck.
- Use `tmp/` (project-local) for intermediate files and comparison
  artifacts, not `/tmp`. This keeps outputs discoverable and
  project-scoped, and avoids requesting permissions for `/tmp`.

### SESSION.md

While working, if you come across any bugs, missing features, or other
oddities about the implementation, structure, or workflow, **add a
concise description of them to SESSION.md** to defer solving such
incidental tasks until later. You do not need to fix them all straight
away unless they block your progress; writing them down is often
sufficient. **Do not write your accomplishments into this file.**

## Rust guidelines

- When adding dependencies to Rust projects, use `cargo add`.
- In code that uses `eyre` or `anyhow` `Result`s, consistently use
  `.context()` prior to every error-propagation with `?`. Context
  messages in `.context` should be simple present tense, such as to
  complete the sentence "while attempting to ...".
- Prefer `expect()` over `unwrap()`. The `expect` message should be very
  concise, and should explain why that expect call cannot fail.
- When designing `pub` or crate-wide Rust APIs, consult the checklist in
  <https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html>.
- For ad-hoc debugging, create a temporary Rust example in `examples/`
  and run it with `cargo run --example <name>`. Remove the example after
  use.

### Useful Rust frameworks for testing
- **`quickcheck`**: Property-based testing for when you have an
  obviously-correct comparison you can test against.
- **`insta`**: Snapshot testing for regression prevention. Use `cargo
  insta test` as a stand-in for `cargo test` to run the snapshot tests.

### Writing compile_fail Tests

Use `compile_fail` doctests to verify when certain code should _not_
compile, such as for type-state patterns or trait-based enforcement.
Each `compile_fail` test should target a specific error condition since
the doctest only has a binary output of whether it fails to compile, not
the many reasons _why_. Make sure you clearly explain exactly WHY the
code should fail to compile.

If there is no obvious item to add the doctest to, create a new private
item with `#[allow(dead_code)]` that you add the compile-fail tests to.
Document that that's its purpose.

Before committing, create a temporary example file for each compile-fail
test and check the output of `cargo run --example <name>` to ensure it
fails for the correct reason. Remove the temporary example after.

## Git workflow

Use the `commit-writer` skill, if available, to draft commit messages.
It reads the current diff and produces a message following the
conventions below.

Make sure you use git mv to move any files that are already checked into
git.

When writing commit messages, ensure that you explain any non-obvious
trade-offs we've made in the design or implementation.

Wrap any prose (but not code) in the commit message to match git commit
conventions, including the title. Also, follow semantic commit
conventions for the commit title.

When you refer to types or very short code snippets, place them in
backticks. When you have a full line of code or more than one line of
code, put them in indented code blocks.

## Documentation preferences

### Documentation examples

- Use realistic names for types and variables.

## Code style preferences

Document when you have intentionally omitted code that the reader might
otherwise expect to be present.

Add TODO comments for features or nuances that were deemed not important
to add, support, or implement right away.

### Literate Programming

Apply literate programming principles to make code self-documenting and maintainable across all languages:

#### Core Principles

1. **Explain the Why, Not Just the What**: Focus on business logic, design decisions, and reasoning rather than describing what the code obviously does.

2. **Top-Down Narrative Flow**: Structure code to read like a story with clear sections that build logically:
   ```rust
   // ==============================================================================
   // Plugin Configuration Extraction
   // ==============================================================================

   // First, we extract plugin metadata from Cargo.toml to determine
   // what files we need to build and where to put them.
   ```

3. **Inline Context**: Place explanatory comments immediately before relevant code blocks, explaining the purpose and any important considerations:
   ```python
   # Convert timestamps to UTC for consistent comparison across time zones.
   # This prevents edge cases where local time changes affect rebuild detection.
   utc_timestamp = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(file_stat.st_mtime)
   ```

4. **Avoid Over-Abstraction**: Prefer clear, well-documented inline code over excessive function decomposition when logic is sequential and context-dependent. Functions should serve genuine reusability, not just file organization.

5. **Self-Contained When Practical**: Reduce dependencies on external shared utilities when the logic is straightforward enough to inline with good documentation.

#### Implementation Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Future developers can quickly understand both implementation and design rationale
