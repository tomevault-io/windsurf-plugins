# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Manuscript is an open-source, native writing application for iOS and macOS, designed as an alternative to Scrivener and Ulysses. It prioritizes file ownership (Markdown-based), privacy (no required accounts), and optional AI integration.

**Current state**: Active development. The app is built as a multi-platform SwiftUI application with a single Xcode project supporting both iOS and macOS.

## Build & Development

### Requirements

- Xcode 16.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- iOS 26.0+ SDK / macOS 15.0+ (Sequoia) SDK

### Building with XcodeBuildMCP

This project uses XcodeBuildMCP for building. **Always set session defaults first** to ensure builds use the latest iOS simulator:

```
session-set-defaults:
  projectPath: /path/to/Manuscript/Manuscript.xcodeproj
  scheme: manuscript
  simulatorName: iPhone 17 Pro
  useLatestOS: true
```

**Important:**

- The scheme name is lowercase `manuscript` (not `Manuscript`)
- Always set `useLatestOS: true` to use iOS 26.2 (the latest runtime)
- Without `useLatestOS: true`, builds may default to older iOS versions (18.5)
- Recommended simulator: **iPhone 17 Pro** with iOS 26.2

**Common build commands:**

| Command           | Description                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build_macos`     | Build for macOS                                                     |
| `build_sim`       | Build for iOS Simulator (requires `simulatorId` or `simulatorName`) |
| `build_run_macos` | Build and run on macOS                                              |
| `build_run_sim`   | Build and run on iOS Simulator                                      |
| `test_macos`      | Run tests on macOS                                                  |
| `test_sim`        | Run tests on iOS Simulator                                          |
| `list_schemes`    | List available schemes                                              |
| `list_sims`       | List available simulators                                           |

**Useful simulator commands:**

| Command       | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `screenshot`  | Capture simulator screenshot              |
| `describe_ui` | Get view hierarchy with coordinates       |
| `tap`         | Tap at coordinates or by accessibility ID |
| `type_text`   | Type text in focused field                |

### Building manually

```bash
open Manuscript/Manuscript.xcodeproj
```

Select your target platform (iOS or macOS) from the Xcode scheme selector.
Build: ⌘+B | Run: ⌘+R

### Website (GitHub Pages)

The marketing site lives in `docs/` and uses Jekyll with custom HTML.

- Config: `docs/_config.yml`

## Architecture

### Project Structure

```
Manuscript/
├── Manuscript.xcodeproj     # Multi-platform Xcode project
├── Manuscript/              # Main app code
│   ├── Models/             # Data models
│   ├── ViewModels/         # View models (MVVM)
│   ├── Views/              # SwiftUI views
│   │   └── Platform/       # Platform-specific views (iOS/macOS)
│   └── Services/           # Business logic and services
├── ManuscriptTests/        # Unit tests
└── ManuscriptUITests/      # UI tests
```

### Design Principles

- **SwiftUI** for all UI components
- **MVVM pattern** where applicable
- **Multi-platform** single codebase with `#if os(macOS)` / `#if os(iOS)` conditional compilation
- Platform-specific UI in `Views/Platform/`; shared logic elsewhere
- Standard Markdown as the primary file format

### iOS 18+ Features Used

- **DocumentGroupLaunchScene** - Custom document launch experience on iOS with branded background, template picker, and decorative accessories
- **NewDocumentButton** - Template-based document creation with async continuation pattern

## App Store Changelog (ASC) Skill

Use the `/app-store-changelog` skill to generate App Store release notes. It collects git commits since the last tag, triages them for user impact, and drafts benefit-focused "What's New" bullets.

**Invoke:** `/app-store-changelog` (or ask to "use asc cli" / "generate release notes")

**What it does:**
1. Collects commits and touched files since the last git tag
2. Triages changes into New / Improved / Fixed categories
3. Drops internal-only work (CI, refactors, dependency bumps)
4. Drafts short, benefit-focused App Store release notes
5. Updates `meta/RELEASE_NOTES.md` and related metadata files

**Key files it reads/writes:**
- `meta/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Current release notes
- `meta/APP_STORE_REVIEW.md` — App Store description, keywords, metadata
- `meta/PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` — Launch readiness tracking

## Key Documentation

- `meta/FEATURE_PARITY.md` - Feature matrix comparing Manuscript vs Scrivener vs Ulysses
- `meta/ACTION_PLAN.md` - Development roadmap and sprint progress
- `meta/APP_STORE_REVIEW.md` - App Store submission requirements and metadata
- `meta/PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` - Launch readiness checklist
