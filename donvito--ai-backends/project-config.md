# Coding Standards

This document outlines coding standards and best practices for the AI Backends project.

## TypeScript Usage

- Use proper TypeScript types and avoid `any` when possible
- Create interfaces for complex data structures
- Use type guards when necessary for type narrowing
- Leverage TypeScript's utility types (Pick, Omit, Partial, etc.)

## API Design

- Follow RESTful principles for resource-based endpoints
- Use consistent naming conventions for endpoints
- Document APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger via Hono's built-in support
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Routes should be in the src/routes folder and named with dash-separated lowercase words

## Error Handling

- Use consistent error handling patterns
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Create custom error classes when appropriate
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

## Performance Considerations

- Avoid blocking operations when possible
- Use caching where appropriate
- Consider rate limiting for resource-intensive operations
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Implement exponential backoff for all external API calls to avoid hitting rate limits

## Security Best Practices

- Sanitize and validate all user input
- Store sensitive information in environment variables
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated

## AI Integration

- Handle AI model responses appropriately
- Set reasonable timeouts for AI model calls
- Implement fallbacks for when AI services are unavailable
- Consider streaming responses for long-running AI operations
- Validate AI output before returning to clients
- Implement exponential backoff for all external API calls to avoid hitting rate limits
- Use the reusable AI service layer when connecting from API routes
