# Folder Organization Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for organizing code in the AI Backends project.

## src/config/

- Store environment variables, app settings, and configuration values
- Export constants for API keys, server settings, etc.
- Configuration should be loaded from environment variables when possible

## src/controllers/

- Controllers should handle HTTP request/response cycle
- Extract request data and validate it
- Call appropriate services to process business logic
- Format and return responses
- Keep controllers thin, move business logic to services

## src/middlewares/

- Create reusable middleware functions
- Handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, error handling
- Keep middleware focused on a single responsibility

## src/models/

- Define data structures and types
- Create interfaces for database entities if applicable
- Define schemas for data validation

## src/routes/

- Define API routes and endpoints
- Connect routes to controllers
- Group related routes in separate files
- Use descriptive names that reflect the resource being accessed

## src/services/

- Implement core business logic
- Handle external API calls
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Services should be testable in isolation

## src/utils/

- Create reusable utility functions
- Keep functions pure when possible
- Group related utilities in separate files

## src/schemas/

- Define validation schemas using Zod
- Create reusable schema components
- Keep schemas aligned with OpenAPI documentation

## tests/

- Create comprehensive test coverage
- Unit tests should focus on individual functions
- Integration tests should test API endpoints
- Use fixtures for test data
