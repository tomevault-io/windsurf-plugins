# OpcodeOracle

An agentic system for reverse engineering legacy computer code, focusing on MOS6502 assembler for the Commodore 64.

## Goals

1. Provide accurate disassembly of MOS6502 binary code
2. Use flow analysis to distinguish code from data
3. Generate readable, reassemblable output
4. Support agentic/AI-assisted reverse engineering workflows
