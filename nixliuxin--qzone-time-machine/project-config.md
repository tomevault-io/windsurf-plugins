description: Require explicit user permission before any git write or rule/config change

# No Autonomous Git Writes or Rule Changes

## Forbidden without explicit user permission
- Any git command that changes state: `commit`, `add`/stage, `push`, `merge`,
  `rebase`, `reset`, `checkout`/`switch`, `restore`, `stash`, `tag`,
  `cherry-pick`, `revert`, `branch -D`, `clean`.
- Creating, editing, or deleting rule files (`.cursor/rules/**`, `AGENTS.md`)
  or project config — unless the user asks for it in the current turn.

## Allowed without asking
- Read-only git: `status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, `branch --list`.
- Normal source/file edits that are not git commits and not rule changes.

## Workflow
- When changes are ready, summarize what changed and ask before committing.
- A one-time "commit" instruction authorizes only that commit, not future ones.
- If unsure whether an action counts as a write, ask first.
