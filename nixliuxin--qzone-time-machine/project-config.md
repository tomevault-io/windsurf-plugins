# Versioning Policy

QZone-Time-Machine uses **SemVer** to communicate change impact to users.

| Bump | When | Examples |
|------|------|----------|
| **patch** x.x.+1 | Bug fixes, internal improvements users barely notice | Retry logic fix, edge-case parse fix, refactor |
| **minor** x.+1.0 | Changes users actively notice — new capabilities, UX improvements | New backup module, viewer feature, new output format |
| **major** +1.0.0 | Breaking changes to CLI flags, output format, or data layout | JSON schema change, removed command |

Rule of thumb: if the release notes wouldn't excite a typical user,
it's a **patch**.

## Version sources

The single source of truth is the root `package.json` `version` field.
Individual package versions (`packages/cli/package.json`,
`packages/viewer/package.json`) should stay in sync.
