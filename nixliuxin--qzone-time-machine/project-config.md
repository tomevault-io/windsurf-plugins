description: Do not leak author personal backup stats, paths, or identifiers in published repo content

# No Personal Information in Published Content

This is a **public open-source** project. Never embed the maintainer's (or any
user's) real backup statistics, local paths, or social-graph details in content
that ships with or is published from the repo.

## Forbidden in repo-published content

Includes release notes, README/examples, docs, commit messages, PR descriptions,
CLI help examples, code comments, and AI rule files:

- **Backup statistics from a real run** — e.g. exact friend counts (`N 好友`),
  number of packed users (`M`), archive sizes (`X GB`), success/failure counts
  from a personal batch
- **Local or cloud paths** — e.g. `L:/DATA`, `D:/archives`, Dropbox folder paths,
  machine-specific working copy dirs
- **Real QQ identifiers** — UINs, nicknames, remarks, friend names in examples
- **Session / auth artifacts** — cookies, tokens, qr paths tied to a real account

## Use generic placeholders instead

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `N 好友 · M 有本地备份` | `完整 QQ 好友列表 · 本地备份 / 访问权限筛选` |
| `L:/DATA/qzone-backup` | `./qzone-backup`, `<backup-root>`, `<archive-dir>` |
| `1234567890_example-user` | `<uin>_<remark>` or fictional `1234567890_demo` |
| `packed M/M, X GB` | `packed N users` / omit sizes |

## Allowed

- **Runtime UI** — launcher/viewer showing counts from the *current user's*
  loaded archive (data stays local; not authored into the repo)
- **Copyright / author name** in LICENSE and About page
- **Public GitHub URLs** for the project itself
- **Protocol constants** required by QZone APIs (e.g. `appid: 311`)

## Local-only scripts

Personal debug / batch drivers (`packages/cli/measure-data.mjs`,
`packages/cli/scripts/probe-enrich.cjs`, etc.) must **not** be committed.

## Before publishing releases or docs

Scan for digits+单位 patterns tied to personal batches, drive letters with
project-specific folder names, and real remark/nickname strings. Replace with
generic descriptions.
