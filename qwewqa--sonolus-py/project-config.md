# Sonolus.py

Compiles a restricted subset of Python into Sonolus engine node trees. Engine authors write archetypes and
callbacks against `sonolus.script`; this package traces that source, optimizes the resulting CFG, and emits the
engine data a Sonolus level ships. `test_projects/pydori` is a complete engine that doubles as the regression and
benchmark corpus.

Conventions below are derived from what the code already does. Where a rule and the code disagree, the code is
probably right and this file is stale: fix the file.

## Layers

| Path | Role | Published to the docs site |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sonolus/script/` | Public API and the compiled subset | yes, as the API reference |
| `sonolus/script/internal/` | Compiler frontend: AST visitor, value protocol, builtin implementations | no |
| `sonolus/backend/` | IR, ops, memory blocks, and `interpret.py`, the reference interpreter | no |
| `sonolus/backend/_opt/` | Optimizer core, in Cython, compiled as C++ | no |
| `sonolus/backend/optimize/` | Python shim over `_opt`: three entry points and the level sentinels | no |
| `sonolus/build/` | Project build, CLI, dev server | no |
| `doc_stubs/*.pyi` | Published signatures for `builtins`, `math`, `random`, `typing`, and `Num` | yes |

Whether a file is published decides how its docstrings must read, so the boundary matters more than it looks:
`script/internal/` and `backend/_opt/` have no docs pages at all, and their docstrings can be as internal as they
need to be. Nothing in CI checks a `doc_stubs` signature against the implementation it shadows, so those drift
silently.

## Prose

Keep prose ASCII-only in docstrings, comments, `docs/`, `.claude/skills/`, and the markdown at the repo root.
Write `...` for an ellipsis, `->` and `<->` for arrows, and `section 2` rather than a section sign. Non-ASCII
punctuation is awkward to type and to search for, which makes later edits harder. Genuinely non-ASCII content
stays: `Bezier`'s accent, the `pi` in `vec.py`'s angle ranges, the localized strings in `metadata.py`'s examples.

Reach for ` -- ` last, and never for an em dash. A dash introducing an explanation wants a colon; a dash wrapping
an aside wants parentheses or commas. Two sentences are often better than either.

`E501` is ignored, so nothing fails on a long line, and `ruff format` wraps code but never reflows a comment or a
docstring. Keep those within 120 columns by hand.

## Code style

Ruff enforces the mechanical layer (import order, Google docstring convention, a broad lint set). These are the
judgement calls it cannot make:

- Absolute `from sonolus....` imports everywhere, never relative. Break a cycle with a function-local import or an
  import block at the bottom of the module: `E402` and `PLC0415` are ignored for exactly this.
- PEP 695 generics only: `class Foo[T]`, `def f[T]`, `type Alias = ...`. No `TypeVar(...)` assignments, no
  `typing.Generic[...]`.
- An abstract method gets `@abstractmethod`, a docstring, and a `raise NotImplementedError` body, not `...`. The
  exception is a pure interface never called through the base, such as `ArrayLike`'s `__getitem__`.
- Suffix a parameter with `_` to avoid shadowing a builtin (`type_`, `id_`) rather than adding `# noqa: A002`.
  Where the unsuffixed spelling is part of a public or mirrored API the `noqa` is correct instead: `printing.py`'s
  `format`, the `globals`/`locals` of `introspection.py` and of `simulation_context.py`'s `hooked_import`, and the
  file-level suppression in `options.py`.

## Checks

After changing Python, run `ruff format` then `ruff check --fix`. Hand-fix whatever they leave, then rerun both
until they are clean.

The full gate:

```
pytest -n 32
ruff check
ruff format --check
zensical build --strict
```

`zensical build --strict` catches broken cross-references and, because `validation.anchors: warn` is set, broken
heading anchors too. Heading text is load-bearing: reference pages deep-link into `concepts/types.md`.

CI runs `uv run tox`, which is the suite against Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14. `ty` is configured in
`pyproject.toml` but nothing runs it, and there is no pre-commit config despite the dev dependency.

Editing a `.pyx`, `.pxd`, or `.h` needs no special rebuild flag: `[tool.uv] cache-keys` covers those inputs along
with `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, and `SONOLUS_OPT_DEBUG_BUILD`, so a plain `uv sync` recompiles the extension in
place in about ten seconds. `uv sync --reinstall-package sonolus-py` forces the rebuild if you suspect the loaded
extension no longer matches the source, and comparing the `.pyd` mtime against the source edit is the cheap way to
confirm a rebuild actually happened before trusting a result that depends on it.

To test a modified tree without rebuilding at all, work in a `git worktree` and reuse the extension you already
have: `uv sync --no-install-project --no-group docs` there, copy the `*.pyd` across from the main checkout, and
run from the worktree root so the source shadows the installed package. The copy is what makes this work.
`PYTHONPATH` cannot substitute for it: the main venv installs the project through a setuptools meta-path editable
finder, which resolves ahead of `PYTHONPATH` and would keep importing the main checkout.
