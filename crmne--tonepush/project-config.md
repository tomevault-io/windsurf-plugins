# Copilot instructions for TonePush

TonePush is a cross-platform editor and CLI for Line 6 HX-family devices and
the Sonulab StompStation PRO. Device writes can change a musician's live sound
or persistent pedal state. Prefer correctness, reversibility, and proven device
behavior over convenience or broad compatibility claims.

## Sources of truth

Read `README.md` for supported behavior and `PROTOCOL.md` before changing or
reviewing HX transport, session, opcode, preset, or hardware behavior. Preserve
its confidence markers: confirmed observations, inferences, and open questions
are not interchangeable. Read `docs/_guide/stompstation-pro.md` and
`docs/backup-and-restore.md` before changing StompStation writes, backup, or
restore. Read `PACKAGING.md` and the release workflow before changing versions,
artifacts, installers, or publishing.

Nothing is derived from vendor source code. Do not copy vendor or GPL client
code into this repository. HX model names, parameter data, and artwork remain
owned by Line 6 and must not be redistributed; TonePush extracts them from the
user's own HX Edit installation or installer.

## Architecture

- `hx-proto` and `voidx-proto` are pure codecs and data models. Keep transport,
  filesystem, UI, and device I/O out of them.
- `hx-usb` owns the observed Line 6 USB session, continuous input draining,
  request bookkeeping, notifications, teardown, and hardware operations.
- `voidx-client` is transport-independent StompStation session and device logic.
  It validates the live schema and guards persistent writes.
- `hx-catalog` reads user-supplied HX Edit resources and formats model and
  parameter data. Missing resources must degrade to model numbers and no art.
- `tonepush-cli` exposes scriptable operations. Keep device families and their
  slot conventions explicit; StompStation commands remain under `tonepush pro`.
- `tonepush-gui` owns the egui interface, background device worker, local
  library, cloud integration, and platform behavior. Device and network work
  must not block the render loop.
- `hx-ruby` is a separately packaged Ruby extension. Its copied Cargo manifest
  must build outside this workspace against published crate versions.

## Device safety invariants

For HX devices, never call USB reset. Handshake once per session, do not add a
blanket reconnect or handshake retry, continuously drain unsolicited input,
bound drains and waits, decode coalesced frames, perform the documented closing
HELLO exchange, and pace deferred operations on notification 20. A timeout must
be reported instead of amplified into new sessions. Preserve unknown fields and
byte-exact preset documents.

A wedged externally powered HX device may require pulling its 9V adapter; a USB
replug alone does not power-cycle it. HX Edit and any VM using USB passthrough
must be fully stopped because the vendor interface is exclusive. Do not call
that expected device/session state a TonePush defect without evidence.

For StompStation PRO, reads may follow self-described data, but writes remain
enabled only for the exact identity and firmware verified on hardware. Keep the
separate explicit write opt-in. Persistent GUI writes require a current,
verified rollback bundle matching the connected device. Preserve size, hash,
chunk acknowledgement, read-back, schema, identity, path, and atomic-write
validation. Never weaken a safety gate to support untested firmware.

Do not ask a reporter to run a destructive probe. Diagnostics should be
read-only unless a maintainer has explicitly designed a reversible hardware
test with verified backup and cleanup. Never claim that ignored hardware tests
ran in ordinary CI.

## Behavior and compatibility

- Preserve the distinction between an edit buffer, saving to device storage,
  the local Tone library, and immutable captured setlists.
- File imports, exports, backups, and restores must validate before mutation,
  preserve native bytes where promised, reject unsafe paths and malformed
  lengths, and use atomic writes for durable local state.
- Keep Windows, macOS, and Linux building. Keep x86-64 and arm64 release
  packaging accurate. Platform-specific USB, paths, installers, desktop files,
  and app bundles must stay behind the appropriate target handling.
- Maintain backward compatibility for local library/config formats and the
  public crates and CLI unless a change explicitly documents a migration.
- Keep all workspace, extension, gem, release tag, and dependency versions in
  sync. The release workflow publishes libraries in dependency order and must
  remain safe to rerun.

## Verification and review

Run the checks in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `cargo test --workspace`,
`cargo fmt --all --check`, and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
Remember that Windows excludes `hx-ruby`. Verify the Ruby gem manifest and
package independently when its files, shared crate versions, or release setup
change. Build the Jekyll documentation when its sources or navigation change.

Add focused tests near changed protocol, parsing, backup, session, CLI, or UI
state logic. Prefer captured replay and fixture tests for transport behavior.
Hardware tests are ignored by default because they require the exact device,
