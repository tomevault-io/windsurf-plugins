# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- This repo is an npm workspace with independent packages in `packages/*`.
- Each package follows a consistent layout:
  - `extensions/index.ts` for the pi extension entry point.
  - `__tests__/` for Vitest tests (e.g., `index.test.ts`, `helpers.test.ts`).
  - `README.md`, `package.json`, and `LICENSE` per package.
- Root-level configs live in `biome.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `vitest.config.ts`.
- `docs/solutions/` contains documented solutions to past problems (bugs, best practices, workflow patterns), organized by category with YAML frontmatter fields such as `module`, `tags`, and `problem_type`; relevant when implementing or debugging in documented areas.
- `CONCEPTS.md` defines shared domain vocabulary (entities, named processes, status concepts) with project-specific meaning; relevant when orienting to the codebase or discussing domain concepts.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run these from the repo root unless noted:
- `npm run lint` — Biome lint/format checks.
- `npm run lint:fix` — auto-fixable Biome issues.
- `npm run typecheck` — TypeScript type checking only.
- `npm run test` — Vitest test suite.
- `npm run test:coverage` — Vitest coverage run with repo-wide thresholds.
- `npm run check` — lint + typecheck.
- `npm run check:ci` — CI-friendly Biome + typecheck.
- `npm run ci:detect -- <base> <head>` — show which packages the CI workflow will check for a given diff.

Local package testing:
- `cd packages/<package-name>`
- `pi -e .` — run the package in pi without installing.
- `npx biome ci packages/<package-name>` — lint a single package.
- `npx tsc --noEmit --project packages/<package-name>/tsconfig.json` — typecheck a single package using the shared root TS config via the package wrapper tsconfig.
- `npx vitest run packages/<package-name>/__tests__` — run tests for a single package.

Workspace version bumps:
- Use npm workspace versioning from the repo root: `npm version [<newversion> | major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease | from-git]`
- Prefer targeting a single package with `--workspace` / `-w`, for example: `npm version --workspace packages/pi-specdocs minor`
- `-w, --workspace` runs the command in the context of the configured workspace(s).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript.
- Formatting: Biome with **2 spaces** for indentation and `lineWidth` 120.
- File naming: tests live in `__tests__` and use `*.test.ts`.
- Package naming: `packages/pi-<name>` with npm scope `@feniix/pi-<name>`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: Vitest (see `vitest.config.ts`).
- Tests are per-package under `packages/*/__tests__/`.
- Keep unit tests focused on extension behavior and helpers; prefer fast, isolated tests.
- CI uses a single GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that detects changed packages and runs package-scoped lint, typecheck, test, and coverage summary jobs.
- Package-scoped CI coverage is enforced per extension with the same thresholds for every package: lines 70, statements 70, functions 70, branches 60.
- Changes to shared files such as `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `biome.json`, or `.github/workflows/**` should be treated as affecting all packages.
- Each package must keep its `tsconfig.json` aligned by extending the shared root `tsconfig.json`; do not introduce divergent compiler options in individual package configs unless the repo-wide config is intentionally updated.
- Coverage thresholds are enforced in `vitest.config.ts` at: lines 70, statements 70, functions 70, branches 60.
- Follow **test-first development**: write or update the failing test first, then implement the minimal code needed to make it pass.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`.
- PRs should include:
  - A short summary and the affected package(s).
  - Tests run (e.g., `npm run test`, `npm run check`).
  - Linked issues or context for behavior changes.
  - Notes on any new configuration or environment variables.

## Available Tools

### Ref.tools — Documentation Search & Reading

This workspace includes the `pi-ref-tools` extension which provides two tools for looking up technical documentation. **Use these tools proactively** when working with any library, framework, or API — checking the docs avoids hallucinating parameters, options, or patterns.

#### `ref_search_documentation`

Search indexed technical documentation. Returns a list of relevant doc pages with URLs and summaries.

```
ref_search_documentation({ query: "Next.js App Router dynamic routes" })
ref_search_documentation({ query: "Rust tokio spawn async tasks" })
ref_search_documentation({ query: "PostgreSQL JSONB indexing" })
```

- `query` (string, required): A full sentence or question. **Always include the language, framework, or library name** for best results.
- Returns: A list of doc pages, each with an overview/description, URL, and module ID.

#### `ref_read_url`
