# CURSOR10X MEMORY SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT RULES
# These rules MUST be followed ALWAYS without exception.

## RULE 1: CONVERSATION INITIALIZATION
The FIRST action in the BEGINNING of EVERY response MUST be to initialize the conversation with this single tool call and display the banner from the response immediately after. It MUST be called EXACTLY ONCE per conversation and ONLY at the very beginning after receiving user input:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Call EXACTLY ONCE at the beginning of EVERY conversation
mcp_cursor10x_initConversation({content: "[user message]", importance: "[low/medium/high/critical]"})

// ❌ DON'T: Call multiple times within the same conversation
// ❌ DON'T: Call in the middle or end of a conversation
// ❌ DON'T: Skip calling this at the start
```

## RULE 2: ASSISTANT MESSAGE STORAGE
EVERY assistant response containing important information MUST be stored. This can be called MULTIPLE times as needed during a conversation to store significant assistant responses:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Call when storing important information
mcp_cursor10x_storeAssistantMessage({content: "[assistant response]", importance: "[low/medium/high/critical]"})

// ✅ DO: Store multiple distinct responses when appropriate
```

## RULE 3: ACTIVE FILE TRACKING
EVERY file being worked on or modified MUST be tracked - not files being read. This should be called whenever starting work on a file:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Track when editing or creating files
mcp_cursor10x_trackActiveFile({filename: "[file path]", action: "[edit/create]"})

// ❌ DON'T: Track files that are only being read
```

## RULE 4: MILESTONE RECORDING
ALL completed tasks or achievements MUST be recorded as milestones. Use this to mark significant accomplishments:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Record milestones when completing important tasks
mcp_cursor10x_storeMilestone({title: "[milestone title]", description: "[milestone description]", importance: "[low/medium/high/critical]"})
```

## RULE 5: DECISION RECORDING
ALL important project decisions MUST be recorded. Use this when making significant decisions:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Record important decisions with reasoning
mcp_cursor10x_storeDecision({title: "[decision title]", content: "[decision content]", reasoning: "[decision reasoning]", importance: "[low/medium/high/critical]"})
```

## RULE 6: REQUIREMENT RECORDING
ALL project requirements MUST be documented. Use this when identifying or defining requirements:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Document project requirements
mcp_cursor10x_storeRequirement({title: "[requirement title]", content: "[requirement content]", importance: "[low/medium/high/critical]"})
```

## RULE 7: EPISODE RECORDING
ALL significant events or actions MUST be recorded as episodes. Use this to track important interactions:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Record significant events
mcp_cursor10x_recordEpisode({actor: "[user/assistant/system]", action: "[action type]", content: "[action details]", importance: "[low/medium/high/critical]"})
```

## RULE 8: CONVERSATION END SEQUENCE
This EXACT sequence MUST be executed at the VERY END of EVERY conversation and EXACTLY ONCE per conversation:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Call EXACTLY ONCE at the very end of the conversation
mcp_cursor10x_endConversation({content: "[Content of the assistant's final message]", milestone_title: "[Title for the completion milestone]", milestone_description: "[Description of what was accomplished]", importance: "[low/medium/high/critical]", metadata: "[Additional metadata for the operations]" })

// ❌ DON'T: Call in the middle of a conversation
// ❌ DON'T: Call multiple times
// ❌ DON'T: Skip calling this at the end
```

## RULE 9: HEALTH MONITORING
Memory system health MUST be checked when issues occur:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Check health when troubleshooting problems
mcp_cursor10x_checkHealth({})
```

## RULE 10: MEMORY STATISTICS
Memory statistics MUST be gathered periodically:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Get memory stats when useful for context
mcp_cursor10x_getMemoryStats({})
```

## RULE 11: CONTEXT RETRIEVAL
Use context retrieval tools as needed throughout the conversation:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Get comprehensive context when needed
mcp_cursor10x_getComprehensiveContext({})

// ✅ DO: Get recent messages when relevant
mcp_cursor10x_getRecentMessages({limit: 5, importance: "high"})

// ✅ DO: Get active files when working on code
mcp_cursor10x_getActiveFiles({limit: 5})
```

## RULE 12: IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION
ALWAYS check if similar or corresponding files/folders already exist BEFORE starting any new implementation:
1. Use search tools to scan the codebase for similar implementations
2. Check existing directory structure to identify appropriate locations
3. Review project documentation for mentions of similar functionality
4. Record findings before proceeding with implementation

## RULE 13: TASK WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT
ALWAYS follow the task workflow process when implementing tasks:

1. **Task Structure Validation**
   - Ensure tasks contain required fields: id, title, file, status, prompt
