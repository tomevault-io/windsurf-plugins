# AGENTS.md

This repository contains skill definitions for building Dapr Workflow applications. The skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/home) and can be used with any compatible AI coding assistant.

## Repository structure

- `skills/` — Skill files organized by language/framework
  - `shared/` — Shared content referenced by multiple skills (prereq checks, common .NET sections, running instructions)
  - `check-prereq-dotnet/SKILL.md` — Skill for checking .NET prerequisites
  - `check-prereq-aspire/SKILL.md` — Skill for checking .NET Aspire prerequisites
  - `check-prereq-python/SKILL.md` — Skill for checking Python prerequisites
  - `create-workflow-dotnet/SKILL.md` — Skill for creating Dapr Workflow apps with .NET
  - `create-workflow-dotnet/REFERENCE.md` — Detailed reference examples for the .NET skill
  - `create-workflow-python/SKILL.md` — Skill for creating Dapr Workflow apps with Python
  - `create-workflow-python/REFERENCE.md` — Detailed reference examples for the Python skill
  - `create-workflow-aspire/SKILL.md` — Skill for creating Dapr Workflow apps with Aspire
  - `create-workflow-aspire/REFERENCE.md` — Detailed reference examples for the Aspire skill
  - `create-workflow-from-diagram/SKILL.md` — Skill for scaffolding a Dapr Workflow app from a diagram image (PNG/JPG/GIF/WebP) or a BPMN 2.0 XML file, in Go, Python, .NET, Java, or JavaScript
  - `create-workflow-from-diagram/REFERENCE.md` — Detailed reference for the diagram skill (IR, input paths, per-language notes)
  - `review-workflow-determinism/SKILL.md` — Skill for reviewing existing workflow code for non-determinism hazards
  - `review-workflow-determinism/REFERENCE.md` — Detailed reference and worked example for the determinism review skill
  - `review-workflow-activity/SKILL.md` — Skill for reviewing existing activity code for idempotency, error handling, and convention issues
  - `review-workflow-activity/REFERENCE.md` — Detailed reference and worked example for the activity review skill
  - `review-workflow-management/SKILL.md` — Skill for reviewing the HTTP management endpoints exposed for Dapr Workflows
  - `review-workflow-management/REFERENCE.md` — Detailed reference and worked example for the management endpoint review skill

## Usage

**Verify your environment (user-invoked only):**

The `check-prereq-xxx` skills (`check-prereq-dotnet`, `check-prereq-aspire`, `check-prereq-python`) are opt-in and must **only** be run when the user explicitly asks for them (e.g., "check prerequisites for .NET", "verify Aspire environment"). Do **NOT** run them automatically as part of, or before, a `create-workflow-xxx` invocation — they are separate, user-invoked skills, not an implicit pre-step.

**Build a new workflow application:**

Run the appropriate `create-workflow-xxx` skill to scaffold the project: `create-workflow-dotnet`, `create-workflow-aspire`, or `create-workflow-python` from a text spec, or `create-workflow-from-diagram` from an image or BPMN file (output language: Go, Python, .NET, Java, or JavaScript). Each skill lists the prerequisites it expects to be installed and assumes they are already in place.

**Review an existing workflow application** (run any combination, in any order):

- `review-workflow-determinism` — flags non-deterministic constructs in workflow bodies that would break replay.
- `review-workflow-activity` — flags idempotency, error-handling, and convention issues inside activities.
- `review-workflow-management` — checks the HTTP management surface (start, status, terminate, pause, resume, raise-event, purge) against the canonical shape used by the `create-workflow-*` skills.

All review skills are read-only and emit a structured report with stable rule ids (`DWF-DET-NNN`, `DWF-ACT-NNN`, `DWF-MGT-NNN`).

## Repository prerequisites

All skills require:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
- [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/) (version 1.18+)

### .NET skills

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- C# language server support (for code diagnostics)

### .NET Aspire skills

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [Aspire CLI](https://aspire.dev/get-started/install-cli/)
- C# language server support (for code diagnostics)

### Python skills

- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Python language server support (for code diagnostics)

## Guidelines for skill files

- Skill files are Markdown documents in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Each skill directory should also include a `REFERENCE.md` with full code examples and detailed explanations
- Skill front-matter fields: `name`, `description`
- Each skill should include sections for: prerequisite checks, project setup, folder structure, verify, and a final message
- Use `<PlaceholderName>` syntax for values the user should replace (e.g., `<ProjectName>`, `<ProjectNamespace>`)
- Code examples should be complete and runnable, not snippets
