# Routing Guidelines

## All links must use the Link component from @/routing

### Rule
All navigation links in the application must use the `Link` component imported from `@/routing`. Never use Next.js's built-in `next/link` or regular HTML `<a>` tags for internal navigation.

### Examples

❌ **Incorrect:**
```tsx
// Using Next.js built-in Link
import Link from "next/link";

<Link href="/about">About</Link>

// Using HTML anchor tag
<a href="/about">About</a>
```

✅ **Correct:**
```tsx
// Using the custom Link from @/routing
import { Link } from "@/routing";

<Link href="/about">About</Link>
```

### External Links
For external links (links to other websites), you should still use the `Link` component from `@/routing`, but add the `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@/routing";

<Link 
  href="https://example.com" 
  target="_blank" 
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
  External Link
</Link>
```

### Benefits
- Ensures consistent routing behavior across the application
- Allows for centralized routing logic and modifications
- Provides proper i18n support for localized routes
- Maintains consistent styling and behavior for links
