# praxis — Agent Roles

## Active agents

### research_assistant (default)

The default agent for all tasks. Helps the PI with data analysis, code writing,
literature context, and pipeline development. Follows the data discipline and
confirmation rules in CLAUDE.md.

Capabilities:
- Write and test Python code in `src/praxis/`
- Explore public datasets (MIMIC-IV, eICU, PhysioNet)
- Build and validate cohort definitions
- Create analysis pipelines with polars/pandas
- Review and explain statistical methods

Constraints:
- Always confirm cohort definitions and dataset choices before acting
- Never access institutional data without explicit instruction
- Never log or display PHI

## Review skills

| Skill | Status | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/plan-pi-review` | **Active** | PI-level research strategy audit. Scores 7 dimensions, interactive. |
| `/plan-ds-review` | **Active** | Data pipeline, harmonization, stats & reproducibility audit. |
| `/plan-ai-review` | **Active** | Model selection, fairness, explainability, generalizability audit. |
| `/plan-clinical-review` | **Active** | Bedside validity, safety, actionability, workflow integration audit. |
| `/plan-deid-review` | **Active** | De-identification & disclosure-risk audit. Run before data crosses any boundary. |

## Review chain protocol

### Execution order

```
plan-pi-review → plan-ds-review → plan-ai-review → plan-clinical-review
"Right question?"  "Right data?"     "Right model?"   "Right at bedside?"

plan-deid-review — runs on the data-movement axis, not this chain
"Safe to move?"
```

`/plan-deid-review` is not a stage in the chain. It gates *movement* rather than
progress: run it whenever data crosses a boundary, and re-run it on every batch,
because the method that was complete for the last export is only a hypothesis
about the next one.

**Sequential within a thread**: PI must pass before DS runs. DS must pass before
AI runs. Clinical review runs last.

**Parallel across independent threads**: Threads with no data/outcome dependencies
can run their review chains concurrently.

### Handoff: structured summary as artifact

Each skill writes a structured summary block at the end. The next skill in the
chain should read prior summaries for context. Convention: if writing to files,
use `reviews/{thread-name}-{skill}.md` (e.g., `reviews/hidden-hypoxemia-pi.md`).

### Dependency map for current research threads

```
Thread 1 (phenotyping) ──→ Thread 2 (prediction)
     │                         │
     │  (phenotypes define      │  (prediction targets
     │   the endotypes)         │   come from phenotypes)
     │                         │
Thread 3 (LLM extraction) ──────────→ Thread 4 (multimodal)
     (independent, can              (needs data infrastructure
      run in parallel)               from 1-3, runs last)
```

### Skip rules

- Descriptive studies with standard statistics: may skip plan-ai-review
- Research-enabling tools (extraction, infrastructure): clinical review uses
  the "Monday morning" test instead of the 3 AM test
- If PI review says PAUSE: stop. Resolve the blocker before downstream reviews.
- `/plan-deid-review` has no skip rule. Public-data-only work still has an
  identifier surface — figures, filenames, and notebook outputs all leave.

## Future skills

| Skill | Purpose | When to build |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `/plan-program-review` | Multi-project coherence review — do the threads form a fundable program (R01, K-award)? Evaluate narrative arc, dependency sequencing, and portfolio balance. | When preparing a grant application or annual review |
| `/office-hours` | Research hypothesis brainstorm — pre-PI-review ideation for new threads | When exploring whether a question is worth pursuing |

## Long-term learning: MD-based project memory

Review skills produce structured artifacts. Over time, these accumulate into a
learning corpus that makes future reviews sharper. Three layers, built iteratively:

### Layer 1 — Review artifacts (MVP, build when first review runs)
`reviews/{thread}-{skill}.md` — point-in-time structured summaries.
Accumulate naturally as skills are invoked. Prior summaries are context for
the next skill in the chain.

### Layer 2 — Decision log (build when first non-obvious decision is made)
`decisions/` — capture the *why* behind pivots, scope changes, and method choices.
Written by the PI (or prompted by the assistant) when a non-obvious call is made.
Format: date, decision, rationale, alternatives considered, what would change the decision.

### Layer 3 — Lessons learned (build after first completed review cycle)
`lessons/` — project-specific knowledge that should influence future reviews.
Things discovered during data exploration, modeling, or validation that aren't
obvious from the code or literature. Feed back into review skills as
project-specific anti-patterns and probes.

<!-- TODO: plan-program-review should read all three layers to assess
     multi-project coherence and narrative arc for grants -->

<!-- TODO: Consider whether lessons/ should be auto-prompted after each
     review cycle: "Did this review surface anything surprising that
     future reviews should check for?" -->
