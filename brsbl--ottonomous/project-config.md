# Ottonomous - Claude Code Plugin for Product Development

## Project Overview

Ottonomous is a Claude Code plugin for structured product development. It operates in two modes:

1. **Independent Skills** - Use individual skills (/spec, /task, /review, etc.) for specific tasks
2. **Autonomous Workflow** - Use /otto to run the full development loop automatically

### Core Skills
- `/spec` - Create product specifications
- `/task` - Generate implementation tasks from specs
- `/next` - Pick up and implement the next pending task
- `/test` - Run and verify tests
- `/qa` - Generate manual and automated QA checklists from specs
- `/review` - Code review with prioritized findings
- `/summary` - Create project summary
- `/browser` - Launch Playwright for browser interactions
- `/reset` - Clear workflow artifacts

## Core Philosophy

### Subagents for Context Isolation

Use subagents to isolate concerns and prevent context pollution:

- **Context isolation**: Each subagent gets only what it needs, nothing more. Orchestrator agent delegates to and manages subagent
- **Specialization**: Different expertise per agent (frontend-developer vs backend-architect, senior-code-reviewer vs architect-reviewer, test-writer, etc)

### Skill/Subagent Separation

Skills and subagents have distinct responsibilities:

- **Skills** define *what* to hand off (file list, diff command, scope, context) and are instructions for the Orchestrator agent
- **Subagents** define *how* to process what's handed off (criteria, detection rules, output format)

This keeps subagents self-contained and reusable while skills orchestrate the workflow.

### Swarm Orchestration

Skills coordinate multiple subagents working in parallel using `run_in_background: true`:

**Coordination patterns:**
- **Fan-out/Fan-in** — Spawn N agents, wait for all, synthesize results. Used by `/review`.
- **Batches** — Complete batch N before starting N+1 (for dependent work). Used by `/review fix`.
- **Pipeline** — Sequential handoff between specialists. Used by `/otto`.

**Scaling:** 1-4 items = 1 agent, 5-10 = 2-3 agents, 11+ = 3-5 agents. Group by directory or component type.

### Iterative Review for Verification

Every phase has explicit verification:

- **Planning**: spec → spec review → user approval
- **Implementation**: code → code review → fix → commit
- **Verification criteria**: Each step defines "Done when..."
- **Prioritized findings**: P0-P2 across all skills (P0 = critical, P1 = important, P2 = minor)

## Skill Structure Conventions

### SKILL.md Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name           # lowercase with hyphens
description: ...           # when to use, what it does
argument-hint: [arg]       # autocomplete hint
model: opus               # optional: opus, sonnet, haiku
---
```

### Skill Content Pattern

1. **Argument capture**: `**Argument:** $ARGUMENTS`
2. **Command table**: if skill has multiple modes (list vs create)
3. **Workflow sections**: numbered steps with clear conditions
4. **Verification**: how to check each step succeeded
5. **Next steps**: what skill to run next

### Variable Substitutions

- `$ARGUMENTS` - all arguments passed
- `$0`, `$1` - positional arguments
- `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` - current session ID

## Subagent Conventions

### Location

`skills/{skill-name}/agents/{agent-name}.md`

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: When to use this agent (include "PROACTIVELY" for auto-use)
model: opus
color: green              # optional: visual distinction
---
```

### Content Pattern

1. Role description paragraph
2. Core Responsibilities (numbered list)
3. Focus Areas (bullets)
4. Process/Approach (numbered steps)
5. Output Format specification

### When to Use Subagents

- **Context isolation**: Prevent one task's details from polluting another
- **Parallelization**: Multiple independent reviews/implementations
- **Specialization**: Different expertise (frontend vs backend, architect vs implementer)
