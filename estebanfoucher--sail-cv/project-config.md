# Git Workflow Rules

## Critical Restrictions

**NEVER commit or push code changes.** The user maintains full control over git operations.

- Do NOT run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, or any other git write operations
- Do NOT use git flags like `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, `--force`, etc.
- Do NOT run destructive git commands (reset --hard, push --force, branch -D, etc.)
- Read-only git operations are allowed: `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git show`, `git branch -l`

## User Control

The user will review all changes and decide when to commit and push. Your role is to:
- Make code changes via edit tools
- Explain what was changed and why
- Let the user handle git operations

## Exception

Only perform git operations if the user explicitly instructs you to do so with a direct command like "commit these changes" or "push to remote".
