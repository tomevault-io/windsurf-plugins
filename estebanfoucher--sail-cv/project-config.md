# 3D Reconstruction Module

## Overview
Stereo-view 3D dense reconstruction using calibrated cameras and MASt3R AI model.

## Key Components
- calibration/ (renamed from mv_utils): intrinsics/extrinsics calibration, scene management
- stereo/: MASt3R integration, triangulation, point cloud processing
- cameras/: camera parameter handling
- video.py: VideoReader, StereoVideoReader, FFmpegVideoWriter (enhanced with EXIF)
- unitaries/: SAM segmentation utilities

## External Dependency: MASt3R
- Located at mast3r/ (project root), NOT inside the package
- Must be on PYTHONPATH: mast3r, mast3r/dust3r
- Do not modify files inside mast3r/ - treat as external

## Web App
- Gradio-based interface at web_app/
- Imports from src/reconstruction/ via PYTHONPATH
- Has its own requirements.txt for web-specific deps

## Testing
- Tests in tests/reconstruction/
- Run with: make test-reconstruction
- Assets in assets/reconstruction/ and tests/reconstruction/cameras/test_assets/
