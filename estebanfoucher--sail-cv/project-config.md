# Sail-CV Project Overview

Sail-CV is an embedded computer vision framework for quantitative measurement of sail aerodynamic performance. It contains two independent modules sharing infrastructure.

## Repository Structure

- src/reconstruction/ - 3D stereo reconstruction (calibration, mast3r, triangulation)
- src/tracking/ - Tell-tale detection and tracking (RT-DETR, ByteTracker, PCA)
- mast3r/ - External MASt3R/Dust3R submodule (PYTHONPATH, not a package)
- web_app/ - Gradio web interface for reconstruction
- assets/reconstruction/ - Scenes, calibration images, checkerboard/charuco frames
- assets/tracking/ - Tracking videos, raw detections, layouts, configs
- checkpoints/ - Model weights (rt-detr.pt, yolo-s.pt, FastSAM-x.pt, MASt3R)
- parameters/ - YAML config files for tracking
- fixtures/ - Test fixtures (C1_fixture.mp4, C1_layout.json)
- tests/ - Unified test suite (tests/reconstruction/, tests/tracking/)
- docker/ - Separate Dockerfiles per service + docker-compose.yml
- scripts/ - Dev scripts (format, lint, test, check-all)

## Key Conventions

- Package manager: uv (not pip)
- Linter/Formatter: ruff (PEP 8, line-length 88)
- Type checker: mypy (Python 3.10+)
- Test runner: pytest
- Build system: hatchling
- Docker base: dustynv/l4t-pytorch:r36.4.0 (Jetson)
- PYTHONPATH: src, mast3r, mast3r/dust3r, src/reconstruction, src/tracking

## Module Independence

The two modules do NOT share code at the source level currently. Each has its own video.py, models, and utilities. Keep them independent unless a clear shared pattern emerges.

## Import Style

Both modules use flat imports within their namespace:
- Reconstruction: from stereo.triangulation import ..., from calibration import Scene
- Tracking: from models import Detection, from tracker_utils import ByteTracker

The pythonpath in pyproject.toml includes src, so src/reconstruction/ and src/tracking/ directories are importable roots when running within their respective context.

## Path Resolution

Project root from source files in src/reconstruction/ or src/tracking/:
- `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]` (NOT `.parent.parent` which only reaches src/)

Project root from test files in tests/reconstruction/ or tests/tracking/:
- `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`

Project root from deeper test files (tests/reconstruction/stereo/, tests/tracking/dataset/):
- `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[3]`

Asset paths must include the module namespace:
- Reconstruction: `project_root / "assets" / "reconstruction" / "scene_3" / ...`
- Tracking: `project_root / "assets" / "tracking" / "2Ce-CKKCtV4.mp4"`
- Checkpoints/fixtures/parameters are at project root: `project_root / "checkpoints" / "rt-detr.pt"`

Do NOT use sys.path.append/insert in tests — pyproject.toml pythonpath handles everything.
