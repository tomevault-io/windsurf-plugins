# Docker and Infrastructure

## Docker Setup
- docker/base.Dockerfile: shared base (l4t-pytorch, uv, ffmpeg)
- docker/reconstruction.Dockerfile: adds mast3r, croco extensions, gradio
- docker/tracking.Dockerfile: adds VPI (NVIDIA Vision Programming Interface)
- docker/docker-compose.yml: multi-service (reconstruction + tracking)

## Target Hardware
- NVIDIA Jetson (tested on Jetson Nano)
- Base image: dustynv/l4t-pytorch:r36.4.0
- NVIDIA runtime with GPU access

## Build Commands
- make docker-build: build all images
- make docker-build-reconstruction: build reconstruction only
- make docker-build-tracking: build tracking only
- make docker-up / make docker-down: start/stop services

## Important
- Non-root user (app_user, uid 1000) for security
- Volumes mount src/, assets/, checkpoints/ for development
- PYTHONPATH must include mast3r and mast3r/dust3r for reconstruction
