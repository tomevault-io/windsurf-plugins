# Repository Instructions

- DO NOT write trace logs.
- When fixing a problem, fix the direct root cause by default. Do not present a workaround,
  dependency swap, feature disablement, or environment dodge as the fix unless the user explicitly
  requests it.
- Before handling any request containing `package`, `打包`, `生成 DMG`, `release`, or `发布`, read
  `RELEASE.md` completely and follow the matching mode exactly.
- Treat `RELEASE.md` as the canonical packaging and release contract. Do not skip its checks, invent
  a model-specific alternative, or publish from a dirty or unsynchronized branch.
