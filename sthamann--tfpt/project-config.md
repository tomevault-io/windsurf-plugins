# Website sync — mirror theory & verification changes into `website/`

The public site in `website/` (Next.js, static, deployed on Vercel) is a
**mirror of the active root documents and the verification suite**. Whenever the
theory or the scripts change, the website must be updated in the **same change**.
Never invent numbers or claims — everything on the site is grounded in the
documents and the ledger (the ledger wins on any disagreement).

## What drives the site (data layer)

- `website/lib/papers.ts` — the **9 documents** (number 0 = `introduction`, 1–5 = the
  numbered papers `tfpt_1_architecture_e8` … `tfpt_5_redteam`, 6–8 = the companions
  `tfpt_horizon_readouts` ("Appendix H"), `origin_theory`, `tfpt_research_contracts` —
  companions carry a `label` and are never shown as "Paper N"): abstract, sections,
  `keyFormulas`, `highlights`, status.
- `website/lib/predictions.ts` — the prediction surface. **Markers on the website use the
  public four-class display system `[E]/[C]/[O]/[X]`** (same as the PDFs); the fine
  per-claim types (Identity, Lattice, Formal, Numerical, Physical, Axiom) live in the
  ledger and may be named in prose, but never as bare bracket badges.
- `website/lib/glossary.ts` — `GlossTerm` vocabulary.
- `website/lib/release.ts` — per-PDF version / bytes / SHA-256 (refreshed by
  `bash build.sh website`; new PDFs still need their entry added by hand once).
- `website/lib/version.ts` — **GENERATED** by `bash build.sh website` from
  `tex-artefacts/version.tex` + git revision + date; shown in the site header
  (`Navbar.tsx`). Never edit by hand.
- `website/public/papers/*.pdf` — copies of ALL active root PDFs incl.
  `tfpt_5_redteam.pdf` + `changelog.pdf` (copied by `bash build.sh website`).
- `website/public/verification/*.py` + `predictions_frozen.json` — copies of
  `verification/` (copied by `bash build.sh website`); the in-browser Pyodide
  reproducer (`lib/pyodide.ts`, `components/Reproducer.tsx`) fetches these.
- `website/components/VerificationDag.tsx` — dependency-graph nodes; each node lists the
  `scripts` that verify it + its status marker.
- `website/components/ScriptIndex.tsx` — **GENERATED** from
  `verification/script_registry.csv` + `script_clusters.csv` via
  `bash build.sh gen`. To add/change a script entry, edit the registry CSV and
  regenerate — never edit the TSX data by hand.
- `website/lib/changelog.ts` — **GENERATED** from the canonical `changelog.tex`
  (repo root) by `verification/make_changelog_web.py` via `bash build.sh gen`.
  Drives the public `/changelog` page (`app/changelog/page.tsx` +
  `components/Changelog.tsx`, server-rendered, math via KaTeX). Never edit by
  hand — to change the changelog, edit `changelog.tex` (newest first, plain
  LaTeX) and regenerate; `audit_sync.py` fails if the mirror is stale.
- Status markers also live in `components/StatusPyramid.tsx`, `components/orientation/StatusMatrix.tsx`,
  and the `/verification` marker legend — keep them agreeing with the ledger.

## When the verification suite changes (new / renamed / removed `vN_*.py`)

> Launch parallel subagents per skill **`tfpt-deep-sync`** (website + paper + stale
> wording) before editing; parent merges checklists.

1. Add the script's row to `verification/script_registry.csv`, then
   `bash build.sh gen` (regenerates `ScriptIndex.tsx` + the master TeX index).
2. `bash build.sh website` (re-copies all `vN_*.py` + PDFs, stamps version + hashes).
3. If it backs a DAG node, add its filename to that node's `scripts` in `VerificationDag.tsx`.

## When the changelog changes (always — every committed change adds an entry)

1. Add the dated entry to `changelog.tex` at the repo root (newest first, plain
   LaTeX only — no doc-specific macros), exactly as the `tfpt-workflow` rule
   requires.
2. `bash build.sh gen` — regenerates `website/lib/changelog.ts` (the `/changelog`
   page data) from `changelog.tex`. Never hand-edit `lib/changelog.ts`,
   `components/Changelog.tsx` data, or the page text to mirror an entry.
3. `bash build.sh website` re-copies `changelog.pdf` into `public/papers/`. The
   `/changelog` page links that PDF and is otherwise generated, so no further
   manual website edit is needed for a changelog entry.

## When a document changes (content or a recompiled `*.pdf`)

1. `bash build.sh website` — copies the root PDFs into `website/public/papers/`,
   refreshes bytes + SHA-256 + version/date in `lib/release.ts` and `lib/version.ts`.
2. Update that document's entry in `lib/papers.ts` (abstract / sections / `keyFormulas` /
   `highlights`); update `lib/predictions.ts` / `lib/glossary.ts` if a prediction or term changed.
   `verification/website_map.csv` lists which website files mention which documents/scripts
   (see the `sync-maps` rule).

## When a result or status marker changes

- A marker upgrade/downgrade must propagate to **every** website surface that shows it
  (`VerificationDag.tsx`, `StatusPyramid.tsx`, `orientation/StatusMatrix.tsx`) so markers
  never disagree with the ledger.
- The `introduction` is the reading guide → the `/orientation` components mirror its
  before/after, predictions and status card.

## Gate (before done — always)
