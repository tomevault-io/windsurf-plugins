# Cursor Rules for Quix Monorepo

## Project Structure

- This is a Nest.js monorepo with a main application and integration packages for various services
- Main Nest.js application is in the root `src/` directory
- Integrations are either built as a separate public npm package or integrated via an mcp server in mcp.service.ts
- Integration packages are located in `agent-packages/packages/`
- Each integration package follows a consistent structure with `src/`, `dist/`, and configuration files
- Common utilities and shared types are in the `agent-packages/packages/common` package

## Adding a new integration

To add a new integration

- Either use Oauth or API token and create a db migration similar to other integrations
- Use an id from the integration system as the primary key
- Create a sequelize model and associate the integration with slack workspace table via team_id
- Always prefix model attributes with `declare`
- Publish an app_home view to Slack for this integration via the app_home service and views
- Allow editing or reconnecting and disconnecting the integration
- Validate API tokens if accepting them in integrations-install.service.ts

## Slack events and interactions

- All slack events are handled in slack-events-handler.service.ts
- All slack interactions are handled in interactions.service.ts

## Code Organization Rules

1. Keep all service-specific code within its respective package directory
2. Common utilities and shared types should go in the `common` package
3. Maintain consistent file naming:
   - `src/index.ts` - Main package exports
   - `src/types.ts` or `src/types/index.ts` - Type definitions
   - `src/tools.ts` - Service-specific tools and utilities
4. Nest.js application follows standard module structure:
   - Modules should be organized in their own directories under `src/`
   - Each module should have its own controller, service, and module files

## TypeScript Guidelines

1. Always use strict type checking
2. Export interfaces and types from dedicated type files
3. Leverage the common package for shared types and utilities
4. Use proper type imports from @types packages when available
5. Follow Nest.js decorators and typing conventions for dependency injection
6. DO NOT use the any type
7. Import types from packages whenever possible before declaring your own types
8. Avoid type casting as much as possible
9. Prefer inferring types from Zod schemas using `z.infer` instead of defining them manually:

   ```ts
   import { z } from 'zod';

   const userSchema = z.object({
     id: z.string(),
     name: z.string(),
     age: z.number().optional()
   });
   type User = z.infer<typeof userSchema>;
   ```

10. For Zod schemas, use `.nullish().transform((val) => val ?? undefined)` instead of `.optional()` for better null handling. Do not combine `.nullish()` with `.default()`:

    ```ts
    // Preferred: Handles both null and undefined properly
    const schema = z.object({
      name: z
        .string()
        .nullish()
        .transform((val) => val ?? undefined),
      email: z
        .string()
        .email()
        .nullish()
        .transform((val) => val ?? undefined),
      age: z.number().default(0) // For fields with defaults - don't use .nullish() here
    });

    // Avoid: Only handles undefined, not null values
    const schema = z.object({
      name: z.string().optional(),
      email: z.string().email().optional(),
      age: z.number().nullish().default(0) // Don't combine .nullish() with .default()
    });
    ```

## Package Dependencies

1. Each integration package should have its own `package.json`
2. Keep dependencies up to date and consistent across packages
3. Use the common package as a shared dependency where appropriate
4. Use Yarn exclusively for package management:
   - No `package-lock.json` or `npm` commands
   - Use `yarn.lock` for dependency locking
   - Run `yarn install` for installing dependencies
   - Use `yarn link` for local development of packages

## Build and Development

1. Use the root `build.sh` script for building integration packages
2. Use `link.sh` for linking packages for local development
3. Use `nest build` for building the main application
4. Ensure all packages compile successfully before committing
5. Follow consistent tsconfig settings across packages
6. Use `yarn start:dev` for local development with hot reloading

## Integration Guidelines

1. Each service integration should be self-contained
2. Implement proper error handling and logging
3. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
4. Document API usage and requirements
5. Follow Nest.js best practices for module organization and dependency injection
6. Integration packages should be published with appropriate versioning
