# Claude Bridge — Master Agent Prompt

This file is the shared CLAUDE.md for any Claude Code session that uses the
Claude Bridge MCP server. Place it in the project root or reference it from
your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

---

## What is Claude Bridge

Claude Bridge is a lightweight MCP relay server running on one machine (the
**host**) at `localhost:8765` locally, or `<host-address>:8765` from any
other machine on the same Tailscale network or LAN.

It gives every Claude Code instance a set of tools to send and receive messages
over named channels in real time. Channels are project-scoped and created on
first write.

This is the primary coordination layer for multi-machine work.

---

## Your Identity

At the start of every session, identify yourself before using the bridge:

- **On Windows:** your sender ID is `windows`
- **On macOS:** your sender ID is `mac`
- **On Linux:** your sender ID is `linux`
- **On another machine:** use a short, descriptive ID, e.g. `vps-01`, `watcher`

Always include your sender ID in every `bridge_send` call. Never guess — check
your machine if unsure.

## Available Bridge Tools

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `bridge_ping` | Always run this first to confirm the bridge is online |
| `bridge_send` | Send a message, result, task, or event to a channel |
| `bridge_receive` | Poll a channel for new messages since your last check |
| `bridge_channels` | Inspect what channels are active in this session |
| `bridge_status` | Get a full cross-channel overview — useful at session start |
| `bridge_clear` | Reset a channel when starting a fresh task phase |

### Live event stream (HTTP, not MCP)

`GET /events/channel/<name>` is a Server-Sent Events endpoint available to
browsers, scripts, and the TUI. The dashboard and TUI consume it automatically.
For external scripts, keep using `bridge_receive` polling — SSE only makes sense
for persistent connections.

If auth is enabled, the EventSource API cannot send custom headers. Pass the
token as `?token=<value>` instead of a Bearer header **on `/events/` paths
only**. Note: query-parameter tokens appear in server access logs — scrub
`/events/.*[?&]token=` in your reverse proxy log config if log retention is
a concern.

---

## Channel Convention

All channels follow the pattern: `<project>:<role>`

### Standard channels per project

| Channel | Direction | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `<project>:orchestrator` | Orchestrator → Worker | Tasks, instructions, phase triggers |
| `<project>:worker` | Worker → Orchestrator | Results, outputs, completion signals |
| `<project>:events` | Both | Shared event log, milestones, errors |
| `<project>:debug` | Both | Verbose output, diagnostics |

### Cross-project channels

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `general:sync` | Ad-hoc coordination not tied to a specific project |
| `general:status` | High-level status updates across all active projects |

Create new channels freely. There is no registration step — write to a channel
and it exists.

---

## Communication Protocol

### Polling

There is no push notification. Poll `bridge_receive` every **3–5 seconds**
when waiting for a response from another agent. Use `since_id` on every call
after the first to avoid reprocessing messages.

```
Step 1:  result = bridge_receive(channel="myproject:orchestrator")
         → note the id of the last message as <last_id>

Step 2:  result = bridge_receive(channel="myproject:orchestrator", since_id="<last_id>")
         → only returns messages newer than <last_id>
```

### Message format

Messages can be plain text or JSON. Use JSON for structured data:

```json
{
  "type": "task",
  "phase": 1,
  "action": "scan_artifacts",
  "params": { "target": "/Applications" }
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "result",
  "phase": 1,
  "status": "complete",
  "count": 14,
  "artifacts": ["com.apple.finder", "com.apple.security.plist"]
}
```

Always include a `type` field so the receiving agent can route the message
without parsing the full content.

### Acknowledgement

When you receive a task message, send an acknowledgement before starting work:

```
bridge_send(channel="myproject:worker", sender="mac", content='{"type":"ack","phase":1,"status":"starting"}')
```

This lets the orchestrator know the task was received and work has begun.

## Session Startup Checklist

Run this at the start of every bridged Claude Code session:

1. `bridge_ping` — confirm server is online
2. `bridge_status` — see what's already in the channels from previous turns
3. Identify your role (orchestrator or worker) for this session
4. Clear stale channels if starting a new phase: `bridge_clear`
5. Announce your presence: `bridge_send(channel="general:status", sender="<id>", content="<id> online — starting <project> session")`

If the host bridge runs with `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN` (or `--auth-token`)
set, your `claude mcp add` for this machine needs the matching
`--header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`; without it `bridge_ping` will
fail and every tool call returns an auth error.

---

## Role Definitions

These are conventions, not constraints — pick whichever machine plays each role
for your workflow.
