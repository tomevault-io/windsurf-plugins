# ai-brain-starter — Claude Instructions

## Public repo rules — NEVER HARDCODE PERSONAL CONTEXT

This is a **public repo** that strangers fork to build their own vaults. The whole point is that it must work for people who are NOT the maintainer and are NOT on her team.

**Before writing or editing ANY file in this repo, scan for and remove:**
- Personal names (the maintainer, her co-founders, her team, her advisors, her family)
- Company names she's affiliated with
- Personal vault paths (`Adelaida Notes`, `🚀 Onde Team`, emoji folders specific to her structure)
- Personal frameworks she invented (e.g. her floor framework, her panel of advisors)
- Specific cities, countries, or geographies that aren't universal
- Substack URLs and personal blog links other than what already exists in the README/SKILL.md welcome message
- Real meeting names, real decision content, real strategic context
- Anecdotes that name real people or real situations

**When you need to illustrate a pattern with an example, invent a fictional one.** Generic placeholders ("a Google Drive shared folder", "a team member", "a co-founder") are always preferred over real names. If a fictional example would be confusing without context, use a clearly-marked one (`# Example only — replace with your own`).

**Existing files that pre-date this rule may have personal references** (the README mentions "Adelaida Diaz-Roa" in the Background section as legitimate attribution; the LICENSE has her copyright; the CHANGELOG narrates the actual history of the repo's development). Don't touch those — they're load-bearing context. The rule applies to **new** content you add.

**The narrative CHANGELOG is the one place narrative context is OK** because it's a historical record of what shipped when. But even there, prefer "the maintainer" or "a team member" over names when possible.

If you catch yourself writing "this is what [name] does," stop. Rewrite it as a generic pattern. The repo is for strangers, not for the maintainer's team.

## Git in large Obsidian vaults (users' vaults, not this repo)

Many users of this skill will have their Obsidian vault under git for local snapshots (the Phase 5 setup suggests it). Obsidian vaults commonly grow to 10,000+ files between journal entries, attachments, book notes, and plugin caches (`.smart-env/`, `.obsidian/workspace*`, etc.). Walking that full tree with `git add -A` or unscoped `git status` takes minutes of CPU, locks `.git/index.lock`, and wastes a lot of assistant context polling for progress.

**Rules when operating in a user's vault:**
1. Never run `git add -A`, `git add .`, or unscoped `git status`. Always pass explicit file paths you intend to stage.
2. If a vault has no git remote (`git remote -v` empty), never attempt `git push`. Vaults are commonly local-only snapshot repos.
3. When `git` is slow, check `wc -l <(git ls-files)` — if >10k files, you are in a vault repo; switch to targeted paths immediately.
4. The session-close template (`templates/rules/session-close.md` or the user's equivalent) must include the "targeted-paths only" pattern for any git snapshot step. If a new setup phase is introducing git automation, ship the rule with it.

These rules ship to every user's vault CLAUDE.md via Phase 4 / `templates/generated/claude-md-template.md`. Keep them generic (no personal paths) per the public-repo rule at the top of this file.

## Repo structure rules

**Before creating any new file or folder, always check what already exists:**

1. Run `ls` on the root to see top-level structure
2. Check `SKILL.md` (thin orchestrator) and `phases/` (one file per phase group)
3. Check `templates/generated/` for embedded templates extracted from phases

**The pattern:** `SKILL.md` is a thin router that tells Claude which phase file to read next. Each phase file lives in `phases/` and is under 10k tokens (one Read call). Large embedded templates (CLAUDE.md template, insights skill, obsidian rules, team-weekly skill) live in `templates/generated/` and are referenced by pointer from the phase files. Adding a new phase means creating a file in `phases/` and adding a row to the routing table in `SKILL.md`.

## Setup phase files (phases/)
- `phase-00-install.md` — install efficiency tools (brew, python, node, graphify, MCPs)
- `phase-01-welcome.md` — language detection, mode detection, welcome interview
- `phase-02-03-plugins-folders.md` — Obsidian plugins + folder structure
- `phase-04-claude-md.md` — build user's CLAUDE.md
- `phase-05-context-layer.md` — context notes, hooks, aggregator scripts
- `phase-06-09-tools-templates.md` — tool routing, imports, templates, skill verification
- `phase-10a-journaling.md` — daily journaling setup (interview, floor framework, skill)
- `phase-10b-panel-roster.md` — advisory panel roster + voice routing
- `phase-11-external-tools.md` — email/calendar/Slack/CRM, meeting tool wiring
- `phase-12-17-imports-rules.md` — book notes, health, taxonomy, backup, obsidian rules
- `phase-18-insights.md` — weekly/monthly insights + cron
