# Project Context

This project is the FLIP, a system designed to manage and analyze federated learning (FL) tasks and models. It includes features for managing projects, models, logs, and user interactions.
The project is structured as a Monorepo with multiple components, including an API, frontend, and deployment scripts.

The main folders are:
- `flip-api`: Contains the backend API code for the Centralhub, which coordinates all the services and is the main point of contact with the database containing all user related data.
- `flip-ui`: Contains the frontend code, including user interfaces, components, and styles. It's the only JavaScript/TypeScript code in the project.
- `trust`: Contains the code for the trust service, which manages trust-related operations and APIs which manage the patient data.
- `trust/trust-api`: Contains the trust API code, which handles calls from the centralhub to the trust service.
- `trust/imaging-api`: Contains the imaging API code, which handles image-related operations and APIs. It is only called by the trust-api.
- `trust/data-access-api`: Contains the data access API code, which handles data access operations and APIs. It is only called by the trust-api.

All APIs are created using FastAPI, and the project uses the SQLModel library for database interactions. The project is designed to be modular, with each component handling specific functionalities related to federated learning and trust management.

All Python code in managed using `UV` as package manager, therefore all folders contain a `pyproject.toml`, `src/<project_name>` folder structure, along with a `tests` folder for unit tests. The project uses `pytest` for testing and `uv run` for running the application.

# Copilot Instructions

- Use Makefile to automate common tasks and commands. Every sub-repo has its own Makefile, so make sure to run the commands in the correct sub-repo.
- Documentation follows the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for Python. The documentation generator is [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
- Use the `src/<project_name>` folder structure for Python code, and place tests in the `tests` folder.
- Use the `uv` package manager for managing dependencies and running the application.
- Use the `pytest` framework for writing and running tests.
- Use SQLModel for database interactions, and follow the project's database schema and models.
- Use FastAPI for creating APIs, and follow the project's API structure and endpoints.
- Use .vscode for development, and follow the project's .vscode settings for linting and formatting.
- Use the `aws` CLI for AWS interactions, and follow the project's AWS configuration and profiles.
- Use the docker compose and open tofu for managing project deployment and infrastructure.
- Use github actions for CI/CD, and follow the project's GitHub Actions workflows.
- Add environment variables to the `.env.development` file for local development.
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for managing secrets, and follow the project's secrets management practices in production.
- Follow the project's coding conventions and best practices for writing clean and maintainable code. They are defined in the `README.md` file and in the `pyproject.toml` file.
