# CLAUDE.md — trust/omop-db

## What this directory is

Two halves of one pipeline (merged from the retired private `flip-omop-db` repo, FLIP#834):

1. **Image build source** for `ghcr.io/londonaicentre/omop-db`: `Dockerfile` on `postgres:17` bakes the
   `files/` init chain (create `omop` schema → OMOP CDM 5.4 DDL → primary keys → indices → read-only
   roles) plus the seed-time helpers (`load_core_vocab.sh`, `constraints.sql`, and `unzip` — the
   k8s vocab-load Job unpacks the bundle with the image's own copy so it installs nothing at
   run time, keeping S3 the only host it must reach). The image is
   **vocab-free** (FLIP#842) — nothing licensed in any layer — so it is published by CI
   (`docker_build_omop_db.yml`, gated on the "Trust - OMOP DB CI" test workflow like the other
   services). FK **constraints are deliberately absent from init** — they are applied only AFTER data
   load (loading after constraints fails).
2. **Consumer harness** for the dev trust stacks: `update_omop_data.sh` downloads ready-populated,
   **vocab-free** pgdata volumes (~11 MB each, versioned by `.data_version`) from the public HF dataset
   `aicentreflip/trust-data` into `volumes/Trust_<N>/db_data`, which
   `trust/deploy/compose_trust.<env>.yml` mounts.

`compose.yml` here is the **standalone build/populate stack** (one empty DB per trust + opt-in pgadmin
profile; config from gitignored `.env.build`), NOT the runtime trust stack.

## The vocabulary seeding model (FLIP#842/#843)

No published artifact (image, pgdata tarball, HF dataset) carries the licensed core vocabulary. Every
environment loads it ONCE into the running database via `files/load_core_vocab.sh` (client-side
`COPY FROM STDIN` over TCP — no mounts, no server-side files; idempotent via core-aware guards that
tolerate the DICOM vocab already present in the tarballs):

- **Dev**: `make load-omop-vocab [OMOP_DB_PORT=5436]` (after `update-omop-data` + stack up). Cohort
  queries joining `omop.concept` return nothing until this runs.
- **EC2**: the "load OMOP core vocabulary on Trust EC2" Ansible play (part of `seed-trust-data`;
  throwaway container on loopback port 15499; kit credentials passed by the AWS Makefile).
- **Kubernetes**: the chart's `omop-vocab-load` post-install/post-upgrade hook Job
  (`omopDb.vocabLoad` values; bundle from S3, loader + constraints from the image). Its first
  stage runs `load_core_vocab.sh --check` and skips the multi-GB fetch when the database is
  already loaded — the hook sits on the critical path of every `helm upgrade`, so the fetch
  must stay conditional. The loader still runs (constraints).

## Load-bearing facts

- **`.data_version` must not move**: its path is hardcoded in `deploy/providers/AWS/Makefile`, which
  passes the value on to Ansible (`-e omop_data_version=`); the Helm chart consumes it via the
  `OMOP_DATA_VERSION` env var in `generate_values.py`.
- **Vocabulary licensing**: the core vocab bundle — an OHDSI Athena export, 59 vocabularies incl.
  SNOMED CT, LOINC, Read, dm+d (roster + versions in README "The core vocabulary bundle") — is licensed
  material: `data/` is gitignored and must never be committed or published. Acquisition: org members via
  `make fetch-vocab-core` from `s3://$(VOCAB_S3_BUCKET)/vocab/` (default `flipdev-aicentre`, org AWS
  needed); external users self-serve an equivalent export from OHDSI Athena under their own licences.
  The DICOM vocab (byte-identical to DICOM2OMOP `files/OMOP CDM Staging/` @ upstream `1ef3354`, Apache
  2.0, pickle converted to CSV) is freely redistributable: it lives on the HF dataset and stays inside
  the published tarballs.
- **Read-only roles are a security boundary**: `files/create_readonly_users.sql` creates
  `omop_readonly_base` + `data_analyst_reader` (SELECT-only, explicit REVOKEs) — the database half of
  data-access-api's SQL-injection defence-in-depth (`data_access_api/services/cohort.py`). The analyst
  password is NOT in the image — it is set at first init from `DATA_ACCESS_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and lives
  in the pgdata volume; rotate via `ALTER ROLE` + kit update, or rebuild volumes with a new `.env.build`
  value (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Canonical dataset + N-trust split** (`src/omop_db_tools/dataset.py`): mock rows are ONE dataset on
  HF (`omop-csv/<version>/`), each row tagged `source_trust`. Partition modes: `legacy` (default —
  reproduces the original two-trust membership; REQUIRED for data consistent with the published mock
  Orthanc PACS volumes, whose studies match each trust's accession IDs) and `modulo`
  (`person_id % N`, any trust count, needs regenerated imaging data). All tables carry `person_id`, so
  person-level partitioning preserves referential integrity.
- The populate scripts run on the **host** against published ports (`OMOP_DB_HOST` defaults to
  localhost) and need postgresql-client (`psql`/`pg_isready`).

## Commands

```bash
make update-omop-data [TRUST=1|2]   # consumer path: sync vocab-free pgdata volumes from HF
make load-omop-vocab [OMOP_DB_PORT=5436]  # seed the licensed vocab + constraints into a running trust DB
cp .env.build.example .env.build    # once, before any build-pipeline target
