# AGENTS.md

DocWriter is an AI-assisted markdown writing editor (SvelteKit + Svelte 5 +
Tiptap, server-owned Yjs CRDT, embedded SQLite). See `README.md` for the
standard dev commands and `CLAUDE.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the system design.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

Services & ports (single Node process):

- `npm run dev` starts Vite on **:5173** and auto-boots the Hocuspocus Y.Doc
  WebSocket sync server on **:3001** in-process (from `src/hooks.server.ts`).
  The browser only paints after the WS `synced` event, so a blank editor that
  never fills in usually means the :3001 WS server didn't start.
- `npm run dev` runs against the current working directory as the workspace
  root, so the file tree shows the whole repo. To run against a clean target
  folder instead, use `npm run dev:workspace -- [--no-open] [--host 0.0.0.0] /path/to/folder`.
- No test framework is configured; `npm run check` (svelte-check) is the
  validation command. `npm run build` is the production build.

Node version (important gotcha):

- `.npmrc` sets `engine-strict=true` and a dependency requires Node
  **>=22.19.0**; the repo pins **22.22.2** via `.nvmrc`. The system
  `/exec-daemon/node` is older (22.14.0) and sits ahead of nvm on `PATH`, so a
  raw `node`/`npm install` can fail with `EBADENGINE`. The update script and a
  one-time `~/.bashrc` pin already force nvm's 22.22.2 for new shells; if a
  shell still shows `node v22.14.0`, run `nvm use` (reads `.nvmrc`) first.

AI agent (for end-to-end testing of the headline feature):

- The editor loads and edits without any key, but the agent loop
  (Send → propose edit → review card) needs a provider credential. Prompt
  the agent via the **Send** button (top-right of the center pane); proposed
 edits appear as tracked changes plus an **Accept/Reject/Retry** review card
 floating inline near the edit in the center editor (there is no separate
 review pane). Accept writes through to the tab's file on disk (e.g.
 `document.md`, or whichever tab is open).
- **Claude** (default provider) needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (a secret). Two
  non-obvious gotchas when present:
  - The `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` ships both a glibc and a musl native
    binary and its resolver prefers the **musl** one, which cannot run on this
    glibc VM (`ReferenceError: Claude Code native binary not found … -musl/claude`).
    The update script deletes
    `node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-linux-x64-musl` after install so
    the glibc binary is selected; if you reinstall deps by hand, remove it again.
  - **Claude Opus 4.8** currently errors with `thinking.type.enabled is not
    supported for this model` against the bundled SDK version. Use
    **Settings → Model → Claude Sonnet 4.6** (or Haiku 4.5) for agent runs.
- **OpenAI**: `OPENAI_API_KEY` works via **Settings → Provider → OpenAI**.
  NON-OBVIOUS: the OpenAI provider defaults to the **Codex Mini**
  (`codex-mini`) model, which is unavailable and errors with
  `Error 400 The requested model 'codex-mini' does not exist`. Switch to
  **Settings → Model → GPT-5.5** (or another listed GPT-5.x) before sending.
