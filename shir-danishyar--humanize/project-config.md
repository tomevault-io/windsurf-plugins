# Instructions for agent harnesses

This repository is an [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)-format skill. To use it:

1. Load `SKILL.md` at the repo root. Its frontmatter `description` tells you when the skill applies: any audience-facing prose task (emails, posts, articles, marketing copy, reports), or an explicit request to humanize or de-AI text.
2. Follow SKILL.md's workflow. It will direct you to read the files under `references/` on demand — `patterns.md` for the full pattern catalog, `vocabulary.md` for word substitutions, `voice.md` when the user provides writing samples or a `voice-profile.md` exists. Don't preload them; they're structured for progressive disclosure.
3. Optionally verify output mechanically: `python3 scripts/ai_pattern_lint.py <file>` reports AI-pattern density (exit 0 = clean). Python 3.9+, no dependencies.

Do not apply this skill to code, commit messages, configuration, or legal text. User instructions always override the skill's defaults.
