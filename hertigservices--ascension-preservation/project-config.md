# Canonical source and runtime ownership

Develop in this repository. The installed hub and intake directories are deployments,
not alternate source repositories. Preserve private runtime configuration and state.
Use the deployment manifests and Azeroth Control tools/deploy.py; do not copy an
entire runtime back into source. No client assets, live character state, credentials,
raw submissions or generated database backups belong in source control.
