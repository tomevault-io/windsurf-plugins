# File Name and Class Name Consistency

The **filename** of a Dart file should match the **main (primary) class** it defines, in snake_case.

## Rule

- Class `CallKitManager` → file `call_kit_manager.dart`
- Class `VoiceCacheManager` → file `voice_cache_manager.dart`
- Class `ICEServerManager` → file `ice_server_manager.dart`

If a file contains multiple classes, the filename should match the **primary** or **public** class (the one the file is “about”), not a helper or extension.

## Rationale

Mismatched names (e.g. `call_manager.dart` with class `CallKitManager`) make it easy to misread the file as defining “CallManager” and hurt discoverability. Aligning name and file avoids confusion.

## When adding or renaming

- **New file**: Name the file after the main class in snake_case.
- **Renaming**: When renaming a class or file for consistency, update all `import` and `export` references to the new path (e.g. `call_manager.dart` → `call_kit_manager.dart`).
