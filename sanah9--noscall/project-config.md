# Role & Project Conventions

## Role

Act as a **senior Flutter engineer**. All descriptions and documentation must be in **English**.

## Architecture

- **Stack**: Flutter + Rust. Call Rust bridge code via **async** APIs where possible.
- **Structure**: Modular design; place modules under the **packages** directory.

## Project (Nostr)

This is a **Nostr-based** project. When you need **NIP (Nostr Improvement Proposal) definitions**:

- Prefer the Nostr MCP server **user-flutter-nostr-dev** (tools/resources) when available.
- Otherwise refer to official NIP specs (e.g. github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) or project docs.
