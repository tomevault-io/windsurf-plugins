# Codex Desktop Sol 1M Working Agreements

## Authority

`PLANNING/CODEX-DESKTOP-SOL-1M-PSPR.md`, approved overlay addendum `PLANNING/CODEX-DESKTOP-SOL-1M-OVERLAY-ADDENDUM.md`, completed Windows release addendum `PLANNING/1M-CONTEXT-TICKER-DESKTOP-RELEASE-ADDENDUM.md`, approved macOS addendum `PLANNING/1M-CONTEXT-TICKER-MACOS-DMG-ADDENDUM.md`, and approved headless Linux/Paseo addendum `PLANNING/1M-CONTEXT-SOL-LINUX-PASEO-ADDENDUM.md` are the canonical active authority. The base PSPR records the native prompt-pill no-go; the overlay addendum records the accepted reference; the Windows roster remains completed history. Continue to execute the MAC roster in dependency order and record it in `docs/sessions/1M-CONTEXT-TICKER-MACOS-RELEASE-DEVLOG.md`; execute LNX-01 against its matching DEVLOG without displacing that roster.

`PLANNING/CODEX-CONTEXT-CONTINUUM-PSPR.md` and `docs/sessions/CODEX-CONTEXT-CONTINUUM-DEVLOG.md` are preserved historical records of the superseded product direction. They are not execution authority.

## Non-negotiable product scope

- The only permitted model is exact slug `gpt-5.6-sol`.
- Never add a Terra, Luna, GPT-5.4, or other-model fallback.
- Keep total context (1,050,000), maximum input (922,000), maximum output (128,000), effective Codex budget, used/remaining context, and the 900,000 automatic-compaction threshold distinct.
- A catalog override is not live native-window proof. Do not claim Sol-1M until G2 passes in the actual desktop UX.
- Automatic compaction must use Codex's normal supported path at 900,000 tokens. Do not ship the superseded strict checkpoint-and-block behavior.
- The accepted UX is one focusless native overlay per supported desktop platform, visually anchored over the existing prompt pill. Headless Linux has no visible overlay and supports only the narrow catalog/config/verification manager. A TUI, replacement client, dashboard, side panel, ordinary window, slash command, or MCP text response remains unacceptable.
- MCP is auxiliary and read-only. It does not own model selection, token accounting, compaction, or desktop rendering.

## Execution discipline

- Prefer one focused commit per CDS prompt; use a small follow-up ledger commit only when recording the first commit's immutable SHA requires it.
- Record prompt ID, files, exact verification commands, results, local commit, and remote SHA in the DEVLOG.
- Preserve user-owned files, dirty work, and configuration. Global Codex changes, desktop restart/control, credentials, paid probes, installed-binary changes, releases, and external posts require their named special gates.
- Preserve the M0 native-seam no-go as history. The only approved continuation is the narrow floating overlay defined by `CDS1M-A1`; do not expand it into another client or dashboard.
- The accepted Windows `.exe` remains unchanged. The approved macOS lane is the narrow Swift/AppKit implementation in `1MCT-M1`; imagery, signing, notarization, tags, releases, and public artifact publication remain parked. The Linux lane is headless and must never control the Paseo daemon or silently send model traffic. GitHub Actions changes require separate approval immediately before editing or use; LNX-01's `ubuntu-latest` job was explicitly requested and approved on 2026-07-23.

## Baseline Rust checks

Run `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --all-targets`, and `git diff --check` unless a prompt prescribes a stricter gate.
