# Session Workflow

Three-phase workflow: Start -> Execute -> Close.

## Phase 1: Session Start (`/session [type]`)

Session types:
- **housekeeping** — git cleanup, docs, CI health, dependency updates
- **feature** — implementation of issues/features
- **deep** — thorough work requiring extended focus

### Step 1: Read Session Config

Parse `## Session Config` from project's `CLAUDE.md`. Store as `$CONFIG`.

### Step 2: Session Continuity

If `persistence` is enabled, check `.cursor/STATE.md`:
- `status: active` — crashed session. Ask: "Found unfinished session. Resume or start fresh?"
- `status: paused` — intentional pause. Offer to resume or start fresh.
- `status: completed` — note summary for context, continue normally.
- Missing — first session, continue normally.

### Step 3: Git Analysis

Run in parallel:
```bash
# Branch state
git branch -a && git log --oneline -20

# Unpushed/uncommitted work
git status --short
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline

# Stale branches (no commits in 7+ days)
git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate --format='%(refname:short) %(committerdate:relative)' refs/heads/
```

### Step 4: VCS Deep Dive

Query open issues, recent closures, milestones, MRs/PRs, CI status:
```bash
# GitLab
glab issue list --per-page 50
glab issue list --closed --per-page 10
glab mr list --per-page 20

# GitHub
gh issue list --limit 50
gh pr list --limit 20
```

Group issues by priority (critical/high first) and session-type relevance.

### Step 5: Environment Check

```bash
# Quality baseline (non-blocking)
{typecheck-command} 2>&1 | tail -5
{test-command} 2>&1 | tail -5
```

Check SSOT file freshness. Flag files older than 5 days.

**Plugin freshness**: Check the session-orchestrator plugin's last commit date. If older than `plugin-freshness-days` (default: 30) days, flag a non-blocking warning in the overview.

### Step 5.5: Pattern Recognition

Look across gathered data for:
- **Blocking chains**: issues blocked by other issues
- **Quick wins**: low-effort issues closable alongside main work
- **Synergies**: issues sharing code paths that can be combined

### Step 5.6: Memory Recall

> Skip if `persistence` is `false`.

1. Look for session memory files at `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/session-*.md`
2. Read the 2–3 most recent files (newest first)
3. Extract: accomplishments, carryovers, patterns or warnings
4. Surface under **Previous Sessions** in the overview

### Step 5.7: Project Intelligence

> Skip if `persistence` is `false` or `learnings.jsonl` does not exist.

Read `.orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl` and surface active learnings (confidence > 0.3, not expired):
- Fragile files, effective sizing, recurring issues, scope guidance
- Config field: `learning-expiry-days` (default: 30) controls expiry window

**Effectiveness analysis** (requires 5+ sessions in `sessions.jsonl`):
- Completion rate trend, discovery probe value, carryover pattern
- If fewer than 5 sessions: "Effectiveness analysis: not enough data yet ([N]/5 sessions)."

### Step 7: Present Findings

Present a structured Session Overview with:
- Git state summary
- Issue recommendations (grouped by priority)
- Quality baseline results
- Previous sessions context (if available)
- Project intelligence insights (learnings + effectiveness if 5+ sessions)
- Recommended focus areas

On Cursor, present scope confirmation as a numbered Markdown list (no AskUserQuestion tool). Ask the user to confirm scope before proceeding.

---

## Phase 2: Session Execution (`/go`)

### Step 1: Create Wave Plan

Distribute tasks across waves (see `030-wave-execution.mdc` for full details on roles, scope manifests, and quality checks).

### Step 2: Execute Sequentially

On Cursor, execute all tasks one by one (no parallel agents). For each task:
1. State what you are doing and which wave/role it belongs to
2. Execute the task fully
3. Report status with checklist update
4. Run incremental quality checks after implementation waves
5. Move to next task

### Step 3: Update STATE.md

If persistence is enabled, update `.cursor/STATE.md` after each wave with wave status, files changed, and quality check results.

---

## Phase 3: Session End (`/close`)

### Step 1: Plan Verification

For each planned item:
- **Done**: Verify with `git diff`, confirm acceptance criteria met
- **Partially done**: Create carryover issue with `[Carryover]` prefix
- **Not started**: Document why, ensure issue stays open
- **Emergent work**: Document unplanned tasks that were completed

### Step 2: Full Quality Gate (BLOCKING)

```bash
# All must pass before committing
{typecheck-command}    # 0 errors required
{test-command}         # exit code 0 required
{lint-command}         # errors NOT OK, warnings OK

# Check for debug artifacts
grep -rn 'console\.log\|debugger\|TODO: remove' --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' src/
```

Do NOT commit if any check fails. Fix quick issues (<2 min) inline. For longer fixes, create a `priority:high` issue.

### Step 3: Commit and Push

Stage specific files, commit with Conventional Commit format, push to origin. Mirror to GitHub if configured.

### Step 4: Session Metrics
