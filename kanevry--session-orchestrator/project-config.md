# Session Orchestrator — Cursor IDE

You have Session Orchestrator capabilities. This plugin provides structured session management for development work.

## Platform Context

- Platform: Cursor IDE (SO_PLATFORM=cursor)
- State directory: `.cursor/` (STATE.md, wave-scope.json)
- Config: Session Config in `CLAUDE.md` under `## Session Config`
- Shared knowledge: `.orchestrator/metrics/` (sessions.jsonl, learnings.jsonl)

## Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| /session [type] | Start a session (housekeeping, feature, deep) |
| /go | Execute the agreed session plan |
| /close | End session with verification and commits |
| /discovery [scope] | Run quality analysis probes |
| /plan [mode] | Create project plan or PRD (new, feature, retro) |
| /evolve [mode] | Extract session learnings (analyze, review, list) |

## Cursor-Specific Adaptations

**No parallel agents**: Execute wave tasks sequentially. Complete one task fully before starting the next. The `agents-per-wave` config is ignored on Cursor.

**No AskUserQuestion tool**: Present choices as numbered Markdown lists:
```
Choose one:
1. Option A — description
2. Option B — description
Reply with the number of your choice.
```

**No TaskCreate/Update**: Use plain-text checklists to track progress:
```
- [x] Task 1 — done
- [ ] Task 2 — in progress
- [ ] Task 3 — pending
```

**No EnterPlanMode**: When planning, state "I will focus on analysis only. No files will be modified until you approve the plan."

**Web search**: Use `@web` in Cursor chat instead of WebSearch tool.

**Web fetch**: Use `curl` via Bash instead of WebFetch tool.

## Quality Gates

Standard quality commands (read from Session Config, defaults below):
- **Typecheck**: `tsgo --noEmit` (or `npx tsc --noEmit`)
- **Test**: `pnpm test --run`
- **Lint**: `pnpm lint`

If a command is set to `skip` in Session Config, skip that check entirely.

## Agent Dispatch

Agents are resolved in priority order: project agents (`.cursor/agents/`) > plugin agents (`agents/`) > general-purpose. Use the `agent-mapping` Session Config field to bind roles explicitly to specific agents.

See `.orchestrator/metrics/model-selection.md` for model choice guidance (haiku/sonnet/opus per task type).

## Shared Knowledge

- Read `.orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl` for cross-session intelligence. Only apply learnings with confidence >= 0.5.
- Write session metrics to `.orchestrator/metrics/sessions.jsonl` with `"platform": "cursor"`.
- Metrics directory: `.orchestrator/metrics/` (not `.claude/metrics/`).
