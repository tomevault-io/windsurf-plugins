# Evolve — Session Learning Extraction

Extract patterns from session history into reusable learnings. Three modes of operation.

## Prerequisites

- **Persistence gate**: `persistence: true` must be set in Session Config. If not, abort: "Learnings require persistence to be enabled in Session Config."
- Session history must exist at `.orchestrator/metrics/sessions.jsonl`
- Learnings are stored at `.orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl`
- Config field: `learning-expiry-days` (default: 30) — controls `expires_at` for new and updated learnings

## Cursor Adaptation

**No AskUserQuestion tool on Cursor.** Present all choices as numbered Markdown lists:
```
Which learnings should be saved?

1. [fragile-file] src/lib/auth.ts — Changed in 4 of last 5 sessions (confidence: 0.5 new)
2. [scope-guidance] optimal-scope-per-session-type — 3 issues/session works well (+0.15 update)
3. Skip all — do not save any learnings

Reply with the number(s) of your choice.
```

## Mode Selection

Determine mode from user input (default: `analyze`):

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `analyze` | Extract new learnings from session history |
| `review` | Edit/manage existing learnings interactively |
| `list` | Display active learnings (read-only) |

---

## Mode 1: Analyze

Extract learnings from `.orchestrator/metrics/sessions.jsonl`.

### Step 1: Load Session Data

1. Read all entries from `sessions.jsonl`, parse each line as JSON
2. Sort by `completed_at` descending (most recent first)
3. If no sessions found, abort: "No session data available."

### Step 2: Pattern Extraction

Apply these heuristics for each learning type:

#### fragile-file
- Same file appears in 3+ waves' `files_changed` within a session, or in 3+ different sessions
- Subject = relative file path

#### effective-sizing
- Compare `total_agents` and `total_waves` across session types
- Calculate average agents per wave per session type
- Subject = e.g. `deep-session-sizing` or `feature-session-sizing`

#### recurring-issue
- `agent_summary` shows `failed` or `partial` > 0 across multiple sessions
- Repeated failures in wave `quality` fields
- Subject = issue pattern identifier (e.g. `test-failures-in-wave-execution`)

#### scope-guidance
- Cross-reference `effectiveness.planned_issues` vs `effectiveness.completion_rate`
- Skip sessions lacking the `effectiveness` field
- If completion_rate consistently 1.0 with N issues: "N issues per session works well"
- If completion_rate < 0.7: "scope was too large"
- Subject = `optimal-scope-per-session-type`

#### deviation-pattern
- Read `.cursor/STATE.md` if it exists, check `## Deviations` section
- Cross-reference session duration vs planned waves
- Subject = pattern name (e.g. `scope-creep-in-feature-sessions`)

### Step 3: Deduplicate

For each extracted pattern, check if a learning with same `type` + `subject` exists in `learnings.jsonl`:
- **Exists:** propose confidence update (+0.15 if confirmed, -0.2 if contradicted)
- **New:** propose as new learning with confidence 0.5

### Step 4: Present to User

Present extracted patterns as a numbered Markdown list (see Cursor Adaptation above). Let the user select which to save. Include a "Skip all" option.

If user skips or selects nothing: "No learnings saved."

If zero patterns were extracted, report: "No patterns found in session history." and stop.

### Step 5: Write Confirmed Learnings

Use atomic rewrite strategy:
1. Read ALL existing lines from `learnings.jsonl` into memory
2. Apply confidence updates for confirmed existing learnings (+0.15, cap at 1.0)
3. Apply confidence decrements for contradicted learnings (-0.2)
4. Append new learnings with confidence 0.5
5. Prune entries where `expires_at` < current date OR `confidence` <= 0.0
6. Consolidate duplicates (same `type` + `subject`): keep highest confidence
7. Write entire result back with `>` (atomic rewrite, NOT append `>>`)

Report: "Saved N new learnings, updated M existing. Total active: K."

---

## Mode 2: Review

Interactive management of existing learnings.

### Step 1: Load and Display

Read `learnings.jsonl`. If empty or missing: "No learnings found. Run `/evolve analyze` first."

Display as a formatted table grouped by type:

```
## Active Learnings

| # | Type | Subject | Confidence | Expires | Insight |
|---|------|---------|------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | fragile-file | src/lib/auth.ts | 0.80 | 2026-07-05 | Changed in 4 of last 5 sessions |

Summary: N active learnings (M high confidence, K expiring soon)
```

### Step 2: Interactive Management

Present as a numbered Markdown list (see Cursor Adaptation above):
- **Boost confidence** — select learnings to boost (+0.15, cap 1.0)
- **Reduce confidence** — select learnings to reduce (-0.2)
- **Delete specific learnings** — remove selected entries
- **Extend expiry** — reset `expires_at` to current date + `learning-expiry-days`
- **Done** — exit without changes

### Step 3: Apply Changes

Same atomic rewrite strategy as analyze mode. Read all, modify selected, prune, consolidate, write all with `>`.

Report: "Updated N learnings. Total active: K."

---

## Mode 3: List

Read-only display of active learnings.

### Output Format

Display grouped by type:

```
## Active Learnings
