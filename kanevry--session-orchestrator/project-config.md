# Quality Gates

Four quality gate variants for different session phases. Commands are read from Session Config in `CLAUDE.md` (field defaults shown below).

## Config Fields

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `test-command` | `pnpm test --run` | Set to `skip` to disable |
| `typecheck-command` | `tsgo --noEmit` | Set to `skip` to disable |
| `lint-command` | `pnpm lint` | Set to `skip` to disable |

## Variant 1: Baseline

**When**: Session start (Phase 3)
**Purpose**: Quick health check — non-blocking.

```bash
{typecheck-command} 2>&1 | tail -5
{test-command} 2>&1 | tail -5
```

- Report results but do NOT block the session
- Store error counts as the session baseline for later comparison

## Variant 2: Incremental

**When**: After implementation waves (Impl-Core, Impl-Polish)
**Purpose**: Verify implementation did not break anything.

```bash
# Run tests on changed files only
{test-command} -- <changed-test-files>

# Full typecheck (always full — partial typecheck is unreliable)
{typecheck-command}
```

- Report failures but do NOT block wave progression
- If issues found, add fix tasks to the next wave automatically

## Variant 3: Full Gate

**When**: Session end (Phase 2) — before committing
**Purpose**: Final quality gate — BLOCKING.

```bash
# 1. Typecheck — must produce 0 errors
{typecheck-command}

# 2. Tests — must pass (exit code 0)
{test-command}

# 3. Lint — errors NOT OK, warnings OK
{lint-command}

# 4. Debug artifact scan
grep -rn 'console\.log\|debugger\|TODO: remove' \
  --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' --include='*.js' \
  src/ lib/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Rules**:
- Do NOT commit if any check fails
- Fix quick issues (<2 min) inline
- For longer fixes: create a `priority:high` issue and exclude affected files from commit

## Variant 4: Per-File

**When**: Session review (reviewer agent)
**Purpose**: Targeted check on specific changed files.

```bash
# Run tests for specific files
{test-command} -- <specific-file-paths>

# Full typecheck
{typecheck-command}
```

- Report per-file pass/fail status
- Used by reviewers to annotate findings

## Decision Table

| Phase | Variant | Blocking? | Scope |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Session start | Baseline | No | Quick health check |
| After impl wave | Incremental | No | Changed files + full typecheck |
| Before commit (/close) | Full Gate | **Yes** | All checks, all files |
| Review | Per-File | No | Specific files |

## Graceful Degradation

Handle missing tools without failing:

- `command not found` for typecheck → skip, note "No TypeScript configured"
- `command not found` for test → skip, note "No test runner configured"
- `command not found` for lint → skip, note "No linter configured"
- Non-TypeScript projects: set `typecheck-command: skip` in Session Config

Always continue with remaining checks — never abort because one tool is missing.

## Script Alternative

If the Session Orchestrator plugin is installed, prefer the script for structured JSON output:

```bash
# Baseline
bash "$SO_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/run-quality-gate.sh" --variant baseline

# Incremental
bash "$SO_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/run-quality-gate.sh" --variant incremental --files file1.ts,file2.ts

# Full Gate
bash "$SO_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/run-quality-gate.sh" --variant full-gate

# Per-File
bash "$SO_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/run-quality-gate.sh" --variant per-file --files specific-file.ts
```

Exit codes: 0=pass, 1=error, 2=gate-failed.
