Always prefer importing types from their source rather than recreating or duplicating type definitions.

## When to Import Types

- Import types from libraries, packages, and dependencies
- Import types from other files in the codebase
- Use `import type` for type-only imports to improve tree-shaking
- Re-export types when creating type utilities or wrappers

## Examples

❌ Bad - Recreating a type that exists elsewhere:

```typescript
// Don't recreate types from libraries
interface ApiResponse {
  data: unknown;
  status: number;
}

function handleResponse(response: ApiResponse) {
  // ...
}
```

✅ Good - Importing the type:

```typescript
import type { ApiResponse } from './api-types';

function handleResponse(response: ApiResponse) {
  // ...
}
```

❌ Bad - Duplicating types from dependencies:

```typescript
// Don't recreate types from node_modules
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};
```

✅ Good - Importing from the library:

```typescript
import type { User } from '@auth/core/types';
```

❌ Bad - Recreating types that exist in the codebase:

```typescript
// Don't recreate types that exist elsewhere
interface GitHubRepo {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  full_name: string;
}
```

✅ Good - Importing from the existing file:

```typescript
import type { GitHubRepo } from '@/tools/github-api';
```

## Type-Only Imports

Use `import type` for type-only imports to ensure they are removed at compile time:

```typescript
import type { User, Session } from '@/lib/auth';
import type { ComponentProps } from 'react';
```

## When It's Acceptable to Create Types

- Creating new types specific to the current file/component
- Extending existing types with `extends` or intersection types
- Creating utility types (e.g., `Pick`, `Omit`, `Partial`)
- Types that don't exist elsewhere and are needed for the current implementation

If a type already exists (in a library, package, or elsewhere in the codebase), import it instead of recreating it.
