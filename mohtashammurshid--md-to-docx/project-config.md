# Releases

This repo uses `semantic-release` on push to `main`. The agent MUST NOT do any of these manually:

- Bump `version` in `package.json` / `package-lock.json`
- Edit `CHANGELOG.md` (other than historical entries that already exist)
- Create git tags (`git tag v*`)
- Create GitHub Releases (`gh release create`)
- Run `npm publish`

All of the above happen automatically from `.github/workflows/release.yml` driven by `.releaserc.json`.

## Commit messages

Every commit merged to `main` MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

| Prefix | Effect |
|---|---|
| `fix:` | patch bump (x.y.**Z**) |
| `feat:` | minor bump (x.**Y**.0) |
| `feat!:` or body with `BREAKING CHANGE:` | major bump (**X**.0.0) |
| `chore:` `docs:` `style:` `refactor:` `perf:` `test:` `ci:` `build:` | no release |

Examples:

```
feat: add syntax highlighting option to code blocks
fix(code-highlight): honor alias spellings in languages whitelist
chore: bump dev dependencies
```

## Workflow facts

- `release.yml` runs on Node 22 (semantic-release 25 requires Node ≥22.14).
- `setup-node` in `release.yml` MUST NOT set `registry-url` — semantic-release manages npm auth itself via `NPM_TOKEN`. Setting `registry-url` causes a 401 on whoami.
- `ci.yml` runs the test matrix on Node 18 + 20 to match downstream users.
- Commits authored by the release bot end with `[skip ci]` and are filtered out by the `if:` guard in `release.yml`.

## When the user asks to "cut a release" or "bump version"

Do NOT run `npm version`, edit `package.json`, or tag. Instead:

1. Verify there are releasable commits since the last `v*` tag (`git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline`).
2. If none, tell the user no `fix:`/`feat:` commits exist yet and ask what change they want to ship.
3. If releasable commits already exist on `main`, the release has either already happened or will on next push — no action needed.

See `[RELEASING.md](../../RELEASING.md)` for the full process and one-time repo setup.
