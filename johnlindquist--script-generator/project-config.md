Never start a dev server. I'll do that manually.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

- This is a Next.js + React application using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and XState.
- We use server components by default (Next.js 13+), and only switch to client components when strictly necessary.

## CODE STYLE

- **TypeScript**
  - Always use strict typing (never `any`).
  - Prefer interfaces over types for objects, and avoid `enum`—use map-like objects or string unions instead.
  - Use descriptive variable/function names (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- **React**
  - Favor functional components with hooks over class components.
  - Keep components small, focused, and testable; reduce complex `useEffect` logic.
  - Use server components (RSC) unless you need client-side interactivity.
- **Naming Conventions**
  - Folders/files: `kebab-case` (e.g., `auth-wizard`).
  - Functions/variables: `camelCase`.
  - Components/classes: `PascalCase`.
  - Favor named exports to encourage clarity and organization.

## FOLDER ORGANIZATION

- Standard Next.js 13+ app folder structure:
  - `app/` for routes, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx` (server components by default).
  - Shared components in `components/`.
  - Hooks in `hooks/`.
  - Keep feature-specific code grouped logically.

## TECH STACK

- **Front-end**: Next.js 13+, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI.
- **State Machines**: XState v5 (prefer `createMachine` and typed actions/guards).
- **Performance**:
  - Use Next.js image optimization (`next/image`) and WebP formats.
  - Limit the use of `useEffect`/`useState`; rely on server components for data fetching.
  - Lazy-load noncritical components; consider dynamic imports.

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS

- **Error Handling**:
  - Use early returns/guard clauses in functions.
  - Model expected errors in return values; reserve try/catch for truly unexpected issues.
  - Use error boundaries (`error.tsx`) to gracefully handle runtime exceptions.
  - Use Zod for runtime validation of inputs.
- **XState**:
  - Prefer `setup` for typed actions, guards, services.
  - Use `spawn` or `spawnChild` for complex side effects.
  - Rely on `fromPromise` for async tasks.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

- All code submissions should include any new or changed files in full (not partial snippets).
- Ensure you include necessary imports and explanatory comments.
- No new external packages should be added without team approval.

## REFERENCE EXAMPLES

- Sample usage of server components, dynamic imports, and Next.js routes can be found in the `app/` directory.
- Example XState machine definitions are in `machines/`; follow the typed approach as shown in `machines/exampleMachine.ts`.

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

- Keep large architectural details in separate documents (e.g., `architecture.md`).
- Use `.cursorrules` to address recurring instructions (naming, file structure) and keep it updated.
- When adding or removing major features, remember to update relevant docs accordingly.

## DEBUGGING

- When encountering a bug, provide a clear summary, possible solutions, and reasons for each solution.
- Always ask for clarification if anything is ambiguous before making large refactors or changes.

## FINAL DOs AND DON’Ts

- **DO**

  - Use explicit return types for all functions.
  - Comply with folder structure and naming conventions.
  - Favor server components and typed data flow with TypeScript and XState.

- **DON’T**
  - Overwrite entire files unless necessary—provide minimal, targeted changes.
  - Use `use client` or heavy client-side logic without a good reason.
  - Exceed these `.cursorrules` or internal docs without team discussion.
