description: Safety rules to prevent editing compiled artifacts, secrets, and security guidance for the Content SDK

# Safety

## Artifacts and Secrets

- Never edit `dist/**`, `.next/`, `out/`, `build/` (compiled output), `node_modules/`
- Do not commit secrets. `.env` and `.env.local` are gitignored; use `.env.example` (or `.env.*.example` in templates) to document variables with placeholders only. Never put real API keys or production values in example files
- Template edits must build/run with `npm install && npm run build` in generated apps
- Reuse common processes (see `src/common/` in create-content-sdk-app); do not reorganize the template or src/common/ structure without asking

## Security (Input, API, and Rendering)

Input and boundaries:

- Sanitize user inputs before processing; validate data at application boundaries
- Use type guards for runtime type checking where needed
- Never log sensitive information (API keys, tokens, PII); use environment variables for configuration

API and Sitecore:

- Always use environment variables for API endpoints and keys; never hardcode API keys in source code
- Use HTTPS for all XM Cloud / Sitecore endpoints
- Never expose sensitive configuration (API keys, editing secret) in client-side code or in logs
- Validate content from Sitecore (or other external sources) before rendering when appropriate

Rendering:

- Escape content when rendering to prevent XSS; prefer Sitecore field components (`<Text>`, `<RichText>`, `<Image>`) which handle sanitization
- Consider Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for applications
