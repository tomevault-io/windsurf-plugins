# General Coding Principles

## Universal Standards

- DRY Principle
- SOLID Principles
- Write self-documenting code with clear intent
- Use meaningful names that express business concepts
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- Make dependencies and requirements obvious

## Architecture Patterns

Modular Design:

- Organize code into focused, cohesive modules
- Minimize coupling between modules
- Use clear interfaces between layers
- Follow established patterns consistently

Data Flow:

- Prefer unidirectional data flow
- Validate inputs at system boundaries
- Transform data at appropriate layers
- Handle errors close to their source

Testing:

- Write testable code with minimal dependencies
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Mock external services and side effects
- Test behavior, not implementation details

## Development Standards

Version Control:

- Write descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use branching strategies appropriate to team size
- Review code before merging

Documentation:

- Document public APIs and interfaces with tsdoc comments
- Include usage examples for complex functionality
- Keep documentation close to code
- Update documentation with code changes

Performance:

- Optimize for readability first, performance second
- Profile before optimizing
- Cache expensive operations appropriately
- Consider memory usage and cleanup

## Quality Assurance

Code Review:

- Review for logic, readability, and maintainability
- Check error handling and edge cases
- Verify tests cover new functionality
- Ensure documentation is updated

Continuous Integration:

- All tests must pass before merging
- Linting and formatting checks must pass
- Build process must complete successfully
- No breaking changes without proper migration
