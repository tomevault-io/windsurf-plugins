# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository adapts the official macOS Codex Desktop DMG into a runnable
Linux app, packages it as `.deb`, `.rpm`, pacman, and AppImage artifacts, and
ships a local Rust update manager that can rebuild future Linux packages from
newer upstream DMGs.

The build flow: `install.sh` downloads/extracts `Codex.dmg`, patches the
extracted app through core and enabled Linux feature descriptors, rebuilds
native modules, downloads Linux Electron, stages bundled resources, writes
`codex-app/start.sh`, and lets package builders produce native artifacts or
AppImage. Native packages also include `codex-update-manager` and an
update-builder bundle.

## Maintainer Rules

- This project supports only the latest upstream `CODEX.DMG`. When fixing
  upstream drift, remove old drift workarounds in the same change. Do not keep
  legacy DMG shapes, fallback patch paths, or version-specific compatibility
  branches around.
- Keep core behavior focused on the app launching and working for most Linux
  users. Experimental, workflow-specific, editor-specific, browser-specific,
  distro-specific, or minority-use integrations belong in `linux-features/` and
  must be disabled by default.
- If an optional feature needs a new core touchpoint, add the smallest generic
  extension point to core, then keep feature-specific logic inside that feature
  directory.
- Do not enable optional features in committed config. `linux-features/features.json`
  is local and gitignored; `features.example.json` stays empty.
- Each repository feature under `linux-features/<id>/` and each local feature
  under `linux-features/local/<id>/` must include a `README.md` next to
  `feature.json`.
- Do not manually patch generated output such as `codex-app/start.sh` for a
  durable fix. Change the source template, build helper, feature, or patch
  descriptor and regenerate.
- Treat updater, package builder, launcher, and feature framework changes as
  cross-format changes unless the code explicitly scopes them to one package
  format or desktop target.

## Source Routing

Use source files, not generated artifacts. Main routing:

- Launcher/webview: `launcher/start.sh.template`, `launcher/webview-server.py`.
- Packaged runtimes: `packaging/linux/codex-packaged-runtime.sh`,
  `packaging/appimage/codex-appimage-runtime.sh`.
- Build pipeline: `scripts/lib/*.sh`.
- Core patches: descriptors in `scripts/patches/core/**/patch.js`,
  implementations in `scripts/patches/impl/`, helpers in `scripts/patches/lib/`.
- Linux features: `linux-features/<id>/`.
- Package builders: `scripts/build-*.sh` and `scripts/lib/package-common.sh`.
- Updater: `updater/src/`.
- Computer Use: `computer-use-linux/`; compositor backends under
  `computer-use-linux/src/windowing/backends/`.
- Nix: `flake.nix`, `flake.lock`, and `nix/`.

## Patch And Feature Rules

- `scripts/patch-linux-window-ui.js` is the build-facing ASAR patcher CLI only.
  Do not import internals from it; use runner/helper APIs.
- Core patch descriptors are the source of truth for shipped Linux
  compatibility patches. Read `scripts/patches/core/README.md` before adding
  or moving descriptors.
- ASAR patches are fail-soft unless intentionally marked `required-upstream`.
  Each patch should be idempotent and report warnings when current upstream
  drift prevents a needle from matching.
- Patch reports are written for installs/rebuilds. Upstream-build CI fails only
  for required upstream patches that are missing or skipped.
- Do not recreate deleted compatibility barrels such as
  `scripts/patches/main-process.js`, `webview-assets.js`, or `shared.js`.
- Feature patching uses only `entrypoints.patchDescriptors`. Removed feature
  patch entrypoints such as `mainBundlePatch` and `entrypoints.patches` are not
  supported.
- Declarative feature `resources`, `runtimeHooks`, and `packageHooks` are
  preferred over ad hoc staging whenever possible.
- Feature resource targets must stay inside the app directory and cannot target
  the app root. Mode values must be quoted octal strings such as `"0644"` or
  `"0755"`.

## Important Runtime Behavior

- DMG extraction can warn when `7z` cannot materialize the `/Applications`
  symlink. This is acceptable if a `.app` bundle was extracted successfully.
- The managed Node.js runtime is installed under
  `codex-app/resources/node-runtime/`. If `CODEX_MANAGED_NODE_VERSION` or
  `CODEX_MANAGED_NODE_URL` is overridden, `CODEX_MANAGED_NODE_SHA256` must be
  set too.
- GUI launchers often do not inherit shell `PATH`. The generated launcher
  searches common Codex CLI and `nvm` locations and respects `CODEX_CLI_PATH`.
- CLI preflight is launcher-scoped and best-effort. It can prompt to install
