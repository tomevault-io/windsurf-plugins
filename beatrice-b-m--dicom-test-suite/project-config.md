# Repository Guidelines

## Project Overview

`dicom-test-suite` is a Rust project for generating a comprehensive local corpus of synthetic DICOM files for viewer compatibility testing.

---

## Current Plan Tracking

Current project direction **MUST** be tracked in `CURRENT_PLAN.md`.
This document is the durable hand-off reference between coding agents for the
active major goal.

**Rules:**

- Review `CURRENT_PLAN.md` before starting implementation work.
- Update `CURRENT_PLAN.md` whenever a task changes the active goal, phase
  status, blockers, open decisions, research targets, or recommended next step.
- Commit plan updates in the same granular commit as the implementation,
  research, or documentation change that caused the status change.
- Do not treat `SYSTEM_SPEC.md` as a progress tracker; it is the architecture
  and requirements source of truth.

---

## Git Commit Policy

Every completed task **MUST** be tracked in a descriptive, granular git commit. This requirement is **absolutely critical** and must be followed under all circumstances - no exceptions.

**Rules:**

- Commit after every distinct logical unit of work, not at the end of a session.
- Each commit covers exactly one coherent change (one module, one component, one test suite, one docs section). Do not batch unrelated changes into a single commit.
- Commit messages must be informative: use `type(scope): subject` format, include a blank line, then a body describing *what* changed and *why*.
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`
- Scope: the module, file, or subsystem affected, such as `backend`, `frontend`, `pixels`, `server`, `types`, or `tests`
- Subject: imperative mood, 72 characters or fewer
- Body: explain the design decision, the invariant being established, or the behavior being changed, not a restatement of the diff
- Stage files selectively (`git add <file>`) rather than `git add -A`. Only commit files that belong to the current logical unit.
- Never amend or force-push commits that have been logged here.

**Verification:** After each task, run `git log --oneline -3` to confirm the commit was recorded before moving to the next task.
