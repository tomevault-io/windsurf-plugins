This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

EasyCLA is the Linux Foundation's Contributor License Agreement service. It lets contributors sign ICLAs/CCLAs and gates GitHub PRs and Gerrit/GitLab reviews on CLA authorization. Third-party integrations: DocuSign (e-sign), DocRaptor (PDF), GitHub, Gerrit, GitLab, Auth0 (SSO), and Salesforce via the LFX Platform APIs.

The frontend consoles (Project/Corporate/Contributor) live in **separate repositories** — this repo is backend-only plus supporting scripts/infra. Do not look for UI code here.

## Repository Layout

- `cla-backend-go/` — **primary backend**, Go. Powers `/v3` (EasyCLA v1, us-east-1) and `/v4` (EasyCLA v2, us-east-2, integrates with LFX Platform + Salesforce). Deployed as AWS Lambdas.
- `cla-backend/` — Serverless Framework **deployment stack** (us-east-1). The Python backend has been removed; the sole application code it still owns is the API Gateway authorizer (`cla-backend/auth/main.go`, `cla-backend/auth/authorizer/`). Otherwise it deploys Go binaries built elsewhere — the `/v3` API and worker lambdas (dynamo-events, metrics, zipbuilder, gitlab-repository-check, user-subscribe) from `cla-backend-go/`, and the `/v1`/`/v2` `legacy-api-lambda` from `cla-backend-legacy/`.
- `cla-backend-legacy/` — Go module (own `go.mod`): the Go implementation of the legacy `/v1`/`/v2` API surface (replaced the Python backend). Built as `bin/legacy-api-lambda` and deployed via `cla-backend/serverless.yml` on the original `api.*` domains. Responses carry `X-EasyCLA-Backend: cla-backend-legacy` headers; parity tooling lives under `internal/parity`.
- `cla-sss-base/` — standalone Go module (own `go.mod`): client for the Sanctions Screening Service (SSS).
- `scripts/`, `utils/` — operational shell/Python scripts (data audits, DynamoDB manipulation, deploys, credential rotation). Many `utils/*.sh` scripts operate directly against AWS environments.
- `infra/` — infrastructure config.
- `tests/` — functional/REST tests, Postman collections, py2go comparison tests.

## Go Backend (cla-backend-go) — Primary Workflow

Requires Go 1.25+. All commands run from `cla-backend-go/`.

```bash
make setup          # one-time: install swagger, golangci-lint, goimports; sets up swagger venv
make swagger        # regenerate API models/clients from swagger specs into gen/ (see below)
make build-mac      # build local binary -> bin/cla-mac (build-linux for Linux)
make test           # go test -v ./... with coverage
make lint           # golangci-lint (v1.64.8, config .golangci.yaml) + license header check
make fmt            # gofmt + goimports
make mock           # regenerate mocks via tools/regenmocks.sh
make all-mac        # full pipeline: clean swagger deps fmt build test lint (all-linux on Linux)
```

Run a single test: `go test -v ./signatures/ -run TestName`

Run locally (points at a real AWS environment — see below): build, set env, then `./bin/cla-mac` (from `make build-mac`) or `./bin/cla` (from `make build-linux`). Health checks at `http://localhost:8080/v3/ops/health` and `/v4/ops/health`. Set `GH_ORG_VALIDATION=false` to bypass GitHub auth checks for local curl/Postman testing.

### Swagger code generation (important)

The API is **swagger-first**. `gen/` is fully generated and is deleted/rebuilt by `make swagger` — never hand-edit files under `gen/`. Source specs are multi-file YAML under `swagger/` (`cla.v1.yaml`, `cla.v2.yaml`) compiled via `swagger/multi-file-swagger.py`. `make swagger` also downloads and generates clients for external LFX platform services (project-service, organization-service, user-service, acs-service) from their live dev swagger endpoints, so it requires network access. After changing an endpoint's spec, regenerate before implementing handlers.

### Module architecture pattern

Domain feature modules (e.g. `signatures/`, `approval_list/`, `company/`, `project/`, and most packages under `v2/`) follow a consistent three-layer split, though a module omits a layer it doesn't need (e.g. `v2/health` is handler-only, `v2/project-service` is a generated client with no handlers/service/repository):

- `handlers.go` — a `Configure(api, service, ...)` function that wires generated swagger operations to service calls. Handlers do request/response translation only.
- `service.go` — business logic, defined behind an interface; the unit-testable layer.
- `repository.go` — DynamoDB access. `dbmodels.go` holds table row structs; `converters.go` maps between DB models, generated API models, and internal models.
- `mocks/` — generated mocks (regenerate with `make mock`, don't edit by hand).

`v2/` packages are the newer LFX-Platform-integrated implementations; top-level packages are v1/legacy. Both are wired together in `cmd/server.go`.
