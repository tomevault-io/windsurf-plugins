# Git Workflow and Branching Rules

## CRITICAL: Branch Management

**DO NOT create a new branch if you're already on a feature branch!**

### When handling PR requests or /pr command:

1. **ALWAYS** check current branch first:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **Decision logic**:
   - If on `main` or `master` → Create a new feature branch
   - If already on a feature branch → Use the current branch
   - NEVER create nested feature branches

3. **Workflow**:
   ```bash
   # First, always check where you are
   current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)
   
   # Only create new branch if on main/master
   if [ "$current_branch" = "main" ] || [ "$current_branch" = "master" ]; then
     git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   else
     # Already on feature branch - just commit and push here
     echo "Already on feature branch: $current_branch"
   fi
   ```

## PR Updates

When updating an existing PR:
- Add new commits to the same branch
- Push to the existing remote branch
- The PR will automatically update

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Creating a new branch when already on a feature branch
❌ Creating multiple PRs for the same feature
❌ Abandoning branches with uncommitted changes

✅ Check branch status before any git operations
✅ Commit to the current feature branch
✅ Keep related changes in the same PR
