# AGENTS.md — Levara MCP Memory playbook

This file is the canonical guide for any AI agent (Claude, Cursor, Cline, ChatGPT
via MCP, custom Agent SDK clients) on how to use the Levara MCP memory layer
effectively. The goal: nothing important from a session should ever be lost,
and every future session should be able to reconstruct context cheaply.

Mirror of the "Levara MCP Memory" section in `CLAUDE.md`. Update both together.

## Levara memory

- Collection: `levara`
- Default room: `mcp`
- Runtime rooms:
  - `memory` — recall, isolation, consolidation, supersession, and provenance
  - `task-runtime` — tasks, criteria, steps, leases, receipts, checkpoints, blockers, and promotion
  - `observability` — validation failures, runtime health, metrics, and rollout
  - `deploy` — feature flags, profiles, services, and security
- Use the hall vocabulary and pin policy defined below. Never save Task checkpoints, receipts, temporary TODO state, code snippets, file paths, git history, or speculation as durable memory.

---

## TL;DR

1. **Session start** → `set_context(collection="levara")`, then `wake_up(max_tokens=300)`.
2. **Every decision/discovery/event** → immediately `save_memory(...)` with `room` and `hall`. Don't batch — save in the moment.
3. **Critical facts** → `pin_memory(key, priority=8-10)` so they appear in future `wake_up`.
4. **Recall before research** → `recall_memory(query, room=, hall=)` to surface prior decisions before reinventing.
5. **Never save** code/paths/git history — those live in source.

## The room × hall model

Two orthogonal axes. Always fill both when saving — empty fields kill recall precision.

| Axis | Question it answers | Type |
|---|---|---|
| **room** | *About what?* (subsystem, topic) | Free string: `auth`, `deploy`, `ocr-bench`, `mcp`, `kg-temporal`, ... |
| **hall** | *What kind of fact?* (genre) | Controlled vocab (validation enforced) |

### Hall vocabulary

| hall | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `fact` | Objective stable property | "Levara HNSW dim=1024", "Pi IP 10.23.0.53" |
| `event` | Something happened at a specific time (always include date in value) | "2026-04-07 shipped memory-palace features" |
| `decision` | Architectural/project choice + WHY | "chose SQLite over Postgres because Pi RAM limit" |
| `preference` | User stylistic preference | "respond in Russian, terse, no emojis" |
| `advice` | Reusable practical rule | "before WAL changes — snapshot first" |
| `discovery` | Non-obvious insight, bug, gotcha worth remembering | "fasthttp breaks io.Closer pool; fix via QArgs" |

`save_memory` returns an error on unknown halls. Adding new ones is a deliberate
code change in `internal/http/mcp_palace.go`.

## Save triggers — when to call `save_memory` proactively

These are hard rules. When any of these conditions fire, call `save_memory`
**immediately**, not at end of conversation.

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| User makes an architectural decision ("let's go with X, not Y") | `save_memory(hall="decision", room="<subsystem>")` — include the **why** |
| You found a root cause after debugging | `save_memory(hall="discovery", room="<subsystem>")` — symptom + cause + fix |
| User corrects your approach or specifies a style | `save_memory(hall="preference")` + `pin_memory(priority=10)` if global |
| New service/endpoint/IP/port appears | `save_memory(hall="fact")` + `pin_memory` if critical infra |
| Significant milestone completed (feature, refactor, release) | `save_memory(hall="event")` with absolute date in value |
| You gave the user a reusable recommendation | `save_memory(hall="advice")` |
| User mentions deadline, freeze window, external dependency | `save_memory(hall="event")` with absolute date |

### Do NOT save

- Code, file paths, function names — `git`/`grep` are authoritative; will go stale on rename.
- Git history, blame, who-changed-what — `git log` exists.
- In-progress task state — that's `TaskCreate`, not memory.
- Anything already in CLAUDE.md auto-memory (style, no_skip_tests, etc).
- Speculative future features.

## Pin policy

`pin_memory(key, priority)` marks a record so it always appears in `wake_up`.
Use sparingly — `wake_up` is bounded by `max_tokens`.

| priority | Use for |
|---|---|
| **10** | Global user preferences (style, language, hard rules) |
| **8** | Critical infrastructure (endpoints, IPs, ports, versions) |
| **5** | Currently-active major decisions |
| **1-3** | Optional contextual hints |

If `wake_up` becomes noisy → `unpin_memory(key)` for stale entries.

---

## Recall patterns

| Question | Command |
|---|---|
| "What did we decide about auth?" | `recall_memory(query="auth", hall="decision")` |
| "What are my style preferences?" | `list_memories(hall="preference")` |
| "What bugs hit migrations?" | `recall_memory(query="migration", hall="discovery")` |
| "Everything about deploy" | `list_memories(room="deploy")` |
| "Across multiple projects" | `cross_search(collections=["levara","other"])` |
| "Current owner of service X" | `query_entity(name="X")` |
| "Owner of X six months ago" | `query_entity(name="X", as_of="2025-10-01T00:00:00Z")` |

Recall **before** researching unfamiliar code or architecture — saves time
and ensures consistency with prior decisions.
