# AGENTS.md

This file defines the working rules for AI coding agents modifying Gemive.

## Project identity

Gemive is a Chrome Manifest V3 extension for live translated subtitles and interpretation audio on the current Chrome tab.

The product direction is intentionally narrow:

```txt
one active translation session
current-tab audio capture
floating subtitle overlay
optional launcher-only collapse
Markdown transcript export
```

Do not redesign it into a multi-session or multi-tab concurrent translation system unless the user explicitly asks for that architecture change.

## Ground rules

- Prefer small, targeted patches.
- Preserve existing runtime behavior unless the task explicitly changes it.
- Do not introduce a build step, bundler, framework, or TypeScript migration without explicit approval.
- Do not move files casually. The current structure is part of the handoff contract.
- Keep API keys, tokens, transcripts, and debug logs out of committed examples.
- Never hard-code a real Gemini API key.
- Keep UI strings localized in Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and English.
- Keep user-facing terminology consistent with existing `core/i18n.js` keys.
- Run syntax checks before packaging.

## Technical stack

```txt
Chrome Manifest V3
Vanilla JavaScript ES modules
No compile step
No bundler
No framework
No TypeScript
```

## Main paths

```txt
manifest.json
background/service-worker.js
content/subtitle-overlay.js
core/settings.js
core/i18n.js
core/language-registry.js
core/message-types.js
core/transcript-buffer.js
offscreen/audio-router.js
offscreen/gemini-live-client.js
offscreen/pcm16-encoder.js
offscreen/pcm16-player.js
options/options.html
options/options.css
options/options.js
popup/popup.html
popup/popup.css
popup/popup.js
storage/settings-store.js
storage/transcript-store.js
scripts/check-syntax.mjs
scripts/package-zip.mjs
```

## Default behavior to preserve

- Initial interface language follows Chrome UI language:
  - Traditional Chinese Chrome → `zh-Hant`
  - Simplified Chinese Chrome → `zh-Hans`
  - anything else → `en`
- Initial target language follows the same rule.
- Transcript saving is enabled by default.
- Original audio volume defaults to `0.75`.
- Interpretation audio volume defaults to `0.35`.
- Auto-collapse to logo is disabled by default.
- If auto-collapse is enabled, the overlay close control appears as `-` and collapses to launcher-only mode.
- If auto-collapse is disabled, the overlay close control appears as `X` and hides/closes the overlay normally.
- Pressing stop or pause stops translation only; it must not collapse the overlay.
- In launcher-only mode, only the logo should remain visible.
- A short click on the logo expands the overlay.
- Dragging the logo moves it and must not accidentally expand the overlay.

## Session model

Gemive supports a single active session.

Expected behavior:

```txt
No active session
→ popup shows Start

Current tab is translating
→ popup shows translating state and Stop is available

Another tab is translating
→ popup shows Switch to this tab
→ switching stops/restarts the single active session for the new tab
```

Do not create `Map<tabId, TranslationSession>` or parallel tab sessions unless explicitly requested.

## Gemini Live setup contract

The setup payload must keep transcription fields at the `setup` root level:

```js
{
  setup: {
    model: 'models/gemini-3.5-live-translate-preview',
    inputAudioTranscription: {},
    outputAudioTranscription: {},
    generationConfig: {
      responseModalities: ['AUDIO'],
      translationConfig: {
        targetLanguageCode: 'en',
        echoTargetLanguage: false
      }
    },
    realtimeInputConfig: {
      automaticActivityDetection: {
        disabled: false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Do not move `inputAudioTranscription` or `outputAudioTranscription` into `generationConfig`.

## Audio pipeline

The intended audio flow is:

```txt
chrome.tabCapture
→ offscreen document
→ AudioContext
→ original audio passthrough to destination
→ AudioWorklet
→ mono downmix
→ 16 kHz resample
→ PCM16 little-endian chunks
→ Gemini Live WebSocket
```

Gemini audio output is expected as 24 kHz PCM16 and is played through `pcm16-player.js`.

## Transcript rules

- Save transcripts only through `storage/transcript-store.js`.
- Export transcripts through the Chrome Downloads API.
- Do not attempt silent writes to arbitrary file system paths.
- Markdown export should remain readable and portable.
- Avoid changing transcript schema without also updating export code and docs.

## Overlay rules

The overlay is a content script with Shadow DOM. Be careful with CSS specificity because browser defaults and component-level display styles can override `hidden` attributes.

Launcher-only collapse must hide the subtitle card completely. It should not shrink the card into a smaller window.

When adding controls:

- Avoid blocking text selection inside subtitle content.
- Preserve drag and resize behavior.
- Preserve fullscreen relocation behavior.
- Keep the visual style aligned with Catppuccin Mocha and iOS dark grouped surfaces.

## Localization rules

When adding or changing UI text:

1. Add or update the key in `core/i18n.js` for all three UI locales.
