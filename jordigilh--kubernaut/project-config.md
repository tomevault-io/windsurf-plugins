# Kubernaut Project Structure Guide

## Core Architecture

Kubernaut is an AIOps platform for intelligent Kubernetes remediation. It follows a microservices architecture with CRD-based communication between controllers.

### Main Binaries (`cmd/`)

Each binary maps to a Kubernetes Deployment:

- [cmd/gateway/](mdc:cmd/gateway/) - Signal ingestion (Prometheus alerts, K8s events)
- [cmd/signalprocessing/](mdc:cmd/signalprocessing/) - Signal enrichment and classification
- [cmd/aianalysis/](mdc:cmd/aianalysis/) - AI-powered root cause analysis via HolmesGPT
- [cmd/remediationorchestrator/](mdc:cmd/remediationorchestrator/) - Remediation lifecycle orchestration
- [cmd/workflowexecution/](mdc:cmd/workflowexecution/) - Workflow execution (Job, Tekton, Ansible)
- [cmd/effectivenessmonitor/](mdc:cmd/effectivenessmonitor/) - Post-remediation effectiveness assessment
- [cmd/notification/](mdc:cmd/notification/) - Notification delivery (Slack, file, webhook)
- [cmd/datastorage/](mdc:cmd/datastorage/) - REST API for audit, workflow catalog, action history
- [cmd/authwebhook/](mdc:cmd/authwebhook/) - Kubernetes admission webhook for validation
- [cmd/must-gather/](mdc:cmd/must-gather/) - Diagnostic collection tool

### CRD API Types (`api/`)

Custom Resource Definitions that form the inter-service communication protocol:

- [api/remediation/](mdc:api/remediation/) - `RemediationRequest`, `RemediationApprovalRequest`
- [api/signalprocessing/](mdc:api/signalprocessing/) - `SignalProcessing`
- [api/aianalysis/](mdc:api/aianalysis/) - `AIAnalysis`
- [api/workflowexecution/](mdc:api/workflowexecution/) - `WorkflowExecution`
- [api/effectivenessassessment/](mdc:api/effectivenessassessment/) - `EffectivenessAssessment`
- [api/notification/](mdc:api/notification/) - `NotificationRequest`
- [api/actiontype/](mdc:api/actiontype/) - `ActionType`
- [api/remediationworkflow/](mdc:api/remediationworkflow/) - `RemediationWorkflow`

### Business Logic (`pkg/`)

Each service has a corresponding package under `pkg/`:

- [pkg/gateway/](mdc:pkg/gateway/) - Gateway server, processing pipeline, distributed locking
- [pkg/signalprocessing/](mdc:pkg/signalprocessing/) - Rego policy evaluation, enrichment
- [pkg/aianalysis/](mdc:pkg/aianalysis/) - Phase management, metrics
- [pkg/remediationorchestrator/](mdc:pkg/remediationorchestrator/) - Routing, scope blocking
- [pkg/workflowexecution/](mdc:pkg/workflowexecution/) - Execution engines, conditions
- [pkg/effectivenessmonitor/](mdc:pkg/effectivenessmonitor/) - Scoring, conditions
- [pkg/notification/](mdc:pkg/notification/) - Delivery, status, phase management
- [pkg/datastorage/](mdc:pkg/datastorage/) - OCI schema, repository, validation, reconstruction
- [pkg/authwebhook/](mdc:pkg/authwebhook/) - Webhook handler
- [pkg/holmesgpt/](mdc:pkg/holmesgpt/) - HolmesGPT API client
- [pkg/shared/](mdc:pkg/shared/) - Shared utilities (auth, hotreload, sanitization, types)
- [pkg/audit/](mdc:pkg/audit/) - Audit trail helpers
- [pkg/k8sutil/](mdc:pkg/k8sutil/) - Kubernetes client utilities
- [pkg/workflowschema/](mdc:pkg/workflowschema/) - Workflow schema parsing

### Internal Packages (`internal/`)

- [internal/controller/](mdc:internal/controller/) - CRD controller implementations (one per controller type)
- [internal/config/](mdc:internal/config/) - Shared configuration types
- [internal/version/](mdc:internal/version/) - Build version info

### Testing (`test/`)

Three-tier testing strategy (80% per-tier coverage target):

- [test/unit/](mdc:test/unit/) - Pure logic tests (per-service subdirs)
- [test/integration/](mdc:test/integration/) - Cross-component with real I/O (per-service subdirs)
- [test/e2e/](mdc:test/e2e/) - Full Kind cluster tests (per-service subdirs)
- [test/infrastructure/](mdc:test/infrastructure/) - Shared test infrastructure helpers
- [test/shared/](mdc:test/shared/) - Shared test validators and helpers

## Documentation (`docs/`)

Organized into 7 top-level directories:

- [docs/architecture/](mdc:docs/architecture/) - ADRs, DDs, diagrams, case studies, patterns
- [docs/design/](mdc:docs/design/) - CRD design specifications
- [docs/requirements/](mdc:docs/requirements/) - Business requirements (BR-*) and module docs
- [docs/testing/](mdc:docs/testing/) - Test plans, guidelines, patterns, per-issue test docs
- [docs/operations/](mdc:docs/operations/) - Deployment, build, CI/CD, troubleshooting, runbooks
- [docs/development/](mdc:docs/development/) - Methodology (APDC), guidelines, getting-started, guides
- [docs/services/](mdc:docs/services/) - Per-service documentation (stateless + CRD controllers)

User-facing documentation lives at [kubernaut-docs](https://jordigilh.github.io/kubernaut-docs/).

## Deployment

- [charts/kubernaut/](mdc:charts/kubernaut/) - Helm chart (primary deployment method)
- [deploy/](mdc:deploy/) - Per-service Kustomize manifests, action types, CRDs

## Build System

- [Makefile](mdc:Makefile) - All build operations
- [docker/](mdc:docker/) - Per-service Dockerfiles
- `make test` (unit), `make test-integration` (integration), `make test-e2e` (E2E)
