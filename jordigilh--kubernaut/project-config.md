# Kubernaut AI Collaboration Rules

## Rule 1: Pause, Assess, Communicate (Before Significant Actions)

Before executing any significant action (tests, commits, refactors, new implementations, destructive operations), the AI agent MUST pause and assess whether there is anything relevant to share with the user.

### When to Pause and Share

**ALWAYS share if you have:**
- ❓ **Questions**: Ambiguities, missing information, or unclear requirements
- ⚠️ **Concerns**: Potential issues, risks, conflicts, or anti-patterns
- 🔄 **Alternatives**: Different approaches worth considering
- 📊 **Confidence Gaps**: Uncertainty about the approach (<90% confidence)
- 💡 **Recommendations**: Suggested improvements or optimizations with rationale

**SKIP if:**
- ✅ Everything is clear, straightforward, and routine
- ✅ High confidence (>95%) with no concerns
- ✅ User explicitly said "proceed without asking"

### Scope: Significant Actions

- Running tests (integration, E2E) - especially if >5 min execution time
- Committing code changes
- Refactoring existing code
- Creating new files or modules
- Destructive operations (delete, force push, etc.)
- Long-running builds or deployments
- Architectural changes

### Format for Assessment

When pausing, provide:

1. **Questions**: What needs clarification?
2. **Concerns**: What might go wrong? What are the risks?
3. **Alternatives**: Are there other approaches to consider?
4. **Confidence**: High/Medium/Low + explain gaps
5. **Recommendations**: What do you suggest and why?

### Example

```
Before running E2E tests, I want to share:

❓ Questions:
- Should we run all E2E tests or just the BR-HAPI-197 subset?

⚠️ Concerns:
- E2E tests take ~10 minutes and create a full Kind cluster
- Mock LLM scenario "mock_rca_incomplete" may not be loaded in ConfigMap yet

🔄 Alternatives:
A) Run just BR-HAPI-197 tests (faster, focused)
B) Run full suite (comprehensive, but 20+ min)

📊 Confidence: Medium (75%)
- Mock LLM integration is untested with new scenario

💡 Recommendation: Run BR-HAPI-197 tests first (Option A), validate Mock LLM scenario works, then run full suite

Proceed with Option A?
```

## Rule 2: Strict TDD Adherence

Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle rigorously:
1. **RED**: Write failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality, reduce duplication

Never skip REFACTOR phase. Self-check for TDD compliance in assessments.

---

## Rule 3: No Pending Tests

Never use `XIt` or pending tests. Either:
- Implement the test (following TDD)
- Remove it from the test plan

Pending tests violate Kubernaut's TDD philosophy.

---

## Rule 4: Follow Authoritative Documentation

Always consult and align with:
- Business Requirements (BRs)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Design Documents (DDs)
- Testing Guidelines

Flag conflicts between docs and implementation.

---

## Rule 5: Code Quality Standards

- Reuse existing patterns (don't reinvent)
- Avoid duplication (extract helpers)
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Preserve exact indentation (tabs/spaces)
