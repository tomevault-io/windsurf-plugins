# Conflict Resolution Matrix

## Priority Hierarchy - MANDATORY

**Rule**: Apply higher priority rules first when conflicts occur
**Prevention**: Use priority hierarchy to avoid conflicts during design phase

### Authoritative Rule Hierarchy
| Priority | Rule | Status | Authority | Scope |
|----------|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **1. FOUNDATIONAL** | 00-core-development-methodology.mdc | FOUNDATIONAL | APDC Framework | All development |
| **2. MANDATORY** | 00-project-guidelines.mdc | MANDATORY PRINCIPLES | TDD & Business Requirements | All development |
| **3. BEHAVIORAL** | 01-ai-assistant-behavior.mdc | AI ASSISTANT CONTROL | AI Assistant Behavior | AI assistant usage |
| **5. TESTING** | 03-testing-strategy.mdc | AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE | Testing & Mock Strategy | All testing |
| **6. SPECIALIZED** | 04,05,12,etc | DOMAIN-SPECIFIC | Specialized Implementation | Specific domains |
| **7. QUALITY** | 06,08,09,10 | VALIDATION | Quality Assurance | Post-development |
| **8. INTEGRATION** | 07,01,02 | IMPLEMENTATION | Code Integration | Implementation details |

### Rule Precedence When Conflicts Occur
1. **FOUNDATIONAL (00-core)** overrides everything - APDC methodology is mandatory
2. **MANDATORY PRINCIPLES (00-project)** override all except foundational
3. **BEHAVIORAL CONSTRAINTS** override development decisions but not methodology
4. **TESTING STRATEGY (03)** is authoritative for all testing and mock decisions
5. **SPECIALIZED RULES** override general implementation but not methodology/testing
6. **QUALITY RULES** provide validation but don't override implementation decisions

## Common Conflicts Resolution

### Integration vs Speed
**CONFLICT**: AI sophistication vs Integration requirement
**RESOLUTION**: Integration wins - implement simple → integrate → enhance in REFACTOR
**PREVENTION**: Plan integration points during APDC Analysis phase

### TDD vs Sophistication
**CONFLICT**: Complex algorithms vs TDD GREEN minimalism
**RESOLUTION**: TDD timing controls - minimal GREEN → sophisticated REFACTOR
**PREVENTION**: Reserve sophisticated logic for REFACTOR phase in APDC Plan

### AI vs General (Rule 12 vs Others)
**CONFLICT**: AI-specific guidance vs general Go patterns
**RESOLUTION**: AI-specific rules win for AI components
**PREVENTION**: Identify AI components during APDC Analysis phase

### Testing Strategy vs Anti-Patterns (Rule 03 vs Rule 08)
**CONFLICT**: Pyramid testing approach vs anti-pattern detection
**RESOLUTION**: Both apply - pyramid strategy with anti-pattern prevention
**PREVENTION**: Design tests following pyramid strategy during APDC Plan phase

### Interface Validation vs Development Speed (Rule 09)
**CONFLICT**: Interface validation requirements vs rapid development
**RESOLUTION**: Validation wins - prevents build errors and technical debt
**PREVENTION**: Verify interface existence during APDC Analysis phase

### Safety vs Speed
**CONFLICT**: K8s safety validation vs development speed
**RESOLUTION**: Safety wins - include safety in GREEN phase
**PREVENTION**: Consider safety requirements during APDC Analysis and Plan phases

## Prevention-Focused Conflict Resolution

### Core APDC Prevention Framework
**Built-in quality through systematic approach:**

**Analysis Prevention**: Start with clear business context and existing code understanding
**Plan Prevention**: Design integration and success criteria before coding
**Do Prevention**: Follow TDD phases with mandatory integration in GREEN
**Check Prevention**: Verify planned outcomes were achieved through implementation

### Business Requirements Prevention
**Conflict Prevention**: Use standardized BR-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER] format during Analysis
**Integration Prevention**: Plan main application integration during Plan phase
**Alignment Prevention**: Map all code to documented business requirements

### TDD Phase Conflict Prevention
**RED Prevention**: Write tests first, use existing interfaces
**GREEN Prevention**: Minimal implementation with mandatory integration
**REFACTOR Prevention**: Enhance existing code only, no new types

### Prevention-Focused Conflict Avoidance
**Integration Conflict Prevention**:
- Plan main application integration during APDC Analysis phase
- Design component usage before implementation begins
- Ensure business code serves documented requirements

**TDD Phase Conflict Prevention**:
- Reserve new type creation for RED phase only
- Plan enhancement approach during REFACTOR phase
- Design minimal implementation strategy for GREEN phase

**Testing Strategy Conflict Prevention**:
- Follow authoritative mock usage matrix from Rule 03
- Design testing approach following pyramid strategy
- Plan anti-pattern avoidance during design phase

## Prevention Protocol

### Preventive Resolution
1. **ANALYZE**: Apply rule priority hierarchy during APDC Analysis phase
2. **PLAN**: Design implementation to avoid conflicts during APDC Plan phase
3. **IMPLEMENT**: Follow highest priority rule guidance during APDC Do phase
4. **VERIFY**: Confirm conflict prevention during APDC Check phase

### Manual Resolution Process
**When conflicts arise during implementation:**
1. **STOP**: Halt implementation immediately
2. **HIERARCHY**: Apply rule priority hierarchy (Foundational > Mandatory > Behavioral > etc.)
