Guidance for Claude Code working in the **glass** open-core Rust workspace.

## What glass is

A Rust **MCP server** giving an AI agent a closed **build → see → interact → debug** loop
over external native GUI apps: launch, capture (lossless WebP), inject mouse/keyboard,
read logs, diff against baselines, wait-until-stable, and read/drive the accessibility
tree — served over MCP (stdio, or `serve --http`). Backends behind a `Platform` seam: X11
and Wayland (headless sway) on Linux, Windows (WGC/SendInput), Android (native apps in an AVD
emulator over `adb`, host-OS-agnostic; clipboard + high-fidelity input via an optional
on-device companion agent), iOS (native apps in the Simulator over `xcrun simctl`; capture,
logs, clipboard, plus input and the accessibility tree via `idb_companion`, multi-touch
gestures excepted), macOS (ScreenCaptureKit
capture, CGEvent input, AXUIElement
windows/logs, accessibility tree, clipboard (isolated + working under containment for
apps not built with hardened runtime, via a `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` swizzle shim;
hardened-runtime apps fall back to unsupported), sandboxing (Seatbelt)).

## Layout

Cargo workspace at the repo root. Crates: `glass-core` (platform-agnostic heart — the
`Platform`/`Accessibility` seams, session, `Frame`, diff, stability, log buffer), the
backends (`glass-x11`, `glass-wayland`, `glass-windows`, `glass-android`, `glass-ios` (the iOS
Simulator backend over `xcrun simctl`), `glass-macos`), the a11y readers
(`glass-a11y-linux`, `glass-a11y-windows`, `glass-a11y-macos`; the Android `uiautomator`
reader lives in `glass-android`), `glass-sandbox-linux`, `glass-sandbox-macos`, the `glass-mcp` server binary, and the
`glass-testapp` fixture. `glass-android` also holds the host-side client + lifecycle for two
optional on-device companions — an `app_process` agent (clipboard + high-fidelity input) and an
`AccessibilityService` (Compose-rich a11y tree + high-fidelity `set_value`); both live in the
separate repo `github.com/fixed-width/glass-android-agent`, driven over `adb forward`.

## Commands

```bash
cargo build
cargo test --workspace                    # unit tests (integration tests are #[ignore]d)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings   # lint gate — keep clean
./scripts/test-x11.sh [name]              # X11 integration suite (self-starts Xvfb)
./scripts/test-wayland.sh [name]          # Wayland suite (needs sway >=1.12)
./scripts/test-a11y.sh [name]             # AT-SPI suite
```
The workspace is pinned to nightly via `rust-toolchain.toml`.

Those cover Linux. They do **not** compile `cfg(target_os = "macos")` or `cfg(windows)` code, so on
a change to a platform crate they report clean without having looked at it —
[docs/how-to/verify-a-change.md](docs/how-to/verify-a-change.md) has the per-target commands that
do, most of which run from any host.

## Invariants

- **External automation only** — drive apps as a black box; never require the app to be glass-aware.
- **Keep `glass-core` platform-agnostic** — no OS types in core; every OS detail lives behind `Platform`.
- **No silent fallbacks** — a failed capture/input returns a structured error, never a blank/stale frame.
- **Coordinates are window-relative** at the tool boundary; only the backend maps to global coords.
- **Permissively-licensed deps only** (MIT/Apache; no copyleft).
- **Avoid `unsafe`** — prefer safe abstractions; isolate + document any required `unsafe` with `// SAFETY:`.

## Licensing

Open core, **Apache-2.0**. See `LICENSE-APACHE`.
