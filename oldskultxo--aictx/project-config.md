# AGENTS Instructions for `aictx`

- `aictx` is the distributable multi-LLM installer/runtime layer for `.aictx_*`.
- Local filesystem artifacts are created by scripting/runtime, never by the LLM.
- Prefer eager scaffold semantics: structure exists immediately after `aictx init`.
- Cross-project behavior must come from workspace registry/config, never hardcoded machine paths.
- For subsystem changes, validate with `python3 -m aictx internal migrate`, `internal boot`, `internal query`, `internal packet`, `internal memory-graph --refresh`, and `report real-usage --repo <repo>` when relevant.

<!-- AICTX:START -->
## AI Context Engine

This repository is initialized for `aictx`.

Agent rules:
- Enter the runtime middleware for every execution in initialized repos.
- The AICTX lifecycle remains `prepare/startup context → resume capsule → work → finalize → final AICTX summary/persistence`.
- MCP-first startup:
  1. If AICTX MCP tools are already visible, use MCP tools for resume/finalize.
  2. If AICTX MCP tools are not visible but `.mcp.json` or `.vscode/mcp.json` exists, first use runner tool discovery when available (for example search for `aictx resume finalize lifecycle`) so lazy-loaded MCP namespaces can attach, then have the runner attach/start the configured stdio MCP server before the first AICTX command of each new session.
  3. If MCP tools still are not attached after discovery/attachment, state that MCP config exists but tools are unavailable in this runner and use the CLI fallback.
- At session start:
  1. Extract the task goal from the user prompt.
  2. Run exactly one AICTX continuity command: MCP resume when available, otherwise `aictx resume --repo . --task "<task goal>" --json`.
  3. Do not pass the full user prompt to resume; exclude reporting instructions, metrics schemas, output format rules, final answer format, benchmark/evaluation harness text, logging instructions, and meta-instructions about how to report the work.
- After task work, run exactly one AICTX finalization command: MCP finalize when available, otherwise `aictx finalize --repo . --status success|failure --summary "<what happened>" --json`.
- Use the returned continuity capsule as the operational brief during normal agent startup; follow `execution_contract.first_action` before repo-wide orientation, edit within `execution_contract.edit_scope`, run `execution_contract.test_command.command`, then finalize.
- Render exactly one startup banner source: normal agent startup uses `resume.startup_banner_text` or `resume.startup_banner_render_payload`; wrapped execution uses `prepare_execution().startup_banner_text` or `prepare_execution().startup_banner_render_payload`. Do not render both.
- `resume` is the canonical agent-facing continuity query; it does not replace `prepare_execution`, `aictx finalize`, the startup banner, the final AICTX summary, or persistence.
- Do not inspect `.aictx/`.
- Do not run exploratory AICTX commands.
- Do not run `aictx internal`, `aictx -h`, `aictx reuse`, `aictx suggest`, `aictx next`, `aictx task`, `aictx messages`, `aictx reflect`, or `aictx report` during normal task startup unless the user asks for AICTX diagnostics, the task is about AICTX itself, resume is missing/corrupt/contradictory, or finalization/update lifecycle requires it.
- On the first execution of each visible session, always show the startup banner at the start of the first substantive user-visible response; do not consume it with a transient progress/status message that will be omitted from the final task response. Render the selected resume/prepare startup banner in the current user language. When the selected startup banner policy points to a structured render payload, prefer that structured payload for localization and use compact text only as the fallback source. You may fully rephrase human-readable prose from structured factual fields while preserving exact facts, file paths, commands, flags, package names, test names, code identifiers, and other technical tokens; do not add, remove, reorder, reinterpret, or invent facts. If first-session text is missing, render `{agent_label} · session #{session_count} · awake` from selected identity fields. Do not render it again after `already_shown` is true.
- Use `aictx finalize --repo . --status success|failure --summary "<what happened>" --json` for normal agent finalization. finalize_execution is the middleware API behind that command; do not call it directly from the shell. Do not run `aictx internal execution finalize` during normal task flow.
- After finalize, append the AICTX final summary to the final user response, using `agent_summary_text` as the compact fallback user-facing source. When `agent_summary_policy.render_payload_field` points to `agent_summary_render_payload`, prefer that structured payload for localization while preserving exact facts, technical tokens, and the details/continuity link targets. Render every provided summary section, including `details`, `continuity_view_file`, and `continuity_view_online`; do not replace Mermaid URLs with placeholders and do not manually reconstruct or retype pako URLs.
- If no finalize output exists, say `AICTX summary unavailable`.
- Use the `aictx resume` capsule before deeper repo analysis.
