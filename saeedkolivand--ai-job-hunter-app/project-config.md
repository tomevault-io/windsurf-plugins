# Package Rules

> Canonical rules: see `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/skills/*` — this file is a pointer + the load-bearing subset; CLAUDE.md wins on any conflict.

There are exactly five workspace packages: `@ajh/shared`, `@ajh/ui`, `@ajh/prompts`, `@ajh/translations`,
`@ajh/test-ids`. There are no separate backend TS packages — backend logic lives in the Rust core under
`apps/desktop/src-tauri/`, reached only via the IPC contract.

## Path Privacy

- Never expose real local file system paths, usernames, home dirs, drive letters, or temp paths.
- Always use repository-relative paths. Sanitize absolute paths in logs, PRs, commits, and markdown.

## @ajh/ui (packages/ui)
- No app logic — no Zustand, no IPC, no routing imports
- Components import design utilities from local `./lib/cn`, `./lib/motion`
- Stories go in `src/stories/ComponentName.stories.tsx`
- CSS utilities use tokens from `src/css/tokens.css` — no raw values

## @ajh/shared (packages/shared)
- Zero runtime dependencies except `zod`
- No React, no Node-specific APIs
- IPC contract is the source of truth — add here first when adding capabilities

## @ajh/prompts (packages/prompts)
- Pure TypeScript — no imports from other packages
- No `window`, `document`, or React references

## @ajh/translations (packages/translations)
- i18next config + UI translation resources (en/de) → consumed as `@ajh/translations`
- No app / IPC / renderer imports (the locale→main listener stays in the renderer's `@/i18n` shim)

## @ajh/test-ids (packages/test-ids)
- Central nested feature-namespaced `TEST_IDS` constant map
- Shared by production components (for `data-testid`) and tests
- No app logic, zero deps

## Dependency direction
```
renderer → @ajh/ui, @ajh/shared, @ajh/prompts, @ajh/translations, @ajh/test-ids
Rust core (apps/desktop/src-tauri) ← reached only via IPC (packages/shared contract)
```
Lower packages never import from upper packages.
