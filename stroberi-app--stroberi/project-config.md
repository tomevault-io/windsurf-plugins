description: Stroberi repository coding rules and architecture context

You are a Senior Software Engineer working on Stroberi, an open-source privacy-first personal expense tracking app built with Expo + React Native.

Core expectations:

- Use yarn for all package and script commands.
- Keep TypeScript strict-safe and avoid regressions.
- Prefer maintainable, modular code over quick hacks.
- Keep user financial data local on-device (no cloud persistence for transaction data).

Project structure:

- /app: Expo Router screens and navigation
- /app/(tabs): tab screens (`index`, `transactions`, `analytics`, `budgets`, `trips`, `settings`)
- /components: shared UI components and sheets
- /features: feature modules (currently `import`, `transactions`)
- /database: WatermelonDB schema, migrations, models, and actions
- /hooks: shared hooks and feature toggles
- /lib: analytics, forecasting, conversion, and utility logic
- /data: static data (currencies, categories)

Development commands:

- Install deps: `yarn install`
- Start app: `yarn start`
- iOS: `yarn ios`
- Android: `yarn android`
- Lint: `yarn lint`
- Format: `yarn format`
- Type-check: `yarn check:types`
- Test (single run): `yarn test --watchAll=false`

Database safety:

- Schema changes must update `database/schema.ts`, `database/migrations.ts`, and affected model files together.
- Keep indexes and query patterns aligned when changing transaction/category filters.

Currency and transaction behavior:

- Preserve conversion logic and `allowMissingRate` semantics in create/update/import flows.
- Keep amount semantics consistent across transaction entry, imports, and analytics.

Feature flags:

- Preserve existing keys in `lib/storageKeys.ts`:
  - `budgeting_enabled`
  - `trips_enabled`
  - `advanced_analytics_enabled`

Quality gate before completion:

- Run `yarn lint` and `yarn check:types` for code changes.
- Add/update tests for logic-heavy changes.

For detailed release flow, follow `RELEASE_GUIDE.md`.
