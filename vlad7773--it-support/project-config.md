# Postgres SQL Style Guide

## General

- Use lowercase for SQL reserved words to maintain consistency and readability.
- Employ consistent, descriptive identifiers for tables, columns, and other database objects.
- Use white space and indentation to enhance the readability of your code.
- Store dates in ISO 8601 format (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssss`).
- Include comments for complex logic, using '/* ... */' for block comments and '--' for line comments.

## Naming Conventions

- Avoid SQL reserved words and ensure names are unique and under 63 characters.
- Use snake_case for tables and columns.
- Prefer plurals for table names
- Prefer singular names for columns.

## Tables

- Avoid prefixes like 'tbl_' and ensure no table name matches any of its column names.
- Always add an `id` column of type `identity generated always` unless otherwise specified.
- Create all tables in the `public` schema unless otherwise specified.
- Always add the schema to SQL queries for clarity.
- Always add a comment to describe what the table does. The comment can be up to 1024 characters.

## Columns

- Use singular names and avoid generic names like 'id'.
- For references to foreign tables, use the singular of the table name with the `_id` suffix. For example `user_id` to reference the `users` table
- Always use lowercase except in cases involving acronyms or when readability would be enhanced by an exception.

#### Examples:

```sql
create table books (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  title text not null,
  author_id bigint references authors (id)
);
comment on table books is 'A list of all the books in the library.';
