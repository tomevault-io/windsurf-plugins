# Bootstrap gate

- Phase 00 is **bootstrap only**. Do not add: provider adapters, routing logic, billing, key wallet, hosted proxy/gateway, dashboard app logic.
- **Allowed only:** scaffolding, docs, rules, skills, subagents, scripts, workflows, templates, placeholders.
- **Plan Mode** required before: changes touching >3 files, CI/workflow changes, rule/skill/subagent work, security-sensitive or repo-structure changes.
- If the change adds product or business logic, **stop and flag**; do not implement until the gate is lifted.
