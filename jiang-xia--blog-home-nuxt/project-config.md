## Commit Message Rules

### language
Commit messages are written in Simplified Chinese (简体中文) language. The entire commit message must be in Chinese except Conventional Commits type/scope keywords.

### format
Use Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

- type: English — feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- subject: Simplified Chinese only, no period, max 50 characters
- NEVER write subject or body in English

### examples
feat(rpg): 优化抽奖页音效播放时机
fix(deploy): 移除仅 Linux 本地用的 deploy.sh
docs: 更新 PM2 部署说明
