# Project Architecture Guidelines

## Overview
- Always use pure JavaScript. Not TypeScript or JSX.
- Always use pure CSS. Not a build-produced framework or library.

## JavaScript

### Formatting
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use double quotes for strings unless interpolation is needed
- Use semicolons consistently
- Use trailing commas in objects and arrays
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and components
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names that explain intent

### Function Guidelines
- Keep functions small and focused (ideally < 20 lines)
- Use pure functions when possible
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Prefer arrow functions.

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
- Keep related files together in logical directories
- Use descriptive directory names that reflect their purpose
- Separate concerns (presentation, data, utilities)
- Group by feature when appropriate

### File Naming
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names
- Use consistent naming patterns across the project

## Module Organization

### Imports and Exports
- Use ESM `import`/`export` syntax exclusively
- Use named exports for multiple exports from a module
- Use relative paths for local modules WITH file extension: `./foo/bar.js`

### Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Prefer ESM-compatible versions when available
- Use specific versions to ensure stability
- Document all external dependencies and their CDN sources
