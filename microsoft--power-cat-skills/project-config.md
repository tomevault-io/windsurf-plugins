# Power CAT Skills - Development Guidelines

This file provides guidance to AI Agents when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A **plugin marketplace** for Power CAT development by Microsoft. The marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) references individual plugins in `plugins/`. Each plugin has its own `AGENTS.md` with plugin-specific guidance.

## Repository Structure

## Plugins & Skills

| Plugin | Skill | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `powercat-adoption` | `/powercat-storytelling` | Generate a polished 5-slide HTML customer story deck — brand-matched, self-contained, and presentation-ready |
| `powercat-canvas-apps` | `/analyze-canvas-performance` | Code review and performance audit of Canvas App pa.yaml files |
| `powercat-canvas-apps` | `/infopath-to-canvas` | Migrate InfoPath .xsn forms to Power Apps Canvas Apps |
| `powercat-canvas-apps` | `/migrate-to-dataverse` | Replace SharePoint list sources in a Canvas App with Dataverse tables |
| `powercat-dataverse` | `/dataverse-webapi-query` | Author and ship Dataverse Web API queries — natural language → OData URL, FetchXML conversion, multi-surface targeting, error diagnosis |
| `powercat-governance` | `/create-pp-dev-env` | Provision a Power Platform Developer environment with standard governance defaults on behalf of any user |

## Local Development

Test a plugin locally by launching your AI agent with the plugin path:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugins/<plugin-name>
```

No root-level build, lint, or test commands exist. Build/test tooling lives inside each plugin.

## Plugin Conventions

Each plugin follows this structure:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Plugin metadata (name, version, keywords)
- `.mcp.json` — MCP server configuration (optional)
- `agents/` — Agent definitions (`.md` files with YAML frontmatter)
- `skills/` — Skill definitions, each in its own subdirectory with a `SKILL.md`
- `scripts/` — Shared utility scripts referenced by skills and agents
- `references/` — Shared reference documents used by multiple skills

Skills are defined in `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools, model, hooks). The `allowed-tools` field must use a **comma-separated list** (e.g., `allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep`) — not JSON array syntax (`["Read", "Write"]`) or YAML list syntax. Each skill may include validation scripts in a `scripts/` subdirectory, run as Stop hooks when the skill session ends.

## Cross-Plugin Shared Skills

Skills that apply to all plugins live in `shared/skills/<skill-name>/`. The workflow logic is written once in a shared `.md` file, and each plugin has a thin `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` that contains only the YAML frontmatter and a reference to the shared workflow file.

**Pattern:**
- `shared/skills/<skill-name>/<workflow>.md` — Full workflow (phases, instructions, field definitions)
- `shared/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.template.md` — Template SKILL.md (frontmatter + reference to workflow); supports `{{PLUGIN_NAME}}` placeholder
- `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — Per-plugin wrapper generated from the template above

This keeps the skill discoverable in each plugin while avoiding content duplication. When updating a shared skill, edit the workflow file and/or `SKILL.template.md` in `shared/`, then update the per-plugin wrappers (frontmatter + reference pointing to the shared workflow, with `{{PLUGIN_NAME}}` substituted) and commit them alongside the shared change.
