## What is Promode?

Promode is a Claude Code plugin that enhances how Claude builds software. It provides:

- **Skills** — Domain knowledge that loads just-in-time (managing CLAUDE.md files, installing skills)
- **Agents** — Phase-specific subagents for planning, research, implementation, review, and debugging

The core philosophy: TDD is non-negotiable, tests are the documentation, context is precious, and agents should delegate aggressively to conserve it.

### Phase Agents

Claude Code subagents do NOT inherit CLAUDE.md from the main conversation. This creates a problem: subagents spawned via the Task tool don't know project conventions, TDD practices, or behavioural-authority rules.

**Solution**: Phase-specific agents in `plugins/promode/agents/` each have promode methodology baked in:

| Agent | Purpose | Model |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `promode:implementer` | TDD workflow, write code | sonnet |
| `promode:reviewer` | Code review, approve or request rework | sonnet/opus |
| `promode:debugger` | Root cause analysis, reproduce with test, report findings (does NOT fix unless asked) | sonnet/opus |
| `promode:tester` | Run tests, return AI-optimized results, critique quality | sonnet |
| `promode:qa-expert` | Blackbox QA from outside-in, creates testing tools, flags slow tests | sonnet |
| `promode:environment-manager` | Docker, services, health checks, env scripts | sonnet |
| `promode:online-researcher` | Web search, date-aware research for fast-moving topics | sonnet |
| `promode:product-design-expert` | Product decisions: UX, psychology, behavioural economics, growth. Maintains docs/product/ | sonnet |
| `promode:agent-analyzer` | Analyze agent output files, answer questions about what agents did | sonnet |

**Note**: Brainstorming, planning, plan reviews, and architectural decisions are done by the main agent (Opus 4.6) — never delegated to subagents. Use built-in `Explore` agents for codebase research.

### Keeping Agents in Sync

All phase agents share the same **principles and conventions** but have **phase-specific workflows**:
- `plugins/promode/skills/managing-claude-code-meta/standard/MAIN_AGENT_CLAUDE.md` — main agent (orchestrates, converses with user)
- `plugins/promode/agents/*.md` — phase agents (execute specific tasks, report back)

When updating shared content (principles, TDD rules, behavioural-authority), update the main agent file and relevant phase agents.
