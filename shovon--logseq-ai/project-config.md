Files are organized by feature; not by functionality.

So there's generally no dedicated `views` folder. It's all just features.

For example, if `App.tsx` will rely on a component, but no other component will rely on it, then don't place the component in some `views` folder; just put it in the same `App` folder.

The only time functionality are factored in is when it is shared across different parts of the code (such as services).
