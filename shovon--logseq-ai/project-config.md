Before reading the coding rules below, it's important to remember Postel's law (also known as robustness principle):

> be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others

## Do not extend nominal types

This is the "be conservative in what you do" principle of Postel's law.

```typescript
// A nominal type defined as:
//
// type SomeLibraryType = {
//   [SomeUnexportedLibrarySymbol]: true
//   // All the rest
// };
// Note: SomeUnexportedLibrarySymbol is simply inaccessible directly.

// ❌ Do not do this
type SomeLibraryTypeExtention = SomeLibraryType & {
  /* More fields here */
};
```

### What to do instead

No matter how much extending feels "elegant", just wrap the object that you "feel" like extending into an object that contain the fields that you want:

```
type SomeTypeAndMore = {
  libraryType: SomeLibraryType,

  // more fields
}
```

The idiom in a lot of other programming languages have something called "embedded" types, for example Go, albeit Go has a bunch of other syntactic and other semantic sugars on top, but at a lower-level, it's all the same thing.

## Avoid exposing nominal types

This is the "be liberal in what you accept from others" principle of Postel's law.

Bottom line is, just avoid nominal types in general. You can't control what users will do.

That said, runtime assertions are often necessary, but nominal types add more overhead than is already necessary. Use them very, very sparingly.
