## Nominal typing in TypeScript

TypeScript doesn't support nominal typing per-se. That said we can emulate it using branded types and symbols.

### Branded types

A common idiom among TypeScript developers is the concept of a branded type.

Imagine an object that holds a field `type` that's a string, and a value `data` who's type is parameterized by a generic, `T`.

An object that isn't branded would take on the following shape:

```typescript
type NonBrandedType<T> = {
  type: string;
  data: T;
};
```

A branded type would take on the following shape:

```typescript
type BrandedType<T> = {
  __brand: unknown;
  type: string;
  data: T;
};
```

However, one critical flaw is that brandedness doesn't stop anyone from initializing an object that wasn't initialized by the "brand". For example, a library that needs strict control for object creation shouldn't trust the use of some `__brand` field that just about anyone can create.

### Stronger Brandedness: nominal types

This will require a combination of using symbols and a weakmap to truly make things branded. It's not a compile-time guarantee but it is one way of deterring client code from constructing branded types without the library doing so.

#### Symbols

TypeScript supports typing unique symbols. Better yet, you can have it not be exported and client codes will simply not be able to construct the object.

```typescript
const brandTag: unique symbol = Symbol("brand");

export type BrandedType<T> = Readonly<{
  [brandTag]: true;
  type: string;
  data: T;
}>;
```

But that still doesn't stop clients from using reflections to extract that symbol to fabricate some type.

#### WeakSet

We can combine the above solution with a WeakMap to really tell at runtime whether the object was fabricated externally, or was branded internally before sending it out to clients.

```diff
+const brandPool = WeakSet<object>;
+
const brandTag: unique symbol = Symbol('brand');

export type BrandedType<T> = Readonly<{
  [brandTag]: true,
  type: string,
  data: T
}>;
+
+const create = () => {
+  // Creation logic
+  declare const myObject: BrandedType<string>;
+  brandPool.add(myObject);
+  return myObject;
+};
```
