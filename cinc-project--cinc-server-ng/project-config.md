cinc-server-ng is a drop-in replacement for **both** Chef Infra Server and chef-zero, written in Go. It speaks the real Chef Infra Server API and authenticates unmodified `chef-client`/`knife`/`cinc` clients via genuine Mixlib::Authentication signed requests. State lives behind a pluggable `store.Backend`: memory by default (the chef-zero role) or SQLite for durable state (`--storage sqlite --db <path>`). Fidelity to real Chef Infra Server behavior is the goal; Policyfiles/policy groups are first-class.

## Commands

`make help` documents every target. Most used: `make build`, `make test` (`go test ./... -race -cover`), `make lint` (golangci-lint; subsumes `make vet` and a gofmt check, and covers the conformance/differential build tags). Single test: `go test ./internal/api/ -run TestName -v` (most logic lives in `internal/api`).

What `make help` does not say: `make conformance` skips when knife is unusable unless `CINC_SERVER_NG_REQUIRE_CONFORMANCE=1` (CI and the make target set it), which turns that skip into a failure; and the differential harness is itself unit-tested without a real Chef Infra Server by comparing two cinc-server-ng instances, so `go test ./differential/` runs in the normal suite.

Flags: `make run ARGS="..."`, or `--help`. `--storage sqlite` requires `--db`; `--init` seeds the store and exits without serving. Dev database, test accounts, and cinc-console wiring live in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

Always run `make test && make lint` before committing. Development is strict TDD: write a failing test first.

## Architecture

Request flow and layering (each layer is a separate package; understanding the request path requires all of them):

```
cmd/cinc-server-ng (flag parsing)
  └─ server.New(Options)            server/        — bootstraps store+admin+orgs, wires middleware
       authMiddleware               server/auth.go — verifies Mixlib signature (skipped if DisableAuth),
         └─ withAPIVersion          internal/api   — stores the actor in ctx via api.WithActor
              └─ authzMiddleware     (api, only when EnforceACL) — ACL/group enforcement
                   └─ withJSONErrors (api) — converts unrouted 404/405 to JSON
                        └─ mux       internal/api/api.go — http.ServeMux, one handler set per resource
```

- **`internal/store`** — the only state. `Store` holds a global space (collections `users`, `organizations`) plus per-org `Org`s. `Org.data` is `collection -> key -> raw JSON []byte` (e.g. `nodes`, `roles`, `acls`, `groups`, `association_users`); `Org.blobs` is `checksum -> bytes` (cookbook file store). Values are stored as canonical JSON so payloads round-trip exactly. Methods: `Get/Put/Create/Delete/Keys`, `PutBlob/Blob/HasBlob/DeleteBlob`.
- **`internal/api`** — all HTTP handlers, one file per resource (`nodes`/generic in `object.go`, `cookbooks.go`, `databags.go`, `policies.go`, `acl.go`, `authz.go`, `association*.go`, `search.go`, `keys.go`, `server_endpoints.go`, …). `api.Handler()` builds the mux; `register<Resource>Routes` registers each.
- **`internal/auth`** — Mixlib signed-header verification/signing (protocol 1.0/1.1/1.3), verified against the real gem.
- **`internal/search`** — in-process Solr-style query engine + Chef document flattener (no external search engine).
- **`internal/repo`** — loads an on-disk chef-repo (objects, data bags, cookbook dirs) into an org at startup.

## Conventions

- **Errors are always JSON.** Use `writeError(w, status, msg...)` → `{"error":[...]}`; never `http.Error`. Responses use `writeJSON` / `writeRaw` (`respond.go`). The `withJSONErrors` catch-all guarantees even unrouted 404/405 are JSON.
- **Handler shape:** `org := a.org(w, r)` (writes 404 and returns nil if the org is missing); read path params with `r.PathValue(...)`; resolve the actor (when needed) from context.
- **Authorization gating is opt-in at the api/server layer** (the `EnforceACL` option / `authz_enforce.go`; the library zero value is permissive), but the standalone `cinc-server-ng` binary enforces by default (`--enforce-acls=false` to opt out; `--no-auth` implies off). When enforcing, object creation grants the creator full control via a per-object ACL (`writeCreatorACL`) and a registered client joins the org's `clients` group (`addClientToOrgGroup`) which has create on the nodes container — mirroring real Chef so the standard chef-client bootstrap works. The bootstrap admin (`pivotal`) is a superuser. Don't assume enforcement in handlers.
- **API version negotiation** runs ahead of routing (`withAPIVersion`, `server_endpoints.go`): non-numeric `X-Ops-Server-API-Version` → 400, out-of-range → 406.
- **README prose uses no em dashes.** Use a colon, comma, or parentheses instead. (This applies to `README.md` only, not to code comments or other docs.)
