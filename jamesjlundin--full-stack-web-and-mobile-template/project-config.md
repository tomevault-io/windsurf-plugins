# AGENTS.md

This is the operating manual for AI agents working in this repository.

## Project Snapshot

- **Monorepo**: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces
- **Language**: TypeScript everywhere (strict mode)
- **Apps**: `apps/web` (Next.js 16), `apps/mobile` (React Native bare)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM, Neon serverless compatible
- **Auth**: Better Auth (sessions for web, JWT for mobile)
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI
- **Rate Limiting**: Upstash Redis
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions → migrations → Vercel deploy hook

---

## REQUIRED: After Every Code Change

**ALWAYS run these commands after making changes:**

```bash
pnpm typecheck                    # TypeScript check
pnpm lint                         # ESLint check
pnpm format                       # Format code
```

**Do NOT skip this step.** CI will fail if these checks don't pass.

---

## Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm install                      # Install all dependencies
pnpm dev                          # Run all apps in parallel
pnpm -C apps/web dev              # Run web only
pnpm db:up                        # Start local PostgreSQL (Docker)

# Quality
pnpm typecheck                    # TypeScript check all packages
pnpm lint                         # ESLint all packages
pnpm eslint . --fix               # Auto-fix lint issues
pnpm format                       # Format all files

# Database
pnpm -C packages/db migrate:generate  # Generate migration from schema changes
pnpm -C packages/db migrate:apply     # Apply migrations

# Testing
pnpm test:e2e                     # Run Playwright E2E tests
pnpm test:integration             # Run integration tests (needs web running)
pnpm -C apps/mobile test          # Mobile unit tests
```

## Key Facts

- Web app runs on **port 3000** by default
- Vercel deploys may fail on pnpm version mismatches — check `packageManager` field in package.json matches the lock file version

## Do/Don't Rules

### DO

- Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` before committing
- Use workspace packages (`@acme/*`) for shared code
- Add rate limiting to new API endpoints via `@acme/security`
- Use Drizzle schema in `packages/db/src/schema.ts` for DB changes
- Follow existing patterns in each package
- **Build new features for BOTH web and mobile** — plan and implement for both platforms before considering a feature complete

### DON'T

- Don't commit `.env` files (use `.env.example` for templates)
- Don't add secrets to code; use environment variables
- Don't bypass rate limiting in production code
- Don't create new packages without clear justification
- Don't mix web-only code into shared packages
- **Don't build features for only one platform** — all user-facing features must work on both web and mobile
- **Don't fix bugs on only one platform** — when fixing a bug, always check if the same issue exists on the other platform

## Workflow Defaults

1. Make small, focused changes
2. Run tests before submitting
3. Explain non-obvious changes in commit messages
4. Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
5. Follow existing code patterns in each package

## Routing Index

Open reference docs **only when relevant** to your current task:

| If working on...              | Open...                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Package structure, data flows | `docs/ai/ARCHITECTURE.md`      |
| Adding/running tests          | `docs/ai/TESTING.md`           |
| Auth logic, sessions, JWT     | `packages/auth/src/index.ts`   |
| Database schema, migrations   | `packages/db/src/schema.ts`    |
| AI prompts, streaming         | `packages/ai/src/`             |
| API endpoints                 | `apps/web/app/api/`            |
| CI/CD pipeline                | `.github/workflows/`           |
| Mobile native code            | `apps/mobile/ios/`, `android/` |

.github/workflows/
  ci.yml               # PR checks: typecheck, lint, build, tests
  deploy.yml           # Main branch: migrations → Vercel deploy
  ios-testflight.yml   # iOS TestFlight upload
```

## Code Style

- **Prettier**: single quotes, semicolons, 100 char width, trailing commas
- **ESLint**: import ordering (alphabetized, grouped), no unused imports
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types/components
