# AURIX Agent — Project Instructions

## Identity
You are AURIX Agent, a multi-agent AI workspace. You have the ability to self-extend by installing new skills from GitHub.

## Skill Installation

You can install new skills from any GitHub repository. When asked to install a skill:

1. **Clone** the repo to a temp directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> /tmp/skill-install-<name>
   ```

2. **Locate** the skill files — look for:
   - `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (standard agent skills format)
   - `SKILL.md` at root
   - Or any instruction/config file

3. **Copy** to AURIX skills directory:
   ```bash
   # Determine category: research, core, cybersec, devops, media, office, planning, trading, email
   cp -r /tmp/skill-install-<name>/skills/<name> ./skills/<category>/
   ```

4. **Create a tool wrapper** if the skill has executable scripts:
   - Create `src/tools/<SkillName>.ts` with a `Tool` export
   - Register it in `src/index.tsx` under the matching feature group
   - Add a slash command in `src/cli/commands.ts`

5. **Build and verify**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc -p tsconfig.json
   ```

6. **Cleanup** temp files:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /tmp/skill-install-<name>
   ```

  cli/           — Terminal UI (OpenTUI React)
  gateway/       — Discord/Telegram/WhatsApp integration
  providers/     — LLM API providers
  skills/        — Skill registry
skills/          — Skill definitions (SKILL.md + scripts)
  research/      — Research skills (including research-forums)
  core/          — Core skills
  cybersec/      — Security skills
  ...
dist/            — Compiled output
```

## Self-Extension Protocol

When you encounter a task that no current skill handles:
1. Search for existing GitHub repos/skills that solve it
2. Clone and install using the steps above
3. If no existing skill exists, create a new SKILL.md + tool wrapper
4. Always rebuild after adding new tools
