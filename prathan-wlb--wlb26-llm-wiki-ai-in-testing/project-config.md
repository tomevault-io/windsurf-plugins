# LLM Wiki — Software Testing & AI

This vault is a persistent, compounding knowledge base on the domain of **Software Testing and AI**. The LLM maintains all files under `wiki/`. The human curates sources and guides exploration. Sources under `sources/` are immutable.

---

## Directory Structure

```
sources/          Raw source material — articles, papers, PDFs, transcripts. Never modified.
wiki/
  _index.md       Master index: overview, key themes, all page links organized by category.
  _log.md         Ingest log: one entry per session, date + what was processed + what changed.
  concepts/       Core ideas and techniques (e.g., mutation testing, LLM-based test gen, evals).
  tools/          Tools, frameworks, and libraries (e.g., pytest, Codium, DeepEval, Hypothesis).
  papers/         Paper and article summaries. One file per source.
  people/         Key researchers and practitioners.
  companies/      Companies and products in this space.
  synthesis/      Cross-cutting analysis: comparisons, open questions, evolving thesis pages.

## Domain Scope

This wiki covers two intersecting axes:

**Axis 1 — AI for Testing**: applying AI/ML techniques to improve software testing.
- LLM-based test generation and completion
- AI-driven fuzzing and property-based testing
- Autonomous bug detection and triage
- Self-healing test suites
- Test development
- Test execution
- Defect management
- Technical skills
- Soft skills
- Automations Testing Tools

**Axis 2 — Testing for AI**: evaluating and validating AI/ML systems.
- LLM evaluation frameworks (evals)
- Benchmarking and leaderboards
- Testing for hallucination, safety, and alignment
- Reliability and regression testing for model updates

Pages may be tagged with one or both axes using the `axis` frontmatter field.

## Page Conventions

### Frontmatter (all pages)

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
type: concept | tool | paper | person | company | synthesis
axis: ai-for-testing | testing-for-ai | both
tags: [comma, separated, tags]
related: [[Page One]], [[Page Two]]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD

```

### Concepts (`wiki/concepts/`)

Structure:
1. **One-line definition** — what it is, plainly stated
2. **Why it matters** — significance in the domain
3. **How it works** — mechanism, key ideas
4. **Variants and nuances** — notable subtypes or edge cases
5. **Current state** — where the field is on this (nascent / active / mature)
6. **Open questions** — unresolved debates or gaps
7. **Related** — links to other concept, tool, and paper pages

### Tools (`wiki/tools/`)

Structure:
1. **What it does** — one-line purpose
2. **How it works** — architecture / approach
3. **Strengths**
4. **Limitations / critiques**
5. **Compared to** — explicit comparison links
6. **Who uses it** — target users, adoption signals
7. **Status** — active / archived / experimental
8. **Related** — links

### Papers (`wiki/papers/`)

Structure:
1. **Citation** — authors, venue, year, URL if available
2. **Core claim** — the central thesis in 1-2 sentences
3. **Key contributions** — bullet list
4. **Method** — how they did it
5. **Results** — key numbers or findings
6. **Limitations** — what they acknowledge or what's missing
7. **My take** — synthesis commentary (where does this fit, is it credible, what does it change)
8. **Related** — links

### People (`wiki/people/`)

Structure:
1. **Role / affiliation**
2. **Known for** — key contributions or positions
3. **Key works** — links to paper pages

2. **Product(s)** — links to tool pages where applicable
3. **Axis** — which side of the domain they're on
4. **Stage / status** — startup / public / acquired / defunct
5. **Notable** — funding, customers, controversies
6. **Related** — links

### Synthesis (`wiki/synthesis/`)

Free-form. Used for:
- Comparison tables (e.g., "LLM test gen tools compared")
- Open questions and research gaps
- The evolving thesis on how this domain is developing
- Answers to complex questions worth preserving

## Workflows

### Ingest a Source

When the user says "ingest [source]" or drops a file in `sources/`:

1. **Read** the source fully.
2. **Discuss** with the user: What are the 3-5 key takeaways? Anything surprising or that contradicts existing wiki pages?
3. **Write a paper/article summary page** in `wiki/papers/` (filename: slugified title).
4. **Update or create concept pages** for any significant idea touched. Check existing pages first — update rather than duplicate.
5. **Update or create tool/company/person pages** for any entities mentioned significantly.
6. **Update `wiki/_index.md`** — add new pages to the catalog tables with a one-line summary; update Key Themes if the source shifts the overall picture; increment `page_count` and `source_count` in frontmatter.
7. **Append to `wiki/_log.md`** — use the format `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Source Title`, then list pages created/updated and any contradictions found.
