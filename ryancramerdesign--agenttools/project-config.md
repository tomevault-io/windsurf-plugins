# AgentTools

AgentTools is a ProcessWire module that gives AI coding agents CLI access to the
ProcessWire API and provides a database migration system for transferring changes
across environments.

## API variable

The module registers `$at` as a ProcessWire API variable (`wire('at')`).

## CLI commands

Run from the ProcessWire root directory (where `index.php` lives):

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `php index.php --at-eval 'CODE'` | Evaluate a PHP expression with full PW API access |
| `echo 'CODE' \| php index.php --at-stdin` | Evaluate multi-line PHP code from stdin |
| `php index.php --at-migrations-apply` | Apply all pending migrations |
| `php index.php --at-migrations-list` | List migrations and their status |
| `php index.php --at-migrations-test` | Preview pending without applying |
| `php index.php --at-sitemap-generate` | Generate a JSON site map to `site/assets/at/site-map.json` |
| `php index.php --at-sitemap-generate-schema` | Generate a schema JSON to `site/assets/at/site-map-schema.json` |
| `php index.php --at-cli` | Open an interactive agent CLI session |
| `php index.php --at-engineer "REQUEST"` | Ask the Engineer a question or request a change |
| `php index.php --at-engineer-migrate "REQUEST"` | Have the Engineer create a migration; outputs the migration file path |

## Getting oriented on a new site

If you are working on a site for the first time, run:
```
php index.php --at-sitemap-generate
```
Then read `site/assets/at/site-map.json` to get a complete picture of the site's
templates, fields, page tree, and installed modules before making any changes.

If you need full field/template configuration details (type-specific field settings,
per-template field context overrides, all template settings), also run:
```
php index.php --at-sitemap-generate-schema
```
Then read `site/assets/at/site-map-schema.json`. The file contains a `_readme` key
at the top level with instructions on how to interpret the schema — read it before
using the data. This schema is particularly useful when generating migrations that
depend on existing field or template configuration.

## Migrations

Migration files live in `site/assets/at/migrations/` and are named:
`YYYYMMDDhhmmss_description.php`

The applied migrations registry is stored in the database (AgentTools module config),
so it is never overwritten by rsync or file transfers.

Migrations can also be applied from the ProcessWire admin at **Setup > Agent Tools**.


## Engineer (admin UI and CLI)

The ProcessAgentTools module provides a browser-based Engineer at **Setup > Agent Tools > Engineer**.
It connects to an AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) and gives it
four tools: `eval_php`, `save_migration`, `site_info` (fetches page tree or schema on demand), and
`api_docs` (discovers and retrieves ProcessWire API.md documentation on demand). The Engineer
supports multi-turn conversation memory within a session.

The Engineer is also available from the command line, which allows AI agents to spawn a
ProcessWire-specialist sub-agent without needing to understand ProcessWire themselves:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `php index.php --at-engineer "REQUEST"` | Ask the Engineer a question or request a change |
| `php index.php --at-engineer-migrate "REQUEST"` | Have the Engineer create a migration; outputs the migration file path |

Optional flags (placed before the request string):

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--model=N` | Use agent at index N (0 = primary) as configured in module settings |
| `--readonly` | Allow queries only; the Engineer cannot create migrations |
| `--verbose` | Write tool call names to stderr as they execute |

The Engineer responds in plain text (stdout). Errors are written to stderr. When a migration is
created, the response is followed by a `Migration: /full/path/to/file.php` line, making it easy
to capture the file path for further processing.

**Example — querying site data:**
```
php index.php --at-engineer "How many published pages does this site have?"
```

**Example — creating a migration and capturing its path:**
```
migration=$(php index.php --at-engineer-migrate "Add a text field called subtitle to the blog-post template" | grep "^Migration:" | cut -d' ' -f2)
```
