# AGENTIC DIRECTIVE

> Keep AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md identical.

## CODING ENVIRONMENT

- Install astral uv using "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh" if not already installed and if already installed then update it to the latest version
- Install Python 3.14.0 stable using `uv python install 3.14.0` if not already installed (requires uv >=0.9; see `[tool.uv] required-version` in `pyproject.toml`)
- Always use `uv run` to run files instead of the global `python` command.
- Current uv ruff formatter is set to py314 which has supports multiple exception types without paranthesis (except TypeError, ValueError:)
- Read `.env.example` for environment variables.
- All CI checks must pass; failing checks block merge.
- Add tests for new changes (including edge cases).
- Before pushing, prefer `./scripts/ci.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `.\scripts\ci.ps1` (Windows) to run the local CI sequence; requires `uv` on PATH. The local scripts run Ruff in repair mode (`ruff format`, then `ruff check --fix`) before type checking and tests.
- Use `--only` / `--skip` (PowerShell: `-Only` / `-Skip`) to run a subset when iterating; use `--dry-run` to print commands without running them.
- GitHub CI remains check-only for Ruff (`ruff format --check`, `ruff check`) so branch protection verifies committed code.
- Fall back to individual repair commands when debugging local failures: `uv run ruff format`, `uv run ruff check --fix`, `uv run ty check`, `uv run pytest -v --tb=short`. Use GitHub-style checks only when verifying enforcement locally: `uv run ruff format --check`, `uv run ruff check`.
- Do not add `# type: ignore` or `# ty: ignore`; fix the underlying type issue.
- Do not add `from __future__ import annotations`; Python 3.14 native lazy annotations are the project standard.
- All 5 check IDs are represented in `scripts/ci.sh` / `scripts/ci.ps1` and enforced in `tests.yml` on push/merge (parallel jobs: suppression grep, ruff-format, ruff-check, ty, pytest).
- GitHub CI runs on `push`, `pull_request`, and `merge_group` so required checks validate merge queue candidates before they land.
- Repository protection should use rulesets: a non-bypassable main integrity ruleset requires pull requests, merge queue, required checks, and blocks direct/force pushes to `main`; a separate review ruleset may allow `Alishahryar1`/admins to bypass review only.
- Required status checks: set **required status checks** to **all** of those statuses (e.g. **Ban suppressions and legacy annotations**, **ruff-format**, **ruff-check**, **ty**, **pytest**—use the exact labels GitHub shows, which may be prefixed with **CI /**). Remove **ci** from required checks if it was previously added for the old gate job.

## IDENTITY & CONTEXT

- You are an expert Software Architect and Systems Engineer.
- Goal: Zero-defect, root-cause-oriented engineering for bugs; test-driven engineering for new features. Think carefully; no need to rush.
- Code: Write the simplest code possible. Keep the codebase minimal and modular.

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

- **Shared utilities**: Put shared Anthropic protocol logic in neutral `src/my_claude_code/core/anthropic/` modules. Do not have one provider import from another provider's utils.
- **Failure ownership**: Keep canonical failure semantics and redaction SDK-free in `core/`; providers alone classify SDK/HTTP failures and own retries; protocol/API adapters alone choose wire error types and commit-boundary serialization.
- **DRY**: Extract shared base classes to eliminate duplication. Prefer composition over copy-paste.
- **Encapsulation**: Use accessor methods for internal state (e.g. `set_current_task()`), not direct `_attribute` assignment from outside.
- **Provider-specific config**: Keep provider-specific fields (e.g. `nim_settings`) in provider constructors, not in the base `ProviderConfig`.
- **Model-independent reasoning**: Resolve client reasoning intent once at the application boundary; provider adapters translate documented provider capabilities. Never branch on upstream model names or versions to choose reasoning behavior.
- **Dead code**: Remove unused code, legacy systems, and hardcoded values. Use settings/config instead of literals (e.g. `settings.provider_type` not `"nvidia_nim"`).
- **Performance**: Use list accumulation for strings (not `+=` in loops), cache env vars at init, prefer iterative over recursive when stack depth matters.
- **Platform-agnostic naming**: Use generic names (e.g. `PLATFORM_EDIT`) not platform-specific ones (e.g. `TELEGRAM_EDIT`) in shared code.
- **No type ignores**: Do not add `# type: ignore` or `# ty: ignore`. Fix the underlying type issue.
- **Python 3.14 annotations**: Do not use `from __future__ import annotations`; rely on native lazy annotations and fix circular import boundaries instead of hiding them with annotation stringization.
- **Imports**: Prefer top-level imports. Avoid `TYPE_CHECKING` and local imports for first-party or required dependencies; if a top-level import creates a cycle, move shared types/protocols to a neutral owner.
- **Complete migrations**: When moving modules, update imports to the new owner and remove old compatibility shims in the same change unless preserving a published interface is explicitly required.
