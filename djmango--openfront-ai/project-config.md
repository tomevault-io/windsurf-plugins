# Showcase / gameplay clip preferences

When producing watch episodes, client replay videos, or demo footage for the
agent (ppo_v11 / oftrain `--watch` / `render_client_replay.py` / `ofshowcase`):

## Maps

- **Do not** make every clip Onion. The owner does not like Onion-only showcases.
- Use a **variety of maps** across clips (e.g. Europe, Pangaea, NorthAmerica,
  World, Asia, Britannia, GreatLakes, BlackSea, … from `V10_BROAD_MAPS`).
- Prefer distinct maps when rendering multiple lobby sizes (2n / 4n / 8n) in one
  batch — one map per clip, not the same map repeated.
- Onion may remain in the training curriculum pool; it is fine as one map among
  many. It must not be the default or the only map for human-facing clips.
- `ofhub` `showcase_maps()` excludes Onion from the showcase clip/hub pool.

## Watch / sampling (critical)

- **Stochastic only — never greedy.** Demos and showcase must match train
  rollouts / WR windows (`--watch-stochastic=true`, the oftrain default).
  Greedy argmax freezes near spawn (~52 tiles) and dies. Do not pass
  `--watch-stochastic=false`, `--greedy`, or `PLAY_GREEDY=1` for human-facing
  clips. We do not do greedy anymore.
- **Tick budget:** use the shared train default (`DEFAULT_MAX_EPISODE_TICKS` =
  21000) so episodes run to the same horizon as training. Do not silently
  lower it (e.g. 12000) or episodes look "cut short".
- **Decision ticks:** watch must use the stage's `decision_ticks` (V10 is
  **15 everywhere**). Do not invent a different cadence than train.
- **Engine:** `--engine node` for watches/clips/replays so the GameRecord is
  produced by the same TS sim the client replays (avoids native↔TS desync).
  Training stays `--engine native`. Pass `--engine native` on watch only for
  parity debug.
- **Lobby density:** for "current stage" clips, use that stage's bots/nations
  from `V10_BOT_NATION_DENSITY` (and the stage difficulty). Do not hardcode a
  stale lobby. Asking for 4n/8n while the policy is still on 2n is
  out-of-distribution — expect more deaths; prefer curriculum rows that
  actually have those nation counts and say so.
- **One watch, one record.** Do not seed-hunt for timeout/win. Death / timeout /
  win are all valid native outcomes — ship what the policy did.

## Rendering

- Prefer **real NVIDIA GPU** WebGL (full Chromium + Xvfb + ANGLE/Vulkan). Do not
  ship SoftGL/SwiftShader clips when a GPU is available (`OF_REFUSE_SOFTGL=1`).
- Client `gameID` must be exactly 8 alphanumeric chars (`GAME_ID_REGEX`).
- Omit `"winner": null` in GameRecords (Zod WinnerSchema is optional, not nullable).
- `gameMap` must be the OpenFront `GameMapType` *value* (e.g. `"North America"`),
  not the Rust PascalCase id (`NorthAmerica`). `render_client_replay.py`
  rewrites this during sanitize.
- **Outcome labels come from the Node watch** (`win` / `death` / `timeout`).
  Client replay must agree: if the browser shows You Died / another winner on
  a win or timeout record, **fail the render** — do not dismiss and ship a
  mismatched video. Win clips must show a You-Won modal at `end_tick`.

## Watch scripts

- `showcase-clips/run_watches.sh` — density demos (2n/4n/8n), distinct maps.
- `showcase-clips/run_progress_watches.sh` — current / next / +10 / first Medium.
Both pin train-matched tick flags. Follow that pattern for ad-hoc requests.
