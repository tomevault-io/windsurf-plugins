# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

twig is a Go CLI tool that simplifies git worktree workflows by automating
related operations (branch creation, symlinks, etc.) in a single command.

## Project Structure

```txt
cmd/twig/         # CLI entrypoint (uses cobra)
internal/testutil/  # Test mocks for FileSystem and GitExecutor
*.go (root)      # Core library: commands, config, abstractions
```

- `cmd/twig`: CLI layer. Parses arguments and delegates to library.
- Root package (`twig`): Business logic as reusable library.
  - Command structs (e.g., `AddCommand`) with injected dependencies
  - `Config`: Configuration loading from TOML files
  - Abstraction interfaces (`FileSystem`, `GitExecutor`) for testability
- `internal/testutil`: Mock implementations for unit testing

## Architecture

### CLI Layer (cmd/twig/)

- Cobra framework with RunE pattern
- No business logic - delegates to root package
- Loads config and calls command structs

### Command Pattern

Each subcommand is a struct with injected dependencies (e.g., `AddCommand`):

- Holds `FS`, `Git`, `Config`, `Stdout`, `Stderr` as fields
- Constructor (e.g., `NewAddCommand(cfg)`) provides production defaults
- `Run()` method executes business logic

### Git Abstraction

Two-level design for testability:

- `GitExecutor` interface: minimal `Run(args...) ([]byte, error)`
- `GitRunner`: high-level operations (WorktreeAdd, LocalBranchExists, etc.)
- Directory injected to executor for CWD-independent execution

### FileSystem Abstraction

- `FileSystem` interface: `Stat`, `Symlink`, `IsNotExist`, `Glob`, `MkdirAll`
- `osFS` struct: production implementation wrapping os package

### Configuration

- TOML format with BurntSushi/toml
- Two-tier: `.twig/settings.toml` (project) + `settings.local.toml` (local)
- Graceful handling of missing files

## Design Principles

- Flat package structure: avoid deep nesting, keep packages at root level
- Prefer lower implementation cost over performance optimization (aiming for minimal package)
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Add complexity only when necessary

## Common Commands

```bash
make build                        # Build binary to out/twig
go test ./...                     # Run unit tests
go test -tags=integration ./...   # Run integration tests
```

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions and idioms
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Error handling: return errors rather than panicking
- Naming: use camelCase for unexported, PascalCase for exported identifiers

## Git Commit

- Use Conventional Commits format
- Example: `feat: add new feature`, `fix: resolve bug`, `docs: update README`

## Claude Code Plugin Maintenance

When updating files under `external/claude-code/plugins/twig/`:

- Update the `version` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Analyze the change to determine the appropriate version bump:
  - Even document changes may introduce new agent behaviors or operations
  - If the change adds new capabilities (new commands, new response patterns),
    treat as minor
  - If the change removes or fundamentally alters existing behavior, treat as
    major
  - Only pure fixes (typos, clarifications without behavior change) are patch

## Plugin Local Debug

To test a plugin from a local branch before merging to main:

```bash
# 1. Register current directory as a local marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add "$(pwd)" --scope local

# 2. Install the plugin
claude plugin install <plugin-name>@twig-plugins --scope local

# 3. Restart the session (hooks are loaded at startup)

# 4. Test the plugin behavior

# 5. Cleanup: uninstall plugin and remove local marketplace
claude plugin uninstall <plugin-name>@twig-plugins --scope local
claude plugin marketplace remove twig-plugins

# 6. Re-add the GitHub marketplace (local override replaces it)
claude plugin marketplace add 708u/twig
```

Note: `marketplace add` with a local path overrides the existing
marketplace of the same name. Always re-add the GitHub source
after removing the local override.
