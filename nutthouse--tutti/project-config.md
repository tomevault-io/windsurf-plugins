# Tutti — Project Conventions

## Language & Tooling
- Rust (stable), single crate, binary name `tt`
- No async in Phase 1 — all tmux interaction is synchronous `std::process::Command`
- Dependencies: clap (derive), serde + toml, thiserror, comfy-table, colored, chrono, which

## Architecture
- `src/cli/` — Clap command handlers, one file per subcommand
- `src/config/` — TOML config types and parsing (includes role mapping + `[roles]` table)
- `src/runtime/` — RuntimeAdapter trait + per-runtime implementations
- `src/session/` — tmux session management wrappers
- `src/worktree/` — Git worktree lifecycle
- `src/state/` — .tutti/ directory and agent state persistence
- `src/template/` — Template pack parsing, generation, repo detection, and built-in templates
- `src/automation/` — Workflow execution engine, artifact pipeline, artifact-polling mode
- `src/permissions/` — Claude Code settings generation and shell policy shims
- `src/error.rs` — Central error types via thiserror

## Naming
- Musical terminology: voices (running agents), arrangements (configs), movements (phases), phrases (prompts)
- tmux sessions: `tutti-{team}-{agent}`
- Git branches for worktrees: `tutti/{agent}`
- State files: `.tutti/state/{agent}.json`

## Testing
- Unit tests in each module (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`)
- Integration tests that need tmux should check for its presence first
- Use `tempfile` or `std::env::temp_dir()` for filesystem tests

## Error Handling
- All public functions return `Result<T, TuttiError>`
- Use `thiserror` for error variants, not anyhow
- User-facing errors should include actionable guidance

## Style
- `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` must pass (CI enforced)
- Prefer explicit imports over glob imports
- Keep functions focused — if it's doing two things, split it

## Code Review (CodeRabbit)
- CodeRabbit is configured as a required reviewer on PRs
- When it finds issues, it submits a "Request changes" review to block merging
- Once all CodeRabbit comments are resolved and pre-merge checks pass, it automatically switches to "Approve"
- Do not manually dismiss CodeRabbit reviews — fix the issues and let it re-review
- PRs are only mergeable when CodeRabbit approves AND all CI checks are green

## Dogfooding
- This project uses itself (`tt`) to orchestrate development — tutti developing tutti
- When a tutti feature doesn't work during a dogfood run, **fix the framework** (the `tt` command / runtime / session code), don't work around it by doing the task manually
- Always validate the fix by re-running the original orchestration flow through `tt`
- The purpose of dogfood runs is to surface real bugs in tutti's agent orchestration, not to ship the target feature by any means necessary

## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.
