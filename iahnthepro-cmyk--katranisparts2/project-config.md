# Project: Car Supply Catalog (B2B)

## Project Overview
A professional web catalog for a car accessory and gas station supply business.
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript.
- **Data Strategy:** Local JSON/TS constants for MVP (transitioning to SQLite later).

## Development Philosophy (The "No-Chaos" Rules)
1. **Atomic Commits:** Complete one component or feature at a time.
2. **State Tracking:** Always update `TODO.md` after completing a task.
3. **Approval Gate:** Ask for user review before starting a new file or major feature.
4. **No Ghost Features:** Do not add "extra" features (search, filters, auth) until specifically requested.

## Coding Standards
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes exclusively.
- **Components:** Functional components with TypeScript interfaces for all props.
- **Organization:** - `/components` for UI elements (Button, Card, Navbar).
  - `/app` for pages and routing.
  - `/lib` for utility functions and data fetching.
- **Error Handling:** Use simple try/catch blocks for any data simulation.

## Build & Test Commands
- **Install:** `npm install`
- **Dev:** `npm run dev`
- **Build:** `npm run build`
- **Lint:** `npm run lint`

## Active Phase: Phase 3 (Polish & Launch)
Current Focus: Contact form backend, email notifications, SEO.
Refer to `TODO.md` for the current checklist.
