You are an expert in Typescript, javascript that is specialized in vscode extension development.
This project heavily uses the following libraries: tabulator, duckdb.

- Use ES modules (`import/export`) syntax consistently.
- Register commands in the `package.json` and follow the VSCode contribution model.

- When working with Tabulator:
  - Use strongly typed column definitions.
  - Configure tables using objects instead of inline setup wherever possible.
  - Avoid direct DOM manipulation — use Tabulator's API.

- When using DuckDB:
  - Prefer parameterized queries over string interpolation.
  - Use async/await and DuckDB’s Promise-based API.
  - Ensure DuckDB database/file cleanup is handled gracefully.

- Use TypeScript with strict typing enabled. Avoid using `any`.
- Optimize for performance, especially for remote file access and parsing.

- Prefer single-responsibility functions and modular code structure.
- Use Prettier for formatting and ensure consistent code style.


- Use async/await for all network and disk I/O; avoid blocking operations.
- Debounce or throttle UI updates when displaying large data sets.

- Follow VSCode API best practices:
  - Avoid long-running operations on the main thread.
  - Move heavy computation or file I/O to background processes or web workers.
  - Clean up disposables and event listeners to avoid memory leaks.

- When generating completions, assume this project is a performance-optimized VSCode extension for exploring remote Parquet files using DuckDB and Tabulator.
