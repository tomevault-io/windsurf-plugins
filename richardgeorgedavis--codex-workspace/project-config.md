# AGENTS.md

## Scope

These instructions apply to Codex Workspace and `repos/workspace-hub` unless a
deeper repo-specific `AGENTS.md` overrides them.

For first-time repo intake, use `docs/09-new-repo-baseline.md`.

## Priorities

Maintain a clean, high-performance mixed-repo workspace.

Prefer:

- clear structure
- independently runnable repos
- shared caches, not shared installs
- direct local dev servers for frontend/WebGL projects
- optional proxy or mapped-host tooling only when it adds value
- pragmatic WordPress handling, usually through Local for existing sites

Never create one shared `node_modules` or equivalent install directory across
unrelated repos.

## Workspace Shape

Expected top-level folders:

- `docs/`
- `repos/`
- `tools/`
- `cache/`
- `shared/`

Use:

- `docs/` for canonical workspace docs and handover
- `.workspace/project.json` for per-repo runtime metadata
- `tools/templates/` for starter templates
- `shared/` for durable workspace metadata
- `cache/` for generated summaries, runtime artifacts, and shared stores

## Token Budget

Keep agent context small by default.

Do not load or summarize these unless the task explicitly needs them:

- `docs/archive/`
- repo `ref/`
- repo `screenshots/`
- `cache/`
- generated reports, large copied HTML, archives, lockfiles, vendor/build output

For fresh context, read:

1. this file
2. `docs/HANDOVER.md`
3. the relevant repo README, handover, manifest, or source files
4. generated `cache/context/.../entry.md` only if useful

Avoid broad historical docs and deep/artifact search by default.

## Workspace Hub

For `repos/workspace-hub`, prefer:

- readable modular code
- explicit runtime/process handling
- conservative repo classification
- graceful status and failure messages
- existing patterns over new abstractions

Avoid:

- assuming all repos use the same package manager
- assuming proxy mode is better than direct local preview
- hard-coding unstable absolute paths beyond the workspace root
- hidden auto-installs or heavy setup steps

When no manifest exists, classify cautiously:

- Vite, static, Three.js, and WebGL repos default to `direct`
- WordPress projects already managed elsewhere default to `external`

## Workspace Memory

The previous workspace memory service has been removed.

Do not add background memory hooks or leave memory closeout as a manual
reminder. Record closeout in tracked docs instead.

For handover updates:

- repo-specific updates go in repo-local docs and `docs/HANDOVER.md` when relevant
- workspace-level updates go in `docs/HANDOVER.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- run `git status --short` before closing so the handover does not imply a cleaner worktree than exists
- if public docs changed, keep `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, and relevant repo-local docs aligned

## Public Agent Distribution

Root `AGENTS.md` is the canonical public agent contract, including for
TomeVault distribution. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is a standalone
Copilot summary, not the source of truth for cross-platform conversion.

When a user request appears to need a skill, check the available local skill
sources before creating, importing, or researching a new one. Start with the
current session's advertised skills, then inspect relevant workspace skill
folders such as `.agents/skills/`, `shared/skills/`,
`repos/current-builds/knowledge-foundry/knowledge/skills/`, and
`$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills` when needed. Prefer using or adapting
an existing local skill over adding another copy.

Tracked skills published for TomeVault live under `.agents/skills/` and are
mirrored from `tools/manifests/tomevault-skills.json` by
`tools/scripts/sync-tomevault-skills.sh`. Do not install TomeVault Relay, add
TomeVault badges, or commit generated multi-format TomeVault files unless that
is explicitly requested.

Whenever a skill is developed, created, updated, or saved anywhere in this
workspace, copy the final skill folder into
`repos/current-builds/knowledge-foundry/process/input/_final-skills-here/`. Use
`tools/scripts/sync-final-skills.sh` to preview the full workspace skill export
and `tools/scripts/sync-final-skills.sh --run` to refresh that Knowledge
Foundry input folder. Keep all discovered skills; do not prune a skill from the
final-skills input unless the user explicitly requests removal.
Do not rediscover or resync generated Knowledge Foundry direct-skill outputs
under `process/input/_final-skills-here/`, the legacy
`process/input/skills/` alias, or process queue review folders as new source
skills; those folders are sync/import artifacts and are intentionally ignored
by the sync wrapper.

## Upstream Updates

When asked to update reviewed GitHub refs or managed upstream mirrors, use:

- `tools/scripts/manage-workspace-capabilities.sh` for abilities and core services
- `tools/scripts/update-github-refs.sh` for dry runs or applied updates

Do not refresh those sources by hand when a wrapper covers the flow.
