# Rust Conventions (Service Development)

Apply these rules if the backend is Rust under `core/`.

## Structure

- Keep HTTP/gRPC handlers thin.
- Put business logic in `service/` with dependency injection via traits.
- Keep domain models in `domain/` with validation and invariants.
- Repositories provide persistence behind mockable traits.

## Error Handling

- Use typed errors for business logic (`thiserror`), and attach context at boundaries (`anyhow` or `eyre`).
- Do not swallow errors (`ok()`/`unwrap()` in production paths).
- Prefer returning `Result<T, E>` from functions instead of side effects.

## Async

- Avoid `tokio::spawn` unless you can explain lifecycle and error handling.
- Prefer explicit timeouts at network boundaries.

## Testing

- Unit tests should not require Docker.
- Mock repositories with `mockall` and mock HTTP dependencies with `wiremock`.
- Integration/E2E tests can use docker-compose, but keep them separate from unit tests.
