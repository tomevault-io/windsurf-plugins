# Frontend Conventions (Optional)

Only apply these rules if the project has a TypeScript/React frontend under `portal/`.

## General

- Keep routes/pages thin; move logic into `portal/src/lib` or `portal/src/services`.
- Prefer explicit typing at API boundaries.
- Centralize network calls in a small API client module (do not scatter `fetch()`).
- Treat UI state changes as data-flow: inputs -> validation -> action -> result.

## Testing

- Unit tests for pure functions and components with complex logic.
- E2E tests only for critical user journeys (few, stable).

## Error Handling

- Show user-safe errors in UI.
- Log developer-facing details in console only for dev builds.
