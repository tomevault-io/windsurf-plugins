# Testing Conventions

## TDD Loop (Preferred)

1. RED: write a failing test for the next behavior.
2. GREEN: implement the smallest change to pass.
3. REFACTOR: improve design while keeping tests green.

## Test Pyramid (Platform Guidance)

- Unit tests: most of the coverage; fast; no Docker.
- Integration tests: limited; validate boundaries (DB, external APIs) when needed.
- E2E tests: few; validate critical user journeys.
- Performance tests: targeted benchmarks for latency/throughput regressions.

## Practical Rules

- Every feature plan must include: test plan + acceptance criteria.
- After implementation, generate QA docs under `docs/qa/` and treat them as the reproducible acceptance spec.
- Failures discovered in QA become tickets under `docs/ticket/` with steps + evidence + expected/actual.

## Coverage Targets (Guidance, Not Law)

- Aim for high coverage in business logic (80%+).
- Prefer meaningful assertions over chasing percentages.

## Suggested Commands (Project-Specific)

The exact commands depend on the generated project. Common patterns:

```bash
# Unit tests
cargo test
npm test

# Coverage (if configured)
cargo llvm-cov --html
npm run test -- --coverage

# E2E (if configured)
npx playwright test
```
