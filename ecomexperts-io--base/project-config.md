# Rules of Engagement

## Theme Structure

- **Keep `layout/theme.liquid` concise**: Aim for an average of 200–300 lines. Extract markup into well-named snippets and sections to keep `theme.liquid` readable and maintainable.
- **Prefer snippets for composition**: Use snippets to organize, modals, and reusable UI fragments. Avoid large monolithic blocks inside `theme.liquid`.

## JavaScript Practices

- **Prefer Custom Elements over `DOMContentLoaded`**: Do not attach logic using `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', ...)`. Instead, wrap the relevant HTML in a custom element and implement a class that extends `HTMLElement` (register it with `customElements.define`).
- **Avoid `DOMContentLoaded` entirely when possible**: Use `connectedCallback`/`disconnectedCallback` lifecycle hooks of your custom element to initialize and clean up behavior.
- **Do not use jQuery**: Never add jQuery to the codebase. Prefer native browser APIs and/or Alpine.js (already included in `theme.liquid`) for light interactivity and state.

## Formatting and Readability

- **Indent consistently**: Poorly formatted code is hard to read and maintain. Always keep indentation and spacing consistent with the project’s existing style (do not mix tabs and spaces).
- **Auto-format on save**: Use the project formatter configuration where available. If no formatter is configured, match the surrounding file’s style.

## Code Hygiene

- **Do not leave commented-out code**: Either delete unused code or re-enable it. Do not keep large commented blocks or "temporary" comments in commits.

## Quick Checklist

- `theme.liquid` is <= ~300 lines and delegates to snippets/sections
- No new uses of `DOMContentLoaded`; behavior lives in custom elements
- Custom elements extend `HTMLElement` and are registered once
- Code is consistently indented and formatted
- No commented-out code left behind
