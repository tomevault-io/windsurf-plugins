# Agent Instructions

- Scope: this is a Home Assistant custom component for FoxESS Cloud; all integration code lives in `custom_components/foxess_cloud/`. Keep README/AGENTS at the repo root up to date when behavior changes.
- Project layout:
  - `custom_components/foxess_cloud/` – Home Assistant integration code.
  - `custom_components/foxess_cloud/api_client/` – FoxESS Cloud HTTP client and Pydantic models.
  - `custom_components/foxess_cloud/profiles/` – device series profiles (series-specific entities and variable mapping).
  - `AGENTS.md` – contributor instructions and integration guidelines.
- Home Assistant patterns: async only, config-flow required, unique IDs on entities, runtime data stored on the config entry, and coordinators for polling. Strings belong in `strings.json` and `translations/`; services in `services.yaml`; update `PLATFORMS` when adding entities.
- Development notes:
  - Python 3.13+; async I/O only (`async_get_clientsession` for HTTP).
  - Keep user-facing strings in `strings.json` and translations under `translations/`.
  - Maintain config-flow setup and unique IDs when adding platforms/entities.
  - When adding platforms, update `PLATFORMS` in `const.py` and ensure setups are forwarded in `__init__.py`.
- Tooling:
  - Use `uv` for dependencies. `uv sync` to create the virtual env.
  - Lint with ruff: `uv run ruff check .` (CI runs this).
  - Typecheck with pyright: `uv run pyright` (CI runs this).
  - CLI: run with `PYTHONPATH=custom_components/foxess_cloud uv run python -m api_client.__main__ --help` (keeps Home Assistant imports out). Example: `PYTHONPATH=custom_components/foxess_cloud uv run python -m api_client.__main__ --api-key YOUR_KEY list-inverters`.
- API client rules: all FoxESS HTTP calls stay in `api_client/` behind typed methods/models. Add/extend Pydantic models (alias API field names, ignore extras), normalize inputs before calling, and keep optional fields out of payloads (`model_dump(by_alias=True, exclude_none=True)`). Respect throttling defaults and keep headers (`Token`, `Signature`, `Timestamp`, `Lang`, `Timezone`, `User-Agent`, `Connection`, `Content-Type`) intact.
- Scheduler and settings: use `SchedulerGroup`/`SchedulerSetRequest` for schedules and `SettingItem`/`SettingWriteResult` for device settings. Staging state lives on the scheduler coordinator; keep HA-facing code unaware of raw payload shapes. Service `set_schedule` must validate payloads and refresh coordinators after writes.
- Scheduler service payloads: accept only `groups` (list, may be empty to clear schedules); always overwrite inverter schedules after write.
- Docs: fetch the FoxESS OpenAPI HTML from https://www.foxesscloud.com/public/i18n/en/OpenApiDocument.html when adding endpoints. Do not commit the downloaded file; keep it locally while developing.
- Quality and testing: add tests when adding logic-heavy code; prefer pytest-style unit tests and keep fixtures small. Avoid blocking calls in the event loop.
- Style: type hints everywhere, modern Python features (dataclasses, pattern matching, f-strings). Log actionable info only (no secrets, avoid chatty debug by default).
