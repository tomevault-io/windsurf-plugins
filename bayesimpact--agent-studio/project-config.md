# No Autonomous Git Commits or Pushes

NEVER run `git commit` or `git push` (on any branch or worktree) unless the user explicitly asks for it in their message.

- Fixing a bug, a failing CI check, or completing a task is NOT implicit permission to commit or push.
- When a fix requires a commit/push to take effect (e.g. CI runs on the remote branch), stage or prepare the changes, then stop and tell the user what to commit and push.
- Instead of committing, end the response with the usual suggested commit message (`💬 Git: ...`) and let the user run the git commands themselves.
