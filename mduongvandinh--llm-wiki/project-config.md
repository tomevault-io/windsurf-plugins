## Ingest Rules (competitive-intel)

1. **Source categorization:** Tag each raw file with `competitor: "name"` in frontmatter
2. **Pricing detection:** When ingesting pricing pages, always extract into structured table in competitor page
3. **Change detection:** On re-ingest of known source, compare with existing wiki page — flag differences
4. **Job postings:** Extract open roles → add to competitor's "Job Postings Signal" section
5. **Review aggregation:** From G2, Glassdoor, Reddit reviews → add to "Known Weaknesses" with source attribution
6. **Change log:** When change detected → create `wiki/changes/YYYY-MM-DD-competitor.md`

## Change Detection Trigger Words

When ingesting, flag as change if these patterns appear vs previous state:
- Pricing: "new pricing", "price change", "now $", "starting at $", "free plan"
- Features: "launching", "new feature", "now available", "introducing", "releasing"
- Strategy: "pivoting", "focusing on", "discontinuing", "sunsetting", "acquired"
- Funding: "raised", "series", "funding", "acquired", "IPO", "merger"
