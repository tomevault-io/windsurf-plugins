# Database Storage Rule

All SQLite database files should be stored in the `db` directory at the root of the project. This includes:
- Database files (*.db)
- Database-related configuration files
- Database migration files

The path structure should be:
```
/db/
  ├── databases/
  │   ├── database1.db
  │   ├── database2.db
  │   └── ...
  ├── migrations/
  │   └── ...
  └── config/
      └── ...
```

This rule ensures consistent database file storage across the project and prevents database files from being scattered in different locations.
