# Rules for Adding/Modifying Documentation

-   **ALWAYS:** Mention in your response "**Ruleset Applied:** doc-rules.mdc" to indicate that this ruleset is in use.

## General Guidelines

-   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Write in clear, concise, and simple language. Avoid jargon or overly technical terms where possible.
-   **Accuracy:** Ensure all information provided is accurate and up-to-date. Verify technical details against the codebase.
-   **Completeness:** Provide comprehensive documentation that covers all important aspects of the topic.
-   **Consistency:** Follow consistent formatting, style, and terminology throughout the documentation.
-   **Accessibility:** Write documentation that is accessible to a wide audience, including users with disabilities.
-   **Examples:** Provide clear and relevant examples to illustrate concepts and usage.
-   **Visual Aids:** Use diagrams, flowcharts, or other visual aids where appropriate to enhance understanding.
-   **Hyperlinks:** Use hyperlinks to cross-reference related documentation or external resources.
-   **Code Examples:**
    -   Format code examples using fenced code blocks with appropriate language specifiers (e.g., \`\`\`typescript, \`\`\`javascript, \`\`\`cpp, \`\`\`java, \`\`\`python, \`\`\`rust, \`\`\`yaml, \`\`\`json, \`\`\`bash, \`\`\`mermaid).
    -   Ensure code examples are accurate, functional, and follow best practices.
    -   Include comments within code examples to explain complex logic.
    -   Use concise and meaningful variable names in examples.
    -   Avoid overly long code examples; break them down into smaller, manageable snippets when possible.
    -   Include setup or configuration steps if necessary for running the examples.
    -   Test all code examples to ensure they work as expected.
-   **Mermaid Diagrams:**
    -   Use Mermaid syntax for creating diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, etc.).
    -   Ensure diagrams are clear, well-structured, and easy to understand.
    -   Provide a text description or caption for each diagram.
    -   Keep diagrams up-to-date with any changes to the system or process being documented.
