# Workspace Notes

## Environment

- This workspace may not have `go` or `gofmt` on `PATH`. If Go validation is needed, first try the workspace-local toolchain under `.tooling/go/bin/`, for example `PATH=$PWD/.tooling/go/bin:$PATH go test ./...`.
- If `.tooling/go/bin` is unavailable, a verified fallback toolchain is installed at `$HOME/.local/go1.26.1/bin/go`; prepend `PATH=$HOME/.local/go1.26.1/bin:$PATH` for builds, tests, and `gofmt`.
- The frontend toolchain may also require a newer Node than `/usr/bin/node` provides. If Svelte/Vite startup fails on `node:util.styleText`, use `PATH=$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.1/bin:$PATH` for `vitest`, `prettier`, and other `web/` checks.
- In embedded-postgres backed tests, creating `ProjectRepo.labels` or `Agent.capabilities` via direct Ent builders currently serializes `TEXT[]` as JSON-like literals and fails with `pq: malformed array literal`. Prefer API/service paths that already normalize array input, or avoid asserting on those fields in direct Ent setup until the repository-side array encoding is fixed.
- Fresh empty databases can currently race schema migration when `openase all-in-one` starts `serve` and `orchestrate` concurrently. For local validation against a brand-new DB, pre-run one migration pass first (for example by opening the DB once through `internal/runtime/database.Open`) before launching `all-in-one`.
- `internal/webui/static/.keep` must remain tracked on clean checkouts. CI jobs like `make openapi-check` compile `internal/webui/ui.go` without first building frontend assets, and deleting the placeholder causes `go:embed all:static: no matching files found`.
- Local redeploy cleanup must identify repo-local `openase` processes by resolved `/proc/<pid>/exe`, not only by argv. Older runs may survive as `<repo-root>/bin/openase (deleted)` and keep serving stale code on `127.0.0.1:19836` until explicitly killed.
- Tests that touch `~/.openase/...` must isolate `HOME` per test run, preferably with `t.TempDir()` or a test-name-derived temp home. When parallel execution exposes cross-test contamination, fix the isolation boundary first instead of lowering concurrency to hide the problem.
- Ticket-runtime `go test` runs can inherit `OPENASE_TICKET_ID` and similar OpenASE env vars from the harness. Tests that assert missing ticket context should scrub inherited env vars explicitly instead of relying on the parent process env being empty.
- `scripts/ci/backend_coverage.sh` rewrites `HOME` to a temp directory before `make check`. In this workspace export `OPENASE_PGTEST_SHARED_ROOT=$HOME/.cache/openase/pgtest` so `internal/testutil/pgtest` reuses the extracted binaries instead of a cold temp-home cache that may miss the sibling `postgres` binary next to `initdb`.
- On the self-hosted GitHub Actions runner, `make check` can still be terminated during long quiet backend test phases even with the workflow heartbeat. Prefer `OPENASE_GO_TEST_PROGRESS_MODE=json` for backend CI jobs so `go test` emits continuous progress instead of relying on sparse wrapper heartbeats.
- `web/playwright.config.ts` currently hard-codes `127.0.0.1:4173` with `reuseExistingServer: false`. When concurrent workspaces already occupy that port, the local CI gate can fail even if the code is correct; in that case, keep the repo config unchanged and run the equivalent Playwright step with a temporary copied config on an alternate localhost port, then restore any generated `internal/webui/static` artifacts before committing.
- `scripts/dev/test_ephemeral_chat_blackbox.py` can fail against real local providers because rate limits or missing provider env vars surface before chat startup. For deterministic local validation in this workspace, prefer `python3 scripts/dev/test_ephemeral_chat_blackbox.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:19836 --provider-mode fake-codex --timeout-seconds 90`.
- This workspace currently has no X11/Wayland display server and no `xvfb-run` helper installed. Electron GUI E2E should either run on a machine with a display (or an Xvfb-wrapped CI job) or skip explicitly when `DISPLAY` / `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` are absent.
- `pnpm` in this workspace can ignore install scripts by default. If Electron is installed but its binary payload is missing, run the bundled installer directly (for example `node desktop/node_modules/electron/install.js`) before attempting Playwright or packaging flows.
- Claude Code auth can be misleading in this environment: `claude auth status` may report `loggedIn: true` while real prompt execution still fails with `401 Invalid authentication credentials`, and `claude --debug-file ... -p ...` shows OAuth refresh attempts returning `400` from `https://platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`. Current Claude builds also store OAuth metadata under `~/.claude/.credentials.json -> claudeAiOauth`, with `expiresAt` as a millisecond Unix timestamp instead of the older top-level RFC3339 fields. Before treating Claude as ready here, verify with a real `claude -p ...` prompt, not status output alone.
