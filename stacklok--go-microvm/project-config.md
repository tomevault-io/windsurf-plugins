# go-microvm

Go library + runner binary for running OCI container images as microVMs via libkrun.
Two-process model: pure-Go library spawns a CGO runner subprocess. Module: `github.com/stacklok/go-microvm`.

## Commands

```bash
task build-dev            # Build runner (requires libkrun-devel, Linux)
task build-dev-darwin     # Build runner (macOS, requires Homebrew libkrun, signs entitlements)
task build-runner         # Build runner + libs using builder container (no system libkrun needed)
task fetch-runtime        # Download pre-built runtime from GitHub Release
task fetch-firmware       # Download pre-built firmware from GitHub Release
task builder-image-build  # Build the builder container image locally
task test                 # go test -v -race ./...
task test-nocgo           # go test excluding CGO packages (used by CI)
task build-nocgo          # Verify compilation of pure Go packages
task lint                 # golangci-lint run ./...
task lint-fix             # Auto-fix lint issues
task fmt                  # go fmt + goimports
task verify               # fmt + lint + test (CI pipeline)
task tidy                 # go mod tidy
task package-runtime      # Package runtime tarball for release
task package-firmware     # Package firmware tarball for release
task clean                # Remove bin/, dist/, and coverage files
```

Run a single test: `go test -v -race -run TestName ./path/to/package`

macOS dev setup: `brew tap slp/krun && brew install libkrun libkrunfw` (see `docs/MACOS.md` for details)

## Architecture

Entry point: `microvm.go:Run()` orchestrates the full pipeline (preflight, pull, hooks, config, net, spawn, post-boot). Config via functional options in `options.go`. Returns a `*VM` handle (`vm.go`).

**CGO boundary**: Only `krun/` and `runner/cmd/go-microvm-runner/` use CGO. Everything else is pure Go. The runner binary is sacrificial -- `krun_start_enter()` never returns, so it runs in a detached subprocess.

**Key subsystems**: `hypervisor/` (Backend abstraction + libkrun impl), `image/` (OCI pull + cache), `runner/` (subprocess spawning), `net/` (Provider interface + firewall + hosted mode + egress policy + topology constants), `guest/` (guest-side boot orchestration, hardening, SSH server), `hooks/` (RootFS hook factories for key injection, file injection), `extract/` (binary bundle caching), `preflight/` (platform checks via build tags), `ssh/` (keygen + client), `state/` (flock-based JSON persistence), `internal/` (pathutil, procutil).

## Things That Will Bite You

- **CGO boundary is strict**: Only `krun/` and `runner/cmd/go-microvm-runner/` use CGO. Every other package MUST stay `CGO_ENABLED=0`. Never import `krun` from a non-CGO package.
- **Runner config is duplicated**: `runner.Config` in `runner/config.go` and a duplicate `Config` struct in `runner/cmd/go-microvm-runner/main.go`. When adding a field, update BOTH structs with the same JSON tag, then handle it in `runVM()`.
- **`krun_start_enter()` never returns**: It calls `exit()` when the guest shuts down. That's why we need the two-process model -- the runner process is sacrificial.
- **Platform build tags**: Preflight checks, resource checks, and some net code use `//go:build linux` or `//go:build darwin`. Each platform goes in a separate file. macOS preflight checks verify `kern.hv_support` sysctl and use `hw.memsize`/`syscall.Statfs` for resources.
- **Entitlements required on macOS**: `assets/entitlements.plist` has three entitlements: `com.apple.security.hypervisor`, `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`, and `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` (needed because the hypervisor entitlement activates hardened runtime, which strips DYLD_* vars). The `task build-dev-darwin` command signs automatically.
- **CGO Homebrew paths**: `krun/context.go` CGO directives include `-L/opt/homebrew/lib` and `-L/usr/local/lib` for macOS. The linker ignores nonexistent paths.
- **Tests excluding CGO packages**: When CGO isn't available, exclude krun: `CGO_ENABLED=0 go test $(go list ./... | grep -v krun | grep -v go-microvm-runner)`
- **Functional options pattern**: All public config uses `With*` constructors applying to unexported `config` struct via `optionFunc`. Follow the existing pattern in `options.go` exactly.
- **Backend abstraction**: `WithRunnerPath`, `WithLibDir`, and `WithSpawner` are NOT on the top-level `microvm` package. They live in `hypervisor/libkrun` as backend-specific options. Use `microvm.WithBackend(libkrun.NewBackend(libkrun.WithRunnerPath(...)))`. Similarly, `VM.PID()` is gone; use `VM.ID()` (returns string).

## Conventions

- **SPDX headers required**: Every `.go` and `.yaml` file needs `// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright 2025 Stacklok, Inc.` and `// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0` (use `#` for YAML).
- Use `log/slog` exclusively -- no `fmt.Println` or `log.Printf` in library code.
- Wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` forming readable chains.
- Prefer table-driven tests. Test files go alongside the code they test.
- When adding a new package, include a `doc.go` with SPDX header and ensure it doesn't import `krun`.
