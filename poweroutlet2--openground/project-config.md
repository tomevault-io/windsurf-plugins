# Openground Project Configuration

## Project Overview

Openground is a tool for extracting framework and library documentation from official sources (sitemaps and git repos) and making it queryable by AI coding agents. It consists of:

1. **RAG documentation ingestion pipeline**: Extracts documentation from sources (sitemap.xml or git repos), stores pages as structured JSON, then chunks and embeds them into a local LanceDB database.
2. **MCP server**: Exposes tools for AI agents to perform hybrid semantic and BM25 search over the documentation database.

The philosophy mandates simplicity of implementation for maintainers and ease of use for users.

## Coding Style

-   **Paradigm**: Functional programming preferred
-   **Type Hints**: Required for all functions
-   **Error Handling**: Errors must provide clear and actionable logging. Fail fast with actionable error messages.
-   **Documentation**:
    -   Concise but informative docstrings for functions
    -   Prefer self-commenting code
    -   Inline comments only for particularly confusing lines
-   **Comments**: Do not add comments that a human would not add. Do not add excessive comments. Do not add comments to parts of the code you are not working on.

## Directory Structure

Openground is a RAG pipeline tool with CLI and MCP server components.

-   **Main modules**: `cli.py`, `config.py`, `ingest.py`, `query.py`, `server.py`, `embeddings.py`, `console.py`
-   **extract/ subdirectory**: `git.py`, `source.py`, `common.py`, `sitemap.py`
-   **Configuration**: Managed via JSON config file (see `config.py`)
-   **Pipeline**: extract → embed → query (hybrid semantic + BM25 search in lancedb)

## Behavioral Rules

-   **Explanation**: Explain "why" before coding
-   **File Size**: No file size preference
-   **Comments**: Only modify existing comments when touching related code
-   **Errors**: Fail fast with actionable error messages

## Project Commands

### Development

```bash
uv run python ...             # Run commands with venv
uv run ruff check .    # Linting
uv run ty check .      # Type checking
```

### CLI Commands

Primary commands (see `cli.py` for complete list):

-   `openground add` - Extract and ingest documentation from a source
-   `openground install-mcp` - Install MCP server configuration
-   `openground config` - Manage configuration (show, set, get, reset)
-   `openground nuke` - Delete all data (raw_data and/or embeddings)
