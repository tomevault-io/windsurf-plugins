# Development notes for Claude

## Repositories

Morel has implementations in Rust and Java. The repositories are
[morel-rust](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel-rust] and
[morel-java](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel].

A common task is to propagate a change from one repository to the
other.

Read the commit message, the code changes, and especially the test
changes in `src/test/resources/script/*.smli` — those tests are
shared between the two projects, so the morel-rust test files are
the same `.smli` format and often the same content.

### Implementing the feature

Implement the feature in morel-rust. Then enable any disabled
regions by either:

- Removing the surrounding `(* ... *)` block-comment delimiters, or
- Replacing `set("mode","validate")` / `set("mode","evaluate")`
  brackets with ordinary enabled code.

### Verifying

Run `/usr/local/bin/fullMake --no-clean` and confirm it passes.

A propagation must move every changed `.smli` section literally,
adding any that do not yet exist — do not adapt or skip a section
because the implementation is hard. Gate this with
`etc/check-convergence.py HEAD`, which fails if any `.smli` file
diverged further from morel-java. Both it and `fullMake` must pass
before committing.

### Commit message

Use the original morel-java commit summary as the first line of
the commit message. Append a blank line and then a propagation
line that cites the morel-java issue and commit SHA:

```
Join (hydromatic/morel#72)

Add clauses to `from` to support inner joins. We continue to
allow comma joins, but only up until the first step (`where`,
`join`, `group`, `yield` or `order` keyword). After that,
commas would introduce ambiguity when combined with the
commas in `group` or `compute`.

We will add outer joins (`left`, `right`, `full` keywords)
in a later commit.

Propagates hydromatic/morel#72 commit ab102172
```

If a morel-java commit uses old `[MOREL-NNN]` format, convert it
to the new format `hydromatic/morel#NNN`. For example,
`[MOREL-72] Join` becomes `Join (hydromatic/morel#72)`.

## Regular development

Regular features (originating in morel-rust) use commit message that
references the morel-rust issue (30):

```
Add `banner`, `productName`, `productVersion` properties (#30)

Add three new read-only properties to the Sys structure.

Fixes #30
```

## Quick experiments

To run a single Morel expression from the shell, pass `-e` (or
`--eval`, or `--eval=EXPR`) to the binary; the result is printed and
the process exits. Useful when reproducing a bug from a one-liner
without needing a script file:

```
$ ./target/debug/morel -e '1 + 2'
val it = 3 : int
$ ./target/debug/morel --eval='from x in [1,2,3] yield x * 2'
val it = [2,4,6] : int list
```
