## Quick Start

Get up and running immediately:

```bash
# Optional (recommended on Windows): open in dev container first
# VS Code command: Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
```

Then run:

```bash
uv run tools env setup
uv run tools env verify
uv run tools ci quality-gate   # ruff + format + pyright + mypy + pytest
```

## Documentation Structure

This guideline system is organized into focused documents for easy navigation:

### 📝 [DOCUMENTATION.md](project-specific/DOCUMENTATION.md) - Documentation Guidelines

- Abstraction levels and required sections
- Annotated folder tree standard (with inline descriptions)
- Markdown style (markdownlint) and DRY docs policy
- Cross-referencing shared framework docs

### 📋 [SETUP.md](project-specific/SETUP.md) - Environment Setup

- Prerequisites and installation
- Virtual environment creation
- Basic workflow commands
- Configuration system overview
- Quick troubleshooting

### 🔧 [DEVELOPMENT.md](project-specific/DEVELOPMENT.md) - Core Development Practices

- Quality gates and commit standards
- Testing workflow and organization
- Code style standards and tooling
- Architecture notes and best practices

### ⚙️ [CI.md](project-specific/CI.md) - Continuous Integration Guidelines

- Platform-agnostic CI principles and maintenance policies
- Links to `.github` documentation for concrete workflow implementations

### 🔀 [GIT_VERSIONING.md](project-specific/GIT_VERSIONING.md) - Git Versioning & Workflow

- Feature branch model, naming conventions, and linear history/rebase policy
- Conventional Commits format with examples
- Runnable-commit verification gates and commit granularity

### 📦 [IMPORT_GUIDELINES.md](project-specific/IMPORT_GUIDELINES.md) - Import Standards

- Strict import policies and rationale
- Canonical patterns and examples
- Review checklist and enforcement

### 🤝 Review Guidelines

- [AUTHOR_GUIDELINES.md](project-specific/AUTHOR_GUIDELINES.md) – Preparing high-signal pull requests and partnering with reviewers.
- [REVIEWER_GUIDELINES.md](project-specific/REVIEWER_GUIDELINES.md) – Conducting empathetic, high-signal reviews that align with automation.
- [CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md](project-specific/CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md) – Shared quality checklist for authors and reviewers.

### 🔍 [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](project-specific/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Problem Solving

- Common environment issues
- Import and dependency problems
- Platform-specific solutions
- Development workflow fixes

**UV-Only Workflow**: Use UV for everything - virtualenv, dependency sync, running tools and tests. No pip,
requirements.txt, or manual venv activation.

All documentation in this repo must adhere to [DOCUMENTATION.md](project-specific/DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

- **Quality gates stay green**: Always run `uv run tools ci quality-gate` before committing. Deep details live in [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](./project-specific/DEVELOPMENT.md#quality-gates-mandatory).
- **TDD and commit pairing**: Follow the commit policy in [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](./project-specific/DEVELOPMENT.md#commit-standards) and the strict TDD workflow in [`TESTING.md`](./project-specific/TESTING.md#test-driven-development-required).
- **Feature branches + conventional commits**: Required naming and history rules are documented in [`GIT_VERSIONING.md`](./project-specific/GIT_VERSIONING.md).
- **Configuration via TOML**: Treat configuration as single-source per [`SETUP.md`](./project-specific/SETUP.md#configuration-system) and [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](./project-specific/DEVELOPMENT.md#guiding-principles).
- **Strict typing + UV tooling**: See [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](./project-specific/DEVELOPMENT.md#guiding-principles) for typing, tooling, and reuse expectations.

## Essential Commands

**Environment Setup**: Follow [`SETUP.md#environment-setup`](project-specific/SETUP.md#environment-setup) to create and verify the UV environment.

**Quality Gates**: Run `uv run tools ci quality-gate` before each commit; see [`DEVELOPMENT.md#quality-gates-mandatory`](project-specific/DEVELOPMENT.md#quality-gates-mandatory) for full rationale.
