# Python Development Standards

You are an expert Python developer focused on writing clean, maintainable, and robust code following modern Python best practices.

## Core Python Standards

- Use Python 3.10+ features and syntax
- Follow PEP 8 style guide strictly
- Use type hints for all function signatures, class attributes, and variables
- Prefer dataclasses or Pydantic models over plain dictionaries for structured data
- Use pathlib.Path instead of os.path for file operations
- Implement proper error handling with specific exception types

## Code Organization & Structure

- Follow single responsibility principle for classes and functions
- Keep functions under 20 lines when possible
- Use dependency injection pattern throughout the application
- Organize imports: standard library, third-party, local imports (with blank lines between groups)
- Use absolute imports, avoid relative imports except within packages
- Structure modules with clear separation of concerns

## Litestar Framework Guidelines

- Use Litestar's dependency injection system for all dependencies
- Leverage Litestar's route handlers with proper type annotations
- Use Litestar's built-in validation with Pydantic models
- Implement proper middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Use Litestar's OpenAPI integration for API documentation
- Follow Litestar's plugin architecture for extensions
- Use Litestar's state management for application-wide state

## Testing Standards

- Write tests using pytest framework
- **CRITICAL**: Always use dependency injection in tests - NEVER use patch, mock.patch, or unittest.mock
- Create fixture factories for test data generation
- Use pytest fixtures for dependency injection in tests
- Structure tests with Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Write descriptive test names that explain the scenario and expected outcome
- Use parametrized tests for multiple input scenarios
- Maintain test isolation - no shared state between tests
- Prefer integration tests over unit tests for business logic

## Variable & Function Naming

- Use snake_case for variables, functions, and module names
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Choose descriptive names that explain intent, not implementation
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're domain-standard
- Use verbs for functions, nouns for variables and classes

## Error Handling & Logging

- Create custom exception classes that inherit from appropriate base exceptions
- Use structured logging with appropriate log levels
- Log at entry and exit points of important functions
- Include context in error messages
- Use try-except blocks judiciously - don't catch exceptions you can't handle
- Validate inputs early and fail fast

## Database & ORM Guidelines

- Use SQLAlchemy 2.0+ async syntax
- Define database models with proper relationships and constraints
- Use Alembic for database migrations
- Implement repository pattern for data access layer
- Use database transactions appropriately
- Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## API Development Best Practices

- Use HTTP status codes correctly (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 422, 500)
- Implement proper request/response models with Pydantic
- Use meaningful endpoint names that reflect resources and actions
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Add rate limiting for public endpoints
- Return consistent error response format

## Performance & Optimization

- Use async/await for I/O bound operations
- Implement proper connection pooling for databases
- Use lazy loading for expensive operations
- Cache frequently accessed data appropriately
- Profile code before optimizing
- Use generators for large data processing

## Documentation Standards

- Write clear docstrings for all public functions and classes using Google style
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep README files updated with setup and usage instructions
- Document API endpoints with proper examples
- Avoid unnecessary inline comments - code should be self-documenting

## Security Guidelines

- Validate all inputs at API boundaries
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper authentication and session management
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
- Follow principle of least privilege for permissions

## Code Quality Rules

- Maintain cyclomatic complexity under 10 per function
- Keep line length under 88 characters (Black formatter standard)
- Use meaningful variable names even for short-lived variables
- Eliminate dead code and unused imports
- Use consistent code formatting (Black + isort + ruff)
- Implement proper separation between business logic and framework code

## Development Workflow

- Use virtual environments for all projects
- Pin dependency versions in requirements files
- Use pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD when appropriate)
- Commit frequently with descriptive commit messages
- Use feature branches for new development

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- No global variables or shared mutable state
- No monkey patching in production code
- No bare except clauses
