# AGENTS.md

**SDLC‑aligned operating handbook for AI coding agents and human contributors (with MCP tooling)**

> Deliver reliable software changes using the same structure every time—mapped to a clear SDLC and enforced by policy‑as‑code.

---

## 0) Scope & Audience

- **Who**: AI coding agents, human engineers, reviewers, maintainers, release managers.
- **What**: The authoritative SDLC, workflow, quality bars, file structure, conventions, and MCP tool usage for any change (feature, fix, refactor, experiment).
- **Why**: Consistency, traceability, safe iteration—especially in monorepos and multi‑app repos.

---

## 1) Non‑Negotiables (Read First)

1. **Follow SDLC phases in order.** No coding before requirements & plan are reviewed.
2. **Everything is a Task** with its own UTC‑timestamped directory and artifacts.
3. **Manual UI QA via Chrome DevTools (MCP) is mandatory** for any UI change.
4. **Supabase: remote only.** Never run migrations or seeds against a local instance.
5. **Prefer existing patterns** (DRY/KISS/YAGNI). **Use SHADCN UI** (via **Shadcn MCP**) before custom components.
6. **Accessibility is required** (WCAG/WAI‑ARIA APG). No exceptions.
7. **Document assumptions & deviations** in the task folder.
8. **Secrets never in source.** Use env vars/secret stores; never commit tokens.
9. **Conventional Commits** and **PR templates** are enforced.
10. **PRs must reference a valid task folder** (`tasks/<slug>-YYYYMMDD-HHMM>`). CI blocks merges otherwise.
11. **Root policy path is exact.** The root file **must be** `/AGENTS.md` (uppercase). Any other path/casing fails CI.

### 1A) Non‑Overridable Core Rules (Root‑enforced, closest cannot relax)

Nested `AGENTS.md` files **cannot relax or override** these:

- Secrets never in source; only via env/secret store.
- Supabase is **remote‑only**; migrations require backup/rollback plan and evidence.
- Accessibility baseline (keyboard navigation; WCAG/WAI‑ARIA compliance).
- Manual UI QA via Chrome DevTools MCP for UI changes (with artifacts).
- Conventional Commits; PR must include task artifacts and verification evidence.

> **Add your own must‑win rules here** (root only). Anything listed here wins even against “closest‑wins” precedence.

---

## 1.5) AGENTS.md Initialization & Discovery

### Before Starting Any Task

If no `AGENTS.md` exists in the working context:

1. **Walk up the directory tree** from the current path to the repo root.
2. **Check for `AGENTS.md`** at each level (**exact casing**).
3. **If none found**, create one using the initialization workflow below.

### Initialization Workflow

**Step 1: Determine Scope**

- **Root-level**: Creating `/AGENTS.md` → use full template (this file).
- **Subproject**: Creating `/apps/web/AGENTS.md` → use nested template (§7).

**Step 2: Scaffold the File**

- Add machine‑readable **frontmatter** to every `AGENTS.md`.

**Root AGENTS.md (minimal viable)**

```markdown

scope: root

# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

<Brief description>
## Build & Test Commands
- `pnpm install` — Install
- `pnpm run dev` — Dev server
- `pnpm run build` — Production build
- `pnpm run test` — Tests
- `pnpm run lint` — Lint
## Code Style Guidelines
- <Conventions, naming, file org>
## Testing Instructions
- <How/where/coverage>
## Security Considerations
- Never commit secrets; use .env / secret store
- <Auth patterns / data handling>
## Additional Context
- Conventional Commits; PR template; Deployment notes
```

**Step 3: Commit It**

```bash
git add AGENTS.md
git commit -m "docs: initialize AGENTS.md for coding agents"
```

### Discovery Rules (for Agents & Tools)

- From path `X`, **walk up** to root collecting `AGENTS.md` (exact casing).
- Apply rules in order: **root → intermediate → closest** (**closest wins** on conflicts), except **Non‑Overridable Core Rules** which always win.
- On Unix (case‑sensitive) and macOS/Windows (default case‑insensitive), only `AGENTS.md` (uppercase) is valid. Files like `agents.md` **fail CI**.
- If none found at root: **Stop and create one** at root before proceeding (use minimal template above). Tailor to discovered files (`package.json`, `Makefile`, etc.).

**Example**

```
/repo/AGENTS.md                          # Root rules (always apply)
/repo/apps/web/AGENTS.md                 # Web app rules (inherit + override)
/repo/apps/web/src/components/AGENTS.md  # Component-specific (closest precedence)
```

#### Policy Trace (confirm effective stack)

To see which files were applied for a given source file and in what order, use the **policy‑trace script** (Appendix H) or run:

```bash
pnpm ts-node scripts/agents-policy-trace.ts apps/web/src/pages/index.tsx
```

This prints the chain `root → … → closest` so you can confirm inheritance and spot misconfigurations (e.g., wrong `extends:`).

### Large Monorepos (88+ AGENTS.md files)

- Each package/app gets its own `AGENTS.md` focused on **local concerns**.
- Root covers **cross‑cutting** rules (CI/CD, security, commit standards).
- Nested files **must** include frontmatter with `scope: subproject`, `extends: ../../AGENTS.md`, and `agents_version`.

---

## 2) Task Structure & Naming

- **Directory**: `tasks/<slug>-YYYYMMDD-HHMM/` (UTC).
  - Slugs: `user-auth-flow`, `payment-gateway-integration`, `fix-avatar-cropping`.
  - Timestamp: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM` (e.g., `20250110-1430` → 2025‑01‑10 14:30 UTC).

**Required contents**

```
tasks/<slug>-YYYYMMDD-HHMM/
├── research.md       # Requirements & analysis (what exists, reuse, constraints)
├── plan.md           # Design/plan: objective, architecture, API, states, tests, rollout
├── todo.md           # Live implementation checklist (atomic steps)
├── verification.md   # Verification: manual QA, tests, perf/a11y budgets, sign-offs
└── artifacts/        # Evidence: Lighthouse JSON, HAR, traces, screenshots, db diffs
```

**Frontmatter (add to each task file)**

```markdown

## 4) Detailed SDLC Phases (with DoR/DoD & MCP)

### Phase 0 — **Initiation (Task Setup)**

**Inputs**: Ticket or problem statement.
**Activities**:

- Create `tasks/<slug>-YYYYMMDD-HHMM/` (UTC).
- Stub `research.md` and `plan.md` with frontmatter.
  **Exit**: Task folder exists; scope stub recorded.

---

### Phase 1 — **Requirements & Analysis** (`research.md`) — **Definition of Ready**

**Goal**: Understand before building.

**Activities**:

- Inventory codebase for reuse and anti‑patterns.
- Gather functional + non‑functional requirements (a11y, perf, security, privacy, i18n).
- Identify domain constraints/risks; record recommended approach with rationale.
- Capture open questions with owners & due dates.

**Use MCP**:

- **Context7** for internal prior art; **DeepWiki** for external references.

**Outputs**:

- Reuse list; constraints; risks; external refs and why they matter; recommended direction.

**Definition of Ready (DoR)**

- [ ] Scope & success criteria are clear/measurable.
- [ ] Reuse or “no reusable pattern” is documented.
- [ ] Risks & open questions listed with owners/dates.
- [ ] Owner & reviewers assigned.

Template:

```markdown
# Research: <Feature/Change Name>

## Requirements

- Functional:
- Non‑functional (a11y, perf, security, privacy, i18n):

## Existing Patterns & Reuse

- ...

## External Resources

- [Spec/Doc](url) — why it matters

## Constraints & Risks

- ...

## Open Questions (owner, due)

- Q: ...
  A: ...

## Recommended Direction (with rationale)

- ...
```

---

### Phase 2 — **Design & Planning** (`plan.md`)

**Goal**: Turn analysis into an implementable blueprint.

**Activities**:

- Mobile‑first, progressive enhancement; prefer existing components (Shadcn).
- Define architecture, data flow, API contracts, error paths, UI states.
- Define tests and rollout (flags, metrics, kill‑switch).
- **DB:** “staging‑first” migration strategy; expansion→backfill→contraction; rollback plan.

**Use MCP**:

- **Shadcn** for components; **Supabase** for remote migrations (dry‑run → plan → apply); **Next DevTools** for routing/bundle inspection.

**Outputs**:

- Objective; success criteria; components; contracts; states; edge cases; testing; rollout & observability.

Template:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: <Feature/Change Name>

## Objective

We will enable <user> to <goal> so that <outcome>.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] <metric/condition>
- [ ] <metric/condition>

## Architecture & Components

- <ComponentA>: role
- <ComponentB>: role
  State: <where/why> | URL state: <...>

## Data Flow & API Contracts

Endpoint: METHOD /api/...
Request: { ... }
Response: { ... }
Errors: { code, message }

## UI/UX States

- Loading / Empty / Error / Success

## Edge Cases

- ...

## Testing Strategy

- Unit / Integration / E2E / Accessibility

## Rollout

- Feature flag: <flag_name> (namespace: feat.<area>.<name>)
- Exposure: 10% → 50% → 100%
- Monitoring: <dashboards/metrics>
- Kill‑switch: <how to disable safely>

## DB Change Plan (if applicable)

- Target envs: staging → production (window: <time>)
- Backup reference: <snapshot/PITR link>
- Dry‑run evidence: `artifacts/db-diff.txt`
- Backfill strategy: <chunk size, idempotency>
- Rollback plan: <steps/compensating migration>
```

---

### Phase 3 — **Implementation** (`todo.md`)

**Goal**: Execute with momentum and traceability.

**Activities**:

- Track atomic steps; log deviations & assumptions.
- Implement code, components, remote migrations, and tests.

**Use MCP**:

- **Shadcn**, **Supabase**, **Next DevTools** as needed.

Template:

```markdown
# Implementation Checklist

## Setup

- [ ] Create/extend components (Shadcn-first; exception noted if any)
- [ ] Add feature flag <flag_name> (default off)

## Core

- [ ] Data fetching / mutations
- [ ] Validation & error surfaces
- [ ] URL/state sync & navigation

## UI/UX

- [ ] Responsive layout
- [ ] Loading/empty/error states
- [ ] A11y roles, labels, focus mgmt

## Tests

- [ ] Unit
- [ ] Integration
- [ ] E2E (critical flows)
- [ ] Axe/Accessibility checks

## Notes

- Assumptions:
- Deviations:

## Batched Questions

- ...
```

---

### Phase 4 — **Verification & Validation** (`verification.md`) — **Definition of Done**

**Goal**: Prove it works, is accessible, and performs.

**Activities**:

- **Chrome DevTools MCP Manual QA**: console/network; device emulation; profiling; Lighthouse; a11y.
- Cross‑browser smoke where relevant.
- Validate edge cases & error paths; perf budgets; basic security checks.
- Attach artifacts in `artifacts/` (Lighthouse JSON, HAR, traces, screenshots, db diff).

**Budgets (mobile; 4× CPU; 4G)**

- FCP ≤ **2.0 s** · LCP ≤ **2.5 s** · CLS ≤ **0.10** · TBT ≤ **200 ms**
- Axe: **0** critical/serious issues
- Critical interaction latency: **P95 ≤ 500 ms**

**Definition of Done (DoD)**

- [ ] Requirements met; success criteria satisfied.
- [ ] All tests pass (unit/integration/E2E/a11y).
- [ ] Perf/a11y budgets met; no P0/P1.
- [ ] `verification.md` completed with artifacts.
- [ ] Docs/changelogs updated; flags & runbooks documented.

```

---

### Phase 6 — **Release & Deployment**

**Activities**:

- Roll out per plan; monitor metrics/logs; keep flag guardrails.

- Document outcomes in task folder.

**Exit**: Stable at 100%; final notes added to task.

---

### Phase 7 — **Operate & Improve**

**Activities**:

- Monitor SLOs; triage incidents; capture learnings.
- File follow‑ups; schedule refactors/tech debt as tasks.

**Exit**: Learnings captured; backlog updated.

---

## 5) Frontend: Component & UX Standards

### Components

- **Use SHADCN UI via Shadcn MCP**; extend rather than rebuild.
- **Exceptions**: Only if no Shadcn equivalent supports required a11y/UX; document justification in `plan.md` and get design sign‑off.

### Mobile‑First & Progressive Enhancement

- Build for small screens first; enhance for larger screens.
- Core flows should degrade gracefully with minimal JS where reasonable.

### Accessibility (must‑haves)

- Full keyboard navigation; manage focus (trap in modals; restore on close).
- Visible focus via `:focus-visible`.
- Prefer semantic HTML; add ARIA only when necessary.
- Provide accessible names/labels; avoid color‑only cues.
- Hierarchical headings; per‑view titles.
- Toasts/validation use polite `aria-live`.

### Forms

- Inputs ≥16px font on mobile.
- Correct `type`, `inputmode`, `autocomplete`.
- Submit triggers inline validation; focus first error.
- Submit remains enabled until request starts; show non‑blocking spinners.
- Permit paste; trim values; warn on unsaved changes.
- `Enter` submits single‑line; `Ctrl/⌘+Enter` submits textareas.

### Navigation & State

- Reflect state in URL (filters, tabs, pagination).
- Restore scroll on back/forward.
- Use `<a>/<Link>` for new‑tab & middle‑click.

### Touch & Targets

- Hit area ≥24px (mobile ≥44px). Increase padding if visuals are smaller.
- `touch-action: manipulation` where appropriate.

### Motion & Layout

- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Animate only `transform`/`opacity`; animations are interruptible.
- Test mobile, laptop, ultra‑wide; avoid accidental scrollbars.
- Respect safe areas with `env(safe-area-inset-*)`.

### Performance

- Minimize re‑renders; virtualize large lists.
- Prevent image‑induced CLS (reserve space).
- Target <500ms for common user‑visible mutations (P95).

---

## 6) Back End & Data

### Supabase — **Remote Only**

- **Never** run local Supabase for this project.
- All migrations/seeds target **remote** environments (staging/prod per plan).
- **Staging‑first** apply; production requires protected env + approval.

**MCP‑first operations**

- Use **Supabase MCP** to:
  - Preview migrations (dry run) → attach output to `artifacts/db-diff.txt`.
  - Apply to **target remote** (staging → prod).
  - Capture migration IDs and rollback steps in `verification.md`.

**Safety**

- Expansion → backfill → contraction.
- Avoid long‑running locking transactions; chunk backfills with idempotency.
- Verify backups/PITR before impactful schema changes.
- Production applies occur in a change window with on‑call acknowledged.

## 7) Nested AGENTS.md (Subprojects)

> Discovery rules in §1.5 apply. Additions/overrides only; root rules remain in force.

## 8) MCP Tooling & Integrations (Catalog + Rules)

> Use MCP when it provides **repeatability, safety, or scale**. Configure via env/secrets; do not commit tokens.

- **Chrome DevTools MCP** — Manual QA (console/network, emulation, performance, Lighthouse/a11y).
  **Phase**: 4. **Note**: For auth flows, obtain short‑lived session cookies out‑of‑band.
- **Shadcn MCP** — Discover/scaffold UI components, synchronize tokens.
  **Phases**: 2, 3. **Rule**: Prefer SHADCN before custom.
- **Next DevTools MCP** — Next.js routing/data‑fetch, server/client boundaries, bundle hints.
  **Phases**: 2, 3.
- **Supabase MCP** — Remote migrations/seeds; schema drift; rollback plans.
  **Phases**: 2, 3, 6. **Rule**: **Remote only**; connections via secrets.
- **Context7 MCP** — Semantic search over internal knowledge.
  **Phase**: 1.
- **DeepWiki MCP** — External/domain research summaries.
  **Phase**: 1.

**If MCP unavailable temporarily**: run equivalent CLI/manual steps and attach artifacts. MCP usage is still **required** long‑term.

---

## 9) Git & Branching

- **Branch**: `task/<slug>-YYYYMMDD-HHMM` (short‑lived; trunk‑based; squash merges).
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
- **PRs**: Must reference the task folder path and include evidence (screens, clips, Lighthouse, HAR, traces).

---

## 10) Red Flags, Stop Signs & Waivers

Escalate or stop immediately if:

- No reusable pattern exists for a risky area → **request design/arch review**.
- Requirements ambiguous → **clarify in Phase 1** before coding.
- Scope too large → **split into multiple tasks**.
- Assumptions stack up → **document & validate with maintainer**.
- No verification plan → **define success criteria** first.
- Skipping **DevTools MCP** QA for UI → **not allowed**.
- Attempting **local** Supabase migrations/seeds → **not allowed**.
- Secrets appear in diffs or artifacts → **block PR** until removed.

### 10.1 Waiver / Hotfix Flow (exception path)

- **Use only for urgent hotfixes (P0/P1).**
- Branch: `hotfix/<slug>-YYYYMMDD-HHMM>`.
- Minimal `research.md`/`plan.md` allowed if risk explicitly documented.
- **Post‑merge within 24h**: complete full Phase 4, attach artifacts, and file retro in Phase 7.
- Approvals: Maintainer + QA Lead; time‑boxed waiver (≤72h).

## 12) Key Questions Before You Start

1. Who is the user and what exact problem are we solving?
2. What can we **reuse** from the codebase?
3. What are the edge cases and failure modes?
4. What does **success** look like (metrics, states, acceptance criteria)?
5. What could go wrong, and what is our mitigation/rollback?

### B) Style Principles

- **DRY**: Reuse patterns/components.
- **KISS**: Prefer simple, obvious solutions.
- **YAGNI**: Build only what's needed now.

### C) MCP Pre‑Flight (copy into `verification.md` when MCP is used)

```
[ ] Server reachable (version printed)
[ ] Session token valid (if required)
[ ] Secrets sourced via env (not logged)
[ ] Target environment confirmed (staging/prod)
```

### D) Security Baselines

- **Secret scanning** required (e.g., Gitleaks/Trufflehog) on every PR.
- **SAST** (e.g., CodeQL/Semgrep) on default branches and PRs.
- **Dependency audit** (pnpm/yarn/npm audit) with allowlisted exceptions only.
- **SBOM** generation for release builds if applicable.
- **Commit signing** recommended; protected environments for production.

### E) PR Template (drop in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)

```markdown

```

### G) CI Enforcement (policy‑as‑code)

**agents-guards.yml** (example)

```yaml
name: Agents Guards
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  guards:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: { fetch-depth: 0 }
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '20' }
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile || npm ci
      - run: node scripts/check-agents-compliance.cjs
```

**scripts/check-agents-compliance.cjs**

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function read(file) {
  return fs.existsSync(file) ? fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8') : '';
}

// 1) Root file must be exactly /AGENTS.md
if (!fs.existsSync(path.join(process.cwd(), 'AGENTS.md'))) {
  console.error('Missing required root /AGENTS.md (exact casing).');
  process.exit(1);
}

// 2) Validate all nested AGENTS.md have scope: subproject and a non-null extends:
function* walk(dir) {
  for (const e of fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true })) {
    const p = path.join(dir, e.name);
    if (e.isDirectory()) yield* walk(p);
    else if (e.isFile() && e.name === 'AGENTS.md' && p !== path.join(process.cwd(), 'AGENTS.md'))
      yield p;
  }
}
let ok = true;
for (const p of walk(process.cwd())) {
  const content = read(p);
  const hasScope = /scope:\s*subproject\b/.test(content);
  const hasExt = /extends:\s+(\.\.\/)+AGENTS\.md\b/.test(content);
  if (!hasScope || !hasExt) {
    console.error(
      `Nested ${p} must declare 'scope: subproject' and a valid 'extends: ../../AGENTS.md' path.`,
    );
    ok = false;
  }
}
if (!ok) process.exit(1);
console.log('AGENTS policy checks passed.');
```

### H) Policy‑Trace Script (confirm effective stack)

**scripts/agents-policy-trace.ts**

```ts
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

function walkAgents(startFile: string) {
  const stack: string[] = [];
  let dir = path.resolve(path.dirname(startFile));
  while (true) {
    const p = path.join(dir, 'AGENTS.md'); // exact casing
    if (fs.existsSync(p)) stack.push(p);
    const parent = path.resolve(dir, '..');
    if (parent === dir) break;
    dir = parent;
  }
  return stack.reverse(); // root -> ... -> closest
}

const targets = process.argv.slice(2);
if (targets.length === 0) {
  console.error('Usage: ts-node scripts/agents-policy-trace.ts <path/to/file>');
  process.exit(1);
}
for (const f of targets) {
  const stack = walkAgents(f);
  console.log(`\n${f}\nEffective AGENTS stack:`);
  stack.forEach((p, i) => console.log(`  ${i + 1}. ${p}`));
}
```

Usage:

```bash
pnpm ts-node scripts/agents-policy-trace.ts apps/web/src/pages/index.tsx
```
