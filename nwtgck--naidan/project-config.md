# Development Principles

*   **Zod**: Must be used for all data persistence and API communication to ensure safe serialization. All API responses MUST be validated to protect the application from unreliable external data structures. Persisted data must maintain backward compatibility.
*   **Strong Typing**: Prefer strict static typing to catch errors at build-time. Avoid `any`.
*   **Exhaustive Type Checking**: Use `switch` statements with a `default` block assigning to `never` (e.g., `const _ex: never = val;`) when handling union types to ensure all cases are handled.
*   **Verification**: Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint:fix` and `npm run test:only-failed` before committing to ensure quality and prevent regressions.
*   **Targeted Testing**: Test specific files or directories (multiple paths supported) by passing them as arguments: `npm run test:only-failed -- <paths...>`.

# Function Signatures & Named Arguments

For **new** or **refactored** functions, use a single mandatory argument object (Swift-style) for clarity and extensibility. **This applies even if the function has only one argument.**

- **Why single-argument objects?**: Function requirements frequently evolve. Starting with an object ensures that adding a second or third parameter is a non-breaking, consistent change. This prevents "parameter creep" where developers might otherwise add positional arguments to avoid refactoring, leading to inconsistent and hard-to-read signatures.
- **Explicit > Implicit**: Avoid property defaults. They hide intent and create "implicit knowledge". Require explicit values (including `undefined`) so the state is fully visible at the call site.
- **Inline Types**: Prefer inline destructuring and type definitions in signatures.
- **No Nulls**: Use `undefined` for missing values.

### Examples

#### ❌ BAD (Positional Arguments)
```typescript
// Difficult to read at call site, prone to order mismatch
async function processRecord(id: string, retryCount: number | undefined, isSilent: boolean) { ... }

// Caller: What do 3 and true mean here? Is the second arg retryCount or something else?
await processRecord("rec_123", 3, true);

// Even single arguments should not be positional.
// If you need to add 'force: boolean' later, you'll either have to refactor 
// all call sites or end up with a confusing positional signature.
async function deleteUser(id: string) { ... }
await deleteUser("user_123");
```

#### ❌ BAD (Implicit Defaults)
```typescript
// Definitions are hidden from the caller, creating "implicit knowledge"
async function processRecord({ id, retryCount = 3, isSilent = false }: {
  id: string,
  retryCount?: number,
  isSilent?: boolean,
}) { ... }

// Caller: What are the defaults for retryCount and isSilent? It's not clear here.
await processRecord({ id: "rec_123" });
```

#### ✅ GOOD (Explicit Named Arguments)
```typescript
// Self-documenting, order-independent, and fully explicit
async function processRecord({ id, retryCount, isSilent }: {
  id: string,
  retryCount: number | undefined,
  isSilent: boolean,
}) {
  // logic...
}

// Caller: Clear and safe. Every state is visible.
// Similar to Swift's named arguments style.
await processRecord({
  id: "rec_123",
  retryCount: 3,
  isSilent: true,
});

// Even single arguments use the object-based named argument style.
// This is future-proof: adding 'force: boolean' later won't require 
// changing the parameter structure at existing call sites.
async function deleteUser({ id }: { id: string }) { ... }
await deleteUser({ id: "user_123" });
```

# Type Design: Avoid Booleans for Future-Proofing

Even if a property seems binary today, prefer a **Literal String Union** over a `boolean` if there is any possibility it could evolve. Replacing a boolean with a union later requires refactoring all call sites, which we want to avoid.

-   **Extensibility**: Adding a third or fourth state to a union is a non-breaking change for existing logic (if handled by a switch).
-   **No "In-Between" States**: Prevents the "Boolean Growth" problem where you end up with `isA: boolean`, `isB: boolean`, etc., leading to impossible combinations.
-   **Semantic Clarity**: `status: 'hidden'` is more descriptive than `isVisible: false`.

### Examples

#### ❌ BAD (Boolean-first, hard to extend)
```typescript
interface Widget {
  isVisible: boolean,
}

// Later, you need a "collapsed" state...
// You either add 'isCollapsed: boolean' (bad, now you have 4 combinations)
// or you refactor 'isVisible' to something else (breaking change).
```

#### ✅ GOOD (Union-first, easy to extend)
```typescript
type Visibility = 'visible' | 'hidden' | 'collapsed';

interface Widget {
  visibility: Visibility,
}

// Adding 'archived' or 'minimized' later is a non-breaking extension.
const widget: Widget = {
  visibility: 'hidden',
};
```

*   **Non-interactive Tests**: Prefer `npm run test:only-failed` when executing tests as an agent or in CI to ensure the process exits after completion, does not hang in watch mode, and minimizes output noise.
