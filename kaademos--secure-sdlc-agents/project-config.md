# Secure SDLC — Active Security Context

You are operating with a **Secure SDLC agent team** available via MCP tools (`sdlc_*`).
Apply security thinking at every step. Do not wait to be asked.

---

## When writing or reviewing code, automatically check:

### Authentication & Session
- Every API route / endpoint has authentication enforced — no auth bypass paths
- Session tokens are cryptographically random (≥128 bits) and invalidated on logout
- Passwords stored with bcrypt (cost ≥12), Argon2id, or scrypt — never MD5/SHA alone
- JWT tokens have `alg` validated explicitly — never accept `alg: none`

### Authorisation
- Every object access checks the requesting user OWNS or has permission for that SPECIFIC resource (prevent IDOR)
- Default deny: if no rule grants access, deny
- Server-side auth on every request — never trust client-supplied role claims

### Input Handling
- All inputs validated server-side (allowlist, not denylist)
- Queries use parameterised statements / ORM — no string concatenation with user input
- File uploads: validate by magic bytes (not MIME/extension), reject SVG, randomise stored filenames
- Never use user input directly in filesystem paths, shell commands, or eval

### Secrets & Cryptography
- No secrets in code, config files, or environment files committed to git
- AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption at rest
- TLS 1.2 minimum for all communications; TLS 1.3 preferred
- Keys live in secrets managers (Vault, AWS SM, etc.) — never hardcoded

### Error Handling & Logging
- Generic error messages to users; detailed errors logged server-side
- Never log credentials, tokens, PII, or payment data
- Log: auth attempts, access control decisions, admin actions (timestamp, user, IP, outcome)

### Dependencies
- New packages reviewed before adding: check CVE status, maintenance, download count
- SCA (Software Composition Analysis) on every PR

## MCP Tool Triggers — invoke automatically when these situations occur:

| Situation | Tool to invoke |
|---|---|
| Starting a new feature | `sdlc_plan_feature` |
| Designing architecture | `sdlc_threat_model` |
| Reviewing a PR or code diff | `sdlc_review_pr` |
| Writing/reviewing Terraform, K8s, Helm | `sdlc_review_infra` |
| SAST tool produced findings | `sdlc_triage_sast` |
| About to deploy / release | `sdlc_release_gate` |
| Building AI/LLM features | `sdlc_ai_security_review` |
| Quick security question | `sdlc_security_champion` |

---

## Severity gate (blocks progression):

- **CRITICAL** → stop, do not proceed, must be fixed
- **HIGH** → flag prominently, must be resolved or formally accepted before release
- **MEDIUM** → document in risk register, remediate before release
- **LOW** → track, fix as normal backlog

---

## Phase artefacts — remind the user to produce these:

| Phase | Artefact | Agent |
|---|---|---|
| PLAN | `docs/security-requirements.md` | product-manager |
| PLAN | `docs/risk-register.md` | grc-analyst |
| DESIGN | `docs/threat-model.md` | appsec-engineer |
| DESIGN | `docs/infra-security-review.md` | cloud-platform-engineer |
| BUILD | `docs/sast-findings.md` | appsec-engineer |
| TEST | `docs/test-security-report.md` | appsec-engineer |
| RELEASE | `docs/release-security-sign-off.md` | release-manager |

If these don't exist when relevant code is being written, proactively suggest creating them.

---

## AI/LLM feature security (2026):

When you see code that calls an LLM API, processes user input sent to a model, or builds
agentic systems, always check for:
- **Prompt injection** — can user input override system instructions?
- **Indirect prompt injection** — can retrieved content inject instructions?
- **Tool/function abuse** — what can a manipulated model be tricked into calling?
- **PII leakage** — is sensitive data being sent to external model APIs without consent?
- **Output validation** — are AI outputs validated before use in downstream systems?
