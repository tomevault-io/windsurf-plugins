Update the `pytidb` dependency in all example projects (e.g., `examples/auto_embedding/reqs.txt`) and verify that they work with the latest version.

### Steps

1. List all examples
2. Using `todo_write` tool to add each example to the ToDo list.
3. Process each example as following steps one by one.
   1. Check the latest `pytidb` version in `pyproject.toml`.
   2. Update the `reqs.txt` files accordingly.
   3. Create a virtual environment (If not exists):

      ```bash
      python -m venv .venv
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```

   4. Install dependencies:

      ```bash
      pip install -q -r reqs.txt
      ```

   5. Run the example entry point (python main.py or streamlit run app.py) to confirm functionality.
