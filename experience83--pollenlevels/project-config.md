# Repository Guidelines

## Tooling
- Tooling (CI, lint, format) runs on **Python 3.14**. The `pyproject.toml` targets packaging/tooling and also pins `requires-python = ">=3.14"`. All code under `custom_components/pollenlevels/` targets Python 3.14+, matching the Home Assistant 2026.3 runtime baseline.
- Format code with Black (line length 88, target-version `py314`) pinned at `black==25.*`.
- Lint and sort imports with Ruff targeting `py314`, pinned at `ruff==0.14.*`, matching the configuration in `pyproject.toml`.
- Every change must pass `ruff check --fix --select I` (for import order) and `ruff check` before submission.
- Run `black .` (or the narrowest possible path) to ensure formatting.

## Release & API boundaries
- Do not change the integration version or changelog entries unless explicitly requested.
- Do not rename entities, alter `unique_id` patterns, or modify translation keys unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer minimal, focused diffs; avoid cosmetic refactors or large code moves.

## Changelog / `CHANGELOG.md`
- This section is the single source of truth for the changelog style. Ignore external style guides when they conflict with these rules.
- Do NOT add any new boilerplate, intro text or `## [Unreleased]` section automatically. If such sections already exist, leave them and only edit their content when explicitly requested.
- Version headings must use the pattern `## [version] - YYYY-MM-DD` (ASCII hyphen) and releases must stay in reverse chronological order. Use SemVer identifiers such as `1.8.2`, `1.8.2-rc1`, `1.8.1-alpha1`.
- Inside each version, use only these headings: `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Deprecated`, `### Removed`, `### Fixed`, `### Security`. Prefer `Changed` for documentation-only updates.
- For breaking changes, keep one of the allowed section headings above and
  prefix the bullet with `**Breaking change:**`; do not add a separate
  `### Breaking Changes` heading.
- Each change must be a `- ` bullet. Wrap long bullets around 80–100 characters with indented continuation lines; do NOT insert blank lines inside a bullet and avoid `<br>` or trailing double spaces.
- Keep diffs minimal: never reflow or rewrap unrelated text, and never rename existing headings unless they clearly violate these rules.
- If comparison links exist at the bottom of the changelog, keep the existing style and only extend it for new versions of this repository.

## Style and Documentation
- All code comments, README entries, and changelog notes **must be written in English**.
- Keep imports tidy—remove unused symbols and respect the Ruff isort grouping so the Home Assistant package stays first-party under `custom_components/pollenlevels`.
- Translation source of truth is `custom_components/pollenlevels/translations/en.json`. Keep all other locale files in sync with it and do not add or rely on a `strings.json` file.


## Integration Architecture
- This repository hosts the custom integration **Pollen Levels for Home Assistant**, distributed through **HACS**.
- Preserve the current coordinator-driven architecture under `custom_components/pollenlevels` when extending functionality. Study the existing setup (`__init__.py`, platform files, and helpers) and mirror their async patterns, error handling, and notification logic.
- When implementing features, align with Home Assistant best practices (ConfigEntry setup, `DataUpdateCoordinator`, platform separation) and avoid introducing blocking I/O in the event loop.

## Verification
- Ensure the integration still loads within Home Assistant with the existing config flows and maintains parity with the current logic paths for entity updates and notifications.
