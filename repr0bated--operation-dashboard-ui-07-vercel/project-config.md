# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Editing discipline

Read and understand the full relevant function/file before proposing or making any change — do not pattern-match your way to a fix. `sed`/`awk`/blind find-replace apply a textual substitution without ever seeing the surrounding logic, which is exactly how a "fix" silently breaks something the match itself never revealed. Prefer `Read` + `Edit` over shell-level text substitution for any real code change.
