# Changeset Guidelines

## Overview

This project uses `@changesets/cli` to manage versioning and changelogs. When you implement features or fixes that are worth mentioning in the changelog, you MUST create a changeset.

## AI Agent Workflow

As an AI agent, you cannot run the interactive `pnpm changeset` command. Instead, you should automatically create changeset files:

1. **After completing a task**, evaluate if a changeset is needed based on the criteria below
2. **Create a changeset file** in `.changeset/` directory:
   - Generate a random kebab-case filename (e.g., `happy-pigs-dance.md`, `brave-lions-jump.md`)
   - Use the proper YAML frontmatter format with package names and change types
   - Write a clear, user-facing summary of the change
3. The changeset file will be committed alongside the code changes

### Changeset File Format

```markdown
---
"@deadlock-mods/package-name": minor
"@deadlock-mods/another-package": patch
---

Clear, concise description of the change from the user's perspective.
```

## When to Create a Changeset

Create a changeset for:

- **New features** - Any new functionality that users will interact with
- **Bug fixes** - Fixes that resolve user-facing issues or critical bugs
- **Breaking changes** - Any changes that require user action or break existing functionality
- **Performance improvements** - Significant optimizations that users will notice
- **Security fixes** - Any security-related patches

## When NOT to Create a Changeset

Skip changesets for:

- Refactoring that doesn't change functionality
- Code style changes or formatting
- Documentation updates
- Internal tooling changes
- Development dependencies updates
- Test updates without functional changes

## Creating a Changeset

When creating a changeset file, you need to specify:

1. **Packages** - Which packages are affected by your changes
2. **Change type** - One of:
   - `patch` - Bug fixes and minor changes (0.0.X)
   - `minor` - New features that are backwards compatible (0.X.0)
   - `major` - Breaking changes (X.0.0)
3. **Summary** - A clear description of the change in a user-friendly way

### Writing Good Changeset Summaries

**✅ Good summaries:**

```markdown
Add dark mode toggle to settings page
Fix crash when downloading large mod files
Improve mod installation performance by 50%
```

**❌ Bad summaries:**

```markdown
Updated code
Fixed bug
Refactored component
```

### Guidelines for Summaries

- Write from the user's perspective
- Be specific and concise
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Improve, Remove, etc.)
- Focus on what changed, not how it was implemented
- Keep it under 80 characters when possible

## Changeset Files

Changesets are stored in `.changeset/` directory as markdown files. Each file:

- Contains YAML frontmatter with affected packages and change types
- Contains a markdown description of the change
- Is committed to git alongside your code changes

Example changeset file:

```markdown
---
"@deadlock-mods/desktop": minor
"@deadlock-mods/api": patch
---

Add support for mod collections with automatic dependency resolution
```

## Workflow Integration

1. Make your code changes
2. AI agent automatically creates a changeset file in `.changeset/` directory
3. Commit both your code changes and the changeset file together
4. When ready to release, changesets will automatically:
   - Generate changelog entries
   - Bump version numbers
   - Create release notes

## Multiple Changes in One PR

If your PR includes multiple notable changes:

- Create separate changeset files for each distinct feature/fix
- Each changeset should focus on one specific change

## Monorepo Considerations

This project is a monorepo with multiple packages:

- **Apps**: `api`, `bot`, `desktop`, `lockdex`, `www`
- **Packages**: `common`, `database`, `logging`, `shared`, `ui`, `vpk-parser`, etc.

When creating changesets:

- Only include packages that are directly affected by your change
- Don't include packages that are only affected as transitive dependencies
- Use correct package names from the monorepo (check `package.json` files)

## Examples

### Example 1: New Feature

File: `.changeset/happy-elephants-smile.md`

```markdown
---
"@deadlock-mods/desktop": minor
---

Add mod conflict detection with visual indicators
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix Affecting Multiple Packages

File: `.changeset/brave-lions-jump.md`

```markdown
---
"@deadlock-mods/desktop": patch
"@deadlock-mods/shared": patch
---

Fix incorrect mod version comparison logic
```

### Example 3: Breaking Change

File: `.changeset/serious-tigers-roar.md`

```markdown
---
"@deadlock-mods/api": major
---

Remove deprecated /v1/mods endpoint (use /v2/mods instead)
```

## Filename Generation

Generate random, friendly filenames using the pattern `adjective-animals-verb.md`:

- Use 2-3 random words separated by hyphens
- Keep it simple and memorable
- Examples: `happy-dogs-run.md`, `clever-cats-jump.md`, `swift-birds-fly.md`

## Verification

After AI agent creates a changeset:

1. Verify a new file was created in `.changeset/`
2. Check the frontmatter has correct package names and change types
3. Ensure the summary is clear and user-facing
4. The changeset file will be committed with your code changes
