# Workflow Guidelines

## First Step for Any Task

- Before starting work on any task, always check the `.cursor/rules` directory for relevant guidance
- These documents contain established workflows, conventions, and requirements for different aspects of the project
- Following these rule files will ensure consistency and reduce rework
- If multiple rule files seem relevant, review all of them before proceeding

## Last Step for Any Task

- If you've learned new concepts, workflows, or best practices during task completion, suggest updates to the relevant rules
- For new workflows that aren't covered by existing rules, suggest creating a new rule file
- **Create a changeset if your changes are worth mentioning in the changelog:**
  - Run `pnpm changeset` for new features, bug fixes, or breaking changes
  - See `090-changesets.mdc` for detailed guidelines on when and how to create changesets
  - Skip changesets for refactoring, formatting, or internal changes
- Evaluate whether tests should be added for your changes:
  - For functional code, new features, API changes, or bug fixes, tests are essential
  - For content-only changes like frontend changes or documentation updates, tests are typically not required
  - When in doubt, err on the side of adding tests - they provide long-term stability and prevent regressions
- Always run appropriate linting and formatting before considering a task complete:

  - Commands must be run from the root of the monorepo

  ```bash
  pnpm lint:fix
  pnpm format:fix
  ```

- Verify that no regressions are introduced by your changes
