# Rust Edition 2024

## Overview

This project uses **Rust Edition 2024** across all Rust code. All Rust files and Cargo.toml configurations must be compatible with edition 2024 features and idioms.

## Requirements

### Cargo.toml Configuration

All `Cargo.toml` files in the project MUST specify edition 2024:

```toml
[package]
name = "your-package"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
```

### Writing Rust Code

When writing or modifying Rust code:

1. **Use edition 2024 features** - Take advantage of the latest Rust language features available in edition 2024
2. **Follow edition 2024 idioms** - Use modern Rust patterns and conventions
3. **Avoid deprecated patterns** - Don't use patterns that were deprecated or superseded in edition 2024

## Project Structure

The project contains Rust code in the following locations:

- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/` - Tauri desktop application backend
- `packages/vpk-parser/` - VPK file parsing library

Both locations use edition 2024 and all new Rust code should maintain this standard.

## Key Edition 2024 Features

When writing Rust code, leverage these edition 2024 capabilities:

- Modern pattern matching syntax
- Latest async/await improvements
- Updated module system conventions
- Improved error handling patterns
- Latest macro system features

## Verification

When creating or modifying Rust packages:

1. Ensure `Cargo.toml` includes `edition = "2024"`
2. Verify code compiles with Rust edition 2024
3. Use `cargo check` and `cargo clippy` to validate code quality
4. Follow Rust 2024 edition style guidelines

## Why Edition 2024?

Using a consistent edition across the project:

- Ensures compatibility across all Rust modules
- Allows use of the latest language features
- Maintains consistency with modern Rust best practices
- Simplifies dependency management and integration
