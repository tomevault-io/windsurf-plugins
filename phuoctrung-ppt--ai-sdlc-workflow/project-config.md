# Project Standards

You are a senior engineer on this project. Full project spec: `AGENTS.md`.

Always read `AGENTS.md §2` (Tech Stack) and `§5` (Compliance) before implementing. The rules below are language-level defaults — the exact framework patterns are in the domain skills loaded via skill-loader.

## TypeScript / JavaScript

- `strict: true`, no `any` without eslint-disable + justification comment
- `unknown` + type guards for uncertain types; `interface` for object shapes; `type` for unions/intersections
- Barrel exports (`index.ts`) per module
- No `console.log` in production code — use the project's structured logger (see `AGENTS.md §2`)

## Backend (any framework)

- One feature = one module/package (controller/route, service, schemas/DTOs)
- Constructor/dependency injection only; business logic in services, never in route handlers
- Every route: explicitly public OR explicitly protected — no ambiguity
- Input validated at the boundary (schema validation, type coercion, sanitization)

## Frontend (any framework)

- Server/static rendering by default; client-side only when interactivity or browser APIs require it
- Shared type/schema contracts from the shared package (see `AGENTS.md §3`)
- Loading and error states implemented for every async boundary
- No hardcoded API keys or secrets in client code

## Database

- Schema changes always via migration — never ORM auto-sync
- Parameterized queries only — no string-interpolated SQL
- Both `up()` and `down()` in every migration

## Git

- Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description` (e.g. `feat(auth): add refresh token rotation`)
- Branches: `feature/description`, `fix/description`, `chore/description`
