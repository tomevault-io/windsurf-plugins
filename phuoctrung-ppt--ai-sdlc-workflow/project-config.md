# Agentic Workflow Guardrails

Canonical workflow: `AGENTS.md`. Project standards are configured in `.cursor/config/workflow-policy.json` and always include `AGENTS.md`.

## Execution Order

1. Classify the change mechanically with `.cursor/config/protected-paths.json`; do not rely on agent self-report.
2. Plan with `architect-planner` for protected module-spanning/high-risk work.
4. Implement with the narrowest matching worker agent.
5. Verify locally with checks proportional to risk.
6. For protected changes, persist `docs/reviews/*` via `judge-agent` or `/workflow-eval` before completion.


## Protected Change Classifier

Protected status is shared by plans, judge review, stop hooks, and `/workflow-eval`:

- Path globs and keywords live in `.cursor/config/protected-paths.json`.
- Multi-file threshold also lives in `.cursor/config/protected-paths.json`.
- Fail closed only for protected changes. Fail open for standard changes to avoid team-wide lockouts from broken hooks.
- `/workflow-eval` always writes a durable review artifact whenever it runs.

## Hook Enforcement

- `preToolUse` enforces worker path scopes from `.cursor/config/worker-scopes.json`.
- `afterFileEdit` records edited files for stop-hook classification.
- `stop` blocks protected changes without current plan/review artifacts.
- Stop blocking has a retry cap; after the cap, the hook writes a human escalation artifact instead of looping forever.
- Manual review override must be explicit and logged with `.cursor/hooks/review-override.sh --skip-review "reason"`.

If scope enforcement blocks a worker, request scope expansion from the orchestrator with the path, reason, and updated acceptance criteria.

## Handoff Packet Required

Every worker task should start from a handoff packet containing:

- Objective
- In-scope paths
- Out-of-scope paths
- Required skills and selected reference files
- Acceptance criteria
- Required verification commands
- Risks or constraints from `AGENTS.md`

If any field is missing, infer only low-risk details from the codebase. Ask the orchestrator before expanding scope.

## Completion Evidence

Do not claim completion from intent or a file edit alone. Completion requires evidence:

- Modified files match the acceptance criteria.
- Relevant lint/type/test/build commands were run, or skipped with a concrete reason.
- Domain-specific checks such as security, privacy, data, AI, billing, infrastructure, or compliance were applied when relevant.
- Docs/ADRs were updated when behavior, architecture, or workflow changed.

## Context Control

- Read `SKILL.md` files only for selected skills.
- Load reference files one at a time only when needed.
- Do not bulk-read entire `references/` folders.
- Write durable decisions to `docs/plans/`, `docs/adr/`, or `docs/reviews/`.
