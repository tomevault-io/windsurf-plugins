# AI Ethics & Compliance

> ⚠️ **EXAMPLE DOMAIN (AI hiring/recruiting) — NOT this project's rules.**
> This file is a portable **example** of how to encode AI-ethics compliance. Its specifics
> (hire/reject, CV/biometric consent, bias/HR) do **not** describe the current project.
> **Agents: ignore the domain specifics below until this file is replaced** with real
> compliance rules for `<PROJECT>` (see `AGENTS.md §6`). Delete or rewrite on port.

Details: `AGENTS.md` §6.

## Human-in-the-Loop (mandatory)

- AI cannot auto-reject or auto-hire; HR approval required for Rejected/Hired
- Reject/hire endpoints need `?confirm=true`; without it → `202` + `pending_human_review`
- Override reason required when HR disagrees with AI; 48h SLA or escalation

## Explainable AI

Every AI decision returns `explanation`: `confidence`, `factors[]`, `counterfactuals[]`, model card link.

## Consent & Biometric

- Consent screen before CV upload; separate explicit consent for video/voice
- Check `consents.granted=true` for `biometric` before processing; else `403 ConsentRequired`
- Auto-delete raw video after transcription; never store facial/voice embeddings

## Bias & Audit

- Run `BiasDetectionService.check()` before match scores; flag `bias_alert` if disparate impact
- Log every AI decision to `audit_logs` with `ai_model_version`, `ai_confidence`; 7yr retention for hiring
