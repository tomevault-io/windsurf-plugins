# AGENTS.md

This document provides guidelines for AI agents working on the Flow Chat project.

## Commit Convention

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Commit Types (type)

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `chore`: Chores (dependency updates, build config, documentation, etc.)
- `style`: Style changes (no logic changes)
- `docs`: Documentation
- `test`: Test related
- `perf`: Performance optimization

### Scope

Optional, used to identify the scope of the commit. Common scopes include:

- `ui`: UI components
- `tools`: Tools
- `schema`: Database schema
- `utils`: Utility functions
- `README`: Documentation
- `tutorial`: Tutorial related
- `settings`: Settings related

### Subject

- Use imperative mood, lowercase first letter
- No period at the end
- Be concise and clear, describing the main purpose of the commit

### Examples

```bash
# New features
feat: add multi-layer prompts and memory to templates
feat(tools): add `write_memory` tool (#94)

# Bug fixes
fix: token streaming (#85)
fix(schema): cascade delete rooms (#90)
fix: add in-flight guard for sending (close #87) (#88)

# Refactoring
refactor(ui): new input ui (#93)
refactor: migrate to `pglite` (#80)

# Chores
chore: bump deps (#78)
chore(README): add star history (#73)

# Style
style: better style for markdown view (#53)
```

### Issue References

- If the commit closes an issue, use `(close #87)` or `(fixes #87)`
- If the commit references an issue, use the format `(#94)`

### Notes

1. Commit messages should clearly describe the purpose of the change
2. If a commit involves multiple aspects, prioritize the most important type
3. Scope is optional and should only be used when it helps understand the commit
4. Keep commit messages concise; detailed explanations can be added in PR descriptions

## Code Quality Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Early returns**: Use early returns to reduce nested if statements and improve code readability when possible

### Type Safety

- **Avoid using `any` type**: Always use proper TypeScript types. Use type inference from libraries (e.g., `InferSelectModel` from drizzle-orm) or define explicit types instead of `any`
- **Avoid type assertions**: Prefer type inference over `as` type assertions. Only use type assertions when absolutely necessary and add comments explaining why

### Code Comments

- **Use English for comments**: If comments are necessary, write them in English to maintain consistency across the codebase
- **Prefer self-documenting code**: Write clear, readable code that explains itself. Only add comments when they provide additional context that isn't obvious from the code itself

### String Literals

- **Use English for hardcoded strings**: All hardcoded string literals in code should be in English. User-facing strings should be internationalized using the i18n system (see `locales/` directory) instead of being hardcoded

### Pre-commit Checks

- **Type checking**: Run `pnpm typecheck` before committing to ensure there are no type errors
- **Linting**: Ensure code passes linting checks (`pnpm lint`) before committing

### Dynamic Prompts

- **Use Velin for dynamic prompts**: When creating system prompts or other dynamic text content that needs to be rendered with variables, prefer using Velin (`.velin.md` files) over string concatenation or template literals. Velin allows you to use Vue's reactive system, props, and template syntax for cleaner and more maintainable prompt generation.

## Database Schema Migrations

When working on a PR that involves multiple schema changes:

1. **Consolidate migration files**: If multiple migration files were generated during development, you can delete all the newly created migration files in the PR
2. **Regenerate migrations**: Use `pnpm db:generate` to generate a single migration file that includes all schema changes made in the PR
3. **Update journal**: When deleting migration files, also remove the corresponding entries from `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` that were added for those migrations

This ensures that the PR contains a single, clean migration file that represents all schema changes, making it easier to review and maintain.
