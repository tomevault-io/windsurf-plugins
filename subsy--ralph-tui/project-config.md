# Agent Instructions

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

You are an AI assistant. Your role is to assist with software development tasks while adhering to strict coding standards and practices. Here's how you should approach your work:

1. Critical Coding Rules:
   - Prioritize simple, clean, and maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones.
   - Make the smallest reasonable changes to achieve the desired outcome.
   - Never make unrelated code changes; document issues for later instead.
   - Preserve code comments unless you can prove they are actively false.
   - Start all code files with a file-level JSDoc comment section explaining the file's purpose, prefixed with "ABOUTME: ".
   - Avoid temporal context in comments; make them evergreen.

2. Avoiding entropy
   - This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut you take becomes someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt that slows the whole team down.
   - You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this
project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners you cut will be cut again.
   - Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.

## Build Instructions

This project uses **bun** as its package manager and runtime.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the project
bun run build

# Type check (no emit)
bun run typecheck

# Lint
bun run lint
bun run lint:fix    # Auto-fix lint issues

# Run in development mode
bun run dev

# Clean build artifacts
bun run clean
```

**After making code changes**, always run:
```bash
bun run typecheck && bun run build
```

## Issue Tracking with beads-rust

This project uses **br** (beads-rust) for issue tracking. Data is stored in `.beads/` directory.

### Quick Reference

```bash
br ready              # Find available work (unblocked issues)
br list               # List all open issues
br list --all         # Include closed issues
br show <id>          # View issue details with dependencies
br show <id> --json   # JSON output for programmatic use
```

### Creating & Managing Issues

```bash
# Create issues
br create "Title" --type task --priority 2 --description "Details"
br create "Epic title" --type epic --priority 1
br create "Child task" --type task --parent <epic-id>

# Update status
br update <id> --status in_progress   # Claim work
br update <id> --status open          # Release work
br update <id> --assignee "email"     # Assign to someone

# Close issues
br close <id>                         # Mark complete
br close <id> --reason "explanation"  # With reason
```

### Dependencies

```bash
br dep add <issue> <depends-on>       # Add dependency (issue depends on depends-on)
br dep remove <issue> <depends-on>    # Remove dependency
br dep list <id>                      # List dependencies
br dep tree <id>                      # Show dependency tree
br dep cycles                         # Detect circular dependencies
```

### Filtering & Search

```bash
br list --status open                 # Filter by status
br list --type task                   # Filter by type (task, bug, feature, epic)
br list --priority 1                  # Filter by priority (0-4, 0=critical)
br list --label backend               # Filter by label
br list --assignee "email"            # Filter by assignee
br ready --type task                  # Ready tasks only (exclude epics)
```

### Syncing with Git

```bash
br sync --flush-only                  # Export DB to JSONL (for commits)
git add .beads/ && git commit         # Commit issue changes
```

### JSON Output

Most commands support `--json` for programmatic access:

```bash
br list --json | jq '.[0]'            # First issue
br ready --json | jq 'length'         # Count of ready issues
br show <id> --json | jq '.dependents'  # Get children of epic
```

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| P0 (0) | Critical - Drop everything |
| P1 (1) | High - Do soon |
| P2 (2) | Medium - Normal work |
| P3 (3) | Low - When time permits |
| P4 (4) | Backlog - Someday/maybe |

### Issue Types

- `epic` - Large feature or initiative containing child tasks
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - General work item
- `bug` - Defect to fix

### Parent-Child Relationships

When you create a task with `--parent <epic-id>`, a parent-child dependency is created. The epic's `dependents` field lists all children:

```bash
br show <epic-id> --json | jq '.dependents[] | select(.dependency_type == "parent-child")'
```
