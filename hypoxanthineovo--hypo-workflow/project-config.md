# Hypo-Workflow managed OpenCode instructions

This file is Hypo-Workflow managed. Edit the source Hypo-Workflow rules/config when possible, then regenerate adapters with `hypo-workflow sync --platform opencode`.

## Runtime contract

- Hypo-Workflow is not a runner.
- The OpenCode Agent performs the actual work.
- `.pipeline/` remains the source of truth for state, Cycle, Patch, rules, PROGRESS, logs, prompts, and reports.
- Use `question` for required user decisions.
- Use `todowrite` for visible plan discipline, especially in `/hw-plan*` commands.

## Protected files

Treat `.pipeline/state.yaml`, `.pipeline/cycle.yaml`, and `.pipeline/rules.yaml` as protected. Unexpected writes should be blocked or require explicit user confirmation.
