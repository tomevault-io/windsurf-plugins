When you work in an OSCAL import workspace:

- Keep original source files in `input/` unchanged.
- Maintain `source-map.csv` source traceability for every mapped OSCAL field.
- Mark uncertain mappings as `needs_review`.
- Do not invent system boundaries, control implementations, or authorization conclusions.
- Do not commit real customer SSPs, credentials, diagrams, or sensitive evidence.
- Make import summary, validation report, and unmapped or review-queue artifacts before you claim success.
- Schema-valid OSCAL is structural validation only. It is not an audit opinion.

Use `/import-legacy-ssp` or `agent-skills/oscal-document-engineering/SKILL.md` for the full workflow.
