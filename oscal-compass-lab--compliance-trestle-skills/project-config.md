description: Prefer Trestle markdown roundtrip over direct OSCAL JSON edits
---


Direct edits to OSCAL JSON or YAML in catalogs, profiles, component definitions, or SSP directories bypass the Trestle markdown authoring roundtrip.
They can cause validation or assembly issues.

Prefer:

1. `trestle author *-generate` to make markdown
2. Edit markdown with source references
3. `trestle author *-assemble` to regenerate OSCAL
4. `trestle validate -a` or `/workspace-validate`

If a direct JSON or YAML edit is intentional, continue with care and validate afterward.
Assessment plans, assessment results, and POA&M models use the JSON split and merge workflow.
See `commands/workflow/assessment-roundtrip.md` and `commands/workflow/poam-roundtrip.md`.
