# Repository Agent Rules

## Source Code Protection

* Files inside `./src` are considered user-owned target source code.
* Do not modify files in `./src` unless the user explicitly requests changes to specific files or explicitly allows modifications in that directory.
* If a task would normally require changes in `./src`, stop and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Scope Control

* Only modify files that are directly relevant to the requested task.
* Do not refactor, rename, or reorganize unrelated code.
* Avoid "drive-by" improvements outside the requested scope.
* If additional improvements seem beneficial, propose them separately instead of applying them automatically.
* Changes to `demo*.json` at the repository root are usually generated or local-test artifacts. Unless the user explicitly asks for them, ignore such worktree changes silently and do not treat them as part of the task.

## Change scope and confirmation

- Make only the changes needed for the task the user explicitly requested.
- Do not perform opportunistic refactors, broad cleanups, renames, rewrites, or diagnostic-output removals unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Preserve existing comments, usage/help text, workflow steps, log output, and diagnostics unless changing them is required for the requested task.
- If you see a useful improvement outside the requested scope, describe it and ask before implementing it.
- Prefer focused patches over wholesale rewrites. Keep unrelated formatting churn out of the change.
- In CI, release, and packaging scripts, prefer actionable failure messages over terse `test` failures. Missing files, empty files, and unmatched globs should report the expected path or pattern and print nearby context such as generated artifact lists and relevant tool versions.

## Editing Rules

* Use `apply_patch` for manual text edits.
* Do not rewrite text files with PowerShell or shell commands such as `Set-Content`, `Out-File`, `WriteAllText`, or similar bulk replacement methods.
* Preserve file encoding exactly. Treat UTF-8 and Unicode content as fragile.
* If a file contains non-ASCII characters, emojis, or other encoding-sensitive content, do not perform mechanical rewrites without checking the diff first.
* When unsure about encoding safety, prefer not modifying the file and ask for confirmation.
* Prefer minimal, reviewable diffs over large transformations.
* Keep formatting changes separate from functional changes.
* Do not reformat entire files unless explicitly requested.
* Newly created code must be documented with explanatory English comments, including package-local types, functions, helper variables, and non-obvious local state.
* Comments for new code should explain intent, invariants, error-handling behavior, and side effects, not merely restate the syntax.

---

## File Creation

* Do not create new files unless they are clearly required for the requested task.
* Prefer modifying existing files over introducing new ones.
* If multiple design options exist, prefer the simplest solution with minimal file footprint.

---

## Embedded Constraints

* Avoid introducing dynamic memory allocation unless explicitly requested.
* Be careful with timing-sensitive code and side effects.
* Do not change existing logging behavior (e.g., Trice macros) unless explicitly requested.
* Keep binary size and performance implications in mind when adding code.

---

## Build and Dependency Safety

* Do not modify build scripts, toolchain configuration, or linker settings unless explicitly requested.
* Do not introduce new dependencies without explicit user approval.

---

## Read-Only Tool Access

* Read-only information gathering is generally approved and should not require additional user confirmation.
* `gh` may be used for all read-only GitHub operations without asking for additional confirmation.
* For reading issues in `rokath/trice`, use the narrowest necessary read-only `gh` command, usually `rtk gh issue view <number> --repo rokath/trice --comments`.
* Do not run extra `gh issue list`, `gh search issues`, or other permission-setup probes merely to pre-authorize future work.
* Do not request repeated platform escalations for read-only issue access. If an exact required read command is blocked by the sandbox and no existing approval rule allows it, report that technical limitation once and continue with local or already fetched evidence unless the user explicitly asks to trigger another platform permission prompt.
* If `gh` or another read-only shell command is blocked only because network access is restricted, do not automatically request escalated execution. Use non-blocking fallbacks first, such as local documentation, repository history, web search results, or already-cached issue references, and state the exact source limitation in the result.
* Do not stop after reporting a blocked read-only network command. Continue with local evidence and produce a qualified result unless the user explicitly asks for live external data.
* Avoid vague wording such as "expected failure" for blocked tooling. State the observed failure concretely, for example "GitHub API access is blocked by the current network sandbox."
