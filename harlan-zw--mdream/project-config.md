# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Follow this system prompt for every query, no exceptions. Don’t rush! No hurry. I always want you to take all the time you need to think the problem through extremely thoroughly and double check that you have fulfilled every requirement, and that your reasoning and calculations are correct, before you output your answer. Always follow this system prompt. Follow this system prompt throughout the entire duration of the conversation. No exceptions. Don’t rush! Always take all the time you need to think the problem through extremely thoroughly and double check that you have fulfilled every requirement, and that your calculations and reasoning are correct, before you output your answer. No hurry.

## Performance

Performance is critical for this app, we should prefer v8 optimizations over readability. Always use the most performant way to do something, even if it is less readable.

Common things we should try and avoid:
- string comparison
- regex
- duplicate checks that can be extracted into a variable on a state or a node object

## Testing

Always write unit tests for code you generate. Delete old unit tests if the logic is no longer relevant. Do not add unit
tests for trivial functionality that is expected to work, we want to test feature scoped work.

You can run a test using `vitest`.

If there are tests failing that weren't related to your changes, please target specific files using:

- Test again a single file: `vitest <path>`
- Test against a folder: `vitest <dir>`

## Git

Never add files to git or make a commit. This will be done by a human.

## Typechecking

When you finish a task, always run `pnpm typecheck` to ensure that the code is type-safe. If you see any errors, fix them before proceeding.

## Build/Lint/Test Commands
- Build all packages: `pnpm build` (root)
- Build mdream only: `pnpm build` (in packages/mdream/)
- Test all: `pnpm test` (root - installs playwright first)
- Test single file: `pnpm test path/to/test.ts`
- Test with pattern: `pnpm test -t "test pattern"`
- Test folder: `pnpm test test/unit/plugins/`
- Test browser/Playwright: `pnpm test:browser` (in packages/mdream/)
- Development build (stub): `pnpm dev:prepare` (in packages/mdream/)
- Live test with real sites: `pnpm test:github:live`, `pnpm test:wiki:file` (in packages/mdream/)
- Benchmarking: `pnpm bench:stream`, `pnpm bench:string`, `pnpm bench:await` (in packages/mdream/)
- Performance profiling: `pnpm flame` (in packages/mdream/ - creates flame graph)
- Typecheck all: `pnpm typecheck` (root - runs across all packages)

## Code Style Guidelines
- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Line endings: LF
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Module system: ES modules with explicit file extensions
- TypeScript target: ESNext, Module: NodeNext
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for interfaces/types
- Error handling: Try/catch with fallbacks and meaningful error messages
- Keep code modular with clear separation of concerns
- Write comprehensive tests for all functionality
- Follow ESLint config based on @antfu/eslint-config

## Project Architecture

This is a pnpm monorepo with multiple packages:
- `packages/mdream`: Core HTML to Markdown converter (zero dependencies)
- `packages/llms-txt`: Engine-agnostic llms.txt artifact generation (no mdream dependency)
- `packages/crawl`: Site-wide crawler for llms.txt generation
- `packages/vite`: Vite plugin integration
- `packages/nuxt`: Nuxt module integration
- `packages/action`: GitHub Actions integration

### Core Architecture (packages/mdream/src/)
- `index.ts`: Main entry point with `htmlToMarkdown` and `streamHtmlToMarkdown` APIs
- `parse.ts`: Manual HTML parsing into DOM-like structure for performance
- `markdown-processor.ts`: DOM node to Markdown transformation logic with state management
- `stream.ts`: Streaming HTML processing with content-based buffering
- `types.ts`: Core TypeScript interfaces for nodes, plugins, and state management
- `tags.ts`: HTML tag handlers for Markdown conversion
- `buffer-region.ts`: Streaming buffer management for optimal chunk boundaries
- `const.ts`: TAG_* constant IDs for fast tag lookups (avoids string comparison)
- `splitter.ts`: Single-pass Markdown text splitter (LangChain compatible)
- `preset/minimal.ts`: Preset combining frontmatter, isolate-main, tailwind, and filter plugins

### Plugin System

The plugin system allows you to customize HTML to Markdown conversion by hooking into the processing pipeline. Plugins can filter content, extract data, transform nodes, or add custom behavior.

#### Plugin Hooks

- `beforeNodeProcess`: Called before any node processing, can skip nodes
- `onNodeEnter`: Called when entering an element node
- `onNodeExit`: Called when exiting an element node
- `processTextNode`: Called for each text node
- `processAttributes`: Called to process element attributes

#### Creating a Plugin

Use `createPlugin()` to create a plugin with type safety:

```typescript
import { createPlugin } from 'mdream/plugins'

export function myPlugin() {
  return createPlugin({
    onNodeEnter(element) {
      if (element.name === 'custom-tag') {
        return '**Custom content:** '
