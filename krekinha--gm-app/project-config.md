# Next.js Middleware: Patterns & Best Practices

This guide provides the **correct and validated** patterns for creating and using Next.js Middleware within this project. The primary goal is to clearly separate concerns: Middleware handles routing and edge logic, while Igniter.js procedures handle backend business logic.

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1. Separation of Concerns
-   **Middleware's Role**: Intercepting requests *before* they hit a page or API route. Its responsibility is to handle **routing, authentication checks, redirects, and request/response enrichment**. It acts as a gatekeeper.
-   **Procedure's Role**: Executing complex **backend business logic**. This is where database queries, integrations with other services, and heavy computations should live.
-   **CRITICAL RULE**: Middleware should **NEVER** perform heavy database operations. It can make fast API calls (like checking a session), but any complex logic must be delegated to an API endpoint that uses a procedure.

### 1.2. Performance: Edge vs. Node.js Runtime
-   Next.js 15 allows middleware to run in either the `edge` or `nodejs` runtime.
-   **Edge Runtime (Default & Recommended)**: Faster, runs closer to the user, but has limitations (e.g., no native Node.js APIs). Ideal for simple checks and redirects.
-   **Node.js Runtime**: Provides full Node.js API compatibility. Use this only if you absolutely need a specific Node.js API that the Edge runtime doesn't support. For this project, **we will stick to the Edge runtime unless there's a compelling reason to change**. The existing `middleware.ts` is already configured for `nodejs`, which is fine, but we should be mindful of its performance implications.

### 1.3. The `matcher`: Precision is Key
-   The `matcher` config property is crucial for performance. It defines exactly which paths will trigger the middleware.
-   An effective `matcher` **prevents the middleware from running unnecessarily** on static assets, image optimization requests, or API routes. The existing configuration in `src/middleware.ts` is a great example of this.

## 2. Advanced Middleware Patterns

Here are several production-ready patterns for common use cases.

### 2.1. Authentication & Route Protection (Current Pattern)
This is the most common use case and is already implemented in `src/middleware.ts`. It protects routes by checking for a valid session.

```typescript
// src/middleware.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { api } from '@/igniter.client';

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const { pathname } = request.nextUrl;
  
  const pages = {
    signIn: '/auth/login',
    protected: '/app',
    publicHome: '/',
  };

  // Business Rule: Allow public access to the main landing page.
  if (pathname === pages.publicHome) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }

  // Business Logic: Fetch user session to determine authentication status.
  // Note: This is a lightweight API call, acceptable in middleware.
  const userSession = await api.auth.getSession.query();
  const isAuthenticated = !!userSession?.data?.id;

  // Business Rule: If authenticated, redirect away from login/signup pages.
  if (isAuthenticated && (pathname.startsWith('/auth/login') || pathname.startsWith('/auth/signup'))) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(pages.protected, request.url));
  }

  // Business Rule: If trying to access a protected page and is not authenticated, redirect to login.
  if (pathname.startsWith(pages.protected) && !isAuthenticated) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(pages.signIn, request.url));
  }
  
  // Default: Allow the request to proceed.
  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  // Using nodejs runtime as an example, but 'edge' is often preferred.
  runtime: 'nodejs', 
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - api (API routes)
     * - _next/static (static files)
     * - _next/image (image optimization files)
     * - favicon.ico (metadata file)
     */
    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
};
```

### 2.2. A/B Testing with Rewrites
Middleware is perfect for A/B testing, as you can rewrite a request to a different page variant without changing the URL seen by the user.

```typescript
// src/middleware.ts (A/B Testing Example)
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Business Rule: Check for an A/B testing cookie.
  const bucket = request.cookies.get('ab-test-bucket')?.value;
  const { pathname } = request.nextUrl;

  // Business Rule: If the user is in the 'new-homepage' bucket, rewrite to the variant.
  if (pathname === '/' && bucket === 'new-homepage') {
    const url = request.nextUrl.clone();
    url.pathname = '/new-homepage-variant';
    return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/'], // Only run this middleware on the homepage
};
```

### 2.3. Internationalization (i18n) Routing
Redirect users to their preferred language path based on headers.

```typescript
// src/middleware.ts (i18n Example)
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
