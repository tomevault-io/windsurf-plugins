# Expo Desktop

This is a project to bring best-effort support for react-native-macos and react-native-windows to Expo in userland. It includes a CLI (analogous to `@expo/cli`), and ports of the CLI's internal logic like `@expo/config-plugins` and `@expo-prebuild-config` to support desktop platforms.

```

`expo-desktop` is written in TS for Node.js v24, using ESM, distributed as JS. `expo-desktop-config-plugins` and `expo-desktop-prebuild-config` are both written in JS, using CommonJS, with types inscribed via JSDoc (but distributed via emitting to `.d.ts` files using `node --run build`).

## Installation

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Development workflow

To run the `create-app` command locally:

```sh
cd apps/expo-desktop

# (1) Resolve the `workspace:` and `catalog:` protocols in our monorepo packages
#     so that we can install them via `file:` to do local development. Avoids
#     having to publish to npm to test. Don't commit the changes to package.json
#     caused by this command.
pnpm -w run flatten:y

# (2) If you have a MyApp folder from a previous run that you want to clean up:
rm -rf MyApp*

# (3) Run the `create-app` command in local dev mode.
node --run start -- create-app --local-dev

# (4) To clean up after having flattened the protocols earlier.
pnpm -w run flatten:n
```

## Developing

### Validating changes

After any change:

```sh
# 1. From the base of the monorepo, run the formatting:
node --run format

# 2. From the changed project, generate types to typecheck:
node --run build
```

### Philosophy

- Avoid pulling in new deps whenever possible; prefer to use whatever the Node.js v24 SDK includes.
- This is supposed to match the Expo CLI's behaviour as closely as possible, so don't cut corners. Study the latest Expo CLI [source](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/%40expo/cli) to inform changes.
