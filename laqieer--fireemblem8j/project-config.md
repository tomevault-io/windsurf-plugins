# Copilot instructions

This repository is a byte-perfect decompilation of Fire Emblem: Seima no Kouseki
(FE8 Japanese, game code `BE8J`). The goal is to replace the raw-ROM baseline
with real `src/` C and descriptive `asm/`/data while keeping `make compare`
ending in `fireemblem8.gba: OK`.

## Build and verification commands

- `make compare` builds `fireemblem8.gba` from committed source and checks its
  SHA-1 against `checksum.sha1`. This is the project oracle. `baserom.gba` is
  **NOT required** — the build is self-contained (0 `.incbin "baserom.gba"`, 100%);
  it needs only `binutils-arm-none-eabi` and, for C, `tools/agbcc`. A local
  `baserom.gba` (SHA-1 `7da0456035366aa18414faa79d8fe7649f03c1ed`) is optional,
  used only by RE/diff tooling (asm-differ/objdiff, decomp-permuter, IDA/Ghidra).
- First-time Ubuntu setup mirrors CI: install `build-essential`,
  `binutils-arm-none-eabi`, and `libpng-dev`, then clone `pret/agbcc` and run
  `./build.sh && ./install.sh ..` so the compiler lands in `tools/agbcc`.
- `make layout` regenerates `ldscript.txt`, `asm/baserom.s`, and
  `asm/jp_syms.s` from the `layout/` manifests. Use `make layout && make compare`
  after adding or changing carve manifest rows.
- `make clean && make compare` is the durable full rebuild check for nontrivial
  carve/integration work.
- Single-unit/symbol iteration commands:
  - `tools/objdiff/objdiff-cli diff -p . -u rng` diffs a configured unit from
    `objdiff.json`.
  - `tools/objdiff/objdiff-cli diff -1 <target.o> -2 src/<unit>.o <Symbol> -o - --format json`
    diffs one symbol when a target object exists.
  - `$HOME/asm-differ-venv/bin/python tools/asm-differ/diff.py -mw 0x<START> 0x<END>`
    watches a raw function range; `START`/`END` are ROM file offsets
    (`VMA - 0x08000000`).
- `make ida-db` rebuilds `tools/ida/fe8j.i64`; `make ghidra-db` rebuilds the
  cached Ghidra project after meaningful symbol/layout progress.

## Architecture and data flow

- The project starts from an incbin baseline: generated `asm/baserom.s` covers
  all ROM bytes not yet represented by real source. Carved ROM sections in
  `layout/carved_rom.tsv` and `layout/carved_rom.d/*.tsv` are spliced into the
  linker script ahead of the remaining incbin gaps.
- `scripts/gen_layout.py` is the source of truth for generated glue. Do not
  hand-edit or commit `ldscript.txt`, `asm/baserom.s`, or `asm/jp_syms.s`; they
  are gitignored build artifacts regenerated from manifests.
- `layout/carved_rom.tsv` stores ROM file offsets and section specs.
  `layout/carved_ram.tsv` places RAM/NOLOAD sections at JP addresses so literals
  resolve correctly. `layout/baseline_syms.tsv` defines symbols still inside the
  raw baseline; use typed `thumb`, `arm`, or `data` entries so the linker avoids
  bad interwork veneers.
- The sibling US decomp at `../fireemblem8u` is the primary reference for source,
  headers, maps, and scripts. Most US C recompiles byte-identically once placed at
  JP addresses; true JP differences are concentrated in text/font/glyph/menu/save
  code and JP data.
- The C build pipeline is `cpp -> iconv UTF-8 to CP932 -> agbcc -O2
  -mthumb-interwork -fhex-asm -> arm-none-eabi-as`, then
  `arm-none-eabi-ld -T ldscript.txt`. Preserve the CP932 conversion when adding
  compiler/permuter tooling.
- CI `ci.yml` runs `make compare` on every push to `main` and pull request, with
  `baserom.gba` **absent** and no `BASEROM_URL` secret — building from committed
  source and matching `checksum.sha1` is simultaneously the byte-match and
  self-containment gate. `decomp-dev.yml` computes progress from manifests and built
  `src/*.o` without needing the ROM.

## MCP servers

Configure Copilot CLI with the local reverse-engineering MCP servers in
`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ida": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "/home/laqieer/ida-mcp-venv/bin/idalib-mcp",
      "args": ["--stdio"],
      "env": {
        "IDADIR": "/home/laqieer/ida-pro-9.3"
      },
      "tools": ["*"],
      "timeout": 180000
    },
    "ghidra": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "/home/laqieer/fireemblem8j/scripts/ghidra/pyghidra_mcp_router.sh",
      "args": [
        "--project-path",
        "/home/laqieer/ghidra-projects",
        "--project-name",
        "fe8j-cp",
        "--wait-for-analysis"
      ],
      "env": {
        "JAVA_HOME": "/home/laqieer/ghidra-tools/jdk-21.0.11+10",
        "GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR": "/home/laqieer/ghidra-tools/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC"
      },
      "tools": ["*"],
      "timeout": 300000
    }
  }
}
```

For IDA, start `idalib-mcp` without passing `tools/ida/fe8j.i64`; open the
database later with `idb_open(input_path="tools/ida/fe8j.i64",
mode="force_headless")` and pass the returned session id as `database` to worker
tools. If `idb_open` fails because stale sidecar files are held, inspect the
specific idalib worker PID before terminating it.

**Ghidra uses a separate project `fe8j-cp`, not `fe8j`, for Copilot.** A Ghidra
project takes an exclusive lock while open, so Copilot and Claude Code cannot
serve the *same* project at once (the second `pyghidra-mcp` fails with
"Connection closed"). Claude holds `fe8j`; Copilot gets an isolated clone
