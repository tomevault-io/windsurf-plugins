## Project Overview

This repository contains a DuckDB extension for querying Lance format datasets (including scan, vector search, and full-text search). The DuckDB integration is implemented in C++ (under `src/`) and links a Rust static library (`lance_duckdb_ffi`) that uses the Lance Rust crate and exports data via the Arrow C Data Interface.

## Documentation Language

All documentation in this repository (including `README.md` and files under `docs/`) must be written in English.

## Constraint Hierarchy (Highest Priority)

For any planning, implementation, review, or refactor work in this repository:

- The only hard constraints are upstream DuckDB requirements and upstream Lance requirements.
- If any repository-local guidance conflicts with DuckDB or Lance behavior/contracts, follow DuckDB/Lance.
- Any decision made inside `lance-duckdb` (APIs/ABIs, FFI boundaries, internal formats, module boundaries, naming, testing conventions, or implementation strategies) is mutable and may be changed when a better design is found.
- Treat repository-local rules in this document as default guidance, not immutable policy.

## Deliverable & Compatibility Policy

This project is delivered as a fully self-contained DuckDB extension artifact (statically linked in our distribution). Low-level APIs/ABIs/formats in this repository (C++/Rust FFI boundaries, internal encodings, file/IPC formats, etc.) are strictly internal implementation details:

- They are not intended to be directly consumed by end users.
- There are no external downstream users that depend on them.
- Prioritize first principles and the most direct correct design; do not optimize for migrations or compatibility unless explicitly requested.
- Compatibility commitments are driven by DuckDB/Lance behavior, not by historical repository-local decisions.
- User-facing contracts should be defined at the SQL surface.

## Public Surface Policy (SQL-First)

Expose user-facing capabilities primarily through SQL, not internal helper functions.

- Default: expose features via DuckDB SQL mechanisms (replacement scan, `ATTACH ... (TYPE LANCE)`, standard DDL/DML, and `COPY ... (FORMAT lance)`).
- Internal functions may exist for implementation/composition, but should not be the primary user-facing entry points.
- Narrow exceptions are allowed when a dedicated function is the clearest SQL contract (for example, `lance_fts` and similar search entry points).

When in doubt, prefer SQL surface area that matches DuckDB idioms over extension-specific internal entry points.

## Reuse Upstream Mechanisms First

Prefer DuckDB/Lance native mechanisms over extension-specific replacements.

- Before adding a new mechanism, first check whether DuckDB or Lance already provides the required hook, lifecycle, cache, profiling surface, or introspection path.
- If an upstream mechanism can satisfy the requirement with reasonable adaptation, use it instead of inventing a parallel extension-specific mechanism.
- Prefer integration with DuckDB-native observability surfaces such as profiling, `EXPLAIN`, and catalog/state hooks over custom debug-only SQL functions.
- Introduce new extension-specific mechanisms only when upstream surfaces cannot express the requirement cleanly, and document why reuse was insufficient.

## Essential Commands

### Building
```bash
# Initial setup (only needed once)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build commands (provided by DuckDB extension tooling from `extension-ci-tools`)
make
GEN=ninja make release
GEN=ninja make debug
GEN=ninja make clean
GEN=ninja make clean_all

# Rust-only checks (without a full DuckDB/CMake build)
cargo check --manifest-path Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path Cargo.toml --all-targets
```

### Formatting

This repository is configured with `uv`, so you can run formatting via:

```bash
uv run make format
```

PR requirement: Before submitting a PR, run `uv run make format` and commit any resulting formatting changes (as a separate commit if it helps review).

### Commit & PR Conventions

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type[(scope)]: short description
```

- **Common types**: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `ci`, `test`, `chore`.
- **Scope** is optional. When present, use the affected module (e.g. `search`, `resolver`, `scan`).
- Use `!` suffix for breaking changes (e.g. `refactor!: ...`).
- PR numbers are appended automatically by GitHub on merge (e.g. `(#153)`).

### Testing

The `release` build can be slow. For fast iteration, prefer `test_debug` when available.

```bash
# Run all tests (builds and runs sqllogictest)
GEN=ninja make test

# Run with specific build
GEN=ninja make test_debug     # Test with debug build
GEN=ninja make test_release   # Test with release build

# Run DuckDB with extension for manual testing
./build/release/duckdb -c "SELECT * FROM 'test/data/test_data.lance' LIMIT 1;"

# Or load the loadable extension from a standalone DuckDB binary
