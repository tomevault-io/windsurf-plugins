# AGENTS.md — Instantly Starter Kit

You are a coding agent helping a developer build a **wrapper service** on top of Instantly. This file is your always-on map: what the kit is, which API group does what, the rules that matter, and the flow to follow. Route into [`docs/api/`](docs/api) for per-group detail and [`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md) for the cross-cutting rules — don't restate them here.

## What this kit is

- **SDK (runtime):** typed clients in [`js/sdk`](js/sdk) and [`python/sdk`](python/sdk), both generated from [`spec/openapi.yaml`](spec/openapi.yaml). The wrapper service imports the SDK. Covers all 28 API groups.
- **Docs + this file (build-time):** the agent layer that helps you build. Not shipped into the user's runtime.
- **Templates** ([`js/templates`](js/templates)) and **examples** ([`js/examples`](js/examples) / [`python/examples`](python/examples)) to fork and copy.
- **No CLI.** Wrapper services import the SDK; they don't run a CLI.

The user uses Instantly for the email/deliverability/inbox/analytics backend and adds their own audience, logic, and UI on top.

## Guided build flow

1. **Ask what they're building** — a thin wrapper, a sync system, an admin tool, or an opinionated workflow service? What's the core job?
2. **Classify** into one or more families (see the map below): campaign orchestration · lead/list management · reply/webhook sync · OAuth account connection · analytics/diagnostics · deliverability/enrichment · workspace/admin.
3. **Load the relevant [`docs/api/*`](docs/api)** for those families — that's where the real operations, shapes, and gotchas live.
4. **Plan the wrapper** — name the operations and flow before writing code; propose the architecture.
5. **Scaffold from the closest [template](js/templates)** rather than greenfield.
6. **Build against the SDK** — compose your business logic around SDK calls; keep the wrapper thin.
7. **Verify** — run the flow; check sending status / job completion; handle errors.

## API-group map (28 groups)

The 10 **bold** files are the goal-first guides in [`docs/api/`](docs/api); the rest are covered via conventions/reference.

**Outreach Execution** — [**campaigns**](docs/api/campaigns.md) (`campaign`, `campaignsubsequence`) · [**leads**](docs/api/leads.md) (`lead`, `leadlist`, `leadlabel`) · [**emails**](docs/api/emails.md) (`email`) · `account` → [**accounts**](docs/api/accounts.md) · `accountcampaignmapping`.
**Deliverability & Enrichment** — [**enrichment**](docs/api/enrichment.md) (`supersearchenrichment`) · [**verification**](docs/api/verification.md) (`emailverification`) · [**deliverability**](docs/api/deliverability.md) (warmup, `inboxplacementtest` / `inboxplacementanalytics` / `inboxplacementblacklistandspamassassinreport`) · `blocklistentry`.
**Integrations & Events** — [**webhooks**](docs/api/webhooks.md) (`webhook`, `webhookevent`) · `oauth` → [**accounts**](docs/api/accounts.md).
**Analytics** — campaign + account analytics ops → [**analytics**](docs/api/analytics.md).
**Workspace & Admin** — [**workspaces**](docs/api/workspaces.md) (`workspace`, `workspacemember`, `workspacegroupmember`, `workspacebilling`) · `apikey`, `crmactions`.
**Operations & Diagnostics** — `backgroundjob` (poll async jobs), `auditlog`.
**Support** — `customtag`, `customtagmapping`, `dfyemailaccountorder`.

Every group + operation (all 28 / 168) is in [`spec/openapi.yaml`](spec/openapi.yaml) — consult it for any group not covered by a `docs/api/*` guide.
