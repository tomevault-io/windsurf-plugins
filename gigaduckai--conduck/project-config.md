# Working in this repository

This repository is the whole Conduck app for Apple platforms — iPhone, iPad,
Mac, Apple Watch and CarPlay — and no functional code is held back — what is not here is the real brand artwork, the signing identity, and Apple's per-team CarPlay entitlement, none of which is code. It is
a native client for an AI the user brings: a gateway they run themselves, or a
hosted model under their own key. There is no server of ours anywhere in it.

This file is a router. It tells you what to read, how to run the tests, and what
a passing run does not prove. Everything else is in the documents it points at,
and those are the copy of record.

## Read these, in this order

1. [`README.md`](README.md), then the
   [glossary](CONTRIBUTING.md#the-words-this-project-uses) in
   `CONTRIBUTING.md` — not optional. Several words here are narrower than their
   industry sense and *gateway* is nearly the opposite one, so skipping it means
   consistently misreading which layer a decision is about.
2. [`docs/ai-context/spec.md`](docs/ai-context/spec.md) — the decisions, the
   boundaries, and the alternatives that were deliberately rejected. It is the
   part the code cannot tell you. Read the sections bearing on the change you
   are making: the bulk of the file is one heading per decision, and the
   sections around it cover a turn end to end, where the surfaces differ, what
   leaves the device, and what is frozen — the heading list is enough to find
   the ones you need.
3. [`docs/ai-context/project-structure.md`](docs/ai-context/project-structure.md)
   — the folder and build-target map, ending in a "Where to start" table that
   takes a kind of change to a directory.
4. [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — what a change has to satisfy before it
   can land: the licence header, the sign-off, the header comment every source
   file carries, the logging rule, and the two prohibitions on adding to the
   documents above.

Then read the file you are about to change, and its tests. **Every source file
opens with a header comment** saying what it is for and, where the design is not
self-evident, why it is that way — the constraint being worked around, the
approach that did not work, the thing that breaks if someone simplifies it. The
two architecture documents deliberately do not describe individual files, so
that header is where the detail lives, and the test suite is the other half of
it.

## Running the tests

Choose verification for the changed behavior. The full-suite commands below are
recipes, not a requirement for every edit. Prefer affected tests and one relevant
build; skip unrelated platforms and targets. Review docs, copy and styling with
lightweight checks. Consolidate fixes before expensive builds, reuse passing
results, and rerun only affected checks after a correction. Independent reviewers
should use existing test evidence and investigate specific gaps instead of
repeating the same suite. Full suites and multiple Release builds belong to
explicit release gates or concrete broad regression risks. Stop once the chosen
checks pass and actionable findings are resolved.

Two simulator suites, both run from the repository root.
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#running-tests) covers the same ground for a
human contributor and adds the one suite these commands do not reach; the
commands themselves are repeated here so that running the tests never costs you
a second file.

Pick real simulators first — device names change with every Xcode release, so
drive the destinations by UDID rather than by name:

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices available
```

Take an iPhone UDID and an Apple Watch UDID out of that listing, then:

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project Conduck/Conduck.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Conduck \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<iphone-simulator-udid>' \
  -test-timeouts-enabled YES \
  -default-test-execution-time-allowance 120 \
  -maximum-test-execution-time-allowance 120
```

The timeout flags cover ONE failure mode: a single test that runs long gets
killed and named, instead of stalling the run. `-default-…` is the load-bearing
half — `-maximum-…` only clamps a test's OWN preferred allowance, and no test
here declares one, so passing the maximum alone bounds nothing and every test
keeps the 600 s default.

They do NOT catch every hang. A host that wedges before a test starts, or one
whose dispatch pool is exhausted (the in-process timeout machinery cannot be
scheduled either), still goes silent — `xcodebuild` waits on it indefinitely and
a hang is indistinguishable from a long run. The wall-clock guard that actually
catches those is the CI job's own `timeout-minutes`. Locally, the tell is a log
that stops growing while the process stays alive: `sample <pid>` settles it.

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project Conduck/Conduck.xcodeproj \
  -scheme ConduckWatchTests \
  -destination 'platform=watchOS Simulator,id=<watch-simulator-udid>' \
  -test-timeouts-enabled YES \
  -default-test-execution-time-allowance 120 \
  -maximum-test-execution-time-allowance 120
```

The main suite belongs on an iOS Simulator and nowhere else; `spec.md` explains
why running it against macOS kills the test host intermittently, and takes a
different suite down each time.
