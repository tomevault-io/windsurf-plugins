We are building a project to showcase the speed and interactivity of MotherDuck in a web application. As such, we are prioritizing performance, scalability, and user experience.

Please find the following resources useful:
- MotherDuck WASM Client Documentation: https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/data-apps/wasm-client/

Lets talk about how data flows in this app. We have a TypeScript ingestion pipeline in scripts/ingest/ that fetches data from PBPStats APIs and loads it into MotherDuck. Run it with `npm run ingest`. For the web application, we authenticate to MotherDuck and then use the MotherDuck WASM client to query the data and persist it in a local DB in the browser. This database should be used by all pages in the app, and only queries to motherduck should be made inside the dataloader class.

It is totally fine to use regular DuckDB in the backend. If you want to use it, please use the following resources:
- DuckDB Documentation: https://duckdb.org/docs/
- DuckDB CLI: https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/cli

Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix.

To check data in MotherDuck, use this in the terminal: `duckdb "md:nba_box_scores_v2?attach_mode=single" -c "<your query>"`

When you need to reference a temp table, just reference the underlying table directly.
