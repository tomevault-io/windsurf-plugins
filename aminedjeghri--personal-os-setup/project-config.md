This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. The canonical cross-agent rules are imported from `AGENTS.md` above; this file adds Claude Code-specific depth.

## Architecture

### OS/distro detection → package catalog → UI

`detect_os.py` is the entry point for environment awareness:
- `detect_os()` returns an `OSInfo(family, distro, info)` — family is `windows`/`darwin`/`linux`/`unknown`; on Linux, `distro` comes from `/etc/os-release` `ID` (e.g. `ubuntu`, `cachyos`), and WSL is detected separately (`_is_wsl()`, checks `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop` or `/proc/version`).
- `build_packages_for_os()` loads `src/personal_os_setup/config/packages.yaml` (the single source of truth for installable packages, keyed by distro → manager → category → package list) and filters it to the current distro via `PackageCatalog.for_distro()`, producing a flat list of `PackageRef(name, manager, category)`.

### Package managers (`tasks/managers/`)

Each backend (apt, snap, brew/cask, winget, msstore, pacman/paru, webinstall) implements the `PackageManager` protocol in `tasks/managers/base.py`: `is_installed`, `install`, `update`, `upgrade`, `cleanup`. `tasks/factory.py` maps `(distro, manager_name)` → manager class in `_PACKAGE_MANAGER_FACTORY_BY_DISTRO`, and `_UI_VISIBLE_MANAGERS_BY_DISTRO` controls which managers are surfaced in the UI per distro (e.g. only `apt` shown for Ubuntu even though `snap`/`webinstall` also exist) to avoid duplicate buttons.

`tasks/managers/_shared.py` centralizes result-construction boilerplate reused across backends: `command_details()`/`format_failed_command()` (stdout/stderr → details text), `sudo_required_task_result()`/`sudo_required_install_result()`, `missing_executable_task_result()`/`missing_executable_install_result()`, and `winget_path()`/`winget_list_shows_installed()` (shared by the winget and msstore backends). Each manager still calls `shutil.which(...)`/`sudo_non_interactive_ok()` itself (not through `_shared.py`) so unit tests can keep patching those checks at the manager's own module path — `_shared.py` only builds the resulting `TaskResult`/`InstallResult` once the check has failed. Follow this pattern (local check, shared result-builder) when adding a new manager rather than re-deriving the boilerplate.

### System actions (`tasks/factory.py::get_system_action_sections`)

This function is the other half of the factory: given `(system, distro, info)` it builds an ordered list of `(section_name, [SystemAction])` used to render tabs/buttons in the TUI. It composes small per-domain builder functions (`_package_manager_sections`, `_start_section`, `_dotfiles_section`, `_docker_section`, `_nvidia_section`, `_wsl_section`, `_advanced_wsl_section`, `_windows_utilities_section`), each returning one `Section` (a `(name, [SystemAction])` tuple) and independently unit-tested in `tests/unit/test_factory.py`. `_start_section` ("🚀 Start" tab) returns only the two doc-link actions — the onboarding walkthrough text itself is frontend-only markdown (`app.py::_START_GUIDE_MARKDOWN`), special-cased in `compose()` the same way the dotfiles tree is. Sections are assembled conditionally based on `system`/`distro` (e.g. zsh/chezmoi/docker sections only for linux+darwin, WSL sections only for windows, NVIDIA section for windows+linux). `SystemAction` supports plain actions (`run`), prompted actions that take free-text input (`run_with_prompt` + `prompt_label`/`prompt_initial`), destructive-action confirmation (`confirm`/`confirm_message`), and file backup before mutating config (`backup_target`). When adding a new system action, add it to (or add a new) per-domain builder function rather than wiring buttons directly in the frontend.

### Task execution model

`tasks/task.py` defines the generic `Task`/`TaskResult`/`run_tasks()` primitives (idempotent check → run, catch-and-report exceptions as failed `TaskResult`s) used by some system tasks; individual `SystemAction.run` callables in the factory return `TaskResult` directly and are invoked from the UI without going through `run_tasks`.

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

Built on [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) (`textual`), not a web/GUI framework:
