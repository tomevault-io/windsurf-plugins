# DOTFILES AGENTS

Repository-specific instructions for coding agents working in this public dotfiles repo.

Keep shared cross-project agent behaviour in the global `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`. This file should only describe this repo's source layout, stow workflow, repo-local commands, and validation expectations. Don't catalogue skills or commands here: skills self-document via their injected `description`, commands via their frontmatter and the generated docs reference. Keep only repo facts and routing those don't capture.

## Scope

- This repo is the public dotfiles source at `~/.config/dotfiles`.
- Make changes here (not in `~/.config/*` live paths directly).
- Treat private overlays as optional and separate (`~/.config/dotfiles-private`).
- Keep personal machine checks, browser extension checks, private package manifests, and other user-specific data in `~/.config/dotfiles-private`; the public repo should only contain the reusable logic that reads those private configs.
- When following `@` project references, look for the matching checkout under `~/repos` before editing. If it exists there, that is the correct source path to change.
- The standalone `context` and `notes` repositories are independent products. Dotfiles may install them and consume their public CLI/MCP interfaces, but must not add dotfiles-owned behaviour, analytics, environment variables, or integration contracts to those repositories. Keep observation and orchestration in dotfiles unless a change is independently justified by the standalone product itself.

## Private Repositories

- Repository induction defaults live in optional private `dot-git-presets.yml`; shared code must not hardcode personal schedules or name prefixes.
- Git web browser commands and per-repository selections live in private `dot-git.yml`; the Git panel passes repository context and browser overrides to the shared CLI resolver.
- Repository `opencode_mcp` lists in private `dot-git.yml` select MCP opt-ins. `dot mcp-sync` owns the generated, Git-ignored `.opencode/opencode.jsonc` files in those checkouts.

- The global "Private Repos And Files" policy governs the public/private split and the git-remote visibility check; this repo just consumes it, reading optional private config such as `dot-git.yml`, `.dot-browser-checks`, and private package config files.

## Key Paths

- Main entrypoint: `scripts/.local/bin/dot` (compiled binary from `dot/src/`)
- Source: `dot/` (Bun + Effect v4 CLI; excluded from stow)
- TypeScript tests: `dot/tests/` (excluded from stow; usually empty)
- Repository tests: `tests/` (excluded from stow)
- Docs site: `docs/` (Blume, bun; excluded from stow; deploys to `dotfiles.timmo.dev`)
- Stow config: `.stowrc`
- Readme: `README.md` (slim pointer; links to the docs site, which is the canonical human documentation)
- OpenCode config source: `agents/.config/opencode/`
- Skills source: [`timmo001/skills`](https://github.com/timmo001/skills), pinned at `agents/.agents/skills/` and stowed to `~/.agents/skills/`
- Published OpenCode config: [`timmo001/opencode-config`](https://github.com/timmo001/opencode-config)

## Tooling

- The whole project is driven by **mise**. The single root `mise.toml` pins the toolchain (`node`, `bun`) and defines every dev task, including the root `lint` task and project namespaces (`dot:*`, `docs:*`, and `tests:*`). Prefer `mise run <task>` (for example `mise run lint`, `mise run dot:build`, `mise run docs:check`, or `mise run tests:integration`) as the canonical interface; `mise tasks` lists them.
- `mise.toml` is the source of truth for tool versions even without mise: anyone not using mise must still use the pinned versions and the same underlying commands each task wraps (do not substitute other versions or a different toolchain).
- The package manager and runtime is **bun** for every JS/TS package (`dot/` and `docs/`). Do not use npm, pnpm, or yarn for install, lockfile, or script commands. Use `bun install`, `bun add`, `bun update`, `bun run`, and `bunx` (or the `mise run` task wrappers).
- The tracked lockfile is `bun.lock` in each package (`dot/bun.lock`, `docs/bun.lock`); commit it after any dependency change. CI runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile` against it.
- Keep Renovate update grouping limited to standard presets except for the coordinated Effect runtime and OpenCode 2 packages in `renovate.json`. Keep Effect compiler tooling outside the runtime group.

## OpenCode Assets

- For human-written command names and command/docs prose in this repo, prefer UK spelling. Keep upstream tool, API, or MCP names unchanged when they use US spelling.
- `agents/.config/opencode/` contains the shared OpenCode config source published from this repo.
- `agents/.config/opencode/lib/` contains shared plugin support modules. Relative plugin imports must resolve before publication.
