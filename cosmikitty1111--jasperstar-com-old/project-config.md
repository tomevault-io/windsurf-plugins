# AI Assistant Reminders

## Terminal Working Directory
**IMPORTANT**: Always run project-specific commands from the project root directory using the absolute path.

**Project Root**: `E:\Code Projects\jasperstar.com`

When running commands like `git status`, `npm install`, or any project-specific commands, ensure you're in the correct directory by either:
1. Using `cd "E:\Code Projects\jasperstar.com" && [command]`
2. Or verifying the current working directory is correct before running commands

This is necessary because the AI assistant tool may not always default to the workspace root, even with `.vscode/settings.json` configured.
