# Generated Analysis Artifacts → `.agents/artifacts/` (never the public repo)

Any **AI-generated** analysis, investigation, audit, feature-gap, research,
resume/handoff, or scratch working document **must** be written to
`.agents/artifacts/` — a **private, nested git repository** that is gitignored
by the main repo (`.gitignore` → `.agents/artifacts/`). These artifacts must
**never** be committed to the public `rlm-base-dev` repository.

## Rule

- ✅ Write generated analysis docs to `.agents/artifacts/<name>.md`.
- ❌ Do **not** create them under `docs/analysis/`, `docs/`, repo root, or any
  other path tracked by the main repo.
- If you find a generated artifact tracked in the public repo, move it:
  `cp docs/analysis/<f>.md .agents/artifacts/<f>.md && git rm -f docs/analysis/<f>.md`,
  and update any references to point at the `.agents/artifacts/` path.

## Distinction

- `docs/analysis/` is reserved for **curated, intentional, human-authored**
  technical analysis that is part of the product documentation. Do not add new
  agent-generated working docs there. When unsure whether a doc is "curated" vs
  "generated working artifact," treat it as a generated artifact and put it in
  `.agents/artifacts/`.
- `.agents/artifacts/` is for **agent working output**: investigations, audit
  findings, cross-validation reports, feature-gap notes, resume/handoff notes,
  experiment reports, etc.

## Example

```
# ❌ BAD — public, tracked by main repo
docs/analysis/collections-ux-baseline-feature-gaps.md

# ✅ GOOD — private nested repo, gitignored by main
.agents/artifacts/collections-ux-baseline-feature-gaps.md
```
