# SFDMU v5 export.json Rules

## DO NOT

- Change `Upsert` to `Insert+deleteOldData` without user approval
- Use `$$Field1$Field2` in `externalId` (v4 syntax — use `;`)
- Leave empty CSVs without `excluded: true`
- Put child objects before parent objects in the `objects` array

## externalId Format
- Use `;` delimiters: `Field1;Field2` — NOT `$$Field1$Field2` (v4 syntax)
- Relationship traversals: `Parent.Field` (1-hop), `GrandParent.Parent.Field` (2-hop)

## Operation Selection
- **Upsert**: the default — works for direct fields AND relationship-traversal externalIds on the **5.6.4+ floor** (Bugs 3/5 fixed)
- **Insert + deleteOldData: true**: NOT required for traversal externalIds on 5.6.4+ (that was the pre-5.6.4 workaround). Existing plans still carrying it migrate under the gated `sfdmu-v5-optimization` initiative, not ad hoc.
- **Update**: Modifying existing records only
- **Readonly**: Reference objects loaded by another plan
- Never change Upsert → Insert+deleteOldData without a concrete current reason (Bugs 1/2/3/5 are fixed on 5.6.4+ — not valid reasons) and explicit user approval

## v5 Bugs — one live on the 5.6.4 floor
- Bug 4 (LIVE): `$$` composite notation fails in lookup reference columns (self-referential and cross-object) — use simple single-field references (non-destructive)
- Bugs 1/2/3/5: FIXED at/below 5.6.4 (the floor). Do not apply their old Insert+deleteOldData/direct-field workarounds — Upsert matches on relationship traversals.

## Object Ordering
- Parent objects before child objects in the `objects` array
- deleteOldData objects delete in reverse array order (last first)

## SOQL Queries
- ORDER BY fields must appear in SELECT
- Relationship columns must match CSV header expectations

## Empty CSVs
- Mark `excluded: true` to prevent destructive delete-on-load
