# Apex Script Rules

## DO NOT

- Write SOQL inside loops (query once, iterate results)
- Use single-record DML in loops (`update record;`) — use `update records;`
- Delete PUR/PUG/RateCardEntry without deactivating first
- Delete rating data before deleting rates data (FK constraint)
- Semi-join against a **polymorphic** lookup — it silently matches nothing
- Discard `Database.DeleteResult`s — a refused row resurfaces later as an unexplained `DELETE_FAILED` on its parent
- Log failures at `LoggingLevel.FINE` — the default log level hides them

## Bulk Safety
- No SOQL inside loops — query once, iterate over results
- Use `update records;` (bulk DML on list), never `update record;` inside a loop
- Use `Database.update(records, false)` for partial success where appropriate

## Activation Ordering
- Rating objects (PUR, PUG) require specific platform activation ordering
- See `activateRatingRecords.apex` for the 7-step pattern
- Always set `Status = 'Active'` (or equivalent) — don't assume records activate automatically

## Deactivation Before Deletion
- PUR, PUG, RateCardEntry require deactivation before deletion
- Pattern: query active records → set Status to Draft/Inactive → update → delete
- See `deleteQbRatingData.apex` for the deactivate-then-delete pattern

## Delete Scripts
- Delete in child → parent order (reverse of load order)
- Rates must be deleted before rating data (FK constraints)
- Use `Database.delete(records)` — `delete records;` also works in anonymous Apex

## Circular Graphs Need a Convergent Loop
Some graphs (notably **usage**: summaries ↔ ratable summaries, entries/journals
holding summaries, self-nesting buckets) have **circular** delete constraints — no
fixed order works. Loop over every object and stop when a round makes no progress:

```apex
for (Integer round = 1; round <= MAX_ROUNDS; round++) {
    Integer progress = 0;
    progress += deleteQuietly([SELECT Id FROM ChildA ... LIMIT :BATCH]);
    progress += deleteQuietly([SELECT Id FROM ChildB ... LIMIT :BATCH]);
    if (progress == 0) { break; }
}
```

⚠ Do **not** wrap this in a savepoint that rolls back on failure — the rollback
undoes every successful delete, so only the first-surfacing blocker is ever visible
and each rerun shows a different error.

## Polymorphic Lookups
A semi-join against a polymorphic field (`BindingObjectId`, `RelatedObjectId`, …)
does not resolve — it matches nothing **and reports success**. Materialise and bind:

```apex
Set<Id> assetIds = new Map<Id, Asset>([SELECT Id FROM Asset WHERE ...]).keySet();
[SELECT Id FROM X WHERE BindingObjectId IN :assetIds]
```

## Apex Gotchas in Anonymous Scripts

These only surface at compile/run time in an org — **always run a script against a
scratch org before committing it**, even when you expect it to no-op.

- `IllegalStateException` **does not exist**; the built-in `Exception` is abstract —
  declare `public class MyException extends Exception {}` to throw
- `IllegalArgumentException` works. **`System.NoDataFoundException` does not** —
  throwing it gives `Can only throw this exception type from VisualForce or Aura
  context`. Use your own exception subclass
- A class declared in anonymous Apex is an **inner** type, so its methods cannot be
  `static` (`static can only be used on methods of a top level type`). Declare
  instance methods and `new` the class up front
- Bind a `Datetime` field to a `Datetime`, not a `Date` — e.g.
  `TransactionJournal.StartDate` is a Datetime

## Naming Convention
- Activation: `activate{Feature}Records.apex`
- Deletion: `delete{Plan}Data.apex` (e.g., `deleteQbRatingData.apex`)
- Validation: `validate{Subject}.apex` (e.g., `validateRatedUsage.apex`)
- Data generation: `consume{Subject}.apex` / `clear{Subject}Data.apex`
