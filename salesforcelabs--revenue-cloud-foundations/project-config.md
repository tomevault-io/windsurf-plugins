# Context Plan JSON Rules

Repo **plan JSON** consumed by `manage_context_definition` / `apply_context_*`
(class `rlm_context_service.ManageContextDefinition`) and `ExtendStandardContext`.
This is our additive format — **not** the MDAPI `.contextDefinition` file format
under `force-app/main/default/contextDefinitions/`, and not a Salesforce-native
artifact. Full guidance: `.cursor/skills/context-service/SKILL.md`
(+ `data-model-and-api.md` for the authoritative schema).

## Always

- **Lint before applying** (offline, no org):
  `python scripts/context_service/definition/validate_context_plan.py <manifest.json>` — must be 0 errors.
- If you add/rename a recognized key, update the schema table in
  `.cursor/skills/context-service/data-model-and-api.md` in the same change
  (per `.cursor/skills/doc-consistency/SKILL.md`).

## Format is additive-only

- A plan **adds/upserts** attributes, mappings, and tags onto a base. There is
  **no per-artifact delete directive** — do not expect one. Deactivation is
  whole-version (`deactivate_before`), off by default. Teardown (deactivate or
  hard-delete a definition / custom artifacts) is a **separate, out-of-band**
  step — `scripts/context_service/definition/delete_context.py`, not the plan
  format. Deactivate before definition teardown; granular leaf-delete behavior is
  endpoint-specific, so check the active-version matrix in
  `.cursor/skills/context-service/authoring-and-lifecycle.md` first.
- The plan format is **design-time only** — it defines a Context *Definition*.
  Runtime *hydration* (loading records into a context instance) and *persistence*
  (writing values back) are **not** expressed in a plan; they are handled at
  runtime by the consuming engines, and can be exercised for
  debugging/validation by the runtime helper scripts
  (`context_session.py`, `build_hydration_data.py`, …) — see
  `.cursor/skills/context-service/runtime-and-persistence.md`.
- `deactivate_before` defaults to `false`; **adding new** attributes/tags/nodes
  applies in place on an active version. But many **modify existing** operations
  (flipping `isTransient`, re-pointing the default mapping) are blocked while
  active (`RECORD_UPDATE_FAILED` "Cannot modify/delete an active context
  definition", live-verified), and one Connect PATCH path is silently
  destructive if it omits siblings. Set `deactivate_before: true` for a plan that
  edits existing artifacts, or use
  `scripts/context_service/definition/mutate_context.py --deactivate-first --reactivate`
  for a one-off. See the skill before assuming any endpoint's active-version
  behavior.

## Canonical enums (Core UDD, v67.0)

- `dataType` ∈ {STRING, NUMBER, BOOLEAN, DATE, DATETIME, PERCENT, PICKLIST,
  CURRENCY, REFERENCE, DOUBLE, INT, MAP, SELFREFERENCE, LOOKUP}
- `fieldType` ∈ {INPUT, INPUTOUTPUT, OUTPUT, AGGREGATE}
- `mappingType` ∈ {SOBJECT, CONTEXT}

## `__c`-suffix rule (scoped)

- Custom attribute/node/tag names added to a **standard/extended base** must end
  with `__c` (validator ERROR otherwise). This is **platform-enforced at
  creation**, not just a repo convention — a suffix-less custom artifact POST on
  an extended base is rejected with `INVALID_API_INPUT` ("… must have an '__c'
  suffix in an extended context definition"). The validator catches it offline.
- **Skipped entirely for create-new definitions** (`"create": true`) — their
  names are author-chosen and collide with nothing inherited.
- Definition `developerName`s are exempt (legitimately `RLM_*Context`).

## Mapping rules — Connect vs SObject REST

- Simple SOBJECT mapping: `mappingName`, `contextNode`, `contextAttribute`,
  `mappingType: SOBJECT`, `sObject`, `sObjectField`.
- **Key-name asymmetry (easy trip):** a `mappingRules` entry names the node with
  **`contextNode`**, but the matching `contextAttributesByName` entry names the
  same node with **`nodeName`**. Mixing them up → the validator errors
  `attribute missing required 'nodeName'`. To bind a new attribute to a field in
  one plan, supply both: the attribute in `contextAttributesByName` (`nodeName`)
  and the bind in `mappingRules` (`contextNode`).
- **Relationship traversals** (`childSObject` / `childSObjectField`) are applied
  via **SObject REST**, not the Connect PATCH (the PATCH rejects traversals and
  wipes existing hydration on re-run). The task routes these automatically.
- CONTEXT-to-CONTEXT rules need `sourceContextNode` / `sourceContextAttribute`
  (+ `mappedContextDefinitionName`); at most **2 distinct referenced definitions**
  (validator ERROR beyond that). A *referenced definition* is another whole
  context linked in (e.g. `SalesTransactionContext` references
  `AssetContext__stdctx`, shown as "Referenced Definitions" in Setup and as
  `referenceContextDefinitions` in the GET). The link itself rides on
  `ASSOCIATION`-intent mappings that carry **no** node/field bindings — they let
  the engine cross between the two contexts (e.g. quote line ↔ asset). Inherited
  reference links come from the standard base; do not hand-declare them.

## Do not

- Add `primaryDomainObject` / `primaryObject` — the create endpoint returns
  `JSON_PARSER_ERROR` (validator ERROR).
