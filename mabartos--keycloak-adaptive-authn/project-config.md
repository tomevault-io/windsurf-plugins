# Agent Rules

## Start with the wiki

At the start of each task, check `_context/wiki/index.md` to decide
whether wiki context is needed before acting. Don't read the wiki in
full. Use the index and follow links only when they are relevant to
the task.

## Update the wiki

After completing a task, offer to update the wiki if the task yielded durable knowledge that could benefit future work, then wait for user approval. This includes new processes, architecture decisions, or insights that go beyond the immediate task.
