# Sparkle Design - Cursor Rules (Legacy Format)
#
# NOTE: This is the legacy format for backward compatibility.
# New rules should be added to .cursor/rules/*.mdc
#
# For detailed instructions, see: docs/ai-instructions/

## Project Overview
This is a React component library built with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and CVA.

## Key Rules
1. Follow t_wada's testing best practices
2. Use shared test helpers (TestContainer, EventHelpers, etc.)
3. Write comments in Japanese first, then English with `en:` prefix
4. Use CVA for component variants
5. Run `pnpm lint && pnpm format` before commits
