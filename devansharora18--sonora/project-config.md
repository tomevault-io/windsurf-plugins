# AGENTS.md

## Process

- Default to **agile**: short iterate-and-adjust loops, for ~90% of work (85% is also fine — err toward this whenever requirements might shift).
- Use **waterfall** (requirements → design → implementation → test → review, in order, no skipping ahead) only for the ~10–15% of work that is well-defined upfront and benefits from locking scope before touching code — e.g. schema/migration changes, public API contracts, security-sensitive flows. State explicitly when switching modes and why.
- **No big-bang changes.** Every task is broken into the smallest reasonable steps (roughly 5–10% of the total work per step).
- After finishing one step, **stop**. Summarize what changed, then ask for approval before starting the next step. Do not chain multiple steps into one response.
- Treat each step like a single commit: one logical change, one clear message, easy to review or revert on its own. Suggested format:
  ```
  step 3/12: add auth middleware
  - validates JWT on protected routes
  - returns 401 on missing/expired token
  ```
- If a step turns out to be bigger than expected, split it further and say so instead of pushing through.
- **`/snap` is one-shot and non-sticky:** it applies only when the current message literally starts with `/snap` and expires immediately after that task. The next prompt reverts to this incremental process unless it also starts with `/snap`.

## Code

- Write the least code needed to solve the problem. No speculative abstractions, no unused config, no "just in case" flexibility.
- Comment only where the *why* isn't obvious from the code itself. No comments that restate what the line already says.
- No filler, no boilerplate scaffolding "for completeness," no AI-generated-feeling padding (no restating the obvious, no over-explaining, no unnecessary try/catch or defensive code for cases that can't happen here).
- Prefer editing existing files/functions over adding new ones unless a new file is genuinely warranted.
- Match the existing style of the codebase (naming, formatting, patterns) rather than introducing a new convention per step.

## Skills

Use this file for workflow/process rules. Use the relevant `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for domain-specific technique — check its `description` frontmatter, but as a quick directory:

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| `architecture` | Starting a new project/module, or restructuring — folder structure, layering, file-size discipline. |
| `ui-ux` | Designing or reviewing any UI — visual direction (Vercel-style minimalism), typography, spacing, color tokens, states, accessibility. |
| `frontend` | Writing frontend code — Vite/Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, component/state conventions. Implements `ui-ux` decisions. |
| `backend` | Writing server/API/DB code — stack evaluation (don't default to a managed BaaS), Postgres + FastAPI conventions, security. |
| `docs` | User wants documentation — informal (understanding) or formal (backend docs, architecture docs). Write Markdown first. |
| `pdf` | Generating a PDF from scratch in Python. Not for reading/merging PDFs. Formal docs go `docs` → `pdf`, in that order. |
| `snap` | **Only** when the *current* message starts with literal `/snap`. One-shot, non-sticky — never carries to the next prompt. Suspends the incremental workflow for one task only; standards still apply. |

Apply skills together when a task spans domains (e.g. a new feature touches `architecture` + `frontend` + `backend`) rather than picking just one.
