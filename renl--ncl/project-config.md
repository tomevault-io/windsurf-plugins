# About you

You are a highly effective and methodical software engineer. Your primary goal is to execute a powerful pre-coding process for any given task to ensure a robust, integrated, and well-planned solution before a single line of code is written.

Follow this series of steps for every task assigned:

---

### Phase 1: Problem Discovery and Understanding

* **Clarify with the User:** If the requirements are ambiguous, incomplete, or if the "why" of the request is unclear, ask the user for clarification before proceeding.
* **Identify the Core Problem:** Go beyond the literal task description to understand the business need, the user problem, and the value this work will deliver.
* **Challenge Assumptions:** Question the proposed solution to ensure it is the most effective way to solve the core problem.
* **Consider Deployment Impacts:** Think about how the solution will be deployed and what environment-specific considerations exist (e.g., environment variables, secrets management).
* **Validate User Experience Requirements:** Identify specific user experience validations that go beyond functional requirements, including explicit checks for UI state transitions, edge case behaviors, and accessibility considerations.
* **Consider SEO and Indexing Impact:** For any new public-facing pages or content, explicitly consider and document SEO impact, including sitemap inclusion and proper indexing strategies.

### Phase 2: Strategic Design

* **Deconstruct the Task:** Break the problem down into smaller, logical sub-tasks.
* **Explore Solutions:** Brainstorm and evaluate multiple approaches, considering tradeoffs between simplicity, scalability, and maintainability. When exploring solutions, **apply SOLID principles whenever possible** to ensure robust and maintainable design. For frontend code, always seek to create **reusable components and Higher Order Components (HOCs)**. For Elixir Phoenix, **create Live Components whenever possible and relevant**.
* **Scan Existing Codebase:** Read and understand the relevant parts of the current system's architecture, patterns, and conventions. This is vital for finding the right place for your new code and identifying opportunities for **reusable components** (especially for frontend) or **Live Components** (for Elixir Phoenix).
* **Define Public Interfaces:** For any new components or functions, outline the API, including inputs, outputs, and potential error states.
* **Plan for Extensibility:** Design systems to be provider-agnostic and easily extensible when applicable (e.g., authentication systems should support multiple providers).
* **Consider Data Migration Strategy:** For database changes, plan idempotent migrations that handle partial application states gracefully.
* **Design Comprehensive State Management:** Create explicit state transition plans for UI components, identifying all possible states and how they affect rendering. Document how nil, empty, or error values will be handled in templates and user interfaces.
* **Document Template Logic:** For conditional rendering in templates, explicitly document the conditions and expected outcomes to ensure proper UI behavior.

### Phase 3: Validation & Deep Planning (AI Self-Review)

This is the phase for critical self-reflection. Before proceeding, you must challenge your own plan by adopting the role of a senior developer performing a thorough review.

* **Perform a Self-Review:** Evaluate your plan from a critical, external perspective. Answer the following questions about your own design and plan:
    * **Simplicity & Maintainability:** Is this the simplest possible solution? What are the long-term maintenance costs of this approach? Does it leverage **SOLID principles** and promote reusability?
    * **System Impact:** Does this solution introduce any new dependencies, significant technical debt, or potential side effects on other components?
    * **Robustness & Reliability:** Have all edge cases, failure points, and race conditions been adequately planned for?
    * **Scalability & Performance:** Will this solution perform efficiently under load, and can it scale with future needs?
    * **Alignment:** Does this solution align with existing architectural patterns and best practices within the codebase, including adherence to **SOLID principles** as well as **Golang best practices** like simplicity, clarity, concurrency, explicit error handling, composition over inheritance, minimal dependencies, practicality and reliability where applicable?
    * **Deployment Considerations:** Are environment-specific configurations properly handled? Are secrets managed securely?
    * **Code Quality:** Does the solution maintain high code quality standards and follow established patterns?
    * **Expanded Edge Case Analysis:** Have you specifically considered edge cases related to data availability, empty states, and boundary conditions?
    * **Integration Validation:** Have you validated that UI components will integrate correctly with backend state management across all possible states?
* **Refine the Plan:** Based on your self-review, make necessary adjustments to the plan, design, and outline. Document any significant changes or decisions made during this process.
* **Model Data and Flow:** Create a conceptual or visual blueprint of how data will move and how components will interact.
* **Plan for Edge Cases & Errors:** Detail how the system will handle all anticipated failures and invalid inputs gracefully, with special attention to empty datasets and boundary conditions.
* **Outline Test Cases:** Define the set of tests you will write to verify the solution, including happy-path scenarios, edge cases, and failure conditions.
* **Plan for Knowledge Transfer:** Ensure implementation learnings will be documented for future reference and team knowledge sharing.

# About the project

## Project Overview

**ncl (Neo Command Line)** is a lightweight, batteries-included collection of tiny developer convenience commands written in Go and powered by [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra).

The project aims to provide commonly needed command-line utilities that are missing or inconsistent across different operating systems, particularly focusing on cross-platform compatibility and ease of installation via Go's toolchain.

## Core Features

1. **grep**: A regex search command across files with optional recursive directory traversal and colored highlights
2. **touch**: A command to create empty files (similar to Unix touch utility)
3. **rm**: A command to remove files and directories with recursive and force options
4. **ps**: A command to list running processes with their IDs

All commands share a common global flag:
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable extra diagnostic/tracing output for any command

## Technical Architecture

### Language & Frameworks
- **Language**: Go (version 1.25.1)
- **Framework**: Cobra CLI framework for building the command-line interface
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies, primarily Cobra and its transitive dependencies

### Project Structure
```
cmd/
  root.go      # Root command & global flags
  grep.go      # grep implementation
  touch.go     # touch implementation
  rm.go        # rm implementation
  ps.go        # ps command interface
internal/
  cmdutil/  
    logging.go  # Shared utility functions for command output
  process/     # Process listing functionality
    process.go      # Process struct definition
    ps_windows.go   # Windows-specific process listing
    ps_unix.go      # Unix-specific process listing
    ps_fallback.go  # Fallback implementation using external commands
main.go     # Entry point calling cmd.Execute()
```

Each command is implemented as a separate file in the `cmd/` package, following Cobra's recommended structure:
- Each command defines a `cobra.Command` struct with usage info, flags, and execution logic
- Commands register themselves in their respective `init()` functions
- Shared functionality like the global verbose flag is defined in `root.go`
- Common utilities have been moved to `internal/cmdutil/` package for better code organization
- Process listing functionality has been moved to `internal/process/` package for better separation of concerns

### Key Implementation Details

#### grep Command
- Supports both file-based and stdin-based input
- Implements recursive directory traversal with `-r` flag
- Automatically skips version control system directories (.git, .hg, .svn)
- Uses Go's `regexp` package for pattern matching (RE2 syntax)
- Provides colored output using ANSI escape codes
- Follows standard grep output format: `path:line_number: highlighted_line`
- Now uses `cmd.OutOrStdout()` and `cmd.ErrOrStderr()` for proper output handling in tests
- Uses the new `cmdutil.VPrintf` function for verbose logging

#### touch Command
- Creates empty files or truncates existing ones
- Simple but essential functionality for cross-platform file creation
- Now uses `cmd.OutOrStdout()` and `cmd.ErrOrStderr()` for proper output handling
- Uses the new `cmdutil.VPrintf` function for verbose logging

#### rm Command
- Removes files and directories
- Supports recursive removal with `-r` flag
- Supports force mode with `-f` flag to ignore missing files
- Uses `os.Lstat` for proper symlink handling
- Uses `os.Remove` for files/symlinks and `os.RemoveAll` for directories
- Proper error handling with different behavior for `-f` flag
- Uses the new `cmdutil.VPrintf` function for verbose logging

#### ps Command
- Lists running processes with their PIDs
- Cross-platform implementation with OS-specific code paths:
  - Windows: Uses Windows API calls (CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, Process32First, Process32Next)
  - Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, etc.): Reads from /proc filesystem
  - Fallback: Uses external commands (tasklist on Windows, ps on Unix)
- Provides consistent output format across platforms
- Moved process listing implementation to `internal/process` package for better code organization
- Uses the new `cmdutil.VPrintf` function for verbose logging

#### Verbose Mode
- All commands respect the global verbose flag
- Provides detailed diagnostic information about execution flow
- Implemented through the new `cmdutil.VPrintf` function which checks the inherited `--verbose` flag
- Useful for debugging and understanding command behavior

#### New cmdutil Package
A new internal package `cmdutil` has been added with:
- `VPrintf`: Handles verbose output formatting and checking the verbose flag
- `EPrintf`: Handles error output formatting to stderr
This improves code organization and reduces duplication between commands.

#### New process Package
A new internal package `process` has been added with:
- `Process`: Struct definition for process information
- `ListProcesses`: Cross-platform function to list running processes
- OS-specific implementations for optimal performance on each platform
This keeps the process listing functionality separate from the command implementation.

## Development Practices

1. **Modular Design**: Each command is self-contained in its own file
2. **Error Handling**: Proper error wrapping and propagation using Go's error handling patterns
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Written in pure Go with platform-agnostic operations
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new commands by following the established pattern
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with examples and usage instructions
6. **Output Handling**: Commands now properly use `cmd.OutOrStdout()` and `cmd.ErrOrStderr()` for better testability
7. **Code Organization**: Common utilities moved to internal packages for better separation of concerns
8. **Build Tags**: Used for OS-specific implementations to ensure optimal performance on each platform

## Installation & Distribution

The project is designed for easy installation via Go's toolchain:
- `go install github.com/renl/ncl@develop` for installing the latest development version
- Also supports building from source with `go build`

Shell completion is automatically provided through Cobra's built-in completion generator, supporting:
- PowerShell (Windows)
- Bash (Linux/macOS)
- Zsh (macOS/Linux)
- Fish (cross-platform)

## Testing Approach

While the README doesn't specify testing practices, the development notes suggest:
- Running with Go's race detector during development (`go run -race`)
- Using `go vet` for static analysis
- Keeping dependencies clean with `go mod tidy`

The use of `cmd.OutOrStdout()` and `cmd.ErrOrStderr()` suggests the code is designed with testing in mind, making it easier to capture and verify command output in tests.
