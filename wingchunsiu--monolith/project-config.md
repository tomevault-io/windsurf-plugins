# Monocontext
This is the repo for monocontext, a project using RLMs as a tool for coding agents. RLMs are an inference scaffold for language models that allow them to scale to millions of tokens input size almost for free. So instead of all devs having separate agent chat histories, why not just have a monocontext that they all share like an unstructured growing dev log. Then whenever necessary the coding agent can use the RLM as a tool call to pull useful context from the monocontext about what other devs have worked on or even from your own previous sessions.

# Overall Rules and Background
The RLM is implemented with modal. The idea is the RLM runs as a modal function and the sub agents run as sandboxes.
This project uses `uv` so please use uv for dependency management and running scripts.
Please understand the philosphy behind RLM and how it works from this blogpost: https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/
The basic RLM implementation is implemented in rlm/


## Problem Solving
- Err on the side of minimal and simple solutions.
- Avoid writing a whole overly complex code with lots of error handling cases.
- Build like you are writing a well engineered weekend project.
- Be concise and minimally invasive and deliberate with your edits.

# Modal Rules and Guidelines for LLMs

This file provides rules and guidelines for LLMs when implementing Modal code.

## General

- Modal is a serverless cloud platform for running Python code with minimal configuration
- Designed for AI/ML workloads but supports general-purpose cloud compute
- Serverless billing model - you only pay for resources used

## Modal documentation

- Extensive documentation is available at: modal.com/docs (and in markdown format at modal.com/llms-full.txt)
- A large collection of examples is available at: modal.com/docs/examples (and github.com/modal-labs/modal-examples)
- Reference documentation is available at: modal.com/docs/reference

Always refer to documentation and examples for up-to-date functionality and exact syntax.

## Core Modal concepts

### App

- A group of functions, classes and sandboxes that are deployed together.

### Function

- The basic unit of serverless execution on Modal.
- Each Function executes in its own container, and you can configure different Images for different Functions within the same App:

  ```python
  image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.12")
    .pip_install("torch", "transformers")
    .apt_install("ffmpeg")
    .run_commands("mkdir -p /models")
  )

  @app.function(image=image)
  def square(x: int) -> int:
    return x * x
  ```

- You can configure individual hardware requirements (CPU, memory, GPUs, etc.) for each Function.

  ```python
  @app.function(
    gpu="H100",
    memory=4096,
    cpu=2,
  )
  def inference():
    ...
  ```

  Some examples specificly for GPUs:

  ```python
  @app.function(gpu="A10G")  # Single GPU, e.g. T4, A10G, A100, H100, or "any"
  @app.function(gpu="A100:2")  # Multiple GPUs, e.g. 2x A100 GPUs
  @app.function(gpu=["H100", "A100", "any"]) # GPU with fallbacks
  ```

- Functions can be invoked in a number of ways. Some of the most common are:
  - `foo.remote()` - Run the Function in a separate container in the cloud. This is by far the most common.
  - `foo.local()` - Run the Function in the same context as the caller. Note: This does not necessarily mean locally on your machine.
  - `foo.map()` - Parallel map over a set of inputs.
  - `foo.spawn()` - Calls the function with the given arguments, without waiting for the results. Terminating the App will also terminate spawned functions.
- Web endpoint: You can turn any Function into an HTTP web endpoint served by adding a decorator:

  ```python
  @app.function()
  @modal.fastapi_endpoint()
  def fastapi_endpoint():
    return {"status": "ok"}

  @app.function()
  @modal.asgi_app()
  def asgi_app():
    app = FastAPI()
    ...
    return app
  ```

- You can run Functions on a schedule using e.g. `@app.function(schedule=modal.Period(minutes=5))` or `@app.function(schedule=modal.Cron("0 9 * * *"))`.

### Classes (a.k.a. `Cls`)

- For stateful operations with startup/shutdown lifecycle hooks. Example:

  ```python
  @app.cls(gpu="A100")
  class ModelServer:
      @modal.enter()
      def load_model(self):
          # Runs once when container starts
          self.model = load_model()

      @modal.method()
      def predict(self, text: str) -> str:
          return self.model.generate(text)

      @modal.exit()
      def cleanup(self):
          # Runs when container stops
          cleanup()
  ```

### Other important concepts

- Image: Represents a container image that Functions can run in.
- Sandbox: Allows defining containers at runtime and securely running arbitrary code inside them.
