# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repository.

## What this is

**kaos-control** (product name *Innovation Maker*, to be finalised) is a single-binary lifecycle management tool: a Go server with an embedded Vue 3 SPA that indexes markdown artifacts under `lifecycle/`, exposes a graph + editor UI, and orchestrates agent runs that produce new artifacts and code.

The project is **meta**: it enforces a specific requirements-to-release lifecycle, and the same lifecycle structure is applied to this repo to produce the tool itself.

## Authoritative spec

[lifecycle/requirements/Innovation Maker - Making Releases from Ideas-1.md](lifecycle/requirements/Innovation Maker - Making Releases from Ideas-1.md) is the source of truth for product scope, file format, workflow states, roles, and configuration. Read it before any substantive design discussion. Do not restate it here.

## Build & run

```sh
make build-web    # pnpm install + pnpm build → web/dist/
make build        # go build → ./dist/kaos-control (embeds web/dist)
make run          # development mode (LOG_LEVEL=debug)
make lint         # go vet + staticcheck
make test-unit    # go test ./... -short
```

App config lives at `~/.kaos-control/config.yaml`; project registrations at `~/.kaos-control/projects/*.yaml`.

## Tech stack (in use)

**Backend** — Go 1.25+ stdlib `net/http` + `go-chi/chi`; `goldmark` (markdown), `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`, `fsnotify`, `coder/websocket`, `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure-Go), `go-git/go-git`.

**Frontend** — Vite 5, Vue 3.5 SFCs, TypeScript, Pinia, Vue Router 4, `markdown-it`, `3d-force-graph` + three.js (3D), Cytoscape.js + cytoscape-fcose (2D), CodeMirror 6 (editor), lucide-vue-next (icons).

**Distribution** — single Go binary; frontend embedded via `embed.FS` from `web/dist/`.

## Roles & agents

Roles split by lifecycle phase:
- **Think**: `analyst` — reads ideas → writes requirements; reads requirements → writes 3 plans.
- **Make**: `backend-developer` (Go in `internal/`, `cmd/`), `frontend-developer` (Vue/TS in `web/src/`), `test-developer` (integration tests in `tests/` + artifacts in `lifecycle/tests/`).
- **Verify**: `qa` — runs tests, raises defects in `lifecycle/defects/`, assigns to the right developer role.
- **Cross-cutting**: `product-owner`, `reviewer`, `approver`.

Six agents are configured in [lifecycle/config.yaml](lifecycle/config.yaml): `requirements-analyst`, `planning-analyst`, `backend-developer`, `frontend-developer`, `test-developer`, `qa`. Each has scoped `allowed_write_paths` and a focused prompt template.

`required_plans.ticket = [plan-backend, plan-frontend, plan-test]` gates `planning → in-development`.

## Lineage filename convention

Artifacts for a single idea share a **slug** and carry a **monotonic index** across stages, with optional stage suffix:

```
lifecycle/ideas/login.md            (originating, no suffix)
lifecycle/requirements/login-2.md
lifecycle/backend-plans/login-3-be.md
lifecycle/frontend-plans/login-4-fe.md
lifecycle/test-plans/login-5-test.md
```

- First file in a lineage has **no suffix**. Indices start at `-2`.
