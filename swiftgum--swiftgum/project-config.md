## Provider

We use Supabase with Postgres.

### Schemas

We have two app managed schemas:

- `public`: in this schema, tables are accessible to the anonymous users. They should always have RLS in place (if it makes sense) to secure them.
- `private`: in this schema, access is denied to everyone except for the superuser. This is already set up.

In general, functions, views etc. should go to the private table. End user information (as defined in [logic.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/logic.mdc)) is to be stored in the private schema, as they are never logged in, making it insuitable for RLS.

Always qualify the extensions and functions (except postgres native).

There also is a few non-managed schemas:

- `extensions`: pgcrypto is installed in this schema.
- `pgmq`: pgmq is installed in this schema.
- `auth`: supabase managed
- ... other supabase managed schemas.

### Guides

When working with cryptography, always create the appropriate functions for encryption and decryption. Workspaces, as defined in [20250130131824_create_workspace_table.sql](mdc:supabase/migrations/20250130131824_create_workspace_table.sql) have an encryption key associated. When asked by the user for encryption in a table, try to join to the workspace and use this key.
