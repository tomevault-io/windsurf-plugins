# pathmc — Agent Guide

`pathmc` is a Python package for Bayesian path analysis (observed-variable SEM). It compiles a lavaan-inspired formula DSL into PyMC models, provides introspection, and supports a `do()` operator for interventional simulation.

## Workflow

1. Make your changes. Do not modify test files — if a test seems wrong, flag it for human review.
2. Run the relevant gate tests, e.g. `uv run pytest tests/test_<module>.py -x -v`. `make test-fast` skips MCMC sampling; `make test` runs everything.
3. Run `make lint` before considering work done or committing. It runs `prek run --all-files` (ruff, ruff-format, mypy, YAML/TOML, license checks).

Developer-local and ephemeral notes (specs, drafts, exploration) live in `.scratch/` at the repo root, which is gitignored. Never add scratch files to the tracked tree.

## Required Module Structure

Test files import from these fixed paths; internal helpers can be organized freely, but these imports must resolve.

```
pathmc/
  __init__.py     # Public API: model(), simulate(), Prior (re-export)
  parse.py        # parse_spec(spec_string) -> Spec
  graph.py        # build_graph(spec) -> GraphInfo
  compile.py      # Compiler -> pm.Model (Gaussian, Bernoulli, Poisson, etc.)
  simulate.py     # do() operator (cross-sectional + panel)
  effects.py      # Labeled coefficients, defined params, stdyx standardized
  introspect.py   # graph(), equations(), design(), priors()
  transforms.py   # Transform registry (adstock, logistic_saturation)
  identify.py     # Backdoor criterion, adjustment sets, collider warnings
  falsify.py      # Whole-DAG falsification (permutation test)
  sensitivity.py  # Unmeasured-confounding sensitivity analysis
  panel.py        # PanelInfo and panel validation
  priors.py       # default_priors(), merge_priors(); Prior-based config
  residuals.py    # Residual covariance structures (LKJ Cholesky, pluggable)
  idata.py        # Internal ArviZ InferenceData accessors
  exceptions.py   # CycleError, DuplicateEquationError, etc.
  model.py        # PathModel class; model() and simulate() entry points
```

## Environment

A [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)-managed virtualenv at `.venv/`, pinned by `uv.lock` and `.python-version`. Create or update it with `make setup`, which also installs the `prek` git hooks (a fast pre-commit runner) so the lint checks run automatically on `git commit`. Run everything through `uv run` (e.g. `uv run pytest`, `uv run python -c "..."`) — never the system or conda Python.

This package targets **PyMC ≥ 6.0, ArviZ ≥ 1.1, PyTensor ≥ 3.0, and NumPy ≥ 2.0** — all recent majors with breaking API changes from earlier versions. Do not assume pre-6 PyMC or pre-1.0 ArviZ APIs; verify against the installed versions (`uv run python -c "import pymc, arviz; print(pymc.__version__, arviz.__version__)"`) or the current upstream docs when unsure.

## Building the docs

The site is built with [Great Docs](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-docs/) via `great-docs.yml`: `uv run great-docs build`. The output dir `great-docs/_site/` is ephemeral and gitignored — never edit it. Edit sources instead: `docs/user_guide/*.qmd`, `docs/examples/**/*.qmd`, `great-docs.yml`, and `pathmc/skills/pathmc/SKILL.md`.

Notebooks are frozen (`freeze: true`): the committed `_freeze/` cache supplies cell outputs and CI never spawns a kernel, so **local previews show the last-frozen output, not in-progress edits.** After editing an executable page, refresh and commit the cache (local freezing needs the kernel once: `uv run python -m ipykernel install --user --name pathmc`):

```bash
uv run great-docs freeze docs/examples/01-foundations/my_page.qmd
git add _freeze/
```

The repo-root symlink `examples -> docs/examples` is required by Great Docs Page Tags — do not delete it.

## Style

- `ruff` formatter/linter, line length 88. Type hints and docstrings on all public functions, methods, and classes.
- No global mutable state (no import-time mutable registries).
- Error messages must name the problem AND suggest a fix.
- No narrating comments — comments explain *why*, not *what*.
- No hard-wrapped prose in `.md`/`.qmd` files: one paragraph = one line (block elements and fenced code are exempt).
- Prefer clear, boring code over clever code.

## Architecture Principles

- Parser returns typed dataclass AST nodes, not raw strings or dicts.
- The graph layer is independent of the PyMC compiler — it works from a `Spec` alone, with no data or PyMC objects.
- The do() planner (propagation order) is logically separate from the do() executor (applies posterior draws).
- Residual covariance uses an abstraction layer, not hardcoded LKJ, so alternative structures can be added without major refactors.
- Parameter naming is predictable and stable across runs, via ArviZ/xarray coords.
