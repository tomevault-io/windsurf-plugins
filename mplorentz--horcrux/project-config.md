description: Debug-mode logging from the sandboxed Flutter app — always POST to the debug server

# Debug-mode logging in this Flutter app

This is a Flutter app that runs **macOS sandboxed** in debug builds (entitlements
enable `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` and `com.apple.security.network.client`).
Sandboxed processes **cannot write to `~/.cursor/...`**, so any
file-based debug instrumentation that targets the workspace log path will silently
do nothing — the log file never gets created and you'll waste a reproduction cycle
discovering this.

## Rule: instrument via HTTP, not file I/O

When Cursor's debug mode provides a server endpoint and a workspace log path,
**use the HTTP endpoint from inside the running app**. The endpoint is reachable
because `network.client` is granted; the Cursor logging system writes the POSTed
NDJSON to the log file for you. Do **not** use `dart:io File.writeAsStringSync`
to append to the log path from app code.

## Concrete Dart helper to drop into a file under instrumentation

Replace the placeholders with the values from the current debug-mode system
reminder (`SERVER_ENDPOINT`, `SESSION_ID`):

```dart
// #region agent log
import 'dart:convert' as dbg_convert;
import 'dart:io' as dbg_io;

final dbg_io.HttpClient _dbgHttpClient = dbg_io.HttpClient()
  ..connectionTimeout = const Duration(seconds: 1);

void _dbgLog(String location, String message, Map<String, dynamic> data,
    {String hypothesisId = ''}) {
  final entry = <String, dynamic>{
    'sessionId': 'SESSION_ID',
    'id': 'log_${DateTime.now().microsecondsSinceEpoch}',
    'timestamp': DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch,
    'location': location,
    'message': message,
    'data': data,
    if (hypothesisId.isNotEmpty) 'hypothesisId': hypothesisId,
  };
  final body = dbg_convert.utf8.encode(dbg_convert.jsonEncode(entry));
  () async {
    try {
      final req = await _dbgHttpClient.postUrl(Uri.parse('SERVER_ENDPOINT'));
      req.headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/json');
      req.headers.set('X-Debug-Session-Id', 'SESSION_ID');
      req.add(body);
      final resp = await req.close();
      await resp.drain<void>();
    } catch (_) {}
  }();
}
// #endregion
```

## Reminders before asking the user to reproduce

- A hot **reload** does not pick up new top-level functions or imports — ask for
  a hot **restart** (Shift+R in `flutter run`) when you've added the helper.
- If a previous run produced no log lines and the app definitely rendered the
  instrumented code path, suspect sandboxing first; switch to HTTP and retry
  rather than re-instrumenting more places.
- Pure Dart unit tests (`flutter test`) are **not** sandboxed and can use file
  I/O safely if you ever instrument test-only code.
