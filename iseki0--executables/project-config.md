# AGENTS

## Project Purpose

This repository is a Kotlin Multiplatform executable parsing project.

- Primary deliverable: `executables-files`, a library for parsing PE, ELF, and Mach-O binaries.
- Secondary deliverable: `bin-tool`, a native CLI that prints executable metadata and Go SBOM/build info when present.
- Supporting build logic: `g` and `buildSrc`, used for source generation and shared Gradle conventions.

The library currently focuses on:

- detecting executable formats
- reading headers and sections
- reading import/export symbols where supported
- parsing PE resources and version info
- reading Go build info / SBOM-related metadata

## Repository Structure

### Root

- `settings.gradle.kts`: includes `executables-files`, `bin-tool`, and composite build `g`
- `build.gradle.kts`: root Dokka aggregation and common group/version/repository setup
- `gradle/libs.versions.toml`: central dependency and plugin version catalog
- `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`: the only allowed Gradle entrypoints

### Main Modules

- `files`: main Kotlin Multiplatform library, published as `space.iseki.executables:executables-files`
- `bin-tool`: multiplatform native executable for inspecting binaries from the command line
- `g`: custom Gradle plugin build that generates Kotlin enum/flag sources from YAML definitions
- `buildSrc`: shared Gradle conventions applied across modules

## Source Layout

### Library Code

`files/src/commonMain/kotlin/space/iseki/executables` contains shared parsing logic:

- `common`: shared abstractions such as file accessors, sections, addresses, and format handling
- `pe`: PE/COFF parsing, resources, version info, import/export support
- `elf`: ELF headers, sections, symbol parsing
- `macho`: Mach-O headers, segments, load commands
- `sbom`: Go build info and SBOM-oriented parsing
- `share`: shared low-level byte and utility helpers

### Platform-Specific Code

- `files/src/jvmMain`: JVM file access implementations and JPMS packaging support
- `files/src/nonJvmMain`: common non-JVM helpers
- `files/src/nativeFileSupportedMain`, `nativeFileSupported2Main`, `nativeFileUnsupportedMain`, `mingwX64Main`: target-specific file access behavior

### Tests and Fixtures

- `files/src/commonTest`: format parser unit tests
- `files/src/fileAccessTest`: tests that exercise real sample binaries from `resources`
- `files/src/jvmTest`, `files/src/mingwX64Test`: platform-specific tests
- `files/src/**/resources`: sample PE / ELF / Mach-O / Go binaries used as fixtures

### Generated Code

- `files/src/commonMain/define`: YAML definitions for enums/flags
- `g/src/main/resources/*.ftl`: Freemarker templates for generated Kotlin code
- generated Kotlin is written into the build directory by task `tGenerateFlagFiles`

## Architecture Notes

### Core Runtime Model

- `common/FileFormat` is the entrypoint for format detection and opening. Detection is magic-based, and all parsers open through the shared `DataAccessor` random-access abstraction.
- `OpenedFile` is the minimal parsed-file surface. Format implementations may also expose `ReadableSectionContainer`, import/export symbol containers, and `VirtualMemoryReadable`.
- `share/MemReader` is the core virtual-memory mapper. It translates virtual addresses back to file offsets and fills unmapped gaps with zeroes.
- Virtual memory is format-specific but follows the same pattern: PE maps section table entries, ELF maps `PT_LOAD` program headers, and Mach-O maps segment/section file ranges.

### Format Coverage

- `pe`: currently the deepest parser. It covers COFF/optional headers, sections, imports, exports, resource tree walking, and version info parsing.
- `elf`: covers identification/header parsing, program headers, section headers, symbol tables, export/import derivation, and `DT_NEEDED` import libraries.
- `macho`: currently focuses on headers, load commands, segments, sections, and virtual-memory-backed reads. It is thinner than PE and ELF.
- `sbom`: Go build info extraction is layered on top of parsed executable files. It depends on `ReadableSectionContainer` plus `VirtualMemoryReadable`; it is not a separate file-format parser.

### Test Strategy

- `commonTest` is for byte-array-level parser tests and shared logic tests that do not need platform file access.
- `fileAccessTest` is the main integration layer for real sample binaries and fixture-backed assertions.
- `jvmTest` and `mingwX64Test` cover platform-specific file-access behavior and runtime parity checks.
- If parser behavior changes, check both structure-level tests and real-fixture tests. SBOM and section-reading regressions are usually caught in `fileAccessTest`.

## Build and Tooling Notes

- The project uses Kotlin Multiplatform with JVM, JS, Wasm, Apple, Linux, Android Native, and MinGW targets.
- Shared Gradle conventions live in `buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/convention.gradle.kts`.
- `files` enables ABI validation and Maven publication signing.
- GPG command-line signing is configured in Gradle via `useGpgCmd()`.

Common commands:

- run full validation: `./gradlew check`
- run JVM tests only: `./gradlew jvmTest`
- inspect tasks: `./gradlew tasks --all`
- build CLI targets through `bin-tool` tasks from `./gradlew`

On Windows PowerShell, use:

- `.\gradlew.bat check`
