      # CrossRoads Repository Usage Guide

      ## Repository Structure
      
      This repository uses pnpm workspaces and turborepo to manage multiple packages:
      
      ```
      crossroads/
      ├── packages/           # Core packages
      │   ├── crossroads-infra/
      │   └── crossroads-graph/
      ├── apps/           # Example implementations
      │   ├── durable-search/
      │   ├── durable-runna/
      │   └── inference-time-scaling/
      ├── pnpm-workspace.yaml # Workspace configuration
      ├── turbo.json          # Turborepo configuration
      ├── biome.json          # Biome linting/formatting config
      └── package.json        # Root package configuration
      ```

      ## Getting Started

      ### Prerequisites
      
      - Node.js (see package.json for version)
      - pnpm v9.12.1 or compatible

      ### Installation
      
      ```bash
      # Install pnpm if you don't have it
      npm install -g pnpm@9.12.1
      
      # Install dependencies
      pnpm install
      ```

      ## Development Workflow

      ### Running Commands
      
      All commands should be run from the repository root using pnpm and turborepo:
      
      ```bash
      # Start development servers for all packages
      pnpm dev
      
      # Build all packages
      pnpm build
      
      # Run tests
      pnpm test
      
      # Generate Cloudflare types
      pnpm typegen
      
      # Format code
      pnpm format
      
      # Lint code
      pnpm lint:biome
      
      # Check and auto-fix issues
      pnpm check
      ```

      ### Working with Workspaces
      
      To add a dependency to a specific package:
      
      ```bash
      # Add a dependency to a specific package
      pnpm --filter <package-name> add <dependency>
      
      # Example: Add lodash to crossroads-graph
      pnpm --filter crossroads-graph add lodash
      
      # Add a dev dependency
      pnpm --filter <package-name> add -D <dependency>
      ```

      To create a new package:
      
      1. Create a new directory in `packages/` or `examples/`
      2. Initialize with `package.json`
      3. Add to workspace by ensuring it's covered by patterns in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`

      ### Biome Linting and Formatting
      
      This repository uses Biome for linting and formatting:
      
      - Configuration is in `biome.json`
      - Run `pnpm format` to format all files
      - Run `pnpm lint:biome` to lint all files
      - Run `pnpm check` to check and auto-fix issues

      ### Turborepo
      
      Turborepo manages the build pipeline:
      
      - Configuration is in `turbo.json`
      - Caches build outputs for faster subsequent builds
      - Manages dependencies between packages
      - Runs tasks in parallel when possible

      ## Best Practices
      
      1. Always run `pnpm format` and `pnpm lint:biome` before committing
      2. Use workspace references for internal dependencies
      3. Keep packages focused and modular
      4. Follow the existing code style (using single quotes, 2 spaces for indentation)
      5. Update documentation when adding new features

examples:
  - input: |
      # Adding a new dependency to a package
      pnpm --filter crossroads-infra add axios
    output: "Correctly added dependency to a specific package"
  - input: |
      # Running development servers
      pnpm dev
    output: "Correctly running development servers for all packages"
