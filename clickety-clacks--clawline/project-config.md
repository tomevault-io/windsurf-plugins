Follow the shared instructions in [COMMON.md](./COMMON.md).

## Code Reviews

Use **Claude** for code reviews (cross-validation with Opus):

```bash
$HOME/.claude/local/claude --model claude-opus-4-5-20251101 \
  -p "ultrathink Review the code changes from: $(git diff HEAD~1). Look for bugs, security issues, and adherence to the DI pattern in COMMON.md."
```

Alternative (staged changes):
```bash
$HOME/.claude/local/claude --model claude-opus-4-5-20251101 \
  -p "ultrathink Review the code changes from: $(git diff --staged)."
```

Note: "ultrathink" is appended to the prompt to enable extended thinking mode.

## Swift Safety Rules

- Do not use `try? await Task.sleep(...)` in cancellable flows unless the next line is an explicit cancellation guard before any side effect.
- Prefer `do { try await Task.sleep(...) } catch is CancellationError { return }` for cancellable delay paths.
- Avoid postfix force unwraps (`!`) in production code, except static URL literals with explicit code-review sign-off.
- In protocol/message handlers, do not silently drop decode/transform failures; log or surface an explicit failure path.

## GitHub Issue Hygiene

When working on GitHub issues, follow these rules:

1. **NEVER close an issue.** Only Flynn closes issues after testing.
2. **Comment when starting.** When you begin work on an issue, comment on it noting that you're starting.
3. **Post progress updates.** Comment on the issue as you work — what you found, what you changed, what you committed.
4. **Comment when done, don't close.** When finished, comment with a final summary (commit hash, what changed, deploy status) but do NOT close the issue.

## Shipping Discipline

- **Main-only shipping.** Only ship/deploy from `origin/main`. Do not deploy from pinned/local-only commits or non-main branches.

## Shipping Policy (Main Only)

- Ship only from `origin/main`. Do not request or expect deploys of pinned commits or branch SHAs.
- When reporting a fix, always state `pushed to origin/main @ <hash>` or `not on main yet`.

## iOS Git Workflow (Flynn Rule)

- Use a dedicated git worktree for each agent workspace, with each worktree on its own branch.
- `~/src/clawline/` stays the canonical deployer baseline; create agent worktrees under `~/src/worktrees/` (for example: `git worktree add ~/src/worktrees/clawline-{agent-name} -b {agent-name}`).
- Tear down with `git worktree remove <path>` (not `rm -rf`).
- YOLO on `main` is still allowed; agents can push to `origin/main` from their branch context when directed.

## Legacy Workspace Note (Before 2026-02-14)

- Legacy `cp -r` workspaces may still exist on eezo (for example `~/src/clawline-{name}/`) and are full repo copies rather than worktrees.
- Do not panic if you encounter one.
- If unstaged changes are yours, commit and push that work first, then proceed.
- If unstaged changes were inherited from a different agent, do not commit them; flag it so the owning agent can resolve it.
- New workspaces are always created with `git worktree add ~/src/worktrees/clawline-{agent-name} -b {agent-name}`.

## visionOS Platform Forks — Mandatory Reference

Before writing any `#if os(visionOS)` block in the shared `ios/Clawline/Clawline/` target, read:

**[`docs/visionos-platform-invariants.md`](./docs/visionos-platform-invariants.md)**

That document defines the **complete list** of valid platform differences. It is authoritative.

**Default rule: share the code.**

If your change adds a new platform fork that is not on the list, or removes/modifies an existing one — stop and raise it with Flynn before committing. Do not make a judgment call.
