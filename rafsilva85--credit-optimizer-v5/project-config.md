# AGENTS.md — SkillFlow Ecosystem

## Project Overview

SkillFlow is the curated marketplace for AI agent skills. This repository (`credit-optimizer-v5`) is one of the flagship skills available on [SkillFlow](https://skillflow.builders). It optimizes Manus AI credit usage, saving 30-75% without quality loss.

## SkillFlow Marketplace

SkillFlow aggregates, verifies, and distributes AI agent skills across all major platforms. Every skill is reviewed by a real person, every publisher is verified through GitHub, and every file is readable before installation.

## How to Use This Skill

1. Download the `SKILL.md` file from this repository
2. Place it in your project's `skills/` directory (e.g., `~/.manus/skills/credit-optimizer/`)
3. The AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) will automatically detect and use it

```bash
# Quick install
mkdir -p ~/.manus/skills/credit-optimizer
curl -o ~/.manus/skills/credit-optimizer/SKILL.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafsilva85/credit-optimizer-v5/main/SKILL.md
