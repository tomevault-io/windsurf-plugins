## Code Rules

- Plan before implementing; explain the approach first
- Use ES6+ JavaScript (async/await, no callbacks)
- Use clear variable names; avoid abbreviations
- Add error handling for all async work
- Add Playwright tests for critical user flows
- Prefer `@specific-files` over `@codebase` for context

---

## CRITICAL – Behavior

### Only act when requested
- Do not change code when the user is asking questions or investigating
- Do not assume the user wants code changes unless they say so
- Do not refactor, restyle, or “improve” without being asked

### When to make changes
- User clearly asks: “Fix X”, “Add Y”, “Implement Z”, “Change A to B”

### When not to make changes
- User asks: “Why is X broken?”, “How does Y work?”, “What’s wrong with Z?”

### If unsure
- Ask for clarification instead of guessing

### Before changing code
- Investigate the issue
- Summarize findings
- Propose an approach and wait for confirmation if the change is non-trivial

### UI / styling
- Do not change colors, fonts, or layout unless explicitly requested

---

## Security

- Use environment variables for secrets (no hardcoded keys)
- Validate and sanitize inputs
- Follow least-privilege access

---

## Cost Control

- Default to Auto mode
- Use specific file references (`@file`) instead of broad codebase search
- Plan work before running tools
