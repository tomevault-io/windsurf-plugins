# Cursor Rules for OpenAPI MCP Codegen

## ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Guidelines

### When to Create ADRs
Create an ADR for:
- ✅ New features that introduce architectural changes
- ✅ Significant refactoring or code reorganization
- ✅ Integration with external systems or tools
- ✅ Changes to core algorithms or processing pipelines
- ✅ Breaking changes to public APIs or CLI interfaces
- ✅ Performance optimizations with trade-offs
- ✅ Security-related changes or fixes
- ✅ Documentation of important bug fixes that affect architecture

### ADR Template Structure
When creating ADRs, use this exact structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Short Descriptive Title]

## Status
**[PROPOSED|ACCEPTED|DEPRECATED|SUPERSEDED]** [✅ *Implemented* | 🚧 *In Progress* | ❌ *Rejected*]

## Context
[Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such.]

### Problems Identified:
1. **Problem 1**: Description
2. **Problem 2**: Description
3. **Problem 3**: Description

### User Request (if applicable):
> "Direct quote from user request or issue"

## Decision
[Describe the response to these forces. This is the statement of what we will do.]

### Implementation Strategy:
1. **Step 1**: Detailed approach
2. **Step 2**: Detailed approach
3. **Step 3**: Detailed approach

## Consequences
[Describe the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences.]

### Positive:
- ✅ **Benefit 1**: Description
- ✅ **Benefit 2**: Description

### Negative (if any):
- ❌ **Trade-off 1**: Description
- ⚠️ **Risk 1**: Description and mitigation

### Architecture Changes (if applicable):
#### Before:
```
[Current architecture diagram/description]
```

#### After:
```
[New architecture diagram/description]
```

### Implementation Status
**[PROPOSED|IN PROGRESS|COMPLETED]** [Status emoji]

[Brief summary of implementation status and any remaining work]
```

### ADR Numbering Convention
- Use sequential numbering: ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.
- Check existing ADRs in `docs/docs/adr/` to determine next number
- Update `docs/sidebars.ts` to include new ADR in the ADRs section

### File Naming Convention
- File path: `docs/docs/adr/ADR-XXX-short-kebab-case-title.md`
- Use kebab-case for the descriptive part
- Example: `ADR-005-a2a-agent-refactoring.md`

### Integration with Documentation
- Always update `docs/sidebars.ts` when adding new ADRs
- Link to relevant ADRs from other documentation pages
- Include ADRs in relevant architecture or design discussions

## Code Quality Guidelines

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Add comprehensive docstrings using Google style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused on single responsibilities

### Template Development
- Use Jinja2 templates in `openapi_mcp_codegen/templates/`
- Include comprehensive comments in templates
- Test templates with multiple OpenAPI specifications
- Document template variables and their expected types

### Testing Requirements
- Add unit tests for new functionality in `tests/`
- Include integration tests for CLI commands
- Test with real OpenAPI specifications from `examples/`
- Validate generated code actually works

### Documentation Updates
- Update README.md if adding new CLI commands or major features
- Create or update relevant documentation in `docs/docs/`
- Include code examples and usage patterns
- Add troubleshooting sections for complex features

## Git Commit Guidelines

### Conventional Commits with DCO
Always use conventional commits format with DCO sign-off:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add smart parameter handling for complex nested objects

- Implement algorithm to detect deeply nested request bodies
- Consolidate parameters into dictionary types when threshold exceeded
- Add configuration options for parameter limits
- Include comprehensive tests and documentation

Closes #123"
```

### Commit Types
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style/formatting changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring without functional changes
- `test:` - Adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

### DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)
Always include DCO sign-off:
- Use `git commit -s` or add `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>`
- This certifies you have the right to contribute the code

## OpenAPI Specific Guidelines

### OpenAPI Enhancement
- Follow OpenAPI Overlay Specification 1.0.0 standards
- Use LLM prompts from `openapi_mcp_codegen/prompt.yaml`
- Validate enhanced specifications are compliant
- Test with multiple OpenAPI specification versions (3.0.x, 3.1.x)

### MCP Server Generation
- Ensure generated servers follow MCP protocol specifications
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Generate comprehensive README files for each server
- Test generated servers with MCP clients

### Example Maintenance
- Keep examples in `examples/` directory up-to-date
- Include real-world OpenAPI specifications
