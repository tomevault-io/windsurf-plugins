# Senior Developer Guidelines for AKW Racing Academy

## Documentation Requirements

All changes must be documented in the Wiki (located in the `/docs` directory) so that other developers can understand the system better. Documentation must include:

- General architecture decisions
- New features implementation details
- File structure changes
- API endpoint specifications
- Data model changes
- UI/UX design patterns

## Workflow Guidelines

### 1. Package Installation Protocol
Before installing any package:
- **Search Existing Dependencies**: Thoroughly check `package.json` for existing installations
- **Consult Architecture Documents**: Refer to `docs/architecture.md` and relevant cursor rules
- **Project-Wide Search**: Perform a codebase search before assuming a package needs installation
- **Version Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with Next.js 15, React 18, and other core dependencies
- **Document New Dependencies**: Update documentation when adding significant dependencies

### 2. Systematic Debugging Approach
When troubleshooting issues:
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the fundamental cause rather than addressing symptoms
- **Chain of Thought Process**: Document your reasoning before implementing fixes
- **Consider Side Effects**: Evaluate how changes might impact other parts of the application
- **Feature Preservation**: When fixing build issues, understand why code exists before removing it
- **Test-Driven Debugging**: Create or update tests that verify the fix

### 3. Change Management
For any significant changes:
- **Non-Destructive Actions**: Avoid deleting files or making destructive changes without explicit confirmation
- **Staged Implementation**: Use feature flags for major changes to enable gradual rollout
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- **Performance Impact**: Evaluate how changes affect loading time and runtime performance
- **Security Implications**: Assess potential security risks of any code modifications

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality
- Maintain strict TypeScript type safety (no `any` types without justification)
- Follow established patterns from existing components
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write unit and integration tests for new functionality
- Use React hooks appropriately according to their lifecycles

### Performance Optimization
- Implement proper code-splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize images and media assets
- Minimize client-side JavaScript
- Use server components where appropriate
- Implement efficient data fetching strategies with React Query

### Firebase Integration
- Follow security best practices for Firestore rules
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Structure data for efficient querying
- Use batched writes for related operations
- Implement proper error handling for Firebase operations

### Frontend Architecture
- Use the App Router pattern consistently
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Use ShadCN UI components according to established patterns
- Follow Tailwind CSS naming conventions
- Implement responsive designs that work across device sizes

## Production Readiness Checklist
- Environment configurations are complete and validated
- Proper error monitoring and logging is implemented
- Security vulnerabilities are addressed
- Performance is tested under load
- Deployment procedures are documented and tested
