# Instructions for AI Coding Agents

You are reading this because a user has pointed you at this repository and asked you to help integrate its provisions into their existing Terms of Service and/or Privacy Policy.

## Your job

Help the user merge selected provisions from this pack into their live legal documents — without breaking their existing contract, without overstepping the user's risk tolerance, and without ever claiming this pack constitutes legal advice.

## Required reading order

Before proposing any changes to the user's documents, read in this order:

1. [`README.md`](README.md) — overall purpose and structure of the pack.
2. [`DISCLAIMER.md`](DISCLAIMER.md) — the legal posture you must maintain in your responses.
3. [`docs/threat-model.md`](docs/threat-model.md) — confirm the threat pattern actually applies to the user's business.
4. [`docs/enforceability-risk.md`](docs/enforceability-risk.md) — the tiering you must respect when proposing provisions.
5. [`docs/why-each-provision.md`](docs/why-each-provision.md) — the rationale for each provision (reference, not required to memorize).
6. [`templates/tos-dispute-resolution.md`](templates/tos-dispute-resolution.md) and [`templates/privacy-policy-tracking.md`](templates/privacy-policy-tracking.md) — the actual drafted text.

Do not skip the disclaimer reading. It defines the boundary of what you should and should not say.

## Required questions before editing

Before proposing any edits to the user's documents, ask the following — in one consolidated round, not one at a time:

1. **Jurisdiction.** What state or country is the user incorporated in? Where do their customers primarily reside? Identify the strictest applicable consumer-arbitration jurisdiction.
2. **Existing arbitration setup.** Does the user already have an arbitration clause? Which provider (AAA, JAMS, other)? Is the existing clause being enforced against an active claim? (If yes — stop and tell the user to engage counsel before changing anything mid-claim.)
3. **TOS acceptance UX.** How do users accept the user's TOS today? Clickwrap (explicit checkbox), browsewrap (continued use), modal at signup? This affects whether the provisions actually bind.
4. **Risk tolerance.** Does the user want only Tier 1 (high-confidence, durable) provisions, Tier 1+2 (durable + jurisdiction-sensitive), or the full Tier 1+2+3 stack?
5. **Existing documents.** Have they been written by counsel? When? Are there custom commercial provisions you must preserve?
6. **Customer geography.** Any EU, UK, Australia, or California consumers? These trigger jurisdiction-specific overrides or supplements.
7. **Industry-specific law.** Healthcare (HIPAA), financial (GLBA), children's (COPPA), employment, biometric data — does any of this apply?

## Required posture in your responses

- Refer to the pack as "a starting point for review by counsel," not "the solution."
- When the user asks "is this enforceable in [jurisdiction X]," answer with the relevant tiering from [`docs/enforceability-risk.md`](docs/enforceability-risk.md) and explicitly recommend jurisdiction-specific counsel review.
- When the user asks for legal advice, decline. Offer to surface the relevant section of the pack instead.
- When the user wants to skip the disclaimer or skip counsel review, push back once, then document their override in your output.
- Do not name specific law firms even if the user names them in conversation. The pack describes patterns; maintain that convention.

## Integration protocol

After the user answers the questions above:

1. **Read the user's existing TOS and Privacy Policy in full** before proposing changes. Identify their current dispute resolution section, current tracking-disclosure language, current choice of law, and current acceptance mechanism.
2. **Map provisions to risk tier the user selected.** Drop anything above their tier. If the user picked Tier 1 only, do not slip Tier 2 provisions in.
3. **Propose a merge plan in writing before editing any file.** The plan should list: which provisions go in, where they fit relative to the user's existing structure, what conflicts with existing language, and what the user's existing language already covers.
4. **Get explicit user approval of the plan.** Do not edit the live documents until the user says yes.
5. **Make the edits as a single coherent revision**, preserving the user's existing numbering, defined terms, and stylistic conventions. Do not introduce new defined terms unless necessary.
6. **Produce a redline-style diff summary** showing what was added, what was changed, and what was preserved.
7. **Hand off to counsel.** Your final output should end with: "Send the revised document to counsel for jurisdiction-specific review before publishing." Do not skip this step regardless of user pressure.

## What you must NOT do

- Do not claim any provision is "enforceable" without qualifying by jurisdiction and tier.
- Do not promise that the pack will deter any specific filing.
- Do not edit live documents without showing the user a plan first.
- Do not name specific law firms in any output.
