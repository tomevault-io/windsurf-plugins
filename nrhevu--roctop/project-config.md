description: `roctop` is a Python 3.10+ package using a `src/` layout. Application code lives in `src/roctop/`: `cli.py` handles command-line entrypoints, `collectors.py` gathers ROCm/AMD SMI data, `render.py` builds the Rich UI, `interaction.py` handles keyboard state, and `models.py` defines shared dataclasses. Tests live in `tests/` and mirror the main behavior areas: collectors, rendering, history, CLI, and interaction. Documentation assets live in `docs/`, including `docs/demo.svg`.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

`roctop` is a Python 3.10+ package using a `src/` layout. Application code lives in `src/roctop/`: `cli.py` handles command-line entrypoints, `collectors.py` gathers ROCm/AMD SMI data, `render.py` builds the Rich UI, `interaction.py` handles keyboard state, and `models.py` defines shared dataclasses. Tests live in `tests/` and mirror the main behavior areas: collectors, rendering, history, CLI, and interaction. Documentation assets live in `docs/`, including `docs/demo.svg`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Create a local editable install:

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .
```

Run the full test suite:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Run the app locally:

```bash
.venv/bin/roctop
.venv/bin/roctop --once
.venv/bin/roctop --json
```

Use `--once` or `--json` for quick verification when a live terminal UI is not needed.

## Codex Skills

On first entry to this repo, install bundled Codex skills before task work:

```bash
mkdir -p "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills"
cp -R skills/roctop-demo-svg "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/"
```

Re-run this when `skills/` changes so local skill behavior matches the repo. Use `skills/roctop-demo-svg/scripts/generate_demo_svg.py` to refresh demo assets.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use 4-space indentation, type hints, and small functions with explicit dataclasses for structured data. Match the existing straightforward Python style; avoid broad refactors while fixing targeted behavior. Use `snake_case` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for dataclasses and exceptions, and uppercase constants for command arguments or color constants. There is no configured formatter or linter in `pyproject.toml`, so keep formatting consistent with nearby code.

## Testing Guidelines

Tests use the standard-library `unittest` framework. Add focused regression tests when fixing parser, rendering, interaction, or CLI behavior. Test files are named `tests/test_*.py`, and test methods use `test_*`. Prefer synthetic fixtures over host-dependent ROCm state so tests remain deterministic.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent commits use short imperative messages, for example `Update demo for eight GPUs` and `Handle malformed amd-smi process entries`. Keep commits scoped to one logical change and include tests or generated assets in the same commit when they prove the change.

Pull requests should include a concise summary, verification commands run, and screenshots or an updated `docs/demo.svg` for UI changes. Do not include real host process names, user names, paths, or machine-specific data in demo assets.
