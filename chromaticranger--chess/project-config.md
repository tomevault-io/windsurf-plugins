# CLAUDE.md - Chess App Guidelines

## Commands
```
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## Code Style
- **Components**: Vue 3 SFCs with `<script setup>` Composition API
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/methods
- **Imports**: Vue imports first, group by type, use specific lodash imports
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with scoped component styles
- **State**: Use `ref()` and `computed()` for reactive state
- **Events**: Properly clean up listeners with lifecycle hooks
- **Performance**: Use event throttling, computed properties
- **Chess Logic**: Document complex game rules with comments

## Project Structure
- `src/components/` - Vue components (Board, Square, Piece)
- `src/assets/` - Chess piece SVGs and static assets
- Chess pieces naming format: {Type}_{Color}.svg (e.g. K_B.svg, P_W.svg)
