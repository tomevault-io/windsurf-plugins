# WireMate

## Project Overview

WireMate is a backoffice system for WireMock. It lets users create, persist, and publish WireMock stubs to a running WireMock server through a guided web UI. Users can organise mocks into projects, clone and move them between projects, and monitor activity via an in-app notification system.

## Core Workflow

1. User opens the backoffice UI
2. User creates or selects a project
3. User constructs a WireMock mapping (request/response JSON) via the UI
4. On save, the mapping is persisted to the database and published to the WireMock server
5. User can clone, move, or re-publish mocks at any time

## Tech Stack

- **Backend** — Java 25, Spring Boot 4.1.0, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL (JSONB), Maven
- **Frontend** — Vue 3.5, TypeScript 6.0, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS 4, mgv-backoffice component library
- **Infrastructure** — Docker & Docker Compose, Nginx (production UI), WireMock 3.13.2

## Infrastructure

- PostgreSQL 17 (Alpine) — port 5432, user `wiremate`, db `wiremate`
- WireMock 3.13.2 — host port 9000 (container port 8080, see `WIREMOCK_PORT` in `.env`)
- Backend API — host port 9001 in Docker (container port 8081, see `BACKEND_PORT` in `.env`); port 8081 when run locally (code in `/service`)
- Frontend (dev) — port 5173 (code in `/UI`)
- Frontend (Docker/production) — host port 9002 via Nginx (container port 80, see `UI_PORT` in `.env`)

## WireMock Mapping Example

The UI builds JSON payloads like the following and sends them to the backend, which persists them and publishes them to WireMock's admin endpoint:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "/interaction/v1/events"
  },
  "response": {
    "status": 201,
    "jsonBody": {},
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "delayDistribution": {
      "type": "uniform",
      "lower": 60,
      "upper": 80
    }
  },
  "persistent": true
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Projects — `/api/projects`

- `GET /` — list all projects
- `GET /:projectId` — get a project with its mocks
- `POST /` — create a project
- `PUT /:projectId` — update a project
- `DELETE /:projectId` — delete a project

### Mocks — `/api/mocks`

- `POST /` — create a mock (auto-publishes to WireMock)
- `GET /:mockId` — get mock details
- `PUT /:mockId` — update a mock
- `GET /projects/:projectId/exists/by-name?name=` — check if a mock name exists in a project
- `GET /projects/:projectId/exists/by-url?url=` — check if a mock URL exists in a project
- `POST /:mockId/clone` — clone a mock
- `PUT /:mockId/move` — move a mock to another project
- `DELETE /:mockId` — delete a mock
- `POST /:mockId/republish` — manually republish a mock to WireMock

### Backoffice — `/api/backoffice`

- `GET /notifications` — retrieve system notifications (paginated, sorted by `createdAt`)
- `DELETE /notifications/:notificationId` — delete a notification
- `DELETE /notifications` — delete all notifications
