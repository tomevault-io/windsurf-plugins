# Agent Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Dynamically and flexibly optimize agent skills using DSPy optimizers, inspired by https://github.com/instavm/skill-optimization. The system will take agent skills (prompts/tools/configs) and optimize them against defined metrics using DSPy's optimization capabilities.

**Framework:** Agno
**Language:** Python
**Optimization Engine:** DSPy

This project follows the Better Agents standard for building production-ready AI agents.

## Core Principles

### 1. Scenario Agent Testing

Scenario allows for end-to-end validation of multi-turn conversations and real-world scenarios. Most agent functionality should be tested with Scenario tests, and these MUST be created and maintained strictly using the LangWatch MCP (do not access external Scenario docs).

**CRITICAL**: Every new agent feature MUST be tested with Scenario tests (use LangWatch MCP to access the docs) before considering it complete.

- Write simulation tests for multi-turn conversations
- Validate edge cases
- Ensure business value is delivered
- Test different conversation paths

Best practices:
- NEVER check for regex or word matches in the agent's response, use judge criteria instead
- Use functions on the Scenario scripts for things that can be checked deterministically (tool calls, database entries, etc) instead of relying on the judge
- For the rest, use the judge criteria to check if agent is reaching the desired goal and
- When broken, run on single scenario at a time to debug and iterate faster, not the whole suite
- Write as few scenarios as possible, try to cover more ground with few scenarios, as they are heavy to run
- If user made 1 request, just 1 scenario might be enough, run it at the end of the implementation to check if it works
- ALWAYS consult the Scenario docs **through the LangWatch MCP** on how to install and write scenarios.

### 2. Prompt Management

**ALWAYS** use LangWatch Prompt CLI for managing prompts:

- Use the LangWatch MCP to learn about prompt management, search for Prompt CLI docs
- Never hardcode prompts in your application code
- Store all prompts in the `prompts/` directory as YAML files, use "langwatch prompt create <name>" to create a new prompt
- Run `langwatch prompt sync` after changing a prompt to update the registry

Example prompt structure:
```yaml
# prompts/my_prompt.yaml
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.7
messages:
  - role: system
    content: |
      Your system prompt here
  - role: user
    content: |
      {{ user_input }}
```

DO NOT use hardcoded prompts in your application code, example:

BAD:
```
Agent(prompt="You are a helpful assistant.")
```

GOOD:
```python
import langwatch

prompt = langwatch.prompts.get("my_prompt")
Agent(prompt=prompt.prompt)
```

```typescript
import { LangWatch } from "langwatch";

const langwatch = new LangWatch({
  apiKey: process.env.LANGWATCH_API_KEY
});

const prompt = await langwatch.prompts.get("my_prompt")
Agent(prompt=prompt!.prompt)
```

Prompt fetching is very reliable when using the prompts cli because the files are local (double check they were created with the CLI and are listed on the prompts.json file).
DO NOT add try/catch around it and DO NOT duplicate the prompt here as a fallback

Explore the prompt management get started and data model docs if you need more advanced usages such as compiled prompts with variables or messages list.

### 3. Evaluations for specific cases

Only write evaluations for specific cases:

- When a RAG is implemented, so we can evaluate the accuracy given many sample queries (using an LLM to compare expected with generated outputs)
- For classification tasks, e.g. categorization, routing, simple true/false detection, etc
- When the user asks and you are sure an agent scenario wouldn't test the behaviour better

This is because evaluations are good for things when you have a lot of examples, with avery clear
definition of what is correct and what is not (that is, you can just compare expected with generated)
and you are looking for single input/output pairs. This is not the case for multi-turn agent flows.

Create evaluations in Jupyter notebooks under `tests/evaluations/`:

- Generate csv example datasets yourself to be read by pandas with plenty of examples
- Use LangWatch Evaluations API to create evaluation notebooks and track the evaluation results
- Use either a simple == comparison or a direct (e.g. openai) LLM call to compare expected with generated if possible and not requested otherwise

### 4. General good practices

- ALWAYS use the package manager cli commands to init, add and install new dependencies, DO NOT guess package versions, DO NOT add them to the dependencies file by hand.
- When setting up, remember to load dotenv for the tests so env vars are available
- Double check the guidelines on AGENTS.md after the end of the implementation.

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

### Agno Framework

**Always use the Agno MCP for learning:**

- The Agno MCP server provides real-time documentation
