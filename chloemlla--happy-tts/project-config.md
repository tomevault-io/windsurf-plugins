# Repository Guidelines

Do not write to a super file!!!! Do not write to a super file!!!! Do not write to a super file!!!!
All actual build and test commands must be executed within the GitHub workflow; running them on your local machine is prohibited—local device performance is insufficient.

Do not execute any installation commands; simply modify the code.

Regarding the garbled text issue you mentioned, it has been confirmed that it is not caused by file corruption. The file can be read correctly in PowerShell using the following method:
powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
Get-Content -Encoding UTF8 file-path
Each time you complete the addition or modification of a feature according to my requirements, a commit message should be automatically generated and submitted after you finish modifying the code. When submitting a GPG key, you can temporarily omit the signature.auto push

apply_patch 在当前环境可用。

  原因
  之前失败是因为 patch 头写成了：

  *** Begin Patch ***

  正确格式必须是：

  *** Begin Patch
  ...
  *** End Patch

  末尾不能多写 ***。工具只认精确的 *** Begin Patch 作为第一行。


## Project Structure & Module Organization

Synapse is a TypeScript full-stack TTS platform. Backend source lives in `src/`: `routes/` define HTTP endpoints, `controllers/` handle request/response logic, `services/` contain business logic, `models/` hold database schemas, and `middleware/` contains auth, WAF, rate limiting, and request guards. The backend entry point is `src/app.ts`, with startup helpers under `src/app/`.

Frontend code is in `frontend/src/`: routing in `App.tsx`, entry in `main.tsx`, reusable UI in `components/`, API clients in `api/`, and hooks in `hooks/`. Tests are primarily in `src/tests/`; frontend-adjacent tests may sit beside the relevant module.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm run dev`: start backend and frontend together.
- `npm run dev:backend`: run the Express API with `nodemon` and `ts-node`.
- `npm run dev:frontend`: run the Vite frontend on port 3001.
- `npm run build:backend`: compile backend TypeScript, copy templates, and obfuscate output.
- `npm run build:minimal`: run the minimal full build path.
- `npm run test`: run Jest with open-handle detection.
- `npm run test:auth`: run authentication tests only.
- `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit`: preferred frontend verification for TypeScript-only changes.

Avoid installing dependencies unless the task requires it; prefer existing lockfiles and installed packages.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use TypeScript and follow the existing 2-space indentation style. Prefer functional service exports over classes. Use `camelCase` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for React components and types, and suffixes such as `*Routes.ts`, `*Controller.ts`, `*Service.ts`, and `*.test.ts`. Keep middleware order in `src/app.ts` intact unless the security impact is reviewed.

## Testing Guidelines

Jest with `ts-jest` is configured through `jest.config.js` and `tsconfig.jest.json`. Place backend tests in `src/tests/` and name them after the module or behavior under test, for example `authController.test.ts` or `securityPipeline.test.ts`. Use focused commands such as `npm run test -- --testNamePattern="should generate audio"`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use conventional commit messages matching the project history: `feat: add feature`, `fix: resolve issue`, `docs: update guide`, or `chore: maintenance`. Reference related issues or alerts in the commit message when relevant. Pull requests should describe the change, list verification performed, link issues, and include screenshots for visible frontend changes.

After each modification to the code, a commit must be made and the changes pushed to the remote repository.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Production requires explicit `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `JWT_SECRET`. TTS needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. Storage is selected with `USER_STORAGE_MODE` (`mongo`, `mysql`, or `file`). New routes must include an appropriate rate limiter and should not bypass JWT or admin authorization checks.
