# AGENTS.md - Personal Knowledge Base Schema

> Adapted from [Andrej Karpathy's LLM Knowledge Base](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) architecture.
> Instead of ingesting external articles, this system compiles knowledge from your own AI conversations.

## The Compiler Analogy

```
daily/          = source code    (your conversations - the raw material)
LLM             = compiler       (extracts and organizes knowledge)
knowledge/      = executable     (structured, queryable knowledge base)
lint            = test suite     (health checks for consistency)
queries         = runtime        (using the knowledge)
```

You don't manually organize your knowledge. You have conversations, and the LLM handles the synthesis, cross-referencing, and maintenance.

## Architecture

### Layer 1: `daily/` - Conversation Logs (Immutable Source)

Daily logs capture what happened in your AI coding sessions. These are the "raw sources" - append-only, never edited after the fact.

```
daily/
├── 2026-04-01.md
├── 2026-04-02.md
├── ...
```

Each file follows this format:

```markdown
# Daily Log: YYYY-MM-DD

## Sessions

### Session (HH:MM) - Brief Title

**Context:** What the user was working on.

**Key Exchanges:**
- User asked about X, assistant explained Y
- Decided to use Z approach because...
- Discovered that W doesn't work when...

**Decisions Made:**
- Chose library X over Y because...
- Architecture: went with pattern Z

**Lessons Learned:**
- Always do X before Y to avoid...
- The gotcha with Z is that...

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Follow up on X
- [ ] Refactor Y when time permits
```

### Layer 2: `knowledge/` - Compiled Knowledge (LLM-Owned)

The LLM owns this directory entirely. Humans read it but rarely edit it directly.

```
knowledge/
├── index.md              # Master catalog - every article with one-line summary
├── log.md                # Append-only chronological build log
├── concepts/             # Atomic knowledge articles
├── connections/          # Cross-cutting insights linking 2+ concepts
└── qa/                   # Filed query answers (compounding knowledge)
```

### Layer 3: This File (AGENTS.md)

The schema that tells the LLM how to compile and maintain the knowledge base. This is the "compiler specification."

---

## Structural Files

### `knowledge/index.md` - Master Catalog

A table listing every knowledge article. This is the primary retrieval mechanism - the LLM reads this FIRST when answering any query, then selects relevant articles to read in full.

Format:

```markdown
# Knowledge Base Index

| Article | Summary | Compiled From | Updated |
|---------|---------|---------------|---------|
| [[concepts/supabase-auth]] | Row-level security patterns and JWT gotchas | daily/2026-04-02.md | 2026-04-02 |
| [[connections/auth-and-webhooks]] | Token verification patterns shared across Supabase auth and Stripe webhooks | daily/2026-04-02.md, daily/2026-04-04.md | 2026-04-04 |
```

### `knowledge/log.md` - Build Log

Append-only chronological record of every compile, query, and lint operation.

Format:

```markdown
# Build Log

## [2026-04-01T14:30:00] compile | Daily Log 2026-04-01
- Source: daily/2026-04-01.md
- Articles created: [[concepts/nextjs-project-structure]], [[concepts/tailwind-setup]]
- Articles updated: (none)

## [2026-04-02T09:00:00] query | "How do I handle auth redirects?"
- Consulted: [[concepts/supabase-auth]], [[concepts/nextjs-middleware]]
- Filed to: [[qa/auth-redirect-handling]]
```

---

## Article Formats

### Concept Articles (`knowledge/concepts/`)

One article per atomic piece of knowledge. These are facts, patterns, decisions, preferences, and lessons extracted from your conversations.

```markdown
---
title: "Concept Name"
aliases: [alternate-name, abbreviation]
tags: [domain, topic]
sources:
  - "daily/2026-04-01.md"
  - "daily/2026-04-03.md"
created: 2026-04-01
updated: 2026-04-03
---

# Concept Name

[2-4 sentence core explanation]

## Key Points

- [Bullet points, each self-contained]

## Details

[Deeper explanation, encyclopedia-style paragraphs]

## Related Concepts

- [[concepts/related-concept]] - How it connects

## Sources

- [[daily/2026-04-01.md]] - Initial discovery during project setup
- [[daily/2026-04-03.md]] - Updated after debugging session
```

### Connection Articles (`knowledge/connections/`)

Cross-cutting synthesis linking 2+ concepts. Created when a conversation reveals a non-obvious relationship.

```markdown
---
title: "Connection: X and Y"
connects:
  - "concepts/concept-x"
  - "concepts/concept-y"
sources:
  - "daily/2026-04-04.md"
created: 2026-04-04
updated: 2026-04-04
---

# Connection: X and Y

## The Connection

[What links these concepts]

## Key Insight

[The non-obvious relationship discovered]

## Evidence

[Specific examples from conversations]

## Related Concepts

- [[concepts/concept-x]]
- [[concepts/concept-y]]
```

### Q&A Articles (`knowledge/qa/`)

Filed answers from queries. Every complex question answered by the system can be permanently stored, making future queries smarter.

```markdown
---
title: "Q: Original Question"
question: "The exact question asked"
consulted:
  - "concepts/article-1"
