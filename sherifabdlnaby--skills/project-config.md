## Toolchain (mise)

This project uses [**mise**](https://mise.jdx.dev) to pin tools, expose tasks, and wire git hooks. `mise.toml` is the source of truth. Don't install tools by hand or add ad-hoc scripts; add a mise
tool or task instead.

**Setup** (once, and per new worktree): `mise trust && mise run setup`.

**Run via mise.** Run `mise run check` before you call work done. A few examples, not the full list:

```sh
mise run check          # all linters/formatters/validators (alias: lint); add --fix to auto-fix
mise run test           # placeholder (no automated tests yet)
mise tasks              # discover every task
mise run <task> --help  # a task's flags
```

Prefer `mise run <task>` over calling the tool directly, so local, hooks, and CI stay in sync.

## Git hooks (hk)

Commits run [hk](https://hk.jdx.dev), the same `check` CI runs, to format and lint staged files. Fix failures with `mise run check --fix`. Don't disable steps to push a commit through;
`git commit --no-verify` skips hooks for a WIP commit. `mise run setup` installs the hooks into
git *config* (`hook.<name>.command`) — `.git/hooks/` stays empty, that doesn't mean they're absent.

## Extending the setup

Changing tools, tasks, env, or hooks? Edit the config, don't bolt on scripts, then run `mise run check`. Where things live:

- **`mise.toml`**: the source of truth for `[tools]`, `[tasks]`, `[env]`/`[vars]`, `[settings]`, and `[hooks]`.
- **`mise.lock`**: resolved versions plus checksums. Commit it; regenerate with `mise install` after a `[tools]` change.
- **`.config/`**: everything that would otherwise clutter the root — `hk.pkl` plus each linter's config (`typos.toml`, `lychee.toml`, `rumdl.toml`, `yamllint.yml`, `betterleaks.toml`). Tools that
  can't find a config there are pointed at it from `.config/hk.pkl`.
- **`.config/hk.pkl`**: the pre-commit and `check` pipeline (linters and formatters, in Pkl). Add or edit a lint step here.
- **`.config/mise/`**: project-local mise state (the setup stamp is gitignored). File tasks can live in `.config/mise/tasks/`.

## CI not visible in the tree

Beyond `.github/workflows/`: CodeQL default setup, Dependabot alerts + security updates, secret
scanning with push protection, and a `main` ruleset requiring the `check` job are configured in
repo settings. Don't scaffold replacements for them.

## Releases

Shipping a change under `skills/` or `hooks/` needs both manifest versions bumped to the same
value (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`) — `mise run version:check`
enforces this pre-push and in CI. A release cuts itself: merging a version bump to `main` tags and
publishes automatically; there's no separate release step to run by hand.
