# Agent Notes

This file applies to the whole repository. For fuller contributor guidance, read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md); this file repeats the essentials agents
are most likely to need during edits.

## Project Context

- This is a Deno-first TypeScript library that is published to npm via generated
  output.
- Source code lives under `src/`. Tests usually sit beside the module they cover
  and use fixtures from `tests/fixtures/http`.
- The `npm/` directory is generated package output. Prefer editing source files
  under `src/` and regenerate npm output only when the task explicitly calls for
  it.
- The default development branch is `dev`.

## Commands

- Run the full test suite with `deno task test`.
- Run a targeted test with `deno task test path/to/file.test.ts`.
- Run serial tests with `deno task test:serial path/to/file.test.ts` when
  debugging or limiting live Yahoo request concurrency.
- Run schema generation with `deno task schema` after changing exported
  interfaces marked with `@yf-schema`.
- Use `deno fmt` and `deno lint` for formatting and linting.
- Build npm output with `deno task build:npm` when generated npm artifacts are
  required.

## Testing And Fixtures

- Tests use `fetch-mock-cache` and cached HTTP fixtures for repeatability.
- New module tests should call `setupCache()` from `tests/common.ts` when they
  touch Yahoo HTTP responses.
- `FETCH_DEVEL=nocache` forces live network tests without cache.
- `FETCH_DEVEL=recache` updates cache for failing tests. Be careful with fixture
  churn, and do not recache files ending in `.static.json` or `.fake.json`.
- Before committing recached fixtures, inspect their HTTP status and payload. Do
  not commit transient failures such as rate limits, consent interstitials,
  timeouts, or upstream 5xx responses as replacements for successful fixtures.

## Schema And Validation

- TypeScript interfaces in module files are the source of truth for runtime
  validation schemas.
- If a module file has `@yf-schema`, keep the generated `.schema.json` file in
  sync with `deno task schema`.
- Prefer updating typed interfaces and validation schemas together with focused
  tests that cover the Yahoo response shape involved.
- When Yahoo adds a response field, model it as required first. Make it optional
  only when other cached valid responses demonstrate that the field is absent,
  and add descriptive JSDoc for newly exposed fields.

## Editing Guidelines

- Preserve existing Deno import style, including `.ts` extensions for local
  imports.
- Avoid editing generated directories, dependency directories, coverage output,
  or docs output unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Check `git status` before and after changes, and do not overwrite unrelated
  local work.

## Commit Messages

- Use Conventional Commits with scope, e.g. "fix(quote):". This is important for
  `semantic-release` to publish correct versions.
- The commit body should include a concise summary of motivation and changes.
- Always end with: Co-authored-by: <Assistant> (<model>, reasoning: <high>)
  <<email>> `email` part may be ommitted. The rest is best effort, ask the user
  if not sure. For Codex, ~/.codex/config.toml has top level `model` and
  `model_reasoning_effort`.
