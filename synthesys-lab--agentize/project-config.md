- When answering me, always put a "Dude, carefully read my response to determine what to do next." at the end of your answer.
- Use `python` not `python2` or `python3` unless specified.
  - `README.md` already asks users to manage their own Python environment.
  - `python3` essentially falls back to the system default Python version, which may be `python2` or some old `python3` without specific packages installed.
- When mentioning issue or PR, if not specified, it always refers to this project repository.
- When modifying the vscode extention in `vscode/` folder, please do `make vscode-plugin` to build the extension to make sure your code has no syntax issues.
- When committing, use `docs/git-msg-tags.md` to determine proper commit message tags. Briefly,
  - summarize the overall change in this commit.
  - describe changes to each modified file.
  - if applicable, mention the related issue.
  - if applicable, mention the status of **ALL** the test cases.
- This project aims at
  - Creating a AI-powered SDK to faciliate generic software engineering.
  - Bootstrapping the development of this SDK using AI.
  - Thus, changing `.md` files is changing the project core modules themselves.
- To test whole the project, run `TEST_SHELLS="bash zsh" make test-fast`
  - If full `make test` maybe fails due to missing sandbox framework support. It is ok to skip it for now.
  - To test a specific module, look at all `*.sh` files in the `tests/` folder.
  - To add a new test, create a new `*.sh` file in the `tests/` folder, and append it to `test-all.sh`.
  - However, DO NOT be too obsessed to achieve 100% test coverage (at least for this project).
    - Many designs are soft and subjective, they shall be tested and evaluated by further dogfooding or real-world usage.
    - Before creating a test, please think twice if it is subjectively soft or objectively hard.
- DO NOT use `cd` in CLI synthesized scripts.
  - Use relative paths to this project root only, and `cd` permission is disabled for this CLI.
  - However, it is allowed to use `cd` if you create `.sh` scripts committed to this project.
- `README.md` in each folder shall decribe the folder purpose and organization.
  - If not, please create one!
- Each source code file shall have a documentation with the same name but with `.md` suffix.
  - For example, `src/module.sh` shall have `src/module.md` to describe its design rationale and usage.
  - The documentation shall follow the `\document-guideline` skill.
- Keep in mind, all the rules developed in this project should be as project-neutral as possible.
- Use `.tmp` to store your temporary plans or notes.
- Focus on the rationale of the design itself when documenting it.
  DO NOT mention any incremental changes of a history design!
  - **DO NOT**: this design reduces 30% LoC compared to previous design.
  - **DO**: this design simplifies the architecture by providing a unified interface across the modules.
- This project is still at its early stage.
  - Feel free to make breaking changes to the design.
  - Do not over-worry about backward compatibility.
