# AGENTS.md

MIRAGE is a package that allows you to mount anything as a filesystem and make it usable by AI Agents.

## Repo Layout

This monorepo hosts two sibling implementations:

- `python/` — the Python package (`mirage/`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`).
- `typescript/` — the TypeScript monorepo (`packages/core`, `packages/node`, etc.).
- `docs/`, `examples/`, `.github/` — shared across both.

Run Python commands from `python/`, TypeScript commands from `typescript/`.

## Development Setup

This project uses `uv` for Python dependency management. Install dependencies with:

```bash
cd python && uv sync --all-extras
```

### Running examples

Examples under `examples/python/` load `.env.development` from the repo root (cwd-relative). To keep cwd at the root while using the `python/` venv, invoke the venv interpreter directly:

```bash
./python/.venv/bin/python examples/python/s3/s3.py
```

Avoid `uv --directory python run ...` for examples — it changes cwd to `python/` and breaks `load_dotenv(".env.development")`.

## Backward Compatibility

- No need to consider backward compatibility for the code.

## Create a PR

When asked to create a PR, please follow the following steps:

1. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` from the repo root to lint and format the code.
1. Run `cd python && uv run pytest` to run the Python tests.
1. Run `git add -A` to add all changes.
1. Run `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to create a new branch.
1. Run `git commit -m "<commit-message>"` to commit the changes.
1. Run `git push origin <branch-name>` to push the changes to the remote repository.
1. Run `gh pr create --title "<pr-title>" --body "<pr-body>"` to create a PR.

## Commands

### Linting and Formatting

After making major changes, run pre-commit from the repo root to ensure code quality:

```bash
./python/.venv/bin/pre-commit run --all-files
```

Invoke the venv's `pre-commit` binary directly (not via `uv --directory python run`) so cwd stays at the repo root — otherwise `git ls-files` only lists files under `python/` and `examples/` gets silently skipped.

## Type Conventions

- Paths must always be represented as `PathSpec`, never raw strings. All functions that accept or return paths use `list[str | PathSpec]` where `str` is for text arguments and `PathSpec` is for paths. Never pass a path as a plain `str` — wrap it in `PathSpec`.

## Rules

- Avoid add any comments or docstrings on the top of the file.
- Do not create nested functions.
- Add type to Args for docstring.
- Do not add comment after each line of code in the format of "# 10MB - trigger segmentation for files larger than this". The most you can add is "# 10MB".
- For all imports you need to put to the top of the file. Don't have imports within each function.
- **No circular imports.** If putting an import at the top would cause a cycle, that's a sign the dependency direction is wrong — fix the design (dependency injection, splitting modules, moving the shared piece to a leaf), don't paper over it with function-local lazy imports. Verify by checking that running `cd python && uv run python -c "import <every changed module>"` succeeds without ImportError.
- **Never silently swallow exceptions.** `try: ... except: pass` (or `except SomeError: pass`) hides real bugs. If you genuinely need to ignore an error, log it (`logger.debug(...)`) or document loudly why it's safe. Default behavior should be: let the exception propagate. Especially never silently swallow `RuntimeError` — it usually signals something deeper (event loop in wrong state, recursion limit, etc.) that you need to actually fix.
- **Never call `asyncio.run()` inside a sync function that might be invoked under an outer event loop.** It will raise `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`. If you need async behavior from a sync API, either: (a) make the calling function `async`, (b) operate on the underlying sync state directly (e.g. write to a dict instead of calling an async setter), or (c) use a sync alternative of the same library (e.g. `redis.Redis` instead of `redis.asyncio.Redis`). Do NOT wrap with `try/except RuntimeError: pass` — that masks the bug AND leaks the unawaited coroutine.
- Please don't change any file name unless I ask you to do so.
- Don't add too many printings or comments in the code.
- Don't add README.md unless I ask you to do so.
- Use uv add to install new dependencies.
