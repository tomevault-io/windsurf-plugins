# AGENTS.md

## Project Identity

This is **Spec-Driven Steroids** (`spec-driven-steroids`), a CLI tool and template bundle that injects a strict Spec-Driven Development workflow (requirements → design → tasks → implementation) into AI coding tools. It ships as a single public npm package with a `sds` alias.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript 5.9, ES2022 target, NodeNext modules, strict mode
- **Runtime**: Node.js >=20
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 10 (workspace monorepo)
- **CLI**: Commander.js 11 + Inquirer 9 + Chalk 5
- **Testing**: Vitest 2.x with v8 coverage
- **Build**: `tsc` (no bundler)
- **Publishing**: Changesets → npm (with provenance)

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for system boundaries and [STYLEGUIDE.md](STYLEGUIDE.md) for code conventions.

## Essential Commands

```bash
pnpm build          # Build all packages
pnpm test           # Run all tests (requires prior build)
pnpm typecheck      # Type-check all packages (no emit)
pnpm lint           # Lint all packages
pnpm test:coverage  # Run tests with coverage
pnpm changeset      # Create a changeset entry
```

When writing code here, always run `pnpm typecheck` before considering a change complete.

## Agent Constraints

- **Code comments policy**: Add code comments only when they are highly necessary to explain non-obvious intent, workarounds, or critical constraints. Do not add comments that merely restate what the code does.
- **Import style**: Use ES module imports only. All packages are `"type": "module"`. Use `.js` extensions in relative imports (TypeScript resolves them correctly).
- **Source layout**: The CLI source lives in `packages/cli/src/`. Tests live in `packages/cli/tests/` (not co-located). Shared test utilities are in `packages/test-utils/src/`.
- **Build before test**: Integration tests import from `dist/`, so `pnpm build` (or `tsc`) must run before `pnpm test`.
- **Package scope**: The `packages/cli` package is the only public package. `packages/test-utils` and `packages/landing-page` are private.
- **Platform template changes**: When editing template files under `packages/cli/templates/`, ensure corresponding E2E tests in `packages/cli/tests/integration/` are updated because many tests verify template content assertions.
- **Template source**: When adding or modifying template files, update `STEROIDS_SKILL_DIRS` and `STEROIDS_FILES` in `packages/cli/src/cli/index.ts` if the new files must be tracked for clean and injection.
- **No direct implementation requests**: Agents must never skip the Spec-Driven phases. Implementation must always follow the full flow (`requirements → design → tasks → implementation`). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the PR process.
