# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

<!-- BEGIN:chat-skill-rules -->
# Always use the local `chat` skill for this repo

For any request that touches this workspace's frontend code, default to the local skill at `skills/chat/SKILL.md` even if the user does not explicitly mention `$chat`.

Treat the `chat` skill as the baseline workflow for UI, routing, forms, validation, state, settings, and frontend refactors in this repository.
