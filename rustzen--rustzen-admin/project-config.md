# Repository Rules

## Source of Truth

- Current facts: source code, then [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md), then [docs/guides/](./docs/guides/).
- AI contribution constraints: [docs/guides/ai-coding-rules.md](./docs/guides/ai-coding-rules.md).
- Command source: root `justfile`; inspect the target before running it.

## Reading Order

1. Read `README.md`.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`.
3. Read the nearest subdirectory `AGENTS.md`.
4. Read only the relevant guide in `docs/guides/`.
5. Use `docs/reference/` only for deeper context.

## Boundaries

- RustZen classification: Web/Rust A-class reference layout.
- Shared auth and permission capability code lives in `crates/auth/`.
- Backend lives in `apps/server/`.
- Migrations live in `apps/server/migrations/`.
- Frontend lives in `apps/web/`.
- Deployment assets live in `deploy/`.
- Root keeps workspace metadata, docs, command entry points, and shared crates.
- Deployment contract uses `target/rustzen-admin`, `/opt/rustzen-admin`,
  `deploy/rustzen-admin.service`, and `deploy/setup-layout.sh`.
- Do not apply Peripheral Vercel, Tauri client, or legacy `zen-server` /
  `zen-web` layout rules to this repository.
- Do not add systemd `User`/`Group`, hardening, or install-path permission
  changes without reviewing `deploy/setup-layout.sh` and the `/opt` runtime
  directory ownership model together.

## Working Rules

- Prefer the smallest viable change.
- Do not add fallback or compatibility logic.
- Keep stable rules in `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/guides/`.
- Keep subdirectory `AGENTS.md` files thin.
- Do not use `docs/reference/` or `docs/history/` as default implementation truth.
- SQLite is the default storage backend.
- PostgreSQL-first migration history is archived under
  `apps/server/migrations/postgresql_legacy/`.
- Update code, docs, and commands together when structure changes.
- Keep task completion tied to the task's verification commands before updating status.
