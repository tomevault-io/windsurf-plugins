# Agent Guidelines

## Pre-commit checks

Run typecheck, lint, build, and tests before every commit and push:

```sh
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run build
pnpm run test
```

Typecheck and lint are enforced automatically by a husky pre-commit hook.

## Committing and pushing

When the current branch is a working / feature branch (anything other than `main`), it is fine to `git commit` and `git push` without asking for explicit confirmation each time — keep the branch up to date as you make progress. Run the pre-commit checks above first, fix everything they surface, and only then commit + push.

Do **not** push directly to `main`, force-push (`--force` / `--force-with-lease`), or rewrite already-published history without explicit user instruction.

## Fix all issues found by checks

Any errors or warnings surfaced by typecheck, lint, audit, or tests are **our responsibility to fix** — even if they appear to be pre-existing. Do not skip, ignore, or work around them with `--no-verify`. If a pre-commit hook fails, fix the underlying issues before committing.

## Flaky tests

Flaky tests are **not acceptable** — they must be fixed immediately when discovered. A test that intermittently fails erodes CI trust and masks real regressions. Common causes:

- **Timing assertions** (e.g., `expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(X)`) — use generous thresholds or assert behavior instead of timing.
- **Process lifecycle races** — add explicit readiness signals (e.g., IPC `ready` messages) instead of relying on timing.
- **Platform-specific quirks** — Windows `taskkill` and PowerShell Restart Manager can be slow; account for this in timeouts and assertions.

If you encounter a flaky test during a run, investigate and fix it before continuing with other work.

## Comments

- **Be concise.** Don't write multi-paragraph comments to justify a small change. One sentence beats five.
- **Never reference plan steps, phases, tracks, or stage IDs** (e.g. "Phase 3 §17", "Track M-7", "Stage W-4"). Plans change; the comment becomes a lie within hours and meaningless once the feature ships. Describe what the code does, not what plan brought it here.
- **Don't narrate history** ("This used to do X, now it does Y"). The git log carries that.

## Follow instructions

When the user gives explicit direction (e.g., "move away from takeovers", "use the unified primitive"), apply it everywhere — search the whole codebase for remaining offenders. **Never silently defer or skip part of an instruction without asking.** If something looks risky, ask; don't decide unilaterally to leave it for later.

## Post-change review: deduplication

After creating or modifying code, check for duplicated logic before committing:

- Look for repeated filter predicates, conditions, or expressions that could be extracted into a shared variable, computed property, or helper.
- If two call sites must stay in sync (e.g., a visibility check and the action it guards), extract the shared logic so they cannot diverge.
