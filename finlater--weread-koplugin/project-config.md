# WeRead KOReader Plugin

## Project Overview

KOReader plugin for reading WeRead (微信读书) books and MP articles on e-ink devices. Lua codebase running inside KOReader's plugin system.

## Language

- Code, variable names, commit messages: English
- User-facing strings: wrapped in `_()` for i18n, Chinese translations in `weread/lib/i18n.lua`
- Communication with user: Simplified Chinese (简体中文)

## Architecture

```
main.lua                       Plugin entry, dependency construction, and module composition
weread/lib/mixin.lua          Collision-safe composition of feature methods into the plugin class
weread/lib/migrations.lua     Settings and per-book storage migrations

weread/lib/reader_lifecycle.lua KOReader lifecycle and reader-state orchestration
weread/lib/client.lua         HTTP client (cookie-auth Web API + Bearer-auth gateway API)
weread/lib/book_store.lua     Per-book metadata, reading-state, and article-list persistence
weread/lib/content.lua        Content decoding (e_0/e_1/e_2/e_3), EPUB/HTML generation

weread/lib/i18n.lua           Chinese translations (zh table, _() wrapper)
weread/lib/position_mapper.lua Pure KOReader ↔ WeRead chapter/offset mapping
weread/lib/progress_sync.lua  Automatic progress-sync state machine and safety gate
weread/lib/read_report.lua    Reading-report state machine, context refresh, retries

## Key Conventions

### Module Namespace

- Keep every project-owned Lua module under the `weread/` namespace directory.
- Put non-UI modules in `weread/lib/` and load them with `require("weread.lib.<module>")`.
- Put UI and presentation modules in `weread/ui/` and load them with `require("weread.ui.<module>")`.
- Do not add project-owned modules under root-level `lib/` or `ui/`, and do not use bare `lib.*` or `ui.*` module keys. KOReader-owned imports such as `require("ui/widget/menu")` are not affected.
- Keep only KOReader plugin entry files such as `main.lua` and `_meta.lua` at the plugin root.

### KOReader Plugin API

- Plugin extends `WidgetContainer`, registered via `self.ui.menu:registerToMainMenu(self)`
- UI widgets: `Menu`, `InfoMessage`, `ConfirmBox`, `InputDialog`, `ButtonDialog`
- Event loop: `UIManager:show()`, `UIManager:close()`, `UIManager:scheduleIn()`
- Events: `onReaderReady` (book opened), `onCloseDocument` (book closed), `onFlushSettings`
- **`scheduleIn(0)` blocks the event loop** — use `scheduleIn(0.1)` minimum for cooperative multitasking
- Menu items support: `text`, `mandatory` (right-aligned), `post_text`, `callback`, `checked_func`, `enabled_func`, `sub_item_table_func`, `separator`, `keep_menu_open`
- Menu has built-in pagination (swipe, page indicators, search via page indicator tap)

### Settings Pattern

```lua
local val = self.settings:get("key")  -- reads with default from defaults table
self.settings:set("key", val)
self.settings:flush()                  -- must call to persist
```

### Network Pattern

```lua
self:runNetworkAction(label, function()
    -- runs inside NetworkMgr:runWhenOnline
    -- return string → shown as info; error → shown as error
end)
```

### Translation Pattern

```lua
local PluginUtil = require("weread.lib.plugin_util")
local _ = PluginUtil.tr
_("English key")                    -- simple
T(_("Template %1"), value)          -- with substitution (ffi/util.template)

-- In weread/lib/i18n.lua, add to zh table:
["English key"] = "中文翻译",
```

### Loop Variable

Use `_i` (not `_`) in `for _i, item in ipairs(...)` to avoid shadowing the `_()` translation function.

### Menu Maintenance

Whenever a menu item is added, removed, renamed, or moved:
