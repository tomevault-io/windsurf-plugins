# CLAUDE.md: handoff context for AI sessions

This file captures state for an AI assistant resuming work on
**open-rgs**. Read this first; it points you at the right specs and
tells you what's done, what's decided, and what's pending.

## What this project is

**open-rgs**, an MIT-licensed Remote Game Server. Bun-native
orchestrator + snap-in TypeScript maths + pluggable platform adapters +
binary-msgpack transport. The runtime layer between casino game math
and operator wallets.

Read `README.md` for the elevator pitch. Read `specs/README.md` for
the spec corpus. Read `specs/00-overview.md` for what we're building.

## Repo layout

This is a Bun-workspaces monorepo:

```

## What's shipped

- All published `@open-rgs/*` packages: the engine (contract, core, log,
  platform-mock, adapter-kit, adapter-test-kit, client, simulator) plus 19
  slot libraries. adapter-artube is private, see below
- `apps/site`: public docs site (Astro static SSG)
- Specs `00-10` + `12` + ADRs
- `deploy/`: reference Docker + k8s templates

## Working principles (KISS + don't-rot)

The user's stated north star is "make sure it won't rot since it's
MIT open source." Read `specs/10-design-philosophy.md` for the full
list. Short version:

- Keep public surface tiny (only `contract` + `core` are required)
- Spec is source of truth; code follows
- One opinionated way per concern, no plugin systems
- No half-features in core
- Push concerns out of core into peer packages
- Examples are CI-gated
- ADRs for major decisions
- Cull regularly
- Every dep needs justification

## Conventions to maintain

- TypeScript: strict, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`.
- Code style: prose comments where helpful, no ceremony where not.
- Spec edits and code edits land together in the same PR.
- `bun:test` for unit tests.
- No PII in any code path.
- All money amounts are integers in the currency's minimal unit
  (USD 1.00 -> 100 when `SessionInfo.currencyDecimals = 2`).
- Math is currency-blind, RNG-injected, opaque-to-core.
- Money moves twice per round at most (open + close, or one settle).
- Autoclose is NEVER timer-driven inside RGS: always external trigger.
- Public packages have neutral examples: never name a specific
  provider's wire shape, brand, or product id in code or spec.
  ONE EXCEPTION: `packages/adapter-artube`, which is provider-specific by
  definition. It is `private: true` and on the changesets ignore list, so it
  is never published; it lives here for the workspace, the typecheck and the
  conformance run. Everything that DOES ship - core, contract, the specs, the
  docs site, the examples - stays wallet-neutral, and the adapter names its
  own wallet inside its own package and nowhere else.

## Out of scope for open-rgs

These belong to the operator's gamification layer, NOT the RGS:

- Tournaments, leaderboards
- Progressive jackpots, Daily Drops
- Cashback, promotional campaigns (beyond `PromoFreeRounds`  -
  granted free-rounds pool surfaced by the adapter)
- Loyalty
- Multi-currency sessions, master sessions

The RGS is a calculator that runs rounds, applies a max-win cap, and
asks the adapter to move money. That's it.

## How to resume

If a new Claude session opens this repo:

1. Read this file.
2. Read `specs/README.md` and `specs/00-overview.md`.
3. Read `specs/09-roadmap.md` for "what's next."
4. Read `specs/10-design-philosophy.md` for "how we work."

## Typecheck + tests

```bash
bun install
bun run typecheck
bun test
```
