# emacs-bluesky Agent Notes

This file captures project context that is not obvious from the code alone.
Prefer these sources and constraints when extending the client.

## Source Of Truth

- Post lexicon, including current text limits: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluesky-social/atproto/main/lexicons/app/bsky/feed/post.json
- Postgate lexicon: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluesky-social/atproto/main/lexicons/app/bsky/feed/postgate.json

Use official Bluesky docs or canonical lexicons for protocol behavior. SDK docs
and third-party references can be useful for examples, but should not override
the lexicons.

## Architecture Notes

- `bluesky-conn.el` should hold XRPC and repository-write helpers.
- `bluesky-ui.el` should render app-view records and embeds.
- `bluesky.el` should own timeline/thread buffers, navigation, selection, and
  keybindings.
- `bluesky-post.el` should own compose buffers, post/reply submission,
  character counting, rich-text conversion, and post/thread gate options.
- Do not put posting UI back into minibuffer prompts. Posts and replies should
  go through `bluesky-post-mode`.

## AT Protocol Model

- User data is stored as signed repository records. App views return convenient
  view objects, counts, and `viewer` state; repo writes still go through
  `com.atproto.repo.createRecord` and related repository APIs.
- DIDs and AT URIs are stable record identifiers. Handles can change; use AT
  URI plus CID strong refs when replying, quoting, liking, and reposting.
- Lexicons define schema and behavior. If behavior is unclear from docs, inspect
  the raw lexicon file in the `bluesky-social/atproto` repository.
- Atproto separates speech from reach. Moderation labels and app-view `viewer`
  flags should affect rendering and UI affordances, not be treated as core repo
  record data.

## Posts And Replies

- `app.bsky.feed.post` records require `text` and `createdAt`.
- The post lexicon currently limits post text to `maxGraphemes: 300` and
  `maxLength: 3000` bytes. The compose header should show both and block
  submission when over either limit.
- Replies require a `reply` object containing both `root` and `parent` strong
  refs. `parent` is the post being replied to; `root` is the original thread
  root, or the parent itself for a top-level reply.
- If `post.viewer.replyDisabled` is true, do not open a reply composer and do
  not submit a reply if a composer somehow already exists.
- Validate reply-disabled behavior against live app-view objects, but do not
  actually submit replies unless the user explicitly asks for a live write.

## Rich Text Facets

- Facets annotate text ranges using UTF-8 byte offsets, not Emacs character
  positions.
- Current `bluesky-post.el` conversion supports plain URLs and simple Markdown
  or Org links as link facets. It does not yet fully implement mention
  resolution or full Markdown/Org export.
- Mentions need handle-to-DID resolution via
  `com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle`; if resolution fails, leave the text
  un-faceted.
- When adding richer conversion, preserve the final text exactly as submitted
  and compute facet byte offsets from that final text.

## Gates And Interaction Options

- Thread gates control who can reply. Create an
  `app.bsky.feed.threadgate` record with the same rkey as the post.
- Threadgate allow rules include:
  - `app.bsky.feed.threadgate#mentionRule`
  - `app.bsky.feed.threadgate#followingRule`
  - `app.bsky.feed.threadgate#followerRule`
  - `app.bsky.feed.threadgate#listRule`
- A missing threadgate means anyone can reply. An empty `allow` vector means
  nobody can reply.
- Post gates control embedding. Create an `app.bsky.feed.postgate` record with
  the same rkey as the post. `app.bsky.feed.postgate#disableRule` disables
  embedding.

## Embeds And Rendering

- Feed app-view embed shapes differ from repo record embed shapes. Render view
  shapes such as `app.bsky.embed.record#view`,
  `app.bsky.embed.recordWithMedia#view`, `app.bsky.embed.video#view`, and
  image/external view records.
- Quote records should render inline inside the parent embed. Do not flatten
  quoted records into separate timeline items, or quotes will appear twice.
- `app.bsky.embed.record#view` can wrap a `:record` union. Unwrap it before
  deciding whether the inner record is a normal quoted post, blocked, not found,
  or detached.
- Blob URLs can be fetched through `com.atproto.sync.getBlob` with `did` and
  `cid`, but app views often already provide CDN thumbnail/fullsize URLs.

## Emacs UX Expectations

- `bluesky-mode` keybindings should be standard top-level `define-key` forms
