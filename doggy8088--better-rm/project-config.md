# Agents

This document describes the AI agents and automation used in the development of better-rm.

## Overview

This project uses GitHub Copilot and AI-assisted development to maintain code quality, implement features, and address issues efficiently.

## Development Agents

### Code Review Agent
- **Purpose**: Automated code review for pull requests
- **Scope**: Reviews all code changes for security, performance, and maintainability issues
- **Integration**: Runs automatically on PR commits
- **Feedback**: Provides actionable comments on the code

### Security Agent (CodeQL)
- **Purpose**: Static security analysis
- **Scope**: Scans for security vulnerabilities in code changes
- **Integration**: Runs before finalizing changes
- **Note**: Currently limited support for Bash scripts, but best practices are followed

### Testing Agent
- **Purpose**: Automated testing of functionality
- **Scope**: Validates file operations, hash calculations, timestamp generation, and edge cases
- **Coverage**: 
  - Regular files with various content types
  - Empty files and directories
  - Files with special characters
  - Rapid deletion scenarios
  - Symlinks
  - Force mode operations

## Future Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features

1. **Security First**: Always consider security implications
   - Use secure command patterns (`-print0`, `-0`, etc.)
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Protect against injection attacks

2. **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure backward compatibility with existing trash structure
   - New features should not break existing trashed files
   - Consider migration paths for format changes

3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all edge cases
   - Empty inputs
   - Special characters in filenames
   - Large directories
   - Rapid operations
   - Error conditions

4. **Document Changes**: Update all relevant documentation
   - CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes
   - README.md for feature descriptions
   - Code comments for complex logic
   - This AGENTS.md for development process changes

### Code Style Guidelines

1. **Comments**: Use bilingual comments (Chinese + English) for consistency
2. **Error Handling**: Always provide clear error messages in both languages
3. **Color Output**: Use colored output for better UX (red for errors, green for success, yellow for warnings)
4. **Shell Best Practices**:
   - Quote all variables
   - Use `local` for function variables
   - Handle edge cases (empty strings, special characters)
   - Use `2>/dev/null` to suppress expected errors

### Performance Considerations

1. **Hash Calculation**: 
   - Be mindful of large directory operations
   - Current implementation may be slow for directories with many files
   - Consider optimization for production use

2. **Timestamp Precision**: Nanosecond precision is sufficient for collision prevention

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Always provide fallbacks (e.g., md5sum → sha256sum → "nohash")

## Suggested Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement restore functionality (`rm --restore`)
- [ ] Add trash management commands (list, clean, empty)
- [ ] Automatic cleanup of old trashed files
- [ ] Configuration file support (~/.better-rm.conf)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Enhanced hash calculation for large directories
- [ ] Trash statistics and reporting
- [ ] Integration with file managers
- [ ] Support for network filesystems

### Low Priority
- [ ] GUI for trash management
- [ ] Scheduled trash cleanup
- [ ] Compression of old trashed files
- [ ] Cloud backup integration

## Testing New Features

When implementing new features, ensure comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Create test environment
mkdir -p /tmp/test-better-rm
cd /tmp/test-better-rm
TRASH_DIR=/tmp/test-trash

# Test scenarios
# 1. Regular files
echo "content" > file.txt
better-rm -v file.txt

# 2. Empty files/directories
touch empty.txt
mkdir emptydir
better-rm -v empty.txt
better-rm -rv emptydir

# 3. Special characters
touch "file with spaces.txt"
better-rm -v "file with spaces.txt"

# 4. Rapid deletions
for i in {1..10}; do echo "$i" > "file$i.txt"; done
better-rm -v file*.txt

# 5. Large directories
mkdir largedir
for i in {1..1000}; do echo "content $i" > "largedir/file$i.txt"; done
better-rm -rv largedir

# Clean up
rm -rf /tmp/test-better-rm /tmp/test-trash
```
