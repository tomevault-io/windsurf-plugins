# Feature Development Guidelines

When building a new feature or app module in the Cursor IDE project, follow these rules to ensure consistency, performance, and maintainability:

## 1. File Structure & Component Location
- Create each feature as a component under:  
  `/src/app/(featureName)/[featureName].tsx`

## 2. App Registration
- Register each new app or feature in the global app list at:  
  `/src/infrastructure/config/appRegistry.ts`

## 3. Global State Management
- Use **Jotai** atoms for managing global state.
- Place all atoms under:  
  `/src/application/atoms`

## 4. Local Storage Persistence
- For persistent data, use helper functions in:  
  `/src/infrastructure/utils/local-storage.ts`

## 5. Window-Based Layout
- All apps should render inside the reusable window layout:  
  `/src/components/shared/window.tsx`
