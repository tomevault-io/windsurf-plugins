# CLAUDE.md — Compañeros Marketing Site

*Last updated: January 2026*

---

## What We're Building

A marketing website for **Compañeros** (companeros.ai) — a platform that helps entrepreneurs, small business owners, and corporate leaders build products, apps, and internal tools using AI-powered guidance and proven frameworks.

This repo is the **marketing site only**. The full platform/app is a separate project.

---

## Why We're Building It

The marketing site is the front door to Compañeros. It needs to:

1. **Explain what Compañeros is** — Quickly and clearly
2. **Route visitors to the right path** — We serve three distinct audiences
3. **Build trust** — Through testimonials, credibility, and founder story
4. **Convert visitors** — Book sales, consulting bookings, email capture, platform waitlist
5. **Support both English and Spanish speakers** — Bilingual audience

---

## Who It's For

### Three Primary Audiences

| Audience | What They Want | Entry Point |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Entrepreneurs & Startups** | Turn an idea into a product | Book, bundles, 2-day intensive |
| **Small Business Owners** | Build tools for their business without developers | Book, bundles, Jumpstart |
| **Corporate Leaders** | Empower their teams to innovate without IT bottlenecks | Workshops, retainers |

Each audience has a dedicated page with tailored messaging.

## Critical UX Requirements

### Homepage

The homepage has a **"How can we help?"** selector with three options:
1. "I'm building something new" → /entrepreneurs
2. "I need better tools for my business" → /small-business
3. "I want to drive innovation in my organization" → /corporate

This is the primary navigation pattern. Make it prominent.

### Audience Pages

Each audience page follows the same structure:
1. Hero with tailored headline
2. Problem/solution narrative
3. Demo/walkthrough area (placeholder for now)
4. Testimonials
5. Pricing/offer cards
6. FAQ
7. CTA

### Corporate Page — Key Message

The corporate page headline is:

> **"Your best people already know what to build."**

This is the centerpiece message. Everything on that page supports this idea.

### Bilingual Support

- Default: English
- "Hablamos Español" callout should appear on homepage
- Full Spanish translation is future scope, but design should accommodate
