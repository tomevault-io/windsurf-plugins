# Cursor Rules for zigtgshka Project

## Core Development Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Write simple, readable code that does one thing well
- Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity
- Prefer straightforward solutions over clever ones
- Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract common functionality into reusable functions or modules
- Use constants for repeated values
- Create helper functions for repetitive operations
- Consider creating utility modules for shared code
- Avoid duplicating logic across different parts of the codebase

## Code Preservation Rules

### Debug Logs Protection
- **NEVER remove, comment out, or modify existing debug logs** that the user has added
- Preserve all `std.debug.print()` statements exactly as written
- When adding new functionality, you may add your own debug logs, but keep user's logs intact
- If code refactoring affects debug logs, ensure they remain functional and in their original locations

## Documentation Search Requirements

### Mandatory Documentation Search
- **ALWAYS use search tools** to find relevant documentation before making suggestions or code changes
- Search in these documentation locations:
  - `docs/zig-for-mcp/doc/split/` - Contains Zig standard library documentation (151 parts)
  - `libraries/telegram-bot-api/docs/` - Contains Telegram Bot API documentation
  - `libraries/telegram-bot-api/docs/getting-started/` - Getting started guides
  - `libraries/telegram-bot-api/docs/internals/` - Internal documentation
  - `libraries/telegram-bot-api/docs/examples/` - Example code and usage patterns

### Search Strategy
1. First search for the specific function, method, or concept you're working with
2. Look for examples and best practices in the documentation
3. Check for any specific patterns or conventions used in this project
4. Reference the documentation when explaining code suggestions

## Go Library Reference

### Original Implementation Reference
- **ALWAYS reference the original Go library** in `libraries/telegram-bot-api/` when implementing new features
- Use the Go library as the authoritative reference for:
  - API method implementations (`bot.go`)
  - Type definitions and structures (`types.go`)
  - Helper functions and utilities (`helpers.go`)
  - Configuration patterns (`configs.go`)
  - Parameter handling (`params.go`)
  - Testing patterns (`*_test.go` files)

### Implementation Strategy
1. First examine the Go implementation of the feature you're working on
2. Understand the Go patterns and translate them appropriately to Zig
3. Maintain API compatibility where possible while following Zig conventions
4. Reference Go test files to understand expected behavior and edge cases
5. Use Go documentation comments as a guide for Zig documentation

### Key Go Files to Reference
- `bot.go` - Main bot implementation and API methods
- `types.go` - All Telegram API types and structures
- `helpers.go` - Utility functions and convenience methods
- `configs.go` - Configuration structs for API methods
- `params.go` - Parameter handling patterns
- `passport.go` - Telegram Passport specific implementations
- `*_test.go` - Test files showing usage patterns and expected behavior

## Zig Language Specific Rules

### Memory Management
- Use the allocator pattern consistently
- Always pair `init()` with `deinit()` calls
- Free allocated memory using the same allocator that allocated it
- Handle `deinit()` in error cases appropriately

### Error Handling
- Use Zig's error union types properly
- Handle errors explicitly, don't ignore them
- Use appropriate error types from the `BotError` enum when applicable
- Prefer returning errors over panicking

### JSON Handling
- Use `std.json.parseFromSlice()` for parsing JSON responses
- Always call `deinit()` on parsed JSON objects
- Handle `ignore_unknown_fields = true` option when needed
- Make deep copies of strings and nested structures when needed

### HTTP Requests
- Follow the existing pattern in `makeRequest()` function
- Use proper header setting for API requests
- Handle request/response lifecycle properly with `defer req.deinit()`

## Project Structure Respect

### File Organization
- Keep related functionality in appropriate modules
- Follow the existing module structure:
  - `src/telegram.zig` - Main Telegram Bot API implementation
  - `src/utils.zig` - Utility functions for parsing and helpers
  - Respect the separation of concerns

### API Design
- Follow the existing patterns for Bot methods
- Keep the API simple and consistent
- Use the established error handling patterns
- Maintain compatibility with existing code

## Testing and Examples

### When Adding New Features
- Look for similar patterns in the `examples/` directory
- Follow existing conventions for parameter handling
- Test with the existing Bot structure and methods
- Ensure new code integrates well with existing error handling

## Code Review Checklist

Before suggesting any changes, ensure:
1. [ ] Documentation has been searched for relevant information
2. [ ] Original Go library has been referenced for implementation patterns
3. [ ] KISS principle is followed - solution is as simple as possible
