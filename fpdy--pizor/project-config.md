# Pi Multi-Node Orchestration Policy

This project may run multiple Pi instances inside one Zellij session
This file is the shared policy for every Pi instance in this repo

## Roles

There are three logical node roles:

- observer node: monitors lifecycle, drift, progress, cleanup, sidecar report events, and keeps orchestration loops out of the user/main thread
- master node: decomposes tasks, spawns workers, kills workers, manages global context
- worker node: executes exactly one bounded assignment and reports back

DO NOT use metaphor-specific names in commands, session names, scripts, skills, task IDs, or reports

Use neutral names only:

- node-observer
- node-master
- node-worker
- pizor
- worker-spawn
- worker-dispatch
- worker-kill

## Dynamic Worker Policy

All workers are ephemeral
The master MUST NOT maintain a fixed pool of idle workers

DO NOT create standing workers such as:

- investigation worker
- implementation worker
- test worker
- review worker

Spawn a worker only when there is a concrete bounded assignment

Prefer safe parallel batches over unnecessary sequential execution. Implementation, read-only investigation, read-only review, and verification assignments may run at the same time when their scopes do not conflict.

A concrete assignment must include:

- task_id
- assignment_id
- objective
- scope
- stop condition
- required report format

A worker SHOULD receive exactly one assignment
After a worker reports done, blocked, failed, cancelled, or needs_review, the master must capture the report and close the worker pane unless there is a clear reason to keep it temporarily

## Context Policy

DO NOT allow long linear context growth
DO NOT wait until context usage reaches 50%

Prefer `/tree` when:

- switching strategy
- abandoning a noisy branch
- comparing alternatives
- ingesting worker reports
- synthesizing multiple assignment results
- carrying forward only selected context
- recovering from failed attempts

Prefer `/compact` only when continuing the same chosen branch is clearly better than returning to a checkpoint.

## Master Context Policy

The master owns global context
The master MUST NOT paste all raw worker logs into one long context

The master SHOULD use `/tree` to keep separate branches for:

- planning
- dispatch batch
- individual worker report
- synthesis
- final decision

The master should summarize each worker report branch with custom focus instructions.

The master carries forward only:

- assignment_id
- worker_pane_id
- files inspected
- files modified
- commands run
- confirmed findings
- blockers
- recommendation
- context_to_carry_forward
- context_to_discard

The master discards:

- raw logs unless essential
- repeated reasoning
- abandoned attempts
- speculative discussion
- stale plans

## Worker Context Policy

A worker owns only one assignment

A worker must:

- load `/skill:node-worker`
- acknowledge task_id and assignment_id
- create or identify a local `/tree` checkpoint before substantial work
- avoid expanding scope
- avoid irreversible changes unless explicitly allowed
- report structured results
- stop and wait for cleanup after reporting

A worker MUST NOT assume it shares context with the master

Workers must explicitly report reusable facts.

## User Thread Handoff Policy

When the user asks to use the running observer/master, the user/main thread MUST NOT perform task orchestration itself.

Required behavior:

1. Read the active registry with `.pi/scripts/registry-list`.
2. Identify the current running observer and master panes, preferring the latest active panes from the current `/pizor-start` session.
3. Send the task request to the running master pane using `.pi/scripts/pane-send`, or use `.pi/scripts/task-handoff`.
4. Send an observer request to the running observer pane using `.pi/scripts/pane-send`, or use `.pi/scripts/task-handoff`.
5. The observer request MUST explicitly say that the user/main thread must not become the polling loop.
6. Worker routing MUST name the current `master_pane` and `observer_pane`; do not use hard-coded pane IDs such as `0` or `1` unless they are explicitly the current panes.
7. After both messages are sent successfully, the user/main thread MUST stop and remain idle unless the user asks a follow-up question.
8. Do not poll workers, polling loop, pane-dump repeatedly, or synthesize results in the user/main thread.

The user/main thread may only report:

- task_id
- master pane
- observer pane
- that handoff is complete and it is going idle

## Observer Policy

The observer monitors dynamic worker lifecycle
The observer does not assume fixed workers
The observer MUST NOT run `.pi/scripts/observer-loop`.
The observer MUST NOT run polling loops, sleep loops, pane-dump loops, or registry polling for lifecycle monitoring.
The observer MUST NOT use sleep-based monitoring as a fallback.
Lifecycle updates MUST arrive as node-to-node messages, primarily WORKER_REPORT_POINTER messages emitted by worker-report-submit.

The observer tracks:

- task_id
- assignment_id
- worker_pane_id
- status
- purpose
- blocker
- cleanup_required
- report_captured

The observer SHOULD warn the master when:

- a worker is idle
- a worker has completed but has not been killed
- a worker expands scope
