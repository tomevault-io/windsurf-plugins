## Core Data Models

### HIPAA Compliance Assessment
- ComplianceAssessment
  - assessmentId: unique identifier
  - organizationType: healthcare facility classification
  - complianceScores: mapped to 10 HIPAA domains
  - findings: linked violations and gaps
  - recommendations: prioritized remediation steps
  - hipaaReferences: specific regulation citations
Importance Score: 95/100

### Security Event Tracking
- SecurityEvent
  - eventId: unique identifier
  - eventType: healthcare-specific classification
  - phiExposure: boolean with impact assessment
  - hipaaViolation: potential regulation breaches
  - patientImpact: severity classification
  - mitigationSteps: required actions
Importance Score: 90/100

### Health Monitoring Metrics
- SystemHealth
  - metricId: unique identifier
  - serviceType: healthcare system classification
  - patientImpact: service criticality score
  - complianceStatus: HIPAA alignment status
  - dataProtection: PHI security measures
  - recoveryTime: service restoration targets
Importance Score: 85/100

### Protected Health Information
- PHIClassification
  - dataType: medical data category
  - sensitivity: exposure risk level
  - retentionPolicy: HIPAA requirements
  - encryptionLevel: protection requirements
  - accessControls: role-based permissions
  - auditTrail: access logging requirements
Importance Score: 90/100

## Relationships

- ComplianceAssessment -> SecurityEvent: 1:many
- SecurityEvent -> PHIClassification: many:many
- SystemHealth -> ComplianceAssessment: many:1
- PHIClassification -> SystemHealth: 1:many

All models implement strict HIPAA compliance requirements with emphasis on:
- Protected health information security
- Patient data privacy controls
- Healthcare facility classifications
- Regulatory compliance mapping
- Medical service continuity requirements
