# AGENTS.md — house rules

Read this before touching the code. It inherits the constraints and vocabulary
of the design corpus in `docs/`.

## Vocabulary (non-negotiable)

- **mote** = the substrate at rest (stripped kernel + `pilot`). **cell** = a
  live, sealed, tool-loaned mote. *Every cell is a sealed mote.* Never use the
  two interchangeably. Full glossary: `docs/NAMES_AND_CONVENTIONS.md`.
- Components: `assay` (host daemon, where the distro lives), `warden` (per-cell
  VMM), `pilot` (in-cell supervisor). 1 warden : 1 microVM : 1 cell.

## Constraints (from the build plan §1)

1. The guest never boots in the hot path — spawn is a CoW fork of a warm mote.
2. No in-kernel network stack; AF_INET is marshalled over vsock to a host proxy.
3. The filesystem has no authority to run code — exec is by content hash against
   a signed manifest.
4. Tool code is unwritable from the guest side (stage-2 sealing).
5. Authority only shrinks — the ratchet is host-enforced in `warden`.
6. Compatibility is a feature — every ABI break is a silent latency tax.

## Working rules

- **Never fake a hardware guarantee.** If a backend can't provide a property,
  return `Unsupported` (see `warden::vmm::kvm`). A stub that lies is worse than a
  stub that refuses.
- **Prefer measurement over assertion.** Performance claims become committed
  numbers, not comments.
- **Reduce guest attack surface and stay reversible** when choosing between
  implementations; keep the rationale close to the code it affects.
- Rust for code, Make for orchestration, shell for glue. No Python.
- `make ci` must stay green: `fmt-check build test`.

## Where things are

- Trust core (no I/O): `crates/celln-manifest`
- Store: `crates/celln-store`
- Cell spec parsing + validation: `crates/celln-spec`
- Grading, tiered resolution + CLI: `crates/celln-assay`
- Build plane (rebuild + reproduce): `crates/celln-forge`
- The `celln` CLI users actually run: `crates/celln-cli`
- Ratchet + VMM trait/backends: `crates/celln-warden` (`vmm/kvm.rs` real KVM,
  `vmm/boot.rs` stock-kernel boot)
- Exec gate + lanes + explain + demos: `crates/celln-pilot`
- Guest-side code: `guest/init/init.c` (freestanding, no libc); guest images built
  by `scripts/mkinitramfs.sh` and `scripts/mktoolfs.sh`
- Hardware checks: `celln verify`; measurements: `make bench-kvm` (local output under `target/celln-bench/`)

## Proving things

Claims about what a guest can or cannot do are proven by **guest code that
actually tries**, not by host-side assertion — see the hostile-guest test in
`vmm/kvm.rs` and the `NOUS:key=value` reporting channel in `guest/init/init.c`.
Hardware tests skip (not fail) when `/dev/kvm`, a readable kernel image, or the
initramfs toolchain is absent, so `make ci` stays green on any host.
