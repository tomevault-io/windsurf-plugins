# FocusRelay Agent Guide

## Before Changing Code

1. Work from a GitHub issue with one bounded outcome.
2. Declare the validation impact: `docs`, `package`, `server-wire`, `mutation`,
   `query`, `performance`, or `transport-reliability`.
3. Write one user-facing acceptance journey before implementation.
4. Keep work in progress to one product branch plus one process/docs branch.

Use `docs/development-workflow.md` for the validation and release procedure.
When available, run:

```bash
swift run focusrelay-dev validate --impact <impact> --base origin/master
```

Do not substitute a larger validation tier merely because it feels safer. Use
the smallest tier that covers the changed production behavior; ambiguous
changes use the safer tier.

## Swift And Tests

- Use Swift Testing (`Testing`, `@Test`, `#expect`, `#require`).
- Do not add `swift-testing` as a package dependency.
- Add or update tests when functionality changes.
- Disabled live tests must use Swift Testing traits so they are reported as
  skipped. Never return early and let an unexecuted live test appear to pass.
- Test the real boundary that users exercise. MCP schema or decoding changes
  require direct MCP argument/wire coverage, not only model round trips.
- Mutation work requires a reversible live write/verify/restore for each
  affected behavior before release UAT.

## Omni Automation Contract

- Production query paths use documented Omni Automation APIs only.
- If a property or collection is absent from the official OmniFocus
  documentation, do not use it in core query logic.
- Follow `docs/omni-automation-contract.md` and prefer:
  - `flattenedTasks` and `task.taskStatus`
  - `flattenedProjects` and `project.status`
- Task availability must respect the task, its parent tasks, and its project.
- Use the shared status helpers in `BridgeLibrary.js`; do not recreate status
  from `blocked`, defer dates, or convenience booleans.
- Implementation parity is not an independent oracle. For status semantics,
  compare with native OmniFocus behavior before benchmarking.

## Plugin Changes

Install the bridge only with:

```bash
./scripts/install-plugin.sh
```

After installation, fully restart OmniFocus because it caches plugin
JavaScript:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "OmniFocus" to quit' && sleep 2 && open -a "OmniFocus"
```

Restart once at the beginning of a live validation session, then run health,
semantic, and UAT checks against that same ready session.

## Performance And Reliability

- Change one variable per branch. Do not mix query optimization, transport,
  approval UX, caching, and benchmark tooling.
- Keep a performance change only when semantic gates pass and measurements show
  a defensible user-relevant win without reliability regression.
- Require an explicit benchmark profile. Never default to an hours-long run.
- Use `canary` for complete scenario coverage, `smoke` for a 10-minute targeted
  run, `release` once on the frozen release candidate, and `stress` only for a
  documented diagnostic question.
- Production-path releases keep the 1.5-hour realistic suite, but unchanged
  evidence is reused by production fingerprint. Documentation-only commits do
  not invalidate it.
- Raw benchmark artifacts belong under `.build/benchmarks`; commit only an
  intentionally selected summary.

## Release And Workspace Hygiene

- GitHub issues are the source of truth for deliverables and validation
  evidence. Keep `docs/roadmap-execution-plan.md` concise.
- Merge small vertical PRs, complete user-facing UAT, then freeze one release
  candidate before the long suite.
- Do not update multiple current-status documents with the same evidence.
- After merge, report merged branches/worktrees and remove them only with an
  explicit apply action.
- For Homebrew, update once, then set `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` for subsequent
  checks. Untap/retap only when stale tap state is proven.
- External commands must stream output or emit a heartbeat at least every 30
  seconds. Record subprocess time separately from approval and tool-wrapper
  time. Retry only diagnosed transient failures with a bounded attempt count.

## Current Runtime Facts

- Swift is selected from `.swift-version` through Swiftly.
- The MCP server detects `TimeZone.current.identifier` and sends it as
  `userTimeZone` in bridge requests.
- Projects and tags use the actor-based `CatalogCache` with a five-minute TTL;
  tasks are intentionally uncached.
- Plugin URL dispatch through the Bridge plugin is the only architecture.
  Direct JXA execution and OSAKit are not part of production, development,
  tests, or benchmarks. Semantic gates use Bridge health plus list/count and
  deterministic JavaScriptCore contracts.
