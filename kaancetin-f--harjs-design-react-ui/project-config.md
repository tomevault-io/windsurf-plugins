description: Repo test infrastructure (helper tests + compatibility smoke test)

# Testing Rules

The repo does not have a "component rendering" style test infrastructure; instead[cite: 6]:

- helper unit tests via `node:test` for pure logic functions[cite: 6]
- build/compat smoke test at package level[cite: 6]

## Framework / tooling

- Test framework: Node built-in `node:test`[cite: 6]
  - example:
    - `src/components/navigation/pagination/helpers.test.ts`[cite: 6]
    - `src/components/navigation/steps/helpers.test.ts`[cite: 6]
    - `src/components/layout/layout/helpers.test.ts`[cite: 6]

File naming:

- `helpers.test.ts` (in the same folder as helper files)[cite: 6]

Coverage/RTL/snapshot:

- No Snapshot / React Testing Library / Jest/Vitest/Playwright present[cite: 6].

## Test execution scripts

As test script in `package.json`[cite: 6]:

- `test:compat`[cite: 6]
  - `src/scripts/compatibility/verify.mjs`[cite: 6]
  - This script packs the library with `npm pack` and performs smoke tests via `npm run build` in different application templates[cite: 6].

Reference:

- `package.json` -> `test:compat`[cite: 6]
- `src/scripts/compatibility/verify.mjs`[cite: 6]

## Test rule for new components

If a new component contains "logic" rather than "UI state"[cite: 6]:

- separate logic helpers into `helpers.ts`[cite: 6]
- add `helpers.test.ts`[cite: 6]
- use `node:test` + `assert/strict` pattern[cite: 6]

UI behaviors like Overlay/focus[cite: 6]:

- Since the repo lacks renderer test infrastructure to test such behaviors,
  - focus on testing helper calculation functions (e.g., `position.ts`, `calculate*`)[cite: 6].

## What is triggered in CI? (repo introspection)

Since there is no script in the repo that runs unit tests,
the primary assurance is "typecheck + build" and `test:compat` smoke test[cite: 6].
