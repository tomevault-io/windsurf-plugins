# Cursor Rules for NPM Package Development

These rules ensure packages integrate cleanly into parent apps, remain lightweight, and avoid bundler or dependency conflicts.

---

## 1. Dependencies

- Do NOT bundle dependencies the parent app already provides.
- React, React DOM, and similar framework-level libraries MUST be `peerDependencies`.
- Also include these in `devDependencies` for local development.
- Keep dependencies minimal and avoid large editors/libraries unless required.

---

## 2. Build Output

- Always build TypeScript → JavaScript before publishing.
- Output must include:
  - `dist/index.js` (ESM)
  - `dist/index.d.ts` (types)
  - `dist/style.css` if styles exist
- Do NOT publish raw `/src` unless explicitly intended.
- Avoid combining multiple builds; prefer a clean ESM-only output unless CJS is needed.

---

## 3. Package Entrypoints

- Configure `package.json` correctly:
  - `"main"`, `"module"`, `"types"`
  - `"exports"` map for clean import paths
- Ensure consumers can import like:
  ```js
  import { Component } from "your-package";
  ```

---

## 4. Environment Compatibility

- Do NOT assume the parent app uses Vite, Webpack, Next, etc.
- No Node APIs in browser code: fs, path, process, etc.
- No browser-only globals in SSR environments: window, document (wrap in guards).
- Package must work immediately inside a vanilla Vite + React app.

---

## 5. CSS & Styling

- Never override global styling in the parent app.
- Namespace all CSS: `.cp-*`, `.df-*`, etc.
- If using Tailwind internally:
  - Compile Tailwind BEFORE publishing.
  - Do NOT require the parent app to modify their Tailwind config.
  - Do NOT inject global Tailwind resets into the parent app.

---

## 6. Tree Shaking & Side Effects

- Must use ES modules everywhere.
- Avoid side-effect imports.
- Add to package.json:
  ```json
  "sideEffects": false
  ```
  or list CSS explicitly:
  ```json
  "sideEffects": ["**/*.css"]
  ```

---

## 7. Asset Handling

- Always import assets (images, fonts, wasm, workers) so bundlers can resolve them.
- Never reference assets with hardcoded file-system paths.
- If shipping assets, expose them through the exports map.

---

## 8. Versioning

- Follow semantic versioning strictly:
  - Breaking changes → major.
  - Features → minor.
  - Fixes → patch.
- Never introduce breaking API changes in a patch release.
- Maintain a clear CHANGELOG.

---

## 9. Local Linking

- Package must work with npm link, pnpm link, or workspaces.
- Peer deps prevent duplicate React installs during linking.
- No absolute paths in build output.

---

## 10. Install Scripts

- Avoid expensive or blocking postinstall scripts.
- Never run builds, downloads, or external processes during install.
- Only acceptable postinstall use: warn about missing peer dependencies.
