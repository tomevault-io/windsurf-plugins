# Workflow Guardrails

- For tasks touching 3+ files, start in Plan Mode before writing code.
- For unfamiliar modules, read the relevant SKILL.md before editing.
- Use `@file` / `@folder` references to scope context precisely.
- After substantive edits, run `ruff check` and `pytest` before claiming done.
