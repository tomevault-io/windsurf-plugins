## Searching the codebase

Use **ripgrep (`rg`)**, not `grep`, for searching this repository.

`rg` respects `.gitignore` (so it skips `target/`, build artifacts, and the
large binaries under `scratchpad/`), is much faster on this tree, and has
saner defaults. Reach for it in scripts, ad-hoc searches, and CI.

- Search: `rg pattern` (recursive by default) instead of `grep -rn pattern .`
- Filter by type: `rg -t rust pattern` / `--glob '*.rs'`
- If a script must run where `rg` may be absent, install it or gate on
  `command -v rg` before falling back — do not default to `grep`.
