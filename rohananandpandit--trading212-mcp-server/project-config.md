# Repository instructions

## Branch names

Do not use a `codex/` prefix when creating branches in this repository.
Use a category prefix that describes the work, such as `feature/`, `fix/`,
`chore/`, `docs/`, or `refactor/`.

Examples:

- `feature/portfolio-alerts`
- `fix/credential-cache-isolation`
- `chore/update-dependencies`

## Trading 212 API schema

Treat `https://docs.trading212.com/_bundle/api.yaml` as the authority for the
current public API. `docs/api.json` is a checked-in snapshot, not proof that the
implementation is still current.

Before changing API endpoints, request or response models, authentication,
pagination, or release compatibility—and before claiming that the server is in
sync—use the repository skill at
`.agents/skills/trading212-api-sync/SKILL.md`. Run its live schema check and
resolve relevant drift in the snapshot, implementation, tests, and user-facing
documentation.

Do not invent request restrictions that the public schema does not define.
Keep outbound mutation validation safe, but make response parsing resilient to
additive upstream fields and audit every changed enum. Schema checks must not
use account credentials or call live trading endpoints.
