# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is a Claude Code and Codex plugin plus Agent Skills package. Plugin metadata lives in `.claude-plugin/` for Claude Code and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` for Codex. The three skills live under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`; keep that layout flat (one skill folder per name, `SKILL.md` directly inside) - it is what the skills.sh CLI (`npx skills add`) and OpenClaw discover. Codex UI metadata lives in `skills/*/agents/openai.yaml`. Deeper guidance is kept in `skills/*/references/`, and reusable article scaffolding is in `skills/creating-explainers/assets/article-template.html`. Human-facing installation and usage docs are in `README.md`, while `CLAUDE.md` captures maintainer guidance for Claude Code. Planning and design notes belong in `docs/`, and evaluation prompts are centralized in `evals/evals.json`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

There is no package manager, build step, or dependency install for this repo. Useful local commands are:

- `rg "term" skills docs README.md` - search skill and documentation content.
- `python3 -m http.server 8000` - serve a generated explainer directory that contains `index.html` for browser inspection.
- `python3 /home/analyticalmonk/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py .` - validate Codex plugin metadata.
- `git diff --check` - catch whitespace issues before committing.

Generated articles must remain standalone HTML with inline CSS and JavaScript.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use Markdown for skill and reference instructions. Keep `SKILL.md` files focused on trigger rules and workflow; put long, situational guidance in `references/` so it loads lazily. Use lowercase kebab-case for skill and reference names, for example `creating-explainers` and `voice-and-style.md`. Keep `agents/openai.yaml` short and aligned with the skill frontmatter. Avoid em dashes in repository prose and templates. Produced article code should stay vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with no npm, React, D3, Tailwind, or shared build tooling.

## Testing Guidelines

There is no automated test runner. Validate changes by running the relevant prompt from `evals/evals.json` against the edited skill and inspecting the generated article or report. For article output, check the sticky two-column layout, sidebar scroll tracking, responsive behavior at mobile widths, Canvas figures, and the fact-checking gate. Any factual explainer change should preserve source-backed claims only.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history uses concise Conventional Commit-style subjects, such as `feat: add creating-explainers hub skill` and `docs: clarify install instructions`. Follow that pattern with `feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, or similar prefixes.

Pull requests should describe the changed skill or document, explain why the change is needed, list any eval prompt used for validation, and include screenshots or generated article paths when visual output changes. Keep `README.md`, `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, skill metadata, and marketplace metadata in sync when skill names, descriptions, or install behavior change.
