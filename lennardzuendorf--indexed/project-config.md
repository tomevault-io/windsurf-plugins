# AGENTS.md — indexed Engineering Guide

**indexed** · Python 3.11+ single-package project (`uv`, one wheel `indexed-sh`) ·
local-first semantic search over files/Jira/Confluence/Outline, served by a Typer **CLI**
and a FastMCP
**server**. This is the operating contract for any agent in this repo. The design
source of truth is `.spec/`; earned lessons are in `.spec/lessons.md` — read both at
session start.

## Context

Four layers, top calls down only: **CLI/MCP** (`indexed.cli` / `indexed.mcp`) →
**Services + core facade** (`indexed.core`) → **Engine** (FAISS, embeddings,
persistence) → **Infra** (config, connectors, parsing, utils, protocols).

```
src/indexed/           the single package (one wheel: indexed-sh)
  core/                engine facade + services + indexes
  connectors/          files/jira/confluence/outline readers + converters
  config/              ConfigService (singleton) + TOML/.env resolution + config CLI
  parsing/             Docling / tree-sitter chunking
  protocols/           typed contracts (models.py) + protocols — the leaf
  utils/               logging · retry · batching
  cli/                 Typer app · composition.py (the single wiring site)
  mcp/                 FastMCP server
tests/                 unit/ · system/ · characterization/ · benchmarks/
.spec/                 design source of truth (root specs + features/<name>/)
```

Config priority (low→high): defaults → `~/.indexed/config.toml` →
`./.indexed/config.toml` → `INDEXED__*` env → CLI args. Secrets in `.env`, never TOML.
Collections persist under `~/.indexed/data/collections/<name>/`
(`manifest.json`/`documents.json`/`chunks.json`/`index.faiss`).

```bash
uv sync --all-groups
uv run indexed index create my-docs --source files --source-path ./docs
uv run indexed index search "query" --collection my-docs
uv run indexed-mcp run
```

## Rules

**MUST** — run the full Workflow cycle; read `.spec/` before coding and cite it; run
everything via `uv run` from the PROJECT ROOT; keep ty clean (0 diagnostics) and
ruff clean; hold coverage >85% and run the full suite before any push; commit
`uv.lock` with dependency changes; keep the four module edges (`core ↛ connectors`,
`connectors ↛ core`, and `config`/`utils`/`parsing`/`protocols` never import up); route
config through `ConfigService`; lazy-load heavy ML imports inside functions; bump
`updated:` on every spec you touch and COMPOUND lessons in the same cycle.

**NEVER** — use `pip`/`poetry` or activate a venv; proceed past a gate without
confirmation; skip tests/coverage/types before pushing; import heavy ML libs at module
top; hardcode config values; create a file when editing one works; exceed 50 chars in a
commit subject or add a body/footer; leave a spec drifting from the code; over-comment.

**Commit** (only when asked; one line, ≤50 chars, imperative):
`<type>(<scope>): <subject>` — feat/fix/refactor/perf/style/test/docs/build/ci/chore.

## Learnings

Earned defaults live in **`.spec/lessons.md`** — read at session start, apply without
being asked, and add a lesson after every correction. Load-bearing highlights: lazy ML
imports keep startup <1s; ty must be fully clean tree-wide (0 diagnostics, no baseline);
coverage is measured on installed packages (`--cov=src`); `ConfigService` is a singleton
(respect the priority chain); connectors are Protocol-based with `from_manifest`; core is
consumed only through the `core.v1.engine` facade, with `composition.py` the single wiring
site; FAISS Flat is correct for <100k docs; spec drift is the main failure mode — fix the
spec in the same cycle; a comment is one line of *why*, never an essay; Rich silently drops
a bracketed `[dotted.key]` from any `typer.Option(help=...)` string (parsed as a markup
tag, not printed) — write config keys unbracketed in help text. KISS wins.

Agent skills are **not vendored** — they install from `skills-lock.json` via `npx skills`
(`npx skills list` shows the set). The root `CLAUDE.md`/`WARP.md` are symlinks to this
file (multi-tool compatibility).
