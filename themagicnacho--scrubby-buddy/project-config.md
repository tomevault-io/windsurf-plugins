# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

**0w0 Scrubby Buddy** is a Tauri 2 desktop app that removes EXIF/metadata from JPEG images. It has two modes: **Scrub** (batch-process a folder) and **Inspect** (view metadata in a single image). The UI features a kawaii bear mascot that reacts to user actions.

## Commands

```bash
# Full app with hot reload (use this for development)
npm run tauri dev        # or: tauri dev

# Frontend only
npm run dev              # Vite dev server on port 1420
npm run check            # Type-check frontend (svelte-check)
npm run check:watch      # Type-check in watch mode
npm run test:unit        # Runs unit test
npm run format           # Formats the frontend. Must be ran before each review.

# Production
tauri build              # Runs `npm run build` then packages the app

# Rust only (from src-tauri/)
cargo check              # Check Rust for errors
cargo clippy             # Rust linter. Lint must pass prior to reviews.
```

There are no automated tests. `npm run check` / `svelte-check` is the primary validation tool for the frontend.

## Architecture

The app is split across a Svelte frontend and a Rust backend connected via Tauri's IPC bridge.

**Frontend (`src/`)** — SvelteKit in SPA mode (SSR disabled, static adapter with `fallback: "index.html"`). There is only one route (`src/routes/+page.svelte`) — no routing library. Manual view switching uses `$state()` + `{#if activeView === "scrub"}`.

**Backend (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`)** — All image processing logic lives here. Three Tauri commands handle: counting images, scrubbing metadata, and inspecting metadata. File I/O uses Tokio async.

**IPC Pattern** — Frontend calls Rust via `invoke()`, Rust exposes functions with `#[tauri::command]`:

```ts
// Frontend
const result = await invoke('scrub_images', { path: folderPath, saveDirectory });
```

```rust
// Backend (lib.rs)
#[tauri::command]
async fn scrub_images(path: &str, save_directory: &str) -> Result<String, ()> { ... }
```

New commands must be registered in the `.invoke_handler()` call inside `run()` in `lib.rs`.

## Key Conventions

### Svelte 5 Runes

All state uses Svelte 5 runes — not Svelte stores or reactive declarations:

```ts
let folderPath = $state('');
let bearState: BearState = $state('waiting');
```

Component props use `$props()`:

```ts
let { state, message }: Props = $props();
```

### CSS

- No CSS framework — pure scoped CSS inside `<style>` blocks
- Kawaii color palette defined as CSS variables in `+page.svelte` (e.g. `--kawaii-hot-pink: #ff1493`, `--kawaii-soft-pink: #ffb6c1`, `--kawaii-text-dark: #4a0e4e`) — use these for any new UI
- Font is Nunito, loaded via `@font-face` from `/static/fonts/`
- Animations use named `@keyframes`; existing ones include `float`, `bounce`, `tilt`, `sparkle`, `blink`

### Rust

- Async throughout — use `tokio::fs` for file I/O, not `std::fs`
- JPEG segment filtering uses `img-parts`; EXIF parsing uses `kamadak-exif`
- Cleaned images are saved with random filenames (using `rand`)

### Tauri Plugins

- `tauri-plugin-dialog` — native file/folder picker dialogs
- `tauri-plugin-opener` — open a folder in the system file explorer
- Both are initialized in `lib.rs` via `.plugin(...)` on the builder


# Clean Code Guidelines

All code written must adhere to the clean code guidelines.

## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

## Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

## Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Testing
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Version Control
- Write clear commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names
