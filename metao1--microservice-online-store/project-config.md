# Java Spring Boot + JPA Copilot Instructions

## General Java Development Practices
- Always follow SOLID, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles.
- Adhere to OWASP security best practices.
- Break tasks into the smallest units and solve step by step.

## Spring Boot Project Structure
- Use Java Spring Boot 3 (Maven, Java 17, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf, Lombok, PostgreSQL driver).
- RestControllers handle all request/response logic.
- ServiceImpl classes handle all database operation logic using Repository methods.
- RestControllers must not autowire Repositories directly unless absolutely necessary.
- ServiceImpl classes must not query the database directly (use Repositories).
- Use DTOs for data transfer between RestControllers and ServiceImpl classes.
- Entity classes are only for carrying data from database queries.

## Entity Class Conventions
- Annotate with @Entity and @Data (Lombok).
- Use @Id and @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY) for IDs.
- Use FetchType.LAZY for relationships.
- Annotate properties with validation annotations (e.g., @Size, @NotEmpty, @Email).

## DTO Conventions
- Use Java records for DTOs unless otherwise specified.
- Include a compact canonical constructor for parameter validation (not null, blank, etc.).

## Repository Class Conventions
- Annotate with @Repository.
- Use interfaces extending JpaRepository<Entity, ID>.
- Use JPQL for @Query methods.
- Use @EntityGraph(attributePaths={...}) to avoid N+1 problems in relationship queries.
- Use DTOs for multi-join queries with @Query.

## Service Class Conventions
- Service classes are interfaces; implementations are ServiceImpl classes annotated with @Service.
- Autowire dependencies in ServiceImpl without constructors unless specified.
- ServiceImpl methods return DTOs (not entities) unless necessary.
- Use repository methods with .orElseThrow for existence checks.
- Use @Transactional or transactionTemplate for multiple sequential DB operations.

## RestController Conventions
- Annotate with @RestController and specify class-level @RequestMapping.
- Use best-practice HTTP method annotations (e.g., @PostMapping, @GetMapping).
- Autowire dependencies in class methods without constructors unless specified.
- Methods return ResponseEntity<ApiResponse>.
- Implement all logic in try-catch blocks; handle errors with GlobalExceptionHandler.

## ApiResponse & GlobalExceptionHandler
- ApiResponse and GlobalExceptionHandler classes must be present and follow best practices for structure and error handling.

## Protocol Buffer Definitions
- Define clear, concise messages and services in .proto files.
- Use proper data types and naming conventions.
- Set the go_package option correctly for Go code generation.

## Database Interaction Best Practices
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Handle database errors gracefully.
- Consider an ORM for complex queries and data modeling.
- Close database connections when not needed.
- Use connection pooling for performance.

#### AssertJ Fluent API
Always use AssertJ for assertions:
```java
assertThat(productAggregate)
    .isNotNull()
    .hasFieldOrPropertyWithValue("title", expectedTitle);

assertThat(categories)
    .isNotEmpty()
    .hasSize(1)
    .extracting(ProductCategory::getName)
    .containsExactly(expectedCategory);
```
