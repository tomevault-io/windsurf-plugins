# AI Operator Guide

This file is for AI assistants, coding agents, and automation tools.

## Goal

Help the user make historical Codex sessions visible again after switching `model_provider`.

For normal Windows users, prefer the GUI app when it is available. Use the CLI when:

- the user explicitly wants commands
- the task is automated
- the GUI EXE is unavailable

The tool works by updating both:

- rollout metadata under `~/.codex/sessions` and `~/.codex/archived_sessions`
- SQLite thread metadata in `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite`

Do not solve this by manually editing rollout files only unless the user explicitly asks for manual intervention.

## Preferred Flow

Use this order by default:

1. If the GUI is available and the user is not asking for terminal commands, open `CodexProviderSync.exe`
2. Refresh and inspect the current provider plus rollout/SQLite distribution
3. Decide whether the user needs sync, switch-like behavior, or restore
4. Execute the action
5. Report whether the result is complete or partially skipped due to locked files

CLI fallback flow:

1. Run `codex-provider status`
2. Read `Current provider` and compare rollout/SQLite distribution
3. Decide whether the user needs `sync`, `switch`, or `restore`
4. Run the command
5. Report whether the result is complete or partially skipped due to locked files

## Command Selection

Use `codex-provider sync` when:

- the user already switched auth/provider using another tool
- the current `config.toml` root `model_provider` is already correct
- the user says things like:
  - "make my old sessions visible again"
  - "resync my Codex history"
  - "I already switched provider"

Use `codex-provider switch <provider-id>` when:

- the user wants to change the root `model_provider`
- the user wants one command to both switch provider and resync history

Use `codex-provider restore <backup-dir>` when:

- the user wants to roll back a previous sync
- the user synced to the wrong provider

Use `codex-provider status` only when:

- the user asks for inspection only
- you need a safe first step before deciding what to do

## GUI Selection

Use the GUI app when:

- the user wants a double-click tool
- the user does not want to install Node/npm
- the user wants to visually inspect providers and backups

GUI mapping:

- `Refresh` = inspect current status
- `Execute` without config checkbox = `sync --provider <selected>`
- `Execute` with config checkbox = switch-like behavior
- `Restore Backup` = restore a previous backup
- backup retention defaults to 5 and can be customized in the GUI
- `Clean Old Backups` = prune managed backups down to the selected retention count

## Important Behavior

- `sync` uses the current root `model_provider` from `~/.codex/config.toml`
- if root `model_provider` is missing, `sync` falls back to `openai`
- `switch` changes root `model_provider`, then runs a sync
- built-in `openai` is always valid
- custom providers must already exist in `config.toml`
- the tool does not log the user in and does not manage `auth.json`
- sync and switch create a backup first, then automatically prune older managed backups
- backup pruning only touches backups created by this tool under `backups_state/provider-sync`

## Error Handling

If the output says `state_5.sqlite is currently in use`:

- tell the user to close Codex, Codex App, and app-server
- then rerun the same command

If sync reports `Skipped locked rollout files`:

- treat the sync as mostly successful
- explain that the active session still holds one or more rollout files open
- tell the user to rerun `codex-provider sync` after that session ends if they want a full rewrite

If `switch <provider-id>` fails because the provider is missing:

- tell the user to define it in `config.toml` or switch via their existing provider tool first
- then run `codex-provider sync`

## Safe Defaults

- default Codex home: `~/.codex`
- prefer `status` before destructive-looking operations, even though this tool only edits metadata
- by default the tool keeps the most recent 5 managed backups
- use GUI retention settings or CLI `--keep <n>` when the user wants a different retention count
- do not edit `state_5.sqlite` or rollout files manually if the tool can do it
- GUI settings live in `%AppData%\codex-provider-sync\settings.json`

## Recommended Commands

```bash
codex-provider status
codex-provider sync
codex-provider sync --keep 5
codex-provider sync --provider openai
codex-provider switch apigather
codex-provider prune-backups --keep 5
codex-provider restore C:\Users\you\.codex\backups_state\provider-sync\20260319T042708906Z
```

With an explicit Codex home:

```bash
codex-provider status --codex-home C:\Users\you\.codex
codex-provider sync --codex-home C:\Users\you\.codex
codex-provider switch openai --codex-home C:\Users\you\.codex
```

## One-Shot Prompt Template

Use this prompt in another AI tool if the user wants one-step handling:

```text
I use codex-provider-sync. Please help me fix Codex session visibility under my current provider.

Steps:
1. Run `codex-provider status`.
2. If my current provider is already correct, run `codex-provider sync`.
3. If I explicitly tell you to switch provider, run `codex-provider switch <provider-id>` instead.
