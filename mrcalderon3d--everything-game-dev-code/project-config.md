description: Prevent Unity, Unreal, and Godot guidance from contaminating each other.

Engine isolation is mandatory.

- Use `rules/common/` first.
- Then use exactly one engine layer for implementation: `rules/unity/`, `rules/unreal/`, or `rules/godot/`.
- Only compare engines in research contexts. Do not mix their implementation advice in production tasks.
