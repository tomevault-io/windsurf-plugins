description: Route work through commands, agents, and skills before improvising.
---


Preferred routing order:
1. Resolve to a shared command in `commands/` when possible.
2. Use `agents/` to determine role ownership.
3. Use `skills/` to execute the workflow reliably.
4. Use `hooks/` and `scripts/hooks/` for automation and summaries.

Always keep docs, QA, telemetry, and release implications explicit when they are affected.
