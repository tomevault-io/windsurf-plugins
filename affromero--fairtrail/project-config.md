# Fairtrail API Reference

> For agents, scripts, and CLI tools interacting with a local Fairtrail instance.

Base URL: `http://localhost:3003` (or whatever `HOST_PORT` is set to in `.env`)

All endpoints return JSON: `{ "data": {...} }` on success, `{ "error": "message" }` on failure.

In self-hosted mode, all endpoints except `/api/cron/scrape` are auth-free.

## Endpoints

### Parse a flight query

Converts natural language into structured flight data using your configured LLM.

```
POST /api/parse
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "NYC to Paris around June 15 ± 3 days"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "routes": [
      {
        "origin": "JFK",
        "originName": "New York JFK",
        "destination": "CDG",
        "destinationName": "Paris Charles de Gaulle"
      }
    ],
    "dateFrom": "2026-06-12",
    "dateTo": "2026-06-18",
    "flexibility": 3,
    "cabinClass": "economy",
    "tripType": "round_trip",
    "currency": "USD",
    "maxPrice": null,
    "maxStops": null,
    "preferredAirlines": [],
    "timePreference": "any",
    "message": "Searching JFK → CDG around June 15 ± 3 days",
    "needsClarification": false
  }
}
```

If `needsClarification` is `true`, the response includes a `message` asking the user to clarify. You can continue the conversation by passing `conversationHistory`:

```json
{
  "query": "the second one",
  "conversationHistory": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "NYC to somewhere warm" },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "Did you mean Miami, Cancun, or San Juan?" }
  ]
}
```

---

### Create a tracked query

Creates a flight price tracker that will be scraped on each cron run.

```
POST /api/queries
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "rawInput": "NYC to Paris around June 15 ± 3 days",
  "dateFrom": "2026-06-12",
  "dateTo": "2026-06-18",
  "flexibility": 3,
  "cabinClass": "economy",
  "tripType": "round_trip",
  "currency": "USD",
  "routes": [
    {
      "origin": "JFK",
      "originName": "New York JFK",
      "destination": "CDG",
      "destinationName": "Paris Charles de Gaulle",
      "selectedFlights": []
    }
  ]
}
```

**Optional fields:** `maxPrice` (number), `maxStops` (number), `preferredAirlines` (string[]), `timePreference` (string).

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "queries": [
      {
        "id": "clxyz...",
        "origin": "JFK",
        "originName": "New York JFK",
        "destination": "CDG",
        "destinationName": "Paris Charles de Gaulle",
        "deleteToken": "uuid-for-deletion"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Save the `id` to check prices later. Save the `deleteToken` if you want to delete the query.

---

### Get price data

Returns all price snapshots for a tracked query. This is the data that powers the chart.

```
GET /api/queries/{id}/prices
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "query": {
      "id": "clxyz...",
      "origin": "JFK",
      "destination": "CDG",
      "dateFrom": "2026-06-12",
      "dateTo": "2026-06-18",
      "cabinClass": "economy",
      "active": true
    },
    "snapshots": [
      {
        "travelDate": "2026-06-14",
        "price": 487,
        "currency": "USD",
        "airline": "Delta",
        "stops": 0,
        "duration": "7h 30m",
        "bookingUrl": "https://...",
        "scrapedAt": "2026-03-08T12:00:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "snapshotCount": 42,
    "lastChecked": "2026-03-08T12:00:00Z",
    "lastStatus": "success"
  }
}
```

---

### Trigger a scrape

Runs the scraper across all active queries immediately. Requires `CRON_SECRET`.

```
GET /api/cron/scrape
Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "queriesProcessed": 5,
    "successful": 4,
    "partial": 1,
    "failed": 0,
    "totalSnapshots": 28,
    "totalCost": 0.003
  }
}
```

The `CRON_SECRET` is auto-generated on first run and printed in Docker logs. You can also set it explicitly in `.env`.

---

### Health check

```
GET /api/health
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "status": "ok",
    "database": "connected",
    "redis": "connected"
  }
}
```

`redis` may be `"disabled"` if Redis is not configured (app works fine without it).

---

### Delete a query

```
DELETE /api/queries/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "deleteToken": "uuid-from-creation"
}
```

---

### Admin endpoints

These require an admin session cookie (set via `/admin` login). Useful for programmatic management but not typically needed by agents.

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/admin/queries` | GET | List all tracked queries |
| `/api/admin/queries/{id}` | PATCH | Update query (pause/resume) |
| `/api/admin/queries/{id}` | DELETE | Delete query (admin auth) |
| `/api/admin/config` | GET | Get extraction config |
| `/api/admin/config` | PATCH | Update LLM provider/model |
| `/api/admin/providers` | GET | List available LLM providers |

---

## Typical agent workflow

```
1. POST /api/parse        → parse "NYC to Paris in June"
2. POST /api/queries       → create tracker from parsed result
3. GET  /api/cron/scrape   → trigger immediate scrape (optional)
4. GET  /api/queries/{id}/prices → read price data
5. (wait hours/days)
6. GET  /api/queries/{id}/prices → check for price changes
