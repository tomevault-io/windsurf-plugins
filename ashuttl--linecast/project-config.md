## Commit messages and release notes

Andrew writes these himself, or edits them before they ship. When committing on his behalf:

- Subject line: `Area: what changed`, stated plainly. "Radar: prune cached frames older than a day" — not wordplay, not a line that winks at itself. E.B. White is the model: direct and spare. The poetry is in what goes unsaid.
- Leave commits unpushed unless asked, so messages can still be reworded with `git commit --amend`.
- When a change is user-visible, add a bullet to the Unreleased section of CHANGELOG.md in the same plain style. Andrew edits the notes at release time; the bullet is a draft, so keep it factual. One or two sentences on what the user gets — not how it was done, not the timings, not the file names. The mechanism goes in the commit body. "Maps: Fixed a bug that could have caused rendering the globe to fail until the user interacted with it." Plain and short beats vivid: "Maps: Better style consistency between street maps in flat mode and globe mode" — not a line about what the globe "used to" do, not a metaphor, not a flourish.

## Releases

Andrew runs `./release.sh [major|minor|patch]` himself — it opens his editor. It takes the Unreleased notes, gives them a final pass, bumps the version, moves them under a dated heading, commits, tags (the notes become the annotated tag message), pushes, and creates the GitHub Release. CI publishes to PyPI on the tag. That is the whole release: linecast is in homebrew/core, which BrewTestBot autobumps from PyPI, so there is no tap to push. `brew bump-formula-pr --version=X.Y.Z linecast` only if the bot is slow.

## Markdown

Don't hard-wrap prose in the markdown docs. One paragraph is one line; let the editor and GitHub soft-wrap it. Hard breaks make Andrew's manual edits reflow badly and make diffs noisier than the change.
