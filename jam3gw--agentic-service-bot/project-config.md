      ## Cursor Rules Management

      All rules in the `.cursor/rules` directory should be automatically added to the Cursor context.
      
      ### Guidelines for Rule Management:
      
      1. All Cursor rules should be stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory
      2. Rules should follow the naming convention: `descriptive-name.mdc`
      3. Each rule should have a clear description and purpose
      4. Rules should be properly formatted with the `<rule>` tag
      5. Consider adding `alwaysApply: true` to critical rules
      6. **Always ensure codebase compliance** with new or updated rules before moving on to other tasks (see `rule-compliance-workflow.mdc`)
      
      ### When creating new rules:
      
      1. Place the rule file in `.cursor/rules/`
      2. Follow the established rule format
      3. Test the rule to ensure it works as expected
      4. Document the rule's purpose and behavior
      5. **Verify codebase compliance** with the new rule following the workflow in `rule-compliance-workflow.mdc`
      
      This ensures consistent application of all project standards across the codebase.

examples:
  - input: |
      # New rule file created
      .cursor/rules/new-rule.mdc
    output: "Rule 'new-rule' added to Cursor context"
