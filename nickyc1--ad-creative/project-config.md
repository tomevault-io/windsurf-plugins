description: Generate, iterate, and scale paid ad creative — hooks, headlines, descriptions, primary text, static image briefs, video scripts. Use when asked to "write ad copy", "generate ad variations", "RSA headlines", "ad creative for [campaign]", "bulk ad copy", "ad iterations", or "creative testing". Pairs with paid-ads-context for ICP and voice, with apple-grade-design for visual production, and with paid-channel-recap to know which creatives won.

# Ad Creative

Generate paid ad creative at the scale paid ads actually need — 10-20 headlines per RSA, 5-10 hooks per video concept, 3-5 static image briefs per ad set. Most agents produce 2-3 generic options. This skill produces enough variation to actually run a test.

## Before starting

**Read `paid-ads-context.md` first** if it exists. The skill needs:

- ICP (section 1) — who this is talking to
- Brand voice + hard nos (section 5) — what NOT to say
- Recent winning creative (if you've run a `paid-channel-recap`, the section 4 creative attribution is the input)

If no context file exists, ask 5-7 focused questions and offer to write a partial one back.

## What the skill outputs

| Format | Volume | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Google RSA headlines | 15 (the max Google accepts) | Each ≤30 chars including spaces |
| Google RSA descriptions | 4 (the max) | Each ≤90 chars |
| Meta primary text | 5-10 | First 3 lines matter most (Meta truncates) |
| Meta headlines | 5-10 | ≤40 chars |
| Meta descriptions | 5-10 | ≤30 chars |
| Video hook scripts | 5-10 first lines | The first 3 seconds determine watch rate |
| Static ad briefs | 3-5 concepts | One paragraph per concept, generates the Nano Banana prompt |
| UGC scripts | 1-3 full 30-60s scripts | Bracket-formatted for the creator to follow |

## The hook is the variable that matters most

Same product, same offer, same creator — different opening line — 2-3x CAC swing. The skill prioritizes hook generation over body copy.

Hook patterns that work (test 3-4 per campaign):

| Pattern | Example shape | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Problem statement | "Stop {bad thing customers do}" | Their pain is named and obvious |
| Contrarian belief | "Everyone says {X}. They're wrong." | You have a sharp POV |
| Specific result | "How [named person] hit [specific number] in [timeframe]" | You have a real customer to point to |
| Curiosity gap | "I tried [X] for 30 days. Here's what happened." | Your category is novel |
| Direct offer | "Get [product] for [price] — today only" | Price is a real edge |
| Question | "What do [ICP] do when [bad situation]?" | You want to filter for ICP self-selection |
| Pattern interrupt | "STOP scrolling. This is for [ICP] only." | High-volume cold audiences |

The skill generates 5-10 hooks per campaign, spread across these patterns. Then you test, the winners earn more budget.

## The five-line brief format

For every creative the skill produces, it builds against this brief:

```
Goal:        [What this ad does in one verb]
Audience:    [The named ICP, not "everyone"]
Anchor copy: [The single line you will NOT change in testing]
Mood:        [Three adjectives]
Constraints: [Hard rules — real numbers, real names, no inventions]
```

This is the same brief format as the `apple-grade-design` skill — so when you go from copy to visuals, the brief travels.

## Hard nos the skill enforces

Pulled from `paid-ads-context.md` section 5, plus universal AI-tell guardrails:

- No em dashes for dramatic effect
- No "It's not X, it's Y" contradictory takes
- No "The best part?" / "Here's the thing..." / "The truth is..."
- No "No fluff. No filler." staccato phrasing
- No "In the ever-evolving world of..."
- No corporate buzzwords (unlock, empower, transform, leverage, synergy, ecosystem)
- No fake testimonials, no invented customer quotes
- No fake scarcity unless the scarcity is real
- No outcome claims without a real source

If your brand has additional hard nos in section 5, the skill enforces those too.

## Workflow

### 1. Spec gathering

The skill asks (or reads from context):

- The campaign / offer
- The ICP (from `paid-ads-context.md` section 1)
- The platform(s) — formats vary
- Any winning patterns from previous tests
- Length constraints
- Hard nos

### 2. Generate

Produces volume per the table above. Each variation is built against the five-line brief.

### 3. Self-audit

Before returning the output, the skill checks every line against:

- Character count limits (RSA = 30/90, Meta varies)
- Hard nos list
- Brand voice rules (if `voice-profile.md` exists, also runs the voice audit)
- Specificity check — does the line have a real number / name / claim, or is it generic?

Lines that fail any check are rewritten or flagged.

### 4. Output

Markdown table with: variation #, copy, format, char count, pattern type (hook / body / CTA), expected use case.

If asked, can also output as a CSV ready for bulk upload to Google Ads Editor or Meta Bulk Import.

## Static ad briefs (when needed)

For static image ads, the skill produces a brief Nano Banana 2 MCP can consume:

```
Aspect ratio: 1:1 (Meta feed) | 9:16 (story/reel) | 16:9 (YouTube)
Subject:      [What's in the image — describe specifically]
Setting:      [Background / context]
Composition:  [Where the subject is in frame]
Style:        [Photographic / illustration / motion graphic]
