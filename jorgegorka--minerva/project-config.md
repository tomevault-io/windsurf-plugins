This file provides guidance to AGENTS when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MINERVA is a knowledge management Rails 8.0+ application that serves as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, allowing AI systems to access and interact with stored documents and knowledge bases. The application exposes documents, chat history, and vector embeddings through the MCP interface while providing a web UI for document management.

**Key Technologies:**
- Ruby 3.3.6
- Rails ~> 8.0.2  
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for vector search
- MCP gem for Model Context Protocol integration
- Solid Queue/Cache/Cable (database-backed, using PostgreSQL)
- Marksmith for rich markdown editing
- Commonmarker for markdown rendering
- Active Storage for file attachments
- Kamal for deployment
- Minitest for testing (not RSpec)

## Essential Development Commands

### Setup & Build
```bash
bundle install                    # Install dependencies
bin/setup                        # Initial project setup (if available)
bin/rails db:prepare             # Prepare all databases (main, cache, queue, cable)
```

### Development Server
```bash
bin/dev                          # Start development server (via bin/rails server)
bin/rails server                # Alternative server start
```

### Testing
```bash
bin/rails test                   # Run unit/integration tests
bin/rails test:system            # Run system tests with headless Chrome
bin/rails db:test:prepare test test:system  # Full test suite (as in CI)
```

### Code Quality & Security
```bash
bin/rubocop                      # Ruby style linting
bin/rubocop -f github            # GitHub Actions format
bin/brakeman --no-pager          # Security vulnerability scan
bin/importmap audit              # JavaScript dependency security scan
```

### Deployment (Kamal)
```bash
bin/kamal deploy                 # Full deployment
bin/kamal app logs -f            # Tail application logs
bin/kamal shell                  # Interactive shell in container
bin/kamal console                # Rails console in production
bin/kamal dbc                    # Database console in production
```

## Architecture

### Knowledge Management Features

The application provides specialized tools for document processing and content extraction:

**Markdown Processing**
- `marksmith` gem provides rich form helpers for markdown editing
- `commonmarker` renders markdown content with sanitization
- Views use `marksmithed` helper for safe HTML rendering

**Content Extraction** (Optional dependencies)
- `metainspector` - Extract metadata from web pages
- `ruby-readability` - Extract readable content from HTML

**File Storage**
- Active Storage integration for document attachments
- Persistent volume mounting in production (`/rails/storage`)

### MCP Integration
The application's core purpose is to serve as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. The integration works as follows:

1. **McpController** (`app/controllers/mcp_controller.rb`) handles POST requests to `/mcp/index`
2. **MCP::Server** instantiated with configuration:
   - `name`: "rails_mcp"
   - `version`: "1.0.0" 
   - `resources`: Provided by `Resources::Finder.call`
   - `server_context`: User-specific data
3. **Resources::Finder** (`app/middleware/resources/finder.rb`) converts Documents into MCP resources
4. **Request Processing**: `server.handle_json(request.body.read)` processes MCP protocol messages
5. **Response**: JSON responses conform to MCP specification

To extend MCP functionality:
- Add tools, prompts, or resources to the `MCP::Server` initialization
- Modify `Resources::Finder` to include additional data sources
- The `server_context` can include user-specific data for personalization

### Database Architecture

The application uses **PostgreSQL** as its primary database with the `pgvector` extension enabled for vector similarity search. The schema includes:

**Core Application Tables** (`db/schema.rb`)
- `documents` - User-created knowledge documents (title, content)
- `chats` - Chat conversations with model_id tracking
- `messages` - Individual chat messages with role, content, token counts
- `tool_calls` - Tool invocations with arguments (JSONB)
- `knowledge_documents` - Documents with vector embeddings for similarity search
- Active Storage tables for file attachments

**Solid Gems Infrastructure** (PostgreSQL-backed)
- **Queue Database** (`db/queue_schema.rb`) - Solid Queue job storage
- **Cache Database** (`db/cache_schema.rb`) - Solid Cache key-value storage
- **Cable Database** (`db/cable_schema.rb`) - Solid Cable message storage

**Vector Search Capabilities**
- `pgvector` extension enables semantic search over document content
- `knowledge_documents` table includes `vector(1536)` embedding column
- Support for similarity queries and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

This architecture eliminates the need for Redis while maintaining Rails' caching and background job capabilities, with PostgreSQL handling all data storage including vector embeddings.

## Testing

The project uses **Minitest** (not RSpec) as the testing framework with the following configuration:

- **Parallel Testing**: Tests run in parallel using `workers: :number_of_processors`
