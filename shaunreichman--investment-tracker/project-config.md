# Docker Compose Best Practices

This guide provides best practices for creating maintainable, scalable, and modern Docker Compose files.

## 1. File Structure and Organization

### 1.1. Remove `version` Tag
The top-level `version` key is obsolete. Start your file directly with the `services` block.

```yaml
# Good: No "version" tag
services:
  # ...
```

### 1.2. Co-locate Compose Files
Store `compose.yml` and related files with the application source code in version control.

### 1.3. Single-Purpose Services
Each service should have a single responsibility (e.g., `api`, `db`, `cache`).

### 1.4. Logical Configuration Grouping
Order service configurations logically for readability:
1.  `image`, `build`
2.  `command`, `entrypoint`
3.  `environment`
4.  `volumes`, `networks`
5.  `deploy` (resources, restart policies)
6.  `healthcheck`
7.  `user`

### 1.5. Alphabetical Sorting
For large files, sort services, environment variables, ports, and volumes alphabetically.

### 1.6. Use Comments
Document non-obvious configurations with comments (`#`).

## 2. Development Workflow

### 2.1. Use `watch` for Live Reloading
Use the `develop.watch` section for automatic rebuilding and restarting of services on code changes.

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build: .
    develop:
      watch:
        - path: ./src
          action: rebuild # or 'sync'
```

## 3. Configuration Management

### 3.1. Use Environment Variables and `.env` Files
Avoid hardcoding values. Use environment variables with defaults defined in a root `.env` file.

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
```

### 3.2. Use Multiple Compose Files for Environments
Split configurations into:
1.  `compose.yml` (base)
2.  `compose.override.yml` (development, loaded automatically)
3.  `compose.prod.yml` (production)

Run with:
```bash
# Development
docker compose up

# Production
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## 4. Data and Networking

### 4.1. Use Named Volumes for Persistence
Use named volumes for production data. They are safer and managed by Docker.

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db_data: {}
```

### 4.2. Define Custom Networks
Create custom networks to isolate services for better security and organization.

```yaml
services:
  api:
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
  db:
    networks:
      - backend

networks:
  frontend:
  backend:
```

## 5. Container Health and Performance

### 5.1. Pin Image Versions
Avoid `:latest`. Pin images to specific versions (e.g., `postgres:15.4`) for predictable builds.

### 5.2. Set Resource Limits
In production, define CPU and memory limits.

```yaml
services:
  api:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "1.0"
          memory: 512M
```

### 5.3. Implement Healthchecks
Use `healthcheck` to ensure your application is ready.

```yaml
services:
  web:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

### 5.4. Define a Restart Policy
In production, set a restart policy like `always` or `on-failure`.

```yaml
services:
  api:
    restart: always
```
