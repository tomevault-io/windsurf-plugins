# Agentic Coding Guidelines

> Language- and framework-agnostic template for agent-driven projects.  
> Read this file first. Then follow the documentation map below before writing any code.

---

## ⚠️ Before you start

1. **Read the docs first.** Do not assume conventions; this project is documented so agents do not have to guess.
2. **Ask when boundaries are unclear.** If a requirement, layer boundary, business rule, or technology choice is ambiguous, ask the user before proceeding.
3. **Check logs and docs before inventing workarounds.** When something does not behave as expected, inspect logs, tests, and the relevant `docs/` file. Do not add fallback logic to bypass a problem you have not understood.

## Documentation map

### Understand the project

- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) — top-level index and domain map.
- [`docs/project/README.md`](docs/project/README.md) — project overview, goals, and tech-stack placeholders.
- [`docs/project/architecture.md`](docs/project/architecture.md) — system architecture, module boundaries, and data flow.

### Write frontend code

- [`docs/frontend/README.md`](docs/frontend/README.md) — Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) entry point.
- [`docs/frontend/fsd-overview.md`](docs/frontend/fsd-overview.md) — what FSD is and why it is used here.
- [`docs/frontend/layers.md`](docs/frontend/layers.md) — responsibilities of `app`, `pages`, `widgets`, `features`, `entities`, `shared`.
- [`docs/frontend/slices.md`](docs/frontend/slices.md) — how to split code into slices.
- [`docs/frontend/segments.md`](docs/frontend/segments.md) — `ui`, `model`, `lib`, `api`, `config` segments.
- [`docs/frontend/public-api.md`](docs/frontend/public-api.md) — public API and re-export rules.
- [`docs/frontend/import-rules.md`](docs/frontend/import-rules.md) — cross-layer and cross-slice import rules.
- [`docs/frontend/ui-patterns.md`](docs/frontend/ui-patterns.md) — semantic styling, no hardcoded copy, no redundant copy.

### Write backend code

- [`docs/backend/README.md`](docs/backend/README.md) — Domain-Driven Design (DDD) entry point.
- [`docs/backend/domain.md`](docs/backend/domain.md) — entities, value objects, aggregates, domain services, domain events.
- [`docs/backend/application.md`](docs/backend/application.md) — use cases, application services, transactions, DTOs.
- [`docs/backend/infrastructure.md`](docs/backend/infrastructure.md) — persistence, external services, messaging, configuration.
- [`docs/backend/interfaces.md`](docs/backend/interfaces.md) — HTTP/CLI/event adapters, controllers, input validation.
- [`docs/backend/api-conventions.md`](docs/backend/api-conventions.md) — response format, error codes, versioning.
- [`docs/backend/database.md`](docs/backend/database.md) — database, migrations, ID strategy.
- [`docs/backend/logging.md`](docs/backend/logging.md) — logging, tracing, and masking.

### Operations and quality

- [`docs/operations/README.md`](docs/operations/README.md) — local development, CI/CD, deployment.
- [`docs/quality/README.md`](docs/quality/README.md) — testing strategy and code-review expectations.
- [`docs/decisions/README.md`](docs/decisions/README.md) — architecture decision records (ADRs).

## Language and quality rules

### English only for code and comments

- All source code, comments, commit messages, and internal identifiers must be written in English.
- User-facing copy must also be in English unless the user explicitly asks for another language.

### Forbidden patterns

- **No hardcoded strings.** All user-facing text must be defined in a single place (i18n keys, constants, configuration) and referenced by identifier.
- **No redundant UI copy.** Do not repeat information that is already conveyed by a title, icon, selected state, or surrounding context.
- **No duplicated implementations.** If a piece of logic already exists, reuse it or extract it to the correct layer/slice. Do not copy-paste with minor variations.
- **No fallback/clever bypass logic.** Do not mask a root cause with a default value, a silent catch, or a conditional shortcut. Face the actual problem and fix it, or ask the user.
- **No assumptions about hidden requirements.** If a feature is not documented and the intent is unclear, ask.

### When something is unclear

1. Search the current `docs/` for the topic.
2. Read the relevant layer/slice README.
3. Inspect recent logs, tests, or existing code.
4. If still unclear, ask the user with a concise, specific question.

## Frontend: Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)

- A page is an orchestration layer. It composes widgets and features and reads routing data. It must not contain business logic or reusable UI.
- A widget is a self-contained block of UI that belongs to a page or a feature.
- A feature owns a complete user scenario (e.g., "create order"). It contains UI, model, API, and logic that are specific to that scenario.
- An entity owns domain data and rules (e.g., `User`, `Order`). It has no UI and no HTTP client logic.
- `shared` contains framework-agnostic utilities, UI primitives, and configuration that can be used by any layer.
- Imports go only downward: `app` → `pages` → `widgets` → `features` → `entities` → `shared`.
