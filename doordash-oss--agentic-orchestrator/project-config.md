## License header (required on every new source file)

Every new source file (`*.go`, `*.sh`, `*.py`) must begin with the Apache 2.0
notice below. For shell/Python files keep any shebang on line 1 and place the
block immediately after it. For Go files place the block above the `package`
clause; if the file has a package doc comment, separate the copyright block
from the doc comment with one blank line so the doc comment still attaches to
`package`.

## Verification tiers

Run the fast suite before every handoff. Add the extended gates that match the
area you touched, and always record the tier names in the PR description.

| Tier | Command | Current wall time | When to run |
|------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Fast suite | `make test-fast` | 23s, target <=30s | Run before every handoff; this is the everyday all-package short-mode check. |
| E2E smoke shell | `bash test/e2e/smoke.sh` | 48.53s | Run when touching launch behavior, embedded skills, or release packaging. |
| Isolated integration | `go test ./test/integration/... -count=1` | 323.06s | Run when touching lifecycle, state-machine, runs layout, or protocol-violation behavior. |
| E2E Go (TUI / teatest) | `go test ./test/e2e/... -count=1 -race` | 41.51s | Run when touching TUI, Bubble Tea model behavior, or session lifecycle. |
| TUI observability | `go test -tags tui_observe ./internal/tui -run 'Observed|Emits' -count=1` | 15.14s | Run when touching TUI observer wiring, emitted observability events, or feature-span propagation. |
| Race regression | `go test ./... -count=1 -race` | 158.82s | Run before merging high-risk changes or concurrency-sensitive work. |
| Eval | `AGENTIC_EVAL=1 go test ./test/eval/... -count=1` | gated; not measured | Run only when validating live skill/guideline discovery against real LLM CLIs. |

Static analysis and build checks still apply:

```bash
go vet ./...
go build ./...
```

The default tiers do not require build tags. The tagged **TUI observability**
gate is the explicit opt-in check for slower observer-backed TUI integration
coverage. The fast suite uses the existing `testing.Short` guards and
intentionally omits the race detector. The race-enabled all-package sweep is the
extended **Race regression** gate, not the everyday unit command. The baseline
timing report lives at `docs/testing-baseline.md`.

TUI package tests in `internal/tui` are part of the fast suite and must stay at
the model layer: drive `AppModel.Init`, `Update`, `View`, subcomponent reducers,
keyboard handlers, and event translators directly. Full Bubble Tea program
drivers, `teatest`, and terminal-lifecycle smoke flows belong in the extended
`test/e2e` gate with `testing.Short` guards.

## Test isolation and parallelism

Tests are disqualified from `t.Parallel()` when they touch package-level
mutable globals, including timeouts and golden update flags; mutate the process
environment or working directory; depend on global config paths or shared
on-disk fixtures; or own long-running subprocess or session state. In short:
package-level mutable globals, process environment or working directory,
global config paths or shared on-disk fixtures, and long-running subprocess or
session state.

Tests are good parallel candidates when they exercise pure functions,
read-only fixtures, independent t.TempDir() per test, or isolated table cases that copy
their case value before calling `t.Parallel()`. Prefer `t.Setenv` over
`os.Setenv`, `t.TempDir` over ad-hoc temp dirs, and `t.Cleanup` that waits on
observable conditions such as done channels, wait groups, manager shutdown, or
bounded process-exit signals instead of fixed `time.Sleep` drains. For session
timeouts and other mutable behavior, use per-test option overrides rather than
changing package-level defaults.

## PR verification note

PR descriptions should include a short `Verification` note naming each tier run
from the table above. Name any intentionally skipped relevant tier with a
one-sentence reason, for example: `Skipped Race regression: docs-only change`.

## Regenerating golden templates

Prompt templates have byte-exact `.golden` snapshots in
`internal/agent/prompts/testdata/`. After intentionally editing a `.tmpl`,
regenerate and review the diff:

```bash
go test ./internal/agent/prompts/... -update
```

Commit the updated `.golden` files alongside the template change.

## Isolated run (second instance)

`agentico` has no single-instance lock. A second instance launched against the
