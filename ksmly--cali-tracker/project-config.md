# Calisthenics Progress Tracker

A mobile-first PWA for tracking calisthenics skill progression. Helps freestyle trainers develop consistency and balance naturally — through visibility, not prescription.

**Full product spec:** `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`

---

## Stack

- **React + Vite** — UI framework
- **TypeScript** — strict mode enabled
- **Tailwind CSS** — styling (no separate CSS files)
- **Recharts** — charts and data visualization
- **localStorage** — storage v1, accessed only through `src/services/db.ts` (never directly from components)
- **Vite PWA plugin** — service worker, offline support, installability
- **GitHub Pages** — hosting via `gh-pages` branch

---

## Project Structure

```

  components/       # Reusable UI components
  pages/            # Top-level route pages (Dashboard, LogSession, SkillDetail, etc.)
  services/
    db.ts           # ALL storage read/write goes through here — never use localStorage directly
    suggestions.ts  # "What to train today" logic
    streaks.ts      # Streak calculation logic
  data/
    skills.ts       # Built-in skill definitions and progression ladders
    exercises.ts    # Built-in exercise library

## Core Data Types

See `src/types/index.ts` for the full definitions. Key types:

- `Skill` — a movement with a progression ladder
- `SkillStage` — one step on a skill's ladder
- `Exercise` — a drill (reps-based or hold-based)
- `Session` — a logged workout with date, entries, notes
- `ExerciseEntry` — sets × reps or sets × seconds within a session
- `ProgressionEvent` — a skill level-up milestone
- `UserSettings` — theme, streak config, etc.

---

## Key Conventions

- **Never access localStorage directly.** Always use `src/services/db.ts`. This keeps the storage layer swappable.
- **TypeScript strict mode.** No `any`. If you're unsure of a type, define it in `src/types/index.ts`.
- **One component, one job.** Keep components focused. Logic goes in hooks or services, not JSX.
- **Mobile-first.** All layouts start from mobile. Use Tailwind's `md:` prefix for desktop adjustments.
- **Feature branches.** Never commit directly to `main` or `dev`. Branch name format: `feature/<short-description>`.
- **Commits are checkpoints.** Commit before asking Claude to make significant changes. Use present tense: `add workout logger`, not `added workout logger`.

---

## Branch Strategy

```
main        ← production only, deployed to GitHub Pages
dev         ← integration branch, merge features here first
feature/*   ← one branch per feature, short-lived
```

---

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Deploying

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy   # deploys dist/ to gh-pages branch
```

---
