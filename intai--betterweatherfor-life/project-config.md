A website that helps outdoor enthusiasts quickly find the best places to go by ranking locations based on weather, tide, and sea conditions tailored to specific activities like SUP, kayaking, snorkeling, and cycling.

## Tech Stack

### Web

- `ESLint` for code linting and formatting.
- `Next.js`, `React`, `shadcn/ui`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Zustand` for UI development.
- `Ramda` for functional programming.
- `RxJS` for interactive functional programming.
- `i18next` for localisation.
- `date-fns` and `date-fns-tz` for date time manipulation.
- `Jest`, `React Testing Library` and `RxJS Marbles` for unit testing and coverage.

### DevOps

- `Docker compose` for containerisation.

### QA

- `Playwright` for browser manipulation.

## Local Development

- `make dev` to start development environment on port 3000.
- `make dev-bg` to start development environment in background.
- `make dev-stop` to stop development environment.
- `make prod` to start production environment.
- `make prod-stop` to stop production environment.

### Testing

- `npm run lint` to lint all files.
  - `npm run lint -- "path/to/file.js*"` to lint a specific file.
- `npm test -- --silent` to run all unit tests.
  - `npm test -- --runTestsByPath "path/to/file.spec.js*" --testNamePattern="matching string" --silent` to run specific unit tests in a spec file.
- `npm run test:e2e` to run all Playwright tests.
  - `npm run test:e2e -- --grep "matching string"` to run specific Playwright tests.
- `pytest langraph/tests/ --cov --cov-config=langraph/pyproject.toml --cov-report=term-missing` to run all LangGraph unit tests with coverage.
  - `pytest "langraph/tests/test_file.py" -k "matching_string"` to run specific LangGraph unit tests in a test file.

## Convention

- Our own file names are in hyphenated lower case.
- Implement in JavaScript instead of TypeScript.
- Name test files with `*.spec.js*`.
- Write JSDoc for exported functions in utils, store actions/selectors, and db queries.
