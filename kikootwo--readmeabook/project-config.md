# CLAUDE.md - Project Standards & Workflow

**Critical:** This document defines AI-optimized documentation standards and development workflow. **NEVER PERFORM COMMITS ON THE REPOSITORY.**

**ALWAYS DO:** When you feel work is complete, use the docker compose build readmebook to confirm you have no errors. If the build succeeds, then you can tell me it is ready to be tested.

**NEVER implement without approval.** When asked to assess, investigate, or fix a problem:
1. **Research & analyze** — Read code, trace the issue, identify root cause.
2. **Present a solution plan** — Explain the root cause, list the specific files and changes needed, and describe the approach clearly.
3. **Wait for explicit approval** — Do NOT write any code until the user confirms the plan.
4. Only after approval: implement, build, and report results.

This applies to bug fixes, feature requests, and any code changes. Investigation and analysis are always fine — writing code is not until approved.

## 1. Token-Efficient Documentation System

### Why Token Efficiency Matters

**Problem:** Documentation consumes significant token budget, leaving limited context for implementation.

**Solution:** Documentation optimized for AI consumption, not human reading. Average 68-72% token reduction while preserving all technical details.

### Documentation Structure

```
documentation/
├── TABLEOFCONTENTS.md          # Navigation index (read THIS FIRST)
├── README.md                    # Project overview

│   ├── database.md             # Schema, Prisma, migrations
│   └── services/

## 2. Using TABLEOFCONTENTS.md (MANDATORY)

### **RULE: Always Start Here**

**Before reading ANY documentation:**
1. **Read `documentation/TABLEOFCONTENTS.md` FIRST**
2. Identify relevant sections for your task
3. Read ONLY the specific files you need
4. **Never read all files sequentially** (wastes tokens)

### Example Workflow

**Bad (Token wasteful):**
```
Task: Fix Plex authentication
❌ Read README.md → backend/* → integrations/* → ...
```

**Good (Token efficient):**
```
Task: Fix Plex authentication
✅ Read TABLEOFCONTENTS.md → Identify: backend/services/auth.md, integrations/plex.md
✅ Read only those 2 files
✅ Begin implementation
```

### TABLEOFCONTENTS.md Format

Maps questions/features to specific documentation files:
- "How does authentication work?" → backend/services/auth.md
- "How do downloads work?" → phase3/qbittorrent.md, backend/services/jobs.md
- Organized by: Authentication, Configuration, Database, Integrations, Automation, etc.

## 3. Token-Efficient Documentation Format

### Mandatory Format Standards

**All documentation MUST follow this token-optimized format:**

#### Structure
```markdown
# [Title]

**Status:** [✅ Implemented / ⏳ In Progress / ❌ Not Started] [Brief description]

## Overview
[1-2 sentence summary]

## Key Details
- Compact bullet lists (not prose)
- API endpoints with request/response
- Data models with field names/types
- Configuration keys
- Critical implementation notes

## API/Interfaces
[Tables or compact code blocks]

## Critical Issues (if any)
[Only important items]

## Related: [links to other docs]
```

#### Forbidden Content (Removed for Token Efficiency)
- ❌ Verbose prose explanations
- ❌ "Why?" sections (keep brief rationale only)
- ❌ Large ASCII diagrams (minimal only)
- ❌ Excessive examples (max 1-2)
- ❌ "Future Enhancements" sections
- ❌ "Testing Strategy" (unless critical)
- ❌ "Performance Considerations" (unless critical)
- ❌ Empty sections
- ❌ Decorative formatting

#### Required Content (Preserve Completely)
- ✅ API endpoint definitions
- ✅ Data model field names and types
- ✅ Configuration keys and values
- ✅ Status values and enums
- ✅ File paths and code locations
- ✅ Critical implementation details
- ✅ "Fixed Issues" (troubleshooting context)
- ✅ Essential code examples (1-2 max)

### Format Examples

**Before (Token wasteful - 180 lines):**
```markdown
# User Authentication Service

## Current State

**Status:** Implemented ✅

This service handles all authentication and authorization logic for the
ReadMeABook application, including Plex OAuth integration, JWT session
management, and role-based access control.

## Design Architecture

### Why Plex OAuth?
