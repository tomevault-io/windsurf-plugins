# Model Configurations
These represent rules and conventions that MUST be abided when creating 
data transfer object (DTO) models of the API package.

- Model configurations should be closely aligned with both schema and database definitions
- Always propose and ask for confirmation when introducing new model types

## File Structure
```
packages/
     ├── api/
          ├── src/
               ├── models/   
                    ├── common.ts     # Shared DTO types
                    └── {feature}.model.ts  # Feature-specific models
```

## Naming Convention Rules
Assuming the example of a `blog` API or feature, then the following convention must be satisfied:
- Create model file as `blog.model.ts`
- Suffix all DTOs with `Dto`
- Prefix create/update DTOs with `Create` or `Update`
- Enums should be UPPERCASE and prefixed with feature name
- Types derived from enums should be `keyof typeof` the enum

## Implementation Rules
The following components are crucial in model files:
- Enums:
    - Define using TypeScript enum
    - Use UPPERCASE values
    - Export both enum and type
    - Follow naming pattern: `FEATURE_PURPOSE`
- Base DTOs:
    - Extend from common DTOs when possible
    - Keep fields minimal and focused
    - Use precise types
    - Document with JSDoc comments
- Operation DTOs:
    - Create separate types for different operations
    - Follow consistent naming patterns
    - Combine base DTOs as needed
- Common Types:
    - Reuse common DTOs from `common.ts`
    - Keep shared types minimal
    - Document type purposes
- Code sample and template to follow/modify/extend:
```typescript
import { TimestampsDto, StringIdDto } from "./common";

// 1. Enum Definitions
export enum BLOG_POST_STATUS { 
    DRAFT = "DRAFT", 
    PUBLISHED = "PUBLISHED", 
    ARCHIVED = "ARCHIVED" 
};
export type BlogPostStatus = keyof typeof BLOG_POST_STATUS;

/**
 * Data transfer objects for blog post operations
 */
export type CreateBlogPostDto = {
    title: string;
    content: string;
    status: BlogPostStatus;
    authorId: string;
    tags?: string[];
}

export type BlogPostIdDto = StringIdDto

export type BlogPostDto = BlogPostIdDto & CreateBlogPostDto & TimestampsDto

/**
 * Data transfer objects for blog comment operations
 */
export type CreateBlogCommentDto = {
    postId: string;
    content: string;
    authorId: string;
}

export type BlogCommentIdDto = StringIdDto
```

## Common DTO Rules
- Base DTOs in `common.ts`:
    - Keep minimal and widely reusable
    - Use TypeScript primitive types
    - Document with JSDoc when needed
    - Follow consistent naming
- Standard common DTOs:
    - `StringIdDto` for UUID/string IDs
    - `TimestampsDto` for created/updated dates
    - `PaginationDto` for list operations
    - `SortingDto` for order operations
