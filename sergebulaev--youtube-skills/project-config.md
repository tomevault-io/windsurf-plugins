# Project conventions - youtube-skills

This file is for any Codex agent working on this repository. Read it before
making changes. Conventions here are mandatory unless the user asks otherwise.

## Versioning

- Single source of truth: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Plugin manifests must always match on
  package name and version; marketplace entries must point to the same package;
  author, license, homepage, and the public skill-bundle description must stay
  aligned.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` aligned when changing shared project rules.
  Codex-specific workflow details belong here; Claude-specific details belong in
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- Codex marketplace install uses `.codex-marketplace/youtube-skills/`. Do not
  edit that generated package by hand. Update the root files first, then run
  `python3 scripts/sync_codex_marketplace.py`.
- **Default: bump the PATCH segment (3rd level, `0.0.X`).** This is the automatic
  behavior for every shippable commit, regardless of how large the diff feels.
  Skill renames, lib API breaks, new features: still PATCH by default.
- Only bump MINOR or MAJOR when **the user explicitly asks** for a higher rank
  ("this is minor", "make it 2.0", "bump major"). Do not promote on your own
  initiative even if semver textbook says so.
- After bumping, two steps are required:
  1. Tag the commit: `git tag -a v<X.Y.Z> -m "..."` + `git push origin v<X.Y.Z>`
  2. **Publish a GitHub Release** for the tag: `gh release create v<X.Y.Z> --title "v<X.Y.Z>" --notes "<changelog>" --latest`
  A tag alone does NOT update the README release badge. The shields.io badge
  reads from the Releases API, not from raw tags. Skipping step 2 leaves it stale.

## Commits

- Primary author **must** be Sergey: every `git commit` needs
  `--author="Sergey Bulaev <s@bulaev.org>"`. Verify with
  `git log -1 --format='%an <%ae>'` before pushing.
- Co-author trailers are fine when appropriate.
- Verify locally before push: build never breaks, no broken refs in `SKILL.md`,
  library smoke import passes.

## Skill bundle invariants

- **Exactly 9 skills.** Adding requires merging or splitting elsewhere to stay at
  8. The number is announced in plugin manifests and the README.
- **Frontmatter `description:` target <= 400 chars** (some bundle-heavy skills
  land slightly higher when their scope is genuinely broad; keep under 510).
  Always include a "Not for X (use Y)" disambiguation sentinel when a skill
  overlaps with a sibling.
- **No em dashes anywhere in `description:` fields.** Em dashes in body prose are
  allowed for table separators and list dividers only. No em dashes inside the
  literal fill-in lines of any title or hook skeleton.
- **Skill names are public surface.** Renaming a skill is a major version bump and
  requires updating: plugin manifests, marketplace entries, root `SKILL.md`
  bundle list, README skill table, and every `yt-<name>` cross-reference in
  sibling SKILL.md files.

## Voice rules + reference layout

- Canonical voice rules live at root `references/voice-rules.md`. Skill-local
  "Hard rules" sections must only contain skill-specific overrides and start
  with: `Global voice rules: see root SKILL.md Voice rules.`
- Other root-level references: `references/hook-formulas.md` (10 YouTube title and
  hook formulas), `references/algorithm-heuristics.md`, and
  `references/thumbnail-principles.md`.
- Skill-local references live in `skills/<skill>/references/`. Cite from the skill
  with bare `references/X.md`. Cite root from skills with `../../references/X.md`.

## Layer separation

- **Write layer (Publora):** `lib/publora_client.py`. `create_post`,
  `get_upload_url` + `upload_to_s3`, `update_post`, `publish_video` (the full
  draft -> upload -> schedule flow), `set_thumbnail`, and `list_connections` /
  `youtube_connections`. Skills call `lib.publish(kind, draft_text, target_url,
  ...)`. Real endpoints: `POST /create-post`, `POST /get-upload-url`,
  `PUT /update-post/:postGroupId`, with `platforms: ["youtube-<id>"]` (array of
  STRING ids), header `x-publora-key`.
- **YouTube is video-only.** Every published post REQUIRES a single video the
  user supplies. `kind="video"` / `kind="short"` auto-upload only when a
  `video_path` is passed; otherwise they fall back to a manual upload brief.
- **Community posts have no Publora endpoint**, so `kind="community"` always
  routes to a manual copy-paste block.
- **The thumbnail needs a postGroupId**, so it is *attached* via `update-post`,
  never on `create-post`. The image must be a Publora-tracked asset from
  Publora's dedicated YouTube thumbnail endpoint (verified channel). That image
  upload is **out of band** for this bundle (Publora dashboard or the dedicated
  endpoint; the generic `get-upload-url` flow is not accepted for thumbnails), so
  `set_thumbnail()` / `publish_video(thumbnail=...)` only do the attach step
  given an existing `{mediaId, url}`. Do not claim a one-call thumbnail upload.
- **No read layer ships by default.** The planner and title skills ask the user
  to paste recent titles and stats. Any future YouTube data actor stays gated
  behind `APIFY_TOKEN` with a paste fallback.
