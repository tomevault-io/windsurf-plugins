# View Transitions + OOB — Stable Pattern

When a page mixes **htmx-boost** (AJAX nav), **View Transitions**, and **OOB/SSE** (live updates), three mistakes cause problems:

## Rule 0: hx-disinherit on sse-connect (CRITICAL — whole tree wiped without it)

```html
<!-- BAD: inherits hx-target="#main" → fragment swaps into #main, wipes entire list -->
<div hx-ext="sse" sse-connect="/events">

<!-- GOOD -->
<div hx-ext="sse" sse-connect="/events" hx-disinherit="hx-target hx-swap">
```

## Rule 1: No `transition:true` on the container

```html
<!-- BAD: OOB swaps trigger view transitions → whole area flickers -->
<div id="main" hx-swap="innerHTML transition:true">

<!-- GOOD: Put transition on nav links only -->
<div id="main" hx-swap="innerHTML">
<a href="/page" hx-swap="innerHTML transition:true">Link</a>
```

## Rule 2: No `view-transition-name` on parents of OOB targets

```css
/* BAD: #main contains OOB targets (meta-lines, etc.) */
#main { view-transition-name: page-content; }

/* GOOD: Only nav-only content */
#main > .story-detail { view-transition-name: page-content; }
```

## Rule 3: OOB fragments must include nav link attributes

When OOB-swapping an element that has nav links, those links need `hx-swap="innerHTML transition:true"` so they behave the same after the swap.

## Checklist

- [ ] `sse-connect` has `hx-disinherit="hx-target hx-swap"`
- [ ] Container has `hx-swap="innerHTML"` without `transition:true`
- [ ] Every nav link has `hx-swap="innerHTML transition:true"`
- [ ] `view-transition-name` only on elements that change on full nav, never on parents of OOB targets
- [ ] OOB fragments with nav links include `hx-swap="innerHTML transition:true"` on those links
