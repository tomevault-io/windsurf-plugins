## Helixent

Helixent is a small library for building **ReAct-style** agent loops on the **Bun** stack.

This project is organized into **four layers**, plus a separate `community` area for third-party integrations, and CLI/TUI and skills support.

## Architecture (4 layers)

### 1) `foundation`

Core primitives that everything else builds on:

- **Models**: the `Model` abstraction and provider-facing contracts.
- **Messages**: a single transcript type that flows end-to-end through the system.
- **Tools**: tool definitions and execution plumbing (the "actions" an agent can invoke).

Files:
- `src/foundation/models/*`
- `src/foundation/messages/*`
- `src/foundation/tools/*`

Design intent:

- Keep these types stable and reusable.
- Prefer adding new backends by extending `ModelProvider`.
- Keep `Message` as the single source of truth for the conversation transcript.

### 2) `agent`

A reusable **ReAct-style agent loop**:

- Maintains state over a conversation transcript.
- Chooses between "think / act / observe" style steps.
- Orchestrates tool calls and feeds observations back into the next reasoning step.

Files:
- `src/agent/agent.ts`
- `src/agent/agent-middleware.ts`
- `src/agent/skills/*` (skill system middleware)

This layer should depend only on `foundation`, and remain generic (not coding-specific).

### 3) `coding`

A layer for coding-specific agents and tools.

- **Leading Agent**: `src/coding/agents/lead-agent.ts`
- **Tools**: `src/coding/tools/*`, including `bash`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `str_replace`, `list_files`, `glob_search`, `grep_search`, `apply_patch`, `file_info`, `mkdir`, `move_path`

### 4) `cli`

CLI layer for interactive agent usage:

- `src/cli/tui/*` - Terminal UI components built with Ink
- `src/cli/tui/hooks/*` - React hooks for the agent loop
- `src/cli/tui/themes/*` - TUI theming

## `community` (in-repo integrations)

In-repo integrations live under `src/community/*`.

- Treat these as optional adapters over `foundation` interfaces.
- Avoid coupling `foundation`/`agent` to integrations.

Current integrations:

- `src/community/openai`: `OpenAIModelProvider` backed by the `openai` SDK, using Chat Completions with function tools.

## Skills

Skill system for enhancing agent capabilities:

- Skills are loaded from the `skills/` directory at the project root
- Each skill is a self-contained module with a `SKILL.md` definition
- Skill middleware: `src/agent/skills/skill-reader.ts`, `src/agent/skills/skills-middleware.ts`

Current skills:
- `skill-creator` - Create and manage skills
- `frontend-design` - Frontend design and UI development

## Stack

- **Runtime / package manager**: [Bun](https://bun.com)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict, `moduleResolution: "bundler"`)
- **Dependencies**: `openai` (provider SDK), `zod` (tool parameter schemas), `ink` (TUI), `react` (UI components)

## Imports

- **Internal**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*` via `tsconfig` `paths`

## Conventions

- Keep comments minimal and intent-focused.
- Avoid drive-by refactors outside the task at hand.
- Provider options: `OpenAIModelProvider` merges `Model.options` into `chat.completions.create` (provider-specific flags allowed). Defaults include `temperature: 0` and `top_p: 0`.
- Agent loop: when an assistant message contains tool calls, tools are invoked in parallel and appended as `tool_result` messages before continuing.

## Commands

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
bun run check
bun run check:types
bun run lint
bun run lint:fix
bun run build:js
bun run build:bin
bun test
```

Environment variables used by the sample root `index.ts` are provider-specific (e.g. `ARK_BASE_URL`, `ARK_API_KEY` for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

## Testing

Tests use Bun’s built-in runner: **`bun test`**.

**Discovery (default):** Bun walks the tree from the current working directory and runs files whose names match `*.test.*`, `*_test.*`, `*.spec.*`, or `*_spec.*` (with extensions `js`, `jsx`, `ts`, or `tsx`). It skips `node_modules` and hidden directories (names starting with `.`). Optional `[test]` settings in `bunfig.toml` can narrow the scan (e.g. `root`, `pathIgnorePatterns`); see [Bun test discovery](https://bun.sh/docs/test/discovery).

**Where to put tests:** Prefer **co-located** unit tests next to the code under test—e.g. `src/.../__tests__/foo.test.ts` or `foo.test.ts` beside `foo.ts`—so modules and tests stay easy to navigate together. A top-level `tests/` tree is fine for integration-style suites, large fixtures, or anything you want physically separate from `src/`. Bun does not require a specific folder name; naming patterns matter more than layout.

**What must be tested:** **Not everything.** Unit tests are encouraged for pure logic, non-trivial algorithms, and regressions, but they are **not** a blanket requirement for every change. Thin glue, obvious pass-throughs, or exploratory edits may ship without new tests when the cost outweighs the benefit—use judgment and add tests when behavior is easy to break or hard to verify by hand.

## Notes: tool use rendering (CLI vs TUI)

There are two parallel renderers for `tool_use` content:

- `src/cli/tui/message-text.ts` (`toolUseText`) produces **ANSI-colored plain text**
