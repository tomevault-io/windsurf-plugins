description: Update all locale translation files when asked to write translations

# Translation Updates

- When the user asks to write, add, update, or replace a translation, update all 24 locale translation files in the project by default, not just English.
- Keep the translation key consistent across all locale files unless the user explicitly asks for a different key per language.
- Write each locale's value in that locale's original language. Do not copy English text into non-English locale files unless the user explicitly asks for English fallback text.
- A translation task is only complete when all 24 locale files have been updated for that key.
- If an exact translation for a non-English locale is uncertain, pause and ask the user instead of leaving only one locale updated or filling non-English locales with English.
