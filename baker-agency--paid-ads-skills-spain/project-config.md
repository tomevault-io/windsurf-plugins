## Skill Focus

All skills in this repository are focused on **paid advertising for the Spanish market (Spain)**:

- Lead generation, SaaS, and services businesses (NOT e-commerce)
- Benchmarks in EUR, IVA 21%, LOPD/GDPR compliance
- Spanish language ad copy, consumer behavior, seasonality
- Regional targeting (Comunidades Autónomas)

## Writing Style

- Extreme brevity: bullets, tables, numbered steps
- No paragraphs, no filler, no intros
- Mix of Spanish headers and English technical terms
- Attribution for all benchmarks and specific tactics
- Self-contained: each skill includes all necessary references
