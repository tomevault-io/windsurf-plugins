# GitHub Copilot Instructions for re9ai-bdi-calculation-service

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the **BDI Calculation Service** for the re9.ai platform - a chat-first renovation and budgeting platform that ensures compliance with Brazilian construction cost regulations.

The BDI Calculation Service handles Brazilian BDI (Basic Index of Construction Costs) compliance calculations, ensuring that all budget estimates and cost calculations adhere to Brazilian construction regulations and standards as defined by TCU (Federal Court of Auditors).

## Project Context

**re9.ai** is a renovation and budgeting platform that connects users with construction managers, builders, material sellers, and service providers through chat interfaces (WhatsApp, Telegram, web chat). The platform leverages AI to understand user needs and facilitate connections between all stakeholders in renovation projects.

For the Brazilian market, compliance with BDI calculations is critical for accurate budgeting and regulatory adherence.

## Wiki Submodule Documentation Context

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This repository includes a `wiki/` submodule that contains comprehensive architectural and business documentation.

### Wiki Structure and Content
The `wiki/` directory is a **read-only submodule** that mirrors the GitHub wiki repository. It contains:

#### Architecture Documentation (`wiki/architecture/`)
- System architecture and design documents for BDI services
- Component diagrams and technical specifications
- Infrastructure and deployment documentation
- Security and authentication specifications

#### Business Documentation (`wiki/business/`)
- Data model documentation with core entities and relationships
- User stories for all platform personas related to BDI features
- Business requirements and workflow specifications
- Integration and payment processing requirements

#### Root Level Documentation
- Project vision and storytelling documents
- Development guidelines and best practices

### Wiki Usage Guidelines for Copilot
1. **Always reference wiki content** when providing architectural context or business logic explanations
2. **Use wiki documentation** to understand the broader system design when suggesting changes
3. **Reference specific wiki files** when explaining how components support business requirements
4. **Consider chat integration requirements** when working on communication or API features

⚠️ **Wiki Editing Restrictions**: 
- The wiki submodule is **read-only** in this repository
- Wiki content should only be edited through GitHub's wiki interface or by working on the wiki repo directly
- Use `./scripts/update-wiki.sh` to sync latest wiki changes locally
- Never commit changes directly to files in the `wiki/` directory

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **For Backend**: Python with FastAPI, Node.js with Express
- **For Data Storage**: PostgreSQL, Redis for caching
- **For API**: RESTful API for integration with other platform services
- **For Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS EKS

### Development Environment
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- AWS CLI for cloud interactions

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Regulatory Compliance First** - All calculations must adhere to Brazilian construction regulations
2. **Chat-First Design** - All components support multiple chat platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram)
3. **Microservices Architecture** - Modular, scalable component design
4. **Infrastructure as Code** - Everything defined declaratively
5. **Multi-Environment Support** - Dev, staging, production environments
6. **Security by Design** - Encryption, authentication, authorization
7. **Cost Optimization** - Efficient resource utilization

## Development Guidelines for Copilot

### When Suggesting Changes
1. **Always consider the chat integration requirements** from the wiki
2. **Reference the system architecture** documentation
3. **Ensure changes align with the platform strategy**
4. **Consider the impact on BDI compliance requirements**
5. **Maintain consistency with project patterns and conventions**

### When Working with Business Logic
1. **Reference relevant user stories** from `wiki/business/user-stories/`
2. **Use the data model documentation** to understand entity relationships
3. **Reference chat integration patterns** for communication requirements
4. **Consider payment processing requirements** for financial operations

### When Explaining Technical Concepts
1. **Always reference wiki documentation** for authoritative information
2. **Use specific wiki files** to support technical explanations
3. **Consider the broader platform context** when making recommendations
4. **Reference architecture decisions** documented in the wiki
