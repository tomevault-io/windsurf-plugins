# Sync Guidelines

- Architecture: [docs/Chunked-Sync-Architecture.md](mdc:docs/Chunked-Sync-Architecture.md), [SYNC_WORKER_ARCHITECTURE.md](mdc:SYNC_WORKER_ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Migration and refactors: [SYNC_INNGEST_MIGRATION.md](mdc:SYNC_INNGEST_MIGRATION.md), [SYNC_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md](mdc:SYNC_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md), [SYNC_SCHEDULING_IMPLEMENTATION.md](mdc:SYNC_SCHEDULING_IMPLEMENTATION.md).
- CLI entry point: [api/src/sync/cli.ts](mdc:api/src/sync/cli.ts) (run with `pnpm run sync`).
- Connector registry (CLI): [api/src/sync/connector-registry.ts](mdc:api/src/sync/connector-registry.ts) with lazy imports.
- Inngest integration: [api/src/inngest](mdc:api/src/inngest).

## Connector vs Flow Responsibilities

- **Connectors** store only credentials and connection settings (endpoint, API key, auth headers).
- **Flows** define what data to sync:
  - `entityFilter`: which entities to sync (for connectors with fixed entities like Stripe, Close)
  - `queries`: GraphQL/PostHog query definitions (for query-based connectors)
- For GraphQL/PostHog connectors, queries are injected into the connector at sync time via `dataSource.connection.queries`.

Rules:

- Use chunked sync pattern; avoid long blocking operations in a single flow.
- Delegate connector-specific logic to `api/src/connectors/**`.
- All flows should be idempotent and checkpoint progress (by cursor/offset) per workspace.
- Prefer Inngest for scheduling/triggering; avoid ad-hoc timers.
- Do not store queries in connector config; they belong in the Flow.
