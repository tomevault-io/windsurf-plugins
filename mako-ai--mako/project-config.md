# Pre-commit / pre-PR checklist

CI is stricter than the `husky` pre-commit hook. Always run the package's full lint **and** typecheck for every package you touched before committing or opening a PR — not just the staged-files hook.

## Minimum gate per package

| You edited files under... | Run before committing |
| --- | --- |
| `app/` | `pnpm --filter app run typecheck && pnpm --filter app run lint` |
| `api/` | `pnpm --filter api run lint` (typecheck runs inside `api:build`) |
| `website/` | `pnpm --filter website run lint` |

For cross-package changes, `pnpm run lint:all` covers `app` + `api` + connector-agnosticism.

## Why the pre-commit hook is not enough

- `lint-staged` only runs on staged files, not the full package.
- Even with `--report-unused-disable-directives` in `lint-staged`, a stale `// eslint-disable-next-line ...` comment in an **unstaged** file (or one you touched but didn't restage) will still reach CI.
- CI's `eslint . --report-unused-disable-directives` treats unused disable directives as **errors** and fails the build. A clean pre-commit hook does not guarantee a green CI.

## Common gotchas that only CI catches

- **Unused `eslint-disable` directives.** When you fix a deps array or tighten a type, the surrounding `// eslint-disable-next-line` comment often becomes unused. Delete the comment in the same edit.
- **Pre-existing warnings you introduced one more of.** CI doesn't fail on warnings, but don't rely on that — remove warnings you can fix.
- **`@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion`** from `!` on store lookups. Use an `if (!x) return;` guard or `?.` instead.
- **`react/no-unescaped-entities`** from quotes/apostrophes inside JSX text. Use `&quot;` / `&apos;` or wrap in a string literal: `{"I'm"}`.
- **`react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`** from calling a hook after an early `return`. Move the hook above every early return.
