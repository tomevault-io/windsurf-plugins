# Connector Agnosticism & Schema-Driven UI

Purpose: Ensure adding a new connector requires only dropping a new folder under `api/src/connectors/**` and exposing a schema; no app code outside that folder needs changes.

Rules:

- Connectors must be 100% self-contained under `api/src/connectors/<type>/`.
- Connector schemas should define only credentials/connection settings (endpoint, API keys, auth headers).
- Query definitions (for query-based connectors) belong at the **flow level** (Flow.queries), not in connector config.
- UI must be schema-driven: forms render using the schema returned by `/api/connectors/:type/schema`.
- Do NOT hardcode connector-specific logic in shared components (e.g., `app/src/components/**`), routes, or services.
- If conditional fields are needed, use schema properties like `showIf` and `type: "select"` with `options`; never add branching by connector type in UI code.
- Connector registration happens via registries; adding a connector should not require editing the UI or non-registry backend files.
- Keep any connector-specific data transformations inside the connector implementation.

## Flow-Level Queries Schema

For connectors that require user-defined queries (like GraphQL, PostHog, or custom SQL connectors), the schema should expose a `transferQueries` property:

```typescript
static getConfigSchema() {
  return {
    fields: [
      // Connection/credential fields only
      { name: "endpoint", label: "Endpoint URL", type: "string", required: true },
    ],
    // Queries are configured at the Flow level
    transferQueries: {
      label: "GraphQL Queries",  // Display label
      required: true,            // Whether at least one query is required
      fields: [                  // Schema for each query item
        { name: "name", label: "Entity Name", type: "string", required: true },
        { name: "query", label: "Query", type: "textarea", required: true, rows: 8 },
        { name: "batch_size", label: "Batch Size", type: "number", default: 100 },
      ],
    },
  };
}
```

The frontend reads `schema.transferQueries` and dynamically renders the query editor in the Flow form. **Never** check connector types like `if (type === "graphql")` in UI code.

## HTTP & Rate Limiting

- Connectors using HTTP APIs should handle 429 (rate limit) and 5xx errors with retry + exponential backoff.
- Prefer a shared retry pattern within the connector (e.g., `executeWithRetry` wrapper) rather than ad-hoc retry loops in each method.
- Respect `Retry-After` headers when present.
- Do NOT log raw request/response headers — they may contain API keys or auth tokens.

## Schema Wiring

- **Every field in `getConfigSchema()` must be read at runtime.** If the schema exposes `api_base_url`, the connector client must use `this.dataSource.config.api_base_url` — never hardcode the URL.
- Credentials live on `this.dataSource.config` (decrypted at sync time). Fields with `type: "password"` or `encrypted: true` are encrypted at rest automatically.

## Enforcement Guidance

- During reviews, reject edits that add `if (type === "xyz")` checks outside connector folders.
- Prefer updating connector schemas over UI code to change field order, visibility, or control types.
- Check for `transferQueries` schema property presence, not connector type names.
- Verify that all schema fields are wired to the connector client — dead schema fields confuse users.
