# TypeScript & React Guidelines

- Prefer explicit types for exported APIs; avoid `any`.
- Use early returns and guard clauses; keep nesting shallow.
- Handle errors meaningfully; do not swallow exceptions.
- Follow descriptive naming (functions are verbs, variables are nouns). Avoid abbreviations.
- Keep comments short and explain "why", not "how". Avoid inline noise.
- Match existing formatting and do not reformat unrelated code in edits.
- Frontend: co-locate components under `app/src/components/**` and hooks under `app/src/hooks/**`.
- Backend: group routes under `api/src/routes/**` and services under `api/src/services/**`.

## `any` Policy

- **New code**: `any` is forbidden. Use `unknown` + type narrowing, generics, or specific types.
- **Third-party boundaries** (Monaco Editor, MUI internals, chart libraries): use `unknown` with assertion or a thin typed wrapper. If `any` is truly unavoidable, add a `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` with a brief justification.
- **Existing hotspots** (not blockers, but migrate when touching): `ResultsChart.tsx`, `Chat.tsx`, `workspace-context.tsx`, `ThemeContext.tsx`, `flowStore.ts`.
