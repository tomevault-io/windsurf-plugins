# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

An opinionated Helm chart for deploying Odoo ERP at IMIO. Intentionally scoped to IMIO's needs — not a general-purpose chart. Targets Odoo 16.0+ using the official Odoo Docker images rather than bitnami/odoo.

## Commands

```bash
# Lint the chart
helm lint .
helm lint -f test/local.yaml .

# Render templates (dry-run)
helm template odoo . -f test/local.yaml --namespace odoo

# Update dependencies (PostgreSQL from bitnami)
helm dep up

# Deploy to a local cluster
helm upgrade odoo . -f test/local.yaml --namespace odoo --create-namespace --install
```

The `helmlint.sh` script is used as a pre-commit hook and runs `helm lint` on changed files.

## Architecture

### Deployment Design

The main deployment (`templates/deployment.yaml`) runs **two containers** in a single pod:

1. **Nginx** — reverse proxy that handles HTTP (port 80→8069) and long-polling WebSocket (port 80→8072), gzip compression, and X-Forwarded headers for SSL termination
2. **Odoo** — the ERP application (port 8069 HTTP, port 8072 long-polling)

Strategy is always `Recreate` by default (no rolling updates, since Odoo requires a single writer).

### Services

Three separate services expose different ports:
- `odoo-nginx` (ClusterIP :80) — external entry point, routes to Nginx
- `odoo-odoo` (ClusterIP :8069) — internal Odoo HTTP
- `odoo-odoo-longpolling` (ClusterIP :8072) — WebSocket/chat

### Configuration and Secrets

Odoo is configured via `odoo.conf` injected as a Kubernetes Secret. Three mutually exclusive approaches:

1. **Default**: Secrets generated from `values.yaml` values (`existingSecret.enabled: false`, `externalsecrets.enabled: false`)
2. **Existing Secret**: Reference a pre-created Kubernetes Secret (`existingSecret.enabled: true`)
3. **External Secrets**: Vault integration via external-secrets.io operator (`externalsecrets.enabled: true`)

Nginx configuration is in a ConfigMap (`templates/configmap.yaml`).

### Maintenance Mode

When `maintenance.enabled: true`, the chart:
- Scales the main Odoo deployment to 0 replicas
- Scales the cron deployment to 0 replicas (so scheduled actions don't write to the DB during migrations/restores)
- Deploys a maintenance page (custom HTML or default)
- Redirects Ingress traffic to the maintenance service

### Health Checks

Both liveness and readiness probes for Odoo hit `/web/health` on the Odoo HTTP port. Liveness has a 120s initial delay; readiness has 30s. The Nginx sidecar probes hit `/healthz` on port 80, which returns 200 directly without proxying to Odoo.

### PostgreSQL

Bundled PostgreSQL (bitnami chart, OCI registry) is optional and controlled by `postgresql.enabled`. For production, an external PostgreSQL (e.g., CloudNativePG) is recommended. The `global.security.allowInsecureImages: true` setting is required due to the bitnami legacy repo.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `values.yaml` | All default configuration with inline comments |
| `templates/_helpers.tpl` | Shared template helpers (names, labels, selectors) |
| `templates/deployment.yaml` | Main Odoo + Nginx pod definition |
| `templates/secrets.yaml` | PostgreSQL credentials and `odoo.conf` secret |
| `templates/configmap.yaml` | Nginx config and maintenance page HTML |
| `templates/externalsecrets.yaml` | Vault/external-secrets integration |
| `test/local.yaml` | Development overrides (ingress enabled, `odoo.local` hostname) |

## CI/CD

- **Push / PR**: Runs `helm lint` + test via `IMIO/gha/helm-test-notify@v6`
- **Release**: Triggered on successful test on tag; publishes to `https://imio.github.io/helm-charts` via `IMIO/gha/helm-release-notify@v6`

Before creating and pushing a git tag, ensure `version` in `Chart.yaml` matches the tag. The release workflow is triggered by tag pushes and builds dependencies (bitnami) and packages the chart automatically.
