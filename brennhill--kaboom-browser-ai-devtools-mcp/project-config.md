# Kaboom MCP — Core Rules

Browser extension + MCP server for real-time browser telemetry.
**Stack:** Go (zero deps) | Chrome Extension (MV3) | MCP (JSON-RPC 2.0)

---

## 🔴 Mandatory Rules

1. **TDD** — Write tests first, then implementation
2. **No `any`** — TypeScript strict mode, no implicit any
3. **Zero Deps** — No production dependencies in Go or extension
4. **Compile TS** — Run `make compile-ts` after ANY src/ change
5. **5 Tools** — observe, generate, configure, interact, analyze
6. **Performance** — WebSocket < 0.1ms, HTTP < 0.5ms
7. **Privacy** — All data stays local, no external transmission
8. **Wire Types** — `wire_*.go` and `wire-*.ts` are the source of truth for HTTP payloads. Changes to either side MUST update the counterpart. Run `make check-wire-drift`
9. **Docs Cross-Ref (Required)** — EVERY feature and EVERY refactor MUST ship with cross-referenced docs updates (flow map + feature pointers + code/test paths)

## Git Workflow

- Branch from `UNSTABLE`, PR to `UNSTABLE`
- Never push directly to `stable`
- Squash commits before merge

---

## Commands

```bash
make compile-ts    # REQUIRED after src/ changes
make test          # All tests
make ci-local      # Full CI locally
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript check
npm run lint       # ESLint
```

## Testing

**Primary UAT Script:** [`scripts/test-all-tools-comprehensive.sh`](scripts/test-all-tools-comprehensive.sh)

Tests: cold start, tool calls, concurrent clients, stdout purity, persistence, graceful shutdown.

```bash
./scripts/test-all-tools-comprehensive.sh  # Run full UAT
```

**UAT Rules:**

- **NEVER modify tests during UAT** — run tests as-is, report results
- If tests have issues, note them and propose changes AFTER UAT completes
- UAT validates the npm-installed version (`kaboom-agentic-browser` from PATH)
- Extension must be connected for data flow tests to pass

## Code Standards

**JSON API fields:** ALL JSON fields use `snake_case`. No exceptions. External spec fields (MCP protocol, SARIF) are tagged with `// SPEC:<name>` comments.

**TypeScript:**

- No dynamic imports in service worker (background/)
- No circular dependencies
- Content scripts must be bundled (MV3 limitation)
- All fetch() needs try/catch + response.ok check

**Go:**

- Append-only I/O on hot paths
- Single-pass eviction (never loop-remove-recheck)
- File headers required: `// filename.go — Purpose summary.`

**File size:** Max 800 LOC. Refactor if larger.

## Documentation Cross-Reference Contract (Required)

For every feature and every refactor, update docs in the same change:

1. Add or update the canonical flow map in `docs/architecture/flow-maps/`.
2. Add or update the feature-local `flow-map.md` pointer under `docs/features/feature/<feature>/` when a feature folder exists.
3. Update the feature `index.md`:
   - `last_reviewed`
   - `code_paths` and `test_paths`
   - link to `flow-map.md`
4. Update `docs/architecture/flow-maps/README.md` when adding a new canonical flow map.
5. Keep cross-links bidirectional (feature -> canonical map, and canonical map lists code/test anchors).

No code-only refactor is considered complete until this documentation contract is satisfied.

## Engineering Best Practices Contract (Required)

1. Instruction precedence is strict: system > repo policy > task request > style preference.
2. If requirements are ambiguous, state assumptions explicitly before implementation.
3. Definition of done includes code + tests + docs + flow maps in the same change.
4. Lint/type/test must pass, or known failures must be documented with issue links.
5. Keep modules single-purpose; avoid god objects and hidden shared state.
6. Keep public interfaces minimal and explicit; cross-feature calls go through clear boundaries.
7. Refactors must preserve behavior unless a behavior change is explicitly requested.
8. Every bug fix must include a regression test that fails before and passes after.
9. Prefer deterministic tests (mocks/fakes/controlled clocks) over sleep-based timing.
10. Enforce startup and request latency budgets with explicit timeout/retry/backoff policies.
11. Use structured logs with correlation IDs; avoid protocol-breaking stdout/stderr noise.
12. Version public contracts and keep wire schemas synchronized across Go/TS boundaries.
13. Redact secrets from logs/errors/diagnostics and never commit credentials.
14. New dependencies require explicit justification; remove unused dependencies promptly.
15. Reviews and handoffs must cover correctness, modularity, performance, testability, docs quality, and DRY adherence.
16. CI must block merges on broken docs links, missing required docs, or failing quality gates.
17. ToolHandler naming convention is strict: `tool*` for top-level MCP mode/action entry points, `handle*` for sub-action handlers/helpers.
18. Shared extension storage keys (`TRACKED_TAB_*`, recording state, pending intents) must be accessed through feature helpers/modules; avoid new ad-hoc read/write/remove call sites.
19. Multi-entry-point actions (keyboard, context menu, popup, MCP) must use one shared toggle/start-stop helper so behavior stays identical.
