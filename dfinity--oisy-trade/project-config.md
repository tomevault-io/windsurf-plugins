# CLAUDE.md

# Commits

* Run formatting (`cargo fmt --all`) and linting (`just lint`) before committing.

# Pull Requests

* When asked to create a PR, always create it in draft mode.
* When asked to set a PR description,
    * be concise
    * remove the "Test plan" section.
    * focus on the purpose of the PR and not on the implementation details (like name of structs). Do this by summarizing the prompts used in that session leading to the PR.

## Spec-driven build loop (GitHub PR)

Specs live in `docs/src/development/specs/` as `DEFI-XXXX-short-slug.md` and follow
the template at `docs/src/development/specs/template.md`. When I ask you to write a
spec, start from that template; the build loop below consumes the spec's
**Requirements** and its **Delivery / PR sequence**.

When I give you a specification to build:

1. Delegate to the `implementer` subagent with the full spec: build on a feature
   branch, open a DRAFT PR, report the PR number.
2. Delegate to the `reviewer` subagent. Pass it ONLY the spec and the PR number —
   do NOT paste the diff, so it can read the title/description before the code and
   review without anchoring. It posts its verdict to the PR via `gh`.
3. If the reviewer returns VERDICT: CHANGES_REQUESTED, OR the PR carries any unresolved
   comment — a review thread not marked resolved, or a comment (from the reviewer, me,
   Copilot, or any other reviewer/bot) not yet answered with a commit and/or a reply —
   send those comments back to `implementer`, which answers with NEW commits (no
   amend/rebase/squash/force-push) and replies on each thread. Repeat from 2.
   Check for unresolved comments via `gh`, not by eye — all via `gh api`: conversation
   comments at `repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<n>/comments`, inline review comments at
   `repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/comments`, review summaries at
   `repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/reviews`; review-thread resolution state via the
   GraphQL `reviewThreads` field (not exposed by `gh pr view --json`).
   After ANY push to the PR — an `implementer` fix, a `main`-merge, a rebase — re-run
   *all three* of these before going idle, never one without the others (a push that
   re-triggers CI also re-triggers bot review):
     - the CI check (`gh pr checks`);
     - this unresolved-comment check;
     - the PR's mergeability (`gh pr view <n> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus`): the
       conflict signal is the `mergeable` field equal to `CONFLICTING` (equivalently, the
       `mergeStateStatus` field equal to `DIRTY`) — these are two fields with distinct
       value sets, so always compare each value against its own field. `mergeable:
       UNKNOWN` (GitHub recomputes mergeability asynchronously, common right after a push
       or a `main` advance) is NOT a verdict — treat it as a re-poll state: wait briefly
       and query again until it settles to `MERGEABLE` or `CONFLICTING`. Bound the retries
       (a handful of polls over ~a minute); if it never settles, fall back to attempting a
       trial `origin/main` merge to decide, and surface the stuck state rather than looping
       forever.
   Mergeability must ALSO be polled on every idle tick even with no push, because `main`
   advancing independently can turn the PR `mergeable: CONFLICTING` while CI stays green
   and no new comment appears — a CI run reflects the merge commit GitHub generated for the
   triggering push, so it will not catch a conflict introduced by a later `main` commit.
   When `mergeable` is
   `CONFLICTING`, merge `origin/main` into the PR (`git merge`, never rebase), resolve
   conflicts keeping the PR's own changes, re-run checks, and continue the loop.
4. The automated loop is DONE only when the reviewer returns VERDICT: READY AND the PR
   has no unresolved comments AND its `mergeable` has settled to `MERGEABLE` (not
   `CONFLICTING`, not `UNKNOWN`). Then: do NOT mark the PR ready for review — leave it as a
   draft and post a comment saying the PR is ready for my review, then summarize the
   state and STOP.
   This STOP is a pause, not the end: while the PR stays open it keeps accruing activity
   (my review, a bot re-review, `main` advancing), so any new commit, unresolved comment,
   or the PR turning unmergeable (`mergeable: CONFLICTING`) re-enters the loop at step 3 —
   do not treat an open PR as finished.
   Do NOT approve and do NOT merge — marking ready, final approval, and merge are mine
   to do manually.

For stacked PRs: whenever a PR is added to, removed from, or reordered within a stack,
refresh the "📚 PR stack" section of every *other* PR in the stack (and the spec's
**Delivery / PR sequence**) so they all stay consistent — e.g. opening PR N means going
back to PRs 1..N-1 and adding PR N to their stack lists. This is the orchestrator's job:
the `implementer` only maintains the stack section of the PR it is building, since it is
scoped to a single PR and shouldn't reach into siblings.

When a stack's base PR merges, bring each dependent PR up to date: retarget its base to
the new parent (usually `main`), merge the parent in and resolve conflicts (keeping the
dependent's own changes), re-run its checks until green, and refresh its stack section
