# heptabase-cli-skills

Public Agent Skills package for the Heptabase CLI. Everything committed here is visible worldwide (GitHub + user installs). Treat secrets and internal details as permanent once pushed.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`skills/`](skills/) | Product skills shipped to users (`heptabase-cli`, …) |
| [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) | Maintainer skills (`public-repo-guard`, `release`) — edit here only |
| [`.agents/skills`](.agents/skills) | Symlink to `.claude/skills/` for Codex and other skills-compatible agents |

Do not duplicate maintainer skills under `.agents/`.
