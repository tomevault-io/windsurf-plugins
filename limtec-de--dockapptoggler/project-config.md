* Focuses on system integration and dock manipulation
* Prioritizes performance and reliability

## Code Style and Structure

* Write concise, idiomatic Swift code
* Use Swift's modern features and patterns
* Prefer value types over reference types when appropriate
* Use descriptive variable names that reflect their purpose
* Structure repository files as follows:

```
Sources/
├── DockAppToggler/
    ├── main.swift        # Application entry point
    ├── Info.plist        # App configuration
    └── Utils/            # Helper functions
.github/
└── workflows/            # CI/CD configurations
```

## Tech Stack

* Swift
* macOS AppKit
* XCode build system

## Naming Conventions

* Use PascalCase for type names (classes, structs, enums, protocols)
* Use camelCase for method, variable, and constant names
* Use descriptive names that reflect purpose

## Swift Usage

* Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
* Use strong typing and avoid force unwrapping
* Implement proper error handling
* Use Swift's modern concurrency features when appropriate

* Secure any user data handling

## Git Usage

Commit Message Prefixes:
* "fix:" for bug fixes
* "feat:" for new features
* "docs:" for documentation changes
* "refactor:" for code refactoring
* "test:" for adding tests
* "chore:" for maintenance

Rules:
* Keep commit messages short and concise
* Use lowercase for commit messages
* Reference issue numbers when applicable

## Documentation

* Maintain clear README with setup instructions
