# AGENTS.md

This is the authoritative control surface for all coding agents. Read this first.

## 1. Repository Map

```
apps/web/          Next.js 16 frontend (App Router, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui)
services/api/      FastAPI backend (layered: types/config/repo/service/runtime)
packages/shared/   Shared TypeScript types
docs/              System of record (features, workflows, security, reliability)
docs/exec-plans/   Execution plans and tech debt tracker
infra/railway/     Deployment config
```

## 2. Building on This Starter Kit

When this repo is used as the foundation for a new app, the following pieces are part of the starter contract — keep them. Adapt only what the new use case actually requires.

**Keep as-is (do not strip, rename, or replace)**
- **UI kit / design system.** `apps/web/src/components/ui/` (shadcn primitives), the design tokens in `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`, and the `/design` reference page. Build new screens with these primitives; never edit the generated `components/ui/` files directly. Restyling happens through tokens in `globals.css`.
- **File Explorer.** `/files` route, `apps/web/src/app/files/`, and `apps/web/src/components/files/`. The Files sidebar entry in `apps/web/src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx` stays.
- **Upload.** `/upload` route, `apps/web/src/app/upload/`, and `apps/web/src/components/upload/`. The Upload sidebar entry stays.
- The sidebar nav itself (Dashboard, Upload, Files, Settings, plus the Design System utility link).

**Adapt to the new use case**
- **Dashboard.** `/` route and `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/` (stats cards, upload chart, recent uploads table) are illustrative defaults. Replace them with metrics, charts, and tables that reflect what the new app actually does (e.g. transcripts processed, embeddings indexed, classifications run). New aggregations must flow through the same `runtime -> service -> repo` layering and be exposed via TanStack Query hooks in `apps/web/src/lib/queries.ts` — no bare `useEffect + fetch`.
- Update `docs/features/dashboard.md` in the same PR as any dashboard change (see §9).

**Why this contract exists**
- The UI kit, Files, and Upload pages are the reusable B2-backed scaffolding that makes this a starter kit — stripping them defeats the purpose. The dashboard is the only screen explicitly designed to be rewritten per app.

## 3. Architectural Invariants

**Backend layering**: `types` -> `config` -> `repo` -> `service` -> `runtime`

- No backward imports across layers
- No `boto3` outside `repo/`
- No business logic in route handlers (`runtime/`)
- All external APIs wrapped in `repo/` adapters
- All request/response data validated at boundary (Pydantic models)
- No shared mutable state across layers

**Frontend**: shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/` are generated — never modify them.

**Data fetching**: every API call flows through TanStack Query hooks in `apps/web/src/lib/queries.ts`. No bare `useEffect + fetch` patterns. New endpoints touch three files: `runtime/<router>.py`, `lib/api-client.ts`, `lib/queries.ts`.

## 4. Quality Expectations

- **DRY** — do not duplicate logic, types, or constants. Extract shared code only when used in 2+ places.
- Structured JSON logging only — no `print()` statements
- No raw SDK calls outside `repo/` layer
- Files stay under 300 lines
- Tests added or updated for every behavior change
- Docs updated in same PR as code changes
- Lint clean before merge
- Prefer boring, composable libraries over clever abstractions
- No implicit type assumptions — use typed models

## 5. Mechanical Enforcement

| Rule | Enforced by |
|------|-------------|
| No backward imports | `tests/test_structure.py::test_no_backward_imports` |
| No boto3 outside repo/ | `tests/test_structure.py::test_boto3_only_in_repo` |
| File size < 300 lines | `tests/test_structure.py::test_file_size_limits` |
| All layers exist | `tests/test_structure.py::test_all_layers_exist` |
| No bare print() | `ruff` rule T20 |
| Import ordering | `ruff` rule I001 |
| Frontend strict equality | `eslint` rule eqeqeq |
| No unused vars | `eslint` + `ruff` rules |

## 6. Commands

```bash
# Run
pnpm dev               # start both frontend and backend
pnpm dev:web           # frontend only
pnpm dev:api           # backend only

# Test & Lint
pnpm lint              # frontend lint (eslint)
pnpm build             # frontend type check + build
pnpm lint:api          # backend lint (ruff)
pnpm test:api          # backend tests (pytest)
pnpm check:structure   # structural boundary tests
pnpm test:e2e          # Playwright e2e tests
```

## 7. Agent Workflow

1. Read this file first.
2. Review [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) before structural changes.
3. For non-trivial changes, create a plan in `docs/exec-plans/active/`.
4. Implement the smallest coherent change.
5. Run: `pnpm lint && pnpm lint:api && pnpm test:api && pnpm check:structure`
6. Update docs in the same PR (see §9).
7. Move completed plans to `docs/exec-plans/completed/`.
8. Only change files relevant to the task. No drive-by improvements.

## 8. Frontend Conventions
