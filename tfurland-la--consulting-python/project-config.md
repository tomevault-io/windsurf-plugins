# CLAUDE.md

## What this repo is

A learning repository for Python fundamentals and the Anthropic Claude SDK, built
as preparation for the Claude Certified Architect – Foundations (CCAR-F) exam.
Anthropic also offers a Professional-level architect credential; this repo
targets Foundations. It is designed to work as a **responsive study companion
alongside the official Anthropic Skilljar course** — a supplement, not a
replacement.

`python_course.html` is the canonical course content (Modules 1–4, testing with
pytest, Git & secrets, common gotchas, Claude Code CLI). The `lessonN.py` files
are the worked code; the `test_*.py` files are the accompanying tests.

## How to work in this repo

**Audience.** Assume the person here is an experienced professional who is newer
to Python, or returning to coding after a long gap. Explain the *why*, not just
the *what*. Define jargon the first time it appears. Analogies to other languages
(C#, Java) can help, but don't assume current fluency in them.

**Teach, don't just do.** When asked to explain a concept, give a short, concrete
explanation tied to a runnable example in this repo. When the learner hits an
error, walk them through diagnosing it rather than silently fixing it. On request,
quiz them on a module and check answers against `python_course.html`.

**Test-driven loop.** When writing or changing code:
1. Write a failing test that expresses the requirement.
2. Write the minimum code to pass it.
3. Refactor toward clean, single-responsibility design.
Follow the pytest conventions already in use: files named `test_*.py`, functions
named `test_*`, one behavior per test, plain `assert`.

**Deconflict, don't paper over.** If a change makes an existing test fail, stop and
surface it. Explain what broke and why, and ask how to resolve it — don't quietly
edit the old test to make it pass.

**Challenge assumptions.** If a request rests on a shaky assumption, or there's a
gap or a cleaner approach, say so directly before proceeding. Don't optimize for
agreement.

**Verify, don't memorize.** Model strings, SDK parameters, and pricing change. When
a fact about the Anthropic API or Claude Code matters, check current docs at
https://docs.claude.com rather than relying on training data.

## Hard rules — secrets & hygiene

- Never commit secrets. The API key lives in `.env`, which is gitignored. Never
  print, paste, hard-code, or commit it.
- Never put real keys in example files, tests, or this file.
- Respect `.gitignore`. Generated output and `.venv/` stay out of version control.
- Before any `git push`, summarize what will be pushed and wait for confirmation.

## Repo map

- `python_course.html` — the full course (source of truth for content)
- `README.md` — overview and how to start
- `requirements.txt` — direct dependencies; the one place to add a new one
- `lesson1.py … lesson5.py` — worked examples per module
- `test_lesson1/3/4/5.py`, `test_consulting_assistant.py` — tests
  (`pytest -v --ignore=exercises`; the API-backed ones skip without a key)
- `consulting_assistant.py` — a worked assistant: system prompt + multi-turn loop + prompt caching
- `output.json` — sample JSON output
- `practice-exam/` — CCAR-F adaptive practice exam: local desktop app (`exam_app.py`,
  `exam.html`, reviewed question bank in `questions.js`) plus the Claude.ai artifact
  recipe; design in `practice-exam/local_practice_exam_spec.md`
- `exercises/` — hands-on CCAR-F preparation exercises (start at `exercises/README.md`).
  Scaffolding follows the role-split contract in that README: Claude must never
  implement the exam-tested logic there — stubs, assertions, and prompts are the
  learner's work by design.

## Run it

```
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -v --ignore=exercises
```

`--ignore=exercises` is not tidying up: those tests are **meant** to be red.
Each is a `pytest.fail("SCAFFOLD-TODO: …")` gate standing in for work the
learner writes, and the friction is the point — see
[`exercises/README.md`](exercises/README.md), which is also why this repo's own
TDD stop-gate ignores that folder. Work through them one exercise at a time
(`pytest exercises/exercise1 -v`) and track what is left with
`grep -rc "SCAFFOLD-TODO" exercises/exercise1/`. Running the whole suite without
this flag buries the tests that report real breakage under dozens of failures
that are simply your next assignment.

Tests that call the live API (`test_lesson5.py`, `test_consulting_assistant.py`,
`test_consulting_notes_extractor.py`) skip themselves with a message when no
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, so a fresh clone runs clean before you add your key.

## Personalize this locally (keep your context out of the public repo)

This file is committed and public, so keep it generic. Put anything personal — your
own firm's frameworks and methodology, your preferences, sandbox details, or the
voice you want the assistant's system prompt to use — in a layer that is **not**
committed.

Recommended (current best practice): keep a personal instructions file in your home
directory and import it. Add the import to your user-level memory at
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (or to a local-only copy of this file):
