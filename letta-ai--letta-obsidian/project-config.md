# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this Obsidian plugin.

## Project Overview
This is a Letta AI Agent plugin for Obsidian that allows users to chat with a stateful AI agent that knows their vault contents and remembers conversations. The plugin automatically syncs vault files to Letta and provides an integrated chat interface within Obsidian.

## Key Features
- **Stateful AI Agent**: Uses Letta's persistent memory system for conversation continuity
- **Automatic Vault Sync**: Syncs markdown files to Letta with directory structure preservation
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-syncs file changes when files are created, modified, or deleted
- **Integrated Chat Interface**: Sidebar panel with support for reasoning, tool calls, and responses
- **Memory Block Management**: Full CRUD operations for agent memory blocks with conflict resolution
- **Block Search & Attach**: Search and attach existing memory blocks across projects
- **Project-Aware Interface**: Displays current project context and manages multi-project workflows
- **ADE Integration**: Direct links to Letta's web-based Agent Development Environment
- **Agent Switching**: Easy switching between different agents within projects
- **File Change Detection**: Only syncs files that have actually changed (compares sizes and timestamps)
- **Directory Structure Preservation**: Encodes paths using `__` separators (e.g., `folder__subfolder__file.md`)

## Development Commands
- **Start development**: `npm run dev` - Compiles TypeScript and watches for changes
- **Build for production**: `npm run build` - Type checks and builds production bundle
- **Install dependencies**: `npm install` - Installs letta-client and dev dependencies

## Local Letta Setup Notes
- **Streaming Support**: The plugin attempts to use streaming API for real-time responses but gracefully falls back to non-streaming for local instances with CORS issues
- **CORS Configuration**: Local Letta servers may need CORS headers configured to support streaming from Obsidian (`app://obsidian.md` origin)
- **Fallback Behavior**: When streaming fails (typically due to CORS), the plugin automatically falls back to the standard messages API

## Code Architecture

### Main Plugin Classes
- **LettaPlugin**: Main plugin class extending Obsidian's Plugin
- **LettaChatView**: Sidebar chat interface with integrated controls
- **LettaMemoryView**: Memory block management interface
- **LettaSettingTab**: Settings configuration page
- **AgentConfigModal**: Agent configuration and switching interface

### Key Components
1. **Letta Client Integration**: Handles API communication with Letta service
2. **File Sync System**: Manages uploading and updating vault files to Letta
3. **Chat Interface**: Rich modal dialog with message history and real-time responses
4. **Settings Management**: Configurable API keys, agent names, and sync behavior

### Plugin Lifecycle
- `onload()`: Initialize Letta connection, setup file watchers, create UI elements
- `onunload()`: Clean up connections and resources
- Settings are persisted using Obsidian's `loadData()`/`saveData()` methods

### File Sync Logic
- Watches for file create/modify/delete events in the vault
- Compares local file modification times with Letta's `updated_at` timestamps
- Only uploads files that have changed to minimize API calls
- Preserves directory structure by encoding paths in filenames

### Chat System
- Displays different message types (user, assistant, reasoning, tool calls)
- Real-time streaming of agent responses
- Handles errors gracefully with user feedback
- Maintains conversation history within the modal session

## Configuration
The plugin requires these settings:
- **Letta API Key**: Authentication token for Letta service
- **Project Slug**: Letta project identifier
- **Template ID**: Agent template to use (default: `obsidian-agent:latest`)
- **Agent Name**: Display name for the AI agent
- **Source Name**: Name for the Letta source containing vault files
- **Auto Sync**: Toggle for automatic file synchronization
- **Sync on Startup**: Whether to sync all files when Obsidian starts

## Usage Patterns
1. **Initial Setup**: Configure API key and connection settings
2. **First Sync**: Run manual sync to upload all vault files
3. **Chat Interaction**: Use ribbon icon or command palette to open chat
4. **Automatic Updates**: Files sync automatically as you edit them
5. **Agent Memory**: Agent remembers context across conversation sessions

## File Structure
- `main.ts`: Core plugin logic and API integration
- `styles.css`: Chat interface styling with dark/light theme support
- `manifest.json`: Plugin metadata and compatibility info
- `package.json`: Dependencies including letta-client

## API Integration
The plugin uses the official `letta-client` package for:
- Agent management (create, retrieve, message)
- Source management (create, attach to agent)
- File operations (upload, delete, list with metadata)
- Message streaming with support for reasoning and tool calls

## Error Handling
- Graceful connection failures with user notifications
- Retry logic for temporary network issues
- Fallback behaviors when Letta service is unavailable
