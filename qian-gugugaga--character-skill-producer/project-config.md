# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

CSP (Character Skill Producer) is an open-source **meta-skill** that turns anime/game fictional characters into executable Agent Skills. Given a character name and series, it researches authoritative sources, cross-validates evidence, distills behavior patterns, and outputs a runnable `SKILL.md` character role-playing skill.

This repo is `github.com/qian-gugugaga/Character_Skill_Producer`. Generated skills follow the AgentSkills convention: YAML frontmatter plus Markdown body, with research artifacts kept under `references/research/` for transparency.

CSP is not a character-card generator and does not target real-person distillation. The project is focused on 二次元 anime/manga/game characters and executable behavior instructions rather than static profiles or archetype labels.

## Platform Notes

- Shell is bash on Windows (Git Bash / MSYS). Use Unix-style syntax: `/dev/null` not `NUL`, forward slashes in paths.
- `python3` is not aliased on this machine. Use `python` for local commands, even when docs or script headers show `python3`.
- `package.json` currently only declares the `docx` dependency; there is no Node build/test script for CSP itself.

## Commands

```bash
# Install package dependencies if needed by local tooling
npm install

# Quality-check a generated skill (7 checks: behavior patterns, expression, contradictions, etc.)
python scripts/quality_check.py <path/to/SKILL.md>

# Summarize research results from references/research/ under a generated skill directory
python scripts/merge_research.py <skill_directory>

# Fetch Moegirl Wiki entries through the MediaWiki API
python scripts/moegirl_api.py "角色名"              # auto: intro → search → fallback
python scripts/moegirl_api.py "角色名" --intro      # intro extract for a known title
python scripts/moegirl_api.py "角色名" --search     # candidate page titles
python scripts/moegirl_api.py "角色名" --full       # full plaintext extract
python scripts/moegirl_api.py "角色名" --wikitext   # raw wikitext fallback
```

There is no build step, lint command, or test suite for this repo. The closest validations are `quality_check.py` for generated skills and `merge_research.py` for research completeness.

## Architecture

### Canonical Source vs Installable Skill

The root files are the canonical source for CSP development:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `SKILL.md` | Main CSP meta-skill and pipeline instructions |
| `references/skill-template.md` | Template used to assemble generated character skills |
| `references/distillation-framework.md` | Methodology for extracting behavior patterns from research |
| `scripts/quality_check.py` | Quality gate for generated character skills |
| `scripts/merge_research.py` | Research-summary/checkpoint generator |
| `scripts/moegirl_api.py` | Moegirlpedia MediaWiki API wrapper |
| `PRD.md` | Product definition and long-term scope, in English |

`examples/csp/` is the self-contained installable CSP skill. It bundles its own copies of `SKILL.md`, `references/`, and `scripts/` so users can copy or install it independently. When changing root `SKILL.md`, `references/*.md`, or `scripts/*.py`, keep the corresponding files in `examples/csp/` in sync or the published skill will diverge from the source.

Generated character examples live in `examples/<slug>/`. Installed local skills live in `.claude/skills/<slug>/`; `.claude/` is gitignored and should not be treated as source.

### CSP Meta-Skill Pipeline

When a user asks to generate a character skill, CSP follows this staged flow:

1. **Requirement confirmation** — character name, series, optional focus, and whether the user has official local materials.
2. **Directory creation** — create the skill directory and `references/research/` before research begins.
3. **5 parallel research agents** — Setting (`01-setting.md`), Personality (`02-personality.md`), Expression (`03-expression.md`), Relationships (`04-relationships.md`), Key Scenes (`05-key-scenes.md`). Each agent must write its findings to the corresponding file.
4. **Research quality checkpoint** — use `merge_research.py` or an equivalent summary to report source count, key findings, contradictions, and missing dimensions before distillation.
5. **Behavioral distillation** — extract behavior patterns, expression texture, social cognition, decision logic, hard constraints, and honesty boundaries. Core behavior patterns should pass both cross-scene recurrence and executability checks.
6. **Distillation confirmation** — summarize the extracted patterns and limits for user confirmation before assembly.
7. **SKILL.md assembly** — fill `references/skill-template.md` from the distilled material.
8. **Quality verification** — run `quality_check.py` and use independent known-scene replay / edge-case inference where appropriate. Show verification results before calling the work complete.

### Generated Skill Structure

Each character skill is a self-contained directory:

```text
<character-slug>/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    └── research/
        ├── 01-setting.md
        ├── 02-personality.md
        ├── 03-expression.md
