# Drink Up! — Agent Instructions

## Quick Start

- **Stack**: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Pixi.js v8 + PeerJS (WebRTC P2P multiplayer)
- **Build check**: `npx vite build` (the `vue-tsc` in `npm run build` has a known `.vue` module error — use `npx vite build` for validation)
- **Dev server**: `npm run dev` (HTTPS via vite-plugin-mkcert)
- **No automated tests** — manual browser testing required (WebRTC + Pixi canvas)

## Architecture

Authoritative host simulation. Host runs game logic at 60Hz tick, broadcasts state at 20Hz to all clients via PeerJS.

## Key Patterns

### Two-Button Interaction System
- **E key** = Grab/Drop (pick up items, put down on surfaces, sub-menu for glass shelf)
- **Space** = Action/Interact (take orders, serve drinks, craft at appliances, sub-menu for variant selection)
- Sub-menus: Arrow keys / WASD navigate, 1-4 direct select, Enter/Space/E confirm, Escape cancel

### Context-Sensitive Sub-Menu Flow
1. Client detects situation (holding glass + facing appliance, or empty-handed + glass shelf)
2. Vue SubMenu overlay opens at player's screen position
3. Player selects variant
4. `CLIENT_SELECT` packet sent to server
5. `Engine.bartenderSelect()` handles both craft mode (transform item) and grab mode (spawn item)

### Item Lifecycle
Glass Shelf → Pick glass type (E sub-menu) → Appliance (Space sub-menu) → Transform to drink → Serve to guest → Drink sits on counter during DRINKING → Transforms to DIRTY_GLASS when finished → Pick up (E) → Sink (Space) → Consumed

### Guest Lifecycle
Spawn at entrance → Walk to random seat → DECIDING → READY_TO_ORDER → WAITING_FOR_ORDER → DRINKING → (reorder or leave) → LEAVING → Removed

### State Data Sync
When adding fields to any state interface (Guest, Player, Item, Appliance), update THREE places:
1. The interface in `Shared/` (e.g., `IGuestStateData`)
2. The `state` getter in the server class (e.g., `Guest.ts`)
3. The Zod schema in `ServerPacketHandler.ts` (uses `z.nativeEnum` for enums — auto-updates)

### Rendering Items on Surfaces
Items placed on appliances (counter, service bar) render as color-coded pills in `Level.ts` update loop. The item pool grows as needed.

## Layout

20x15 grid. Row 0: wall. Rows 1-2: employee area (appliances). Row 3: bar counter (14 seats, x=2 to x=15). Row 4: walking lane. Rows 5-12: seating (hightops at y=7, tables at y=10). Row 13: walking lane. Row 14: wall + entrance at center.

Service bar at (16,2) is 2-wide — counters at x=16,17 are removed to keep that area clear.

## Roadmap

See `roadmap.md` for the full 6-phase feature roadmap. Phase 1 + Phase 2 complete. Phase 3 (economy & tipping) is next.
