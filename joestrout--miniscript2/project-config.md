# Claude Code Session Context for miniscrip2

## Project Overview
This is **MiniScript 2.0** - a dual-language (C#/C++) VM implementation using a transpiler-based architecture. Always start by reading [README.md](README.md) and the various .md documents in the `notes` folder for comprehensive project details.

**Key Architecture:**
- C# source code in `cs/` directory (primary development language)
- Transpiler converts C# → C++ (output in `generated/`)
- C/C++ core runtime in `cpp/core/` (memory management, Value types, etc.)
- Build system orchestrated by `tools/build.sh`

## Key Technical Implementations

### 1. Computed-Goto Dispatch System
**Location:** `cpp/core/dispatch_macros.h`, plus generated C++ VM code
- Uses X-macro pattern to automatically generate VM_LABEL_LIST from opcode enum
- Supports both computed-goto (GNU C extension) and switch-based dispatch
- Build system allows forcing dispatch method: `tools/build.sh cpp {auto|on|off}`
- **Performance benefit:** Direct jumps vs. switch statement overhead

### 2. Function Call/Return Mechanism
**Key insight:** Uses function indices instead of copying FuncDef objects for efficiency
- **CallInfo struct:** stores `ReturnPC`, `ReturnBase`, `ReturnFuncIndex` 
- **CALLF_iA_iBC:** saves caller context, switches to callee function by index
- **RETURN:** restores caller function using `functions[callInfo.ReturnFuncIndex]`
- **VM state:** tracks `currentFuncIndex` and `FuncDef& curFunc` (C++ uses reference to avoid copying)

### 3. Build System & Performance
**Main command:** `tools/build.sh {setup|cs|transpile|cpp|all|clean|test}`
- **Computed-goto control:** `tools/build.sh cpp {auto|on|off}` 
- **Auto-detection:** Uses GNU C extensions test, requires `-std=gnu++11` (not `-std=c++11`)
- **Optimization:** C++ builds with `-O3 -DNDEBUG` for production performance
- **Benchmark suite:** `tools/benchmark.sh` for performance comparison

## Important Files to Know

### Core Implementation
- **`cs/App.cs`** - Main host application
- **`cs/VM.cs`** - Main VM implementation (C# source)
- **`generated/VM.g.cpp`** - Transpiled VM (auto-generated from C#)
- **`cpp/core/dispatch_macros.h`** - Computed-goto macros and opcode definitions
- **`cs/Bytecode.cs`** - Opcode definitions and bytecode utilities

### Build & Test
- **`tools/build.sh`** - Main build orchestration script
  - `tools/build.sh cs` - build C# project
  - `tools/build.sh transpile` - generate C++ code from C# files
  - `tools/build.sh cpp` - build C++ project
- **`tools/benchmark.sh`** - Performance benchmarking suite
- **`cpp/Makefile`** - C++ build configuration with optimization flags
- **`examples/*.msa`** - Assembly test programs (tuned for benchmarking)

## Recent Major Fixes & Optimizations


## Common Commands

```bash
# Full build and test
tools/build.sh all && tools/build.sh test

# Performance benchmarking
tools/benchmark.sh                    # Compare C#, C++ (switch), C++ (goto)

# Test specific dispatch method
tools/build.sh cpp on   # Force computed-goto
tools/build.sh cpp off  # Force switch-based

# Run programs with different output modes
./build/cpp/miniscript2 examples/test_calls.msa           # Clean output
./build/cpp/miniscript2 -debug examples/test_calls.msa    # Verbose debug output
```

## Development Notes

- **Always edit C# files** in `cs/` directory, never generated C++ directly, unless trying to pin down some C++-only crash; then you may hack the generated C++ code to gain understanding.
- **Memory management:** Use GC_PROTECT for runtime Values, shared_ptr for host app data.
- **Coding standards:** See [CS_CODING_STANDARDS.md](notes/CS_CODING_STANDARDS.md).

In general, do not use the transpiler unless instructed otherwise, as it is token-expensive and is more the user's purview.  Do most edits in the C# code only, and notify the user when it's ready for transpilation and testing on the C++ side.  If you are instructed to transpile and test, use `tools/build.sh transpile` followed by - **Transpile after C# changes:** `tools/build.sh cpp`.

## Communication Style

Answer in a calm tone; avoid exclamation marks.  Be careful not to prematurely declare success; instead, plainly describe what you believe to be done.

Whenever you're not sure what is wanted, or how best to approach something, stop and ask for clarification.
