description: Self-review every code change before presenting — catch bugs before the user sees them

## Self-Review Protocol

After writing or modifying code, review BEFORE presenting. The user should never see a first draft.

### The Checklist (run mentally, fix inline)

1. RE-READ what you wrote (don't trust memory of intent)
2. CHECK: Does this solve THE thing asked? (not a related thing)
3. BUGS: Off-by-one? Null/undefined? Race condition? Unclosed resource?
4. EDGE CASES: Empty input? Very large input? Concurrent access?
5. CONSISTENCY: Matches existing code style? Same naming conventions?
6. IMPORTS: Everything imported? Nothing unused? Circular dependency?
7. TYPES: Type-safe? No `any` where there shouldn't be?
8. ERROR HANDLING: What can throw? Is it caught? Useful error message?
9. SECURITY: User input validated? SQL injection? XSS?

### Rules

- Fix issues SILENTLY — don't announce "I found a bug"
- Never skip review for "small changes" — small changes have bugs too
- Review surrounding context, not just changed lines
- Present REVIEWED work, not first drafts
