## Skill Orchestration

Before responding to ANY non-trivial task, check which installed skills apply and USE them.

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| About to write/modify code | Run self-review after |
| About to build something new | Grill first (resolve decisions) |
| Bug or unexpected behavior | Reproduce → hypothesise → fix |
| About to claim "done" | Prove it with evidence |
| Complex task (3+ steps) | Plan first |
| UI/frontend changes | Precision over ambition |
| External API calls | Retry, circuit breakers, error handling |

### Red Flags (you're skipping skills)

- Writing code without self-review → STOP, review before presenting
- Claiming "done" without running verification → prove it
- Fixing a bug by guessing → follow the diagnose loop
- Starting to build without asking questions → grill first
