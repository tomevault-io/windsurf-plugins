# Contribution Quality Standards

## Pre-Submit Checklist (ALL must pass)

1. **Guidelines Compliance**
   - CONTRIBUTING.md read and all rules followed
   - PR template filled completely (every section, no placeholders)
   - Branch naming matches repo convention
   - Commit messages match repo format exactly

2. **Code Quality**
   - Matches repo's exact code style (indentation, naming, imports)
   - Uses repo's existing abstractions and utilities
   - Proper error handling following repo patterns
   - No hardcoded values that should be configurable
   - No commented-out code unless repo does this

3. **Testing**
   - All existing tests pass
   - New tests added for new/changed behavior
   - Tests follow repo's testing patterns exactly
   - Edge cases covered (especially ones competing PRs missed)

4. **Tooling**
   - Linter passes with zero errors (repo's config, not defaults)
   - Formatter has been run (repo's formatter)
   - Type checker passes (if typed language)
   - Build succeeds

5. **Security**
   - No secrets, API keys, tokens in code
   - No personal file paths or system-specific references
   - No PII (personal identifiable information)
   - Dependencies are from official sources only

6. **Diff Quality**
   - Minimal diff -- only changes necessary for the fix/feature
   - No unrelated formatting changes
   - No whitespace-only changes outside the fix area
   - Clear and atomic -- one concern per commit

## Competitive Advantage Requirements

Before submitting, verify your PR is SUPERIOR to all competing PRs:
- Addresses issues that competing PRs ignored
- Includes tests that competing PRs skipped
- Follows conventions that competing PRs violated
- Has a more complete/detailed PR description
- Handles edge cases others missed

## PR Description Template (adapt to repo's template)

If the repo has no template, use this minimum:

```markdown
## Summary
{One paragraph explaining what this PR does and why}

## Changes
- {Bullet list of specific changes}

## Testing
- {How you tested this}
- {New tests added}

## Related Issues
Fixes #{issue_number}

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Breaking changes: None / {described}
```
