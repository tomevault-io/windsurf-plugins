## Grill Before Building

For any non-trivial new feature or system, resolve decision branches BEFORE implementation.

### Ask ONE question at a time, covering:

1. WHO is this for? (specific user, not "developers")
2. WHAT specific pain does this eliminate?
3. WHY doesn't a solution already exist?
4. WHAT'S the simplest version that would be useful?
5. WHAT could go wrong? (failure modes, edge cases, misuse)
6. HOW do you KNOW it works? (verification, not "I think")

### Depth Control

- Simple task (< 5 min): 2-3 questions
- Medium task (< 1 hour): 4-6 questions
- Complex task (> 1 hour): full tree

### Stop When

- Every branch has a clear answer
- Can state in ONE sentence: what, for whom, why it's better
- There's a concrete first step

### Anti-Pattern

"Let me just start and see where it goes" — this is what grilling prevents.
