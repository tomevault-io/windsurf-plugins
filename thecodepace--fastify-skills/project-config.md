# Copilot Instructions

## Documentation Sync Requirement

When adding, updating, or deleting a skill or any of its rules, **always keep the following files in sync** before considering the task done:

- **`README.md`** — Update the rules table or skill listing to reflect the change.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Update the rules table and any related guidance for the affected skill.
- **`skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`** — Update the skill's own definition, usage entries, and rules table as needed.

These updates are mandatory whenever:

- A new skill is created
- A new rule is added to an existing skill
- An existing rule is renamed, moved, or removed
- A skill is deleted

Do not consider the task complete until all three files accurately reflect the current state of the skill.

## Changeset Requirement

When completing work for a PR, **always ensure a changeset file exists** before considering the task done.

### Rules

1. **Check for existing changesets**: Before creating a new changeset, check if a changeset file already exists in the `.changeset/` directory (files ending in `.md`, excluding `README.md`). If a relevant changeset already covers the current changes, do not create a duplicate.
2. **Create a changeset if missing**: If no changeset exists for the current changes, create one by running:
   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```
3. **Choose the correct bump type**:
   - `patch` — bug fixes, documentation updates, minor tweaks
   - `minor` — new features, new skills, new rules
   - `major` — breaking changes
4. **Include affected packages**: If the change affects a workspace package (e.g., `@thecodepace/validate-rules`), list it in the changeset frontmatter instead of or in addition to the root package.
5. **Write a clear summary**: The changeset description should be a concise, human-readable summary of what changed and why.
