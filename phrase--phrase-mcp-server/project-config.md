# Agent Guidelines

Guidance for AI agents (Claude, Copilot, etc.) contributing to this repository.

## Commit Messages and PR Titles

All commit messages and PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This is enforced by CI on pull requests.

**Format:** `<type>: <description>`

Common types:
- `feat` — new feature or capability
- `fix` — bug fix
- `docs` — documentation changes only
- `chore` — maintenance, dependencies, config
- `refactor` — code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` — adding or updating tests

**Examples:**
```
feat: add readOnlyHint/destructiveHint annotations to all tools
fix: change download-target-file-async annotation to readOnlyHint
docs: add working examples section to README
chore: update Dependabot configuration
```

The PR title must also follow this format — the Semantic PR check will fail otherwise.

## Tool Names

Tool names must be at most **64 characters**. This is enforced by the Anthropic MCP Directory Policy and verified by the test suite.

## Tool Annotations

Every tool registered with `server.registerTool` must declare an `annotations` field in its config object with three required fields. This is required for MCP directory submission.

### Required annotation fields

- `title` — a short human-readable label. Must be prefixed with `[Strings]`, `[TMS]`, `[BQE]`, or `[Connectors]` to disambiguate between the Phrase products (e.g. both Strings and TMS have "Get Job", "List Projects", etc.).

- `readOnlyHint: true` — the tool does not modify operational user data. Use for:
  - `get_*` / `get-*` — fetch a single resource
  - `list_*` / `list-*` — list resources
  - `search_*` / `search-*` — search/query
  - Async polling helpers (`get_async_request`, `get_async_limits`, `list_pending_requests`)
  - Async download triggers and file retrieval (`download_target_file_async`, `download_target_file_by_async_request`, `create_locale_download`) — these initiate or retrieve exports but do not modify user data
  - Branch comparison (`compare_branch`, `get_branch_comparison`) — read-only diff computation

- `destructiveHint: true` — the tool creates, modifies, or deletes operational user data. Use for:
  - `create_*` / `create-*` — create resources (projects, jobs, keys, locales, etc.)
  - `update_*` / `update-*` — modify existing resources
  - `delete_*` — delete resources
  - `add_*` / `remove_*` — add or remove items from collections
  - `set_*` / `set-*` — set status or state on a resource
  - `merge_*` / `sync_*` — merge or sync branches (modifies translation data)
  - Workflow state transitions (`complete_*`, `start_*`, `reopen_*`, `lock_*`, `unlock_*`, `review_*`)

### Format

Place `annotations` directly after `description` in the config object, with `title` first:

```typescript
server.registerTool(
  "strings_get_job",
  {
    description: "Get a single job in a Phrase Strings project.",
    annotations: { title: "[Strings] Get Job", readOnlyHint: true },
    inputSchema: { ... },
  },
  async (params) => { ... },
);
```

## manifest.json

`manifest.json` defines the MCP server's metadata and the settings UI shown to users in MCP clients (e.g. Claude Desktop). It must be kept in sync with the server's product modules.

When adding a new product or token:

- Add a `<product>_token` entry to `user_config` (with `sensitive: true`, `required: false`)
- Add the corresponding `PHRASE_<PRODUCT>_TOKEN` env mapping in `server.mcp_config.env`
- Add the product key to the `enabled_products` default value and its description

When adding a new tool, no manifest changes are needed — tools are registered at runtime.

## Commands

- `npm test` — run full test suite (vitest)
- `npm run format` — auto-format with biome (run before committing)
- `npm run format:check` — check formatting without writing
- `npm run build` — build to `dist/`

Always run `npm run format` before committing. CI enforces formatting via biome.

### Key distinction

The deciding factor is whether the tool changes **operational user data** (translations, keys, projects, jobs, locales, glossaries, branches). Creating a transient server-side async job as part of a download flow does **not** count as modifying user data.
