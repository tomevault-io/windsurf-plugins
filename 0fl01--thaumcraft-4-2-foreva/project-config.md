# Agent Instructions — Thaumcraft 4.2.3.5 -> Forge 1.12.2 Port

This repository is a work-in-progress Java 8 Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 port of Thaumcraft 4.2.3.5 from Minecraft 1.7.10.

## Sources of truth

Read these files before changing code:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `build.gradle`
- `Dockerfile`

Use `thaumcraft_src/**` and `Thaumcraft-1.7.10-4.2.3.5.jar` as read-only original 1.7.10 reference material. Use `Thaumcraft-1.12.2-6.1.BETA26.jar` as a read-only Thaumcraft 6 (1.12.2) donor reference for display transforms, model conventions, and positioning values.

Asset origin: assets (textures, sounds, models, lang, shaders, etc.) for the port can be copied from `thaumcraft_src/assets/` into `src/main/resources/assets/thaumcraft/`. This is the source of truth for all ported assets — do not recreate assets from scratch when a working original exists in `thaumcraft_src/assets/`.

## Hard rules

- Do not edit `thaumcraft_src/**`.
- Do not edit `Thaumcraft-1.7.10-4.2.3.5.jar`.
- Do not edit `Thaumcraft-1.12.2-6.1.BETA26.jar`.
- Do not change public `thaumcraft.api.*` signatures unless there is no Forge 1.12.2-compatible alternative.
- Do not rename packages away from original Thaumcraft package boundaries.
- Do not change mod id, registry names, NBT keys, config keys, packet ids, GUI ids, or dimension ids silently.
- Do not upgrade Forge, Gradle, Java, Baubles, or bundled CodeChicken code unless the final report documents a hard blocker.
- Do not perform broad formatting-only cleanup.
- Do not make unrelated dependency changes.
- Do not claim parity based on compile success alone.
- Preserve existing behavior unless the current task explicitly authorizes a behavior change.

## Project stack

- Language: Java.
- Runtime target: Minecraft Forge 1.12.2.
- Java target: Java 8.
- Build system: Gradle wrapper with ForgeGradle 2.3.
- Forge version: `1.12.2-14.23.5.2847`.
- MCP mappings: `stable_39`.
- Hard dependency: Baubles via CurseMaven.
- Bundled library: `thaumcraft.codechicken.*`.
- Public addon API boundary: `thaumcraft.api.*`.

## Architecture boundaries

- `thaumcraft.api.*`: public addon API and API jar output. Keep stable.
- `thaumcraft.common.*`: server/common gameplay, registration, config, blocks, items, tiles, entities, worldgen, research, crafting, network.
- `thaumcraft.client.*`: client-only GUI, rendering, models, particles, shaders, keybinds, client event handlers.
- `thaumcraft.codechicken.*`: bundled CCL-style rendering/math helpers.
- `truetyper.*`: font rendering support.
- `src/main/resources/assets/thaumcraft/**`: assets, sounds, textures, models, recipes, lang, GUI resources.
- `thaumcraft_src/**`: read-only original reference.

## Commit policy

Use commit messages in this format (example):

```text
feat(sources): add bybit proof of reserves source

    Changes:
    - Add Bybit proof-of-reserves source using the official frontend reserve ratio JSON endpoint
    - Normalize target asset reserve ratio and missing-asset transparency candidates with source-local tests
    - Wire scheduled checks and refresh source docs
```

Each final report must include:

- commit hash if a commit was created;
- files included in the commit;
- validation commands run before the commit;
- whether runtime smoke validation was required, run, passed, failed, or skipped with a concrete reason;
- known limitations after the commit.

## Required workflow

1. Start with `git status --short`.
2. Read the relevant docs and code before editing.
3. For every gameplay-critical class, inspect the original 1.7.10 behavior first:
   - read matching source if present under `thaumcraft_src/**`;
   - or decompile with CFR from the original class.
4. Make small reversible changes.
5. Run focused validation after each checkpoint.
6. If validation fails, fix the failure before expanding scope.
7. Keep the final diff scoped and reviewable.
8. If code was changed, rebuild (`./scripts/dev.sh build`) as the final step to ensure the jar is up to date.
9. End with a final report listing exact commands and results.

## Development practices

- Keep original package names.
- Prefer original field/method names when practical for traceability.
- Prefer porting original behavior over inventing new behavior.
- Prefer existing project conventions over new abstractions.
- Use small helpers only when they remove real duplication across multiple callers.
- Do not introduce speculative abstraction.
- Do not use ad-hoc regex fixes for broken Java signatures.
- If a generated or transformed file has corrupted method signatures, stop and regenerate from the original source or manually port the file.

## Validation commands

Use Docker unless the local environment is already known to be Java 8 Forge-compatible.

Use the project wrapper instead of repeating long Docker commands. For routine validation, use one quiet entrypoint:

    ./scripts/dev.sh image
    ./scripts/dev.sh validate
    ./scripts/dev.sh validate --smoke
    ./scripts/dev.sh build
