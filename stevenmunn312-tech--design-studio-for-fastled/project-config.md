# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**See `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root for the full project overview, architecture,
and node-library reference.** That file is written for Claude Code but applies
equally here — keeping a single copy avoids the two docs silently drifting
apart (which is what happened to this file before it was replaced with this
pointer).

## Git workflow (public repository)

This is a public repository. Keep `main` releasable. **These instructions
override the global cortex / strict-git rules for this repository.**

- **Use plain `git`** (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`). Do **not**
  use `cortex git` here.
- **Direct commits and pushes to `main` are allowed only when the user
  explicitly requests that workflow.** Otherwise start from an up-to-date
  `main`, create a descriptive branch, and use a pull request. Codex branches
  use the `codex/` prefix; other contributors may use `fix/`, `feature/`,
  `docs/`, or another clear prefix.
- Keep branches focused on one change. Push the branch with upstream tracking
  and open a pull request into `main`; use a draft PR while work is still in
  progress unless the user explicitly asks for a ready-for-review PR.
- **Don't ask permission for routine git** — staging, committing, pushing, and
  pulling on the working branch are pre-approved. Opening the corresponding
  draft PR is also part of the normal workflow.
- **Commit message style:** a short, plain summary line is fine (e.g.
  `add Fade node`, `fix toolbar contrast`). No need to split into many tiny
  atomic commits. AI-assisted commits use the active tool's standard trailer:
  `Co-Authored-By: Codex <noreply@anthropic.com>` for Codex, or the equivalent
  Claude trailer when Claude Code contributes.
- **Do still pause and ask** before genuinely destructive or irreversible things:
  deleting branches, force-pushing, rewriting shared history, `git reset --hard`,
  or discarding the user's uncommitted work.
- Normal loop (unless a direct-`main` workflow was explicitly requested):
  update `main` → create branch → code → run checks → stage the intended files
  → commit → `git push -u origin <branch>` → open a draft PR. If `main` moves
  while the branch is in progress, fetch it and merge it into the branch; do
  not rewrite a shared branch without explicit approval.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev            # start Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build          # tsc -b type-check + Vite production build (also emits PWA service worker)
npm run lint           # ESLint (flat config in eslint.config.js)
npm run preview        # serve the production build locally
npm test               # vitest run (one-shot)
npm run test:watch     # vitest in watch mode
npm run test:coverage  # vitest with v8 coverage
```

Run a single test file or test by name:

```bash
npx vitest run src/state/__tests__/graphEvaluator.test.ts   # one file
npx vitest run -t "cycle"                                   # tests matching a name
```

The npm scripts route tools through `node --disable-warning=DEP0040` so normal project commands stay quiet around an upstream transitive `punycode` deprecation. Direct `npx vite` / `npx vitest` runs may still emit it.
