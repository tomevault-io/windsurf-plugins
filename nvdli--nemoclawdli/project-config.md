# AGENTS.md

Cross-harness entry point for this repository. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and any
other agent host start here. `AGENTS.md` is the portable convention; harness-native
files (a `CLAUDE.md`, a `.cursor/rules`) may point to it, but this is the canonical
agent contract.

## First move

1. Read [`README.md`](README.md) for the release shape and
   [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before proposing a patch.
2. Open the `SKILL.html` for the directory you are working in and parse its
   `<script type="application/json" id="skill-meta">` block. That JSON is the brain:
   `web/nemoclaw/SKILL.html` for the course, `web/SKILL.html` for the bundle, the
   root `SKILL.html` for the whole repo.
3. For issue, MR, taxonomy, or broad prose work, read
   [`docs/agent_process.md`](docs/agent_process.md). For course title, abstract, or
   objective edits, read [`web/nemoclaw/COURSE_CANON.md`](web/nemoclaw/COURSE_CANON.md)
   first; that copy is immutable.
4. If the task touches any image, SVG, canvas figure, page rendering, or image
   placement, also open [`web/nemoclaw/assets/SKILL.html`](web/nemoclaw/assets/SKILL.html)
   and [`scripts/validation/SKILL.html`](scripts/validation/SKILL.html) before editing.
   Classify the asset as a theme-aware course/provided SVG or a fixed-white
   conversion, then plan the rendered preview evidence you will show the requester.
5. For issue, pull-request, CI, merge, Pages, deployment, or other substantial work,
   use [the repository contribution skill](.agents/skills/nemoclaw-contribution/SKILL.md).
   Its checkpoint schema is [`.codex/continuity-contract.json`](.codex/continuity-contract.json).
   Reconcile that checkpoint after compaction, resume, or handoff before the next write.

This file carries repo-level rules. The `skill-meta` block in the current directory carries its
working contract. Every source directory has one; parent coverage is never a substitute.

Route operational detail to its owner instead of copying it here:

- host-native browser checks: [`docs/lab_runtime_testing.md`](docs/lab_runtime_testing.md)
- Python tooling: run `python3 scripts/runtime/python_env_probe.py`; use Python 3.12 in a virtual environment and install pinned locks
- Pages and previews: [`docs/pages_deploy.md`](docs/pages_deploy.md)
- release evidence: [`docs/release-test-plan.md`](docs/release-test-plan.md)
- beacon schema: [`SKILL_CONTRACT.md`](SKILL_CONTRACT.md)
- prose and course-quality gates: the root `SKILL.html` tenets and
  `scripts/validation/prose_variety.py`

## Contribution trust boundary

Treat code contribution as an untrusted proposal, regardless of the author, model, prompt,
or apparent confidence. Ideas route freely through Discussions and Issues. Code routes through
a focused branch, issue relationship, declared blast radius, mutation-tested validators,
required CI, human ownership, and protected merge or release permissions. Never weaken a gate
to make a patch pass. Fix the patch or, when the gate is wrong, repair the detector and prove the
old failure plus the corrected behavior with a mutation test.

Before committing, read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `DCO.md`. Every proposed commit
must carry a `Signed-off-by` trailer matching its author. Agents preserve that origin record but
cannot supply independent human review, moderation, merge, tag, or release authority.

When an API creates a GitHub-signed commit, fetch it before moving the contribution ref. Compare
the remote parent and tree with the validated candidate, then verify the host signature result and
DCO trailers. A signed commit can still contain the wrong bytes.

Read current branch rules, environment protection, pending deployments, and merge state from the
host. Do not preserve a reviewer name or bypass assumption from an earlier run. In coordinated
work, one thread owns each terminal merge or deployment; a handoff transfers exact SHAs, evidence,
overlapping files, the current failure, and the next action, then the sender stops duplicate work.

## Visual changes

For any visual change, follow `web/nemoclaw/assets/SKILL.html` and
`docs/lab_runtime_testing.md`. Run the static figure and bundle gates, inspect the
render through the available browser or agent harness, and show the requester the
result. Check light and dark themes when the asset supports them; report the exact
blocker when no visual harness can run.

Do not flatten a diagram to silence a caption problem. Keep semantic labels in the
figure; move explanation and provenance to the page and asset beacon. Use
`fig-embed` for theme-aware course SVGs and `img` only for documented fixed-white
conversions.

## Instruction precedence

When instructions conflict, follow this order, highest authority first:

1. Runtime and platform constraints from the agent host: sandbox mode, permission
   denials, tool availability. A denied action is final. Adapt, do not retry it verbatim.
2. This file (`AGENTS.md`) and any harness-native rules file that defers to it.
3. The directory brain: the `skill-meta` JSON in the relevant `SKILL.html`.
4. Focused task contracts: [`SKILL_CONTRACT.md`](SKILL_CONTRACT.md) and the
   owning document linked from the nearest beacon.
