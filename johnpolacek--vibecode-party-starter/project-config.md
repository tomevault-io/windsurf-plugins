 # shadcn Component Usage Guidelines

## Description
Prefer to use shadcn/ui components rather creating your own.

This rule documents our standard patterns for using shadcn/ui components and finding additional components built on top of shadcn.

## Installation & Setup

### Installing Components
Always use the shadcn CLI to add new components. This ensures proper installation with all dependencies:

```bash
# Install a new component
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>

# Examples:
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add alert-dialog
```

## Core Components

### Using shadcn/ui
We use shadcn/ui as our primary component library. All basic UI components should come from shadcn/ui first.

```typescript
// Example of importing and using shadcn components
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"

// Use them in your components
<Card>
  <Input placeholder="Enter text" />
  <Button>Submit</Button>
</Card>
```

## Extended Components

### Finding Additional Components
When we need more specialized components that aren't in the core shadcn/ui library:

1. First check the [awesome-shadcn-ui repository](mdc:https:/github.com/birobirobiro/awesome-shadcn-ui) for existing solutions
2. Look for components that:
   - Are well-maintained
   - Follow shadcn/ui patterns
   - Have TypeScript support
   - Are compatible with our tech stack

### Popular Extended Components
Some recommended extended components from the ecosystem:

- For date/time: `date-time-picker-shadcn` or `date-range-picker-for-shadcn`
- For forms: `auto-form` for zod-based form generation
- For search: `async-select` with debounce search
- For calendars: `big-calendar` or the basic calendar component

## Best Practices

1. **Installation & Updates**
   - Always use `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add` for installing components
   - Check documentation for the latest installation commands
   - Keep track of installed components in your project documentation

2. **Consistency First**
   - Always use shadcn/ui components when available
   - Keep styling consistent with shadcn/ui patterns
   - Use the same theming approach

3. **Custom Components**
   - When building custom components, follow shadcn/ui patterns
   - Use the same styling variables and classes
   - Maintain accessibility standards

4. **Extended Components**
   - Document any third-party components used
   - Test thoroughly before integration
   - Keep track of dependencies

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"

export function SearchForm() {
  return (
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <Input placeholder="Search..." />
      <Button>Search</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Extended Component Integration
```typescript
import { DatePicker } from "@/components/ui/date-picker"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export function DateSelection() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-2">
      <DatePicker />
      <Button>Confirm Date</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
