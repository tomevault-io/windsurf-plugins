## Architecture

This is a Next.js 15 project using the App Router architecture with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

### Tech Stack

- `/src/components/` - Reusable React components including shadcn/ui components
- `/src/lib/` - Utility functions and shared logic
- `/public/` - Static assets

### Component System
- Uses shadcn/ui with "new-york" style variant
- Components are configured via `components.json`
- Utility function `cn()` from `/src/lib/utils.ts` combines clsx and tailwind-merge
