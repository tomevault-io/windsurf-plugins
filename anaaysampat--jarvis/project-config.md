# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) working in this repository.

## What this is

This is JARVIS for Android, a voice assistant with phone and PC control. It began as a
fork of a Windows desktop app (a separate project, not in this repository): same Tauri 2
+ React shell, but the desktop's Python backend brain is **reimplemented in TypeScript and
runs inside the app** (no on-device Python). Maintainers may keep a gitignored
`reference/python-backend-spec/` copy of that Python backend as a porting blueprint;
never edit or import it, and don't assume it exists.

## Read these before assuming anything

- **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — how the four layers fit together and
  the rules that keep them from multiplying. The section numbers below refer to it.
- **[docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md)** — what is live-verified vs merely built vs open.
  **Check it before calling a feature unfinished or untested** — a lot of what looks
  half-done has been confirmed on a real device.
- **[docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)** — the security model (top half) and the audit
  history (bottom half). Inside the history, *Current status* says which of the 2026-07
  findings still stand.
- `docs/archive/` is history. Not maintained, and it loses to the two docs above.

## Commands

All commands run from `jarvis-studio-gui/`:

```
npm run dev              # Vite dev server (browser preview, no native plugins)
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint             # eslint .
npm run format           # prettier --write .
npm test                 # vitest run (all *.test.ts)
npx vitest run path/to/file.test.ts   # single test file
npm run build            # vite build (web bundle only)
```

Device build + install (`ANDROID_HOME`/`NDK_HOME` must already be set):

```
npx tauri android build --debug --apk --target aarch64     # real device
npx tauri android build --debug --apk --target x86_64      # emulator
adb install -r src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/debug/app-universal-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.jarvis.app/.MainActivity
```

**`tauri android dev` hangs after building — do not use it.** Use `tauri android build`
(it exits cleanly), then `adb install` + `adb shell am start` manually.

**Don't `adb shell am force-stop com.jarvis.app`** — Android then *disables* JARVIS's
accessibility service and every phone task fails until the user re-enables it. Restart
with `adb install -r` or `am start` instead.

The emulator has no real mic and its software-GPU SystemUI ANRs under load (not an app
bug) — it's boot/UI-only. Audio, wake word, accessibility control and remote-PC pairing
all require a real device.

## The rules that actually matter

These are the ones that get broken by well-meaning changes. Details in ARCHITECTURE.md.

1. **One dispatch chokepoint.** `tools/registry.ts` advertises; `tools/dispatch.ts`
   executes. Native function calls and text `[ACTION]` tags both lower to one action-spec
   and hit one dispatcher. **Never add a second execution path.** (§3)

2. **One native bridge.** Kotlin `PhonePlugin.kt` → Rust `#[command]` → `invoke(
   "plugin:phone|<name>")` in `platform/index.ts`. New capability = a new command here,
   not a new path. Keep the three name spellings in sync (snake_case JS/Rust, camelCase
   Kotlin, plus `build.rs` `COMMANDS` and `mobile.rs`'s `run_mobile_plugin` strings). (§5)

3. **Never claim a tool succeeded unless its actual return value says so.** Carried over
   from the Python brain; enforced throughout dispatch, the operator loop and remote task
   resolution. This is the app's core trustworthiness property, not a nicety.

4. **Don't use the Tauri event/Channel bridge for native→JS signals.** It silently drops
   callbacks during WebView startup reloads on this device (confirmed live). Poll a
   monotonic `seq` counter over `invoke()` instead — that's what wake word
   (`poll_wake_word`, 140 ms) and the STOP overlay (`poll_stop_overlay`, 250 ms) do. (§5)

5. **Desktop-only Rust goes behind `#[cfg(desktop)]`**, not a runtime `IS_MOBILE` check.
   `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` gates the tray, global hotkey and Python sidecar this way. The
   React side *does* use runtime `IS_MOBILE` branches, since one component tree renders on
   both platforms. (§8)

6. **Don't move the wake-word listener into a React effect.** It's a module-level
   singleton (`syncWakeWord()`, keyed by a config-hash signature) on purpose — StrictMode's
   mount→unmount→remount was killing the engine mid-boot. (§8)

7. **`quota.ts` currently LEADS the desktop app's quota logic.** They're meant to mirror
   each other, but the per-minute vs per-day bench windows (2026-09-23) and the capped
   transient ladder (20s → 2m → 10m, 2026-09-25) exist only on the phone so far. Don't
   assume the desktop behaves the same. (§2)

8. **"Memory" is ambiguous here — check which store.** Keyword recall
   (`memory/store.ts`), semantic/embedding recall (`memory/vectorStore.ts`), and verified
   procedural workflows (`memory/proceduralLearning.ts`) are three separate systems. (§7)

9. **Speech input stays in the WebView; speech output is native.** `platform/stt.ts`
   records with `MediaRecorder` → Groq Whisper (Vertex Chirp fallback) — don't add a
