# HALLMARK - Citation Hallucination Detection Benchmark

## Project Overview
HALLMARK (HALLucination benchMARK) evaluates citation verification tools on detecting hallucinated references in academic papers.

## Development Setup
- Package manager: `uv`
- Run tests: `uv run python -m pytest`
- Lint: `uv run ruff check hallmark/ tests/`
- Format: `uv run ruff format hallmark/ tests/`
- Type check: `uv run mypy hallmark/`
- Pre-commit hooks: ruff, ruff-format, mypy, trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer

## Commit Rules

**CRITICAL: When a commit fails due to pre-commit hooks (mypy, ruff, etc.), you MUST immediately fix and retry — NEVER stop, report the failure, or ask the user:**
1. Read and understand every error in the output
2. Fix ALL errors — not just some of them
3. Re-run the failing check manually (e.g. `uv run mypy --ignore-missing-imports hallmark/`) to confirm the fix
4. Re-stage any files modified by hooks or by your fixes (`git add <file>`)
5. Only then attempt the commit again
6. Repeat this cycle until the commit succeeds — do NOT stop or ask the user while errors remain

This is a single atomic workflow. The commit is not done until all hooks pass and git confirms the commit hash. Never leave a commit in a failed state. Never skip or ignore pre-commit hook errors.

## Pre-commit Hook Pitfalls

- **ruff-format auto-modifies files**: The hook reformats files in-place, causing the commit to fail. The fix is already applied — just re-stage the modified file and commit again.
- **mypy vs local runs**: The pre-commit hook runs `mypy hallmark/` with `--ignore-missing-imports`. To match locally: `uv run mypy --ignore-missing-imports hallmark/`
- **Type narrowing**: List comprehensions filtering `None` don't narrow types for mypy. Use the walrus operator: `[s for ... if (s := val) is not None]`
- **`callable` vs `Callable`**: Lowercase `callable` is not a valid type annotation. Use `Callable[[ArgType], ReturnType]` from `collections.abc`.
- **Import + annotation edits**: When adding an import and updating the annotation that uses it, edit the annotation first — otherwise ruff may auto-remove the "unused" import before you get to update the annotation.
- **CI vs pre-commit scope**: Pre-commit hooks only check staged files; CI runs `ruff format --check .` on the entire repo. Always run `uv run ruff format .` before pushing to catch files not covered by the hook.

## Hallucination Taxonomy (11 main + 3 stress-test)
- **Tier 1 (Easy, 4 types):** fabricated_doi, nonexistent_venue, placeholder_authors, future_date
- **Tier 2 (Medium, 5 types):** chimeric_title, wrong_venue, author_mismatch (enum value: `"swapped_authors"`), preprint_as_published, hybrid_fabrication
- **Tier 3 (Hard, 2 main + 1 stress-test):** near_miss_title, plausible_fabrication; arxiv_version_mismatch (stress-test)
- `AUTHOR_MISMATCH` enum member keeps value `"swapped_authors"` for backward compatibility with data files
- `hybrid_fabrication`: real DOI + fabricated metadata — DOI resolves but authors/title don't match the DOI target
- Three theoretically-motivated types (merged_citation, partial_author_list, arxiv_version_mismatch) appear in all splits; `stress_test.jsonl` provides additional depth

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary:** Detection Rate, FPR, F1-Hallucination, Tier-weighted F1, ECE
- **Diagnostic:** detect@k, source_stratified_metrics(), subtest_accuracy_table()
- ECE is computed in `evaluate()` and stored in `EvaluationResult.ece`

## Project Structure
- `hallmark/` — main package (baselines, dataset, evaluation, contribution)
- `hallmark/baselines/registry.py` — central baseline registry (discovery, availability, dispatch)
- `hallmark/evaluation/ranking.py` — ONEBench-inspired Plackett-Luce ranking
- `scripts/` — orchestrator scripts (run_all_baselines.py, run_evaluation.py, generate_reference_results.py, generate_new_instances.py)
- `tests/` — pytest test suite (562 tests)
- `data/v1.0/` — benchmark data splits (dev: 1,119, test: 831, hidden: 453, stress: 122; total 2,525 entries)
- `data/v1.0/baseline_results/` — pre-computed reference results for rate-limited baselines
- `.github/workflows/` — CI (tests.yml, baselines.yml)

## Baseline Wrapper Architecture

Baseline wrappers have two distinct layers — keep them clearly separated:

### Tool-level fixes (belong upstream in the external tool)
Changes that fix genuine bugs or missing features in the external tool's wrapper mapping.
Any user of the tool would benefit from these.
- **bibtexupdater**: `year_mismatch`/`venue_mismatch` → HALLUCINATED (was incorrectly suppressed)
- **harc**: false positive filtering for transient API errors, confidence recalibration
- Upstream improvement plan: `~/Documents/GitHub/bibtexupdater/.claude/plans/hallmark-improvements.md`

### Pre-screening layer (benchmark-side addition)
`hallmark/baselines/prescreening.py` adds lightweight local checks (DOI resolution, year bounds, author heuristics) that run before external tools. This is a HALLMARK wrapper addition, not an improvement to the external tools themselves.
- Pre-screening results should be reported transparently (reason strings include `[Pre-screening override]`)
