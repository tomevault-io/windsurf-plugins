# For agents and automated pipelines

If you are an AI agent (or CI script) handed this repo and asked to "make an EPUB
from the scans in `<folder>`", this is the canonical non-interactive path.

## 1. Verify prerequisites you cannot set up yourself

Run `scan2ebook doctor --json` and require every `essential: true` check to
report `ok: true` before spending anything:

| Check | Essential | If missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python` (≥ 3.10) | yes | install Python 3.10+ |
| `pandoc` | yes | `brew install pandoc` (or apt) |
| `openrouter_key` | yes | the user must provide an OpenRouter API key + credit |
| `rclone` | no | only for `--upload` |
| `heic_convert` | no | only for HEIC/HEIF input (one of sips/magick/heif-convert/pillow-heif) |
| `pdf_render` | no | only for PDF input (one of pdftoppm/magick/sips — poppler or imagemagick+ghostscript) |

The API key, account credit, and the key's spend cap require signup, payment, and
dashboard access — **surface these to the user; do not work around them.**

## 2. Inject the key without an editor

Write one `KEY=VALUE` line (no `export`, no quotes) to `.env` at the repo root, or
export it. A shell `export` wins over `.env`:

```bash
printf 'OPENROUTER_API_KEY=%s\n' "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY" > .env
```

## 3. Run the cost-gated happy path

```bash
.venv/bin/scan2ebook doctor --json                  # gate: every essential check ok
.venv/bin/scan2ebook init <slug> --from <folder>    # register the book
.venv/bin/scan2ebook all <slug> --dry-run --json    # estimate cost, no API spend
.venv/bin/scan2ebook all <slug> --smoke --yes --json # OCR 10, then full run, no prompt
# result: ~/scan2ebook/<slug>/dist/<slug>.epub  (also in the JSON `paths` field)
```

`--json` prints one summary object to stdout (human logs go to stderr);
`--json-lines` streams NDJSON events. The summary carries `status`
(`ok`/`partial`/`error`/`smoke`/`dry-run`), `pages`, `cost_usd`, and `paths`.
**Exit codes:** `0` success, `1` partial/failed pages, `2` user error. Runs are
resumable, so retrying after a crash or a raised credit cap is cheap and safe.

After the build, validate the artifact (don't trust exit codes alone):

```bash
.venv/bin/scan2ebook verify ~/scan2ebook/<slug> --json   # OK / TINY / BADZIP / MISSING
```

`verify` accepts a single `.epub`, one book-home, or a directory of book-homes
(rc 0 only when every EPUB is OK). Real total spend per book is the sum of the
`work/cost.json` ledger — the last `cost~$` log line is per-pass, not a total.

## 4. Manga (image pages → EPUB3 fixed-layout, no OCR)

Different pipeline, different command. Scanned manga/comic pages become a
fixed-layout RTL EPUB3 — **no OCR, no pandoc, no OpenRouter key by default**
(so `doctor`/`.env` above are not required for the default offline build):

```bash
.venv/bin/scan2ebook manga <slug> --from <folder> \
  --author "Author Name" --series "Series Name" --series-index 1
# result: ~/scan2ebook/<slug>/dist/<slug>.epub
```

`--from` accepts an image folder, a `.mobi/.azw3`, a `.cbz/.cbr/.zip`, or a
Drive file/folder link. Notes for unattended runs:

- **Always pass `--author`** — there is no auto-author. Omitting it ships the
  EPUB with "Unknown Author". (Title can be auto-derived: `--series` +
  `--series-index` with no `--title` → `dc:title` = "Series NN".)
- **Cover:** default is page 1. Scans often prepend a banner, so the real cover
  is a later page — pass `--cover-index N` (1-based, on the min-px-filtered
  list) if you know it. `--auto-cover` detects it via a vision LLM but **needs
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`** and costs ~$0.01/book; on null/error it falls back to
  page 1 and the build still succeeds (rc 0). Manual `--cover-index` overrides
  `--auto-cover`.
- `--min-px 400` drops thumbnails; `--no-rtl` for left-to-right. This command
  has **no `--json` mode** — parse the final `✓ … dist/<slug>.epub` stderr line.
