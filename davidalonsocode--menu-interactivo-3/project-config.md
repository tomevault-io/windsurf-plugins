﻿# Roo Code & Antigravity Skills Integration

This workspace is equipped with production-grade engineering skills located in .agents/skills/.

## How to Use Skills

When asked to perform engineering tasks, read the corresponding SKILL.md file from .agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md and strictly follow its instructions:

| Phase / Intent | Skill Location | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clarify Requirements** | .agents/skills/interview-me/SKILL.md | Interview 1-by-1 until ~95% confidence on intent |
| **Refine Ideas** | .agents/skills/idea-refine/SKILL.md | Divergent/convergent thinking and trade-off analysis |
| **Technical Specs** | .agents/skills/spec-driven-development/SKILL.md | Requirements, API contracts & acceptance criteria before code |
| **Task Planning** | .agents/skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md | Ordered, dependency-free atomic tasks |
| **Building Slices** | .agents/skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md | Thin vertical slices, test each before moving next |
| **Frontend & UI** | .agents/skills/frontend-ui-engineering/SKILL.md | Accessible (WCAG), responsive, clean UI engineering |
| **Supabase / Postgres** | .agents/skills/supabase-engineering/SKILL.md | Strict RLS, SQL migrations, TS type generation |
| **API Contracts** | .agents/skills/api-and-interface-design/SKILL.md | Stable interfaces & module boundaries |
| **TDD / Testing** | .agents/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md | Red -> Green -> Refactor workflow |
| **Browser Testing** | .agents/skills/browser-testing-with-devtools/SKILL.md | Runtime testing & console/DOM inspection |
| **Bug Diagnosis** | .agents/skills/debugging-and-error-recovery/SKILL.md | Systematic root-cause debugging |
| **Code Review** | .agents/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md | Multi-axis code review and quality gates |
| **Simplification** | .agents/skills/code-simplification/SKILL.md | Reduce unnecessary complexity preserving behavior |
| **Security Hardening** | .agents/skills/security-and-hardening/SKILL.md | OWASP prevention, input validation |
| **Performance** | .agents/skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md | Core Web Vitals, query and render optimization |
| **Pre-Launch / Ship** | .agents/skills/shipping-and-launch/SKILL.md | Pre-launch checklist & rollback plan |

## Mandatory Rules

1. **Read the relevant skill**: Always inspect .agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md before implementing.
2. **Never guess without context**: Surface assumptions clearly; ask if requirements are ambiguous.
3. **Verify with evidence**: Run tests, builds, or lint checks before declaring work done.
4. **Scope discipline**: Touch only the relevant code, do not overcomplicate or delete comments.
