# Nocturne agent guide

Nocturne is a quiet, local-first bedside sound instrument. Preserve one shared
codebase, no accounts/cloud/analytics, honest platform limits, local-only
scenes, and the public quarantine boundary.

## Current architecture

- Profiles: `profiles/nocturne.json` and `profiles/nocturne-pi.json`.
- Packaged default: `nocturne_profile.json`; runtime override:
  `.venv/bin/python run_nocturne.py --profile ...` (or
  `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` on Windows).
- Deployment mode (server-only versus local display) is not a profile.
- Public source belongs on `main`; detailed release evidence belongs on the
  version-matched `evidence` branch/package.

## Before reporting completion

Run, at minimum:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/sync_release_data.py --check
.venv/bin/python check_audio_contract.py --source
node scripts/release-audit.mjs --source
.venv/bin/python scripts/runtime_smoke.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/profile_smoke.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/installer_smoke.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/path_safety_smoke.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/release_builder_smoke.py
.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q .
```

Before claiming a UI release complete, also run both browser profiles when
Playwright and Chromium are available:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/browser_smoke.py --profile nocturne
.venv/bin/python scripts/browser_smoke.py --profile nocturne-pi
```

Record an unavailable browser as `NOT RUN`, never as `PASS`. Browser automation
does not substitute for real Windows, Raspberry Pi, screen-reader,
lock/background, listening-comfort, or overnight evidence.

Do not claim Raspberry Pi 3, lock-screen, screen-reader, listening comfort, or
overnight behavior was verified unless real target evidence is supplied.
