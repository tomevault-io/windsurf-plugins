# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a semi-professional personal website built with Astro and configured for GitHub Pages deployment at `https://pieberrykinnie.github.io`. The site features:

- **Bio and Contact** - Homepage with personal information and contact details
- **Experience Section** - Background, skills, with sub-pages for Education, Work, and Extracurricular activities
- **Research** - Summary of research interests and activities
- **Projects** - Filterable project cards with detailed modals showing images, links, and descriptions
- **Coursework** - Course listings with optional writeup links to blog posts
- **Blog** - Personal blog posts and course-related writeups

**Technology Stack:**
- **Astro 5.14.1** - Static site generator with component-based architecture
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.11** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **TypeScript** - Strict configuration extends `astro/tsconfigs/strict`
- **pnpm** - Package manager (version 10.11.0)

## Development Commands

All commands use pnpm as the package manager:

```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies
pnpm dev             # Start development server at localhost:4321
pnpm build           # Build production site to ./dist/
pnpm preview         # Preview build locally before deploying
pnpm astro ...       # Run Astro CLI commands (e.g., astro add, astro check)
```

### Site Structure & Routing
- **/** - Homepage with bio and contact information
- **/experience** - Experience overview with links to sub-pages
  - **/experience/education** - Educational background
  - **/experience/work** - Work experience 
  - **/experience/extracurricular** - Extracurricular activities
- **/research** - Research interests and activities
- **/projects** - Project showcase with filtering and modal details
- **/coursework** - Course listings with optional blog writeup links
- **/blog** - Blog posts and writeups

### Content Management
- **Projects**: JSON files in `src/content/projects/` with schema for title, category, description, technologies, GitHub/deployed URLs, images
- **Courses**: JSON files in `src/content/courses/` with course details and optional writeup links
- **Blog Posts**: Markdown files in `src/content/blog/` with frontmatter for metadata

### Styling Architecture
- **Global CSS**: `src/styles/global.css` imports Tailwind CSS
- **Component Styles**: Scoped `<style>` blocks in `.astro` components
- **Tailwind Integration**: Configured via Vite plugin in `astro.config.mjs`

### Astro Configuration
- Site URL configured for GitHub Pages deployment
- Tailwind CSS integrated via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
- TypeScript strict mode enabled

## Key Development Notes

- Uses Astro's component-based architecture with `.astro` files
- File-based routing: files in `src/pages/` become site routes
- Content stored as JSON (projects/courses) and Markdown (blog) in `src/content/`
- Project cards should include filtering/categorization functionality
- Project modals should display images, descriptions, and links
- Course pages should link to related blog writeups
- Static assets are processed and optimized by Astro
- GitHub Pages deployment configured via `site` setting in astro.config.mjs
