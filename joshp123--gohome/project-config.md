# GoHome Agent Guide

## Project Intent

Nix‑native home automation. Replace Home Assistant with a deterministic Go system.

## North Star

- If it compiles, it works
- Nix is source of truth
- ZFC: AI reasons, code executes
- Test in prod, rollback via Nix
- Sane, opinionated defaults; batteries included

## Non‑negotiables

- No runtime config editing
- Protobuf/gRPC is the product
- Plugins own proto, metrics, dashboards, and AGENTS.md
- No UI beyond Grafana
- Secrets via agenix only

## In-flight (living log)

- Growatt high-res power: blocked on ShinePhone app auth; need working login/session cookie. Next: add private client to pull minute-level power and import to VM; rewire Grafana power panel to new series.
- Growatt public backfill: daily energy imported 2025-01-01→2026-01-10; weekly/monthly/yearly present. All backfill jobs stopped after rate limits; restart only with new plan.

## Security Rules

- NEVER commit secrets, tokens, keys, or personal data
- Use placeholder identities (Mr‑Robot style)
- Keep private repo references out of public docs

## Commit Policy

- One logical change per commit
- Format: `🤖 codex: short description (issue-id)`
- No `git add .` / `git add -A`
- Run full test suite before committing (if none, state “not run”)
- Push directly to `main`

## RFC / ADR Policy

- RFCs in `docs/rfc/` using `RFC_TEMPLATE.md`
- ADRs in `docs/adr/` (short, dated)
- Update only when decisions change

## Docs to Read First

- `PHILOSOPHY.md`
- `docs/rfc/INDEX.md`

## Dev Tooling

Use `devenv` to provision local build tools (Go + protoc plugins).

```
devenv shell
bash tools/generate.sh
```

## nix-openclaw Plugin

GoHome exposes an idiomatic nix-openclaw plugin via `openclawPlugin` in `flake.nix`.

- Plugin name: `gohome`
- Skills: `skills/gohome`
- Packages: `gohome` (includes `gohome-cli` on PATH)
- Required env: none (optional `GOHOME_GRPC_ADDR` supported by `gohome-cli`)

## Smoke Test (remote)

Default host: `gohome` (matches `flake.nix` nixosConfigurations). Always deploy over Tailscale, not the public IP.

Command:
`scripts/deploy.sh gohome`

Notes:
- Runs `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` on the host and rolls back on failure.
- Uses `curl http://localhost:8080/health` as the health check.
- SSH access must be configured for the target host. The default NixOS host config (`nix/hosts/gohome.nix`) only sets root SSH keys, so use `root@gohome` or configure your local SSH config to map `gohome` to the correct user/host (Tailscale).
- The deploy script maps `gohome` to a Tailscale IP (currently `root@100.108.102.95`). Update `scripts/deploy.sh` if the Tailscale IP changes.
- `infra/tofu/terraform.tfstate` contains the public IP (`outputs.server_ip.value`) for provisioning history only; do not use it for deploys.
- The current host uses `/root/gohome` (not `/etc/nixos`) and `/root/nix-secrets`. The deploy script detects this and uses `--override-input secrets /root/nix-secrets`.
- GoHome binaries should be on PATH on the host (via `environment.systemPackages`).
  - If PATH is missing, use systemd to locate them:
    - `ssh root@gohome 'systemctl cat gohome | grep -n ExecStart'`
    - Run the CLI via the ExecStart path, e.g. `ssh root@gohome '<execstart> roborock probe --methods ...'`.

## Bootstrap + Self-Bootstrapping

- The host is expected to have a working checkout at `/root/gohome` (git clone of this repo).
  - `scripts/deploy.sh` runs `git pull` only if `/root/gohome/.git` exists.
  - If the host has a tarball or bare tree, the deploy script clones to `/root/gohome-src` and uses that for builds.
- Bootstrap secrets are stored in the secrets repo and materialized by agenix on the host.
  - Roborock bootstrap JSON is generated locally, encrypted into `gohome-roborock-bootstrap.age`,
    and surfaced to GoHome via `services.gohome.plugins.roborock.bootstrapFile`.
- The deploy script should be the only path to update the remote host; it rebuilds and rolls back on failure.
