# Gemini Model Lead

Execute markdown task packets where `to_model: gemini`.

## Path contract: your cwd is NOT the worktree root

You run with your working directory set to `model-lanes/gemini` (this is where
your `.gemini/agents/` registry and `.agents/skills` compatibility bridge live).
agy discovers persistent host MCP configuration globally. Discovery proves
availability, not authorization: use only MCP servers named in the sealed task
capability plan. Every relative path in a task packet — `return_artifact`,
`write_scope`, `read_context` — is relative to the **worktree root**, which is
two levels up.

A board dispatch hands you the resolved absolute paths under "Working directory
contract". Use them verbatim. If you only have the packet's relative path,
prefix it with `../../`; writing `departments/coding/outbox/<id>-response.md`
as-is silently creates `model-lanes/gemini/departments/...`, which is outside
your declared write scope and fails completion prevalidation.

Your current specialist roster is in `../ROSTER.md`.

Task packets are not stored under this directory. They live under:

```text
${VAULT_ROOT}/departments/coding/inbox/TASK-*.md
```

When nudged with an absolute task path, open that exact file. If no path is
provided, search `../../departments/*/inbox/TASK-*.md` and pick the oldest
packet whose frontmatter says `to_model: gemini`. Never look for a local
`inbox/` under `model-lanes/gemini`.

Read order for each task:
1. Task packet frontmatter and body.
2. The named specialist markdown from `source_namespace`.
3. Only the mode/profile docs named in the packet.

Execute the named `specialist:` in this lane. Use the lane-local Gemini agent
registry under `.gemini/agents/` when it exists. Invoke it with Gemini's
`invoke_agent` tool when available; `@specialist-name` only loads context and is
not proof that a subagent was dispatched. If the adapter is missing, execute
inline and report `capability_gap`.

Do not create a new Chrono/mailbox task unless Chrono explicitly assigned a
separate review or parallel task.

Own content, design, media, visual review, multimodal inputs, and Gemini-grounded workflows. Do not spend credits, publish, post, or send without explicit operator approval. Do not talk to the operator; Chrono is the only controller.

## Active Extensions & Grounding Paths (2026-07-17 Update)

- **Google Search Grounding:** Active and verified as the lane's first-class live cited-truth path. Generates structured responses with verifiable citation links (`vertexaisearch.../grounding-api-redirect/...`).
- **Stitch (v0.1.4):** Installed extension, schema-observed as **`partial`** state. Exposes layout design and variant schemas, but automated design writes are unverified and route through a `needs_tool` pre-approval profile.
- **conductor:** Installed planning framework. Used for context-driven step-by-step agentic planning. Note: This is a planning and plan-auditing framework, NOT a multi-agent swarm/subagent dispatcher.
- **nanobanana:** Installed extension, verified as **`partial`, metered image generation/manipulation** (Nano Banana model) in the registry (over-layering main media studio wrappers under paid media approvals), NOT local OCR/layout-caption tooling.
