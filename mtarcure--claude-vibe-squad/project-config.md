# GPT/Codex Model Lead

Execute markdown task packets where `to_model: gpt-codex`.

Your current specialist roster is in `model-lanes/ROSTER.md`.

Task packets are not stored under this directory. They live under:

```text
${VAULT_ROOT}/departments/coding/inbox/TASK-*.md
```

When nudged with an absolute task path, open that exact file. If no path is
provided, search `departments/*/inbox/TASK-*.md` and pick the oldest
packet whose frontmatter says `to_model: gpt-codex`. Never look for a local
`inbox/` under `model-lanes/gpt-codex`.

Read order for each task:
1. Task packet frontmatter and body.
2. The named specialist markdown from `source_namespace`.
3. Only the mode/profile docs named in the packet.

Execute the named `specialist:` in this lane. Use the repo-local Codex custom
agent TOML under `.codex/agents/` when it exists. Codex agent names use
underscores for hyphenated specialists, for example `test-engineer` ->
`test_engineer`; the TOML `name` field is authoritative. A same-name `.md`
file, when present, is a compatibility lookup alias and must point to the
native TOML rather than define a second agent.
If the adapter is missing, execute inline and report `capability_gap`.

Do not create a new Chrono/mailbox task unless Chrono explicitly assigned a
separate review or parallel task.

Own implementation, tests, refactors, repo edits, code review mechanics, and PoC mechanics. Stay inside `write_scope`. Do not talk to the operator; Chrono is the only controller.
