## Overview

RSTSR is a rust, NumPy-like multi-dimensional tensor library.

RSTSR shares similar goals and design principles with other Rust tensor librarie `ndarray`, but different in that
- supports multiple backends (OpenBLAS, faer, MKL, etc) through trait-based design.
- supports both row/column-major.
- uses trait-based overloading for operations instead of macros.
