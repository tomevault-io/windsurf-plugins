# GTM Engineer Skills

Skills for go-to-market engineering. Use them on real customers, improve them based on what works.

## Workflow

1. **`research-brand`** — URL → `brand_dna.md`
2. **`research-keywords`** — SEO keywords (1-3 words), validated with Ahrefs/Semrush
3. **`reddit-opportunity-research`** — Reddit pain points, target subreddits, and promotable discussion opportunities from Brand DNA
4. **`geo-content-research`** — GEO prompt targets (Buy/Solve/Learn) for AI citations
5. **`write-seo-geo-content`** — Product-led SEO and GEO content pages
6. **`build-resource-pages`** — Build frontend resource pages from existing content
7. **`audit-content`** — Verify URLs, statistics, citations, and company claims before publishing
8. **`create-geo-charts`** — Data visualizations with AI-readable text layers
9. **`audit-website-aeo`** — Crawl a live website, run 16 deterministic checks + a 6-dimension evaluation, produce a scored A-F audit report
10. **`improve-aeo-geo`** — Website AEO/GEO audits and fixes
11. **`build-backlinks`** — Find free backlink/mention opportunities across HN, Quora, GitHub, directories. Outputs an actionable plan with ready-to-post drafts

## `workspace/` Directory

Gitignored. Customer work goes here: `workspace/<customer-name>/`. Store `brand_dna.md`, `keyword_research.md`, `geo_prompt_targets.md` per customer. Feed real results back into skill improvements.

## Skill Structure

```
<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md      ← Agent prompt
├── README.md     ← Install instructions
└── examples/     ← Optional
```

## Key Rules

- SEO keywords: 1-3 words. Longer phrases are blog topics.
- GEO prompts: full questions (5-15+ words). Not SEO keywords.
- Reddit opportunity output: ranked subreddit + thread patterns, not generic channel advice.
- No fabricated data — every stat needs a source.
- Skills improve by doing real customer work, not theorizing.

## Platform Note

- `reddit-opportunity-research` is intended for Codex workflows in this repo. ChatGPT already has native Reddit access in-product; Claude generally does not.
