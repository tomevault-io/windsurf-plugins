# CodeDNA v0.8 — In-Source Communication Protocol
# Annotate your project: pip install git+https://github.com/Larens94/codedna.git && codedna init ./

This project uses CodeDNA. Every Python file begins with a module docstring.

On SESSION START:
- Read `.codedna` at repo root — project map, last 3-5 agent_sessions entries
- CodeDNA is additive — it complements Cline's native memory, not replaces it

On EDIT:
- Re-read `rules:` before writing any logic — never violate these constraints
- Read `Rules:` in function docstrings before writing logic there
- Check `used_by:` after changes and update callers if needed
- If you discover a constraint or fix a bug, add it to `rules:` for the next agent
- Append a new `agent:` line to the module docstring after editing. Keep only the last 5 entries — drop the oldest if adding a 6th. Full history is in git and `.codedna`.

On CREATE:
- Write module docstring before any imports (exports/used_by/rules/agent)
- Every public function **must** have a `Rules:` docstring
- Use semantic naming: `list_dict_users_from_db = get_users()`

## Writing good `rules:`

`rules:` must be **specific and actionable** — never vague.

```python
# ✅ Good rules:
rules:   get_invoices() returns ALL tenants — caller MUST filter is_suspended() before aggregating
rules:   amount is in cents not euros — divide by 100 before display
rules:   soft-delete via deleted_at — NEVER use DELETE, always SET deleted_at = NOW()

# ❌ Bad rules:
rules:   handle errors gracefully
rules:   follow best practices
rules:   none  ← when there ARE constraints but nobody wrote them
```

Update rules: every time you discover a constraint, fix a bug, or notice a non-obvious behavior.

## Writing critical functions

Every public function **must** have a `Rules:` docstring:

```python
def my_function(arg: type) -> return_type:
    """Short description.

    Rules:   What the agent MUST or MUST NOT do here.
    message: model-id | YYYY-MM-DD | observation for next agent
    """
```

## Inline annotations on complex logic

When writing or editing code blocks with non-obvious logic, add a `# Rules:` or `# message:` comment above the block:

```python
# Rules: skip cancelled orders — status=4 means cancelled in legacy DB
active = [o for o in orders if o.status != 4]

# message: exchange rate uses daily rate, not real-time
amount = order.amount * get_exchange_rate(order.currency)
```

When to add: business-rule conditionals, loops with filtering, algorithm steps where order matters, edge cases.
When NOT to add: simple getters, obvious control flow, standard library usage.

`message:` field (v0.8) — use for open observations not yet certain enough to become `rules:`:
- In module docstring: `message: "<hypothesis or note for the next agent>"`
- In function docstring: `message: <model-id> | <date> | <open observation>`
- Lifecycle: promote to `rules:` or dismiss. Always append-only — never delete.

On SESSION END:
- Append to `.codedna` → `agent_sessions:` with agent, provider, date, session_id, task, changed, visited, message
- Commit with AI git trailers: AI-Agent, AI-Provider, AI-Session, AI-Visited, AI-Message

`exports:` are contracts — never rename without explicit instruction and updating all `used_by:` callers.

Module docstring format:
```
"""filename.py — <purpose ≤15 words>.

exports: fn(args) -> type
used_by: consumer.py → fn
rules:   <hard constraint>
agent:   <model-id> | <provider> | <YYYY-MM-DD> | <session_id> | <what you did and noticed>
         message: "<open hypothesis>"
"""
```
