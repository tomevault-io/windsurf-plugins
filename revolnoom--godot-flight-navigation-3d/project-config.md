- An usual case, where all components are different from 0 and at most 4 bits long per component.
### Add
- One overflow case, where all components overflow.
### Sub
- One underflow case, where all components underflow.

## Add/sub x/y/z
- An usual case, where all components are different from 0 and at most 4 bits long per component.
### Add
- One overflow case.
- One underflow case, when input amount is negative
### Sub
- One underflow case.
- One overflow case, when input amount is negative

## Inc/dec x/y/z
- An usual case, where all components are different from 0 and at most 4 bits long per component.
### Inc
