## Communication style

Talk to the user like a product owner: decisions, outcomes, and trade-offs, not
implementation mechanics. Skip file paths, function names, and generated-code
internals unless the user asks for them directly — save that detail for the
code and commit messages, not the conversation.

## Agent skills

Skill content lives under `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — the shared,
multi-agent source of truth. Claude Code only discovers skills under
`.claude/skills/`, so every skill directory there is a symlink back into
`.agents/skills/` (e.g. `.claude/skills/tdd -> ../../.agents/skills/tdd`).
When adding a new skill under `.agents/skills/`, add the matching symlink:
`ln -s ../../.agents/skills/<name> .claude/skills/<name>`.

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues for berenddeboer/ready-for-agent (via `gh`). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Forge token scopes

Minimum token scopes per Forge and lifecycle step (poll, push, Create
PR, Mark PR Ready for Review, Watch, Merge PR, close-out) live in
[docs/forge-token-scopes.md](docs/forge-token-scopes.md).

### GitHub API notes

Fine-grained GitHub PATs cannot call the Checks API (including GraphQL
`statusCheckRollup.contexts`). That 403 is expected: the harness falls back to
Actions jobs for terminal PR Status Check identity and downloads Actions job
logs for Status Check Handoff diagnostics (`actions=write` for workflow
reruns and job-log reads, `statuses=read`). Pushing or updating
`.github/workflows/**` needs `workflows=write` (distinct from Actions write).

### Triage labels

Default labels: needs-triage, needs-info, ready-for-agent, ready-for-human, wontfix. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout (root CONTEXT.md + docs/adr/). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Domain ontology

The Work Item lifecycle, every Step Run reason code, and the CONTEXT.md
glossary are derived from a versioned ontology under `ontology/` (see
`ontology/README.md`, `docs/adr/0044-ontology-derived-lifecycle-model.md`,
and `docs/adr/0058-ontology-owns-step-run-reason-codes.md`). Domain changes
start with an ontology edit and flow through codegen — never edit
`packages/lifecycle-model/src/generated/work-item-state.ts`,
`packages/lifecycle-model/src/generated/forge.ts`, or the state
enums directly. Use the `ontology-change` skill when adding or changing
lifecycle states, transitions, Step Run reason codes, Forge kinds, or glossary terms.

## Effect

- Before writing Effect code, run `bunx effect-solutions list` and then
  `bunx effect-solutions <topic>...` for the relevant pattern.
- Real Effect implementations are available under
  `~/.local/share/effect-solutions/effect`; use them instead of guessing APIs.
- Common topics: `services-and-layers`, `data-modeling`, `error-handling`,
  `config`, `testing`, `cli`.

# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx affected` ideally) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `bunx nx build`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax


<!-- nx configuration end-->

## Nx project config

Put Nx-specific config (`name`, custom targets like `test`/`migrate`/`serve`) in
each package's `project.json`, not under an `"nx"` key in `package.json`.
