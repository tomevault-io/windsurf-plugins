# AGENTS.md

- Do not implement tool routing or follow-up detection with explicit word-matching lists, keyword tables, or phrase-pattern heuristics.
- Let the model decide when a tool should run, using structured prompts and recent conversation context.
- If extra routing reliability is needed, improve the model-facing context or schema rather than adding hardcoded trigger words.

## Build

- Don't run any build command.
- Test commands are allowed when they help verify changes.

## Development

- For commits, use Conventional Commits format in the commit message in the format `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
- When developing completely new features like slash commands, tools or other capabilities that has to do with user interactions (or the TUI), always have a task at the end of your todo-list to look into the documentation under `site/src/content/docs` and either update existing documentation or add new ones. This is important to keep the documentation up to date and to make sure that users can understand how to use the new features.

### Scopes for commits
- `tui`: Terminal user interface
- `core`: ApfelClawCore
- `server`: ApfelClawServer
- `tools`: Tool definitions and implementations
- `docs`: Documentation updates or additions
- `tests`: Test cases and fixtures
- `site`: Website content and styling

### Tool development
- Read this guide: https://github.com/Arthur-Ficial/apfel/blob/main/docs/tool-calling-guide.md

### Apfel Server development
- Consider this guide for security: https://github.com/Arthur-Ficial/apfel/blob/main/docs/server-security.md

## Apple Foundation Models notes

- Treat Apple’s on-device Foundation Models model as a small general-purpose model: keep tasks narrow, avoid depending on strong code/math/world-knowledge performance, and use tools for fresh or exact data.
- Keep tool definitions explicit and semantically rich. Apple’s guidance around tool calling aligns with this project rule: improve instructions, tool names, descriptions, and argument schemas instead of adding keyword-trigger routing.
- Handle model availability as a first-class product concern. The backend and clients should expect states like unsupported device or Apple Intelligence disabled and offer a clean fallback path.
- Favor deterministic settings and regression fixtures for development. Preserve representative prompt/tool transcripts and use stable generation settings when testing routing or UI behavior so model/framework updates are easier to catch.
- Preserve the local-first privacy model from the README. Default to on-device execution and only reach for network-backed tools when the task actually requires external knowledge or side effects.
