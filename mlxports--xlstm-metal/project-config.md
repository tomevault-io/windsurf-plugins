# Agent and Developer Guide

This repo implements xLSTM for Apple Silicon using MLX with Metal Accelerated Dispatch (MAD). These guidelines ensure
production-safe development.

## Quick Reference

**Primary Entry Point:** `generate.py` - Production runner using MLX backend  
**Core Implementation:** `xlstm_metal/` - MAD wiring, blocks, and inference  
**Tests:** `run_pytest.py` - Test suite runner  
**Documentation:** `docs/` - Technical documentation by component

## CLAUDE Guidance (Read Me First)

This repo runs on Apple Silicon with MLX-first compiled backends. These rules are strict so your help stays
production-safe and useful.

### Zero-Mock Policy (Production Code)

- Don’t add mocks, stubs, or fake implementations to production paths. Use real implementations or leave TODOs in
  comments with precise next steps.
- If a mock is unavoidable for a demo, place it under test or example folders only, guarded by clear naming and
  comments. Never wire a mock into default execution.

### Always Reuse Before Rebuilding

- Before implementing anything, search the repo for existing code:
    - `rg -n "symbol|filename|keyword"` to locate reuse targets.
    - Scan `xlstm_metal/`, `scripts/`, and `docs/` for prior art and conventions.
- Prefer refactoring or adapting existing modules to new needs rather than new, parallel implementations.
- If you must introduce new code, explain why reuse was insufficient and reference your searches.

### Lead With Vulnerability

- Be explicit about what you don’t know or what isn’t working yet.
- State assumptions and risks up front. Offer a short plan with checkpoints.
- After changes, verify and report limits (“what this didn’t solve”).

### Respect the Shell and Filesystem

- Use OS tools for file ops; avoid dumping large files into the terminal:
    - Copy/rename: `cp`, `mv` (not read‑and‑reprint).
    - Search: `rg` (ripgrep) for speed and focus.
    - Inspect selectively: `sed -n '1,200p' <file>` (chunked views only).
- Don’t stream giant artifacts or model weights to stdout. If you need to show something, quote only the relevant lines.

### Memory, GPU, and Process Hygiene

- On macOS/Apple Silicon, respect unified memory constraints
- MLX handles memory automatically; trust the framework
- Don't leave background processes running. Confirm with `top` or `ps`

### Use the Existing Telemetry

- Production runner: `python generate.py --model <path> --prompt "text"`
- Testing: `python run_pytest.py`
- Check model info: `python generate.py --model <path> --info`

### Safe Editing Practices

- Keep changes minimal and focused; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Mirror existing style and folder layout.
- Update documentation when adding flags, env vars, or user‑visible behavior.
- Never paste huge files into responses; prefer diffs and file paths.

### Validation Before Confidence

- If tests exist, run them. If a fast sanity check is possible, do it (e.g., import the module, run a short command).
- Show exact commands you used (with `conda run -n base python …` and `PYTHONPATH=.`) so others can reproduce.

### When Creating New Tools/Scripts

- Provide a concise CLI, a short `--help`, and defaults that are safe on Apple/MLX.
- Add a brief note to documentation if user-facing.

### Don'ts (Common Failure Modes)

- Don’t fabricate behavior or outputs; if something can’t be verified, say so.
- Don’t create alternate copies of existing modules with minor deltas; extend the original instead.
- Don’t spam the terminal with entire files or binary junk.
- Don’t introduce “temporary” shortcuts in production paths (e.g., skipping GPU for convenience).

### Banned/Discouraged Phrases (in production code/comments)

- “simplified”, “for simplicity”, “toy”, “placeholder”, “dummy implementation”, “fake implementation”
- “approximate”, “rough sketch”, “simulate”, “pretend”
- “we won’t implement”, “will not implement” (unless explicitly tracking a TODO with owner/date)

Use precise language: state constraints and the real implementation. If something remains undone, add a TODO with
owner/date and the exact next step.

### Quick Command Snippets

- Search quickly: `rg -n "pattern" path/`
- View a file chunk: `sed -n '1,200p' path/to/file.py`
- Copy/rename: `cp src.py dst.py` • `mv old.py new.py`
- Kill a PID: `kill -TERM <pid>` then `kill -KILL <pid>` if needed

### Ask When Unsure

- If the requirement is ambiguous, ask concise clarifying questions rather than guessing. Provide a proposed plan with
  options.
