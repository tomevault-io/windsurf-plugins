# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Workflow

### Task Workflow: implement → automated review → merge

By default, route implementation work through the **automated review process** rather than
committing or pushing directly to `main`. An independent reviewer pass produces better code.

1. **Implement** on a branch (a worktree is fine for parallel work). Before opening review,
   verify locally — this preserves the verification spirit of the older two-phase flow:
   - tests green: `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk ./gradlew :<module>:jvmTest`
   - style: `spotlessApply` / `ktlintFormat`
   - API: `apiCheck` (run `apiDump` only for an *intended* public-API change)
   - update `CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased) with the issue/PR number
2. **Open a PR via the coderbot wrapper** (`/home/jmonk/git/urithiru/coder-bot/coderbot`),
   authored by `monkopedia-coder`, requesting the reviewer on creation:
   - `coderbot git push -u origin <branch>`
   - `coderbot gh pr create --base main --reviewer monkopedia-reviewer --title "…" --body "…Fixes #<n>…"`
3. **Automated review.** Opening the PR triggers the `monkopedia-reviewer` webhook: a reviewer
   subagent classifies the change by tier, independently re-verifies it (tests / format /
   apiCheck green, per the CI-must-be-green policy), and for tier-1 changes approves and
   squash-merges. Tier-2/3 changes are surfaced to the user instead of auto-merging.

**Key constraints:**
- Do NOT push directly to `main`, and do NOT self-merge — `monkopedia-reviewer` merges.
- Author PRs as `monkopedia-coder` via coderbot and always pass `--reviewer monkopedia-reviewer`;
  PRs opened outside this flow sit unreviewed.
- Keep each PR to one focused change and reference the issue (`Fixes #<n>`).
- CI must be green before merge — fix ALL CI issues, don't just report them. **"Green" means the
  PR's actual GitHub Actions checks have completed and passed — `check` (JVM/wasmJs/Android),
  `check-macos`, and `check-ios` (native). The reviewer MUST wait for these (e.g. `gh pr checks <n>
  --watch`, or `gh pr merge <n> --squash --auto`) before merging; a local `./gradlew` re-run is a
  fast first pass, NOT a substitute — it does not run the macOS/iOS native suite. `main` is branch-
  protected requiring these three checks, so merges block until they pass.** Do not merge while
  checks are still in progress.
- Implementation branches may proceed in parallel; the reviewer serializes merges.

The legacy two-phase pattern (work agent in a worktree → separate review agent merges to `main`
without a PR) in `docs/post-task-workflow.md` is superseded by this automated PR review for
routine work.

### Screenshot Compare & Fix

When the user asks to compare screenshots or fix visual differences, follow the workflow in
`docs/screenshot-compare-workflow.md`. Summary:

1. **Capture** both CodeMirror reference and Compose screenshots (skip reference if already captured)
2. **Compare** by reading both PNGs for each scenario
3. **Build a fix list** — one `TaskCreate` per visual difference, with scenario/description/severity
4. **Report the list** to the user before starting fixes
5. **Fix loop** — for each item: fix code via the automated review workflow (see Task Workflow above), then re-capture and re-compare
6. **Repeat** until all scenarios match or a blocker is hit
7. **Report final status** — what was fixed, what still differs, any blockers

Each fix should be a single focused PR via the automated review workflow.

### Release process

Publishing is irreversible and runs only on maintainer go. Git tags and GitHub Releases exist
**only** for fully-published versions; a partial/failed publish is a burned version — skip it and
cut the next patch.

1. **Version-bump PR** (normal coderbot → reviewer flow): set `version = "X.Y.Z"` (drop the
   `-SNAPSHOT` suffix) in both `convention-plugins/src/main/kotlin/kodemirror.library.gradle.kts`
   and `kodemirror-bom/build.gradle.kts`, and finalize `CHANGELOG.md` (`## [Unreleased]` →
   `## [X.Y.Z] - <date>`).
2. **Tag** `vX.Y.Z` on the merged release commit and push the tag.
3. **Dispatch `deploy.yml`** (`gh workflow run deploy.yml`). A single macOS runner publishes all
   targets (incl. the BOM) to Maven Central in one Gradle invocation — one atomic Central Portal
   deployment, validated + auto-released. After it succeeds, the `release` job auto-creates the
   matching GitHub Release (`vX.Y.Z`) from the CHANGELOG section. The job skips `-SNAPSHOT`/`-RC`
   versions and is re-run safe (no-op if the release already exists). `--verify-tag` fails the job
   if the tag was never pushed.
4. **Verify** the BOM resolves on Maven Central (`repo1.maven.org`); propagation can take 10–35 min.
5. **Notify** downstream consumers.

### General

- When the user says to "always" do something, record that instruction in this file.

## Architecture & Decisions

- Maintain comprehensive lists of decisions and architecture notes in the `docs/` folder.
