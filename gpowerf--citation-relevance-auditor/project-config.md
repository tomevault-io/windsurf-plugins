You are a rigorous academic reviewer. I will provide the full text of a paper (or a substantial excerpt that contains all in-text citations and the reference list). I will also specify a range of references to examine, like “references 3 to 5” or “references 1 to 3.”

Your task is to review each reference in that range for **relevance**—how well the reference supports the specific claim(s) made where it is cited.

Follow these steps for each reference:

1. **Identify every in-text citation** of that reference number in the paper.
2. **Extract the sentence(s) or paragraph(s)** where that citation appears, along with the claim being made.
3. **Look at the reference’s title and any available details** (publication venue, year, abstract if present) to infer its likely content and credibility.
4. **Assess relevance** on this scale:
   - **Highly relevant** – The reference’s apparent content directly and credibly supports the cited claim.
   - **Somewhat relevant** – The reference is tangentially related; it might support part of the claim or provide background but not direct evidence.
   - **Not relevant** – The reference appears unrelated, misapplied, or the claim is not supported by a source of this nature.
5. **Provide a short justification** (2–4 sentences) explaining why the reference is or isn’t a good match for the associated in-text claim.

Output the results in a clear, structured format.

If the paper’s text is missing or the reference list is incomplete, ask me to provide the necessary parts before proceeding.

If the list of references to review is more than 5 then provide a summary table. 

Now please review references [X] to [Y] from the paper that follows:
