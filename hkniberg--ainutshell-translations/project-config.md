# AI in a Nutshell - Translations Repository

This repository contains translations for the book "Generative AI in a Nutshell - How to Survive and Thrive in the Age of AI". It is designed to be translator-friendly, so non-technical contributors can easily review and improve translations without dealing with branches or complex git workflows.

## Translation Files

- **Manuscript files**: `manuscript/manuscript-<lang>.md` - The main book content
- **Metadata files**: `metadata/metadata-<lang>.md` - Title, subtitle, author info, etc. (exported to `LEANPUB_METADATA.*` files in ainutshell, not to `metadata.md`)

## Translated Images (Optional)

If a translator wants to translate images containing text:

1. Create a folder `manuscript/resources-<lang>/` (e.g., `manuscript/resources-da/` for Danish)
2. Add translated images with the **same name** as the original (e.g., `020-roles.jpg`) or with a language suffix (e.g., `020-roles-da.jpg`) - both work
3. Update the manuscript to reference `resources-<lang>/` for translated images
4. Images that are NOT translated should continue to reference `resources/` (the English version)

## Publishing Workflow

This repo is the **source of truth for translations**. The publishing workflow is:

1. Translators submit improvements via PR or email
2. Changes are merged into this repository
3. Run the export script to push translations to the [ainutshell](https://github.com/hkniberg/ainutshell) repo

### Exporting a translation

To export a translation to the ainutshell publishing repo:

```bash
python scripts/export-translation.py <lang>
```

For example, to export the Danish translation:

```bash
python scripts/export-translation.py da
```

This will:
1. Checkout the `preview-da` branch in the ainutshell repo (assumes sibling directory)
2. Copy `manuscript-da.md` → `manuscript/manuscript.md`
3. Update the `LEANPUB_METADATA.*` files with content from the metadata file
4. If translated images exist in `resources-da/`, copy them to `resources/` with corrected names and update image references

After running the script, the user should commit and push to trigger Leanpub preview generation. Once verified, the user should create a PR from `preview-<lang>` to `publish-<lang>`.

### Importing a translation (reverse sync)

If someone edited directly on a preview branch in ainutshell and you want to pull those changes back:

```bash
python scripts/import-translation.py da    # Import Danish only
python scripts/import-translation.py       # Import all languages
```

This copies from ainutshell branches back to this repo. Rarely needed since this repo is the source of truth.

## ainutshell Publishing Repo

The [ainutshell](https://github.com/hkniberg/ainutshell) repo is the publishing repo, optimized for Leanpub. It uses branches to manage different language versions.

### Branch structure

- `preview`: English version of the book, pushing here will cause a new preview version to be generated on Leanpub
- `publish`: English version of the book, pushing here will cause the published version to be updated on Leanpub
- `preview-<lang>`: Version of the book in `<lang>`, pushing here will cause a new preview version to be generated on Leanpub
- `publish-<lang>`: Version of the book in `<lang>`, pushing here will cause the published version to be updated on Leanpub

## For AI Agents
