# AGENTS.md — pico-gpt

Compact, repo-specific guidance. Read this **and** `PLAN.md` before doing anything.

## What this repo is

A step-by-step educational rebuild of [karpathy/nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) → [karpathy/nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat). Goal is **understanding**, not beating any leaderboard. Each phase is one (or a few) commits. See `PLAN.md` for the phase list and exit criteria — **always** check which phase we are in before writing code: do not pull in features from later phases.

## State of the repo right now

The repository is **bootstrapping** (only `PLAN.md` + this file exist on disk so far). Nothing is implemented yet. When the first agent starts coding, follow `PLAN.md` Phase 1 to the letter; do not try to scaffold all phases at once.

## Hardware constraints — DO NOT FORGET

Target machine: **2× NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24 GB, SM 86, Ampere)**.

This rules out a number of things an agent will instinctively reach for from the nanochat code:

- **No FP8.** SM 86 has no fp8 tensor cores. Never copy `--fp8` flags or `torchao.float8`.
- **No Flash Attention 3.** FA3 is Hopper-only. Use `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention` (SDPA) or FA2 if installed. Never gate code behind `USE_FA3`.
- **bf16 is fine** (Ampere has bf16 tensor cores). Default `COMPUTE_DTYPE` should be `bfloat16` on CUDA, `float32` on CPU/MPS. fp16 + GradScaler path is **not** needed for our hardware — skip it.
- **DDP via `torchrun --nproc_per_node=2`**, never 8. Anything assuming 8 GPUs (batch size math, sharding) must be parameterised, not hard-coded.
- **24 GB VRAM per card.** A d=24 GPT-2-scale model with value embeddings will not fit comfortably; cap experiments at d≤16 unless explicitly reducing batch size with gradient accumulation. Always make `--device-batch-size` overridable.
- Everything must also degrade gracefully to **CPU / MPS** for laptop iteration (smaller `--depth`, fewer steps). Test that path on every change.

## Conventions

- **Language: English everywhere** — code, identifiers, comments (when unavoidable), commit messages, `dev/LOG.md`, this file.
- **Single dial of complexity is `--depth`.** Like nanochat, all other model hyperparameters (width, heads, head_dim, LR scaling, weight decay, batch size, training horizon) are derived from depth. Never add a CLI flag whose value could be computed from `depth`.
- **One feature per commit** during Phase 3+. The commit message must say which `dev/LOG.md` entry documents it.
- **No magic dtype.** Do not use `torch.amp.autocast`. Follow nanochat: a single `COMPUTE_DTYPE` global in `pico_gpt/common.py`, with a custom `Linear` that casts weights to input dtype in forward. Embeddings stored directly in `COMPUTE_DTYPE`. Override via `PICO_GPT_DTYPE` env var.
- **No silent failures.** Validate args at entry. If a CLI flag is incompatible with the hardware (e.g. `--fp8` on 3090), error out loudly with an explanation; never silently fall back.

## Toolchain

- **uv** is the dependency manager (matches upstream nanochat). Use:
  ```bash
  uv sync --extra gpu --group dev      # CUDA on the 3090 box
  uv sync --extra cpu --group dev      # laptop
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **`pyproject.toml`** must declare two explicit torch indexes (cpu vs cu12x wheel) under `[tool.uv.sources]`, same pattern as nanochat. `cpu` and `gpu` extras must be declared `conflicts` in `[tool.uv]` so a user can't activate both.
- **Tests**: `pytest`. Mark slow / GPU-only tests with `@pytest.mark.slow` and `@pytest.mark.gpu`. CPU-only smoke tests must run in under 60 s without CUDA.
- **No `pip install`, no `conda`**, no `requirements.txt`. Anything not in `pyproject.toml` does not exist.

## Project layout (target, populated phase by phase)

```
pico_gpt/        # the library (model, optim, dataloader, tokenizer, engine, common)
scripts/         # CLIs: tok_train, base_train, base_eval, chat_sft, chat_cli, chat_web
tasks/           # eval/SFT tasks: mmlu, gsm8k, humaneval, smoltalk, ...
data/            # data prep scripts; downloaded shards live in base_data*/ (gitignored)
tests/           # pytest suite
runs/            # bash entrypoints (runcpu.sh, run2x3090.sh)
dev/
  LOG.md         # dated experiment log — append, never rewrite history
  PLAN.md        # the phase plan (or kept at repo root, fine either way)
```

Do not create this whole tree up-front. Create directories as their phase begins.

## Workflow rules an agent will get wrong without this

- Before adding any architectural tweak, **check `dev/LOG.md`**: if it's marked as a negative result upstream (DyT, MoE, varlen, MTP, half-truncated RoPE, asymmetric softcap, FineWeb non-EDU, etc.), do not re-add it without a written reason.
- When in doubt about an upstream design choice, the source of truth ordering is: **`nanochat/*.py` code > nanochat `dev/LOG.md` > discussion #481 > README > other discussions**. Verify before quoting.
- Track every run with a one-paragraph entry in `dev/LOG.md` (date, depth, hardware, val bpb / loss, throughput, what changed, A/B vs previous). Negative results are required to be logged too.
