Introduction
Get started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Java SDK released! Check out what else is new.
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

​
Why MCP?
MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:

A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure
​
General architecture
At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

MCP Hosts: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
MCP Clients: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
MCP Servers: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
Local Data Sources: Your computer’s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
Remote Services: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to
​
