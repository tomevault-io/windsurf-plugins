# Quiver Project Rules 🏹

## Critical: Development Location

**ALWAYS work in the `/dev/src/` directory for development!**

- Source files: `/dev/src/Quiver-Dev.js` and `/dev/src/functions/*.js`
- Generated file: `/dev/Quiver.js` (AUTO-GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT)
- Assets source: `/dev/src/assets/`

## File Edit Guidelines

### ✅ DO EDIT:
- `/dev/src/Quiver-Dev.js` - Main entry point for development
- `/dev/src/functions/*.js` - All modular function files
- `/dev/src/assets/*` - UI assets (icons, images)
- `/dev/build.js` - Build script
- `/dev/README.md` - Documentation

### ❌ NEVER EDIT:
- `/dev/Quiver.js` - Auto-generated from build script

## Project Structure

This is a modular Cavalry script:
- Development uses `api.load()` to load separate modules
- Production uses a bundled single-file version (`dev/Quiver.js`)
- Build script combines all modules into `Quiver.js`
- The `.jsc` file at root is the encrypted Cavalry wrapper

## Build Commands

```bash
cd dev
npm run build          # Standard build (readable)
npm run build:minify   # Minified build (production)
```

## When Making Changes

1. Edit files in `/dev/src/`
2. Test by loading `/dev/src/Quiver-Dev.js` in Cavalry
3. Run `npm run build` to generate production version
4. The dev version shows "Quiver-Dev [version]" in window title
5. The production version shows just "Quiver" in window title

## Cavalry Script Context

- This is a JavaScript UI script for Cavalry (motion design software)
- Uses Cavalry API: `api.*` and `ui.*` global objects
- Main file needs `ui.show()` at the end
- Loaded modules don't have access to `ui` until called from main script
- Files loaded via `api.load()` share the global scope

## Adding New Features

1. Create new file: `dev/src/functions/quiver_myFeature.js`
2. Add to `dev/src/Quiver-Dev.js`: `api.load(ui.scriptLocation+"/functions/quiver_myFeature.js");`
3. Build runs automatically pick up new modules
4. Run `npm run build` to bundle into production

## Important Notes

- Keep module files focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive function names (no minification of names in production)
- Console logs are preserved (needed for Cavalry debugging)
- Comments are preserved in standard builds
- Version number in `currentVersion` constant
