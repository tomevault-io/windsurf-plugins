# Working on OPEN-TOON

## Current context

- The immediate plan targets the character-animation Harmony Moment through contract-level delivery slices; the full P00-P11 scope remains required for supported 1.0. This revision is planning-only: do not infer authorization to implement new features from the earlier P11 request. Read `docs/planning/HARMONY-MOMENT.md`, `FIRST-STEPS.md` and implementation status before subsequent authorized work. Mouse input is required; the owner has no physical tablet available yet.
- The user accepted C++20 + Qt 6/QML as the technical direction and explicitly requested proven, efficient open-source library reuse. Candidate libraries still require the documented adoption evidence.
- **English is mandatory** for all first-party UI, menus, tooltips, messages, accessibility labels, built-in assets, help, code identifiers/comments and public documentation. User content remains multilingual. See `docs/design/02-language-policy.md` and `NFR-027`.
- All project documentation and canonical catalog prose are now English. Preserve that language in future work; the owner may continue the conversation in Spanish.
- The interface is minimalist black, white and gray, with a Geist-inspired visual language and its own identity.
- The repository is public at `mijim/OPEN-TOON`. Preserve concurrent user edits and do not restore intentionally removed research references.

## Read only the relevant context

1. Start with `docs/INDEX.md` and `docs/planning/README.md`.
2. Query a feature assignment with `python3 scripts/roadmap.py feature DEF-005`, then its phase and catalog requirement.
3. Use `python3 scripts/catalog.py show DEF-005` or `domain DEF` to retrieve behavior and acceptance.
4. Review the owning architecture contract and the library register before adding dependencies.
5. Node inventory entries may describe families. Their specification owner must expand operators and parameters before implementation; never count entries as implemented effects.

- Keep the official `README.md` concise and professional. Link detailed coverage and limitations from implementation records; do not restore the removed mascot or long experimental feature inventory. The owner superseded the earlier playful-README policy.

## Maintain the planning records

- Canonical catalog files: `features.json`, `domains.json`, `node-reference.json`, `nonfunctional.json` under `docs/catalog/`. Preserve stable IDs.
- Canonical planning files: `roadmap.json` (schema 2, including delivery slices), `libraries.json`, `node-assignments.json` under `docs/planning/`.
- Use `roadmap.py slice HM-05` and `roadmap.py next` for implementation entry. Every required contract needs accepted evidence; an entire phase/domain is not a substitute gate. Keep at most two bounded slices active when separate owners exist.
- Regenerate with `python3 scripts/catalog.py render` and `python3 scripts/roadmap.py render`; validate with `python3 scripts/validate_docs.py`.
- Each feature has exactly one primary completion phase. Earlier subsets stay partial; optional deferrals remain unimplemented with an explicit decision.
- Each new capability needs scope, observable behavior, acceptance and an owning module. Update phase coverage and estimates when scope changes.
- Technology, serialization, time, color and extension-contract changes need an ADR update.
- A button, mockup or implementation-mirroring test does not complete a capability. Record real behavior and verification evidence separately from the plan.

## Interaction requirements

- Curves defaults to All motion for the selected layer. Its legend edits a highlighted curve in place; Link easing defaults to all pose channels for handle drags. Individual channels are optional precision views. Clear removes both exposures and animation keys in the selected range, with atomic undo.
- Keep controls compact and visually minimal throughout the interface. Curves should devote most panel height to the graph; numeric controls are secondary. The timeline/curve panel must resize by dragging its visible workspace separator.
- Editing and transforms must be direct: canvas bounding boxes with drag handles and live previews. Do not put selection transforms or timing tools in separate dialogs.
- Timing and curves stay in the main workspace. Properties describes the explicitly selected canvas object/region or layer, with a clear empty state; it must not silently edit a different target.

## Architecture

- Keep the C++20 domain independent of QML/widgets, filesystem, network and proprietary SDKs. UI calls application use cases; adapters implement ports.
- Route all document mutations through transactional commands with undo/redo. View state, selection and hover have separate ownership.
