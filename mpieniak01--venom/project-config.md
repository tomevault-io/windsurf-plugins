# Coding Agent Hard Gate (Repository Instruction)

Default response language for workspace agents is Polish unless the user explicitly asks for English or an external format requires it.

Before declaring task completion, always run:

1. `make pr-fast`

Exception:
1. For markdown-only change sets (all changed files end with `.md`), `make pr-fast` may be skipped.

If any command fails:

1. fix the issue,
2. rerun until it passes or there is a confirmed environment blocker.

Final completion summary (and PR description) must include:

1. executed validation commands,
2. pass/fail for each command,
3. changed-lines coverage percentage,
4. known skips/risks with explicit justification.

Never mark work as done with failing required quality gates.

## Execution Guardrails (Mandatory)

1. Do not invoke the same sub-agent in a loop.
2. Re-invoking a sub-agent is allowed only after a real state change:
   - new failing check class,
   - new user requirement,
   - or explicit recovery after tool crash.
3. Do not rerun `make pr-fast` without code or environment change.
4. Do not claim pass/fail from partial logs (`grep`, `head`, `tail`) without validating command exit status.
5. Run heavy optional checks (for example CodeQL/code review tooling) once per session.
6. If optional security tooling times out due to environment, report it as a blocker and do not rerun in the same session.
7. After first confirmed green `make pr-fast` and final report generation, stop execution.
8. Do not produce duplicate final reports or trigger additional implementation loops after completion.
