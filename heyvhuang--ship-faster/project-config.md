# Agent Runtime

# Agent Runtime

OpenClaw runs a single embedded agent runtime.

## Workspace (required)

OpenClaw uses a single agent workspace directory (`agents.defaults.workspace`) as the agent’s **only** working directory (`cwd`) for tools and context.

Recommended: use `openclaw setup` to create `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` if missing and initialize the workspace files.

Full workspace layout + backup guide: [Agent workspace](/concepts/agent-workspace)

If `agents.defaults.sandbox` is enabled, non-main sessions can override this with
per-session workspaces under `agents.defaults.sandbox.workspaceRoot` (see
[Gateway configuration](/gateway/configuration)).

## Bootstrap files (injected)

Inside `agents.defaults.workspace`, OpenClaw expects these user-editable files:

* `AGENTS.md` — operating instructions + “memory”
* `SOUL.md` — persona, boundaries, tone
* `TOOLS.md` — user-maintained tool notes (e.g. `imsg`, `sag`, conventions)
* `BOOTSTRAP.md` — one-time first-run ritual (deleted after completion)
* `IDENTITY.md` — agent name/vibe/emoji
* `USER.md` — user profile + preferred address

On the first turn of a new session, OpenClaw injects the contents of these files directly into the agent context.

Blank files are skipped. Large files are trimmed and truncated with a marker so prompts stay lean (read the file for full content).

If a file is missing, OpenClaw injects a single “missing file” marker line (and `openclaw setup` will create a safe default template).

`BOOTSTRAP.md` is only created for a **brand new workspace** (no other bootstrap files present). If you delete it after completing the ritual, it should not be recreated on later restarts.

To disable bootstrap file creation entirely (for pre-seeded workspaces), set:

```json5  theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
{ agent: { skipBootstrap: true } }
```

## Built-in tools

Core tools (read/exec/edit/write and related system tools) are always available,
subject to tool policy. `apply_patch` is optional and gated by
`tools.exec.applyPatch`. `TOOLS.md` does **not** control which tools exist; it’s
guidance for how *you* want them used.

## Skills

OpenClaw loads skills from these locations (highest precedence first):

* Workspace: `<workspace>/skills`
* Project agent skills: `<workspace>/.agents/skills`
* Personal agent skills: `~/.agents/skills`
* Managed/local: `~/.openclaw/skills`
* Bundled (shipped with the install)
* Extra skill folders: `skills.load.extraDirs`

Skills can be gated by config/env (see `skills` in [Gateway configuration](/gateway/configuration)).

## Runtime boundaries

The embedded agent runtime is built on the Pi agent core (models, tools, and
prompt pipeline). Session management, discovery, tool wiring, and channel
delivery are OpenClaw-owned layers on top of that core.

## Sessions

Session transcripts are stored as JSONL at:

* `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/<SessionId>.jsonl`

The session ID is stable and chosen by OpenClaw.
Legacy session folders from other tools are not read.

## Steering while streaming

When queue mode is `steer`, inbound messages are injected into the current run.
Queued steering is delivered **after the current assistant turn finishes
executing its tool calls**, before the next LLM call. Steering no longer skips
remaining tool calls from the current assistant message; it injects the queued
message at the next model boundary instead.

When queue mode is `followup` or `collect`, inbound messages are held until the
current turn ends, then a new agent turn starts with the queued payloads. See
[Queue](/concepts/queue) for mode + debounce/cap behavior.

Block streaming sends completed assistant blocks as soon as they finish; it is
**off by default** (`agents.defaults.blockStreamingDefault: "off"`).
Tune the boundary via `agents.defaults.blockStreamingBreak` (`text_end` vs `message_end`; defaults to text\_end).
Control soft block chunking with `agents.defaults.blockStreamingChunk` (defaults to
800–1200 chars; prefers paragraph breaks, then newlines; sentences last).
Coalesce streamed chunks with `agents.defaults.blockStreamingCoalesce` to reduce
single-line spam (idle-based merging before send). Non-Telegram channels require
explicit `*.blockStreaming: true` to enable block replies.
Verbose tool summaries are emitted at tool start (no debounce); Control UI
streams tool output via agent events when available.
More details: [Streaming + chunking](/concepts/streaming).

## Model refs

Model refs in config (for example `agents.defaults.model` and `agents.defaults.models`) are parsed by splitting on the **first** `/`.

* Use `provider/model` when configuring models.
