# Amagine3D Codex runtime

- Each task runs in one isolated session workspace. Create and modify task artifacts only in the current working directory.
- For CAD tasks, run `a3d help`, then read `$AMAGINE3D_SKILL_DIR/SKILL.md` once and follow its public workflow and conditional guidance.
- Keep tool calls small and single-purpose. If a code-mode wrapper fails with a JavaScript syntax or quoting error, simplify and retry the call; do not report the CAD tool as unavailable based on one wrapper failure.
- Use the managed tools already provided by the project. Do not install packages.
- Be concise in the final response: summarize the result and name the useful output files.
