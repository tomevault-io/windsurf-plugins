## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.

## Slice-first rule (MUST NOT skip)

**Never write code before a slice stub exists AND a branch is created.**

When `/enhanced-flow-planner` detects continuation mode:
1. Run plan-health-check
2. Run plan-modifier to **add the slice to TRAIL.md + PROGRESS.md + a slice stub file** under `docs/plan/slices/`
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b slice/<N>-<short-name>`
4. Only then write code

"Keep it simple" narrows scope. It does not bypass the slice stub or the branch. The stub *is* the requirement contract — without it there is no acceptance criteria and no gate evidence. The branch *is* the delivery unit — without it there is no reviewable PR.

## Branch-before-commit rule (enforced by hook)

**Never commit directly to `main`.** The `pre-commit` hook blocks it.

Every piece of work — however small — goes on a branch:
```bash
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>   # feat/ fix/ docs/ slice/ chore/
```

Emergency override (coordinators only, never for feature work):
```bash
ALLOW_MAIN_COMMIT=1 git commit ...
```

The hook allows merge commits through automatically. Everything else on `main` is blocked.

## PR Composition

When creating or updating a PR with `/create-pr` or `/update-pr`, include a **Checklist**
section in the generated body (after Test Results, before Closes):

```markdown
## Checklist

- [x] `./scripts/quality-gates.sh` passes locally
- [x] New tests added or updated (or change is docs-only)
- [x] Docs updated where applicable
- [ ] No secrets or credentials committed
```

**Auto-tick rules:**
- Tick quality-gates and tests if the Test Results section shows all stacks passing
- Tick docs if the commit subjects mention docs/chore/refactor (no new behaviour)
- Leave "No secrets" **always unchecked** — the reviewer confirms this manually

This mirrors `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` so human-opened and skill-opened PRs
share the same Checklist structure.
