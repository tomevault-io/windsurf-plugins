# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents working on this repository.

## What This Is

A GitHub repo ([dmythro/terminal-setup](https://github.com/dmythro/terminal-setup)) containing a one-command macOS terminal setup script. Designed to be run via `/bin/bash -c "$(curl ...)"` on a fresh Mac (same pattern as Homebrew — downloads first, then executes with stdin connected to the terminal). Supports `-y`/`--yes` for non-interactive mode.

## Files

- `setup-terminal.sh` — Interactive setup script that installs packages and writes config files (`~/.zshenv`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.tmux.conf`, `~/.config/starship.toml`)
- `reset-terminal.sh` — Interactive reset script that undoes setup-terminal.sh (removes configs, optionally uninstalls packages)
- `Dmythro.terminal` — Terminal.app profile plist (dark theme, MonaspiceNe NFM 14pt, 120x36)
- `README.md` — User-facing documentation with feature tables, comparison chart, and quick start
- `AGENTS.md` — This file (symlinked as `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code compatibility)

## Script Structure

The script uses `set -e` and is sequential with interactive prompts (`read -p`). It writes config files inline using **quoted heredocs** (`cat > ~/.file << 'TAG'`) so variables aren't expanded during write. The tmux toggle uses a `__TMUX_TOGGLE__` placeholder in the zshrc heredoc, replaced via `sed -i ''` after writing — this is the only value that needs post-write substitution.

`REPO_RAW` (line 9) is used to download `Dmythro.terminal` from the repo at runtime (section 11).

Key sections: Homebrew install → core packages (incl. zsh-completions) → optional tmux → optional dev tools (incl. zoxide, delta) → optional AI coding agents → fzf keybindings → delta git config → tmux.conf → .zshenv (PATH) → .zshrc (interactive config) → starship.toml → Terminal.app profile import → summary output.

**`.zshenv` vs `.zshrc` split**: PATH setup (brew shellenv, `~/.local/bin`) lives in `~/.zshenv` because it's sourced by ALL zsh invocations including non-interactive shells (used by AI coding agents like Claude Code). Interactive-only config (completions, plugins, aliases, prompt) stays in `~/.zshrc`. The `.zshenv` block is bracketed with `# BEGIN/END setup-terminal.sh` markers for idempotent writes and precise cleanup.

`reset-terminal.sh` mirrors this structure with per-section interactive prompts. It cleans setup-terminal.sh lines from `~/.zshenv` (preserving other content like cargo) and replaces `~/.zshrc` with a minimal version. Packages are left installed by default since they're inert without configs.

## Conventions

- Config sections use `# --- N. Section Name ---` numbered comment style
- Summary output at the end lists all installed features with emoji bullets
- The summary is conditional — only shows sections for packages the user chose to install
- The script is destructive — it overwrites `~/.zshrc`, `~/.tmux.conf`, and `~/.config/starship.toml` without backup. Don't test on a machine with configs you want to keep.
- AI coding agent prompts default to Y for OpenCode and Claude Code, N for the rest

## Terminal Profile Notes

`Dmythro.terminal` already has `useOptionAsMetaKey` set to `true` in the plist. The script still shows a manual instruction for this (section 12) as a reminder, since Terminal.app may not always respect the plist value on import.

## macOS 26 Support

The .zshrc detects macOS 26+ via `sw_vers -productVersion` and sets `COLORTERM=truecolor`. The tmux config uses `tmux-256color` with true color overrides (`Tc`). This enables full 24-bit color in Terminal.app on Tahoe.

## AI Coding Agents

No AI agents are installed or prompted during setup. The final summary lists all available agents with their `brew install` commands for the user to run when ready:
- **OpenCode** (`brew install opencode`) — open source
- **Claude Code** (`brew install --cask claude-code`) — Anthropic
- **Codex** (`brew install --cask codex`) — OpenAI, open source
- **Gemini CLI** (`brew install gemini-cli`) — Google, open source
- **Aider** (`brew install aider`) — multi-model pair programming

The reset script still handles both formula and cask uninstalls for agents that were installed manually.
