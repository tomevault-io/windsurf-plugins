# Project testing notes

## Android device text input

- Do not use `adb shell input text` for Douyin URLs or other punctuation-sensitive text. It can silently drop `:`, `/`, `.`, and other characters.
- Inject test share text with an `ACTION_SEND` intent (or a clipboard API when that flow is specifically under test), then read the UI hierarchy and confirm the complete original URL is present before starting the parse.
- During parse and preview checks, do not tap the save-to-gallery action unless the user explicitly asks for a real save test.
