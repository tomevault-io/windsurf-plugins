## Project Structure & Module Organization
This is a `uv` workspace monorepo for Python 3.12+. The main library lives in `phyai/src/phyai`, with tests in `phyai/tests`. `phyai-kernel/` contains Triton and JIT kernel code under `phyai_kernel/`, plus `tests/` and `benchmark/`. `phyai-ext/` contains the C++ extension: `csrc/`, `include/`, Python wrappers in `src/phyai_ext`, and tests in `tests/`. `phyai-model-optimizer/` and `phyai-utils-tools/` follow the same `src/<package>` and `tests/` layout. Documentation is in `docs/`, examples in `examples/`, helper scripts in `scripts/`, and Dockerfiles in `docker/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `uv sync`: install the full editable workspace from `uv.lock`; this also builds `phyai-ext` via scikit-build-core.
- `uv run pytest`: run the full test suite defined in the root `pyproject.toml`.
- `uv run pytest phyai/tests/weights/test_loader.py`: run one test module; append `::test_name` for a single test.
- `scripts/setup_dev_env.sh`: install pre-commit hooks for local development.
- `scripts/run_pre_commit.sh`: run formatting, spelling, and C/C++ formatting checks across the repo.
- `uv run phyai-kernel show-env`: inspect kernel-related environment and build settings.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Python is formatted with `ruff-format`; keep modules typed where practical and use package-local helpers before adding new abstractions. C and C++ use `.clang-format` with 2-space indentation and 128-column formatting. `.editorconfig` requires LF endings, UTF-8, and final newlines. C++ naming is enforced through `.clang-tidy`: classes use `CamelCase`, variables use `lower_case`, and globals use `UPPER_CASE`.

## Testing Guidelines
Tests use `pytest` with importlib import mode. Place tests in the package-local `tests/` tree and name files `test_*.py`. Prefer targeted tests for changed behavior, then run `uv run pytest` before submitting broader changes. CPU is the default for most tests; CUDA-specific tests should opt in explicitly through device selection.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history follows Conventional Commit-style messages such as `feat(phyai): pi0.5 support` and `fix(phyai): weight loader refactor`. Use a concise type and scope when possible: `feat(phyai-kernel): add rms_norm benchmark`. Pull requests should describe the change, list validation commands run, link related issues, and include screenshots or logs when user-visible behavior, docs, or performance output changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Keep dependency pins and `uv.lock` changes intentional. Do not casually bump hard runtime dependencies such as Torch, FlashInfer, or Transformers. Declare new `PHYAI_*` environment variables in `phyai/src/phyai/env.py` instead of reading `os.environ` ad hoc.
