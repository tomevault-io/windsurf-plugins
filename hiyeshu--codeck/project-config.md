# codeck — AI presentation skill

## Architecture

codeck outputs a **single HTML file**, assembled by `assemble.sh`:

| Author | File | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| Human (fixed) | `engine.js` + `engine.css` | Navigation, fragments, overview, speaker mode, progress bar |
| AI (per deck) | `custom.css` | `:root` variables + layout primitives + per-page styles + mobile |
| AI (per deck) | `slides.html` | `<section class="slide" data-notes="...">` free HTML |

Engine code is fixed. AI handles content and visuals only.

## Pipeline

```
Materials → content diagnosis (3 signals) → dynamic role selection
  ↓
outline.md (narrative structure + user intent)
  ↓
custom.css + slides.html → assemble.sh → single HTML
  ↓
review → export (PDF/PPTX) → speech
```

Core idea: skills handle process and format. Knowledge comes from dynamically summoned "people" — role names activate the AI's knowledge network.

## Three diagnostic signals

1. **Domain** — determines outline role
2. **Expression challenge** — determines design role
3. **Audience starting point** — determines review role (inverse: listener most likely to struggle)

## Directory structure

Skills installed at `~/.claude/skills/codeck*/`.

Two directories at runtime:
- **cwd** — the user's project. codeck reads materials here, writes final deliverables here (HTML, PDF, PPTX).
- **`~/.codeck/projects/{slug}/`** — codeck's workspace. Reads and writes intermediate artifacts here (diagnosis.md, outline.md, design-notes.md, design-dna.json, custom.css, slides.html, speech.md).
