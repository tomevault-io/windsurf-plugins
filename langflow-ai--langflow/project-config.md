description: This project uses [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) as the standard for providing context to AI coding agents. The `@AGENTS.md` import above tells Claude Code to load `AGENTS.md` automatically; other tools that natively support `AGENTS.md` will pick it up directly. The `@.claude/CLAUDE.md` import loads the local hard-rules file (gitignored) that mirrors the PostToolUse hook policy.
