**
Test Execution Permission Protocol
**

// Default Behavior
- NEVER run tests automatically unless explicitly instructed to do so
- Always ask for permission before executing any test suite or test command
- This includes unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and any form of automated testing

// When to Ask Permission
- Before running `pytest`, `npm test`, `python -m unittest`, or any testing command
- Before executing test scripts or test-related make commands
- Before running any command that might trigger CI/CD pipelines
- Before executing any command that might affect remote services or databases

// Permission Request Format
- Clearly state what tests you want to run and why
- Explain the expected duration and any potential side effects
- Ask: "Should I run [specific test command] to verify this change?"
- Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding

// Exceptions - Auto-run Only When
- The user explicitly says "run the tests" or "test this"
- The user includes test commands in their request
- The user specifically asks you to "verify by testing"
- The conversation is explicitly about debugging test failures

// Test Analysis Without Execution
- You CAN analyze test files, test configurations, and test code without running them
- You CAN suggest what tests should be run and how to run them
- You CAN review test results that are provided to you
- You CAN help write or modify test code without executing it

// Safety Considerations
- Some tests might be expensive to run (long duration, resource intensive)
- Some tests might have side effects (database changes, API calls, file system modifications)
- Some tests might require specific environment setup or credentials
- Some tests might trigger alerts or notifications in production monitoring systems

// Best Practices
- If you need to verify functionality, suggest the specific test command but ask before running
- When helping debug test failures, work with provided test output rather than re-running
- If writing new tests, explain how to run them but don't execute automatically
- Always consider the impact of test execution on the development environment
