**
OS Detection and Shell Command Formatting Rule
**

// OS Detection Strategy
- Always check the user's OS before suggesting shell commands
- Use `os.name` or `platform.system()` in Python to detect the operating system
- For script suggestions, provide platform-appropriate commands

// Windows Commands (when os.name == 'nt' or platform.system() == 'Windows')
- Use PowerShell syntax for complex operations
- Use `cmd.exe` syntax for simple commands
- Path separators: use `\` or `os.path.join()` for cross-platform compatibility
- Example: `kubectl get pods --cluster=prod` (works on Windows)
- For file paths: `C:\dev\project\file.txt` or use forward slashes in many contexts

// Linux/macOS Commands (when platform.system() in ['Linux', 'Darwin'])
- Use bash/shell syntax
- Path separators: use `/`
- Example: `./scripts/install.sh` or `chmod +x script.sh`
- Use standard Unix conventions for file permissions and execution

// Cross-Platform Best Practices
- When writing Python code, use `pathlib.Path` for file operations
- Use `subprocess` with proper shell=True/False based on OS
- For docker commands, they work the same across platforms
- For kubectl commands, syntax is identical across platforms

// Script Recommendations
- If suggesting shell scripts, provide both `.sh` (Linux/macOS) and `.ps1` (Windows) versions when relevant
- For Python scripts, ensure they work cross-platform using appropriate libraries
- Always test path operations with both forward and backward slashes in mind

// Environment Variables
- Windows: use `%VARIABLE%` in cmd, `$env:VARIABLE` in PowerShell
- Linux/macOS: use `$VARIABLE` or `${VARIABLE}`
- Python: use `os.environ.get('VARIABLE')` for cross-platform access
