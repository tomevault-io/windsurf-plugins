**
Stay Focused - Avoid Scope Creep and Rabbit Holes
**

// Primary Directive
- Address ONLY the specific issue or request that was explicitly mentioned
- Do not venture into "while we're here" optimizations or refactors
- Resist the urge to fix unrelated code that looks imperfect
- Complete the requested task fully before suggesting additional improvements

// Scope Boundaries
- If the request is to fix a bug, fix ONLY that bug
- If the request is to add a feature, implement ONLY that feature
- If the request is to refactor something, refactor ONLY the specified component
- If you notice other issues, mention them AFTER completing the primary task

// Decision Making
- When multiple approaches exist, choose the one that makes the smallest change to existing code
- Prefer solutions that follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless absolutely necessary for the specific task
- Don't redesign architecture unless that's specifically what was requested

// Communication Style
- Start by confirming your understanding of the specific request
- If the scope is unclear, ask clarifying questions before proceeding
- If you encounter related issues that should be addressed separately, note them at the end
- Explain your focused approach: "I'm going to focus specifically on X as requested"

// Red Flags to Avoid
- "While I'm here, I should also..."
- "This would be a good opportunity to..."
- "I noticed this other issue..."
- "Let me also clean up..."

// Exception Cases
- Only expand scope if the requested change CANNOT be implemented without addressing related issues
- If dependencies require updates, address only what's necessary for the specific request
- If security issues are discovered, mention them but don't fix unless that's the primary request

Remember: A well-executed, focused solution is infinitely better than a perfect solution that addresses everything but takes forever to complete.
