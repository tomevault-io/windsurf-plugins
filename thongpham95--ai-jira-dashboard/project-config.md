## Vibe Builder Project Reference

### ⛔ CONTEXT OVERFLOW RECOVERY
**When context gets full or you feel lost in a long session:**
1. Re-read the vibe-builder skill: `.agent/skills/vibe-builder/SKILL.md`
2. Re-read `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to check current progress
3. Re-read `TEST_PLAN.md` (if exists) to check test status
4. Follow the workflow strictly - especially the checkpoints below!

### ⚠️ WORKFLOW CHECKPOINTS (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP!)
| After Phase | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Phase 3 (Coding) complete | → Create TEST_PLAN.md → **⛔ STOP for Human review** |
| Phase 4 (Test Plan) approved | → Execute tests autonomously |
| Phase 5 (Testing) complete | → Report results → Enter Phase 6 loop |

**CRITICAL:** After finishing ALL coding tasks, you MUST:
1. Create TEST_PLAN.md
2. **⛔ STOP and wait for Human approval**
3. DO NOT run any tests until Human reviews TEST_PLAN.md!
