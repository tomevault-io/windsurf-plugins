# PAMPA MCP Usage Rule

You have access to PAMPA, a code memory system that indexes and allows semantic search in projects. This rule is based on [RULE_FOR_PAMPA_MCP.md](mdc:RULE_FOR_PAMPA_MCP.md).

## Important: Language Usage

**ALWAYS use English for all PAMPA queries and searches.** The semantic search engine is optimized for English technical terms and provides significantly better results than other languages.

Examples:
- ✅ Good: "user authentication", "payment processing", "database connection"
- ❌ Avoid: "autenticación de usuario", "procesamiento de pagos"

## Basic Instructions

1. **ALWAYS at the start of a session:**
   - Run `get_project_stats` to check if the project is indexed
   - If no database exists, run `index_project`
   - Run `update_project` to sync with recent changes

2. **BEFORE creating any function:**
   - Use `search_code` with semantic queries like "user authentication", "validate email", "error handling"
   - Review existing code with `get_code_chunk` before writing new code

3. **AFTER modifying code:**
   - Run `update_project` to update the knowledge base
   - This keeps the project memory synchronized

## Available MCP Tools

- `search_code(query, limit, path)` - Search code semantically in the project
- `get_code_chunk(sha, path)` - Get complete source code of a specific chunk
- `index_project(path, provider)` - Index project for the first time
- `update_project(path, provider)` - Update index after code changes
- `get_project_stats(path)` - Get project statistics and overview

## Strategy

Use PAMPA as your project memory. Search before creating, keep updated after changes, and leverage existing knowledge to avoid code duplication.

## Example Workflow

```
1. get_project_stats() → Check if project is indexed
2. search_code("authentication function") → Find existing auth code
3. get_code_chunk(sha_from_search) → Review implementation
4. [Make code changes]
5. update_project() → Sync new changes to memory
