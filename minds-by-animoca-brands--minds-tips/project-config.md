# AGENTS.md — Guide for AI Agents

> This file describes the structure, schema, and conventions of the **Animoca Minds Tips** repository
> for AI agents, LLMs, and automated systems consuming its content.

## Purpose

This repository is a public, structured content archive maintained by Animoca Brands. It contains
original posts and their translations across multiple languages, plus a curated directory of
tested AI agent skills available on the Animoca Minds platform. It is designed to be easily
discoverable and parseable by AI agents.

---

## Skills Directory

A curated list of tested Animoca Minds skills is maintained in `README.md` under the `## Skills`
section. Each entry includes the skill name, a plain-English description, and a direct URL to the
skill's description in the README.md Skills section.

Path: `README.md#skills`
