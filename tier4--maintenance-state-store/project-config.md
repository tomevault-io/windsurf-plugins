# CLAUDE.md — maintenance-state-store Developer Guide

## Project Overview

Design document: Prevent OTA updates during vehicle operation

This library is part of the safety mechanism that prevents OTA updates from being applied
to a vehicle while it is driving. It serves as the **Source of Truth for the Fail-Prevent layer**,
persisting the maintenance state (OFF / ON / UNKNOWN) to the filesystem with atomic writes
and corruption detection.

C++ and Python are **independent implementations** sharing the same file format and API contract.
They are kept in separate directories and use separate build/packaging systems.

## Common Commands

### C++ build

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

### C++ tests

```bash
cmake --build build && cd build && ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Python install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Python tests

```bash
pip install -e . && pytest tests/test_store.py -v
```

### All tests (C++ + Python)

```bash
cmake --build build && cd build && ctest --output-on-failure && cd .. && pytest tests/test_store.py -v
```

| `CMakeLists.txt`                                              | Build definition — produces `.a` and `.so`; ament_cmake support |
| `package.xml`                                                 | ROS2 package manifest — required for colcon workspace builds    |

### Python

| File                                          | Role                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `python/maintenance_state_store/__init__.py`  | Package entry point (re-exports)           |
| `python/maintenance_state_store/_store.py`    | Implementation (`State`, `Store`)          |
| `python/maintenance_state_store/py.typed`     | PEP 561 marker for type checkers           |
| `pyproject.toml`                              | Package config (hatchling)                 |
| `tests/test_store.py`                         | pytest suite (27 cases, incl. cross-lang)  |

### Versioning

| File      | Role                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VERSION` | Single source of truth for the project version (`0.1.0`) |

Both `CMakeLists.txt` (`file(READ VERSION ...)`) and `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.hatch.version]`) read from this file.
On release, the CI overwrites it with the tag: `echo "${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}" > VERSION`.

### CI

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` | `cpp`, `python` (matrix), `sonar`, `compat` — on push/PR |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | `python` only — on `v*` tag push, uploads `.whl`/`.tar.gz` |

## Architecture Decisions

### C++ and Python are independent implementations

Both implement the same file format and API contract (read / write / force_write).
They are not linked: the Python package uses `binascii.crc32` (stdlib) and `os.rename()`
rather than wrapping the C++ library via pybind11.

**Rationale**: a pure Python package can be installed with `pip install` without a C++ toolchain,
which is essential for CLI tools, monitoring services, and Ansible playbooks.

**Risk mitigation**: cross-language compatibility is verified at three levels:

1. `test_checksum_round_trip` — Python recomputes CRC32 independently and checks it matches
2. Shared fixture files (`tests/fixtures/`) — both suites read the same pre-generated JSON files
3. Live subprocess tests — `mss_cli` (C++ binary) writes a file that Python reads, and vice versa; runs in the `compat` CI job

### Public API is `State` + `Store` only

Internal helpers (`state_to_string` in C++, `_canonical` / `_checksum` in Python)
are not part of the public API and must not be called from outside their modules.

### Writing `UNKNOWN` is rejected

`write(UNKNOWN)` returns `false` / `False` and does nothing.
`UNKNOWN` is a read-only error state that signals the system to block both driving and OTA.

### `force_write` is identical to `write` in implementation

The distinction is documented intent only: `force_write` is reserved for
CLI / maintenance tooling and must not be called from application logic.

### Checksum target

CRC32 is computed over `"{version}|{state}|{timestamp}"` (e.g. `"1|ON|1760000000"`).
Only the semantically meaningful fields are checksummed, not the full JSON.
