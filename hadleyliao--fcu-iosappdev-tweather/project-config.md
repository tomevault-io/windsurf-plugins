# Gemini Project: TWeather

## Project Overview

This is a SwiftUI application named TWeather. Based on the file structure and content, it appears to be a basic iOS application created with Xcode.

The application uses SwiftUI for the user interface and SwiftData for data persistence. The main entry point is `TWeatherApp.swift`, which sets up the main window and the SwiftData model container. The main user interface is defined in `ContentView.swift`, which currently displays a list of items with timestamps. Users can add and delete items from this list.

The project is configured to run on both iPhone and iPad (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2"`).

## Building and Running

This is a standard Xcode project. To build and run the application:

1.  Open the `TWeather.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
2.  Select a simulator or a connected device.
3.  Click the "Run" button.

Alternatively, you can build the project from the command line using `xcodebuild`:

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme TWeather -sdk iphonesimulator build
```

## Development Conventions

*   **Language:** The project is written in Swift, using the SwiftUI framework.
*   **Data Persistence:** The project uses SwiftData for local data storage. The data model is defined in `Item.swift`.
*   **Project Structure:** The project follows the default Xcode project structure.
*   **Dependencies:** There are no external package dependencies specified in the project file.
