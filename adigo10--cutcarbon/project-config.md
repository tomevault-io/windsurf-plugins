# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running the Application

```bash
# Backend API + production-style frontend serving
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build React frontend so FastAPI can serve it at /
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# Run backend (auto-reload)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Access points
# FastAPI-served frontend: http://localhost:8000/
# Swagger docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
# Health check: http://localhost:8000/health

# Frontend development server (optional, for React work)
cd frontend
npm run dev
# React dev UI: http://localhost:5173/
```

## Environment Variables

Set in `.env` at project root:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — required for chat co-pilot
- `TINYFISH_API_KEY` — required for web agent data refresh
- `OPENAI_MODEL` — defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`
- `DATABASE_URL` — defaults to `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./cutcarbon.db`; swap to `postgresql+asyncpg://...` for Postgres

## Architecture

**Backend**: FastAPI (async) with four routers under `app/routers/`:
- `chat.py` — `POST /api/chat` — AI co-pilot using OpenAI function calling to extract structured event data from natural language
- `scenarios.py` — CRUD, clone, and reduction suggestions for emission scenarios
- `financial.py` — Carbon tax savings, green incentives, and compliance reports by region
- `agents.py` — Triggers TinyFish web agents to refresh emission factors from live sources

**Services layer** (`app/services/`):
- `emissions_engine.py` — Deterministic GHG Protocol calculations (travel, venue energy, accommodation, catering, waste). All emission factors loaded from `app/data/emission_factors.json`
- `financial_engine.py` — Carbon tax savings by region (SG, EU, UK, AU, USA), incentive matching, compliance scoring. Data from `app/data/tax_incentives.json`
- `openai_service.py` — Chat with function calling tools (`update_event_scenario`, `request_financial_analysis`) to convert plain text into structured `EventScenarioInput`
- `tinyfish_agent.py` — 10 TinyFish web agents that fetch live emission factors and carbon prices from EMA, DEFRA, EPA eGRID, EEA, Clean Energy Regulator AU, NEA, Ember Climate, UK Government, ICAO, and Our World in Data, then merge results back into `emission_factors.json` with provenance. See `TINYFISH_AGENTS.md` for full specifications.

**Data flow**: Chat input -> OpenAI extracts structured data -> Emissions engine calculates -> Financial engine prices carbon -> Compliance engine scores against frameworks (GHG Protocol, ISO 20121, SBTi, SGX, EU CSRD)

**Database**: SQLAlchemy async ORM (`app/models/database.py`). Tables auto-created on startup via `init_db()`. Key models: `EventDB`, `ScenarioDB`, `ChatMessageDB`, `FinancialReportDB`, `EmissionFactorDB`, `AgentRunDB`. SQLite locally; Postgres-ready.

**Schemas**: All Pydantic request/response models in `app/models/schemas.py`. Key enums: `TravelMode`, `TravelClass`, `AccommodationType`, `CateringType`, `GridRegion`.

**Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript single-page app in `frontend/`, bundled with Vite.
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` — app shell, auth/session state, tab orchestration, API workflows
- `frontend/src/components/` — dashboard widgets, charts, tab views, and UI primitives
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` — typed fetch helpers for FastAPI endpoints
- `frontend/dist/` — production build served by FastAPI at `/` when present
- `static/` — legacy fallback UI kept for compatibility while the React app becomes the default

**Static data files** (`app/data/`):
- `emission_factors.json` — Factor catalog with source URLs and methodology tags (ICAO, DEFRA, IEA, etc.)
- `tax_incentives.json` — Carbon tax rates, exchange rates, green incentives, and compliance framework penalties by region

## Key Design Decisions

- Emission calculations are fully deterministic (no LLM involvement) — the LLM only handles natural language extraction and suggestions
- Supports "basic" mode (proxy-heavy estimates from attendee count) and "advanced" mode (detailed supplier data)
- Data quality tracked per scenario: "estimated", "partial", or "verified"
- TinyFish agents store provenance (source URL, fetch time, run_id) when updating factors
- CORS is wide open (`allow_origins=["*"]`) — tighten for production
- No test suite currently exists
- No Alembic migrations in use — tables auto-created on startup
