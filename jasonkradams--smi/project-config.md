# Git Workflow Standards

When working on any new plan or feature, follow this git workflow consistently.

## Branch Naming Convention

Create new branches with conventional prefixes:

```bash
# ✅ GOOD
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
git checkout -b chore/update-dependencies
git checkout -b fix/login-validation-bug
git checkout -b docs/api-documentation

# ❌ BAD
git checkout -b my-changes
git checkout -b update
```

**Prefixes:**

- `feature/` - New features or capabilities
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks (deps, config, tooling)
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring without behavior changes
- `test/` - Test additions or updates

## Commit Practice

### Atomic Commits

Make small, focused commits that change one thing at a time:

```bash
# ✅ GOOD - Each commit is atomic
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication endpoint"
git commit -m "test: add tests for authentication"
git commit -m "docs: update API docs with auth endpoints"

# ❌ BAD - Too many changes in one commit
git commit -m "add auth, fix bugs, update docs"
```

### Conventional Commits

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Common types:**

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test changes
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `ci:` - CI/CD changes

**Examples:**

```bash
# ✅ GOOD
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT token validation"
git commit -m "fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint"
git commit -m "chore(deps): update lodash to 4.17.21"
git commit -m "docs: update README with setup instructions"

# ❌ BAD
git commit -m "changes"
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "WIP"
```

## Pull Request Workflow

After completing your work:

1. **Push your branch:**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Use descriptive PR title following conventional commit format
   - Include summary of changes
   - Reference related issues if applicable
   - Request reviews from team members

## Workflow Checklist

Before creating a PR, ensure:

- [ ] Branch follows naming convention
- [ ] All commits are atomic and focused
- [ ] All commits follow conventional commit format
- [ ] Code has been tested
- [ ] Branch is pushed to origin
- [ ] PR is created with clear description
