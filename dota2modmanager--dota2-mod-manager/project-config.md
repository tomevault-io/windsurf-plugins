# Working on this project with an AI assistant

This file is for coding agents, and for the people running them. It is public because the
policy is public: assistants are welcome here, the project is written with one, and pretending
otherwise would help nobody.

There is one hard rule, and it is at the bottom under **Attribution**. Read that first if you
read nothing else.

## What this is

A desktop mod manager for Dota 2. Electron 44 on Node 24, plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the
renderer — **no bundler, no framework, no build step for the UI**. If a change would need
webpack, TypeScript compilation or a component library, it is the wrong change.

```
main.js            app lifecycle, window, auto-update. Nothing else belongs here
preload.js         the only bridge the renderer gets. Every channel is listed once
src/               everything that thinks: installer, vpk, schema, gamelang, catalog…
src/ipc-*.js       one file per group of channels, each naming what it needs
renderer/          the UI. views/ draw screens, ui/ are shared pieces, core/ is state
test/              node:test, no framework, no mocks library
tools/             scripts that are not shipped: fingerprints, i18n check, sandbox
site/              the documentation site (Astro). Separate from the app
```

## Before you change anything

**Read `ARCHITECTURE.md`.** It says which file owns which decision, and most wrong changes here
are changes made in the wrong file.

**Read `DECISIONS.md` before you call something a flaw.** It lists what was decided on purpose and
what the rejected alternative cost, what is genuinely missing, and which criticisms keep coming
back after they stopped being true. Every entry carries a command that settles it. If you are
here to review rather than to change something, that file is the whole brief.

**Do not read whole source files to orient yourself.** Find the symbol, then read its slice.
`main.js` and `src/installer.js` are large and reading them end to end wastes more than it
tells you.

**The domain is unusual and the obvious assumption is usually wrong.** Three examples that have
each cost real time:

- Dota mounts **one** language folder, named after the **voice** language, and a `-language` in
  Steam's launch options outranks the game's own setting. `src/gamelang.js` opens with the full
  rule. It is the rule, not a summary of one; change it only by measuring.
- `items_game.txt` is ~50 MB with non-UTF8 bytes in it. `src/schema.js` works on latin1 strings
  on purpose. A round trip through a "cleaner" encoding mangles it.
- A pak slot decides which of two mods the game loads. Lower wins. `src/installer.js` allocates
  them, and 65 to 67 are never handed out because another program writes them.

## How to know your change works

```bash
npm run lint              # eslint: names that do not exist, not style
npm test                  # node:test, no dependencies
npm run test:coverage     # the same with the floor CI enforces
node tools/check-i18n.js  # every Russian string has an English twin
npm run sandbox:seed      # a throwaway game tree with real mods in it
npm run start:sandbox     # the app against that tree, never against a real game
```

**Never point the app at a real Dota installation to test.** The sandbox exists because that
mistake is expensive: `sandbox/` is a disposable copy of the game's folder shape, and
`npm run start:sandbox` runs against it with its own user data.

For a UI change, `MM_SHOT=<path>` takes a screenshot after load; `MM_EVAL=<js>` writes the
answer to a question about the finished DOM beside it. Both are dev-only and documented at the
top of `main.js`. A screenshot proves a layout; `MM_EVAL` proves the text, the language and the
state, and it is the one that catches real bugs.

## What the tests will not let you do

Four of them check the project against itself rather than checking code:

- `test/ipc-contract.test.js` — every channel the renderer can call has a handler, every
  handler is reachable, none registered twice, every `src/ipc-*.js` wired into main.
- `test/release-contract.test.js` — the version, both changelogs and what CI reads all agree.
- `test/coverage.test.js` — which mod supplies a file when two carry the same path.
- `tools/check-i18n.js` — no Russian string without an English one.

If one of these fails, the fix is almost never the test.

## House style

- **Comments say why, not what.** A comment that restates the line below it is noise; a comment
  naming the bug that produced the line is worth more than the line.
- **Both languages, always.** Russian is the source, English is keyed by the exact Russian
  string. A new user-facing string without its twin fails `check-i18n`.
- **Errors are for people.** "Свободных слотов pakNN не осталось" beats "ENOENT".
- **Anything that needs the network fails quietly.** The app has to work offline with what it
  cached. A feature that throws because GitHub is unreachable is a bug.
- **Writing into the game folder is a transaction.** `src/file-tx.js`. If a step fails,
  everything goes back, including files displaced to make room.
- No emoji in code, comments, commits, UI or documentation.
