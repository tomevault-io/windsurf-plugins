# Action on Issues

## Don't Claim Fixed Until It Works

Never say "X is fixed" or "resolved" if anything still fails. The issue is not fixed until it all works end-to-end.

- ❌ "The build errors are fixed. The app failed to launch for an unrelated reason."
- ❌ "Root cause fixed. There's still a runtime error."
- ✅ Fix until it works, or say "X is fixed but Y still fails — working on Y now."

If something blocks verification, fix that first or say explicitly what's blocking and what's done.

## Take Action on Known Issues

When you notice a bug, code smell, or other problem—related or not—do one of:

1. **Add to a task** – Use the todo tool
2. **Fix it** – If quick and doesn't derail the current work
3. **Prompt the user** – "I noticed [issue]. Fix it now or add to backlog?"

Never only comment. No "by the way, there's also..." without action or a clear offer.
