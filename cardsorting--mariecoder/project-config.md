# MarieCoder Development Standards

> *Guidance, not gospel. Pause, reflect, and choose with intention. Continuous evolution over perfection.*

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Inspired by KonMari Method**: We approach code with Marie Kondo's mindfulness—honoring what served us, learning from it, and evolving with gratitude. Philosophy guides our thinking; clarity guides our code.

### Before Any Change - Three Questions:

1. **What purpose did this serve?** (Observe with curiosity)
2. **What has this taught us?** (Learn with gratitude)  
3. **What brings clarity now?** (Choose with intention)

### Six-Step Evolution Process:

When code has completed its purpose:

1. **OBSERVE** - Understand why it exists and what it taught us
2. **APPRECIATE** - Honor the problems it solved
3. **LEARN** - Extract wisdom from patterns and friction
4. **EVOLVE** - Build clearer implementations with those lessons
5. **RELEASE** - Let go of old code once new path is stable
6. **SHARE** - Document lessons in commit messages

**Example Commit Message**:
```
feat: Migrate to established authentication library

Previous custom auth taught us session invalidation 
and OAuth edge cases. Evolving to battle-tested solution.

Lessons applied:
- Robust session management required
- OAuth needs comprehensive error handling
- Security updates must be timely
```

## 📝 Naming Standards (Non-Negotiable)

### Files - MUST use snake_case:
```
✅ prompt_manager.ts
✅ response_formatters.ts
✅ context_summarization.ts
❌ PromptRegistry.ts (wrong case)
❌ loadMcpDocumentation.ts (camelCase)
```

**Use descriptive verbs**: `manager`, `builder`, `optimizer`, `organizer`, `validator`  
**Use clear nouns**: `prompt`, `variant`, `template`, `tool`, `response`

### Variables & Functions:
- **MUST be self-explanatory** without comments
- **NO abbreviations** (except: `id`, `url`, `api`)
- **Indicate type/purpose**: `getUserById()`, `isValidEmail()`, `userCount`

---

## 🔧 Type Safety & Quality (Required)

### Non-Negotiable Rules:

✅ **DO**:
- Use specific types (never `any` without explicit justification)
- Validate ALL inputs before database operations
- Write tests for public methods (target 80%+ coverage)
- Add JSDoc to all public APIs
- Create actionable error messages with fix guidance

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use `any` type casually
- Skip input validation
- Leave public APIs undocumented
- Write vague error messages

### Error Handling Pattern (Required):

```typescript
// ALWAYS include actionable guidance in error messages
async function createUser(data: CreateUserData): Promise<User> {
  try {
    if (!data.email) {
      throw new Error(
        'Email required. Please provide a valid email address'
      )
    }
    
    if (!isValidEmail(data.email)) {
      throw new Error(
        'Invalid email format. Please provide a valid email address (e.g., user@example.com)'
      )
    }
    
    return await this.repository.create(data)
  } catch (error) {
    // Re-throw validation errors with context
    if (error instanceof Error) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to create user: ${error.message}`)
    }
    throw error
  }
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Standards

### Core Principles:

- **Separation of Concerns** - Separate data access from business logic
- **Service Layer** - Only when business logic complexity justifies it
- **Organize by Feature** - Group related functionality together (not by technical type)
- **Composition Over Creation** - Prefer proven libraries over custom implementations

### Example Pattern:

```typescript
// Data Access Layer
export class UserRepository {
  async findByEmail(email: string): Promise<User | null> {
    // Database-specific implementation
    return await this.queryUserByEmail(email.toLowerCase())
  }
}

// Service Layer (when business logic complexity justifies it)
export class UserService {
  constructor(private repo: UserRepository) {}
  
  async createUser(data: CreateUserData): Promise<User> {
    const user = await this.repo.create(data)
    await this.sendWelcomeEmail(user.email)
    return user
  }
}
```

## ⚡ Performance Standards

### Target Benchmarks:

- **Response Times**: Aim for <100ms for user-facing operations
- **Database Queries**: Target <50ms per query
- **API Endpoints**: Strive for <200ms response time

### Performance Principles:

- **Measure First** - Profile before optimizing
- **Cache Strategically** - Cache expensive operations, not everything
- **Optimize Queries** - Ensure proper indexing and query efficiency
- **Load Progressively** - Show content incrementally when appropriate
- **Handle Errors Gracefully** - Implement proper error boundaries

## ✅ Quality Checklist

### Before Starting:
- [ ] Understand existing code and patterns
- [ ] Plan clear, descriptive names
- [ ] Design error handling with actionable messages
- [ ] Consider architecture (repositories, services)
- [ ] Identify performance requirements

### During Development:
- [ ] Strict TypeScript (no casual `any`)
- [ ] Self-documenting names
- [ ] Actionable error messages
- [ ] Validate all inputs
- [ ] Write tests (80%+ target)
- [ ] JSDoc on public APIs

### Performance:
- [ ] Response times <100ms for user-facing operations
- [ ] Database queries <50ms
- [ ] Proper caching strategies implemented
- [ ] Error boundaries in place

### Before Completing:
- [ ] All linter errors resolved
- [ ] Names immediately clear
- [ ] Changes documented in commit
- [ ] Patterns applied system-wide
- [ ] Tests passing

## 🎯 Implementation Workflows

### New Features:
1. **Reflect** → Study existing patterns
2. **Plan** → Design with type safety and performance
3. **Implement** → Build with clear names and validation
4. **Test** → Cover public APIs (80%+ target)
5. **Document** → JSDoc and commit messages with context

### Refactoring:
1. **Observe** → What patterns completed their purpose?
2. **Learn** → What lessons does this offer?
3. **Envision** → What would serve better?
4. **Evolve** → Implement new pattern
5. **Release** → Remove old code once stable
6. **Document** → Share lessons learned

### Bug Fixes:
1. **Understand** → Find root cause, not just symptom
2. **Fix** → Address underlying issue
3. **Test** → Prevent regression
4. **Document** → Share discovery
5. **Strengthen** → Add type safety/validation to prevent recurrence

## 🙏 Mindset

**Before each session**, remember:

*"I honor the code before me. I learn from every pattern. 'Legacy' was once innovative. I refactor not as criticism, but evolution. I write for clarity. I release with gratitude. I document what we learned. Every commit cares for future developers."*

### The Path:

- **Honor existing work** → Learn from it before changing it
- **Compose over create** → Use proven tools and libraries over custom implementations
- **Simplify with compassion** → Evolution, not demolition
- **System-wide changes** → Address patterns everywhere, not piecemeal
- **Natural order** → Architecture → Naming → Tests → Performance → Documentation

### Remember:

This isn't about perfection or ruthlessness—it's about **intentional, compassionate improvement**.

- We **release** code because we learned better ways (not because we hate it)
- We **evolve** to honor lessons (not to criticize past decisions)
- We **practice** clarity habits (not enforce rigid rules)

**Be gentle with yourself. Be gentle with the code. Be gentle with those who came before.**

Each small act of care compounds into a codebase that brings clarity and ease.
