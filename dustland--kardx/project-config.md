# Kardx Unity C# Development Guidelines

## Project Context

This project is a Unity-based 3D tower defense game utilizing C# for scripting. The game incorporates a unique control scheme using the Nintendo Ring-Con accessory. Players place turrets and then engage in physical activities to charge up those turrets.

## Coding Standards

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Use `PascalCase` for class names and public members.
  - Use `camelCase` for private variables and method parameters.

- **Code Structure**:
  - Organize scripts into folders based on their functionality (e.g., `Controllers`, `Models`, `Views`).
  - Include XML documentation comments for all public methods and classes.

## Design Patterns

- Implement the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern where applicable.
- Utilize `ScriptableObject` for managing game data and configurations.
- Employ object pooling for managing enemies and projectiles to optimize performance.
- Use Unity's event system to handle player input and game events.

## Performance Guidelines

- Optimize all assets to ensure the game runs smoothly on target platforms.
- Minimize the use of `Update()` methods; prefer event-driven architectures.
- Use LOD (Level of Detail) groups for complex models to improve rendering performance.
- Profile the game regularly to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

## Testing and Debugging

- Write unit tests for all critical game logic using the NUnit framework.
- Use Unity's built-in Profiler to monitor performance during playtesting.
- Implement comprehensive logging for key game events to facilitate debugging.
- Ensure all scenes have been thoroughly playtested before committing changes.
