# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Development servers
pnpm dev                  # Run both Worker and Web in parallel
pnpm dev:worker           # Worker only (Cloudflare Workers dev server)
pnpm dev:web              # Web only (Vite dev server)

# Development verification (run before committing)
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build

# Local D1 database management
pnpm db:init:worker       # Bootstrap local D1 (required before first Worker run)
pnpm db:migrate:worker    # Run pending migrations on local D1

# Targeted test runs
pnpm test:worker          # Worker unit tests only
pnpm test:web             # Web unit tests only
pnpm test:shared          # Shared package tests only
pnpm test:worker:integration   # Worker integration tests
pnpm test:web:integration      # Web integration tests
pnpm test:e2e             # Playwright E2E tests (requires preview server)
pnpm test:e2e:install     # Install Playwright Chromium browser

# Run a single test file
pnpm --dir apps/worker exec vitest run tests/path/to/file.test.ts
pnpm --dir apps/web exec vitest run src/path/to/file.test.ts

# OpenAPI spec generation
pnpm openapi:generate     # Generate docs/openapi.yaml from code
```

`pnpm lint|typecheck|test|build` all route through `scripts/run-task.mjs`, which
fans out to each workspace package. Append `--filter <shared|worker|web>` to
scope a task (e.g., `pnpm test --filter worker`). The `build` target for the
Worker is `wrangler deploy --dry-run`, not a bundler.

## Architecture

This is a **pnpm monorepo** for a disposable email service:

```
apps/web/      # React 19 + Vite frontend
apps/worker/   # Cloudflare Worker backend (Hono framework)
packages/shared/  # Shared types, constants, pure functions only
```

### Worker runtime entry points (`apps/worker/src/index.ts`)

The Worker exposes three independent triggers — every change must consider all
three if it touches shared state:

| Handler | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `fetch` | HTTP requests | Hono app created via `createApp()` in `app/create-app.ts` |
| `email` | Cloudflare Email Routing inbound | `processInboundEmail()` parses and stores incoming mail |
| `scheduled` | Cron Trigger | `runCleanup()` expires old messages/sessions |

All three resolve bindings through the same `AppBindings` (see `core/bindings.ts`)
and persist through a D1 store constructed by `infrastructure/persistence/d1`.

### Frontend layers (`apps/web/src/`)

| Layer | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app/` | Bootstrap, routing, global state orchestration |
| `pages/` | Page-level composition only — no direct fetch logic |
| `features/` | Business domains: `auth`, `inbox`, `settings`, `admin`, `accounts`, `announcements`, `dashboard`, `landing`, `outbound` |
| `shared/` | API client, styles, hooks, UI primitives — no business logic |
| `test/` | Test setup and integration tests |

Dependency direction: `app → pages → features → shared`. Pages must not depend on other pages.

### Backend layers (`apps/worker/src/`)

| Layer | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app/` | Route registration, request/response mapping, use case orchestration (`routes/`, `use-cases/`, `services/`, `mappers/`) |
| `core/` | Type contracts, Cloudflare bindings, context definitions — no implementations |
| `infrastructure/` | D1 database, R2 storage, external service integrations |
| `shared/` | Email parsing (postal-mime), security utilities, pure helpers |

Dependency direction: `app → core/infrastructure/shared`. Infrastructure must not depend on `app/`.

### Shared package (`packages/shared/`)

Only allowed: shared types, constants, pure functions with no side effects.
Not allowed: DOM operations, Cloudflare bindings, database logic, runtime-specific code.

## Key Conventions

**Naming:**
- Files: `kebab-case.ts` for TS/Worker files, `PascalCase.tsx` for React components
- Variables/functions: `camelCase` with semantic names (`refreshSession`, not `data`)
- Types/interfaces: `PascalCase` reflecting boundary and role
- Booleans: `is`, `has`, `can`, `should` prefixes
- Event handlers: `handleXxx`
- Directories: `kebab-case`; no semantic-free names like `misc`, `common2`, `temp`

**Code style:**
- 2-space indentation, double quotes, LF line endings, UTF-8 (no BOM)
- Import order: third-party → workspace packages (`@wemail/shared`) → relative paths
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*; required for platform constraints, security logic, counter-intuitive implementations

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for pure functions; integration tests for routes/services; E2E for critical page flows
- Test names describe behavior: `"requires a valid invite for registration"`, not `"test 1"`
- Frontend tests in `src/test/`; Worker tests in `tests/`

**Architecture enforcement:**
- If a file's correct location is unclear, clarify the boundary in a README before writing code
- Every key directory has a `README.md` — update it when restructuring
- Route handlers: receive params, check auth, call use case, return response — no business logic inline
- All API calls from frontend go through `shared/api/`
