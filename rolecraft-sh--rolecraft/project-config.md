# rolecraft — Development Guidelines

> 📖 Agent discovery paths are in [`docs/agents.md`](./docs/agents.md)

## ⚠️ STARTUP CHECKLIST (read before every task)

1. `git checkout main && git pull` — start from latest main
2. `git checkout -b feat/my-feature` or `fix/my-bug` — create branch
3. Do all work on the feature branch (never on main)
4. `npm run lint` — check syntax before pushing
5. `npm test` — run tests
6. Never leave changes that break tests
7. Write tests for new features
8. Update docs (README, docs/) when needed
9. Test `--dry-run` flag if the feature supports it
10. `git add ... && git commit -m "type: short description"` — title only, no body
11. `git push -u origin <branch>` — push
12. `gh pr create` — open PR with short one-sentence body
13. Before merging, wait for all GitHub Actions checks to pass (`gh run watch` or check PR status). Never merge while checks are running.

## Workflow
- Before starting any task, ensure you're on `main` with latest changes (`git checkout main && git pull`), then create a new branch specific to the task (`git checkout -b feat/my-feature` or `fix/my-bug`)
- Complete all work on the feature branch
- After completing the work, run `npm run lint` and the tests: `node --test --test-concurrency=1`
- Never leave changes that break tests
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation (README, docs/) when needed
- Test the `--dry-run` flag if the feature supports it
- After tests pass, commit the changes (title only, no body), push the branch, and open a PR (one-sentence body)
- Before merging, wait for all GitHub Actions checks to pass (`gh run watch` or check PR status). Never merge while checks are running.

## Interaction rules
- **Chat vs dev mode:** Before writing any code, confirm whether the user wants development or just information. Ask: "Are you asking me to develop something or just asking for information?"
- **Commit messages:** Title only, no body. Example: `feat: add rolecraft mcp check command`
- **PR body:** One-sentence summary. Example: "Adds rolecraft mcp check command for npm update checks."
- **Branch strategy:** Always branch from latest main for any work that requires a commit, unless the user explicitly says otherwise.

## Code style
- Keep the zero-dependency principle for runtime (don't add production deps)
- DevDependencies (Biome, VitePress) are allowed — they never ship to users
- Use ES modules (`import`/`export`, no `require`)
- Prefer built-in modules like `node:fs`, `node:path`
- Tests are written with `node:test` and `node:assert`
- Formatting is enforced by Biome (`biome.json`): 2-space indent, single quotes, no semicolons
- Linting is enforced by Biome: `noUnusedVariables`, `noUnusedImports`, `noUnreachable` are errors

## Linting rules
- `npm run lint` runs `node --check` (syntax) then `biome check` (semantic + format)
- Must be zero errors before pushing — CI fails on lint errors
- Run `npx biome check --write` to auto-fix formatting and unused imports
- Run `npx biome check --write --unsafe` for unsafe fixes (review the diff before committing)
- Common CodeQL-equivalent traps Biome catches before push: `js/unused-local-variable`, `js/redundant-operation`, unreachable code
- Biome does NOT catch security issues like `js/http-to-file-access`, `js/log-injection`, `js/insecure-temporary-file` — keep CodeQL enabled in CI for those
