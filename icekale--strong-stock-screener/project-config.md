# AGENTS.md

This is an independent strong-stock screener, not the daily-report app.

- Keep screening status separate from watchlist risk action.
- Never add `empty` as a new-stock screening status.
- `risk_action = "empty"` is only for watchlist or holding risk.
- Keep TickFlow scoped to this screener unless the user explicitly asks to change the daily-report app.
- Prefer small, focused files and tests-first changes.
