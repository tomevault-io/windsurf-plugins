# AGENTS.md

OpenCode compatibility entrypoint for `discord-pals`. Keep this file in parity with [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) when project instructions change.

## Development Principles

**Dashboard-first:** All features must be built with the web dashboard in mind. New configuration options, runtime settings, or data structures should be viewable and editable through the dashboard UI. Don't add backend-only config that requires manual JSON editing.

## Version Bump Checklist

**When bumping a version, ALL of these must be updated together:**

1. **version.py** - Update `__version__` string
2. **CHANGELOG.md** - Add new version section with:
   - Version number and date
   - Categorized changes (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Reverted)
   - All changes since last version
3. **README.md** - Update any version references if applicable
4. **Git tag** - Create tag matching version (e.g., `v1.4.5`)

## After Making Changes

**Always do these steps automatically after completing any code changes:**

1. **Bump version FIRST** - Run `python bump_version.py patch --tag` BEFORE committing
   - Use `patch` for bug fixes
   - Use `minor` for new features
   - Use `major` for breaking changes
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** - Add entry for new version with ALL changes
3. **Commit** - Stage and commit all changes (including version.py and CHANGELOG.md) with a descriptive message
4. **Push to GitHub** - Push both commits and tags:
   ```bash
   git push origin main && git push origin --tags
   ```

**CRITICAL: Version bump MUST happen before commit.** If you commit first, the version.py file won't be included and the release will have the wrong version number.

Do not wait for the user to ask - complete all steps immediately after any fix or feature is done.

## Commit Message Format

Use clear, concise commit messages. Always include the new version number in the commit message or push output so it's visible in the conversation.

Example:
```
Fix restart logic for systemd environments (v1.4.1)
```

## Files to Track for Version Changes

When making changes, ensure these are kept in sync:
- `version.py` - Source of truth for version number
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Human-readable change history
- Git tags - For release tracking
