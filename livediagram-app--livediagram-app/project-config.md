# livediagram

Monorepo for the livediagram product. Multiple apps share code through internal packages.

## Before you start

- `git fetch` latest from origin

## Organisation process

This section describes the process of organising and layering empirical information.
It guides the engineering efforts by having agents specify with sufficient detail.
The goal is for agents to become increasingly self-sufficient when working on systems they already know.

This is achieved by iteratively capturing contextual information about the domain and documenting intentions from humans.

This section is exclusively human-hand-written; agents MUST NOT edit this section directly.

### Structure

Use the following structure and rationale.

- `AGENTS.md` instructs us about **how we work**.
- `plans/` contains plans; **exhaustive list of checkboxed steps**.
- `docs/` holds all **documentation** files.
- `docs/README.md` is the entry point.

Within `docs/` are the following special categories:

- `specs/` contains **specifications**: _what a thing IS_.
- `specs/[...]/blueprints/` contains **blueprints**: _exhaustively documented implementation details_.
- `instructions/` contains **instruction sets**: _empirically built repeatable processes_.

**Indexes** are held inside `README.md` files. Entries look like: `- ./<file>.md - when <trigger>`.
`README.md` files open with `Follow the references below only as needed; never upfront.`

Further details below.

### Docs

- Docs are structured as `docs/<category>/<topic>.md`
- They are indexed under `docs/README.md`.
- The docs index includes entry points to `specs` and `instructions`.
- Docs convey information in scope of the project.
- All docs SHOULD be treated as persistent documents that can be iterated on.
- Stay cognizant of the deltas of each change.
- Reuse documents where it makes sense.
- Folders of substance SHOULD hold a `README.md` with an index.
- Docs, indexes and references **MUST be continuously kept-up-to-date** throughout all work.

### Plans

- Plans live as a single Markdown file in the main checkout's `plans/` folder, numbered `0001-<topic>.md`.
- They live inside the `plans/` folder, which MAY be **gitignored** (recommended).
- Plans describe **work**, split into sequenced **phases** of checkboxed **steps**:.
  - **work** includes research, specification, building, testing, verification, definition of done, and anything else that's needed.
  - **phases** are logical increments, warranting a commit each.
  - **steps** MUST be performed with full focus, and in the highest qualitative and idiomatic way.
  - **checkboxes** MUST be checked off immediately upon completion of any step, and before starting the next step.
- A plan MAY link to blueprints and specs (encouraged), but SHALL NOT restate them.
- The last step of every plan MUST be **fold-back**; to let the documentation reflect reality, and to verify all symbols/files/references.
- Fold-back reconciles the spec to what actually shipped, then re-derives the blueprint from it.
- Plans SHALL NOT be renumbered.

**When to use plans?**

- Default to no plan. Just do the work for tasks that fit in a single sitting.
- Create a plan when asked or when work is likely to exceed one or two days.
- Surface ambiguities and gaps before implementing, and keep refining the plan as new information arrives.

**Work plans one task at a time**

1. Read the step,
2. Do it the best, highest qualitative and idiomatic way possible
3. Upon completion immediately tick the checkbox; never batch ticks at the end.
4. Then move to the next step.

_Note:_ There is no need to stop in between phases; just keep going.

### Specs

- Specs live inside numbered **category folders** `docs/specs/NNN-<category>/`.
- They are indexed under `docs/specs/README.md`.
- Specs are where design decisions are made and recorded.
- Specs describe **what a thing IS** within the domain; the definitions and specifications of **systems** or **domain concepts**.
- Specs are written in the present tense.
- Specs themselves are unnumbered.
- Specs are never task lists and carry no checkboxes.
- Spec files SHOULD be unnumbered and named by subject; a category MAY hold several related specs.
- Write the spec BEFORE implementing anything non-trivial, and keep it true afterwards.
- Iterate the existing spec rather than adding one on the same subject; stay cognizant of each delta.

**Category folders**

- The first five categories are reserved:
  - `001-project-vision` - the "why": problem, target audience, value proposition.
  - `002-project-scope` - the "what" and "what-not": features, high-level outline, technical constraints, non-goals.
  - `003-system-architecture` - the "how" underneath: data flow, infrastructure, state, language/runtime boundaries.
  - `004-interface-design` - the "how" at the surface: UX/UI, wireframes, user journeys, visual language.
  - `005-project-roadmap` - the "when": milestones as outcomes, phases, launch strategy.
- Further category folders MUST BE named after a **system** or, preferably, a **domain concept**.
- Renumbering is discouraged, but allowed when every reference to it is updated in the same change.
