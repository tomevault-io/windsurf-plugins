description: Backend TypeScript patterns for Express, Zod, and Prisma
---


You are an expert in TypeScript, Express.js, express-zod-api, Prisma ORM, and building scalable REST APIs.

Key Principles

- Use express-zod-api for all endpoint definitions with Zod schemas for validation.
- Keep route handlers thin; delegate business logic to service functions.
- Use Prisma ORM for all database interactions; avoid raw SQL queries.
- Handle errors consistently using http-errors package with appropriate status codes.
- Log all significant operations using the Winston logger, never console.log.

Import Conventions

- Import Zod from `@/utils/zod-openapi`, never from 'zod' directly; this ensures OpenAPI compatibility.
- Import Prisma client from `@/utils/db` as the singleton instance.
- Import generated types from `@/generated/prisma/client` for type safety.
- Use path aliases (`@/`) for all imports; avoid relative paths.
- Do not use unknown-valued map types in backend code; prefer domain-specific interfaces, Prisma JSON/input JSON types, or object-property guard helpers.

Endpoint Development

- Use the appropriate authenticated endpoint factory based on permission level required.
- Use `readAuthenticatedEndpointFactory` for read-only operations.
- Use `payAuthenticatedEndpointFactory` for payment-related operations.
- Use `adminAuthenticatedEndpointFactory` for administrative operations.
- Define input and output schemas explicitly using Zod for automatic validation and documentation.

BigInt Handling

- Use BigInt for all monetary amounts, fees, and lovelace values; never use Number.
- Store BigInt in database; Prisma handles this automatically.
- Convert BigInt to string when returning in API responses; JSON cannot serialize BigInt.
- Use BigInt literals with `n` suffix (e.g., `5000000n`) or `BigInt()` constructor.

Error Handling

- Throw HTTP errors using `createHttpError(statusCode, message)` from http-errors package.
- Use 400 for validation errors, 401 for authentication, 404 for not found, 500 for internal errors.
- Log errors with context using `logger.error(message, { context })`.
- Use `errorToString()` utility to safely convert unknown errors to strings for logging.

Service Pattern

- Create services in `src/services/{name}/{name}.service.ts` structure.
- Use Mutex from async-mutex for operations that require exclusive access.
- Use `tryAcquire(mutex).acquire()` pattern to prevent blocking on mutex acquisition.
- Always release mutex in finally block to prevent deadlocks.
- Use `advancedRetryAll` with `delayErrorResolver` for operations that may need retries.

ID Generation

- Use `createId()` from `@paralleldrive/cuid2` for generating unique identifiers.
- Never use UUID or custom ID generation; cuid2 is the project standard.

Dependencies

- express-zod-api (API framework with Zod validation)
- Prisma (database ORM)
- http-errors (HTTP error handling)
- Winston via `@/utils/logger` (logging)
- async-mutex (concurrency control)
- advanced-retry (retry logic)
- @paralleldrive/cuid2 (ID generation)

Refer to existing endpoints in `src/routes/api/` for implementation patterns.
