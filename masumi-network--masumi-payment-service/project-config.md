description: Security-critical patterns for authentication, encryption, and secret handling
---


You are an expert in application security, encryption, authentication, and secure handling of sensitive data.

Key Principles

- Never log, expose, or store unencrypted secrets, mnemonics, or private keys.
- Use the project's encryption utilities for all sensitive data storage.
- Validate authentication and authorization on every endpoint.
- Follow the principle of least privilege for API key permissions.
- Protect against common vulnerabilities: injection, XSS, CSRF.

Secret Management

- Always encrypt wallet mnemonics before storing using `encrypt()` from `@/utils/security/encryption`.
- Always decrypt wallet mnemonics when needed using `decrypt()` from `@/utils/security/encryption`.
- Never log mnemonic phrases, private keys, or encryption keys.
- Never commit .env files or expose API keys in source code.
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.

API Key Authentication

- All endpoints must use authenticated endpoint factories; no unauthenticated routes.
- The project has three permission levels: Read, ReadAndPay, and Admin.
- Read permission allows read-only access to resources.
- ReadAndPay permission allows read access plus payment operations.
- Admin permission allows full access including administrative operations.
- API keys can be restricted to specific networks; validate network access.

Endpoint Security

- Use `readAuthenticatedEndpointFactory` for endpoints requiring Read permission.
- Use `payAuthenticatedEndpointFactory` for endpoints requiring ReadAndPay permission.
- Use `adminAuthenticatedEndpointFactory` for endpoints requiring Admin permission.
- Use `checkIsAllowedNetworkOrThrowUnauthorized()` to validate network restrictions.
- Throw 401 errors using `createHttpError(401, 'Unauthorized')` for auth failures.

Authentication Flow

- API keys are passed in the `token` header.
- Keys are hashed with SHA256 and looked up in database.
- Validate key status is Active; reject Revoked keys.
- Validate permission level meets endpoint requirements.
- Validate network restrictions if applicable.

Logging Security Events

- Log authentication failures with context but without exposing tokens.
- Include API key ID, requested permission, and endpoint in security logs.
- Never log the actual token value or sensitive request data.
- Use structured logging with `logger.error()` or `logger.warn()`.

Branch Protection

- Never push directly to main or dev branches; use feature branches.
- Pre-push hooks enforce linting and block protected branch pushes.
- All changes should go through pull request review process.

Data Validation

- Validate all input data using Zod schemas before processing.
- Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
- Use parameterized queries through Prisma; never construct raw SQL.
- Validate file paths and prevent path traversal attacks.

Secure Coding Practices

- Use HTTPS for all external API communications.
- Implement proper CORS configuration for API endpoints.
- Set secure headers for HTTP responses.
- Use timing-safe comparison for sensitive string comparisons.
- Handle errors gracefully without exposing internal details to clients.

Refer to `docs/security.md` for detailed security documentation and best practices.
