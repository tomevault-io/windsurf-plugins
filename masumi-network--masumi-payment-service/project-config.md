You are an expert in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and modern frontend development with TanStack Query.

Key Principles

- Write functional components using TypeScript with explicit prop interfaces.
- Use TanStack Query (React Query) for all server state management.
- Leverage React context for global client state; avoid prop drilling.
- Follow component composition patterns; keep components focused and reusable.
- Use Shadcn UI components from `components/ui/` for consistent styling.

Generated Code

- Never manually edit files in `frontend/src/lib/api/generated/`; these are auto-generated from OpenAPI spec.
- Run `cd frontend && pnpm run openapi-ts-latest` after backend API changes to regenerate types.
- Import API types from generated files for type-safe API interactions.
- Do not use unknown-valued map types in frontend code; prefer explicit JSON/object types and runtime property helpers for narrowing `unknown`.

Component Structure

- Place components in `components/{feature}/` directories organized by feature.
- Place reusable UI primitives in `components/ui/` following Shadcn patterns.
- Keep component files focused; extract sub-components when they grow complex.
- Define TypeScript interfaces for props at the top of component files.

Data Fetching

- Use TanStack Query hooks (useQuery, useMutation) for all API calls.
- Define query keys consistently for proper cache invalidation.
- Handle loading, error, and success states explicitly in components.
- Use `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` after mutations to refresh data.

Context Providers

- Use `AppContext` for application-wide state and settings.
- Use `DialogContext` for managing dialog/modal state globally.
- Use `ThemeContext` for theme management.
- Use `SidebarContext` for sidebar navigation state.
- Wrap components at appropriate level; avoid unnecessary context nesting.

Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling; avoid inline styles and CSS modules.
- Follow mobile-first responsive design approach.
- Use Shadcn UI component variants for consistent styling.
- Keep custom styles minimal; leverage existing design system.

State Management

- Prefer server state (TanStack Query) over client state when possible.
- Use React useState for local component state.
- Use React context for shared client state across components.
- Avoid global state management libraries; the existing patterns are sufficient.

Performance

- Use React.memo for expensive components that receive stable props.
- Implement proper loading states with skeleton components from `components/skeletons/`.
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting on non-critical components.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by proper dependency management in hooks.

Dependencies

- Next.js (React framework)
- TanStack Query (server state management)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Shadcn UI (component library)
- React Hook Form (form handling when needed)

Refer to existing components in `frontend/src/components/` for implementation patterns.
