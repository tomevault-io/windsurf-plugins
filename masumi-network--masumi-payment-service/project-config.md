description: Project-wide coding standards for Masumi Payment Service
---


You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Prisma, and Cardano blockchain development.

Key Principles

- Write clear, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes except for services.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability; follow the project's established patterns.
- Use descriptive variable and function names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError, canWithdraw).
- Structure code in a modular way to promote reusability and separation of concerns.

TypeScript Conventions

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for object shapes.
- Use path aliases consistently: `@/*` maps to `src/*`, `@smart-contracts/*` maps to `smart-contracts/*`; never use relative imports like `../../`.
- Prefix unused variables with underscore (e.g., `_error`, `_unused`) to satisfy ESLint.
- Avoid `any` type when possible, but it is allowed in this project when necessary.
- Never introduce unknown-valued map types; use domain types, explicit recursive value types, or property-reader helpers instead.
- Use strict null checks; handle null and undefined explicitly.

Formatting Standards

- Use single quotes for strings, never double quotes.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation, never tabs.
- Include trailing commas in all multi-line structures.
- End all statements with semicolons.
- Maximum line length of 100 characters.
- Run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run format` before committing.

Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `my-service.ts`, `payment-handler.ts`).
- Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, and type aliases.
- Use camelCase for functions, variables, and object properties.
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants and environment variables.

Commit Message Standards

- Follow conventional commits format strictly: `type(scope): description`.
- Types allowed: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, revert, build.
- Keep header under 72 characters; type must be lowercase.
- No period at end of subject line.
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature").

Project Structure

- Routes handle HTTP request/response only; keep them thin.
- Services contain business logic and orchestrate operations.
- Utilities provide reusable helper functions.
- Generated code in `src/generated/` must never be manually edited.

Refer to the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations for specific formatting rules.
