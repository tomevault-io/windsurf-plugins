# Gentleman.Dots AI Agent Skills

> **Single Source of Truth** - This file is the master for all AI assistants.
> Run `./skills/setup.sh` to sync to Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Codex formats.

This repository provides AI agent skills for Claude Code, OpenCode, and other AI assistants.
Skills provide on-demand context and patterns for working with this codebase.

## Quick Start

When working on this project, Claude Code automatically loads relevant skills based on context.
For manual loading, read the SKILL.md file directly.

## Available Skills

### Gentleman.Dots Specific (Repository Skills)

| Skill | Description | File |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `gentleman-bubbletea` | Bubbletea TUI patterns, Model-Update-View, screen navigation | [SKILL.md](skills/gentleman-bubbletea/SKILL.md) |
| `gentleman-trainer` | Vim Trainer RPG system, exercises, progression, boss fights | [SKILL.md](skills/gentleman-trainer/SKILL.md) |
| `gentleman-installer` | Installation steps, interactive/non-interactive modes | [SKILL.md](skills/gentleman-installer/SKILL.md) |
| `gentleman-e2e` | Docker-based E2E testing, multi-platform validation | [SKILL.md](skills/gentleman-e2e/SKILL.md) |
| `gentleman-system` | OS detection, command execution, cross-platform support | [SKILL.md](skills/gentleman-system/SKILL.md) |
| `go-testing` | Go testing patterns, table-driven tests, Bubbletea testing | [SKILL.md](skills/go-testing/SKILL.md) |

> **Note:** User-facing AI skills (React 19, TypeScript, SDD workflow, etc.) are now managed by [gentle-ai](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai).

## Auto-invoke Skills

When performing these actions, **ALWAYS** invoke the corresponding skill FIRST:

| Action | Invoke First | Why |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| Adding new TUI screen | `gentleman-bubbletea` | Screen constants, Model state, Update handlers |
| Creating Vim exercises | `gentleman-trainer` | Exercise structure, module registration, validation |
| Adding installation step | `gentleman-installer` | Step registration, OS handling, error wrapping |
| Writing E2E tests | `gentleman-e2e` | Test structure, Docker patterns, verification |
| Adding OS support | `gentleman-system` | Detection priority, command execution patterns |
| Writing Go tests | `go-testing` | Table-driven tests, teatest patterns |
| Creating new skill | `skill-creator` | Skill structure, naming, frontmatter |

## How Skills Work

1. **Auto-detection**: Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md which contains skill triggers
2. **Context matching**: When editing Go/TUI code, gentleman-bubbletea loads
3. **Pattern application**: AI follows the exact patterns from the skill
4. **First-time-correct**: No trial and error - skills provide exact conventions

## Skill Structure

```

> User-installable skills (React 19, TypeScript, SDD, etc.) are now managed by [gentle-ai](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai).

## Contributing

### Adding a Repository Skill (for this codebase)
1. Read the `skill-creator` skill first
2. Create skill directory under `skills/`
3. Add SKILL.md following the template
4. Register in this file under "Gentleman.Dots Specific"
5. Run `./skills/setup.sh --all` to regenerate

## Project Overview

**Gentleman.Dots** is a dotfiles manager + TUI installer with:
- Go TUI using Bubbletea framework
- RPG-style Vim Trainer
- Multi-platform support (macOS, Linux, Termux)
- Comprehensive E2E testing

See [README.md](README.md) for full documentation.

## Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Orchestrator

### Identity Inheritance
- Keep the SAME mentoring identity, tone, and teaching style defined above.
- Do NOT switch to a generic orchestrator voice when SDD commands are used.
- During SDD flows, keep coaching behavior: explain the WHY, validate assumptions, and challenge weak decisions with evidence.
- Apply SDD rules as an overlay, not a personality replacement.

You are the ORCHESTRATOR for Spec-Driven Development. You coordinate the SDD workflow by launching specialized sub-agents via the Task tool. Your job is to STAY LIGHTWEIGHT - delegate all heavy work to sub-agents and only track state and user decisions.

### Operating Mode
- Delegate-only: You NEVER execute phase work inline.
- If work requires analysis, design, planning, implementation, verification, or migration, ALWAYS launch a sub-agent.
- The lead agent only coordinates, tracks DAG state, and synthesizes results.

### Artifact Store Policy
- `artifact_store.mode`: `engram | openspec | hybrid | none`
- Default: `engram` when available; `openspec` only if user explicitly requests file artifacts; `hybrid` for both backends simultaneously; otherwise `none`.
- `hybrid` persists to BOTH Engram and OpenSpec. Provides cross-session recovery + local file artifacts. Consumes more tokens per operation.
- In `none`, do not write project files. Return results inline and recommend enabling `engram` or `openspec`.

### SDD Commands
- `/sdd-init` - Initialize orchestration context
- `/sdd-explore <topic>` - Explore idea and constraints
