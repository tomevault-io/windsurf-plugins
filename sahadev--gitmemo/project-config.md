# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

GitMemo is split into three main areas. The Rust CLI/core lives at `src/`, with commands in `src/commands`, MCP support in `src/mcp`, storage and Git logic in `src/storage`, and shared services in `src/services`. The Tauri app lives in `desktop/`: React source is in `desktop/src`, native commands are in `desktop/src-tauri/src`, and generated Android artifacts are under `desktop/src-tauri/gen/android`. The website lives in `website/`, with pages and sections in `website/src`. Shared docs, deployment files, plugins, and helper scripts are in `docs/`, `deploy/`, `plugins/`, and `scripts/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `cargo test`: runs Rust unit tests for the CLI/core and desktop command code.
- `cargo check --manifest-path desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: checks the Tauri native crate.
- `pnpm --dir desktop dev`: starts the desktop React/Vite dev server.
- `pnpm --dir desktop build`: generates the changelog, type-checks, and builds the desktop frontend.
- `pnpm --dir desktop tauri dev`: runs the full Tauri desktop app locally.
- `pnpm --dir desktop build:android:arm64`: builds the arm64 Android APK.
- `npm run build --prefix website`: generates LLM docs, builds, and prerenders the website.
- `npm run lint --prefix website`: runs ESLint for the website.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow existing local style. Rust uses standard `rustfmt` conventions, `snake_case` modules/functions, and `PascalCase` types. React/TypeScript files use 2-space indentation, `PascalCase` components, `use*` hook names, and colocated utilities under `desktop/src/utils` or `website/src`. Prefer existing Mantine, Zustand, Tauri command, and i18n patterns instead of introducing new abstractions.

## Atomic Composition & Reuse

All new code should be decomposed into small, atomic units and assembled through composition. For visual work, use the existing base design tokens as the source of truth; derive higher-level tokens or component styles from those base tokens instead of hard-coding near-duplicates. For React/TypeScript work, extract similar behavior into shared components, hooks, or utilities before copying patterns across pages. When touching existing code, if you encounter obvious similar or redundant logic in the same area, refactor it into shared code as part of the change rather than leaving another copy behind.

For desktop UI changes, search `desktop/src/components` and nearby pages before creating local markup that looks like an existing control. Reuse standard components such as `AppHeaders` (`PageHeader`, `PaneHeader`, `PaneTabHeader`), base buttons, icons, empty states, cards, and domain components instead of hand-assembling equivalent structures with shared CSS classes. If a custom structure is truly needed, note the reason in the implementation or final summary and keep it visually aligned with adjacent pages.

## Interactive State & Persistence

For continuous interactions such as dragging sliders, resizing panes, sorting, scrubbing, or pointer-driven adjustments, separate transient draft state from durable application state. Update local component state during the gesture so the UI stays responsive, and commit persistence, Tauri commands, global store refreshes, expensive recomputation, or storage writes only when the user releases, blurs, confirms, or otherwise completes the interaction. Avoid putting network/native calls, `refreshSettings()`, large `sessionStorage` writes, or repeated `localStorage` writes directly in high-frequency handlers like `onChange`, `mousemove`, `pointermove`, or drag callbacks.

## Testing Guidelines

Rust tests are mostly inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules next to the code they validate. Add focused tests when changing storage, sync, datetime parsing, MCP, or search behavior. For frontend changes, run the relevant build command at minimum; add manual verification notes for desktop/mobile UI behavior, especially Android navigation, clipboard, sync, and download flows.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent commits use Conventional Commit prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, and `chore:`; release automation may use `[skip ci]`. Keep commits scoped and imperative, for example `fix: preserve clipboard scroll position`. Pull requests should include a concise summary, validation commands run, linked issues when applicable, and screenshots or screen recordings for UI changes.

For agent-made changes, commit completed work locally, but do not push unless the user explicitly asks for a push.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit real tokens, SSH keys, repository credentials, or local `.gitmemo` data. Treat sync URLs, GitHub tokens, and Android signing material as local configuration. Keep generated build outputs out of commits unless the release process requires them.
