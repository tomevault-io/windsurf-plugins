# rn-iso — agent guide

Quick orientation for AI assistants working in this repo.

## What this is

A Node.js CLI that gives each React Native / Expo project (or git worktree)
its own Metro server and dedicated simulator/emulator, so multiple agents can
work on different projects in parallel without device or port collisions.

State lives in `~/.rn-iso/config.json`, keyed by absolute project path. The
`RN_ISO_HOME` env var redirects this for tests.

## Architecture conventions

- **ESM only.** `"type": "module"`, no transpiler, Node 20+ directly. No
  CommonJS, no `require()`.
- **Single exec wrapper.** All `child_process` calls go through
  `src/exec.js` (`getExecutor()`). Tests inject a mock via `setExecutor()`.
  Anywhere outside `exec.js` that imports `child_process` directly is a bug.
- **Pure parsing separate from invocation.** Functions like `parseSimctlList`,
  `parseAdbDevices`, `selectIosDevice`, `sortSims` are pure and unit-tested;
  the I/O wrappers around them are thin.
- **ASCII in source files.** No em dashes, smart quotes, or check marks in
  `src/`, `bin/`, `test/`. Markdown files (README, SKILL, this file) may use
  them. The hooks have flagged this before.

## File layout

```
bin/cli.js              # commander entry, registers each command module
src/
  exec.js               # mockable child_process wrapper
  config.js             # config CRUD, reservations, sim-usage tracking
  project.js            # project root walk, bundle-id detection (incl. native fallbacks)
  ports.js              # Metro port allocation + reclamation
  runner.js             # script-vs-CLI dispatch, package-manager detection (walks up for monorepos)
  metro.js              # detached Metro spawn, PID + log lifecycle
  sim/
    ios.js              # simctl wrappers, sim selection, sortSims, parseRuntimeVersion
    android.js          # adb/emulator wrappers, AVD selection
  commands/
    ios.js android.js   # the main user-facing commands
    start.js stop.js logs.js
    status.js
    device.js           # `rn-iso device --json` -> agent-device target
    release.js shutdown.js prune.js
    reserve.js unreserve.js
test/
  *.test.js             # `node --test` (no framework)
skill/SKILL.md          # the agent-facing skill
```

## Particularities to remember

### 1. Update `skill/SKILL.md` whenever user-facing behavior changes

The skill is what installed AI agents read to learn how to use the CLI. When
you add a command, change a flag, change picker UX, or alter defaults — open
`skill/SKILL.md` and update the relevant section in the same change. Quick
checklist:

- New command? Add it under "Other useful commands" or its own section if
  meaty (like `reserve`).
- New / changed flag on `ios` or `android`? Update "Core workflow" and
  "Critical rules" if the flag matters for non-interactive agent use.
- Behavior change (e.g., picker now does X)? Update both the
  description and the "When things go wrong" section.

The skill is shipped to users via the curl line in the README; staleness
breaks agent guidance.

### 2. Don't auto-create simulators

`selectIosDevice` returns `needsBoot` only when no unclaimed sim exists at
all. `commands/ios.js` then errors unless `--device-type` is passed. We do
NOT prompt and create on the user's behalf — that was the original UX and
was removed because it accumulated junk sims. The picker only chooses among
EXISTING sims (booted or shutdown). When you change device-selection logic,
preserve this invariant.

### 3. The post-install verification step is intentionally absent

Earlier versions ran `xcrun simctl install/launch` after the build CLI to
work around a wrong-sim bug in `@expo/cli` (since fixed in 54.0.24). That
step caused double-launches and was removed. If you find yourself wanting
to add it back, the upstream bug is the right place to fix things —
`patch-package` for stuck users, not workaround code in `commands/ios.js`.

### 3b. Metro ownership: build CLI by default, rn-iso with `--managed-metro`

By default the build CLI (`expo run:ios` / `react-native run-ios`) starts
Metro on the `--port` we pass — this preserves the interactive bundler UX
humans expect (Expo's keyboard shortcuts, the RN Metro terminal window).

With `--managed-metro`, the build commands start Metro through
`ensureMetro` — detached, PID tracked, output to the per-project log
file — and pass `--no-packager` (RN CLI) / `--no-bundler` (Expo) to the
build CLI so it does not start a second one. The suppression flag is
chosen from `detectScriptCli`, not `isExpo`, because a project can have
`expo` in deps while its script uses the RN CLI. This mode exists for
agents and CI: build-CLI-owned Metro is a child of the invoking shell,
so a finite (often backgrounded) agent shell kills Metro the moment the
command returns, leaving the app installed but unable to load a bundle.
The skill tells agents to always pass the flag.

A historical note on the double-Metro bug: an early pre-spawn attempt was
removed for causing two Metros on one port. That came from pre-spawning
WITHOUT suppressing the build CLI's packager — the suppression flag is
the load-bearing part, and `ensureMetro` additionally no-ops when the
port is already serving. Don't reintroduce pre-spawning without it.
