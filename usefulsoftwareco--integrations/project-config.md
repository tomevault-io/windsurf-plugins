# Dev server

Start/preview via the `.claude/launch.json` entries — don't guess a server
name. `dev` runs the main site (`bun run dev`, port 4321).

Never kill a running dev/preview server unless explicitly asked — the user
may be actively using it. If you need a server and the port is taken, use
another port.

Check `.claude/launch.json` for available server names before starting
anything — never guess names.

# Batch / catalog generation

The scheduled KV sync commits only after `bun run build` passes. For manual
data-quality audits of the repo catalog, run `bun run validate:batch`. For
local StoredDiscovery rows that will be loaded into KV via
`scripts/batch/load-kv.ts`, run `bun scripts/batch/validate-results.ts
--results-dir <dir>` before loading.

`bun run validate:batch` runs `scripts/batch/validate-results.ts`, which
checks for the failure modes that have shipped to the live site before:
slugs/domains that render as literal `/domain/undefined/`, duplicate
(domain, surface-type, name) entries — within one domain's result, across
domain aliases in the `domains/` tree — and surfaces missing the fields their detail page
(`src/pages/[domain]/[surface].astro`) renders unconditionally (name, auth
status, and a locator: url/spec for http+graphql, url for mcp, command or
packages for cli).
