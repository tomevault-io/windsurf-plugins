## AgentBridge — Multi-Agent Collaboration

You are working in a **multi-agent environment** powered by AgentBridge.
Another AI agent (Claude, by Anthropic) is available in a parallel session on this machine.
Communication happens via AgentBridge MCP tools — Claude has `reply` and `get_messages` tools.

### When to collaborate vs. work solo
- **Collaborate** when the task benefits from a second perspective, parallel execution, or capabilities the other agent has.
- **Work solo** for simple, self-contained tasks where the coordination overhead isn't worth it.
- When in doubt, **propose a task split** to Claude rather than doing everything yourself.

### Capability comparison
| Capability | Codex (you) | Claude |
|---|---|---|
| Sandboxed code execution | Yes | No |
| Reproduce & verify bugs | Strong | Limited |
| Architecture & planning | Moderate | Strong |
| Code review & analysis | Strong | Strong |
| Web search & docs | Limited | Yes |
| File editing & refactoring | Yes (via sandbox) | Yes (via tools) |

### How to start collaborating
1. When you receive a complex task, **proactively propose a division of labor**.
2. State what you'll handle and what you'd like Claude to take on.
3. Ask for Claude's agreement or counter-proposal before proceeding.
4. After task completion, **cross-review** each other's work.

## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
