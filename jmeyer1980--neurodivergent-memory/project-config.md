# neurodivergent-memory — Agent Bootstrap Instructions

This file is automatically read by GitHub Copilot and compatible agents at the start of every session.
It replaces the need to fetch the governance memory (`memory_11`) before working with this MCP server.

---

## What this server is

`neurodivergent-memory` is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that stores and retrieves memories as a
knowledge graph. It is designed for neurodivergent thinking patterns: non-linear, associative, tag-rich.

Memories are organised into five **districts** (knowledge domains) and connected via bidirectional edges.
Search uses **BM25 semantic ranking** — no embedding model or cloud LLM required.

---

## Canonical Tag Schema

Always apply tags from the five namespaces below when calling `store_memory`.
Multiple tags from different namespaces are expected on every memory.
When storing execution-heavy memories, include the reasoning behind the action and, when possible, connect the entry to a durable principle in `logical_analysis` or `creative_synthesis` so future retrieval preserves understanding and not just activity.

| Namespace | Purpose | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `topic:X` | Subject matter / domain | `topic:unity-ecs`, `topic:adhd-strategies`, `topic:rust-async` |
| `scope:X` | Breadth of the memory | `scope:concept`, `scope:project`, `scope:session`, `scope:global` |
| `kind:X` | Type of knowledge | `kind:insight`, `kind:decision`, `kind:pattern`, `kind:reference`, `kind:task` |
| `layer:X` | Abstraction level | `layer:architecture`, `layer:implementation`, `layer:debugging`, `layer:research` |
| `persistence:X` | Sync tier eligibility | `persistence:durable` (promote to user/org), `persistence:ephemeral` (project-only) |

**Example tag set for a Unity ECS memory:**
```
["topic:unity-ecs", "topic:dots", "scope:project", "kind:pattern", "layer:architecture"]
```

**Example tag set for a cross-project durable memory:**
```
["topic:typescript", "scope:global", "kind:pattern", "layer:architecture", "persistence:durable"]
```

## Districts

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `logical_analysis` | Structured thinking, analysis, research findings |
| `emotional_processing` | Feelings, emotional states, affective responses |
| `practical_execution` | Tasks, plans, implementations, action items |
| `vigilant_monitoring` | Risks, warnings, constraints, safety concerns |
| `creative_synthesis` | Novel connections, creative ideas, cross-domain insights |

---

## Available MCP Tools (quick reference)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `store_memory` | Create a new memory node |
| `retrieve_memory` | Fetch one memory by ID |
| `update_memory` | Modify content, tags, district, valence, or intensity |
| `delete_memory` | Remove a memory and all its connections |
| `connect_memories` | Add an edge between two memory nodes |
| `search_memories` | BM25-ranked search with optional `min_score`, district, tag, valence, intensity filters |
| `traverse_from` | BFS graph walk from a node up to N hops |
| `related_to` | Hop-proximity + BM25 blend for a given memory ID |
| `list_memories` | Paginated enumeration of all stored memories |
| `memory_stats` | Totals, per-district counts, most-accessed, orphans |
| `import_memories` | Bulk seed from a JSON array |

## Persistence

Memories are automatically saved to `~/.neurodivergent-memory/memories.json` on every write.
The graph is restored on server startup — no data is lost between restarts.

---

## Memory Quality Guardrails

- Do not stop at "what happened". Each important memory should capture why the action was taken, what tradeoff or principle drove it, and whether the insight is reusable.
- Treat `practical_execution` as the action log, then pair it with `logical_analysis` or `creative_synthesis` when the deeper rationale should survive longer than the implementation details.
- When a debug trail, handoff, or emotional/raw memory is noisy, use `distill_memory` or an explicit follow-up memory to preserve the signal while stripping incidental detail.
- Prefer connective synthesis over isolated task logs: link implementation memories back to durable principles such as explicit state over implicit state, bounded growth, or environment-aware validation.

## Bootstrap checklist for new agent sessions

1. Call `memory_stats` to see how many memories exist.
2. Use `search_memories` with a broad query to locate relevant prior context.
3. Check whether recent memories already explain the rationale or durable principle behind the task, not just the last execution step.
4. Apply the canonical tag schema when calling `store_memory`.
5. Connect new memories to related existing ones with `connect_memories`.
6. Use `traverse_from` or `related_to` for associative retrieval rather than repeated searches.
7. **No Quick Task exemption**: any file edit, decision, or finding in this repo is memory-worthy — write the memory before moving on. If you catch yourself thinking "this is too small" — that is the trigger, not a bypass.
8. **No execution-only memory exemption**: if a memory says what changed, it should also say why it changed or link to a memory that does.
