- **WordPress Standards**: Always adhere to [WordPress coding standards](mdc:https:/developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards) for both PHP and JavaScript.
- **Existing Patterns**: Follow the existing code structure, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found in the codebase. Consistency is key.
- **Bail Early**: Use early returns in functions and methods to improve readability and reduce cognitive load.

globs:
  - "src/**/*.php"
---
### Tasks
- All tasks **must** extend `StellarWP\Shepherd\Abstracts\Task_Abstract`.
- Task arguments must be passed to `parent::__construct()` to ensure they are correctly stored.
- The core logic of a task resides in the `process()` method.
- To trigger a retry, a task **must** overwrite the `get_max_retries` method.

globs:
  - "tests/**/*.php"

### Test Structure
- All integration tests **must** extend `lucatume\WPBrowser\TestCase\WPTestCase`.
- Use the provided test traits (`With_AS_Assertions`, `With_Uopz`, `With_Clock_Mock`, `With_Log_Snapshot`) where appropriate.
- Use `@before` and `@after` annotations for setting up test conditions (e.g., freezing time with `freeze_time()`) and cleaning up (e.g., `unset_uopz_returns()`).

### Assertions & Mocks
- **NEVER** interact with a real external service. Always mock external calls.
- **WordPress Functions**: Use `set_fn_return` from the `With_Uopz` trait to mock WordPress functions like `wp_mail`.
- **Spy Pattern**: To verify function calls, use the spy pattern. Define an empty `$spy = []` array and have your mock closure add the call arguments to it (`$spy[] = $args`). Then, assert against the contents of the `$spy` array.
- **Task Lifecycle**: Every test for a task's execution **must** assert the full sequence of log entries (`created`, `started`, `retrying`, `finished`/`failed`). Use `assertMatchesLogSnapshot()` for this.
- **Action Scheduler**: Use the helper methods from `With_AS_Assertions` (e.g., `assertTaskExecutesWithoutErrors`, `assertTaskExecutesFailsAndReschedules`) to test the interaction with Action Scheduler.

description: Guidelines for creating and updating project documentation.
globs:
  - "docs/**/*.md"
  - "README.md"
---
- All new public-facing features, tasks, or methods **must** be documented.
- If a new pre-packaged task is added, create a new Markdown file for it in the `docs/tasks/` directory.
- Update the main `docs/tasks.md` file to link to the new task's documentation.
- For new advanced features, update `docs/advanced-usage.md`.
