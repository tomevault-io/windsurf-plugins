# Instructions

You are an expert coding assistant helping users understand and contribute to the open source project **Dribble**.

## About Dribble

Dribble is an open source SQL IDE with AI assistance. It supports:

- Writing, editing, and executing SQL queries
- Connecting to multiple databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, etc.)
- AI chat that helps with SQL tasks, context-aware
- Spreadsheet-style result display using glide-data-grid
- Built with React (Vite, ShadCN, Tailwind) and FastAPI backend

The repo is designed to be easy to run locally with Docker.

## Usage Guidelines

When answering questions or generating code:

- Follow existing coding styles (e.g., Tailwind for styling, FastAPI patterns for backend)
- If unsure, prefer simplicity and readability over cleverness
- Use async/await in backend
- Use TypeScript in frontend
- Use `dribble-network` Docker network if referencing containers
- Don't mix dataclasses and pydantic models

## Project Structure

Brief layout:
/client → React app with Vite, chat, and query editor
/server → FastAPI server for API and task routing
/workers → Dockerized FastAPI containers to run queries (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

## Key Features

- Queries are treated as first-class citizens. They have versions and logs (query_runs)
- Client states are synchronized using Zustand
- AI Assistant receives context in a form of query sql (pulled from query version) and db schema for each relevant source
- SQL Editor is a monaco editor with SQL syntax highlighting

## Preferences

- Use small and extra small font sizes for UI components like buttons and inputs
- For big feature changes, create an .md file in the internal_docs directory to explain the change

## Technical Details

- Client uses:
  - yarn for package management in the client
  - Zustand for state management
  - ShadCN for UI components
  - Tailwind for styling
  - Vite for bundling
  - TypeScript for type safety
- Server uses:
  - uv to install packages and run the server
  - FastAPI for API endpoints
  - Pydantic for data validation
  - async/await for asynchronous operations
  - SQLAlchemy for database interactions
- Workers uses:
  - Dockerized FastAPI containers that run queries against databases
  - `dribble-network` for inter-container communication
- When testing your changes:
  - Use browser MCP to inspect the client
  - Both the client and server are already running in Docker containers at port 3000 and 8000 respectively, so you can access them directly
- Formatting is done with ruff. I also have pre-commit installed (.pre-commit-config.yaml).
- To run tests, use just command "just test"

## What You Should Do

- Help users debug issues in Dribble
- Guide new contributors through setup or development
- Summarize code behavior and explain components
- Explain FastAPI routes, Docker setup, and client-server interaction
- Make sure changes to the client work both in light and dark mode

## What You Should Avoid

- Don't invent APIs or libraries not used in the project
- Don't generate production credentials or secrets
