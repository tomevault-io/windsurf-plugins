# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (includes dev group: pytest, ruff, httpx)
uv sync

# Lint and test (CI runs both on every push/PR)
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run pytest

# Run web UI (FastAPI + React with interactive bounding box editor)
uv run scansplitter api

# Process files via CLI
uv run scansplitter process <files> -o ./output/

# Run with specific options
uv run scansplitter process scan.jpg --no-rotate --min-area 5 --max-area 70 --format jpg

# Frontend development
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev  # Dev server on :5173
cd frontend && npm run build               # Build to src/scansplitter/static/

# Build and publish to PyPI
cd frontend && npm run build               # Build frontend first
uv build                                   # Creates dist/*.whl and dist/*.tar.gz
uv publish                                 # Publish to PyPI (requires API token)
```

## Architecture

ScanSplitter detects and extracts multiple photos from scanned images using OpenCV contour detection.

**Processing Pipeline** (`processor.py` orchestrates):
1. **Input** - Load image or extract pages from PDF (`pdf_handler.py`)
2. **Detection** - Grayscale → Gaussian blur → Adaptive threshold → Contour detection → Filter by area ratio (`detector.py`)
3. **Rotation** - Score each 90° rotation using Hough line detection, pick best alignment (`rotator.py`)
4. **Output** - Cropped, rotated images

**Key parameters:**
- `min_area_ratio` / `max_area_ratio` (default 2%-80%) - Contour area relative to total image; filters noise and full-page detections
- Detection uses `cv2.findContours()` with `RETR_EXTERNAL` to get outermost contours only

**Interfaces:**
- `api.py` - FastAPI backend with REST endpoints for the React frontend
- `session.py` - Session management for temporary file storage (idle-based
  expiry) plus `sanitize_name()`, the mandatory sanitizer for every
  client-supplied name that reaches a filesystem or zip path
- `jobs.py` - Background job registry + thread pool; long operations run as
  jobs with progress/stage/cancellation (see `/api/jobs/*` endpoints);
  failed jobs preserve HTTPException status/detail as
  `error_status`/`error_detail`
- `confidence.py` - Pure scan-confidence heuristics (flags like
  `touches_edge` and `overlap`) used to auto-approve or flag scans
- `projects.py` - Persistent project store under `~/.scansplitter/projects/`
  (`SCANSPLITTER_DATA_DIR` overrides); atomic project.json writes
- `metadata.py` - Pure project-metadata validation plus export-time EXIF GPS/date
  and Adobe-compatible XMP packet generation; project originals are never modified
- `models.py` - ML model downloads, SHA-256 pinned with atomic rename
- `cli.py` - Subcommands: `api` (web UI), `process` (batch CLI). Binding to
  a non-loopback host sets local mode off: endpoints that touch the host
  filesystem (`/api/select-directory`, `/api/export-local`) return 403

**Conventions:**
- Endpoints are sync `def` (FastAPI threadpool) because the work is
  CPU-bound OpenCV/ONNX; never introduce blocking work in an `async def`
- Interactive feature parity is binding: detection modes, detection settings,
  re-detection behavior, and upload-time detection must be supported in both
  Quick and persistent Projects in the same change. Any deliberate exception
  must be stated in the relevant binding spec, and each workflow needs backend
  and frontend regression coverage.
- Every client-controlled name goes through `sanitize_name()`; local writes
  are contained with `resolve().is_relative_to(base)`
- GPS EXIF is stripped on export unless the request sets `include_gps`
- Project metadata is a partial-patch contract: omitted fields are preserved,
  explicit null clears scalars, and latitude/longitude must be set or cleared together

**Product direction:** see `docs/ROADMAP.md` (phases, principles, decisions)
and `docs/specs/` for binding feature specs. Keep spec files updated in the
same commit when an implementation deviates.

**Frontend** (`frontend/`):
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Fabric.js for interactive, rotatable bounding box editing
- Built output goes to `src/scansplitter/static/` and is served by FastAPI

**API Endpoints** (`/api/...`):
- `POST /upload` - Upload image/PDF, returns session ID
- `POST /detect` - Run detection, returns bounding boxes
- `POST /crop` - Crop with user-adjusted boxes
- `POST /export` - Download results as ZIP
- `GET /image/{session_id}/{filename}` - Serve uploaded images
