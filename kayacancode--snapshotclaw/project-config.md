# CLAUDE.md — SnapshotClaw Development Guide

## What is this project?

SnapshotClaw is a content-addressed versioning system for AI agent state (specifically OpenClaw), inspired by AT Protocol's personal data repositories. Read `SPEC.md` for the full architecture.

## Key concepts

- **MST (Merkle Search Tree)**: Deterministic tree mapping paths → CIDs. Same spec as AT Protocol. Given the same records, always produces the same root hash.
- **CID**: Content identifier — SHA-256 hash of CBOR-encoded data. Using CIDv1 with dag-cbor codec.
- **Commit**: Signed object pointing to an MST root. Contains rev (timestamp-based), prev (chain), Ed25519 signature.
- **Record**: A CBOR-encoded file with path, content, and metadata. Sensitive records are encrypted (AES-256-GCM).
- **CAR file**: Content ARchive — portable single-file export of a snapshot (commit + all reachable blocks).
- **Block store**: Local CID-addressed file storage. Blocks sharded by CID prefix.

## Tech stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (Node.js, ESM)
- **Key deps**: `@ipld/dag-cbor`, `multiformats`, `@noble/ed25519`, `@noble/hashes`, `@ipld/car`, `commander`
- **Test**: vitest
- **Build**: tsup or tsc

## Implementation order (phases)

### Phase 1: Core MVP
1. `cid.ts` — CID generation from CBOR-encoded data
2. `record.ts` — Convert files to CBOR records with metadata
3. `blockstore.ts` — Store/retrieve blocks by CID
4. `mst.ts` — Full MST: insert, lookup, walk, root hash, key depth
5. `commit.ts` — Create unsigned commits (signing comes in Phase 3)
6. `walker.ts` + `collections.ts` — Scan OpenClaw directories, classify files
7. CLI commands: `init`, `create`, `list`, `show`, `diff`
8. `restore.ts` — Hydrate files from a commit

### Phase 2: Export/Import
1. `car/export.ts` — Full CAR generation
2. `car/import.ts` — CAR parsing + block ingestion
3. Diff-based CAR export
4. CLI commands: `export`, `import`

### Phase 3: Security
1. `signing.ts` — Ed25519 keypair gen, commit signing, verification
2. `encryption.ts` — AES-256-GCM + Argon2id for sensitive records
3. CLI commands: `keys`, `verify`

### Phase 4: Sync + Polish
1. Local directory sync
2. S3 sync
3. Garbage collection
4. OpenClaw hook integration

## MST implementation notes

Follow the AT Protocol MST spec exactly:
- SHA-256 hash the key bytes
- Count leading zero BITS (not bytes), divide by 2, round down = depth
- Fanout of 4
- Key prefix compression within nodes (elide common prefix bytes with previous entry)
- Empty repo = single node with empty entries array
- Prune empty nodes from top and bottom, keep empty intermediate nodes
- Structure is deterministic — same keys/values = same root CID always

- https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto (TypeScript, production)

## Important constraints

- **No plaintext secrets in block store** — encrypt BEFORE computing CID
- **Deterministic** — same input must always produce same output (canonical CBOR, sorted keys)
- **CIDv1 only** — dag-cbor codec (0x71) for structured data, raw (0x55) for file content
- **SHA-256 only** — for both CIDs and MST key depth calculation
- **CBOR must be canonical** — use dag-cbor which enforces deterministic encoding
