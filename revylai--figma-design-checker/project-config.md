# Figma Design Checker — Agent Instructions

This project compares Figma design frames against a real running app to measure design fidelity. When operating as an automated agent, follow this guide.

## Full Workflow

Run these steps in order:

### 1. Fetch Figma frames

```bash
python scripts/fetch_figma.py \
  --file-key <FIGMA_FILE_KEY> \
  --token $FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN \
  --output-dir figma_frames \
  --scale 2
```

This downloads every top-level frame from the Figma file as a PNG. Use `--frame-filter "Frame A" "Frame B"` to limit to specific frames.

### 2. Capture app screenshots

```bash
python scripts/capture.py \
  --platform android \
  --app-id $REVYL_APP_ID \
  --output-dir app_screenshots \
  --screens screens.yaml
```

This boots a cloud device via Revyl CLI, navigates to each screen defined in `screens.yaml`, and saves a screenshot with a filename matching the Figma frame.

#### Alternative: capture from the app's Atlas (no navigation scripting)

If the app already has a Revyl **Atlas** (Revyl's auto-built map of every screen
it has explored), skip the live device entirely and pull the screenshots
straight from the Atlas:

```bash
python scripts/capture_atlas.py \
  --app "$REVYL_APP_NAME" \
  --build all \
  --output-dir app_screenshots \
  --screens screens.atlas.yaml
```

This produces the same `app_screenshots/<slug>.png` files and `manifest.json` as
`capture.py`, so step 3 is identical. Use this path when an Atlas exists — it is
faster and has no flaky navigation. Use `capture.py` when there is no Atlas yet,
or you need a screen the Atlas has not observed.

The Atlas screens file maps each Figma frame to an Atlas screen by **label/id**
(`atlas_screen:`) or a single-keyword **search** (`atlas_query:`) that resolves
to one match. The Atlas
search is token-based, not semantic — prefer one strong keyword (`checkout`),
not a phrase (`checkout payment form`). Discover available screens and labels
with `revyl atlas map --app "<App>" --build all` and
`revyl atlas search "<keyword>" --app "<App>"`. See `screens.crate.yaml` for a
worked example.

### 3. Generate the compliance report

```bash
python scripts/diff.py \
  --figma-dir figma_frames \
  --app-dir app_screenshots \
  --output-dir report \
  --threshold 0.05
```

This produces:
- `report/report.html` — visual HTML report with side-by-side comparisons
- `report/report.md` — Markdown summary for PR comments
- `report/diffs/` — overlay images highlighting divergences

## Mapping Figma Frames to App Screens

Edit `screens.yaml` to define the mapping. Each entry needs:

- **figma_frame** — The exact frame name as it appears in the Figma file. This must match character-for-character (case-sensitive).
- **steps** — A list of Revyl CLI actions (tap, type, swipe, wait, go-home) that navigate from the app's launch state to the target screen.
- **reset** — Set to `true` if the device should return to the home screen before navigating. Useful when the previous screen's state would interfere.

Navigation actions available:
- `tap` — Tap an element by its visible text or description. Revyl uses AI to resolve the target.
- `type` — Type text into a field (requires `target` and `text`).
- `swipe` — Swipe in a direction (requires `target` and `direction`: up/down/left/right).
- `wait` — Pause for `seconds` before continuing.
- `go-home` — Press the device home button.

## Interpreting the Compliance Score

The fidelity score blends two signals so the grade reflects *design* fidelity, not raw pixel alignment. Both sub-scores are shown per screen in the report.
- **Pixel fidelity (45% weight)** — A strict pixel-for-pixel match (pixelmatch, perceptual YIQ color distance, anti-aliased edges ignored). Catches real divergence, but on its own it punishes a faithful design that is merely shifted or scaled a few pixels, and tanks on gradients/photos that don't align exactly.
- **Structural similarity (55% weight)** — A shift-tolerant, multi-scale perceptual similarity: each image is pooled at several downsampled scales (16/32/64/128 px wide), so small positional shifts and anti-aliasing wash out while overall layout, color, and contrast differences survive.

The status bar is masked on both images before scoring, and the Figma frame is resized to the app screenshot's dimensions. Weights live in `PIXEL_WEIGHT`/`STRUCTURAL_WEIGHT` in `scripts/diff.py`.

If you previously treated fidelity as pure pixelmatch output, expect grades to shift — the structural term lifts scores for visually aligned screens with minor positional drift.

### Grade scale

| Grade | Score Range | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| A | 95%+ | Implementation closely matches design |
| B | 90 - 95% | Minor deviations, likely acceptable |
| C | 80 - 90% | Noticeable differences, review recommended |
| D | 70 - 80% | Significant drift from design |
| F | < 70% | Major divergence, needs rework |

## Error Handling

### Missing Figma frames
If a frame name in `screens.yaml` does not exist in the Figma file, `fetch_figma.py` will skip it (or filter it out). The diff step will report unmatched files as warnings.
