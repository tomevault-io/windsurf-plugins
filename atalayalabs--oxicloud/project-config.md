# src/AGENTS.md — backend-only notes

Non-obvious rules that trip up new code. Terse on purpose.

## Auth policy

- **OIDC is the master identity provider.** Whenever `AuthApplicationService::oidc_enabled()` returns true, magic-link login MUST be off — `is_magic_link_login_allowed()` returns false regardless of `OXICLOUD_AUTH_METHODS`. Rationale: OIDC may enforce 2FA / step-up; a mailbox-possession bypass would silently sidestep it.
- **Password / magic-link handlers gate via `is_password_login_allowed()` / `is_magic_link_login_allowed()`**, never raw config or `password_login_disabled()` alone. The composed helpers merge the legacy OIDC-only flag, `OXICLOUD_AUTH_METHODS`, SMTP wiring, and the OIDC-master rule in one place.
- **Magic-link redemption** distinguishes login tokens (`resource_kind = None`) from invitation tokens (File / Folder). The login gate only applies to the None case; invitations follow their own admin-mediated trust chain.
- **`OXICLOUD_REQUIRE_VERIFIED_EMAIL`** gates login on `email_verified_at IS NOT NULL`. Admin-created (`admin_create_user`) and setup-admin (`setup_create_admin`) users are stamped verified at creation — admin fiat counts. OIDC-JIT already stamps verified. Admins are EXEMPT from the gate at login regardless of `email_verified_at` — pre-existing admin accounts from before this flag shipped must never be locked out of their own instance. Regular users hit the gate; the frontend detects the `EmailNotVerified` error_type and offers a resend-magic-link CTA.
- **Startup gate in `main.rs`**: magic-link-only allowlist + no SMTP = panic. Never soften to warn.

## New auth surfaces

- Any new endpoint that mints or consumes credentials/tokens must consult one of the `is_*_login_allowed()` helpers, not the raw allowlist.
- Any new "policy-disabled" refusal must emit an `audit`-target line before returning — matches `auth.login_rejected`, `magic_link.redemption_rejected` conventions.
