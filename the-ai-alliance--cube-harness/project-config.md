# Agents guide — cube-harness

*(Served as both `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` — the latter is a symlink.)*

You are working in **cube-harness**, the runtime that executes agents against CUBE
benchmarks and records trajectories. This file is your map; it is deliberately short.
Read the relevant spec in `openspec/specs/` before modifying any layer.

## What this repo is

cube-harness runs experiments. It consumes the contracts defined by **cube-standard**
(`Task`, `Benchmark`, `Tool`, `Resource`) and adds: agents, episode loops,
trajectory storage, OTel tracing, parallel execution (Ray), the XRay viewer, and
MCP server bridges.

It does NOT define the task/benchmark/tool protocol — that's cube-standard. If you're
tempted to change base class signatures (`Task.step`, `Benchmark.setup`, etc.), you're
in the wrong repo; go to cube-standard and start with an openspec change proposal.

## Spec index

Read the spec, then the code. Each spec is the authoritative contract for its layer.

| Layer | Module | Spec |
|-------|--------|------|
| Core types (Trajectory, AgentOutput) | `cube_harness.core` | [core/spec.md](openspec/specs/core/spec.md) |
| Agent | `cube_harness.agent` | [agent/spec.md](openspec/specs/agent/spec.md) |
| Tool (telemetry wrapper) | `cube_harness.tool` | [tool/spec.md](openspec/specs/tool/spec.md) |
| LLM wrapper | `cube_harness.llm` | [llm/spec.md](openspec/specs/llm/spec.md) |
| Episode | `cube_harness.episode` | [episode/spec.md](openspec/specs/episode/spec.md) |
| Experiment + runners | `cube_harness.experiment`, `cube_harness.exp_runner` | [experiment/spec.md](openspec/specs/experiment/spec.md) |
| Storage | `cube_harness.storage`, `cube_harness.summary` | [storage/spec.md](openspec/specs/storage/spec.md) |
| Metrics / OTel | `cube_harness.metrics` | [metrics/spec.md](openspec/specs/metrics/spec.md) |
| XRay viewer | `cube_harness.analyze` | [analyze/spec.md](openspec/specs/analyze/spec.md) |
| MCP server | `cube_harness.mcp` | [mcp/spec.md](openspec/specs/mcp/spec.md) |

**External contracts (cube-standard):** Any field typed as `cube.task.Task`,
`cube.benchmark.Benchmark`, `cube.tool.Tool`, `cube.core.*`, or `cube.resource.*`
is governed by cube-standard's specs. Don't subclass those here — consume them.

## Workflow for code changes

1. **Find the relevant spec** — which layer? Start there.
2. **Check "Invariants" and "Gotchas"** — these are the traps.
3. **Check `openspec/changes/`** — someone may already be proposing your change.
4. **For substantive contract changes**, write a delta spec
   (`openspec/changes/<name>/deltas.md` with ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED sections)
   before coding. Archive to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/` when done.
5. **Constitution alignment:** every change is reviewed against the
   [constitution](.claude/rules/constitution.md) and [review rules](.claude/rules/review-rules.md).

## Key conventions (already enforced in code)

- **Python is the configuration** — no YAML/Hydra. `AgentConfig`, `LLMConfig`,
  `Experiment` are all Pydantic `TypedBaseModel`.
