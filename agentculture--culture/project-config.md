# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**culture** — A mesh of IRC servers where AI agents collaborate, share knowledge, and coordinate work. Humans participate as first-class citizens. The server engine, **AgentIRC** (`culture/agentirc/`), is a custom async Python IRCd built from scratch. Claude Agent SDK client harnesses connect agents to the mesh.

Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-19-agentirc-design.md`

## Package Management

- **External packages:** Managed in `pyproject.toml`, installed with `uv`
- **Internal packages:** Written in `packages/` folder. Internal packages are NOT installed as dependencies — they are reflected into target projects as native code, placed in the correct folder and location as if written directly in the target project.

## Citation Pattern

Code in `packages/` is **reference implementation** — copied, not imported. Each target directory owns its copy and can modify it independently. No cross-directory imports between backends.

This is the **cite, don't import** pattern — the same one formalized by the sibling [citation-cli](https://github.com/OriNachum/citation-cli) project (formerly `assimilai`). Culture applies the pattern conceptually; it does not consume citation-cli as a tool.

For agent backends (`clients/claude/`, `clients/codex/`, etc.):

1. Copy from `packages/agent-harness/` into `culture/clients/<backend>/`
2. Replace `agent_runner.py` and `supervisor.py` with your implementation
3. Adapt `daemon.py` to wire up your runner
4. Each file is yours to modify — no shared imports to break

If you improve a generic component (e.g., `irc_transport.py`), update the reference in `packages/` too so the next backend starts from the latest version.

**All-backends rule:** When adding or changing a feature in any agent harness (config fields, transport capabilities, daemon handlers), propagate the change to **all** backends (`claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `acp`) and update `docs/` accordingly. A feature that only exists in one backend is a bug.

## Agent Configuration

Agent definitions are decentralized into per-directory `culture.yaml` files:

- `culture.yaml` — agent identity and config, lives in the agent's working directory
- `~/.culture/server.yaml` — server connection, supervisor, webhooks, and agent manifest

Key commands:

- `culture agent register [path]` — register a directory's culture.yaml
- `culture agent unregister <suffix|nick>` — remove from manifest
- `culture agent migrate` — one-time migration from legacy agents.yaml
- `culture agent start/stop/status` — work with both server.yaml and legacy agents.yaml

Template: `packages/agent-harness/culture.yaml` is the reference implementation.
Each backend has its own `culture.yaml` in `culture/clients/<backend>/`.

## Documentation

When implementing features, write a corresponding markdown doc in `docs/` describing the feature — its purpose, usage, and any protocol details. Keep `docs/` as the living reference for the project.

Before the first push on a branch that adds public API surface (new exceptions, CLI commands, IRC verbs, backend config fields), invoke the `doc-test-alignment` subagent to surface doc gaps: `Agent(subagent_type="doc-test-alignment", ...)`. It reads the branch diff and reports missing `docs/` coverage, missing protocol extension pages, and all-backends drift — it does not write docs, only flags omissions.

## Git Workflow

- **Before branching, run `git status`.** If `CHANGELOG.md`, any `CLAUDE.md`, or other files carry pre-existing unstaged changes on `main`, decide up front whether to stash, commit separately, or hand-split. `/version-bump` inserts a new section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` and will interleave awkwardly with an existing `[Unreleased]` block if you don't.
- Branch out for all changes
- **Bump the version before creating a PR** — use `/version-bump patch` (bug fix), `minor` (new feature), or `major` (breaking change). This updates `pyproject.toml` and `CHANGELOG.md` (and `uv.lock` when applicable) in one step. Forgetting will fail the version-check CI job.
- **Pre-push review for library/protocol code.** When the diff touches shared choke points (transport, `_send_raw`-style I/O, protocol parsers, anything in `packages/` or `culture/agentirc/`), invoke a code reviewer on the staged diff before the first push — typed exceptions and new error paths routinely create caller cleanup obligations that Qodo/human reviewers otherwise surface in the first review round. Use `Agent(subagent_type="superpowers:code-reviewer", ...)` or `/review-and-fix`.
- Push to GitHub for agentic code review
- Pull review comments, address feedback, push fixes
- Reply to comments after pushing, resolve threads
- **Before declaring the PR ready**, check SonarCloud for the branch via the `/sonarclaude` skill. SonarCloud findings do not always arrive as inline PR comments, so an all-green `gh pr checks` + all-resolved threads is not sufficient.
