# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository maintains many agent skills under the `skills` directory.

## Do

- Keep the root `README.md` updated regarding the skills that this repo maintains.
- Keep each `skills/<skill-name>/README.md` updated with the corresponding `SKILL.md`.
- Whenever a skill changes, update that skill's `README.md` in the same change, including its Mermaid diagram when behavior, workflow, routing, composition, storage, or responsibilities change.
- Keep root `README.md` skill catalog links pointed at `skills/<skill-name>/README.md`, not directly at `SKILL.md`.
- Use the `conventional-commit` skill for commit messages.
