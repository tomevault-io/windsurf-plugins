# Wanta AI Guide

> Thin entry point for AI agents. Read only the subdoc that matches the current task.

## What this is

Wanta is OOMOL's Electron desktop AI-agent chat client.

## AI Constitution

- Read only the subdoc that matches the current task.
- Keep setup deterministic and repeatable.
- Treat worktree isolation and concurrent agents as first-class concerns.
- Keep Electron dev observable by the machine, not by human narration.
- Preserve credential, endpoint, branding, and runtime-boundary rules.

## When to read what

- [docs/ai/integrated-browser-implementation.md](docs/ai/integrated-browser-implementation.md): current integrated-browser implementation state, verified probes, and remaining work
- [docs/development.md](docs/development.md): human-facing development workflow and environment details
