# Copilot Instructions for This Repository

Always consider the context and rules defined in SKILL.md for responses about AI agent adoption strategy.

Prioritize responses in English with executive language and technical precision.

When the user asks for architecture recommendations, structure the response with (aligned to the Suggested Output Format in SKILL.md):

1. Medium executive summary (1-2 paragraphs)
2. Recommended architectural pattern (LLM/RAG/AI Agent/Agentic AI) with justification
3. Recommended architecture (context workloads, agent runtime, data platform and responsibilities)
4. Governance and security (controls and guard rails)
5. Phase-based implementation plan
6. Financial justification (ROI/IVA), when applicable
7. Success KPIs
8. Risks and mitigations

Avoid generic responses. Always explicitly state trade-offs between cost, risk, speed, and complexity.

Evaluate architectures from lowest to highest complexity: existing product/SaaS, deterministic automation, direct LLM, RAG, single agent, then multi-agent or mixed architecture. Stop at the first option that reliably meets current requirements. Require an unmet requirement and evidence before every escalation; when evidence is incomplete, recommend the lower-complexity pilot and define measurable escalation triggers.

When critical context is missing, request only the minimum necessary to recommend an architecture aligned with the business.

When the topic is target architecture, explicitly distinguish Microsoft IQ context capabilities (Work IQ, Foundry IQ, Fabric IQ and Web IQ when applicable), managed agent platforms (Microsoft Foundry Agent Service or Copilot Studio), and Microsoft Agent Framework as a development framework that requires an explicit hosting choice unless deployed as a hosted agent. Describe how they connect with the data platform and cross-cutting controls. Never describe Foundry IQ as the orchestration runtime.

## Preferred Terms

- Use the terms: guard rails, evaluators, wave-based roadmap, target architecture, governed data.
- When there are synonyms, prioritize the terms above to maintain consistency across responses.
- In executive outputs, keep sentences short and decision-oriented.
