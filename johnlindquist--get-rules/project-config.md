# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

`get-rules` is an npm utility that downloads and installs `.mdc` rule files for AI-assisted coding tools (like Cursor) from the johnlindquist/get-rules repository. It's a self-contained Node.js CLI tool that recursively fetches the entire `.cursor/rules` directory structure via the GitHub API, preserving the hierarchical organization of rules.

## Common Commands

### Development & Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the CLI locally
node cli.js

# Run with custom repo
node cli.js org/repo

# Create npm release (automated via GitHub Actions)
npm run release
```

### Package Publishing
The project uses semantic-release for automated versioning and publishing:
- Commits to `main` branch trigger the release workflow
- Conventional commit messages determine version bumps
- NPM publishing is handled automatically via GitHub Actions

## Architecture & Key Components

### Main Components

1. **cli.js**: The core CLI script that:
   - Accepts optional `org/repo` arguments (defaults to `johnlindquist/get-rules`)
   - Recursively downloads entire `.cursor/rules` directory structure from GitHub
   - Downloads only `.mdc` files while preserving directory hierarchy
   - Moves existing files to temp directory before downloading updates

### Rule System Architecture

The downloaded rules follow a specific structure documented in `RULES.md`:
- Rules are `.mdc` files (Markdown with Components) with YAML frontmatter
- Organized in hierarchical category directories:
  - `_/` - Personal rules directory (gitignored)
  - `_always/` - Global rules that apply to all operations
  - `_globs/` - Rules organized by file patterns they apply to
  - Category directories: `cli/`, `docs/`, `git/`, `task/`, `code/`, `react/`, etc.
- Each rule has `alwaysApply` boolean to control automatic vs manual invocation
- Frontmatter fields include: `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`

### Key Implementation Details

- Uses native Node.js `https` module (no external HTTP dependencies)
- Implements custom `httpsGetJson()` and `downloadFile()` helpers
- New `downloadDirectory()` function for recursive directory traversal
- Preserves existing files by moving them to OS temp directory with timestamp
- Creates nested directory structure automatically
- User-Agent header included for GitHub API compliance
- Handles both files and directories from GitHub API responses

## Customization & Personalization

The downloaded rules support customization as documented in `PERSONALIZATION.md`:
- `_/` directory for personal rules (gitignored, not shared with team)
- Local overrides using `git update-index --assume-unchanged` for team rules
- `_globs/` directory contains rules organized by file patterns

## Release Process

This project uses semantic-release with the following configuration:
- Analyzes commits to determine version bumps
- Generates changelog in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Publishes to npm registry
- Creates GitHub releases
- Updates package.json and commits changes

To trigger a release, push conventional commits to the `main` branch:
- `feat:` for new features (minor version bump)
- `fix:` for bug fixes (patch version bump)
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` for breaking changes (major version bump)
