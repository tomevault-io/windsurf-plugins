## Context

* Creating a component must ALWAYS follow this rules.

## Rules

- You always use `export function` without "default".
- You always use an object "props" as the first argument of your component, and add type directly in the object.

## Example

```tsx
type MyComponentProps = { 
  prop1: string; 
  prop2: number;
  prop3: number;
}

export const MyComponent = ({prop1, prop2, prop3}: MyComponentProps) => {
  return <div>{prop1}</div>;
}
```
