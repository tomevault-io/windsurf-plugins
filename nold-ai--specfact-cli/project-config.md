# GitHub Copilot Instructions — specfact-cli

Use [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) as the mandatory bootstrap surface and [docs/agent-rules/INDEX.md](../docs/agent-rules/INDEX.md) as the canonical governance dispatcher.

## Minimal reminders

- When a sibling internal repository (for example `../specfact-cli-internal/`) exists, read its `wiki/` files by absolute path before designing an OpenSpec change; see **Strategic context** in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/agent-rules/40-openspec-and-tdd.md` (section **Internal wiki and strategic context**). Do not copy wiki content into this repository.
- This repository enforces the clean-code review gate through `hatch run specfact code review run --json --out .specfact/code-review.json`.
- Public APIs require `@icontract` and `@beartype`.
- Work belongs on `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `hotfix/*`, or `chore/*` branches, normally in a worktree.
- The full governance rules live in `docs/agent-rules/`; do not treat this file as a complete standalone handbook.
