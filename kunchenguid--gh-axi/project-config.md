# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## Dependency bumps and the lockfile

The committed `pnpm-lock.yaml` is Prettier-formatted (multi-line `resolution:` and `engines:` blocks), which is not pnpm's native output format.
A plain `pnpm install` rewrites those blocks inline and produces a ~1000-line cosmetic churn even when only one dependency actually changed.
After bumping a dependency, run `pnpm exec prettier --write pnpm-lock.yaml` so the diff collapses to just the real change.
CI uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, which parses the YAML structurally and accepts the Prettier-formatted lockfile, so the formatting does not break the frozen-install check.

## The SDK-provided `update` command

`gh-axi` runs its CLI through `runAxiCli` from `axi-sdk-js` (`src/cli.ts`) and registers no `update` command of its own.
Since `axi-sdk-js@0.1.8` ships `update` as a `RESERVED_COMMANDS` built-in, `gh-axi` inherits `gh-axi update` for free, and the SDK auto-resolves the npm package name (`gh-axi`) by walking up to the nearest `package.json`.
The SDK also appends a `"built-in":` section to the top-level `--help` output at runtime, so `src/cli.ts`'s `TOP_HELP` constant is a prefix of the rendered help rather than the whole thing.

## Release process

Releases are cut by release-please from conventional commit messages on `main`; merging the bot's release PR triggers `npm publish` via `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`.
Do not hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or `.release-please-manifest.json` (a guard workflow blocks PRs that touch them), and regenerate `skills/gh-axi/SKILL.md` with `pnpm run build:skill` instead of editing it directly.

## GitHub Enterprise host support (`src/host.ts`, `src/cli.ts`)

`gh-axi` targets a custom GitHub host (e.g. a GHE server like `ghe.example.com`) via a global `--hostname <host>` flag or the `GH_HOST` env var; explicit `--hostname` wins.
Like `-R`/`--repo`, `--hostname` must come _after_ the command (the SDK rejects leading flags), and it is stripped from the args before they reach the underlying `gh` (it is never a subcommand flag).
`src/cli.ts`'s `resolveContext` sets `process.env.GH_HOST` only when `--hostname` is present; the child `gh` process inherits `process.env`, so no explicit env is threaded through `gh.ts`. When no `--hostname` is given, `GH_HOST` is left untouched, keeping the default (github.com) behavior byte-for-byte identical.
`src/host.ts#resolveHost()` (flag > `GH_HOST` > `github.com`) is the single source of truth for the effective host used when _building or parsing_ URLs — `parseRemoteUrl` in `src/context.ts` matches the configured host in `git remote` URLs, and `issue transfer`'s fallback URL is built as `https://<host>/...`. The `gh pr create` output regex (`/pull/(\d+)/`) is already host-agnostic.

## Secret/variable value input (`src/secretValue.ts`, `src/stdin.ts`, `gh.ts#ghExecWithStdin`)

`gh secret list`/`gh variable list` do not support `--limit` or any pagination flag (unlike `issue`/`pr`/`release` list), so `secret.ts`/`variable.ts` list all results in one call with no `--limit` flag of their own.

Secret values must never appear in argv (visible via `ps`) or stdout.
`secretCommand`'s `set` subcommand is stdin-only: it rejects `--body`/`-b`, calls `resolveValue(undefined, "secret")`, and pipes the resolved value to `gh.ts#ghExecWithStdin` so the wrapped `gh secret set` child also never receives the value in argv.
Variable values are not treated as secrets: `variableCommand`'s `set` subcommand may resolve the value from `--body`/`-b` or piped stdin (`resolveValue` in `src/secretValue.ts`, backed by `src/stdin.ts`), and `gh-axi variable list` intentionally prints variable values.
`variable set --body` values are visible in the `gh-axi` process argv, but `ghExecWithStdin` still keeps them out of the child `gh variable set` argv.
`resolveValue` throws immediately instead of blocking when stdin is an interactive TTY and no usable value source was provided, since AXI commands must never hang waiting for interactive input.

`secretCommand`'s `list`/`set`/`delete` forward `--env`/`-e <environment>` to `gh secret ... --env` via `resolveScope` in `src/commands/secret.ts`; the repo/host context flags are already stripped in `cli.ts` before the command sees its args, so `-R`/`--hostname` compose with `--env` for free. `resolveScope` is deliberately strict: a malformed `--env` (missing/empty value), conflicting `--env` flags, gh's other scopes (`--org`/`--user`/`--app`, plus the value-channel `--env-file`), and any unknown flag all throw loudly rather than silently falling back to repo scope. Unknown flags are echoed by name only (the `=value` is stripped) so a secret value can never leak into an error message.
