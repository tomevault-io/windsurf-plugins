# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Mandatory repository quality gate

- Use the repository SDK (`./.dotnet/dotnet`), whose exact version is pinned in `global.json`.
- Put all first-party NuGet versions in `Directory.Packages.props`; never add a `Version` attribute to a first-party `PackageReference`.
- Do not edit `vendor/` to satisfy first-party analyzers. Vendor policy is deliberately isolated.
- Before handing off any code change, run `./scripts/check.sh --full`.
- During iteration, `./scripts/check.sh --quick` runs locked restore, dependency audit, deterministic formatting, the warning-free Release build, and architecture tests.
- Never bypass or weaken an analyzer, banned API, lock file, or test to make a gate pass. Fix the issue or add the narrowest documented boundary exception.
- Install the checked-in Git hooks with `./scripts/install-hooks.sh`; bootstrap does this automatically.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
