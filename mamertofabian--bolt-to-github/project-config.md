# Rules for Effective Unit Testing

1. **Test behavior, not implementation details**

   - Focus on the observable inputs and outputs of the system under test (SUT)
   - Do not test private methods directly; test them through public interfaces
   - Tests should remain valid even if internal implementation changes

2. **Minimize mocking to essential dependencies**

   - Only mock external systems you don't control (databases, APIs, file systems)
   - Use real implementations of your own dependencies when possible
   - If using a mock, it should represent realistic behavior of the real component

3. **Create test doubles that accurately reflect real behavior**

   - Stubs/mocks should follow the same contract as real implementations
   - Test both happy paths and edge cases/error conditions
   - Verify interactions with dependencies only when the interaction itself is the behavior being tested

4. **Use test fixtures intelligently**

   - Set up controlled test environments rather than extensive mocking
   - For filesystem operations, use temporary directories
   - For databases, use in-memory databases or containers

5. **Test at the appropriate level**

   - Unit tests: Test a single unit in isolation
   - Integration tests: Test how components work together
   - Clear distinction between unit and integration tests in organization

6. **Make tests deterministic and independent**

   - Tests should not depend on each other
   - Tests should be repeatable with the same results
   - Avoid time-dependent tests; use fixed timestamps when necessary

7. **Write tests before fixing bugs**

   - Create a test that reproduces the bug
   - Fix the bug
   - Verify the test passes

8. **Test for failure conditions**

   - Verify error handling works correctly
   - Test boundary conditions and edge cases
   - Don't only test the "happy path"

9. **Keep tests simple and readable**

   - Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested and expected results
   - Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
   - One logical assertion per test (may include multiple related technical assertions)

10. **Tests should be maintainable**

    - DRY principle applies to test code, but clarity is more important
    - Tests should not be brittle (failing due to minor, unrelated changes)
    - Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent running

11. **Measure test quality, not just coverage**

    - Consider mutation testing to verify tests catch actual bugs
    - Review tests as carefully as production code
    - Ensure failing a test provides clear indication of what's wrong

12. **Don't mock what you don't own**

    - Create adapters around external dependencies instead of mocking them directly
    - Mock your adapter interfaces, not third-party libraries

13. **Test state changes, not just function calls**

    - Verify the end state after operations, not just that methods were called
    - Check actual data changes rather than implementation details

14. **Make tests obvious and transparent**

    - A test should clearly show what it's testing without hidden complexity
    - Someone not familiar with the code should understand what a test verifies

15. **Document test scenarios clearly**
    - Tests should serve as documentation for how components should behave
    - Use test names and docstrings to explain what's being tested and why

These rules should help guide the creation of tests that truly verify your code's behavior rather than just creating an illusion of test coverage.
