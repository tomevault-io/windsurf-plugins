# Development

## Repository

- This uses mamertofabian/bolt-to-github GitHub repository

## Environment

 - This project is being developed in a Windows environment and thus using Powershell. So start using powershell commands instead of bash commands right from the first attempt when running commands.
 - Use pnpm as package manager

### Available pnpm commands

Since this is a Chrome extension project, running `dev` won't work during testing. The developer already loaded the `dist` folder in Chrome Extension developer mode so the extension is already loaded. Running `build` or `watch` is enough for manual testing.

- pnpm run build
- pnpm run lint
- pnpm run check
- pnpm run test
- Check the package.json for other commands

# Security

## Security Practices

- Never commit sensitive files
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Keep credentials out of logs and output

# Tech Stack Rules

## Framework & Core Technologies

- Use Svelte v4.2.x for components
- Use TypeScript v5.6.x for all .ts and .svelte files
- Use Vite v4.5.x as build tool
- Chrome Extension manifest v3 standards must be followed
- ESM modules only (type: "module" in package.json)
- Vitest v1.6.x for testing

## TypeScript Standards

- Strict mode is required
- No implicit any types
- Strict null checks enabled
- Use type annotations for function parameters and returns
- Follow the path aliases:
  - Use $lib/\* for imports from src/lib
- Chrome types must be included

## Component Standards

- All Svelte components must use TypeScript
- Follow Svelte best practices for reactivity
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Create modular components:
  - Break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable components
  - Extract repeated patterns into shared components
  - Keep component dependencies minimal and explicit
  - Use composition over inheritance
  - Maintain clear component interfaces with proper prop types
- Use Svelte's built-in state management
- Props must be properly typed

## Styling Standards

- Use TailwindCSS for styling
- Follow the custom theme system defined in tailwind.config.js
- Use CSS variables for theme colors
- Maintain dark mode compatibility
- Use container queries appropriately
- Follow the defined border radius system

## Code Quality

- ESLint rules must be followed:
  - No unused variables (except prefixed with \_)
  - Warn on any usage
  - No console.log (only console.warn/error allowed)
  - Follow svelte-eslint-parser rules with @typescript-eslint/parser
- Prettier formatting is required:
  - 2 space indentation
  - Single quotes
  - 100 character line length
  - ES5 trailing commas
  - Svelte-specific formatting with prettier-plugin-svelte

## Build & Structure

- Follow the defined Vite build configuration
- Maintain separate background/content scripts
- Use proper chunk splitting
- Keep source maps in development
- Assets must be in the assets directory
- Follow the defined output structure

## Dependencies

- No conflicting Svelte versions
- Keep dependencies up to date but pin versions
- Prefer official Svelte integrations
- Use bits-ui v0.21.x for UI components
- Use lucide-svelte v0.460.x for icons
- Maintain compatibility with @crxjs/vite-plugin v2.0.0-beta.x
- Use fflate v0.8.x for compression
- Use tailwind-merge v2.5.x and tailwind-variants v0.3.x for styling utilities

## Performance

- Minimize bundle sizes
- Use proper code splitting
- Optimize asset loading
- Follow Chrome extension best practices for performance

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- Run svelte-check before commits
- Ensure type checking passes
- Fix all ESLint warnings
- Format code before committing
- Test in both light and dark modes
- Use Vitest for unit testing
- Ensure test coverage is collected
- Follow the test naming convention: (/**tests**/.\*|(\\.|/)(test|spec))\\.tsx?$

## Version Control

- Follow semantic versioning
- Keep pnpm-lock.yaml up to date (project uses pnpm)
- Document breaking changes
- Maintain a clean git history
- Use Husky for git hooks
- Use lint-staged for pre-commit linting and formatting

## AI Agent Development

- Do not stop until all type issues and unit tests are passing.
