# AGENTS.md

- Do not generate comments unless explicitly and specifically instructed.
- Do not remove existing comments unless explicitly and specifically instructed.
- Do not git commit unless you are explicitly instructed.
- Your answers and explanations should be concise and scannable so the user can scan quickly and easily understand. Scarifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- Ground your answers and explanations with excerpts from documentation and code.

## Project

- `tanstack-cloudflare-effect-shopify-app` is a port of refs/shopify-app-template for TanStack Start, Cloudflare and effect v4.
- Route modules are in `src/routes/` and use file route conventions.

## Port Configuration

Get the local dev server port by running:

```bash
pnpm port
```

Use this port in commands via command substitution:

```bash
playwright-cli --session="$(pnpm port)-localdev" open "http://localhost:$(pnpm port)"
```

## Refs

Downloaded source code of libraries are in `refs/` for reference.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev                # Start dev server (see Port Configuration above)
pnpm typecheck          # TypeScript type checking (includes wrangler types generation)
pnpm lint               # Run ESLint
pnpm test               # Run all tests with Vitest.
npm run test:e2e --     # Playwright via npm (uses pnpm exec in script); pass args after -- and may be helpful to use --trace on
pnpm graphql-codegen    # Validate #graphql template literal strings against the Shopify Admin schema
```

- Run typecheck and lint after generating code. Not necessary if just research.
- Run `pnpm graphql-codegen` after any change to `#graphql` template literal strings.

## Server Log Monitoring

`logs/server.log` is a live, continuously growing log of dev server output. Use `tail` to check for build errors and runtime issues.

## TypeScript Guidelines

- Always follow functional programming principles and effect v4 patterns and idioms.
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators
- **Do not add any comments to generated code.** Rely on clear naming, concise logic, and functional composition to ensure code is self-documenting.
- Employ a concise and dense coding style. Prefer inlining expressions, function composition (e.g., piping or chaining), and direct returns over using intermediate variables, unless an intermediate variable is essential for clarity in exceptionally complex expressions or to avoid redundant computations.
- Inline types when practical instead of introducing extra interfaces or type aliases.
- Avoid intermediate variables that are not necessary for clarity.
- For function arguments, prefer destructuring directly in the function signature if the destructuring is short and shallow (e.g., `({ data: { value }, otherArg })`). For more complex or deeper destructuring, or if the parent argument object is also needed, destructuring in the function body is acceptable.
- Prefer namespace imports for large libraries.
- **Strict mode enabled**: All strict TypeScript checks are on
- **No unused variables/parameters**: Prefix with `_` if intentionally unused
- **Type imports**: Use `import type` for type-only imports when possible
- **Path aliases**: Use `@/*` for `src/*` imports (configured in tsconfig.json)

```ts
import type { Stripe as StripeTypes } from "stripe";
import * as React from "react";
import * as TanStackRouter from "@tanstack/react-router";
import * as TanStackStart from "@tanstack/react-start";
import * as Stripe from "stripe";
import * as z from "zod";
```

## SQL Guidelines

- Using sqlite with Cloudflare D1.
- Use lowercase for all sql keywords.
- Use positional parameter placeholders.

## TanStack

- TanStack typing is world-class. You should not need to type cast and should let typescript infer types wherever possible.
- Start loaders are isomorphic so generally create a server fn with server logic and call it from loader.
- **beforeLoad vs loader**: Use `beforeLoad` for route guards (auth, authorization) - returns merge into context. Use `loader` for data fetching - route-specific, parallel execution.
