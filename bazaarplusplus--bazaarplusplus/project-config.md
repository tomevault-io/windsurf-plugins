# AGENTS.md

The analyzer that turns Bundles into hero and build snapshots. Repo-wide rules
(commits, pull requests, docs policy, contracts) are in `../AGENTS.md`.

## Routing

- **Domain**: Read `CONTEXT.md` before changing source admission, facts,
  windows, metrics, or domain names; use its defined terms.
- **Pipeline**: Read `docs/architecture.md` before changing collection,
  persistence, recovery, locking, status, or publication flow.
- **Contract**: Read `docs/specs/consumer-data-contract.md` and the affected
  `contracts/v5/*.schema.json` before changing payloads, calculations,
  validation, object keys, or consumer behavior.
- **Capacity**: Read `docs/measurements.md` before changing retention,
  concurrency, batching, or memory defaults; remeasure the affected limit.
