# Project instructions

- Preserve existing project conventions and user changes.
- Check relevant code and configuration before choosing commands or changing behavior.
- Keep changes focused and run checks appropriate to the files changed.
- Report what changed, the checks run, and any remaining uncertainty.

Run the `omb-deep-setup` skill to analyze this project and refine these instructions
with verified commands, project constraints, and guidance at relevant folder boundaries.

If `.omb-memory/` exists, run `omb memory context --root <absolute-active-checkout>`
at session start and after compaction; follow its validated guidance. Use the
`omb-memory` skill for requests to remember, correct, or forget. If the CLI is
unavailable, report memory unavailable; do not bypass validation with raw file reads.
