# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The code now lives under `src/` with headers in `include/`. `src/interpreter.c` owns the lexer, parser, evaluator, and CLI/REPL, while GC implementations live in `src/gc/` (e.g., `mark_sweep.c`, `copying.c`, `generational.c`) behind the `gc_backend` interface and `gc_runtime` shim. WebAssembly artifacts and the browser harness (with heap visualization canvas) live under `web/`. `README.md` describes usage/build steps and `hanoi.lisp` shows a non-trivial program.

## Build, Test & Development Commands
- `source /path/to/emsdk_env.sh && make` — emits `web/interpreter.js`/`.wasm` using a repo-local `.emscripten-cache` so CI/sandboxes work.
- `make native` — builds the native CLI/REPL to `./interpreter` (override compiler via `NATIVE_CC=clang make native`).
- `make test-native` — runs the deterministic smoke suite (arithmetic, list ops, quoting, scripts, GC, multi-line REPL).
- `GC_BACKEND=copying make test-native` — reruns the same tests against the semispace copying GC backend.
- `GC_BACKEND=generational make test-native` — sanity-checks the nursery+old-generation collector.
- `make && python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory web` — serves the WASM harness; use the dropdown + heap canvas to compare GC behaviors visually.
- `./interpreter "(print (+ 1 2 3))"` or `./interpreter -f hanoi.lisp` — spot-checks for manual debugging.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Write ISO C (C11-compatible) with four-space indentation, no tabs, and compact file-scoped `static` helpers as used throughout `interpreter.c`. Functions and globals use `snake_case`, reserving the `gc_` prefix for allocator hooks and keeping exported entry points (`eval`) lowercase. Header guards follow the `FILE_H` pattern (`GC_H`). Add short intent-focused comments only where control flow is non-trivial (tokenization, allocation boundaries).

## Testing Guidelines
Use `make test-native` before pushing—it exercises arithmetic, list ops, quoting, GC builtins, script loading, and multi-line REPL input. When touching GC internals, run the suite under each backend (`GC_BACKEND=copying make test-native`) and craft stress cases (long recursive loops, large lists) with leak detectors (e.g., `valgrind`). Rebuild the WASM target via `make` and load `web/index.html` through a static server to ensure the browser harness still works.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
History currently uses short, imperative commits (e.g., “Initial commit”); continue that style with present-tense summaries under ~60 characters. Each pull request should explain the motivation, list testing evidence (commands run, expressions evaluated), and call out GC or build-system side effects reviewers must note. Reference related issues, attach screenshots only when demonstrating console output changes, and keep branches rebased so the slim history stays linear.

## Garbage-Collector Extension Tips
Each GC backend implements the `GcBackend` vtable (see `src/gc/gc_backend.h`) and plugs into `gc_runtime`. New algorithms belong in their own file under `src/gc/` and should expose a factory (e.g., `gc_mark_sweep_backend`, `gc_copying_backend`, `gc_generational_backend`). Keep interpreter-facing APIs stable by routing everything through `gc_runtime`, and update docs/tests to demonstrate `GC_BACKEND=...` selection. If you add metadata that the heap visualizer can use, populate `GcObjectInfo` (tag/generation) via `gc_set_tag` and `heap_snapshot`. Backend-specific knobs/comments live alongside the implementation.
