description: Answer VMware metrics questions using this repo as source of truth
---


# VMware Metrics Knowledge Base

When the user asks about VMware vSphere metrics, use this repository as the primary source.

- Ground answers in `book.md` and `chapters/*.md`.
- Prefer the chapter split files for faster retrieval, then cross-check in `book.md` when needed.
- Use terminology exactly as used in the book (VM, ESXi, Cluster, Consumer, Provider).
- Call out metric context differences across levels (VM vs ESXi vs Cluster).
- Cite the path-like book reference in each answer, for example: `CPU > VM > Contention Metrics > Ready`.
- If the content is not in the book, say so clearly instead of guessing.
- For troubleshooting questions, prioritize likely causes and concrete next checks.
