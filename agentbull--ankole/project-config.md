# Ankole Agent Guidelines

Ankole is a general-purpose Agent Operating System for long-running digital work. It can serve enterprises, teams, and one-person companies; the current architecture assumes one Ankole Installation as the operating domain rather than a SaaS-style multi-tenant product boundary. 

## The Zen of Ankole Development

Do the task that was asked.

Do not silently change the task.

Correct is better than clever.

Consistent is better than complete.

Useful is better than theoretically perfect.

A deliberate tradeoff is not a bug.

A local preference is not an architecture finding.

Omissions matter.

Contradictions matter.

Ambiguities matter when they change behavior.

Mere disagreement is usually noise.

Reality is not smooth.

Production systems are negotiated with time, cost, failure, and change.

Code is not static.

Code grows, bends, splits, merges, and dies.

Design for the next change, not for a frozen diagram.

Simplicity is not shallowness.

Completeness is not always responsibility.

Edge cases have diminishing returns.

Complexity compounds.

Rot compounds faster.

Simplicity and ROI are measured in the system a change leaves behind, not in the writing or changing of the code.

The cheapest change to make is often the most expensive system to live with.

Prefer deletion over addition.

Prefer reuse over invention.

Prefer boring contracts over clever machinery.

Prefer the chosen guarantee over an imagined stronger one.

Purity is useful when it protects a boundary.

Purity is harmful when it becomes ceremony.

Before changing code, write the cleanup plan.

Before adding code, ask what can be deleted.

Before inventing a pattern, search for the existing one.

Before criticizing a tradeoff, check whether it was already settled.

If it was settled, inspect inside it.

Do not relitigate it.

Working drafts may think out loud.

Shareable documents must not.

Remove scaffolding, TODO theater, abandoned alternatives, and meta-writing before committing docs.

### Scope fidelity

When a document says a tradeoff is final, evaluate consistency inside that tradeoff.

Do not argue for theoretical completeness unless the user asked for it.
Do not optimize for a perfect static design. This system will change.

A design that handles every imagined edge case today may become the source of tomorrow's rot.

Prefer the smallest correction that preserves the chosen direction.

If something looks risky, first ask:
- Is it actually inconsistent with the stated goal?
- Is it an omission inside the chosen design?
- Is it a contradiction against another explicit decision?
- Or am I merely disagreeing with the tradeoff?

Only the first three are useful by default. The fourth is noise unless explicitly requested.

### Reality bias

Real systems are uneven.

Do not assume the cleanest theoretical model is the responsible one.

A little duplication may be better than a premature abstraction.

A manual recovery path may be better than a complex automatic one.

A weaker guarantee may be better than code that nobody can safely change.

Prefer designs that remain understandable after six months of patches.

Prefer code that can be deleted.

Prefer behavior that can be explained to an operator.

Prefer guarantees that the system can actually keep.

## Bun

Default to using Bun instead of Node.js.

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` or `ts-node <file>`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`
- Use `bun build <file.html|file.ts|file.css>` instead of `webpack` or `esbuild`
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` or `pnpm run <script>`
- Use `bunx <package> <command>` instead of `npx <package> <command>`
- Bun automatically loads .env, so don't use dotenv.

## PostgreSQL

Make good use of PostgreSQL's data types and features to achieve better designs, instead of using the database in the crude, lowest-common-denominator way typical of MySQL.

## @pleisto/active-support

Use `@pleisto/active-support` as the general-purpose utility library. It provides Lodash-style helper functions and also re-exports `ts-pattern`.

- For complex if/else logic, use its `match().with().exhaustive()` syntax.
- For millisecond durations, use its exported `ms('24h')`-style functions to keep them semantic.
