# CLAUDE.md

Entry point for Claude sessions in this repo. Load only the doc the task needs:

- **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)** — how the project works: build, the Git + release workflow, hard-won conventions and don'ts. **Read this first for orientation.**
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — how the app is built: feature layout, the event bus, the connection ↔ notification separation, and per-feature design. Read when implementing or changing a feature.
- **[issues-backlog.md](issues-backlog.md)** — known bugs, deferred items, and design notes for unshipped roadmap work.
- **[README.md](README.md)** — the public, user-facing description (features, install, roadmap status). Keep it user-focused.
- **`.claude/LOCAL.md`** *(local, untracked)* — this machine's setup and how Claude collaborates with the maintainer (testing, commits, PRs, MCP tooling). Read if present; not project policy.

Conventions and the Git/release workflow live in **DEVELOPMENT.md** — don't restate them elsewhere.
