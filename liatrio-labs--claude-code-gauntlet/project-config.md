# AGENTS.md

`claude-code-gauntlet` is a Claude Code marketplace plugin — no server, database, or Docker.
"Running it" means running the test suites and the stdlib-only Python pipeline scripts.

Directory-scoped rules live in nested `AGENTS.md` files: `workflows/`, `scripts/`, `agents/`.
Read the one for the directory you are editing.

## Design

**Build the mechanism, not the instruction.** Whatever code, a schema, a data structure, or a
removed capability can enforce, it must. Prose in an instruction, prompt, or agent file is the
fallback for what cannot be made structural.

**"Add more text" is a design smell.** If that is the fix under consideration, the shape is
wrong — change the shape.

**Extending should cost one edit.** A new dimension, field, or agent belongs in one place. If it
takes coordinated edits across N files, fix the shape rather than documenting the ritual.

## Tooling boundary (no npm in the tree)

- No `package.json`, lockfile, or `node_modules` is tracked in the repository.
- The shipped pipeline runtime (`workflows/src`, `workflows/pipeline.js`) has zero
  dependencies — language globals plus the host-injected `agent`/`parallel`/
  `pipeline`/`args` only. No import survives into the bundle: `build.js` strips
  relative sibling imports and *fails* on any other specifier, which would ship
  as an undefined reference. See `workflows/AGENTS.md` for the sandbox surface.
- Pinned static binaries in CI are permitted (e.g. Biome for the `js-lint` job).
  Bumps are manual and deliberate; do not add a package manifest to get Dependabot
  coverage for those pins.
- This does not forbid npm on the CI runner (`validate.yml` already installs the
  Claude Code CLI globally).

## Scripts

- **stdlib-only Python.** No pip dependencies in shipped `scripts/` runtime —
  nothing under `scripts/` may import a non-stdlib module. Pinned CI tooling in
  `pyproject.toml` `[dependency-groups]` (pytest, pytest-cov, coverage) is exempt
  and never runs inside the plugin.
- **Language-agnostic.** Scripts must not assume a language in the reviewed codebase. Use
  `--exclude-dir` for non-source directories, never `--include=*.py`-style filters.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q            # pipeline + boundary parity
python -m pytest bench/tests/ -q      # benchmark harness self-tests
node --test workflows/test/*.test.js  # needs Node 24; the bare directory is not a valid target
```

Coverage gates (CI; JS on Node 24.18.0, Python on 3.12). Each command is
self-contained and byte-identical to the matching `run:` body in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Locally, coverage data files must stay out of the
repo tree (an in-tree data file trips the bench plugin-mutation guard):

```bash
COVERAGE_FILE="$(mktemp -d)/.coverage" python -m pytest tests/ -q \
  --cov=scripts --cov=.github --cov-fail-under=91.8

COVERAGE_FILE="$(mktemp -d)/.coverage" python -m pytest bench/tests/ -q \
  --cov=bench --cov-fail-under=87

LCOV="$(mktemp -d)/js-coverage.lcov" && node --test --experimental-test-coverage \
  --test-coverage-include='workflows/src/*.js' \
  --test-coverage-include='workflows/build.js' \
  --test-coverage-lines=98 \
  --test-coverage-branches=83.3 \
  --test-coverage-functions=97.2 \
  --test-reporter=spec --test-reporter-destination=stdout \
  --test-reporter=lcov --test-reporter-destination="$LCOV" \
  workflows/test/*.test.js \
  && node workflows/test/tools/check_coverage_presence.mjs "$LCOV"
```

Floors: Python 91.8 / 87 (scripts raised 2026-08-10 from PR #171 3.12 CI:
92.77; bench pinned 2026-08-03: 87.96); JS 98 / 83.3 / 97.2 (lines pinned
2026-08-03 from first green CI: 98.61; branches/functions raised 2026-08-10
from PR #171 CI: 84.23/98.18). Policy: a floor sits no more than 1.0 pp below the CI
measurement for that gate; lower a floor only in the PR that causes the drop,
reason in the body; raise when measured headroom exceeds 1.0 pp. A sudden
multi-point JS drop usually means a deleted fixture group or an unloaded
module (presence check); a sudden multi-point Python drop means broken
subprocess capture — fix capture, do not lower.
`workflows/test/tools/record_parity.py` is test infrastructure, outside Python
scopes. JS measures `workflows/build.js` + loaded `workflows/src/*.js` via the
include allowlist; `pipeline_entry.js` is exempt from presence only.

After editing `workflows/src/*.js`, rebuild and confirm the bundle is unchanged:

```bash
node workflows/build.js && git diff --exit-code workflows/pipeline.js
```

**A regression test must fail against the bug it names.** Verify that by mutating the
implementation and watching it go red — not by reading the test. Mutate the whole mechanism; a
partial mutation falls through to a neighbouring fallback and passes misleadingly.

## Lint

`pre-commit run --all-files` is the gate.

- `markdownlint-fix` rewrites files in place, then reports failure if it changed anything. A
  "Failed / files were modified by this hook" result means the fixes are already applied — re-stage
  and re-run.
- `CHANGELOG.md` is excluded from that hook deliberately; it is regenerated on every release. Do
  not re-add it.
- pre-commit sees **git-tracked files only**. A new file is invisible to every hook until
