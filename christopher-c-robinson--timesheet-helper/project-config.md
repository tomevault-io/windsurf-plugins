# Timesheet Helper Copilot Instructions
- Purpose: small Python utilities for processing copy/pasted Microsoft Word timesheets plus a couple of Azure DevOps/test-report helpers.
- Core flow (`timesheet.py`):
  - Paste the Word bullet text into the `timesheet` string. Day headers start with the `•` (U+2022) bullet followed by a weekday; task lines start with `o` and include time spans like `8-12, 1-5`.
  - `timesheet_helper.replace_with_duration` parses `HH[:MM]-HH[:MM]` spans in 12-hour format; if the end hour is less than the start, 12 hours are added (afternoon handling, not midnight crossing). Outputs per-task durations, per-day totals, and a weekly total with ANSI bold/underline for day headers.
  - `remove_times.remove_timespans` strips the time spans but preserves the day/task grouping; uses the same day/task regex assumptions as `replace_with_duration`. Tasks are re-bulleted with `•` in the output (tab-indented).
  - `timesheet.py` prints separators and both outputs by default; comment out the call you do not need.
- Shared parsing conventions:
  - Regex for days: `^\s*•\s*(\w+day)` (literal bullet + weekday). Changing the bullet marker requires updating both helper modules.
  - Task regex strips a leading `o` bullet and replaces it with `•`; keep that structure when modifying parsing or sample input.
  - Time math assumes all spans stay within a single calendar day; overlapping spans are summed; comma-separated spans per line are supported.
- Web interface (`app.py`):
  - Flask form at `/` renders `templates/index.html`; processes the same timesheet text and strips ANSI codes for web display.
  - Configure with `FLASK_DEBUG`, `FLASK_HOST`, `FLASK_PORT` env vars.
- Other utilities:
  - `task_duration.py` scans `ROOT_DIR` for files with `EXTENSIONS` and sums time spans on lines that match `WORK_ITEM`. Uses `python-docx` for `.docx` files; update the default Windows path and work item values for your environment.
  - `extract_failed_tests_from_xml.py` walks `~/Downloads` and `~/results/reports` for XML files containing "report" in the name; collects `<test-case result="Failed">` names, prints counts, and copies a `(name1|name2|...)` string to the clipboard via `pyperclip`. Adjust `dirs`/`file_paths` for other locations.
  - `azureDevopsAPI.py` loads `.env` (`API_VERSION`, `ORGANIZATION`, `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`) and fetches test plan suite info for `test_case_id` using the Azure DevOps REST API; prints JSON. Keep PATs in `.env`, not in code.
- Running things:
  - `requirements.txt` provides Flask for the web app. Install other deps as needed: `python -m pip install requests python-dotenv pyperclip python-docx`.
  - Run from repo root: `python timesheet.py`, `python app.py`, `python extract_failed_tests_from_xml.py`, `python azureDevopsAPI.py`, `python task_duration.py`.
  - Scripts emit ANSI styling for bold/underline; if the Windows console shows raw codes, adjust both helper modules consistently.
- Maintenance tips:
  - Keep day/task regexes in `remove_times.py` and `timesheet_helper.py` in sync.
  - When changing the timesheet sample, maintain the bullet structure (`•` day bullets, `o` task bullets, comma-separated spans) so parsing keeps working.
