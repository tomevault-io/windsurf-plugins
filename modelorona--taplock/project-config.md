# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
`TapLock` is a single-module Android app. Application code lives in `app/src/main/java/com/ah/taplock`; the Compose theme is under `app/src/main/java/com/ah/taplock/ui/theme`. Manifest and XML resources live in `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and `app/src/main/res`. Local JVM tests live in `app/src/test/...`; device and emulator tests live in `app/src/androidTest/...`. Shared dependency versions are managed in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. `screenshots/` contains store and reference images. Treat `app/build/` as generated output and do not edit it by hand.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `./gradlew assembleDebug`: build the debug APK.
- `./gradlew installDebug`: install the debug build on a connected device or emulator.
- `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`: run JVM unit tests such as `DoubleTapDetectorTest`.
- `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest`: run Compose and instrumentation tests on a connected device or emulator.
- `./gradlew lint`: run Android Lint for the default variant.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use Kotlin official style (`kotlin.code.style=official`) with 4-space indentation. Keep classes, services, and composables in `PascalCase`; prefer descriptive function and test names such as `twoTapsWithinTimeout_returnsDoubleTap`. Use `snake_case` for Android resources such as `widget_layout.xml` and `ic_lock_tile.xml`. Keep new UI work aligned with the existing Jetpack Compose and Material 3 stack, and add permissions or services only when strictly necessary.

## Testing Guidelines
Put pure logic tests in `app/src/test` and UI or integration coverage in `app/src/androidTest`. Name test files after the target class (`FooTest.kt`) and keep test methods behavior-first. Run `testDebugUnitTest` for logic changes and `connectedDebugAndroidTest` for UI, widget, accessibility, or preference flows. Lint should pass before submitting.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history favors short, imperative, lower-case subjects such as `fix lint issues`, `update version`, or `add onboarding flow`; reference issues when relevant. Keep commits focused and avoid mixing UI, build, and refactor work. Pull requests should explain the user-visible change, list the verification commands you ran, and include screenshots for Compose, widget, or settings changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
TapLock is privacy-sensitive: avoid adding network permissions, analytics, or broader accessibility or overlay behavior without clear justification in the pull request. Keep SDK and dependency changes in sync across `app/build.gradle.kts` and `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
