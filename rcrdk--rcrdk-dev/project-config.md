# Reducer Naming Conventions

Use this rule when creating or editing Redux (or similar) reducer functions and their files.

### Reducer Function Naming

- Reducer function names should be in **camelCase** with `reducer` suffix.
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate what the reducer manages.

- ✅ Good:
  ```typescript
  function mapReducer(state: MapState, action: MapAction): MapState {}
  function userReducer(state: UserState, action: UserAction): UserState {}
  ```

- ❌ Bad:
  ```typescript
  function map(state: MapState, action: MapAction): MapState {}
  function MapReducer(state: MapState, action: MapAction): MapState {}
  function map_reducer(state: MapState, action: MapAction): MapState {}
  ```

### Reducer File Naming

- Reducer files should be named in **kebab-case** with `-reducer` suffix.
- File names should match the reducer function name (converted to kebab-case).

- ✅ Good:
  - File: `map-reducer.ts` → Reducer: `mapReducer`
  - File: `user-reducer.ts` → Reducer: `userReducer`

- ❌ Bad:
  - File: `map.ts` → Reducer: `mapReducer`
  - File: `mapReducer.ts` → Reducer: `mapReducer`
  - File: `map_reducer.ts` → Reducer: `mapReducer`

### Reducer Exports

- Reducers should be exported as named exports.
- Export both the reducer function and any related constants (like initial state).

- ✅ Good:
  ```typescript
  export { INITIAL_MAP_STATE, mapReducer }
  ```

- ❌ Bad:
  ```typescript
  export default mapReducer
  ```
