# Creating Cursor Rules

Use this rule when creating or editing Cursor rules. It defines where rules live, how to name them, and their structure.

## 1. Location

Always place rule files in `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/`:

```
PROJECT_ROOT/
└── .cursor/
    └── rules/
        ├── your-rule-name.mdc
        ├── another-rule.mdc
        └── ...
```

Never place rule files in the project root, in subdirectories outside `.cursor/rules`, or anywhere else.

## 2. Naming

- Use **kebab-case** for filenames (e.g. `creating-cursor-rules.mdc`).
- Use the **.mdc** extension.
- Use names that clearly describe the rule’s purpose.

## 3. File structure

Each rule file must have:

1. **YAML front matter** at the top, between `---` lines.
2. **Markdown body**: title, explanation, steps, and optional code examples.

### Front matter

```yaml
---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/*
alwaysApply: false
---
```

- `description`: short summary (e.g. for the rule picker).
- `globs`: optional; file pattern so the rule applies when matching files are in context (e.g. `**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.tsx`).
- `alwaysApply`: `true` if the rule should apply in every conversation; `false` if it applies only when matching files are relevant.

### Body

- Start with a level-1 heading: `# Rule Title`.
- Use markdown for the main explanation.
- Prefer:
  1. Step-by-step instructions
  2. Code examples (good vs bad when useful)
  3. Clear guidelines

Example:

```markdown
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:

\`\`\`typescript
// Good
function goodExample() {
  // Implementation following guidelines
}

// Bad
function badExample() {
  // Implementation not following guidelines
}
\`\`\`
```

## 4. Best practices

- One main concern per rule; split broad topics into several rules.
- Prefer short, actionable rules (e.g. under 50 lines when possible).
- Prefer concrete examples (good vs bad) over long prose.
- Use `alwaysApply: true` only for rules that must apply in every chat; otherwise use `globs` and `alwaysApply: false`.

## 5. Checklist when creating a rule

- [ ] File is in `.cursor/rules/` with a `.mdc` extension.
- [ ] Filename is kebab-case and descriptive.
- [ ] YAML front matter has `description`; set `globs` and `alwaysApply` as needed.
- [ ] Body has a `# Rule Title` and clear instructions/examples.
- [ ] Rule is focused and reasonably short.
