# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Bezy is a font editor built with Rust and the Bevy game engine. It's designed as a modern, user-empowerable font editing tool that follows modernist design principles. The codebase is intentionally simple and readable for education purposes.

## Key Technologies

- **Bevy**: ECS-based game engine for the UI framework
- **Norad**: UFO font format parsing and manipulation
- **Kurbo**: 2D curve mathematics
- **Rust**: Core programming language

## Development Commands

### Basic Development
```bash
# Run the application (default: Bezy Grotesk font, glyph 'a')
cargo run

# Run with specific UFO font
cargo run -- --load-ufo <path_to_ufo>

# Run with specific Unicode character
cargo run -- --test-unicode <hex_codepoint>

# Debug mode with verbose logging
cargo run -- --debug --log-level debug
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code (max width: 80 characters per rustfmt.toml)
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Build Variants
```bash
# Development build with dynamic linking (faster compilation)
cargo run --features dev

# WASM build for web deployment
./build-wasm.sh
# or manually:
cargo run --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Release build
cargo build --release
```

## Architecture Overview

### Module Structure
- **`core/`**: Application initialization, CLI, settings, state management
- **`data/`**: UFO font data handling, Unicode utilities, workspace management
- **`editing/`**: Edit operations, selection system, undo/redo, text editing
- **`geometry/`**: Geometric primitives, paths, points, design space coordinates
- **`rendering/`**: Drawing systems, glyph outlines, visual feedback
- **`systems/`**: Bevy systems for input handling, UI interaction, commands
- **`ui/`**: User interface components, toolbars, panes, themes

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### ECS-Based Design
The application uses Bevy's Entity-Component-System pattern. Major systems include:
- **Selection System**: Manages point/component selection state
- **Edit System**: Handles glyph modifications and undo operations
- **Input System**: Processes keyboard/mouse events
- **Rendering System**: Draws glyphs, UI elements, and visual feedback

#### State Management
- **AppState**: Main application state resource
- **GlyphNavigation**: Current glyph and font navigation
- **BezySettings**: Configuration and preferences

#### Plugin Architecture
The application is composed of plugins:
- **Core plugins**: Input, pointer management, settings
- **UI plugins**: HUD, panes, toolbars
- **Editing plugins**: Selection, undo, text editing
- **Rendering plugins**: Cameras, drawing systems

### Design Philosophy

#### Visual Theming
All visual styling constants MUST be declared in `src/ui/theme.rs`. No visual constants should exist outside this file to enable complete theme swapping.

#### Code Style
- Max line width: 80 characters (enforced by rustfmt.toml)
- Simple, readable code suitable for educational purposes
- Modernist "less is more" approach
- Game-like feel with fast, engaging interactions

#### Rendering Architecture - Unified System
The application uses a **single unified rendering system** located in `src/rendering/unified_glyph_editing.rs` that handles ALL glyph visualization:

##### Core Principles
- **NEVER use Bevy Gizmos**: All world-space visual elements MUST use mesh-based rendering for proper z-ordering, camera-responsive scaling, and visual consistency
- **Single rendering system**: The unified system eliminates coordination complexity and ensures reliable cleanup
- **Camera-responsive scaling**: All visual elements work with the zoom-aware scaling system
- **Mesh-based only**: Gizmos cause problems with layering, scaling, and maintainability

##### Unified Rendering Behavior
- **Active sorts**: Show editable points, handles, and outlines for interactive editing
- **Inactive sorts**: Render as filled shapes using Lyon tessellation with proper winding rules (EvenOdd fill rule)
- **Zero visual lag**: All components (points, handles, outlines) render together using live Transform data
- **Proper vector rendering**: Handles font counters/holes correctly (e.g., the hole in letter 'a')

##### Technical Implementation
- **Lyon tessellation**: Converts vector paths to filled meshes for inactive sorts
- **Combined contours**: All contours processed as single path for correct winding rule handling  
- **EvenOdd fill rule**: Standard font rendering approach that properly handles counters
- **Camera-responsive scaling**: Uses `CameraResponsiveScale` for zoom-appropriate visual sizing
- **Entity tracking**: `UnifiedGlyphEntities` resource tracks all rendered elements for reliable cleanup

### Font Data Model

The application uses FontIR as the primary runtime data structure:
- **FontIR**: The single source of truth for font data that gets modified during editing
- **Data Flow**: Load font sources (UFO, TTF, OTF, etc.) → FontIR runtime structure → Edit FontIR data → Save back to disk
- **Transform Components**: Only for visual positioning in UI, NOT the source of truth
