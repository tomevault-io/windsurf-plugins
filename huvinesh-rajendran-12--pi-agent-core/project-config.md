# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
uv run pytest                          # Run all 25 tests
uv run pytest tests/test_agent.py      # Run agent tests only
uv run pytest -k test_tool_execution   # Run a single test by name
uv run pytest -v --tb=short            # Verbose with short tracebacks
uv run ruff check .                    # Lint (pycodestyle, pyflakes, isort, bugbear, simplify)
uv run ruff format .                   # Auto-format
uv sync                               # Install / sync dependencies
```

## Architecture

This is a Python port of the TypeScript `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core` package — a stateful LLM agent framework with tool execution, event streaming, and message queuing.

### Layer Diagram

```
agent.py (Agent)          ← High-level stateful wrapper, subscriptions, queues
    ↓
agent_loop.py             ← Core orchestration: prompt→stream→tools→steering loop
    ↓
StreamFn (user-provided)  ← User implements their own LLM streaming integration
    or
proxy.py (stream_proxy)   ← SSE proxy client as a StreamFn implementation
```

### Key Abstractions

**StreamFn protocol** — The library is LLM-agnostic. Users provide a `stream_fn(model, context, options) -> StreamResult` that yields `AssistantMessageEvent` objects and implements `async result() -> AssistantMessage`. The proxy module provides one implementation; users write their own for direct LLM calls.

**Message transformation pipeline** — Messages are stored as `AgentMessage` (extensible) throughout, and converted to LLM-compatible `Message[]` only at the call boundary via the user-provided `convert_to_llm` callback.

**Two-level event system** — `AgentEvent` (10 types) covers agent lifecycle, turns, messages, and tool execution. `AssistantMessageEvent` (12 types) covers LLM streaming primitives (text/thinking/toolcall deltas). Agent subscribers receive `AgentEvent`; the loop internally consumes `AssistantMessageEvent` from the stream.

**Steering & follow-up queues** — Steering messages interrupt mid-turn (skip remaining tool calls). Follow-up messages trigger new turns after completion. Both use async callbacks with "one-at-a-time" or "all" dequeue modes.

### Module Responsibilities

- **types.py** — All Pydantic models: content blocks, messages, events, tool definitions, config, state, and the `StreamResult` protocol
- **agent_loop.py** — `agent_loop()` and `agent_loop_continue()` as async generators. Handles streaming, tool execution with cancellation, steering interruption, and follow-up continuation
- **agent.py** — `Agent` class wrapping the loop with state management, event subscription, abort/reset, and queue management. `continue_()` uses trailing underscore to avoid keyword conflict
- **proxy.py** — `stream_proxy()` SSE client using httpx. Reconstructs partial messages from server-stripped delta events. Uses `asyncio.Queue` internally to bridge push-based SSE to async iteration

### Cancellation

Uses `asyncio.Event` (not `AbortSignal` from TS). The Agent creates a cancel event per run; `abort()` sets it. The loop and tools check it cooperatively.

### Steering Check Timing (TS vs Python)

The TypeScript original checks steering **after** each tool completes via push-based streams (`stream.push()` notifies subscribers synchronously before the steering check runs). Python uses async generators where events are batched and yielded to the caller between iterations. Subscribers only see events **after** `_run_loop` yields them, which happens between `_execute_tool_calls` iterations — not inside it.

Therefore, the Python equivalent of TS's "check after tool N" is "check before tool N+1" (`if index > 0`). This ensures subscribers have processed the previous tool's events before steering is polled. Do **not** move the steering check to after tool execution inside `_execute_tool_calls` — it will always miss steering because events haven't reached subscribers yet.

## Style Guide

Enforced by **ruff** (`uv run ruff check .` / `uv run ruff format .`). Each rule maps back to a Zen principle:

| Zen aphorism | Ruff rule set | What it enforces |
|---|---|---|
| "Readability counts" | `E`, `W` (pycodestyle) | Whitespace, line length ≤ 120, PEP 8 |
| "Errors should never pass silently" | `F` (pyflakes), `B` (bugbear) | Unused imports/vars, common bugs, mutable defaults |
| "There should be one obvious way" | `I` (isort) | Deterministic import order |
| "Beautiful is better than ugly" | `UP` (pyupgrade) | Modern syntax (`X \| Y` unions, f-strings, etc.) |
| "Simple is better than complex" | `SIM` (simplify) | Simplifiable `if`/`return`/`with` patterns |
| Miscellaneous quality | `RUF` | Ruff-specific checks |

Conventions:
- **Line length**: 120 characters max
- **Quotes**: double (`"`) — enforced by `ruff format`
- **Imports**: stdlib → third-party → first-party (`pi_agent_core`), one import per line for `from` imports
- **Type annotations**: use `X | Y` for new code; `Union[X, Y]` is allowed in Pydantic model fields
- **`__init__.py`**: F401 (unused import) is ignored — re-exports are intentional

## The Zen of Python (PEP 20)

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
