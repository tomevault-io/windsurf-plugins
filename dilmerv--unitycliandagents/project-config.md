# Agent Instructions

## Unity Editor operations

- Use the Unity CLI and Unity Pipeline commands for all Unity Editor operations. Do not edit live Editor state through unrelated automation.
- Before beginning Editor work, run `unity command` to discover the commands exposed by the connected Pipeline version.
- Then run `unity command editor_status` and proceed only when the result reports `status: ready`.
- Run `unity command ...` with permission to inspect the host Unity process. Sandboxed process discovery can misclassify the live Pipeline descriptor as stale, remove it, and make the server appear unreachable.
- If discovery fails, inspect `unity pipeline list`. A running project with the Pipeline package installed but no PID, server port, or reachable server usually indicates failed process validation or a server startup problem.
- Prefer commands from the discovered command list instead of assuming command names or parameters.

## Required verification

- After making Editor or project changes, wait until compilation and domain reloads finish and confirm `editor_status` is ready.
- Check the Unity console for errors with `unity command get_console_logs --severity Error --limit 100`.
- Capture the Game view through Pipeline, for example:
 `unity command screenshot --view game --output <absolute-workspace-path>.png --width 1280 --height 720`
- Visually inspect the captured screenshot before reporting completion.
- Report compilation failures, console errors, screenshot failures, or unexpected visual results rather than claiming success.

## Safety

- Use dry-run and confirmation parameters when exposed by destructive Pipeline commands.
- Preserve existing scenes and assets unless the task explicitly requires changing or deleting them.
- Store generated verification artifacts under the project workspace, preferably `Temp/`, unless the user requests another location.
