# AuraLink Project Audit Report

**Date:** April 8, 2026
**Auditor:** Gemini CLI
**Status:** ⚠️ Critical Issues Found

## 1. Executive Summary
The AuraLink project has a strong foundation in domain modeling and biomechanical logic, but it currently suffers from a fundamental architectural contradiction regarding user privacy. While the product positioning and in-app disclaimers promise an offline-only experience, the implementation includes a fully functional Firebase cloud-syncing layer. Additionally, there are several high-severity technical issues related to resource management and app stability.

## 2. Critical Findings

### 2.1 Privacy & Architectural Contradiction
- **Issue:** README and `DisclaimerView` promise "zero data transmission," yet `FirestoreService` and `AuthService` are implemented and wired in `providers.dart`.
- **Evidence:** `lib/core/services/firestore_service.dart` contains `syncLocalAssessments` which automatically uploads local data to Firestore/Storage if a user is signed in.
- **Impact:** Direct violation of the primary product constraint. Risk of legal and reputational damage.

### 2.2 Resource Leaks (Memory & Timers)
- **Issue:** `MockPoseEstimationService` does not safely manage its stream controllers and timers.
- **Evidence:** `processFrame` overwrites the `_controller` and `_timer` fields on every call. If the service is reused without `dispose()`, previous timers continue to run in the background.
- **Impact:** Performance degradation and potential crashes during long sessions or multiple screening attempts.

### 2.3 Stability & Security (Forced Unwraps)
- **Issue:** Use of the bang operator (`!`) on nullable Firebase user objects.
- **Evidence:** `lib/core/services/auth_service.dart:16`: `return credential.user!.uid;`.
- **Impact:** High risk of runtime crashes if Firebase returns a null user (e.g., due to network or configuration issues).

## 3. Medium Severity Findings

### 3.1 Unreachable Code & Broken Tests
- **Issue:** The `initialLocation` in `router.dart` is set to `/disclaimer`, bypassing the `/` route entirely.
- **Evidence:** `lib/core/router.dart`.
- **Impact:** `widget_test.dart` is currently failing as it expects the `SplashView` which is never rendered. Redundant code in `_SplashView`.

### 3.2 Logic Fragmentation
- **Issue:** Core "Chain Reasoning" logic is split between `MockChainMapper` and `ReportView`.
- **Evidence:** `ReportView._buildReport` contains significant mapping and recommendation logic that should reside in the domain/service layer.
- **Impact:** Reduced maintainability and difficulty in unit testing the reasoning engine.

### 3.3 Service Provider Inconsistency
- **Issue:** `PdfGenerator` is used as a static utility class rather than being accessed via a Riverpod provider.
- **Evidence:** `lib/features/report/views/report_view.dart:214`.
- **Impact:** Breaks the dependency injection pattern established in the rest of the app; makes mocking the generator for tests impossible.

## 4. Low Severity Findings

### 4.1 Counter-Intuitive Enums
- **Issue:** `ConfidenceLevel` enum is ordered `high, medium, low`.
- **Evidence:** `lib/domain/models.dart`.
- **Impact:** Index-based comparisons (`index > worst.index`) are correct but counter-intuitive (higher index = lower confidence).

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Privacy Alignment:** Immediately disable `FirestoreService` syncing or remove the Firebase dependency entirely to match the privacy promise.
2.  **Resource Safety:** Refactor `MockPoseEstimationService` to cancel existing timers before starting new ones in `processFrame`.
3.  **Null Safety:** Replace forced unwraps with proper null checks and error handling in `AuthService`.
4.  **Test Repair:** Update `router.dart` or `widget_test.dart` to ensure a consistent initial state and passing CI.
5.  **Refactor:** Move report assembly logic from `ReportView` to a dedicated `ReportService` or the `ChainMapper`.
6.  **Riverpod Integration:** Wrap `PdfGenerator` in a `Provider` to maintain architectural consistency.

## 6. Audit Verdict
**Score: 5/10**
The project logic for fascial chain reasoning is impressive and well-researched, but the technical implementation risks (resource leaks, privacy contradictions, and broken tests) must be addressed before this can be considered production-ready.
