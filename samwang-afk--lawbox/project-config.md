## Legal Formal Deliverable Hard Gate

When a legal task involves a document, report, memo, case compilation, pleading, evidence list, legal opinion, client-facing material, court-facing material, or any `.docx` output, classify the deliverable before writing substantive content:

1. `工作草稿`: internal draft only; may be Markdown; must be named with `草稿` or `未出稿审查` if not reviewed.
2. `律师内部报告`: internal strategy analysis; may include risk assessment and litigation suggestions; must still include source boundary, reading review, and legal verification when it cites materials, cases, or law.
3. `提交法院/客户的正式材料`: court-facing or client-facing; must follow the applicable legal Skill template, stay clean and professional, and include required source boundary records.
4. `Word正式交付物`: any formal `.docx`; must pass the full legal export chain before being called final or formal.

For every legal `.docx` or formal legal deliverable, stop and verify these gate items before export:

- Current matter matches `【自定义工作目录】/_系统记录/当前事项.md`; if it does not, switch/build the matter first or ask before continuing.
- The correct legal Skill has been selected, including whether the output is a 法官版、律师版、诉讼文书、证据目录、法律意见 or other type.
- Before writing substantive content, the corresponding legal template/reference file has been identified and recorded, with its key format requirements stated. After generation, run a reverse structure check against that template. For `证据目录`, the controlling template is `诉讼文书起草/templates/证据目录格式.md`; it must use grouped textual paragraphs with `第一组证据` and `证明目的`, and must not be output as a table unless the user expressly overrides this template.
- All cited case/material files have a `读取复查摘要`.
- All cited statutes, regulations, judicial interpretations, or current legal rules have a `法规校验摘要`.
- A `来源边界记录` exists and states verified, unverified, and output boundaries.
- Any user choice that changes scope, version, strategy, amount, claim, authorization, or whether to include/exclude negative cases is recorded in `用户确认记录`.
- Formal Word output has `draft.html`, `preflight-meta.json`, `draft_checked.html`, `出稿前审查报告.md`, and the report status is `PASS` or `FIXED_PASS`.
- Formal Word output is generated only through `法律文书模板与导出` (`html_to_docx.py`) and passes `health_check.py`.

Never treat "content completed" as "legal work completed." A formal legal deliverable is complete only when the required matter routing, template confirmation, reverse structure check, source evidence files, preflight review, export chain, and health check are complete. Direct `pandoc md -> docx` export is allowed only for clearly labeled experiments or drafts, never for a formal legal deliverable.

## Legal Reasoning Layer

Every legal task gets a reasoning level (`推理等级`) before execution, chosen as the lowest sufficient level: L0 (direct answer for simple legal knowledge questions; no Matter Model, no adversarial review), L1 (standard case/contract/document work with a simplified Matter Model), L2 (deliberative: competing legal relationships/causes of action, disputed key facts, strategy or risk decisions), L3 (adversarial: major litigation, formal legal opinions, high-impact matters, or an explicit user request for a devil's-advocate stress test). The controlling protocols live in `skills/legal/法律工作总控/references/` (`reasoning-mode-protocol.md`, `legal-clarification-protocol.md`, `matter-model-protocol.md`, `adversarial-review-protocol.md`, `judgment-protocol.md`), with an executable reference implementation at `skills/legal/法律工作总控/scripts/reasoning_control.py`.

Hard rules:

- Every case fact carries an epistemic status: `CONFIRMED` / `ASSERTED` / `DISPUTED` / `INFERRED` / `UNKNOWN`. Never turn a user assertion (e.g. "he borrowed 200k from me") into an unconditional fact; user labels never auto-decide the legal relationship when contrary material exists.
- Only decision-relevant unknowns that cannot be resolved from existing material or research may be asked to the user (`Blocking Unknown`); at most 1-5 questions per round, ordered Decision > Scope > Evidence > Output > Formatting.
- For L2/L3 tasks, formal drafting of facts/claims/legal argument must happen after Ludus adversarial review and Judgment. The reviewer must produce specific failure mechanisms (Minimum Failure Set), never generic "there is still risk".
- Drafting permission is `PASS` / `CONDITIONAL` / `BLOCKED`. `BLOCKED` forbids formal drafting. `CONDITIONAL` requires explicit assumption/claim/unconfirmed markers in the draft. Preflight review (`preflight_check.py`) hard-blocks exports with `BLOCKED` and requires a Judgment record for declared L2/L3 documents.
- Internal reasoning artifacts (Matter Model, review, Judgment) stay in the system-record area (`推理记录/`) and must never be delivered to clients or written into formal documents.

## Shared Control Protocols

Formal legal matters additionally follow the shared protocols in `skills/legal/法律工作总控/references/`:
