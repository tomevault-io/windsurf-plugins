# ToppleCat Contributor Instructions

ToppleCat is a delegation verification gate for Java/JUnit projects. Ordinary
Java acceptance tests and typed JSON/YAML case data are authoritative; generated
JSON and HTML are evidence.

## Start Here

Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `CONTEXT.md` first. Use the task map to find the
relevant implementation documents and verification commands, and use the
context glossary's formal terms consistently.

Before proposing, comparing, reviewing, scoping, or delegating a new or changed
product behavior, use the repository `topplecat-product-design` skill and
present its Product Frame before solutions.

Before changing supported behavior, read:

- `README.md`
- `docs/product.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/guide/authoring.md`
- `docs/guide/verification-and-evidence.md`

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Specs and issues use the repository-local Markdown tracker under `.scratch/`.
See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Domain docs

This is a single-context repository rooted at `CONTEXT.md`. See
`docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Design Records And Documentation

- Do not leave an accepted product design only in a chat, prompt, issue, or
  agent handoff. Before delegating implementation, record it under
  `docs/design/` using the structure in `docs/design/README.md`.
- Check the design index before creating a record. Merge a narrow follow-up into
  its owning current document, and delete completed task plans or redundant
  research after their lasting conclusion is recorded; do not create a
  searchable archive of obsolete guidance.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` short and durable: put mandatory boundaries, work rules, and
  document routing here. Put feature examples, alternatives, detailed behavior,
  failure semantics, and acceptance cases in the active design record.
- Treat `docs/product.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and the guides as the current
  implemented product. Every retained design record is `Accepted`, describes
  intended work only, and must not be presented as an available feature.
- When implementation changes supported behavior, merge the lasting design
  into Product, Architecture, the affected guide, glossary, tests, skills, and
  user-facing documentation, then delete the completed design record in the
  same change. Link to one canonical explanation instead of copying details.
- If code, tests, design records, and current-product documentation disagree,
  stop and identify the conflict. Do not silently choose the version that makes
  the task easiest.

## Product Boundaries

- Humans and their external SDD, workflow, or task system choose the current
  Spec, manage delivery history, and decide any organizational sign-off.
  ToppleCat is not a task manager, Spec lifecycle manager, or approval system.
- Humans remain responsible for making the selected rules and cases complete.
  Do not make ToppleCat infer missing business requirements or judge behavior
  outside the executable contract.
- ToppleCat starts at the executable acceptance boundary: bind selected ACs to
  ordinary Java/JUnit tests and typed case rows, keep the public contract handed
  to the implementation agent identical to the contract run by verification,
  and test the agent's done claim.
- Treat a ToppleCat reviewer approval as a mechanical integrity seal over
  contract bytes and verification policy, not proof of human or organizational
  sign-off.
- Treat generated JSON and HTML only as projections of the checked contract.
  Rendering must not add, omit, or reinterpret rules, cases, expected values,
  or compiler-defined scenario steps.
- Keep the four-module layout: `topplecat-core`, `topplecat-junit`,
  `topplecat-report`, and `topplecat-gradle-plugin`.
- Keep public tests and case data under `src/test`; keep the complete
  reviewer-only source set under `src/hiddenTest`.
- Do not introduce a second authoring language, a command-line interface, or a
  new compatibility surface.
- Never put reviewer-only values, identifiers, paths, source names, or raw
  failures from an actual delivery in public implementation-handoff material or
  `agent-feedback.json`. The public project page is a separate human-facing
  explanation surface: it may show a clearly labelled, fully synthetic red-team
  demonstration, including synthetic report details, but must never present
  material from an actual delivery as a demonstration.

## Verification

Develop with the narrowest relevant test, then run:

```bash
./gradlew check
GRADLE_CMD=./gradlew scripts/verify-release.sh
```

`toppleCatVerify` and `build/topplecat/evidence.json` provide the final contract
verdict. A green `test` task is development feedback only.

## Human Communication

- Explain product behavior with a concrete example before introducing the
  implementation term. For example, first describe which checkout and coupon
  cases run for one delivery, then name the mechanism "Spec-scoped hidden
  retest."
- Lead with the human problem and visible outcome. Introduce annotations,
  Gradle task wiring, digests, schemas, gates, and class names only after the
  reader understands what they solve.
- Before asking someone to approve a technical rule, explain one concrete
