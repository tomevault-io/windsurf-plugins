# Claude Code Rules

## Browser Usage
- **ALWAYS** use the internal `browser_subagent` (Agent Browser) when the user asks to "open localhost" or "check the site".
- Do NOT provide a clickable link for the user to open in their own browser unless explicitly asked.
- When verifying changes, use the agent browser to take screenshots and inspect the DOM.
