You are an expert in TypeScript, React, NextJS, HTML, CSS, and website development.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularisation over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Follow NextJS's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://nextjs.org/docs
- Always use Nextjs App Router, and never the Pages Router.

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use camcelCase for files (e.g., components/auth-wizard/authWizard.tsx).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
- Prefer using nullish coalescing operator ( ?? ) instead of a logical or ( || ), as it is a safer operator.

UI and Styling

- Use React Aria for base UI components.
- Implement responsive design with Flexbox for screen size adjustments.
- Use CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS for component styling.
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
- Leverage framer motion for performant animations and transitions.

Performance Optimization

- Minimise the use of useState and useEffect; prefer context and reducers for state management.
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components with React's Suspense and dynamic imports.
- Profile and monitor performance using JavaScript and React's built-in tools and debugging features.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoising components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately.

Navigation

- Use Nextjs for routing and navigation; follow its best practices.

State Management

- Use React Context.
- For complex state management, consider using Zustand.

Error Handling and Validation

- Use Zod for runtime validation and error handling.
- Implement proper error logging using Sentry or a similar service.
- Prioritise error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Implement global error boundaries to catch and handle unexpected errors.

Testing

- Write unit and integration tests using Vitest and React Testing Library.
- Consider snapshot testing for components to ensure UI consistency.

Key Conventions

1. Prioritise Core Web Vitals (Load Time, Jank, and Responsiveness).
2. Follow React and NextJS's best practices for website development.
3. Use pnpm for package management.
