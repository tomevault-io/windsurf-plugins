# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

---

## Project Overview

**Rezeptmeister** is a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) AI-powered recipe management web app for the Swiss market. The full feature spec lives in `SPEC.md`. The implementation roadmap lives in `tasks/todo.md` (18 phases, each ending with Playwright E2E tests).

**Language:** All UI text, DB enums, error messages, and API responses must be in **German (Swiss standard)** — use "ss" not "ß", use Swiss units (dl, EL, TL, KL, °C) throughout.

---

## Architecture

Two separate runtimes that never import each other:

```
frontend/   → Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript) on port 3001
backend/    → FastAPI (Python, uv) on port 8000
db          → PostgreSQL + pgvector (Docker) on port 5432
uploads/    → Local filesystem (originals/ and thumbnails/) in dev
```

**Frontend** owns: auth (NextAuth.js), recipe CRUD API routes, image upload, shopping list, collections, meal plans, notes — all via Drizzle ORM directly to PostgreSQL.

**FastAPI backend** owns exclusively: AI pipeline — embeddings (Gemini Embedding 2), OCR, recipe suggestions, image generation, URL import, web search, nutrition calculation, semantic/hybrid search. It never handles auth; it receives the user's API key from the Next.js proxy on each request.

**Key architectural rule:** Next.js API routes proxy AI requests to FastAPI, injecting the user's decrypted API key server-side. The key is never sent to the browser.

## Common Commands

### Docker (start everything)
```bash
docker compose up -d          # Start PostgreSQL + pgvector + FastAPI
docker compose down           # Stop all services
docker compose logs backend   # FastAPI logs
docker compose logs db        # DB logs
```

### Frontend (Next.js)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev         # Dev server on http://localhost:3001
npm run build       # Production build (run this before merging — tsc alone misses next.js errors)
npm run lint        # ESLint
npx drizzle-kit generate   # Generate Drizzle migration from schema changes
npx drizzle-kit migrate    # Apply migrations to DB
npx drizzle-kit studio     # Drizzle Studio (visual DB browser)
```

### Backend (FastAPI + uv)
```bash
cd backend
uv sync                        # Install dependencies
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000   # Dev server
uv run alembic upgrade head    # Apply DB migrations
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"  # Generate migration
uv run pytest                  # All tests
uv run pytest tests/test_embeddings.py  # Single test file
uv run pytest -k "test_ocr"    # Single test by name
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright install         # First-time setup
npx playwright test            # Run all E2E tests
npx playwright test tests/phase-2.spec.ts   # Single phase test file
npx playwright test --ui       # Interactive UI mode
npx playwright show-report     # View last test report
```

## Key Conventions

### Database
- **Drizzle ORM** is used on the Next.js side for all non-AI DB access. Schema is in `frontend/src/lib/db/schema.ts`.
- **SQLAlchemy + Alembic** is used on the FastAPI side. Models are in `backend/app/models/`.
- Both ORMs point to the same PostgreSQL instance — the Drizzle schema is the source of truth for table structure; Alembic migrations must stay in sync.
- `embedding` columns are `VECTOR(3072)` (Gemini Embedding 2 default). Use HNSW index, cosine distance (`<=>` operator).
- Drizzle does not natively support `VECTOR` type — use `customType` wrapper.

### Next.js 16 – Breaking Changes
- **`middleware.ts` is renamed to `proxy.ts`** (same API, just the filename). Export a named `proxy` function or a default export. `export const config` with `matcher` still works the same.
- Route Handlers: same as Next.js 15 (`route.ts` with `GET`, `POST`, etc.)
- Fonts: `next/font/google` works the same (variable + className approach)

### Authentication & Security
- NextAuth.js Credential Provider. JWT sessions, 24h timeout.
- Passwords: bcrypt (never plain).
- User `status` must be `'approved'` to log in — enforce in NextAuth `authorize` callback.
- API keys: AES-256 encrypted at rest using `ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var (32-byte hex). Decrypted only in server-side API route handlers, never returned to client (only masked placeholder shown).
- Rate limiting: `express-rate-limit` on every Next.js API route (100 req/15 min default), stricter on `/api/ai/*` and `/api/auth/*`.
- Validate all inputs with `zod` at API route entry points.

### AI / Embeddings (FastAPI)
- Embedding model: `gemini-embedding-2-preview`, 3072 dims.
- Use `task: search_query` prefix for query embeddings, `task: search_document` for document embeddings.
- Embedding creation is always async (Background Task) — never block the HTTP response.
- All AI endpoints receive the user's API key in the request body (forwarded by Next.js proxy from server-side session). FastAPI does NOT read from DB for API keys.

### Image Handling
- Upload: validate MIME type (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`), max 10 MB.
- Thumbnail: 300×300 WebP via `sharp` (Next.js side) stored in `uploads/thumbnails/`.
