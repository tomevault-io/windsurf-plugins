# Repository guidance

This file is the shared entry point for coding assistants, regardless of provider or editor. Keep repository instructions here and task-specific detail in ordinary documentation; do not introduce parallel tool-specific instruction files. If a tool does not discover this file automatically, include it explicitly in the task context.

## Start here

- Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for branch conventions, setup, commands, and validation requirements.
- Read the relevant sections of [README.md](README.md) for public API usage, platform limitations, and release procedures.
- Inspect the working tree before editing and preserve existing user changes. Continue on the current work branch unless a new branch is requested; create a work branch before editing on `main`.
- Keep changes focused on the requested task. Report what changed, the validation performed, and any checks that could not run.

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/AutoCompleteEntry/` | Published .NET MAUI control library |
| `src/AutoCompleteEntry/AutoCompleteEntry.cs` | Public bindable properties, events, and shared state transitions |
| `src/AutoCompleteEntry/Initialization.cs` | `UseZoftAutoCompleteEntry()` registration |
| `src/AutoCompleteEntry/Handlers/` | Shared handler contract, property mapper, and command mapper |
| `src/AutoCompleteEntry/Platforms/` | Native views, platform partial handlers, and extensions |
| `src/Tests/AutoCompleteEntry.Tests/` | Shared control tests and linked platform-independent Android helpers |
| `sample/AutoCompleteEntry.Sample/` | Reference app for binding, event, and native UI scenarios |
| `src/Directory.build.props` | Shared library/test build and package metadata; does not apply to the sample |
| `global.json` | SDK selection and roll-forward policy |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI and publishing behavior |

## Coding style

- Follow the Microsoft C# conventions and repository exceptions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-style). The root [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) is the machine-readable source of formatting and style preferences for the library, platform implementations, tests, and sample.
- Use four spaces, Allman braces, braces around control-flow bodies, `System` imports first, C# type keywords, and explicit types when a local's type is not apparent. Use `_camelCase` private instance fields and `s_camelCase` private static fields; constants use PascalCase.
- Preserve public API names, binding/XAML names, framework overrides, and generated members. Keep existing namespace declaration forms and descriptive test/event-handler names. Do not change behavior to satisfy a style preference.
- Run the formatting checks in CONTRIBUTING.md after C# edits. Folder formatting covers platform files that the host's loaded project may exclude; semantic style checks and builds still need the appropriate target and host. Never edit generated files or claim native coverage from formatting.

## Control contracts

- Preserve public member names, property defaults, and binding behavior. Prefer additive or opt-in API changes.
- Preserve `UseZoftAutoCompleteEntry()` and the XAML namespace `http://zoft.MauiExtensions/Controls`.
- Consumers own filtering: they react to text changes and update `ItemsSource`. Do not move filtering into the control unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve text-change reasons: `UserInput`, `ProgrammaticChange`, and `SuggestionChosen`. `TextChangedCommand` executes for user input; programmatic changes and selection must not accidentally trigger filtering loops.
- Preserve the base `Entry.TextChanged` event as well as the control's own event.
- `SelectedSuggestion` is two-way single-selection state; `SelectedSuggestions` is authoritative in multiple mode. `TextMemberPath` determines selected text; `DisplayMemberPath` determines suggestion display. Keep multiple-mode query text separate from the selection summary.
- Keep shared behavior in the control and native wiring/rendering in platform implementations. Prefer platform partials over scattered conditional compilation in shared files.
- Unsubscribe native events in `DisconnectHandler` and release owned resources through the platform view's cleanup mechanism.

## Platform boundaries

- Android wraps `AndroidAutoCompleteEntry`; Windows wraps `AutoSuggestBox`.
- iOS and MacCatalyst each have their own `IOSAutoCompleteEntry`, handler, extensions, and table source files. These are separate, nearly identical implementations, not one shared source. Inspect both when changing Apple behavior and explain any intentional divergence.
- `Handlers/AutoCompleteEntryHandler.Standard.cs` supports the plain .NET target with no-op mappings; native view creation throws. Do not implement native UI behavior there or treat plain .NET tests as native UI coverage.
