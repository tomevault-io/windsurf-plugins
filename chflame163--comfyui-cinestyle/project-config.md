# Project Rules

## ComfyUI Debugging

- Do not start or leave a debugging ComfyUI process on port `8188`.
- Use another available port for local debugging and browser validation, and report that port in the handoff.
- Before finishing a debugging session, stop the test process and verify that port `8188` is free.
