# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
This guidance is aimed at Claude Code but may also be suitable for other AI tooling, such as GitHub Copilot and OpenAI Codex.

## Commands

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh                           # One-time: create .venv, install deps, pre-commit hooks
./scripts/run-in-env.sh pre-commit run -a    # Run linting and type checks: ruff, mypy (use before commits)
./scripts/run-in-env.sh pytest               # Run tests only
./scripts/run-in-env.sh pytest tests/server/test_push_stream_behavior.py -v  # Run specific test file
./scripts/run-in-env.sh pytest -k "test_name"  # Run tests matching pattern
```

## Architecture

**aiosendspin** is the async Python implementation of the [Sendspin Protocol](https://github.com/Sendspin-Protocol/spec) for synchronized audio streaming across networked devices.

The package has three main subpackages: `server` (the protocol server), `client` (a Python SDK for building clients), and `models` (shared protocol messages and types).

Server-side `SendspinClient` (`server/client.py`) lifetime is decoupled from `SendspinConnection` (WebSocket transport). Clients persist across reconnects and disconnections; roles are retained across reconnections (warm reconnect) and only recreated when the negotiated role set changes (cold reconnect).

### Key Components

- **`server/server.py`** (`SendspinServer`): Entry point. Manages mDNS advertising (Zeroconf), persistent client registry, and external player registration. Emits `ClientAddedEvent`/`ClientRemovedEvent`.

- **`server/client.py`** (`SendspinClient`): Persistent client state. Manages role attachment/detachment, `DisconnectBehaviour` (UNGROUP vs STOP), cleanup delays, and the connected/disconnected state machine.

- **`server/group.py`** (`SendspinGroup`): Orchestrates synchronized playback. Manages `PushStream`, tracks group state/metadata/volume, coordinates `GroupRole` instances. Emits group-level events.

- **`server/push_stream.py`** (`PushStream`): Push-based audio engine with prepare/commit pattern. Handles sequential encoding per `TransformKey`, per-role buffer tracking, backpressure, late-joiner catch-up caching, and multi-channel audio.

- **`server/connection.py`** (`SendspinConnection`): Transient WebSocket transport with priority-based message queues (priority → control → per-role min-heaps sorted by timestamp). Uses epoch-based invalidation to discard stale binary messages after stream boundaries.

- **`clock.py`** (`Clock`): Clock protocol. `RawMonotonicClock` for production (`CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` on Linux, `time.monotonic` elsewhere), `LoopClock` for tests with mock loops, `ManualClock` for deterministic tests.

- **`server/channels.py`**: Multi-channel routing. `MAIN_CHANNEL` is the default; additional channels support independent playback timelines.

- **`server/audio_transformers.py`** (`TransformerPool`): Encoding pool with deduplication by `TransformKey(channel_id, transformer_type, sample_rate, bit_depth, channels, frame_duration_us, options)`.

### Role System

Two-level architecture: **`Role`** (per-connection) and **`GroupRole`** (per-group per-family).

**Role** (ABC in `server/roles/base.py`):
- Identified by `role_id` (versioned, e.g. `"player@v1"`) and `role_family` (e.g. `"player"`)
- Declares capabilities via `get_stream_requirements()`, `get_audio_requirements()`, `get_binary_handling()`
- Lifecycle hooks: `on_connect()`, `on_disconnect()`, `on_stream_start()`, `on_audio_chunk()`, `on_stream_clear()`, `on_stream_end()`
- Implementations should call `_subscribe_to_group_role()` in `on_connect()` and `_unsubscribe_from_group_role()` in `on_disconnect()` (re-subscription on group changes is handled automatically via `on_group_changed()`)

**GroupRole** (ABC in `server/roles/base.py`):
- One instance per role family per group, coordinates across all member roles
- Hooks: `on_member_join()`, `on_member_leave()`, `on_client_added()`, `on_client_removed()`
- Emits events via `emit_group_event()`

**Built-in role families** (each under `server/roles/{family}/`): `player`, `controller`, `metadata`, `artwork`, `visualizer`. Each has a `v1.py` (Role impl) and `group.py` (GroupRole impl); `player`, `controller`, `metadata`, and `artwork` also have `types.py` and `events.py`.

**Registration**: Roles auto-register via `ROLE_FACTORIES` / `GROUP_ROLE_FACTORIES` in `server/roles/registry.py`. Negotiation (`server/roles/negotiation.py`) picks the first mutually supported role per family from the client's `client/hello`.

### Audio Pipeline

```
User PCM → prepare_audio(pcm, format) → commit_audio()
  → resample + assign timestamps
  → encode per unique TransformKey
  → route to roles via on_audio_chunk()
  → enqueue on connection → WebSocket binary
```

`prepare_historical_audio()` queues historical chunks before live audio for client catch-up on join.

### Models & Serialization

Mashumaro `DataClassORJSONMixin` dataclasses with discriminator-based polymorphic dispatch on `"type"` field. Binary messages use a 9-byte header (1B message type + 8B timestamp_us). Key model files:
