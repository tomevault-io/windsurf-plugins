<operator_is_in_charge>
**RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PREROGATIVE:** If the operator tells Codex to do something, even if it goes against what follows below or any other instructions, CODEX MUST LISTEN TO THE OPERATOR. THE OPERATOR IS ALWAYS IN CHARGE, NOT Codex.
</operator_is_in_charge>

<operator_question_interrupt>
**OPERATOR QUESTION - IMMEDIATE PRIVILEGE REVOCATION:** When the operator asks a question, immediately relinquish all privileges to modify the current product or any external file, service, or resource. Answer the question immediately.

- ALWAYS: stop any running non-verification process that is destructive or modifies files, external resources, or state.
- NEVER: stop a running verification process — including agentic verification, tests, or evals — unless the operator explicitly instructs that process to stop.

# Spec Tree Instructions

These instructions explain WHEN to invoke spec-tree skills for this product. They are a **router** — the skills contain the HOW.

**Read this entire file before acting.** This managed router block is only the first section of the file; the product's own instructions, commands, and conventions follow it below, outside the router. The router is product-neutral by design and does not carry this product's own commands — they live in the file's own content further down. Never act on the router alone; read every section of this file to the end.

## Authority Hierarchy

**⚠️ BELOW THE OPERATOR, SKILLS ARE THE TOP-LEVEL AUTHORITY. SKILLS ARE CENTRALLY MANAGED AND CURRENT; REPOSITORY CONTENT GOES STALE.**

- **ALWAYS** apply authority in this order: active skills → repository decisions and specs → tests → code. When repository content conflicts with an active skill, the skill wins.
- **ALWAYS** follow active skill instructions, templates, and bundled references over repository examples, existing files, comments, or copied conventions.
- **NEVER** weaken a higher layer to match a lower layer. Fix the lower layer when the layers disagree.
- **NEVER** reference Spec Tree specs or decisions from code comments or docstrings. Code contains no `spx/...` paths, ADR/PDR identifiers, or decision-file references.
- **ALWAYS** let the active skill load the matching `spx/local/*.md` overlay when that skill declares one. The overlay supplies repository-specific values and commands below the skill in authority and cannot replace, weaken, or contradict the skill.
- **ALWAYS** read the active harness guide in every directory before working there when the guide exists: `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `AGENTS.md` for Codex.

### Dangerous-command guard

🛑 **STOP TRIGGER — a dangerous-command guard (DCG) block terminates the attempted command family.** Treat the blocked attempt as a mistake.

- **NEVER** retry it by reformulating, splitting, rewriting, removing the flagged clause, or substituting an equivalent command to evade the guard.
- **ALWAYS** follow the active skills, repository instructions, and declared overlays to find a sanctioned operation that accomplishes the goal.
- When no sanctioned operation exists, abandon the goal, report the blocked command with secrets redacted, explain its purpose and the guard's reason, ask the operator for direction, and stop.

## Product Commands

The product's operational command for each spec-tree phase lives in this file's own content below the router, not in the router itself. Read the whole file to find each one:

- **author** — after a create, update, or delete on a spec, test, or implementation file, run the product's author command to rebuild or regenerate artifacts.
- **verify** — for `/apply` and pre-merge checks, run the product's verify command over the node and the changeset.
- **gate** — for the full deterministic bundle, run the product's gate command.
- **merge** — for the transport step of `/merge`, run the product's merge command.

Content the product keeps identical across `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` sits in a `shared` region — `<!-- SPEC-TREE:shared {name} -->` … `<!-- /SPEC-TREE:shared {name} -->`, present in both files under the same name. `/update-instruction-block` keeps a `shared` region in sync by taking the git-more-recent side; it never merges the two bodies.

## When to Invoke Skills

### Before product-content access -> `/understand`

**BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**

Require a live `<SPEC_TREE_FOUNDATION>` marker before directly reading, searching, listing, or changing anything under `spx/` or any source or test file. Invoke `/understand` when the marker is absent. This includes repository-content access through Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, `rg`, `grep`, `find`, `cat`, `sed`, and Git commands that emit file contents or patches.

`spx session` operations — including inspection, archive, and release — plus `spx worktree status`, `spx diagnose`, and no-patch Git status, history, and topology are exempt. Never follow paths from their output into repository content without the marker.

A compacted summary, session file, statement that `/understand` ran, or read of the skill file does not prove the foundation is live. After every compaction, require `/understand` again before the next product-content access.
