# Agent Instructions
## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.
Run `bd prime` for workflow context (MANDATORY!), or install hooks (`bd hooks install`) for auto-injection.

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

If there's any contradiction: `bd prime` is right. AGENTS.md is not 100% up to date.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session** before sayind "done" or "complete", you MUST complete ALL steps below.
Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.
Push is not allowed until the work is REVIEWED

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
State A:
  1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
  2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
  3. **Run CODE REVIEW & REFINEMENT PROTOCOL** - See `bd prime` for details
-- DO NOT CROSS THE LINE BY TOURSELF --
State B (after SOMEONE ELSE has reviewed it):
  4. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
  5. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
    ```bash
    git pull --rebase
    git add (careful with using -A, the user sometimes leaves untracked crap lying around) && git commit ...
    git push
    git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
    ```
  6. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
  7. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
  8. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- Pushing is not allowed until the work is successfully reviewed
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
- Failure to follow this order creates double commits (one for code, one for .beads/issues.jsonl)
- MODIFY ticket, git STAGE/PUSH - else you will be creating extra commits

## Lessons learned

- Be aware of Go's pass-by semantics especially with closures.
- Don't assume you know what a function does by its name alone. The devil is in the details.
- In Bubble Tea, never mutate application state (like maps or UI models) inside a `tea.Cmd` background goroutine; always return a `tea.Msg` and mutate state safely within the main `Update()` thread.
- Never use defer cancel() on a context passed to Dial if the returned connection will use that context after the function returns - always use a separate dial context with its own timeout.
- teatest strips ANSI color codes, making it fundamentally incapable of testing visual focus states - navigation tests belong in agent_tui_test.go where websocket streaming preserves ANSI codes.
- Delete tests that simulate actions but only verify trivial assertions - vacuous tests like assert.True(t, len(out) > 0) provide false confidence and should be removed entirely.
- WaitFor is for observable state changes, not for timing delays - use time.Sleep for rapid key sequences where intermediate states don't produce detectable output differences.
- When the reviewer says "this is completely untouched," stop and actually look at the exact line they're pointing to
- Adding visible text indicators to UI (like ▶ for focus) is valuable for users even when your testing framework can't leverage them - don't conflate UI improvements with testability.
- A 3.0/10 review score means you fundamentally misunderstood the requirements - don't try to justify partial fixes, just implement exactly what the reviewer specified.
- For harness/process validation, binary matching is alias-based (1 harness can map to multiple executable names, e.g. `kilo` and `kilocode`).
- If the UI isn't updating properly: are the caches being dirtied properly?

## Modern tooling

All kinds of modern replacements for standard shell tools are available: rg, fd, sd, choose, hck
The interface is nicer for humans. You pick whatever feels right for you.

### Vibe MCP

If the `vibe_run` tool is available to you think of it as a not so bright but fast agent. Use it for low effort but content intensive tasks like tracing flow, finding code, etc.
- Run it with agent=auto-approve so it uses all its tools
- max_turns = 5 by default, so give it more if the request has length to it

## File Editing Strategy

- **Use the Right Tool for the Job**: For any non-trivial file modifications, you **must** use the advanced editing tools provided by the MCP server.
  - **Simple Edits**: Use `sed` or `write_file` only for simple, unambiguous, single-line changes or whole-file creation.
  - **Complex Edits**: For multi-line changes, refactoring, or context-aware modifications, use `edit_file` (or equivalent diff-based tool) to minimize regression risks.

## Commit Messages

- **Conventional Commits**: All commit messages **must** adhere to the Conventional Commits specification.
  - **Format**: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
  - **Example**: `feat(harvester): implement reverse-scroll logic for Gemini`
  - **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`
- **Beads extra**: Add a line like "Affected ticket(s): bb-foo", can be multiple with e.g. review tickets
- **WARNING**: Forgetting the ticket reference line is a commit message format violation. Double-check before committing.

## Documentation

- **New Features**: When implementing new features, **must** update documentation:
