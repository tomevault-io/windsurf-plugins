# Claude Development Guide for Elo

This document provides instructions for AI assistants (like Claude) working on the Elo compiler project.

## Project Overview

Elo is a small expression language that compiles to three target languages:
- **Ruby**: Server-side scripting
- **JavaScript**: Client-side execution
- **PostgreSQL SQL**: Database queries

The compiler translates Elo expressions into semantically equivalent code in each target language.

## Design principles

Following the vision, design and implementation choices MUST target a language that stays simple, well-designed,
portable and safe, in that order. We SHOULD always restrict Elo's powerfullness if a wanted feature leads to a
violation of those principles.

**CRITICAL** when adding a language construct or stdlib function, you MUST also document it in README (no details)
and on website (with example).

## Architecture

Elo currently has the following components :

* A parser (`src/parser.ts`)
* AST types and factory (`src/ast.ts`)
* Type system (`src/types.ts`)
* Intermediate Representation with type inference (`src/ir.ts`, `src/transform.ts`)
* Standard library abstraction for type-based dispatch (`src/stdlib.ts`)
* One compiler per target language (`src/compilers/*.ts`)
* A binary command (`bin/eloc` and `src/cli.ts`)
* A try-elo website to demonstrate Elo (`web/`)

### Compilation Pipeline

1. **Parse**: Source → AST (`parser.ts`)
2. **Transform**: AST → Typed IR (`transform.ts`) - infers types and rewrites operators as function calls
3. **Emit**: IR → Target code (`compilers/*.ts`) - uses `StdLib` for type-based dispatch

## Test-Driven Development

Elo is developped in TDD. We have three levels of testing :

* `npm run test:unit` : checks the behavior of core and utility functions
* `npm run test:integration` : checks expected compilation output from sources
* `npm run test:acceptance` : checks expected semantics against `ruby`, `node` and `psql`

**CRITICAL** : the three levels of tests MUST be maintained ; all tests MUST PASS at all times.

The tests are organized as follows :

* `test/unit/**/*.ts` are unit tests without dependencies
* `test/fixtures/*` are elo expression files and their expected compilation in the target languages
* `test/integration/**/*.ts` check the compiler and cli, using fixtures
* `test/acceptance/**/*.ts` check the actual execution of generated code, using fixtures

**CRITICAL** when adding acceptance tests, every line of .elo files MUST have be an assert for
testing to be effective.

### Generating expected fixture files

**CRITICAL**: NEVER generate `.expected.*` files by hand or via `eloc` directly. Always use:

```
./scripts/regenerate-fixtures.sh [fixture-name]   # Regenerate specific fixture
./scripts/regenerate-fixtures.sh                   # Regenerate all fixtures
./scripts/regenerate-fixtures.sh -t js,python sum  # Specific targets only
```

The script builds the compiler, finds `.elo` files recursively under `test/fixtures/`,
and generates matching `.expected.{js,ruby,sql,py}` files with correct flags (`--execute`
for JS, Ruby, and Python). It only regenerates targets for which an expected file already
exists, unless `-t` is used to force specific targets.

## Tasks & agents

The list of tasks can be found in `.claude/tasks/todo` and `.claude/tasks/done`.
Done tasks provide history of my prompts. Todo tasks are the next envisionned
steps.

**CRITICAL**: You can always look the vision ahead in written todo tasks, but we
NEVER implement anything else that the very next step (first todo tasks, by
alphabetic order). Other tasks are informative and may help making future-proof
design decisions. If it leads to unnecessary complexity, we just forget about
them and act as if they were not written at all.

When a tasks involves enhancing the Elo language (typically adding a new construct),
a typical list of things to do is :

- Add the construct in parser and add unit tests for it
- Adapt the intermediary representation IR if needed, add unit tests if needed
- Add acceptance tests (fixtures) that assert expected behavior(s)
- Extend the compilers for the new construct, under acceptance tests
- Document in README then in Learn, Reference, and Stdlib sections of the website.
  Think about the relevant sections to adapt, to avoid end-user documentation bloat.
- Re-run all the tests, since some consistency tests exist that check the documentation.
- Commit and mark the task done.

**IMPORTANT** If you block on something and are in autonomous mode, adapt the
task with your analysis and questions, move it to `analyzed` and move to the
next task.

**CRITICAL** Commit everytime you have something stable. You should end up having
ONE commit per task. Use `commit --amend` if needed. NEVER have two different tasks
commited together.
