<!-- ABOUTME: Defines workflow, deck structure, and session completion steps. -->
# AGENTS.md

- Scope: Applies to this repo only.
- Precedence: Deeper AGENTS.md overrides higher-level files.
- Purpose: Guidance for Codex/Claude CLI agents working on decks and templates.
- Practices: Keep edits minimal and scoped; follow repo style; avoid unrelated changes.
- Validation: This is a content/templates repo; no automated tests required.

## Quickstart

```bash
skills/keynote-slides/scripts/new-deck.sh my-pitch --entity northwind --title "My Pitch"
skills/keynote-slides/scripts/serve-decks.sh
```

Open `http://<tailscale-ip>:8921/decks/my-pitch/index.html`.

## Deck Structure

- `decks/brands.js` stores persistent brand profiles and deck-type preferences.
- `decks/<deck-id>/index.html` is the deck template.
- `decks/<deck-id>/deck-config.js` and `deck.json` store metadata.
- `decks/<deck-id>/resources/assets/` holds logos and visuals (incl. nano-banana inputs).
- `decks/<deck-id>/resources/materials/` holds briefs, pricing, P&L, and notes.

## Private Decks (Local-Only)

- Private decks (Synthyra + personal) live in the local worktree at `../keynote-slides-private`.
- That worktree is on branch `local/decks-private` and must never be pushed.
- Keep `main` free of private decks; only demo/example decks belong on `main`.

## Review Loop

- Use Chrome Devtools MCP tools to capture snapshots/screenshots for review.
- Check hierarchy, spacing rhythm, contrast, and pacing before generating visuals.

## Issue Tracking

This project does not use beads. If this repo adopts `.workgraph/`, use Workgraph and `speedriftd`; otherwise track deck work in repo docs and GitHub.

## Quick Reference

```bash
git status            # Check local repo state
git pull --rebase     # Refresh before landing changes
git push              # Publish deck/template changes
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- This applies to the `main` worktree only; the private worktree must stay local.
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
