description: Keep the redlamp.app landing page (web/) in step with the README whenever work lands
---


# Keep the landing page current

The README is the status page, and `web/` (redlamp.app) presents it. When you update the README for something that landed, check the site in the same change.

## Updates itself (don't duplicate)

- **Roadmap** and **Everything that works today** are parsed from the README at build time by `web/lib/readme.ts`.
- **Screenshots, film icons, sample sheets and logos** are copied from `docs/` by `web/scripts/sync-assets.mjs`.
- **The download button**, the version in the hero's status pill and the Homebrew "(with the first release)" note follow the latest GitHub release (`web/lib/github.ts`).

Keep the shapes the parser relies on, or update `web/lib/readme.ts` with them:
- `## Roadmap` with `### Phase N: Title *(status)*` sections and `- [x]` / `- [ ]` items (`### Later` uses plain `-` items).
- `### What works today` with `**Group title**` lines, each followed by `- [x]` items.

## Edit by hand when the README changes

| README change | Update |
| --- | --- |
| A headline feature lands, or a feature row's claims change | The matching entry in `web/content/features.ts` (title, body, points, screenshot) |
| The command palette's keys or behaviour change | `commandPalette` and `paletteSteps` in `web/content/features.ts`, and its close-ups (`palette-*` in `scripts/capture-screenshots.sh`) |
| Measured performance numbers change | `performance` in `web/content/features.ts`, and the speed feature's points |
| A film stock is added, renamed or re-tuned | `web/content/films.ts` (with its icon and `look-<id>.jpg` in `docs/images/film/`) |
| Goals change | `principles` in `web/content/features.ts` |
| Status changes (alpha, beta, iPad/iPhone) | `status`, `stage` (the status badge) and `homebrew` in `web/lib/site.ts`, and the hero copy in `web/components/sections/Hero.tsx`. A new stage also changes the version suffix in `Version.xcconfig` (`-prealpha`, `-alpha`, `-beta`) |
| A new screenshot is added to `docs/images` | Use it in a feature row or add it to `gallery` in `web/content/features.ts` |

Write site copy in the brand voice from `docs/brand/README.md`: calm, plain and precise, with no exclamation marks or superlatives, and only claims the README makes.

## Check

```bash
cd web && npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

The build fails if the README sections the parser needs are missing.
