# Roadmap: the tracker and GitHub issues

`docs/research/research-tracker.md` is where the roadmap is planned. Every open work item in it has a GitHub issue, mirrored by `scripts/tracker-issues.py`, so the roadmap can be followed, discussed and picked up on GitHub.

## Plan in the tracker

- Add, split, reprioritise and finish work in the tracker first, by its own rules: new IDs in the right section, never reused; `Status` names the commit.
- The sync owns each issue's title, the block between `<!-- tracker:begin -->` and `<!-- tracker:end -->`, its open or closed state, its milestone, and the `tracker`, `area:`, `size:`, `kind:`, `decision:` and `status:` labels. Don't edit those on GitHub: the next sync overwrites them. Everything else is free to use: comments, assignees, text above the block, and labels such as `help wanted` or `good first issue`.
- Each README roadmap phase (`### Phase N: Title *(status)*`) is a milestone of that title, closed once the README marks it *(done)*; an issue goes in its row's earliest phase. Renaming a phase in the README renames its milestone on the next sync.
- Decision rows (`DEC-`) and recorded skips (`SKIP-`) stay in the tracker only.

## Sync after a tracker change

Whenever a change touches the tracker, sync as part of the same work, once it is committed:

```bash
scripts/tracker-issues.py          # dry run: read what it will do
scripts/tracker-issues.py --apply
```

A row that becomes `Done` closes its issue as completed; `Not needed` or `Rejected` closes it as not planned; a row moving back reopens it. When work lands for a tracked item, name its issue in the commit message (`Refine Edge brush (MSK-07, #12)`).

## Issues people file

The sync lists open issues without a tracker ID as untriaged. For each:

- **Bug:** fix it and close it as usual. Bugs don't need a tracker row unless fixing one is a piece of planned work.
- **Feature request or idea:** if it belongs on the roadmap, add a tracker row (Decision `Proposed`, Source linking the issue), then start the issue's title with the new ID (`MSK-18: …`). The next sync adopts it and keeps the reporter's text above the mirrored block. Only the owner moves a row to `Accepted`.
- **Already tracked:** close it as a duplicate of the tracker item's issue.
- **Declined:** close it with the reason; add a `SKIP-` row when the reason is worth keeping.
