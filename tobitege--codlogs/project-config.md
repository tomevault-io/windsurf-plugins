# Agent Notes

## Planning Files

- Keep planning-with-files artifacts out of the repo root.
- Store them under `devlog/YYYY-MM-DD/` using ISO dates such as `devlog/2026-03-14/`.
- Skill reference: `planning-with-files` can be found at <https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files>.
- Each dated folder should contain:
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `progress.md`
- If work continues on the same day, update the existing dated folder instead of creating duplicate root-level planning files.
- Preserve older dated folders as historical records unless the user explicitly asks to prune them.
