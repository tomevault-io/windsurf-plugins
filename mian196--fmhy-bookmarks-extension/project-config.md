# GEMINI.md - Project Development Guidelines & Instructions

This document outlines the coding standards, workflow conventions, architectural principles, and release procedures for the **FMHY Bookmarks Auto-Sync** extension.

---

## 🌿 1. Branching Strategy & Git Workflow

* **Main Branch Direct Workflow**: All development, features, and bug fixes occur directly on the `main` branch. No separate `dev` branch is used.
* **Commit & Push Policy**:
  - **Commit Each Change Locally**: Always create a git commit locally after completing each code edit, feature, refactor, or bug fix.
  - **Never Push Automatically**: **NEVER run `git push` unless explicitly requested by the user.** Keep all commits local until the user asks to push or publish.
* **Release Process**:
  1. Commit code changes, features, and bug fixes directly to `main`.
  2. Document changes under `## [Unreleased]` or the upcoming target version section in `CHANGELOG.md`. **Never append post-release changes to an already tagged version section.**
  3. When sufficient commits accumulate for a new release, bump version numbers in manifests (`platform/*/manifest.json`).
  4. Finalize the new version entry in `CHANGELOG.md` (e.g. `## [v1.5.0] - 2026-07-22`).
  5. Rebuild extension ZIP packages using `python tools/build.py`.
  6. Create an annotated git tag locally (e.g., `git tag -a v1.5.0 -m "Release v1.5.0"`).
  7. Push branch and tag to GitHub **ONLY when explicitly asked by the user**.

## 📝 2. Documentation & Changelog Maintenance

* **Main Extension Codebase Changes Only**: Only document changes, features, refactors, and bug fixes that directly impact the extension's core codebase, functionality, UI, or performance (`src/`, `platform/`).
* **Exclude Internal Chores & Workflows**: **NEVER** include non-codebase chores, README doc fixes, developer guide edits (`GEMINI.md`), or GitHub Actions workflow/CI updates in `CHANGELOG.md`.
* **Immutable Release Entries**: Once a version tag (e.g. `v1.4.0`) is created and released, its `CHANGELOG.md` entry is **immutable**. All subsequent commits must be logged under `## [Unreleased]` or the next version release header (`## [v1.5.0]`).
* **Format**: Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
* Sections should include: `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, and `### Performance` as applicable.

## ⚡ 3. Performance & API Optimization Strategies

### A. Firefox Bookmark Sync Performance (Batching Strategy)
* **Problem**: Firefox stores bookmarks in an underlying SQLite database (`places.sqlite`). Sequential bookmark insertions via `browser.bookmarks.create` can take 45+ seconds for ~25,000 links.
* **Solution**: Use parallel batching (`Promise.all` in chunks of 25 promises) in `src/lib/bookmark_sync.js`. This speeds up Firefox bookmark tree creation by ~20x (reducing sync duration to 1–2 seconds).

### B. GitHub ETag Rate-Limit Protection
* **Problem**: GitHub API limits unauthenticated requests to 60 per hour.
* **Solution**: Store `ETag` headers returned by GitHub API responses in `chrome.storage.local`. On subsequent checks, pass `If-None-Match: <etag>`. When GitHub returns `HTTP 304 Not Modified`, swallow the empty body without updating local storage or hitting rate limits.

---

## 📦 4. Multi-Platform Build Architecture

* **Directory Structure**:
  * `src/`: Shared cross-browser source files (popup, options, background scripts, assets, libs).
  * `platform/chromium/manifest.json`: Chromium Manifest V3 (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera).
  * `platform/firefox/manifest.json`: Firefox Manifest V3 (Gecko engine).
  * `tools/build.py`: Automated Python build script that copies `src/` and platform-specific manifests into `dist/build/` and packages `.chromium.zip` and `.firefox.zip`.
* **No Hardcoded Versioning**: CI/CD workflows and build tools must dynamically parse the version string from `manifest.json`.

---

## 🦊 5. Firefox AMO Store Validation & Compliance

* **Data Collection Declaration**: Include `data_collection_permissions` under `browser_specific_settings.gecko` set to `{"required": ["none"]}` in `platform/firefox/manifest.json`.
* **Fork & ESR Compatibility**: Set `"strict_min_version": "115.0"` in `platform/firefox/manifest.json` to ensure full compatibility with Firefox ESR 115/128 and Firefox engine forks (Waterfox, Zen Browser, Floorp, LibreWolf).

---

## 🖼️ 6. Asset & Resource Locality

* **Bundled Local Assets**: All icons, logos, and UI images must be bundled locally inside `src/assets/`.
* **No Remote Image Fetching**: Do not reference external image URLs (e.g. `raw.githubusercontent.com`) inside extension HTML/CSS/JS files.

---

## 🎯 7. Zero-Modification Upstream Passthrough Policy

* **Scope Boundary**: The sole mandate of this extension is to automate the delivery and synchronization pipeline between the upstream repository (`fmhy/bookmarks`) and the user's browser bookmarks bar.
