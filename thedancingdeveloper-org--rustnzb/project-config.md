# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (and humans who like checklists) working in the
rustnzb repository. This file is the entry point: read it before making
changes, and follow the linked documents for detail.

Agents are welcome contributors here. They are held to the same engineering
and community standards as anyone else — see the AI-assisted contributions
section of [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Project in one paragraph

rustnzb is a Usenet downloader written in Rust: it takes an NZB and runs the
whole pipeline — pipelined NNTP downloads over TLS, SIMD yEnc decoding, PAR2
verification and repair, archive extraction — behind an Axum HTTP API and an
Angular web UI, shipped as a single static binary and a container image. It
also exposes a SABnzbd-compatible API so *arr applications and SAB clients can
drive it.

## Repository map

| Path | What lives there |
|------|------------------|
| `apps/rustnzb/` | The binary crate: startup, config wiring, systemd unit, integration tests |
| `apps/rustnzb/frontend/` | Angular web UI (Node 22, npm) |
| `crates/nzb-core/` | NZB parser, config, SQLite database, shared models |
| `crates/nzb-news/` | Download orchestration primitives, queue/worker coordination |
| `crates/nzb-dispatch/` | Server-aware dispatch engine feeding article work to `nzb-news` |
| `crates/nzb-nntp/` | NNTP protocol, connection pool, rustls TLS, pipelining, failover |
| `crates/nzb-decode/` | yEnc decoder, CRC32 validation, file assembler |
| `crates/nzb-postproc/` | PAR2 verify & repair, RAR/7z/ZIP extraction, cleanup |
| `crates/nzb-web/` | Axum server, REST API, SABnzbd compatibility layer, queue manager |
| `crates/mock-nntp-server/` | Deterministic NNTP fixture used by tests |
| `e2e/` | Playwright browser journeys (`e2e/USER_JOURNEYS.md` describes them) |
| `benchnzb/` | Benchmark harness — excluded from the workspace, not a correctness gate |
| `desktop/` | Tauri desktop shell — excluded from the workspace |
| `ci/` | Checked-in containerized task interface (`./ci/run`) and coverage gates |
| `docs/` | Development, releasing, known issues, performance status |
| `website/` | Project site and browser demo |

Cargo workspace: `resolver = "3"`, Rust 2024 edition, MSRV 1.88.
`default-members = ["apps/rustnzb"]`; `benchnzb` and `desktop` are excluded and
must be built or tested with their own manifests.

The workspace crates are also published to crates.io and patched back to their
local paths via `[patch.crates-io]` in the root `Cargo.toml`. If you change a
crate's public API, bump its version in `Cargo.toml` alongside the change.

---

## Build and test

Run from the repository root. These are the checks a change is expected to
pass before review:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo test --manifest-path benchnzb/Cargo.toml --all-targets --locked
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd apps/rustnzb/frontend
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
npm test -- --watch=false
npm run build -- --configuration=production
```

For exact CI parity in pinned toolchain images (requires Docker):

```bash
./ci/run fmt
./ci/run check
./ci/run test
./ci/run clippy
./ci/run frontend-test
./ci/run e2e
```

Full task list: [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

Scope your loop while iterating — `cargo test -p nzb-decode` is a far better
inner loop than the full workspace — but run the full set before you claim a
change is green.

## Conventions

- **Rust 2024 edition.** Clippy runs with `-D warnings`; the workspace also
  sets `clippy::all = warn` and `rust::unused = warn`. Do not silence a lint
  with `#[allow]` without a comment explaining why.
- **No new dependencies without cause.** Prefer the versions already pinned in
  `[workspace.dependencies]` and add new crates through that table, not
  per-crate.
- **Errors:** `thiserror` for library crates, `anyhow` at the application
  boundary.
- **Async:** Tokio throughout. Avoid blocking calls on the async runtime; use
  `spawn_blocking` for CPU- or filesystem-heavy work.
- **Tests belong with their code.** Unit and integration tests live with their
  crates and under `apps/rustnzb/tests/`; browser journeys live in `e2e/`.
  Use `crates/mock-nntp-server` rather than reaching for a real provider.
- **Determinism.** Tests must not depend on the network, on wall-clock timing,
  or on a live Usenet server.
- **Generated output is never committed.** `target/`, `.ci-output/`,
  `.ci-artifacts/`, `node_modules/`, and frontend build directories stay out of
  commits.

## Compatibility surfaces

Two API surfaces have external consumers and must not be changed casually:

- **`/api/...`** — the native REST API, documented at `/swagger-ui` via utoipa
  annotations. Update the annotations when you change a handler.
- **`/sabnzbd/api` and `/api?mode=...`** — the SABnzbd compatibility layer in
  `crates/nzb-web/src/sabnzbd_compat.rs`. Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr,
  Prowlarr, and mobile clients such as nzb360 depend on response *shape*, not
  just status codes. Treat SABnzbd's documented responses as the contract:
  add fields with SAB-compatible defaults rather than omitting them, and check
