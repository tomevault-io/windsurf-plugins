# Unity / Art-Net project rules

- Make the smallest change that satisfies the request; inspect first and treat investigation requests as read-only.
- Before editing, present the target files, implementation, impact, validation, and (when meaningful) a lower-cost alternative; wait for approval unless the user says to implement directly.
- Keep Unity Inspector, EditorWindow, and log text as Japanese paragraphs followed by one blank line and English paragraphs; do not alternate languages sentence by sentence.
- Preserve existing Unity conventions, APIs, and behavior. Avoid unrelated refactors and project-specific absolute paths or object names in reusable code.
- Search only the necessary scope: start with `Assets/` and custom packages under `Packages/`; exclude `Library/`, `Temp/`, `Logs/`, `obj/`, `Build/`, `Builds/`, and `UserSettings/`. Keep command, diff, and test output concise.
- Do not break `.meta`/GUIDs or Prefab, Scene, Timeline, Animator, and ScriptableObject references. Verify YAML/GUID references when changing serialized assets. Check Git/LFS before adding or changing large binaries.
- Preserve serialized field names, types, defaults, and attributes; use an explicit migration when a change is unavoidable.
- Respect MonoBehaviour lifecycle ordering and symmetric subscription cleanup. Do not add LINQ, allocations, reflection, scene-wide searches, or repeated component lookups to per-frame paths; cache and use event/delta updates where practical.
- Preserve Art-Net/DMX Universe and Address mapping, channel widths, coarse/fine order, 8/16-bit conversion, packet timing, and unreceived-data behavior. Never guess a 0-based/1-based boundary.
- Preserve Pan/Tilt axes, direction, range, clamp, normalization, initial pose, and parent-transform behavior; likewise preserve Invert, Offset, and Smoothing order, units, signs, defaults, and delta-time behavior.
- Use a single agent by default. Use one read-only subagent only when explicitly requested or a focused, independent investigation is genuinely necessary; give it a narrow question and paths, and do not repeat exploration.
- Validate only the changed scope. Report changed files, validation, use/setup notes when relevant, and remaining risks concisely.
