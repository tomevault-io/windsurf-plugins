# Agents

`AGENTS.md` is the repo-level contract for agents working in this repository.

Pi subagent behavior does **not** live here. The source of truth for bundled Pi subagents is `.feynman/agents/*.md`, which the runtime syncs into the Pi agent directory. If you need to change how `researcher`, `reviewer`, `writer`, or `verifier` behave, edit the corresponding file in `.feynman/agents/` instead of duplicating those prompts here.

## Pi subagents

Feynman ships four bundled research subagents:

- `researcher`
- `reviewer`
- `writer`
- `verifier`

They are defined in `.feynman/agents/` and invoked via the Pi `subagent` tool.

## What belongs here

Keep this file focused on cross-agent repo conventions:

- output locations and file naming expectations
- workspace-level continuity expectations for long-running work
- provenance and verification requirements
- handoff rules between the lead agent and subagents

Do **not** restate per-agent prompt text here unless there is a repo-wide constraint that applies to all agents.

## Output conventions

- Research outputs go in `outputs/`.
- Paper-style drafts go in `papers/`.
- Session logs go in `notes/`.
- The workspace-level lab notebook lives at `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Plan artifacts for long-running workflows go in `outputs/.plans/`.
- Intermediate research artifacts are written to disk by subagents and read by the lead agent. They are not returned inline unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Long-running workflows should treat the plan artifact as an externalized working memory, not a static outline. Keep task status and verification state there as the run evolves.
- Long-running or resumable workflows should also treat `CHANGELOG.md` as the chronological lab notebook: what changed, what failed, what was verified, and what should happen next.
- Do not create or update `CHANGELOG.md` for trivial one-shot tasks.

## File naming

Every workflow that produces artifacts must derive a short **slug** from the topic (lowercase, hyphens, no filler words, ≤5 words — e.g. `cloud-sandbox-pricing`). All files in a single run use that slug as a prefix:

- Plan: `outputs/.plans/<slug>.md`
- Intermediate research: `<slug>-research-web.md`, `<slug>-research-papers.md`, etc.
- Draft: `outputs/.drafts/<slug>-draft.md`
- Cited brief: `<slug>-brief.md`
- Verification: `<slug>-verification.md`
- Final output: `outputs/<slug>.md` or `papers/<slug>.md`
- Provenance: `<slug>.provenance.md` (next to the final output)

Never use generic names like `research.md`, `draft.md`, `brief.md`, or `summary.md`. Concurrent runs must not collide.

## Workspace changelog

- `CHANGELOG.md` is a lab notebook, not release notes.
- Read `CHANGELOG.md` before resuming substantial work when it exists.
- Append concise entries after meaningful progress, failed approaches, major verification results, or new blockers.
- Each entry should identify the active slug or objective and end with the next recommended step.
- Mark verification state honestly with labels such as `verified`, `unverified`, `blocked`, or `inferred` only when they match the underlying evidence.

## Provenance and verification

- Every output from `/deepresearch` and `/lit` must include a `.provenance.md` sidecar.
- Provenance sidecars should record source accounting and verification status.
- Source verification and citation cleanup belong in the `verifier` stage, not in ad hoc edits after delivery.
- Verification passes should happen before delivery when the workflow calls for them.
- If a workflow uses the words `verified`, `confirmed`, or `checked`, the underlying artifact should record what was actually checked and how.
- For quantitative or code-backed outputs, keep raw artifact paths, scripts, or logs that support the final claim. Do not rely on polished summaries alone.
- Never smooth over missing checks. Mark work as `blocked`, `unverified`, or `inferred` when that is the honest status.

## Delegation rules

- The lead agent plans, delegates, synthesizes, and delivers.
- Use subagents when the work is meaningfully decomposable; do not spawn them for trivial work.
- Prefer file-based handoffs over dumping large intermediate results back into parent context.
- The lead agent is responsible for reconciling task completion. Subagents may not silently skip assigned tasks; skipped or merged tasks must be recorded in the plan artifact.
- For critical claims, require at least one adversarial verification pass after synthesis. Fix fatal issues before delivery or surface them explicitly.
