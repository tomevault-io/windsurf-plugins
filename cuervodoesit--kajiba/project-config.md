## Required tools

None — Kajiba is a passive collector that hooks into the agent's session lifecycle.

## Configuration

Add to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
kajiba:
  consent_level: full          # anonymous | trajectory_only | metadata_only | full
  auto_submit: false           # Never auto-submit; always preview first
  llm_pii_scrub: true          # Run LLM-based scrubber (uses local model)
  scrub_strictness: high       # low | medium | high
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

## Integration

Kajiba registers hooks into the Hermes Agent session lifecycle via `register_hooks(agent)`. It captures turns, tool calls, and metadata non-intrusively. If Kajiba encounters an error, it logs the issue and never interrupts the host agent session.
