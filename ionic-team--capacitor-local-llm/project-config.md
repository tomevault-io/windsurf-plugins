description: Capacitor Local LLM is a Capacitor plugin that wraps on-device LLM functionality on iOS and Android.
---

## Project Overview
Capacitor Local LLM is a Capacitor plugin that wraps on-device LLM functionality on iOS and Android.
- iOS uses Foundation Models (Apple Intelligence) for text LLM (iOS 26+) and Image Playground for image generation (iOS 18.4+). Foundation Models is a new API — avoid assumptions about its behavior; prefer checking Apple docs.
- Android uses on-device Gemini Nano via the ML Kit packages
- Web is unsupported — plugin methods should throw a "not implemented" error on Web

## Platform Requirements
- iOS: minimum **18.4**. Image generation works on iOS 18.4+. Text LLM (Foundation Models) requires iOS 26+.
- Android: minimum **API 29** (Android 10). Do not lower these — they reflect hard requirements of the underlying native APIs.

## Tech Stack
- This package is a Capacitor plugin, as well as an SPM and CocoaPods package
- Languages: TypeScript, Swift 6, Kotlin
- Framework: Capacitor

## Getting Started
```bash
# Install plugin dependencies
npm install

# Run linters and formatters
npm run lint
npm run fmt

# Build plugin (TypeScript + type definitions)
npm run build

# Verify full build including native projects
npm run verify
```

## Project Structure
```
./
  ios/          - Swift source code for native iOS functionality
  android/      - Kotlin source code for native Android functionality
  src/
    definitions.ts  - Public TypeScript interfaces and types (the plugin API contract)
    web.ts          - Web implementation (unsupported stubs)
    index.ts        - Plugin entry point
  example-app/  - Lightweight Ionic Framework app with simple demos for all plugin features
```

## Plugin Architecture
This plugin follows standard Capacitor conventions:
- Public API is defined in `src/definitions.ts`
- New methods must be added in **all** of the following places or the build will break:
  1. `src/definitions.ts` — TypeScript interface
  2. `src/web.ts` — Web stub (throw `unimplemented()`)
  3. iOS Swift plugin class
  4. Android Kotlin plugin class
- iOS methods that require iOS 26+ must be wrapped in `#available(iOS 26.0, *)` guards and throw `LocalLLMError.unsupported` in the `else` branch. Do not assume a feature is available just because the deployment target allows the code to compile.

## Running the Example App
Note: Android emulators are not supported — Gemini Nano requires a physical Android device. iOS simulators are supported as long as the host Mac supports Apple Intelligence and has it enabled.
```bash
cd example-app
npm install
ionic cap sync
# Then open in Xcode or Android Studio to run on a physical device
```

## Code and Project Conventions
- Prettier, ESLint, and SwiftLint are in use for formatting.
- All TypeScript interfaces, types, and functions intended for public API consumption should be documented using JSDoc comments, including:
  - The version the feature was introduced (`@since`)
  - A one-line usage example
  - Platform availability for platform-exclusive features — note this in prose within the JSDoc description, as Capacitor's docgen does not recognize a `@platform` tag
- New functionality should be added for all platforms unless unavailable due to platform limitations. Platform-exclusive features must be noted in documentation.

## Testing
- There are no automated unit tests — verification is done manually via the example app on physical devices.
- When making changes, test on both iOS and Android physical devices before considering work complete.

## Things to Avoid
- Do not attempt to run or test Android using emulators — Gemini Nano requires physical hardware. iOS simulators work with caveats (see Running the Example App above).
- Avoid adding new dependencies where possible. If a dependency is needed, flag it for review before adding.
- Do not make assumptions about Foundation Models API behavior — it is a new API and documentation may be limited.
- Do not lower the minimum platform versions (iOS 18.4 / Android API 29) — they are set to match the minimum requirements of the underlying native APIs.
