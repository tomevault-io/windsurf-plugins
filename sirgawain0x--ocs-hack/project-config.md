SUBJECT TO CHANGE
The quotas documented on this page are subject to change. Check back regularly for updates.

Per-owner quotas
These quotas apply to each workflow owner (user account) within an organization.
Quota Key	Description	Value
PerOwner.WorkflowExecutionConcurrencyLimit	Maximum number of workflows that can execute simultaneously	5
PerOwner.VaultSecretsLimit	Maximum number of secrets that can be stored per owner	100

When workflow executions exceed the quotas defined above, they are queued and automatically retried for up to 10 minutes. If an execution cannot be completed within this 10-minute window, it will be dropped and will not run.
Per-workflow quotas
These quotas apply to each individual workflow.

PerWorkflow.WASMConfigSizeLimit	Maximum size of the workflow configuration	1 MB
Trigger quotas
Quota Key	Description	Value
PerWorkflow.TriggerSubscriptionLimit	Maximum number of triggers that can be registered to a single workflow	10
