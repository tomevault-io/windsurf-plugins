# BeatOS — Agent Harness

**BeatOS** is a local-first desktop app for beat producers: catalog beats + assets, publish to platforms via browser automation, expose the library to AI agents over MCP. Single-user, no server, no telemetry.

**Stack:** Electron 39 + React 19 + Vite + Tailwind + Radix (renderer) · Python 3.11 + FastAPI + aiosqlite + structlog + `mcp` (FastMCP, mounted on FastAPI sidecar at /mcp) + `mcp-proxy` (stdio bridge) · SQLite · Playwright `_electron` (smoke harness).

**Monorepo:** `apps/desktop/` (Electron shell + React) · `packages/beatos-core/` (pure Python logic) · `packages/beatos-http/` (FastAPI facade) · `packages/beatos-mcp/` (FastMCP tools + stdio bridge launcher) · `packages/beatos-platforms/` (per-platform vocab maps).

> All files except `README.md` are agent instructions — starting context, not infallible. Verify against current code before acting on specifics; flag stale-looking content rather than following it blindly.

## Session start

1. `git fetch && git status` — confirm up to date with remote; pull if behind.
2. `git log --oneline -10` — orient to recent history.
3. Confirm working directory before any write or destructive operation.

## Critical agent rules

1. **Migrations are append-only.** Never edit an applied `migrations/*.sql`; add `00N+1_*.sql`. (Single exception in v0.0.4 — never repeat.)
2. **`beatos-core` has no web / RPC / Electron deps.** If you reach for `fastapi` / `mcp` / Electron-side imports in core, you are in the wrong layer.
3. **MCP / inject is human-in-the-loop.** Two-phase commit (`token` → `confirm_*`) on any write tool. Never programmatically submit a platform upload form.
4. **Zustand v5 stable selectors** — never `.filter` / `.map` / `.find` inside a selector (infinite re-render → black screen). Select the list, derive in `useMemo`.
5. **Always `preventDefault` in `dragover`** — including when `dataTransfer.types.includes("Files")` is false. Otherwise `drop` never fires (lesson re-applied across v0.0.13.2 / v0.0.14).
6. **SPA route reuse** — when a route stays mounted across param changes (`/track/1` → `/track/2` keeps `<TrackEditor>` mounted with new `params`), `useEffect([])` does NOT re-run. Per-track effects must depend on `params.id` (caught at v0.0.14.1: producer distinct went stale across tracks).
7. **Upstream-store → local-form sync** must update both the form state AND the dirty baseline (e.g. `initialTrack`), otherwise the upstream patch (auto-analyze writing bpm/key) registers as a user edit and re-fires auto-save in a loop.
8. **MCP launcher stdout is JSON-RPC only.** The `beatos-mcp` launcher entrypoint (`__main__.py`, `launcher.py`) and the `mcp-proxy` subprocess space must NEVER `print()` or write to stdout — Claude Desktop reads stdout as protocol bytes and a stray newline will silently disconnect. Log via `beatos_mcp.log.configure()` (routes to file + stderr). Tool implementations are NOT subject to this constraint: they run inside the sidecar HTTP process and communicate over HTTP, not stdio.

For per-file context (which columns, which patterns) read [conventions/architecture.md](conventions/architecture.md) §"What NOT to change without reading context first".

## Commands

> Run `npm` / `npx` commands from `apps/desktop/`. Sidecar Python tests run from repo root via `uv run`. IDE TypeScript diagnostics ("Cannot find module …") are frequently stale after file changes — trust `npm run build`, not the editor.

```bash
# from apps/desktop/
npm run dev:fresh              # kill orphan uvicorn + start dev (Vite + sidecar)
npm run build                  # typecheck + electron-vite build
npm run smoke                  # built-app smoke harness (run build first)
npm run logs:tail              # tail Electron main.log + sidecar.jsonl
npx vitest run                 # renderer + main tests
npx vitest run path/to/x.test.ts   # single file
node scripts/diagnose-playback.mjs --tiny  # audio playback diagnostic

# Debounced / async effects in vitest require:
#   vi.useFakeTimers({ shouldAdvanceTime: true })
#   userEvent.setup({ advanceTimers: vi.advanceTimersByTime })
#   await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(ms)
# Canonical example: src/renderer/src/__tests__/TrackEditor.test.tsx

# from repo root
uv run pytest                  # sidecar tests
uv run pytest packages/beatos-http/tests/test_x.py::test_y   # single test
```

Logs (dev): `apps/desktop/logs/main.log` (Electron + `[sidecar]`-tagged stderr) · `apps/desktop/logs/sidecar.jsonl` (structured, one JSON per line, includes `request_id`).

## Doc sync (pre-commit)

Before any non-trivial `git commit`, invoke the [harness](.claude/skills/harness/SKILL.md) skill proactively. It reads the working tree, then for each of `CHANGELOG.md`, `conventions/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` decides whether a small targeted edit is needed. The user may also invoke it explicitly ("harness", "doc check", "check before commit", or equivalent). Skip for typo / comment / formatting / test-only diffs and for diffs that only touch `.claude/` or `memory/`. No enforcement hook, no version bump, no tag pipeline. "All unchanged" is a valid outcome.
