# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

A Claude Code plugin that speaks responses aloud using Kokoro TTS (local neural text-to-speech). No cloud APIs — everything runs on the user's machine.

## Testing

```bash
bash tests/run-all.sh          # all tests
bash tests/test-command-extraction.sh  # single test
```

Tests are plain bash scripts using an `assert_eq` pattern. Each test file is self-contained. New test files matching `tests/test-*.sh` are automatically picked up by `run-all.sh`.

## Architecture

```
Hook fires → speak.sh → FIFO pipe → speak-daemon.sh → speak-daemon.py → audio
```

- **Plugin hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`) register for `Stop`, `PostToolUse`, and `Notification` events
- Hook scripts extract text and the session's `cwd`, then pipe text to `speak.sh` with `NARRATOR_CWD` set
- `speak.sh` is the central enqueuer: resolves local→global state, starts daemon if needed, writes JSON to FIFO
- `speak-daemon.py` is a persistent Python process that keeps the Kokoro pipeline loaded in memory (~10s cold start, then <50ms per utterance), parsing per-utterance voice/speed from JSON messages
- `kokoro-speak.py` is a standalone fallback for one-off speech

### State and runtime files

Global state under `~/.claude-code-narrator/`:
- `config` — enabled/disabled, voice, speed (file-based because hooks are subprocesses)
- `fifo` — named pipe for speech queue (JSON lines with text/voice/speed)
- `daemon.pid` — written by Python daemon AFTER pipeline is loaded (signals readiness)
- `daemon.lock` — atomic mkdir lock to prevent concurrent daemon starts
- `last-spoken` — deduplication tracker for transcript-parsed text blocks

Per-directory local state (optional):
- `<cwd>/.claude-code-narrator/config` — local overrides for enabled/voice/speed (missing keys fall back to global)
- Created by `/narrator:on --local`, `/narrator:cast --local`, `/narrator:speed --local`, etc.

### Plugin structure

- `commands/` — slash command definitions (`/narrator:on`, `/narrator:off`, `/narrator:cast`, `/narrator:speed`, `/narrator:speak`, `/narrator:hush`) with step-by-step instructions for Claude to execute
- `skills/` — SKILL.md files that match user intent phrases (e.g. "change voice", "be quiet", "talk faster") and map to the same operations as commands
- `hooks/hooks.json` — declares which Claude Code events trigger which scripts
- `hooks/scripts/` — all executable scripts (bash + python)

### Hook scripts and what they handle

| Script | Hook event | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `speak-response.sh` | Stop | Speaks first ~1000 chars of final response |
| `speak-step.sh` | PostToolUse | Speaks tool description + intermediate text blocks |
| `speak-notification.sh` | Notification | Speaks notification title/message |
| `hush-on-input.sh` | UserPromptSubmit (user settings) | Silences speech when user types |

### Text-to-speech pipeline

`speak.sh` applies TTS-friendly replacements before enqueuing: dot expansion for filenames, arrow/operator symbols to words, markdown noise removal, abbreviation expansion, and pronunciation fixes for uppercase/mixed-case words Kokoro mangles (README, JSON, API, etc.). These replacements live in `speak.sh` around line 52-130. State resolution (local→global) and JSON FIFO output are at the end of the script.

`speak-step.sh` uses `extract-command.sh` (sourced function) to convert tool commands into short spoken descriptions (e.g. `git log --oneline -3` → "Running git log."). Descriptions end with a trailing period to prevent Kokoro from clipping the last word.

`speak-step.sh` also parses the Claude Code transcript JSONL (`$TRANSCRIPT_PATH`) to find and speak intermediate text blocks between tool calls that have no dedicated hook.

## Key Patterns

- **Never use `sed` to edit config files** — commands/skills instruct Claude to use Read + Edit tools instead
- **`--force` flag** on `speak.sh` bypasses the enabled check (used by `/narrator:speak` for on-demand speech)
- **`--local` flag** on commands creates per-directory config at `<cwd>/.claude-code-narrator/config`
- **`NARRATOR_CWD`** env var is set by caller scripts from hook JSON's `cwd` field; `speak.sh` uses it to find local state
- **FIFO protocol** is JSON lines (`{"text":"...","voice":"...","speed":1.1}`); plain text is backward-compatible fallback
- **`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`** is set by Claude Code at runtime and points to the plugin cache, not this repo
- **Venv** for Kokoro lives at `~/.claude-narrator-venv` (separate from this repo)
- **Python 3.13 compatibility** requires installing kokoro/misaki from git with `--no-deps` and manually installing spacy deps with cp313 wheels (see `kokoro-speak.py` bootstrap)

## Development Workflow

Changes to hook scripts must be copied to the plugin cache (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-code-narrator/narrator/<version>/`) for testing, since hooks run from the cache path, not the source repo. `/reload-plugins` does not refresh the cache unless the version changes.

The `UserPromptSubmit` hook for auto-hush is registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` (not in `hooks/hooks.json`) because it needs to persist across sessions and is managed by the `/narrator:on` and `/narrator:off` commands.
