# WeKit — Agent Guide

## Superpowers

- All Superpowers workflow artifacts for WeKit (plans, specs/designs, SDD ledgers and
  reports, brainstorm sessions) are written, edited, and committed **only** in
  `~/coding/wekit_dev/superpowers` (its own git repo; read its `AGENTS.md` for layout and
  rules). Never create, edit, or commit `.superpowers/` or `docs/superpowers/` inside this
  repo — those paths are gitignored here by design.

## Build

```bash
./x build           # debug (uses same signing as release)
./x build --release # release (with optimization on)
./x zygisk build    # standard universal APK + arm64/arm32 Zygisk module ZIP
# (./x is alias to `cargo xtask` which orchestrates the build process)
```

- **When working in a Git worktree, initialize submodules before starting any work:**
  `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Worktrees do not automatically populate submodule
  contents, and builds will fail when `libs/common/bsh` and `libs/common/reflekt` are empty.
- **When working in a Git worktree, work directly on `dev` unless the user explicitly requests
  another branch or isolated history.** This is because commits made on a detached worktree are not automatically
  transferred by Codex's “local checkout” action and can appear to be lost.
- JDK 21
- **Gradle does NOT build the Rust native lib.** `./gradlew assemble*` only packages whatever
  prebuilt `libwekit_native.so` already sits in `app/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/`. Compiling
  `app/src/main/rust/wekit-native` and refreshing those `.so` files is xtask's job
  (`task_build_native`), so **always go through `./x`** — running Gradle directly will silently ship
  a stale native lib. Requires a Rust toolchain + the Android NDK and its Rust targets;
  `./x configure` regenerates `wekit-native/.cargo/config.toml` from the local NDK and is invoked
  automatically by the build tasks.
- `./x build --native-only` rebuilds just the native lib into `jniLibs/`
- AGP 9, Gradle version catalog in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`

## Project Structure

- `app/` — main Android module, entrypoints, hooks, UI, native Rust lib
- `libs/common/annotation-scanner/` — KSP annotation processor (`@Feature` scanner)
- `libs/common/libxposed-api/` — compileOnly LibXposed API interface stubs (compileOnly since they are provided by user's Xposed framework)
- `libs/common/bsh/` — submodule: forked BeanShell interpreter with snapshot serialization (`BshSnapshot`, `BshSnapshotHelper`); snapshots are encrypted AST byte representations used by the WAuxiliary Xposed module; `app/src/main/java/dev/ujhhgtg/wekit/utils/BshSnapshotDecompiler.kt` — decompiles encrypted BeanShell snapshot files back into Java-like source code; the AES key was recovered from WAuxiliary's decompiled source
- `libs/common/reflekt/` — submodule: reflection utility library (`dev.ujhhgtg.reflekt`)
- `libs/common/stubs/` — compileOnly stubs for WeChat and Android hidden classes
- `buildSrc/` — custom Gradle tasks: `GenerateMethodHashesTask` (`IResolveDex` `resolveDex` method MD5 cache), `GenerateNewFeaturesTask` (features whose source file was added within 30 days of the HEAD commit → `NewFeatures.ADDED_AT_BY_NAME`, backing the 新功能 pseudo-category)
- `xtask/` — build orchestration behind `./x`: native-lib compilation + NDK linker config, APK
  assembly via Gradle, and Zygisk module packaging/flashing

## Entry Points & Architecture

- Xposed entry: `dev.ujhhgtg.wekit.loader.entry.lsp10x.Lsp10xUnifiedHookEntry` (libxposed 101 & 100) and legacy Xposed API (51+) entry: `dev.ujhhgtg.wekit.loader.entry.xp51.Xp51HookEntry`
- Unified flow: `UnifiedEntryPoint.entry()` → `StartupAgent.startup()` → `WeLauncher.init()`
- Hook items annotated with `@Feature(path, description)`, auto-discovered by KSP annotation scanner at compile time
- Base classes: `SwitchFeature` (toggle on/off), `ClickableFeature` (toggle on/off with onClick event), `ApiFeature` (always-on), `BaseFeature` (abstract base, do not use directly)
- DEX analysis via DexKit with `IResolveDex` interface; method resolve body MD5-hashed for cache (
  `GenerateMethodHashesTask`)
- DEX-resolved targets DSL: `val methodTarget by dexMethod()` `val classTarget by dexClass()` delegate → `methodTarget.hookBefore { ... }`, `val method: Method = methodTarget.method`, `val clazz = classTarget.clazz`
- UI: Jetpack Compose + Material 3, dialogs written using `showComposeDialog` and
  `AlertDialogContent`; settings screens follow the Material 3 UI Standards section below
  (`ui/content/m3/` widget family, InstallerX-Revived design)
- Config: MMKV via `WePrefs`
- Logging: via `WeLogger`

## Desktop DexKit Validation

- Use `./x dex-test` to run the same `IResolveDex`/DexKit resolution steps used by
  `DexCacheManager.kt` against WeChat APKs on the Linux desktop. Test only the supported host
  range **8.0.65–8.0.77**; APKs outside that range are useful for investigation but must not be
  treated as compatibility gates for the project.
- Test each supported APK version separately, including separate normal and Google Play APKs
  when both are available. Each APK runs in its own JVM worker and must carry its own version code,
  version name, build tag, and Google Play metadata.
