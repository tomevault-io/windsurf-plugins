# AI Researcher Project - Cursor Rules

You are working on an AI-powered research assistant built with LangGraph and React. This project consists of a Python backend using LangGraph for AI agent orchestration and a React frontend for the chat interface.

## Project Architecture Understanding

### Backend (`/backend`)

- **Tech Stack**: Python 3.12+, LangGraph, LangChain, FastAPI, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Main Files**:
  - `app/agent/graph.py` - Core LangGraph agent implementation
  - `langgraph.json` - Agent configuration
  - `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies managed with `uv`
- **Dev Server**: `uv run langgraph dev` (runs on http://localhost:2024)
- **Agent ID**: `agent` (used in frontend configuration)

### Frontend (`/web`)

- **Tech Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Key Components**:
  - Thread management for conversations
  - Real-time message streaming
  - Agent inbox with interrupts handling
  - Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
- **Dev Server**: `pnpm dev` (runs on http://localhost:5173)

## Development Workflow Rules

1. **Environment Setup Priority**:

   - Always ensure `.env` file exists in backend with `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Use `uv` for Python dependency management in backend
   - Use `pnpm` for Node.js dependencies in frontend

2. **Development Server Management**:

   - Start backend first: `cd backend && uv run langgraph dev`
   - Then start frontend: `cd web && pnpm dev`
   - Frontend connects to backend at http://localhost:2024 with agent ID "agent"

3. **Code Organization Patterns**:

   - Backend: Follow LangGraph patterns with State management and graph nodes
   - Frontend: Use React components in `/components` with proper TypeScript types
   - Shared types for agent communication in `/types.ts` files

4. **Agent Development Best Practices**:

   - Modify `backend/app/agent/graph.py` for agent logic changes
   - Use proper LangGraph state management with `TypedDict` and `add_messages`
   - Test agent changes with `uv run python -c "from app.agent.graph import graph; print('Graph loaded')"`

5. **Frontend Integration**:

   - Agent interrupts are handled in `/components/thread/agent-inbox/`
   - Message types: human, ai, tool-calls, generic-interrupt
   - Stream management in `/providers/Stream.tsx`

6. **File Modification Guidelines**:

   - For agent logic: Edit `backend/app/agent/graph.py`
   - For UI components: Use existing component structure in `/web/src/components/`
   - For styling: Use Tailwind CSS classes and shadcn/ui components
   - For API integration: Modify providers in `/web/src/providers/`

7. **Debugging Approach**:

   - Backend issues: Check LangGraph dev server logs and test graph compilation
   - Frontend issues: Use React dev tools and check console for streaming errors
   - Connection issues: Verify backend is running on port 2024 and frontend config

8. **Feature Development**:

   - New agent capabilities: Add nodes/edges to the graph in `graph.py`
   - New UI features: Create components following the existing pattern
   - New tools for agent: Integrate as LangChain tools in the graph definition

9. **Documentation**:
   When a user requests a feature:

   1. **Create a plan file** in `.cursor/plans/` folder using lowercase snake_case naming
   2. **Document the feature requirements** and implementation approach
   3. **Track progress** as you work on the feature
   4. **After completion**:
      - Add any major architectural changes to `.cursor/docs/architecture.md`
      - Delete the completed plan file

## Common Tasks

- **Adding new agent tools**: Import and add to the graph in `graph.py`
- **UI component changes**: Follow shadcn/ui patterns in `/web/src/components/ui/`
- **Conversation handling**: Modify thread components in `/components/thread/`
- **Styling updates**: Use Tailwind classes and CSS modules where needed

Always consider the full-stack nature of changes and test both backend agent functionality and frontend user experience.
