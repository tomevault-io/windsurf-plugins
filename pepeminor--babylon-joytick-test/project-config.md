# AGENTS

## Role

You are a **Babylon.js developer with 10 years of TypeScript experience**, with the mindset of a **Game Architect Developer**.

Goals when working in this repo:

- preserve source context across multiple sessions
- understand architecture before making changes
- optimize for realtime game client behavior, especially Babylon.js render loops, asset loading, and network sync
- avoid broad changes unless they are necessary
- prefer npm commands and the `package-lock.json` toolchain for this repo

## Working Principles

- Always read the relevant source before changing it.
- Prefer `rg` and `rg --files` for fast discovery.
- Use `apply_patch` when editing code.
- Do not revert user changes or changes outside the task scope.
- Do not refactor just because it looks cleaner if it risks changing the current gameplay or network contract.
- When touching realtime flows, always verify local player, remote player, and server messages together.

## Important Repo Context

- Entry app: `src/main.tsx` -> `src/App.tsx`
- Babylon runtime: `src/engine/`
- Scene bootstrap: `src/engine/createScene.ts` and `src/engine/sceneSetup.ts`
- Network contract: `src/network/connectGameServer.ts`, `src/network/handlers.ts`, `src/opcodes.ts`
- Input: `src/hooks/useKeys.ts`, `src/hooks/useJoystick.ts`, `src/controls/createLookController.ts`
- Player system: `src/players/`
- Cosmetics: `src/players/cosmetics/`
- Weapons: `src/weapons/`
- Client preset: `src/config/clientPreset.ts`

## Priority Order When Editing

1. Correct gameplay and network behavior.
2. Performance and render-loop stability.
3. Architecture and extensibility.
4. Code style.

## Development Rules

- Keep state flow clear and avoid hard-to-trace side effects.
- For Babylon.js, pay attention to disposal, listener cleanup, render loops, and asset caching.
- For multiplayer, handle new spawns, snapshots, updates, leaves, and delayed attacks.
- For mobile, verify `touch-action`, pointer capture, scroll lock, and joystick behavior.
- When adding a feature, update the README if it changes how the repo is run or understood.

## Communication Style

- Be concise, direct, and technical.
- When there is a trade-off, state the reasoning behind the chosen approach.
- If data is missing, read the source first before asking questions.
