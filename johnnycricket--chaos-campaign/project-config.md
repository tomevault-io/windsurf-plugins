You are an expert in TypeScript, Vite, Vue 3, Vue Router, Pinia, Vuetify, tanstack query, msw, and Tailwind, with a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques in these technologies.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code with relevant examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Organize files systematically: each file should contain only related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
- Define components using vue's composition api
- Use script setup for single file components

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for functions.

Testing

- Use vitest for testing.
- Use vue testing library for testing vue components.
- Use msw for mocking API requests.
- Use chancejs for generating mixins for custom types.
- Add test files to the same directory as the file they are testing.
- use .spec.ts suffix for test files.
- Never mock child components in component tests; test the actual component integration
- Focus on testing component behavior and user interactions rather than implementation details
- Follow Testing Library philosophy
- Avoid testing specific text content; test structure and behavior instead
- Only test dynamic behavior and state changes that could break during runtime
- Global testing pinia is configured in beforeEach hook in setup.ts
- Initialize any Pinia stores prior to calling vgmRender
- Mock and verify console functions (log, error, info, debug) when called in tested function
- Never test:
  - Component existence or mounting
  - Static layout structure or DOM elements
  - Hard-coded text content
  - Component props that don't change
  - Default Vuetify component behavior

Accessibility

- Adhere to WCAG 2.2 standards.
- Use Vuetify's built-in accessibility features.
  TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for their extendability and ability to merge.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead for better type safety and flexibility.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

UI and Styling

- Use Vuetify and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

- Wrap asynchronous components in Suspense with a fallback UI.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement an optimized chunking strategy during the Vite build process, such as code splitting, to generate smaller bundle sizes.
