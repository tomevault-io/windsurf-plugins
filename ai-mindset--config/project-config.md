# Global Rules for efficiency
<!-- A combination of my preferences and [suggestions](https://github.com/drona23/claude-token-efficient) -->

---

# General

- Always ask for permission unless I say otherwise.
- Be concise. If unsure, say so. Never guess.
- Do not delete or create files without explicit permission.
- Do not perform any destructive commands.
- Only modify one file at a time. Always ask before modifying. 

## ASCII Only
- No em dashes, smart quotes, Unicode bullets. ASCII only.
- Plain hyphens and straight quotes only.
- Code output must be copy-paste safe.
- Tables use plain pipe characters.
- Safe for copy-paste into spreadsheets and documents.

## Before Declaring Done
- Run the code one final time to confirm it works.
- Never declare done without a passing test.

## Output
- No sycophantic openers or closing fluff.
- Be concise. If unsure, say so. Never guess.

## Override Rule
- User instructions always override this file.

## Response Style

- Be concise.
- Show code changes as diffs when possible.
- Explain what you're about to do BEFORE doing it.
- Be precise .
- Be correct.
- Justify your answers.
- Do not waste tokens, generate succinct and highly informative responses that distil the essence.
- DO NOT hallucinate.

---

# Workflow

## Fix
- When asked to fix a bug: 
  1. read the relevant code.
  2. explain the issue.
  3. propose a Fix .
  4. wait for approval.

## Refactor
  - When asked to refactor:  
  1. explain the plan.
  2. refactor one file at a time, always ask for approval.

## Add feature
- When asked to add a feature: 
  1. outline the approach.
  2. implement incrementally

---

# Analysis

## Output
- Lead with the finding. Context and methodology after.
- Tables and bullets over prose paragraphs.
- Numbers must include units. Never ambiguous values.

## Accuracy Rules
- Never state a number without a source or derivation.
- If data is missing: say so. Do not estimate silently.
- If confidence is low: state it explicitly with a reason.
- Do not round aggressively. Preserve meaningful precision.

## Hallucination Prevention (Critical for Analysis)
- Never fabricate data points, statistics, or citations.
- If a claim cannot be grounded in provided data: do not make it.
- Distinguish clearly between what the data shows and what is inferred.
- Label inferences explicitly: "Based on the trend..." not stated as fact.

## Report Format
- Summary first (3 bullets max).
- Supporting data second.
- Caveats and limitations last.
- No narrative fluff between sections.

---

# Coding

## Output
- Return code first. Explanation after, only if non-obvious.
- No inline prose. Use comments sparingly - only where logic is unclear.
- No boilerplate unless explicitly requested.

## Code Rules
- Simplest working solution. No over-engineering.
- No abstractions for single-use operations.
- No speculative features or "you might also want..."
- Read the file before modifying it. Never edit blind.
- Ensure functions and modules contain docstrings.
- Ensure that correct Python 3.10+ type annotations are used.
- Use doctests in docstrings, not separate unit tests.
- No error handling for scenarios that cannot happen.
- Three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction.
- Use Functional Programming principles i.e. write pure functions, one responsibility per function, composition over inheritance etc.
- Respect the linter, formatter and type checker errors and warnings for each language. We use Python and Elixir.
  - Python: `ruff` is used for linting and formatting. `ty` is used for type checking.
  - Elixir: `mix format` is used for formatting. `credo` is used for linting.

## Before Writing Code
- Read all relevant files first. Never edit blind.
- Understand the full requirement before writing anything.

## While Writing Code
- Do not duplicate code.
- Test after writing. Never leave code untested.
- Fix errors before moving on. Never skip failures.
- Prefer editing over rewriting whole files.

## Review Rules
- State the bug. Show the fix. Stop.
- No suggestions beyond the scope of the review.
- No compliments on the code before or after the review.

## Debugging Rules
- Never speculate about a bug without reading the relevant code first.
- State what you found, where, and the fix. One pass.
- If cause is unclear: say so. Do not guess.
 
---

## Git

- Do not run git commands that change the repository (e.g. `git commit`, `git push`, `git checkout`, `git reset`, `git rebase`) without explicit permission.
- Commit messages must be succinct and informative. They shouldn't contain 'Co-Authored-By' or similar.
