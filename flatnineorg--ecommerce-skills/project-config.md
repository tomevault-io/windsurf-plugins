## Agent Skills Specification

### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---

description: What this skill does and when to use it. Include trigger phrases.
---
```

### Frontmatter Field Constraints

| Field         | Required | Constraints                                                      |
|---------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | Yes      | 1-64 chars, lowercase `a-z`, numbers, hyphens. Must match dir.   |
| `version`     | Yes      | Semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0)                                |
| `description` | Yes      | 1-1024 chars. Describe what it does and when to use it.          |
| `license`     | No       | License name (default: MIT)                                      |
| `metadata`    | No       | Key-value pairs (author, version, etc.)                          |

### Name Field Rules

- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Cannot start or end with hyphen
- No consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Must match parent directory name exactly

**Valid**: `store-research`, `ad-spy`, `pricing-intel`
**Invalid**: `Store-Research`, `-store`, `store--research`

### Skill Directory Structure

```
skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md        # Required - main instructions (<500 lines)
├── references/     # Optional - detailed docs loaded on demand
├── scripts/        # Optional - executable code
└── assets/         # Optional - templates, data files
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Structure

- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines (move details to `references/`)
- Use H2 (`##`) for main sections, H3 (`###`) for subsections
- Use bullet points and numbered lists liberally
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)

### Tone

- Direct and instructional
- Second person ("You are an e-commerce analyst")
- Professional but approachable

### Formatting

- Bold (`**text**`) for key terms
- Code blocks for examples and templates
- Tables for reference data

### Description Field Best Practices

The `description` is critical for skill discovery. Include:
1. What the skill does
2. When to use it (trigger phrases)
3. Related skills for scope boundaries

```yaml
description: Full competitive breakdown of an e-commerce store. Use when the user says "research this store," "tell me about this store," or provides a store URL. For keyword-based research, see product-research or niche-analysis.
```
