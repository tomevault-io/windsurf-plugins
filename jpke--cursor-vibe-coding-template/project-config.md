description: Continuously monitor and improve Cursor rules based on emerging code patterns
---


## Rule Improvement Triggers
- **New code patterns** not covered by existing rules
- **Repeated implementations** across 3+ files
- **Common error patterns** that could be prevented
- **New libraries/tools** being used consistently
- **Emerging best practices** in the codebase

## When to Update Rules

### Add New Rules When:
- A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
- Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
- Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
- New security or performance patterns emerge

### Modify Existing Rules When:
- Better examples exist in the codebase
- Additional edge cases are discovered
- Related rules have been updated
- Implementation details have changed

## Rule Quality Assurance
- Rules should be **actionable and specific**
- Examples should come from **actual code**
- References should be **up to date**
- Patterns should be **consistently enforced**
- Cross-reference related rules

## Continuous Improvement Process
- **Monitor** code review comments
- **Track** common development questions
- **Update** rules after major refactors
- **Add** links to relevant documentation
- **Maintain** links between related rules

## Rule Deprecation
- **Mark** outdated patterns as deprecated
- **Remove** rules that no longer apply
- **Update** references to deprecated rules
- **Document** migration paths for old patterns

## Documentation Maintenance
- Keep examples synchronized with code
- Update references to external docs
- Maintain links between related rules
- Document breaking changes
