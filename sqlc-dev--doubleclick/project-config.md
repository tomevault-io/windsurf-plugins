# Claude Development Guide

## Next Steps

To find the next explain test to work on (fewest pending statements first), run:

```bash
go run ./cmd/next-test
```

This finds tests with `explain_todo` entries in their metadata.

## Running Tests

Always run parser tests with a 30 second timeout:

```bash
go test ./parser/... -timeout 30s
```

The tests are fast but some test files have many statements. If a test is timing out, it may indicate a bug (likely an infinite loop in the parser).

## Checking for Newly Passing Explain Tests

**IMPORTANT:** After implementing parser/explain changes, ALWAYS run check-explain to update metadata files:

```bash
go test ./parser/... -check-explain -v 2>&1 | grep "EXPLAIN PASSES NOW"
```

This command:
1. Runs all explain tests including those in `explain_todo`
2. Automatically updates `metadata.json` files to remove passing statements from `explain_todo`
3. Reports which tests now pass

**You must run this after every change to parser or explain code**, then commit the updated metadata.json files along with your code changes.

## Test Structure

Each test in `parser/testdata/` contains:

- `metadata.json` - `{}` for enabled tests
- `query.sql` - ClickHouse SQL to parse
- `explain.txt` - Expected EXPLAIN AST output (matches ClickHouse's format)
- `explain_N.txt` - Expected EXPLAIN AST output for Nth statement (N >= 2)

### Metadata Options

- `explain_todo: {"stmt2": true}` - Skip specific statement subtests
- `skip: true` - Skip test entirely (e.g., causes infinite loop)
- `explain: false` - Skip test (e.g., ClickHouse couldn't parse it)
- `parse_error: true` - Query is intentionally invalid SQL

## Important Rules

**NEVER modify `explain.txt` files** - These are golden files containing the expected output from ClickHouse. If tests fail due to output mismatches, fix the Go code to match the expected output, not the other way around.
