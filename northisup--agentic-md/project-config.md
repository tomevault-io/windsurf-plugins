- TDD: write failing test first, then implement
- Unit tests are inline (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`) in each module
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/` exercise the full `run()` function
- Use `tempfile::tempdir()` for filesystem tests — never write to the real project dir in tests
- Test both the happy path and edge cases (empty input, missing files, conflicts)
