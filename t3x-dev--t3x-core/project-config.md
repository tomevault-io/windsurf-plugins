# AGENTS.md

This file is the general guide for AI coding agents working in this repository.
`CLAUDE.md` may contain Claude-specific or deeper architecture notes, but this
file is the short cross-agent source for day-to-day development behavior.

## Project Frame

T3X is version control for structured state.

The core loop is:

```text
Source -> YOps -> Commit
```

Source evidence comes from chats, docs, specs, prompt runs, and other
structured inputs. YOps applies deterministic YAML operations to
schema-backed state. Commits version the result with parents, operation logs,
diffs, merges, and provenance.

Do not reintroduce the old graph, meaning, knowledge, or AI-first positioning
unless the README changes first.

## Repository Shape

This is a pnpm workspace with Turborepo:

- `packages/yops` — deterministic YAML operation engine.
- `packages/yschema` — WIP validation candidate with auto-fix.
- `packages/core` — engine layer for commits, diffs, merges, extraction, ylint.
- `packages/storage` — PostgreSQL persistence.
- `packages/api` — Hono route library.
- `packages/api-client` — TypeScript API client.
- `apps/local` — restricted alpha local entry package.
- `apps/web` — WebUI preview.
- `apps/api` — runnable API server.
- `apps/cli` — CLI preview.
- `apps/mcp` — MCP preview.
- `apps/runner` and `apps/agent-demo` — evaluation/demo surfaces.

Root docs are intentionally minimal. Public policy and operational docs live in
`docs/`; release automation data lives in `release/`.

## Release Surface

The restricted alpha npm release surface is intentionally narrow:

- `@t3x-dev/local`
- `@t3x-dev/yops`

`RELEASE.md` and `release/surface.yaml` are the source of truth. Other packages
are internal, preview, or candidate surfaces until promoted.

Keep package access and docs aligned with restricted alpha status. Do not change
release surface, publish access, or stability wording without updating the
release docs and checks.

## Development Commands

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm check
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

Useful targeted commands:

```bash
pnpm build:yops
pnpm build:core
pnpm build:api
pnpm build:webui
pnpm test:yops
pnpm test:core
pnpm test:webui
pnpm check:release-surface
pnpm standards:validate
```

Source development:

```bash
pnpm dev:api
pnpm dev:webui
```

Self-hosted evaluation:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

Docker is an evaluation path, not a production-readiness promise.

## Editing Rules

- Prefer existing patterns over new abstractions.
- Keep edits scoped to the request.
- Use `rg` for search.
- Use structured parsers or existing tooling for structured data.
- Do not move release, standards, or workflow files without updating tests and
  CODEOWNERS.
- Do not revert user changes.
- Keep generated or local working material out of git unless the task explicitly
  asks for it.

## Verification

Match verification to the change:

- Docs only: `git diff --check` and `pnpm check`.
- Release surface or policy paths: add `pnpm check:release-surface`,
  `pnpm standards:validate`, and relevant `node --test tools/__tests__/*.mjs`.
- Package/runtime changes: run the package-specific build/test plus `pnpm build`
  when practical.
- WebUI changes: run the relevant WebUI test/build and inspect in a browser when
  layout or interaction changes.

The pre-push hook runs `pnpm check` and `pnpm build`. It runs tests only when
`T3X_RUN_TESTS=1` is set.

## Important Boundaries

- YOps Apply, validation, commit hashing, diff, and merge must stay
  deterministic.
- LLMs may propose or generate; they must not be required in the deterministic
  mutation path.
- Source development defaults to no auth locally. Docker/self-hosted evaluation
  keeps auth on by default.
- CLI, MCP, WebUI, API, runner, storage, and YSchema are not all equally stable;
  keep preview/WIP/internal wording accurate.

## Where To Look

- Product overview: `README.md`
- General docs index: `docs/README.md`
- Release surface: `RELEASE.md`, `release/surface.yaml`
- Alpha limitations: `docs/limitations.md`
- Deployment/evaluation: `docs/deployment.md`
- Stability summary: `docs/stability.md`
- Stability policy: `docs/release/stability-policy.md`
- Contributor basics: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Security policy: `SECURITY.md`
