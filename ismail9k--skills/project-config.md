# AGENTS.md

Canonical instruction file for this repository, shared by all coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and others).
Claude Code reaches it through the `@AGENTS.md` import in `CLAUDE.md`. Repository guidance belongs here — not in `CLAUDE.md`, which is only a pointer.

## Agent configuration

Skill-managed settings live under `docs/agents/` as small, focused files rather than inline here, so each can be read by only the skill that needs it:

- `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` — where issues/specs/intents live for this repo, and how to reach them (written by the `configure-issue-tracker` skill)

As more skills are adopted, each may add its own file here (e.g. triage labels, domain-doc layout). List them as they're added so this stays a table of contents, not a place where config itself accumulates.

## Workflow

1. Capture the intent issue on GitHub — `brainstorm-to-issue` skill.
2. If Superpowers is installed, hand the intent issue to Superpowers'
   `brainstorming` skill (seeded via `superpowers-issue-bridge`) to produce
   `spec.md`, then `writing-plans` for `plan.md`.
3. Build, test, review per Superpowers' usual flow.
4. Open the PR referencing the intent issue (`Closes #N` or `Relates to #N`
   per `superpowers-issue-bridge`).

## What this repo is

A skill-authoring repo, not an application. `configure-issue-tracker`, `brainstorm-to-issue`, and `superpowers-issue-bridge` define an intent → spec → plan → PR workflow bridging an issue tracker to the Superpowers skill suite. `agent-md-setup` is generic repository setup rather than part of that pipeline. `anti-koshary` is also **not part of the pipeline** — it is a standalone two-pass codebase audit that happens to be authored here. Keep it that way: it must not grow a dependency on `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` or on an intent issue, because the whole point is that it works on any repo, cold.

Six skills in three groups. Know which group you are editing before you change one:

| Group | Skills | Shares state? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pipeline** | `configure-issue-tracker` → `brainstorm-to-issue` → `superpowers-issue-bridge` | Yes — via `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` and the `Intent-Issue:` header |
| **Utility** | `agent-md-setup`, `fetch-github-issues` | No — each does one job for any repo |
| **Audit** | `anti-koshary` | No — deliberately depends on nothing |

There is no build or lint step — the deliverables are Markdown. `bash scripts/check.sh` is the test step: it verifies the things that can silently rot here (names, manifest coverage, cross-skill coupling, and whether `anti-koshary`'s regexes still match a planted hit). Beyond that, "testing" a change means installing the skill and running it against a real repo.

## Layout convention

One directory per skill under `skills/`, each holding a `SKILL.md` and whatever assets it ships:

```
skills/
├── agent-md-setup/           SKILL.md + assets/
├── configure-issue-tracker/  SKILL.md + assets/
├── brainstorm-to-issue/      SKILL.md
├── superpowers-issue-bridge/ SKILL.md
├── fetch-github-issues/      SKILL.md
└── anti-koshary/             SKILL.md + references/ + scripts/
```

Three things must agree on a skill's name: the **directory**, the skill's **frontmatter `name:`**, and its entry in **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`**'s `skills` array. That name is how the skill is invoked and how `npx skills add ismail9k/skills@<name>` selects it, so adding or renaming one means editing all three plus every doc that cites it — README, this file, and any skill that recommends it by name.

This has already gone wrong once: a directory was renamed and the manifest kept pointing at the old path, so the skill shipped from neither. `bash scripts/check.sh` exists to catch that; run it after any rename.

**Skills here are installed individually**, so each directory must be self-sufficient. Never factor shared content into a file two skills both read — a skill installed on its own arrives with nothing but its own directory. Skills reference each other by name only, never by path.

`skills/agent-md-setup/assets/AGENTS.md` and `.../assets/CLAUDE.md` are the complete templates that skill writes into a target repo. `skills/configure-issue-tracker/assets/AGENTS-sections.md` is the source for the tracker and workflow sections its skill may merge into an existing `AGENTS.md`. Edit those assets, not copies in the skill prose, when generated content changes.

## The pipeline these three skills form

The workflow skills are deliberately sequential and each one's doc explicitly disclaims the next one's job. Preserve that separation when editing. `agent-md-setup` may run first when shared instruction files are wanted, but tracker configuration does not depend on it.

1. **[configure-issue-tracker](skills/configure-issue-tracker/SKILL.md)** — records the tracker backend (GitHub / local markdown / freeform) in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. Later skills read that file rather than guessing a repo.
