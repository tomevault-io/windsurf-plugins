# Cursor Rules Management & SSoT Enforcement

## Single Source of Truth (SSoT)
The **official documentation** located in the `docs/src/content/docs/` folder is the absolute **Single Source of Truth** for this project. This includes coding standards, architecture, workflows, and the Definition of Done (DoD).

## Mandatory Pre-Work: Documentation Review

**Before starting any task, you MUST:**

1. **Familiarize yourself with relevant documentation**: Search and read the official documentation in `docs/src/content/docs/` to understand existing patterns, standards, and decisions.
2. **Check for existing documentation**: Before creating any new documentation file, verify if the topic is already covered in `docs/src/content/docs/`.
3. **Respect the SSoT**: Never create documentation files outside `docs/src/content/docs/` except for:
   - `README.md` files (project root, module directories)
   - `SECURITY.md` (root only - required by GitHub, must link to official docs)
   - Other GitHub-integrated files (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md` in root - must link to official docs)

**If you find yourself about to create documentation outside `docs/src/`, STOP and:**
- Check if it should be in `docs/src/content/docs/` instead
- If it must exist outside (e.g., GitHub integration), make it a minimal pointer that links to the official documentation

## Principles for Rule Creation
To prevent redundancy and maintain consistency, follow these principles when creating or updating `.mdc` files:

1.  **NO REDUNDANCY**: Never duplicate information that is already defined in `docs/src/content/docs/`. 
2.  **REFER NOT DEFINE**: Cursor rules should act as "technical enforcers" or "pointers" to the documentation. Instead of listing rules, provide links to the relevant `.mdx` files in `docs/src/content/docs/`.
3.  **CHECK FIRST**: Before creating a new `.mdc` file or any documentation, search the `docs/src/content/docs/` folder to see if the topic is already covered. If it is, the rule should simply enforce those existing standards.
4.  **REDUCE & CONSOLIDATE**: Prefer fewer, high-quality rules that point to comprehensive documentation over many small, fragmented rules.
5.  **CROSS-REFERENCE**: Always include a `References` section at the end of a rule pointing to the SSoT in `docs/`.

## SSoT Conflict Resolution

**When TaskMaster/PRD content conflicts with `docs/`, always follow `docs/`:**

- TaskMaster tasks and PRDs may contain **outdated information** (e.g., old licensing details, folder structures)
- The `docs/src/content/docs/` folder is **always authoritative**
- If a task description mentions specifics (licenses, paths, patterns) that conflict with docs: **ignore the task description, follow docs**

**Priority order:**
1. `docs/src/content/docs/` (SSoT - highest authority)
2. Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/`) 
3. TaskMaster/PRD (planning context only, may be stale)

## Required Rule Structure
Every `.mdc` file must follow this structure:

```markdown
---
description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
alwaysApply: boolean
---

# Title of the Rule

- **Main Points in Bold**
  - Sub-points with details
  - Examples and explanations
```

## Best Practices
- **File References**: Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` to reference files.
- **Code Examples**: Use language-specific code blocks showing both ✅ DO and ❌ DON'T examples.
- **Formatting**: Use bullet points for clarity and keep descriptions concise.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent formatting and tone across all rules.

## Rule Improvement Triggers
- **New Code Pattern**: If a new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files.
- **Repeated Feedback**: If code reviews or AI interactions repeatedly mention the same feedback.
- **Common Bugs**: If a bug pattern could have been prevented by a rule.
- **SSoT Updates**: Update rules immediately if the corresponding documentation in `docs/` changes.

## Analysis Process
- Compare new code with existing rules and documentation.
- Identify patterns that should be standardized.
- Monitor test patterns and error handling for consistency.

## Content Specific Rules
- **Starlight MDX Headers**: NEVER include a top-level `# ` header in Starlight MDX files. Starlight automatically renders the `title` from the frontmatter as the main `h1`. Use `## ` for the first section.
- **Starlight Code Blocks**: ALWAYS use `frame="none"` for bash/terminal code blocks in Starlight MDX to avoid the "weird dots" (macOS-style window controls) in the terminal frame header, unless a specific `title` is required.
- **Rust Doc Comments**: When writing documentation comments (`///` or `//!`) in Rust files that will be exported to Starlight, ensure terminal blocks use `bash frame="none"` where possible. Note: The `rustdoc-gen.mjs` script attempts to fix this automatically, but maintaining the standard in source is preferred.
