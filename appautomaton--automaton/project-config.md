# AGENTS.md: automaton

Portable, stage-gated agentic-AI harness for Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode.

## Architecture

- **Copy-based install.** Skills and shared runtime files are inspectable after install. `_shared/` installs once under `.agent/.automaton/` where host skills can reference it (see `docs/design-decisions.md` DD-001). Install writes a receipt (`.agent/.automaton/state/install-manifest.json`) recording files, created directories, and merged config fragments per host, so uninstall and upgrade act on exactly what this project received (DD-011).
- **Skills are pure markdown.** `SKILL.md` + `references/` + optional `templates/`. Shared helper scripts live in `skills/_shared/scripts/`.
- **Three hosts.** Claude, Codex, and OpenCode. Each wires startup context through host hooks/plugins and maps subagent tools.
- **Five lifecycle stages plus resume.** Stages: `frame`, `plan`, `execute`, `verify`, `verified`. `resume` re-enters from durable state. Prerequisites are enforced in `runtime/lib/contracts-data.json`.
- **No mandatory nested invocation.** Skills hand off through durable artifacts. Clean same-session continuation is allowed when the lifecycle contract says it is safe.

## Layout

```
bin/        CLI (install, status, validate, context)
hosts/      Host adapters (Claude, Codex, OpenCode)
lib/        CLI + install library (re-exports runtime)
runtime/    Installed into target projects (state, context, validation)
skills/     Skill sources, edit here, not in installed copies
  _shared/  Shared refs + scripts (installed) and authoring guides (not installed)
  auto-*/   Individual skills
tests/      node --test tests/*.test.mjs
docs/       Design rationale (not shipped in npm package)
```

## Commands

```bash
npm test                               # all tests
node --test tests/contracts.test.mjs   # targeted test
node bin/automaton.mjs install --claude .
node bin/automaton.mjs status
node bin/automaton.mjs validate
node bin/automaton.mjs context frame
```

`cli-smoke.test.mjs` is slow (full tree copy). Prefer targeted tests.

## Conventions

- Edit skills in `skills/` only. Never edit installed copies.
- Shared references and scripts go in `skills/_shared/`. Install copies them once into `.agent/.automaton/references/` and `.agent/.automaton/scripts/`.
- Skill entry points should stay clear, concise, high-signal, and platform-agnostic. Detail belongs in `references/` and is loaded via inline conditional triggers (`Read references/X.md when Y`) when progressive disclosure keeps the entry point easier to use.
- `current.json` is the sole status cursor. Update it only through `sync-status.mjs`.
- Runtime enforces L1 validation (stage enum, pointer resolution) as error diagnostics. The shared scripts also surface L2 artifact-shape lint as warning diagnostics that never block. L3 norms live in prompts and tests.

## Design Documentation

- [`docs/design-decisions.md`](docs/design-decisions.md): architectural choices with rationale
- [`docs/progressive-disclosure.md`](docs/progressive-disclosure.md): the progressive-disclosure loading model
- [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md): test layer map, rationale homes, and authoring rules for new guards
