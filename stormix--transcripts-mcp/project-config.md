# Call-stack diffs with calldiff

Calldiff is optional. Use it only when a call-stack tree would help a reviewer understand a real call-flow change. Do **not** include it in routine chat summaries, status updates, or wrap-ups.

## When to use

Include a call-stack diff in a plan, design doc, or PR description when **all** of these are true:

- The change rewires call flow: new, removed, or moved callees; refactored control flow; extracted or inlined functions
- The new vs old call tree is not obvious from the code or a short prose description
- The audience is a reviewer who needs to see how control flow moved

## When to skip

Skip calldiff (do not run it, do not paste a tree, do not mention that you skipped it) when:

- The message is a normal chat reply, task wrap-up, or end-of-turn summary
- The change is UI/copy, styling, config, dependency, translation, tests, or docs
- The call-flow change is small or obvious (renames, extra args, a single new call)
- calldiff would produce noise, an empty tree, or no useful signal

## How to run

Use `npx calldiff@latest`. Defaults compare HEAD vs the working tree.

```bash
npx calldiff@latest diff --file packages/adapters/src/cursor.ts
npx calldiff@latest diff main --entry toMessage
```

Other useful commands:

```bash
npx calldiff@latest tree --entry toMessage
npx calldiff@latest reach --entry grepTranscripts --to toMessage
```

Scope with `--file` / `--entry` and `--maxDepth`. Keep the pasted tree to the entrypoints that changed.

Paste the output in a fenced `diff` block.

## Caveats

- Calldiff is syntactic (tree-sitter). Dynamic calls and trait-object dispatch will not resolve.
- Grammars download on first use into `~/.cache/calldiff/grammars`.
- If you chose to run calldiff and it produces nothing useful, fall back to a short hand-written call tree per the [show-me](../../.agents/skills/show-me/SKILL.md) skill, or omit the tree entirely.
