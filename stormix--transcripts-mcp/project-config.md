ENFORCE:
  - type: process
    steps:
      - name: temporary_file_creation
        description: Create or edit files with temporary extension
        requirements:
          - Use .mdc-tmp extension for all new or modified cursor rules
          - Place temporary files in same location as target .mdc file
        pattern: "^.*\\.mdc-tmp$"

      - name: existing_file_modification
        description: Process for modifying existing rules
        requirements:
          - Copy existing .mdc file to .mdc-tmp before ANY modifications
          - Get user approval of the initial copy
          - Only after approval, make edits in the temporary file
          - Maintain original file until changes are approved
        notes: |
          The initial copy step and its approval are crucial for:
          - Verifying the starting point is correct
          - Making the subsequent changes more visible
          - Preventing accidental loss of content

      - name: file_finalization
        description: Process for finalizing rule files
        requirements:
          - Review changes in temporary file
          - Use terminal command (cp or mv) to create final .mdc file - NEVER use internal file editing tools
          - Remove temporary file after successful creation
        notes: |
          Due to a known limitation, internal file editing tools cannot be used to create or modify .mdc files directly.
          Always use terminal commands like `cp` or `mv` for the final step.

examples:
  - scenario: "Creating new rule"
    steps:
      - "Create: example-rule.mdc-tmp"
      - "Get approval for initial empty file"
      - "Edit temporary file"
      - "Review changes"
      - "Copy to: example-rule.mdc"
      - "Remove temporary file"

  - scenario: "Modifying existing rule"
    steps:
      - "Copy existing.mdc to existing.mdc-tmp"
      - "Get approval for initial copy"
      - "Edit temporary file"
      - "Review changes"
      - "Copy back to existing.mdc"
      - "Remove temporary file"
