# Workflow Guidelines

## First Step for Any Task

- Before starting work on any task, always check the `.cursor/rules` directory for relevant guidance
- Read [AI_POLICY.md](mdc:AI_POLICY.md) — contributions must comply with it
- These documents contain established workflows, conventions, and requirements for different aspects of the project
- Following these rule files will ensure consistency and reduce rework
- If multiple rule files seem relevant, review all of them before proceeding


## Philosophy

This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut becomes someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt that slows the whole team down.

You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners you cut will be cut again.

Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.



## Last Step for Any Task

- If you've learned new concepts, workflows, or best practices during task completion, suggest updates to the relevant rules
- For new workflows that aren't covered by existing rules, suggest creating a new rule file
- **Create a changeset if your changes are worth mentioning in the changelog:**
  - Run `pnpm changeset` for new features, bug fixes, or breaking changes
  - See `090-changesets.mdc` for detailed guidelines on when and how to create changesets
  - Skip changesets for refactoring, formatting, or internal changes
- Evaluate whether tests should be added for your changes:
  - For functional code, new features, API changes, or bug fixes, tests are essential
  - For content-only changes like frontend changes or documentation updates, tests are typically not required
  - When in doubt, err on the side of adding tests - they provide long-term stability and prevent regressions
- Always run appropriate linting and formatting before considering a task complete:

  - Commands must be run from the root of the monorepo

  ```bash
  pnpm lint:fix
  pnpm format
  ```

- Verify that no regressions are introduced by your changes
- For plans, design docs, or PR descriptions where call flow actually changed and a tree would help reviewers, optionally include a `npx calldiff@latest diff` — see [095-calldiff.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/095-calldiff.mdc). Do not add call-stack diffs to routine chat summaries.

## Available Rules

The following rules are available in the `.cursor/rules` directory:

### Core Project Rules

- **010-workflow.mdc** - Workflow guidelines and task management procedures
- **020-codebase-structure.mdc** - Project structure, commands, and development setup
- **030-coding-style.mdc** - Coding standards and style guidelines for all technologies
- **031-never-use-any.mdc** - TypeScript type safety enforcement
- **032-import-rules.mdc** - Import rules for cross-package imports
- **050-testing.mdc** - Vitest and PGlite testing conventions
- **070-comments-defensive-programming.mdc** - Comments and defensive programming guidelines
- **080-ai-interaction.mdc** - AI interaction guidelines and communication style rules
- **090-changesets.mdc** - Changeset management for features and fixes
- **095-calldiff.mdc** - Optionally include calldiff call-stack diffs in plans/PRs when call flow changed; skip routine chat summaries

### Special Rules

- **999-mdc-format.mdc** - Guide for creating and maintaining MDC rule files

### Agent skills (`.agents/skills`)

- **git-conventions** ([SKILL.md](../../.agents/skills/git-conventions/SKILL.md)) - Git commit message format, branch naming, and version control practices

When working on specific aspects of the project, consult the relevant rules above to ensure compliance with established patterns and standards.
