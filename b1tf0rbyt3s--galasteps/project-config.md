# GalaSteps — Hermes Agent Context

## What This Is

GalaSteps is a bilingual (EN/ES) early childhood development app for ages 0-5, tracking milestones and providing AI-powered parenting guidance. Built with Next.js (web), Expo/React Native (mobile), and Supabase.

**Repo:** `b1tf0rbyt3s/galasteps`
**Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
**Web:** Next.js 16 on Vercel (galasteps.com)
**Mobile:** Expo SDK 55 via EAS
**Database:** Supabase (`wmweqtpzaqipxpoyfoaf` — dev)

## TypeScript — Incremental Compilation

**CRITICAL:** Running bare `tsc --noEmit` on this monorepo will OOM or take 5+ minutes. Always use incremental mode:

```bash
# Correct — incremental, uses cache
tsc --noEmit --incremental --tsBuildInfoFile .tsbuildinfo

# Also correct — turbo handles parallelism
pnpm typecheck

# WRONG — will crash or hang
tsc --noEmit
```

If your run takes more than 60 seconds, you're doing it wrong. Kill and retry with `--incremental`.

## Work Patterns

### Before Starting Any Task
1. Read the issue/task description fully
2. Check which files are involved: `git diff main --name-only` or look at the issue labels
3. Plan your approach in a comment before writing code
4. Run `pnpm typecheck` (incremental) to establish baseline — fix nothing that wasn't already broken

### During Development
1. Make focused, minimal changes — one concern per commit
2. Run typecheck after each logical change, not just at the end
3. If you break something unrelated, revert and isolate
4. Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`

### Before Completing
1. `pnpm typecheck` — must pass clean
2. `pnpm lint` — must pass clean
3. Verify your changes make sense as a coherent diff
4. Write a summary comment on the issue explaining what you did and why

## What NOT To Do

**Do NOT make Paperclip API calls.** You are an agent managed by Paperclip — you do not need to call the Paperclip API. Your job is to work on the GalaSteps codebase, not manage yourself. If you find yourself writing `curl` commands to `localhost:3100` or any Paperclip endpoint, STOP — that's not your task.

**Do NOT:**
- Run bare `tsc --noEmit` (use `--incremental`)
- Push directly to `main` — always use feature branches
- Add secret keys to client-side code or `EXPO_PUBLIC_` vars
- Include child PII in AI prompts (COPPA)
- Remove `"packageManager": "pnpm@10.28.0"` from root package.json
- Change `node-linker=hoisted` in `.npmrc`
- Use npm or yarn — this is pnpm only
- Create separate CSS files — use Tailwind utilities inline

## Content Pipeline (Sage-specific)

Sage writes proposed content to the `content_staging` table in Supabase dev. Sean reviews via the admin platform.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Newly staged, awaiting review |
| `approved` | Moves to live tables |
| `rejected` | Archived |
| `needs_revision` | Sean left notes — Sage picks up |

Content types: `activity`, `milestone`, `domain_update`, `tip`, `resource`
Domains: social, creative, physical, language, math, science
Age bands: 0-3mo, 3-6mo, 6-9mo, 9-12mo, 12-18mo, 18-24mo, 2-3yr, 3-4yr, 4-5yr

All content must have source citations (CDC/AAP/WHO) and bilingual coverage (EN + ES).

## COPPA Compliance (Kira-specific)

This is a children's app. COPPA compliance is non-negotiable:
- No child PII in analytics events (Vercel Analytics + `sanitizeEventProperties`; COPPA-blocked routes skip scripts)
- No child names/photos/DOB in AI prompts — use anonymized age + milestone data
- RLS on all tables — verify with `supabase inspect db policies`
- Consent gates before data collection
- Mobile: no product analytics; structured errors via `@galakids/logger` scrub only when used

## Key Supabase Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `milestones` | CDC developmental milestones by age/domain |
| `activities` | Parent-facing activities linked to milestones |
| `milestone_activities` | Junction table |
| `children` | Child profiles (parent_id FK, PII-sensitive) |
| `profiles` | Parent user profiles |
| `content_staging` | Sage's content pipeline staging area |
