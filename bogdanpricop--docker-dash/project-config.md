# CLAUDE.md — Docker Dash project conventions

This file is loaded into every Claude Code session in this repo. Keep it tight; durable conventions only, not transient state.

## What this project is

Self-hosted Docker management dashboard. Single binary, no build step, vanilla JS frontend, SQLite embedded. Two deployment modes: **standalone** (default) and **HA** (opt-in `DD_MODE=ha`, Redis-backed leader election).

Current version source of truth: [`src/version.js`](src/version.js). Bump via `npm version X.Y.Z` (runs `scripts/sync-version.js` to propagate to `docker-compose.yml` + `package.json`).

## Architecture invariants — DO NOT violate

1. **No build step.** Frontend is plain JS loaded via `<script>` tags. Don't add webpack/vite/esbuild. CSS is one file `public/css/app.css`.
2. **No frontend framework.** No React/Vue/Svelte. Plain DOM manipulation via objects with `render(container)` methods.
3. **CommonJS backend.** `require()` / `module.exports`. Don't introduce ESM `import`.
4. **SQLite embedded.** No external DB. Migrations auto-apply at startup from `src/db/migrations/NNN_*.js`. Numbering is monotonic — never reuse a number.
5. **Audit trail mandatory** for any state-changing action: `auditService.log({ userId, username, action, targetType, targetId, details, ip })`.
6. **RBAC mandatory** on routes that touch state: `requireAuth` + `requireRole('admin')` + `writeable` middleware chain.
7. **Output escaping.** Frontend uses `Utils.escapeHtml(value)` on every interpolated user-facing string. Inline `onclick=` in template strings is forbidden — use `addEventListener` after rendering.
8. **No secrets in source.** AES-256-GCM via `src/utils/crypto.js` for credentials at rest. `ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var required at startup.

## Deep-spec discipline (the project's own workflow)

Strategic features ship in order: deep-spec → feature-spec → code → tests → release. Plans live in `plans/` (gitignored, local-only). The discipline is non-negotiable for major features (everything that ships in a `.0` minor): write the strategic intent before code, get acceptance, then execute.

Anti-features are documented WITH RATIONALE in each deep-spec's "OUT" section. If the user later asks "why didn't we ship X?", the deep-spec answers in writing.

Examples already in `plans/` (gitignored, but referenced by CHANGELOG):
- `deep-spec-ai-features.md` (v8.0.0)
- `deep-spec-registry-hygiene-pack.md` (v8.1.0)
- `deep-spec-v8.2.0-pcloud-and-archives.md` (v8.2.0)

## Operational conventions

- **Port:** `8101` (HTTP) — referenced in `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, README. Do NOT use `3456` (legacy from v5.x docs that may still appear).
- **Default admin:** `admin` / `admin` (forced password change on first login). `c#12` is the local dev override.
- **Test runner:** `npm test` runs Jest with `--forceExit`. CI lint is enforced as of v7.7.0 — fails on any warning.
- **Deploy targets:** local (Docker Desktop), LAN (`192.168.13.20`, user `localadmin-a`), public VPS (`89.37.212.66`, user `root`). Both remotes use SSH key auth (no password). See [`memory/server_deploy.md`](C:/Users/bogdan.pricop/.claude/projects/c--Users-bogdan-pricop-OneDrive---All4Labels-Documents-TypeScript-docker-dash/memory/server_deploy.md) for the full sequence.
- **Build target:** ALWAYS pass `--target production` to `docker build`. Buildkit otherwise tries the `development` stage in parallel and fails on `npm install` if dev-deps registry is unreachable.

## File-size guidelines (post-v8.2.0 audit)

- Frontend pages > 1500 lines should split via the `containers.js` + `container-detail.js` lazy-merge pattern (see v6.16.0 architecture). For non-lazy splits (pure organisational), see the v8.2.x `system-egress.js` extract.
- Backend route files > 2000 lines should split by sub-resource.
- Migrations should NOT contain bulk content (howto guides, template seeds). Use `src/db/howto-content/<slug>.md` (with optional `.ro.md` companion) and the import-at-startup loader (`src/services/howto-loader.js`) instead.

## How-To content precedence (v8.2.x)

When the server starts, this is the order of operations on `howto_guides`:

1. Migrations 040, 041, 042, 048, 050, 052, 053, 055, 058-062 INSERT initial built-in rows (historical seed).
2. `howto-loader.js` walks `src/db/howto-content/`, parses each `.md` file's YAML front-matter, UPSERTS into `howto_guides`. Markdown content **overrides** the migration content for any matching slug.

**Practical rule:** to add or edit a how-to, drop a markdown file. Don't touch migrations. The 132 markdown files committed in v8.2.x are the canonical source for the 66 howtos that have body content; migrations remain only as the schema-of-record + safety net for fresh installs that have no markdown directory mounted (which shouldn't happen with the production image, but the redundancy is cheap).

To migrate a how-to from migration to markdown: drop `src/db/howto-content/<slug>.md` with the same `slug` as the migration's INSERT. Loader UPSERTs, migration's content stops being the source of truth.
