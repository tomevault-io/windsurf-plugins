# OpenPrey Agent Guide

This file describes project goals, rules, and workflow expectations for anyone working on OpenPrey.

**Project Metadata**
- Name: OpenPrey
- Author: themuffinator
- Company: DarkMatter Productions
- Version: 0.0.1
- Repository: `https://github.com/themuffinator/OpenPrey`
- Companion GameLibs Repo (local): `E:\Repositories\OpenPrey-GameLibs`

**Goals**
- Deliver a minimal, clean adaptation of the OpenQ4-derived engine for Prey (2006).
- Preserve behavior expected by shipped Prey assets where practical.
- Keep single-player and multiplayer behavior compatible with Prey’s unified game-library model.
- Prefer Doom 3 lineage behavior over Quake 4-specific behavior where Prey requires it.
- Restore missing Doom 3/Prey-era systems where required for compatibility (including particle-system behavior).
- Keep a unified runtime game directory layout under `basepr/`.

**Rules**
- Treat `E:\Repositories\OpenPrey-GameLibs` as part of the same working set for planning, edits, and validation.
- For SDK/game-library work, make canonical source edits in `OpenPrey-GameLibs` first; `src/game` in this repo is a synchronized mirror.
- Keep `OpenPrey` free of references to the old OpenQ4 closed-source BSE companion-repo workflow.
- Do not assume Steam/GOG distribution paths for Prey (2006). Auto-detection must support CD-era installs.
- Prefer robust install discovery from registry/app-path/uninstall entries and known legacy install roots.
- Never launch OpenPrey in fullscreen from agent workflows; always force windowed mode with `+set r_fullscreen 0` (and equivalent config/cvar handling).
- Keep Meson as the canonical OpenPrey build entry point.
- Use `builddir/` as standard local build output.
- Use `.install/` as staged runtime package root.
- Keep compiler/linker intermediates in `builddir/`, not `.install/`.
- Keep documentation current whenever workflow, naming, or repository structure changes.

**Build/Tooling Conventions**
- On Windows, use `tools/build/meson_setup.ps1 ...` (or `tools/build/openprey_devcmd.cmd`) so MSVC environment setup is consistent.
- Use `meson install -C builddir --no-rebuild --skip-subprojects` when staging `.install/`.
- GameLibs helper environment variables:
  - `OPENPREY_GAMELIBS_REPO=<path>`
  - `OPENPREY_SKIP_GAMELIBS_SYNC=1`
  - `OPENPREY_BUILD_GAMELIBS=1`
  - `OPENPREY_SKIP_GAMELIBS_BUILD=1`
- Legacy `OPENQ4_*` variants are accepted only as temporary migration compatibility inputs.

**Runtime Module Direction**
- Treat Prey as primarily using a unified game module (`game`/`gamex86`) rather than hard split SP/MP DLL ownership.
- OpenPrey may retain temporary split-module compatibility (`game_sp`/`game_mp`) during migration, but unified-module behavior is the target.

**.install Layout (Staging Target)**
- `.install/` is the runtime package root used by local staging and `fs_cdpath` overlays.
- Keep executables in `.install/`.
- Keep game modules and staged content in `.install/basepr/`.
- Avoid shipping build-only artifacts (for example import libs) in `.install/`.

**Development Procedure (Current Direction)**
1. Develop against installed Prey assets (not repo-side replacement content when avoidable).
2. Prefer launches from `.install/` so staged overlays are exercised.
3. Fix compatibility in engine/game/parser/loader code rather than shipping content hacks.
4. Validate with log-driven short-run loops, then with in-game map gameplay relevant to the change.

**Debug Loop**
1. Launch with the mode-appropriate debug configuration in windowed mode only (force `+set r_fullscreen 0`).
2. Let the engine initialize and enter the target gameplay state.
3. Close and inspect `fs_savepath\<gameDir>\logs\openprey.log`.
4. Resolve errors/warnings.
5. Repeat until clean.

**Temporary Files**
- Use `.tmp/` under the repository root for temporary task artifacts.
