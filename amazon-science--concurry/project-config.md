# Mutable Default Arguments and Context Managers

## Mutable Default Arguments

**Never use mutable objects as default argument values.** This is a classic Python trap: the default is shared across all calls, so mutations persist between invocations.

❌ Bad:
```python
def submit_batch(self, tasks: List[Task] = []) -> List[Future]:
    tasks.append(self._sentinel_task)  # ❌ Mutates the shared default!
    return [self._submit(t) for t in tasks]
```

✅ Good:
```python
def submit_batch(self, tasks: Optional[List[Task]] = None) -> List[Future]:
    if tasks is None:
        tasks = []
    tasks.append(self._sentinel_task)
    return [self._submit(t) for t in tasks]
```

This applies to all mutable types: `list`, `dict`, `set`, `bytearray`, and any custom mutable class.

## Context Managers

Use `with` statements for any resource that must be released: files, locks, semaphores, connections, temporary directories. This is especially critical in a concurrency library where leaked resources cause deadlocks.

- Always use `with` for locks: `with self._lock:`
- Always use `with` for file I/O: `with open(path) as f:`
- Implement `__enter__`/`__exit__` (or use `@contextmanager`) for custom resources that need cleanup
- Prefer `contextlib.suppress(ExceptionType)` over `try/except: pass` when intentionally ignoring specific exceptions

❌ Bad:
```python
self._lock.acquire()
try:
    self._shared_state.update(data)
finally:
    self._lock.release()
```

✅ Good:
```python
with self._lock:
    self._shared_state.update(data)
```
