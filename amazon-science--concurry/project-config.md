# Execution Mode Testing

## Pytest Fixtures from conftest.py

The [tests/conftest.py](mdc:tests/conftest.py) file provides essential fixtures for testing across all execution modes. **Always use these fixtures** when writing tests.

### Available Fixtures

#### 1. `worker_mode` Fixture

**Purpose**: Parametrize tests across ALL execution modes (sync, thread, process, asyncio, ray)

**Usage**:
```python
def test_my_feature(self, worker_mode):
    """Test feature across all execution modes."""
    w = MyWorker.options(mode=worker_mode).init(param=value)
    
    # Your test logic
    result = w.method().result()
    assert result == expected
    
    w.stop()
```

**Important**: This fixture automatically runs your test 5 times (once per mode). If Ray is not installed, it runs 4 times.

#### 2. `pool_mode` Fixture

**Purpose**: Parametrize tests across pool-supporting modes (thread, process, ray)

**Usage**:
```python
def test_pool_feature(self, pool_mode):
    """Test feature that requires multiple workers."""
    w = MyWorker.options(mode=pool_mode, max_workers=3).init()
    
    # Your test logic for pools
    futures = [w.task(i) for i in range(10)]
    results = [f.result() for f in futures]
    
    w.stop()
```

**Why separate from worker_mode?**: Sync and asyncio modes only support `max_workers=1`, so pool-specific features cannot be tested with them.

#### 3. `initialize_ray` Fixture

**Purpose**: Session-level fixture that initializes Ray once before all tests

**Usage**: Automatic - no need to explicitly use this fixture. Ray is initialized at session start if available.

**Important**: Always include the runtime_env when manually initializing Ray in tests:
```python
import ray
import morphic
import concurry

ray.init(
    ignore_reinit_error=True,
    num_cpus=4,
    runtime_env={"py_modules": [concurry, morphic]},
)
```

### Explicit `max_workers` Requirement (**CRITICAL**)

- Every test must call `.options()` with an explicit `max_workers` argument for any execution mode that allows more than a single worker (`thread`, `process`, `ray`).
- Always order the call as `Worker.options(mode=..., max_workers=..., ...)` so the requirement stays obvious in code review.
- Hard-code the current defaults whenever the test depends on them: `thread → 30`, `process → 4`, `ray → 0`. (These values may change later; tests must keep declaring what they expect.)
- Sync and asyncio workers must **omit** `max_workers` (they only support `1` and enforce it automatically).
- Pools, decorated workers, task helpers, and any other helper that wraps `.options()` have to follow the same rule—if the mode supports multiple workers, pass `max_workers` explicitly in the helper.

### WORKER_MODES and POOL_MODES Constants

Available for direct use when needed:
```python
from tests.conftest import WORKER_MODES, POOL_MODES

# WORKER_MODES = ["sync", "thread", "process", "asyncio", "ray"]  # if Ray installed
# POOL_MODES = ["thread", "process", "ray"]  # if Ray installed
```

## Comprehensive Execution Mode Testing

### Golden Rule: Test ALL Execution Modes

**Every test must run across all applicable execution modes using the `worker_mode` or `pool_mode` fixture.**

❌ **NEVER write tests like this:**
```python
def test_feature(self):
    """Bad: Only tests sync mode."""
    worker = MyWorker.options(mode="sync").init()
    # ...
```

✅ **ALWAYS write tests like this:**
```python
def test_feature(self, worker_mode):
    """Good: Tests all execution modes."""
    worker = MyWorker.options(mode=worker_mode).init()
    # ...
```

### Example: Basic Test Structure

```python
def test_basic_computation(self, worker_mode):
    """Test basic computation across all execution modes."""
    w = ComputeWorker.options(mode=worker_mode).init(multiplier=2)
    result = w.compute(5).result(timeout=5.0)
    assert result == 10
    w.stop()
```

### Example: Pool-Specific Test

```python
def test_pool_feature(self, pool_mode):
    """Test feature requiring multiple workers."""
    if pool_mode in ("sync", "asyncio"):
        pytest.skip("Sync and asyncio only support max_workers=1")
    
    w = MyWorker.options(mode=pool_mode, max_workers=3).init()
    # Test pool-specific functionality
    w.stop()
```

---

## Handling Mode-Specific Behavior
### NEVER Skip Tests Due to Failures in a certain execution mode
**Critical Rule**: If a test fails for certain execution modes, **DO NOT skip it**. These are important edge cases that must be handled.

❌ **WRONG Approach:**
```python
def test_feature(self, worker_mode):
    if worker_mode == "ray":
        pytest.skip("Fails on Ray, skipping")  # ❌ NEVER DO THIS
    
    # test logic
```

✅ **CORRECT Approach - Handle the Edge Case:**
```python
def test_feature(self, worker_mode):
    """Test feature with mode-specific behavior."""
    w = MyWorker.options(mode=worker_mode).init()
    
    if worker_mode == "ray":
        # Ray has different behavior - test it explicitly
        with pytest.raises(SpecificException, match="expected message"):
            w.problematic_method()
    else:
        # Other modes work normally
        result = w.problematic_method().result()
        assert result == expected
    
    w.stop()
```
