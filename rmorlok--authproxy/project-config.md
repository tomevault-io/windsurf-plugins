# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AuthProxy is an open-source, embeddable integration platform-as-a-service (iPaaS). It manages the connection lifecycle to 3rd party systems, allowing applications to call those systems through an authenticating proxy.

## Workflow

### Preflight (required before commit)

```bash
./scripts/preflight.sh
```

This regenerates Swagger docs and checks the integration-tests module is consistent. Fix any failures before committing.

### Working with pull requests

- **Apply the issue's labels to the PR.** When opening a PR that closes a labelled issue, copy those labels onto the PR (e.g. `gh pr create --label "project:api-key"`). Keeps project-tracking views consistent and surfaces the PR in the same dashboards as the issue.
- **Tag the PR with the local clone it came from.** Several clones of this repo coexist on the same machine (`~/src/authproxy1`, `~/src/authproxy2`, …) and it's useful to know which one produced a given PR. Take the current directory's basename — if it matches `authproxy<N>` (single-digit suffix `0-9`) — and apply a `clone:authproxy<N>` label. Create the label first if it doesn't exist (`gh label create clone:authproxy<N> --color BFD4F2`). If the basename doesn't match the `authproxy<N>` pattern (e.g. a fork, a feature-named worktree), skip this label.
- **Respond to PR review comments after addressing them.** When you push a change that resolves a review comment, reply on the original comment thread describing what changed (link to the commit if useful). Don't leave the reviewer guessing whether their feedback landed.
- **Include screenshots in the PR description for UI changes.** Any PR that touches `ui/admin` or `ui/marketplace` should embed before/after (or empty/populated/edge-case) screenshots inline in the PR description so reviewers don't have to spin up a dev server to see what changed. Capture them via Chrome DevTools MCP — against a running dev server for page-level changes, or against Storybook (`yarn workspace @authproxy/admin storybook`) for component-level changes. **Prefer hosting the images outside the repo** — drag-and-dropping into the PR description on github.com produces `user-attachments` URLs that survive without polluting the repo. The fallback (when image hosting isn't available, e.g. for automated agents — GitHub doesn't expose `user-attachments` upload via REST) is to commit PNGs under `docs/screenshots/<branch-or-feature-name>/` and reference them from the PR description via `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/docs/screenshots/...` URLs so they render in the description.

## Running locally

### Backend dependencies

```bash
# Data stores only (Postgres, Redis, MinIO, ClickHouse)
docker compose up -d

# Full stack including the AuthProxy server
docker compose --profile server up -d

# Tear down everything (containers + volumes)
./scripts/teardown-docker.sh
```

### Run the server

```bash
go run ./cmd/server serve --config=./dev_config/default.yaml all
```

The final arg is the service to run: `admin-api`, `api`, `public`, `worker`, or `all`.

### Run the client proxy

```bash
# JWT-signing reverse proxy to the AuthProxy server itself (dev tool).
go run ./cmd/cli signing-proxy --enableLoginRedirect=true --proxyTo=api

# Connection-scoped streaming reverse proxy through /_proxy_raw.
go run ./cmd/cli proxy --connection cxn_xxx --upstream-base https://api.openai.com

# One-shot through curl or wget. Everything after `curl`/`wget` is
# forwarded to the tool verbatim; all ap proxy flags must come before it.
go run ./cmd/cli proxy --connection cxn_xxx curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models
go run ./cmd/cli proxy --connection cxn_xxx wget https://api.openai.com/files/big.bin -O out.bin
```

### Other useful commands

```bash
# Print all routes
go run ./cmd/server routes --config=./dev_config/default.yaml
```

### Frontend

Node + yarn pinned via Volta (versions in `package.json`).

```bash
volta install node && volta install yarn
yarn install
yarn workspace @authproxy/marketplace dev
yarn workspace @authproxy/admin dev
```

### Monitoring tools

```bash
# RedisInsight — also available via docker-compose's "tools" profile (port 5540)
docker run -d --name redisinsight -p 5540:5540 -v redisinsight:/data --network authproxy redis/redisinsight:latest

# Asynqmon (background-task dashboard)
docker run --rm -d --name asynqmon --network authproxy -p 8090:8080 hibiken/asynqmon --redis-addr=redis-server:6379

# Asynq CLI
go install github.com/hibiken/asynq/tools/asynq@latest && asynq dash
```

## Architecture

### Service ports (defaults from `dev_config/default.yaml`)

| Service | Port | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `public` | 8080 | OAuth callbacks, marketplace |
| `api` | 8081 | Core API for application integration |
| `admin-api` | 8082 | Administrative API + UI |
| `worker` | 8083 (health) | Background-task processor (Asynq) |

All services are coordinated through the `cmd/server` entrypoint using the service-based architecture in `internal/service/`.

### Layering

- `internal/core` is the business-logic layer — fully hydrated models on top of the database and Redis.
