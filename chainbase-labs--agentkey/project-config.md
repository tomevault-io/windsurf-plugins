# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents (Codex, and any AGENTS.md-aware tool) when working with code in this repository. It mirrors `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — keep the two in sync.

## What This Repo Is

AgentKey Skill ships the agent-side half of AgentKey: a single skill that teaches agents how to call the AgentKey MCP tools correctly.

AgentKey has **two pieces** and a full end-user install is two commands:

1. `npx skills add chainbase-labs/agentkey` — installs **this** skill. It does NOT register the MCP server.
2. `npx -y @agentkey/cli --auth-login` — runs the AgentKey CLI (`@agentkey/cli` from `../AgentKey-Server/cli`). It mints an API key via device-code login and writes a remote-HTTP MCP block (pointing at `https://api.agentkey.app/v1/mcp`) into agent configs (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and 13 more). The hosted MCP server itself lives at `/v1/mcp` on AgentKey-Server.

The skill is useless without the MCP server; the MCP server works without the skill but the agent won't know to prefer it over built-in web search. Keep this mental model when editing docs — do not let either command drift into claiming it does both.

The same repo also works as:

- a **Claude Code plugin** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + root `.mcp.json`) — the plugin's `userConfig` injects the API key via `${user_config.AGENTKEY_API_KEY}`, substituting for step 2.
- a **Codex plugin** (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` + `.codex-plugin/mcp.json`, distributed through `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; the repo is its own marketplace: `codex plugin marketplace add chainbase-labs/agentkey`). Codex plugins have no `userConfig`/header-interpolation mechanism, so auth uses MCP OAuth via the server's RFC 9728 metadata discovery (`type` + `url` only in mcp.json), substituting for step 2.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Test a local edit against every detected agent
npx skills add .

# Daily commit (does NOT trigger user updates)
git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push origin main

# Publish a new release
# Releases are cut automatically by release-please on merge to main.
# To manually trigger: merge a conventional-commit PR; release-please will open
# a Release PR; merge that to tag and create the GitHub Release.

# Undo a bad release
git tag -d vX.Y.Z && git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
gh release delete vX.Y.Z --repo chainbase-labs/agentkey --yes
```

Releases are driven by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please): merged PRs with Conventional Commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `feat!:`, etc.) update an open Release PR that bumps `skills/agentkey/version.txt`, both plugin manifest versions, and `CHANGELOG.md`. Merging the Release PR tags the release and creates the GitHub Release, which in turn triggers plugin updates for users.

## Version & Release Rules

- `skills/agentkey/version.txt`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` version, and `CHANGELOG.md` are managed by release-please based on Conventional Commits — never edit manually except via PR that intentionally amends them.
- `version.txt` lives inside `skills/agentkey/` (not at repo root) so it travels with the skill when the Skills CLI copies the subdirectory. `release-please-config.json` points at this path via `version-file`.
- Tag format: `v` prefix (e.g. `v0.4.5`)
- Plugin updates trigger on **GitHub Release** publication, not on plain commits
- `npx skills update` pulls from the default branch, so main must always be shippable

## Change Checklists

**Changes to either `plugin.json`:**
- release-please automatically bumps both manifest versions + `CHANGELOG.md` from merged conventional-commit PRs; maintainers review + merge the generated Release PR rather than editing these files directly

**Changes to the root `.mcp.json` (Claude Code plugin path):**
- The MCP server is `type: http` (remote endpoint, no subprocess), so inject the API key by interpolating the userConfig value as `${user_config.AGENTKEY_API_KEY}` in the `Authorization` header — the key name MUST match the `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `userConfig` key. Do NOT use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>}`: those env vars are only exported to stdio/subprocess servers and hook/monitor commands, and are not interpolated into an http server's headers.
