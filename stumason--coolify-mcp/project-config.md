# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Coolify that provides 42 token-optimized tools for AI assistants to manage infrastructure through natural language. Tools cover servers, projects, environments, applications, databases, services, deployments, private keys, teams, cloud tokens, documentation search, smart diagnostics, and batch operations. v2.0.0 reduced token usage by 85% (from ~43,000 to ~6,600 tokens) by consolidating related operations into single tools with action parameters.

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run build        # Build TypeScript to dist/
npm test             # Run all tests
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run format       # Run Prettier

# Run locally
COOLIFY_BASE_URL="https://your-coolify.com" COOLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN="token" node dist/index.js
```

## Architecture

### File Structure Pattern

When adding new Coolify API endpoints, follow this order:

1. **src/types/coolify.ts** - Add TypeScript interfaces
2. **src/lib/coolify-client.ts** - Add API client method with explicit return type
3. **src/lib/mcp-server.ts** - Add MCP tool definition
4. **src/**tests**/mcp-server.test.ts** - Add mocked test

### Key Files

- **src/index.ts** - Entry point, starts MCP server
- **src/lib/coolify-client.ts** - HTTP client wrapping Coolify REST API
- **src/lib/mcp-server.ts** - MCP tool definitions and handlers
- **src/types/coolify.ts** - All Coolify API type definitions
- **docs/openapi-chunks/** - OpenAPI spec chunks for reference

### Context-Optimized Responses

List endpoints return summaries (uuid, name, status) not full objects. This reduces response sizes by 90-99%. Use `get_*` tools for full details of a single resource.

## Adding New Endpoints

1. Verify endpoint exists in `docs/openapi-chunks/`
2. Add types to `src/types/coolify.ts`
3. Add client method with explicit return type
4. Add MCP tool to `src/lib/mcp-server.ts`
5. Add mocked tests (required for codecov coverage)

### Testing Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: All new client methods MUST have test coverage to pass codecov checks.

When adding new client methods, you must add:

1. **Client method tests** in `src/__tests__/coolify-client.test.ts`:
   - Test the HTTP method (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
   - Test the endpoint path
   - Test the request body if applicable
   - Follow the existing test patterns in the file

2. **Method existence tests** in `src/__tests__/mcp-server.test.ts`:
   - Add `expect(typeof client.methodName).toBe('function');` in the appropriate section
   - Ensures the method is properly exported and accessible

**codecov will fail PRs with uncovered lines.** Always run `npm test` before committing.

### Client Method Example

```typescript
async getResource(uuid: string): Promise<Resource> {
  return this.request<Resource>(`/resources/${uuid}`);
}
```

### Test Example

```typescript
it('should call client method', async () => {
  const spy = jest.spyOn(server['client'], 'getResource').mockResolvedValue({ uuid: 'test' });
  await server.get_resource('test-uuid');
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('test-uuid');
});
```

### Smoke Testing Against Live Server

After fixing bugs, always verify fixes work against the real Coolify instance — not just unit tests.

- **`/smoke-test`** — Slash command that builds the project and runs integration smoke tests against the live server. Use this after any bug fix to confirm the fix works end-to-end.
- **`npm run test:integration`** — Runs all integration tests (requires `.env` with `COOLIFY_URL` and `COOLIFY_TOKEN`).
- Integration test files live in `src/__tests__/integration/` and are excluded from `npm test` (CI). Add new smoke tests there when fixing bugs that involve API interaction.

### Coolify API Gotchas

The Coolify OpenAPI docs are unreliable — always test against the real API. Known issues:

- **`docker_compose_raw` requires base64** — The API expects base64-encoded YAML, but the field name suggests raw content. The client auto-encodes this field so models and callers can pass plain YAML.
- **Validation errors vary in format** — The `errors` field in API error responses can contain `string[]` or plain `string` values. The client handles both.
- **Env var field names are `is_buildtime` and `is_runtime`** (one word each), not `is_build_time` (two words). On `POST /applications/{uuid}/envs` and `PATCH /applications/{uuid}/envs` the wrong name returns HTTP 422 `"This field is not allowed."`; on `PATCH /applications/{uuid}/envs/bulk` the wrong name is silently ignored (request returns 201 but the flag stays at the default). Verified against Coolify v4.0.0-beta.473 in #174 / #135. When adding env-var related code or tests, mirror the API field names exactly — do not paraphrase to `is_build_time`.
