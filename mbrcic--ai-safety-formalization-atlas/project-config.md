# Contributor and Agent Guidance

Read this file before an autonomous change. Live phase: [`STATE.md`](STATE.md).
Agent map: [`docs/agent/INDEX.md`](docs/agent/INDEX.md). Human doc map:
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md). Methodology:
[`docs/guide/methodology.md`](docs/guide/methodology.md).

## Start

For a change, run `python3 scripts/preflight.py`, then read only the policies it
identifies. The script advises; [`scripts/agent_gate.sh`](scripts/agent_gate.sh)
performs the mechanical validation.
