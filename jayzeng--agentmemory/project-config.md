# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/core.ts`: all logic — paths, truncation, scratchpad, context builder, qmd integration, standalone tool functions (`memoryWrite`, `memoryRead`, `scratchpadAction`, `memorySearch`)
- `src/cli.ts`: CLI entry point — subcommands (context/write/read/scratchpad/search/init/status), compiles to `dist/agent-memory` binary
- `skills/claude-code/SKILL.md`: Claude Code skill file
- `skills/codex/SKILL.md`: Codex skill file
- `skills/cursor/SKILL.md`: Cursor skill file
- `skills/agent/SKILL.md`: Agent (Cursor CLI) skill file
- `test/unit.test.ts`, `test/cli.test.ts`: unit tests (bun:test)
- `README.md`: user-facing install/usage docs

Runtime data lives outside the repo under the memory directory:
- Default: `~/.agent-memory/` (configurable via `AGENT_MEMORY_DIR`)

Files: `MEMORY.md`, `SCRATCHPAD.md`, `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Activity Tracking (Required)

- Track all work sessions by writing a short entry to the daily log using `agent-memory write --target daily`.
- Summaries should include what changed, files touched, and any notable decisions.
- Use the scratchpad tool for follow-ups or TODOs discovered during work.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `bun run build:cli`: compile CLI binary to `dist/agent-memory`
- `npm run build:lib`: emit `dist/` library build via `tsc`
- `npm run build`: typecheck with `tsc` (`--noEmit`)
- `npm run lint`: lint with Biome
- `bun test test/unit.test.ts` or `npm run test:unit`: run unit tests (no LLM/qmd needed)
- `bun test test/cli.test.ts` or `npm run test:cli`: run CLI unit tests
- `bash scripts/install-skills.sh` or `npm run install-skills`: install SKILL.md files for Claude Code and Codex
- Optional (for `memory_search`, requires Bun): `command -v qmd >/dev/null 2>&1 || bun install -g https://github.com/tobi/qmd`
- Optional search setup: `agent-memory init` (auto-creates qmd collection); run `qmd embed` once for semantic/deep search

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- `src/core.ts` has zero external dependencies: only `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:child_process`.
- Match existing formatting: tabs for indentation, semicolons, and double quotes.
- Naming: `camelCase` for functions, `PascalCase` for types, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants; tool names remain `snake_case` (e.g. `memory_write`).

## Testing Guidelines

- Tests touch memory directories; ensure backups/restores remain intact and new tests don't leak user data.
- Unit tests use temp directories via `_setBaseDir()` — no real memory files.
- Prefer behavior-focused assertions (file contents, cross-session recall). Keep timeouts generous for model latency.

## Pre-Commit Checklist (Required)

Before every `git add`, `commit`, and `push`, you **must** run and verify all pass:

1. `bun test test/unit.test.ts` — unit tests
2. `bun test test/cli.test.ts` — CLI tests
3. `bun run lint` — Biome linting and formatting
4. `bun run build` — TypeScript type-checking

Do not commit or push if any of the above fail. Fix issues first.

## Changelog (Required)

- Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` at the project root.
- For every version bump, add an entry documenting Added, Changed, Fixed, and Removed sections as applicable.
- Review local + committed git changes (`git log`, `git diff`) to draft accurate changelog entries.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`) and keep messages imperative.
- PRs: include a short summary, exact test command(s) run, and call out any changes to on-disk memory formats or `qmd` behavior.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- `AGENT_MEMORY_DIR` controls the memory directory (default: `~/.agent-memory`).
- `AGENT_MEMORY_QMD_UPDATE` controls qmd updates after writes (`background`, `manual`, `off`). `PI_MEMORY_QMD_UPDATE` is a legacy fallback.
- Never commit real memory files or secrets.

## Skills

A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.

### Available skills

- agent-memory: Persistent memory across coding sessions — long-term facts, daily logs, topic notes, scratchpad checklist, and semantic search. (file: /Users/jay/.agents/skills/agent-memory/SKILL.md)
- agent-memory: Persistent memory across coding sessions — long-term facts, daily logs, topic notes, scratchpad checklist, and semantic search. (file: /Users/jay/.codex/skills/agent-memory/SKILL.md)
- algorithmic-art: Creating algorithmic art using p5.js with seeded randomness and interactive parameter exploration. Use this when users request creating art using code, generative art, algorithmic art, flow fields, or particle systems. Create original algorithmic art rather than copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright violations. (file: /Users/jay/.codex/skills/algorithmic-art/SKILL.md)
