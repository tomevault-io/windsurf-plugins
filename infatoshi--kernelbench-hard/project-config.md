# KernelBench-Hard — Cursor rules

See CLAUDE.md for the full developer instructions. This file is the cursor-rules view of the same rules.

## Non-negotiable

- uv only. `uv run`, `uv add`, `uv pip install`. Never `pip` or bare `python`.
- Lint + test before commit: `uv run ruff check . --fix && uv run pytest`.
- Never edit `problems/*/solution.py` — they are gitignored agent output.
- Never modify `reference.py`, `check.py`, `benchmark.py`, or `problem.yaml` of an already-published problem. Changing these invalidates prior results.
- Run `./scripts/patch_torch.sh` after every `uv sync` (torch 2.11 inductor CSE typing bug).

## Repo layout

- `problems/NN_name/` — each self-contained: reference.py, sota.py, shapes.py, problem.yaml, check.py, benchmark.py, AGENT.md.
- `src/harness/` — CLI adapters (claude, codex, kimi, ccr_router).
- `src/eval/` — correctness, roofline math, reporting.
- `src/hardware/` — peak throughput lookup per GPU.
- `scripts/` — run_hard.sh, sweep.sh, roofline_plot.py, patch_torch.sh.
- `outputs/runs/` — gitignored.

## Adding a problem

1. Create `problems/NN_name/` with the 7 required files (see CLAUDE.md).
2. Write files in order: reference.py → shapes.py → problem.yaml → sota.py → check.py → benchmark.py → AGENT.md.
3. Smoke-test with `./scripts/run_hard.sh claude claude-opus-4-7 problems/NN_name` before sweeping.

## Do not

- Spoil the AGENT.md (no code, just links to papers/repos).
- Add custom tools / MCP to the harness invocations — we measure CLIs as they ship.
- Weaken tolerance or drop shapes to make results look better.
