# AGENTS.md — RawDuck design guide

Orientation for LLMs, agents and developers continuing RawDuck. Read this before changing code.

## What RawDuck is

A DuckDB extension implementing the RawMergeTree concept (loosely inspired by the design
described at rawtree.com — keep mentions of that project to this single reference):
**ingest schema-less JSON first, let the schema emerge**. The core bet: eagerly *shred* JSON into
real typed columns at ingest (one-time cost) so every query runs at native columnar speed —
instead of storing opaque JSON strings and paying `->>` extraction on every scan (45–265× slower,
see BENCHMARK.md).

Pinned to DuckDB **v1.5.3**: the `duckdb/` submodule commit and the versions in
`.github/workflows/MainDistributionPipeline.yml` must stay in sync. Build with `GEN=ninja make
release`; test with `./build/release/test/unittest --test-dir . "test/sql/*"`; format with
`make format-fix` (CI enforces it).

## Source map (src/)

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `raw_json.cpp/.hpp` | **Pure, context-free core**: payload parsing (JSON/NDJSON), schema inference tree (`RawNode`), type lattice, flattening, multi-level explode transform, vectorized extraction (`RawExtractor` + `FillVector`). Never touches `ClientContext` — this is what makes parse threads safe. |
| `raw_records.cpp` | `raw_records()` table function; shared named-parameter handling (`RawBindParseOptions`). |
| `raw_ingest.cpp` | `RawIngestor` (native catalog/storage ingestion + DuckLake SQL fallback), `RawAppendPool` (multi-threaded appends), `RawIngestPipeline` (background parse thread), `raw_ingest()` / `raw_ingest_file()`. |
| `raw_optimize.cpp` | Optimizer hooks (predicate/group observation, projection rewrite), `raw_stats()`, `raw_optimize()`, `raw_projections()`, `raw_project()`, `raw_stats_save/load()`. |
| `raw_transforms.cpp` | User-defined transform registry, `raw_transform_define()` scalar, `raw_transforms()`. |
| `raw_attach.cpp` | `ATTACH 'rawduck:...'` storage extension (`RawDuckCatalog : DuckCatalog`). |
| `raw_scalars.cpp` | `raw_type()`, `raw_infer()`. |
| `raw_async.cpp` | Opt-in async inserts: per-table buffers + background flusher owned by an `ObjectCache` entry (joins on teardown; `weak_ptr` database guard; fire-and-forget semantics — `raw_flush()` is the synchronous drain). |
| `raw_api.cpp` | `raw_serve()` / `raw_serve_stop()`: in-process HTTP API on DuckDB's vendored `duckdb_httplib`. |

## Design invariants — do not break these

1. **The type lattice widens monotonically, never destructively.**
   `BOOLEAN | BIGINT→DOUBLE | DATE→TIMESTAMP` → scalar conflicts sink to `VARCHAR`; structural
   conflicts (object vs scalar, mixed arrays) sink to `JSON`. Nothing is ever dropped; widening is
   `ALTER ... SET DATA TYPE`, with `to_json()` for JSON rewrites (a plain VARCHAR→JSON cast rejects
   bare strings).

2. **Native ingestion runs in the caller's transaction.** DDL goes through
   `Catalog::CreateTable`/`Alter`, appends through `DataTable::LocalAppend` / optimistic
   collections. **Never run the INSERT through a second `Connection` while the calling query is
   executing** — concurrent transactions disable DuckDB's optimistic appends (~20× slower; this was
   v0.1's mistake). The second-connection SQL path exists *only* as the fallback for non-duck
   catalogs (DuckLake), which can't share the caller's transaction anyway.
   Catalog writes from inside a table function require
   `MetaTransaction::Get(context).ModifyDatabase(...)` first.

3. **Parse/inference is thread-pure; context work stays on the main thread.** The parse pipeline
   thread and append-pool workers only call `raw_json` code plus thread-confined storage objects
   (`OptimisticDataWriter`, per-worker `RowGroupCollection`). Anything touching `ClientContext`,
   the catalog, or `LocalAppend`/`LocalMerge` happens on the executing thread.

4. **Pool evolution is drain-free and barrier-free.** The consumer publishes new columns to an
   append-only list; each worker pads its own collection to the published prefix via
   `RowGroupCollection::AddColumn` (metadata-only NULL columns). Worker layouts must remain a
   prefix of the table layout (merges are positional); flush writers must be rebuilt against the
   CURRENT storage at drain (compression metadata and per-column partial block managers must match
   the evolved layout); the merge target must be the current catalog entry (ALTER swaps the
   storage object). Only type widening drains the pool.

5. **Extraction is row-major.** Each row's JSON tree is traversed once and values are routed to
   column slots via schema-tree node identity (`RawExtractor`). Do not reintroduce per-column path
   walks (`yyjson_obj_getn` per column was the v0.1 hotspot: rows are sparse, schemas are wide).

6. **Projection rewriting must never return stale or differently-typed results.** The
   `pre_optimize` hook only rewrites `PROJECTION→AGGREGATE(count(*))→GET` when: the group set
   matches a registered projection exactly, the scan has no filters, the base table's
   `GetTotalRows()` equals the staleness token recorded at `raw_project` time, and the parent's
   colrefs are plain. The rewrite is `CAST(sum(count) AS BIGINT)` so result types are identical.
