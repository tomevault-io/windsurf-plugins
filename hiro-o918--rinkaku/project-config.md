Project-specific instructions for working on rinkaku.

## Project overview

rinkaku (輪郭, "outline") is a CLI that condenses large PR diffs —
especially LLM-generated ones — into just the **signatures of changed
symbols and their dependencies**, so reviewers and LLMs can grasp the API
surface of a change without reading every implementation line.

- Input: a unified diff via stdin (`gh pr diff 123 | rinkaku`), or
  `rinkaku --base main` (runs `git diff` internally).
- Core: tree-sitter parses changed files, finds the definitions
  containing changed lines, and slices out their signatures.
- Dependency expansion: 1-hop references via tree-sitter tags queries
  (v1). LSP-based resolvers (pyright, gopls, etc.) are pluggable later
  via a `Resolver` trait.
- Built-in languages: Rust, Go, Python, TypeScript, and HCL (Terraform), each implemented
  as a `LanguageSupport` trait impl (grammar crate + tags query +
  signature-slicing rule), making language support additive.
- Output: Markdown or JSON, designed to be fed to LLMs.

Design rationale for the choices above is recorded in
[`docs/adr/`](docs/adr).

## Architecture principles

- **Flat module structure**: start simple, split into submodules only
  when a group of files sharing a responsibility grows large enough to
  warrant it. Do not pre-create deep module hierarchies.
- **Core logic is pure**: no IO, no wall clock, no environment variable
  reads inside `rinkaku-core`'s domain logic. Diff input, file reads,
  process invocations (`git`, future LSP servers) belong at the boundary
  (`main.rs` and future adapter modules), passed in as arguments or via
  ports.
- **Ports as traits, defined on the consumer side**: `LanguageSupport`
  (tree-sitter grammar + tags query + signature slicing per language) and
  `Resolver` (dependency resolution strategy) are traits defined where
  they are consumed, not where they are implemented. Keep them small
  (1-3 methods).
- **Composition root in `main.rs`**: dependency wiring (which
  `LanguageSupport` impls are registered, which `Resolver` is used) is
  assembled by hand in `main.rs`. No DI framework, no global state,
  no `init()`-time wiring.
- Do not introduce a shared/common abstraction (e.g. a generic repository
  layer over language support or resolvers) speculatively — only after a
  concrete second use case demands it, and after discussing it in an ADR.

## Test strategy

- **rstest + pretty_assertions**, unit tests live in-module
  (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the bottom of the file under test).
- Test/case names follow `should_<behavior>_when_<condition>`.
- **Compare whole structs/values, not individual fields.** Use
  `pretty_assertions::assert_eq!` on the complete expected value. If a
  partial comparison is unavoidable, leave a comment at the top of the
  test explaining why.
- **No mocking of external processes** (git, tree-sitter parses, future
  LSP servers). Extract the pure transformation logic into a function
  that takes plain data in and returns plain data out, and unit-test
  that. Reserve integration-style tests (using real fixtures under
  `resources/` or `tempfile::TempDir`) for the adapter boundary itself.
- **When a test module grows large, split it by topic**, not by
  mechanical top/bottom cut: sibling in-module `mod`s, or
  `#[cfg(test)] #[path = "..."] mod tests;` files under a `*_tests/`
  directory (ADR 0028). Don't let one file's tests grow into a single
  monolithic block. Precedents: PR #93 (`rinkaku-core`) and PR #95
  (`rinkaku-tui`).
- Run `make test` before committing; it must pass together with
  `make lint`.

## Reviewing changes (dogfooding)

When reviewing a branch or PR of this repository (directly or via
review subagents) at the **large** tier of the "Process weight"
section below, cover **three complementary angles** — see
[`docs/experiments/0001-map-assisted-llm-review/`](docs/experiments/0001-map-assisted-llm-review/README.md)
for why:

1. **Map-assisted pass**: generate rinkaku's own output for the diff
   (`rinkaku --base main`, built from a **trusted `main` checkout**,
   never from the branch under review) and use its high fan-in symbols,
   contract markers, and entry-point trees to pick deep-reading targets —
   this pass is best at integration seams and architecture-level
   defects.
2. **Independent pass**: a plain review without the map, covering
   line-level correctness and repo conventions (assert style, no
   library-code `unwrap`/`expect`, comment discipline).
3. **Dynamic verification** (mandatory, not left to reviewer
   discretion): build and actually execute the changed surface,
   including failure-mode invocations — non-TTY stdin/stdout, empty
   input, conflicting flags, missing files. Experiment 0001 round 2's
   best finding (a non-TTY panic) came from an *uninstructed* decision
   to run the binary; do not rely on that luck. Either reviewing pass
   may carry this step, but someone must.

The map allocates attention; it is not a verifier. Behavioral bugs do
not show up on the signature surface, so neither pass may skip reading
the code it flags — and none of the three angles may be skipped.

## Process weight

Match the process to the size and risk of the change; not every PR
