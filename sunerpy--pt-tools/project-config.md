# `tools/browser-extension/` — PT Tools Helper Extension

## Role

The MV3 companion extension recognizes tracker pages, reads permitted cookies, captures/sanitizes site metadata, syncs credentials/activity to pt-tools, and surfaces login-state reminders and pending actions.

## Layout

```text
tools/browser-extension/
├── src/manifest.ts              # Permissions, host permissions, build metadata
├── src/background/index.ts      # Runtime messaging and sync orchestration
├── src/content/index.ts         # Page-side collection entrypoint
├── src/core/
│   ├── constants.ts             # KNOWN_SITES and domain/schema metadata
│   ├── storage.ts / types.ts    # Persisted settings and contracts
│   ├── permissions.ts           # Optional-host permission handling
│   └── messages.ts              # Cross-context message protocol
├── src/modules/
│   ├── collector/               # Detect/capture/sanitize tracker metadata
│   ├── sync/                    # pt-tools HTTP client, cookies, errors
│   └── export/                  # ZIP/GitHub export helpers
└── src/popup/                    # Vue popup and login-status/settings panels
```

## Site Synchronization

Go definitions and extension `KNOWN_SITES` are a checked invariant. When adding or changing a site:

1. Update `src/core/constants.ts` with the ID, domains, schema, and display metadata.
2. Keep optional host permissions consistent with supported domains.
3. Run `make check-sites`; extension packaging fails on ID drift.
4. Add detection/sanitization fixture tests when markup behavior changes.

Do not add an extension-only built-in site without a Go definition.

## Security

- Request only the narrow host/cookie permissions needed for enabled sites.
- Never send tracker cookies anywhere except the user-configured pt-tools endpoint.
- Sanitize captured HTML/metadata before persistence/export.
- Do not log cookies, bearer tokens, API keys, or full authenticated URLs.
- Treat the pt-tools base URL and credentials as untrusted input; use the shared timeout/error helpers.
- Keep background/content/popup messages typed and validate incoming actions.

## API and Login Monitoring

`modules/sync/api-client.ts` is the backend boundary. Keep paths and DTOs aligned with `web/api_credential.go`, `web/api_site_login.go`, and extension-action routes. Manual probe and visit reporting must preserve the backend's per-site single-flight behavior and handle conflict responses without retry storms.

## Validation

```bash
make check-sites
pnpm --dir tools/browser-extension typecheck
pnpm --dir tools/browser-extension test
pnpm --dir tools/browser-extension build
make build-extension
```

The extension version is sourced from `package.json`; do not maintain a second literal in the manifest code.
