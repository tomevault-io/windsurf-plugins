# Book Capture Plugin

Captures book pages from Mac Kindle, Apple Books, Kindle Cloud Reader, or PDF files, then extracts text via OCR and generates structured Obsidian Markdown documents organized by theme.

## Commands

- `/book-capture:capture` — Full pipeline: platform selection → screenshot capture → OCR → structured Markdown
- `/book-capture:kindle` — Capture from Mac Kindle app (source pre-selected)
- `/book-capture:books` — Capture from Apple Books app (source pre-selected)
- `/book-capture:cloud` — Capture from Kindle Cloud Reader via browser (source pre-selected)
- `/book-capture:pdf` — Capture from PDF file (source pre-selected)
- `/book-capture:ocr` — Run OCR on existing page captures (Vision + agent re-reading)
- `/book-capture:generate` — Generate structured Markdown from existing OCR text

## Agents

- `ocr-reader` — Batch multimodal OCR for low-confidence pages (reads images via Read tool)
- `content-writer` — Generates thematic Markdown content from OCR text

## Settings

Per-project settings stored in `.claude/book-capture.local.md` (YAML frontmatter). Auto-detected for Obsidian vaults.

## Dependencies

Scripts in `scripts/` require Node.js 20+ and: `playwright`, `sharp`, `run-applescript`. Run `scripts/setup.sh` to install. macOS Vision OCR requires Xcode Command Line Tools. PDF capture requires Poppler (`brew install poppler`).

## Architecture

- **Commands** define the workflow steps as instructions for Claude Code
- **Scripts** handle system-level tasks (screenshots, OCR, PDF conversion)
- **Agents** perform AI-powered tasks (image reading, content generation) within Claude Code context — no external API keys required
- Kindle Cloud Reader supports multiple regions via `--region` flag (jp, us, uk, de, fr, it, es, ca, au, in, br)
