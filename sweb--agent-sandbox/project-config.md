# Agent Sandbox — Development Notes

A rootless Docker container running `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` against the user's project, wired into the host's `minikube`. You edit files from the host; the agent runs inside the container. End-user docs are in `README.md`.

## Files

- `Dockerfile` — image recipe; parameterized by `UID`/`GID`/`USERNAME` build args
- `run.sh` — host-side launcher; rebuilds image on label drift, mounts `~/.claude`, wires minikube net
- `Makefile` — image management (`build`/`rebuild`/`clean`/`clean-home`/`clean-nix`/`inspect`/`size`/`shell`)

## Design invariants

1. **Container user mirrors host user** — name *and* UID/GID. `run.sh` always passes the host's actual username via `--build-arg USERNAME`. This matters because claude config (plugin marketplaces, MCP server paths, etc.) stores **absolute host paths**; the only way to resolve them inside the container is for `$HOME` to match. The same logic applies to the project bind-mount: the workspace is mounted at its host path rather than a synthetic `/workspace`, so any path the agent prints back to the user is copy-pasteable on the host. `run.sh` refuses to launch if the workspace path equals/contains `$HOME` or sits inside `~/.claude` — those would collide with the home-dir mounts.

2. **`~/.claude` mount split:**
   - Base directory RW — session state, todos, memory, projects, `claude.json`, credentials.
   - `settings.json` RO overlay — contains host hooks, which are executable code the host claude runs. An agent inside the sandbox must not be able to modify them.
   - `plugins/` RO overlay — plugin manifests can declare hooks that the host claude runs, same threat as `settings.json`. Trade-off: marketplace refresh inside the sandbox fails with `EROFS`; refresh from the host instead. Was briefly RW for exactly this reason — closing the hook-injection channel was judged more important than in-sandbox refresh.

3. **kubeconfig rewrite:** `clusters[].cluster.server → https://<profile>:8443`. The container joins the docker network named `<profile>` where the API server is reachable as the hostname `<profile>` on 8443. `<profile>` resolves from `MINIKUBE_PROFILE` env var, else the kubeconfig's `current-context`, else literal `minikube` — minikube uses the same name for profile / docker network / in-network hostname, so one string serves all three roles. Cert paths under `~/.minikube/...` resolve naturally because `$HOME` matches host — *no sed-based path remap is needed* (was needed earlier when container user was `dev`).

4. **Image is per-host-user.** `run.sh` reads labels `sandbox.uid`/`sandbox.gid`/`sandbox.username` and rebuilds on drift, or when `REBUILD=1`. Single tag (`:latest`), per-machine image.

5. **Persistent `$HOME` is a named Docker volume.** `run.sh` mounts `agent-sandbox-home-$HOST_USER` at `$CONTAINER_HOME`. Docker auto-seeds the volume from the image's `/home/$USER` on first use, so build-time installs (`.cargo`, `.rustup`) populate transparently with no Dockerfile refactor. The volume is shared across every `./run.sh` invocation for the same host user (workspace is still per-invocation; only `$HOME` persists). The nested `~/.claude`, `~/.minikube`, `~/.claude.json`, and `$TMP_KUBECONFIG` bind mounts still shadow their paths inside this volume. Image rebuilds do **not** refresh the volume — mirrors host reality (an OS upgrade doesn't auto-rewrite `~/.cargo`); if a Dockerfile bump changes rust/node/etc., run `make clean-home` (or `docker volume rm agent-sandbox-home-$USER`) to pick up the new versions in `$HOME`. Per-cwd `HISTFILE` is configured in `/etc/bash.bashrc` keyed by sha1 of `AGENT_SANDBOX_WORKSPACE` (set by `run.sh`), so parallel sessions in different workspaces don't pollute each other's bash history.

6. **`nix` is single-user; `/nix` is its own named volume.** The operator-development plugin's skill says `nix-shell` is the canonical dev shell — so nix has to work inside the sandbox. Install mode is single-user (no `nix-daemon`, `/nix` owned by the agent user, installer ran without sudo). `sandbox = false` in `/etc/nix/nix.conf` because rootless docker can't provide the user namespaces nix's build sandbox needs — a small reproducibility loss accepted in exchange for working `nix-shell`. `flakes` + `nix-command` are on by default. `/nix` is a per-host-user named volume (`agent-sandbox-nix-$HOST_USER`) with the same auto-seed pattern as `$HOME`: build-time `/nix` seeds the volume on first attach, so closures fetched by `nix-shell` survive sessions instead of re-downloading from `cache.nixos.org` every time. Image rebuilds don't refresh the volume — after a `NIX_VERSION` bump, run `make clean-nix` (and usually `make clean-home` too, since `~/.nix-profile` symlinks live there).

## Build details that bit us

- **`docker build --network=host` is required.** On this host the docker0 bridge crawled at ~55 KB/s to GitHub releases; with host networking it's ~5 MB/s. Both `run.sh` and the `Makefile` set this.
