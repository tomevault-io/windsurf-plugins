# Home Assistant for Omarchy

## Project overview

This repository is an Omarchy 4 Quickshell plugin for viewing and controlling
Home Assistant entities from the desktop bar. The UI is QML with small pure
JavaScript modules. A long-lived Python helper owns the Home Assistant
WebSocket connection and communicates with QML over versioned NDJSON on
stdin/stdout.

Canonical public repository: `https://github.com/konradk/hass`.

The plugin must remain installable without npm, pip, a virtual environment, or
first-run downloads. Python 3.11 or newer, `secret-tool`, and the vendored
`websockets` package are the runtime dependencies.

## Architecture map

- `Service.qml`: session-wide facade and owner of configuration, connection
  reconciliation, entity state, action dispatch, and projected row models.
- `BridgeController.qml`: lifecycle and NDJSON transport for `bin/hass-bridge`.
- `CredentialManager.qml`: serialized access to the system keyring.
- `Connection.js`: URL/origin identity, connection signatures, and generation
  filtering.
- `ConfigStore.js`: persisted configuration normalization and serialization.
- `EntityStore.js`: state and registry indexing and area projections.
- `Model.js`: entity display policy, capabilities, action classification, and
  attribute redaction.
- `RowModel.js`: projection from an entity into a QML `ListModel` row.
- `Panel.qml`: bar widget, popup, keyboard navigation, and IPC surface.
- `Settings.qml`: connection settings and entity picker.
- `controls/`: domain-specific expanded controls.
- `bin/hass-bridge`: WebSocket protocol adapter and demo backend.
- `tests/fake_ha.py`: local fake Home Assistant used by bridge tests.

Keep transport, credential lifecycle, state projection, and UI policy separate.
Prefer extending the existing pure JavaScript modules over adding more policy
to `Service.qml`.

## Security invariants

- Never persist a Home Assistant token in `config.json`, logs, fixtures, process
  arguments, error text, or IPC output. Tokens may travel only through stdin to
  `secret-tool` and the bridge.
- Scope credentials to a normalized server origin. Changing origin must never
  silently reuse a credential. Credential deletion must target an explicit
  origin and must not remove a saved live credential as a side effect of demo
  mode.
- Treat `http://` and `ws://` as plaintext transport. Any UI path that permits
  them must make the token-exposure risk explicit; never downgrade an invalid
  or unknown scheme to plaintext.
- TLS verification, proxy bypass, compression disablement, message limits,
  bounded receive queues, and connection timeouts are deliberate hardening.
  Do not weaken them without an explicit security decision and regression test.
- Keep protocol version and connection generation on every bridge command and
  event. Reject data from old generations before mutating UI state.
- Report `connected` only after authentication, event subscription, and the
  initial state snapshot succeed. Reset reconnect backoff only after the full
  connection is ready, not merely after authentication.
- Bound both process startup and completion for every keyring operation. Clear
  plaintext token properties on every success, failure, timeout, and cancel
  path.
- Render Home Assistant-controlled strings as plain text. Debug/IPC output must
  pass through explicit redaction and must not expose location or signed media
  attributes.
- Use argument arrays for `Process`; do not introduce shell interpolation for
  URLs, entity IDs, paths, or secrets.

## Coding conventions

- Keep JavaScript helpers side-effect free where practical and compatible with
  the QML JavaScript engine. Do not add Node-only APIs to production modules.
- Validate external JSON shapes before indexing or rendering them. Use safe map
  keys or prototype-free maps for server-controlled identifiers.
- Derive actions from `Model.capabilitiesFor`; do not expose arbitrary Home
  Assistant service calls through UI or IPC.
- Keep high-frequency `state_changed` handling incremental. Avoid copying or
  rebuilding the entire entity collection for a known entity update.
- Use `Style` and `Color` tokens in QML. Every `Text` must set
  `textFormat: Text.PlainText` and an explicit font family.
- Sliders should send commands on release rather than on every movement.
- Do not edit `vendor/websockets` directly. Dependency updates go through
  `scripts/update-websockets-vendor` after version, hash, license, release-note,
  and advisory review.
- Preserve public IPC commands and the NDJSON protocol unless a versioned
  migration is part of the task.

## Verification

Run the checks relevant to the files changed. Before handing off a broad or
security-sensitive change, run the full suite:

```bash
PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 tests/test_bridge.py
python3 tests/test_vendor.py
python3 tests/test_service_contract.py
python3 tests/test_qml_style.py
node tests/test_config.js
node tests/test_connection.js
node tests/test_store.js
node tests/test_model.js
node tests/test_row_model.js
python3 -m py_compile bin/hass-bridge tests/*.py
bash -n scripts/update-websockets-vendor
```

When available, also run `qmllint`, `qmlformat` in check/read-only mode, and
