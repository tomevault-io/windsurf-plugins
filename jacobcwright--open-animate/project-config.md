# CLAUDE.md — oanim (open-animate)

## Rules

1. **Use subagents for research.** When looking up Remotion APIs, fal.ai docs, or any external reference, spawn a subagent (Explore or general-purpose) instead of doing inline research. Keep the main context focused on implementation.

2. **Update progress.md and prd.json after each task.** When completing work:
   - Append a dated entry to `progress.md` describing what was done
   - Update the relevant ticket(s) in `prd.json` — set `status` to `"done"`, add notes if needed
   - Add new tickets to `prd.json` for any follow-up work discovered

3. **Build before committing.** Always run `pnpm build` and verify it succeeds before committing. The core package must produce valid DTS output (no TypeScript errors in declaration generation).

4. **Remotion type constraints.** `TransitionPresentation<T>` requires `T extends Record<string, unknown>`. Any props interfaces for transitions must use `extends Record<string, unknown>`. This was a real build failure — don't repeat it.

5. **Test against real Remotion.** When adding or modifying @oanim/core components, verify they work in at least one example project (`examples/hello-world` or `examples/launch-video`) by checking `npx remotion studio` opens.

6. **Keep the CLI thin.** The `oanim` CLI wraps Remotion's own tooling — it does not reimplement rendering. `oanim render` shells to `npx remotion render` with config from `animate.json`.

7. **No JSX in .ts files.** Remotion components use React.createElement() in `.ts` files or JSX in `.tsx` files. The core package uses `React.createElement()` throughout for maximum compatibility. Keep this consistent.

8. **Workspace topology matters.** Both `packages/*` and `examples/*` are in the pnpm workspace. Examples reference `@oanim/core` as `workspace:*`. This means `pnpm install` at root links them automatically.

## What is oanim

Open-source CLI + component library + agent skill for creating React motion graphics via Remotion and exporting MP4.

**Key architecture:** Remotion skills teach the agent *how to write Remotion code*. oanim teaches the agent *how to compose premium motion graphics quickly* via a presets library, shared components, and a workflow CLI.

## Platform Vision

oanim is evolving into an **open-core platform** (Supabase model — all open source, monetize via hosted cloud). Users can self-host everything for free or use the hosted version and pay.

### Current state (v0.1)
- **@oanim/core** — animation presets, transitions, typography, UI components, design tokens
- **oanim CLI** — `init`, `render`, `assets` (via platform media gateway)
- **skills/open-animate/** — agent skill with references + templates
- **6 working examples** — hello-world, launch-video, logo-reveal, meme-caption, explainer, investor-update

### Planned platform additions
- **Auth:** `oanim login` → browser OAuth → `~/.oanim/credentials.yaml`. API key resolution: explicit param > `ANIMATE_API_KEY` env > credentials file > direct provider key fallback.
- **Media gateway:** Multi-provider routing (fal.ai backend, Runway, future providers). Usage metering, cost controls (`ANIMATE_MAX_USD_PER_RUN`). Like Vercel AI Gateway but for media generation.
- **Cloud rendering:** `oanim render --cloud` sends composition to hosted infra, streams back MP4.

```

## Build & Dev

```bash
pnpm install              # install all workspace deps
pnpm build                # build core + cli
```

### Console (dashboard)
```bash
cd packages/console
npm run dev               # next dev → localhost:3100
npm run build             # production build
npm run test              # vitest
```

### Link CLI globally for testing
```bash
cd packages/cli && pnpm link --global
```

### Run examples
```bash
cd examples/hello-world
