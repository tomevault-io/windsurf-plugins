# MCP Subagent Server - Handover Document

This document provides a high-level overview for engineers new to the `mcp-server-subagent` project.

## 1. Purpose & Overview

This MCP server enables a planning agent to delegate tasks to CLI-based executor sub-agents. It manages sub-agent execution, status tracking, logging, and result/summary reporting via MCP tools.

## 2. Core Architecture & Flow

- **Technology**: Node.js, TypeScript, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- **Main Logic**: `src/index.ts` orchestrates sub-agent definitions and serves as the main entry point. MCP tool handlers and core functions for process spawning, logging, status management, and their related schemas are now modularized under `src/tools/` (see `src/tools/run.ts`, `src/tools/status.ts`, `src/tools/logs.ts`, `src/tools/schemas.ts`, and the bi-directional communication tools in `src/tools/askParent.ts`, `src/tools/replySubagent.ts`, `src/tools/checkMessage.ts`).
- **Execution**: Spawns sub-agents as child processes. Stdout/stderr are logged to timestamped files in `logs/`. A `.meta.json` file per run tracks ID, command, status, times, exit code, and a summary. The metadata file also stores bi-directional communication messages with statuses like "waiting_parent_reply", "parent_replied", and "acknowledged_by_subagent".
- **Key MCP Tools Exposed**:
  - `run_subagent_<name>`: Starts a sub-agent.
  - `check_subagent_status`: Gets run metadata (including status & summary) for a given run. Requires only `runId`.
  - `get_subagent_logs`: Retrieves raw logs for a given run. Requires only `runId`.
  - `update_subagent_status`: Allows external updates to status and summary for a given run. Requires `runId` and `status`.
  - **Bi-directional Communication Tools**:
    - `ask_parent`: Enables sub-agents to ask questions to parent agents during execution. Creates messages with unique IDs and sets status to "waiting_parent_reply".
    - `reply_subagent`: Enables parents to reply to specific sub-agent questions using message IDs.
    - `check_message_status`: Allows sub-agents to poll for replies and automatically acknowledges received answers.
- **Error Handling**: Sub-agent CLI failures (non-zero exit) automatically set status to "error" and populate the summary with the last 50 log lines. Input validation via Zod.

## 2.1. Bi-directional Communication System

The server implements a message passing system that allows sub-agents to ask questions during execution and receive guidance from parent agents:

- **Message Flow**: Sub-agents use `ask_parent` → Parents see questions in status checks → Parents use `reply_subagent` → Sub-agents poll with `check_message_status`
- **Message States**: Messages progress through states: `pending_parent_reply` → `parent_replied` → `acknowledged_by_subagent`
- **Status Integration**: When sub-agents ask questions, their status changes to "waiting_parent_reply" and parents see formatted question details in status output
- **Schema Design**: The `MetaFileContentSchema` includes a `messages` array storing `CommunicationMessage` objects with unique IDs, timestamps, and status tracking
- **User Guidance**: Status output includes helpful notes recommending `sleep 60` between polls to avoid overwhelming the system

## 3. Development & Testing

- **Build**: `npm run build` (compiles TypeScript to `build/`).
- **Testing**: `npm test` (runs Vitest, `*.spec.ts` files in `src/`).
  - Test agents (e.g., for echoing or intentional failures) are defined and instantiated directly within test files (e.g., `src/test.spec.ts`) using the `SubagentConfig` interface. This keeps production subagent configurations in `src/index.ts` clean and avoids modifying shared state during tests.
  - Tests directly call exported functions from `src/index.ts` (or more commonly, the refactored tool functions from `src/tools/*.ts` directly).
  - Comprehensive bi-directional communication tests in `src/communication.spec.ts` cover the full ask→reply→check cycle, message state transitions, and edge cases.
- **Local Run**: `npm start` (or `npm run dev` for watch mode).
- **Adding Production Sub-agents**: Modify the `SUBAGENTS` object in `src/index.ts`.

### Task Completion & Testing

- **Mandatory Testing:** Before any development task (new feature, refactor, bug fix) is considered complete, all project tests MUST be executed.
- **Passing State:** The task is only complete if all tests pass. If tests fail, the issues MUST be addressed and tests re-run until they pass.
- **Test Command:** The standard command for running tests is `npm test`.

### Git Commit Workflow

1.  **Task Completion:** Once a logical unit of work is considered complete (including all verifications like passing tests), a Git commit should be initiated by the assistant.
2.  **Propose Commit:** The assistant will propose creating a Git commit for the completed unit of work.
3.  **If Commit Confirmed:**
    a. Run `git status` to confirm the changed files.
    b. The assistant will identify and propose the set of files related to the completed logical unit of work to be included in the commit. The user will confirm or adjust this set.
