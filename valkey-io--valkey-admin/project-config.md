# AGENTS.md

Keep this file minimal because it is always loaded into agent context.

- Preserve user changes. Do not revert or overwrite unrelated dirty files unless explicitly asked.
- Keep changes scoped to the requested behavior.
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` only when repository architecture, contribution rules, or coding conventions are relevant to the task.
- Read the relevant `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` file only when working in that area.
