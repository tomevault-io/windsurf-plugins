# Claude Marketing

A marketing co-founder for any project, powered by Claude Code.

## What This Is

A plug-and-play marketing system for Claude Code. Drop it into any project and get:
- 29 expert marketing skills (cold email, SEO, social content, CRO, launch strategy, etc.)
- 51 CLI tools for marketing platforms (Apollo, HubSpot, Instantly, Buffer, etc.)
- Ready-to-use slash commands (`/marketing`, `/content-batch`, `/cold-emails`, `/crm`)
- Cold email templates, content calendar structure, pipeline tracking
- Product marketing context framework that all skills reference

## How to Use

### 1. Set Up Your Product Context
Run `/setup-context` or manually create `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in your project. This captures your product, audience, positioning, and voice. All marketing skills reference it automatically.

### 2. Run Marketing Commands
| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/setup-context` | Create your product marketing context (run this first) |
| `/marketing` | Execute today's highest-priority marketing task |
| `/content-batch` | Generate a full week of social content |
| `/cold-emails` | Write cold email sequences |
| `/crm` | Manage your sales pipeline |
| `/launch` | Plan a product launch |
| `/seo` | Run an SEO audit |

### 3. Use Marketing Skills
Skills are loaded automatically when relevant. You can also reference them directly:
- "Write a cold email for my SaaS product" → uses `cold-email` skill
- "Create social content for this week" → uses `social-content` skill
- "Audit my landing page for conversions" → uses `page-cro` skill
