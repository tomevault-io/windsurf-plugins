# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents (and humans) working in this repository. Keep it
short; the README and `docs/` cover usage in depth.

## What this is

voxigo is a WebRTC-native, audio-first conversational-AI framework for Go — a
port of [Pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat). Library code lives at
the module root; runnable bots live in `examples/`.

## Build, test, lint

The default build is **cgo-free**: `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...` works. The
resampler and Opus encoder are pure Go, and the native runtimes (ONNX Runtime
for VAD/turn, RNNoise for denoising) are bound through `ebitengine/purego` —
loaded at run time from their shared libraries, with no C toolchain at build
time. The only cgo in the tree is the optional, higher-quality libsoxr and
libopus backends, compiled in only when you build with their tag:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y libsoxr-dev   # for -tags libsoxr
sudo apt-get install -y libopus-dev   # for -tags libopus
```

- `go build ./...` — build everything with the pure-Go / purego defaults.
- `go test ./...` — run tests. Add `-race` as CI does.
- `go build -tags libsoxr ./...` — opt into libsoxr resampling (SoX Resampler,
  highest quality; the default is the pure-Go `github.com/gojargo/go-resample`
  converter). Needs cgo.
- `go build -tags libopus ./...` — opt into the C Opus encoder (better speech;
  the default is the pure-Go SILK encoder). Needs cgo.
- The **ONNX Runtime** and **RNNoise** shared libraries are located at run time.
  Point at non-standard installs with `VOXIGO_ONNXRUNTIME_LIB` and
  `VOXIGO_RNNOISE_LIB`.

Formatting and lint are enforced by **golangci-lint** (`.golangci.yml`):

- `golangci-lint run` — the full linter set; CI fails on any finding.
- `golangci-lint fmt` — apply the configured formatters (`gofmt -s`, `gofumpt`,
  `goimports`). Code must be clean under all three.

Everything above is a one-liner and stays here. Anything longer lives in the
[`Makefile`](Makefile), which the workflows call for the steps they share, so a
CI failure can be reproduced locally. `make help` lists the targets; the ones
worth knowing:

- `make build-matrix`: compile all five cgo tag combinations, as CI does.
- `make cover`: the coverage run and its total, the profile CI uploads. It
  measures across the whole module, because a package is often covered by the
  tests of the one that drives it, and measuring package by package reads as
  untested code that is not. Codecov applies the `ignore:` rules in
  `codecov.yml` (`examples/`, generated protobuf), so the total it reports reads
  roughly 9 points above the local one. Break it down with `make cover-func` or
  `make cover-html`.
- `make generate`: regenerate the Riva protobuf clients with pinned tool
  versions. CI runs `make generate-check` and fails if the tree is stale.
- `make docs-check`: build the site and fail on unresolved documentation links.
- `make deps`, `make deps-onnx`, `make deps-rnnoise`: install the cgo headers
  and the two native runtimes above. The last two need no root: they install
  under `.native/` and print the `VOXIGO_*_LIB` values to export.
- `make vuln`, `make secrets`: the govulncheck and gitleaks scans CI gates on.

## Conventions

- **No upstream references in code.** Keep Pipecat/Python out of `.go` comments;
  attribution lives only in `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and `README.md`. No per-file
  copyright headers.
- **Config is explicit.** Library packages read no environment variables: take a
  plain `Config` struct and validate it with go-playground `validate` tags.
  Prefer structs over functional options. Env/flags/Viper belong in the app
  (see `examples/`), not the library.
- **Commits** follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, …).
- Record notable changes in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). The project is in
  `0.0.x`: the public API is unstable and may change in any release.

## Layout

- `frames/`, `pipeline/`, `processor/`: the streaming engine.
- `transport/`: Pion WebRTC, plus WebSocket/telephony and LiveKit.
- `service/` + `provider/`: STT/LLM/TTS/S2S interfaces and their providers.
- `audio/`: Opus, resampling, mixing, VAD and Smart Turn analyzers.
- `processor/turns`, `processor/aggregators`, `processor/rtvi`: turn-taking,
  conversation context, RTVI.
- `observers/`, `telemetry/`: frame observers, metrics and tracing.
- `docs/`: the documentation sources; `website/` is the Hugo site that renders
  them (see `website/hugo.toml`). Edit `docs/`, never a copy.
