# dsh-custom-plugin

Standalone convenience suite for the DeepSeek Harness (DSH) Web GUI:
personalization (appearance, weather FX, glass), a per-user-message timeline
rail, project folders, prompts, conversation export, Mermaid rendering, quote
reply, and DeepSeek balance / daily token usage.

## Package rules

- The host half lives in `src/` and the browser half in `src/client/`;
  `src/protocol.ts` carries the JSON wire types shared by both sides.
- The browser half talks to the host through the `/api/custom-plugin` fetch
  routes; styles are injected through one owned style element
  (`src/client/styles.ts`) with plain CSS (no CSS Modules, no `:global`
  wrappers).
- UI copy is plain Chinese; there is no i18n registration.
- `src/dsh-home.ts`, `src/mount-once.ts`, `src/loopback.ts` are standalone
  utility modules kept in-tree so the package builds standalone.
- The Host state file is `$DSH_HOME/custom-plugin-state.json`.
- The only agent-facing surface is the `custom_plugin_status` tool; the
  plugin never injects system-prompt announcements.
- Run before committing:
  `pnpm typecheck`
  `pnpm test`
  `pnpm build`
