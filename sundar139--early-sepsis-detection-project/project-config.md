# RULES

You are working on a professional machine learning project repository for early sepsis detection

Global rules you must follow in every change:

- Do not use the words "phase", "stage", "step 1", "phase1", "phase_1", "milestone1", or similar in any file names, folder names, module names, scripts, notebooks, config names, branches, or README headings inside the repo.
- Keep everything strictly professional and industry-standard.
- Write full working code only. No TODO stubs, no pseudocode, no fake placeholders.
- Preserve clean modular architecture and production-style naming.
- Keep raw data out of git. Use .gitignore correctly.
- Support the official PhysioNet sepsis dataset and also support an easier local/Kaggle-style CSV path when available.
- Include a tiny synthetic sample dataset for tests and demo only. Do not commit restricted or real clinical source data.
- Every command in the README must be runnable.
- Add or update tests for every meaningful feature.
- Use typed Python where reasonable, structured logging, and robust error handling.
- Keep deployment free-friendly. Public demo must not require paid cloud services.
- Keep local training, experiment tracking, orchestration, and LLM integrations optional and configurable.
- At the end, return:
  1. concise summary of what changed
  2. files added/modified
  3. commands to run
  4. remaining risks or follow-up items
