You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Zustand. Follow best practices in code structure, naming, styling, and performance.

---

Code Style and Structure
- Use functional, declarative React components; avoid class components.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`, `canSubmit`).
- Prefer early returns to reduce nesting and improve readability.
- Use the RORO (Receive an Object, Return an Object) pattern for complex function arguments.
- Minimize repetition by modularizing logic (e.g., extract helpers and utility functions).

---

Component Structure & File Organization
- Each component should live in its own folder:
  - `[Component].tsx`: main file
  - `helpers.ts`: utility functions
  - `types.ts`: local interfaces and types
  - `index.ts`: re-export for cleaner imports
- Structure top-level directories by feature or domain (e.g., `features/auth`, `features/dashboard`).
- Use PascalCase for file and component names.

---

Directory and File Naming
- Use kebab-case for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
- Use PascalCase for component files and exported symbols.
- Favor named exports over default exports for better tooling and readability.

---

TypeScript Usage
- All code must be written in TypeScript.
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for defining object shapes.
- Avoid `enum`; use object literals or `Record<string, string>` for mappings.
- Use strict typing; never use `any`.

---

Naming Conventions
- Event handlers should be prefixed with `handle` (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleSubmit`).
- Boolean variables must start with auxiliary verbs (`is`, `has`, `should`, `can`).
- Hook names must start with `use` (e.g., `useUserStore`, `useFetchData`).

---

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI for all form elements, modals, and standard components.
- Prefer Radix UI icons; avoid third-party icon packs unless justified.
- Style using Tailwind CSS. Default spacing: `p-4`, `gap-4`, `rounded-2xl`, `shadow-md`.
- Use `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg` for font sizes; maintain visual consistency.
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind's mobile-first utilities (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).
- Ensure accessibility: use semantic HTML, `aria-` attributes, and focus states.

---

State Management
- Use Zustand for global state management:
  - Keep stores small and domain-focused.
  - Define state shape using interfaces.
  - Persist state only when needed (e.g., auth token).
- Do not store server-fetched data in global state; use it locally or with React Query.

---

Error Handling & Guard Clauses
- Use guard clauses to exit early from functions or components.
- Define and reuse custom error types for predictable error handling.
- Always check for null, undefined, or unexpected values before proceeding.
- Wrap async functions with try/catch and log context-aware error messages.

---

Performance Optimization
- Limit `'use client'` usage. Use React Server Components (RSC) whenever possible.
- Avoid unnecessary `useEffect` or `useState` calls.
- Dynamically import non-critical components.
- Use `Suspense` with fallbacks for client-side rendering.
- Optimize images: use `next/image`, prefer WebP, and include width/height.

---

Data Fetching
- Use `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, or server components for data fetching.
- Use React Query for caching and background updates.
- Do not fetch data in client components unless interactive.
- Avoid prop drilling; co-locate data where it's used.
