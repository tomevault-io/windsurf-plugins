# Keboola MCP Server - Project Guide

## Contributing Guidelines

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the authoritative contributor guide. It covers:

- **RFC requirement** — when a design doc in `feature_spec/<feature-name>/RFC.md` is required before implementation (new tools, new architectural concepts, new end-to-end behavior), and the required RFC structure
- **Testing requirements** — regression tests for bug fixes, unit + E2E tests for features, and parametrize conventions
- **PR checklist** — the full set of items every PR must address (branch naming, version bump, `uv.lock`, `tox`, RFC link, etc.)

The rules in this file (git workflow, versioning, venv setup) complement `CONTRIBUTING.md` — when the two overlap, `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the source of truth for contributor-facing process. Read it before opening a PR.

## Git Workflow
- **Always create a branch first** before committing changes
- Branch names must start with the Linear issue ID and be short (e.g., `AI-2480-whitelist-n8n-domains`)
  - **Exception:** release branches use `release/vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `release/v1.55.0`) — these have no Linear issue
- Commit messages must **start** with the Linear issue ID (e.g., `AI-2480: description`)
- When working on a Linear task, **check the current branch first** (`git branch`). If not already on the correct task branch, create one before making any changes: `git checkout -b AI-XXXX-short-description`
- When creating PRs, use the template at `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- **Every PR must include a `pyproject.toml` version bump** — bump before merging; see [Versioning](#versioning) for the rules
- **Never use `git push --force`** or rebase commits that have already been pushed - use merge commits instead to avoid rewriting history for others

## Testing
- **All tox checks must pass before pushing** — CI runs the same checks (pytest, black, flake8, check-tools-docs) and will fail the build if any of them fail
- **Use tox** for final testing - it runs pytest, black (formatting), flake8 (linter), and check-tools-docs (verifies TOOLS.md is up-to-date)
- It's OK to use pytest directly for running individual tests during development
- Activate the virtual environment first (e.g., `source <venv>/bin/activate`)
- Run specific tests: `tox -e py310 -- tests/test_file.py -v`
- Run all checks: `tox`
- **Write parameterized tests** (`@pytest.mark.parametrize`) to reduce boilerplate; declare parameter names as a tuple of strings, not a single comma-separated string (e.g. `('a', 'b')` not `'a, b'`)
- **Be careful with mocking** - don't mock too much or tests will just test the mocks, not the real code
- **Extend existing tests instead of adding new ones** - when adding new scenarios (e.g. OAuth bearer token cases), add parameters to an existing parametrized test rather than writing a separate test function; this avoids test bloat and keeps related cases together
- **Only test what's necessary** - add test cases that cover genuinely new behavior, not duplicates of cases already covered by existing parametrize entries

## Virtual Environments
- Look for a venv folder in the project root (e.g., `3.10.venv/`, `.venv/`) that contains an editable install of the project, or ask the user which venv to use
- Activate the venv before running tox or uv commands
- After version bump in `pyproject.toml`, sync lock file: `uv lock` (no `--active` flag — unlike `uv sync`, `uv lock` does not accept it)

## Setting Up a Fresh Clone
Run these steps once after cloning the repository:
```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment (requires Python 3.10)
python3.10 -m venv 3.10.venv

# 2. Activate and install uv
source 3.10.venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip uv

# 3. Sync all dependencies from the lock file
#    --active is required so uv installs into the already-activated venv
uv sync --active --extra dev --extra tests

# 4. Verify everything works
tox
```
All four tox environments (pytest, black, flake8, check-tools-docs) should exit 0.

## Integration Tests

See `integtests/README.md` for setup and conventions.

## Local End-to-End Testing with MCP

For manual end-to-end testing, you can set up a local MCP server in a `.mcp.json` file
in the project root (it is already in `.gitignore`). Point it to the venv's Python
interpreter which has the package installed in editable mode — this ensures the server
runs your local source code. Placing the `.mcp.json` in the project root allows you to
test from the same Claude Code (or other MCP client) session where you develop, with the
server always reflecting your latest code changes:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keboola-local": {
      "command": "<absolute-path-to-project>/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "keboola_mcp_server"],
      "env": {
        "KBC_STORAGE_API_URL": "https://connection.<stack>.keboola.com",
        "KBC_STORAGE_TOKEN": "<your-token>",
        "KBC_BRANCH_ID": "<optional-branch-id>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Use the **absolute path** to the venv Python — relative paths or bare `python` may pick up
  a different interpreter that doesn't have your local edits.
- After making code changes, the MCP server must be **reloaded** to pick them up.
