# Pulumi Rust

Experimental Pulumi Rust support: a Go language host (`pulumi-language-rust`), a
Rust code generator, and the Rust SDK runtime crate (`pulumi`). The host implements
Pulumi's `LanguageRuntime` gRPC interface so the CLI can run Rust programs; the
codegen turns Pulumi Package schemas into typed Rust SDK crates, and PCL into Rust
programs. Runtime name is `rust`; the plugin binary is `pulumi-language-rust`.

## Repository structure

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `sdk/rust/pulumi/` | The `pulumi` crate (v0.1.0): resource-monitor client, `Output<T>`, property-value encoding, config, policy packs (`policy.rs`), component providers (`provider.rs`) |
| `pulumi-language-rust/` | Go module — language host binary (`main.go`), conformance entry point (`language_test.go`) |
| `pulumi-language-rust/codegen/` | `gen.go` (schema → Rust SDK crate), `gen_program.go` (PCL → Rust program), plus the fast generator tests |
| `pulumi-language-rust/testdata/` | Committed golden output: `sdks/`, `projects/`, plus `policies/` and `providers/` (real crates the engine launches as plugins) |
| `pulumi-language-rust/version/` | Version symbol stamped by the linker at build time |
| `examples/` | 22 example programs (19 cloud across six providers, plus component/config/random-password); see `examples/README.md` for what is and is not verified |
| `templates/rust/` | Starting point for a new Rust Pulumi project (`pulumi new`-style scaffold) |
| `docs/known-limitations.md` | What a green conformance suite does *not* cover |
| `scripts/check-full-sdks.sh` | The real-schema canary (see below) — the only script in the repo |

## Command canon

All commands run from the repo root. `make` targets are canonical; see `Makefile`.

```sh
make build            # cargo build the SDK + go build the host. Network: crates.io.
make test_sdk         # cargo test --locked in sdk/rust/pulumi. No plugins, no CLI.
make test_codegen     # go test ./codegen/... — no cargo, no plugins, no network. Seconds.
make test_conformance # Full pulumi-test-language suite; builds first. Needs Go, Rust,
                      #   crates.io. Slow (120m timeout). No provider plugins.
make accept           # test_conformance with PULUMI_ACCEPT=1: rewrites testdata/ snapshots.
make check_full_sdks  # The canary. Needs `pulumi` on PATH, network, ~20 minutes.
make test_fast        # test_sdk + test_codegen. The pair to run before pushing.
make test_all         # test_sdk + test_codegen + test_conformance. Excludes the canary.
make lint             # go vet + golangci-lint + go mod tidy -diff; rustfmt --check + clippy
make format           # rustfmt + golangci-lint fmt. Excludes generated testdata.
make changelog        # changie new
make clean            # cargo clean plus the shared cargo target dir
```

Narrow conformance with `TEST_FILTER`, e.g.
`TEST_FILTER='l2-resource-simple' make test_conformance`; same flag for `make accept`.

Tool versions come from `.mise.toml` (Go, golangci-lint, changie, pulumi): run
`mise install`, then `make` directly or prefixed with `mise exec --`. The Rust
toolchain is deliberately **not** there — `rust-toolchain.toml` owns it, because
rustup honours that file for every cargo invocation the host and harness spawn.

## The conformance suite is the primary correctness gate

`pulumi-language-rust/language_test.go` runs the official `pulumi-test-language`
suite. **All 179 tests pass with no skips**, and `expectedFailures` — the map that
skips a test with a reason, as pulumi-dotnet and pulumi-java use during onboarding —
**is currently empty**. Keep it that way: adding an entry is taking on debt, not
fixing a test. CI runs a representative subset on pull requests and the full suite on
push. The suite snapshot-checks generated SDKs against `testdata/sdks/` and generated
programs against `testdata/projects/`, byte for byte, before it ever deploys.

## The real-schema canary is not a gate

`make check_full_sdks` (`scripts/check-full-sdks.sh`) generates and compiles the
*whole* SDK for every provider the examples pin, then compiles every example against
it. The conformance suite uses small synthetic schemas; real ones are larger by four
orders of magnitude and contain shapes the suite never produces.

**Run it periodically, not per-change.** It needs `pulumi` on `PATH`, a network and
about twenty minutes. Nothing in CI depends on it, and a red run is a prompt to go
and look, not a broken build. Worth running when the generator changes shape, when a
provider pin moves, and before a release.

**A defect it finds does not stay there.** Discovery is the canary's whole job, but
it is far too slow and network-dependent to be what keeps a defect from coming back.
When it surfaces one, shrink the schema to the smallest shape that still reproduces
it and land that as a test under `pulumi-language-rust/codegen/`, where it runs on
every pull request in seconds. All four defects it has found were retired that way —
into `recursive_test.go`, `typenames_test.go` and `naming_vectors_test.go`. See "The
real-schema canary" in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full table.
