> Repo conventions and guidance for AI agents (and any contributor) working in this repo.

## Purpose

Scott Clark's resume / CV in LaTeX, plus a plain-text markdown mirror. Three primary content artifacts, all about the same person, that should stay aligned in core facts:

| Artifact | Source | Output | Audience | Length |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resume | `ScottClarkResume.tex` | `ScottClarkResume.pdf` | Hiring, exec-search, quick-scan | 2 pages |
| CV | `ScottClarkCV.tex` | `ScottClarkCV.pdf` | Detailed review, advisory, academic | longer |
| Markdown profile | `ScottClark.md` | (markdown) | AI agents, text extractors | comprehensive |

Differences are length and emphasis: the resume picks the headline subset, the CV expands it, the md mirrors comprehensive detail in plain text.

## Two audiences

This repo serves two audiences:

1. **Scott** - source-of-truth for his resume/CV/md. The conventions in the rest of this file describe how to maintain consistency across the three artifacts.
2. **Public forkers** - the LaTeX template has been public since 2011 and is regularly forked. If you're an agent helping someone customize this for their own resume, see [Forking guidance](#forking-guidance) at the end of this document.

```

## How the artifacts relate

When a real-world fact updates (new title, new patent grant, new round closing, new talk, etc.), propagate in this direction:

1. Update **`ScottClark.md`** first - that's the dense ground-truth and has room for full detail.
2. Propagate the relevant subset to **`ScottClarkCV.tex`** - the CV mirrors what's in the md, formatted for print, with structural sections (Education, Experience, Publications, Talks, etc.).
3. Propagate the headline-only cut to **`ScottClarkResume.tex`** - the most space-constrained doc; only the strongest signal survives.

Going md → CV → resume keeps the most aggressively edited document (the resume) updated last and deliberately, rather than absorbing accidental drift from the others.

After any `.tex` change, run `pdflatex` and commit the regenerated `.pdf` alongside the `.tex` so the rendered version stays in sync with source.

## Fonts and packages

Both `.tex` files use:

- **Body:** Bitstream Charter (`charter` package) - chosen for clean italic numerals (no calligraphic 2/3) and proportional `+`/`&`.
- **Hyperlinks:** `hyperref` with `[hidelinks]` to suppress visible link borders.
- **Section bars:** Charter bold (the `\sffamily` was removed from `\resheading` so section headings stay in-family with body).

If you change the body font, also re-evaluate the `\resheading` macro - re-introducing a sans-serif there will likely look out-of-family unless paired deliberately.

## Agent-readable metadata in the resume PDF

`ScottClarkResume.tex` embeds two layers of agent-readable pointers, both invisible to humans:

1. **PDF metadata** via `\hypersetup{...}` - `pdftitle`, `pdfauthor`, `pdfsubject`, and `pdfkeywords` carry repo + markdown URLs in the PDF info dictionary. Most LLM PDF ingestion reads these.
2. **White-on-white body text** at the end of the document. Self-explanatory text that names itself as not a prompt injection so it survives copy-paste and screen-readers without seeming hostile.

When updating the resume, do **not** strip these. If URLs change, update `\hypersetup{pdfkeywords=...}` and the white-text block in lockstep.

## Spacing and layout conventions

The resume's spacing was tuned interactively. Key knobs:

- **`\resheading`** macro - section bar `\vspace` above and below.
- **`\resitem`** macro - sub-bullet trailing `\vspace{-2pt}` (tight).
- **`\setlength{\itemsep}{Npt}`** after each outer `\begin{itemize}` - controls spacing between major bullets (job/education/expertise entries) without touching sub-bullets. Currently 4-8pt depending on section.
- **Page breaks fall between major sections, not within them** - so page 1 reads as a complete unit if printed alone. If a tweak causes a major bullet to split across the seam, fix the spacing or use `\filbreak` / `\pagebreak` to force the break to a section boundary.

The CV uses similar conventions but is less space-constrained.

## Update workflow

```
1. Update ScottClark.md (canonical fact register)
2. Propagate to ScottClarkCV.tex
3. Propagate the headline cut to ScottClarkResume.tex
4. pdflatex both .tex files
5. Commit .tex and .pdf together
```
