description: Preserve the Polox.ai dark creative-workspace UI across frontend changes.
---


For every frontend or visual change, use the `polox-ui` project skill at `../skills/polox-ui/SKILL.md` and read its design-system reference before editing.

- Treat `app/assets/css/tailwind.css` as the token source of truth.
- Keep the dark canvas, tonal panels, hairline borders, controlled 8/12/16px radii, and restrained acid-lime accent.
- Reuse existing Nuxt and shadcn-vue primitives; preserve responsive and accessible states.
- Visually verify changed routes after implementation.
