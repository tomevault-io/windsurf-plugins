# Catfish — agent instructions (Codex / Claude Code)

Catfish runs a plan tournament over ingested context and produces one terse decision card.

## Start here (which doc for what)
- `README.md` — what it is, why, quickstart. **Humans start here.**
- `AGENTS.md` (this file) — how to invoke + the adaptation seams. **An AI starts here.**
- `ADAPTING.md` — retarget Catfish to a new domain/sources, step by step.
- `SPEC.md` — full architecture and design decisions.
- `RESEARCH.md` — the academic grounding behind the method.

## How to invoke
- CLI: `catfish tournament <folder> "<question>"` (add `CATFISH_DEMO=1` for a free offline run).
- MCP: tools are listed by `catfish serve`.

## Adapting Catfish to a new domain (read ADAPTING.md for the full walkthrough)
Catfish is domain-agnostic; ALL domain coupling lives in config, never in `src/`:
1. `config/tags.yaml` — keyword→tag vocabulary (default: software/eng). **Edit first.**
2. `personas/*.yaml` — the critic panel; each `filter.tags_any` MUST match tags from `config/tags.yaml`.
3. `examples/<domain>/` — drop in the user's sources; `examples/incidents/` is a complete example to copy.
4. `cognition/*.md` — the loop's stage identities; domain-agnostic, rarely edited.

Run a retarget without copying files into the repo: pass `--config-dir <folder>` (a folder holding
`tags.yaml` + `personas/`) to `catfish ingest` / `catfish tournament`. See `examples/incidents/`.

**If you reach for `src/` to change the domain, you've missed a seam — stop and use the config above.**

## Hard constraints (do not violate)
- **Never call `catfish_write_linear` without an `accepted` card.** The write is gated in code by
  `card.assert_approved()`; do not try to bypass it. On Claude Code a `PreToolUse` hook also blocks it.
- **Never mutate a top-ranked candidate in place.** Evolution only creates new candidates.
- **Card terseness is schema-enforced.** Do not pad card fields; over-cap fields are trimmed.
- **Business-value on code nodes is a human-confirmed proposal**, never asserted as fact.

## Honest limit to surface to users
Catfish outputs stress-tested *options*, not verified *answers*. Bradley-Terry rank = relative
persuasiveness among LLM judges, not truth. The human is the validator. (The one place this is
falsifiable is `examples/incidents/` — a backtest on past incidents whose real fix is known. It
measures how often the stress-tested winner matches the postmortem; it does not make any single
card "true.")

## Developing this repo (changing catfish itself)
- `make test` — full suite, offline (`CATFISH_DEMO=1 PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest -q`). Keep it green.
- Run the demo offline: `CATFISH_DEMO=1 PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m catfish tournament examples/incidents/cases/01-checkout-latency/inbox "<q>" --config-dir examples/incidents --finalists 4`
- `make demo` — re-record the README GIF (needs `vhs` + `ffmpeg`).
- `catfish map src` — regenerate the self-wiki in `wiki/` after changing `src/`.
- The sole example is `examples/incidents/` (a six-case on-call backtest; case 01 is the offline demo). Do **not** reintroduce the retired lunch, Dune, or biotech examples.
- The offline demo is canned in `src/catfish/fixtures.py` (incident case 01). If you change option names, scores, or trade-off text there, re-splice the one byte-identical mirror — `SPEC.md` ("Rendered card") — by rendering case 01 (there is no card in `README.md` to sync).
- **Backtest honesty (do not violate):** the six incident cases are fixed and `outcome.yaml` stays out of `inbox/`. Never tune a case so Catfish "wins", and never hand-write numbers into `RESULTS.md` — it is only ever populated by a real `python examples/incidents/backtest.py` run.
- Keep it lean — minimal sufficient change over gold-plating.
