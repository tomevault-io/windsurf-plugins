# Supabase edge functions

* If you want to create a new edge function, run the command `yarn supabase functions new <function-name>`
* There are shared helpers supabase/functions/_shared that you should read first, for example [cors.ts](mdc:supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts)
* Always make sure you are handling edge cases and properly returning descriptive errors
* Always consider your security model
