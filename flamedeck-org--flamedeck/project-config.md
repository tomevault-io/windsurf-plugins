# Coding Conventions

- Always memoize by default (use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to ensure stable dependencies)
  - Also wrap exported components in `memo`
- Always memoize context values so they don't trigger unnecessary rerenders
- Abstract large new pieces of functionality into separate hooks / components - component files should not be huge
- Always use named function declarations for components. E.g. `function MyComponent() {` not `const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {`

## Creating components

- We want to avoid very large files - try to think about how to extract things in to reasonably sized components or hooks or utility functions. Generally we want one function per file
- You should logically structure components around where they are used. For example if `components/TraceList.tsx` needs to render a `TraceListItem` component, you should create a folder called `components/TraceList` which looks like:

```
components/
  TraceList/
    TraceList.tsx
    index.ts // exports TraceList and anything else needed
    TraceListItem.tsx
    hooks/
      useTraces.ts // any hooks related to the component
```

Keeping a clean and organized file heirarchy is critical to the application being maintainable in the long run
