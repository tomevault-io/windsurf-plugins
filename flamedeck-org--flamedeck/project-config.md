# Rule: Creating a New Settings Page

This rule outlines the standard procedure for adding a new settings page to the FlameDeck client application.

## 1. File Creation and Location

*   New settings page components should be created within the `apps/client/src/pages/settings/` directory.
*   The filename should be descriptive and use PascalCase, e.g., `NewFeatureSettingsPage.tsx`.

## 2. Component Structure and Formatting

*   Import necessary components and hooks. Standard imports often include:
    *   `memo`, `useCallback`, `useState`, `useMemo` from `react`.
    *   UI components from `@/components/ui/...` (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Input`).
    *   Relevant custom hooks (e.g., `useUserSubscription` from `@/hooks/useUserSubscription`).
    *   API interaction functions from `@/lib/api/...`.
    *   `toast` from `sonner` for notifications.
    *   The [PageHeader component](mdc:apps/client/src/components/PageHeader.tsx) for the page title.
*   The main page component should be a named function (e.g., `function NewFeatureSettingsPage() { ... }`).
*   Wrap the exported component with `React.memo` for performance: `export default memo(NewFeatureSettingsPage);`
*   **Layout:**
    *   The top-level JSX should typically be a React Fragment (`<>...</>`).
    *   Start with the `<PageHeader title="Your Page Title" />` component.
    *   Structure the main content within one or more `<Card>` components from `@/components/ui/card`. Each card should usually have:
        *   `<CardHeader>` with `<CardTitle>` and optionally `<CardDescription>`.
        *   `<CardContent>` for the main interactive elements or information display.
        *   Optionally `<CardFooter>` for action buttons related to the card.
*   Refer to existing settings pages like [ApiKeysPage.tsx](mdc:apps/client/src/pages/settings/ApiKeysPage.tsx) or [BillingPage.tsx](mdc:apps/client/src/pages/settings/BillingPage.tsx) for examples of structure and styling.

## 3. Routing

*   Open [App.tsx](mdc:apps/client/src/App.tsx).
*   Import the newly created settings page component.
*   Add a new `<Route>` within the `SettingsLayout` route group. For example:
    ```tsx
    // ... other imports ...
    import NewFeatureSettingsPage from './pages/settings/NewFeatureSettingsPage';

    // ... inside the <Routes> component ...
    <Route path="/settings" element={<SettingsLayout />}>
      <Route index element={<Navigate to="/settings/general" replace />} />
      <Route path="general" element={<SettingsPage />} />
      <Route path="api-keys" element={<ApiKeysPage />} />
      <Route path="billing" element={<BillingPage />} />
      {/* Add new route here */}
      <Route path="new-feature" element={<NewFeatureSettingsPage />} />
    </Route>
    ```

## 4. Sidebar Navigation

*   Open [SettingsSidebar.tsx](mdc:apps/client/src/components/settings/SettingsSidebar.tsx).
*   Ensure the `SettingsNavLink` component is defined or imported. This component standardizes the appearance of navigation links in the settings sidebar.
*   Import an appropriate icon from `lucide-react` for the new settings page if not already available.
*   Add a new instance of the `<SettingsNavLink>` component. Provide the `to` path (matching the route defined in `App.tsx`), a `label` for the link text, an `ariaLabel` for accessibility, and the `Icon` component. Example:
    ```tsx
    // ... ensure SettingsNavLink is defined or imported ...
    // ... ensure appropriate icon is imported from lucide-react ...
    import { ..., NewIcon } from 'lucide-react';

    // ... inside the <nav> element where other SettingsNavLinks are ...
    <SettingsNavLink
      to="/settings/new-feature"
      label="New Feature"
      ariaLabel="New Feature Settings"
      Icon={NewIcon}
    />
    ```

## 5. State Management and Logic

*   Use React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`) for component state and memoization.
*   For data fetching or mutations, prefer custom hooks (e.g., built with `@tanstack/react-query`) as seen in `useUserApiKeys` or `useUserSubscription`.
*   Handle loading states and error feedback gracefully, often using `toast` notifications for actions.

By following these steps, new settings pages will maintain consistency with the existing application structure and user experience.
