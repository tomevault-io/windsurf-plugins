## Planning Benchmark

This repo benchmarks how well coding agents plan against a product spec. The default collection workflow has two actions. Run each in a fresh context.

### Actions

1. **Generate a plan** — Read and follow `1-START_HERE.md`. Produces `results/PLAN.md`.
2. **Evaluate a plan** — Read and follow `2-EVALUATE_PLAN.md`. Produces both `results/PLAN_EVAL.md` and `results/PLAN_EVAL_REPORT.html`.
3. **Re-render the report (optional fallback)** — Read and follow `3-PLAN_EVAL_REPORT.md`. Produces `results/PLAN_EVAL_REPORT.html`.

### Development Guidelines

If a task involves planning or reasoning about code architecture, read `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for coding standards and architectural patterns.
