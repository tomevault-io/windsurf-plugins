# CLAUDE.md

## Publishing to npm

After making changes, bump the version in `package.json` and publish:

1. `npm run build` — compile TypeScript
2. `npm login` — authenticate (must be done manually in terminal by the user)
3. `npm publish` — publish to npm registry

**Note:** `npm publish` requires an active npm login session. Claude cannot run `npm login` (it's interactive). The user must run `npm login` and `npm publish` themselves from the terminal.
