description: Huttle AI development rules for React, Vite, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and modern web development practices
---


You are an expert developer proficient in JavaScript, React (Vite), Supabase, Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM, React Context API, Stripe (with subscription model), and modern web development practices.

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical JavaScript/JSX code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`, `userData`).
- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and constants.
- Favor named exports for components and functions.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
- Group related imports: React imports first, then third-party, then local imports.

## JavaScript and React Patterns

- Use JavaScript for all code; prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.
- Implement functional components with clear prop destructuring.
- Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) appropriately.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Use arrow functions for event handlers and callbacks.
- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions and component declarations.

## Syntax and Formatting

- Write declarative JSX with clear and readable structure.
- Use template literals for string interpolation.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safe property access.
- Prefer early returns to avoid deep nesting.

## UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling and UI components.
- Implement responsive design with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind breakpoints.
- Use Tailwind utility classes; avoid inline styles unless necessary.
- Leverage Tailwind's custom theme colors (`huttle-primary`, `huttle-primary-dark`, `huttle-primary-light`).
- Use Lucide React for icons consistently throughout the app.
- Implement consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes using Tailwind utilities.
- Use Tailwind animations (`fadeIn`, `slideUp`) for smooth transitions.

## State Management

- Use React Context API for global state management (AuthContext, BrandContext, SubscriptionContext, etc.).
- Minimize the use of `useEffect` and `setState`; favor derived state and memoization when possible.
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to optimize expensive computations and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Keep component state local when possible; lift state only when needed.
- Use custom hooks to encapsulate reusable stateful logic.

## Routing and Navigation

- Use React Router DOM for client-side routing.
- Implement protected routes using `ProtectedRoute` component pattern.
- Use `Navigate` component for programmatic navigation.
- Handle route parameters and query strings appropriately.
- Implement lazy loading for route components using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.

## Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deep nesting.
- Implement proper error logging with `console.error` for debugging.
- Display user-friendly error messages using toast notifications.
- Always check for `error` before accessing `data` in Supabase queries.
- Handle Supabase error codes gracefully (e.g., `PGRST116` for "no rows found" is not always an error).

## Performance Optimization

- Use dynamic imports (`React.lazy()`) for code splitting and route-based code splitting.
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components.
- Use `useMemo` for expensive computations.
- Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to child components.
- Optimize images: use appropriate formats, include size data, and implement lazy loading.
- Minimize bundle size by importing only what's needed from libraries.

## Backend and Database (Supabase)

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication, database interactions, and file storage.
- Follow Supabase best practices for security and performance:
  - Always wrap `auth.uid()` and `auth.jwt()` calls in `(select ...)` for RLS performance: `(select auth.uid()) = user_id`
  - Use `SET search_path = ''` for trigger functions to prevent search_path injection
  - Use `SET search_path = public` for SECURITY DEFINER functions
  - Handle `PGRST116` (no rows found) gracefully - it's not always an error
  - Use `.maybeSingle()` instead of `.single()` when a row might not exist
- Always include `.eq('user_id', userId)` in user-scoped queries for RLS.
- Use signed URLs for private bucket files; never expose private bucket URLs directly.
- Cache signed URLs client-side but respect expiration times.
- Use `.upsert()` with conflict resolution for idempotent operations.
- Default to `TIERS.FREE` when subscription lookup fails.
- Track feature usage in `user_activity` table with feature name and metadata.
- Validate storage limits before uploads using `checkStorageLimit()`.

## Stripe Integration and Subscription Model

- Implement Stripe for payment processing and subscription management.
- Use Stripe's Customer Portal for subscription management.
- Implement webhook handlers for Stripe events (e.g., subscription created, updated, or cancelled).
- Ensure proper error handling and security measures for Stripe integration.
- Sync subscription status with user data in Supabase.
- Use subscription tiers (`free`, `essentials`, `pro`) consistently throughout the app.
- Check feature access using `canAccessFeature()` helper function.

## Project Structure

- Follow the established project structure:
  - `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `src/pages/` - Page components (routes)
  - `src/context/` - React Context providers
  - `src/config/` - Configuration files (Supabase, n8n)
  - `src/services/` - API service functions
  - `src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
  - `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
  - `src/layouts/` - Layout components
  - `api/` - Vercel serverless functions
- Use environment variables with `import.meta.env.VITE_*` prefix for Vite.
- Follow patterns for environment-specific configurations.

## Key Conventions

- Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages.
- Ensure code is clean, well-documented with JSDoc comments for complex functions.
- Implement error handling and logging consistently across the application.
- Use consistent naming: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components.
- Group related functionality together (e.g., all Supabase functions in `config/supabase.js`).

## Follow Official Documentation

- Adhere to the official documentation for each technology used.
- For React, focus on hooks, context API, and modern patterns.
- For Supabase, follow RLS best practices and performance guidelines.
- For Tailwind CSS, use utility-first approach and leverage custom theme configuration.
- Stay updated with the latest best practices and updates, especially for React 19, Supabase, and Vite.

## Output Expectations

- **Code Examples**: Provide code snippets that align with the guidelines above.
- **Explanations**: Include brief explanations to clarify complex implementations when necessary.
- **Clarity and Correctness**: Ensure all code is clear, correct, and ready for use in a production environment.
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrate adherence to best practices in performance, security, and maintainability.
- **Supabase Patterns**: Always follow the Supabase RLS performance patterns and error handling conventions established in the codebase.---
