# kingme Agent Guide

## What This Repo Is

`kingme` is the product repo for a multi-game AI agent platform.

The product idea is:

- train game-playing AI agents
- promote the strongest released agents
- let humans play them
- let agents play each other

Checkers is the first live game, not the only planned one.

## Current Reality

Right now:

- the first live game is checkers
- the first public agent is `sinza`
- `sinza` is currently backed by the upgraded alpha-beta engine at depth `7`
- the live engine API is deployed on Modal

Current live engine base URL:

- `https://ctrlx--kingme-engine-api.modal.run`

## Repo Split

This repo does **not** own model training.

Training and benchmark experimentation happen in separate engine lab repos.

This repo owns:

- product UI
- product state orchestration
- serving released engine agents
- API contracts between product code and engine code

## Important Constraint

For game UIs, do **not** reimplement move legality in the frontend unless there is a very strong reason.

For checkers specifically:

- the engine API is the source of truth for legal moves
- the engine API is the source of truth for state transitions
- the frontend should round-trip the full `StatePayload` exactly

## Current Engine Integration

Relevant docs:

- `README.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/engine.md`
- `docs/API.md`

For the current checkers integration, the expected loop is:

1. fetch initial state
2. fetch legal moves for the current state
3. apply the human move through the API
4. ask `sinza` for its reply through the API
5. render returned state

## Working Areas

### `apps/web`

Owns:

- player-facing UX
- game screens
- landing/marketing pages
- agent roster views

Should not own:

- heavy engine logic
- authoritative game-rule enforcement

### `apps/engine-api`

Owns:

- serving the released engine runtime
- legal move generation
- move application
- agent move generation

### `convex`

Owns:

- app/session state
- persistence
- leaderboards
- player records
- realtime product updates

## Guidance For New Work

- Keep the product framed as multi-game, even if the current runtime is checkers-first.
- Avoid baking checkers assumptions into shared abstractions unless clearly marked as v1-only.
- Prefer stable contracts over clever client-side shortcuts.
- If you add new docs for integration, link them from `README.md`.
- If you change the engine API surface, update `docs/API.md` in the same change.

## Commit and PR Hygiene

Ship work in small, reviewable chunks. A large multi-phase change should become several small PRs, not one mega-PR.

- Each commit should be one logical unit (one concept, one reason to revert). Split scaffolding, feature code, tests, and docs into separate commits where that aids review.
- Prefer several small PRs over one large one. If a single phase of the roadmap produces more than ~400 lines of non-generated diff across more than ~5 files, stop and consider splitting it.
- When implementing a multi-step plan, open a PR after each coherent step and let it land before starting the next. Do not stack many unrelated changes behind one review.
- Exception: trivially coupled changes (e.g. a type change and the single call-site it breaks) stay in one commit.

## Current Launch Assumption

Until the product adds more public agents, assume:

- one public checkers agent: `sinza`
- one live engine service on Modal
- frontend work can proceed against the documented API contract

<!-- convex-ai-start -->
This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running `npx convex ai-files install`.
