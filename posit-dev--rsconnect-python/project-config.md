# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

rsconnect-python is the Posit Connect command-line interface for deploying Python content (Shiny apps, Quarto documents, APIs, Jupyter notebooks, etc.) to Posit Connect servers. The tool handles bundling content, managing credentials, and orchestrating deployments.

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install the project plus dev tooling
# `uv` provisions the interpreter and resolves the `test` dependency group
uv sync --group test

# Run the CLI from your working tree
uv run rsconnect version
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests with the default Python (3.13)
just test

# Run tests with a specific Python version (uv fetches it if needed)
just test 3.12

# Run tests across all supported Python versions
just all-tests

# Run single test file
uv run pytest tests/test_bundle.py

# Run single test
uv run pytest tests/test_bundle.py::test_function_name
```

### Linting and Formatting
```bash
# Auto-format and apply fixes
just fmt

# Run all linters (ruff format --check, ruff check, pyright)
just lint
```

### Documentation
```bash
# Build documentation
just docs

# Serve documentation locally (with live reload)
just docs-serve
```

### Building Distribution
```bash
# Build wheel distribution
just dist

# Install built package
just install
```

## Code Architecture

### Core Modules

**main.py** - CLI entry point using Click framework. Defines all commands (deploy, add, list, etc.) and option parsing. Commands delegate to action functions.

**api.py** - HTTP client for Posit Connect API. Key classes:
- `RSConnectServer` - represents a Connect server (URL, API key, certificates)
- `RSConnectClient` - low-level HTTP operations
- `RSConnectExecutor` - high-level deployment operations (deploy_bundle, wait_for_task, etc.)
- `SPCSConnectServer` - specialized server for Snowflake deployments

**actions.py & actions_content.py** - High-level deployment orchestration:
- `actions.py` - deployment workflows (test connections, create bundles, validate Quarto)
- `actions_content.py` - content management (list, search, build history, download bundles)

**bundle.py** - Content bundling and manifest generation. Creates tar.gz bundles containing:
- Application files
- `manifest.json` describing app mode, entry point, dependencies
- Environment snapshot (requirements.txt or environment.yml)

Functions named `make_*_bundle()` for different content types (api, html, notebook, tensorflow, voila, quarto).

**models.py** - Data structures:
- `AppMode` - represents content types (shiny, quarto-shiny, jupyter-static, python-api, etc.)
- `AppModes` - registry of all supported app modes with lookup functions
- TypedDict models for API responses (ContentItemV1, TaskStatusV1, etc.)

**metadata.py** - Persistent storage of configuration:
- `ServerStore` - saved server credentials (stored in `~/.rsconnect-python/`)
- `AppStore` - deployment history per directory (stored in local `rsconnect-python/` subdirs)

**environment.py** - Python dependency detection:
- Inspects virtual environments, conda environments, or current Python
- Generates requirements files for reproducible deployments
- Runs inspection in subprocess for isolation

### Deployment Flow

1. **Validate** - Check server connection, validate content files
2. **Bundle** - Create manifest.json, snapshot dependencies, tar content files
3. **Upload** - POST bundle to `/v1/content` or existing content GUID
4. **Deploy** - Server extracts bundle, starts deployment task
5. **Wait** - Poll task status until COMPLETE or ERROR
6. **Store** - Save deployment metadata to local AppStore

### App Modes

Different content types have different app modes (defined in models.py):
- `python-shiny` - Shiny for Python apps
- `quarto-shiny` - Quarto documents with Shiny runtime
- `jupyter-static` - Rendered Jupyter notebooks
- `python-api` - FastAPI, Flask APIs
- `python-dash` - Plotly Dash apps
- `python-streamlit` - Streamlit apps
- `python-holoviz-panel` - HoloViz Panel apps
- etc.

The app mode determines how Connect runs the content. Manifests must specify the correct mode.

## Testing

### Test Structure
- Unit tests in `tests/` mirror module structure (`test_bundle.py`, `test_api.py`, etc.)
- Uses `pytest` with `httpretty` for mocking HTTP requests
- `conftest.py` defines shared fixtures

### Key Test Patterns
- Mock HTTP responses with `httpretty` decorators
- Use temporary directories for file operations
- Test fixtures in `tests/testdata/` for sample content
- `test_metadata.py` has long lines that exceed the default line length limit

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/main.yml`
- Tests run on Python 3.8-3.13 across ubuntu/macos/windows
- Linting enforced on all PRs
- Coverage reported on Python 3.8 PRs

## Code Style

### Python Standards
- `ruff format` for formatting (120 char line length)
- `ruff check` for linting (enforced in CI)
- Pyright for type checking (advisory; does not fail `just lint`)
- Python 3.8+ compatibility (use `typing_extensions` for newer types)

### Type Annotations
- Strict type checking enabled (`typeCheckingMode = "strict"`)
