description: Build an explorable isometric diagram of a codebase — blocks on a grid, a component index, a what-it-does/how-it's-built panel, and real data moving along the edges. Use when asked to map, diagram or visually explain how a system fits together.
---


Read `SKILL.md` in this repository and follow it. If codemap is installed
elsewhere, read the `SKILL.md` from that copy.

The rendering is already written — `assets/template.html` is complete, and
building a map means replacing the `STATS`, `NODES`, `EDGES` and `REGIONS`
arrays plus the `<title>` and the `<svg aria-label>`. `REGIONS` draws a dashed
outline around the parts the repository does not own — the blocks inside it are
drawn dashed too — and may be left empty.

Spend the effort instead on mining the repository for facts a reader could not
get from the file listing: measured numbers, platform limits the code works
around, comments explaining why a constant is the value it is.

Put real values on the edges. `2 OpenWrite 0 2 0 3` teaches; `Instruction` does not.

Then run both checks, and look at the render before handing it over:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify.py my-map.html
python3 scripts/render.py my-map.html render.png
```

Every fault that mattered while this was built passed the static checks and was
obvious in the render.
