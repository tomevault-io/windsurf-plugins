This project is a minimal webapp that expose the python cad library build123d in the browser with the compiled wasm ocp.

The project is using :
- Docker, everything is set up from a dockerfile
- React for the front end
- FastApi as the python server exposing the webapp
- Typescript
- Vite
- Pyproject.toml
- uv [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/]
- python 3.13
- Material components



The app is composed of two main parts :
- A code editor to allow the user to write build123d code.
- A viewer (three-cad-viewer) which is a javascript viewer already packaged


All the react components are written with the `function` keyword never arrow functions.


Arrow functions are only used as callback within other functions
