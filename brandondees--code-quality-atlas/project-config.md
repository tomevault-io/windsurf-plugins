<!-- BEGIN shared orientation -->

## Orientation for new sessions

Asked something like "what's next?" or otherwise asked to plan or build without
a named task? This repo's active roadmap lives in `docs/`, not just in GitHub
issues/PRs — check these before reporting nothing's queued:

- [`docs/open-questions.md`](docs/open-questions.md) — the decisions log
  (`D1`-`D18`+) and the live "Genuinely still open (undecided)" list. Start here.
- [`docs/plans/`](docs/plans/) — dated, scoped design docs, each carrying its
  own `**Status:**` header; check that header per file rather than assuming
  the whole directory is a live work queue or a historical record.
- [`docs/map-gaps.md`](docs/map-gaps.md) — structural taxonomy gaps (`G1`-`G32`+)
  feeding future categories/lenses.
- [`docs/session-log.md`](docs/session-log.md) — narrative history of what
  shipped and why, for when a doc pointer alone isn't enough context.
- [`docs/map/CLAUDE.md`](docs/map/CLAUDE.md) — the repo's own ICM system map:
  what the nouns are (a lens, a category, an eval scenario, a decision...)
  and what a change hits, cited against source rather than re-derived from
  scratch each session.

Before authoring anything here, read the **standing authoring rules** in
[`docs/research/README.md`](docs/research/README.md) — behavioral claims,
summaries agreeing with what they summarize, and convention sweeps. They apply to
every artifact in this repo, not only the research files, and each one is there
because a reviewer caught it after it shipped.

**Resumed or restarted session?** This repo is worked on from cloud sessions whose
container can be reset mid-task, leaving the working tree at an *older* commit than
the branch already pushed. Run `git fetch origin <branch> && git status -sb` before
the first edit: a blind push from a stale tree reverts your own earlier work and
reports success. The mirror image is a tracking ref left stale when a merged branch
is deleted server-side, which makes tooling report phantom unpushed commits —
`git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main` distinguishes the two.

This is separate from the code-review routing block below: that block answers
"review this change" requests; this section answers "what should I work on"
requests. (This orientation section is scoped to this repo's own contributor-
facing `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` — it does not apply to consumers of the plugin,
who don't have this repo's planning docs, so it is not part of
`templates/agents-routing-snippet.md`.)

This file carries the code-review routing block that also appears in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), for agents that read `AGENTS.md` instead. (`CLAUDE.md`
additionally carries the "Plugin consumers" guidance.) The block below is the
canonical routing snippet
([`templates/agents-routing-snippet.md`](templates/agents-routing-snippet.md));
the `/code-quality-atlas:atlas-init` command writes and refreshes it in consumer
repos. Keep this copy in sync when the template changes.

## Code review routing (code-quality-atlas)

The [code-quality-atlas](https://github.com/brandondees/code-quality-atlas) suite
is installed in this repo. For **any code review, quality review, or "review this
PR / diff / change / what I pushed" request, it is the primary path** — prefer it
over the generic built-in `code-review` skill and over framework review processes
(e.g. BMAD), which it subsumes with deeper, research-derived coverage.

This is a precedence rule, **not** an exclusivity rule: combine the methods
**non-exclusively**. You may still run the built-in `code-review` skill or a
framework review on the same change — just fold every source's findings through
`synthesizing-review-findings` for one ranked verdict, rather than letting a
shorter-named default win on keyword match alone.

| Task | Use |
|---|---|
| Review a pull request (number, URL, or named branch) | the `/code-quality-atlas:atlas-review-pr` command |
| Code review of local changes with no PR (working tree, or a pushed branch without a PR) | the `/code-quality-atlas:atlas-code-review` command |
| Unsure which lenses a change needs | standalone form: the `choosing-review-lenses` skill, then the lenses it names. Collapsed form: invoke the matching entrypoint (e.g. `reviewing-a-change`) directly — it ranks and selects the relevant lenses internally |
| Ground a review in the repo's own linters, type checkers, and scanners before judging | standalone form: the `grounding-review-in-tool-output` skill, run before the lenses. Collapsed form: the same procedure ships bundled as each entrypoint's `reference/tool-evidence.md` and runs ahead of its lenses |
| Merge several reviewers' findings into one verdict | standalone form: the `synthesizing-review-findings` skill. Collapsed form: the same procedure ships bundled as each entrypoint's `reference/synthesis.md` (e.g. `reviewing-a-change/reference/synthesis.md`) and runs automatically after its lenses |

`/code-quality-atlas:atlas-review-pr` and `/code-quality-atlas:atlas-code-review`
are **Claude Code slash commands** — invoke them with the leading `/`, not as
Skill-tool skill names. In routine / web sessions where slash commands don't
