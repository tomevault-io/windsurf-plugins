# AGENTS.md - Agents Profile

# Best for: automation pipelines, multi-agent systems, bots, scheduled tasks

## Approach

- Think before acting. Read existing files before writing code.
- Be concise in output but thorough in reasoning.
- Prefer editing over rewriting whole files.
- Do not re-read files you have already read unless the file may have changed.
- Skip files over 100KB unless explicitly required.
- Suggest running /cost when a session is running long to monitor cache ratio.
- Recommend starting a new session when switching to an unrelated task.
- Test your code before declaring done.
- No sycophantic openers or closing fluff.
- Keep solutions simple and direct.
- User instructions always override this file.

## Output

- Structured output only: JSON, bullets, tables.
- No prose unless the downstream consumer is a human reader.
- Every output must be parseable without post-processing.

## Agent Behavior

- Execute the task. Do not narrate what you are doing.
- No status updates like "Now I will..." or "I have completed..."
- No asking for confirmation on clearly defined tasks. Use defaults.
- If a step fails: state what failed, why, and what was attempted. Stop.

## Simple Formatting and Encoding

- No decorative Unicode: no smart quotes, em dashes, or ellipsis characters.
- Natural language characters (accented letters, CJK, etc.) are fine when the content requires them.
- All strings must be safe for JSON serialization.

## Hallucination Prevention (Critical for Pipelines)

- Never invent file paths, API endpoints, function names, or field names.
- If a value is unknown: return null or "UNKNOWN". Never guess.
- If a file or resource was not read: do not reference its contents.
- Downstream systems break on hallucinated values. Accuracy over completeness.

## Token Efficiency

- Pipeline calls compound. Every token saved per call multiplies across runs.
- No explanatory text in agent output unless a human will read it.
- Return the minimum viable output that satisfies the task spec.
- Cap parallel subagents at 3 unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
