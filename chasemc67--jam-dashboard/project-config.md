jam-dashboard is a website/tool to help with guitar music theory.

Specifically, it contains the following features:
- a global key picker which drives the key for the whole page
- a fretboard visualizer, which lets you easily see where a collection of notes are on the fretboard
- an ear-training game which lets you pick a set of chord types to test against
- a chord explorer, which will both play the chords and show their voicings on the fretboard 

It's built with:
- React
- Remix
- Tailwind
- ShadCN
- Tonal.js (for music-theory related utils)
- Tone.js (for playing the chords/notes etc)

And we also use:
- Vercel (for deployment and some analytics)
- Posthog (for feedback, and advanced analytics)
- BuyMeACoffee (for accepting tips)

The way color theming works is:

- Colors are defined in tailwind.css, and the inital theme (colors) are taken from a ShadCN
- theres a `/theme` route where we can preview the colors

The fretboard visulizer has a number of advanced features, including:

- being able to control the tuning of each string
- adjusting the number of frets visualized
- using a key-picker to easily select notes being visualized, with the ability to also edit those notes after in the textbox
- a scale detector which can suggest matching scales based on the notes in the textbox.

The fretboard visualizer is in two main react components:

- fret.tsx renders individual frets
- fretboard.tsx renders a collection of frets into a fretboard

The component which handles the overall page layout, and the inputs for fretboard, is FretboardControls.tsx

For music-theory related utils and functions, we mostly use Tonal.js. We also have a musicTheoryUtils.ts file which handles things like converting between equivalent notes (flat/sharp)
and other util functions used to match up equivalent notes on the fretboard

We always add storybook stories to all our UI components.
We always add Jest unit tests to all our util files.

When adding new React components, we give each their own folder, with a story and index.tsx to export them. The structure looks like this:

📂 ReactComponentName/
├── ReactComponentName.tsx
├── ReactComponentName.stories.tsx
└── index.tsx
