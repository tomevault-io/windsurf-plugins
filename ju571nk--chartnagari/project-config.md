# CLAUDE.md — ChartNagari AI Contributor Guide

> When Claude Code opens this project, read this file first.

## Project Summary

ChartNagari is a local-run platform that automatically detects ICT/Wyckoff and general TA signals
across multiple timeframes (1W/1D/4H/1H) for US stocks and crypto, and sends alerts via Telegram/Discord.
Go backend + TypeScript/React frontend.

## Tech Stack

- Backend  : Go 1.26+
- Frontend : TypeScript + React 18 + Vite
- DB       : SQLite (local)
- Alerts   : Telegram Bot / Discord Webhook
- Data     : Yahoo Finance (stocks) / Binance WebSocket (crypto)

## Contribution Principles

- Run `go test ./...` before submitting any code change — all tests must pass.
- Follow existing patterns: zerolog structured logging, context propagation, table-driven tests.
- New trading rules go in `internal/methodology/<category>/` and must be registered in `config/rules.yaml`.
- Do not commit `.env` or any file containing real API keys.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a brief entry under the appropriate version/date heading.

## Agent Team

This project uses a multi-agent team architecture. The `orchestrator` agent coordinates 4 specialists:

- **go-backend** — Go code (cmd/, internal/)
- **react-frontend** — React/TS code (web/src/)
- **trading-analyst** — Trading rule design & tuning (internal/methodology/)
- **release-engineer** — VERSION, CHANGELOG, PRs, CI

For cross-domain tasks, spawn the orchestrator which will create a team and dispatch work.
For single-domain tasks, spawn the specialist directly.

Agent definitions: `.claude/agents/`

## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.

## gstack
Use /browse from gstack for all web browsing.
Never use mcp__claude-in-chrome__* tools.
