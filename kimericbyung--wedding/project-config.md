# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

This is a wedding website project by Eric Kim, hosted at https://github.com/kimericbyung/wedding.git.  The idea is to create a basic wedding webiste for Brittaney and Eric for their upcoming wedding on 09/19/2026.  They need the ability to RSVP and choose their dish preferences.  Also a page that links to their honeyfund and amazon wishlists.

The overall vibe of the webiste should be tumblr-esque.  

- Build, dev, and lint commands
"dev": "next dev",
"build": "next build",
"start": "next start",
"lint": "eslint"
- Project structure and key directories
Next.js + React + TypeScript
Tailwind CSS for styling
Vercel for hosting
Postgres/Supabase only if you later need real RSVP/admin data
Stripe Checkout or Honeyfund links for gifting, instead of handling payments yourself
- Any environment variables required
None
