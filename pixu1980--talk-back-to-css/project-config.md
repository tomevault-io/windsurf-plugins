# Copilot Instructions - Back to CSS

## Project Context

Back to CSS is a reveal.js-based talk that explores how HTML attributes can act as the state layer while CSS delivers the logic. The presentation focuses on three modern CSS building blocks working together:

- Typed `attr()` to read unit-safe values from markup
- Native `if()` expressions for branching styles with no JavaScript
- Reusable `@function` definitions to encapsulate logic

All demos must feel like scenes from _Back to the Future_: neon palette, timeline metaphors, and references to flux capacitors, 88 mph jumps, and temporal shifts between "past" and "future" UI states.

## Talk Objectives

1. Prove that HTML attributes can drive entire interfaces.
2. Showcase how CSS typed attributes, `if()`, and `@function` compose a logic layer.
3. Deliver mostly zero-JS interaction; JS is allowed only to set or sync attributes.
4. Highlight practical component patterns (toggles, timelines, gauges, dashboards) themed around time travel.
5. Inspire teams to architect attribute-driven systems today.

## Narrative & Section Flow (45-50 min / ~45 slides)

1. **Intro (Slides 1-3)**
   - Speaker intro, Back to the Future hook, explain "HTML = state, CSS = logic" mantra.
2. **Foundations (Slides 4-10)**
   - Typed `attr()` recap, attribute typing syntax, HTML data props as state bus.
3. **Branching in CSS (Slides 11-18)**
   - Native `if()` demos, fallbacks, comparison with `:has()` or classes.
4. **Reusable Logic (Slides 19-26)**
   - `@function` authoring, chaining math + if(), timeline utilities.
5. **Attribute-Driven UI Systems (Slides 27-36)**
   - Component props, theming, multi-element coordination, zero-JS toggles, JS-enhanced attribute syncing.
6. **Temporal Case Studies (Slides 37-41)**
   - Past vs future modes, flux dashboards, "88 mph" trigger scenes.
7. **Wrap-up & CTA (Slides 42-45)**
   - Recap, resources, Q&A, invite to push CSS logic.

Every technical slide must include:

- A short explanation tying the API to the story.
- A code sample showing HTML attributes feeding CSS logic.
- A live demo flipping states by editing attributes only.

## Visual & Thematic Direction

- Palette: neon orange (#ff9500), teal (#00f5ff), deep space gray. Use gradients, scanlines, CRT glow sparingly.
- Typography: use provided `@pixu-talks/fonts`. Headings may mimic "Back to the Future" vibe but keep accessibility.
- Iconography: lightning bolts, timelines, speedometers, flux capacitor silhouettes.
- Callouts reference "past" vs "future" states, e.g., `data-era="1985"` vs `data-era="2015"`.

## Technical Standards

### HTML / Structure

- Slides live under `src/slides/` and follow PostHTML include patterns.
- Use semantic markup; prefer `<section>` wrappers with descriptive headings.
- Provide `aria-live`, `role`, and alt text for any dynamic widgets.
- HTML attributes should be the single source of truth (e.g., `data-speed="88mph"`, `data-energy="1.21GW"`).

### CSS

- Demonstrate typed `attr()` syntax: `attr(data-speed number, 0) * 1deg`.
- Encapsulate logic inside `@function` definitions placed in dedicated CSS partials if needed.
- Use `if()` for branching (`if(attr(data-era token) = past, ...)`). Always include fallbacks for browsers lacking support.
- Favor custom properties for sharing attribute-derived values across components.
- For Back to the Future callbacks, include timeline-themed animations (light trails, glitches) handled with CSS only.
- Organize new feature-specific styles inside `src/styles/` subfiles and import them from `index.css`.

### JavaScript

- Place scripts in `src/scripts/`. Keep JS minimal: only hydrate attributes, sync UI state, or respond to user input by setting `data-*` props.
- No virtual DOM or frameworks. Vanilla modules only, documented with concise comments.
- If JS mutates attributes, mirror the attribute schema in README so future contributors know the contract.

### Language & Formatting

- English only, ASCII punctuation (use standard hyphen-minus).
- Avoid hyphenated compound adjectives; prefer spaced phrases ("time travel ready").
- Format HTML/CSS/MD/JSON/YAML with Prettier, JS/TS with Biome.
- After editing files run:
  - `pnpm run format:prettier`
  - `pnpm run format:biome`

## Slide Requirements

- One core concept per slide.
- Always pair explanation + code + demo.
- Demo interactions should be attribute-first. Example:

```html
<section data-era="2015" data-speed="88">
  <h2>Typed attr() as Flux Readout</h2>
  <div class="flux-panel" data-energy="1.21">
    <button data-mode="past">1985</button>
    <button data-mode="future">2015</button>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css
@property --era-hue {
  syntax: '<number>';
  inherits: false;
  initial-value: 30;
}

@function flux-glow($energy) {
  @return clamp(0px, $energy * 8px, 32px);
}

.slide[data-era='2015'] {
  --era-hue: if(attr(data-speed number, 0) >= 88, 200, 30);
  box-shadow: 0 0 flux-glow(attr(data-energy number, 1)) hsl(var(--era-hue) 90% 60%);
}
```

- Attribute flipping should instantly change visuals with no JS besides optional helpers to toggle attributes on click.
