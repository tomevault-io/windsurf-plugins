description: Layered knowledge architecture — non-leaf nodes index, leaf nodes contain concise detail, all nodes cross-reference

# Knowledge documentation structure

The `.agents/knowledge/` system uses layered design with cross-references. Follow these rules when editing any `.agents/` markdown file.

## Layered structure

- **Non-leaf** (root, Tier 1): State thesis in 1-3 lines, then index to leaf docs via tables/pointers. No inline explanations, code examples, or checklists — those live in leaves.
- **Leaf** (`topics/*.md`): Self-contained, concise detail. Include code refs, checklists, gotchas. No filler prose, no restating parent content.
- No duplication across layers. If detail exists in a leaf, the parent points to it.

## Cross-references

- Every leaf must have a `## Cross-refs` section linking UP to constraints/architecture.
- Skills link DOWN to topics via `## Related Topics` or `## Pre-Review Reading`.
- Reference constraint numbers (e.g., `constraints.md #7`), do not re-explain the rule.

## No filler

Leaf docs are direct: no "In this document we will...", no introductory paragraphs, no restating what parent docs say. Every sentence must carry information the reader needs.

## Maintenance

- New topic -> add row to `README.md` routing table + cross-refs in relevant skills.
- New constraint -> update quick index range in `constraints.md` header + section header.
- Append-only lists (`Numbered Gotchas`, `FF-Specific Pitfalls`) -> only append, never reorder or remove.
- Full rules: `.agents/knowledge/docs_maintenance.md`.
