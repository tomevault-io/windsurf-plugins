# Error handling: fail fast with informative raises

Do not write defensive `try`/`except` that hides failures: no bare `except`, no `except Exception` that returns a default, logs and continues, or swallows errors.

When behavior violates expectations (wrong type, `None`, bad shape, invalid range):

- Prefer `isinstance`, explicit `None` checks, dimension/range validation, or invariant checks **before** relying on values.
- On failure, `raise` with a **specific** exception (`TypeError`, `ValueError`, or a narrow project exception) and a message that includes **what was expected**, **what was received**, and **relevant identifiers** (names, shapes, ids) so users can debug.

Narrow `try`/`except` is acceptable only when documented (e.g. optional import → `ImportError`, or an API that returns error codes). Prefer `raise ... from e` to preserve the chain.

```python
# Bad: swallow or mask
try:
    x = f(y)
except Exception:
    x = 0

# Bad: vague message
if not isinstance(x, int):
    raise TypeError("bad type")

# Good: explicit check + informative raise
if not isinstance(x, int):
    raise TypeError(
        f"expected int for batch_size, got {type(x).__name__}: {x!r}"
    )
```
