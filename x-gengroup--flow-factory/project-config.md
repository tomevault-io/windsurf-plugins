description: Only place reusable, documented workflows in .agents/skills/. Temporary utilities go in scripts/ or tests/.
---


The `.agents/skills/` directory is for permanent, reusable agent workflows only.

Rules:
- Every skill folder must contain a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name` and `description`)
- Skill names use lowercase letters and hyphens only
- Skills must be registered in `CLAUDE.md` and `.agents/skills/README.md`
- Temporary automation, one-off scripts, or experimental code belongs in `scripts/` or `tests/`
