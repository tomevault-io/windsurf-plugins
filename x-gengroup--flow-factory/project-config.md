description: Remind to update ALL example YAML configs when modifying hparams dataclasses
---


When modifying fields in hparams/ dataclasses:
- New fields: add to ALL example configs in examples/ with default value and `# Options:` comment
- Renamed fields: search-and-replace across ALL YAML files (old keys fail silently)
- Removed fields: clean up from ALL YAML files
See constraint #15 in .agents/knowledge/constraints.md.
