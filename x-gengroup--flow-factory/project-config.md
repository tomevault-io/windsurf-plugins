description: Keep registry entries in sync with actual module locations
---


Registry entries map string keys to fully qualified Python import paths.
When modifying registry files:
- Verify each path actually resolves to the correct class
- Check that class names match the import path
- Test with get_*_class() to confirm resolution works
See constraints #1-#4 in .agents/knowledge/constraints.md.
