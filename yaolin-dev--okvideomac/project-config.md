# Project workflow

- After completing a user-requested implementation change, build and verify the Release package with `OKVideoMac/macOS/OKVideoMac/Scripts/package-app.sh`, then replace the local user's `Desktop/OKVideoMac.app` with the verified packaged app unless the user explicitly asks not to.
- Only deliver and install the verified Release app. A Debug build may be used for a quick compile check, but it must never replace the Desktop app or be presented as the deliverable.
- Never replace the Desktop app when packaging or bundle verification fails.
