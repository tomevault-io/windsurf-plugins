# Pixel Agents — Compressed Reference

Pixel art office where AI agents (Claude Code terminals today, any tool tomorrow) become animated characters. Ships as a **VS Code extension** and an **`npx pixel-agents` standalone CLI** from the same source tree.

`CONTEXT.md` is the canonical glossary — read it for what terms like Agent, Sub-agent, Teammate, Lead, Adopt, or Headless agent mean here, and use its vocabulary in code, comments, and docs.

## Architecture

Strict layering: `core/` depends on nothing; `server/` depends only on `core/`; `webview-ui/` depends only on `core/`; `adapters/vscode/` depends on `core/` and `server/`. The standalone CLI never imports `adapters/vscode/` and vice versa.

```
core/                                Protocol + interface definitions (zero runtime side effects)
  asyncapi.yaml                      AsyncAPI 3.0 contract — single source of truth
  src/
    messages.ts                      AUTO-GENERATED discriminated unions (do not edit)
    schemas.ts                       AgentMeta, SpriteData, FurnitureCatalogEntry
    provider.ts                      HookProvider, AgentEvent (the integration boundary)
    teamProvider.ts                  Optional TeamProvider (semantic queries for Lead + Teammates)
    transport.ts                     MessageTransport interface, TransportState
    adapter.ts                       StateAdapter, AssetCache, PersistedAgent, AgentSeat
    terminalAdapter.ts               TerminalAdapter (editor-driven terminal management)
    normalizeProjectPath.ts
    constants.ts

server/                              Lifecycle runtime + Fastify HTTP/WS server
  src/
    providers/hook/claude/           Reference HookProvider — only place that knows Claude specifics
      claude.ts                      normalizeHookEvent for 11 Claude events, formatToolStatus, file fallback
      claudeTeamProvider.ts          TeamProvider: reads ~/.claude/teams/<name>/config.json
      claudeHookInstaller.ts         Consent-gated install/uninstall in ~/.claude/settings.json (abort on unparseable file or non-array hooks.<Event>; one-time .pixel-agents.backup, exclusive-create, no backup ⇒ no write — but skipped when the replaced content is entirely our own install's output, since backing up our own file masquerades as the user's original (`settingsHoldOnlyOurHooks`, compared against makeHookEntry — the WRITER — so a field added to what we write can't silently revive the bug; only `command`/`timeout` may differ, they vary across installs); every write failure THROWS; mode preserved, 0600 on create; re-read verify immediately before rename + retry; hook identity = `/.pixel-agents/hooks/claude-hook.js` suffix anchored at both ends of the command's first token, case-insensitive; `areHooksInstalled` = ANY of our commands on ANY event)
      consentCopy.ts                 Claude's first-run consent disclosure text (scope/data/undo), served through consentDisclosure()
      constants.ts                   Claude hook event names, script path
      hooks/claude-hook.ts           Hook script (CJS+shebang, bundled to dist/hooks/claude-hook.js)
    providers/hook/consentGate.ts    Provider-agnostic consent POLICY: when to ask (hooksConsentRequest per provider) and what an answer means (consentActionFor(choice, {installed, consent}) — see docs/adr/0001)
    providers/hook/consentExecutor.ts Provider-agnostic consent EXECUTION: applyConsentChoice(providerId, choice, ConsentEffects) runs the six actions in one order for both surfaces, and SERIALIZES answers per process across ALL providers
    providers/index.ts               Provider registry (claudeProvider + the hookProviders list the consent gate loops over)
    agentRuntime.ts                  Lifecycle core: timers, scanners, HookEventHandler, SessionRouter, DismissalTracker
    agentStateStore.ts               EventEmitter-backed single source of truth (typed mutations + events)
    sessionRouter.ts                 session_id → agent_id mapping, event buffering, pending external sessions
    dismissalTracker.ts              Unified dismissal state (replaces four legacy globals)
    hookEventHandler.ts              Dispatches normalized AgentEvent into runtime
    httpServer.ts                    Fastify: POST /api/hooks/:providerId, GET /api/health, GET /ws, SPA (standalone)
    clientMessageHandler.ts          Single dispatch point for ClientMessage from webview
    server.ts                        Top-level composition
    cli.ts                           npx pixel-agents entry (npm bin)
    fileStateAdapter.ts              Namespaced ~/.pixel-agents/ persistence
    configPersistence.ts             { vscode, standalone, externalAssetDirectories, hooksConsent: {providerId: granted|declined}, hooksEnabled: {providerId: boolean} }
    layoutPersistence.ts             ~/.pixel-agents/layout.json with atomic tmp+rename
    fileWatcher.ts                   Hybrid fs.watch + 500ms polling, JSONL line buffering, /clear detection
    transcriptParser.ts              JSONL parsing for heuristic / file-fallback mode
