# Working on ConLeche

Read DESIGN.md first — it holds the design decisions, verification style, and
iteration protocol. Keep it up to date when decisions change.

* Build: `lake build` (must stay warning-free) — and `lake test` must be
  warning-free too: it builds the test library, which `lake build` does
  not, so a warning there is invisible to the build gate. Tests: `lake test`
  (`tests/ConLecheTests.lean`, `#guard`/`example`-based, fails at build time).
* `OVERVIEW.md`'s and `README.md`'s line-anchored links are gated by
  `tests/overview-links.sh` (run from `tests/arena.sh` and CI): if you move
  or change linked lines, re-read the citing paragraph and run
  `tests/overview-links.sh --update`.  `README.md` is the maintainer's,
  human-written: an agent may turn an existing code name into a link or
  repoint one that rotted, and may change no other character of it.
* The same two documents' quoted code is gated by `tests/quote-gate.sh`
  (also from `tests/arena.sh` and CI): every fenced ```lean block headed
  by `theorem <name>`/`def <name>` must match the source's statement
  TEXTUALLY (indentation included). There is no `--update` — the source
  is the truth; the fix is to re-sync the quote, which an agent may do
  (the README's prose around it stays the maintainer's).
* Goal: the lean kernel arena tutorial tests (without custom axioms) are
  accepted and the checker is verified consistent.
* Iterate one feature at a time; every feature lands together with its
  verification and regression tests. Commit often.
* No `sorry`s on master; no new axioms. Consistency proofs stay parametric in
  the `SetTheory` interface.
* Layering: implementation (`ConLeche/Kernel/*`, `ConLeche/Cached/*`,
  `Main.lean`) must never import theory/verification modules
  (`ConLeche/SetTheory/*`, `ConLeche/SetModel/*`, `ConLeche/Semantics/*`,
  `ConLeche/Model/*`, `ConLeche/Verify/*`). Proofs about kernel functions go in
  `ConLeche/Verify/*`; the pure set constructions (no `Expr` in sight) in
  `ConLeche/SetModel/*`; the Expr-facing denotation and claims in
  `ConLeche/Semantics/*`; the graded set model and the consistency proofs in
  `ConLeche/Model/*`.
  Inductive installation has its own directory per layer
  (`Kernel/Inductives/*`, `Verify/Inductives/*`, `Semantics/Inductives/*`,
  `Model/Inductives/*`); the two routes there are the NATIVE one (the ONE
  fixpoint route, task #210 — `checkNative`, `Native*.lean`, with the
  `Struct*`/`Sum*` stage kits it builds on) and the MODELED one
  (`Kernel/Inductives/Modeled.lean`, `checkModeled`, for mutual and
  nested blocks).
  Exception (2026-08-24): a *self-contained* verification of a data
  structure (e.g. the arena's WF — invariants + preservation proofs
  importing no other Model/Verify modules) may live with, and be
  imported by, the implementation — the Std.HashMap pattern: the
  structure carries its invariant; downstream never re-proves it.
* The module system (task #231): every `.lean` file under `ConLeche/`,
  the roots and `tests/*` carries the `module` header.  A `module` may
  not import a non-`module`, so the tree converts as a whole and stays
  that way; `_probe/*`, `scripts/*.lean` and `bridge/*` are outside the
  build and stay classic (a classic file may import a `module`).
  **Checker code is exposed, because it is the subject of the proofs**:
  `ConLeche/Kernel/*`, `ConLeche/Cached/*`, `ConLeche/Frontend/*` and
  `Main.lean` open one `@[expose] public section` — the Verify/Model
  tiers unfold their bodies by design, so a `private` helper there must
  be public if any *definition* mentions it (a `theorem` proof may
  still use one: proofs are private regardless).  **Proof code is
  private by default**: `Model/*` and `Verify/*` (and the tests and
  capstones) open a plain `public section`, so their `def` bodies are
  private and `@[expose]` appears only where the compiler asked — on a
  definition another file unfolds.  `Term/*`, `SetTheory/*`,
  `SetModel/*` and `Semantics/*` keep the blanket for the same reason
  the checker does: the tiers above reason about them definitionally.
  Two traps when you re-privatise: a `private` lemma's `match` matcher
  is not reused, so a `rw` elsewhere stops finding its pattern; and
  moving a `@[simp]` lemma's proof from `:= rfl` to `:= by rfl` costs
  it its `rfl`-status and `simp only` silently stops firing — expose
  what it unfolds instead.  Imports narrow the same way: a
  `public import` is for a re-export something else's PUBLIC statement
  needs, and the plan for that is computed, not guessed
  (`scripts/pub-import-plan.py` over `scripts/pub-iface.lean` and the
  census) — a missing re-export does NOT say "unknown identifier", it
  makes a `rfl` stop closing.  `import all X` is the escape for a
  representation that is sealed on purpose — `ConLeche/Kernel/PropWhen`
  (the datum's API and laws are its whole interface) and `Init.Util`'s
  `withPtrEq` — and nothing else; each site carries the reason.
  Elaboration-time code (`Kernel/BasisGen`, `PinGen/*`, the pin and
  basis splices) is `meta`: `meta section`, `public meta import`, and a
  module needed at BOTH levels is imported twice (`public import X` +
  `meta import X`).  A term-mode `theorem … := rfl` is elaborated in
