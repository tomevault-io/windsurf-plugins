# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Drupal 11 site focused on the New England Patriots Dynasty, featuring content about games, players, podcast episodes, highlights, and timeline events. The site uses a custom Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI theme and includes custom modules for Dynasty-specific functionality.

## Development Environment

### DDEV Setup
The project uses DDEV for local development:

```bash
# Start the environment
ddev start

# Stop the environment
ddev stop

# SSH into the web container
ddev ssh

# Access database
ddev mysql
```

Project URL: https://dynasty9.ddev.site (or http://dynasty9.ddev.site)

### Environment Details
- **Drupal Version**: 11.x
- **PHP Version**: 8.3
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0
