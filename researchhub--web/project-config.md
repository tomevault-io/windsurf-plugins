 # ResearchHub Project Structure Guidelines

This document outlines the structure and organization of the ResearchHub codebase to help ensure consistency and maintainability.

## Directory Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js 15 application structure with TypeScript:

- `app/` - Contains the App Router and related components (Next.js 15 page structure)
- `pages/` - Contains the legacy Pages Router components
- `components/` - Contains reusable UI components
  - `ui/` - Contains base UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
  - `[Feature]/` - Feature-specific components (organized by domain)
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `utils/` - Helper functions and utilities
- `services/` - API service functions
- `contexts/` - React context providers
- `public/` - Static assets
- `store/` - State management
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `constants/` - Application constants and configuration

## Naming Conventions

Follow these naming conventions throughout the codebase:

1. **Files and Directories**:
   - React components: PascalCase (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `UserProfile.tsx`)
   - Utility files: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`, `apiHelpers.ts`)
   - Test files: Same name as the file being tested with `.test` or `.spec` (e.g., `Button.test.tsx`)

2. **Component Organization**:
   - Group related components in feature-specific directories
   - Place shared/generic UI components in the `components/ui/` directory
   - Create index files for easier imports

## Import Order

Maintain a consistent import order in all files:

1. React and Next.js imports
2. Third-party library imports
3. Component imports
4. Hook imports
5. Utility/helper imports
6. Type imports
7. Asset imports (styles, images, etc.)

## Code Organization

- Keep files reasonably sized (aim for <300 lines where possible)
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Extract complex or reusable UI elements into dedicated components

## Path Aliases

Use the configured path aliases to maintain clean imports:

- `@/components` - For component imports
- `@/hooks` - For hook imports
- `@/utils` - For utility imports
- `@/types` - For type imports
- etc.

This structure ensures code is organized logically and consistently throughout the project.
