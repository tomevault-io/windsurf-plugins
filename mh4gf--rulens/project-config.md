# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Rulens is a CLI tool for extracting, documenting, and formatting linting rules from various linting tools (currently supporting Biome and ESLint). It generates comprehensive Markdown documentation to help developers understand and follow the project's coding standards.

## Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: Always read all documentation in the `docs/` directory at the start of each session. This includes:
- `docs/lint-rules.md` - Explains linting rules and coding standards
- `docs/requirements.md` - Project requirements and technical specifications
- `docs/todos.md` - Task tracking for project implementation (CRITICAL to understand and update)
- Any additional files in the `docs/` directory

Pay special attention to `docs/todos.md` as it provides a clear roadmap of implemented features and pending tasks. Always update this file when implementing new features to reflect progress accurately.

## Commands

- Build: `pnpm build` - Build the project using tsup
- Dev: `pnpm dev` - Watch mode for development
- Format: `pnpm fmt` - Run all formatters (syncpack, biome)
- Lint: `pnpm lint` - Run all linters (biome, tsc, syncpack) - Run after making changes
- Test: `pnpm test` - Run all tests
- Single test: `pnpm test path/to/test.ts` - Run specific test
- Test with watch: `pnpm test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- Coverage: `pnpm test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- Changeset: `pnpm changeset` - Create a new changeset (always write in English)

**Workflow Commands**:
Always run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` after implementing new features to verify your changes.

## Coding Guidelines

- **IMPORTANT**: Always follow @docs/lint-rules.md as coding guideline
- **File Structure**: Place tests alongside implementation files (e.g., foo.ts, foo.test.ts)
- **Type Safety**: Avoid eslint-disable directives and type assertions (as keyword), use valibot for runtime type validation
- **External Data**: Handle all external data (JSON, API responses) as untrusted and validate with valibot
- **Logging**: Use the Logger class instead of console.log/error for consistent logging
- **Comments**: Follow these guidelines for code comments:
  - Use JSDoc style comments for functions, classes, and interfaces
  - Write comments that explain "why" not "what" the code is doing
  - Avoid redundant comments that merely restate the code
  - Don't use comments for code organization or section markers; structure your code instead
  - Document non-obvious behavior, complex algorithms, or business rules
  - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
  - Use English for all comments

## Testing Strategy

- **Pure Function Testing**: Focus on testing pure functions without mocks or external dependencies
  - If a function has external dependencies (filesystem, network, etc.), consider refactoring to extract pure logic
  - When function purity is low, focus tests on the pure parts rather than using complex mocks
- **Real Environment Testing**: Avoid using mocks. Test with real dependencies whenever possible to ensure tests validate actual behavior.
- **Avoid Mocking Libraries**: Never use `vi.mock` or `vi.spyOn` - prioritize real implementation testing.
- **Test Quality Priorities**: Focus on "correctly executing functionality" and "bug detection" rather than just "tests passing".
- **TDD Approach**: Follow test-driven development when appropriate:
  - Write failing tests first with `it.skip` to clearly define expected behavior
  - Implement code to make tests pass
  - Refactor and optimize
  - Remove `skip` as tests start passing
- **Concrete Assertions**: Use specific value assertions instead of general type checks
  - Prefer `expect(result).toContain("specific/value")` over just checking array length or type
  - Use `.toMatchSnapshot()` for testing large outputs like command results
- **Test Edge Cases**: Always include tests for error conditions and edge cases
- **Independent Tests**: Ensure each test runs independently and doesn't depend on other tests

## Error Handling

- **Functional Error Handling**: Use `neverthrow` for functional error handling patterns
  - Return `Result<T, E>` types rather than throwing exceptions
  - Use `fromThrowable` to convert functions that might throw to Result-returning functions
  - Handle `Result` types with `.match()`, `.map()`, or `isOk()`/`isErr()` checks
  - When calling code that returns a Result, check for success with `.isOk()` before accessing `.value`
- **Error Messages**: Use descriptive error messages that explain what went wrong
- **Complex Functions**: Break complex functions into smaller ones to reduce cognitive complexity
  - Extract separate helper functions for loading, parsing, and handling results
  - Use dependency injection for improved testability
  - Aim to keep cognitive complexity below 15 per function

## TypeScript Best Practices

- **Type Imports**: Use `import type` for type-only imports
- **Avoid Type Assertions**: Instead of using `as any`, create proper type definitions
- **Handle null/undefined**: Use explicit type annotations for null/undefined values
