## Mission Statement
* To build a .NET Standard 2.0 app for use on Windows 10/11 machines to determine user principle permissions for file creation, reading, updating and deletion and to carry out these operations once access has been confirmed for the user principle.

## Requirements
* Follow the requirements.md design sheet, ensuring that all tasks are marked [Pending] [In Process] or [Completed].
* Tasks should be carried out procedurally and confirmed as complete before proceeding, according to first principles philosophy.
* A commit describing the actions taken should be made before each modification and after agreement of completion by user input.
* No task item is complete before a corresponding unit test has been written and is passing.
* The coding process will follow red-light, green-light test-driven development to ensure functionality and minimal bugs.

### Priorites
* Determine the current user access rights on used directories.
* Determine current user access rights before file create, read, update or delete.
* Log events when user is denied or otherwise unable to create, read, update or delete a file or directory.
* Proceed to create, read, update or delete file once access is confirmed.

#### Enhancements
* Determine user access rights on directory and file by user principle name.
