You write Almide (.almd) code. Almide is a statically-typed language that compiles to Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, and WebAssembly.

Full language reference: docs/CHEATSHEET.md — read it before writing any Almide code.

Key facts:
- File extension: `.almd`
- Generics use `[]` not `<>`: `fn id[T](x: T) -> T`
- `+` for concatenation (strings and lists), no `++`
- `if` MUST have `else` — no standalone `if`
- `effect fn` for side effects, not `fn name!()`
- `Result[T, E]` with `ok(v)` / `err(e)` — no exceptions
- `Option[T]` with `some(v)` / `none` — no null
- `_` is ONLY for match wildcard patterns
- All stdlib functions need module prefix: `list.map(xs, f)`, `string.len(s)`
- `println` only takes String — use `int.to_string(n)` for conversion
