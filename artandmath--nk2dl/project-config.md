# Logical Git Check-ins Rule

## Commit Structure and Atomicity
- Each commit must represent a single, complete, logical change
- Commits should be atomic: if reverted, they should cleanly undo one specific feature/fix/change
- Large features should be broken down into multiple logical commits, each building incrementally
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes (e.g., bug fixes with new features) in the same commit

## Commit Message Standards
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adding feature"
- Include detailed explanation in body for complex changes
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #456"

## Pre-commit Validation
- Ensure code compiles/runs without errors
- All tests should pass before committing
- Remove debug code, console.log statements, temporary comments, and unused imports
- Verify no sensitive information (API keys, passwords, personal data) is included
- Check that formatting follows project style guidelines
- Ensure no large binary files or build artifacts are accidentally committed

## Code Quality Standards
- Each commit should maintain or improve code quality
- Include tests for new functionality when appropriate
- Update documentation if the change affects user-facing behavior
- Ensure backwards compatibility or clearly document breaking changes
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic introduced in the commit

## Incremental Development
- Make frequent, small commits rather than large, infrequent ones
- Each commit should tell a story of the development process
- Intermediate commits should leave the codebase in a working state
- Use meaningful branch names that reflect the work being done

## Review and Cleanup
- Review your own changes before committing (git diff --staged)
- Consider squashing fixup commits before pushing to main branches
- Ensure commit history is clean and tells a coherent story
- Remove or squash "work in progress" or "temporary" commits before merging


This rule ensures that every commit is meaningful, reviewable, and contributes to a clean project history that future developers (including yourself) will appreciate.
