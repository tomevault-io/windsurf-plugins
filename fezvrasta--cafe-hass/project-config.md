## Coding Guidelines

- **Never use IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) in React components or TypeScript files.**
  - Always extract logic into a named component or custom hook instead of using IIFEs.
  - Use plain variables or helper functions for local logic, but prefer components for UI logic.
  - IIFEs are forbidden in all React and TypeScript code.

# Project Overview

**C.A.F.E.** (Complex Automation Flow Editor) is a visual flow editor for Home Assistant automations, inspired by Node-RED. It allows users to design automations as diagrams and transpiles them to 100% native Home Assistant YAML—no vendor lock-in. Automations remain editable in HA’s built-in editor.

# Repository Structure

```
cafe-hass/
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/          # @cafe/shared - Types and Zod schemas
│   ├── frontend/        # @cafe/frontend - React UI (Vite + Tailwind)
│   └── transpiler/      # @cafe/transpiler - YAML parser/generator
├── custom_components/cafe/  # Home Assistant integration (Python)
└── .github/workflows/       # CI/CD pipelines
```

# Package Descriptions

- **@cafe/shared**: Zod schemas, TypeScript types, validation utilities
- **@cafe/frontend**: React 18 + XYFlow canvas + Zustand state + Radix UI
- **@cafe/transpiler**: YAML parsing, topology analysis, transpilation strategies

# Key Domains/Features

- Flow Canvas (trigger, condition, action, delay, wait nodes)
- YAML Parsing & Transpilation (YamlParser, FlowTranspiler)
- Home Assistant Integration (WebSocket API, entity/device/service registry)
- Simulation & Trace Visualization
- Property Editing Panels

# Build System & Tooling

- Yarn 4 workspaces + Turbo for orchestration
- TypeScript 5.7 with strict mode
- Vite for frontend builds
- Vitest for testing, make sure to use the --run flag to avoid issues with watch mode
- Biome for linting, and for formatting

# Coding Conventions

In addition to strict TypeScript rules:

- **Zod for Schema Validation**: All data structures use Zod schemas in `@cafe/shared`
- **Zustand for State**: Single cohesive store pattern in `flow-store.ts`
- **React Patterns**: Use `memo()` for nodes, `cn()` for class merging, and typed NodeProps
- **Import Aliases**: `@/` for frontend, `@cafe/*` for packages

# Common Commands

```bash
yarn dev          # Watch mode
yarn build        # Build all packages
yarn build:ha     # Build + copy to custom_components
yarn test         # Run tests
yarn typecheck    # Type checking
yarn lint:biome   # Linting
```

# Development Guidelines

## Release and Commit Policy

**IMPORTANT**: Never cut a new release or commit changes without first asking the user for permission.

Always ask before:

- Creating git commits
- Pushing changes to the repository
- Bumping version numbers
- Creating new releases/tags
- Running any git operations that modify the repository

The user should have full control over when changes are committed and released.

## TypeScript Code Quality

**STRICT TYPING REQUIRED**: Always maintain strict TypeScript types throughout the codebase.

**FORBIDDEN PRACTICES**:

- Never use `as` type assertions unless absolutely necessary for external API boundaries
- Never use `any` type - use proper type definitions or `unknown` with type guards
- Avoid type casting hacks or workarounds
- Don't suppress TypeScript errors with `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error`

**REQUIRED PRACTICES**:

- Define proper interfaces and types for all data structures
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Leverage TypeScript's strict mode features
- Create proper type definitions for external libraries if needed
- Use generic types appropriately for reusable components

The codebase should compile with zero TypeScript errors and maintain type safety throughout.

# Best Practices

## Code Reusability (DRY) - VITAL AND MANDATORY

**⚠️ THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENT ⚠️**

**ZERO TOLERANCE FOR CODE DUPLICATION.** Every single piece of duplicated code is a violation of this project's core principles. Before writing ANY code, you MUST check if similar logic already exists and reuse it.

**MANDATORY PRACTICES**:

- **Helper Functions/Utilities**: Extract common logic into reusable helper functions or utility modules. If you write the same logic twice, you have failed.
- **Generic Components**: Design React components to be as generic and reusable as possible, accepting props to customize behavior and appearance. Components MUST be designed for reuse from the start.
- **Shared Types/Schemas**: Leverage `@cafe/shared` for all common types, interfaces, and Zod schemas to ensure consistency and avoid duplication across `frontend` and `transpiler`.
- **Custom Hooks**: For shared stateful logic in React, create custom hooks. ANY repeated stateful pattern MUST become a hook.
- **Before Writing Code**: ALWAYS search the codebase first to check if similar functionality exists. Reuse and extend existing code rather than creating new duplicates.
- **Refactor Immediately**: If you discover existing duplication while working, refactor it into a shared abstraction before proceeding.

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - VIOLATIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED**:
