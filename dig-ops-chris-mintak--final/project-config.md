# Project: AI-Powered Invoice Workflow Automation

Digital Operations Lab project (HBS, Prof. Moreno). Two-person team: Mintak (tech lead) and Chris (research lead).

## Key Files

- `PLAN.md` — master plan with phased TODO checklists and task ownership
- `idea.md` — project proposal with central question and process redesign
- `course_project.md` — course rubric and requirements

## Structure

- `phase1-research/` — as-is process, market research, technology research
- `phase2-design/` — to-be process, architecture, wireframes, AI prompts
- `phase3-analysis/` — economic model, operational analysis, adoption plan
- `phase4-prototype/` — Next.js web app (Tailwind + shadcn/ui + SQLite + Claude API)
- `presentation/` — slide deck and assets
- `admin/` — progress report, meeting notes

## Conventions

- All docs in markdown unless otherwise noted
- File names: lowercase, hyphens for spaces (e.g., `as-is-process-map.md`)
- Saved web sources: `YYYY-MM-DD_source-name_description.pdf` in `saved-sources/`
- Research docs must cite sources with links
- Prototype tech stack: Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + SQLite + Claude API + SendGrid

## Task Number in File/Directory Names (MANDATORY)

Every file and directory created for a task MUST include the task number from PLAN.md as a prefix. This applies to ALL future work.

**Format**: `t{number}-{descriptive-name}.md` or `t{number}-{directory-name}/`

**Examples**:
- `t1.5-competitor-analysis.md` (single task)
- `t1.6-industry-stats.md` (single task)
- `t2.3-t2.4-system-architecture.md` (covers two tasks — both numbers included)
- `t4.1-scaffold/` (directory for a task)

**Rules**:
- If a file covers multiple tasks, include ALL task numbers: `t3.2-t3.3-economic-model.md`
- The task number comes FIRST, before the descriptive name
- Use dot notation matching PLAN.md (e.g., `t1.5`, `t2.3`, `t4.1`)
- This applies to research docs, design docs, analysis docs, prototype directories, and any other deliverable
- Do NOT rename `PLAN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `idea.md`, or `course_project.md` — these are project-level files, not task deliverables

## Deadlines

- Apr 15: Progress report (Canvas)
- Apr 22: Showcase (10-min presentation)
- Apr 25: Final submission by 5pm (PDF deck + peer polls)
