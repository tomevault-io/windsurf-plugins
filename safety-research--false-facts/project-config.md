description: - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.

Key principles
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).


Python
- Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures. We use dict, |, list, tuple, | None instead of typing.Dict, typing.Union, typing.List, typing.Tuple, typing.Optional.
- Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries or dataclasses for input validation.
  - The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead. Deprecated in Pydantic V2.0 to be removed in V3.0.
- Import at the top of the file.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).


Ruff
- Your code will be Ruff-formatted afterwards.
- We don't care about: E501 (line too long), E402 (module level import not at top of file), E741 (ambiguous variable name), F841 (local variable name is assigned to but never used), F403 (import star).


LLM API requests
- We use `InferenceAPI` from the `safetytooling` library to make requests to LLMs.
- The LLM query results are automatically cached. Take note of the `seed` parameter in `InferenceAPI.ask_single_question`.
- By default, use `tqdm.gather` without batches around async coroutines that involve making LLM requests.
- Note the proper format for the prompt. It's Prompt(messages=[ChatMessage(role=MessageRole.system, content="..."), ChatMessage(role=MessageRole.assistant, content="..."), ...]). The `role` field is an enum from `safetytooling.apis.inference.openai.types`. 

Models
- The default model to debug code (in the sense that "does the code even run?") is `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`. By default, use this in tests.
  - If the LLM cognition required in the test is more demanding, use `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` instead.
- The default model to run any experiment where we want to get a sense of what the model is doing is `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`.
- Any sample commands you write should be for one of the above models. Do not use other models when writing sample commands.
- Other models we will be interested in are `claude-3-opus-20240229` and `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`.


Rules for Cursor
- Datasets
  - Inspect the dataset schema before writing code that processes it.

- Cursor Composer
  - When outputting code that is to be run by the user in agent mode, do not include comments. zsh will error out if you try to run code that contains comments.
