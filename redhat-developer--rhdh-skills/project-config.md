# AGENTS.md

Agent Skills for Red Hat Developer Hub engineering, operations, and repository
maintenance. Skills follow the Agent Skills open standard. Read `CONTEXT.md`
for domain language and `docs/adr/` for architectural decisions.

## 1. Think Before Coding

Do not assume or hide confusion.

- State assumptions explicitly.
- Surface multiple interpretations and tradeoffs.
- Prefer the simpler approach when it satisfies the request.
- Stop and ask when ambiguity would materially change the result.

## 2. Simplicity First

Write the minimum code that solves the requested problem.

- Add no speculative features or single-use abstractions.
- Keep CLI implementation stdlib-only except for the documented PEP 723 YAML
  exception in ADR-0002.
- If a change can be substantially smaller without losing behavior, simplify it.

## 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what the request requires. Preserve unrelated work and match the
existing style. Remove only the imports, variables, functions, or files made
obsolete by your own change.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Translate the request into observable success criteria and verify them. Run
`uv run pytest` before reporting repository work complete.

## 5. No Irreversible Commands Without Confirmation

Never force-push, reset HEAD, merge branches, or run destructive commands
without explicit confirmation.

## 6. Learn From Corrections

When an implementation is corrected, apply the correction and record reusable
project-specific knowledge in the owning skill reference.

## Skill architecture

Skills are grouped by domain: `skills/jira/`, `skills/plugins/`, `skills/ci/`,
`skills/release/`, `skills/reference/`, `skills/meta/`. Those folders are
editorial and are stripped at install. Compose through `/skill-name`, never
through sibling category paths.

A promoted skill claims exactly one trigger phrase. Two skills that would claim
the same utterance are one skill; one skill answering several unrelated
utterances is several skills. Split by verb, never by noun, and weight the split
by what a misroute costs — merge where a misroute produces a wrong write, split
where it produces an obvious wrong answer. See ADR-0005.

Human invocation is a class, not a roster. A human-invoked skill is an entry
point a person types by name, and the router never reaches it. Every member
carries `disable-model-invocation: true` in `SKILL.md` and
`policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`. Admit a new
one only when it holds no substance of its own and delegates to exactly one
model-invoked skill, the way `clean-prose` delegates to `prose-editing`;
`ask-rhdh` and `setup-rhdh-skills` are the other members today. Every other
promoted skill is model-invoked and omits both flags. Every promoted skill has
an `agents/openai.yaml` interface entry.

The complete pack also requires two external skills. Creation and interview
flows use `/grilling`; `/handoff` carries context into a later session, which is
why no artifact store does.

Keep drafts and retired skills outside the promoted discovery root:

- `internal/in-progress/`
- `internal/deprecated/`

Do not add them to promoted manifests or catalogs.

## Composition contracts

- `/ask-rhdh` is a catalog, not an orchestrator. It recommends a named skill
  and performs no setup or mutation.
- `/setup-rhdh-skills` owns setup routing, configuration, authentication, and
  compatibility with existing CLI/state locations.
- Credentials stay inside an authenticated adapter backed by a native tool
  store or host connector. Workflow instructions and non-adapter scripts may
  detect capability, but only that adapter may retrieve a transient credential
  and authenticate a request. Public arguments, output, logs, plans, and
  artifacts remain credential-free. Setup owns login and never creates a
  parallel credential store.
- `/rhdh-context` owns shared repository and version context.
- `/prose-editing` owns the prose pass. The final composer invokes it exactly
  once for free-form GitHub, GitLab, Jira, or Slack prose before anybody sees,
  gates, or posts that text. The caller names the register because it knows what
  it wrote. Helpers invoke it only when they return the final prose directly;
  transport layers never do. Structured payloads, fixed commands, checksums,
  generated reports, and local documents with an owning authoring skill stay
  outside this automatic pass.
- Skills pass context by invoking each other by name. There is no artifact
  envelope and no artifact store. When the user needs context to survive into a
  later session, tell them to run `/handoff`.
- Every external write goes through the write gate in `/mutation-gate`:
  state each operation with its target, exact command, preview, and failure
  behaviour; get approval for that stated set; execute; report the outcome of
  every operation, including the skipped ones. The plan renders as a table in
  the conversation. A plan too large for the transcript goes to a file in the
  temporary directory and the path is printed. Read-only inspection needs no
  gate. See ADR-0007.
- `/rhdh-forge` constructs forge payloads and never executes them. A caller that
  needs a write receives a command, not an effect.
