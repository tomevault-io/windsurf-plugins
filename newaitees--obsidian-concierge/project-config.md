### 2. Leveraging Type Systems
**Document: "Static Typing Best Practices"**

Using type systems helps catch errors early and makes code more self-documenting:

- **Thorough Static Typing**: 
  - *What it means*: Add type annotations to your variables, functions, and classes.
  - *How to implement*: In Python, use type hints (e.g., `def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:`).
  - *Example*: 
    ```python
    def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
        """Retrieve a user by their ID."""
        return User.objects.get(id=user_id)
    ```
  - *Why it matters*: Catches type-related errors before runtime and serves as built-in documentation.

- **Type Aliases and Custom Types**: 
  - *What it means*: Create named types for complex data structures.
  - *How to implement*: Use `TypeAlias` or similar constructs to define custom types.
  - *Example*: 
    ```python
    from typing import Dict, List, TypeAlias
    
    UserID = int
    UserData = Dict[str, str]
    UserList = List[UserData]
    ```
  - *Why it matters*: Improves code readability and ensures consistent use of complex types.

- **Pydantic Integration**: 
  - *What it means*: Use Pydantic models to validate data structures.
  - *How to implement*: Define Pydantic models for your data structures, especially API requests/responses.
  - *Example*: 
    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    
    class UserCreate(BaseModel):
        username: str
        email: str
        password: str
    ```
  - *Why it matters*: Automatically validates data, generates documentation, and provides clear error messages.

- **Continuous Type Checking with mypy**: 
  - *What it means*: Regularly check your codebase for type errors.
  - *How to implement*: Set up mypy in your development environment and CI/CD pipeline.
  - *Example*: Add a CI step that runs `mypy --strict your_package/`.
  - *Why it matters*: Catches type errors automatically before they reach production.
