# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Bellatrix combines two pinned upstream submodules: `external/emu68/` and
`external/aros/`. Do not edit either submodule in place. Upstream changes belong
in numbered patches under `patches/emu68/` or `patches/aros/`; project-owned AROS
port code lives in `aros/arch/m68k-emu68/` and is symlinked into the AROS tree by
the setup script. Build and image tooling is in `scripts/`, cross-compilation
configuration is in `cmake/`, and technical notes are in `docs/`. Generated
artifacts go under the ignored `out/` directory. Use `AI_context/` for issue,
specification, and consolidated investigation records.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `./scripts/setup.sh`: initialize submodules, apply patch series, and install
  project-owned symlinks.
- `./scripts/setup.sh --verify`: confirm submodules are pristine and correctly
  patched; use this instead of relying on `git status` inside submodules.
- `./scripts/build.sh`: build Emu68 incrementally into `out/images/Emu68.img`.
- `./scripts/build-aros.sh`: build the AROS ELF. Keep this build serial; its
  generated headers and cross-toolchain stages are not safe under `make -j`.
- `./scripts/make-sdcard.sh`: create `out/aros/sd.img`.
- `./run.sh --headless`: build as needed and boot under QEMU using serial I/O.

Pass `clean` to either build script for a clean build. See `README.md` for host
dependencies and additional run options.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Write code, comments, documentation, and commits in English. Follow nearby AROS
C and assembly conventions: four-space indentation, braces on their own line
for functions, descriptive `snake_case` functions, and uppercase constants.
Shell scripts use Bash, `set -euo pipefail`, quoted expansions, and uppercase
configuration variables. Keep patches narrowly scoped and numbered with a
four-digit prefix, for example `0004-fix-description.patch`.

## Testing Guidelines

There is no repository-wide unit-test harness or coverage target. At minimum,
run `./scripts/setup.sh --verify`, rebuild the affected image, and smoke-test it
with `./run.sh --headless`. For boot or graphics changes, capture the relevant
serial output and also verify the GUI path when applicable. Document hardware-
only validation or known gaps in the pull request.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

History follows short, imperative Conventional Commit subjects such as
`build: add SD image` and `fix(run): show the framebuffer`. Keep each commit to
one logical change. Pull requests should explain the motivation, identify the
affected patch or port area, list exact validation commands, link relevant
issues, and include logs or screenshots when runtime behavior changes.
