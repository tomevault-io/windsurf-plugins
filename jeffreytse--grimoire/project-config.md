# grimoire

Multi-domain skill collection for AI assistants. Skills work across Claude Code, Codex,
Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and more.

## Skill Path Convention

All skill paths follow this pattern:
```
<domain>/<subdomain>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

If a task matches a skill, invoke it. Never implement directly when a skill applies.
