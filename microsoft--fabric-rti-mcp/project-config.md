# Project Coding Guidelines

This document outlines the coding standards, architectural patterns, and best practices for this Project's codebase. 
It's designed to help new engineers quickly understand our approach and contribute effectively to the project.

## Project Overview

Fabric RTI MCP is an MCP server that exposes Fabric RTI functionality as tools that can be used by agents.


## Code Style and Formatting

### Python Version

- Python 3.10 is required for this project

### Formatting

- We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting with a line length of 120 characters
- Run `black .` before committing to ensure consistent formatting

### Imports

- Group imports in the following order:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party library imports
  3. Project imports
- Within each group, use alphabetical ordering
- Use absolute imports for project modules (e.g. `package.submodule.module`), not relative imports (e.g. `..module`)
- Never use wildcard imports (e.g. `from package import *`)

Example:
```python
import abc
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Optional, Dict

import numpy as np
from termcolor import colored

from fabric_rti_mcp.kusto import KustoService
```

### Type Annotations

- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use generics (TypeVar) when appropriate
- Prefer composition of simple types over complex nested types
- Prefer built-in/primitive container types (e.g. `list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`) over `typing` aliases (e.g. `List[str]`, `Dict[str, Any]`)
 - Prefer union syntax for optionals (e.g. `str | None`) over `Optional[str]`

Example:
```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")

def get_tasks_with_status(status_type: str, project_id: Optional[str] = None) -> List[int]:
    """Get tasks with a specific status type."""
    # Implementation
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Functions/Methods**: `snake_case`
- **Variables**: `snake_case`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Private members**: Prefix with underscore (`_private_method`)
- **Type variables**: Single uppercase letter or `PascalCase` with descriptive name

### Comments and TODOs

- Use TODOs to mark areas that need improvement, but include specific details about what needs to be done
- For complex algorithms or non-obvious code, include explanatory comments
- Avoid commented-out code in the main branch

### Documentation
* DO NOT add obvious comments that repeat the code. Instead, focus on explaining the "why" behind complex logic or design decisions.
* DO NOT add top-level docstrings for modules or files. Focus on function / class docstrings instead.
* DO NOT add any other module-level documentation; keep documentation scoped to functions, classes, and methods.
* Be concise. Only document the bare minimum necessary to understand the code.

## Architecture & Design

### High-Level Structure
- The project is organized into modules, each responsible for a specific service (e.g., `kusto`, `eventstream`)
- Each `service` needs to declare it's tools under `{service_name}_tools.py`. Preferably, this would be a light wrapper around the service module named {service_name}_service.py.
- All logic should go to the service module (e.g., `kusto_service.py`), which contains the core functionality and business logic.
- If extra modules or classes are needed, make sure to split them out in a meaningful way (i.e., try and avoid `utils.py` or `helpers.py` files that contain unrelated functions).


### Development Guidelines
- At the moment, there is no service discovery mechanism for Fabric workspaces. As such, when creating a service, use the service's globally unique name such as FQN or URI.
- Make sure to properly document each tool's function, its arguments, and expected output. If the output is complex, show an example of the output format.
- Avoid using @tool decorator, prefer a bootstrapping function (`service_module.register_service(mcp_instance)`). This allows for better flexibility and decoupling.
- Minimize the number of tools. Too many tools confuse agents. Make sure each tool has a clear purpose and is not redundant with others.
- The current design is such that allows stateless hosting. Meaning, do not share state in-memory between tools. Assume that each tool invocation is stateless and independent. (this may change in the future, but for now, this is the design).
- Having said that, you can use environment variables to "store" configuration in an idempotent way. For example, if you want to configure a closed list of services to use, you can store them in an environment variable and read them in the tool. 
- Environment variables need to be namespaced to avoid conflicts. Use the `FABRIC_` general purpose configuration that is shared across all services.
- When stumbling upon a common pattern, do your best to extract it into a reusable common module. This will help reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
