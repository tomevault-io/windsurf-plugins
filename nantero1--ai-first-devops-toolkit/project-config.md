# Python Style Guide

This guide defines project-specific Python conventions based on Google Python Style Guide. We assume familiarity with standard Python practices and focus on our custom patterns.

## Foundation
- **Base Standard**: Google Python Style Guide with PEP 8
- **Readability counts** - Code is read more often than it is written
- **Consistency is key** - Follow these standards throughout the codebase
- **Line Length**: 120 characters (project preference)
- **PURPOSE Documentation**: Every file and class must explain its PURPOSE

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Class Documentation with purpose

Every class requires a purpose docstring:

```python
class PaymentProcessor:
    """Processes payments through multiple payment gateways.
    
    Provides unified interface for Stripe, PayPal, and Square payments.
    Handles validation, error handling, and transaction logging with
    automatic retry logic for failed transactions.
    
    Attributes:
        retry_attempts: Number of retries for failed transactions.
        supported_currencies: List of supported currency codes.
    """
```

### Error Handling Patterns

Use specific exception types with descriptive messages:

```python
from langchain_core.tools import ToolException

def process_data(data: str) -> dict:
    """Process user data with proper error handling."""
    try:
        result = external_service.process(data)
        LOGGER.info("Data processed successfully", data_size=len(data))
        return result
    except ValidationError as e:
        LOGGER.error("Validation failed", error=str(e), data=data)
        raise ToolException(f"Invalid data format: {e}")
    except ExternalServiceError as e:
        LOGGER.error("External service failed", service="processor", error=str(e))
        raise ToolException("Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again.")
```

Try to use fallbacks, we don't want to crash. Apply fallback mechanisms were appropriate.

## Comments

### Comment Style
- Use `#` followed by a space
- Write complete sentences with proper capitalization
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Comment only when the code is not self explanatory

### Testing Patterns

Follow our testing structure from `tests.mdc`:

```python
class TestMyComponent:
    """Tests for MyComponent class."""
    
    def test_basic_functionality(self, component):
        """Test basic component functionality."""
        # given
        input_data = "test input"
        
        # when
        result = component.process(input_data)
        
        # then
        assert result == "expected output"
    
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("input_data, expected", [
        pytest.param("input1", "output1", id="scenario1"),
        pytest.param("input2", "output2", id="scenario2"),
    ])
    def test_multiple_scenarios(self, input_data, expected):
        """Test multiple scenarios with different inputs."""
        # given
        component = ComponentUnderTest()
        
        # when
        result = component.process(input_data)
        
        # then
        assert result == expected
```

**Testing Guidelines:**
- Use Given-When-Then structure (mandatory)
- Leverage autouse fixtures (secrets, time, mocking)
- Group tests in classes by functionality
- Use descriptive test names explaining what is tested
- Don't manually mock what's auto-mocked (SecretsMixin, etc.)


### Domain Models

Use Pydantic for domain objects with proper field descriptions:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from datetime import datetime

class User(BaseModel):
    """Domain aggregate for user data and business logic."""
    
    id: str = Field(..., description="Unique user identifier")
    preferences: Dict[str, Any] = Field(
        default_factory=dict, 
        description="User preferences and settings"
    )
    created_at: datetime = Field(
        default_factory=datetime.now,
        description="User creation timestamp"
    )
    
    def has_active_subscription(self) -> bool:
        """Check if user has an active subscription."""
        return self.subscription is not None and self.subscription.is_active
```

## File Organization

### Import Order
```python
from __future__ import annotations

# Standard library
import os
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

# Third-party
import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# Project imports
from mixins.mixin_secrets import SecretsMixin
from our_utils.our_logger import get_formatted_logger
```

### Module Structure
```python
"""Brief description of module's business purpose."""

from __future__ import annotations

# Imports...

LOGGER = get_formatted_logger(__name__)

# Constants
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30

# Classes and functions...
```

## Key Principles

1. **PURPOSE-Driven**: Every file and class explains its business purpose
3. **Validation-Heavy**: Extensive Pydantic validation with examples
4. **Error-Specific**: Descriptive error messages with proper exception types
5. **Test-Structured**: Given-When-Then pattern with comprehensive coverage
6. **Async-Aware**: Proper async/sync patterns using our utilities
9. **Fallback-Mechanisms**: LOG the errors, but try to not crash, use sane fallbacks
10. **PEP 8 compliance** with modern Python best practicesons
11. **Performance-conscious** coding patterns
