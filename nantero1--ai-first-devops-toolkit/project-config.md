# PROJECT SYSTEM RULES

## CORE WORKFLOW
- Maintain `.cursor/memories.md`, `.cursor\rules\lessons-learned.mdc`, and `.cursor/scratchpad.md` for all interactions
- Use chain-of-thought reasoning for problems, cross-reference existing documentation
- Follow Mode System for task execution control

## MODE SYSTEM

### Plan Mode (trigger: "plan")
1. Create session in `.cursor/scratchpad.md`:
```
# Mode: PLAN 🎯
Current Task: [specific task from user input]
Understanding: [requirements and constraints]
Questions: [numbered list, minimum 3]
Confidence: [percentage based on unknowns]
Next Steps: [bullet points]
```
2. Generate clarifying questions until 95%+ confidence
3. Calculate and update confidence after each response

### Agent Mode (trigger: "agent")
**Activation Requirements:**
- Confidence ≥ 95%
- All questions answered
- Tasks defined in scratchpad
- No blocking issues

**Enabled Capabilities:**
- Code modifications with descriptive comments
- File operations and command execution
- System changes and scratchpad updates

## TASK MANAGEMENT

### Scratchpad Format (.cursor/scratchpad.md)
```
Current Phase: [PHASE-X]
Mode Context: [FROM_MODE_SYSTEM]
Status: [Active/Planning/Review]
Confidence: [percentage]
Last Updated: [version]

Tasks:
[ID-001] Description
Status: [X/[-]/[ ]/[!]/[?]] Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Dependencies: [blockers]
Progress Notes: [version] details
```

### Status Markers
- `[X]` Completed
- `[-]` In Progress  
- `[ ]` Planned
- `[!]` Blocked
- `[?]` Needs Review

## DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL

### Memories (.cursor/memories.md)
Update after every interaction with single-line entries:
- `[Version] Development:` Exhaustive description of changes, decisions, implementation details, and outcomes
- `[Version] Manual Update:` (when user uses "mems" keyword) Planning discussions, requirements, strategic decisions

### Lessons Learned (.cursor\rules\lessons-learned.mdc)
Format: `Category: Issue → Solution → Impact`
Categories: Component Development, Error Resolution, Performance, Security, Accessibility, Code Organization, Testing

### Phase Documentation
On completion, create `/docs/phases/PHASE-X/[FEATURE-NAME].md` with:
- Implemented components
- Technical decisions
- Code examples
- Best practices
- Lessons learned

## DEVELOPMENT RULES
- Keep all code comments (fix typos, adjust to new code, never remove)
- Add descriptive inline comments for long-term memory
- Use Pydantic models for type safety
- Follow established patterns (see memories for context)
- Ignore `./nodejs` folder (early stage)

## MODE TYPES
1. **Implementation**: New features - Plan → 95% confidence → Agent
2. **Bug Fix**: Issue resolution - Plan → Chain of thought → Agent
