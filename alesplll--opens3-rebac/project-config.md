# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is a monorepo for several gRPC services. Main code lives under `services/`: Go services in `services/auth`, `services/users`, and `services/storage`, plus the Python ReBAC service in `services/authz`. Shared protobuf sources are in `shared/api`, generated clients/stubs live in `shared/pkg/go` and `shared/pkg/py`, infrastructure lives in `infra/`, and cross-service docs are in `docs/`.

Go services follow the same layout: `cmd/server` for entrypoints and `internal/` for app, config, handlers, services, and repositories. AuthZ keeps runtime code in `entrypoints/` and `internal/`, with tests in `services/authz/tests/{unit,integration}`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `make up-services`: start local infrastructure and enabled services with Docker Compose.
- `make up-observability`: start Grafana, Prometheus, Jaeger, and related tooling.
- `make down` / `make down-volumes`: stop containers; the latter also removes persisted data.
- `make generate`: regenerate shared Go and Python protobuf bindings from `shared/api`.
- `go test ./...` from `services/auth`, `services/users`, or `services/storage`: run tests for one Go service module.
- `python3 -m pytest tests/unit -v` from `services/authz`: run AuthZ unit tests.
- `python3 -m pytest tests/integration -v -m integration` from `services/authz`: run Neo4j-backed integration tests.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use standard Go formatting (`gofmt`) and keep package names lowercase. Prefer the existing service layering (`handler`, `service`, `repository`) and place binaries only under `cmd/`. In Python, use 4-space indentation, `snake_case` for functions/modules, and keep gRPC service classes descriptive, for example `PermissionServiceServicer`.

Do not hand-edit generated protobuf files under `shared/pkg/`; regenerate them instead.

## Testing Guidelines

Keep Go tests close to the package they verify, using `*_test.go`. Current examples include handler and service tests under `services/users/internal/.../tests`. For AuthZ, use `tests/unit/test_*.py` for isolated logic and `tests/integration/test_*.py` for Neo4j-dependent flows. Mark integration tests with `@pytest.mark.integration`.

### Documentation Discipline

Documentation must be updated in the same change whenever the code changes the developer workflow or runtime expectations.

Update documentation when the change affects:

- project startup or local run flow
- Docker Compose usage, build contexts, or service dependencies
- ports, env vars, credentials, or required local tools
- `Makefile` commands, test commands, or generation commands
- repository structure that is referenced from onboarding or README
- first-run experience for a new contributor

At minimum, check whether the change also requires updates to:

- `README.md`
- `GETTING_STARTED.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- service-level README files under `services/*/README.md`

If a document is now partially outdated but a full rewrite is unnecessary, prefer a small accurate update over leaving stale instructions in place.

### Go Test Style

The rules below apply specifically to Go unit tests:

- prefer separate test files per service method or handler method, for example `get_test.go`, `delete_test.go`, `update_password_test.go`
- prefer table-driven tests with explicit `args`, expected result, expected error, and mock builder fields
- create a fresh `minimock.Controller` inside each `t.Run`; do not share one controller across table cases
- use repository and infrastructure mocks from `services/*/pkg/mocks`; do not replace them with ad hoc fakes unless there is a clear reason
- do not branch test setup by `tt.name`; each case should fully describe its own mock expectations
- assert behaviour, arguments, and error propagation; do not test internals of `bcrypt`, logging, tracing, or generated code
- when validation fails, explicitly verify that repository methods are not called
- keep happy-path and error-path cases separate and readable rather than collapsing everything into one oversized test
- for service-layer unit tests, avoid `t.Parallel()` by default unless mocks and shared state are clearly isolated and the test remains deterministic
- when a constructor requires unrelated dependencies, pass mocks/stubs but keep assertions focused only on the method under test

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history uses short conventional-style messages such as `feat: ...` and `fix(proto): ...`. Follow `type(scope): summary` where possible. Keep PRs focused, describe service-level impact, list any new env vars or Docker requirements, and link the issue or task. For API changes, mention regenerated protobuf outputs and affected services explicitly.
