pi-launcher: a minimal signed macOS app whose executable spawns the one bundled official Pi CLI and stays alive as its parent in the caller's existing terminal. The whole product is a security boundary plus terminal transparency; both are enforced by tests, not by convention.

## Invariants (do not weaken)

- **Fixed target**: the launcher may only exec `Contents/Resources/pi/pi` inside its own bundle. Never add a target option, PATH/env resolution, a config file, or a shell. Negative tests in `tests/functional.py` guard this.
- **Transparency**: fork+exec (never bare `exec`), same session/process group/controlling TTY, no PTY, no daemonization. Keyboard/job-control signals reach Pi via the group and are never forwarded (no duplicates); only signals directed at the launcher pid (HUP/TERM/USR1/USR2) are relayed, once. Pi exit codes pass through; Pi signal deaths are re-raised so the caller sees the identical wait status.
- **Why same-group works for Ctrl-Z**: Pi's suspend is `process.kill(0, "SIGTSTP")` (see upstream `interactive-mode.js`), a group-wide stop, and the shell's `fg` continues the group. The launcher keeps default stop dispositions and does not use `waitpid(WUNTRACED)`; adding stop-relay machinery here reintroduces a stop/continue race - don't.
- **Entitlements**: launcher has none; bundled Pi has exactly `allow-jit` (JavaScriptCore). `scripts/verify-app.sh` enforces both.
- **Provenance**: bundled Pi is pinned in `packaging/pi-release.json` (version, URLs, sha256, upstream license sha256) and cross-checked against upstream `SHA256SUMS` on every fetch. The daily updater owns routine bumps; generate a manual one with `scripts/update-pi-pin.py --write` (never hand-edit) and keep it in its own PR.
- **CI-only supply chain**: the app never self-updates. Automation may refresh the pin and release; it may not add an update path to the shipped binary.

## Layout and commands

- `src/pi-launcher.c` - the entire launcher. Header comment documents the signal contract.
- `tests/probe.c` + `tests/functional.py` + `tests/pty_tests.py` - probe-payload test double driven through real PTYs; `tests/automation_tests.py` drives the release automation scripts against a fake GitHub API (`make test-scripts`, no network). `make test` runs everything including the bundled-Pi smoke.
- `scripts/` - fetch/build/sign/verify pipeline; `check-release-contract.py` is the secret-free CI gate for workflow/packaging changes. It takes the last-released launcher version from published `vX.Y.Z` tags, never a hardcoded number (a frozen version fails the daily Pi gate after the next launcher release and quarantines the Pi tag). The autonomous-update scripts (`update-pi-pin.py`, `merge-release-pr.py`, `pi-quarantine.py`) share `gh_api.py` and keep all discovery, merge-guard, and quarantine logic out of workflow YAML.
- `packaging/icon/AppIcon.svg` - source for the original app icon; `scripts/build-icon.sh` renders the iconset and icns under ignored `build/`. Do not substitute Pi brand assets without explicit third-party app-branding permission.
- `.github/workflows/` - `ci.yml` runs PR tests without secrets; its `pull_request.paths-ignore` excludes the simple-strategy release-please outputs (`.release-please-manifest.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `version.txt`) so release PRs create zero runs, enforced by `scripts/check-release-ci-exclusions.sh`. `release-please.yml` owns versions, changelog, and tags, then calls reusable `release.yml` for the signed/notarized build; manual tag and dispatch recovery paths remain. `upstream-pi-sync.yml` is the daily stable-only Pi updater: gate first, mutate `main` second, release through the existing pipeline, quarantine a failed tag instead of retrying it. Its `auto_merge_release_pr: true` call is the only automated merge in the repo and is limited to the release-please output PR. See `RELEASE.md`.
- `homebrew/pi-launcher.rb` - cask contract for the separate tap task; never publish from this repo.
- Team ID `9T2J7MNUP9`, bundle id `com.kunchenguid.pi-launcher`, app `Pi Launcher.app`, asset `Pi-Launcher-<version>.zip`.
