# AGENTS.md

Read `CLAUDE.md` before making any changes.

Before changing files, run `tools/scripts/worktree_lineage.sh show --path .`.
If the worktree is superseded, merged, or archived, follow its recorded
successor/disposition instead of resuming it. If no status is recorded,
classify the worktree before editing.

## Decisions contract (read before touching fleet/CI config)

Settled build-system, CI, and release-automation decisions are recorded in
[`.agents/contract.toml`](.agents/contract.toml) — a schema-versioned, layered
(generic `default` layer + `pulp` overlay), agent-neutral file. Each decision
was bought with an incident; several were re-proposed by past agents and cost a
planning cycle each. Before proposing or writing a change to CI/fleet config
(the merge queue, Namespace/paid runners, auto-rebase or `--adopt-head`,
bump-at-merge, ccache depend-mode, squash auto-merge, static runner names, the
Debug macOS lane, warm build dirs), read the relevant rows:

```bash
python3 tools/scripts/decisions_contract.py --mode list                          # all rows
python3 tools/scripts/decisions_contract.py --mode surface --base origin/main    # rows your diff touches
python3 tools/scripts/decisions_contract.py --mode validate                      # schema-check the file
```

Reversing a decision requires first proving its motivating incident class can no
longer occur (Step Zero). The read surface and the SessionStart/PostToolUse
hooks (`hooks/scripts/decisions-contract-*.sh`, wired for both Codex via
`.codex/hooks.json` and Claude via the plugin) are advisory context only — the
authoritative block is this CLI's `validate` gate plus CI required checks.

## Vellum source-authority routing

`.github/vellum-ownership.json` is the authoritative source-routing projection.
For slices whose state is `framework-authoritative-transferred`, new generic
framework/rendering/UI work originates in `Generous-Corp/vellum`; Pulp changes
are limited to explicitly Pulp-owned integration, adaptation, or compatibility
work and must carry the required immutable change-event declaration.

Do not widen, narrow, or reverse an active slice in a routine Pulp change. Any
such boundary change requires the separately reviewed cross-repository
protocol and evidence plan in
[`danielraffel/pulp-planning@d7cd07b8f9a3fff0061bf3c1e84c3e9f719b3ea7`](https://github.com/danielraffel/pulp-planning/blob/d7cd07b8f9a3fff0061bf3c1e84c3e9f719b3ea7/2026-08-08-vellum-catch-up-convergence-and-adoption-plan.md).
If that artifact is unavailable, stop and request the plan rather than
inferring a boundary change.
