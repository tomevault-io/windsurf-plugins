# Repo guidelines

This repository is a monorepo containing multiple projects located primarily under `libs/`.

- Whenever you add or modify a subproject, update this file with a brief description so agents can understand its purpose.

## Projects

- **_cli** – an Aion adaptation of `langgraph-cli` for running a LangGraph production server. Out-of-date, was based on langgraph_cli and langgraph_api. We are now using our own servers.
- **_langgraph_api** – internal version of the LangGraph API server exposing HTTP routes, middleware, and async workers.
- **_langgraph_cli** – internal CLI utilities for building Docker images and launching the LangGraph API server.
- **_langgraph_storage** – in-memory storage backend and queue implementation for local LangGraph operations.
- **_a2a-template-langgraph** – example implementation of an A2A protocol serving a LangGraph agent.
- **_agent-workflow** – example implementation of a langgraph project using langgraph_api as a server
- **aion-sdk** – command line interface for the Aion Python SDK exposing the `aion` entry point. Delegates `aion chat` and headless `aion chat run` requests to the packaged standalone chat UI, sets the Python credential-helper environment for Python-launched chat auth, and leaves interactive chat commands to the npm `aio`/`aion-chat` entrypoints and composer slash commands.
- **aion-chat-ui** – standalone React/Ink terminal chat UI built with TypeScript. Packaged for `aion-sdk` as the `aion chat` experience and published to npm as `@terminal-research/aion`, which installs the `aio` executable with an `aion-chat` alias. Includes interactive chat, headless one-shot `run`, slash-command request/response mode controls, update prompts with GitHub release-note links, environment-scoped agent source discovery, local session/settings persistence, and WorkOS CLI/device login with npm keyring storage or the Python credential helper supplied by `aion-sdk`.
- **aion-server** – Google A2A server running a LangGraph agent. Provides task
  store, agent/plugin lifecycle, FastAPI application, and contract tests for
  published `aion.yaml` configuration schemas. DB management is delegated to
  `aion-db`. Graphs and HTTP apps are configured via `aion.yaml` and can be
  dynamically mounted onto the server.
- **aion-api-client** – provides a low level GraphQL client and a high level
  `ApiClient` interface for the Aion API. Also owns low-level HTTP/OpenAI-
  compatible model-service connection helpers, request-scoped model-service
  principal header injection, and typed control-plane addressing utilities
  used by framework packages.
- **aion-core** – shared A2A payloads, runtime context, invocation abstractions,
  constants, static agent configuration schema parsing/publication (including
  dedicated secret fields), and logging used across Aion SDK packages.
  Owns the
  provider-neutral Distribution/Messaging context hierarchy, reply contract,
  and representative provider payload fixtures used to verify that contract.
- **aion-adk** – Google ADK helper package for Aion-backed model
  configuration. Provides direct authoring helpers such as `aion_lite_llm`.
- **aion-authoring-adk** – Google ADK authoring toolkit for Aion MCP access.
  Provides MCP toolset bindings and request-scoped Aion model helpers without
  pulling in server plugin machinery.
- **aion-authoring-langgraph** – LangGraph authoring toolkit for Aion.
  Provides model helpers, event-routing utilities, streaming helpers, and MCP
  tool-loading bindings for runtime Aion contexts, including model clients that
  resolve principal headers at request time, plus provider-neutral immediate
  context and direct-reply routing. Includes tested Slack distribution examples
  that resolve provider tools from the incoming runtime capability.
- **aion-shared** – shared configuration, settings, logging, A2A types, file handling, and utility modules used across Aion Python SDK packages.
- **aion-mcp** – creates an ASGI proxy for an MCP server defined in
  `aion.yaml` and provides authenticated remote Aion MCP endpoint helpers for
  direct capability servers and the control-plane MCP server.
- **aion-db** – centralized DB management layer (postgres driver, migrations, repositories, models). Exposes the full `aion.db.postgres` namespace: `DbManager`, `DbFactory`, `TaskRecord`, `TaskRecordModel`, `TasksRepository`, Alembic migrations, and utilities (`convert_pg_url`, `verify_connection`, `validate_permissions`). Supports future `aion.db.redis` and similar sub-namespaces. Used by `aion-server` and plugins such as `aion-plugin-adk`.
- **aion-plugin-adk** – Google ADK control-plane plugin for Aion Server. Adapts
  inbound A2A requests into ADK execution and maps ADK events back into A2A
  responses. Model helpers belong in `aion-adk`; MCP authoring helpers belong
  in `aion-authoring-adk`.
