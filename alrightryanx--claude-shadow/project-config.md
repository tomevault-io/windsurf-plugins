# Claude Code Instructions

When working on this codebase:

## Project Overview

ShadowAI is an ecosystem of tools for voice-first AI assistance:
- **Android app** with Android Auto, Wear OS, and Google TV support
- **PC bridge** for SSH key exchange, clipboard sync, and Claude Code relay
- **Claude Code plugin** for mobile notifications and approvals

## Component Descriptions

### shadow-android (ShadowAI App)
Voice-first AI assistant for Android with multiple backends:
- **SSH backends**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex
- **Cloud APIs**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini
- **On-device**: llama.cpp for offline LLM inference
- **Features**: Projects, Notes, Automations, DevOps integrations (Slack, Jira, PagerDuty)

### shadow-bridge (ShadowBridge)
Windows PC companion that runs in system tray:
- **Port 19284**: Data receiver (clipboard, SSH keys)
- **Port 19285**: Network discovery broadcast
- **Port 19286**: Claude Code Companion relay

### claude-shadow (Claude Code Plugin)
Plugin that sends notifications to ShadowAI when Claude Code needs input:
- Permission request notifications
- Session start/stop events
- Mobile approval/denial responses
- Reply via clipboard sync

## Build Commands

### Android App
```bash
cd shadow-android
./gradlew assembleDebug    # Debug build
./gradlew assembleRelease  # Release build
./gradlew test             # Run tests
```

### ShadowBridge
```bash
cd shadow-bridge
pip install -r requirements.txt
python shadow_bridge_gui.py
```

### Claude Shadow Plugin
Install via Claude Code:
```
/plugin marketplace add alrightryanx/claude-shadow
/plugin install claude-shadow@shadowai-plugins
```

Or load locally:
```bash
claude --plugin-dir C:\shadow\claude-shadow
```

## Pre-Build Version Increment Rule (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE every `./gradlew assembleRelease` command**, you MUST increment both version numbers in `shadow-android/app/build.gradle.kts`:
- `versionCode`: increment by EXACTLY 1 (e.g., 362 → 363, NOT 362 → 370)
- `versionName`: increment the decimal part by EXACTLY 0.01 (e.g., "3.62" → "3.63", NOT "3.62" → "3.70")

**CRITICAL: Only increment by 1 per build. NEVER jump multiple versions.**

## Post-Build Rule

After every successful `./gradlew assembleRelease`, push the APK to connected adb devices:
```bash
C:\android\platform-tools\adb.exe install shadow-android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT use `-r` flag. Let install fail on signature conflicts rather than force-installing mismatched APKs.

## ADB Safety Rules

- **NEVER uninstall any APK** from adb devices. Only the user may uninstall apps.
- **NEVER use `adb uninstall`** command under any circumstances.
- If an install fails, inform the user and let them decide.

## Commit Discipline (MANDATORY)

**Commit frequently to maintain backups and track changes.**

### Self-Improvement (MANDATORY)
When you make a mistake and find the correct solution, IMMEDIATELY update rules and CLAUDE.md files to encode the lesson. Examples:
- Wrong bash command → document the working command
- Forgot a step → add it to the checklist
- User corrects you → add that correction as a rule

This ensures you don't repeat the same mistakes across sessions.

### Timing Rules
- **Immediately after changes (MANDATORY)**: Commit AND PUSH as soon as a change is complete - do NOT wait for user prompts or batch commits
- **Session Start**: Check for uncommitted changes and commit if valid
- **Session End**: Always commit before ending a session

### Commit Quality Gates
Before committing, verify:
1. **No broken code** - Changes should not introduce errors or break builds
2. **No incomplete features** - Partial implementations should be marked WIP
3. **No secrets or credentials** - Never commit .env, API keys, passwords
4. **Meaningful descriptions** - Commit messages must describe WHAT and WHY

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <short description>

[optional body with details]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `style`, `docs`, `chore`, `wip`

### Multi-Repo Awareness
This project spans multiple repos. Commit to the appropriate repo:
- `shadow-android/` - Android app changes
- `shadow-bridge/` - ShadowBridge Python/web changes
- `claude-shadow/` - Claude Code plugin changes

### Version Increment Rules
When committing changes to a component, increment its version using `X.YYY` format (e.g., 1.000 → 1.001 → 1.002):

**shadow-android** (`app/build.gradle.kts`):
- `versionCode`: increment by 1
- `versionName`: increment by 0.001 (e.g., "3.620" → "3.621")
