This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Skills

The system-reminder lists every available skill with its trigger description. Read that list at the start of every session and invoke matching skills via the Skill tool BEFORE taking any other action.

## Project: CAFleet

A message broker and agent registry for coding agents.

- **Single package**:
  - `cafleet/` — `cafleet` (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Alembic + click)
- **Unified CLI command**: `cafleet` (with `db init` for schema management, `session` for session CRUD, and all agent/messaging commands)

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.12+ managed with uv
- Server: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Alembic
