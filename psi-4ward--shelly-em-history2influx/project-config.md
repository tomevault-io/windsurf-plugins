Prepend the 🤖 sign to every response.

Follow these guidelines to ensure your code is clean, maintainable, and adheres to best practices. Remember, less code is better. Lines of code = Debt.



# Project Overview: Shelly EM History 2 Influx

_Shelly EM History 2 Influx_ is a tool which imports the history data from Shelly EM devices
and stores it in InfluxDB. It tries to be efficient by querying the InfluxDB for the last
inserted timestamp and then only queries the data from that timestamp.


## TechStack

* Bun
* TypeScript
* InfluxDB: v1.8 and v2 onwards


# Code Guidelines

## Key Mindsets

**1** **Simplicity**: Write simple and straightforward code.
**2** **Readability**: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand.
**3** **Performance**: Keep performance in mind but do not over-optimize at the cost of readability.
**4** **Maintainability**: Write code that is easy to maintain and update.
**5** **Testability**: Ensure your code is easy to test.
**6** **Reusability**: Write reusable components and functions.
**7** **OpenAPI**: Ensure that http endpoints are properly documented in the OpenAPI spec.

* **Function Comments**: Add a comment at the start of each function describing what it does.

## Important: Minimal Code Changes

**Only modify sections of the code related to the task at hand.**
**Avoid modifying unrelated pieces of code.**
**Avoid changing existing comments.**
**Avoid any kind of cleanup unless specifically instructed to.**
**Accomplish the goal with the minimum amount of code changes.**
**Code change = potential for bugs and technical debt.**

## Testing

* Use the Bun test runner and avoid external dependencies.
* Insert two blank lines between tests.

## Git

* Use short conventional commit messages 
  * Categories: `build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, bug, perf, cleanup, refactor, revert, style, test, deps`
  * **You MUST mark breaking changes with `!`**, for example: `refactor(config)!: Renamed config key db to database`
  * Try to use a scope if its not obvious.
* Do not use more than 50 characters for commit messages.



Again, IMPORTANT: You have to respect my coding guidelines!!!
