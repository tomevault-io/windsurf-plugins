# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents (e.g. OpenAI Codex) working in this
repository.

This repository packages its capabilities as portable "skills" - read the
relevant skill's `SKILL.md` in full and follow it before acting in the
corresponding area. Do not guess at a skill's behavior from this table alone.

| Skill | Description | Path |
|---|---|---|
| compiling-project-guidelines | Compile scattered guideline sources into one scope-aware COMPILED-GUIDELINES.md for other skills and ult-context-generate's Constraints layer. Do NOT use to enforce rules at runtime. | `.github/skills/compiling-project-guidelines/SKILL.md` |
| demo-consume-context | Worked example that discovers, loads, and tags a context package per CONSUMING-CONTEXT-PACKAGE.md, then writes a reverse-index addendum — proves the produce/consume/tag loop end-to-end. Do NOT use for real feature work. | `.github/skills/demo-consume-context/SKILL.md` |
| demo-write-user-stories | Reference implementation that writes functional user stories from a feature description, optionally grounded in an approved CEP context package per CONSUMING-CONTEXT-PACKAGE.md, with per-story citations and the standard tag/reverse-index loop. A worked example for downstream teams building their own context-consuming skills. | `.github/skills/demo-write-user-stories/SKILL.md` |
| ult-autoscaffold-content | Generate real starter content for a project's What-L2 (requirements) and How-L2 (architecture/conventions) CEP layers once ult-repo-layout has resolved their paths but found them empty — an honest, minimal, YAML-frontmatter-first overview document per layer for small/single targets, or graphify-informed per-module tiering with resumable per-module CONTEXT.md generation, existence-gated CODING-STANDARDS.md/TESTING-GUIDELINES.md, interface-boundary docs for graph-crossing module pairs, and a rendered CEP-INDEX.md router for large repos, optionally informed by a user-supplied domain-pack of terminology/references if one is configured. This skill generates a NEW starter doc only when none exists — it never compiles or reconciles EXISTING scattered guideline sources (that's compiling-project-guidelines' job). Do NOT use to enforce layout paths or run layer discovery — that's ult-repo-layout. Do NOT use to author or generate a domain pack — this skill only ever consumes one you already wrote. | `.github/skills/ult-autoscaffold-content/SKILL.md` |
| ult-cep-retrofit | Point at an existing skill library, inventory it format-agnostically, and (with human confirmation at every step) insert pointers to CEP's existing CONSUMING-*.md contracts into the skills that should consume them. Do NOT use to write new CONSUMING-*.md contracts, validate that a retrofit works at runtime, or edit a library's own logic beyond the inserted pointer. | `.github/skills/ult-cep-retrofit/SKILL.md` |
| ult-cep-wizard | Launch a local, localhost-only browser wizard with two journeys — layout onboarding for a project with ult-repo-layout installed, initialized or not — guides an uninitialized or not-yet-discovered repo through Run Discover, then shows resolved layer/slot state through four labeled boxes and a directory picker, and lets you resolve pending layout decisions (confirm/skip/disable/pick-a-directory) and Apply them into context-config.yaml via ult-repo-layout's own confirm step; and retrofit — walks an existing skill library through ult-cep-retrofit's inventory/classify/draft/apply flow, with an editable per-file diff preview and batch Apply, never writing without that preview. Do NOT use for headless/CI-only layout validation — use ult-repo-layout's discover/confirm-layers/--validate directly. | `.github/skills/ult-cep-wizard/SKILL.md` |
| ult-codegraph | Generate a codebase knowledge graph with `graphify` at `graphify-out/` so other skills can query cross-file relationships before touching code. Do NOT use for runtime profiling. | `.github/skills/ult-codegraph/SKILL.md` |
| ult-context-generate | Assemble a context package (code graph, requirements, constraints, blast radius) before a downstream generation task runs - human-approved, source-attributed. Do NOT use for simple lookups. | `.github/skills/ult-context-generate/SKILL.md` |
| ult-institutional-memory-distill | Distill decisions, reasoning, and rejected alternatives from PRs, design docs, and postmortems into the project's decision_ledger, so ult-context-generate's trip-wire can surface institutional memory before new work quietly repeats settled ground. Do NOT use to query the ledger against new work or decide revise/proceed/escalate -- that's ult-context-generate/SKILL.md Step 7.7's job. | `.github/skills/ult-institutional-memory-distill/SKILL.md` |
