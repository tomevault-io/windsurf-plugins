# FHE Document Comparison - Next Steps

Claude, I've placed two important documents in the repository for your review:

## 1. CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md
This document contains step-by-step instructions for organizing the repository before implementing the CLI. Key points:
- Preserves all validation tests in an organized structure
- Creates clean directories for the CLI implementation
- Maintains failed tests for reference
- Sets up proper documentation and .gitignore

## 2. CLI_IMPLEMENTATION.md
This document contains the complete CLI implementation that:
- Fixes the type consistency issues you found
- Implements the exact use case (inventor encrypts, system compares, inventor decrypts)
- Uses validated parameters (dimension=16, scale=1000)
- Provides clear separation between inventor and system operations

## Recommended Workflow

1. **First**: Run the cleanup instructions to organize the repository
2. **Then**: Implement the CLI in the cleaned structure
3. **Finally**: Test the complete workflow

The CLI implementation addresses all the issues discovered during validation and provides a simple but complete demonstration of privacy-preserving document comparison using FHE.
