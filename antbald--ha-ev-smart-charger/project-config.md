## Default Skill Policy For This Repo

- Also use `home-assistant-best-practices` by default for any change that touches Home Assistant entities, helpers, services, templates, triggers, or configuration semantics.
- Additionally use `home-assistant-automation-scripts` when the task involves automations, scripts, blueprints, YAML examples, or automation logic.
- Use the minimal set of these skills that covers the task, but do not skip them for Home Assistant-related work in this repo.
