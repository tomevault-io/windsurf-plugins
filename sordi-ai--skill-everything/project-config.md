# Sub-Skill: Error Log
<!-- target: ~1500 tokens (grows with entries) -->

**Purpose:** Central memory for all mistakes the agent has made or observed. Each entry prevents the same mistake from happening twice. Validated by [`tools/validate_rules.py`](../../tools/validate_rules.py) against [`schemas/error-entry.json`](../../schemas/error-entry.json) on every PR.

## Format specification

Every error entry follows this YAML format. The schema is enforced — see [`schemas/error-entry.json`](../../schemas/error-entry.json) for the canonical definition.

```yaml
- id: ERR-YYYY-NNN          # Year + sequential number, e.g. ERR-2026-001
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  last_seen: YYYY-MM-DD     # Last occurrence (update on repeat)
  count: 1                   # How many times this error has occurred
  category: development|git|deployment|security|performance|domain
  severity: critical|high|medium|low
  context: |
    [1-3 sentences: in what situation did the error occur?
    What task was being worked on? Which project/module?]
  what_happened: |
    [Concrete description of what the agent did.
    Code snippet if relevant.]
  root_cause: |
    [Why did it happen? What false assumption was the cause?]
  impact: |
    [What was the consequence? Data loss? Security breach? Time wasted?]
  resolution: |
    [What was done to fix the error?]
  new_rule: |
    [The concrete rule derived from this error.
    Phrased as action directive: "Always X before Y" or "Never Z without W".
    Must start with: Always, Never, Before, After, Prefer, Avoid, Use, Do, or Ensure.]
  target_file: skills/[name]/SKILL.md
  # Optional: evidence linking this entry to real commits / PRs / CI runs.
  # Include whatever is verifiable; all sub-fields are optional.
  evidence:
    commit_sha: <full or short hex SHA>
    pr_number: <integer>
    failing_run_url: <CI URL that reproduces the failure>
    fixed_run_url: <CI URL that shows the fix in effect>
    reproduced_by_test: <true|false>

## Entries

```yaml
errors:

  - id: ERR-2026-001
    date: 2026-04-12
    last_seen: 2026-04-12
    count: 1
    category: development
    severity: high
    context: |
      Adding type-safe API call wrappers to a TypeScript project. tsconfig
      has strictNullChecks enabled. The agent was generating a quick demo
      function, saw a tsc error about possibly-undefined returns, and
      flipped strictNullChecks off in the local file via a triple-slash
      directive to make the demo green.
    what_happened: |
      Agent added a per-file directive disabling strictNullChecks because
      the demo function "didn't need to handle the null path". Locally tsc
      was clean. CI runs the project tsc against the whole tree and the
      directive bled into a downstream import path that did rely on
      strictness. CI failed on a file the agent never touched.
    root_cause: |
      False assumption that "disable a strict check just for this demo"
      is local. In TypeScript, lib-mode and per-file directives interact
      with project graph in non-obvious ways.
    impact: |
      Two CI runs lost. Reviewer reverted the directive. ~25 minutes wasted.
    resolution: |
      Removed the directive, added a real null-check, demo now handles
      both paths.
    new_rule: |
      Never disable strict type-checks "just for this file" to make a demo
      green. Either handle the null path or document why the value is
      provably non-null with a comment.

  - id: ERR-2026-007
    date: 2026-04-21
    last_seen: 2026-04-29
    count: 2
    category: development
    severity: medium
    context: |
      Renaming a public utility function inside a TypeScript monorepo. The
      function was used in 17 places across 5 packages.
    what_happened: |
      Agent renamed the function in the source file and the directly
      adjacent test file, ran the local tests, saw green, and reported the
      rename complete. Four imports in two other packages still referenced
      the old name; tsc passed locally because the agent only watched the
      source package. CI caught the drift.
      The same mistake repeated 8 days later on a different rename in a
      different package — increment of count rather than a new entry.
    root_cause: |
      Treating "tests green here" as proof of "rename complete everywhere".
      In a monorepo, local tsc/test scope hides cross-package refs.
    impact: |
      First occurrence: 35 minutes lost. Second occurrence: caught in
      pre-merge CI before review, ~10 minutes lost.
    resolution: |
      Added a project-wide ripgrep step to the rename checklist:
      `rg -F '<old name>' --type ts` before claiming done.
    new_rule: |
      After any rename, run a project-wide grep for the old name before
      claiming the rename is complete. In monorepos, local tsc scope is
      not enough.
