# pi-setup

Global Pi configuration: system prompt, vendored TypeScript extensions, skills, themes, and prompts. The agent's engineering standards live in [`agent/SYSTEM.md`](agent/SYSTEM.md).

Run `bun run verify` before reporting a change to `agent/extensions`, `agent/lib`, or `agent/scripts`.

Every decision made in the code/output of this repository should increase the AX (Agent Experience) of the harness.

Before writing Effect code, read `.repos/effect/LLMS.md` and inspect its source and tests for idiomatic usage, module structure, and API design. Use the submodule as read-only reference and keep application imports on the installed `effect` and `@effect/*` packages. If it is absent, initialize it with `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

## Agent skills
