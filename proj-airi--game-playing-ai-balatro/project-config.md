# Balatro Game Playing AI - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
You are working on a Balatro game playing AI that uses computer vision (YOLO object detection) to understand game state and implements AI decision-making for optimal gameplay.

## Package Management (Pixi)
- Use `pixi run python <script>` for executing Python scripts
- Use `pixi add --pypi <package>` for pip packages
- Use `pixi add <package>` for system-level dependencies
- Use `pixi shell` when needing interactive shell or CLI tools (huggingface-cli, yolo)
- For CUDA: `pixi add cuda --platform win-64 --platform linux-64` (exclude macOS)

## Development Standards

### Model Implementation
- PyTorch models: Best for CUDA/MPS workflows (high-performance GPU inference)
- ONNX models: Best for WebGPU, AMD GPU, Intel GPU, Intel CPU, broad compatibility
- Focus on CUDA/MPS workflow for optimal performance
- Always implement proper device detection and setup
- Create universal device utility function with assertions
- Support CUDA → MPS → CPU detection hierarchy
- Use CoreML libraries for FastVLM models on Apple platforms

### Code Structure
- Use abstract base classes for interface definitions
- Create modular, testable components
- Implement minimal approaches first, then expand
- Always include pytest-capable test scripts
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns

### Computer Vision & Debugging
- Always save/record intermediate images for debugging
- Preserve bounding boxes and processing steps with confidence scores
- Use Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) for CV development and prototyping
- Save original images, preprocessed images, detection overlays, cropped regions
- Workflow: Develop in notebooks → Extract to modules → Add tests → Integrate

### Testing
- Structure tests: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/visual/`
- Include visual tests that compare detection outputs against ground truth
- Test minimal approaches before expanding functionality
- Ensure reproducible testing environments

## Available Resources

### Models
- PyTorch: `models/games-balatro-2024-yolo-entities-detection/model.pt`
- ONNX: `models/games-balatro-2024-yolo-entities-detection/onnx/model.onnx`

### Test Data
- Training images: `data/datasets/games-balatro-2024-entities-detection/data/train/yolo/images/`
- Example: `out_00001.jpg` (many available)

### Platform Considerations
- macOS: Use MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) for PyTorch, CoreML for FastVLM
- Linux/Windows: CUDA support for high-performance GPU inference
- Always implement device detection with proper fallbacks

## Documentation Standards

### Design Documents & Plans
- **Location**: `docs/ai/designs/`
- **Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-case-description.md`
- **Frontmatter Required**: All design docs must include YAML frontmatter
- **Metadata Template**:
```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
version: "X.Y"
status: "draft|active|completed|deprecated"
coding_agents:
  authors: ["Human Name", "Claude Code"]
  project: "proj-airi/game-playing-ai-balatro"
  context: "Brief description"
  technologies: ["tech1", "tech2"]
  phase: "foundation|implementation|optimization"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```
- **EDIT history**: Maintain a changelog at the bottom of each doc for updates when huge changes occur

### Documentation Rules
- Include essential context and decision rationale
- Update documents as implementation progresses
- Always attribute human collaborators and Claude Code
- List relevant technologies for searchability
- Create comprehensive design docs before coding

## Engineering Principles
1. Quality over speed - No rushing, focus on solid engineering
2. Modular design - Well-defined interfaces and abstractions
3. Test-driven - Every component should be testable
4. Cross-platform - Consider different inference backends
5. Maintainable - Clean code structure and documentation
6. Visual debugging - Preserve intermediate images for CV tasks
7. Progressive development - Use notebooks for exploratory CV work
8. Documentation-driven - Design before implementation

## Code Style
- DO NOT ADD COMMENTS unless explicitly requested
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Use transformers and onnxruntime for inference
- Always validate device availability before model loading
- Implement proper error handling for device fallbacks

## Commands to Remember
- Execute scripts: `pixi run python <script>`
- Add dependencies: `pixi add --pypi <package>`
- Enter shell: `pixi shell`
- Run tests: `pixi run pytest <test_file>`

## Security
- Never expose or log secrets/keys
- Never commit secrets to repository
- Follow security best practices for AI model deployment
