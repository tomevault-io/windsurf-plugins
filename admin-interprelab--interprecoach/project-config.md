### **InterpreCoach Microservices Architecture**

Here are the six distinct microservices that would form the core of your backend, designed for independent development, scaling, and maintenance.

***

#### 1. Transcription Service 🎙️
* **Primary Responsibility:** To ingest the real-time audio stream from the client and convert it into a text transcript. This service is a dedicated gateway to Google's speech recognition engine.
* **Key Technologies:** It would primarily interact with the **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API**, configured with the specialized medical model for high accuracy.

***

#### 2. Language Analysis Service (NLP) 🧠
* **Primary Responsibility:** To perform all Natural Language Processing tasks on the transcribed text. It acts as the "comprehension" engine of the system.
* **Key Functions:**
    * **Entity Recognition:** Identifies medical terms, medications, symptoms, and measurements.
    * **Insight Generation:** Creates the real-time "Key Insights" summaries.
    * **Grammar & Tense Analysis:** Runs custom logic to check for grammatical consistency.
* **Key Technologies:** It would heavily use the **Google Cloud Natural Language API** and custom-trained models.

***

#### 3. Terminology & Data Service 📚
* **Primary Responsibility:** To act as a fast, queryable database for all structured information like medication names and medical term definitions.
* **Key Functions:**
    * Provides multi-faceted medication data (brand, generic, aliases).
    * Serves definitions, translations, and image URLs for medical terms.
    * Handles measurement conversions (kg to lbs, cm to ft/in).
* **Key Technologies:** A high-performance database like **Firestore** or a managed SQL/NoSQL database with a simple API in front of it.

***

#### 4. Acoustic Analysis Service 🔊
* **Primary Responsibility:** To process the raw audio stream to extract vocal metrics, focusing on *how* things are said, not *what* is said.
* **Key Functions:** Analyzes the audio for pace (words per minute), pitch, tonal variations, and clarity.
* **Key Technologies:** Custom audio processing libraries (e.g., Librosa in Python) running in a containerized environment like **Cloud Run**.

***

#### 5. QA Feedback Service 📝
* **Primary Responsibility:** To generate the final, post-session Quality Assurance report by orchestrating data and calling the specialized LLM.
* **Key Functions:**
    * Gathers relevant data (transcript snippets, grammar analysis, acoustic metrics).
    * Sends the data to the specialized, ethics-trained LLM using the "interprecoach-QA feedback" prompt.
    * Formats the LLM's response into the final user-facing report.
* **Key Technologies:** Interacts directly with your **custom-trained LLM on Vertex AI**.

***

#### 6. Session & Data Management Service 🔐
* **Primary Responsibility:** To manage the lifecycle of an interpreting session and enforce all data privacy and security rules.
* **Key Functions:**
    * Handles session initiation and authentication.
    * Orchestrates calls to the other microservices.
    * Enforces the ephemeral storage and **auto-deletion** policies for all sensitive data.
* **Key Technologies:** A lightweight web framework running in **Cloud Functions** or **Cloud Run**, interacting with a cache like **Memorystore (Redis)** for managing session state.
