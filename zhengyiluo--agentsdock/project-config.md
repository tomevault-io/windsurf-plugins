# Development rules

- Preserve user work and keep changes scoped to the requested task.
- Read the relevant package documentation before changing its code. Use the
  package's type checks and targeted tests, then validate the affected build.
- A request to change, build, test, or install does not authorize publishing a
  release, uploading artifacts, deploying a server, or submitting to an app
  store. Those external actions require an explicit user request.
- Commit completed changes before an explicitly authorized release build.
- Electron releases use the direct desktop channel unless the user explicitly
  requests a Mac App Store or TestFlight build.
- Within one beta release line, keep the base version fixed and increment only
  the prerelease number. Promote to stable only after validation.
- Mobile changes require a separately scoped mobile task. Do not perform mobile
  builds or uploads as an incidental part of desktop or server work.
- The embedded `server/` directory is a frozen compatibility fixture, not the
  deployable AgentsServer source. Server deployment is a separate action in the
  standalone repository and requires explicit authorization.
- Record public-facing changes and accepted releases in `docs/DEV_LOG.md`.
  Never add private transcripts, credentials, host inventories, local paths,
  or internal incident reports. Review screenshots and recordings before inclusion.
- Preserve third-party license and attribution notices.
