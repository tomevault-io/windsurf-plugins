## Context for Codex & Agents

This project is a **local-first LeetCode tracker** written in TypeScript + React + Vite, with heavy use of IndexedDB (via `idb`), Vitest for tests, and a domain logic structure under `src/domain/`.

---

## Project Structure Overview

- `src/domain/`: Core recommendation and progress-tracking logic
- `src/components/`: UI components (e.g. `Dashboard.tsx`)
- `src/types/`: Shared types for problems, categories, recommendations
- `src/storage/`: Local DB abstraction using IndexedDB
- `public/`: Sample JSON files for testing/demo purposes
- `docs/` and `README.md`: Human-readable documentation and scoring design

---

## Commenting Guidelines

- **Preserve existing comments:** Do not remove comments unless they are outdated or no longer relevant.
- Comments provide important context, rationale, or usage notes—keep them intact to help future contributors.
- When updating code, review nearby comments and update them if the logic changes.
- DO NOT add useless comments to the codebase. Temporary comments are ok,
  but you must remove them before finishing your work. Only leave comments
  that will meaningfully help maintainers understand intent, rationale, or
  something non-obvious about the code.

## Testing/linting Tips

### Run full suite (CI-style)

```bash
npm run test
```

### Lint and auto-fix

```bash
npm run lint       # Lint only
npm run lint:fix   # Lint and auto-fix
```

### Format with Prettier

```bash
npm run format
```

### Single test targeting

```bash
npx vitest run -t "<test name>"
```

### After moving files or editing imports

Run this to make sure nothing breaks:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run test
```

### Testing Conventions

- Unit test most functions
- For React components, test **functional behavior** (e.g. user interaction, prop changes, conditional rendering)
- Tests should run cleanly without manual setup or file system writes
