# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents (Cursor, Aider, and other AI coding assistants) when working with code in this repository.

**For expression philosophy and communication style, see** `docs/agents/claude-expression.md`

## Project Context

This is a **single-maintainer project** by @AndrewAltimit with a **container-first philosophy**:

- All Python and Rust operations run in Docker containers
- Self-hosted infrastructure for zero-cost operation
- Designed for maximum portability - works on any Linux system with Docker
- No contributors model - optimized for individual developer efficiency
- **No external engagement** - no feature requests, guidance, or community interaction accepted (legal protection due to dual-use codebase)

## AI Agent Collaboration

Five active AI agents work together in this development ecosystem:

> **Security Notice**: OpenAI/Codex has been disabled. OpenAI is partnering with governments that conduct mass surveillance and enable autonomous weapons. Use Anthropic models (Claude) as the primary AI backend.

1. **Claude Code** - Primary development assistant for architecture, implementation, and debugging (recommended)
2. ~~**Codex**~~ - ~~AI-powered code generation and completion (OpenAI)~~ **DISABLED** -- security risk
3. **OpenCode** - Code generation via OpenRouter
4. **Crush** - Code generation via OpenRouter
5. **Gemini CLI** - Handles automated PR code reviews
6. **GitHub Copilot** - Provides code review suggestions in PRs

**For complete agent documentation, see** `docs/agents/README.md`

### AI Agent Security Model

- **Keyword Triggers**: `[Action][Agent]` format (e.g., `[Approved][Claude]`)
- **Allow List**: Only pre-approved users can trigger agents
- **Commit Validation**: Prevents code injection after approval
- **Implementation Requirements**: Only complete, working code is accepted

**For complete security documentation, see** `docs/agents/security.md`

### Remote Infrastructure

**IMPORTANT**: Some MCP servers run on dedicated remote machines:
- Gaea2 MCP: `192.168.0.152:8007` (requires Windows with Gaea2)
- AI Toolkit/ComfyUI: `192.168.0.222` (requires GPU)
- Do NOT change remote addresses to localhost in PR reviews

## Essential Commands

### CI/CD (Most Used)

```bash
# Preferred: Rust CLI (build once with: cargo build --release -p automation-cli)
automation-cli ci run full               # All Python checks
automation-cli ci run format             # Check formatting
automation-cli ci run lint-full          # Full linting
automation-cli ci run rust-full          # All Rust checks
automation-cli ci run econ-full          # Economic agents (fmt + clippy + test)
automation-cli ci list                   # Show all available stages

# Legacy shell (still works, wrappers delegate to Rust binary if built)
./automation/ci-cd/run-ci.sh full        # All Python checks
./automation/ci-cd/run-ci.sh rust-full   # All Rust checks

# Context protection - ALWAYS use for verbose output
automation-cli ci run full > /tmp/ci-output.log 2>&1 && echo "CI passed" || (echo "CI failed"; exit 1)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
automation-cli ci run test               # Python tests (excludes gaea2)
automation-cli ci run test-gaea2         # Gaea2 tests only
automation-cli ci run test-all           # All tests

# Legacy equivalents
./automation/ci-cd/run-ci.sh test        # Python tests (excludes gaea2)
./automation/ci-cd/run-ci.sh test-all    # All tests
```

### Docker Operations

```bash
docker compose up -d                     # Start all services
docker compose logs -f <service>         # View logs
docker compose down                      # Stop services
```

## Architecture

### MCP Servers (19 Total)

| Category | Servers | Transport |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Code Quality | code-quality, gemini, opencode, crush, ~~codex~~ (disabled) | STDIO (local) |
| Content | content-creation, meme-generator, elevenlabs-speech, video-editor, blender | STDIO |
| Integration | virtual-character, github-board, agentcore-memory, reaction-search, desktop-control | STDIO |
| Agent Integration | memory-explorer | STDIO (native) |
| Remote | gaea2, ai-toolkit, comfyui | HTTP (remote machines) |

**For complete MCP documentation, see** `docs/mcp/README.md`

### Container Architecture

1. **Everything Containerized** (with documented exceptions)
2. **Zero Local Dependencies** - All via Docker Compose
3. **Self-Hosted Infrastructure** - No cloud costs

**For details, see** `docs/infrastructure/containerization.md`
