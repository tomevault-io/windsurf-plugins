# Confetti Agent Guide

## Project goal

Confetti is a small, local-first VS Code extension for detecting, highlighting, and formatting common configuration files.

Keep the product focused on:

1. Configuration type detection
2. TextMate syntax highlighting
3. Format Document support

Do not add AI features, accounts, cloud services, telemetry, Webviews, validation, completion, or diagnostics unless the user explicitly expands the product scope.

## Design principles

- Keep the implementation simple, fast, reliable, and easy to extend.
- Keep core logic independent from the VS Code API so it can later be reused by a CLI or other editors.
- Prefer format-specific detectors, grammars, and formatters over a generic rule that changes semantics.
- Never hard-code syntax colors. Use standard TextMate scopes and let the active theme choose colors.
- Do not add runtime npm dependencies unless there is a strong, documented reason.
- Do not scan the full document on every edit. Detection belongs on open, active-editor change, save, or explicit command execution.
- Preserve compatibility with canonical VS Code language IDs for YAML, INI, and Java Properties.

## Supported formats

- Nginx
- SSH config
- Environment variables / dotenv
- INI / EditorConfig
- Java Properties
- TOML
- YAML
- Git Config
- npm config / npmrc
- Ignore files (`.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, `.npmignore`, and related files)
- Git Attributes
- Browserslist
- Tool version files (`.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `.python-version`, `.ruby-version`, `.tool-versions`)
- Hosts
- Filesystem table / fstab
- Crontab

Redis is intentionally not supported.

YAML, Ignore files, and tool version files are detection and highlighting only. Confetti intentionally does not register formatters where a dedicated formatter is preferable or formatting could change semantics.

## Repository layout

- `src/core/`: editor-independent registry, detection, formatting, and shared types
- `src/configs/`: one `ConfigDefinition` per supported format
- `src/formatters/`: one formatter per format with formatting support, plus carefully scoped shared helpers
- `src/tokenizers/`: editor-independent token types and safe lexical scanning primitives
- `src/extension.ts`: thin VS Code adapter, commands, providers, events, logging, and cache lifecycle
- `syntaxes/`: self-contained TextMate grammar JSON files
- `language-configurations/`: format-specific VS Code editor behavior
- `examples/`: realistic files for manual Extension Development Host testing
- `test/`: unit, integration, grammar-tokenization, manifest, example, performance-baseline, and VS Code adapter tests
- `scripts/benchmark.mjs`: reproducible detection, formatting, package-size, and heap benchmark

## Required behavior

Detection:

- Use filename, normalized path, extension, and content signals.
- Support POSIX and Windows paths.
- Return the highest-confidence definition only when confidence is at least the fixed `MIN_CONFIDENCE` value.
- Do not force a language mode for an unreliable result.
- Keep detection within the documented performance targets.

Formatting:

- Preserve comments and quoted content.
- Preserve escaped characters, continuation lines, and TOML multiline strings.
- Do not modify configuration semantics.
- Preserve whether the input has a final newline.
- Normalize CRLF safely.
- Be idempotent: `format(format(input)) === format(input)`.
- Prefer a small state machine or tokenizer over broad regular-expression replacement when syntax state matters.

Extension behavior:

- Keep `confetti.autoDetect` and `confetti.format.enable` available in the VS Code Settings UI.
- Keep the confidence threshold internal rather than user-configurable.
- Release cached detection results when documents close.
- Log formatter invocation, selected format, result, elapsed time, and path to the Confetti output channel.
- Keep the explicit **Confetti: Format Config** command so users can distinguish Confetti from other formatters.

## Adding or changing a format

When adding a format:

1. Add a `ConfigDefinition` in `src/configs/`.
2. Register it in `src/configs/index.ts`.
3. Add a dedicated formatter in `src/formatters/` when formatting is supported.
4. Add a TextMate grammar in `syntaxes/` using standard scopes.
5. Add a format-specific language configuration when editor behavior differs.
6. Update `package.json` language and grammar contributions.
7. Add realistic examples.
8. Add detector, formatter, idempotency, malformed-input, real TextMate tokenization, manifest, and example tests.
9. Update both `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md`.

Do not claim support until detection, highlighting, formatting, examples, and tests are all present where applicable.

## Development commands

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run check
npm run benchmark
npm run package
```

Use `npm run check` as the normal quality gate. Use `npm run package` before release-related changes.

## Test requirements

- All tests must pass.
- Statements, branches, functions, and lines must remain at 100% for the configured source set.
- Every formatter needs semantic-preservation and idempotency coverage.
