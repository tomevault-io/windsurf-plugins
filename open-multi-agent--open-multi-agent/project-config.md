`template/` (shared base) and `templates/{demo,pr-review,security}` (overlays) are not repository code: `src/scaffold.ts` copies the base and then the chosen overlay verbatim into the user's new project, so every file added there ships to end users. Never place repo-internal files (AGENTS.md, notes, fixtures) inside them; that is why this file sits at the package root. The validation matrix is in the root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md); the rules below are the template-specific traps.

- **npm publishes an enumerated subset of `template/`.** `package.json#files` includes `templates` wholesale but only specific `template/` paths (plus `README.md`, which npm force-includes). Every overlay ships its own `package.json`, `README.md`, `tsconfig.json`, and `src/index.ts` and overwrites the base copy at scaffold time, so editing those four base files changes nothing user-facing. Any other new base file must also be added to `files`, or published scaffolds silently omit it. Verify with `npm pack --dry-run -w create-oma-app`.
- **The `@open-multi-agent/core` pin is exact and must equal the core release tag.** It lives in `template/package.json` and every `templates/*/package.json`; keep them all in sync. `.github/workflows/release-smoke.yml` fails after publish if a scaffold pins anything else. During a release window the pin may reference a not-yet-published core version: that is expected, do not "fix" it. Local checks never install the pin (`typecheck:template` resolves core from the workspace; `test:scaffold` installs core from a freshly packed tarball), so a green run does not validate the pinned version.
- **Dotfiles ship renamed.** npm strips real dotfiles on publish, so the base carries `_gitignore` / `_env.example` / `_env.ollama` and `scaffold()` renames them at scaffold time. A new dotfile must follow the same `_name` + `restoreDotfile` pattern in `src/scaffold.ts`.
- **`__PROJECT_NAME__` is a placeholder** stamped into the generated `package.json` by `scaffold()` (which also replaces `__OMA_RUNTIME__`). Leave placeholder tokens intact in template sources.
- **Template membership is hard-coded in three places.** Adding or renaming a template means updating `TEMPLATE_IDS` in `src/args.ts`, the template list in `scripts/typecheck-templates.mjs`, and the loops plus file assertions in `scripts/test-scaffold.mjs`.
