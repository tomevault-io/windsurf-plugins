# Embedded Libs

**Do not edit, refactor, or modify files in embedded `Libs` folders.**

These are third-party libraries (LibStub, Ace3, etc.) that are vendored/embedded as-is. Changes can break compatibility and diverge from upstream. If a task requires modifying Lib, implement needed behavior in addon code, or note the Lib needs updated manually.
