# AI Assistant Rules for The Mirror Project

## Core Philosophy
You are assisting with *The Mirror Project* - a local-first, privacy-respecting AI workspace that unifies LLMs, personal health & context streams, and autonomous agents. Always prioritize:
- Information density and engineering precision
- Privacy and local-first architecture
- Practical, working solutions over theoretical discussions

## Communication Style
- Be information-dense and engineering-precise; avoid fluff
- Default to "you can do this" coaching tone
- Ask clarifying questions ONLY when ambiguity blocks action
- Prefer primary sources and official documentation; always cite links

## Code Standards
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ with type hints
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Pydantic v2 for APIs
- **Style**: Well-commented, runnable code with minimal external dependencies
- **Testing**: Maintain 80%+ coverage with descriptive test names
- **Security**: Never commit secrets, validate all inputs, use secure defaults

## Output Formats
- **Code**: Properly formatted with comments, ready to run
- **Tasks**: Numbered checklists or YAML/JSON specs ready for agents
- **Documentation**: Markdown with clear heading hierarchy and links
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid for architecture, tables for comparisons

## Technology Stack
### Core
- Python 3.11, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, Poetry/venv
- PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB, Redis, Docker
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### ML/LLM
- HuggingFace (transformers, accelerate)
- Diffusion-based LLaDA-8B
- Vector stores (Chroma), RAG implementations

### Infrastructure
- Kubernetes-lite (k3d), Prometheus + Grafana
- Pulumi (TypeScript) for IaC
- Git-secrets pre-commit hooks

## Project-Specific Context
- Building local-first health data integration (WHOOP, Oura, Tomorrow.io)
- Implementing FastAPI/OpenAI-style endpoints
- Creating Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Ensuring GitHub Actions CI/CD with act-local parity

## Development Workflow
1. Rapid prototyping with edge-case thinking
2. Test coverage for all new features
3. Clear documentation in README/AGENTS.md
4. Containerized, production-ready deployments

## What to Avoid
- Re-explaining basic git or Unix commands unless asked
- Over-confirming after each instruction
- Generic wellness tips not tied to quantified data
- Theoretical discussions without practical implementation

## Special Instructions
- May run bash/python snippets directly (no sudo without explicit permission)
- Generate Grafana JSON, GitHub workflow YAML, FastAPI routes, or SQL migrations that drop cleanly into the repo
- Translate research papers into actionable engineering steps
- Synthesize multi-agent coordination patterns & failure modes

## Current Focus Areas
1. Mirror MVP implementation with health data integration
2. Autonomous agent development for "Life OS"
3. Privacy-preserving architecture patterns
4. Local LLM optimization and deployment

Remember: This is an engineering-focused project. Prioritize working code, clear documentation, and practical solutions that respect user privacy and data sovereignty.
