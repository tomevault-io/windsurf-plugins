Requirements management toolkit for Claude Code — skills, agent, and hook for structured requirements elicitation, extraction, and maintenance.

## The Problem

LLM coding sessions drift. Over a long session, Claude forgets what the system is supposed to do, conflates implementation details with requirements, re-proposes ideas that were already rejected, and lets requirements rot while the code evolves. The longer the session, the worse it gets.

This toolkit makes requirements a durable, structured artifact that survives across sessions and keeps the LLM honest.

## This Is Opinionated

This isn't a generic requirements framework. It encodes specific beliefs about how requirements should work with LLM-assisted development:

**Requirements are user-observable capabilities, not implementation details.** The litmus test: "If I changed this, would the user notice a different *capability*?" If no, it's a design decision or style choice, not a requirement. Most requirements docs fail here — they're full of implementation spec masquerading as requirements. This toolkit enforces the distinction.

**Flat atomic requirements over nested hierarchies.** Each testable behaviour gets its own ID (FR-01, FR-02, FR-03). No FR-01.1, FR-01.2. Nesting creates ambiguity about status and completeness.

**Requirements have three layers: narrative, rules, and examples.** Each FR has an Actor (who benefits), Intent (why it matters), Description (what it does), Acceptance Criteria (abstract business rules), and Scenarios (concrete examples with specific data). The acceptance criteria say *what* the rule is; the scenarios illustrate it with real data. Scenarios are required for `must`-priority FRs. Format is author's choice: Given/When/Then for behaviour-oriented specs, examples tables for data-rule specs.

**Scenarios are specifications, not scripts.** They describe what the system does in business language, not click-by-click UI flows. They should survive a complete platform rewrite unchanged. This makes them human-readable descriptions of functional expectations that can be translated into automated tests — by an LLM or traditional test tooling.

**Decisions are append-only.** Never delete or overwrite a decision — add a new one that supersedes it. This preserves the reasoning trail. Decisions also track **ownership**: LLM decisions can be freely revisited; human and client decisions are treated as given unless explicitly reopened.

**Open questions over assumptions.** When something is uncertain, record an open question rather than guessing. Questions are resolved by converting them into requirements, constraints, or decisions — never silently.

**Non-goals are first-class.** Especially for re-implementations: things that exist in the old system but are explicitly rejected for the new one. Without this, every fresh reviewer (human or LLM) rediscovers the same accidental complexity and re-proposes it.

**The glossary is not optional.** Domain terms cause more bugs than missing features. If a domain has more than three specialised terms, the glossary will prevent more bugs than any other section.

**Don't trust the LLM to remember.** The hook injects a requirements-check reminder on every user message. The system assumes Claude will forget to check — because over a long session, it will.

**Confirm before updating.** The toolkit never silently updates requirements. The main agent detects a potential change, states it, gets human confirmation, then delegates to a specialised subagent. Requirements are too important for unilateral LLM edits.

**Fresh eyes for review.** In reverse-engineering work, each review iteration uses a new subagent with clean context. Reusing a subagent means inheriting its blind spots.

## What's Here

```
skills/
  gathering-requirements/            Socratic elicitation — build requirements.md from scratch
  requirements-management/           Maintain requirements during development
  reverse-engineering-requirements/  Extract requirements from existing source code
agents/
  requirements-editor.md             Subagent that edits requirements.md/systems.md
hooks/
  req_change_hook.py                 Detects requirement changes on every user prompt
assets/
  requirements-template.md           Blank requirements.md template
  systems-template.md                Blank systems.md template
```

## Three Skills, Three Workflows

- **gathering-requirements** — Greenfield projects. Socratic elicitation from a human's head through iterative questioning. Produces requirements.md and optionally systems.md.
- **reverse-engineering-requirements** — Existing code. Subagent reads source, drafts requirements, then iterative fresh-eyes review (2-3 rounds) separates real requirements from implementation accidents and non-goals.
- **requirements-management** — During development. Keeps docs in sync as code changes. Defines the document structure, conventions, and the confirm-delegate-implement pattern.

## Architecture

```
User message → hook (lightweight check) → main agent (decides) → requirements-editor subagent (edits docs)
```
