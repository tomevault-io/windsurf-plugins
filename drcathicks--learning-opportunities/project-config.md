- `learning-opportunities/` - The skill plugin
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Plugin manifest
  - `skills/learning-opportunities/` - The skill (SKILL.md + resources)
- `learning-opportunities-auto/` - The auto-prompting hook plugin (requires `learning-opportunities`)
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Plugin manifest

## Releasing a New Version

Each plugin has its own version. When releasing, update the version in three places atomically:

1. `<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — bump `version`
2. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — bump the matching plugin entry's `version`
3. `CHANGELOG.md` — add entry at top, under the `# Changelog` heading

Use semver. All three files must show the same version string for the plugin being released. Commit all three together.
