# Project Name — Agent Instructions

This file is the entry point for any AI agent working on this repo.

## MANDATORY: Load Workflow First

Before doing any work, read these files in order:
1. **`agents/workflow.md`** — methodology and pipeline
2. **`agents/memory.md`** — project knowledge, principles, tooling
3. **`agents/journal.md`** (last ~50 lines) — recent progress
4. **`docs/plans/README.md`** — check for active plan to resume

These files govern how you work. Do not skip them.

## Project Overview

<!-- Replace with a 2-3 sentence description of what this project does. -->

**Project Name** is ...

## Repository Structure

```

```

## Key Design Principles

<!-- Replace with 3-5 principles that guide this project's architecture. -->
<!-- These should also be added to agents/memory.md under Project Principles. -->

- **Principle 1** — ...
- **Principle 2** — ...
- **Principle 3** — ...

## Working with this Repo

### Commands (run from `solution/`)

<!-- Replace with actual commands for your project. -->

```bash
# Tests
npm run test                      # Run all tests

# Lint
npm run lint                      # 0 errors expected
```

**Important:** Always run commands from the `solution/` directory.

## Conventions

### Pipeline for stories
For non-trivial work: **Story → Plan → Implement**.
See `agents/workflow.md` for the full process.

### Two documentation layers
- **Requirements + Design** — human audience, per module, what/why and how/why
- **Stories** — AI audience, actionable specs with acceptance criteria and examples

### Creating a new story
1. Create story file in `docs/stories/NNN-<story>.md` (flat, no subdirectories)
2. If new module: create requirements and design docs first
3. Add to `docs/stories/README.md`
4. Follow the pipeline in `agents/workflow.md`

### When completing work
1. Run tests and lint — both must pass
2. Check requirements and design docs are still accurate
3. Archive plan to `docs/plans/<datetime>-<story>.md`
4. Update `agents/journal.md` with summary and commit hashes
5. Mark story done in `docs/stories/README.md`

### Handling interrupts
All interrupts go to `docs/stories/README.md`. Pick up next.

### Lint Rules
- Warnings are pre-existing and acceptable
- **Errors must be zero**
