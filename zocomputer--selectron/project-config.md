# Writing modern Python: style guide

## General rules
- You can *always* assume we have all libraries installed, NO CONDITIONAL IMPORTS.
- Prefer using Pydantic models to dataclasses or TypedDicts
- Use set literals and avoid unnecessary list literals: {1,2}, not set([1,2])

## For-else statements

If you ever need to check if a for loop completes without a break, for-else statements are a great way to accomplish this without using a temporary variable.

### ===== Don't write this =====
```py
found_server = False  # Keep track of whether we found a server
for server in servers:
    if server.check_availability():
        primary_server = server
        found_server = True  # Set the flag to True
        break
if not found_server:
    # Use the backup server if no server was found
    primary_server = backup_server

# Continue execution with whatever server we found
deploy_application(primary_server)
```

### ===== Write this instead =====
```py
for server in servers:
    if server.check_availability():
        primary_server = server
        break
else:
    # Use the backup server if no server was found
    primary_server = backup_server

# Continue execution with whatever server we found
deploy_application(primary_server)
```


## Walrus Operator

If you need to define and evaluate a variable all in one expression, the Walrus Operator (new in Python 3.8 with PEP 572) is a quick way to accomplish just that.

Walrus operators are really useful for using a value right after checking if it is not None!

### ===== Don't write this =====
```py
response = get_user_input()
if response:
    print('You pressed:', response)
else:
    print('You pressed nothing')
```

### ===== Write this instead =====
```py
if response := get_user_input():
    print('You pressed:', response)
else:
    print('You pressed nothing')
```

## Short Circuit Evaluation

Short-circuit Evaluation is a shortcut for getting the “next available” or “next truthy” value in a list of expressions. It turns out you can simply chain or statements!

### ===== Don't write this =====
```py
username, full_name, first_name = get_user_info()

if username is not None:
    display_name = username
elif full_name is not None:
    display_name = full_name
elif first_name is not None:
    display_name = first_name
else:
    display_name = "Anonymous"
copy
```

### ===== Write this instead =====
```py
username, full_name, first_name = get_user_info()

display_name = username or full_name or first_name or "Anonymous"
```

## Operator Chaining

Finally, Python lets you chain comparison operators together to shorten up integer range comparisons, making them more readable than the equivalent boolean expressions.

### ===== Don't write this =====
```py
if 0 < x and x < 10:
    print("x is between 0 and 10")
```

### ===== Write this instead =====
```py
if 0 < x < 10:  # Instead of if 0 < x and x < 10
    print("x is between 0 and 10")
```

## Structural pattern matching & destructuring

```py
# Using OR pattern (|) to match multiple patterns
match day:
    case ("Monday"
          | "Tuesday"
          | "Wednesday"
          | "Thursday"
          | "Friday"):
        return "Weekday"
    case "Saturday" | "Sunday":
        return "Weekend"

# Guard clauses with inline 'if' statements
match temperature:
    case temp if temp < 0:
        return "Freezing"
    case temp if temp < 20:
        return "Cold"
    case temp if temp < 30:
        return "Warm"
    case _:
        return "Hot"

# Use walrus operator to create powerful patterns
packet: list[int] = [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07]
match packet:
    case [c1, c2, *data, footer] if (  # Deconstruct packet into header, data, and footer
        (checksum := c1 + c2) == sum(data) and  # Check that the checksum is correct
        len(data) == footer  # Check that the data length is correct
    ):
        print(f"Packet received: {data} (Checksum: {checksum})")
    case [c1, c2, *data]:  # Failure case where structure is correct but checksum is wrong
        print(f"Packet received: {data} (Checksum Failed)")
    case [_, *__]:  # Failure case where packet is too short
        print("Invalid packet length")
    case []:  # Failure case where packet is empty
        print("Empty packet")
    case _:  # Failure case where packet is invalid
        print("Invalid packet")
```

## Modern Generic syntax

Use modern Python 3.12+ generic syntax, and variadic generics when appropriate:

```py
# NEW SYNTAX - Python 3.12+
class Foo[UnBounded, Bounded: int, Constrained: int | float]:
    def __init__(self, x: UnBounded, y: Bounded, z: Constrained) -> None:
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

# Variadic generics
class Tuple[*Ts]:
    def __init__(self, *args: *Ts) -> None:
        self.values = args

# Works with any number of types!
pair = Tuple[str, int](mdc:"hello", 42)
triple = Tuple[str, int, bool](mdc:"world", 100, True)
```

## Protocols

Protocols (also known as Structural Subtyping) are typing classes in Python defining the structure or behavior that classes can follow without the use of interfaces or inheritance.

```py
from typing import Protocol

class Quackable(Protocol):
    def quack(self) -> None:
