# Claude Desktop Configuration for MCP Coroot

**IMPORTANT DOCUMENTATION POLICY**: This project maintains only two documentation files:
- `README.md` - Public-facing project documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Internal instructions and configuration details
- (Exception: `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG` files are also allowed)

Please DO NOT create any other markdown documentation files. All documentation should be consolidated into these two files.

**IMPORTANT TESTING STANDARDS**: 
This project follows professional Python testing standards:
- Test files must follow Python naming conventions: `test_*.py`
- Test files should be organized by the module they test (e.g., `test_client.py` for client functionality, `test_server.py` for server functionality)
- DO NOT use unprofessional suffixes like `test_final_*.py`, `test_new_*.py`, `test_all_remaining_*.py`, etc.
- Consolidate related tests into appropriately named test files rather than creating multiple files with incremental names
- All tests must maintain their original functionality when moved between files

## Quick Setup

### Using Published Package (Recommended)

Edit your Claude Desktop configuration:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coroot": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-coroot"],
      "env": {
        "COROOT_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "COROOT_USERNAME": "admin",
        "COROOT_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### For SSO/MFA Users

If your organization uses SSO or MFA, use session cookie authentication:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coroot": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-coroot"],
      "env": {
        "COROOT_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "COROOT_SESSION_COOKIE": "your-auth-cookie-value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To get your session cookie:
1. Login to Coroot through your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Application/Storage → Cookies
4. Copy the value of the `auth` cookie

### For Local Development

If you're developing or testing locally:

**macOS**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coroot": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "mcp-coroot"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-coroot",
      "env": {
        "COROOT_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "COROOT_USERNAME": "admin",
        "COROOT_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coroot": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "mcp-coroot"],
      "cwd": "C:\\path\\to\\mcp-coroot",
      "env": {
        "COROOT_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "COROOT_USERNAME": "admin",
        "COROOT_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication Methods

The server supports three authentication methods:

1. **Username/Password** (Recommended) - Automatic login and session management
2. **Session Cookie** - Required for SSO/MFA environments
3. **API Key** - Limited to data ingestion endpoints only

## Available Commands

Once configured, you can ask Claude to:

### Monitoring & Analysis
- "Show me all Coroot projects"
- "Check the health of all applications in production"
- "Show me error logs for the API service in the last hour"
- "Find slow traces in the payment service"
- "Analyze why the frontend has high latency"
- "Show CPU profiling data for the backend service"

### Infrastructure Management
- "List all nodes in the production project"
- "Show me the resource usage of server01"
- "Check for any incidents in the last 24 hours"
- "Display the deployment history"
- "Show me the risk assessment for our infrastructure"

### Configuration & Integration
- "Set up Slack notifications for critical alerts"
- "Configure Prometheus integration"
- "Update SLO thresholds for the API service"
- "Show me the application categorization rules"
- "Create a new application category for microservices"
- "Update the database category to include new patterns"
- "Delete the test category we no longer need"
- "Create a custom dashboard for Redis monitoring"

### Advanced Features
- "Perform root cause analysis on the payment service failures"
- "Show database instrumentation settings for PostgreSQL"
