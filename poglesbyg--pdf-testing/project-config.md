## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a specialized workflow for processing HTSF Nanopore submission forms with these core components:

### PDF Processing Pipeline (Score: 90)
- Extracts structured data from HTSF Nanopore submission forms
- Generates multiple unique identifiers per submission (UUID, short UUID, timestamp-based ID)
- Parses domain-specific metadata: project IDs, owner info, sample types, sequencing details
- Validates and structures sample information including concentrations and ratios

### Submission Management System (Score: 85)
- Implements multi-layered duplicate detection using SHA256 file hashes
- Tracks submissions through a normalized SQLite database schema
- Manages domain-specific fields for nanopore sequencing workflows
- Provides comprehensive submission statistics and analytics

### Data Extraction Engine (Score: 80)
- Specialized parsing for nanopore sequencing metadata
- Extracts and validates sample tables with concentration metrics
- Processes project-specific parameters and buffer types
- Generates structured outputs for database storage

### Search and Retrieval System (Score: 75)
- Full-text search across submission metadata
- Project and owner-based filtering capabilities
- Sample-level detail retrieval
- Export functionality for submission data

### Frontend Workflows (Score: 70)
- Specialized upload interface for PDF submissions
- Real-time duplicate detection feedback
- Interactive submission management dashboard
- Visualization of submission statistics and trends

Core business flows are organized around:
1. PDF intake and validation
2. Metadata extraction and structuring
3. Duplicate detection and tracking
4. Sample data management
5. Statistical analysis and reporting
