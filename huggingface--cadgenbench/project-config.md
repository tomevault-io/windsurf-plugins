# CADGenBench: code style

## language + runtime
- Python 3.12+. Type hints everywhere. No implicit Any.
- Synchronous everywhere. No async / asyncio anywhere in the agent
  loop, eval pipeline, or CLI. The agent loop is one Python-script-
  per-turn subprocess; the eval pipeline is straight-line.

## structure
- One concern per module. No god files.
- Keep it simple. Don't add abstractions until a second implementation demands one.

## naming
- snake_case for everything Python. No camelCase except where a library forces it.
- Classes: PascalCase. Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE.
- Files: short, one word where possible (viewer.py, validity.py,
  agent.py, prompt.py, evaluate.py).

## dependencies
- No Anthropic SDK in core modules. LiteLLM only for all LLM calls.
- No LangChain, no heavy agent frameworks. The orchestrator is plain Python.
- Add a dependency only if it replaces >50 lines of correct code.

## configuration
- Secrets via environment variables only (.env + python-dotenv).
- Config will be added when needed. Don't create config files speculatively.

## error handling
- **Never silently swallow exceptions.** If something fails, crash loudly. No bare
  `except` that logs and continues. If the pipeline depends on a step (rendering,
  validation, similarity), let it raise, the caller decides whether to retry.
- CAD *execution* errors (inside the agent loop) are the one exception: catch them,
  return structured error dicts, feed back to the agent. But infrastructure failures
  (renderer down, LLM unreachable after retries, filesystem errors) must crash.
- LLM errors: retry with exponential backoff, then raise clearly.

## no fallbacks
- **Never introduce fallbacks.** If the user asks for model / dataset / provider /
  version X and X is unavailable, stop and ask. Do not silently substitute a
  "close enough" alternative, a smaller sibling, or an older version.
- No "try A, on failure use B" logic. No default-substitution for unknown inputs.
  The correct response to "X isn't available" is to surface that to the user,
  not to paper over it.
- This applies to code paths *and* to scripts, configs, and docs (don't list
  "fallback" models in commented lines either, just list what was asked for,
  and note separately if it's unavailable).

## testing
- `tests/` mirrors `src/cadgenbench/` structure
  (`tests/common/`, `tests/eval/`, `tests/baseline/`).
- Eval tests use fixed STEP fixtures (`tests/fixtures/`,
  `tests/eval/fixtures/`), not live LLM calls. Agent tests mock the
  LLM client; nothing in `tests/` makes real API calls.

## comments
- Docstrings on all public functions and classes. Google style.
- Inline comments only for non-obvious decisions. Not for describing what the code does.

## prose style
- **No em-dashes.** Forbidden in markdown, docstrings, comments, commit
  messages, and chat output. Applies to both the Unicode character (U+2014)
  and the HTML entity `&mdash;` (this rule file is the only place either
  is allowed, since it defines them). Use a comma, colon, period, or
  parentheses instead. Reword if the sentence rhythm depends on a dash.
- **No AI-writing tells.** Avoid the patterns that mark machine-generated
  prose: "it's not just X, it's Y", "let's dive in", excessive use of
  "robust" / "comprehensive" / "seamlessly" / "leverages" / "delve",
  bullet lists that exist only to look thorough, and bold/italic peppered
  through paragraphs for emphasis. Write the way an experienced engineer
  reviewing a PR description would write: short, direct, lower-case,
  no rhetorical scaffolding.

## process: what requires explicit approval
- **Never change business logic, control flow, or stopping criteria** without asking first.
  Bug fixes are fine. Changing *when* or *why* something happens is a design decision, ask.
- If you spot a logic issue while working on something else, flag it in your response.
  Do not silently "fix" it.
- **Stop after flagging.** When you raise an issue, a question, or a choice for the user
  (numbered list, "Issue 1 / Issue 2", "Option A / Option B", "should I X or Y?"), end
  your turn there and wait. Do not keep chaining tool calls "to make progress" while
  the user is meant to be answering. One flag, then yield.

## simplicity over backwards compatibility
- **Default: simplify.** When a refactor, rename, or schema change makes the codebase
  cleaner, the default is to do the clean thing once and update all call sites, not to
  keep the old name/behaviour working alongside the new one "for safety".
- **No silent shims, no dual-pattern parsers, no "accept either" code paths** added on
  your own initiative. One naming rule, one schema, one entry point, that's the goal.
- **Ask when uncertain.** If you can't tell whether a caller outside the visible tree
  (a downstream script, a saved fixture, a script not yet rewritten) depends on the
  old shape, **stop and ask** rather than guessing. "Should I keep both for now?" is
  always a valid clarifying question.
- This applies to file naming, dataclass fields, function signatures, CLI flags,
  JSON/YAML schemas, and anything else where two ways of doing it could otherwise drift.

## git: keep it boring
- When asked to "push the changes", default to the simplest path: commit the files
