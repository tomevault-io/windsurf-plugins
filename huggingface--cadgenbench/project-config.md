# CADGenBench: project context

## what this is
A benchmark for **AI-driven CAD generation and editing**: given a
textual or visual description of a mechanical part (or an existing
STEP file plus an edit request), how well does a system produce a
valid, geometrically correct 3D model? The benchmark is
**system-agnostic** — a submission can come from an agent, a script,
or a human in a CAD tool; the contract is just `output.step` per
fixture. The repo contains the scoring engine + docs + a reference
baseline (an iterative LLM agent that writes build123d Python). Eval
itself runs on the leaderboard Space
(`HuggingAI4Engineering/cadgenbench-leaderboard`) — the GT is private,
so the Space is the only consumer.

Fixtures live in two HF dataset repos
([`cadgenbench-data`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingAI4Engineering/cadgenbench-data)
public,
[`cadgenbench-data-gt`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingAI4Engineering/cadgenbench-data-gt)
private) — resolved at runtime by `cadgenbench.common.paths`. There is
no `data/` directory in this repo any more. The set is still shifting
(parts get added, removed, or replaced as authoring catches issues),
so do not hardcode fixture names or counts anywhere; treat the inputs
dataset as the source of truth.

## scope (what to ship in v1)
- A small set of fixtures (mating-jig parts plus derived editing-task
  fixtures) under `data/inputs/` (public) + `data/gt/` (release TBD).
- Four metric axes: validity (gate), shape similarity, interface
  match, topology match. Combined as **CAD Score** = mean of
  applicable components, hard-zeroed by validity failure.
- One CLI entry point: `cadgenbench` (alias `cgb`) with subcommands
  `evaluate`, `baseline run`, `baseline package`, `report single`.
- One baseline: iterative build123d agent (no other strategies, no
  multi-library helper agents).

## critical design principles
- **CAD geometry is always loaded from BREP**, never from a
  pre-tessellated mesh. Measurements (volume, bbox, topology counts)
  come from OCCT on the BREP. Triangulation is only for the renderer
  and for mesh-pipeline sanity checks.
- **The evaluator takes a STEP file and returns a metrics dict.** It
  does not know which code (LLM, script, human) produced the geometry.
  This is what makes the benchmark generator-agnostic.
- **The LLM layer is model-agnostic.** All LLM calls go through
  LiteLLM. No Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini SDK imports in core modules.
- **Keep it simple.** No abstractions until a second implementation
  demands one. Drop dead options aggressively (we already dropped the
  multi-strategy dispatcher, the multi-library helper agents, and the
  metadata-side-metric path because none of them had a real consumer).

## key libraries
| concern | library | notes |
|---|---|---|
| CAD geometry | build123d | Python wrapper over OCCT; pip-installable via the cadquery-ocp wheel |
| OCCT bindings | OCP | ships with build123d |
| Mesh / boolean ops | trimesh, manifold3d | mesh-side validity + interface IoU |
| LLM routing | LiteLLM | unified API across providers |
| Headless render | pyvista (VTK) | mesh-based; in-process; auto GPU OpenGL when present, software OpenGL otherwise |
| Config / yaml | PyYAML | fixture descriptions, AgentConfig defaults |

## repo layout (high level)

Fixtures (inputs + ground truth) and authoring/submitter sanity scripts
live in two HF dataset repos
([`cadgenbench-data`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingAI4Engineering/cadgenbench-data),
[`cadgenbench-data-gt`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingAI4Engineering/cadgenbench-data-gt)),
resolved at runtime by `cadgenbench.common.paths`. See the top-level
README for env-var setup.

## what was removed (don't re-introduce)
Earlier iterations of this codebase tried to be many things at once;
most got cut. If you see references to any of these in old git
history, they are intentionally gone and should not come back without
explicit discussion:
- Browser-based opencascade.js WASM viewer + FastAPI/WebSocket server.
- Multi-strategy agent dispatcher (only one strategy ever existed).
- Multi-library cheat sheets (bd_warehouse, py_gearworks,
  gridfinity_build123d). The baseline uses build123d only.
- Free-text `--task` invocation of the baseline (no fixture).
- DINOv1 visual-similarity metric (a deleted `_render.py` under the
  old validator path).
- `gt_metadata` / `metadata_metrics` (weight-error side metric).
- Per-fixture `ground_truth.glb` previews.
- `gitpython` "commit per successful iteration" memory model.
- `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/agent_v0.md`, `docs/tasks/`,
  `docs/dataset_research/`, `docs/metrics_bundle.*`.
