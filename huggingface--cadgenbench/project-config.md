# CADGenBench: code audit

Pre-launch checklist for shipped code paths. Run before announcing
the leaderboard publicly.

Style basics (Python 3.12+, type hints, sync only, no fallbacks,
no silent exception swallowing) live in [style.mdc](./style.mdc).

## adhere to HF benchmark conventions
- Default to the shape established by other HF benchmark code repos.
  When something isn't otherwise pinned, do what they do.
- Reference repos:
  - [huggingface/lighteval](https://github.com/huggingface/lighteval),
    [bigcode-project/bigcodebench](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcodebench)
    (eval package layout, CLI shape)
  - [adyen/DABstep](https://huggingface.co/spaces/adyen/DABstep/tree/main)
    (leaderboard Space code, submit flow, dataset reader)
  - [huggingface/datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets)
    (Apache-2.0 LICENSE + pyproject conventions)

## no leftover code
- No `print(` for diagnostics on shipped paths. CLI user-facing
  output stays; ad-hoc traces go.
- No commented-out blocks of code. Delete or extract.
- No unreferenced functions, classes, or modules. If nothing
  imports it and no CLI invokes it, delete it.
- No dead imports.
- No leftover `XXX`, `HACK`, or `DEBUG` markers. Resolve them or
  open an issue.
- Greppable tells:
  - `print(`, `breakpoint(`, `pdb.set_trace`, `# XXX`, `# HACK`,
    `# DEBUG`.
  - `ruff check --select F401,F811,F841` for unused imports,
    redefinitions, and locals.
  - `vulture src/ AI4Engineering/` for unreferenced symbols (manual
    triage; vulture is heuristic).

## no overengineering
- Match the surface area of comparable HF benchmarks. Lighteval and
  bigcodebench are the size targets; do not exceed without reason.
- Drop abstractions that have a single consumer: factories with one
  implementation, registries with one entry, base classes with one
  subclass, config systems for two flags.
- Drop dependencies that replace fewer than ~50 lines of correct
  code (see [style.mdc](./style.mdc)).
- Manual review: walk `src/` and ask "would lighteval do this?" for
  each module. If the answer is "no, they'd inline it", inline it.

## no pre-launch TODOs
- Any `TODO` or `FIXME` referencing "before launch", "before
  release", "before announcing", "pre-launch", or "pre-release"
  must be actioned or downgraded to a tracked post-launch item.
- Greppable:
  `rg -n -i '(TODO|FIXME).*(before|pre.?launch|pre.?release|announce)'`

## no hardcoded org / paths / secrets
- Org slug `HuggingAI4Engineering` comes from env (e.g.
  `CADGENBENCH_HF_ORG`); no literal in code paths.
- No API keys, tokens, or webhook URLs in source. Secrets via env.
- No absolute filesystem paths (`/Users/`, `/home/`, `C:\`). Use
  `Path(__file__)` or env-driven paths.
- Greppable (each should return zero hits in scope):
  - `rg -n 'HuggingAI4Engineering'`
  - `rg -n '/Users/|/home/|C:\\\\'`
  - `rg -n '(sk-|hf_|ghp_|xox[baprs]-)[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}'`

## license metadata matches LICENSE
- `cadgenbench/pyproject.toml`: `license = "Apache-2.0"` and
  `license-files = ["LICENSE"]` (PEP 639).
- `cadgenbench/LICENSE` is the full Apache-2.0 text.
- Cross-check: `rg -n '^license' cadgenbench/pyproject.toml` and
  `rg -n 'Apache License' cadgenbench/LICENSE` both return the
  expected lines.

## license headers on source files
- Every `.py` file under `cadgenbench/src/`, `cadgenbench/cli.py`,
  and `AI4Engineering/` starts with the standard Apache-2.0 header
  (`Copyright 2026 Hugging Face` plus the boilerplate). Matches
  `huggingface/datasets`, `lighteval`, `bigcodebench`.
- Greppable check (run from each repo root):
  `for f in $(git ls-files '*.py'); do head -15 "$f" | rg -q 'Apache License' || echo "missing: $f"; done`

## tests pass
- `pytest -q` clean across `cadgenbench/tests/`. Run the full suite
  yourself unsandboxed (`required_permissions: ["all"]`); the
  renderer-dependent tests (`tests/common/test_viewer.py`, baseline
  end-to-end) need a real GL context the sandbox lacks, so they pass
  only unsandboxed. The non-renderer tests also run in the sandbox.
  See style.mdc "VTK renderer".

## scope
- In scope:
  `cadgenbench/src/**/*.py`, `cadgenbench/cli.py`,
  `AI4Engineering/**/*.py`, sibling scripts in
  `cadgenbench-data{,-gt}/**/*.py`,
  `cadgenbench-submissions/**/*.py`.
- Out of scope:
  `cadgenbench/tests/**` (debug prints + TODOs allowed; tests
  must still pass per the section above),
  `space-setup/**`.

## audit recipe
- Run each greppable pattern above against the in-scope paths.
- For each hit: fix, delete, or document why it survives (env-var
  contract, intentional CLI output, etc.).
