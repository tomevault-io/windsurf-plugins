# CEREBRUM Project Rules
# Overview: CEREBRUM (Case-Enabled Reasoning Engine with Bayesian Representations for Unified Modeling)
# is a cognitive modeling framework integrating case-based reasoning and Bayesian representations.
# The project includes Python source code, documentation, a scientific paper, and associated tooling.

## Code Quality
- Always use meaningful, descriptive variable and function names
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Format Python code using `black`
- Lint Python code using `flake8`
- Sort imports using `isort`
- Perform static type checking using `mypy`
- Consider using `pre-commit` hooks to automate checks (see `requirements_dev.txt`)
- Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions and classes following a standard format (e.g., Google style, NumPy style)
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting (enforced by `black`)
- Include proper error handling with descriptive error messages
- Log operations at appropriate verbosity levels (configure via `pytest.ini` for tests)

## Content Creation
- Never use placeholder text or methods in production code or documentation
- Always use real, descriptive content in all text, captions, and labels within code, documentation (`docs/`), and the paper (`paper/`)
- Ensure figure captions are complete and descriptive, especially for figures in `paper/components/figures/`
- Maintain consistent terminology (refer to CEREBRUM framework terms) throughout the codebase and documentation
- Format figure references consistently as "Figure X: Caption"
- Ensure proper cross-referencing between `docs/`, `paper/`, and code examples (`src/examples`)

## Documentation
- Document all major components (Core Engine, Models, Transformations, Visualization) with clear explanations in the `docs/` directory
- Keep documentation (`docs/`) and the paper source (`paper/`) up-to-date with code changes in `src/`
- Include executable examples in `src/examples` and reference them in `docs/`
- Ensure `README.md` provides a comprehensive project overview and entry points
- Ensure `CONTRIBUTING.md` clearly outlines the contribution process
- Maintain standardized heading levels (# for titles, ## for sections) in all Markdown files (`docs/`, `paper/`, `README.md`, etc.)
- Document tool usage (e.g., `paper/assemble_paper.py`) with command-line options and examples in relevant READMEs or `docs/`

## Project Structure
- Organize Python source code by functionality within the `src/` directory (e.g., `core/`, `models/`, `utils/`, `visualization/`, `transformations/`, `cases/`, `examples/`)
- Place all tests within the `src/tests/` directory (as specified in `pytest.ini`)
- Store general project documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Store scientific paper source files (Markdown components, figures) in the `paper/` directory (e.g., `paper/components/`)
- Store helper scripts and development tools in the `tools/` directory
- Use clear directory structures within each major component directory
- Separate configuration (e.g., `pytest.ini`, `.coveragerc`) from implementation
- Follow consistent file naming conventions (e.g., `test_*.py` for tests, as specified in `pytest.ini`)
- Maintain canonical ordering of paper components if applicable (managed by `paper/assemble_paper.py`)
- Store primary generated artifacts (e.g., final paper PDF) in `paper/output/`
- Store other generated outputs and intermediate results in the `output/` directory

## Rendering and Output
- Validate all outputs (e.g., paper PDF, model results) for accuracy and completeness
- Ensure the generated paper PDF (`paper/output/assembled_paper.pdf`) maintains consistent formatting using `pandoc` and `XeLaTeX`
- Include proper citations and references, managed within the paper source (`paper/`)
- Verify that all images and figures in `paper/components/figures/` render correctly with complete captions in the final PDF
- Ensure Mermaid diagrams in `paper/components/` are processed correctly into images (e.g., PNG) by the build script (`paper/assemble_paper.py`) before inclusion
- Insert appropriate page breaks between major sections in the paper, if manually controlled
- Implement proper table of contents and document structure in the generated paper PDF
- Use the `paper/assemble_paper.py` script for reliable paper generation

## Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages linking to issues where applicable
- Group related changes (e.g., feature implementation + tests + docs) in single commits
- Keep pull requests focused on single features or fixes
- Review code (including documentation and tests) before merging
- Track generated artifacts in `paper/output/` and `output/` separately from source documents (ensure they are in `.gitignore`)
- Document version history and significant changes in release notes or a changelog

## Testing
- Write tests using `pytest` and `hypothesis` for all new functionality in `src/`
- Place tests in the `src/tests/` directory, mirroring the `src/` structure where appropriate
- Follow test naming conventions specified in `pytest.ini`: `test_*.py` for files, `Test*` for classes, `test_*` for functions
- Use descriptive `pytest` markers (e.g., `@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, defined in `pytest.ini`) to categorize tests
