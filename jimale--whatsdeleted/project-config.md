# WhatsDeleted

Android app that recovers deleted WhatsApp/WhatsApp Business/Telegram/Signal
messages by reading the system notifications those apps post, storing them
locally, and flagging the ones that get retracted. Everything lives in
`com.tiriig.whatsdeleted`, Kotlin, single-module (`app`).

## How message capture actually works

This is the part that's easy to get wrong, so read it before touching
`NLService`.

1. `NLService` (a `NotificationListenerService`) gets `onNotificationPosted`
   for every notification on the device and filters to the four supported
   packages via `isValidApp()` (`utility/GeneralExtensions.kt`).
2. It pulls `android.title` (contact or group name) and `android.text`
   (message body) straight out of the notification extras. There's no
   structured API for this — it's whatever WhatsApp/Telegram/Signal happen
   to put in those fields, so the parsing is fragile by nature.
3. Group vs. direct chat is inferred from whether `title` contains `:` —
   WhatsApp posts group notification titles as `"GroupName: SenderName"`.
   `(N messages)` suffixes get stripped off the group name.
4. **Deletion isn't a separate system event.** When a message is deleted,
   the messaging app just posts a new notification for the same chat whose
   body is `"This message was deleted"` (WhatsApp/Telegram) or the same
   text with a trailing period (Signal). `String.isDeletionNotice()`
   catches both. When that happens, `NLService.flagLastMessageDeleted()`
   looks up the most recent stored message for that chat and marks it
   `isDeleted = true` instead of saving the notice as a new message.
5. `Notifications.notify()` then posts a local heads-up notification so the
   user knows something was deleted; tapping it sends `MainActivity` the
   `user`/`app`/`notificationDeleted` extras it needs to jump straight into
   that chat's detail screen (see `MainActivity.navigateToChatDetail()`).

If you change how titles/bodies are parsed, keep in mind `ChatRepository.saveMessage()`
also de-dupes against the last stored message for that `user`, so a
malformed `user` key silently breaks both dedup and deletion detection.

**Deletion detection is best-effort, not guaranteed.** WhatsApp doesn't
reliably re-post a "This message was deleted" notification for every
deletion anymore, so `flagLastMessageDeleted()` only catches the cases
where it still does. Don't rip this out — it's free when it works — but
don't advertise it as reliable either. The fallback the app actually
depends on is manual: the user notices a message vanished inside WhatsApp
itself, then opens WhatsDeleted to read what it said, since the original
notification was already captured and stored before it was deleted.

## Package layout

```
data/
  model/       Room entity (Chat) + small view/projection models (ChatItem, DeletedMessage)
  database/    Room database, DAO, migrations
  repository/  ChatRepository — the only thing that talks to the DAO
di/            Hilt modules (Room instance)
services/      NLService — the notification listener
ui/
  main/        SplashActivity (routes to intro or main), MainActivity (nav host + service bootstrap)
  intro/       First-run AppIntro flow, ends with the notification-access permission slide
  chat/        ChatViewModel shared by list + detail
  chat/list/   Chat list screen (grouped by conversation)
  chat/detail/ Single conversation, messages grouped by date
utility/       Extension functions, Constants-free — no dead sample data, keep it that way
```

- Everything is wired through Hilt (`@AndroidEntryPoint` / `@HiltViewModel` / `@Inject`).
  `WhatsDeleted` (the `Application` class) is the `@HiltAndroidApp` root.
- `ChatRepository` is the only class that touches `UserDao` — don't call
  the DAO directly from ViewModels or the service.
- Navigation is a single-Activity setup: `MainActivity` hosts a Navigation
  Component graph (`res/navigation/main_navigation.xml`) with two
  destinations, `chatListFragment` (start) and `chatDetailFragment`.
- The app draws edge-to-edge (`MainActivity.enableEdgeToEdge()`), so don't
  reintroduce `android:statusBarColor`/`navigationBarColor` theme items —
  they're ignored from Android 15 on anyway. `applyEdgeToEdgeInsets()` pads
  `appBarLayout` and `nav_host_fragment` with the system bar insets instead;
  if you add another top-level container to `activity_main.xml`, it needs
  the same treatment or it'll sit under the status/nav bar.

## Database

Room, entity `Chat` (table `chat`), currently at schema version 3
(`app/schemas/`, `exportSchema = true`). `MIGRATION_2_3` is a manual
migration (table rename/rebuild); `AutoMigration(from = 2, to = 3)` is also
declared in `@Database` — if you add a new migration, follow the existing
pattern of one manual `Migration` object per non-trivial schema change
rather than relying on auto-migration for anything that isn't a pure
column add.

`isDeleted` and `id` (a random 10-char base32 string from `getRandomNum()`,
not an autoincrement) are the two columns the deletion-detection flow
depends on — see above.

## Permissions the app needs to actually work

- `BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE` — granted by the user manually via
  system settings, not a runtime permission dialog. `IntroPermissionFragment`
