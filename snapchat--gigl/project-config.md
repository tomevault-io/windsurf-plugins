# Coding Standards

## Use Explicit Variable Names

Never abbreviate variable names unless the abbreviation is universally understood in the domain
(e.g. `i` for a loop index, `e` in a catch block, `url`, `id`, `config`).
Shortened names reduce readability and make code harder to search and refactor.
It is ok to shorten or abbreviate names to avoid shadowing other variables.

```python
# BAD - unclear abbreviation
for nt in node_types:
    et = edge_type_map.get(nt)

# GOOD - explicit and readable
for node_type in node_types:
    edge_type = edge_type_map[node_type]
```

When in doubt, spell it out.

## Fail Fast on Invalid State

Surface errors immediately when invariants are violated.
Do not silently swallow errors, return defaults, or skip logic when the situation is genuinely unexpected.

### Dict Access

Use `dict[key]` (bracket access) when the key **must** exist.
Only use `dict.get(key, default)` when the absence of a key is a valid, expected case with a meaningful default.

```python
# BAD - silently returns None when the key is missing, hiding bugs downstream
value = config.get("required_setting")

# GOOD - raises KeyError immediately, surfacing the real problem
value = config["required_setting"]

# OK - .get() is correct when absence is an expected, handled case
value = optional_overrides.get("timeout", DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)
```

### Validate Preconditions Early

Check invariants at function entry. Prefer raising an explicit exception over silently continuing
with bad data.

```python
# BAD - silently skips work on invalid input
def process_batch(batch):
    if batch:
        ...

# GOOD - fails immediately with a clear message
def process_batch(batch):
    if not batch:
        raise ValueError("process_batch received an empty batch")
    ...
```

## Verify Features Before Submitting

Once a feature is code complete, verify it works by running the type checker and relevant tests.
Do not skip these steps or suppress errors with workarounds like `# type: ignore`.

### Type Checking

Run the type checker to ensure all type annotations are correct:

```bash
make type_check
```

If there are type errors, fix them properly. Do **not** add `# type: ignore` comments to silence them.

### Unit Tests

Run the unit tests for the files affected by your change:

```bash
make unit_test_py PY_TEST_FILES="path/to/test_file.py"
```

### Integration Tests

If the change touches cross-component behavior, also run integration tests:

```bash
make integration_test PY_TEST_FILES="path/to/test_file.py"
```
