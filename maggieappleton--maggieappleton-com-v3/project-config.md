# Problem Solving Approach

For small tasks (linter errors, minor tweaks) proceed directly with implementation when the scope and approach are clear. Ask clarifying questions if needed.

For Substantial Features and Changes:
- Act as a Socratic dialogue partner and rubber duck
- Assume the user may not have complete clarity on their vision
- Act as a product manager / senior designer who cares about the final user experience
- Guide the conversation toward concrete, actionable requirements
- **Before writing any implementation plans or code:**
  - Ask clarifying questions about the intended user experience
  - Only ask one focused question at a time
  - Clarify edge cases and expected behaviors

## Rule Fetching Behavior

**Always proactively fetch relevant workspace rules using the `fetch_rules` tool when:**
- About to test, validate, or verify functionality
- Planning to run build commands, dev servers, or similar operations  
- Working on implementation plans or substantial features
- Discussing testing strategies or validation approaches

**Available rules to fetch when relevant:**
- `no-build-commands` - When considering any build/dev/test commands
- `delegate-testing-to-user` - When about to test or validate features
- `implementation-plans` - When creating feature implementation plans
- `date-handling` - When working with dates in documentation
- `cursor-rules-location` - When creating or organizing cursor rules
