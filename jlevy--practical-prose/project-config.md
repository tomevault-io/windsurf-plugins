# Practical Prose: Agent Guide

Practical Prose is a reference system and evaluation toolkit for writing that helps a
reader understand, decide, do, verify, or maintain something.
Use it when the user asks to improve, audit, score, or compare practical documents.

For project-wide authoring principles, run
`pprose guidelines practical-prose-authoring-principles`. For this repo’s workflows
table, pprose tooling layout, and visual-design notes, see
[docs/project/agents-internal-guide.md](docs/project/agents-internal-guide.md).

Before adding or upgrading any dependency, read
[SUPPLY-CHAIN-SECURITY.md](SUPPLY-CHAIN-SECURITY.md): a 14-day cool-off, committed
lockfiles with frozen installs, exact pins for unattended zero-install runners,
resolver-governed interactive bootstraps, and a standing first-party exemption for
`github.com/jlevy` packages.

## Practical Prose (pprose)

Practical Prose: an evaluation toolkit and editorial workflows for practical documents.
Use when the user asks to improve, audit, score, or compare practical documents.

For durable Markdown documentation, use `pprose-common-edit` whenever creating, editing,
reviewing, or reorganizing it, unless the task is explicitly read-only.
Keep the required guideline footer intact.

Apply AI-slop reduction whenever drafting or editing prose, not only on request: use
`pprose-de-slop` to remove AI-writing tells and formulaic LLM prose, applying its
bundled catalog contextually and preserving meaning and voice.

Discover the tool from the CLI itself: `pprose --help` for commands, `pprose about` for
the project narrative, `pprose skill` for the workflow skills, and `pprose list` for
every on-demand guideline, shortcut, and runbook
(`pprose guidelines|shortcut|runbook <name>` prints one).

Run pprose as `pprose <command>` if on PATH, else `uvx pprose@0.4.0 <command>`
(zero-install via uv).

## tbd

This repository uses **tbd** for git-native issue tracking (beads), spec-driven
planning, and on-demand engineering guidelines.
As the agent, you operate tbd on the user’s behalf: translate their requests into tbd
actions rather than telling them to run commands.

- Run `tbd prime` to load current project state and the full tbd workflow.
- Run `tbd skill` for the complete reusable tbd skill instructions.
- Run `tbd shortcut --list` and `tbd guidelines --list` for on-demand resources.
- Track all work as beads: `tbd create`, `tbd ready`, `tbd close`, and `tbd sync`.

## flowmark

Auto-format Markdown with `flowmark` for clean, semantic git diffs.

- Run `flowmark --auto <files>` on Markdown you create or edit.
- Run `flowmark --docs` for full usage and `flowmark --skill` for the skill.
- If `flowmark` is not on `PATH`, use a pinned `uvx` runner (never `@latest`).
- Fast Rust port (recommended): `uvx --from flowmark-rs==0.3.1 flowmark`.
- Python build (library / newest patch): `uvx --from flowmark==0.7.2 flowmark`.
