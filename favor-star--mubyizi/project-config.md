  routes/              # Route handlers (one file per domain)
  schemas/             # Zod schemas for validation and OpenAPI
  docs/                # OpenAPI route documentation descriptors
  middleware/          # auth.middleware.ts, roles.middleware.ts

  _constants/          # Role weights, API base path, OpenAPI tags
  _types/              # HonoInstanceContext, shared types

apps/api/prisma/
  schema.prisma        # better-auth base models (User, Session, Account)

```

## Build & Dev Commands

```bash
# From repo root
pnpm dev              # Start all apps (API on :3001, Web on :3000)
pnpm build            # Build all apps
pnpm lint             # Lint all packages

# From apps/api/
pnpm dev              # API with hot reload (tsx --watch)
pnpm build            # tsc → dist/
pnpm start            # Run compiled API (production)

# Database
cd apps/api && npx prisma migrate dev   # Apply migrations
cd apps/api && npx prisma generate      # Regenerate client
cd apps/api && npx prisma studio        # GUI browser
```

## API Base Path

All API routes: `/api/v1`
Docs UI: `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/docs/`
OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/docs/openapi.json`

## Role Hierarchy

Three independent RBAC levels (see `_constants/role-weights.constants.ts`):
- **System**: `SUPERADMIN > SUPPORT > USER` — SUPERADMIN bypasses all org/workplace checks
- **Org**: `OWNER > ADMIN > MANAGER > MEMBER > VIEWER`
- **Workplace**: `WORKPLACE_MANAGER > SUPERVISOR > WORKER > VISITOR`

## Environment Variables

API (`apps/api/.env`): `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_BASE_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `SERVER_URL`
Web (`apps/web/.env`): `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
