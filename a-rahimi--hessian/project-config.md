# Python Environment

Always use the virtual environment located at `/Users/ali/hessian/.venv` when running Python code.

- Use the Python interpreter directly: `hessian/.venv/bin/python`
- Or activate first: `source hessian/.venv/bin/activate`

When executing Python scripts, tests, or any Python code in this project, always
use the virtual environment to ensure consistent dependencies and package
versions.

# Code Generation Guidelines

## Coding standards

* Prefer to inline variables. If a variable is only used once, inline it. Use
  keyword args to give the result a name. If the resulting expression is
  complex, write a comment to explain what the expression does.

## Comments

Comments that preceed a code block andexplain several lines of code are
instructive and should be kept. But avoid comments that literally repeat in
Englishthe code that follows. We comments that say things that are not obvious
from a cursory reading of the code.  For example, these are all redundant
comments:

```
# Assign b to a
a = b
# Call a's callback.
a.call_callback()
```

The following comments are useful because they add some context:

```
# Save b. We're going to modify it and would like to keep it around.
a = b
# The above subtly changes the state of a. Notify its clients of that
# change.
a.call_callback()
```

## Tests

* Test files don't need a main driver. They'll always be called through pytest.
  They'll never be called as standalone programs.

* When many tests share the same local variables and objects, refactor these
  redundancies into pytest fixtures
