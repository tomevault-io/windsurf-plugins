# Cursor Rules for SimulateDev Project

## Backend Server Rules

### DO NOT start a new FastAPI backend server if one is already running
- The FastAPI backend server runs on port 8000 by default
- Before attempting to start the server, check if it's already running by testing http://localhost:8000/api/health
- If the server is already running, use the existing instance instead of starting a new one
- This prevents port conflicts and avoids multiple server instances

### How to check if backend is running:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/health
```
If this returns a JSON response with "status": "healthy", the server is already running.

### Starting the backend (only if not already running):
```bash
cd api
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Additional Notes:
- The backend serves the frontend at the root URL (http://localhost:8000/)
- API endpoints are available at http://localhost:8000/api/
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates are at ws://localhost:8000/ws/tasks/{task_id} # Cursor Rules for SimulateDev Project
