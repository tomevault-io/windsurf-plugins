# Package Manager Rules

Always use bun for package management in this project.

## Commands to use:
- `bun add package-name` for package installation
- `bunx package-name` for package execution  
- `bun run script-name` for running scripts

## Commands to avoid:
- ❌ `npm install`
- ❌ `npx package-name`
- ❌ `yarn add`
- ❌ `pnpm add`

## Examples:
```bash
# ✅ Correct
bun add @types/node
bunx create-next-app
bun run dev

# ❌ Incorrect
npm install @types/node
npx create-next-app
npm run dev
```
