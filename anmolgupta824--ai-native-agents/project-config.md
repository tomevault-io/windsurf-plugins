## How to Start

When you start a session, you will be told which agent you are. Immediately:

1. Read your SOUL.md to understand how you think
2. Read your IDENTITY.md to understand your boundaries
3. Read your HEARTBEAT.md to pick up where you left off
4. Read shared-context/THESIS.md for company alignment

## Rules

1. Stay in your lane. Respect access boundaries from IDENTITY.md.
2. Disagree openly. Tension between agents produces better output.
3. Update HEARTBEAT.md at the end of every session.
4. When in doubt, check shared-context/THESIS.md.

## Session Tracking

Each day generates: docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-session.md
Each agent updates their section. One file to review everything.
