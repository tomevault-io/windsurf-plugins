## MemRosetta (Long-term Memory)

MCP server `memrosetta` provides persistent memory across sessions.
For this environment, always use logical userId `obst`.
Do not use the macOS account name `obst2580` for memory calls.

### When to search (memrosetta_search)
When you need information not in the current context, search past memories.

### When to store (memrosetta_store)

**After EVERY response, run this checklist:**
1. Did I encounter a DECISION? (tech choice, approach selection) -> store as "decision"
2. Did I learn a new FACT? (config, architecture, project info) -> store as "fact"
3. Did the user state a PREFERENCE? (style, tool choice, pattern) -> store as "preference"
4. Did we COMPLETE something? (deploy, migration, fix) -> store as "event"
5. None of the above? -> skip, do not store.

Always include 2-3 keywords. Example:
  content: "Decided to use OAuth2 with PKCE for auth"
  type: "decision"
  keywords: "auth, oauth2, pkce"

Do NOT store:
- Code itself (belongs in git)
- File operations ("Created file X", "Modified Y")
- Debugging steps and attempts
- Simple confirmations or acknowledgments

### When to relate (memrosetta_relate)
When new information updates or contradicts existing memories, create a relation.

### Working memory (memrosetta_working_memory)
Call this at the start of complex tasks to load relevant context.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **memrosetta** (1305 symbols, 2947 relationships, 102 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/memrosetta/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/memrosetta/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/memrosetta/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/memrosetta/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/memrosetta/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |
