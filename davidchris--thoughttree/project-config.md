# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Full app development
bun install           # Install dependencies
bun run tauri dev     # Run app in development mode
bun run tauri:build   # Build production app (includes sidecar)

# Frontend only
bun run dev           # Vite dev server (port 1420)
bun run build         # TypeScript check + Vite build

# Testing
bun test              # Run tests in watch mode
bun test:run          # Run tests once

# Before committing Rust changes (CI enforces all three)
cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib
```

## Architecture Summary

ThoughtTree is a DAG-based conversation tool: React frontend (ReactFlow graph + chat panel) communicates via Tauri IPC with a Rust backend that manages Claude sessions through the Agent Client Protocol.

**Data flow:** User interaction → Tauri command → ACP client → claude-code-acp subprocess → Claude API → streaming response via Tauri events

See README.md for detailed architecture diagrams and component breakdown.

## ACP Integration Notes

The ACP client (`src-tauri/src/backend/acp/`) has critical implementation details:

- **tokio-util compat layer required:** SDK uses `futures-io` traits, not tokio's
- **Non-Send futures:** Use `#[async_trait(?Send)]` and `tokio::task::LocalSet`
- **Connection constructor order:** `ClientSideConnection::new(client, outgoing, incoming, spawn)` — outgoing (stdin) comes before incoming (stdout)
- **Permission handling:** Return `Selected { option_id }` with first option's ID to auto-approve

## Current Development State

App is released and functional. See CHANGELOG.md for version history and README.md for user documentation.

## Code Search

Structural search: `sg -lang rust -p 'pattern'` for syntax-aware matching across Rust/TypeScript. Faster than text grep for finding function defs, imports, type patterns.

## Development Guidelines

- **Test-Driven Development:** Use TDD where beneficial—write tests before implementation for complex logic, edge cases, and critical paths.
- **Security First:** All changes must improve security or maintain the current level. Never introduce vulnerabilities (XSS, path traversal, command injection, etc.).
- Boy-scout rule: leave the code better than you found it
