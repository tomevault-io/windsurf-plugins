    Oros (f.k.a. “kavachat") is an evolving codebase 
    for a multi-LLM chat application that interacts with blockchain tasks. 
    Currently, it focuses on bridging user prompts to GPT-based AI, 
    proxying requests through a stateless Golang server, 
    and rendering a React frontend. In the long term, Oros may expand 
    to encompass many single and multi-chain agentic blockchain actions (using one or more LLMs/deModels), 
    long-term memory and user-shared context, and expansion to different user-interfaces
    /entry points (TG, mobile,etc). 
  marketing: "Oros: bring deAI to any dApp".

context:
  # Summarize the main system architecture, early-stage development, and 
  # how we see the future expansion of the project.
  overview: >
    The project’s current architecture has three main components:
    1) A **Golang Proxy** that sits between the frontend and the LLM. 
       This is a stateless server exposing HTTP endpoints and routing 
       user chat requests to a remote LLM (e.g., GPT-4o). 
       It also handles partial application logic, such as 
       prompt engineering, streaming responses, and code injection prevention.

    2) A **React Frontend** that provides a chat interface. 
       Users can send messages, connect wallets, 
       and see real-time streaming replies from the proxy.

    3) **Tests** that aim to cover critical behaviors, integration points, 
       and resilience. The codebase includes unit tests (Go and TypeScript), 
       plus integration tests verifying correct LLM responses, 
       and a Docker-based environment for end-to-end checks.

  future:
    - Incorporating multi-LLM support (community open models + GPT, deModels).
    - Adding ephemeral or partial memory for conversation context. 
    - Expanding to multi-chain interactions. 
    - Evolving to multi-chain AI agent 
      that can propose on-chain transactions, orchestrate bridging, etc.
    - Expanding to other user-interfaces/entry points (TG, mobile,etc).

guidingPrinciples:
  - testCoverage: >
      Build robust, readable tests for the proxy, the UI, 
      and any integration endpoints. Achieve high coverage 
      for critical paths, ensuring behavior is documented 
      and future refactors remain safe.
  - architectureClarity: >
      Keep the stateless proxy design straightforward. 
      Defer complex session logic or advanced memory 
      to future expansions. Maintain minimal dependencies 
      for faster iteration.
  - incrementalImprovements: >
      Prioritize small, frequent PRs with clear commit histories. 
      Integrate new features behind flags or environment configs 
      to ensure stability for production usage.
  - userFocus: >
      Present a user-friendly chat UI. 
      The impetus is smooth interactions with the LLM 
      and eventually bridging real blockchain tasks. 
      Keep the developer experience in mind with clear docs 
      and function signatures.

workflow:
  codeReviews: >
    - Create a short-lived feature branch off of main or dev.
    - Open a Pull Request with a succinct description, referencing 
      the relevant issue or user story. 
    - Tag relevant reviewers (product lead, lead engineer, or others 
      if domain-specific knowledge is needed).
    - Ensure tests pass. 
    - Merge with a squash commit if approved.
  versioning: >
    We follow semantic versioning for major releases. 
    However, as the codebase is still early, we might do 
    frequent minor or patch releases with `v0.x.x`.
  ciProcess: >
    GitHub Actions / any CI pipeline runs:
      - Linting
      - Tests (unit, integration)
      - Build steps for both Go and React
      - Docker build for local e2e tests

communication:
  - platforms: >
      - Slack for day-to-day engineering + urgent matters.
      - GitHub issues and PRs for tasks, feedback, bug tracking.
      - Regular stand-ups or asynchronous updates for the core team.
  - feedbackLoop: >
      - Provide inline PR commentary for code-level suggestions.
      - Larger architectural changes should be proposed 
        to team in docs/architecture or an ADR (Architecture Decision Record).

faq:
  - "What is the main goal of this stage of dev?"
    answer: >
      Solidify core functionality (chat proxy + tests + minimal UI) 
      and ensure we can easily expand to multi-LLM or multi-chain usage.
  - "Are we storing conversation data or user sessions in the backend?"
    answer: >
      Currently, the proxy is stateless. 
      Any partial memory or session logic 
      is either ephemeral in the UI or a future enhancement.

notes:
  - >
    This .cursorrules file is living documentation. 
    Update it as the architecture evolves (e.g., multi-LLM or memory logic), 
    so new developers grasp the purpose, flow, 
    and higher-level context of Oros.
