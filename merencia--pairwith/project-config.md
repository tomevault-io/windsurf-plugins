# AGENTS.md

Ground rules for any agent (or human) working in this repo. Read this before editing anything.

## What this repo is

An open-source CLI (`pairwith`) plus a registry of developer **style profiles** — Markdown files that shape how an AI coding assistant communicates, reasons about trade-offs, and frames feedback. A profile is inspired by publicly observable aspects of a specific developer's technical work. It is **not** the real person and does not represent them.

- The CLI is infrastructure: it must be small, predictable, and safe.
- Profiles are community content: they must pass quality, consent, and non-impersonation checks. See [`PROFILE_POLICY.md`](./PROFILE_POLICY.md) and [`DISCLAIMER.md`](./DISCLAIMER.md).

## Pair programming rules

1. Don't edit code without explicit confirmation.
2. Before acting, state briefly what will change, where, and why.
3. Work in small steps. Don't make changes outside the requested scope.
4. Ask when genuinely unsure. Don't guess at contracts (command names, flags, output format).

## Test-first when there's an issue

When working from an issue: write the tests first, open a draft PR with just the tests, get alignment, then implement. Skip this flow for trivial changes.

## CLI UX (non-negotiable)

- Success output → `stdout`. Errors and progress → `stderr`.
- Exit `0` on success, `1` on user error (bad input, not found), `2` on unexpected error.
- User errors get a clear, actionable message. No stack traces unless `--verbose`.
- `--help` is authoritative documentation — keep it current.
- Respect `NO_COLOR`. Don't assume Unicode support.

## Safety

- A profile is a prompt. The CLI **never executes** profile content — it only writes files.
- By default, only write under `~/.claude/agents/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.copilot/agents/`, `~/.copilot/skills/`, or `~/.cursor/rules/`, unless the user passes `--path` explicitly.
- Never overwrite an existing file without confirmation, unless `--force`.
- Every network call has a timeout and a size limit. Sanitize any handle/URL before using it.
- Never log tokens, credentials, or third-party transcript content.

## Profile quality (for the official registry)

Profiles merged into `profiles/` must have:
- `name` and `description` in the frontmatter
- the mandatory non-impersonation header (see [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md))
- sections for Principles, Decision heuristics, Tone, and Dialogue examples (≥ 2)
- a clear consent tier declared in the PR description (see [`PROFILE_POLICY.md`](./PROFILE_POLICY.md))
- `generated` and `generated_from` in the frontmatter for any profile built from third-party public sources
- no private or sensitive personal information in the examples or author context

## AI presence

Don't add AI co-authorship to commits. Don't mention AI in commit messages, PR descriptions, or code comments. The exception is the `profiles/` directory itself — those files are prompts by design.

## Language

All repo artifacts (docs, code, commits, PRs) are in English.
