# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Zooid is an open-source pub/sub server where AI agents and humans collaborate as equals. Both publish and subscribe to channels — agents via SDK, CLI, or webhooks; humans via web dashboard, RSS, or the same CLI. Deploys to Cloudflare Workers with `npx zooid deploy`, completely free. Current version: **0.5.0**.

The full product spec is in `.specs/zooid-spec.md`. Project state and implementation status is tracked in `.specs/project-state.md`.

## Status

**Post-MVP, actively shipping.** All core features are implemented and tested: server API, SDK, CLI (15+ commands), Svelte web dashboard, OIDC auth, WebSocket real-time, directory integration. Package manager is **pnpm** (v10.7.0).

## Architecture

Monorepo with packages under `packages/`:

- **`packages/types/`** (`@zooid/types`) — Shared TypeScript types (ZooidEvent, PollResult, ChannelListItem, etc.)
- **`packages/sdk/`** (`@zooid/sdk`) — Client SDK for Node.js, browsers, and Workers. ZooidClient class with publish, subscribe, poll, tail, webhook verification.
- **`packages/server/`** (`@zooid/server`) — Cloudflare Worker (Hono + D1/SQLite). Full API: channels CRUD, event publish/poll, webhooks, WebSocket (Durable Objects), RSS/OPML/JSON Feed, OIDC auth (BFF), trusted keys/JWKS, `/.well-known/zooid.json`. Public channel polling is CDN-cached at the edge.
- **`packages/cli/`** (`zooid`) — `npx zooid` CLI (Node.js). Commands: deploy, dev, init, channel CRUD, publish, tail (-f), subscribe, token mint, server get/set, share/unshare/discover, status, history, config. Stores config at `~/.zooid/state.json`.
- **`packages/web/`** (`@zooid/web`) — Svelte 5 single-page dashboard inlined into the Worker. Real-time WebSocket with polling fallback, channel management, event feed, auth (token + OIDC), key/token management.
- **`packages/ui/`** (`@zooid/ui`) — Shared UI components (minimal, foundational)
- **`packages/homepage/`** — Astro-based docs/marketing site (in progress)

Other top-level directories: `tests/` (integration/e2e), `scripts/`.

## Testing

- **Unit tests**: colocated next to source files as `*.test.ts` (e.g. `packages/server/src/routes/channels.test.ts`)
- **Integration/e2e tests**: top-level `tests/` directory for cross-package tests (e.g. `tests/integration/publish-subscribe.test.ts`)
- Test runner: **Vitest**

## Tech Stack

| Component        | Technology                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server framework | Hono                                                          |
| Database         | Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)                                        |
| Runtime          | Cloudflare Workers                                            |
| Auth             | JWT (HS256 + EdDSA), stateless, OIDC integration via BFF      |
| Webhook signing  | Ed25519 (asymmetric, public key at `/.well-known/zooid.json`) |
| Event IDs        | ULID (time-ordered, sortable)                                 |
| CLI              | Node.js via npx                                               |
| Web dashboard    | Svelte 5 (inlined into Worker)                                |
| Schema/validation| Zod + chanfana (OpenAPI)                                      |

## Key Design Decisions

- **Auth is stateless**: JWT tokens signed with HS256 (server secret) or EdDSA (trusted external keys via JWKS). Three scope prefixes: `admin`, `pub:channel-id`, `sub:channel-id` (with wildcard support: `pub:*`, `pub:prefix-*`). OIDC group claims map to Zooid scopes for human auth.
- **Ed25519 over HMAC** for webhook signing: asymmetric means consumers verify with a public key, no shared secrets needed. Signature format: `<timestamp>.<raw_json_body>`.
- **Event payload max 64KB**. Events retained 7 days with lazy cleanup on read (no cron on Workers free tier).
- **Channel IDs**: URL-safe slugs — lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, 3-64 chars.
- **Webhook delivery is fire-and-forget** in V1 (no retries). Use `waitUntil()` for fan-out to stay within 10ms CPU limit.
- **CDN caching for public channels**: Poll responses include `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=N` so Cloudflare's CDN serves cached responses at the edge. Requires a custom domain (not `*.workers.dev`). Absorbs DDoS and poll abuse without Worker invocations.
- **WebSockets via Durable Objects** for real-time push. Polling + CDN cache for infrequently updated public channels. No SSE.

## Workers Constraints

- 10ms CPU time limit (free tier) — D1 queries are I/O and don't count. Use `waitUntil()` for webhook fan-out.
- D1: 5M reads/day, 100k writes/day on free tier. CDN caching on public channels dramatically reduces D1 reads.
- Durable Objects (SQLite backend) available on free tier — 100k requests/day, 13,000 GB-s/day duration.
- Ed25519 is native via `crypto.subtle.sign()`/`crypto.subtle.verify()`.

## Naming Conventions
