- **Cross-species conservation** of a 26 aa uncharacterized protein is notable
- **Verdict:** Genuine dark gene. Conservation across 3 species suggests functional importance despite tiny size. Interesting candidate for follow-up.

**Status: Dark gene confirmed (same as LOC128125817)**

- **Protein:** 26 aa | 100% identical to LOC128125817
- **Hypothesis:** Likely functions as a regulatory peptide or signaling molecule based on short length, high charged residues, and cross-species conservation
- **Verdict:** This is the UniProt entry for the same protein as LOC128125817. Agent correctly linked them.

### 6. LOC101060341 — Putative uncharacterized protein FLJ44672
**Status: Dark gene confirmed**

- **Organism:** Homo sapiens
- **BLAST:** No significant similarity found in any database
- **UniProt:** No results

- **Gene status:** DISCONTINUED — not predicted in later genome annotations
- **No sequence data available**
- **Verdict:** Not a real gene. Agent correctly documented the withdrawal.

**Files:**
- `LOC340313 withdrawn from NCBI.md`
- `LOC340313  Function Hypothesis.md` (template only, incomplete)

### 9. PPP3CA-DT — Protein Phosphatase 3 divergent transcript
**Status: Dark gene confirmed (understudied divergent transcript)**

- **Protein:** 469-521 aa depending on transcript
- **BLAST:** Multiple PPP3CA isoforms from various species
- **UniProt:** Q08209 — calcium-dependent, calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase
- **Note:** The parent gene PPP3CA is well-characterized, but the **divergent transcript (PPP3CA-DT)** is understudied. No UniProt protein entry exists for the DT form specifically.
