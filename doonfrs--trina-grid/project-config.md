# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TrinaGrid is a Flutter package providing a keyboard-navigable data grid widget. It supports multiple column types (text, number, date, time, boolean, select, currency, percentage, custom), in-place editing, filtering, sorting, pagination, and export (CSV, JSON, PDF). Works on web, desktop, and mobile. Fork/continuation of the discontinued PlutoGrid.

## Common Commands

```bash
flutter pub get                      # Install dependencies
flutter test                         # Run all tests
flutter test test/path/to_test.dart  # Run a single test file
flutter test --coverage              # Run tests with coverage
dart analyze                         # Check for analysis errors
dart format .                        # Format all code
dart fix --apply                     # Apply automated fixes
```

## Workflow Rules

- **IMPORTANT: After finishing any code changes**, you MUST run `dart format` on the edited files and then run `dart analyze` to check for errors. Fix any issues found before considering the task done. Never skip this step.
- If an API or feature was changed/added, check `/doc` for relevant documentation to update, and update `/doc/index.md` if a new doc page was added.

## Git Workflow

When asked to commit & push:
1. Create a new branch from the current branch (never push directly to main).
2. Commit the changes. Don't add `## Test plan` to commit messages.
3. Push the branch.
4. If fixing a GitHub issue, link it in the PR so it closes on merge.

## Architecture

### Entry Point
- `lib/trina_grid.dart` — barrel export file re-exporting all public API (~80 exports).
- Single import: `import 'package:trina_grid/trina_grid.dart';`

### Source Layout (`lib/src/`)

**Core widgets** (top-level in `src/`):
- `trina_grid.dart` — main `TrinaGrid` widget (largest file, ~46KB)
- `trina_grid_configuration.dart` — `TrinaGridConfiguration` (~98KB, all config/style options)
- `trina_dual_grid.dart` — `TrinaDualGrid` (two linked grids side by side)
- `trina_grid_popup.dart` / `trina_dual_grid_popup.dart` — popup selection modes

**Model** (`model/`):
- `TrinaColumn`, `TrinaRow`, `TrinaCell` — core data models
- `column_types/` — typed column implementations (text, number, date, boolean, select, currency, percentage, custom)

**State Management** (`manager/`):
- `TrinaGridStateManager` — central state manager, obtained via `onLoaded` callback
- `TrinaGridEventManager` — event-based communication
- `TrinaGridKeyManager` — keyboard shortcut handling
- `state/` — modular state classes (cell, column, row, filtering, dragging, column sizing, etc.)
- `event/` — event classes for grid interactions

**UI** (`ui/`):
- `cells/`, `columns/`, `scrolls/`, `miscellaneous/`, `widgets/` — rendering components

**Plugins** (`plugin/`):
- `TrinaPagination` — client-side pagination
- `TrinaLazyPagination` — server-side pagination
- `TrinaInfinityScrollRows` — infinite scroll loading
- `TrinaAggregateColumnFooter` — column footer aggregation

**Export** (`export/`):
- CSV, JSON, PDF export implementations

**Helpers** (`helper/`):
- Row/column grouping, filtering, clipboard, date/time utilities, debouncing

### Key Patterns

- **State access**: `TrinaGridStateManager` is obtained from the `onLoaded` callback (`event.stateManager`) and used to programmatically control the grid.
- **Renderers**: Customization via `TrinaColumn.renderer` (cells), `.titleRenderer` (headers), `.footerRenderer` (footers).
- **Event-driven**: Grid interactions flow through `TrinaGridEventManager` with typed event classes.
- **Plugin architecture**: Pagination and footer aggregation are implemented as separate widget plugins.

### Test Structure (`test/`)

- `scenario/` — behavior-focused tests organized by feature (filtering, editing, dragging, configuration, etc.)
- `feature/` — integration tests (multi-select, drag selection)
- `helper/` — `trina_widget_test_helper.dart` and `test_helper_util.dart` for test setup
- `mock/` — mock data builders for columns and rows

### CLI Tool (`bin/trina_grid.dart`)

Migration tool for PlutoGrid → TrinaGrid: `flutter pub run trina_grid --migrate-from-pluto-grid`

### Analysis Config

Uses `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`. Excludes `**.mocks.dart` from analysis.

### CI

- `tests.yaml` — runs `flutter test` on PRs to master
- `coverage.yml` — runs `flutter test --coverage` on push to master, uploads to codecov
