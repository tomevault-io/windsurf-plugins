# Repository Instructions for AI Agents & Developers

This repository strictly adheres to OpenAI's **Codex for Open Source** guidelines and standards. All AI agents (Codex, ChatGPT) and human maintainers MUST comply with the following architecture, coding, testing, and security contract.

---

## 1. Architectural Contract & Directory Boundaries

- `src/core/`: Contains pure business logic, analyzers, and OpenAI Codex integrations. Must remain framework-agnostic.
- `src/cli/`: Command-line entry points and interactive subcommands.
- `src/types/`: Shared TypeScript data models, contracts, and interfaces.
- `tests/`: Vitest test specifications matching 1-to-1 with core modules.

### Layer Dependency Direction
```
src/cli/ -> src/core/ -> src/types/
```
*Never import CLI modules inside core or types.*

---

## 2. Coding & Quality Standards

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Zero `any` types permitted. All functions must declare explicit parameter types and return types.
- **Immutability**: Prefer `readonly` arrays/objects for state representations.
- **Error Handling**: Use custom domain exceptions (`CodexApiError`, `ValidationError`, `SecurityAuditError`) rather than bare `throw new Error()`.
- **Async Safety**: Always wrap external network/API operations with timeout, retry, and clean failure handlers.

---

## 3. Testing Contract

- **Test Suite**: Vitest (`npm run test`).
- **Coverage Floor**: 80% line, statement, branch, and function coverage minimum.
- **Determinism**: Mock external HTTP calls or OpenAI API requests using fakes/stubs in tests.

---

## 4. Completion & Quality Gate Criteria

Before submitting any PR or marking work complete:
1. `npm run type-check` must pass cleanly without errors.
2. `npm run test` must pass with >=80% coverage.
3. `npm run build` must produce clean `dist/` JS bundles.
4. `SECURITY.md` guidelines must be satisfied (no exposed credentials or unsanitized inputs).
