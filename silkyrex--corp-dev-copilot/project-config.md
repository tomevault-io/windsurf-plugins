description: Read investment term sheets and merger agreements through a corp-dev lens. Extract key business terms, flag redlines, surface pushback-worthy issues. Use when the user says "read this term sheet", "review this merger agreement", "/read-deal-doc", or points to a deal doc (PDF, .docx, text).
---


# Read Deal Doc

The user is in corp dev. Legal owns the doc; the user owns the business items. Corp-dev lens, not legal lens.

## Input

PDF, .docx (preserve track changes if present), or pasted text.

## Output

Markdown file. Default path: `./deals/YYYY-MM-DD-<deal-slug>.md`. Override if the user gives one.

## Checklist — always emit one row per item, even if NOT FOUND

**Term sheets:**
1. Pro-rata rights
2. Financial information rights
3. Marketing rights / logo + name usage consent
4. Purchase price / valuation mechanics (pre/post, option pool treatment)

**Merger agreements:**
1. Purchase price + adjustment mechanics
2. Earnout
3. Closing conditions

Any other material business term present: include. Legal-owned items (reps, indemnity, governing law): tag `[legal-owned, FYI]`, one line only, unless unusual.

## Output template
