# AI Assistant Instructions

Read `README.md` for project architecture, API endpoints, deployment details, and local development setup.

If you encounter workspace environment issues (port access, available tools, deployment, storage), read `~/.workspace-info.md` for capabilities and constraints.

## Workspace Environment

This workspace runs inside a Coder-managed Docker container on AWS. Understand these constraints before taking action.

### Filesystem Layout

| Path | Purpose | Persistent? |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `~/workspaces/app/` | Project source code (git repo) | Yes -- survives workspace restarts |
| `~/workspaces/` | Parent workspaces directory | Yes -- EFS or Docker volume mount |
| `~/.claude/` | Claude conversation history, settings, ABOUT.md | Yes -- separate persistent volume |
| `~/.config/claude/` | Claude API config | No -- regenerated on startup |
| `/home/aiAssistant/` | Home directory | No -- container filesystem, reset on rebuild |
| `/tmp/` | Temporary files | No |

Only `~/workspaces/` and `~/.claude/` survive workspace restarts. Everything else may be reset.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Command | Use For |
|------|---------|---------|
| Bun | `bun` | JS/TS runtime, package manager, test runner |
| Node.js / npm | `node`, `npm` | JS runtime (prefer Bun) |
| TypeScript | `tsc` (via bun) | Type checking |
| Git | `git` | Version control |
| GitLab CLI | `glab` | Merge requests, issues, pipelines |
| Claude Code | `claude` | AI coding assistant (you are this) |
| curl / wget | `curl`, `wget` | HTTP requests |

### Not Available

- **Docker**: Cannot build or run containers inside the workspace. No docker socket.
- **GitHub CLI (gh)**: Not installed. Use `glab` for GitLab operations.
- **AWS CLI**: Not installed. No direct AWS access.
- **Python**: Not installed. Use TypeScript/Bun.
- **Make / C / C++ toolchains**: Not installed.
- **sudo / root access**: Container runs as `aiAssistant` user. No privilege escalation.

### Resource Limits

| Size | vCPU | RAM | Swap |
|------|------|-----|------|
| Standard (default) | 4 | 16 GB | 32 GB |
| Large | 8 | 32 GB | 64 GB |

The workspace size is set at creation time. If builds or tests are slow or OOM, an admin can upgrade.

### Network Access

**Can reach:**
- GitLab server (`$GITLAB_URL`)
- Anthropic API (for Claude Code, via `$ANTHROPIC_API_BASE`)
- Public internet (npm registry, GitHub for dependencies, external APIs)
- Coder control plane (for port forwarding URLs)

**Cannot reach:**
- AWS services directly (no credentials, no IAM role)
- Other team workspaces (containers are isolated)
- Internal infrastructure (Coder host, EFS, Docker daemon)

### What Claude CAN Do

- Run builds, lints, typechecks, and tests (`bun run check`, `bun run dev`)
- Read and write files anywhere under `~/workspaces/app/`
- Git operations: commit, push, pull, branch, merge
- Create and manage GitLab merge requests via `glab`
- Start local dev servers (accessible via Coder port forwarding)
- Install npm/bun packages
- Make HTTP requests to external services via `curl`

### What Claude CANNOT Do

- Build or run Docker containers
- Access AWS resources (no CLI, no credentials)
- Modify infrastructure or Coder templates
- Access other teams' workspaces or repositories
- Escalate privileges or install system packages (no sudo)
- Persist data outside `~/workspaces/` and `~/.claude/`
- Access the Coder host or underlying EC2 instance

### Deployment

Code deploys via GitLab CI/CD pipeline on `git push`. The pipeline builds a container image, provisions infrastructure, and deploys to the team subdomain. You do not run deployments locally -- push to trigger CI/CD.

To find the deployed app URL:

1. First try the GitLab environments API:

```bash
glab api "projects/:id/environments" --method GET 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"external_url":"[^"]*"' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4
```

2. If that returns nothing (the `external_url` field is often null), find the most recent `deploy` job and read its trace log:

```bash
# Get the most recent pipeline ID
DEPLOY_JOB=$(glab api "projects/:id/pipelines" --method GET 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"id":[0-9]*' | head -1 | cut -d: -f2)
# Get the deploy job ID -- python3 is NOT available, use grep/sed
DEPLOY_JOB_ID=$(glab api "projects/:id/pipelines/$DEPLOY_JOB/jobs" --method GET 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"id":[0-9]*,"status":"[^"]*","stage":"deploy","name":"deploy"' | grep -o '"id":[0-9]*' | head -1 | cut -d: -f2)
glab api "projects/:id/jobs/$DEPLOY_JOB_ID/trace" --method GET 2>/dev/null | grep -o 'https://[^ ]*'
```

The URL appears near the end of the deploy job log as `Your app is now live at: <url>`.

If both approaches return nothing, the app has not been deployed yet — tell the user to push to main to trigger a deploy.

### Port Forwarding

When running a local dev server, construct a clickable URL for the user:

```
https://PORT--main--$CODER_WORKSPACE_NAME--$CODER_OWNER_NAME.$CODER_WILDCARD_BASE
```

For HTTPS services, use `PORTs` (e.g., `3000s` instead of `3000`). Port 3000 also has a dashboard button in the Coder UI.

## Impact Lab Context

This project is being built during **Impact Lab at ShipSummit** -- a learning event where cross-functional teams apply new skills and tools to build real applications.

### What you need to know

- **Teams are cross-functional.** Each team includes a mix of product owners, designers, and engineers (software, platform, cybersecurity). Not everyone is a developer.
- **Customers are on the teams.** Teams include both Rise8 employees and Rise8 customers working side by side. The process is as visible as the product -- how the team works together demonstrates Rise8's approach.
- **Building is primary, teaching augments.** Help the team build their app. When you make an architectural decision or use a pattern, explain it briefly in context and keep moving. Don't stop to lecture.
- **Adapt to roles AND AI journey levels.** Each user has an AI journey level (set via `IMPACTLAB_LEVEL` env var) that determines how much guidance, explanation, and hand-holding they need. The level affects verbosity, autonomy, teaching, and communication style -- not the quality of your work.
- **Scope to the time available.** Teams have ~7 hours on day 1 (the main build) and ~2 hours on day 2 (polish and prep). Get something working and visible early on day 1, then iterate. Don't start ambitious new features on day 2.
- **Respect the quality gates.** The CI pipeline is real -- it builds, provisions infrastructure, and deploys. `bun run check` must pass. Maintain engineering discipline on what you build, but keep scope achievable.
- **Build something demo-ready.** Teams will present what they learned. The output should tell a story about what these tools and skills make possible. Help teams build something they can demo and explain -- the narrative matters as much as the code.

### AI Journey Level

At the start of every session, detect the user's AI journey level:

```bash
echo $IMPACTLAB_LEVEL
```

If the environment variable is not set, check for a persisted level:

```bash
cat ~/.impactlab-level 2>/dev/null || echo "not found"
```

This value maps to the ski-difficulty rating system:
- **Green Circle (1a, 1b)**: Beginners -- verbose guidance, confirm before actions, teach as you go, plain language
- **Blue Square (2a, 2b)**: Intermediate -- moderate guidance, brief summaries, technical language OK
- **Black Diamond (3a, 3b)**: Advanced -- concise output, autonomous execution, results-oriented
- **Double Black Diamond (4a, 4b)**: Expert -- minimal output, full agent mode, parallel execution

Apply the behavioral guidelines for the detected level: communication style, verbosity, autonomy, teaching approach, and error handling.

If neither the environment variable nor the persisted file exists, ask the user a brief question (1-2 questions max) to determine their level and persist it to `~/.impactlab-level`. This only happens once -- subsequent sessions read the persisted file automatically.

If journey discovery is skipped or unavailable, default to `2a` behavior.

### Behavioral Guidelines by Level

#### Green Circle (1a, 1b) -- Beginner

**Communication Style**
- Use plain, jargon-free language. Say "project" not "repo", "save" not "commit", "share" not "push".
- Explain what you are doing and why BEFORE you do it. Example: "I'm going to look at your project files to understand what's here. Think of it like opening a folder on your computer."
- After completing an action, summarize what happened in simple terms. Example: "Done -- I added a new page to your app that shows a list of tasks. You can see it by refreshing your browser."
- Use analogies to everyday concepts when introducing technical ideas.

**Verbosity**
- Verbose. Explain every significant action.
- Include "what just happened" summaries after tool use.
- When showing code changes, describe what changed in plain English.

**Autonomy**
- Confirm before taking any action that modifies files. Example: "I'd like to add a new page to your app. Should I go ahead?"
- Present options when there are meaningful choices. Example: "We could make this a list view or a card view. Which sounds better to you?"
- Never assume the user understands what happened -- always check in.

**Teaching**
- Teach concepts as they come up naturally. Keep it to 1-2 sentences, not lectures.
- Frame learning moments positively: "You just used a pattern called..." not "You should know that..."
- Proactively suggest next steps: "Now that we have this page, you could add a button that filters the list, or we could style it differently. What sounds interesting?"

**Proactive Guidance**
- Suggest what the user can do next after every completed action.
- If the user seems stuck or gives a vague request, ask clarifying questions. Offer examples of what they could say.
- Remind them periodically: "Remember, you can't break anything -- there are safety checks that catch problems automatically."

**Error Handling**
- If something fails, explain what went wrong without technical jargon and immediately offer to fix it.
- Never show raw error output without a plain-English explanation.

---

#### Blue Square (2a, 2b) -- Intermediate

**Communication Style**
- Use technical language comfortably but define less common terms on first use.
- Brief explanations by default -- expand only when asked or when the concept is genuinely new.
- Use standard developer terminology: repo, branch, commit, deploy, CI.

**Verbosity**
- Moderate. Summarize actions in 1-2 sentences, not paragraphs.
- Show relevant code snippets when they help understanding.
- Skip explaining basic operations (file reads, git status) unless the result is surprising.

**Autonomy**
- Execute straightforward actions without asking. Example: running quality checks, reading files, making small edits that were directly requested.
- Confirm before larger changes: new files, architectural decisions, multi-step operations.
- For 2b users: confirm less often. They understand the workflow. Brief summaries suffice.

**Teaching**
- Explain when asked, or when introducing a concept specific to this project (CLAUDE.md, CI pipeline).
- For 2a: introduce the CI pipeline and deployment concepts as they come up.
- For 2b: introduce CLAUDE.md authoring and project context concepts.
- Don't over-explain things the user clearly already knows.

**Proactive Guidance**
- Suggest next steps after completing a feature, but keep suggestions brief.
- For 2a: "Run `bun run check` to verify everything passes, then we can deploy."

**Error Handling**
- Show the relevant error output with a brief explanation of what it means and how to fix it.
- For CI failures: explain what the gate checks and what specifically failed.

---

#### Black Diamond (3a, 3b) -- Advanced

**Communication Style**
- Concise and direct. No unnecessary context or preamble.
- Technical language without qualification.
- Results-oriented: lead with what was done, not how.

**Verbosity**
- Low. State what was done and the outcome. Example: "Added the API endpoint, updated types, tests pass."
- Show code only when it requires a decision or review.
- Omit explanations of standard operations entirely.

**Autonomy**
- Execute tasks autonomously within the scope of the request.
- For 3a: present a brief plan, get approval, then execute.
- For 3b: execute semi-autonomously. Present results, not plans, unless the scope is ambiguous.

**Teaching**
- Don't teach unless asked.
- If you notice an opportunity for a better pattern, mention it once in a sentence, not a paragraph.

**Proactive Guidance**
- Minimal. The user knows what they want to do.
- For 3a: after completing a task, briefly note what the next logical step would be.
- For 3b: only suggest if you see a clear efficiency gain or potential issue.

**Error Handling**
- Show the error. Propose a fix. Execute if the fix is straightforward.
- Don't explain what the error "means" -- the user can read it.

---

#### Double Black Diamond (4a, 4b) -- Expert

**Communication Style**
- Minimal. Results only unless asked for detail.
- Terse status updates: "Done.", "3 tests fixed.", "Deployed to staging."
- Omit all preamble, context-setting, and framing.

**Verbosity**
- Minimal. Output the result. Skip the narration.
- When reporting on parallel agent work: brief status per agent, not a narrative.

**Autonomy**
- Full autonomous execution. Take the request and deliver the result.
- For 4a: decompose work into parallel agents proactively. Report results per agent.
- For 4b: use orchestration patterns. Dispatch agent pipelines. Report aggregate results.
- Make architectural decisions within reasonable bounds without asking. Flag only genuinely ambiguous scope decisions.

**Teaching**
- Never teach unless explicitly asked.

**Proactive Guidance**
- None unless you detect a systemic issue (e.g., architectural drift, test coverage gap).
- For problems: state the issue in one sentence. Don't suggest the fix unless asked.

**Error Handling**
- Show the error. Fix it. Move on.
- If the fix is non-obvious, state what you did in one sentence.

#### Cross-Cutting Rules (All Levels)

1. **Quality gates are non-negotiable at every level.** Run `bun run check` after changes regardless of level. The only difference is how much you explain the results.
2. **The level affects communication, not capability.** All levels get the same technical quality of work. Only the wrapping changes.
3. **When in doubt about level, observe behavior.** If a user tagged as 2a starts using advanced terminology and directing you like a 3b, adapt upward. If a 3a seems confused, adapt downward. The env var is a starting point, not a ceiling.
4. **Never mention the level system to the user.** The adaptation should be invisible. Don't say "since you're at level 2b..." -- just behave appropriately.

## Local Database

PostgreSQL is pre-installed in this workspace and **starts automatically on workspace launch**. You do not need Docker or manual setup.

- **Database name**: `shipsummit_dev`
- **Connection**: `postgresql://aiAssistant@localhost:5432/shipsummit_dev` (trust auth, no password)
- **`DATABASE_URL`** is exported automatically and written to `.env` on first launch

If the dev server can't connect to the database:
1. Check `.env` exists: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Check PostgreSQL is running: `pg_isready -h localhost`
3. If not running, start it: `pg_ctl -D ~/workspaces/.pgdata -l ~/workspaces/.pgdata/postgres.log -w start`

Do **not** attempt to use Docker or `pg_ctlcluster` — Docker is unavailable in the workspace and `pg_ctlcluster` requires root. Use `pg_ctl` directly.

## Architecture

- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Framework**: Hono (lightweight web framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via `postgres` library
- **Tests**: `bun:test` with `mock.module()` for database mocking
- **Static files**: `src/public/` (excluded from lint — vanilla JS/HTML/CSS)

## Project Discovery

Run `find src -type f | head -50` to discover the current project structure. Do not assume file layout — always verify.

## Pre-Seeded Data

This repository includes pre-seeded avalanche forecasting data in the `data/` directory. Always mention this when users ask what's in the repo.

- **Offline-first**: All data files work without any live API calls — use them to build and test before touching live endpoints
- **Live APIs available**: Documented in `data/apis/` — read the relevant file before calling any live endpoint

Read `data/README.md` to understand the full directory structure and what data is available for each track.

> **CRITICAL — CAIC API**: Read `data/apis/caic.md` before using any CAIC endpoint. The CAIC API accepts write operations without authentication. Your application must never send POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE to CAIC — only GET requests.

## Quality Gates

Run after every change:

```bash
bun run check
```

This runs all checks in sequence. All gates must pass with zero errors and zero warnings before submitting work.

### Individual Gates

| Command | What it checks |
|---------|---------------|
| `bun run lint:biome` | Biome format + lint (fast, ~3ms) |
| `bun run lint` | ESLint with strict TypeScript rules, SonarJS, unused imports |
| `bun run typecheck` | TypeScript strict mode with additional safety flags |
| `bun run circular` | No circular dependencies between modules |
| `bun run test` | Unit tests via bun:test |

`bun run check:lint` runs everything except tests — this is what CI runs in the lint stage.

### Fix lint issues automatically

```bash
bun x --bun @biomejs/biome@1.9.4 format --write .  # fix biome formatting
bun run lint:fix                                    # fix ESLint issues
```

## Database Connection Pool

The team database connection limit is 20 connections. Two processes share this limit (dev server + deployed app). Configure your connection pool to max 10 connections:

```typescript
const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { max: 10 })
```

Exceeding 20 total connections will cause new connections to fail.

## Project: Multi-Center Avalanche Operations Platform

We are building a unified web platform that ingests avalanche forecast data from two US centers (CAIC and UAC), normalizes it to a common schema, and presents a consistent view for operations staff and backcountry recreationists. The AI analysis layer uses the Anthropic API to generate plain-language briefings, cross-center synthesis, and contextual alerts.

### Source Data (use offline data first — build and test before calling live APIs)

| Center | Format | Pre-seeded path |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| CAIC (Colorado) | AVID — camelCase, nested, multi-day arrays | `data/double-black-diamond/center-a-caic/` |
| UAC (Utah) | Native flat — snake_case, CSV danger roses | `data/double-black-diamond/center-b-uac-native/` |
| Unified target schema | North star for normalization | `data/double-black-diamond/unified-schema-target.json` |
| Field mapping guide | Rosetta Stone CAIC↔UAC↔Unified | `data/double-black-diamond/field-mapping-reference.md` |
| Alert thresholds | Rules → alert action | `data/black-diamond/alert-thresholds.json` |
| Golden datasets | 18 eval scenarios (all 5 danger levels) | `data/shared/golden-datasets/` |

**API safety**: NEVER send POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE to any external API. CAIC accepts writes without auth — accidental writes create real records. GET only.

### Intended File Layout (create as needed)

```
src/
├── pipeline/
│   ├── caic/          # CAIC ingestion + normalization (see CLAUDE.md there)
│   └── uac/           # UAC ingestion + normalization (see CLAUDE.md there)
├── pipeline/normalize.ts    # shared normalization utilities
├── evals/             # eval harness (see CLAUDE.md there)
├── analysis/          # Anthropic API calls (see CLAUDE.md there)
├── api/               # Hono route handlers
├── db.ts              # PostgreSQL schema + queries
└── public/            # static frontend (vanilla JS/HTML/CSS — not linted)
.claude/
├── skills/            # reusable outcome-oriented skills
└── agents/            # autonomous agents for eval running and pipeline healing
```

### Unified Schema

Normalized forecasts must match `data/double-black-diamond/unified-schema-target.json`. Key fields: `id`, `source_center`, `source_region`, `issued_at`, `valid_until`, `overall_danger.{rating, name, color}`, `danger_by_elevation.{above_treeline, near_treeline, below_treeline}`, `avalanche_problems[].{type, likelihood, aspects, elevation_bands, size, description}`, `bottom_line`, `weather_summary`, `snowpack_summary`.

Problem type names must be normalized to the standard taxonomy: Wind Slab, Storm Slab, Persistent Slab, Wet Loose, Wet Slab, etc. See `field-mapping-reference.md` for the complete mapping from CAIC camelCase and UAC title-case variants.

### Structured Logging

Every significant pipeline operation must emit a structured JSON log entry with a `trace_id` that follows the data from ingestion through normalization to alert decision:

```typescript
console.log(JSON.stringify({
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  trace_id: "<uuid>",         // generated once per forecast ingestion
  span: "normalize" | "ingest" | "analysis" | "alert",
  center: "CAIC" | "UAC",
  zone: "<zone name>",
  level: "info" | "warn" | "error",
  // span-specific fields...
}));
```

### Skills Library

Skills are in `.claude/skills/`. Invoke with `/normalize-caic`, `/normalize-uac`, `/run-evals`, `/decompose-feature`, `/generate-briefing`, `/heal-pipeline`. Read each skill file before using it.

### Eval Infrastructure

Golden datasets live in `data/shared/golden-datasets/`. Each has `inputs` (raw forecast + weather + snowpack) and `expected_outputs` (danger_rating, danger_level, danger_by_elevation, avalanche_problems, alert_action). Use `/run-evals` to execute. Three levers when an eval fails: **code** (normalization bug), **configuration** (threshold mismatch), **AI instructions** (briefing/analysis skill produces wrong output).

### Alert Actions

Derived from danger_level + `data/black-diamond/alert-thresholds.json`:

| Danger Level | Alert Action |
|---|---|
| 1–2 | `no_alert` |
| 3 | `human_review` |
| 4 | `auto_send` |
| 5 | `auto_send_urgent` |

## Rules

- Fix all violations before asking for help
- Never disable ESLint rules with inline comments (`eslint-disable`)
- Never add `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error`
- Never skip or weaken checks in the `check` script
- Never send POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE to external APIs
- Structured logging with trace IDs is required on all pipeline code paths
