### Loan Manager Role
- Can see their OWN reports (Player Assessments, Flags, Clips) that they created
- Can see ALL Loan Reports regardless of who created them
- Filter: `(USER_ID = current_user.id OR PURPOSE = 'Loan Report')`
- This allows them to work like a scout but also view everyone's loan reports
- No access to analytics or admin features

### Scout Role
- Can only see their OWN scout reports (filtered by USER_ID)
- Limited to reports they personally created
- No access to analytics or admin features

## Notes
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Focus on minimal, targeted changes
- Test role-based access thoroughly
- Backend handles all filtering logic (frontend just displays results)
