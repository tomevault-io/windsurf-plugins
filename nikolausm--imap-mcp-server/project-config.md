# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an IMAP MCP (Model Context Protocol) server built with TypeScript that provides comprehensive IMAP email integration with secure account management and connection pooling.

## Common Development Commands

- Build the project: `npm run build`
- Run in development mode: `npm run dev`
- Start the compiled server: `npm start`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **MCP Server (`src/index.ts`)**: The main entry point that sets up the MCP server using the McpServer class from the MCP SDK.

2. **Services**:
   - `ImapService`: Manages IMAP connections, email operations, and folder management with connection pooling
   - `AccountManager`: Handles secure account storage with AES-256 encryption

3. **Tools**: MCP tools are organized into three categories:
   - `account-tools.ts`: Account management (add, remove, list, connect, disconnect)
   - `email-tools.ts`: Email operations (search, read, download attachments, mark, delete, move, bulk delete, send, reply, forward)
   - `folder-tools.ts`: Folder operations (list, status, unread counts)

### Key Design Decisions

- Uses `node-imap` for IMAP protocol implementation
- Implements connection pooling to efficiently manage multiple IMAP connections
- Stores encrypted credentials in `~/.imap-mcp/accounts.json`
- All MCP tools return JSON-formatted text responses
- TypeScript for type safety with comprehensive type definitions in `src/types/`

## Adding New Features

When adding new IMAP operations:
1. Add the operation to the appropriate service (`ImapService`)
2. Create or update the corresponding tool in the tools directory
3. Ensure proper error handling and connection management
4. Update types if needed in `src/types/index.ts`
