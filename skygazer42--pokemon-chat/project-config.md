# Agent Instructions (pokemon-chat)

This repository contains a FastAPI backend (`server/`, `src/`) and a Vue3 frontend (`web/`), plus Docker Compose infra (`docker/`).

## Quick Commands

- Backend lint: `python -m ruff check server src scripts`
- Backend format check: `python -m ruff format --check server src scripts`
- Backend tests: `python -m pytest`
- All checks (CI-like): `make check` (runs backend + frontend checks)
- Docker (from repo root):
  - App only (api + web): `make docker-up`
  - App + infra (neo4j/milvus/mysql/...): `make docker-up-infra`
  - Full (app + infra + mcp): `make docker-up-full`

## Repo Layout

- `server/`: FastAPI app + routers
- `src/`: core logic (agents, retrieval, graph, stores, utils)
- `web/`: Vue3 frontend (Vite)
- `docker/`: dockerfiles + `docker-compose.yml` + nginx config
- `scripts/`: bootstrap/doctor/import helpers
- `resources/`: data/models/cache (often mounted into containers; large assets may be excluded from Docker build context)

## Skills

A "skill" is a set of local instructions stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Available skills in this session:

- `skill-creator`: Create/update skills that extend Codex with specialized knowledge/workflows/tooling.
  - File: `C:/Users/luke/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md`
- `skill-installer`: Install Codex skills into `$CODEX_HOME/skills` from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.
  - File: `C:/Users/luke/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md`

### When to Use a Skill (Trigger Rules)

- If the user names a skill (either `$SkillName` or plain text), OR the task clearly matches a skill description above, use that skill for that turn.
- Multiple skill mentions mean use all of them.
- Do not carry skills across turns unless the user re-mentions them.

### How to Use a Skill (Progressive Disclosure)

1) Open its `SKILL.md` and read only enough to follow the workflow.
2) If it links to extra folders (e.g. `references/`), open only what is needed (do not bulk-load).
3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running/patching them instead of retyping large blocks.
4) If templates/assets exist, reuse them instead of recreating.

### Coordination

- If multiple skills apply, use the minimal set that covers the request and state the order.
- Announce which skill(s) you are using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, state why.

## Local Conventions

- Prefer `rg` for searching.
- Avoid PowerShell `||` in commands; use `; if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { ... }` when needed.
- Keep tests offline-safe by default; avoid hard-failing when optional services (Neo4j/Milvus/MySQL) are not running unless a feature flag is enabled.
