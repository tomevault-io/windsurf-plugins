## Output guidelines

After completing a task:

- Summarize changes in a few bullet points
- Mention important decisions or trade-offs
- Keep it short and direct
- Do not explain obvious steps

## Docs entrypoint

Before performing repo-specific tasks, first check `docs/index.md` and follow the relevant indexes to verify whether the repository documents conventions, workflows, or constraints that apply to the task.
If the documentation defines a convention or workflow relevant to the task, follow it.

## Security

For security-sensitive work, read `SECURITY.md`.
Use it when touching server authority, persistence/session flows, Lune tooling with filesystem/process/network access, CI/release behavior, or dependency/update surfaces.

## Roblox Studio MCP

Do not create or edit scripts, ModuleScripts, LocalScripts, or other code containers through the Roblox Studio MCP tools.
Use the Roblox Studio MCP only to inspect, visualize, query, or validate the live Studio state.

All code and script changes must be made in the repository filesystem.
This project uses Rojo, and filesystem changes are the source of truth that sync into Roblox Studio automatically.

If a script or module needs to be created, changed, moved, or deleted, do it in the repo files, not in Studio through MCP.
