description: Subagent model quality requirements — never use fast/cheap models for code generation

# Subagent Quality Policy

When delegating work to subagents via the Task tool:

- **Never** specify `model: "fast"` for code-generating subagents (codegen-alpha, codegen-beta, codegen-gamma, testing-agent, security-agent).
- Always use the default (inherited) model for substantive work.
- The `fast` model may only be used for trivial lookups or file searches via `explore` subagents.
- All failing tests must be investigated and fixed — never dismissed as "pre-existing".
