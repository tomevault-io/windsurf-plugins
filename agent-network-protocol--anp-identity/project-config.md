# Repository Guidelines

- Scope v1 to E1 identities. Do not add K1, PlainLegacy, P-256 legacy E2EE,
  backup, root-provider rekey, or root-control rotation. The approved private-key
  egress exception is the default-off `root-export` Rust API used by the
  existing `RootKeyEnvelopeV1` transfer flow. Do not generalize it to other key
  roles or expose it through the default Node binding.
- Keep all comments, documentation comments, errors, and logs in English.
- Except for the explicit Rust root-key export, private key material must never
  appear in a public API output, FFI export, serialized DTO, debug output, or
  error message. The root export and Rust import inputs must use zeroizing
  raw/DER bytes, be non-serializable and non-`Debug`, and never use ordinary
  `String` PEM.
- All mutating storage paths must take the store's cross-process exclusive lock
  and use generation/CAS checks. Recovery and orphan cleanup follow the same rule.
- `PublicationUncertain` may only transition through reconcile. It must never
  expose a direct abort path.
- Add or update tests in the same task as every behavior change. Keep tests in
  dedicated test files unless private helper access requires a small unit test.
- Prefer the existing `anp` crate and the referenced im-core vault code over
  duplicate cryptographic or storage implementations.
- Keep `key-import` as a permanent, default-off feature and exclude it from the
  default Node binding. General migration import is allowed only while the
  target identity does not exist and must verify every private key against the
  DID document public method before committing.
- Root transfer senders emit the existing `RootKeyEnvelopeV1` format only. The
  Rust host must explicitly enable `root-export` and preserve its
  user-confirmation gate before calling the root export. Do not add format
  negotiation or automatic wrapped/legacy fallback.
- A Rust host may receive an authenticated legacy `RootKeyEnvelopeV1` and pass
  its root key through the dedicated zeroizing legacy-root ingress. That path is
  receive-only, requires an existing rootless identity with the same pinned
  root fingerprint and verified transfer evidence, and must never persist the
  plaintext in a persistent DTO, journal, log, or temporary file. A malformed
  or unknown wrapped envelope must never be retried through the legacy parser.
