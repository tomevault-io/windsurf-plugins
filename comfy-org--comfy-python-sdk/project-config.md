# AGENTS.md

Working notes for AI coding agents. Everything here is enforced by
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) or by a script in
[`scripts/`](scripts/) — it is not style advice.

Read the two traps first. Both of them pass local review and fail CI.

---

## Trap 1 — do not hand-edit the generated models

`src/comfy_low/models/_generated.py` is **emitted by
[`scripts/gen_models.sh`](scripts/gen_models.sh) from
[`spec/openapi.yaml`](spec/openapi.yaml)**. It is committed to the tree, so it
looks like ordinary source, and nothing local will stop you editing it:

- ruff skips it — `extend-exclude = ["src/comfy_low/models/_generated.py"]`
- ruff format skips it for the same reason
- mypy lists it in `exclude`

So a hand-edit lints clean, formats clean, and the tests may well still pass.
The `codegen-drift` CI job then regenerates the file into a temp dir and
compares it **byte for byte** against the committed one
([`scripts/check_drift.py`](scripts/check_drift.py)). Any hand-edit fails there.

`spec/openapi.yaml` is *also* not yours to edit: it is a one-way vendored copy
of the canonical contract (see [`spec/README.md`](spec/README.md)). Editing the
spec to make drift pass is the wrong fix in the other direction.

### What is generated vs hand-written

| Path | Status |
|---|---|
| `src/comfy_low/models/_generated.py` | **Generated.** Never hand-edit. |
| `spec/openapi.yaml`, `spec/router-openapi.yaml`, `spec/VERSION` | **Vendored**, synced one-way. Never hand-edit. |
| `src/comfy_low/models/__init__.py` | Hand-written. Re-exports names from `_generated.py`; if a schema is added or renamed, update the import list and `__all__` here yourself — codegen does not touch this file. |
| everything else under `src/comfy_low/` | Hand-written (transport, SSE decoder, errors, multipart). |
| everything under `src/comfy_sdk/` | Hand-written. This is the public SDK surface. |

### Regenerate

```bash
uv run --extra codegen bash scripts/gen_models.sh   # rewrites src/comfy_low/models/_generated.py
uv run --extra codegen python scripts/check_drift.py  # the exact check CI runs
```

`check_drift.py` runs two checks, not one: the byte-for-byte model comparison
above, and the Router error-type comparison described under "Other things that
are not obvious" below. Both run on every invocation, so a failure in one does
not hide the other.

Then commit `src/comfy_low/models/_generated.py`.

Two things that bite here:

- `gen_models.sh` is a **bash** script, not Python. `python scripts/gen_models.sh`
  does not work.
- The generator version is load-bearing. `datamodel-code-generator` is pinned
  to `~=0.68.1` in `pyproject.toml` precisely because the drift check is a
  byte-for-byte comparison — a different generator version reformats the output
  and reports false drift. Do not bump that pin as a drive-by.

## Trap 2 — mypy gates every PR, and nothing in the repo advertises it

There is no `typecheck` script, no Makefile, no pre-commit config. The only
place the type check exists is a step in `ci.yml`. If you only run the tests,
you will push a red PR.

The four steps of the `test` job, in order, are the complete required set:

```bash
uv run --extra dev ruff check .          # lint
uv run --extra dev ruff format --check . # formatting (check only, does not write)
uv run --extra dev mypy src              # type check — NOT the whole repo, just src/
uv run --extra dev pytest -v             # tests
```

Notes on the invocations:

- `uv.lock` is committed, so `uv run` is the reliable local path. The dev tools
  live in the **`dev` extra**, not in a dependency group, so they are not part
  of the default sync set — without `--extra dev` the tools are not installed.
  (`uv run` re-syncs the environment each invocation, so pass `--extra dev`
  every time rather than relying on an earlier `uv sync`.)
- CI itself does not use uv. It runs `pip install -e .[dev]` and then the bare
  commands above. Either path must produce the same result.
- `mypy src` deliberately excludes `tests/`. Do not "fix" a PR by widening it.
- `ruff format --check` only reports. Use `ruff format .` to actually apply.

The `test` job runs on the full matrix `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`, `3.13`. The
floor is real: `requires-python = ">=3.10"`, and ruff/mypy are both configured
for `py310`. Anything newer than 3.10 syntax breaks a quarter of the matrix.

## The other two CI jobs

### `public-repo-hygiene`

This repo is public. [`scripts/check_public_repo_hygiene.py`](scripts/check_public_repo_hygiene.py)
scans every git-tracked file (except its own source and
`src/comfy_low/models/`) and fails on three categories:

1. **Ticket-shaped identifiers** — anything matching `[A-Z]{2,6}-\d{2,6}`.
   Common tech acronyms are handled by an explicit allowlist in the script.
2. **Internal collaboration-tool links/markers** — Notion, Slack archive and
   client links, Google Docs/Drive, Datadog, PostHog project links, Linear, and
   `incident-<n>` strings.
3. **References to a `Comfy-Org/<repo>` outside the known-public allowlist**,
   and `@Comfy-Org/<team>` handles outside the known-public team allowlist.
   This is default-deny: an unlisted name is flagged, not silently permitted.
