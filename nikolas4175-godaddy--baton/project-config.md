# Baton — agent guide

Baton is a WordPress plugin (v0.4.0) that chains [Abilities API](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/abilities/) abilities into saved workflows. Admins compose workflows in **Tools → Baton**, run them from the admin, and each published workflow is also registered as its own ability (`baton/workflow-{post_id}`) for nesting and external tooling.

## Requirements

- WordPress **6.9+** (Abilities API: `wp_get_abilities`, `wp_get_ability`, `wp_register_ability`)
- PHP **7.4+**
- Node/npm only when changing the React editor (`src/`)

## What we built

### Core concepts

| Concept | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Workflow storage | CPT `baton_workflow` (no public UI); definition in post meta `_baton_workflow_definition` |
| Step execution | `Baton_Workflow_Runner` — sequential steps via `WP_Ability::execute()` |
| Data between steps | **Data filters** (`input_mappings`) on connectors between ability cards; dot-path extraction via `Baton_Input_Mapper` |
| Workflow-as-ability | `Baton_Workflow_Abilities` registers `baton/workflow-{id}` under category `baton-workflows` |
| Nested workflows | Runner passes a `workflow_stack` and rejects cycles |
| Admin catalog | `Baton_Ability_Catalog` + `Baton_Schema_Paths` expose schemas, I/O summaries, and mappable paths to JS |

### Workflow definition (meta JSON)

```json
{
  "initial_input": {},
  "steps": [
    {
      "ability": "plugin/ability-slug",
      "input": {},
      "use_previous_output": false,
      "input_mappings": [
        { "source": "previous", "path": "0.plan_id", "target": "plan_id" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`input`**: static JSON merged into the step (edited per step in the editor).
- **`use_previous_output`**: legacy flag; runner still honors it when no mappings exist.
- **`input_mappings`**: maps from `initial` (step 1 only) or `previous` step output via dot paths into ability input fields. Scalar abilities use an empty `target` and path-only rows.
- Sanitization: `Baton_Workflow_CPT::sanitize_definition()` + `Baton_Input_Mapper::sanitize_mappings()`.

### Execution flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Admin[Tools → Baton] --> Editor[React editor saves meta]
  Admin --> RunPanel[admin-run.js AJAX]
  Editor --> Meta["_baton_workflow_definition"]
  RunPanel --> Runner[Baton_Workflow_Runner]
  Runner --> Map[Baton_Input_Mapper]
  Map --> Ability[wp_get_ability → execute]
  Meta --> Reg[Baton_Workflow_Abilities]
  Reg --> Ability
```

Hooks: `baton_before_step`, `baton_after_step` (see `class-workflow-runner.php`).

### Admin UI

- **List** (`includes/admin/class-workflow-list-table.php`): hero banner (`assets/images/baton-banner.png`), search, `WP_List_Table` (DataViews deferred until core default).
- **Edit** (`includes/admin/class-admin.php`): title/excerpt form + hidden field `baton_workflow_definition` synced from React; abilities/definition bootstrapped as JSON in `<script type="application/json">` tags.
- **Run** (`assets/admin-run.js`): AJAX action `baton_run`, displays step-by-step report.

### Visual editor (Phase 3)

- **Stack**: `@wordpress/scripts` → `build/index.js` (commit `build/` for installs without npm).
- **Entry**: `src/index.js` mounts `WorkflowEditor` on `#baton-editor-root`.
- **UI** (`src/editor/App.js`): vertical **ability step** cards; **data filter** slots between steps (compact “Add data filter” when empty, full card when mappings exist); I/O chips open schema modals; mapping modal drafts rows until **Done**.
- **Ability picker**: native `<select>` with `<optgroup>` per ability category (`groupAbilitiesByCategory` in `utils.js`) — `@wordpress/components` `SelectControl` does not support optgroups.
- **Styles**: `assets/baton-editor.css`, list/run styles in `assets/admin.css`.

## Development commands

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins/baton   # or clone path
npm install
npm run build                  # after any src/ change
npm start                      # watch mode while editing UI
npm run lint:js
composer install
npm run check                  # static only (matches php-lint + js CI jobs)
npx wp-env start               # Docker required
npm run test:php
```
