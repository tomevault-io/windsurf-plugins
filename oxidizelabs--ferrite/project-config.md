# Concurrency Control Guidelines

When working with concurrency components, ensure ACID properties while maximizing performance.

## Transaction Management

### Transaction Lifecycle
- Implement proper transaction state management
- Handle transaction begin, commit, and abort correctly
- Maintain transaction isolation levels
- Integrate with recovery manager for durability

### Transaction Context
```rust
// Proper transaction context usage
let txn = transaction_manager.begin_transaction(isolation_level)?;
let result = execute_with_transaction(&txn, || {
    // Perform operations
    Ok(result)
});
match result {
    Ok(value) => txn.commit()?,
    Err(e) => txn.abort()?,
}
```

## Lock Manager Implementation

### Two-Phase Locking (2PL)
- Implement proper 2PL protocol
- Growing phase: acquire locks as needed
- Shrinking phase: release all locks at once
- No lock acquisition after first release

### Lock Types and Compatibility
- Implement shared (S) and exclusive (X) locks
- Consider intention locks (IS, IX) for hierarchical locking
- Maintain lock compatibility matrix
- Handle lock upgrades and downgrades safely

### Deadlock Handling
- Implement deadlock detection algorithms
- Use timeout-based deadlock resolution
- Consider wound-wait or wait-die policies
- Log deadlock occurrences for analysis

```rust
// Deadlock detection pattern
impl LockManager {
    fn detect_deadlock(&self, txn_id: TransactionId) -> Option<Vec<TransactionId>> {
        // Build wait-for graph
        // Detect cycles using DFS
        // Return cycle if found
    }
}
```

## Isolation Levels

### READ_UNCOMMITTED
- Allow dirty reads
- Minimal locking overhead
- Suitable for read-heavy analytical workloads

### READ_COMMITTED
- Prevent dirty reads
- Use short-duration read locks
- Allow non-repeatable reads

### REPEATABLE_READ
- Prevent dirty and non-repeatable reads
- Hold read locks until transaction end
- May allow phantom reads

### SERIALIZABLE
- Prevent all anomalies
- Use predicate locking or validation
- Highest isolation, lowest concurrency

## Watermark Management

### Transaction Ordering
- Implement transaction timestamp ordering
- Handle timestamp allocation efficiently
- Use watermarks for garbage collection
- Maintain transaction commit ordering

### Snapshot Isolation
- Implement proper snapshot creation
- Handle snapshot visibility rules
- Manage snapshot cleanup
- Optimize snapshot storage

## Performance Optimization

### Lock Granularity
- Balance lock granularity with concurrency
- Consider table-level vs. row-level locking
- Implement hierarchical locking when beneficial
- Use lock escalation to reduce overhead

### Contention Reduction
- Minimize critical section duration
- Use lock-free data structures where possible
- Implement proper backoff strategies
- Consider partitioning hot resources

### Throughput Optimization
- Batch lock acquisitions when possible
- Use efficient data structures for lock tables
- Minimize lock manager overhead
- Profile and optimize lock contention points

## Recovery Integration

### Write-Ahead Logging
- WAL entries must be written before data modifications
- Ensure proper log record ordering
- Handle log force operations correctly
- Integrate with checkpoint operations

### Transaction Abort
- Implement proper rollback semantics
- Undo all transaction modifications
- Release all acquired locks
- Clean up transaction state properly
