# Buffer Pool Management Guidelines

When working with buffer pool components, follow these specific patterns and best practices.

## Core Principles

- **Always pin pages before use, unpin when done**
- Handle page eviction carefully - check if page is dirty before eviction
- Use proper locking hierarchy: page table → free list → individual pages
- Implement LRU-K algorithm correctly for page replacement

## Buffer Pool Operations

### Page Management Pattern
```rust
// Pin page before use
let page_guard = buffer_pool.fetch_page(page_id)?;
// Use page
let result = page_guard.read().process();
// Page automatically unpinned when guard drops
```

### Locking Hierarchy
1. Acquire page table lock first
2. Then free list lock if needed
3. Finally individual page locks
4. Always release in reverse order

### Error Handling in Buffer Operations
- Handle `PageNotFound` errors gracefully
- Check for buffer pool full conditions
- Properly handle page eviction failures
- Log page I/O errors with context

## LRU-K Implementation

- Track K most recent accesses for each page
- Use efficient data structures for access history
- Handle concurrent access to LRU-K data structures
- Implement proper backward K-distance calculation

## Page Replacement Policy

- Prefer pages with largest backward K-distance
- Handle tie-breaking consistently
- Consider page dirtiness in replacement decisions
- Implement efficient eviction victim selection

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize lock contention in hot paths
- Use atomic operations for statistics
- Batch page operations when possible
- Avoid unnecessary page copies
