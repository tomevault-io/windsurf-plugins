### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- For frontend work that involves a redesign, layout change, or other significant style choice that cannot be determined from the codebase alone, use the tmp-html skill first and prototype the direction in /tmp before touching the real codebase.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

### 5. Build Verification

**After every change, verify with non-interactive checks.**

Run before reporting work as done:
```
npm run build
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
These commands must succeed with zero errors and zero warnings. Warnings are bugs — dead code and unused fields mean speculative code crept in (see §2).

For changes touching Tauri startup, config, permissions, bundling, or app-shell integration, also run:
```

```

Do not use `npm run tauri dev` as routine verification. It starts an interactive dev server and may conflict with other users or processes.

### 6. Documentation Synchronization

**Keep `docs/architecture/*` and `src-tauri/assets/seed/_SYSTEM.md` in lockstep. Every implementation divergence must be reflected in these files immediately.**

- `docs/architecture/` holds the architectural source of truth, split one file per subsystem (see [docs/architecture/README.md](docs/architecture/README.md) for the index). It must reflect the current implementation to the detail level (exact CLI flags, event names, field names, etc.). When code diverges (flags removed, flow changed, commands altered, new features added), update **only the file(s) covering the affected subsystem** in the same commit — don't load or rewrite the whole directory for a localized change.

- `src-tauri/assets/seed/_SYSTEM.md` is the general-purpose system prompt injected into every CC turn regardless of mode. Keep it accurate:
    - **Do not document MCP tools here.** Tools are advertised automatically via MCP server handshaking — duplicating them in `_SYSTEM.md` wastes context and gets stale.
    - When the wiki layout changes (new files, renamed paths, restructured dirs), update the layout block.
    - When behavioral rules change (new agent expectations, updated conventions), update the rules list.
    - `_SYSTEM.md` contains: wiki layout reference, universal agent rules, and the experiment workflow instructions.

### 7. Parallel Intervention

**Be aware of possible multi-agent collaboration in the codebase**

Multiple agents may be working simultaneously. If you see errors in files you did NOT edit, do not try to fix them. Wait 30 seconds and retry - the other agent is likely mid-edit.

### 8. Git Hygiene

**Do not stage, track, or commit work unless the user explicitly asks.**

- Do not run `git add`, stage untracked files, or create commits unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- Never add `Co-authored-by` trailers or otherwise mark commits as co-authored.
