# Go Development Rules

1. Use Go standard library packages whenever possible
2. Only use `golang.org/x/*` packages if needed and not available in stdlib
3. Keep each feature in a single, complete file
4. Each file should be independently runnable with all necessary imports
5. Use Go modules for dependency management (`go mod init`, `go get`)
6. Follow Go best practices:
   - Proper error handling (no ignored errors)
   - Standard naming conventions
   - Proper package organization
   - Comprehensive comments and documentation
7. NEVER add third party packages without permission
8. NEVER trust training data for package APIs
9. ALWAYS verify against current Go docs at https://pkg.go.dev/
10. ALWAYS run `go get` to add dependencies, never edit go.mod manually
11. ALWAYS check package documentation before using any function
12. DO NOT create new directories without permission
13. Pin all dependency versions in go.mod
14. Include proper error handling and logging
15. Write tests for all functionality

ALWAYS explain package suggestions with:
1. Package popularity metrics (stars, major users)
2. How it will simplify the code
3. What problems it solves
4. Why it's the right choice for the task
