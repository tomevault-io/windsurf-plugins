# Harness Mobile Copilot entry point

Read `AGENTS.md` before proposing or changing code. It is the canonical project policy.

- For a scoped module, read its nearest `AGENTS.md` before editing.
- Search `Vendor/`, `Dependencies/`, upstream Harness, and OpenMinis before creating a new abstraction.
- Use targeted `rg` plus small `sed` windows for large files; do not load whole aggregators.
- Run the smallest relevant tests first, then the repository validation required by `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not claim iPhone behavior is verified without device evidence. Never record secrets in code, tests, diffs, or diagnostics.
