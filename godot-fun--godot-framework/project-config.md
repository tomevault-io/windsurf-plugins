# GDScript (this project)

- **Types**: Use explicit types on function signatures and return values (`-> void`, etc.). Use the `class_name` type when a class has one. **Prefer `:=` for locals** to lock in the inferred type at declaration; use `var x = ...` only when you need Variant or mixed types.
- **Docs**: Use `##` comments for scene entry points or complex logic. Match the tone of nearby files.
- **Nodes**: Prefer `@onready var name: Type = $Path`.
- **Trailing pass**: If a function has no `return` statement, end the body with `pass`.

# Underscores and naming (Godot 4)

**`_` is mainly for engine callbacks** (`_ready`, `_process`, `_notification`, `_init`, etc.). **Do not prefix business methods** like `_refresh_xxx` — that clutters the file with `_` like lifecycle hooks. Use `_` on variables sparingly for internal details. GDScript has no real private; use structure and folders instead.

**Member variables**: Normal state/refs usually **no `_`** (`player`, `news_cache`). Too many `_` names hurt autocomplete and search, and look like lifecycle hooks. Use `_` only for clear implementation details (`_http_client`, `_buffer`, `_is_loading`). Official small demos often use `var _speed`; large projects do not need that pattern everywhere.

| Kind | Naming | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Engine lifecycle | `_ready`, `_process`, `_input`, `physics_*`, etc. | Keep the official `_` prefix. |
| Normal members | `player`, `ui_panel`, `news_cache` | **No** `_` prefix. |
| Internal vars | `_http_client`, `_buffer`, `_retry_count` | Implementation detail; **use sparingly**. |
| Signal handlers | `on_buy_pressed`, `on_timer_timeout`, or `handle_buy`, `handle_close` | **No** `_on_*`; keep separate from engine hooks. |
| Business / utils | `refresh_trendings`, `set_tab`, `load_config_file` | **No** `_` prefix; distinguish from lifecycle funcs. |

When connecting signals in `_ready`, prefer:

```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
	button.pressed.connect(on_buy_item)
	pass

func on_buy_item() -> void:
	pass

func refresh_ui() -> void:
	update_labels()
	pass
```
