## PCB CLI Subcommands

- `cargo run -p pcb -- build [PATHS...]` — build and validate Zener designs.
- `cargo run -p pcb -- test [PATHS...]` — run tests declared in `.zen` files.
- `cargo run -p pcb -- fmt [PATHS...]` — format `.zen` files.
- `cargo run -p pcb -- layout --no-open [PATHS...]` — generate/update KiCad layout files without opening KiCad.

## Development Workflow

- `cargo test -p <crate>` — run tests for one crate.
- `cargo fmt` — format Rust code.
- `uv run pytest crates/pcb-layout/src/scripts/lens/tests/ -v` — run the Python layout-lens tests when changing `crates/pcb-layout/src/scripts/lens/`.

Never run `cargo insta accept` without explicit user approval.

## Where to Look

- Start with `README.md` for product context and user-facing CLI behavior.
- `crates/pcb/src/main.rs` declares CLI subcommands; each subcommand usually has a matching file in `crates/pcb/src/` (`build.rs`, `layout.rs`, `fmt.rs`, `test.rs`, etc.).
- `crates/pcb-zen-core/src/lang/` contains Zener built-ins, core values, type conversion, validation, and evaluation semantics. Check `docs/pages/spec.mdx` when changing user-visible language behavior.
- `crates/pcb-zen/src/` provides higher-level workspace/dependency resolution, package cache, diagnostics plumbing, and LSP integration around `pcb-zen-core`.
- `crates/pcb-sch/src/` is the schematic/netlist data model, BOM helpers, KiCad netlist export, and `# pcb:sch` comment handling.
- `crates/pcb-layout/src/` generates and synchronizes KiCad layouts. The Python lens implementation is in `crates/pcb-layout/src/scripts/lens/`; read `crates/pcb-layout/README.md` before changing sync behavior.
- `crates/pcb-kicad/src/` wraps KiCad tooling and KiCad-specific checks; `crates/pcb-sexpr/src/` handles low-level S-expression parsing/rewriting for KiCad files.
- `crates/pcb/src/import/` implements `pcb import`; start with `crates/pcb/src/import/README.md` and `flow.rs` before changing the import pipeline.
- `crates/pcb-eda/` and `crates/pcb-component-gen/` handle external EDA artifacts and generated Zener component modules.
- `crates/pcb-diode-api/` contains API/auth/search/BOM-matching client logic.
- `stdlib/` contains the Zener standard library; `examples/` and `test-workspaces/` are useful runnable designs.
- Use `docs/pages/packages.mdx` for workspace, dependency, and package behavior.

## Working Rules

- Prefer the smallest correct change and match existing crate/module boundaries.
- Avoid adding cross-crate abstractions until a boundary is already shared in the existing code.
- In `.zen` files, remember Zener is Starlark-based, not Python: do not use f-strings.
- Language behavior may come from the pinned `diodeinc/starlark-rust` fork in `Cargo.toml`; check that fork when local code does not explain Starlark behavior.

## Documentation Rules

- For user-visible changes, add one succinct `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `Unreleased` per logical change.
- If you change Zener syntax, built-ins, core types, imports/modules, or type rules, update `docs/pages/spec.mdx`.
- If you change workspace manifests, dependency resolution, or package behavior, update the relevant docs in `docs/pages/`, especially `docs/pages/packages.mdx`.
- If you change stdlib APIs or examples, prefer a focused docs/example update over broad documentation churn.

## Verification

- Run the narrowest relevant check first: usually `cargo test -p <crate>`, a focused `cargo run -p pcb -- ...` command, or the layout-lens pytest command above.
- Do not run full-workspace checks after every small edit.
- If snapshot tests change, call that out and leave snapshot acceptance to the user.
