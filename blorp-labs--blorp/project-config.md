# Blorp

The role of this file is to describe common mistakes and confusion points that agents might encounter as they work in this project. If you ever encounter something in the project that surprises you, please alert the developer working with you and indicate that this is the case in the CLAUDE.md file to help prevent future agents from having the same issue.

## Plans

When creating plans, prepend the date and use a short descriptive name based on the task content (e.g., "2026-03-09-refactor-auth-flow", "2026-03-09-fix-notification-badge").

## Verification

After making changes, always run these checks before considering work complete:

```
pnpm test:ts
pnpm test
pnpm lint
```

## ESLint

- Do not add `eslint-disable` comments without explicit developer approval. Many of our lint rules exist specifically to require a human decision — disabling them silently defeats the purpose.
- In particular, `local/no-query-hooks-in-components` exists to force a conscious choice when a query hook is used in a component. If you encounter a violation, ask the developer whether it should be fixed or suppressed, and if suppressed, ask them what justification note to put in the comment.

## TypeScript

- Prefer satisfies over as when writing TypeScript
- Do not silently change `||` to `??` when fixing type errors — they are not the same. If you are certain it should be ?? you can ask the developer to confirm.
