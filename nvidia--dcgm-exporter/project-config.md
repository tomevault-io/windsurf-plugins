description: Metric CSV, exporter counter, and Prometheus exposition contracts
---


# Metrics Contracts

- Metric CSV rows have exactly three fields: field name, Prometheus type, help.
- Exporter-owned counters must stay aligned across code, CSV examples, docs,
  tests, and `llms.txt`.
- Do not invent metric names or labels.
- Prometheus families must have stable HELP/TYPE metadata and unique label
  sets.
- Run `go test ./internal/pkg/counters` after metric guidance or counter
  changes.
