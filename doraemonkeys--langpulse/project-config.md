# Repository Guidelines

## Project Overview

- [PROJECT_OVERVIEW](docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)

## Test / Validation Commands

Repo root:

```powershell
make ci
```

## Rules

- **Explain "Why", not "What"**: Use comments to explain design rationale, business logic constraints, or non-obvious trade-offs. Code structure and naming should inherently describe the "what."
- **Design for Testability (DfT)**: Favor Dependency Injection and decoupled components. Define interfaces via Traits to allow easy mocking, and prefer small, pure functions that can be unit-tested in isolation.
- **Principle of Least Surprise**: Design logic to be intuitive. Code implementation must behave as a developer expects, and functional design must align with the user's intuition.
- **No Backward Compatibility**: Pre-v1.0 with no external consumers to protect. Prioritize first-principles domain modeling and logical orthogonality; favor refactoring core structures to capture native semantics over adding additive flags or 'patch' parameters.
- **Avoid Hardcoding**: Extract unexplained numeric and string values into named constants.
- Don't name your package util, common, or misc. Packages should differ by what they provide, not what they contain.


## Go Specifics

- **Accept Interfaces, Return Structs**: Define interfaces where they are used (consumer side), not where they are implemented.
- **Hard Requirement**: Project CI enforces a **90% minimum test coverage**.
- Never store context inside a struct.

## Other

Design decisions should be documented in docs/clarifications.
