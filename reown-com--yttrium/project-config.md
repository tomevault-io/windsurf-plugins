## Workflow

Rust `just lint` as your linting tool. It will internally run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` with the full configuration.

## Rust coding rules

- Avoid creating functions unless they are necessary to reduce a significant amount of code duplication
- Avoid extra variable bindings
- Make the code and tests consise
  - Avoid adding comments and newlines unless they are important for code readability

## Playwright rules

- Avoid `waitForTimeout()` at almost all costs (the test itself should not be dependant on timing). There must be a very good reason to add a timeout.
