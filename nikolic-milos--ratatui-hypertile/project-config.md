# Rust coding guidelines

* Prioritize code correctness and clarity. Speed and efficiency are secondary priorities unless otherwise specified.
* Do not write organizational comments or comments that summarize the code. Comments should only explain "why" the code is written in some way when the reason is tricky or non-obvious.
* Prefer implementing functionality in existing files unless it is a new logical component. Avoid creating many small files.
* Avoid using functions that panic like `unwrap()`, instead use mechanisms like `?` to propagate errors.
* Be careful with operations like indexing which may panic if the indexes are out of bounds.
* Never silently discard errors with `let _ =` on fallible operations. Always handle errors appropriately:
  - Propagate errors with `?` when the calling function should handle them
  - Use explicit error handling with `match` or `if let Err(...)` when you need custom logic
* Avoid creative additions unless explicitly requested
* Use full words for variable names (no abbreviations like "q" for "queue")

# AI coding assistants

Adapted from the Linux kernel's [AI Coding Assistants](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/coding-assistants.rst) guide. See also [AI_POLICY.md](AI_POLICY.md).

## Licensing

All contributions must be compatible with the project's MIT license.

## Signed-off-by

AI agents MUST NOT add `Signed-off-by` tags. Only humans can certify the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). The human submitter is responsible for:

* Reviewing all AI-generated code
* Ensuring compliance with licensing requirements
* Adding their own `Signed-off-by` tag if they sign off
* Taking full responsibility for the contribution

## Attribution

Contributions made with AI tools should include an `Assisted-by` tag in the commit message:

    Assisted-by: LLM [TOOL1] [TOOL2]

`[TOOL1] [TOOL2]` are optional specialized analysis tools that were used (e.g. miri, cargo-fuzz, cargo-semver-checks). Basic development tools (git, cargo, rustc, clippy, editors) should not be listed.

## Finding and fixing bugs

When an AI assistant is used to find and fix bugs, it MUST follow at least these steps:

1. Note the commit ID and locate the bug as instructed.
2. For any bug that is not trivial, verify that it is real by writing a failing test or another reproducer. Stop here if it turns out to be wrong.
3. Write a fix for the bug, in the same session where possible.
4. Build and verify the fix with the reproducer. Drop any fix that doesn't work and try another one. The fix must not add warnings and must pass `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy` and the test suite.
5. Commit the fix with a message describing the problem and the solution, and reference the issue if there is one. Do not add a `Signed-off-by` tag, and add an `Assisted-by` tag as described above.
6. Say what could not be done. If the fix could not be built or tested, or no reproducer could be produced, say so explicitly.
7. Do not open issues, pull requests or comments unless the human asks you to. Leave the result to them for review. Report anything that looks like a security issue privately to the maintainer, not in a public issue.

# Rules hygiene

This `.rules` file is read by every agent session. Keep it high-signal.

## After any agentic session

If you discover a non-obvious pattern that would help future sessions, include a **"Suggested .rules additions"** heading in your PR description with the proposed text. Do **not** edit `.rules` inline during normal feature/fix work. Reviewers decide what gets merged.

## High bar for new rules

Editing or clarifying existing rules is always welcome. New rules must meet **all three** criteria:

1. **Non-obvious**: someone familiar with the codebase would still get it wrong without the rule.
2. **Repeatedly encountered**: it came up more than once (multiple hits in one session counts).
3. **Specific enough to act on**: a concrete instruction, not a vague principle.

## What NOT to put in `.rules`

Avoid architectural descriptions of a crate (module layout, data flow, key types). These go stale fast and the agent can gather them by reading the code. Rules should be **traps to avoid**, not **maps to follow**.

## No drive-by additions

Rules emerge from validated patterns, not one-off observations. The workflow is:

1. Agent notes a pattern during a session.
2. Maintainer validates the pattern in code review.
3. A dedicated commit adds the rule with context on *why* it exists.
