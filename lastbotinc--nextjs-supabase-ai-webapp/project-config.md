## Core Workflows
Define high-level tasks. Follow the `## Request Processing Steps` below to execute these.

<workflows>
  <use_tools>
    - **Goal:** Execute project-specific tools listed under `<command_line_tools>`.
    - **Steps:**
      1. Identify the correct command and options based on the user request and tool definition.
      2. Use `run_terminal_cmd` to execute the command.
  </use_tools>

  <document>
     - **Goal:** Update documentation files.
     - **Steps:**
       1. Read relevant documentation files (`*.md`).
       2. Scan the files in the repository and read the main files to understand the project and it's scope regarding the feature or subsystem to be documented.
       2. Use `edit_file` to make necessary updates based on the task. Focus on the specific files mentioned in the `<documentation>` section (e.g., `ai_changelog.md`, `todo.md`, `learnings.md`).
  </document>

  <research>
  - **Goal:** Understand a task or topic thoroughly before planning.
  - **Steps:**
    1. **Gather Context:**
        - Read relevant `*.md` files from `<documentation>`.
        - Fetch relevant `*.mdc` rules using `fetch_rules`.
        - Use `codebase_search` to find relevant existing code snippets.
        - Use `web_search` for external information, documentation, or examples (perform at least one search).
    2. **Analyze & Plan:**
        - Synthesize gathered information.
        - Outline the plan: What needs to be done? What tools are required?
        - Identify any missing information needed from the user.
    3. **Present Findings:** Clearly state the analysis, plan, and any questions for the user.
  </research>

  <fix>
  - **Goal:** Diagnose and resolve an error.
  - **Steps:**
    1. **Gather Context:**
        - Read `docs/learnings.md` for previous solutions (`read_file`).
        - If error messages contain URLs, use `web_search` to understand them.
        - Fetch relevant `*.mdc` rules (`fetch_rules`).
        - Use `web_search` for general error resolution information.
    2. **Iterative Fixing Loop:**
        a. **Hypothesize:** Based on context, identify 1-2 likely causes.
        b. **Validate Hypothesis (Optional but Recommended):** Use `edit_file` to add temporary logging, then use `run_terminal_cmd` to run relevant tests/code and observe logs.
        c. **Implement Fix:** Use `edit_file` to apply the proposed code change.
        d. **Validate Fix:** Use `run_terminal_cmd` to run tests or execute the relevant code path.
        e. **Record Outcome:**
            - If fixed: Update `docs/learnings.md` with the solution (`edit_file`). Delete `/temp/fix_backlog.md` if it exists (`delete_file`).
            - If not fixed: Create or update `/temp/fix_backlog.md` with what was tried (`edit_file`). Return to step (a). *Do not loop more than 3 times on the same core issue without asking the user.*
  </fix>

  <validate>
  - **Goal:** Implement and run tests, fixing any failures.
  - **Steps:**
    1. **Understand Requirements:**
        - Read `docs/architecture.md` for testing practices (`read_file`).
        - Fetch `implement-unit-tests.mdc` rule (`fetch_rules`).
    2. **Write Unit Tests:**
        - Use `edit_file` to create/update unit test files (e.g., `__tests__/*.test.ts`).
    3. **Run & Fix Unit Tests:**
        - Execute tests using `run_terminal_cmd` (e.g., `npm test`).
        - If errors occur, use the `<fix>` workflow to resolve them.
    4. **Write E2E Tests:**
        - Use `edit_file` to create/update E2E test files (e.g., in `cypress/`).
    5. **Run & Fix E2E Tests:**
        - Execute tests using `run_terminal_cmd` (e.g., `npm run cypress:run`).
        - If errors occur, use the `<fix>` workflow to resolve them.
    6. **Document:** Ensure any non-trivial fixes are documented in `docs/learnings.md` as part of the `<fix>` workflow.
    7. **Repeat:** Continue until all relevant tests pass.
  </validate>

  <record>
   - **Goal:** Document completed work and update the task backlog.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Use `edit_file` to add a summary to `docs/ai_changelog.md`.
     2. Use `edit_file` to update the status (✅, ⏳, ❌) of the relevant task(s) in `docs/todo.md`. **Do not remove tasks.**
  </record>

  <design>
   - **Goal:** Design a frontend feature.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Read `docs/frontend.md` for UI/UX guidelines (`read_file`).
     2. Describe the design (components, layout, flow) and use `edit_file` to update `docs/frontend.md`.
     3. Generate required images/illustrations using `run_terminal_cmd` with appropriate image generation tools (e.g., `gemini-image-tool`, prefer `imagen` or `gemini` models). Specify output folder like `public/images`.
     4. Optimize generated images using `run_terminal_cmd` with `image-optimizer`.
     5. Briefly summarize the design and generated assets for the user.
  </design>

  <develop>
   - **Goal:** Implement the code for a feature (frontend/backend).
   - **Steps:**
     1. Fetch relevant rules (`implement-*.mdc`) using `fetch_rules`.
     2. Use `edit_file` to implement the required code changes across necessary files (components, API routes, types, etc.). Ensure imports and dependencies are handled.
  </develop>
