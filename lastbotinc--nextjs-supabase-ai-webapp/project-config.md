# Translation Management Tools and Workflows

This guide covers the practical aspects of managing translations in the project, including tools, scripts, and workflows.

## Available Translation Management Scripts

The project includes several npm scripts to help manage translations:

```bash
# Split monolithic locale files into namespace-based files
npm run split-locales

# Check for missing translations between locales
npm run check-translations

# Import translations from external sources for local development
npm run import-translations:local

# Import translations from external sources for production
npm run import-translations:prod
```

## Working with Namespaced Translation Files

After running `split-locales`, the translation files are organized by namespace under locale-specific directories:

```
messages/
├── en/                  # English translations
│   ├── Index.json       # Homepage translations
│   ├── Blog.json        # Blog-related translations
│   └── ...
├── fi/                  # Finnish translations
├── sv/                  # Swedish translations
└── ...
```

Each namespace file contains translations for a specific feature or component, making them easier to manage and update.

## Translation Workflow

### Adding New Content

1. **Identify the Namespace**:
   - Determine which namespace the new content belongs to (e.g., `Blog`, `Auth`, `Common`)
   - If no suitable namespace exists, consider creating a new one

2. **Update Each Locale**:
   - Add the new keys and English translations to `en/[Namespace].json`
   - Add corresponding translations to `fi/[Namespace].json` and `sv/[Namespace].json`
   - Maintain the same key structure across all locale files

3. **Verify Completeness**:
   - Run `npm run check-translations` to ensure all translations are present
   - Address any missing translations identified by the script

### Updating Existing Translations

1. **Locate the Keys**:
   - Identify the namespace containing the keys to update
   - Open the corresponding files in each locale directory

2. **Make Coordinated Changes**:
   - Update translations in all locale files to maintain consistency
   - Ensure any placeholders are preserved across all translations
   - When changing keys, update all references in code as well

3. **Verify Changes**:
   - Test the updated translations in the UI
   - Run `npm run check-translations` to verify completeness

## Translation Report

The `localization-report.md` file provides a comprehensive overview of translation coverage:

```markdown
# Localization Report

## Namespace Coverage

| Namespace | en | fi | sv |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|
| About    |  ✅ |  ✅ |  ✅ |
| Account  |  ✅ |  ✅ |  ✅ |
| ...      |  ✅ |  ✅ |  ✅ |

## Summary

Total namespaces across all locales: 16

### en
- Namespaces: 16
- Missing namespaces: None

...
```

Use this report to identify:
- Missing namespaces in specific locales
- Translation coverage across the application
- Areas that need attention

## Best Practices for Translation Management

### Version Control

1. **Commit Translations Separately**:
   - Keep translation changes in separate commits from code changes
   - Use descriptive commit messages: `feat(i18n): Add blog post editor translations`

2. **Review Process**:
   - Have translations reviewed by native speakers when possible
   - Create separate PRs for significant translation updates

### Organization

1. **Consistent Hierarchy**:
   - Keep translations organized in a logical hierarchy
   - Limit nesting to 3-4 levels for readability
   - Use consistent naming conventions for similar elements

2. **Comments for Context**:
   - Add comments in code to provide context for translators
   - Include sample usage or screenshots if needed

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Audits**:
   - Run `npm run check-translations` regularly to catch missing translations
   - Review translation quality periodically
   - Remove unused translation keys

2. **Backup Strategy**:
   - The `backup/` directory contains the original monolithic files
   - Create additional backups before making significant changes

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Missing Translations

If `check-translations` reports missing translations:

1. **Identify the Gap**:
   - Note which keys are missing in which locales
   - Check if entire namespaces are missing or just specific keys

2. **Fill the Gaps**:
   - Add the missing translations to the appropriate files
   - Use placeholder text if actual translations aren't ready

3. **Verify Fixes**:
   - Run `check-translations` again to ensure all issues are resolved

### Namespace Synchronization

If namespaces become out of sync:

1. **Run `split-locales` Again**:
   - This will regenerate the report and highlight discrepancies
   - Check the report for missing namespaces

2. **Manual Fixes**:
   - Create any missing namespace files
   - Copy structure from existing locales and add appropriate translations

## Adding a New Language

To add support for a new language:

1. **Create Directory Structure**:
   - Create a new directory for the locale (e.g., `messages/de/` for German)
