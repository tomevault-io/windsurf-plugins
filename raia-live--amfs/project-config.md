# AMFS Memory — Agent Behavioral Rules

You have access to AMFS (Agent Memory File System) through MCP tools. AMFS gives you a **persistent brain** — memory that survives across sessions, agents, and machines. Use it to build institutional knowledge over time.

## MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Set Your Identity

> **You MUST call `amfs_set_identity` before doing anything else.** Without it, all your work is attributed to a generic default and you won't appear as a distinct agent on the AMFS dashboard.

```
amfs_set_identity("<role-name>", "<one-line description of current task>", model="<your-model-name>")
```

Always pass `model=` with your LLM model name (e.g. `"claude-4-opus"`, `"gpt-4o"`, `"claude-3.5-sonnet"`). This is recorded in decision traces so we know which model made each decision.

**Sticky identity**: Once set, the identity is saved to `~/.amfs/.identity` and automatically restored in future sessions — even across process restarts (e.g. Claude Desktop). You only need to call `amfs_set_identity` again to change roles or update the description.

Use `amfs_whoami()` to check the active identity. Use `amfs_reset_identity()` to clear it.

**Naming rules:**
- Use **kebab-case role/domain names** that persist across conversations about the same topic.
- Good: `"dashboard-agent"`, `"stripe-agent"`, `"api-agent"`, `"infra-agent"`, `"mcp-agent"`
- Bad: `"fix-button-color"` (too specific — won't be reused), `"agent-1"` (meaningless)
- If you're continuing work a previous agent started, **use the same name** to build on their knowledge.
- The description should say what you're doing *right now* (e.g. `"Fixing tag rollback for slashed names"`).

## When to GET BRIEFED (start every session with context)

- **Before starting any work**: Get a compiled briefing from the Memory Cortex. This gives you pre-compiled knowledge about the entities you're about to work on — what other agents know, recent risks, external events, and confidence-ranked facts. This is your most important first step.
  ```
  amfs_briefing(entity_path="<repo>/<module>")
  ```
- Then recall your own specific memories and search for details:
  ```
  amfs_recall("<repo>/<module>", "<relevant-key>")
  amfs_search(entity_path="<repo>/<service-or-module>")
  ```
- **Before making architectural decisions**: Get a briefing first, then check specific patterns.
  ```
  amfs_briefing(entity_path="<repo>/<module>")
  amfs_search(query="<topic>", min_confidence=0.5)
  ```
- **When encountering errors**: Check if the Cortex or another agent already has context.
  ```
  amfs_briefing(entity_path="<repo>/<module>")
  amfs_search(query="<error-keyword>")
  ```

## When to READ FROM another agent

- **When consulting another agent's work**: Explicitly read from their brain so the knowledge transfer is tracked.
  ```
  amfs_read_from("<agent_id>", "<repo>/<module>", "<key>")
  ```
- **When you know which agent has the answer**: Direct cross-agent read is faster and more traceable than search.

## When to WRITE memory (form a memory)

- **After completing a task**: Form a memory of what was done and why.
  ```
  amfs_write("<repo>/<module>", "task-summary-<short-desc>", "<what you did and key decisions>")
  ```
- **When discovering a pattern**: Write it with pattern_refs for cross-referencing.
  ```
  amfs_write("<repo>/<module>", "pattern-<name>", "<pattern description>", pattern_refs=["related-key"])
  ```
- **When finding a bug or risk**: Record it so other agents are warned. Use `memory_type="belief"` for hypotheses.
  ```
  amfs_write("<repo>/<module>", "risk-<name>", "<what could go wrong>", confidence=0.8, memory_type="belief")
  ```
- **When making a non-obvious decision**: Record the reasoning for future agents.
  ```
  amfs_write("<repo>/<module>", "decision-<topic>", "<decision and rationale>")
  ```
- **When logging actions taken**: Record what you did so future agents can retrace steps. Experiences decay slower.
  ```
  amfs_write("<repo>/<module>", "action-<desc>", "<what you did>", memory_type="experience")
  ```
- **When consulting external tools or APIs**: Record the context so decision traces are complete.
  ```
  amfs_record_context("<label>", "<summary of what was found>", source="<tool name>")
  ```

## When to RECORD DECISIONS (build the causal chain)

- **When a decision is made** (by you or the user): Record it so the decision trace is complete.
  ```
  amfs_record_context("user-decision", "User chose thread-local approach over request-scoped", source="chat")
  amfs_record_context("architecture-decision", "Using uvx for distribution — no source code needed", source="analysis")
  ```
- **When consulting external tools or APIs**: Record the context so decision traces are complete.
  ```
  amfs_record_context("pagerduty-incidents", "3 SEV-1 in last 24h", source="PagerDuty API")
  ```
- Record contexts **as they happen** during the session, not all at the end. This preserves the causal order.

## When to COMMIT OUTCOMES (capture the full trace)

- **After completing a significant task**: This snapshots all reads, writes, decisions, and contexts from the session into a persisted `DecisionTrace`. Always do this at the end of meaningful work.
  ```
  amfs_commit_outcome("tenant-rls-fix", "success")
