# AMFS Memory — Agent Instructions

You have access to AMFS (Agent Memory File System) through MCP tools. AMFS gives you a **persistent brain** — memory that survives across sessions, agents, and machines. Use it to build institutional knowledge over time.

## Available MCP Tools

### Identity
- `amfs_set_identity(name, description?, model?, client_name?, tools_available?)` — set your agent identity. Persisted to disk (sticky) — survives process restarts. Always pass `model=` with your LLM model name. Call first.
- `amfs_whoami()` — check which identity is active and where it came from (in-process, sticky file, or auto-detected)
- `amfs_reset_identity()` — clear the sticky identity and revert to auto-detection

### Brain tools (agent-scoped)
- `amfs_recall(entity_path, key)` — recall YOUR OWN memory for a key (what do I know about this?)
- `amfs_my_entries(entity_path?)` — list everything YOU have written (what's in my brain?)
- `amfs_read_from(agent_id, entity_path, key)` — read from ANOTHER agent's memory (learn from a colleague)

### Shared knowledge tools
- `amfs_read(entity_path, key)` — read the latest version by any agent (shared pool)
- `amfs_write(entity_path, key, value, confidence?, pattern_refs?, memory_type?)` — form a memory. `memory_type` can be `"fact"` (default), `"belief"` (decays faster), or `"experience"` (decays slower)
- `amfs_search(query?, entity_path?, min_confidence?, agent_id?, sort_by?, limit?)` — search across all entries
- `amfs_list(entity_path?)` — list entries for an entity
- `amfs_stats()` — memory overview

### Tracing and explainability
- `amfs_commit_outcome(outcome_ref, outcome_type)` — **critical**: snapshots the full decision trace (all reads, writes, decisions, contexts) and persists it. Call this after completing significant work.
- `amfs_record_context(label, summary, source?)` — capture decisions, external tool results, or user choices in the causal chain. Call this **as decisions happen**, not at the end.
- `amfs_history(entity_path, key, since?, until?)` — retrieve version history of an entry
- `amfs_explain(outcome_ref?)` — inspect the current session's decision trace: reads + external contexts
- `amfs_list_traces(entity_path?, agent_id?, limit?)` — browse persisted decision traces from past sessions
- `amfs_get_trace(trace_id)` — retrieve a full decision trace by ID
- `amfs_cross_agent_reads()` — see which other agents' memory you've read

## Workflow

### MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Set your identity

> **You MUST call `amfs_set_identity` before doing anything else.** Without it, all your work is attributed to a generic default and you won't appear as a distinct agent on the AMFS dashboard.

```
amfs_set_identity("<role-name>", "<one-line description of current task>", model="<your-model-name>")
```

Always pass `model=` with your LLM model name (e.g. `"claude-4-opus"`, `"gpt-4o"`, `"claude-3.5-sonnet"`). This is recorded in decision traces so we know which model made each decision.

**Sticky identity**: Once set, the identity is saved to `~/.amfs/.identity` and automatically restored in future sessions — even across process restarts (e.g. Claude Desktop). You only need to call `amfs_set_identity` again to change roles or update the description.

Use `amfs_whoami()` to check the active identity. Use `amfs_reset_identity()` to clear it.

**Naming rules:**
- Use **kebab-case role/domain names** that persist across conversations about the same topic.
- Good: `"dashboard-agent"`, `"stripe-agent"`, `"api-agent"`, `"infra-agent"`, `"mcp-agent"`
- Bad: `"fix-button-color"` (too specific — won't be reused), `"agent-1"` (meaningless)
- If continuing work a previous agent started, **use the same name** to build on their knowledge.
- The description should say what you're doing *right now* (e.g. `"Fixing tag rollback for slashed names"`).

### Before starting work
Get a compiled briefing from the Memory Cortex first — this gives you pre-compiled knowledge about the entity you're about to work on, including what other agents know, recent risks, external events, and confidence-ranked facts:
```
amfs_briefing(entity_path="<repo>/<module>")
```
Then check your own specific memories:
```
amfs_recall("<repo>/<module>", "task-summary-<area>")
amfs_search(entity_path="<repo>/<service-or-module>")
```

### After completing a task
Form a memory of what was done and key decisions:
```
amfs_write("<repo>/<module>", "task-summary-<desc>", "<what and why>")
```

### When consulting another agent's work
Explicitly read from their brain so the knowledge transfer is tracked:
```
amfs_read_from("<agent_id>", "<repo>/<module>", "<key>")
```

### When discovering patterns
Record reusable patterns with cross-references:
```
amfs_write("<repo>/<module>", "pattern-<name>", "<description>", pattern_refs=["related-key"])
```

### When finding bugs or risks
Warn other agents (use `memory_type="belief"` for hypotheses that need validation):
```
amfs_write("<repo>/<module>", "risk-<name>", "<what could go wrong>", confidence=0.8, memory_type="belief")
```
