## Project Name

Project-Idea-Scorer

## Project Goal

Build a single-page application that helps users score project ideas before building them.

The app should be beginner-friendly, clean, responsive, and deployable on Vercel.

## Tech Stack

* Next.js
* React
* Tailwind CSS
* Vercel deployment
* No API
* No database
* Local state only

## Important Rules

* Do not create backend API routes.
* Do not add database integration.
* Do not add authentication.
* Do not use external paid services.
* Keep all data in React local state.
* Keep the project simple and beginner-friendly.
* Use reusable components.
* Use clean Tailwind CSS styling.
* Make the page mobile responsive.
* Keep code easy for a new learner to understand.

## App Description

The user enters a project idea and manually scores it using 5 criteria.

The app calculates the total score and shows a recommendation.

## Scoring Criteria

Use these 5 criteria:

1. Real User Problem
2. AI Value
3. Scope
4. Market Demand
5. Team Excitement

Each criterion should have a score from 1 to 10.

Maximum total score: 50

## Score Result Logic

Use this logic:

* 40–50: Excellent idea
* 30–39: Good MVP idea
* 20–29: Needs improvement
* Below 20: Not recommended yet

## Required Page Sections

### 1. Hero Section

Show:

* App title: AI Project Idea Scorer
* Subtitle: Score your project idea before you build it
* Short description
* Start button or scroll button

### 2. Idea Input Form

Fields:

* Project Idea

* Problem
* AI Usage
* Team Size
* Build Time

### 3. Scoring Section

Use sliders or number inputs for:

* Team Excitement

Each field should show the selected score.

### 4. Result Section

After clicking "Score My Idea", show:

* Project idea title

* MVP suggestion
* Risk warning
* Next step

### 5. Sample Ideas Section

Add sample idea buttons:

* AI resume checker for job seekers
* Hospital visitor appointment guide
* Yangon delivery assistant
* AI interview practice app
* Waste collection mapping system

When the user clicks a sample idea, auto-fill the form.

## UI Style

## Beginner-Friendly Coding Rules

* Use clear variable names.

* Avoid complex state management.
* Use `useState` only.
* Keep everything understandable.
