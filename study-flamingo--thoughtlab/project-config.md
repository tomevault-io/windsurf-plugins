## General Rules
1. Always ask the user before making potentially breaking changes.
2. To quickly retrieve context for user requests, refer to the project [docs](../../docs/).
   - **Comprehensive developer guide**: [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](../../DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
   - **Code structure and file locations**: [PROJECT_MAP.md](../../docs/PROJECT_MAP.md)
   - **Project quickstart**: [README.md](../../README.md)
   - **Setup instructions**: [SETUP.md](../../docs/SETUP.md)
   - **Testing guide**: [TESTING.md](../../docs/TESTING.md)
   - **Dependency management**: [DEPENDENCIES.md](../../docs/DEPENDENCIES.md)
3. Current documentation is a priority. When making changes that may impact end-user workflows, be sure to update any relevant documentation, including the [README.md](../../README.md), [PROJECT_MAP.md](../../docs/PROJECT_MAP.md), [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](../../DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md), and [SETUP.md](../../docs/SETUP.md) if appropriate.
4. Always reference the most current documentation possible for packages, depending on the version we are using. **Use the Context7 MCP server** proactively if available.

## Development Principles
When writing code, follow these principles:

### Modularity First
Design every feature with **modularity** in mind to facilitate easy expansion as the project grows, with minimal refactoring necessary. This means:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module/component does one thing well
- **Clear Interfaces**: Use Pydantic models (backend) and TypeScript types (frontend) as contracts
- **Separation of Concerns**: Routes handle HTTP, services handle business logic, connectors handle data access
- **Minimal Coupling**: Components communicate via props/callbacks, not global state
- **Easy Extension Points**: New node types, relationship types, and features should require isolated changes

See [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md: Development Principles](../../DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#development-principles) for more detailed guidelines and examples.

### Human-in-the-loop
The user wants to collaborate with you for design/architecture decisions throughout this project. For decisions that may have a large impact throughout development or may require large refactors to change later, **ask the user for input**.

### Quality Standards
- Write tests for new features (pytest for backend, vitest for frontend)
- Use type hints in Python and TypeScript throughout
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document non-obvious decisions in code comments
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Avoid Over-Engineering
- Don't add features beyond what was requested
- Don't refactor unrelated code during bug fixes
- Don't add error handling for impossible scenarios
- Don't create abstractions for single-use code
- Three similar lines > premature abstraction

### Keep Documentation Current
Whenever functionality is added/removed/changed, update the following files where necessary:

1. [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md)
2. [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](../../DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
3. [PROJECT_MAP.md](../../docs/PROJECT_MAP.md)
4. [SETUP.md](../../docs/SETUP.md)
5. [TESTING.md](../../docs/TESTING.md)
6. [README.md](../../README.md)
