# ProductOS

ProductOS is a complete operating system for taking a product from idea to revenue with AI agents. It lives in the `productos/` folder of the app repository it serves — the surrounding repo **is** the product codebase, and ProductOS is set up in it before anything else, even the first line of code. It works in four phases, each with its own folder, checklist, templates, and skills:

1. **Define** (`productos/define/`) — nail the offer, customer, and pricing, then ship the **mini-launch** (a small post or DM batch that gets the first real reply from a potential customer). Produces `docs/PRODUCT.md` and starts `docs/LAUNCHES.md`.
2. **Design** (`productos/design/`) — identity (the brand in words), then the UX writing guide (`docs/COPY.md` — how the product speaks), then the design system derived from an image reference (`docs/DESIGN.md` + its live `docs/DESIGN.html` style guide), magic moment, onboarding, acquisition surface, then relaunch #2 ("here's what it looks like").
3. **Develop** (`productos/develop/`) — PRD, roadmap, the agent-driven build with code-review and security gates, then relaunch #3 (the beta invite). Produces `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/SECURITY-AUDIT.md`, and `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
4. **Distribute** (`productos/distribute/`) — go-to-market, relaunch #4 (the public launch), growth experiments, scaling. A loop, not a one-pass sequence.

One thread runs through all four phases: each closes with a launch, run by the cross-phase `mini-launch` skill, climbing the signal ladder (`reply → conversation → signup → activated user → payment`) and logged in `docs/LAUNCHES.md` alongside the believers list.

## Where to start

Run `setup` — the installer. It verifies ProductOS is properly installed (sitting as `productos/` inside a git repo, root `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` wired from `productos/setup/`, `productos/` gitignored), fixes what's missing, and — if the copy shipped with a programme plan at `productos/PLAN.md` — moves it to `docs/PLAN.md` and verifies it against the actual repo. Custom plans are composed by the user's coach from their onboarding call; plan revisions come from the coach too.

If ProductOS is checked out standalone (no surrounding app repo), run `setup` anyway — it walks the user through creating the app repo and moving ProductOS into it as `productos/`.

No plan in the copy? The linear path is the standard programme: open `productos/define/DEFINE-CHECKLIST.md` and work top to bottom, finishing each phase before the next. Each phase checklist names the exact skill to run at each step, the file it produces, and the reference docs it draws on.

## How this folder is organized

- `productos/define/`, `productos/design/`, `productos/develop/`, `productos/distribute/` — one folder per phase: a `*-CHECKLIST.md` runbook, numbered templates (`1-`–`4-`) that skills fill in place, and `BONUS-*.md` reference playbooks.
- `productos/skills/<skill-name>/` — the Claude skills the checklists invoke, one flat folder per skill containing a `SKILL.md` (plus any bundled reference files). Names use the `<phase>-*` convention (e.g. `define-offer-builder`); the three tool-specific build loops (`cc-build-loop`, `codex-build-loop`, `cursor-build-loop`) carry their tool's name instead so they work outside ProductOS, and the five cross-phase skills are `setup` (the installer — it opens every programme), `update` (the updater — it moves an installed copy to the latest release without touching the member's filled templates), `mini-launch` (the launch ritual — it closes every phase), and the two challenges `ship-in-7` (seven sessions to a live app) and `sell-in-30` (thirty sessions to a first customer) — orchestrators that compose a session-by-session plan from the phase skills and log it in `docs/SHIP-IN-7.md` / `docs/SELL-IN-30.md`; no phase prefix on any of the five.
- `productos/setup/` — the coding-agent guidelines (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`) that get wired into the app repo root at setup: copied whole if no root file exists, or appended as a marked `<!-- BEGIN PRODUCTOS -->…<!-- END PRODUCTOS -->` block if one does — never overwrite a repo's existing root files.
- `docs/` — the output directory at the **app repo root** (not inside `productos/`). ProductOS skills write the canonical product documents there (`PLAN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `COPY.md`, `DESIGN.md` + `DESIGN.html`, `PRD.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `SECURITY-AUDIT.md`, `DEPLOY.md`, `LAUNCHES.md`, and the challenge logs `SHIP-IN-7.md` / `SELL-IN-30.md`), alongside whatever documentation the repo already has. Don't hand-create the canonical files; other files in `docs/` are the app's own — leave them alone.

## Rules for agents working in this folder

- Templates are filled **in place** — rewrite the numbered template files, preserving their structure and the `> Good/Bad` guidance scaffolding. Never create parallel copies.
