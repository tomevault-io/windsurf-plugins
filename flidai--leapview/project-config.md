# LeapView Project Overview

LeapView is a dashboards-as-code BI monolith. Go owns configuration compilation, security, deployments, managed data, DuckDB/DuckLake execution, and the Datastar SSE command loop. Gomponents renders page shells; Lit components render typed signal payloads in the browser.

## Architecture

- `dashboards/` is the canonical analytics source root. The compiler discovers connections, sources, models, semantic models, pipelines, and dashboards from its six conventional subdirectories; authored Project, access, and publication resources are not part of the portable bundle.
- `internal/project/compiler/` loads, validates, and compiles the complete resource graph into deployable serving-state artifacts.
- `internal/deployment/`, `internal/servingstate/`, and `internal/runtimehost/` prepare immutable serving-state generations, activate the graph for the instance-bound environment, lease DuckLake snapshots, and drain readers safely during cutover.
- `internal/manageddata/` implements local and S3-backed ingestion, revisions, upload protocols, runtime views, retention, and binding resolution.
- `internal/analytics/model/` defines semantic models. `internal/analytics/query/` plans governed single- and multi-dataset queries. `internal/analytics/materialize/` and `internal/analytics/duckdb/` execute and cache them.
- `internal/access/` owns principals, authentication credentials, RBAC, grants, data policies, groups, SCIM, sessions, service principals, and access auditing.
- `internal/app/` is the composition root and top-level HTTP router. Feature handlers live beside their domains under packages such as `internal/dashboard/http`, `internal/project/http`, and `internal/agent/http`.
- `pkg/pagestream` is LeapView's product-owned, signal-only Datastar subset for Gomponents MPA shells, the canonical `/updates` SSE transport, and bounded in-process fan-out that disconnects slow subscribers. Product client identity and dashboard delivery policy remain outside the package.
- `api/signals/main.tsp` is the source of truth for browser signal contracts. Generation produces feature-owned Go models and TypeScript types in `web/generated/signals/index.ts`.
- `internal/dashboard/ui/`, `internal/admin/ui/`, and `internal/agent/ui/` render gomponents document shells. `web/components/` contains Lit route and visual components.
- ECharts is the built-in chart renderer. TanStack powers table state and virtualization behind LeapView-owned signal/query contracts.

## Runtime Flow

1. `GET /` opens Insights; `GET /explore` opens Data Explorer; Develop uses `/sources`, `/models`, `/semantic-models`, `/pipelines`, and `/connections`.
2. Dashboard routes are `GET /dashboards/{dashboard}` and `/dashboards/{dashboard}/pages/{page}`. The server-bound project is never selected in browser routes.
3. Each page opens the canonical `GET /updates?...` Datastar SSE stream from `data-init`.
4. Browser components emit small domain events. Gomponents attributes translate them into CSRF-protected Datastar commands.
5. Domain handlers authorize the request, update stream state, execute governed DuckDB queries where needed, and publish typed signal patches through the product-owned Pagestream package.
6. Lit components subscribe to signal paths and render without ad hoc data-fetch APIs.

## Important Files

- `cmd/leapview/main.go` and `internal/app/cli/serve.go`: process startup and lifecycle.
- `cmd/leapview-site/main.go` and `internal/app/site/http/`: independently deployable public site startup and HTTP adapter.
- `internal/app/router.go`: canonical page, command, auth, admin, and API routes.
- `internal/project/compiler/compiler.go`: project compilation entrypoint.
- `internal/runtimehost/manager.go`: serving-generation and snapshot-lease lifecycle.
- `internal/analytics/materialize/runtime.go`: query execution, coalescing, and cache integration.
- `internal/analytics/query/planner.go`: semantic query planning.
- `internal/dashboard/runtime/`: dashboard query orchestration and signal payload construction.
- `internal/dashboard/ui/page.go`: governed dashboard document shell.
- `web/components/dashboard/dashboard-page.ts`: interactive report surface.
- `web/components/dashboard/table/report-table.ts`: BI table component.
- `docs/`: authored and generated public documentation; `site/`: site-specific browser source and static assets.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: canonical parallel CI workflow.

## Development

- `task dev` builds, bootstraps, deploys, and starts the managed development server.
- `task ci` runs the fast pull-request contract locally; run it before a meaningful push while developing.
- `task ci:pr` runs that same PR contract locally, with bounded Go and frontend lanes.
- `task ci:full` runs static/race, desktop, route QA, and deployment validation in addition to the PR contract; the merge queue runs it against the exact candidate before merge.
- `task ci:nightly` adds dependency security scans to the full contract and runs automatically every day.
