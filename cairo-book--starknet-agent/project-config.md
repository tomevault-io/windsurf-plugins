# Coding Standards for Starknet Agent

## Naming Conventions
- Variables and functions: Use `camelCase` (e.g., `fetchData`, `generateEmbeddings`).
- Classes and components: Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `RagAgent`, `ChatInterface`).
- Constants: Use `UPPER_CASE` with underscores (e.g., `DEFAULT_CHAT_MODEL`).
- Type interfaces: Use `PascalCase` with `I` prefix (e.g., `IAgentConfig`).
- Ingester classes: Use `PascalCase` with `Ingester` suffix (e.g., `CairoBookIngester`).
- Pipeline components: Use descriptive names ending with their role (e.g., `QueryProcessor`, `DocumentRetriever`).

## Indentation and Formatting
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- Keep lines under 100 characters where possible.
- Place opening braces on the same line as the statement (e.g., `if (condition) {`).
- Use Prettier for consistent formatting across the codebase.
- Run `pnpm format:write` before committing changes.

## Imports and Structure
- Group external imports first, followed by internal modules.
- Use barrel exports (index.ts files) to simplify imports.
- Prefer destructured imports when importing multiple items from a single module.
- Order imports alphabetically within their groups.
- Use relative paths for imports within the same package, absolute paths for cross-package imports.

## Comments
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and classes, especially in the agent pipeline and ingester components.
- Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.
- Document ingester classes with clear descriptions of the source and processing approach.
- Include explanations for complex algorithms or non-obvious design decisions.
- For the RAG pipeline components, document the input/output expectations clearly.

## TypeScript Usage
- Use explicit typing for function parameters and return values.
- Prefer interfaces over types for object definitions.
- Use generics where appropriate, especially in the pipeline components and ingester classes.
- Example: `function processQuery<T extends BaseQuery>(query: T): Promise<QueryResult>`
- Use abstract classes for base implementations (e.g., `BaseIngester`).
- Leverage type guards for safe type narrowing.
- Use discriminated unions for state management, especially in the UI components.

## Error Handling
- Wrap async operations in `try/catch` blocks.
- Log errors with context using the logger utility (e.g., `logger.error('Failed to retrieve documents:', error)`).
- Use custom error classes for specific error types in the agent pipeline and ingestion process.
- Implement proper cleanup in error handlers, especially for file operations in ingesters.
- Ensure errors are propagated appropriately and handled at the right level of abstraction.
- Use async/await with proper error handling rather than promise chains where possible.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions, pipeline components, and ingester classes.
- Use Jest for testing framework.
- Mock external dependencies (LLMs, vector stores, etc.) using jest-mock-extended.
- Aim for high test coverage in core agent functionality and ingestion processes.
- Test each ingester implementation separately.
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested.
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for test structure.

## Code Organization
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility.
- Group related functionality in directories.
- Separate business logic from UI components.
- Organize ingesters by source type in dedicated directories.
- Follow the template method pattern for ingester implementations.
- Use the factory pattern for creating appropriate instances based on configuration.
- Implement dependency injection for easier testing and component replacement.
