# Arcanum Copilot Instructions

This repository is the canonical Arcanum framework and registry for reusable agent capabilities.

For Arcanum requests, prefer the `arcanum-orchestrate` skill. It routes through the canonical registries instead of copying sigil internals into the command wrapper.

Core references:

- `registry/SIGILS.md` for sigil lookup.
- `registry/SPELLS.md` for spell lookup.
- `framework/` for authoring, validation, observability, and lifecycle rules.
- `arcana/`, `transmutations/`, and `formulae/` for canonical sigil files.

Keep installed runtime adapters thin. Canonical behavior lives in the sigil and spell files.
