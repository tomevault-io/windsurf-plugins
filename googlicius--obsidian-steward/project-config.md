- Adopt the return early approach.
- If a function has more than 4 arguments, make it a single argument as an object.
- Use 'for' loops instead of 'forEach' for iterating arrays.
- Use dot notation instead of destructuring for accessing object's fields.
- If you generate hard-coded text or strings, you MUST define all languages for them in the `src/i18n/locales` folder, (Except those are system prompts, logging, or errors) and use them via the `t` method.
- Avoid casting variables as any
- When defining properties for a class, define them directly in the constructor's parameters if feasible, for example: `constructor(private plugin: Plugin)`.
- Always put a `vault.on('create')` in the onLayoutReady callback, otherwise it triggers when opening the app: `src/services/SkillService/SkillService.ts:51-61`
- Always write readable, maintainable, and reusable code.
- When finishing generation, no need to run build or test. Leave it for me to review.
