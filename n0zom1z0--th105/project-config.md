# TH105 reconstruction agent rules

This repository reconstructs one exact binary: the original Japanese TH10.5
version 1.06a executable whose SHA-256 is recorded in `config/target.toml`.
Do not analyze or substitute a localized executable.

## Before changing code

1. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/RE_WORKFLOW.md`, and the relevant module
   notes.
2. Run `python3 scripts/verify-target.py`.
3. Inspect `config/functions.csv` and `config/claims.csv`. Do not duplicate an
   active claim; use a small address-bounded work unit.
   For whole-program classification, also inspect
   `config/function-origins.csv` and `docs/EXECUTABLE_INVENTORY.md`; never
   assume every non-`library` row is authored game code.
4. Prefer the registered IDA Pro MCP when `python3 scripts/check-ida-mcp.py`
   passes the exact target and capability checks. Otherwise confirm
   `th105-ghidra` and run the fallback protocol smoke test in `docs/MCP.md`.
5. For danmaku, skill, battle, collision, score, or spell-card work, inspect
   `docs/CORE_FRAMEWORK.md` and run `python3 scripts/core-worklist.py --ready`.
   The framework selects work; it does not override the function ledger.

## Evidence rules

- Keep facts, inferences, and hypotheses distinct. A plausible decompiler name
  is not a fact.
- Prefer exact target instructions, cross-references, RTTI, vtables, live
  observations, and comparison reports. External projects are supporting
  evidence only.
- Record meaningful names in `config/known-symbols.csv` or directly in the
  function ledger with an evidence pointer. Save corresponding Ghidra changes.
- Never mark a function `matching` from visual similarity. It requires a 100%
  reccmp/object comparison and a reproducible report path or command in the
  `evidence` column.

## Function status model

`config/functions.csv` is the source of truth:

- `unclassified`: inventory only
- `identified`: role/name supported by evidence
- `decompiled`: control flow and types documented, no source implementation
- `implemented`: source exists but does not yet compile in the target build
- `compiles`: included in the target build, not byte-identical
- `matching`: byte-identical under the accepted comparison
- `library`: verified compiler/runtime/third-party code excluded from authored progress
- `blocked`: a concrete blocker is documented

Do not skip directly to `matching`. Update `source_file`, `owner`,
`match_percent`, and `evidence` together with status changes.

## Exact matching

For nontrivial byte-matching work, read
`.agents/skills/th105-matching/SKILL.md` together with the normal `th105-re`
skill. The matching skill collects reusable VC8, COFF relocation, STL, EH,
register-shaping, and LTCG stop-condition patterns. This file and `th105-re`
remain authoritative for status transitions, claims, evidence, and handoff.

## Analysis backend usage

IDA Pro MCP is the preferred semantic-analysis backend when its preflight
passes. Re-run `scripts/check-ida-mcp.py` at the start of each bounded work
unit because IDA MCP is attached to the file currently open in the GUI and has
no `program=` selector. Use IDA for decompilation, disassembly, xrefs, call
graphs, RTTI, structures, and type recovery. Treat IDA function chunks and
sizes as non-authoritative: reconcile every address with the function ledger.
The known `0x0046A5B0` wrapper/`0x00463610` body pair is the boundary regression
case. Never use `patch_address_assembles` or otherwise patch target bytes.

If IDA is unavailable, missing a required capability, or routed to the wrong
target, use the Ghidra fallback below. See `docs/IDA_MCP.md` for the selection,
safety, and Ghidra-analysis import workflow.

Codex loads the registered `th105-ghidra` server from its user configuration.
Use MCP native tools for decompilation, xrefs, functions, types, comments, and
renames. Always provide `program="th105.exe"`; strict program routing is on.
If an already-running agent session cannot hot-load that registration, use
`.tools/src/ghidra-mcp/.venv/bin/python scripts/mcp-call.py`; it still uses MCP
initialize/list/call over stdio.
The server binds only to loopback. Arbitrary Ghidra script execution remains
disabled in the MCP server; use reviewed scripts under `scripts/ghidra/` via
headless Ghidra when batch behavior is needed.

Only the coordinator writes either analysis database during parallel work.
After changing Ghidra, call `save_program`; after changing IDA, read back the
applied names/types/comments. Export the relevant inventory or manifest and
commit the source-side evidence in the same change. Neither database is the
only durable copy of a discovery.

## Parallel work

For two or more concurrent reconstruction lanes, read
`.agents/skills/th105-parallel/SKILL.md` together with the normal `th105-re`
skill. The coordinator owns Ghidra writes, claims, ledgers, inventory exports,
and Git; evidence workers receive non-overlapping address ranges.

## Implementation and verification

- Preserve the expected VC8-era ABI: x86 data sizes, calling conventions,
  class layout, vtable order, exception behavior, and static initialization.
- Keep functions in the module directories described by
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Do not create a monolithic catch-all translation unit.
