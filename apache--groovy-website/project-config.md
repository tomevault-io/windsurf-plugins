# Agent Guide for the Apache Groovy website

Supplemental guidance for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
Copilot, Gemini, Aider, and similar tools) contributing to the Apache Groovy
website (`apache/groovy-website`).

This file **supplements** — it does not replace —
[`README.adoc`](README.adoc), which remains the authoritative source for
how the site is structured, generated, and published. Topic-specific
editorial guides — currently
[`RELEASE_NOTES_GUIDE.adoc`](RELEASE_NOTES_GUIDE.adoc) — are the source
of truth for *what good content looks like* in their area. This file
just layers AI-specific guidance on top.

## Branch warning (read first)

The `asf-site` branch is the **live** branch. Per `README.adoc`:

> The website is continuously updated from the `asf-site` branch.
> This means that *every merge on that branch is immediately published*.

Implications for AI-assisted contributions:

- Treat the working tree as production. Don't push speculative changes.
- Date-sensitive content (release announcements, blog posts pegged to a
  date) belongs on a dedicated branch and is merged into `asf-site` on
  the day it should appear.
- Generated artefacts (`build/`, `*.cache` files under `site/src/site/blog/`)
  are not committed.

## Licensing and provenance

Apache Groovy and its website are licensed under Apache License 2.0.
Contributions must meet the ASF's
[Generative Tooling guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html).
In particular:

- **Do not copy verbatim from incompatibly-licensed sources** (GPL / AGPL /
  LGPL, proprietary, unattributed Stack Overflow / blog snippets). Reimplement
  from specifications, standards, or Apache-compatible sources (see the
  [ASF 3rd Party Licensing Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html)).
- **Every new source file needs the ASF license header.** Copy the form from
  any existing `.adoc`, `.groovy`, or `.gradle` file in the repository.
- **Attribute AI assistance in commits.** When AI tooling assisted on
  a change, consider adding an `Assisted-by:` trailer naming the tool(s):

  ```
  Assisted-by: <tool name and version>
  ```

  `Assisted-by:` is the default and reflects the ASF's stance that a
  human contributor performs the final check on every change.
  `Co-authored-by:` is conventionally used for human co-authors.
  `Generated-by:` is reserved for cases where AI tooling produced a change
  with minimal human modification. The ASF's
  [Generative Tooling guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html)
  is authoritative.
- **The contributor remains responsible for what they submit.** Review
  generated output for licensing, correctness, and style before committing.

## Build and preview

Canonical instructions live in [`README.adoc`](README.adoc). The short form:

```
./gradlew :site-user:webzip          # build the user site
./gradlew :site-dev:webzip           # build the developer site
```

Outputs land under `site-user/build/site/` and `site-dev/build/site/`.
A "deadlinks" report is produced under `site-user/build/reports/`; check it
before declaring a content change ready.

Use the Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew` / `gradlew.bat`); do not invoke a
system `gradle`.

## Content conventions

Follow what's already in the tree. Specifically:

- AsciiDoc (`.adoc`) is the source format for pages, blog posts, and
  release notes. Match the surrounding file's heading levels, attribute
  block, and macro usage.
- Issue references use the `link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-NNNN[GROOVY-NNNN]`
  form. Don't invent issue numbers; verify each one resolves on JIRA.
- Cross-references to Groovy API docs use the `gapi:` macro (see
  `generator/src/main/groovy/generator/LinkMacroProcessor.groovy`); do not
  hard-code `groovy-lang.org/gapi/` URLs by hand.
- Templating uses the
  [Markup Template Engine](https://groovy-lang.org/templating.html#_the_markuptemplateengine)
  (Groovy DSL), not Mustache / Handlebars / Jinja. Don't rewrite an
  existing template into a different engine.
- Match the surrounding file's style. The site uses 4-space indent for
  Groovy / Gradle, 2-space for AsciiDoc lists.

## Commits and PRs

- Reference the JIRA issue in commit messages where applicable, e.g.
  `GROOVY-12345: short description`. Project issues are tracked at
  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY>.
- Keep commits focused. A content update, a generator change, and a
  formatting pass are three separate commits, not one.
