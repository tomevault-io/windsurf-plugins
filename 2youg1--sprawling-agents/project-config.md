# AGENTS.md — how work is done in this repository

**For any agent or person about to change this code.** Read this file to the end before the first edit; it is short on purpose, and everything it does not cover is one link away.

sprawling is a locally deployed agent-city harness: one Rust binary, a WebAssembly client embedded inside it, and a city that keeps its whole history in one append-only Ledger. Most of it was written by models, and every rule below exists for one reason that applies to a person just as much: **a contributor who does not remember yesterday still has to produce work that holds.**

## The loop

```bash
cargo install just cargo-nextest --locked   # once; the toolchain installs itself from rust-toolchain.toml
just check                                  # fmt + clippy (-D warnings, --all-features) + nextest + every machine gate
```

**A change is finished when `just check` is green.** "I finished it" is a claim; a green run is the evidence.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `just check` | the closing condition for every change |
| `just gates` | the machine gates alone |
| `just check-web` | clippy on the wasm target — the two places `just check` cannot reach |
| `just build-web` | build the client bundle, without `dx` |
| `just dist` | the whole deliverable: client, binary, bill of materials, size badges |
| `just sim [seed]` | citysim scenarios; a failure reproduces from its seed |
| `just spec <crate>` | generate a SPEC skeleton |
| `just api-baseline` | recompute the public-surface baselines |
| `just replay <log>` | verify a ledger chain offline, read-only |
| `just mem [pid]` / `just bench` / `just budget` | the measurements, in this platform's own vocabulary |
| `just fuzz <target>` / `just mutants` | fuzz targets / mutation testing |

## Read before you write

1. [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) — what the code is made of, how the twelve crates are wired, what one dispatch does end to end. Its `depmap` block and module map are machine authorities.
2. The SPEC of the crate you are touching, `crates/<crate>/<crate>-SPEC.md` — the interfaces and decisions, written before the code.
3. [`docs/glossary.md`](docs/glossary.md) — one name per concept, enforced by a gate.
4. The tests next to the code you are about to change.

**Read the official documentation of a tool before you use it** — a language feature, a crate, a CLI, a framework. Load the vendor's own agent guide or skill when one exists. Two are hard requirements because both moved recently: the front end is **Dioxus** built without `dx` (<https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.7/>), and the wasm build needs a `wasm-bindgen` CLI whose version equals the crate version.

## One change, five steps

1. **Take one piece of work.** One session, one bounded change, read its context in full before starting.
2. **Write the SPEC first.** Interfaces and decisions land in the crate's SPEC before the code exists. A new module states which of the seven shapes it instantiates ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §9); when there is no answer, stop and ask rather than write.
3. **Red.** Write the failing test and **run it once to watch it fail**. That run is what proves the test can bite.
4. **Green.** Implement until it passes, no more. When the implementation wants to differ from the SPEC, change the SPEC first.
5. **Close.** All four: `just check` green | the red-to-green transition visible in the commit order | SPEC and code in step | the module map updated.

When a session ends with the work unfinished, write what is left — where you got to, what blocked you, what comes next — into the SPEC section it belongs to, not into your own memory.

## The rules a machine holds

Violating any of these turns CI red with a message naming the rule, the violation, and an alternative.

| Write it this way | Held by |
|---|---|
| Return failure through `Result`. No `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `todo!`, `unreachable!`, bare indexing or slicing in non-test code. Checked arithmetic; `TryFrom` for narrowing; no `as` casts; no `unsafe`. | workspace lints, `-D warnings` |
| One module, one file, semantically named. Register the file in the module map, then create it. Keep `lib.rs` and index files free of logic. | `xtask modmap` |
| Default to `pub(crate)`. Declare a `pub` trait only in a file on the seam list. | `xtask depmap` |
| Start every `.rs` file with the MPL-2.0 notice, then the copyright line. | `xtask header` |
| Take the time as a parameter. The single sampling point is `bin::assembly`. | `clippy.toml` disallowed methods |
| Use `BTreeMap` on kernel decision paths; keep floats out of ledger payloads; start tasks from the one spawn point. | review, plus the citysim determinism scenarios |
| One name per concept, taken from the glossary. | `xtask lexicon` with `xtask/lexicon.toml` |
| Change a crate's public surface and its SPEC in the same commit. Adding one `pub use` is a public-surface change. | `xtask apisync` |
| Keep credentials as `secret:realm/name` references; let plaintext reach the vault only. | `xtask secret` |
| Take colour from `web::theme`; express a colour as a ratio of the gamut limit. | `xtask color` |
