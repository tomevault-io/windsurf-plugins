# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

**National Design System for Saudi Arabia** — Jekyll static site documenting a government design system.
RTL (Arabic) by default, with LTR (English) support. Font: IBM Plex Sans Arabic. Icons: HGI Stroke Rounded.

## Commands

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve      # Dev server (port 4002, auto-displays network IP)
ruby _plugins/js_processor.rb # REQUIRED after any _js/ changes (bundles & minifies → assets/js/*.min.js)
```

## Files to Ignore

- **NEVER read** any `.min.js` or `.min.css` files (minified output)

## Tool Restrictions

- **NEVER use `sed`** for file edits — it rewrites every file it opens even with no match, polluting git diffs.
- **For mass/bulk edits** — write a targeted script (Python, Ruby, etc.) that reads each file, checks for a match, and only writes back files that actually changed.

## Using Components (CRITICAL)

**NEVER guess a component's markup structure.** Before placing any NDS component on a page, open its doc page at `components/[name].md` and copy the canonical markup from the `<code class="lang-html code">` block (or the live demo above it). Class names, element nesting, required modifier classes, `data-*` attributes, and ARIA roles must match the doc exactly. Also check `examples/*.md` for real-world usage patterns. If the doc is missing or unclear, read the component's SCSS in `_sass/components/_[name].scss` — do not invent structure from memory.

## RTL/LTR Support (CRITICAL)

**RTL is the default.** There is NO `@include rtl` mixin. Write base styles for RTL.
**Prefer CSS Logical Properties** (`margin-inline-start`, `padding-inline`, `inset-inline-start`, `text-align: start`) — they auto-adapt to text direction.
**Use `@include ltr` ONLY** for transforms, gradients, or properties logical props don't cover.

## SCSS Standards

**Every component file must start with** `@use '../mixins' as *;`

**Use `nds-` prefix** for all class names.

**Responsive/accessibility mixins** — see `_sass/_mixins.scss`.

## Design Tokens (CRITICAL)

**Four tiers** (+ knobs):
1. **Palette** `--colors-*` (`themes/_dga.scss` — vendored, DO NOT MODIFY; runtime theme ramps): raw values, zero meaning.
2. **Primitives** (`tokens/_primitives.scss`): dimension vocabulary — direct values on the size names (`--spacing-md`, `--radius-sm`, typo ladders). No numeric rungs.
3. **Semantic** (`tokens/_semantic.scss`): ONE name per meaning, system-wide (e.g. `--background-overlay`, `--text-oncolor-primary`). Dark rebinds in `_variables-dark.scss`.
4. **Component** (`tokens/_components.scss`, dark in `tokens/_components-dark.scss`): `--{component}-{property}-{variant}-{state}` — a per-component dial.

**Knobs** (`--btn-size`, `--section-*`, `--hero-*`) are NOT tokens: per-instance styling the consumer sets on the element, undefined by default, resolved via the `--_x: var(--x, default)` private pattern. Tokens theme the system; knobs style one element.

**Authoring test — when a component needs a value, stop at the first hit:**
1. A semantic token with the same MEANING exists (and behaves right in dark) → consume it.
2. The component needs its own dial — design retunes just this component, or the DGA sheet defines it → mint the component token (STRICT bar: dial-or-DGA-mandate only) and route its VALUE by meaning (below).
3. No meaning match, no dial needed → palette-direct `--colors-*`, whole family as a unit. Raw hex: never.

**Naming grammar:**
- Semantic: `--{property}-{role}-{modifier}-{state}`; property ∈ `background/text/border/icon/shadow/focus/controls`; modifiers are words with ONE fixed meaning (`light` = tinted wash, `strong` = deep emphasis, `oncolor` = on colored fill — always spelled `oncolor`, never `on-color`, placed last before state).
- States: `default/hovered/pressed/selected/focused/disabled` (token `pressed` feeds the `-active` knob — established precedent).
- NO color names, NO shade numbers in semantic names; one name per meaning (no synonyms); no rename-only layers.
- Element widths are meaning-named knobs/tokens (`--nds-sidemenu-width`), never scale rungs; breakpoints stay literals (CSS forbids `var()` in `@media`).
- One-off alphas: `color-mix(in srgb, var(--token) N%, transparent)` at point of use — alpha ramp families never grow.

**Family rules:** families ship complete or not at all — all four status hues, FS/LH pairs, the states the component implements. A member is justified by its family; a whole family with no consumers and no design mandate gets removed. Every public token appears in a doc reference table; token removals/renames land in the release Migration section.

**Routing a component token's VALUE — go by meaning:**
1. A semantic token with matching **meaning** AND correct both-mode behavior exists → alias it (dark/HC/re-tints come free).
2. Value must flip in dark but no semantic meaning-match → palette-direct + own dark re-bind; promote the mapping to semantic once ≥2 components share it.
3. Mode-invariant by design → palette-direct with no dark line (comment it if non-obvious).
- **Never route through a value-coincidence** (e.g. a border token feeding a background) — same hex today ≠ same meaning tomorrow.
