# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

ecewo is a single-threaded, asynchronous C web framework with an Express.js-style API. It is built on libuv (event loop), llhttp (HTTP/1.1 parsing), and rax (radix-tree router), with a custom arena allocator. The entire public API is one header (`include/ecewo.h`); every public symbol is `ecewo_*`-prefixed and types are opaque for ABI/FFI safety.

## Commands

The `makefile` wraps the CMake/CTest workflow. `make help` lists everything.

- `make test` — configure `build/` with `-DECEWO_BUILD_TESTS=ON`, build, run the full CTest suite.
- `make asan-ubsan` / `make msan` / `make tsan` — sanitizer builds (MSAN/TSAN require clang) into separate `build-*/` dirs.
- `make valgrind` — memcheck run.
- `make fuzz` — build libFuzzer targets (`build-fuzz/fuzz-router`, `fuzz-route-register`); requires clang.
- `make format` / `make format-file FILE=src/x.c` — clang-format.
- `make lint` / `make lint-fix` / `make lint-file FILE=src/x.c` — clang-tidy. **Requires `build/` to already exist** (it reads `build/compile_commands.json` via `-p build`), so run `make test` or `cmake -B build` first.

### Running a single test

Tests are CTest cases named by their bare name; each is also a standalone binary `ecewo-test-<name>`:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build -R body-streaming --output-on-failure   # by name (regex)
./build/ecewo-test-body-streaming                              # run the binary directly
```

### Adding a test

1. Create `tests/test-<name>.c` (use `tester.h` macros: `RUN_TEST`, `ASSERT_EQ`, `RETURN_OK`, etc., and `ecewo-mock.h`).
2. Register it in `CMakeLists.txt` with `ecewo_test(<name>)`.
3. Reconfigure: `cmake -B build -DECEWO_BUILD_TESTS=ON`.

Tests link `ecewo::mock` (the `ecewo-mock` plugin, pulled via `ecewo_add(mock@dev)`), which spins up a **real** server on `TEST_PORT` (8888). `MockParams`/`request()` cover most cases; tests that need precise TCP framing (split reads, chunked, oversized bodies) open raw sockets to `TEST_PORT` directly — see `tests/test-body-streaming-split.c`.

The library builds with `-Werror` (unused function/variable) and tests with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, so warnings break the build.

## Architecture

### Process runtime singleton

There is one process-wide runtime (`ecewo__runtime_t`, static in `src/server.c`) that owns the shared libuv loop, signal handlers, the pooled-arena subsystem, and the registry of apps. It is lazily initialized on the first `ecewo_create()` and torn down via `atexit`. Multiple `ecewo_app_t` instances share this one loop, each bound to its own port (`ecewo_bind`/`ecewo_run`, or the combined `ecewo_listen`). Per-app shutdown is independent: one app can stop while others keep serving.

### Request lifecycle — the central, non-obvious flow

`server_on_read` (server.c) → `router()` (router.c) → `dispatch()` (router.c). The parser and request state are **connection-scoped**: `http_context_t persistent_context` is embedded in `ecewo_client_s` and its buffers live in the connection arena, so request state survives across multiple TCP reads.

The key trick: `on_headers_complete_cb` (http.c) returns `HPE_PAUSED`. This pauses llhttp at headers-complete so the router can match the route and decide buffered-vs-streaming **before the body is parsed**, then `llhttp_resume()`s. Consequences:

- **Buffered (default):** the handler is *deferred* — the matched handler/middleware/req/res are saved into `client->pending_*` with `handler_pending = true`, and run once the full body has buffered. `run_pending_handler()` is the single place that attaches the completed body and runs the saved chain (called from both the same-read path and the split-read path).
- **Streaming (opt-in):** the `ecewo_body_stream` middleware sets `http_context_t.on_body_chunk` so `on_body_cb` forwards chunks to the user's `on_data`/`on_end` callbacks instead of buffering. Saved as `client->stream_req` when the body spans multiple reads; completed via `body_stream_complete()`.

`router()` returns `REQUEST_KEEP_ALIVE` / `REQUEST_CLOSE` / `REQUEST_PENDING` (PENDING = handler hasn't replied yet, e.g. awaiting more body or async work). `client->request_in_progress` gates whether a new read resets the context (`client_context_reset`).

Gotcha that has bitten before: the buffered-path 413 guard in `dispatch()` must test `has_stream_middleware`, **not** `ctx->on_body_chunk` — `on_body_chunk` is only set when the stream middleware runs inside `chain_start`, which is *after* the guard, so keying off it wrongly rejects large/chunked streaming bodies. Buffered cap is `BUFFERED_BODY_MAX_SIZE` (1 MB, http.h); streaming default cap is `BODY_MAX_SIZE` (10 MB, body.c), tunable per-request via `ecewo_body_limit`.

### Memory: arenas, not malloc/free
