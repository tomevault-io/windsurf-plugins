# ExplorerTune

PowerShell toolkit that tunes the in-box Windows File Explorer. Writes to HKLM,
HKCR and the Windows Search crawl scope on a live machine.

This file is for coding agents. Humans want [README.md](README.md) and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Invariants

Break one of these and you break the product, not just the style.

- **Never write without `-Apply`.** Every mutating script is dry-run by default
  and prints a plan. Do not add a script that acts on bare invocation. CI fails
  the build if a bare run creates `backups/`.
- **Back up before you write.** `Backup-RegKey` for every registry root you are
  about to change, into a `New-BackupDir` folder, and print the
  `Restore-Explorer.ps1 -From ...` line at the end. A change with no export is a
  bug.
- **Block shell extensions, do not delete them.** Add the CLSID to
  `Shell Extensions\Blocked` in BOTH registry views. A deleted vendor key comes
  back with their next update; a Blocked value does not, and undo is one value.
  The only exception is a registration whose CLSID resolves to no COM server —
  those are dead and get deleted.
- **Static verbs, never new `shellex` handlers.** A `shell\<verb>\command` string
  costs nothing at runtime. A `shellex` handler is a DLL loaded into
  `explorer.exe` on every right-click. This project exists to remove those.
- **Count real successes.** Never print "wrote N" from the length of the input
  list. An early version reported "wrote 82 rules" while all 82 writes were
  denied by an ACL. Increment inside the `try`.
- **Verify against the system, not against your own write.** Confirm a blocked
  DLL via `explorer.exe`'s module list. Confirm search scope via
  `IncludedInCrawlScope`. Re-reading a registry value you just set proves
  nothing.
- **Nothing machine-specific in a commit.** No usernames, drive layouts, volume
  GUIDs or SIDs. Paths go in `explorertune.config.psd1` (gitignored) or the
  example config as `%USERPROFILE%`-style strings. CI scans for this.
- **Nothing is blocked by default.** `Handlers.Block` ships empty. Blocking is
  the user's decision, per catalog id.

## Search scope: read before touching

- **The crawl scope CANNOT be set from the registry.** `UserScopeRules` denies
  `CreateSubKey` to an elevated Administrator; `DefaultRules` gives
  `BUILTIN\Administrators` only `ReadKey`. `NT SERVICE\WSearch` owns both and
  regenerates `DefaultRules` on every service start. Use the COM path in
  `lib/SearchApi.ps1`. Deletions of non-default rules do stick, which is all
  `Clear-SearchRuleJunk.ps1` claims.
- **Never diagnose scope from the registry.** Measured: `DefaultRules` said
  `include=1` for two whole drives while `IncludedInCrawlScope` reported both
  entirely out of scope. Ask the API.
- **The bracketed GUID in a crawl rule is not the NTFS volume GUID.** Different
  identifier entirely for the same volume. A rule built from `mountvol` never
  matches and never errors. Do not construct these strings; pass plain paths to
  the API.
- **PowerShell cannot call these COM interfaces.** It dispatches through
  `IDispatch`, which they do not implement, so a `[ComImport]` cast arrives as a
  bare `System.__ComObject`. Every call lives inside the C# in
  `lib/SearchApi.ps1`.
- **The published IIDs are not always right.** `ISearchCatalogManager` answered
  to `...EF50` rather than the widely quoted `...EF61`/`...EF62` on build 26100.
  Hence runtime discovery by QueryInterface sweep. Do not hardcode them back.
- **Never call a hand-declared vtable without a two-sided oracle.**
  `ISearchCatalogManager::Reset()` is at slot 5 and `RevertToDefaultScopes()` at
  slot 13, so an off-by-one index is data loss, not a crash. Require a read-only
  method to return the RIGHT answer for a case that must be true AND one that
  must be false before enabling any mutating call. One-sided checks pass by
  accident; two-sided ones do not. `Validated = false` must keep every mutating
  method throwing.

## Non-obvious why

- **Windows Search has no recursive name exclusion.** A `*` matches exactly ONE
  path segment; the shipped defaults prove it (`file:///*\$RECYCLE.BIN\`). So
  each noise directory name needs one rule per depth, which is why the plan
  generates ~130 rules for 13 names. Do not "simplify" them.
- **`WorkingSetRules` is a derived cache**, normalised from `DefaultRules` plus
  the user scope on startup. Safe to wipe. `DefaultRules` is partly
  regenerated: the service restores one whole-drive rule per present fixed
  volume; anything else stays deleted.
- **`SetupCompletedSuccessfully=0` triggers a rebuild but the service sets the
  flag back to 1 itself.** Never read it back as confirmation. Use
  `GetCatalogStatus` / `NumberOfItems`.
- **Icon overlays are capped at 15 by sort order.** Count before cutting:
  removing dead entries can fix starvation without touching a working app.
- **Never match an overlay key name un-normalised.** Vendors pad names to jump
  the queue — some with leading spaces, at least one with **U+0001**.
  `String.Trim()` strips Unicode whitespace but NOT control characters, so
  `Trim()` plus `^MEGA` finds zero of six such keys. Strip `^[\s\p{C}]+`.
- **`h` is a built-in alias for `Get-History`, and aliases beat functions** in
