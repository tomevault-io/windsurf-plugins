# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
this repository. Read `docs/agents/rules.md` first — those constraints are
non-negotiable and apply to all agents.

## Verification Before Action

- ALWAYS run tests locally before pushing commits — never push to any remote until local tests are green
- ALWAYS verify against actual source code/repos before making assumptions about APIs, entity names, or naming patterns
- NEVER speculate about file contents or behavior - read the file or run the code first
- Before proposing any fix, show the exact code path and evidence (logs, source) that proves the root cause — do not guess at entity names, prefixes, or discovery logic

## Agent Documentation Index

| File | When to Read |
|------|-------------|
| [`docs/agents/rules.md`](docs/agents/rules.md) | **Always** — hard constraints |
| [`docs/agents/architecture.md`](docs/agents/architecture.md) | Before any structural change |
| [`docs/agents/patterns.md`](docs/agents/patterns.md) | Before writing new code |
| [`docs/agents/testing.md`](docs/agents/testing.md) | Before writing or changing tests |
| [`docs/agents/workflow.md`](docs/agents/workflow.md) | Before any commit, PR, or release |
| [`docs/agents/memory/`](docs/agents/memory/) | Project-specific memory (beta workflow, release train) |

## Project Overview

BESS Manager is a Home Assistant add-on for optimizing battery energy storage
systems. It provides price-based optimization, solar integration, and a web
interface for managing battery schedules and monitoring energy flows.

## Development Commands

### Backend (Python)

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
pytest -m "not slow"           # fast tests (~3s, recommended)
pytest -m slow                 # algorithm/integration tests (~30min)
pytest                         # run all tests
black . && ruff check --fix .  # format and lint
./scripts/quality-check.sh     # full quality gate
```

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # development server
npm run build        # production build
npm run lint:fix     # fix TypeScript issues
npm run generate-api # regenerate API client from OpenAPI spec
```

### Docker Development

```bash
docker-compose up -d                                          # backend + frontend (dev)
docker compose -f docker-compose.ci.yml up -d                 # E2E dev with mock-HA (fast, volume mounts)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod-test.yml up -d --build  # production image smoke test
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Build Add-on

```bash
./package-addon.sh
```

## Architecture in One Paragraph

FastAPI backend (`backend/app.py`) runs an hourly scheduler. The core
optimization engine (`core/bess/`) uses dynamic programming to generate a
24-hour battery schedule from electricity spot prices and real-time sensor
data. The schedule is sent to a Growatt inverter via the Home Assistant API.
A React SPA (`frontend/`) provides the management interface.

## Automated Agent Workflow

GitHub issues flow through a four-stage pipeline. Each stage is a separate
workflow file with a self-contained prompt — there is no cross-stage routing
through CLAUDE.md. All stages run on `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`.

| Stage | Trigger | Workflow | Cost | What it does |
|-------|---------|----------|------|--------------|
| 1. Triage | `issues: opened/edited` (auto) | `issue-triage.yml` | ~$0.05 | Classify + label only. Gates on debug log presence. |
| 2. Analyze | `@claude-bot analyze` (manual) | `issue-analyze.yml` | ~$0.50–2 | Delegates to `bess-analyst` sub-agent, posts root-cause diagnosis. No code changes. |
| 3. Fix | `@claude-bot fix` (manual) | `issue-fix.yml` | ~$1–4 | Implements minimal fix per Stage 2 plan, runs `quality-check.sh`, opens draft PR. |
| 4. Review | `@claude-bot` on a PR (manual) | `pr-review.yml` | ~$0.50–2 | Reviews diff against rules and checklist. |

**Why gated, not auto:** Stages 2 and 3 cost real money. The user explicitly
triggers each one after reading the previous stage's output.

**Label flow:**

```
opened ──► bug + needs-debug-log     (Stage 1: no log)
            │
            └─ user adds log ──► bug + ready-for-analysis  (Stage 1 re-runs on edit)
                                  │
                  @claude-bot analyze
                                  ▼
                                  analyzed                 (Stage 2)
                                  │
                  @claude-bot fix
                                  ▼
                                  has-fix-pr               (Stage 3, draft PR open)
```

If Stage 2 can't reach a conclusion it applies `needs-human-review` instead
of `analyzed`.

### General bot rules

- Only the repo owner can trigger bot commands.
- Always use `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, labels).
- Never push directly to `main`. PRs are always opened as drafts.
- The bot identity is `bess-manager-claude-bot` (a custom GitHub App). The
  official Anthropic Claude App is **suspended** to avoid collisions —
  do not unsuspend it.
- Stage 2 must invoke the `bess-analyst` sub-agent. Skipping that step is
  the failure mode the previous design suffered from.
