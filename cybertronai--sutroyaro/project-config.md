# GEMINI.md - Sutro Group Research Workspace

## Project Context

This is a research workspace for the **Sutro Group**, a study group exploring energy-efficient AI training. The group meets weekly at South Park Commons in San Francisco.

## Read These First

- **LAB.md** — Protocol for running experiments (templates, lifecycle, rules)
- **AGENT.md** — Machine-executable experiment loop for autonomous sessions
- **DISCOVERIES.md** — What's proven so far (read before every experiment)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — How external contributors submit experiments and findings
- **TODO.md** — Open research tasks
- **docs/tasks/INDEX.md** — Current task tracker with priorities
- **docs/research/survey.md** — Practitioner's Field Guide ranking all 36 experiments
- **docs/research/peer-research-protocol.md** — Full design doc for multi-researcher autonomous research

## Core Concepts

- **Sparse Parity**: The benchmark task — learn XOR/parity from random {-1,+1} inputs. n=20 bits, k=3 secret, 17 noise. The "drosophila" of energy-efficient training.
- **Average Reuse Distance (ARD)**: Proxy metric for energy efficiency. Small ARD = data stays in cache = cheap. Large ARD = expensive external memory access.
- **Data Movement Complexity (DMC)**: Better proxy metric (Ding et al., arXiv:2312.14441). DMC = sum of sqrt(stack_distance) for all float accesses. Tracks alongside ARD in MemTracker. Baseline: ARD 4,104 / DMC 300,298.
- **Cache Energy Model**: register 5pJ, L1 (64KB) 20pJ, L2 (256KB) 100pJ, HBM 640pJ per float access (Bill Dally numbers).
- **TrackedArray / Auto DMD**: `TrackedArray` wraps numpy arrays so every operation (ufuncs, indexing, slicing) auto-records reads and writes on an `LRUStackTracker`. Removes manual instrumentation errors. See `docs/research/tracked-numpy.md`.

## Current Best Methods

| Method | Time (n=20/k=3) | ARD | DMC | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-----|-----|-------|
| KM-min (1 sample) | ~0.001s | 20 | 3,578 | New DMC leader. 1 influence sample suffices for parity. |
| GF(2) Gaussian Elimination | 509 us | ~420 | ~203K | 240x faster than SGD, k-independent. Auto-tracked via TrackedArray; old harness reported 8,607. |
| KM Influence Estimation | 0.001-0.006s | 92 | 20,633 | ARD leader. 5 influence samples per bit. |
| SMT Backtracking | 0.002s | 3,360 | 348,336 | Constraint satisfaction approach |
| SGD (baseline) | 0.12s | 8,504 | 1,278,460 | LR=0.1, batch=32, hidden=200 |

GF(2) solves n=100/k=10 in 703 microseconds. Parity is linear over the binary field -- the neural network was solving an easy problem the hard way.

## SGD Config (when using neural nets)

```python
n_bits=20, k_sparse=3, hidden=200, lr=0.1, wd=0.01,
batch_size=32, n_train=1000, max_epochs=200
```

Solves in ~40 epochs / 0.12s with numpy (`fast.py`).

## Nix Development Shell (Optional)

For NixOS users (or those with flakes), a `flake.nix` provides a reproducible environment with python3 + numpy. Non-NixOS users can ignore the nix files.

```bash
nix develop
python3 bin/reproduce-all
```

## Key Findings

**Phase 1 (16 experiments, SGD optimization):**
- LR=0.1 is critical (0.5 overshoots, never triggers phase transition)
- W1 dominates 75% of all float reads -- limits ARD optimization to ~10%
- L2 cache (256KB) eliminates ALL cache misses for both single-sample and batch
- Curriculum learning (n=10 then expand to n=50) gives 14.6x speedup at scale
- SGD breaks when n^k exceeds ~100,000 gradient steps

**Phase 2 (17 experiments, broad search):**
- Algebraic/exact methods (GF(2), KM, SMT) solve instantly -- they exploit that parity is linear over GF(2)
- All 4 local learning rules (Hebbian, Predictive Coding, Equilibrium Propagation, Target Propagation) fail at chance level -- parity requires k-th order interaction detection
- Information-theoretic methods (MI, LASSO, MDL, Random Projections) all solve it but none beats Fourier meaningfully
- RL sequential Q-learning achieves ARD of 1 at inference (reads exactly k=3 bits per prediction)
