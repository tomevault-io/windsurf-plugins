# GitHub push workflow

- After each code fix/change, **create a git commit and push it to GitHub**.
- Use the SSH remote `tron` (`git@github.com:vrushabd/tron.git`) and push to the `main` branch.
- Do **not** force-push.
- Do **not** commit secrets (e.g. `.env.local`, private keys, tokens). If a fix requires changing secret values, leave them uncommitted and tell the user what to set in GitHub/Vercel env vars instead.
