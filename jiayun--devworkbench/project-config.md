│   └── icons/             # App icons
└── public/                # Public assets
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri 2.6
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run tauri dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri build

# Frontend only development
npm run dev

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Implemented Features

- [x] **Number Base Converter** - Convert between binary, octal, decimal, hex, and custom bases
- [x] **Base64 String Encode/Decode** - Encode/decode text using Base64 with smart detection
- [x] **Base58 String Encode/Decode** - Bitcoin/IPFS-friendly encoding without confusing characters
- [x] **Multi-line to JSON Array** - Convert multi-line text to JSON array with auto-trim and smart type detection
- [x] **Hash Generator** - Generate MD5/SHA1/SHA2/SHA3/Keccak hashes using Rust for high performance
- [x] **JSON Formatter & Validator** - Format, validate, and beautify JSON with collapsible viewer, auto-repair for escaped strings, trailing commas, comments, and other common issues
- [x] **UUID Generator** - Generate and validate UUIDs v1/v3/v4/v5/v7 with bulk generation support
- [x] **JWT Token Tool** - Decode, encode, and verify JSON Web Tokens with multiple algorithms (HS256/384/512, RS256/384/512)
- [x] **URL Tools** - Encode/decode URLs, parse URL structure, query string to JSON, and build URLs from components
- [x] **Text Utilities** - HTML entities encode/decode, Unicode conversion, case conversion (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, kebab-case, CONSTANT_CASE), and text statistics
- [x] **Unix Time Converter** - Convert Unix timestamps to human-readable dates with detailed time information including relative time, day/week of year, leap year status, and multiple format options
- [x] **Cron Job Parser** - Parse cron expressions, generate human-readable descriptions, predict execution times, and browse comprehensive example collections with category filtering
- [x] **OpenAPI Spec Filter** - Load OpenAPI spec JSON files, select endpoints with filtering and search, and export filtered spec with only selected endpoints and their referenced components
- [x] **Regex Tester & Builder** - Test and build regular expressions with real-time matching, syntax highlighting, match navigation, and output formatting with capture groups
- [x] **盤古之白 (Pangu Spacing)** - Automatically add spaces between CJK characters and half-width characters for improved readability

## Features to Implement
- [ ] Color picker and converter
- [ ] Image tools
- [ ] Developer tools collection

## Architecture Notes

- Uses Tauri's command system for Rust-React communication
- Tailwind CSS for styling with Radix UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and building

## Development Guidelines

### Version Management
- **CRITICAL**: Always sync version numbers before creating releases
- Update both `package.json` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to match git tag
- **MANDATORY**: Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version and release notes before creating releases
  - Move changes from `[Unreleased]` section to new version section
  - Add release date in format `## [X.X.X] - YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Update version comparison links at bottom of file
- Tauri uses these version numbers for build artifact filenames
- Example: v0.2.2 tag requires "version": "0.2.2" in both files

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` before commits to catch type errors
- Remove unused imports to prevent TS6133 errors in CI
- Strict mode enabled - all imports must be used

### GitHub Actions & CI/CD
- Multi-platform builds: macOS (Intel + ARM64), Windows, Linux
- Artifacts are uploaded with version-specific filenames
- Build failures often due to TypeScript errors or version mismatches
- Use `shell: bash` for cross-platform compatibility in workflows

### Release Process
1. Update features in CLAUDE.md
2. **MANDATORY**: Update CHANGELOG.md with new version entry
   - Move unreleased changes to new version section
   - Add proper version header with date: `## [X.X.X] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Update version comparison links at bottom
3. Sync version numbers in package.json and tauri.conf.json
4. **Run pre-release check**: `npm run pre-release-check`
5. Create git tag matching the version numbers
6. GitHub Actions automatically builds and creates release
7. Verify artifact filenames include correct version numbers

### Pre-Release Checklist
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with new version and release notes
- [ ] package.json version matches intended release version
- [ ] src-tauri/tauri.conf.json version matches intended release version
