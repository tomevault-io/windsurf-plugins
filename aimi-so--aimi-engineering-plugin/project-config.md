# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repo **builds** the aimi-engineering plugin — it is not a plugin consumer. It ships two distribution targets from a single source tree:

- **Claude Code** via `claude /plugin install aimi-engineering` (reads `plugins/aimi-engineering/` directly)
- **OpenCode** via `./install.sh --to opencode` (translates the plugin into OpenCode's structure and installs to `~/.config/opencode/`)

The nested **`plugins/aimi-engineering/CLAUDE.md`** is the source of truth for plugin-internal conventions (versioning, command/skill authoring, schema requirements). Read it when editing anything under `plugins/aimi-engineering/`.

## Dual-Host Architecture

A single source tree serves both hosts. Anything touching CLI path resolution, environment variables, or install mechanics must account for both:

- **`CLAUDECODE=1`** — set by Claude Code in every session. Absent in OpenCode. This is the runtime discriminator used by `aimi-cli.sh` and `commands/references/cli-path-resolution.md` to decide between Claude Code's cache (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/`) and OpenCode's install (`$AIMI_PLUGIN_DIR`).
- **`AIMI_PLUGIN_DIR`** — set by `install.sh` in shell profiles. Only honored when `CLAUDECODE` is unset. Inside Claude Code, Layer 0 resolution skips this entirely so the Claude Code cache always wins.
- **`install.sh`** — performs heavy translation: rewrites command bodies (Task tool mappings, CLI path glob → `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`), handles missing OpenCode features (`disable-model-invocation`, `AskUserQuestion`, custom `subagent_type`), copies/flattens skills and agents. Before changing command syntax or CLI behavior, check whether `install.sh` needs a matching translation.

## Multi-Repo Execution Layout

`AIMI_ROOT` — the directory holding `.aimi/` — is not required to be a git repository. A **multi-repo** layout is a plain, non-git parent folder holding one git repository per subfolder instead, with `.aimi/` living in that parent. `/aimi:execute`, including phase mode, resolves each story's own `project` field to the repository that owns it and runs one container, one branch, and one PR per participating repository — never a single one spanning the whole layout.

Before touching container, branch, or split-detection logic, read:
- `plugins/aimi-engineering/commands/execute.md`'s **Multi-Repo Handling** section — the single source of truth for layout detection and per-project story routing.
- `plugins/aimi-engineering/commands/references/container-execution.md` — the shared container/worktree mechanics every execution mode (flat, container, phase) delegates to.

## Commit Conventions

**Never add Claude (or any AI assistant) as a co-author on commits.** Do not append `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` or similar trailers. Commits are authored by the human running the tool.

## Key Commands

### Testing

Four independent test suites — three plain Bash, one Python (pytest) for the `hooks/` directory:

```bash
bash plugins/aimi-engineering/scripts/test-aimi-cli.sh
bash plugins/aimi-engineering/scripts/test-worktree-manager.sh
bash plugins/aimi-engineering/scripts/test-command-blocks.sh
python3 -m pytest plugins/aimi-engineering/hooks/tests/ -q
```

`plugins/aimi-engineering/hooks/` is the one Python component in this repo; everything else has no build step, no lint step, no package manager and stays plain Bash. The pytest suite requires Python 3.10+ (hook source and tests use `X | None` and `list[int]` union/generic syntax) and `pytest` installed via `pip install pytest`.

- Run `test-aimi-cli.sh` after any change to `plugins/aimi-engineering/scripts/aimi-cli.sh` or files it sources.
- Run `test-worktree-manager.sh` after any change to `plugins/aimi-engineering/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh`.
- **Run `test-command-blocks.sh` after any change under `plugins/aimi-engineering/commands/`** — including changes that touch only prose. Command files are executed, not read: an agent runs their ` ```bash ` blocks literally, each in its own isolated shell, so a "documentation-only" edit is a code change. This suite extracts every bash-fenced block and checks it parses, avoids bash-only constructs (blocks may run under zsh), does not read a variable that only exists inside a loop, and introduces no variable that nothing in the file assigns. Known findings are grandfathered in `scripts/command-blocks-baseline.txt`; the suite fails when a baselined entry stops firing, so that file shrinks as things are fixed. It cannot see a variable that a *prose sentence* reads — that class is only fixed by moving the logic into `aimi-cli.sh`.
- Run `python3 -m pytest plugins/aimi-engineering/hooks/tests/ -q` from the repo root after any change under `plugins/aimi-engineering/hooks/` (dispatcher handlers, guard logic, or their tests).

### OpenCode install verification

```bash
./install.sh --to opencode --dry-run   # preview translation output
./install.sh --to opencode             # perform install
./install.sh --uninstall --from opencode
```
