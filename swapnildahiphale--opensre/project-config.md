# OpenSRE — AI SRE Platform

## What this is

OpenSRE is an open-source AI SRE platform that investigates production incidents. It uses LLM-powered agents with episodic memory and a Neo4j knowledge graph to diagnose issues, identify root causes, and produce structured investigation reports.

## Architecture

```
Web UI -> sre-agent (LangGraph)
                |
          +-----+-----+
          |     |     |
       Memory Skills  KG
config-service <- used by web_ui, sre-agent
```

**sre-agent** is the core investigation agent. Uses LangGraph for orchestration with a planner -> investigation subagents -> synthesizer -> writeup topology. 46 skills (progressive knowledge loading) via `load_skill` + `run_script` tools.

**web_ui** is the admin console and agent entry point (Next.js, pnpm). Agent runs, config editor, knowledge base explorer, memory pages.

**config-service** is the control plane. Hierarchical org->team config with deep merge. Manages tokens and audit logging.

**memory system** -- episodic memory in `sre-agent/memory/`. Stores and retrieves past investigation episodes. Multi-factor similarity matching.

**knowledge graph** -- Neo4j integration for service topology, dependency traversal, blast radius analysis.

**LiteLLM proxy** -- translates API calls to OpenRouter or other LLM providers. Config in `litellm_config.yaml`.

## Local development

```bash
# Copy the example env and add your API key
cp .env.example .env
# Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY in .env

# Start all services (postgres, config-service, litellm, neo4j, sre-agent, web console)
make dev
```

Or use Docker Compose directly:

```bash
docker compose up
```

The web console will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key files

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| sre-agent/graph.py | LangGraph master graph -- nodes, edges, Send() fan-out |
| sre-agent/state.py | GraphState TypedDict, AlertInput, reducers |
| sre-agent/nodes/ | Graph nodes: init_context, planner, subagent_executor, synthesizer, writeup, memory_store |
| sre-agent/server.py | FastAPI server, SSE streaming via graph.astream_events() |
| sre-agent/tools/ | Neo4j semantic layer, skill_tools (load_skill/run_script), agent_tools (tool registry) |
| sre-agent/memory/ | Episodic memory system |
| config_service/src/api/main.py | Config API with hierarchical merge |
| web_ui/src/app/ | Next.js app router pages |
| charts/opensre/ | Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment |
| litellm_config.yaml | LLM routing config |

## Conventions

- Python services use `uv` (sre-agent, config-service)
- web_ui is Next.js with pnpm
- Linting: ruff (config in ruff.toml)
- Skills over tools: add integrations as `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` with scripts
- Config hierarchy: org base, team overrides. Dicts merge, lists replace.
- Error format: `{"success": bool, "result": ..., "error": "..."}`
- SSE streaming: events defined in events.py
