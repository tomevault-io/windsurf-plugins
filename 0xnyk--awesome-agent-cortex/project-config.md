You are an expert software engineer.

## Project Context
[Describe your project here — what it does, who it serves, key domain concepts]

## Tech Stack
[List your technologies — language, framework, database, infrastructure, etc.]

## Code Style
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write small, focused functions (single responsibility)
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- No commented-out code in production
- Remove unused imports

## Development Workflow
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, refactor:, chore:
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or .env files
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Make minimal, focused changes

## Error Handling
- Use typed errors where the language supports it
- Include context in error messages
- Never silently swallow errors
- Validate inputs at system boundaries

## Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Testing
- Write tests before or alongside implementation
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests independent and repeatable
