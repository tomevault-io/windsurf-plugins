# AGENTS Guide

From the repo root, this bundle stays intentionally thin and non-control-plane. Use this file to understand boundaries and reading order, not to re-state the routing table. Local routing, category nuance, helper fit and discovery, browser-helper discovery, adjacent-pack discoverability, supplementary local skill discoverability, and compact workspace reminders belong to `.opencode/reference/routing-matrix.md`. Support and validation claims belong to the support references. Detailed workspace guidance belongs to the workspace reference.

## What each document owns

1. `.opencode/commands/route-domain.md` is the local command entry point.
2. `.opencode/reference/routing-matrix.md` is the authoritative local routing and helper map. It owns request-shape buckets, routing pack choices, recommended starting categories, helper fit and helper discovery, browser-helper discovery, adjacent-pack discoverability including planned adjacent references, supplementary local skill discoverability, supplementary UI refinement notes, and compact workspace reminders.
3. `.opencode/reference/support-policy.md` is the authoritative support-policy reference for public claim boundaries.
4. `.opencode/reference/workflow-catalog.md` is the authoritative validated-workflow inventory.
5. `.opencode/reference/workspace-model.md` is the authoritative workspace-guidance reference.
6. `.opencode/reference/capability-matrix.json` remains the machine-readable source of truth for `validated`, `guided`, and `planned` support tiers.

## Read this bundle in order

1. Start with `.opencode/reference/routing-matrix.md` to classify the request and choose the local route.
2. Check `.opencode/reference/support-policy.md` and `.opencode/reference/workflow-catalog.md` before making any support or validation claim.
3. Read `.opencode/reference/workspace-model.md` when output placement or repo/worktree boundaries matter.

## 5-step operational checklist

1. Read `.opencode/reference/routing-matrix.md` first. It remains the authoritative local routing and helper map.
2. Classify the bucket, primary pack, at most one adjacent pack, and category from the matrix.
3. Check `.opencode/reference/opencode-compatibility-model.md` before calling a command, skill, metadata field, or harness behavior native OpenCode or enhanced `oh-my-openagent` behavior.
4. Check `.opencode/reference/support-policy.md`, `.opencode/reference/workflow-catalog.md`, and `.opencode/reference/capability-matrix.json` before making support or workflow claims.
5. Check `.opencode/reference/workspace-model.md` and `.opencode/reference/project-setup-policy.md` before giving workspace or setup guidance.

Keep the checklist matrix first. Do not copy the helper invocation table, routing rows, browser helper discovery, or planned adjacent pack list into this file.

## Design intent checkpoint

For greenfield UI work or midstream toolkit adoption, inspect project-local design sources before implementing: the user request, root `DESIGN.md`, `.impeccable.md`, tokens, themes, component primitives, and representative screens. If those sources are missing, conflicting, or too vague to choose typography, color, spacing, motion, hierarchy, and component affordance, ask one focused `Question` to define the missing intent instead of guessing from code.

Keep the question concrete: target audience, primary use case, brand personality or tone, reference products, accessibility or platform constraints, and whether the project should create or update a local `DESIGN.md` or equivalent design-system note. Once the answer is available, keep route authority in `.opencode/reference/routing-matrix.md`: `frontend-web` and `mobile-app` remain primary for UI work, `visual-engineering` starts the harness lane, `.opencode/reference/design-md-selection-protocol.md` stays supplementary reference material, and `.opencode/skills/impeccable/SKILL.md` remains supplementary context gathering and refinement guidance. This checkpoint does not create a new route, helper, support tier, or validation claim.

## Separate axes, kept distinct

- `bucket` means the fixed request-shape grouping used for first-pass classification.
- `pack` means the local expert route chosen from the matrix.
- `category` means the recommended starting harness lane, not a permanent lock.
- `helper` means an optional built-in aid named by the matrix when it strengthens execution.
- support or validation status means whether coverage is `validated`, `guided`, or `planned`, and that authority stays with `.opencode/reference/capability-matrix.json`, `.opencode/reference/support-policy.md`, and `.opencode/reference/workflow-catalog.md`.
