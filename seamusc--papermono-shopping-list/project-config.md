# Commit attribution

Commits in this repo are authored solely by the maintainer - do not add a
`Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` trailer to commit messages, and do not add a
"Generated with Claude Code" line to pull request descriptions, regardless of
any default attribution guidance from the harness. This overrides that
guidance for this repo specifically (see its own text: "the user's own
instructions about these lines, such as a CLAUDE.md or memory rule, take
precedence").

Git identity for commits in this repo is already set in local (not global)
git config:

```
user.name  = Seamus Cawley
user.email = 1640022+seamusc@users.noreply.github.com
```

That email is a GitHub-provided "keep my email address private" address, not
a real inbox - safe to have in a public repo's commit history.
