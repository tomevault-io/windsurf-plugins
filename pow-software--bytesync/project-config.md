## Project Overview

**ByteSync** is an open-source file synchronization software with end-to-end encryption and smart delta transfers, supporting up to 5 remote locations per session.

This is a C#/.NET 8 solution with a client-server architecture:

### Main Projects
- **`ByteSync.Client/`** - Cross-platform desktop app (Avalonia UI, ReactiveUI/MVVM)
- **`ByteSync.Functions/`** - Azure Functions serverless backend (HTTP APIs, SignalR hub)
- **`ByteSync.Common/`** - Shared business logic and domain models
- **`ByteSync.ServerCommon/`** - Server-side services and data repositories

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: Avalonia UI, ReactiveUI
- **Backend**: Azure Functions, SignalR, MediatR (CQRS)
- **Storage**: Azure Cosmos DB, Redis
- **Sync**: FastRsync for binary diffs

## Branch & PR Guidelines

### Overview
This repository uses a branch-based development workflow. Please follow the conventions below when working in this project, especially when creating branches, writing PR titles, and generating commits or documentation.
Agents must not create branches until they have received clear instructions to do so from a human or an explicitly
invoked skill.

### Branch Naming
Use the following prefixes:
- `feature/<name>` for new features
- `fix/<name>` for bug fixes
- `refactor/<name>` for refactorings
- `docs/<name>` for refactorings
- `test/<name>` for tests

Avoid slashes other than the prefix.

### PR Titles
Format:
`[<type>] <Short summary>`

Allowed types: `feature`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`

Examples:
- `[feature] Add user registration`
- `[bugfix] Fix memory leak in sync module`

### PR Descriptions

- PR descriptions must be written in English.
- Include a summary of the changes, main modifications, and implementation approach when relevant.

### Notes for Agents
- Never propose changes directly on `master`.
- Always create a branch using the proper prefix.
- PR titles must follow the documented format.

## Commenting Guidelines
- All comments must be written in English.
- Do not add comments or Javadoc/XML-style documentation in C# code.
- Comments are only allowed when strictly necessary to explain complex or non-obvious logic.
- Prefer clear and self-explanatory code over adding comments.

### Testing Style & Conventions
- **Assertions**: use FluentAssertions (`.Should()`). **Do not use** `NUnit.Framework.Legacy` / `ClassicAssert`.
- **Usings**: remove `using NUnit.Framework.Legacy;` from tests.
- **Structure**: follow Arrange–Act–Assert. Use clear, English names and messages.

### Coverage Requirements
- **Target per new unit test class**: ≥ 85% coverage.
- **PR Quality (Sonar)**: each PR must maintain a minimum coverage of 80%.

## Build and Test Guidelines
- Always run build and test as two separate commands to avoid blocking issues. 
- If you need to clean the solution, use `dotnet clean --verbosity quiet` before building.
