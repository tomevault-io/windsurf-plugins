# AGENTS.md

These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Repository purpose

GPUI.NET is a semantic C# frontend for Rust GPUI. C# owns application state, managed Views, themes,
and product-specific style variants. Rust owns GPUI, native windows, validation, retained controls,
virtualization, deferred layers, and frame-sensitive interaction.

Do not turn the project into a one-to-one P/Invoke mirror of GPUI. Prefer one semantic declaration,
coarse data batches, and native retained state over per-property, per-frame, or per-row crossings.

## Start here

Read the relevant focused document before changing a subsystem:

- `README.md`: setup and public API overview
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: ownership and render/resource paths
- `docs/COMPONENTS.md`: component classes and authoring workflow
- `docs/VIEW_LIFECYCLE.md`: child slots, render purity, and teardown
- `docs/THREADING.md`: GPUI entities, managed lifecycle, async continuations, and thread boundaries
- `docs/HOT_RELOAD.md`: managed metadata-update and renderer refresh contract
- `docs/ABI.md`: C layouts, validation, commands, and callbacks
- `docs/BINDING_GENERATION.md`: generated code ownership
- `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`: crossing and allocation constraints
- `docs/PACKAGING.md`: package graph and native assets

## Source-of-truth rules

`bindings/schema.json` is the source of truth for semantic components, operations, capabilities,
payload constraints, native adapters, and the managed/native schema hash.

After changing it, run:

```sh
dotnet run --project tools/Gpui.Bindings.Generator -- generate
dotnet run --project tools/Gpui.Bindings.Generator -- verify
```

Never hand-edit:

- `src/Gpui/Rendering/Semantic.g.cs`
- `crates/gpui-dotnet/src/semantic.g.rs`
- `src/Gpui/Interop/NativeMethods.g.cs`

The native Cargo build generates `NativeMethods.g.cs` from Rust C-layout definitions through
`csbindgen`. Include that generated change whenever `crates/gpui-dotnet/src/abi.rs` changes.

## Cross-platform behavior

Changes must add or preserve support rather than replacing one platform path with another.

- Keep the Windows managed/app-side title-bar and menu implementation working.
- Keep the native macOS system title bar, traffic lights, and global application menu working.
- Keep forced managed title/menu composition available on macOS.
- Keep manual title-bar composition possible on every platform.
- Put platform-specific window behavior in Rust or narrowly scoped managed platform selection; do
  not scatter `OperatingSystem.IsMacOS()` branches through sample views.
- Do not claim a platform is verified unless its native build or behavior was actually checked.

## Themes and styles

`GpuiTheme` is application-wide ambient render input. Theme changes must update:

- every retained managed child fragment;
- virtual List/Table row batches;
- native component defaults and retained controls;
- window/root inherited colors.

Native theme payloads contain resolved semantic roles only. Product variants such as Primary,
Danger, Navigation, or Compact belong in the application and should use
`IGpuiElementStyle<TTag>`. Do not add a fixed library style definition for every component variant.

Prefer inherited container text/background roles over repeated leaf styling, while preserving
explicit component states and contrast.

## Managed View rules

`Render()` and `[GpuiListItem]` methods may be retried after native arena growth. They must be
deterministic and must not mutate application state, perform I/O, start tasks, call controllers, or
invalidate the View.

Event bindings and ref-bound controller key initialization are supported render-time declarations.
Perform state changes in event or lifecycle methods and then call `Invalidate()`.

Use framework-owned `ui.Child<T>()` slots. Use `View<TProps>` for parent-owned render inputs; props
must be supplied on every declaration. Use stable keys for conditional, repeated, or reorderable
children.

Props must implement `IEquatable<TProps>` through the `View<TProps>` generic constraint. Prefer
records or record structs; do not weaken the constraint and silently reintroduce boxed comparisons.

View lifetime follows framework ownership: a window owns its root and a committed parent slot owns
its child. A CLR reference does not retain UI ownership. Unmount is terminal, so do not add remount
semantics or implicit/manual child retention. `OnUnmounted()` is cleanup-only: its `Lifetime` is
already cancelled and runtime commands are unavailable.

Keep one-shot View identity separate from mounted runtime state. Any-thread operations must use the
stable, non-pooled command route and must not inspect the GPUI-thread-only attachment. Remove and
fully reset that attachment before user unmount cleanup; only the attachment may be pooled.

Virtual rows are element-only cached snapshots. Do not add mounted child Views, nested retained
resources, or deferred layers inside a row renderer.

## Native and ABI rules

- Validate all pointer/length pairs and reserved fields before dereference.
- Prevent Rust panics and managed exceptions from crossing FFI.
- Keep fixed-width C layouts synchronized and covered by tests.
- Execute GPUI mutations on the native application thread.
