# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Podwhisperer v2 is a serverless podcast transcription pipeline built with AWS CDK. It uses GPU-accelerated WhisperX for transcription with speaker diarization, followed by a multi-step post-processing pipeline that includes LLM-based refinement and caption generation.

The project is structured as a **pnpm monorepo** with these packages:

- `cdk/` - AWS CDK infrastructure code
- `lambdas/pipeline/` - Pipeline Lambda function (durable execution workflow)
- `packages/config/` - Shared configuration schemas and types
- `whisperx-image/` - Docker container for GPU transcription worker

## Common Commands

### Building

```bash
pnpm run build              # Build all packages
pnpm --filter @podwhisperer/cdk run build  # Build only CDK
```

### CDK Operations

Run from repository root:

```bash
pnpm cdk synth   # Synthesize CloudFormation (outputs to cdk/cdk.out/)
pnpm cdk diff    # Compare deployed stack with current state
pnpm cdk deploy  # Deploy stack to AWS
pnpm cdk destroy # Tear down deployed stack
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
pnpm lint    # Check code with Biome
pnpm format  # Format code with Biome
```

### Testing

```bash
pnpm --filter @podwhisperer/pipeline test  # Run pipeline tests
pnpm --filter @podwhisperer/config test    # Run config tests
```

## Architecture

### Pipeline Flow

1. **S3 Upload** triggers EventBridge rule on `input/` prefix
2. **Pipeline Lambda** (durable execution) orchestrates the workflow:
   - Sends job to SQS queue
   - Waits for callback from GPU worker
   - Applies post-processing steps (fill timing gaps, replacement, LLM, normalization)
   - Generates captions (VTT, SRT, JSON)
   - Sends EventBridge notification
3. **GPU Worker** (ECS container on Managed Instances):
   - Polls SQS queue
   - Downloads audio, runs WhisperX transcription
   - Uploads raw transcript, sends callback to Lambda

### Key Components

**CDK Stack** (`cdk/lib/podwhisperer-stack.ts`):
- S3 bucket with EventBridge notifications
- SQS queue for GPU worker tasks
- Pipeline Lambda with durable execution
- ECS cluster with Managed Instances capacity provider (GPU)
- Auto-scaling: 0 tasks when idle, 1 task when messages arrive

**Pipeline Lambda** (`lambdas/pipeline/index.ts`):
- Uses `@aws/durable-execution-sdk-js` for long-running workflows
- `waitForCallback` pauses execution until GPU worker completes
- Each step is a separate `context.step()` for checkpointing

**Configuration** (`packages/config/index.ts`):
- Zod schemas for all pipeline configuration
- Exported types: `PipelineConfig`, `TranscriptionConfig`, `FillTimingGapsConfig`, etc.
- Used by both CDK (at synth time) and Lambda (at runtime)

## Important Implementation Notes

### Durable Execution

The pipeline Lambda uses AWS Durable Execution to survive Lambda timeouts:
- Workflow state is automatically checkpointed
- `waitForCallback` suspends execution until GPU worker calls back
- Lambda alias (`live`) is required for durable invocation

### GPU Instance Provisioning

ECS Managed Instances automatically provision GPU instances:
- Instance requirements: 4-16 vCPUs, 16+ GiB memory, 1 NVIDIA GPU
- Scales to zero when no work (no GPU costs when idle)
- Uses spot instances for cost savings

### Container Image Build

The WhisperX model is baked into the container at build time:
- `MODEL_NAME` build arg specifies which Whisper model to include
