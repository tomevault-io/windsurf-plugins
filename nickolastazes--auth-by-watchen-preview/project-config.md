# [CRYPTO PROJECT]

## Project Context

[INSERT DESCRIPTION OF YOUR PROJECT]

- Security and UX are our first priorities.

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Always be careful to follow good practises for Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Use function, not const, for components
- Use Tailwind and Tailwind Aria for components and styling.
- Refer to Next.js documentation via the Context7 MCP for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing best practices.
- Minimize 'useEffect'

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Next.js 15 Pages Router
- React
- Viem v1 & v2
- Wagmi v1 & v2
- Tailwind
- MongoDB
- Transak for crypto on and off ramp

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/form-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., VisaForm.tsx)
- Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., formValidator.ts)

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const' assertion
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Define strict types for message passing between different parts of the extension
- Use absolute imports for all files @/...
- Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's good reason to translate or handle error in that abstraction
- Use explicit return types for all functions

## State Management

- Use React Context for global state when needed
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals
- Use declarative JSX
- Implement proper TypeScript discriminated unions for message types

## UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Framer motion for smooth animations
- Hover must always be in larger screens e.g. lg:hover:[CLASS]

## Error Handling

- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.

## Security

- Implement Content Security Policy
- Sanitize user inputs
- Handle sensitive data properly
- Implement proper CORS handling
- Make use of the middleware

## Git Usage

Commit Message Prefixes:

- "fix:" for bug fixes
- "feat:" for new features
- "perf:" for performance improvements
- "docs:" for documentation changes
- "style:" for formatting changes
- "refactor:" for code refactoring
- "test:" for adding missing tests
- "chore:" for maintenance tasks

Rules:

- Use lowercase for commit messages
- Keep the summary line concise
- Include description for non-obvious changes
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

## Development Workflow

- Use proper version control
- Implement proper code review process
- Follow semantic versioning for releases
- Maintain changelog
