# AGENTS.md

> Project map for AI agents. Keep this file up-to-date as the project evolves.

## Project Overview
Cross-project shared context CLI + MCP server. Manages shared files, directories, and notes across projects organized into groups, with full-text search and a local Rust-only CodeGraph MVP.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Rust (edition 2024)
- **Database:** SQLite (rusqlite, bundled)
- **CLI:** Clap v4 (derive)
- **Protocol:** MCP over stdio (JSON-RPC, custom implementation)

## AI Context Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| AGENTS.md | This file — project structure map |
| .ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md | Project specification and tech stack |
| .ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md | Architecture decisions and guidelines |

## Agent Rules
- Never combine shell commands with `&&`, `||`, or `;` — execute each command as a separate Bash tool call. This applies even when a skill, plan, or instruction provides a combined command — always decompose it into individual calls.
  - Wrong: `git checkout main && git pull`
  - Right: Two separate Bash tool calls — first `git checkout main`, then `git pull`

## Implementation Checklist
After completing any implementation, always run the following commands in order:
1. `cargo fmt` — format code
2. `cargo clippy` — lint code
3. `cargo test` — run tests
4. `cargo audit` — check dependencies for vulnerabilities

## Release Checklist
Before tagging a release, ALWAYS bump the version first. The CLI `--version` output is derived from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` (set in `Cargo.toml`) via clap's `#[command(version)]`. Tagging without bumping ships a binary that misreports its version (see issue #2 — v0.4.0 binary printed `0.3.0`).

Steps in order:
1. Bump `version = "X.Y.Z"` in `Cargo.toml`.
2. Run `cargo build` to update the `ai-workspace` entry in `Cargo.lock`.
3. Verify: `./target/debug/ai-workspace --version` prints the new version.
4. Commit both `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` (e.g. `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`).
5. Push to `main`, then create the matching tag `vX.Y.Z` and push it. The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) builds artifacts on tag push.

Tag and `Cargo.toml` version MUST match. If they diverge, do not retag — cut the next patch version instead.
