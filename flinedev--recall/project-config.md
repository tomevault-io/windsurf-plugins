## Architecture: PreCompact writes, CLAUDE.md reads, SessionStart cleans

Claude Code's SessionStart hook stdout is silently dropped ([bug](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/28305)).
However, CLAUDE.md IS re-read from disk after every compaction, and `@file` references are resolved during that re-read.

### Hook Flow

1. **PreCompact hook** (`pre-compact.sh`):
   - Parses transcript → generates recall content
   - If >20K tokens: condenses with a single `claude -p --model sonnet` call (~30-40s)
   - Writes result to `.claude/recall-context.md` in the project directory
   - Also writes to `/tmp/recall-<session-id>.md` as a persistent copy

2. **Compaction happens**:
   - Claude Code re-reads CLAUDE.md from disk
   - CLAUDE.md contains `@.claude/recall-context.md` (first line)
   - The recall content is pulled into Claude's context automatically

3. **SessionStart(compact) hook** (`post-compact.sh`):
   - Outputs a short stdout reminder to Claude to act on the recall transcript

4. **SessionStart hook** (`session-start.sh`):
   - Empties `.claude/recall-context.md` (writes placeholder comment)
   - Matcher `""` matches ALL sources (startup, compact, resume, clear)
   - After compaction: safe because CLAUDE.md was already re-read (content consumed)
   - Essential for parallel sessions — stale content from one session must not leak into another
   - On fresh starts: catches leftovers from interrupted compactions

### Why this ordering works

- CLAUDE.md is read BEFORE hooks fire (confirmed by research)
- PreCompact runs BEFORE compaction → file has content when CLAUDE.md is re-read
- SessionStart runs AFTER CLAUDE.md is read → cleaning up doesn't affect current read

### Edge cases

- **Multiple sessions same project**: PreCompact overwrites the file (last writer wins). SessionStart always cleans up, so parallel sessions don't see stale content.
- **Interrupted compaction**: If the user exits mid-compaction, the file may still have content. SessionStart on the next fresh session cleans it up.

## Condensation Strategy

Tail-preservation approach (replaced the old 48-parallel-Haiku-call approach that took 5 minutes):

- **≤20K tokens**: Keep the full transcript as-is, no API call
- **>20K tokens**: Keep last ~15K tokens verbatim (snapping to exchange boundaries), summarize up to 85K of older context with a single Sonnet call

Produces ~17.5K token output (within the 15-20K target range, ~10% of Claude Code's 200K context window).

## Per-Project Setup

Each project needs four things (configured by `/recall:compact-on`):

1. `@.claude/recall-context.md` as the first line of CLAUDE.md
2. `.claude/recall-context.md` file (placeholder, auto-populated by hook)
3. `.claude/recall-context.md` in `.gitignore`
4. Recall hooks in `.claude/settings.json` (per-project, written by compact-on so users control which projects use it)

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

All 170 tests should pass. If pytest is not installed: `pipx install pytest`.

### When to Run Tests

- **After ANY change** to scripts in `skills/session/scripts/` — run the full suite
- **After modifying test fixtures** — regenerate with `python3 tests/generate_fixtures.py` then run tests
- **Before committing** — always verify all tests pass

### When to Write New Tests

- **New script functionality** — add tests covering the new behavior
- **Bug fixes** — add a regression test that reproduces the bug before fixing it
- **New tool type support** in `summarize_tool_call()` — add parametrized test cases in `test_parse_tool_calls.py`
- **Changes to split/combine logic** — add tests in `test_condense_tail.py`
- **Changed JSONL parsing** — add or update fixture variants in `generate_fixtures.py`

### Test Fixture Conventions

All fixtures use a fictional **"TaskTracker" Rust CLI project** with user "alex". This is intentional — the Recall repo is public, so test data must contain **zero personal information**. When adding fixtures:
