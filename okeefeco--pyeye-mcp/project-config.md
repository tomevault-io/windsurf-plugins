@.claude/instructions/06-workflow-commits.md
@.claude/instructions/07-validation.md
@.claude/instructions/11-pr-requirements.md

## Required Development Practices

@.claude/instructions/03-mcp-dogfooding.md

## Tools and Utilities

@.claude/instructions/09-task-management.md

## Optional Human Documentation References

These files contain detailed human documentation that you can reference if needed:

Note: The mandatory Claude-specific rules from CONTRIBUTING.md have been extracted to appropriate instruction files

## Detailed Worktree-Aware Workflow

## Optional User-Specific Configuration

For personal development settings (worktrees, local paths, etc.):

@~/.claude/projects/okeefeco/pyeye-mcp.md

This file is optional and ignored if it doesn't exist. It won't be committed to the repository.

## Dogfooding Metrics Tracking

To measure our MCP adoption:

```bash
# View real-time analytics
mcp-report         # 7-day report
mcp-report-month   # 30-day report
mcp-logs          # Watch live activity
mcp-session       # View active session
mcp-errors        # Check for hook errors
```

Metrics tracking is automatic via Claude Code hooks. See `scripts/claude_hooks/README.md` for details.
