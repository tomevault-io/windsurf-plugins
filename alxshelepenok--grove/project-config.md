# Agents

This document contains links to available skill documentation for agents.

## Skills

- **[Grove](docs/skills/index.md)**: a dual-track, evidence-based workflow for AI agents.

## Architecture

- **[Bootstrap trust](docs/architecture/bootstrap-trust.md)**: how a fresh user establishes trust in Grove binaries: HTTPS fetch, embedded release public key anchor, and signed-manifest verification of every artifact.
- **[Key management](docs/architecture/key-management.md)**: cryptographic keys behind Grove's release trust: inventory, where each half lives, rotation, and rejected alternatives.
- **[Release distribution](docs/architecture/release-distribution.md)**: build, sign, and distribute flow: GitHub Releases channel, `release.yml` workflow, artifact inventory, signed manifest schema, and commit-back sync.
- **[Supply chain trust](docs/architecture/supply-chain-trust.md)**: third-party code controls: dependency policy, trivy audit pipeline with VEX suppression, SBOM generation, weekly scans, vendored JS provenance, and CI hardening.

## Policy

- **[Annex VII technical documentation](docs/security/annex-vii.md)**: CRA Annex VII (Regulation (EU) 2024/2847, Article 31) applicability assessment and the transparency artifact inventory Grove maintains as a lightweight analogue.
- **[Compliance and versioning](docs/security/compliance.md)**: regulatory posture, versioning and support policy, release signing coverage, network egress, and telemetry policy.

## Runbooks

- **[Publish release](docs/security/runbooks/publish-release.md)**: publish a signed release `vX.Y.Z` through the `Release` workflow, including post-release smoke test and transparency-log commit-back.
- **[Manual release security checks](docs/security/runbooks/release-security-checks.md)**: per-release checklist to run after the commit-back PR merges, before the release is announced.
- **[Release signing key generation](docs/security/runbooks/key-generation.md)**: generate the RSA-2048 release signing keypair, publish the public half, and store the private half in the GitHub `release` environment secret plus offline backup.
- **[Rotate signing key](docs/security/runbooks/rotate-signing-key.md)**: replace the release signing keypair on schedule or after compromise, with an overlap window so old installers still verify.
- **[Refresh manifest](docs/security/runbooks/manifest-refresh.md)**: re-sign the root `manifest.json` when its 180-day TTL nears expiry, without cutting a release.
- **[Update VEX](docs/security/runbooks/update-vex.md)**: triage new trivy findings into `not_affected` statements in the signed VEX document or a fix, within one weekly cycle.
- **[Incident response](docs/security/runbooks/incident-response.md)**: on-call procedure for signing-key or release-pipeline compromise: secret revocation and dispatch freeze in CI-based signing.

## Usage

Each skill document contains:
- Name and description for agent identification.
- Detailed implementation guidelines.
- Code examples and best practices.
- Usage scenarios and recommendations.

Agents should reference these documents when working on related tasks to ensure consistency and follow established patterns.

## Assertion grounding

Agents state plausible-sounding but ungrounded claims about repository content with high fluency and no internal uncertainty signal, including about code they just wrote. Recall is not evidence. The rules below are binding for any statement produced in this repository:

- Every factual claim about a specific artifact (identifier behavior, semantics, values, colors, statuses, markup) requires a fresh read or grep of that artifact in the current session before the claim is written. If the artifact was not just read, read it first.
- Deliverable prose that describes the system (posts, docs, README sections, release notes) carries a claims ledger while drafting: each claim mapped to the source that proves it. Unmapped claims get verified or cut.
- Descriptions of code prefer file:line pointers over paraphrase. A pointer is checkable in one click, a paraphrase is trust.
- A green parse, import, or unit suite over pure modules is not verification for runtime paths (event handlers, shaders, DOM teardown). Execute the path or label the statement as unverified.
- Claims about the repo that cannot be grounded this way are labeled as guesses in the same sentence.
