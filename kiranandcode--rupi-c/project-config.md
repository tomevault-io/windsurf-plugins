NO UNVERIFIED ARTIFACTS.

Never add, suggest, or preserve an unverified assembly lane.

Do not emit SQLite assembly unless the Rocq proof closes with `Qed`.

`Abort` means pending. It must not feed benchmarks, linking, or baselines.

The witness `R` is an `Asm.program` produced by CompCert:

```coq
Compiler.transf_c_program source = OK R
```

All SQLite contexts must reduce to concrete `Csyntax.program` sources.
