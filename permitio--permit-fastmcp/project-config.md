# CursorRules for permit-fastmcp

# Python Best Practices
- Follow PEP8 for code style and formatting.
- Use type hints and docstrings for all public functions and classes.
- Prefer async/await for I/O-bound operations.
- Use logging instead of print statements.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and provide helpful error messages.
- Keep functions small and focused; prefer composition over inheritance.
- Use environment variables or config files for secrets and settings.
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes.

# Attitude 
When a soild fix - apply it without asking

# Dependency Management & Publishing
- Use `uv` for installing, updating, and publishing packages:
  - Install dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Add a dependency: `uv pip install <package>`
  - Update lockfile: `uv pip compile`
  - Publish: `uv publish`
- Keep `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, and `uv.lock` in sync.

# Documentation & Project Hygiene
- Update `llms.txt` with any new usage patterns, configuration, or developer instructions.
- Update `README.md` to reflect new features, configuration options, or breaking changes.
- Add or update inline comments for complex logic.
- Ensure all public APIs are documented.

# General
- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Remove unused code and files.
- Keep the codebase clean and organized.
