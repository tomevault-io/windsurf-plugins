# AGENTS.md

## Mission

Build and maintain `bolt.gives` as a production-ready agentic coding platform. The product must be reliable, visibly transparent while it works, safe when it acts autonomously, and easy to self-host.

Current release line:
- Stable: `v3.0.9.1`
- In progress: `v3.1.0`

Core rule: do not ship hidden behavior. If the agent takes action, the user must be able to see what happened, why it happened, and what the next step is.

## Repo, Branches, and Live Targets

- Primary repo: `https://github.com/embire2/bolt.gives`
- Release branch: `main`
- Optional soak/staging branch: `alpha`

Live surfaces to validate when a core path changes:
- `https://alpha1.bolt.gives`
- `https://ahmad.bolt.gives`
- `https://bolt-gives.pages.dev`
- `https://admin.bolt.gives`
- `https://create.bolt.gives`

Branch policy:
- High-risk work may land on `alpha` first.
- Verify on `alpha1`.
- Fast-forward or merge cleanly into `main`.
- Keep `main` as release source-of-truth.
- If no active soak test is running, keep `alpha` aligned with `main`.
- Never force-push shared branches unless explicitly approved.

## Product Baseline You Must Preserve

The current hosted product baseline is:
- Chat-first landing surface
- Separate `Chat` and `Workspace` tabs
- Live commentary feed
- Technical feed / execution transparency
- Hosted server-first runtime for install/build/dev/test/preview on managed instances
- Preview auto-recovery via server-side health checks
- Managed `FREE` provider locked to one hosted model:
  - provider: `FREE`
  - model: `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2`
- Managed Cloudflare trial-instance flow at `/managed-instances`
- Private operator/admin control plane at `admin.bolt.gives`
- Operator profile filtering/export plus audience-based outbound email from `admin.bolt.gives`
- Header-level `Shout Out Box` broadcast messaging with user-side settings toggle
- Interactive self-host installer with local PostgreSQL and Caddy HTTPS support

Do not regress any of the above without an explicit user request.

## Non-Negotiable Security Rules

- Never commit API keys, tokens, cookies, session dumps, or private logs.
- Keep secrets in `.env.local`, runtime env files, or service environment variables.
- Do not leak operator-funded keys to the browser.
- The hosted `FREE` path must remain server-side only.
- Managed-instance or admin payloads must not expose Cloudflare credentials, internal hashes, or private admin DB credentials.

## Current Hosting / Runtime Facts

- `/srv/bolt-gives` is the live deployed tree on this server.
- `/srv/bolt-gives-runtime-workspaces` holds hosted runtime workspaces.
- Deployments are often done by syncing repo contents into `/srv/bolt-gives` without `.git`; do not assume the live `.git` SHA reflects the running code unless you verified the deploy method.
- Main services:
  - `bolt-gives-app.service`
  - `bolt-gives-runtime.service`
  - `bolt-gives-collab.service`

When changing hosted runtime behavior, validate both the app service and the runtime service.

## Work Scope Rules

- Prioritize reproducible failures and approved roadmap work.
- One logical change per commit unless a larger atomic change is required for correctness.
- Avoid unrelated refactors during hotfixes.
- Keep behavior changes explicit in commit messages and docs.
- If you encounter unexpected unrelated file modifications while editing, stop and assess before overwriting them.

## v3.1.0 Priorities

These are the current release priorities:
- Prompt-to-preview reliability
- Clear execution state in both `Chat` and `Workspace`
- Commentary derived from actual runtime events, not filler
- Remaining browser-weight reduction on editor/PDF/git/terminal surfaces
- Managed Cloudflare rollout/refresh/rollback observability
- Admin/operator segmentation and broadcast tooling without secret leakage
- Tenant/account/RBAC hardening
- Self-host installer resilience
- First-party template packs and smoke coverage

Recent critical issue context:
- A real failure mode existed where stale “starter placeholder” detection could roll a valid generated app back to the fallback starter.
- Current fixes ignore stale starter detections when active workspace files no longer contain the starter placeholder.
- Preserve that behavior unless replacing it with something stricter and provably better.

## Mandatory Implementation Workflow

1. Confirm current behavior
- Reproduce the issue or validate the gap.
- Record the exact runtime path, affected files, and live surface.

2. Implement the smallest safe fix
- Preserve contracts where possible.
- Add strict-provider safeguards when touching tools or stream schemas.

3. Add regression coverage
- Put tests close to the changed code.
- Include at least one test that would have failed before the fix.

4. Validate locally
- `pnpm run typecheck`
- `pnpm run lint`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm run build`

5. Run targeted E2E smoke when the change touches any of:
- chat streaming
- providers / API-key selection
- preview / runtime handoff
- file actions
- deployments
- auth / tenant flows
- managed Cloudflare trials

6. Update docs in the same change set
- `CHANGELOG.md`
