# Native-First Architecture

## Crate Boundaries

- `common` is the leaf crate. It has no internal dependencies. Every other crate may depend on it.
- `core` depends on `common` only. It owns the agent loop, provider abstraction, tool registry, and approval policy.
- `runtime` depends on `common` and `core`. It owns PTY management, sandboxed process execution, IPC, session persistence, and tmux integration.
- `cli` depends on `common`, `core`, and `runtime`. It owns the TUI, REPL, rendering, and user input.

## No JavaScript

- Never introduce a dependency that requires Node.js, npm, or a JavaScript runtime.
- Never use a webview-based framework (Tauri, Dioxus Desktop, Electron) in any crate.

## Async Convention

- All I/O (network, file, PTY, IPC) must be async via `tokio`.
- Never call blocking I/O on the tokio runtime. Use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for unavoidable blocking work.
- Prefer `tokio::sync::mpsc` for internal channels. Use `tokio::sync::broadcast` only when multiple consumers need the same stream.

## Error Handling

- Library crates (`common`, `core`, `runtime`) define typed errors with `thiserror`.
- The application crate (`cli`) may use `anyhow` for top-level error propagation.
- Never use `.unwrap()` or `.expect()` in library code. Application code may use `.expect()` only during startup for required config.

## Public API Surface

- Keep `pub` exports minimal. Default to `pub(crate)` and only promote to `pub` when another crate needs the item.
- Every public type and trait must have a doc comment.
