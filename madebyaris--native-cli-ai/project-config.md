# CLI and Agent Conventions

## Provider Abstraction

- All LLM calls go through the `Provider` trait defined in `core::provider`.
- Adapters for specific providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini) implement this trait.
- The `genai` crate is the default adapter. Direct clients (`anthropic-async`, `async-openai`) are used only when provider-specific features are needed.
- Never hard-code a model name. Always read from config or CLI flags.

## Tool Safety

- Every tool call must pass through `core::approval::ApprovalPolicy` before execution.
- Tools are classified into three tiers: `Allowed`, `Ask`, `Denied`.
- File-write tools must canonicalize paths and verify they are inside the workspace root before writing.
- Bash tools must run inside a PTY via `runtime::pty` with a timeout. Never use raw `std::process::Command` for user-facing execution.

## Streaming

- Provider responses are streamed via `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels.
- The REPL renders partial markdown as tokens arrive.
- Tool-use blocks are buffered until the closing tag is received before execution begins.
- Cancellation (ESC / Ctrl+C) sends a cancel signal through the channel and drops the in-flight request.

## TUI Rendering

- Use `ratatui` widgets for all terminal UI. Never print raw ANSI escape codes directly.
- Markdown rendering uses `pulldown-cmark` for parsing and `syntect` for syntax highlighting.
- Diffs use `similar` for generation and colored output via ratatui styled spans.

## Config Loading

- Config resolution order: compiled defaults -> `~/.nca/config.toml` -> `.nca/config.local.toml` -> env vars -> CLI flags.
- Use `clap` derive macros for CLI argument definitions.
- Config structs live in `common::config` and are shared across all crates.

## Testing

- Unit tests go in the same file as the code under test (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`).
- Integration tests for the CLI go in `crates/cli/tests/`.
- Use `tempfile` for any test that touches the filesystem.
- Use `insta` for snapshot tests of rendered TUI output.
- Never depend on network access in unit tests. Mock the `Provider` trait.
