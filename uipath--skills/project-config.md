description: Strict skill audit/review framework — use when user asks to review, audit, grade, or compare skills, or when reviewing PRs that add or substantially modify a skill
---


Score each skill on six dimensions (1–5 scale, 1 = failing, 3 = acceptable, 5 = excellent):

1. **Structure** — SKILL.md frontmatter valid; `name` matches folder; `description` under 1024 chars, front-loads identity, includes `→` redirects; `[PREVIEW]` tag for unstable skills; body follows Title → When to Use → Critical Rules → Workflow → Reference Navigation → Anti-patterns; references use kebab-case + `-guide.md` / `-template.md` suffix; no orphaned files.
2. **Consistency** — CLI uses `--output json` uniformly; `<UPPER_SNAKE_CASE>` placeholders; heading hierarchy doesn't skip; code blocks have language identifiers; terminology matches other skills.
3. **Logic & Completeness** — workflows cover full lifecycle; error handling specified; edge cases addressed; CLI commands correct; steps in order; validation loops present; anti-patterns section covers real mistakes.
4. **Duplication** — no copy-paste between SKILL.md and references; no redundant reference files; SKILL.md links to references instead of inlining; no instructions repeated verbatim in Critical Rules and workflow.
5. **LLM Usability** — prescriptive not descriptive; numbered Critical Rules; explicit decision trees; copy-paste-ready CLI commands; clear stop conditions; information front-loaded; SKILL.md not excessively long (extract to `references/`).
6. **Marketplace & Integration** — `description` detailed enough to match correctly but not over-broad; `→` redirects for sibling skills; passes `hooks/validate-skill-descriptions.sh`; no hardcoded personal paths; CODEOWNERS entry exists.

Read everything — SKILL.md, every `references/` file, every `assets/` file. Cite file paths and line numbers. Provide exact, actionable fixes. Full rubric: `.claude/rules/skill-review.md`.
