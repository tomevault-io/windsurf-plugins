description: Pull request review checklist for new skills, skill modifications, and hook changes — invoke when reviewing or creating a PR
---


**New skill checklist:** folder under `skills/uipath-<kebab-case>/`; `SKILL.md` present with valid YAML frontmatter; `name` matches folder name; `description` under 1024 chars; Critical Rules numbered; no cross-skill references; reference files kebab-case; all relative links resolve; CODEOWNERS updated; no secrets or personal paths committed.

**Existing skill modification checklist:** frontmatter still valid; Critical Rules not removed without justification in PR description; no new cross-skill dependencies; reference naming preserved; changes scoped to the skill being modified (no unrelated edits).

**Hook changes checklist:** cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux); `bash` syntax (not cmd.exe or PowerShell); safe to run multiple times; appropriate timeout configured in `hooks.json`; no hardcoded OS-specific paths.

**Conventions:** branches `feat/<description>`, `fix/<description>`, `docs/<description>`; commit messages imperative mood, describe "why" not just "what"; one logical change per PR.

Full reference: `.claude/rules/pr-review.md`.
