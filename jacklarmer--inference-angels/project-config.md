# AGENTS.md · for an agent working this mine

You are being asked to claim an Inference Angel. This file tells you everything you need. Read it fully before you start.

**Live on Robinhood Chain.** Contract `0xD982d8F175BD50B976F4Ad90562c9e38200091f9`, chain id 4663. `corpus/v3/deploy.json` holds the addresses.

## What this is

7,777 angels on Robinhood Chain. Each is locked behind one to four puzzles, called trials. Solve them all and you may claim that angel. It is free apart from gas.

**There is no model to download and no setup to perform.** Every answer is a fact of arithmetic, checked by SHA-256. Nothing you write is compared against anything a model produced. Use whatever you already are.

## What you must be able to do

- Run code you write yourself. Most trials need a short script.
- Compute SHA-256 and Keccak-256.
- Decrypt AES-256-CBC.
- Normalise Unicode to NFC and NFD, and know that these differ.
- Handle Base64, Base36, hex, and Roman numerals.
- Search a 6,000 word list.
- Read a 32 by 32 grid of colours out of an SVG.

## Setup

```
npm install
```

That is all. There is nothing else.

## The shape of a puzzle

Read `corpus/v3/public/band-NN.json`. An angel's band is `ceil(tokenId / 101)`.

```json
{
  "tokenId": 7777,
  "band": 77,
  "trials": [
    { "n": 1, "kind": "cipher", "statement": "..." },
    { "n": 2, "kind": "lattice", "sealed": "<base64>", "hint": "..." },
    { "n": 3, "kind": "hidden",  "sealed": "<base64>", "hint": "..." },
    { "n": 4, "kind": "hunt",    "sealed": "<base64>", "hint": "..." }
  ],
  "finalStep": "..."
}
```

Only trial 1 is readable. The rest are sealed.

## Opening a sealed trial

Given your answer to trial `n`, open trial `n+1`:

```js
import { createHash, createDecipheriv } from 'node:crypto';
const sha = s => createHash('sha256').update(s, 'utf8').digest('hex');

function unseal(sealedB64, previousAnswer, tokenId, trialIndex) {
  const key = Buffer.from(sha(previousAnswer), 'hex');
  const iv  = Buffer.from(sha(`${tokenId}|iv|${trialIndex}`), 'hex').subarray(0, 16);
  const d   = createDecipheriv('aes-256-cbc', key, iv);
  return Buffer.concat([d.update(Buffer.from(sealedB64, 'base64')), d.final()]).toString('utf8');
}
```

`trialIndex` counts from 1 for the second trial in the list, matching the index in the `trials` array.

**Always check the result reads as English.** A wrong key usually throws on padding, but roughly one time in 256 it returns nonsense and no error. Do not treat "it decrypted" as "it worked."

## The nine kinds, and how to approach each

| Kind | Approach |
|---|---|
| **chain** | Follow the steps exactly, in order. Watch Unicode normalisation, and watch which steps say NFC and which say NFD. Some puzzles have two or three parts that are worked separately and joined with a vertical bar. |
| **rule** | Six examples of one hidden transformation. Try common ones and compositions of them: Atbash, ROT13, reverse, keep every other character, Base64, keep only letters. Test your guess against all six before you trust it. |
| **hunt** | Hash every word in the published list, or every pair, and compare the leading hex. A one-word hunt is 6,000 tries. Three words is about 2×10¹¹, so write it in a fast loop and be patient. |
| **cipher** | Vigenère, key length given. The plaintext is ordinary English built from a small vocabulary, so frequency analysis works, and so does brute force over the key space. |
| **hidden** | One word sits at a fixed spacing. Try every spacing from 2 to 12 and every starting offset, and check the result against the published word list. More than one reading may look valid, so confirm with the hash. |
| **construct** | You are given an acrostic, the word lengths, and a hash prefix. Filter the word list by first letter and length for each slot, then walk the combinations and test the hash. |
| **relic** | Fetch the named angel's picture and read the squares it names. The picture is a 32 by 32 grid drawn as SVG rectangles at 16 pixels each. Note that a rectangle can cover several squares, so expand runs. Rows count from 0 at the top, columns from 0 at the left. |
| **ottendorf** | Pairs of numbers. The first picks a word in the published list, counting from 1. The second picks a letter inside that word, counting from 1. Read the letters in order. |
| **lattice** | Small enough to brute force. Generate all arrangements, filter by each stated condition, and exactly one survives. |

## The turn some trials take

Several kinds end with a line saying that what you found is not the answer, it is the key. When you see that:

1. Take SHA-256 of what you worked out, exactly as the trial described it.
2. Use those bytes as an AES-256-CBC key.
3. The starting block is the first 16 bytes of the SHA-256 of `<tokenId>|key|<trialIndex>`.
4. What comes out is four ordinary words from the published list, separated by single spaces. Those four words are the trial's answer.

This exists because a grid with 120 arrangements, or a word from a 6,000 word list, is a set small enough to guess without reading the puzzle. The sealed phrase makes the set about 10¹⁵ instead.
