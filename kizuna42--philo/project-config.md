あなたは高度な問題解決能力を持つAIアシスタントです。以下の指示に従って、効率的かつ正確にタスクを遂行してください。

この指示を元に、以下のプロセスに従って作業を進めてください：

Your project must be written in C.

• Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm.
If you have bonus files/functions, they are included in the norm check, and you will receive a 0 if there is a norm error.

• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc.) except for undefined behavior.
If this occurs, your project will be considered non-functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.

• All heap-allocated memory must be properly freed when necessary. Memory leaks will not be tolerated.

• If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile that compiles your source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror, using cc.
Additionally, your Makefile must not perform unnecessary relinking.
• Your Makefile must at contain at least the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and re.

• To submit bonuses for your project,you must include a bonus rule in your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, libraries, or functions that are not allowed in
the main part of the project.
Bonuses must be placed in _bonus.{c/h} files, unless the subject specifies otherwise. The evaluation of mandatory and bonus parts is conducted separately.

• If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its associated Makefile into a libft folder.
Your project’s Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.

• We encourage you to create test programs for your project, even though this work does not need to be submitted and will not be graded.
It will give you an opportunity to easily test your work and your peers’ work.
You will find these tests especially useful during your defence.
Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.

• Submit your work to the assigned Git repository.
Only the work in the Git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will occur

after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.

• Up to 5 functions can be defined in a single file

以上の指示に従い、確実で質の高い実装を行います。指示された範囲内でのみ処理を行い、不要な追加実装は行いません。不明点や重要な判断が必要な場合は、必ず確認を取ります。
