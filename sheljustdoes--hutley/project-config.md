## SEO Strategy

### Primary Keywords to Target
- "moving companies Orlando FL"
- "movers Altamonte Springs FL"
- "local movers Central Florida"
- "long distance movers Florida"
- "corporate relocation Orlando"
- "moving company [city] FL" (x10 location variants)
- "auto transport Florida"
- "storage units moving Florida"

### Technical SEO Checklist
- [ ] Sitemap auto-generated via @astrojs/sitemap
- [ ] Google Search Console — submit sitemap after launch
- [ ] JSON-LD schema: LocalBusiness + MovingCompany type
- [ ] Open Graph tags on every page
- [ ] Canonical URLs on every page
- [ ] Alt text on every image
- [ ] robots.txt in /public
- [ ] 301 redirects from old WordPress URLs (via _redirects or GitHub Pages config)

### Google Business Profile
- Claim/update at business.google.com
- Add all services, photos, hours
- Set up post-job review request email template

## Design Direction

- **NOT** a typical WordPress/template look
- Modern, clean, trustworthy — conveys a family legacy business
- Strong use of whitespace
- Hero section with a bold value proposition
- Warm but professional colour palette (avoid generic blue/white mover clichés)
- Mobile-first — most local search is mobile
- Fast animations (Framer Motion or CSS) but never at expense of performance

## Project Status

## Key Files to Build First

1. `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` — HTML shell, SEO component, header/footer

3. `src/components/Header.astro` — nav with mobile menu
4. `src/components/Footer.astro` — contact info, links, designations
5. `src/pages/index.astro` — homepage
6. `src/pages/get-a-quote.astro` — Formspree quote form

8. `src/data/locations.ts` — location data (city, slug, keywords, description)

## Commands

```bash
# Install (run once)
npm create astro@latest hutley-vansystems -- --template minimal
cd hutley-vansystems
npx astro add tailwind
npx astro add sitemap

# Dev
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Preview build
npm run preview
```

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Add this file as `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## Notes & Decisions Log

- **Melbourne IT** — domain is registered here. Keep domain there or transfer to Cloudflare (free DNS, faster). Just update A/CNAME records to point to GitHub Pages.
- **Formspree** free tier = 50 submissions/month. If quote volume exceeds this, upgrade ($10/mo) or switch to a Cloudflare Worker + Resend for full control.
- **Images** — existing images are at hutleyvansystems.com/wp-content/uploads/ — download and optimise before rebuilding. Use Astro's `<Image />` component for all of them.
- **Blog** — existing blog posts should be migrated as markdown files to `src/content/blog/`
- **Redirects** — old WordPress URLs need 301 redirects to preserve any existing SEO value. Map old slugs to new slugs in a redirects file.
- **Original site developer:** Branmarc Design, Inc. (branmarcdesign.com) — existing assets/branding may be available from them.
