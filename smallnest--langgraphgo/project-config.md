# Agent Guidelines for LangGraphGo

## Build/Lint/Test Commands
- `make build` - Build all packages
- `make test` - Run all tests; for single test: `go test -v ./path/to/pkg -run TestName`
- `make test-race` - Run with race detector
- `make lint` - Run golangci-lint (also run `make fmt`, `make vet` before committing)

## Code Style
- Use `make fmt` to format code with gofmt before committing
- Exported types/functions: PascalCase; private: camelCase
- Define errors as package-level variables: `var (ErrX = errors.New("..."))`
- Write godoc comments for all exported identifiers
- Tests: Use table-driven tests with `t.Run()`, `t.Parallel()` where appropriate
- Always check errors (linted by golangci-lint)
- Run `make check` (fmt-check, vet, lint) and `make test` before committing
