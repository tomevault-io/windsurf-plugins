## Service Layer Conventions

- Services encapsulate business logic between routers and repositories.
- Services receive a `Session` from the router (via `Depends(get_db)`).
- Heavy operations: use the Redis run queue (don't block the request).
- External calls (Supabase Edge Functions, Nango, S3): always use `httpx.AsyncClient` with timeouts.
- Secrets: encrypted with Fernet before storage, decrypted on read via `ada_backend/utils/encryption.py`.
- Prefer UUID-typed identifiers in service-facing schemas and payload models; only stringify UUIDs at API/JSON boundaries.
- Prefer typed schemas/models for service return payloads; avoid untyped `dict` returns when a stable shape exists.
- See `ada_backend/docs/` for domain-specific documentation.
