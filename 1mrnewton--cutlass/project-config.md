# Git Workflow

## Incremental commits

- **Always commit work incrementally.** Commit each logically complete unit (a fix, a feature slice, a refactor step) as soon as it compiles and makes sense on its own — don't accumulate one giant commit at the end of a task.
- Each commit should be small, focused, and have a clear message describing *why* the change was made. Follow the repo's existing commit message style.

## Post-commit checks

After **every** commit, run:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
```

- If `fmt` reports diffs, run `cargo fmt --all`.
- If clippy reports **new** warnings or errors introduced by the work, fix them.
- Commit those fixes as a follow-up commit (e.g. `fix clippy warnings in preview worker`). Do not amend already-created commits unless explicitly asked.
- Pre-existing warnings unrelated to the current change may be left alone — do not go on cleanup sprees.

## Push, tags, and releases — user command only

- **NEVER `git push`** (any remote, any branch) unless the user explicitly asks in the current conversation. "Commit" does not imply "push".
- **NEVER create, move, or delete tags** and **never cut releases** (GitHub releases, version bumps intended for release, publishing) on your own initiative. These happen only on an explicit user command.
- When the user **does** ask to cut / publish a public desktop alpha, follow
  [`.agents/skills/cutlass-release/SKILL.md`](../../.agents/skills/cutlass-release/SKILL.md)
  and [`.cursor/rules/release.mdc`](release.mdc) (PR → green CI → merge `main`
  → tag `main` → `release.yml`). Do not improvise a shorter path.
- Never use destructive git operations (`push --force`, `reset --hard`, history rewrites, tag deletion) unless the user explicitly requests them.
- When a task is finished and committed, simply report what was committed; do not ask "should I push?" — the user will say so when they want it.
