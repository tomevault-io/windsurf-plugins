# Rust — clean code

## ⚠️ BEFORE WRITING CODE — ALWAYS ASK:
- Is this KISS? (simple and readable over clever)
- Does this follow SOLID principles?
- Is this file too large? (> 400 lines = refactor candidate)

## Functions
- One clear responsibility; if the name needs "and", consider splitting
- Prefer early returns over deep nesting
- Small enough to understand at a glance

## Modules
- Smallest reasonable public API (`pub use` only where it helps)
- Hide internals in private submodules
- **File size: < 400 lines** — if larger, consider splitting

## Errors
- Explicit error types (`thiserror`, failure enums)
- Avoid generic `String` for control flow
- Do not silence failures with `unwrap`/`expect` in production code except documented invariants or tests

## Naming
- Follow Rust conventions (`snake_case`, `UpperCamelCase`)
- Names should express domain intent, not only type (`retain_count` over `n`)

## Comments
- Only where "why" is non-obvious
- "What" should read from the code

## Duplication
- Extract when two paths share business rules
- Do not duplicate blocks across adapters

## Tests
- Names describe behavior
- Assertions use messages or types that fail with useful context
