# Portal Solutions Agent Skills Registry

This repository is a shared registry of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification). Each subdirectory containing a `SKILL.md` file is an installable skill.

## What You Can Do Here

- **Discover skills**: Browse subdirectories or check `registry.json` for the full index
- **Load a skill**: Read the `SKILL.md` in the relevant subdirectory — it contains full instructions
- **Invoke a skill**: Use `/skill:<name>` if your harness supports slash commands
- **Add a skill**: Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` — create a directory, add `SKILL.md`, run `scripts/sync-registry.sh`

## Skill Index

See `registry.json` for a machine-readable list of all skills with names and descriptions.
