# phpfmt (PHP formatter)

## Purpose

- **Sublime Text 4 package** that formats PHP code by invoking a PHP-based formatting engine.
- The engine is a pipeline of **passes** (transformations) applied over PHP tokens.
- Includes a fixture-based test harness (`.in`/`.out`) and a PHPUnit test suite.

## Repository layout

- `fmt.stub.php`
  - Main formatter implementation (pass classes, `CodeFormatter`, helpers).
  - Also acts as the PHP CLI script that Sublime Text calls (it prints a usage message when run without the expected args).
  - The fixture test harness loads this file and instantiates `CodeFormatter` directly.
- `phpfmt.py`
  - **Sublime Text plugin entrypoint** (`sublime_plugin`) that:
    - Reads `phpfmt.sublime-settings`.
    - Builds a PHP command line.
    - Executes PHP against `fmt.stub.php` with the configured options.
  - When documenting “how the editor integration works”, this is the key file.
- `php.tools.ini`
  - Default configuration file passed to the PHP formatter from the Sublime plugin.
- `phpfmt.sublime-settings`
  - Sublime package settings (php binary path, passes, excludes, PSR/WP toggles, etc.).
- `tests/`
  - `run_all_tests.php`: fixture test harness.
  - `Original/`: non-PSR fixtures.
  - `PSR/`: PSR-style fixtures (PSR decorator applied by the harness).
  - `Unit/`: PHPUnit unit tests (if present/used).
- `vendor/`
  - Composer dependencies, including PHPUnit.

## Running tests

## PHP version compatibility

- Treat **PHP 5.6** as the minimum supported runtime for any code changes in this repo.
- New formatter logic should avoid syntax/features newer than PHP 5.6 (e.g. scalar type hints, return types, null coalescing `??`, spaceship `<=>`, arrow functions, etc.).
- Some fixtures and passes are intentionally **version-gated** (e.g. PHP 8 attributes, `match`, etc.) and will be skipped when running under older runtimes.

### 1) Fixture tests (`.in`/`.out`)

- Run the full fixture suite:
  - From `tests/`: `php ./run_all_tests.php`

- If you don’t have PHP 5.6 locally, validate compatibility by running with PHP 7.4:
  - `php74 tests/run_all_tests.php`
  - If your system uses `php7.4` instead: `php7.4 tests/run_all_tests.php`
- Run a subset by test number prefix:
  - `php ./run_all_tests.php --testNumber 525`
- Show diffs (verbose):
  - `php ./run_all_tests.php -v`
  - `php ./run_all_tests.php --testNumber 525 -v`

### Harness notes

- The harness supports a few special `//...` comments inside `.in` fixtures (parsed via `token_get_all()` in `tests/run_all_tests.php`).

- `//passes:PassA,PassB,...`
  - Forces a specific list of passes for that test.
  - Example: `//passes:AutoSemicolon`
  - `Default` is a special value: `//passes:Default` enables a default set plus PSR decoration.
  - Pass parameters are supported via `PassName|argument`.

- `//excludes:PassA,PassB,...`
  - Disables specific passes for that test.

- `//version:X.Y.Z`
  - Skips the test when the running PHP version is **lower** than `X.Y.Z`.

- `//versionup:X.Y.Z`
  - Skips the test when the running PHP version is **higher** than `X.Y.Z`.

- **Version-gated fixtures**
  - For syntax added after PHP 5.6 (e.g., arrow functions, attributes), add a `//version:X.Y.Z` line at the top of the `.in`/`.out` to avoid failures on older runtimes.

- `//skipShortTag`
  - If `short_open_tag` is disabled in the current runtime and the fixture contains `//skipShortTag` in inline HTML, the test is skipped.

- If there is **no** `//passes:...` or `//excludes:...`, the harness applies a baseline set and calls `PsrDecorator::decorate($fmt)`.

- Some tests may be skipped depending on PHP version or `short_open_tag` settings (see the logic in `tests/run_all_tests.php`).

- **Alignment note**
  - `AlignDoubleArrow` can align `=>` even inside arrow functions when they appear on the same line; update `.out` expectations accordingly.

### 2) PHPUnit

- Run from the repository root:
  - `./vendor/bin/phpunit`

- Under PHP 7.4 (if available):
  - `php74 ./vendor/bin/phpunit`

Notes:
- The **fixture harness** (`tests/run_all_tests.php`) is the primary “hard gate” for formatter behavior and should stay at `Broken:0`.
- Under older runtimes (e.g. PHP 7.4), PHPUnit may report many **Skipped** tests due to runtime/dependency constraints; this is expected.
- Prefer running PHPUnit with the default `php` (newer runtime) for full coverage, and use `php74 tests/run_all_tests.php` as the compatibility proxy.
### 3) Docker matrix (multi-PHP testing)

Run tests across multiple PHP versions (5.6 → 8.5) in Docker containers:

```bash
# Run all versions (default: 5.6 7.0 7.1 7.2 7.3 7.4 8.0 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.5)
./tests/docker-test-matrix.sh

# Run specific versions
PHP_VERSIONS="5.6 7.4 8.2" ./tests/docker-test-matrix.sh

# Disable PHPUnit (only run fixture tests)
RUN_PHPUNIT=0 ./tests/docker-test-matrix.sh
```

Scripts:
- `tests/docker-test-matrix.sh` — Wrapper that iterates PHP versions and runs Docker containers.
- `tests/docker-test-matrix-inner.sh` — Runs inside each container: executes `run_all_tests.php` and PHPUnit.

Behavior:
- Stops at the first failing PHP version (fail-fast).
- PHP 5.6 uses `phpunit-5.7.phar` directly (avoids Debian EOL apt issues).
