# Repository Instructions

- Inspect the existing architecture and relevant code before implementation.
- Read and follow applicable local skills under `.codex/skills/` when available. The repository must remain usable when they are absent.
- For planning, implementing or reviewing sample, agent/tool or dashboard work, read `.codex/skills/RuniqFramework/SKILL.md` when present. Verify existing host configuration before creating frontend or framework PBIs; a small sample need not be split by technical layer.
- Preserve project dependency direction and extend existing abstractions instead of creating parallel implementations.
- Keep public API changes minimal and intentional. Add complete English XML documentation for every new public member.
- Do not change unrelated behavior or files, and do not add production compatibility layers solely to preserve obsolete tests.
- Add an English explanatory comment immediately above every new test method.
- Follow the repository's established build, test, documentation, and completion standards. Report actual validation results; never fabricate or force historical test counts.
- Do not commit, push, merge, create a pull request, publish packages, create releases, deploy, or modify remote state unless the user explicitly asks.
- Return completion reports in Turkish unless the task explicitly requests another language.
