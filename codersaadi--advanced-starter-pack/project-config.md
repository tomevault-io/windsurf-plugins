# Cursor Rules for Code Generation

# General Best Practices

- Ensure code adheres to consistent formatting and style guidelines (e.g., based on Prettier/ESLint/Biome configurations).
- Prioritize readability and maintainability.
- Add comprehensive comments for complex logic or non-obvious implementations.
- Write modular and reusable code.

# Type Safety

- Always use explicit types for function arguments, return values, and variables in TypeScript.
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary and provide a clear justification.
- Leverage TypeScript utility types and advanced features to improve type accuracy.
- Ensure all new code is type-checked and passes TypeScript compilation without errors.

# Modern Development Principles

- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.
- Use arrow functions (`=>`) instead of traditional function expressions where appropriate.
- Utilize modern JavaScript features (e.g., async/await, destructuring, spread/rest operators) for cleaner code.
- Follow functional programming paradigms where they lead to more concise and testable code.
- Implement proper error handling and logging.

# Avoiding Deprecated Packages and Practices

- Do not use deprecated npm packages or library functions. Prioritize actively maintained alternatives.
- Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies regularly.
- Avoid outdated design patterns or architectural choices. Favor modern, scalable solutions.
- Ensure all generated code is compatible with the latest stable versions of relevant frameworks and libraries.

# Specific JavaScript/TypeScript Practices

- Do not use `Array.prototype.forEach()`. Instead, prefer `for...of` loops for iteration.
- Avoid using TypeScript `enum`s. Instead, use helper functions for enum-like behavior or union types.
- Enums are strictly forbidden near database interactions as they can restrict flexibility and schema evolution.
