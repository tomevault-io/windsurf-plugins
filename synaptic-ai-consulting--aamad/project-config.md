description: Core, framework-agnostic rules and contracts for AAMAD; applies to all personas, tasks, and artifacts across the repository.
---


## Purpose
- Define universal principles, contracts, and invariants for AI-assisted, multi-agent development, independent of any specific execution framework.

## Principles
- **Single responsibility personas:** each persona owns a defined epic with explicit inputs, outputs, and prohibited actions.
- **Context-first engineering:** all outputs must trace to PRD, SAD, SFS, or user stories; do not invent requirements.
- **Reproducibility and provenance:** every artifact includes Sources, Assumptions, and Open Questions sections.
- **Deterministic execution:** actions are idempotent; perform temp-write-then-atomic-replace for file outputs.
- **Minimal viable architecture first:** implement MVP scope before expanding; document deferrals with rationale.

## Agent Contract
- Personas declare: id, role, instructions, actions, inputs, outputs, prohibited-actions. Agents MUST read only declared inputs and write only to declared outputs.
- On missing/ambiguous inputs, write Assumptions and Open Questions; do not fabricate content.
- All actions must append an Audit block with timestamp, persona id, and action name to the artifact.

## Task Contract
- Each task defines: description, expected_output (exact target file path and required headings), acceptance_criteria, traceability to PRD/SAD/SFS anchors.
- Tasks include a self-check verifying required headings; if missing, write Diagnostic and halt.

## Tooling Rules
- Use only approved file and validation tools provided by the active runtime adapter for the generated application; no direct shell or network unless explicitly authorized by persona.
- Log tool usage in the artifact, including model, temperature, max_tokens, and any material runtime controls impacting determinism.

## State and Output
- Outputs follow template headings exactly (.cursor/templates). Do not wrap machine-parsed blocks in code fences if templates require raw content.
- Artifacts end with sections: Sources, Assumptions, Open Questions, Audit.
- Prompt Trace must be captured for high-risk or production-facing outputs; if omitted, the Audit must state why.

## Adapter Abstraction
- AAMAD's IDE-time crew workflow is adapter-neutral. Personas and phase sequencing are governed by rules and persona contracts, not by runtime adapters.
- The active runtime adapter (selected via `AAMAD_TARGET_RUNTIME`) defines conventions for the generated multi-agent application in Phase 2: runtime setup, agent declaration style, tool/MCP binding, observability, and execution controls.
- Runtime adapters do not orchestrate AAMAD's own phases; they constrain how the implementation personas scaffold and validate the target runtime.

## Failure Policy
- On iteration/time limits or missing prerequisites, write a Halt and Report section with blockers; do not continue.

## Security and Compliance
- Never embed secrets in artifacts; use environment variables in runtime code only. Record third-party content in NOTICES as needed
- Provide `.env.example` entries for required runtime secrets and keep secret values out of Prompt Trace and diagnostics.
