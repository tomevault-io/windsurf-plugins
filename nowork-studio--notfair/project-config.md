# NotFair — Skill Resolver for AI Agents

**This file is the universal entry point.** Any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Cursor, etc.) reads this to know which NotFair skill to run for which user intent.

If you are an agent and a user mentions Google Ads, Meta Ads, SEO, GEO, or anything in the tables below, route to the named skill.

---

## How to use this file

1. **Match the user's intent** against the rows below.
2. **Read the named skill's `SKILL.md`** from the path shown.
3. **Follow the procedure** in that SKILL.md exactly.

Skills under `seo/`, `google-ads/`, `meta-ads/`, `gemini/`, and `notfair-upgrade-skill/` are **host-agnostic** — they work the same on every supported agent host.

## Cross-model review

## Plugin maintenance

| Intent | Skill | Path |
|---|---|---|

## External dependencies

- **Google Search Console** — required for all SEO skills that read live data.
- **Google Ads (NotFair MCP)** — `https://notfair.co/api/mcp/google_ads`, OAuth. Required for Google Ads skills.
- **Meta Marketing API (NotFair MCP)** — required for Meta Ads skills.
- **Google Gemini API key** — required for `gemini`.

Skills check for missing credentials at startup and walk the user through setup. Do not invent credentials or skip skills silently — surface the gap.

## Conventions for installers (managed-block fences)

Any installer that writes into a file the user also edits (e.g., a user's workspace `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or host config) MUST wrap its inserted content in a fence:

```
<!-- notfair:managed -->
... auto-generated rows ...
<!-- /notfair:managed -->
```

Re-running the installer rewrites only inside the fence. Anything outside is preserved.

## Bookkeeping

When a new skill is added or removed in this repo, update:

1. The relevant table above in this file.
2. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `skills` array.
3. `VERSION`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (version bump).
4. `CHANGELOG.md` (user-facing note).

A skill that exists on disk but is missing from this file or `plugin.json` is invisible to agents.
