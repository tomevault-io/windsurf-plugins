# Copilot Instructions for `playlist_manager`

- For repo-specific work in this project, prefer the `Playlist Sync Builder` custom agent.
- Treat `NAVIDROME_MUSIC_ROOT` as the single shared music/download root; do **not** reintroduce `DEEZER_DOWNLOAD_DIR`.
- In Docker/Compose, the user supplies host paths via `NAVIDROME_MUSIC_ROOT` and `NAVIDROME_PLAYLIST_DIR`, but the app should use the stable in-container paths `/navidrome/root` and `/navidrome/playlist`.
- Live sync is intentionally sequential and review-first: if any Deezer match is low-confidence, pause Navidrome playlist export until the user resolves it in the web UI.
- The low-confidence review flow should pre-run SoundCloud searches for each low-confidence track before showing the final choice list, with a simple loading dialog/status message so the user knows searches are running.
- The low-confidence review screen should offer bulk actions to accept all remaining tracks as missing or try SoundCloud across all remaining low-confidence tracks; high-confidence SoundCloud matches should auto-resolve, while the remaining tracks should show inline Deezer and SoundCloud choices for the user to pick from.
- Deezer remains the primary authenticated provider. SoundCloud is a manual-review-only option, handled through `yt-dlp` with `SOUNDCLOUD_FALLBACK_ENABLED` and `SOUNDCLOUD_MATCH_THRESHOLD`; do not auto-download it during the normal Deezer sync pass or invent provider APIs/endpoints/flags.
- On Windows, prefer `uv run python -m flask` or the repo `start.ps1` script; the app is expected to bind to port `3000`.
- You may start the app or related local services for testing, but **do not leave them running after testing is complete**.
- Before finishing a task, stop any server process you launched, clean up any stale `.app.lock` file if needed, and avoid leaving port `3000` occupied by the repo app.
- Use fresh verification evidence from commands like `uv run python -m pytest`, `uv run python -m ruff check .`, or a live HTTP check before claiming completion.
