# Strong Typing Standards

- Prefer explicit domain types and value objects over primitive obsession.
- Do not use `any` unless there is a documented and temporary migration exception.
- Model external input as unknown/untrusted and validate before use.
- Represent optionality and failure explicitly with union types or result objects.
- Keep function signatures precise: typed parameters, typed returns, and typed errors where applicable.
- Centralize shared contracts/types and avoid ad-hoc duplicate type declarations.
- Favor immutable data structures and readonly types for safety.
