# Contributing

Several agents push to `origin/master` continuously. Keep each change small,
verified and easy to rebase. `docs/matching.md` covers byte matching,
`docs/structural.md` manual RE. Prose trimmed from these docs lives in git
history, one `git show` away.

## Work selection

An explicit request or assigned lane overrides the queue:

1. `git pull --rebase origin master`
2. `python3 tools/check_csv.py` — repair ledger errors before other work
3. `python3 tools/list_naked_candidates.py Code` serves a byte-true dump from
   `Code/gen_asm/`, boundary already proven. **Converting dumps to real C++ is
   the default work.**
4. `python3 tools/next_work.py` for identity/structural work; it explains its
   own tiers.
5. `python3 tools/place_bodies.py <sources>` mines the units the ledger already
   compiles. A TU emits far more than the one function it was written to land,
   and the rest was invisible only because the export table had no address for
   it; the tool finds those addresses by masked byte search and reads each
   placed body's call sites for its callees. Re-run it after every wave — each
   pin unblocks the next body — and prune what `./build.sh` refuses to a
   fixpoint, recording the refusal in `reverse/place_denylist.txt`.

A tier reporting zero candidates is exhausted, not broken. Regenerate with
`tools/drift_classify.py`, `tools/anchor_unclaimed.py`, `./build.sh`.

Finish or revert each body before the next.

## Work the file, not the row

`next_work.py` lists every other queued candidate in the same source file.
**That file is your unit of work** — drain it first. Measured land rate: 19.5%
solo, 46.5% with ten or more siblings landed together, because the layout,
offsets and callee pins from the first body are what the next one needs. A
shared header edit costs a full gate: edit every dependent body, pay once.

## Convert, verify, commit, push — per body

1. Make the smallest source and ledger change for one function.
2. `./build.sh <file-or-symbol>`. If a command returns a process or session ID,
   poll it; never launch a duplicate build.
3. Stage explicit paths only: `git add <specific-paths>`, never `git add .`.
   Check every new ledger source is tracked.
4. Commit normally. **Never bypass hooks.**
5. `git pull --rebase origin master`, `git push`, then pull --rebase again. On
   rejection: rebase, recheck the ledger, retry, final pull.

Header, vendored-reference and shared-shim edits — and a resolved merge —
trigger the full gate in the hook; poll it, don't relaunch, and never filter a
gate through a pipeline that hides its exit code.

Before pushing, `python3 tools/progress.py origin/master` prints what your
session added. `+0.00 pp` is the common outcome — do not stop there; take
another body from the file you were served, and if it is exhausted say so with
the figure and reason.

## Anti-lift policy

Clean C++ is preferred; MASM or inline asm only for a proven codegen blocker
(compiler machinery, x87 shape, SEH). Lifting a dump into a
`__declspec(naked)`/`__emit` .cpp is **not** a conversion: it byte-matches by
construction, scores +0, and deletes the body the next converter needed. The
naked body must be **gone**, replaced by real C++. `tools/conversion_gate.py`
enforces this in both hooks, and the push hook scans your whole outgoing range
— a blocked push may name a historical lift, not yours. Never `--no-verify`.

Ghidra boundaries, xrefs and vtables are identity evidence; decompiled C is
not byte-match proof. After several failed shapes or ~30 minutes without byte
progress take a fresh candidate, never leaving a nonmatching reconstruction in
`Code/`. Record the verdict:
`python3 tools/re_log.py record <symbol> <rva> <size> <status> <evidence>`
(never hand-edit `reverse/re_attempts.log`); cite the real boundary and
include `t=<minutes>` and your model.

**Close, not exact? Bank the body.**
`partial '<what is wrong>' --stash <your .cpp> --score <0..1>` keeps the
candidate servable and starts the next agent from your body, not cold. Both
flags are required: over 95 rows, a `partial` describing the near miss without
banking it landed 5.1% against 7.5% for silence. No body, no `partial` —
record `blocked`.

## Placement and integrity

- Game source under `Code/`; MASM dumps in `Code/masm_dumps/`; scratch
  untracked under `build/`. Banked attempts (`reverse/attempts/<rva>.cpp`) are
  evidence, never progress: nothing compiles them, `add_match` deletes one on
  landing, `check_csv` flags leftovers.
- Prefer TU-scoped shims over shared-header edits.
- Progress = `matched` `reverse/functions.csv` rows backed by real source and
  byte verification. Markers and prose are not.
- **Landing a `reverse/symbols.csv` pin?** It is an ADDITIVE candidate list:
  the resolver keeps the first pinned address that reproduces retail, so a pin
  naming the *wrong* function still byte-matches and a green gate proves
  nothing about it. Run `tools/pin_consistency.py --symbol <name>` before you
  pin and `--check` after. `reverse/pin_consistency_baseline.csv` is the
  known-bad backlog and may only shrink — never add a line to get green. A
  harvested pin is a candidate, not an address: resolve the thunk and check it
