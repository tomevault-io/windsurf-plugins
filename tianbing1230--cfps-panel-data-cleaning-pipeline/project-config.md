# Agent guide: CFPS panel cleaning pipeline

Orientation for any coding agent (or human) working on this repository. Read this
before editing a `.do` file, then open the task guide under `docs/agent-guide/`
that matches what you are doing.

This repo harmonizes CFPS (China Family Panel Studies / 中国家庭追踪调查)
individual-level data from six waves — 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020 — into
one long-format panel, `cfps_ind.dta`, keyed by `pid` and `wave`.

The code is hand-written Stata with strong internal conventions and no test
suite. Nothing validates that an edit is correct — a variable that violates the
naming convention is dropped silently rather than flagged, so "it ran without
error" proves very little here.

## Layout and execution order

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `00_run.do` (project root) | Entrypoint: checks working directory, checks dependencies, runs everything in order |
| `scripts/01_config.example.do` | Template → copy to `scripts/config.do` (gitignored) |
| `scripts/config.do` | Local paths: `$data_raw`, `$data_gen` |
| `scripts/02_paths_globals.do` | **Every** raw file path (`$f_raw_*`) and output path (`$f_out_*`) |
| `scripts/11_CFPS_Panel_Ind10.do` | Wave 2010 |
| `scripts/12_CFPS_Panel_Ind11.do` | Wave 2011 — **not run** by `00_run.do` (2011 is not a core wave) |
| `scripts/13`…`17_CFPS_Panel_Ind{12,14,16,18,20}.do` | Waves 2012–2020 |
| `scripts/20_CFPS_Panel_Individual_Crosswave.do` | Parent/spouse linkage, cross-wave backfill, append to panel, cognitive interpolation |
| `scripts/30_CFPS_Panel_Individual_Labels.do` | Chinese + English variable and value labels, final save |
| `ado/local/` | `csco2isco_cfps`, `csco2isei_cfps` (shipped) |
| `ado/third_party/` | gitignored; drop your own `iskoisei.ado` etc. here |
| `data_dictionary/01_individual.csv` | Codebook, 6 columns, sectioned by `Part` |

**Wave scripts must run in order.** Every script from `13_` onward merges the
generated `cfps{YY}_ind.dta` files of *earlier* waves, and `17_` (2020) merges all
five. You cannot run a later wave standalone against an empty `$data_gen`.

## The three conventions everything depends on

**1. The `a_` staging prefix.** Inside a wave script every harmonized variable is
built as `a_<name>`. The block at the end of each questionnaire section does:

```stata
keep a_*
rename a_* *_10
rename pid_10 pid
```

So a variable you create without the `a_` prefix is dropped by `keep a_*` without
any error. This is by far the most common way an edit to this repo fails — the
script runs clean and the variable simply isn't in the output.

**2. The `_YY` wave suffix.** After staging, variables carry a two-digit wave
suffix (`edu_10`, `edu_20`). `20_` strips it before appending the waves together,
so the final panel has bare names plus a `wave` column.

**3. Child questionnaire first, adult appended onto it.** Each wave script
processes the child (or childproxy) file, saves `cfps{YY}_ind.dta`, then processes
the adult (or person) file and ends with `append using` that same file. A variable
that only exists in the adult questionnaire is therefore missing for child
records. That is expected, not a bug.

One more thing that trips up automated edits: **the `Part` section numbering is
not consistent across waves.** In `11_` (2010), `Part8` is Health and `Part10` is
Political Experience; in `13_`–`17_`, `Part8` is Political Experience and there is
no Health section. Place new code in the section that actually exists in the file
you are editing.

## Running it

```stata
cd "/path/to/CFPS-Panel-Data-Cleaning-Pipeline"
do "00_run.do"
```

Four things must be in place first: the raw CFPS data arranged by wave (the repo
ships none — it is licensed and cannot be redistributed), `scripts/config.do`
copied from the example and pointed at your paths, the `isko` and `iscogen`
packages installed from SSC, and the stray `B` deleted from the SSC copy of
`iskoisei.ado`.

`00_run.do` stops at the first failure with a distinct exit code (601 config or
working directory, 604 missing ado, 605 broken `iskoisei`, 610–617 individual
scripts), so the exit code alone identifies the stage.

## Verifying a change

There is no test suite, so verification is manual and you should always do it.
To re-run a single stage without the rest of the pipeline:

```stata
cd "/path/to/CFPS-Panel-Data-Cleaning-Pipeline"
do "scripts/config.do"
do "scripts/02_paths_globals.do"
adopath ++ "ado/local"
adopath ++ "ado/third_party"
do "scripts/17_CFPS_Panel_Ind20.do"     // requires waves 10-18 already generated
```

Then confirm the variable survived, with its wave suffix:

```stata
use "$data_gen/cfps20_ind.dta", clear
describe newvar_20
count if newvar_20 < 0        // should be 0: raw CFPS negatives must become .
```

After a full run, this is the check that catches a wave you missed:

```stata
use "$data_gen/cfps_ind.dta", clear
bysort wave: count if !missing(newvar)   // a wave with 0 is a red flag
```

Raw CFPS encodes missingness as negative values (`-1` through `-10`). Every
harmonized variable must convert these to Stata missing, via `if rawvar > 0` (or
`>= 0` when zero is meaningful), `mvdecode …, mv(-10/-1)`, or
`recode … (-10/-1=.)`. Follow whichever idiom the surrounding lines use.
