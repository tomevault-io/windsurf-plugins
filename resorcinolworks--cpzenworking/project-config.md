# This file contains rules for the Cursor AI assistant to follow for this project.

# General
- When making changes, adhere to the existing code style and conventions.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Add comments only for complex logic that isn't self-explanatory.

# Frontend (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- The frontend is located in the `cpzenfrontend` directory.
- Use components from the `shadcn/ui` library located in `cpzenfrontend/src/components/ui` for new UI elements to maintain consistency.
- Icons should be imported from `lucide-react`.
- State management should be handled with React Context API where appropriate, see `cpzenfrontend/src/context/ProgressContext.tsx` for an example.
- All API calls to the backend should be centralized in `cpzenfrontend/src/lib/api.ts`.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Avoid writing plain CSS files.
- Follow the component structure seen in `cpzenfrontend/src/components`.

# Backend (Node.js, Express, TypeScript)
- The backend is located in the `cpzenbackend` directory.
- Follow the existing project structure:
  - `src/controllers`: API route handlers.
  - `src/services`: Business logic.
  - `src/models`: Database-related logic and types.
  - `src/routes`: Express route definitions.
  - `src/middleware`: Express middleware.
- Database interactions are with a PostgreSQL database. SQL queries can be found in `database.sql` and models.
- Authentication is handled by Clerk. Use the Clerk SDK for any auth-related tasks. See `cpzenbackend/src/middleware/auth.ts` for an example of protected routes.
- Webhooks from Clerk are handled in `cpzenbackend/src/controllers/WebhookController.ts`.

# Commits & PRs
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- When submitting a pull request, provide a clear description of the changes.
