# CellMotion development rules

These rules apply to the whole repository and are intended for both human contributors and coding agents.

## Before building a reference-video effect

1. Read [`docs/REFERENCE_VIDEO_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/REFERENCE_VIDEO_WORKFLOW.md) completely.
2. Inspect the video with `ffprobe` and FFmpeg-assisted frame extraction before writing animation code. Do not conclude FFmpeg is unavailable only because it is missing from `PATH`; check bundled workspace runtimes and known dependency directories first.
3. Record the observed phases, timestamps, geometry, easing, visibility changes, and uncertain details in a short analysis note. Use [`docs/analyses/TEMPLATE.md`](docs/analyses/TEMPLATE.md).
4. Treat normal-speed footage as the source of rhythm and slow-motion footage as evidence for ordering, paths, and overlap.
5. Use Watch + FFmpeg + the existing Canvas/SVG/CSS/GSAP runtime by default. Do **not** load `oil-motion` merely because a reference video exists; use it only for generated/pre-rendered semantic motion such as realistic material deformation, articulated bodies, changing topology/occlusion, or a user-requested video/atlas pipeline. The exact boundary is in [`.codex/skills/build-font-animation-effects/references/video-analysis-workflow.md`](.codex/skills/build-font-animation-effects/references/video-analysis-workflow.md).
6. Before refining a disputed motion detail, lock the observable motion contract and freeze already approved phases. Use the regression protocol in the same reference instead of stacking offsets or rewriting unrelated choreography.

## UI and rendering baseline

- The current product baseline is **CellMotion**, not ME Motion Studio or the old STG panel.
- The approved editor standard is the current Type Cascade three-column editor. Read [`.codex/skills/build-font-animation-effects/references/cellmotion-editor-standard.md`](.codex/skills/build-font-animation-effects/references/cellmotion-editor-standard.md) and [`.codex/skills/build-font-animation-effects/references/timeline-color-contract.md`](.codex/skills/build-font-animation-effects/references/timeline-color-contract.md) before creating or migrating an editor. Standardize the shell, visual language, interaction, timeline, and export surfaces; preserve each effect's own composition model and allow its `动效设置` panel to contain the controls it genuinely needs. The timeline rule is global: use effect-specific labels and multiple semantic chromatic blocks; neutral gray is not an enabled phase color, fluorescent lime is only one palette member, and no effect may be specified as “following” another effect's timeline.
- Reuse the shared editor layers where possible: `site/workspace-editor.css`, `site/media-layer.js`, `site/media-layer.css`, `site/me-motion-editor.css`, and `site/me-motion-editor.js`.
- Desktop editors use the approved three-column structure: left content/page navigation, center stage and timeline, and right properties. Mobile uses the stage above compact navigation and properties.
- Calculate preview geometry from the actual stage or canvas client size, never blindly from `window.innerWidth`. Text and compositions must stay centered in the stage after the editor width is excluded.
- Working columns must scroll independently and expose every control without turning ordinary editing into a long page scroll.
- New effects should support Chinese text and the repository font library where applicable.

## Expected editing and export capability

- Expose timing controls for visually meaningful phases, not a long list of unexplained low-level values.
- Preserve editable direction, speed, spacing, size, alignment, colors, and hold durations when those concepts exist in the reference.
- When images or icons participate in the animation, reuse the shared media/resource model instead of creating a second incompatible uploader.
- Provide PNG, GIF, and video export when the effect uses the modern canvas export stack. GIF/video duration and output size must be selectable.
- Verify export rendering from output dimensions, not the browser viewport.
- When an effect exposes “用于 AI”, follow [`.codex/skills/build-font-animation-effects/references/ai-component-manifest.md`](.codex/skills/build-font-animation-effects/references/ai-component-manifest.md): generate the Manifest from current editor state and reuse the authoritative renderer through the shared player bridge.

## Git scope

- Start a dedicated branch for each new effect or focused refinement.
- Do not overwrite unrelated work from another contributor.
- Commit only the new effect, its shared changes, gallery/navigation entries, preview image, documentation, and tests needed for that effect.
- Before merging, compare against the latest `origin/main`, resolve shared gallery/navigation changes deliberately, and test the combined result.
