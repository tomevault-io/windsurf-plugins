## 1. Vision: Two Products, One Foundation

### Product 1: Credit Catalyst Monitoring System (Institutional Grade)
**Purpose:** Pitch to hedge funds as a monitoring/alpha generation tool
**Execution:** Manual — system generates ideas, humans trade
**Timeframe:** Medium-term (weeks to months)
**Target:** External clients (hedge funds, asset managers)

### Product 2: Autonomous Trading Agent (Personal)
**Purpose:** Trade your own capital, fully automated
**Execution:** Autonomous — agent trades on your behalf
**Timeframe:** Shorter-term (days to weeks)
**Target:** Your personal account
**Key Feature:** Becomes aggressive when it detects edge

### Shared Foundation
Both products share:
- The Watcher (data collection)
- The Analyst (credit scoring)
- The Scanner (options analysis)
- Knowledge base (19 books + credit docs)
- Company database (202 names)

### Development Path
1. ~~Build shared foundation~~ ✅ COMPLETE
2. ~~Build Product 2 (autonomous agent) for personal trading~~ ✅ COMPLETE
3. **Trade your own capital for 12-24 months — NOW LIVE**
4. Document track record
5. Use results to pitch Product 1 to institutions

## 2. Core Philosophy

> "Human psychology leaves alpha. My agent will understand psychology and have the autonomy to put trades on under certain guidelines. I want it to become aggressive when it feels it has an edge — THAT IS THE KEY."

### What This Means
- Markets misprice because humans are emotional, slow, and biased
- Credit signals emerge before equity reprices — the lag is the opportunity
- The agent must understand WHY humans misprice, not just THAT they do
- When multiple signals align (credit + psychology + options), the agent sizes up aggressively
- The agent earns the right to be aggressive through conviction, not randomness

---

## 3. The Investment Thesis

### The Macro Setup (2021-2028 Credit Cycle)
- 2021 "free money" era created a wave of covenant-lite HY issuance
- Loan docs were written to favour sponsors/equity, not bondholders
- Many companies (especially European HY) issued when money was cheap with loose documentation
- 2027/2028 maturity wall is coming — these companies need to refinance in a very different rate environment
- Limited European credit defaults historically, so each situation requires rigorous analysis

### Two Distinct Playbooks

#### Playbook A: Aggressive Sponsor Situations

**Characteristics:**
- PE sponsor or controlling shareholder with history of aggressive tactics
- Loose loan docs with weak restricted payments covenants
- Unrestricted subsidiary structures that allow asset movement
- Sponsor incentivised to extract value for equity before bondholders react

**Examples:**
- Altice France / Drahi — moved assets to unrestricted subsidiaries
- Ardagh — similar tactics to benefit equity/sponsors at bondholder expense
- J.Crew, Serta — "creditor-on-creditor violence" playbook

**Options Implications:**
- Equity might SPIKE before eventual collapse (sponsor extracts value)
- Puts alone may not work — timing is treacherous
- Consider: calls (on asset stripping news), straddles (binary outcomes), or avoid entirely
- These situations are harder to trade systematically

#### Playbook B: Maturity Wall / No Aggressive Sponsor

**Characteristics:**
- Company isn't being actively looted
- Simply overleveraged from 2021 issuance
- Faces 2027/2028 maturity wall
- Can't refinance at current spreads without distressed exchange or restructuring
- More predictable deterioration path

**Options Implications:**
- Puts are likely the right strategy
- Timing tied to: maturity schedule, rating actions, covenant breaches
- More predictable — system can identify entry points
- Theta cost acceptable if catalyst timeline is clear

### Critical Research Question

> "Where was the options market pricing when credit analysts first flagged issues?"

This is the edge we're hunting — the lag between:
1. Credit spread widening / analyst concern
2. Options market repricing (IV increase, put skew)

---

## 4. Product 2: Autonomous Trading Agent Specification

### Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Autonomous execution** | Opens and closes trades without human approval |
| **Edge detection** | Quantifies conviction level across multiple signals |
| **Aggressive sizing** | Scales position size based on edge score |
| **Psychology understanding** | Predicts human behaviour and market reactions |
| **Risk management** | Hard guardrails that cannot be overridden |
| **Learning loop** | Improves over time based on outcomes |
| **Notifications** | Telegram alerts for all actions with reasoning |

### The Edge Scoring System

The agent quantifies "I have an edge" using a weighted score:
EDGE_SCORE = weighted average of:
- Credit signal strength (0-10)     weight: 25%
- Psychology alignment (0-10)       weight: 25%
- Options mispricing (0-10)         weight: 20%
- Catalyst clarity (0-10)           weight: 15%
- Historical pattern match (0-10)   weight: 15%

#### Credit Signal Strength (0-10)
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-3 | Minor concern, no action needed |
| 4-5 | Watching — early warning signs |
| 6-7 | Material deterioration — active monitoring |
| 8-9 | Serious distress — high conviction signal |
| 10 | Imminent default/restructuring |

#### Psychology Alignment (0-10)
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-3 | Market already pricing risk — no edge |
| 4-5 | Some awareness, but not fully priced |
| 6-7 | Market complacent — clear mispricing |
| 8-9 | Extreme complacency or denial |
| 10 | Total disconnect between credit reality and equity pricing |

#### Options Mispricing (0-10)
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-3 | Options fairly priced — no edge |
| 4-5 | Slight mispricing |
| 6-7 | Clear mispricing — IV too low given credit risk |
| 8-9 | Significant mispricing — cheap protection |
| 10 | Extreme mispricing — gift |

#### Catalyst Clarity (0-10)
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-3 | No clear catalyst — vague timing |
| 4-5 | Potential catalyst within 6 months |
| 6-7 | Known catalyst within 3 months |
| 8-9 | Imminent catalyst within 1 month |
| 10 | Catalyst this week |

#### Historical Pattern Match (0-10)
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-3 | No similar historical precedent |
| 4-5 | Some similarities to past situations |
| 6-7 | Strong pattern match — similar setup worked before |
| 8-9 | Very close match to successful past trades |
| 10 | Almost identical to high-conviction winner |

### Aggression Logic
POSITION_SIZE = BASE_SIZE x AGGRESSION_MULTIPLIER
AGGRESSION_MULTIPLIER based on EDGE_SCORE:
- Edge score < 5.0: DO NOT TRADE
- Edge score 5.0-5.9: 0.5x (half size, cautious)
- Edge score 6.0-6.9: 1.0x (standard size)
- Edge score 7.0-7.9: 1.5x (increased conviction)
- Edge score 8.0-8.9: 2.0x (high conviction)
- Edge score 9.0+: 2.5x (maximum aggression)

**The agent earns the right to be aggressive by having multiple signals align.**

### Risk Guardrails (Hard Limits — Cannot Be Overridden)

| Guardrail | Limit | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Max single position | 5% of account | No single bet can blow up account |
| Max portfolio exposure | 30% of account | Always have dry powder |
| Max loss per trade | 50% of position value | Stop-loss required on all trades |
| Max daily loss | 5% of account | Circuit breaker — stop trading |
| Max weekly loss | 10% of account | Circuit breaker — stop trading |
| Max correlation | 3 positions in same sector | Diversification enforced |
| Min edge score to trade | 5.0 | No low-conviction trades |

### Notification System (Telegram)

#### Trade Opened
TRADE OPENED
Ticker: [ATUS]
Direction: LONG PUT
Strike: $5.00
Expiry: March 2026
Size: 10 contracts (1.5x standard — HIGH CONVICTION)
Cost: $2,340
EDGE SCORE: 7.8/10

Credit signal: 8/10 (covenant breach imminent)
Psychology: 7/10 (market still complacent)
Options: 8/10 (IV 30th percentile — cheap)
Catalyst: 8/10 (earnings in 2 weeks)
Pattern: 7/10 (similar to Ardagh Q2 2024)

THESIS: Credit deterioration not reflected in equity.
Expecting 20-30% downside on earnings miss or guidance cut.

#### Trade Adjusted
TRADE ADJUSTED
Ticker: [ATUS]
Action: ADDED TO POSITION
New size: 15 contracts (was 10)
Reason: Edge score increased to 8.3 after rating downgrade
Updated cost basis: $3,100

#### Trade Closed
TRADE CLOSED
Ticker: [ATUS]
Direction: LONG PUT
Result: +$4,200 (+180%)
Hold time: 18 days
EXIT REASON: Target hit — equity down 35% post-earnings
LEARNINGS:

Credit signal preceded equity move by 6 weeks
Psychology score was accurate — market was in denial
Pattern match to Ardagh was correct
Adding to position on downgrade was right call

This pattern logged for future reference.

#### Daily Summary
DAILY SUMMARY — Feb 3, 2026
Open positions: 3
Total exposure: 18% of account
Daily P&L: +$1,240 (+2.1%)
Weekly P&L: +$3,890 (+6.4%)
POSITIONS:

ATUS Mar $5 puts — +45% — Edge: 7.8
TIIMN Apr 0.30 puts — -12% — Edge: 6.2
VIRFIN Jun 2 puts — +8% — Edge: 7.1

WATCHLIST ALERTS:

INEOS: Credit signal strengthening (now 7/10)
GRIFSA: Rating watch negative — monitoring

No trades today. Edge scores below threshold.

#### High Conviction Alert
HIGH CONVICTION OPPORTUNITY
Ticker: [INEOS]
Edge Score: 8.5/10
This exceeds our 8.0 threshold for aggressive sizing.
Preparing 2.0x position if options liquid enough.
Will notify when trade executed.

### Learning Loop

The agent tracks and learns:

| Metric | What It Tracks | How It Learns |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Edge score accuracy | Did high edge scores lead to wins? | Adjusts component weights |
| Signal timing | How long from signal to move? | Refines catalyst clarity scoring |
| Psychology accuracy | Did market react as predicted? | Improves psychology model |
| Pattern matching | Which historical patterns were predictive? | Builds pattern library |
| Risk/reward | Actual vs expected outcomes | Refines position sizing |

After each closed trade:
1. Log all inputs and outputs
2. Compare predicted vs actual outcome
3. Identify what worked and what didn't
4. Adjust scoring weights if needed
5. Store pattern for future matching

## 14. Key Learnings / Mistakes to Avoid

### From Ardagh / CDS Experience
- Buying CDS protection on LME candidates doesn't work as expected
- Asset Package Delivery mechanism fails for corporate LMEs
- Protection buyers ended up with illiquid equity they couldn't use
- **Lesson:** Focus on equity options, not CDS basis trades

### From General Experience
- Being early feels exactly like being wrong — need conviction to hold
- Credit signals can fire weeks/months before equity reprices
- Aggressive sponsors can make equity GO UP before collapse (asset stripping)
- Not every credit deterioration = buy puts

### Format Lessons
- Technical books (options, quant, credit) — ebook/PDF preferred
- Narrative books (psychology, memoirs) — audiobook fine
- Kindle — Calibre + DeDRM
- Paperback — scan or find PDF
