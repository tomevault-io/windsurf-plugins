# GEMINI.md -- iccDEV

Google Gemini tooling (agents that load `GEMINI.md`) should treat `AGENTS.md` as
the canonical agent-instruction file for this repository. This file is a thin
mirror so Gemini engages the same unified instructions as every other agent.

GitHub Copilot recognizes `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `GEMINI.md` as
equivalent agent-instruction files. To avoid drift, iccDEV keeps one source of
truth in `AGENTS.md`; do not duplicate rules here.

## Read First

1. `AGENTS.md` -- ground rules and the navigation map.
2. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` -- cross-cutting build, test, style, CI.
3. `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` -- path-specific rules that apply to
   the files you touch (`applyTo` globs auto-load the right file).
