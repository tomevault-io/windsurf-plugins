# Contributing Guide for AI Agents

Instructions for AI coding agents working on this project.

## Build & Test

```bash
go build ./...          # Build — run after every change
go test ./... -count=1  # Test — all packages must pass
go vet ./...            # Lint
mage preflight          # Full preflight (fmt, tidy, vet, lint, build, test, race, vulncheck, gofumpt, deadcode)
mage install            # Full deploy (test + build + install)
```

### Preflight Before Push (MANDATORY)

Run `mage preflight` before any commit/push. It executes 12 checks matching CI:
`fmt → tidy → mod verify → vet → lint → build → test → race test → WSL test → vulncheck → gofumpt → deadcode`.
This catches formatting (`gofmt`), linting, and other issues that `go build` and `go vet` alone miss.
