# Rules

1. `Any` should be avoided in the Python type hints, and `object` is only marginally better — both are poor choices. Use the proper, most precise type possible.
2. A performance change lands as two PRs: first the benchmark on its own, then the change itself, so the effect is visible against the recorded baseline.
3. Private functions that are used only once should not be written; inline their implementation at the sole call site.
4. Avoid `typing.cast` in Python. Narrow types with runtime checks or improve the underlying annotation or interface instead.
