# Agent Notes

## Local Test Account Hygiene

When doing local development, manual validation, or integration-style testing that needs an OtherYou/Nym account, do not create a new throwaway user or nym for every run.

- Reuse one clearly designated local test account/nym whenever possible.
- If a fresh local test account/nym is genuinely needed, create only what is necessary and clean it up when done.
- Do not modify, delete, repurpose, or run cleanup against accounts or nyms associated with `ian@...` or `iantbutler01@...`.
- The only exception is a specific test account the user explicitly creates and tells you to use.
