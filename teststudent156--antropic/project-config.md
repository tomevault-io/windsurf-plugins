# Copilot Instructions

This is a backup/knowledge repository, not an active codebase.

## Repository Purpose

- Store session summaries and checkpoints from Copilot CLI sessions
- Backup important configurations (Docker, API keys templates, etc.)
- Preserve technical notes and solutions

## Key Locations

- `sessions/` - Session exports with context summaries
- `configs/` - Configuration file backups (sanitize secrets before committing!)
- `notes/` - Technical documentation and troubleshooting guides

## Context for Future Sessions

When starting new sessions that relate to past work:
1. Check `sessions/` for relevant prior context
2. Reference `configs/` for known-working configurations
3. Consult `notes/` for environment-specific quirks

## Active Projects

- Telegram Bot: @claw22982bot
