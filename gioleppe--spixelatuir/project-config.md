# Rust & SWE Best Practices for SpixelaTUIr

You are an expert Rust developer and AI coding assistant working on "SpixelaTUIr", a high-performance, TUI-based image glitching and processing application. Adhere to the following guidelines strictly when writing, refactoring, or suggesting code for this repository.

## 0. Project Overview
**SpixelaTUIr** is a terminal-based image glitching and processing tool written in Rust (Edition 2024). Users apply a real-time chain of effects to images with a live preview rendered in the terminal using the Sixel graphics protocol (or ANSI half-block fallback).

### Key Technologies
- **TUI Framework:** `ratatui` + `crossterm`
- **Image Rendering:** `ratatui-image` (Sixel, Kitty, half-blocks)
- **Image Processing:** `image`, `imageproc`, `rayon`
- **Serialization:** `serde`, `serde_json`, `serde_yml`
- **Architecture:** Multi-threaded worker-thread model (UI thread ↔ Engine thread via `mpsc`)

## 1. Building and Testing

```sh
cargo build --release      # compile in release mode
cargo run --release        # build and run
cargo test                 # run all tests (unit + snapshot)
cargo fmt                  # format code — run before every commit
cargo clippy               # lint — must pass with zero warnings before committing
```

> **Always run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing.** CI enforces both.

## 2. Core Architecture & State Management
* **Strict Decoupling:** Never perform image processing math inside the `ratatui` UI drawing functions. The UI loop must be as lightweight as possible to maintain 60 FPS.
* **Message Passing:** Communication between the Main Thread (UI) and the Engine Thread (Worker) must be handled via `std::sync::mpsc` channels. 
    * UI sends `WorkerCommand` enums (e.g., `Process { image, pipeline, response_tx }`, `Export { ... }`, `Quit`).
    * Engine sends back `WorkerResponse` enums (`ProcessedFrame(DynamicImage)`, `Exported(PathBuf)`, `Error(String)`).
* **State Structuring:** Maintain a single source of truth in the UI thread for widget states (sliders, menus), but keep the heavy `DynamicImage` assets (source, proxy, preview buffer, animation frames) managed efficiently, minimizing clones.

## 3. Image Processing & Performance
* **Data Parallelism:** Image processing is highly CPU-bound. Use the `rayon` crate for all heavy pixel iterations. Prefer `.par_iter_mut()` or `.par_chunks_mut()` over standard iterators when applying effects like Pixel Sort, Inversion, or Hue Shifting.
* **Proxy First:** Always perform live preview math on a `proxy_asset` (a `DynamicImage` downscaled to match the terminal's Sixel pixel dimensions). Only apply math to the `source_asset` during the dedicated Export thread workflow.
* **Zero-Cost Abstractions:** When an image passes through the `Pipeline`, mutate a single buffer in-place sequentially where mathematically possible, rather than allocating a new buffer for every `Effect` node in the chain.

## 4. TUI & Rendering (Sixel)
* **Sixel Protocol:** The live preview canvas must be rendered using `ratatui-image` configured strictly with the `ImageProtocol::Sixel` backend to ensure high-fidelity previews across macOS, Linux, and Windows (via Windows Terminal/WezTerm). Provide ANSI half-block rendering only as a graceful fallback.
* **Terminal Restoration:** Never `unwrap()` or `panic!()` blindly. Always implement a custom panic hook that calls `crossterm::terminal::disable_raw_mode()` and leaves the alternate screen before printing the panic trace. Failure to do so will break the user's terminal.

## 5. Error Handling
* **Crates:** Use `anyhow` for application-level error bubbling and general context. Use `thiserror` for defining specific, recoverable library/engine errors (e.g., `ImageLoadError`, `UnsupportedFormat`, `PipelineParseError`).
* **Silent Failures:** Do not silently fail on image I/O or rendering errors. Surface errors to the user via a dedicated error modal or status bar in the TUI.

## 6. Code Style & Tooling
* **Formatting:** Ensure all code adheres to standard `rustfmt`.
* **Linting:** Code must pass `cargo clippy` without warnings. Address clippy suggestions actively.
* **Pre-commit Checks:** Always run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing code to ensure formatting and linting standards are met.
* **Idiomatic Rust:** Use `match` statements over `if let` when handling complex enums (like the `Effect` enum). Derive standard traits (`Debug`, `Clone`, `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `Default`) where appropriate.

## 7. Project Structure Adherence
Respect the established directory structure:
* `src/app/`: Application state, event loop, keyboard handlers, and pipeline utilities. Decomposed into focused sub-modules:
    * `state.rs`: Central `AppState` struct, image loading, undo/redo, worker dispatch, and preview management.
    * `handlers.rs`: All keyboard input handlers for every `InputMode` (normal, edit effect, file browser, export dialog, etc.).
    * `file_browser.rs`: `FileBrowserState`, `FileBrowserEntry`, `FileBrowserPurpose` — filesystem navigation modal.
