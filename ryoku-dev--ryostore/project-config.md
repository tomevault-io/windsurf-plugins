## Prowl project context

This repo has a Prowl index of its files, symbols, and how they connect. To find
code, read one symbol, trace who calls it, or check what a change touches,
**query Prowl first** -- do not grep or read whole files just to locate things.
Prowl reindexes what changed before each query, so answers stay current, and it
returns ranked, cited file:line results in one call instead of a grep hit list
you then open files to disambiguate.

The same index is reachable two ways, and every agent should know both:

- **Preferred -- Prowl MCP tools** (they appear in your tool list when your
  harness wires Prowl as an MCP server): search_context (where/how does X work),
  read_symbol (one symbol's source), outline (a file's structure, no bodies),
  find_references (call sites), analyze_change (blast radius before an edit), and
  sketch_ui (how a UI looks, from source).
- **Opt-in -- the prowl-agent CLI** (same capabilities, for when MCP is not
  wired): overview, find <name>, outline <path>, def <name>, references <name>,
  callers|callees|relations <path>, impact <path>, search <text>, wip, and
  changed / doctor after edits.

Keep grep and glob for literal-string and filename scans only. CLI output is
token-lean TOON by default; add --format human|toon|json|markdown.

## Prowl project map

Auto-generated from the Prowl index, refreshed on each `overview`/`init`. Prefer retrieving from Prowl (and reading the cited files) over grepping or relying on training memory; this is the current shape of the repo.
