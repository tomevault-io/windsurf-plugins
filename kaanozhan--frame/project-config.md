# Frame - Project Instructions

This project is managed with **Frame**. AI assistants should follow the rules below to keep documentation up to date.

> **Note:** This file is named `AGENTS.md` to be AI-tool agnostic. A `CLAUDE.md` symlink is provided for Claude Code compatibility.

## Core Working Principle

**Only do what the user asks.** Do not go beyond the scope of the request.

- Implement exactly what the user requested — nothing more, nothing less.
- Do not change business logic, flow, or architecture unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- If a user asks for a design change, only change the design. Do not refactor, restructure, or modify functionality alongside it.
- If you have additional suggestions or improvements, **present them as suggestions** to the user. Never implement them without approval.
- The user's request must be completed first. Additional ideas come after, as proposals.

**Example:** If the user asks for a modal design change, only change the visual appearance. Do not add new IPC channels, modify event flows, or restructure code.

## 🧭 Project Navigation

**Read these files at the start of each session:**

1. **STRUCTURE.json** - Module map, which file is where
2. **PROJECT_NOTES.md** - Project vision, past decisions, session notes
3. **tasks.json** - Pending tasks

**Workflow:**
1. Read these files to understand the project and capture context
2. Identify relevant files based on the task
3. Update STRUCTURE.json after making changes (if new modules/files are added)

**Fast File Lookup:** When searching for files related to a feature or concept, run:
```bash
node scripts/find-module.js <keyword>
```
This searches STRUCTURE.json's intentIndex and returns the exact files you need. Use this **before** doing manual grep/glob searches. Examples:
- `node scripts/find-module.js github` → finds githubManager.js + githubPanel.js
- `node scripts/find-module.js terminal` → finds all terminal-related files
- `node scripts/find-module.js --list` → lists all features and their files

**Note:** This system doesn't prevent reading code - it just helps you know where to look.

## Task Management (tasks.json)

### Task Recognition Rules

**These ARE TASKS - add to tasks.json:**
- When the user requests a feature or change
- Decisions like "Let's do this", "Let's add this", "Improve this"
- Deferred work when we say "We'll do this later", "Let's leave it for now"
- Gaps or improvement opportunities discovered while coding
- Situations requiring bug fixes

**These are NOT TASKS:**
- Error messages and debugging sessions
- Questions, explanations, information exchange
- Temporary experiments and tests
- Work already completed and closed
- Instant fixes (like typo fixes)

### Task Creation Flow

1. Detect task patterns during conversation
2. Ask the user at an appropriate moment: "I identified these tasks from our conversation, should I add them to tasks.json?"
3. If the user approves, add to tasks.json

### Task Structure

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "title": "Short and clear title (max 60 characters)",
  "description": "AI's detailed explanation - what will be done, how it will be done, which files will be affected",
  "userRequest": "User's original request/prompt - copy exactly",
  "acceptanceCriteria": "When is this task considered complete? List of concrete criteria",
  "notes": "Important notes, decisions, alternatives that came up during discussion",
  "status": "pending | in_progress | completed",
  "priority": "high | medium | low",
  "category": "feature | fix | refactor | docs | test",
  "context": "Session date and context",
  "createdAt": "ISO date",
  "updatedAt": "ISO date",
  "completedAt": "ISO date | null"
}
```

### Task Content Rules

**title:** Short, action-oriented title
- ✅ "Add tasks button to terminal toolbar"
- ❌ "Tasks"

**description:** AI's detailed technical explanation
- What will be done (what)
- How it will be done (how) - brief technical approach
- Which files will be affected
- Minimum 2-3 sentences

**userRequest:** User's original words
- Copy the user's prompt/request exactly
- Important for preserving context
- In "User said: ..." format

**acceptanceCriteria:** Completion criteria
- Concrete, testable items
- "Task is complete when this happens" list

**notes:** Discussion notes (optional)
- Alternatives considered
- Important decisions and their reasons
- Dependencies marked as "we'll do this later"

### Task Status Updates

- When starting work on a task: `status: "in_progress"`
- When task is completed: `status: "completed"`, update `completedAt`
- After commit: Check and update the status of related tasks

---

## PROJECT_NOTES.md Rules

### When to Update?
- When an important architectural decision is made
- When a technology choice is made
- When an important problem is solved and the solution method is noteworthy
- When an approach is determined together with the user

### Format
Free format. Date + title is sufficient:
```markdown
### [2026-01-26] Topic title
Conversation/decision as is, with its context...
```

### Update Flow
- Update immediately after a decision is made
- You can add without asking the user (for important decisions)
