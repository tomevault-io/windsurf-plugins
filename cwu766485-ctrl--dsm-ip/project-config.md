## Project

This repository is a reusable DSM digital IP handoff package for digital IC design and verification.

Main flows:

- MATLAB fixed-point and bit-true reference modeling
- Synthesizable Verilog/SystemVerilog RTL
- SystemVerilog XSim verification
- Vivado IP packaging
- OOC synthesis, timing, and resource analysis
- FPGA/RFSoC board-validation support

## Key Paths

- `rtl/`: synthesizable RTL and IP wrappers
- `matlab/`: fixed-point models, vector generation, and analysis scripts
- `verif/`: simulation testbenches, vectors, and regression scripts
- `ip/`: Vivado IP packaging flow
- `syn/`: OOC synthesis scripts and reports
- `fpga/`: board integration notes and local validation support
- `docs/`: specifications, status, plans, and handoff notes

Read the relevant source files before making changes. Do not infer behavior from file names only.

## Core Rules

- Keep all public project files in English.
- Do not commit passwords, tokens, licenses, server addresses, private account data, or restricted vendor/board collateral.
- Preserve MATLAB/RTL bit-true behavior unless a behavior change is explicitly requested.
- Do not change fixed-point width, signedness, scaling, rounding, truncation, saturation, reset state, update order, vector format, or latency silently.
- Keep RTL synthesizable and interfaces stable.
- Keep changes small, localized, and reviewable.
- Place future UVM work under `verif/uvm/`.
- Do not add generated logs, waveform dumps, tool caches, or large temporary artifacts.

## Source Priority

When information conflicts, follow this order:

1. Latest user instruction
2. This file
3. Regression scripts and filelists
4. MATLAB bit-true reference
5. RTL implementation
6. Project documentation
7. Code comments

## Required Checks

After RTL changes:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\verif\scripts\run_xsim_p0_all.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\verif\scripts\run_xsim_ip_smoke.ps1
```

After MATLAB or algorithm changes:

```powershell
.\scripts\run_matlab_p0_bittrue_check.cmd
```

After IP wrapper or packaging changes:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\ip\package_vivado_ip.ps1
```

After synthesis, timing, or resource changes:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\syn\run_ooc_all_dsm.ps1 -Part xc7z020clg400-1
```

If a required tool is unavailable, report it clearly. Never claim a check passed unless it was run.

## Documentation

When tracked project behavior, structure, verification evidence, or limitations change, update the relevant docs and `docs/UPDATE_LOG.md`.

Record:

- date and time
- changed files
- reason for change
- checks run
- remaining limitations

## Work Flow

For every task:

1. Read the relevant files.
2. Identify the source of truth.
3. Make the smallest safe change.
4. Run the required checks.
5. Update docs if needed.
6. Report the result with exact checks and remaining risks.
