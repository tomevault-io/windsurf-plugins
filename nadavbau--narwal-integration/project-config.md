# Narwal HA Integration Conventions

## Git Commit Messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

- `feat:` new features or entities
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `refactor:` code restructuring without behavior change
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `chore:` build, CI, dependencies

Examples:
- `feat: add locate button entity`
- `fix: battery sensor showing 0% on startup`
- `refactor: extract protobuf parsing into utility module`

## Project Structure

- `custom_components/narwal/` — Home Assistant integration
- `custom_components/narwal/narwal_client/` — MQTT client library (protocol layer)
- Keep HA-specific code (entities, config flow) separate from the MQTT client library

## Code Style

- Python 3.12+, type hints on all public functions
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` in all modules
- Follow Home Assistant coding standards for entity classes

## Security

- NEVER commit personal identifiers, credentials, API keys, tokens, passwords, device IDs, or email addresses
- Use placeholder values in example/template files (e.g. `your_email@example.com`, `your_device_id`)
- Credentials in test scripts must be read from environment variables, never hardcoded
