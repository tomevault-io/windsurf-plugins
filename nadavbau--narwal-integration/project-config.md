# HA Integration Resilience

## Setup Must Tolerate Offline Devices

The vacuum enters deep sleep when idle. `async_setup` must never fail due to
command timeouts — catch `NarwalCommandError` and start with empty state.

```python
# ❌ BAD — crashes setup when vacuum is asleep
await self.client.request_status_update()

# ✅ GOOD — setup succeeds, state populates when vacuum wakes
try:
    await self.client.request_status_update()
except NarwalCommandError:
    _LOGGER.warning("Vacuum may be asleep — will retry on next poll")
```

## Never Block the Event Loop

All MQTT and SSL operations must run in executors. HA detects blocking calls
(`ssl.create_default_context`, `threading.Event.wait`) and logs errors.

## Re-raise vs Swallow Errors

- **Setup path**: catch and log command errors (integration must load)
- **Poll path (`_async_update_data`)**: catch errors, track failure count for reconnect
- **User-triggered actions** (locate, start, stop): let errors propagate to show in UI

## Broadcast Registration

The vacuum only sends push broadcasts after receiving `active_robot_publish`.
Re-send this every poll cycle — the vacuum may have woken from deep sleep
since the last send and doesn't know about us.
