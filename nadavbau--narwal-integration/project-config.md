# Narwal Protocol Notes

## Deep Sleep Behavior

The vacuum maintains its MQTT broker connection during deep sleep but does
NOT process incoming commands. Publishes succeed (`rc=0`) but no response
arrives. This is NOT a token/connection issue — the device is simply not
listening. No amount of reconnecting will help; wait for it to wake.

## Token Expiry

The JWT access token (used as MQTT password) expires. The broker may silently
stop routing responses before the calculated expiry time. Track consecutive
command failures and force token refresh + reconnect after 3 failures.

## Two Status Paths

- `status/robot_base_status` — contains WorkingStatus enum, battery, boolean
  flags (is_cleaning, is_paused, is_returning, is_docked). Sent as push
  broadcast AND as command response to `status/get_device_base_status`.
- `status/working_status` — contains ONLY elapsed_time (field 3) and
  cleaned_area (field 13). Does NOT contain WorkingStatus enum. Sent only
  during active cleaning.

## Explicit Subscriptions Only

Narwal's Aliyun IoT broker accepts wildcard subscriptions (e.g. `base_topic/#`)
but does NOT route messages through them — only EXPLICIT topic subscriptions
get messages delivered.

- `_on_connect` subscribes to each broadcast topic individually
  (`status/robot_base_status`, `status/working_status`).
- `_send_command_locked` subscribes to the specific `{topic}/response`
  before each publish and waits briefly for SUBACK. Do not remove these
  per-command subscribes — without them responses won't arrive.

## Map Data

Map grid is zlib-compressed protobuf containing packed repeated varints.
Each pixel: `room_id = val >> 8`, `pixel_type = val & 0xFF`.
Map Y-axis is flipped (mathematical coords → image coords).
