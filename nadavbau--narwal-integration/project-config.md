# Lovelace Card Patterns

## Visual Editor

Use `ha-form` with a schema array for card editors — this is how HA's
built-in editors work and handles entity pickers reliably.

```javascript
// ❌ BAD — ha-entity-picker in shadow DOM won't render
const picker = document.createElement("ha-entity-picker");
picker.hass = this._hass;  // often fails to trigger render

// ✅ GOOD — ha-form handles everything
const SCHEMA = [
  { name: "entity", required: true, selector: { entity: { domain: "vacuum" } } },
  { name: "camera_entity", selector: { entity: { domain: "camera" } } },
];
this._form = document.createElement("ha-form");
this._form.schema = SCHEMA;
this._form.hass = this._hass;
this._form.data = this._config;
```

The editor element must NOT use shadow DOM — append directly to `this`
(not `this.shadowRoot`) so HA's styling works.

## Entity Resolution

Support explicit config AND auto-detection fallback for all entities
(camera, battery sensor, mode select). Search `hass.states` for
`*narwal*` patterns as fallback.
