# Repository guide

## Product intent

This repository is a personal technology brand site for interviewers, investors,
and competition judges. The homepage is curated proof of value, not a chronological
blog feed. It gives products, learning projects, engineering notes, and the personal
profile four explicit entry points before presenting selected content.

## Stack and commands

- Astro 7, TypeScript, Markdown/MDX, and plain CSS.
- `npm run dev`: local development server.
- `npm run check`: Astro and TypeScript validation.
- `npm run build`: production static build; required before handoff.
- `npm run new:note -- <slug>`: scaffold a technical note.
- `npm run new:project -- <slug>`: scaffold a learning project.
- `npm run new:product -- <slug>`: scaffold a closed-source product case study.

On Windows PowerShell, use `npm.cmd` if script execution policy blocks `npm.ps1`.

## Architecture boundaries

- Content belongs in `src/content/**`; never hard-code individual articles or
  projects into page components.
- Collection metadata and validation belong in `src/content.config.ts`.
- Content selection and sorting belong in `src/utils/content.ts`.
- Site identity, navigation, links, and profile placeholders belong in
  `src/data/site.ts`.
- Repository owner/name, public API URL, and interactive GitHub links also belong in
  `src/data/site.ts`; do not duplicate them across components.
- Layouts own page shells; components own reusable presentation; pages only compose
  data and components.
- Global visual decisions belong in `src/styles/tokens.css`. Avoid one-off colors,
  spacing values, and shadows inside components when a token can express them.
- All internal links must use `withBase()` so project-style GitHub Pages paths keep
  working after `base` is configured.

## Content rules

- Before adding, migrating, or substantially rewriting a learning project, read and
  follow `docs/CODEX_LEARNING_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` in full. It defines the durable
  cross-session workflow for source fidelity, truth boundaries, project imagery,
  privacy, metadata, and validation.
- Before adding, migrating, or substantially rewriting a technical note, read and
  follow `docs/CODEX_TECHNICAL_NOTE_GUIDE.md` in full. It defines the durable
  cross-session workflow for primary-source verification, two-level tags, concise
  technical writing, imagery, credential redaction, discovery, and validation.
- Use Markdown for short notes and MDX only when a case study needs components.
- Keep slugs lowercase ASCII kebab-case.
- A new content file must become routable and discoverable without editing a page.
- Use `draft: true` for incomplete content. Do not hide unfinished work with CSS.
- `featured` controls homepage inclusion; `priority` controls curated ordering.
- Do not invent performance, adoption, revenue, award, or user metrics.
- For closed-source work, publish only sanitized architecture, screenshots, decisions,
  and verified outcomes. Never publish secrets, customer data, private repository URLs,
  proprietary source, or confidential algorithms.

## UI and accessibility

- Preserve the hierarchy: a compact identity introduction, four clear content choices,
  then selected product, learning work, notes, principles, and contact.
- The visual language is warm editorial: cream paper-like backgrounds, muted amber,
  dark brown text, restrained shadows, and clear serif-led headings.
- Do not reintroduce neon accents, dark dashboard themes, grid overlays, fake system
  metrics, circuit graphics, or decorative effects that compete with navigation.
- Keep motion restrained and support `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Maintain keyboard focus states, semantic landmarks, useful alt text, and readable
  contrast. Do not make hover the only way to reveal essential information.
- Validate desktop and mobile layouts. Avoid adding a UI framework unless the user
  explicitly chooses one and the benefit outweighs the added coupling.

## Change discipline

- Prefer the smallest coherent change and preserve unrelated user edits.
- Do not commit generated `dist/`, `.astro/`, credentials, or private project assets.
- Never embed a GitHub token in client code. Star counts may use the public repository
  API; starring itself must continue through GitHub's authenticated UI.
- The guestbook uses Utterances and public GitHub Issues. Keep the dedicated comments
  route, explain the public/authenticated nature of comments, and preserve a direct
  Issues fallback link.
- Update `README.md`, content templates, and schemas together when the authoring
  workflow changes.
- Before finishing implementation work, run `npm run check` and `npm run build`.
  Report any check that could not be run and why.
