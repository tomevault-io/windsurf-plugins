# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI agent development framework designed for collaborative software engineering workflows. The project uses a specialized agent-based approach where different AI agents handle distinct phases of development:

- **Strategic Planning**: Feature analysis and technical design
- **Task Execution**: Precise, step-by-step implementation
- **Code Review**: Quality assurance and security validation
- **Architecture Analysis**: Project structure and documentation

## Agent Architecture

### Core Agent Types

The system defines specialized agents in `/draft/`:

- `@strategic-planner`: Requirements analysis, technical design, and task planning (no code execution)
- `@task-executor`: Surgical precision implementation of individual tasks from task lists
- `@code-reviewer`: Post-implementation quality and security review
- `@steering-architect`: Project analysis and core documentation creation

### Agent Interaction Pattern

1. **Project Initialization**: `@steering-architect` analyzes codebase and creates `.docs/` foundation
2. **Feature Planning**: `@strategic-planner` creates specifications in `specs/<feature>/`
3. **Implementation**: `@task-executor` executes tasks from `specs/<feature>/tasks.md`
4. **Quality Assurance**: `@code-reviewer` reviews all code changes

## Project Structure

```
.
├── draft/                  # Agent definitions and specifications
│   ├── code-reviewer.md   # Code review agent spec
│   ├── task-executor.md   # Implementation agent spec
│   ├── strategic-planner.md # Planning agent spec
│   └── steering-architect.md # Architecture agent spec
└── READMD.md              # Project workflow documentation
```

### Expected Structure for Projects Using This Framework

```
.
├── .docs/                 # Global project context
│   ├── product.md         # Project vision and goals
│   ├── tech.md           # Technology stack and tools
│   └── structure.md      # File structure conventions
└── specs/                # Feature-specific specifications
    └── <feature-name>/
        ├── requirements.md # User stories and acceptance criteria
        ├── design.md      # Technical architecture
        └── tasks.md       # Step-by-step implementation plan
```

## Key Workflow Principles

### Task Execution Rules

When using `@task-executor`:
- Execute ONE task at a time with surgical precision
- Never anticipate or combine future steps
- Mark tasks complete only after successful testing
- Update `tasks.md` checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]` upon completion
- Manual tests require user confirmation before proceeding

### Autonomous Mode

Task executor supports autonomous mode when explicitly requested:
- Skip user review requirements
- Continue to next task automatically
- Stop only for unresolvable errors

### Code Quality Standards

All code changes must pass through `@code-reviewer` which checks:
- Code simplicity and readability
- Clear naming conventions
- No code duplication
- Proper error handling
- No exposed secrets or API keys
- Input validation implementation
- Test coverage adequacy
- Performance considerations

## Agent Invocation Examples

```bash
# Project initialization
"@steering-architect analyze existing codebase and create project guidance files"

# Feature planning
"@strategic-planner plan user authentication feature"

# Task execution
"@task-executor execute specs/user-authentication/tasks.md tasks"

# Code review
"@code-reviewer review recent changes" # Must be used after code modifications
```

## Development Guidelines

### File Management
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Never create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Follow established project conventions and patterns

### Security
- Never expose secrets, API keys, or sensitive information
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow security best practices in all implementations

### Testing
- All automated tests must pass before task completion
- Manual tests require explicit user confirmation
- Do not clean up test data for database tests

## Important Notes

- This framework uses Chinese language documentation for agent specifications
- The `READMD.md` filename appears to be intentional (not a typo)
- No build, test, or lint commands are defined at the framework level (these would be project-specific)
- The framework emphasizes collaborative, spec-driven development methodology

## Context Optimization

### llms.txt Integration
The framework includes an `@llms-txt-generator` agent that creates standardized llms.txt files following the llmstxt.org specification. This improves Claude Code's ability to quickly understand projects:

- **Location**: Projects should have an `llms.txt` file at the root
- **Purpose**: Provides concise project overview for LLM context efficiency
- **Usage**: Run `@llms-txt-generator create llms.txt` after project initialization
- **Benefits**: Faster comprehension, reduced token usage, standardized summaries

When working with this framework:
1. First check if `llms.txt` exists for quick project understanding
2. Use `.docs/` for detailed specifications
3. Update `llms.txt` when major changes occur
