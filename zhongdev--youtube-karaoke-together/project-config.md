# Repository Instructions

## Documentation is part of completion

Treat documentation maintenance as part of every major build session. A major session includes material feature work, architectural refactoring, dependency or toolchain changes, security/compliance changes, persistence or authentication work, and deployment or operational changes.

Before declaring such a session complete:

1. Review the implemented diff and runtime behavior against `README.md`, `client/README.md`, and every repository changelog.
2. Update the root README when setup, prerequisites, architecture, configuration, environment variables, commands, deployment, security, privacy, persistence, or user-visible behavior changes.
3. Update `client/README.md` when frontend setup, scripts, environment variables, routes, client architecture, or build behavior changes.
4. Record notable changes in `CHANGELOG.md` under an `Unreleased` section unless the user has selected a release version and date. Use clear Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security, or Documentation groupings as applicable.
5. Preserve historical changelog entries. Do not invent release versions or dates, and do not describe planned work as implemented.
6. If data collection, retention, authentication, third-party API use, or user consent changes, reconcile the Privacy Policy, Terms, README, and changelog with the actual implementation and update policy versions/effective dates when appropriate.
7. Verify documented commands, paths, defaults, prerequisites, and links against the repository before handoff.

If a major session genuinely requires no documentation text changes, explicitly confirm in the handoff that the README files and changelog were reviewed and remain accurate.
