- **Custom Components**: Reusable React components in `src/components/` for enhanced documentation features

### Key Customizations
- **UTM Tracking**: Built-in UTM parameter system for tracking workshop engagement (configured in `docusaurus.config.js`)
- **Custom Link Component** (`src/components/Link.js`): Automatically appends UTM parameters to external links
- **Screenshot Component** (`src/components/Screenshot.js`): Wrapper for images with browser window styling
- **BrowserWindow Component**: Visual component for displaying screenshots in a browser-like frame

### Theming & Plugins
- **Search**: Local search powered by `docusaurus-lunr-search` with multi-language support
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Built-in support for rendering Mermaid diagrams
- **Code Highlighting**: Prism-based syntax highlighting with support for multiple languages
