The project in this folder is a whatsapp bot, developed using 3rd party APIs

# Main
bots.json - defines the bots
index.js - initialize the bots
src/WhatsAppBotGo.js - currently used API wrapper
src/EventHandler - Handle received events from the multiple APIs
src/CommandHandler - processes commands and prepares responses

## whatsgoapi (Go / whatsmeow)
- **CRITICAL:** `whatsgoapi/go.mod` and `whatsgoapi/go.sum` MUST be tracked and NOT ignored. They are essential for the Docker build.
- If they are missing, the Dockerfile will attempt to initialize them, but it's preferred to keep them in the repo.
- The module name is `whatsgo` and it uses a `replace` directive for the `whatsmeow-lib` submodule.

# Commands
## SuperAdmin
Only for the bot owner, useful commands like join group

## Management
Only for group admins, defined in src/commands/Management.js
CRUD commands, set group parameters and more


## FixedComands
Loads implemented commands from src/function folders (autoload), all of them export their commands:
module.exports = { commands };

They receive messages from the CommandHandler and reply by returning a single or array of ReturnMessages (defined in src/models). They can also directly send messages or reactions using bot client object

## CustomCommands
Create by group admins using management commands

# More
Will be specified in the prompts

For database schema and structure, see: DATABASES.md
