# Cursor Rules for launchpad

This is a Python CLI tool for analyzing iOS and Android app bundle sizes, similar to Emerge Tools.

## Project Structure

- `src/launchpad/` - Main package source code
- `tests/` - Test files (pytest)
- `tests/artifacts/` - Sample app bundles for testing
- `legacy/` - Legacy Swift code (reference only, not to be used)

## Development Guidelines

### Makefile

- Use our [Makefile](mdc:Makefile) as much as possible when interacting with our repo, e.g. for building and testing

### Python

- Use modern Python 3.13+ with type hints
- Follow PEP 8 and ruff formatting (line length 120)
- Use `pytest` for testing
- Use `click` for CLI interface
- Use `lief` for Mach-O binary analysis
- Package management and virtual environment via `uv`
- Use `| None` instead of `Optional`
- When writing comments try to keep them short and informative
- Prefer empty `__init__.py` files.

### Code Quality

- Always include type hints
- Write comprehensive tests
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Follow Sentry's Python best practices

### Testing

- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Use sample artifacts from `tests/_fixtures/`
- Prefer to write integration tests using test fixtures over unit tests with mocking. Try to avoid mocking as much as possible.
- Prefer pytest fixtures for setup

### CLI Development

- Use `click` library for commands
- Support `--verbose` flag for debugging
- Always validate input files
- Provide helpful error messages

### Dependencies

- Core: `click`, `lief`, `pydantic`, `rich`, standard library
- Development: `pytest`, `ruff`, `ty`, `isort`
- Package management: `uv`
- No legacy dependencies (no Capstone, no S3)

### Debugging

- Use VSCode/Cursor debug configurations
- Test with sample artifacts
- Check performance for large binaries

## Key Commands

- `make help` - Show all available commands
- `make dev-setup` - Set up development environment
- `make test` - Run all tests (`test-unit`, `test-integration` available separately)
- `make check` - Run all code quality checks (`check-lint`, `check-format`, `check-types` available separately)
- `make ci` - Full CI pipeline
- `make run-cli` - Run the CLI tool (use ARGS="..." for arguments)
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `make fix` - Auto-fix code issues with ruff

## When suggesting code:

1. Always include proper type hints
2. Add error handling and validation
3. Consider performance implications
4. Follow existing patterns in the codebase
5. Include relevant tests
6. Format imports using ruff
