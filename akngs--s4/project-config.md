When writing tests, always follow these best practices:

- Use 'vitest' as the test framework.
- You don't need to import 'vitest' in your tests because it's already imported in the test runner.
- Tests should be read as specifications or examples rather than implementation details.
- Quality of tests should be the same as the code they test. Remove duplication and make tests as simple as possible.
- Avoid mock whenever possible. It is a sign of a bad design. Try to refactor the code to make it easier to test.
- When writing example data for tests, use the simplest possible data that still covers the test case to keep clarity.
- Use `describe()` to group tests into logical units, while don't make too many `describe()` needlessly.
- Never nest `describe()` into other `describe()` blocks.
- Never wrap single test in `describe()` block.
- When writing acceptance tests, do not use `describe()` since you just write a single test per file.
