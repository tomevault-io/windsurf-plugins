# The Controller

Axum + Svelte 5 web app for orchestrating multiple Claude Code terminal sessions.

## Task Structure (CRITICAL — NEVER SKIP)

**This is the most important rule. Every task, no matter how small, MUST follow this structure before writing any code. No exceptions.**

1. **Definition**: What's the task? Why are we doing it? How will we approach it?
2. **Constraints**: What are the design constraints — from the user prompt, codebase conventions, or what can be inferred?
3. **Validation**: How do I know for sure it was implemented as expected? Can I enforce it with flexible and non-brittle tests? I must validate before I consider a task complete. For semantic changes (bug fixes, feature refinements): if I revert my implementation, the test must still fail. After the implementation, the test must pass.

**If you catch yourself writing code without having stated all three above, STOP and state them first.**

## Key Docs

- `docs/domain-knowledge.md` — Hard-won lessons (main-thread blocking, CLAUDECODE env var). **Read this before modifying request handlers or spawning processes.**
- `docs/plans/` — Design and implementation plans.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Svelte 5 (runes: `$state`, `$derived`, `$props`, `$effect`), xterm.js, vite
- **Backend:** Rust (axum), portable-pty, git2
- **Theme:** Catppuccin Mocha

## Branch Completion Rules

When merging a feature branch back to the base branch (e.g. main), you MUST push to remote after merging. Never leave the base branch out of sync with the remote.

```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git pull
git merge <feature-branch>
# verify tests
git push              # <- REQUIRED, do not skip
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

## Dependencies

- **New worktrees:** Always run `pnpm install` immediately after creating a worktree. Worktrees don't share `node_modules` — without this, `pnpm test` and the dev server will fail.
- **After merging:** Run `pnpm install` in the project root (not the worktree) if `package.json` was modified. The dev server won't auto-install — missing packages cause a white screen.

## Dev Commands

- `./dev.sh` — Run the app (axum on 3001, vite on 1420); open http://localhost:1420
- `cd server && cargo test` — Run Rust tests
- `pnpm test` — Run frontend tests
