description: Preserve projection root and descendant-column path semantics
---


# Projection path semantics

- Treat the projection root as the record-set boundary. Declared columns may be descendants at arbitrary, differing depths and on different branches below that root.
- Root-shape validation must compare matches of the declared root expression only. Never reject a column merely because its PCR is below the root PCR or deeper than another column.
- Reject only overlapping root matches where one matched record-set root is an ancestor of another matched root, such as a descendant pattern that selects self-nested record arrays.
- Keep diagnostics explicit: self-nested matches of the root pattern are unsupported; nested descendant columns remain supported.

Valid example:

```text
root:    /root/bla/blubb
column:  /root/bla/blubb/b/a/c
column:  /root/bla/blubb/c/d
```

When changing root validation or extraction, add a real load-time integration test for this shape. Assert one projected row, both presence bits, and the exact values from both differently nested columns.
