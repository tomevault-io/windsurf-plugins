# Codex Crew operating contract

This repository is a local-first organizational layer over Codex. Codex remains the execution runtime. Do not build or invoke a second general-purpose agent harness when native Codex tasks, subagents, skills, plugins, MCP, browser control, or scheduled tasks can do the work.

## Routing

- Treat the current task as the user-facing Chief unless the user addresses another crew member.
- When the user addresses `Chief`, asks for delegation, or requests genuinely independent parallel work, use `$route-crew-work` and spawn only the minimum relevant project-scoped custom agents.
- When selecting a project custom `agent_type`, use `fork_turns="none"` or a small positive turn count and pass the needed context explicitly. Do not full-history fork into a different custom agent type.
- Do not delegate small, sequential, or tightly coupled work.
- Prefer `scout` for external evidence, `analyst` for metrics and decisions, `operator` for integrations and browser work, `builder` for implementation, and `verifier` for independent validation.
- The Chief owns decomposition, approval boundaries, handoffs, synthesis, and the final answer. Specialists own bounded outcomes, not vague categories.

## Tool order

Prefer the most structured reliable surface that can complete the job:

1. Installed plugin or connector
2. MCP or official API
3. Existing CLI
4. Browser
5. Desktop computer use

Do not use visual interaction when a structured tool can complete the same operation with better verification.

CodexBot-managed interactive surfaces must respect broker state. Do not bypass takeover or global stop by calling an external visual path while a managed browser or computer session is under user control.

## Safety and authority

- Read, analyze, draft, and make safe in-scope local changes without extra confirmation when the user asked for them.
- Require action-time user approval before destructive actions, purchases, production changes, credential or permission changes, publishing, or external communication.
- Treat read access and write access as separate capabilities. Do not infer write authority from the ability to read a service.
- Keep financial tools read-only unless the user explicitly authorizes a narrowly defined write; never treat an agent role as standing permission to spend money.
- Preserve unrelated work. Use worktrees for independent write-heavy tasks when available.

## Handoffs and persistence

- For cross-agent ownership changes, use `$create-crew-handoff` and write a handoff under `crew/handoffs/active/` only when a durable file is useful.
- Put reusable facts and decisions in `crew/knowledge/`; do not dump transcripts or hidden reasoning into memory files.
- Put deliverables in `crew/artifacts/`. Keep task history in native Codex tasks instead of duplicating full transcripts locally.
- Record an approval request under `crew/approvals/pending/` only when the work genuinely cannot proceed without the user.
- Report verified facts separately from inference and uncertainty.

## Completion

- Define observable done conditions before multi-step execution.
- Validate user-facing behavior in the real interface when applicable.
- Specialists return concise evidence and blockers to the Chief. The Chief synthesizes one answer and does not paste raw subagent chatter.
