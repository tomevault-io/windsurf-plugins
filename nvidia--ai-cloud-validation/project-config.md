# Python Development Standards

## Python Version

- All development must use Python 3.12
- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.12 features and syntax

## Code Style and Type Annotations

- All Python files must use type annotations following PEP 585
  - Use built-in collection types with generic parameters (e.g., `dict[str, Any]`, `list[int]`, `set[str]`)
  - Do NOT import collection types from typing (e.g., avoid `from typing import Dict, List, Set`)
  - Only import special types from typing (e.g., `Any`, `Union`, `TypeVar`, `Protocol`)
- Every function and class must have docstrings following PEP 257
- Return types must be explicitly specified for all functions
- Maintain existing comments when modifying files

## Imports

- Place all imports at the top of the file
- Defer imports inside functions only with a one-line comment giving the reason (import cycle, lazy expensive dep, side effects)
- If a function-local import is from a module that's already imported at the top of the file, fold it into the top-level import (the deferred form is a stale leftover, not load-bearing)

## Line Length

- Code: respect `[tool.ruff] line-length` (120)
- Comments and docstrings: wrap at ~100 for readability (prose at 120 reads as a wall)
- `E501` is ignored in this repo, so the linter won't catch long comments — apply both limits at authoring time

## Testing Requirements

- Use pytest exclusively (no unittest)
- All tests must be in `tests/` directory
- Tests must include type annotations

## Configuration and Environment

- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement robust error handling and logging

## Dependencies and Tools

- Use uv package manager for dependency management (<https://github.com/astral-sh/uv>)
- Use Ruff for code style consistency
- Follow GitLab CI/CD practices

## Development Commands

- **Run the application**: `uv run -m <module_name> <command>`
- **Run tests**: `uv run pytest -v`
- **Lint and format code**: `uvx pre-commit run -a`
- **Install dependencies**: `uv sync`

## Documentation

- Maintain clear and concise docstrings
- Keep README files up to date
- Document all major components and APIs
