# Chat Session Model

## Session Flow
1. User lands on [app/page.tsx](mdc:app/page.tsx) which either:
   - Redirects to an existing session if one exists with messages
   - Creates a new session if none exist

2. Sessions are viewed at [app/[sessionId]/page.tsx](mdc:app/[sessionId]/page.tsx)

## Session Data Model
- Each session has a unique UUID and title
- Sessions contain messages in a one-to-many relationship
- Session titles are automatically generated from the first user message

## Messages
- Messages have roles: 'user' or 'assistant'
- Messages contain content that can be text or structured data
- Messages are stored in both Zustand state and Supabase
- Response messages track response time for performance monitoring

## Session Management
The sidebar ([components/chat/Sidebar.tsx](mdc:components/chat/Sidebar.tsx)) provides:
- List of all sessions
- Creation of new sessions
- Deletion of sessions
- Navigation between sessions
