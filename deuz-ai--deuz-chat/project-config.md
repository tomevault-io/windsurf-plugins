# Data Flow and State Management

## Store
The application uses Zustand for state management located in [lib/store.ts](mdc:lib/store.ts). This store manages:
- Chat sessions (create, delete, rename)
- Messages (add, update)
- Current session state
- Loading states

## Supabase Integration
Database interactions are managed through the Supabase client at [lib/supabase/client.ts](mdc:lib/supabase/client.ts). The database has:
- `sessions` table - Stores chat sessions
- `messages` table - Stores chat messages with session relationships

## API Routes
API endpoints are organized in the [app/api/](mdc:app/api/) directory:
- `/api/chat` - Handles chat completions and interactions with AI models
- `/api/messages` - CRUD operations for messages
 
## Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger store actions
2. Store actions update local state and Supabase
3. Components react to state changes via store hooks
4. API calls for AI interactions happen via fetch calls
