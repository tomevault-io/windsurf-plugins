# Arc Plugin

The full arc from idea to shipped code. This plugin provides a skills-based workflow for the complete development lifecycle.

## Command Workflow

All commands use the `/arc:` namespace prefix. The typical workflow:

```
0. HELP       /arc:help       → Context-aware guide to all commands
1. ENTRY      /arc:go         → Routes to right workflow based on context
2. FOUNDATION /arc:vision     → Define project goals (one-time setup)
3. DESIGN     /arc:brand      → Visual identity system (palette, type, assets)
              /arc:ideate     → Turn idea into validated design doc
4. REVIEW     /arc:review     → Expert validation before execution
5. EXECUTE    /arc:implement  → Plan + TDD implementation
              /arc:design     → Create distinctive UI
              /arc:ai         → AI SDK patterns and guidance
6. TEST       /arc:testing    → Test strategy and execution
7. SHIP       /arc:letsgo     → Production readiness checklist

CROSS-CUTTING (available anytime):
              /arc:naming     → Generate and validate project names
              /arc:responsive → Mobile responsive audit & fix
              /arc:seo        → Deep SEO audit
              /arc:audit      → Comprehensive codebase audit
              /arc:commit     → Smart commits with auto-splitting
              /arc:suggest    → What to work on next (+ discovery mode)
              /arc:document   → Capture solved problems
              /arc:tidy       → Clean up completed plans
              /arc:rules      → Apply coding standards
              /arc:deps       → Dependency audit with batch upgrades
              /arc:hooks      → Auto-format, lint, and context monitor hooks
              /arc:help        → Context-aware guide to all commands
              /arc:prune-agents → Kill orphaned subagent processes
```

## Development

To test changes locally:
1. Edit the skill in `skills/<command>/SKILL.md`
2. Run the corresponding command (e.g., `/arc:ideate`)
3. Iterate based on results

## Key Principles

- **Reviewers advise, user decides** — Suggestions are questions, not mandates
- **One question at a time** — Never overwhelm
- **TDD mandatory** — Tests first, implementation second
- **Continuous quality** — TS/lint after every task
- **Knowledge compounds** — Solved problems documented for future sessions
- **Small control plane** — `using-arc` handles startup routing; richer workflows load on demand

## Complementary Plugins

Arc focuses on the development lifecycle. For specialized domains, consider these Vercel Labs plugins:

- **[agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills)** — `vercel-react-best-practices`, `vercel-composition-patterns`, `vercel-react-native-skills`
