# Lecture-to-Notes Synthesizer

Pipeline that turns a recorded university lecture (Panopto video + captions)
into a textbook-quality LaTeX study guide PDF. Owner: Omer (obelyaev@scu.edu),
student at Santa Clara University. Full spec: `What it does.md`,
build order: `5-phase-plan.md`. The quality bar is a professor-made lecture
PDF (theorem/proof style, native vector diagrams) — kept out of this repo as
university property; ask the owner for it.

## Key decisions (do not re-litigate)

- **Everything becomes native LaTeX.** Board diagrams are redrawn as TikZ,
  never embedded as cleaned-up screenshots. The bar is the example PDF.
- **★ exam flags must be high-precision.** Only explicit assessment
  references ("on the final", "you should definitely know") earn ★.
  Generic emphasis ("this is important") goes into JSON metadata for the
  LLM fusion stage to judge in context — never ★ by regex.
- **Model strategy (proven end-to-end, 2026-06-14):** a hybrid that keeps
  ~95% of the work free and local and uses Claude only for one finishing
  pass. Runs on the owner's desktop (Windows, 32 GB RAM, **AMD RX 5700 XT,
  8 GB VRAM** — Ollama uses the GPU via ROCm):
  - **Board transcription → `qwen2.5vl:7b`** (Ollama). A vision model is
    essential here; `qwen2.5vl:7b` reads handwritten board math *far* better
    than gemma3 (gemma3:4b garbled the proofs — wrong edge-count formulas,
    hallucinated content). 27b never fit the 8 GB card; don't bother.
  - **Fusion (chunk → prose) → `gemma3:12b`** (Ollama). Text reasoning.
  - **Finisher → `claude` CLI** (subscription, headless `-p`). One pass to
    dedup, repair LaTeX, and fix diagrams.
  Backends are swappable via `--backend ollama|claude` / `--model`. Why not
  Claude for the boards too? It's more faithful but ~3× the Claude usage per
  lecture and re-spent on every re-run; the local-vision split keeps a whole
  semester nearly free. See README for the cost trade-off.

## Components (all in this folder)

| Component | Status | How to run |
|---|---|---|
| `chrome-extension/` | ✅ works on SCU Panopto | Load unpacked at chrome://extensions. Downloads video (.mp4, incl. camera-only streams via byte-range HLS) + transcript (.srt, sometimes saved as .txt). Camera 1 = full-frame blackboard for CSEN 19. |
| `board-extractor/` | ✅ tested on real lecture | `.venv/bin/python extract_boards.py <video> -o <outdir> --debug-csv`. Color-detects the green board, tracks 8 vertical strips, saves one PNG per board state before each erase. 33 snapshots from a 65-min lecture. Venv has opencv. |
| `latex-converter/convert_lecture.py` | ✅ runs free on the RX 5700 XT | `python3 convert_lecture.py <snapshot-folder> -o output/name --model qwen2.5vl:7b`. Stage 1 (the keeper): per-image transcribe → `.fragments.json` (resumable, cached per board). Stages 2–3 (merge + compile a boards-only PDF) are a bonus you can ignore — the real pipeline fuses the fragments next. Skips the `board-region.png` debug image. `--limit N` for a quick timing test. |
| `transcript-engine/` | ✅ tested on real lecture | `python3 process_transcript.py <captions.srt/.txt> -o output/name --title "..."`. Deterministic: SRT parse → filler strip → paragraph merge → ★ flags. Outputs .md (human) + .json (for fusion; has `stars`, `emphasis`, timestamps). |
| `latex-converter/fuse_lecture.py` | ✅ runs free on the RX 5700 XT | `python3 fuse_lecture.py <transcript.json> <fragments.json> -o output/name --model gemma3:12b`. Interleaves spoken paragraphs + board fragments chronologically (snapshots are at erase time, so time-sorting puts each board after the speech that produced it), splits into chunks of ≤`--boards-per-chunk` boards, and writes one LaTeX **body** per chunk (we own the preamble). Resumable via `<out>.bodies.json`; retries transient Ollama 500s. Produces a **rough draft** (repetition + LaTeX bugs are expected) — the finisher cleans it. `--dry-run` writes the chunk plan, no model calls. |
| `latex-converter/finish_lecture.py` | ✅ produces the final PDF | `python3 finish_lecture.py <out>.bodies.json -o output/name-final --title "..."`. ONE `claude` CLI pass over the assembled draft (fed on stdin): dedup repeated theorems, repair LaTeX, redraw trivial diagrams — keep all math — then tectonic compile (+ up to 2 Claude fix-ups). The only step that uses Claude. |

Compiler: `tectonic` (on the desktop). Claude CLI v2.1.177 installed +
authenticated (Pro) on the desktop. Test data: a real Discrete Math lecture
(2026-06-05) — same topic as the quality-bar PDF, ideal for comparison. The
2026-06-14 end-to-end run reached that bar: correct dedup'd theorem, three
rigorous proofs, real TikZ diagrams, exam boxes, dominating-set + bipartite
material. (Lecture-derived files — transcript, board content, generated
PDFs — are kept out of the repo as university property.)

## Current state: COMPLETE (2026-06-14)

The full pipeline works end-to-end and hit gold-standard quality on the
CSEN 19 lecture. Setup (Ollama + GPU, models, Claude CLI) is done on the
desktop.

To process a new lecture, the easy path is the wrapper:

```
python3 run_pipeline.py --name <name> --title "<Title>" \
    --video <video.mp4> --captions <captions.srt>
# (or --boards boards/<name> to reuse already-extracted snapshots)
```
