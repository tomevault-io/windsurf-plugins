# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Basic Development

- `npm start` or `ng serve` - Start development server on http://localhost:4200
- `npm run build` or `ng build` - Build for production (outputs to `dist/`)
- `npm run watch` or `ng build --watch --configuration development` - Build in watch mode for development
- `npm test` or `ng test` - Run unit tests with Karma

### Angular CLI Commands

- `ng generate component <name>` - Generate new component
- `ng generate service <name>` - Generate new service
- `ng generate --help` - List all available schematics

## Architecture Overview

### Framework & Stack

- **Angular 20** with zoneless change detection (`provideZonelessChangeDetection()`)
- **Standalone components** architecture (no NgModules except for UI library)
- **Spartan UI** (@spartan-ng/brain) with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Lucide Angular** for icons
- **TypeScript** with strict configuration

### Project Structure

- `projects/ui/` - UI application project
  - `src/app/` - Main application code
    - `app.ts` - Root component with navigation and layout
    - `app.config.ts` - Application configuration with providers
    - `app.routes.ts` - Route definitions with lazy-loaded pages
    - `components/` - Reusable UI components
    - `pages/` - Route-specific page components (dashboard, servers, monitoring, settings)
    - `services/` - Application services (theme service)
    - `libs/ui/` - Custom UI component library (Spartan UI components)
  - `public/` - Static assets

### Key Architecture Patterns

- **Bundle Loading**: Two-bundle strategy with initial bundle and lazy-loaded authenticated bundle
- **Authentication Guard**: Routes are protected by an OAuth-based auth guard
- **Signals**: Uses Angular signals for reactive state management (see ThemeService)
- **Standalone Components**: All components are standalone, no NgModules needed
- **Path Mapping**: Custom UI components are mapped via tsconfig paths (`@spartan-ng/helm/button`)

### Routing Architecture

The application uses a hierarchical routing structure with authentication and optimized bundle loading:

- **Protected Routes**: All main application routes (dashboard, users, monitoring, settings) are protected by the `authGuard`
- **Auth Guard**: Uses `angular-oauth2-oidc` to validate ID tokens before allowing access
- **Bundle Strategy**: Uses two bundles - initial bundle for app shell and a single lazy-loaded bundle for all authenticated routes
- **Authenticated Routes**: All authenticated components are loaded together in `authenticated.routes.ts` and lazy-loaded as a single bundle
- **Default Route**: Root path redirects to `/dashboard` after authentication

Routes structure:

```
/
├── '' → redirects to /dashboard
└── '' (with authGuard)
    └── '' → loadChildren: authenticated.routes
        ├── dashboard
        ├── users
        ├── monitoring
        └── settings
```

**Bundle Loading Strategy:**

- Initial bundle: Contains app shell, auth guard, and routing logic
- Authenticated bundle: Contains all authenticated page components (dashboard, users, monitoring, settings) loaded together when user passes authentication

### Styling System

- **Tailwind CSS 4** with custom design tokens
- **CSS (not SCSS)** for all styling - uses plain CSS files
- **CSS Custom Properties** for theming (light/dark mode support)
- **Spartan UI** components with Tailwind styling
- Design system uses HSL color values for consistent theming

### Component Architecture

- Components use inline templates for better co-location
- Spartan UI directives (e.g., `HlmButtonDirective`) for consistent styling
- Theme service manages dark/light mode with localStorage persistence
- Lucide icons integrated throughout the UI

### ng-icons Implementation

When using ng-icons in components, follow this pattern:

1. **Import required dependencies**:

   ```typescript
   import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from "@ng-icons/core";
   import { lucideSun, lucideMoon } from "@ng-icons/lucide";
   ```

2. **Add to component decorator**:

   ```typescript
   @Component({
     imports: [..., NgIcon],
     viewProviders: [provideIcons({lucideSun, lucideMoon})],
     template: `...`
   })
   ```

3. **Use in template with string names**:
   ```html
   <ng-icon name="lucideSun" size="16" /> <ng-icon [name]="condition ? 'lucideSun' : 'lucideMoon'" />
   ```

**Important**: Always use `viewProviders` with `provideIcons()` to register icons, and reference them by string names in templates, not the imported symbols.

### Development Notes

- TypeScript strict mode enabled with additional strict flags
- Prettier configured with Angular HTML parser
- Uses `@angular/build:application` builder (modern Angular build system)
- Component prefix: `app-`
- Budget limits: 500kB warning, 1MB error for initial bundle

### Code Formatting

**Always run `npm run format` after making changes to TypeScript code to ensure code follows the prettier configuration.**
**Always run `mise run lint` after making changes to Go code to ensure it passes all linting checks.**
