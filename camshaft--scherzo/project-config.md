# Agents

This file provides guidance for AI agents and contributors working on this repository.

## Git Pre-commit Hook

To automatically run rustfmt and clippy before each commit, install the pre-commit hook:

```bash
cargo xtask hooks install
```

This will install the pre-commit hook that runs `cargo xtask precommit` before each commit, ensuring:

- Code is formatted with rustfmt (checks only - use `cargo xtask fmt` to apply formatting)
- Clippy lints pass

You can also run the precommit checks manually:

```bash
cargo xtask precommit
```

To apply rustfmt formatting to all files:

```bash
cargo xtask fmt
```

## Auto-fix Workflow

The repository includes a GitHub Action that automatically detects and fixes rustfmt and clippy issues in pull requests.

### How it Works

When you open or update a pull request, the auto-fix workflow:

1. Runs `cargo +nightly fmt --all` to fix formatting issues
2. Runs `cargo clippy --fix` to automatically fix clippy warnings
3. If any changes are made, creates a new pull request against your PR branch with the fixes

### What to Do

If the auto-fix workflow creates a PR against your PR:

1. Review the automated fixes to ensure they're correct
2. Merge the auto-fix PR into your PR branch
3. Continue working on your changes

The auto-fix workflow helps maintain code quality by catching and fixing common issues automatically, so you can focus on the logic of your changes.

**Note**: The workflow only runs on PRs from branches in the main repository, not on PRs from forks (due to security restrictions on pushing to fork branches).

## Before Submitting a Commit

Before submitting a commit, ensure that the CI checks pass by running:

```bash
cargo xtask ci
```

This command will run all CI checks including:

- `cargo xtask ci fmt` - Check code formatting (automatically installs nightly rustfmt for import sorting)
- `cargo xtask ci clippy` - Run clippy lints
- `cargo xtask ci udeps` - Check for unused dependencies (automatically installs nightly and cargo-udeps if needed)
- `cargo xtask ci test` - Run the test suite

You can also run individual checks by specifying the subcommand, for example:

```bash
cargo xtask ci fmt
cargo xtask ci clippy
```

The test command supports passing additional arguments to cargo test:

```bash
cargo xtask ci test --no-default-features
```

## Leave the Codebase Better Than You Found It

**Always strive to keep CI green.** A passing CI build gives everyone confidence that the codebase is in a good state.

### Fix Existing CI Failures

If you encounter failing CI checks (e.g., Clippy warnings, rustfmt issues, failing tests) that are **unrelated to your current task**, fix them as part of your change. Don't ignore them or work around them.

**Why this matters:**

- Broken CI creates a culture of ignoring failures
- Unfixed issues accumulate and become harder to resolve
- Green CI signals that the codebase is healthy and maintainable

### Guidelines

- **Before starting**: Run `cargo xtask ci` to check the current state
- **Fix unrelated issues**: If you see Clippy warnings or formatting issues in files you're working on or nearby, fix them
- **Don't introduce new issues**: Always run CI checks before committing to ensure your changes don't break anything
- **When in doubt**: It's better to fix an extra issue than to leave the codebase worse than you found it

This applies to all types of CI failures:

- Rustfmt formatting issues (`cargo xtask fmt`)
- Clippy lints (`cargo xtask ci clippy`)
- Failing tests (`cargo xtask ci test`)
- Unused dependencies (`cargo xtask ci udeps`)

## After Completing Work

After completing work on a task from a crate's status document (e.g., `crates/crate-name/STATUS.md`), update the status document to mark the task as complete. Use strikethrough (`~~`) to mark the task title and add checkmarks (`[x]`) to indicate completed sub-items.

## PR Title Guidelines

When creating or updating pull requests, use semantic commit conventions in PR titles to clearly communicate the nature of the changes:

```
<type>: <description>
```

### Common Types

- `feat`: A new feature or capability
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing behavior
- `docs`: Documentation changes only
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, tooling changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `style`: Code style/formatting changes (not CSS)

### Examples

```
feat: add syntax node tracking to runtime values
fix: resolve type mismatch in comparison operators
refactor: unify macro and special form types
docs: update AGENTS.md with semantic commit guidelines
test: add snapshot tests for error diagnostics
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

Use lowercase for the type and description. Keep the description concise and imperative (e.g., "add" not "added" or "adds").

## Test Writing Guidelines

When writing tests, follow these principles to ensure high-quality, maintainable test code:

### What to Test

- **Focus on behavior, not implementation**: Test observable behavior and contracts, not internal implementation details
- **Test complex logic and edge cases**: Prioritize testing non-trivial logic, error handling, and boundary conditions
