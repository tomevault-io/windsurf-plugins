# PowerArgs development notes

## Generated argument models

- The source-generated pipeline is opt-in by shape: the scaffold class and its public argument properties are declared `partial`, and the argument properties are partial properties whose bodies are supplied by `PowerArgs.Generator`.
- Generated models have two compile-time-selected tiers. Simple scalar models use `GeneratedArgumentParser`; feature-rich models still generate their definition, construction, setters, and main invoker but reuse `Args.ParseInternal` for the mature hook/parser lifecycle. Keep this shared-parser generated tier for prompting and conditional requirements, collections, secure arguments, inheritance, custom revivers/validators/hooks, sticky values, tab completion, unexpected arguments, and other constructible metadata instead of falling all the way back to reflected scaffold mapping.
- Generated invocation supports parameterless `Main` methods and `[ArgActionMethod]` methods returning either `void` or `Task`. Actions may be parameterless, take one action-argument object with supported public scalar properties, or take multiple directly revivable scalar parameters. Action argument metadata, shortcuts, descriptions, positions, validation, and case rules are emitted too. Unsupported signatures deliberately fall back to reflection.
- A generated definition must preserve the aliases and validator behavior of the reflection definition. Keep paired core tests for generated and reflection-backed models when expanding attribute coverage.
- Pipeline selection is static: the generator chooses the direct generated parser, the shared-parser generated tier, or full reflection from compile-time shape and metadata. Runtime command-line values must never change that selection; valid legacy syntax is handled on the selected pipeline and invalid input produces compatible errors there.
- For the supported scalar types, generated parsing uses `GeneratedArgumentParser` directly and keeps only a thread-local definition for ambient parse metadata. Inputs or metadata outside that narrow fast-path contract must continue through the existing parser.
- Both generated tiers avoid reflected scaffold discovery, activation, and property assignment. The direct tier additionally avoids the allocation-heavy general hook/alias machinery; the shared-parser tier deliberately retains it for behavioral compatibility. Do not make the full reflection fallback depend on generated code.
- Type-based reflection parsing reuses definitions per thread when they contain no hooks beyond the exact built-in default-value attributes. Keep `CommandLineArgumentsDefinition.Clean()` complete as mutable parse state is added; models containing other or derived hooks deliberately receive fresh reflected definitions.
- Keep performance measurements in `PowerArgs.Benchmarks`; do not turn timing thresholds into unit tests. Pass `--parse-only`, `--invoke-only`, or `--conversion-only` after `--` to isolate a suite and add `--profile` to collect EventPipe CPU traces.

## Help template language

- `DocumentToken` uses a document-specific linear scanner. Keep it instance-free and thread-safe; the general `Tokenizer<T>` is still used by object-path parsing and must retain growable per-instance buffers without process-wide string interning.
- Template parsing validates and compiles nested bodies eagerly. Invalid closing tags must fail even inside a branch that is false at render time, and closing tag names must match their opener.
- `DocumentRenderer` caches compiled templates by template text and source location while the built-in expression set is unchanged. Registering or unregistering an expression provider disables compiled-document reuse for that renderer, preserving the legacy contract that custom providers create a fresh expression per render.
- Built-in document expressions append to a shared render buffer to avoid quadratic immutable `ConsoleString` concatenation. Custom `IDocumentExpression` implementations remain compatible through the public `Evaluate` fallback.
- Durable template coverage lives under `PowerArgsTestCore\Templating`. Run template benchmarks with `dotnet run -c Release --project PowerArgs.Benchmarks -- --template-only`; add `--profile` for EventPipe traces.
