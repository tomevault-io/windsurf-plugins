# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code (or any AI coding agent) working in this repo.

## What this is

A native Swift/SwiftUI macOS menu bar app that shows Claude usage and Claude
Code activity at a glance, built pure-SwiftPM (no Xcode project).

## Architecture: 3 targets

Defined in `Package.swift`:

- **`StatusBarCore`** (library) — all business logic: account discovery,
  usage fetching/caching, session aggregation, hook event handling, settings
  persistence, and menu-bar label text/color formatting. This is the *only*
  target with tests (`Tests/StatusBarCoreTests/`, one file per source file).
- **`ClaudeStatusBar`** (executable) — the SwiftUI menu bar app. Depends on
  `StatusBarCore`. Kept as thin as possible: views read from `AppState` and
  `SettingsStore`, they don't contain logic worth unit-testing on their own.
- **`ClaudeStatusHook`** (executable) — the `claude-status-hook` binary that
  Claude Code invokes on session events. Also depends on `StatusBarCore`.

New logic goes in `StatusBarCore` with a matching test file, not in either
executable — that's what keeps almost the entire app reachable from a fast
unit test suite despite the two executables having no tests of their own.

## Build and test

CLT-only (Command Line Tools), no Xcode required, macOS 14+, Swift 6 tools
with `.v5` language mode per target.

```sh
make build   # swift build (debug)
make test    # swift test — full StatusBarCoreTests suite
make app     # dist/ClaudeStatusBar.app (release build + bundle)
make dmg     # dist/ClaudeStatusBar.dmg
```

`swift-testing` is pinned at `exact: "0.12.0"` in `Package.swift` rather than
tracking latest — this is a CLT-only environment with no Xcode to manage
toolchain/package version drift, so the pin keeps `swift test` reproducible
across machines and CI. Only the `@Test`/`@Suite`/`#expect`/`#require` API
available at that version is usable — don't reach for newer swift-testing
features (e.g. exit tests, custom traits) when writing tests here.

## Non-obvious constraints worth knowing before you touch this code

- **`LabelComposite` bakes the whole menu bar label into one `NSImage`.**
  `MenuBarExtra` flattens its `label` closure into the status button's single
  image slot plus title — only the first `Image` survives and it always
  precedes any text. A multi-view `HStack` can't express text-first ordering
  or keep the icon once the activity text is itself an image (the shimmer
  effect). `LabelComposite.image(...)` composites icon + activity text +
  usage text into one image explicitly instead of fighting that constraint.
- **`NSApp` is `nil` during `ClaudeStatusBarApp.init()`.** It's too early in
  the SwiftUI `App` lifecycle; `NSApplication.shared` creates the app object
  on first access, which is why `init()` calls
  `NSApplication.shared.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)` rather than
  `NSApp?.setActivationPolicy(...)`.
- **`AppState`'s ticker is a plain `Task` loop, not a `TimelineView`.** A
  periodic `TimelineView` inside the `MenuBarExtra` label re-anchors its
  schedule to `.now` on every label re-render, so the first scheduled entry
  is always already due — the main thread spins at 100% CPU and the status
  item never finishes appearing (observed on macOS 26). `AppState.tick`
  advances on a `Task.sleep` loop instead, throttled to 33ms (30fps) while
  activity text needs shimmer frames on the bar, or 1Hz for icon-only/compact
  styles where nothing sub-second is visible.
- **The hook binary must never fail Claude Code.** `ClaudeStatusHook`'s
  `main.swift` swallows every error into a silent `exit(0)` — the hook is
  fire-and-forget from Claude Code's perspective and must never block or
  corrupt a session.
- **OAuth tokens are read from disk only at request time**, kept in a local
  variable, and never logged, cached, or written elsewhere (`AppState.token`).

## Workflow

Feature branch → PR into `main` → CI (`swift test` + hook integration test,
see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) must pass → owner review and merge. Never
push directly to `main`.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the human-facing contribution guide (test
expectations, code style, where to report bugs).
