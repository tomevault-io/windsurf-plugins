# FORA — AI-Assisted Contributor Guide (CLAUDE.md)

This file is a guide for AI assistants (like Claude, Gemini, Antigravity, Cursor, etc.) contributing to FORA. It outlines the codebase structure, build instructions, test commands, code style guidelines, and core constraints.

## 2. Commands & Testing

- **Dry-run generation (free, mock placeholders):**
  `node generate.js --dry-run briefs/example-brief.json`
- **Standard generation (needs API keys, runs AI codegen):**
  `node generate.js --run briefs/your-brief.json`
- **Publish generation (runs codegen + deploys to Vercel):**
  `node generate.js --publish briefs/your-brief.json`
- **Deploy existing output (skip codegen, redeploy HTML):**
  `node generate.js --deploy briefs/your-brief.json`
- **Run regression tests (dry-run mode):**
  `./test/regression.sh --dry-run`
- **Run regression tests (live AI generation mode):**
  `./test/regression.sh`
- **Run environment health check:**
  `./setup.sh --check`

## 3. Code Style & Rules

1. **Zero External Dependencies:** The core node engine (`generate.js`) must not import any non-native packages. Use built-in Node.js modules like `fs`, `path`, `crypto`, and native `fetch` (Node 18+).
2. **First-Person Voice for Copy:** AI-generated framing text (`{{framing_line}}`) must always be written in the first person ("I did X", not "He did X" or "The candidate did X").
3. **No em-dashes (—):** Banned from AI copy generation rules. Use plain hyphens/dashes (-) or rewrite the sentence to avoid them.
4. **HTML Slots:** Slots on sections must match variables defined in templates. When slot values are empty/null/false, they should be fully omitted rather than showing TBD/empty placeholders.
5. **Strict Local Privacy:** Personal candidate profiles (`profile.json`), saved application briefs (`briefs/*.json`), generated outputs (`output/`), and configuration `.env` are private. They are gitignored and must never be staged or committed.

## 4. Architecture Decisions (Do Not Alter)

- **Per-Section Codegen:** We call the LLM separately for each section rather than in one monolithic call. This isolates failures and improves section-specific instruction following. Keep this architecture intact.
- **Clipboard workflow:** Brainstorm relies on clipboard copying for external LLM chat interaction. Do not attempt to replace the CLI clipboard flow with an automated browser/API agent for brainstorm in V1.
- **Base64 media URIs:** Images are resolved to base64 data URIs so that the generated index.html is completely self-contained. Keep this to avoid complex asset path deployment management.
