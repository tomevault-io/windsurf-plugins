# CLAUDE.md - Memex App

This file is a pointer. The system of record is Memex itself.

## Where Memex lives (prod is live as of 2026-05-24)

The platform is deployed and the workspace has moved. INT is no longer the source of truth.

| Surface | URL |
|---|---|
| **Production app** (React UI + API + MCP) | `https://memex.ai/<namespace>/<memex>/...` |
| **Staging app (int)** | `https://int.memex.ai/<namespace>/<memex>/...` |
| **Marketing site** | `https://www.memex.ai/` |
| **MCP endpoint** (prod / int) | `https://memex.ai/mcp` · `https://int.memex.ai/mcp` |

**This codebase's Memex is now `mindset-prod/memex-building-itself`** (web: `https://memex.ai/mindset-prod/memex-building-itself`). It was migrated from the old `mindset-int/memex-app` on 2026-05-24 via direct SQL (b-65) — the memex was renamed (`memex-app` → `memex-building-itself`) and rehomed under the `mindset-prod` namespace, with all UUIDs and `b-N`/`std-N` handles preserved. The old INT workspace at `mindset-int/memex-app` remains readable for reference only; each INT doc carries a breadcrumb comment pointing at its PROD counterpart. Full infra + routing topology lives in std-9.

## How to orient (every session)

Memex hosts the Briefs, Standards, decisions, and tasks that describe this codebase. **The Memex MCP tools are your primary source of truth — not this file.**

```
mcp__memex__search_memex({memex: "mindset-prod/memex-building-itself", query: "<topic>"})
mcp__memex__list_docs({memex: "mindset-prod/memex-building-itself", docType: "standard"})
mcp__memex__get_doc({ref: "mindset-prod/memex-building-itself/standards/std-N"})
```

`search_memex` is semantic + FTS across all Briefs, Standards, and Decisions. Filter with `kind: "standard"` for rules, `kind: "decision"` for prior reasoning. When you're about to claim a fact — schema shape, route surface, auth flow, deployment topology, agent behaviour — search Standards first.

## Standards index

| Standard | Covers |
|---|---|
| std-1 | Namespace / org / memex are three distinct concepts — plus user-facing vocabulary and handle conventions (`b-N` / `doc-N` / `std-N` / `s-N` / `dec-N` / `t-N` / `c-N`). |
| std-2 | Tenant routing is path-based on the apex domain — never subdomains. |
| std-3 | Namespace slug allocation (format, reserved list, rate limits, rename cooldown). |
| std-4 | Org membership grants access to every Memex in the org (v1 access model). |
| std-5 | No silent namespace default — ambiguous MCP / middleware calls error. |
| std-6 | Domain-based auto-join requires explicit user consent. |
| std-7 | Unauthorized resource access returns 404, not 403. |
| std-8 | Every mutation goes through `mutate()` and emits on the unified bus (real-time SSE). |
| std-9 | Infrastructure: int + prod GCP projects (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, buckets, secrets, DNS) + local development. |
| std-10 | Canonical URL paths for Memex entities (the `ref` grammar). |
| std-11 | AI agent: direct Anthropic SDK on server, LangGraph in React UI. |
| std-12 | Service architecture — bounded components and how they wire. |
| std-13 | Native authentication: hand-rolled JWT + scrypt + auth_tokens + Postmark. |
| std-14 | Per-domain debug logging convention (`packages/server/.logs/<domain>.log`). |
| std-15 | Agent prompts live in `packages/server/src/agent/phases/` markdown, never inline in code. |
| std-16 | The coding-agent tool contract has one source — the `@memex/shared` manifest. |
| std-17 | Smoke tests are mandatory and run against live envs — int after every deploy, green before prod. |
| std-19 | Specs are SDD's canonical artifact — every unit of work is a Spec; "Spec" is the noun. |
| std-20 | Spec-Driven Development — drift is the enemy; the Spec is a living node in a knowledge map. |
| std-21 | Branch structure — `develop` integrates work; `main` is the production line (fast-forward only, branch-bound deploy targets, main-only licence carve-out). |
| std-22 | Everything we ship runs against arbitrary codebases — portable artifacts (prompts, scaffold prose, Prompt Buttons, Init Prompts, in-repo tools) assume no language, framework, layout, file paths, or tooling. |
| std-24 | One version per shared library across the pnpm workspace, enforced by `pnpm.overrides` (today: vitest, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `@types/node`). Exact pins in each package's devDependencies; new dep families added to the root overrides. |
| std-27 | Charts & data-viz: one theme-aware palette + glass treatment — `useChartPalette()`/`insightsTheme` from `packages/ui/src/components/insights/theme.ts`, reserved hue semantics, translucent fills with crisp edges, integer count ticks, themed tooltips, noise excluded server-side. |
