# Project maintenance skills

Before using a DSH plugin lifecycle skill in this repository, read `skills/README.md` for its source, version, and project-specific applicability. Prefer the project copy when a global skill has the same name.

Vendored skills are community guidance. Historical version examples are not the current support policy; verify exact Harness tags, npm artifacts, the resolved dependency graph, and AgentTeams behavior. Preserve upstream skill files; record local integration rules separately.

User instructions and authorization take precedence over skill defaults. Do not repeat confirmation for work the user has already authorized.

# Browser automation

For interactive browser automation, use the `ego-browser` skill from Ego Lite. Do not use `agent-browser` or another browser-control skill unless the user explicitly requests it or Ego Lite is unavailable.
