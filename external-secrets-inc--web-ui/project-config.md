  <objective>
  Enforce a diagnostic-first discipline when resolving bugs: enumerate 5–7 plausible sources, narrow to the 1–2 most likely, and add targeted logs to validate assumptions before implementing any code fix.
  </objective>

  <scope_and_triggers>
    <summary>When This Rule Applies</summary>
    <details>
    - Applies whenever a bug is reported, reproduced, or suspected across app layers (UI, services, backend).
    - Triggers at the start of a bug task and repeats if initial hypotheses are falsified.
    - This rule MUST be followed before any code changes are made to fix the bug.
    </details>
  </scope_and_triggers>

  <core_principles>
    <principle name="breadth_before_depth">
      <summary>Generate 5–7 Distinct, Plausible Sources</summary>
      <details>
      - MUST list 5–7 plausible sources before narrowing down.
      - Consider diverse categories: UI state, data fetching, API contracts, concurrency, auth, environment, side effects, backend invariants.
      - Each hypothesis MUST be distinct and address a different potential root cause.
      </details>
    </principle>

    <principle name="evidence_before_edits">
      <summary>Validate Hypotheses with Instrumentation Before Changing Logic</summary>
      <details>
      - MUST add targeted diagnostic logs to falsify/confirm the top hypotheses.
      - Code changes to fix the bug MUST NOT be implemented until hypotheses are validated.
      - Logs MUST be designed to unambiguously confirm or falsify each hypothesis.
      </details>
    </principle>

    <principle name="sensitivity_aware_logging">
      <summary>Never Log Secrets/PII; Follow Console Log Policies</summary>
      <details>
      - MUST follow Console Log Management Guidelines for sensitive data handling.
      - MUST redact or omit sensitive fields; prefer whitelisting safe fields.
      - MUST use correlation/session IDs to tie flows together without exposing sensitive data.
      </details>
    </principle>

    <principle name="cleanup_discipline">
      <summary>Remove Temporary Logs Once Validated or When Task Nears Completion</summary>
      <details>
      - Temporary diagnostic logs MUST be removed when the diagnostic objective is achieved.
      - MUST follow Console Log Management Guidelines for removal timing.
      - Only structured warnings/errors that are long-term useful SHOULD be preserved.
      </details>
    </principle>
  </core_principles>

  <process>
    <step name="reproduce_and_baseline">
      <summary>Step 1: Establish Reliable Reproduction</summary>
      <details>
      - MUST reproduce the bug and capture minimal steps, environment, and baseline observations.
      - MUST document errors, network traces, inputs/outputs, and any error signatures.
      - If not reproducible, MUST first establish a reliable reproduction before proceeding.
      </details>
    </step>

    <step name="hypothesize_broadly">
      <summary>Step 2: List 5–7 Plausible Sources</summary>
      <details>
      - MUST generate 5–7 distinct hypotheses covering:
        1. UI state/prop flow and memoization
        2. Data fetching layer (query keys, caching, staleness)
        3. API contract mismatches (shape, status codes, timeouts)
        4. Concurrency/race conditions (effects, debounced handlers)
        5. Auth/permissions/feature flags/tenancy
        6. Environment/config differences (dev/prod, region, time zone)
        7. Side effects: local storage, retries, re-renders
        8. Backend invariants/data quality, pagination, sorting
        9. Error handling and edge-case branching
      - Each hypothesis MUST be specific and address a different potential root cause.
      </details>
    </step>

    <step name="converge_to_most_likely">
      <summary>Step 3: Select 1–2 Most Likely Hypotheses</summary>
      <details>
      - MUST prioritize 1–2 hypotheses based on:
        - Proximity to recent changes
        - Error signatures/stack traces
        - Boundary crossings (client/server, async boundaries)
        - Data flow chokepoints (selectors, transformations, adapters)
        - Similar prior incidents
      - MUST provide rationale for why these hypotheses are most likely.
      </details>
    </step>

    <step name="instrument_before_fix">
      <summary>Step 4: Add Targeted Diagnostic Logs</summary>
      <details>
      - MUST add logs designed to falsify/confirm the top hypotheses.
      - MUST follow Console Log Management Guidelines (sensitive data, grouping, tidy formatting).
      - MUST use:
        - Clear prefixes: [ComponentOrModule] [Hypothesis-ID]
        - console.groupCollapsed / groupEnd to scope sessions
        - Logging raw inputs/outputs at boundaries
        - Correlation/session IDs to tie flows together
      - MUST pause after instrumentation; DO NOT implement the fix yet.
      </details>
    </step>

    <step name="validate_hypotheses">
      <summary>Step 5: Confirm or Falsify Hypotheses</summary>
      <details>
      - MUST re-run the reproduction and examine logs.
      - MUST determine if each hypothesis is confirmed or falsified.
      - If falsified, MUST iterate: promote next hypothesis(es) and repeat instrumentation.
      - If confirmed, proceed to implement minimal fix (outside this rule's scope).
      </details>
    </step>

    <step name="cleanup_and_document">
      <summary>Step 6: Remove Temporary Logs and Document Findings</summary>
      <details>
      - MUST remove temporary diagnostic logs when objective is achieved.
      - MUST summarize validated hypothesis and evidence in PR description.
      - MUST ensure no sensitive data remains in logs.
