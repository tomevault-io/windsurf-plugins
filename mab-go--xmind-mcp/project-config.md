# Keep Documentation Current

If your change falls into any category in the table below, update the corresponding documentation before finishing.

## What triggers a doc update

| Change made | What to review/update |
|---|---|
| New file added or removed | `Project Structure` tree in `AGENTS.md` |
| New handler helper added to `handler.go` | Traversal/lookup utilities table in `AGENTS.md` |
| New tool registered | Conventions section in `AGENTS.md` if a new pattern is introduced |
| New struct field or codec allowlist entry | Schema Critical Notes in `AGENTS.md` |
| New convention established | `Conventions` section in `AGENTS.md` |
| New `.cursor/rules/` or `.cursor/skills/` file | Reflect in `AGENTS.md` if it affects agent behavior |

## Rule

If none of the above changes were made, no doc update is needed. Do not make cosmetic edits to demonstrate compliance — only update docs when something has genuinely changed.
