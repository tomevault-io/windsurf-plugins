# Forge

Forge is a collection of agent skills that define a structured, GitHub-centric development workflow. Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard.

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical project guidance file in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` is kept only as a compatibility symlink for tools that still look for that filename.

## Commands

There is no application code, build system, or test framework. The repository contains only SKILL.md prompt files.

```bash
git status                          # check working tree state
git diff                            # review changes before committing
gh issue list                       # list open issues
gh pr list                          # list open pull requests
```

## Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) | Skill workflow, file format, role format, design decisions |
| [Development](docs/development.md) | How to create and modify skills |
| [Coding Guidelines](docs/coding-guidelines.md) | Skill authoring conventions and style rules |
| [Testing](docs/testing.md) | How to validate skills manually |
| [PR Workflow](docs/pr-workflow.md) | Commits, PRs, branch naming, review process |

**Update docs when you change skill conventions or add new skills.**

## Core Principles

1. **Skills are prompts, not code** — every SKILL.md is a reusable prompt template with YAML frontmatter and step-by-step instructions
2. **Explore-first, ask-second** — skills should always analyze the codebase before asking the user questions
3. **Never invent content** — use `<!-- TODO -->` markers rather than generating generic boilerplate
4. **Conventional commits everywhere** — every skill enforces the same commit, branch, issue, and PR naming format
5. **Standards first, compatibility second** — prefer `AGENTS.md` and Agent Skills conventions; keep vendor-specific compatibility lightweight
6. **One invocation convention** — skills with structured primary input should support optional trailing execution context via `-- <additional context>` when additional guidance is useful
7. **Plan before code** — for complex work, research the codebase objectively and align on architecture before writing implementation; delegate research to sub-agents for unbiased findings
8. **Mind the instruction budget** — keep skills under ~35 instructions; delegate to sub-agents when complexity grows
