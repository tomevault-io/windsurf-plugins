# TokenHub Agent Guide

## Repository overview

TokenHub is a private enterprise AI gateway with a Go backend, a Next.js admin console, SDK smoke tests, a YAML model catalog, and Docker Compose deployment files.

- `backend/`: Go HTTP API, SQLite/GORM persistence, routing, authentication, administration, and backend tests.
- `frontend/`: Next.js and React admin console.
- `sdk/`: Node.js smoke tests for the OpenAI-compatible API and security policy endpoints.
- `data/model-catalog.yaml`: tracked model catalog source.
- `deploy/`: Docker Compose deployment and environment template.
- `docs/`: English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese documentation.

## Development commands

Run backend checks from `backend/`:

```bash
gofmt -w <changed-go-files>
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

Run frontend checks from `frontend/`:

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Run the repository gates from the repository root. These enforce the change guidelines below, so a failure names the rule that was broken:

```bash
node --test tools/*.test.mjs
node tools/check-doc-translations.mjs
node tools/check-ui-translations.mjs
node tools/check-env-contract.mjs
node tools/check-source-lines.mjs
```

The translation gate compares the pull request base against its head. Outside CI there is usually no base to compare against, so it runs the existence half and reports that the rest was skipped; pass `--base <sha> --head <sha>` to run it in full.

Run SDK smoke tests from `sdk/` only when a compatible backend is available and the required environment variables are configured:

```bash
npm ci
npm run test:deepseek
npm run test:anthropic-messages
npm run test:security-policy
```

Start the full local development stack from the repository root with `./start.sh`. Start the containerized stack with the commands documented in `docs/deployment.md`.

## Optional development workflows

TokenHub provides two optional AI-agent workflows:

| Workflow | Intended use | Instructions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fast-dev` | Small, well-scoped, low-risk changes that do not alter public APIs, persistence, authentication or authorization, deployment, or cross-component behavior | [docs/development/workflows/fast-dev.md](docs/development/workflows/fast-dev.md) |
| `feature-dev` | Important features, user-visible behavior, cross-component changes, public API or data-model changes, security-sensitive work, deployment changes, broad refactors, or work that needs an architectural decision | [docs/development/workflows/feature-dev.md](docs/development/workflows/feature-dev.md) |

Use a workflow only when the user explicitly names it; otherwise follow the normal repository guidance. Read only the selected workflow before editing. If `fast-dev` no longer fits, ask before switching to `feature-dev`. Workflow selection never authorizes commits, pushes, pull requests, merges, or other external writes.

## Change guidelines

- Keep changes focused and preserve unrelated work in the checkout.
- Add or update tests for backend behavior changes. Prefer in-process fake HTTP or SMTP servers over external network dependencies.
- Preserve API compatibility for the OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoints unless the task explicitly changes the contract.
- Treat authentication, API keys, provider credentials, reset tokens, audit payloads, forwarded headers, and exported data as security-sensitive.
- Never commit real credentials, local `.env` files, SQLite databases, generated backups, or runtime logs.
- Keep environment variable additions synchronized across relevant `.env.example` files, `deploy/docker-compose.yml`, `start.sh`, and deployment documentation.
- Keep user-facing documentation synchronized across English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese when changing shared behavior.
- Treat Simplified Chinese as the canonical UI copy passed to `tx("...")`; every literal UI key must have both English and Japanese entries. Keep protocol names, identifiers, units, and user/provider content untranslated when they are data rather than interface copy.
- Do not hard-code user-visible prose in React views. Add it to the translation catalog in the same change; `node --test tools/ui-translations.test.mjs` enforces literal `tx("...")` coverage.
- Build dynamic sentences with locale-aware helpers or complete translated templates rather than concatenating translated fragments. Format user-visible dates, times, numbers, and currencies with `languageLocale()` and `Intl` so they follow the selected application language.
- A few source files are over the line-count ceiling and are frozen at their current size in the `FROZEN` table in `tools/source-lines.mjs`. Avoid broad formatting or unrelated restructuring in them when making a targeted fix; `node tools/check-source-lines.mjs` reports which files are affected.
- Next.js may rewrite `frontend/next-env.d.ts` during development or production builds. Do not commit incidental mode-dependent changes to that generated file.
- Keep `data/model-catalog.yaml` tracked; other files under runtime data directories are intentionally ignored.
