description: Route repo-context-mcp calls through context broker first
---


Use repo-context-mcp v2 as a context broker.

Order:

1. Use `context_status` if unsure whether index/cache exists.
2. Use `context_pack` first with `budgetTokens: 1000`.
3. Use `impact_pack` for changed files/diff tasks.
4. Use `get_symbol_context` only for exact function/class verification.
5. Use `graph_query` / `graph_symbol` only if `context_pack` is insufficient.
6. Use `search_code` / `repo_map` only if context/graph are missing or insufficient.
7. Read full files only when editing or verifying exact implementation details.

Warning:
If telemetry shows `repo_map`/`search_code` as dominant discovery tools, routing is not using v2 correctly.
