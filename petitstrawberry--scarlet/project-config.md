This is the repository for the Scarlet project. 
which implements a transparent ABI conversion layer for executing binaries across different operating systems and architectures.

## Code Standards

### Required Before Each Commit
- Ensure all tests pass before committing changes.

### Development Flow
Use the docker container of ` scarlet-dev` for development to ensure a consistent environment.
If the image is not available, you can build it using the provided Dockerfile in the repository.

❗️ Before installing additional package such as cargo-make, qemu, etc., please **make sure** that the scarlet-dev image is available in your environment!
If the image is available, use the following command
- docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspaces/Scarlet scarlet-dev cargo make build-riscv64`.

Executing commands in the Docker container at the root of the repository:
- Build: `cargo make build-riscv64`

#### Testing
Use the root workspace tasks to run the full test suite:
- `cargo make test-riscv64`
- `cargo make test-aarch64`

These tasks run the full kernel test suite for each architecture.
Ensure all tests pass before committing changes to maintain code integrity.

## Key guidelines
- Use `cargo make` for all commands to ensure consistency.
- Ensure all tests pass before committing changes.
- Follow the existing code style and structure.
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the changes made.
- Avoid making changes that break existing functionality without providing a clear migration path or explanation.
- Document any new features or changes in the codebase in English. Refer to existing documentation for style and format.
- Comment rust-doc style for public functions and modules to maintain clarity.
- Write tests for new features or changes to ensure they work as expected. This project is `no_std`, so tests should be written in a way that does not rely on the standard library and their tests should be written as `#[test_case]` to ensure compatibility with `no_std`.
- Commit changes frequently to avoid large, unwieldy commits.
