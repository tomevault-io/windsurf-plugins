# Project Stickman

A browser-based first-person hostage-rescue game ("Operation Safe Return") with a paper-and-ink look. TypeScript, Three.js (WebGL, unlit surfaces + screen-space outlines), Vite, Preact. No backend.

## Commands

```sh
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # tsc --noEmit && vite build — this is the typecheck; run it after every change
npm test             # every scripts/*-checks.ts in Node (~45 s), prints ok/FAIL per file; rerun a FAIL with node scripts/check-player.mjs <file>
npm run test:<area>  # focused suite, see table
```

## Agent resources

- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical repository-wide guidance for coding agents.
- `.agent/` contains repository-owned workflow notes. Before verifying visible changes, read the [browser-check workflow](.agent/skills/browser-check/SKILL.md); do not rely on automatic directory discovery.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a compatibility pointer to this file; keep shared guidance here instead of duplicating it.
- Generated screenshots, recordings, and browser evidence belong in `artifacts/`, never in source or documentation directories.

## Layout

- `index.html` → `src/main.ts`: the game. `/?explore=1` is free exploration + experimental Quest WebXR. `/?view=overview` (also `yard`, `rail`, `tanks`, `plan`, `roof`, `mess`, `office`, `water`, `watch`) are inspection camera bookmarks.
- `lab.html` → `src/lab/main.ts`: character/animation lab. **The lab rig, clips and postures are shared with the game's enemies and hostage — an animation change affects both.** Read `src/lab/README.md` first.
- `src/game/`: mission runtime (`runtime.ts`, `mission.ts`), AI, weapons, HUD/menu, audio, effects. Tunables live in `balance.ts`.
- `src/world/`: compound geometry built in code from plan coordinates (0.15 m per reference pixel, north = −Z).
- `src/player/`: capsule controller, collision trees, ladders. Physics substeps are ≤ 1/120 s.
- `src/render/ink.ts`: the shared paper/ink materials. Use these; don't create ad-hoc materials.
- `public/`: `models/stickman.glb` (the one skinned character), `sounds/` (see `public/sounds/CREDITS.md`).
- `scripts/*-checks.ts`: Node logic checks. `scripts/check-*.js`, `capture-*.js`, route scripts: browser checks (see below). `scripts/agent-browser.mjs` provides the portable browser CLI launcher used by runtime checks.
- `localonly/` and `artifacts/` are git-ignored scratch space. Put screenshots and evidence there, never in the repo.

## Conventions and gotchas

- **Style:** pure white paper `#ffffff`, ink `#000000` / `#808080` / `#bdbdbd`. NPCs are solid black, the hostage is blue `#2878d0`, blood is solid red. Structural strokes are 2.2 CSS px and taper with distance. Never render mesh tessellation as wireframe.
- The stickman must read as one continuous body — no visible joints or separate limb meshes.
- Collision extraction skips `ShaderMaterial` meshes. Keep solid material types on anything that must block movement.
- Physics `dt` is capped at 50 ms; cinematics and door/gate timing use real elapsed time. Test timing-sensitive work at 30/60/144 fps like the existing checks do.
- Respect the Reduced Motion setting for any new camera or screen effect.
- Mission state must restore on checkpoint retry and full restart — add new state to both paths.
- A logic check is a plain `.ts` file that imports from `src/` and throws on failure. `scripts/check-player.mjs <file>` bundles it with rolldown and runs it in Node (CSS imports are stubbed). Add new ones as `scripts/<topic>-checks.ts`; `npm test` picks them up automatically.
