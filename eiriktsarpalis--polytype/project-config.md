# AGENTS.md — PolyType.SourceGenerator

Scoped guidance for working inside the built-in incremental source generator. This complements the repository-root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md): the root rules still apply, and this file takes precedence for files under `src/PolyType.SourceGenerator/`.

## What This Project Is

`PolyType.SourceGenerator` is the built-in C# incremental source generator that emits `ITypeShape` implementations for types annotated with `[GenerateShape]` (and related attributes). It targets **netstandard2.0** because it ships as a Roslyn analyzer — do not use APIs unavailable on netstandard2.0 here.

## Dependency: PolyType.Roslyn

This project depends on **`PolyType.Roslyn`**, a general-purpose (but opinionated) component that builds a `TypeDataModel` from Roslyn symbol type graphs. It is deliberately decoupled from PolyType itself: any source generator that needs to reason about .NET types can consume it, and doing so does **not** require taking a runtime dependency on `PolyType.dll`. It ships as its own package for exactly this reason.

Because it is general-purpose, the `TypeDataModel`s it produces are **not** incremental-safe — they may hold non-equatable or non-serializable data, including live Roslyn symbols. This project's job is to consume that model and project it into its own incremental-safe `Model/` types (described under Project Layout & Pipeline below).

> **PolyType.Roslyn models ≠ PolyType.SourceGenerator models.** They are distinct hierarchies with different design goals. Never feed a raw PolyType.Roslyn model (or a Roslyn symbol) into the incremental pipeline.

## Incremental Generator Requirements

Everything that flows through the incremental pipeline (the `Model/` types) **MUST** abide by the principles in the [Roslyn Incremental Generators Cookbook](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/incremental-generators.cookbook.md):

- **Use `record` types** for pipeline models to get structural equality for free. Never use classes with reference equality.
- **Never store Roslyn symbols** (`ISymbol`, `ITypeSymbol`, etc.) in pipeline models. Extract the information you need into equatable representations (strings, records, etc.).
- **Do not use standard collection types** (arrays, `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`) — they use reference equality. Use the equatable collections from `PolyType.Roslyn/IncrementalTypes/`:
  - `ImmutableEquatableArray<T>`
  - `ImmutableEquatableDictionary<TKey, TValue>`
  - `ImmutableEquatableSet<T>`
- Pipeline steps should short-circuit when models are unchanged, so the generator driver can reuse cached output.

## Project Layout & Pipeline

- **`PolyTypeGenerator.cs`** — the `[Generator]` entry point that wires up the incremental pipeline.
- **`PolyTypeKnownSymbols.cs`** — cached well-known symbol lookups.
- **`Parser/`** — drives model extraction. `Parser.cs` traverses the type graph (via PolyType.Roslyn) to resolve `TypeDataModel`s from the annotated symbols; `Parser.ModelMapper.cs` maps those resolved PolyType.Roslyn models into the source generator's own incremental-safe model types (`Model/`); `Parser.Diagnostics.cs` defines the reported diagnostics.
- **`Model/`** — the incremental-safe (record-based) model types.
- **`SourceFormatter/`** — emits the C# source, split by shape kind (`SourceFormatter.Object.cs`, `SourceFormatter.Enumerable.cs`, `SourceFormatter.Dictionary.cs`, etc.).
- **`Analyzers/`** — companion analyzers shipped alongside the generator.

Flow: `PolyTypeGenerator.cs` → `Parser` (Roslyn symbols → PolyType.Roslyn `TypeDataModel`s) → `Parser.ModelMapper` (PolyType.Roslyn models → incremental-safe `Model/` types) → `SourceFormatter` (incremental model → C# source).

## Separation of Concerns: Parser vs Formatter

The pipeline above has a strict division of labour, and keeping it strict is what makes the generator both correct and fast:

- **The parser maps symbols to the incremental model.** All inspection of Roslyn symbols and the compilation happens here. This is the only place that should reason about type semantics, resolve members, evaluate attributes, or decide what to emit.
- **The source formatter maps the incremental model to source code.** It is a straightforward pretty printer over the model and should not perform any nontrivial computation of its own.

Two rules follow from this:

- **The incremental model must not encapsulate any symbols or compilation objects.** Beyond the equatable-model requirements above, holding onto symbols defeats incremental caching and pins large Roslyn object graphs in memory — a real performance problem. Extract everything the formatter needs into plain, equatable data while parsing.
- **Nontrivial computation in the formatter is a design smell.** If the formatter finds itself computing something non-obvious (resolving a name, choosing a strategy, deriving a flag), that is a signal the computation belongs in the parser. Move it there and update the model to carry the result.
