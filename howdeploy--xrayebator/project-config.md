# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Xrayebator — automated Xray Reality VPN manager for bypassing DPI censorship in Russia. Single Bash script (`xrayebator`, ~2300 lines) that turns a VPS into a managed VPN server with interactive terminal UI. Deployed to Debian 10+/Ubuntu 20.04+ servers.

## Validation Commands

```bash
bash -n xrayebator              # Syntax check (MUST pass before commit)
jq empty config.json            # JSON validation for Xray config
xray -test -config config.json  # Xray config validation (on server only)
```

There are no automated tests. Validation is manual: create/delete profiles, check `ufw status`, `systemctl status xray`, test connections from client apps (v2rayNG, Shadowrocket).

## Architecture

### Single-file application

All logic lives in `xrayebator`. Supporting scripts (`install.sh`, `update.sh`, `uninstall.sh`) handle lifecycle but are not part of the runtime.

### Production paths

- `/usr/local/etc/xray/config.json` — Xray configuration (inbounds, routing, DNS)
- `/usr/local/etc/xray/profiles/*.json` — per-user profile metadata
- `/usr/local/etc/xray/.private_key`, `.public_key` — Reality keys (generated once at install, never regenerated)
- `/usr/local/bin/xrayebator` — symlink to the script

### Critical concept: Inbound vs Profile

An **inbound** is a port-level config block in `config.json` (tag: `inbound-443`). A **profile** is a user-facing JSON file with UUID/transport/SNI metadata. Multiple profiles can share one inbound (same port). SNI and fingerprint are **inbound-level** — changing them affects ALL profiles on that port. The function `update_all_profiles_on_port()` keeps profile JSONs in sync.

### Transport compatibility and flow

All TCP sub-types (`tcp`, `tcp-utls`, `tcp-xudp`, `tcp-mux`) map to network `"tcp"` and can coexist on one inbound (same port). But they require different `flow` values per client:

| Transport | network | flow |
|-----------|---------|------|
| tcp, tcp-utls, tcp-xudp | tcp | `xtls-rprx-vision` |
| tcp-mux | tcp | `""` (empty) |
| grpc | grpc | `""` (empty) |
| xhttp | xhttp | `""` (empty) |

Flow is determined by transport type in `add_inbound()`, NOT copied from existing clients. Mixing Vision and non-Vision transports on one port is valid — each client gets its own flow.

### XHTTP special case

XHTTP transport stores SNI in TWO places: `realitySettings.serverNames` AND `xhttpSettings.host`. Both MUST match. The function `update_transport_settings_for_sni()` handles this.

### Firewall port management

- `open_firewall_port(port, proto)` — idempotent, validates port, checks UFW
- `close_firewall_port(port, proto)` — only closes if port unused by any Xray inbound AND not in default ports list (22, 80, 443, 8443, 2053, etc.)

### Migration system

Marker files in `/usr/local/etc/xray/` (e.g. `.xhttp_migrated`, `.routing_v132_migrated`). Migrations run once on first `main_menu()` launch after upgrade. Add new migrations with a marker file check.

### Add-on services

- **AdGuard Home** (menu item 7): Standalone binary at `/opt/AdGuardHome/`, systemd service, Web UI on 127.0.0.1:3000 (SSH tunnel only), DNS on 0.0.0.0:53. Xray config points DNS to 127.0.0.1 when integrated.

## Coding Patterns

**Language**: Bash. Dependencies: `jq`, `curl`, `ufw`, `systemctl`, `openssl`, `uuidgen`.

**Variables**: Always quote (`"$var"`), always `local` in functions.

**Safe JSON writes** — use `safe_jq_write()` for ALL jq modifications to config.json and profile files. It validates output is non-empty before `mv`, preventing data loss on jq errors:
```bash
safe_jq_write --arg uuid "$uuid" --argjson port "$port" \
  '(.inbounds[] | select(.port == $port) | .settings.clients) += [{"id": $uuid}]' \
  "$CONFIG_FILE"
```
Do NOT use raw `jq ... > temp && mv temp file` — always go through `safe_jq_write`.

**jq argument passing**: Use `--argjson` for numeric ports, `--arg` for strings. Never interpolate variables into jq expressions.

**Error handling in create_profile**: `add_inbound()` can fail (transport conflict, SNI conflict rejection). `create_profile()` checks the return code and deletes the profile file on failure. Always check `add_inbound` return.

**Client counting**: When checking if an inbound has remaining clients (e.g. before deleting the entire inbound), count via `config.json` clients array, NOT by counting profile files on disk. Profile files can be out of sync.

**Menu pattern**: `while true; do show_ascii; ... read choice; case $choice in ... 0) return ;; esac; done`

**Colors**: `RED` (errors), `GREEN` (success), `YELLOW` (warnings/prompts), `BLUE` (menu borders), `CYAN` (info/options), `MAGENTA` (section headers), `NC` (reset).

**Port validation**: `[[ ! "$port" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || [[ $port -lt 1 ]] || [[ $port -gt 65535 ]]`

## Branches

- `main` — stable, releases every 1-2 months
- `dev` — quick fixes, weekly
- `experimental` — latest features, daily (current working branch)

## Language

All user-facing strings, comments, and commit messages are in **Russian**. Code identifiers and function names are in English.
