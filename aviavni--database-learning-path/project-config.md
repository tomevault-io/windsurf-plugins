# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A self-paced database-internals learning path, rendered as an mdBook (`book.toml`, content in `topics/`, exercises in `capstone/`). `PLAN.md` is the curriculum plan — 45 topics, the source of truth. `PROGRESS.md` tracks status and capstone milestones; `SESSION-LOG.md` is the detailed build log, one entry per topic, newest first. `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the topic package format and the conventions below.

## Working rules

- After editing content, build the book and verify it renders: diagrams (mermaid) must render without syntax errors and internal links must resolve. Do not report content work done without this check.
- For changes that apply across many topics, do 1-2 topics first and ask for review before applying to all (then parallelize).
- The user cares primarily about performance-oriented depth; keep material practical and tied to real database implementations.

## Content rules

- **Never assert a number you did not verify.** Download and read the actual paper; cite the section or table it came from. If a figure cannot be checked against the source, it does not go in.
- **Every performance claim must come from code in this repo.** Write the experiment, run it, and record the measurement. `./verify.sh` runs every measured lane — a new topic's lane belongs in its `BENCHES` list, and the headline belongs in `FINDINGS.md`. Two topics (4, 10) deliberately have no lane because their benches measure only the reader's code; say so in the README rather than inventing a number.
- **A benchmark that prints an implausible number is a bug in the benchmark.** Topic 12 once reported 19,047,619 GB/s from a hoisted timing loop. `black_box` the inputs, and sanity-check any figure against the hardware's actual limits before recording it.
- **Report the negative result.** If a published technique does not reproduce on the local generator, that is the finding: say so, explain which premise is absent, and add an exercise that constructs the case where it holds. (Topic 42's multi-hit booster is the worked example; topic 3's non-step-function height ladder is another.)
- **Generators are seeded**, so every figure reproduces exactly apart from timings. Lockfiles are committed for the same reason.
- **Exercise lanes must degrade, not crash.** A bench binary on a fresh clone prints its provided lanes and a `[stub — ...]` note for the rest, and exits 0. Never let a `todo!()` panic hide a measurement above it.

## Reading-guide depth

The `reading-*.md` chapters teach from zero: a reader who knows systems but not the chapter's theory must be able to finish without leaving the page. `topics/00-performance-toolbox/reading-criterion.md` is the reference implementation of these rules; match it.

- **Define every term at first use.** A term of art (t-test, p-value, quartile, IQR, MAD, standard error, null hypothesis, arithmetic intensity, coordinated omission) gets a **bold** name and a one-sentence plain-language definition at the point it first appears, *before* any argument leans on it. A step may use only terms defined in an earlier step or defined on the spot. Borrowed jargon — using a word the guide never defined because the source material used it — is the failure this rule exists to stop.
- **Every step declares its input and output.** Each `### Step N` opens with a `> **In:** … **Out:** …` blockquote naming the dataset it consumes, *which earlier step produced it*, and what it emits. When one stage forks into two datasets used by different downstream steps, the fork gets its own numbered step. "Is this the same data as the previous section?" must never be left to the reader to infer.
- **A formula gets its symbols named and one worked example.** Quote it as the source actually computes it, name every symbol, then run it once on 3–5 concrete numbers so a real answer comes out. Arithmetic printed in a guide is verified like any other number in this repo — compute it, don't estimate it.
- **Anchors are verified against the pinned clone, file *and* line.** Citing the right line of the wrong file is the same error class as inventing a number. Re-grep every anchor before committing; state the version the line numbers belong to.
- **A quoted snippet carries the line numbers it actually occupies, and names the one to look at.** Put the real number in the gutter of every line, mark elided ranges (`// ... 131–139: bookkeeping ...`) rather than silently closing a gap, and say in the prose which line carries the argument ("the line to focus on is 277, its only `return`"). A snippet anchored to the function signature while quoting code forty lines below it leaves the reader unable to find anything. Pseudocode gets a `// ILLUSTRATION — not quoted from the crate` header and a pointer to the real code.
