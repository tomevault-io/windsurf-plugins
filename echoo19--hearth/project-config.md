# CLAUDE.md for Platformer Starter

This is a Hearth game project. **Read AGENTS.md for the full agent guide.**

Start of session (don't relearn the project every time):
- Read `.hearth/digest.md` — the engine's always-current snapshot of scenes,
  entities, scripts, and assets. Trust it instead of re-running `inspect` on
  everything; inspect one entity only when you need its full component data.
- `hearth recall` — durable decisions/todos/gotchas from past sessions. Record
  new ones with `hearth remember "<note>" --section decision|todo|gotcha`.

Quick facts:
- Use the `hearth` CLI (with `--json`) for all project operations; do not hand-edit
  `hearth.json`, `scenes/*.scene.json`, or `assets.json`.
- `hearth snapshot` before changes; `hearth validate --json` and `hearth diff` after.
- Behavior code lives in `scripts/`: **Lua by default** (`.js` also supported), edit freely.
  Lua calls ctx with a dot, not a colon: `ctx.log("hi")`. `hearth inspect api --json`
  documents the full ctx API — read it when scripting rather than from memory.
- Test with `hearth playtest <name>` and `hearth run <scene> --frames 120 --json`
  (run reports include `audioEvents` for checking sound behavior).
- **After a gameplay change:** `hearth sweep <scene>` runs seeded bots to catch softlocks and crashes.
- **See your work:** `hearth screenshot <scene>` renders a PNG — no build permission
  needed. Read it back to check layout before calling anything done.
  `hearth capture <scene> --to 120` renders a contact sheet across frames (motion
  over time); `hearth bench <scene>` reports per-frame ms to check 60fps.
- **Load the domain skill for the work at hand** (see AGENTS.md): `hearth-build`
  for world structure, `hearth-code` for scripting, `hearth-art` for assets,
  `hearth-feel` for polish, `hearth-design` for scope/pacing/completeness. Flat
  placeholder rectangles and static scenes are not "done" — animate, add feel,
  and screenshot to confirm.
- For an unfamiliar pack, load `hearth-art` before import and
  `hearth-build` before placement. Run
  `hearth inspect asset-pack <path> --json` / MCP `inspect_asset_pack`;
  read its `reviewImages` and diagnostics. Never guess tile adjacency or flatten
  unsupported isometric/depth metadata.
- `hearth create sound <name> --preset coin` makes procedural sound effects;
  `hearth export web [--single-file] [--zip]` makes a playable web build (needs build permission).
- Never delete assets/scenes without being asked.
