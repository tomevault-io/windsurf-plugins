# FastAPI Best Practices Guide

This rule outlines FastAPI best practices for the Zodiac Engine application based on our analysis. These practices align with the latest recommendations from FastAPI's documentation and community standards.

## Key Best Practices

### Dependencies Management
- Avoid using `fastapi[all]` in [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt)
- Use explicit version constraints for all dependencies

### Pydantic Usage
- Use latest Pydantic v2 syntax: `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]`
- Use updated Pydantic configuration: `model_config = {...}` instead of `class Config`
- Define clear schemas in [app/schemas](mdc:app/schemas) directory

### Dependency Injection
- Use `Annotated[Type, Depends()]` syntax in endpoint parameters
- Inject services as dependencies rather than using static methods
- Apply `@lru_cache` to expensive dependencies as seen in [app/core/dependencies.py](mdc:app/core/dependencies.py)

### Async/Sync Consistency
- Use `async def` only for endpoints that perform async I/O operations
- Keep service methods synchronous if they don't perform I/O
- Maintain consistent async/sync patterns throughout the codebase

### Error Handling
- Import from `fastapi import status` when setting status codes
- Use custom exception classes as defined in [app/core/exceptions.py](mdc:app/core/exceptions.py)
- Implement global exception handlers as in [app/core/error_handlers.py](mdc:app/core/error_handlers.py)

### API Response Options
- Use `response_model_exclude_unset=True` where appropriate
- Set proper status codes for different operations
- Document response schemas in API routes

### Performance 
- Use FastAPI's background tasks for long-running operations
- Implement caching for expensive calculations
