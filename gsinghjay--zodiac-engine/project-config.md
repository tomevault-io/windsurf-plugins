# FastAPI Testing Best Practices

This document outlines the recommended testing practices for the Zodiac Engine application.

## Test Structure

- **Test Organization**: Organize tests by API resources/endpoints (e.g., `test_chart_configuration.py`, `test_natal_chart_variations.py`).
- **Test Files**: Name test files with `test_` prefix.
- **Test Directory**: Keep all tests in the `tests/` directory at the project root.

## TestClient Usage

The primary way to test FastAPI endpoints is with the synchronous `TestClient` from `fastapi.testclient`. Most tests use this client directly.

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_read_endpoint():
    response = client.get("/some-endpoint")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"expected": "response"}
```

## Asynchronous Testing Considerations

- The `pytest-asyncio` plugin is installed.
- Test functions themselves should *not* use `async def` unless they directly `await` something *other* than client calls (which are synchronous with `TestClient`).
- For testing true async operations or if switching to `httpx.AsyncClient`, use `@pytest.mark.anyio` and `async def`.

```python
# Example IF using AsyncClient (not current practice)
# import pytest
# from httpx import AsyncClient
#
# @pytest.mark.anyio
# async def test_async_endpoint():
#     async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as ac:
#         response = await ac.get("/endpoint")
#     assert response.status_code == 200
```

## Using Fixtures

- Fixtures can be defined in individual test files or in `tests/conftest.py` for reuse.
- Currently, fixtures like `valid_natal_visualization_request` are defined within specific test files (e.g., [tests/test_static_images.py](mdc:tests/test_static_images.py)).
- The `TestClient` is instantiated directly in each test file rather than using a shared fixture.

```python
# Example fixture in a test file
@pytest.fixture
def test_data():
    return {
        "name": "Test Person",
        "birth_date": "1990-01-01T12:00:00",
        # other test data
    }

def test_using_fixture(test_data):
    response = client.post("/some-endpoint", json=test_data)
    # ... assertions ...
```

## Dependency Overrides

- FastAPI supports overriding dependencies for isolated testing, which is useful for mocking external services or databases.
- This is typically done using `app.dependency_overrides`.
- **Note**: This pattern is not currently used for service mocking (e.g., `AstrologyService`, `ChartVisualizationService`) in the existing test suite, but can be implemented if needed.

```python
# Example of overriding a dependency (conceptual)
# from app.main import app
# from app.core.dependencies import get_astrology_service
#
# def get_mock_astrology_service():
#     # Return a mock or test implementation
#     return MockAstrologyService()
#
# app.dependency_overrides[get_astrology_service] = get_mock_astrology_service
#
# # Run tests that use the overridden dependency
#
# # Clean up overrides after tests
# app.dependency_overrides = {}
```

## Best Practices

1.  **Test Both Success and Error Cases**: Verify correct behavior for both valid and invalid inputs.
2.  **Use Status Constants**: Use `fastapi.status` constants (e.g., `status.HTTP_200_OK`) instead of raw numbers.
3.  **Parameterized Testing**: Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for testing variations efficiently.
4.  **Mocking External Services**: If external dependencies (beyond Kerykeion, which is implicitly tested) are added, use `unittest.mock` or pytest's monkeypatch.
5.  **Testing File Operations**: For file generation (like SVGs), assert file existence and optionally check content. Consider mocking file system interactions for pure unit tests.
6.  **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage using `pytest-cov`.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

- Test all chart generation endpoints with various valid and invalid configurations.
- Verify SVG generation includes expected elements or text content.
- Ensure tests clean up generated files or use a dedicated test directory (currently handled by `setup_static_dir` fixture in `test_static_images.py`).
- Tests currently rely on the actual Kerykeion library execution. Mocking Kerykeion is an option for faster, more isolated unit tests in the future.
