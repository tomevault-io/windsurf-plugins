# Agent Instructions

> **temporal-contract** — Type-safe contract system for Temporal.io workflows and activities

This file is the source of truth for agent guidance in this repo. `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are symlinks to it.

## The 6 rules that prevent broken PRs

1. **Workflow code is deterministic.** No `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, `setTimeout`, `crypto.randomUUID()`, native I/O, or `process.env` reads inside `declareWorkflow`'s `implementation`. Use `@temporalio/workflow` primitives (`sleep`, `uuid4`, the patched `Date`) or push the side effect into an activity. See [.agents/rules/workflow-determinism.md](.agents/rules/workflow-determinism.md). This is the #1 cause of broken Temporal workflows — read that file before touching workflow code.
2. **Activities and the typed client return `AsyncResult<T, E>` from `unthrown`.** Never throw — wrap technical errors in `ApplicationFailure` and surface them via `err(...).toAsync()` (or `fromPromise(promise, qualify)`, where `qualify` returns the modeled error `E`). unthrown has no `okAsync`/`errAsync`: lift a sync `Result` with `.toAsync()`. The client uses unthrown's `Result` for sync returns. unthrown adds a third **`defect`** channel for _unanticipated_ failures — a thrown exception the code didn't model surfaces as a defect (inspectable via `result.isDefect()` / `result.cause`, re-thrown at the edge), not a typed `err`. Narrow before reaching `.value`/`.error`/`.cause` — both the `r.isOk()` method and the `isOk(r)` free function are type guards (same for `isErr`/`isDefect`); the codebase uses the methods. Error classes are built with `TaggedError("@temporal-contract/Name", { name: "Name" })<{ ...payload }>` — the `_tag` is package-namespaced to avoid collisions, while `options.name` keeps `Error.name` the bare class name for readable logs. The worker's `ValidationError` subclasses are the exception — they must stay `ApplicationFailure` for Temporal's terminal-failure semantics. There is no `neverthrow`, no `@swan-io/boxed`, and no `@temporal-contract/boxed` package — those were removed.
3. **No `any`.** Use `unknown` and narrow. Enforced by oxlint.
4. **`.js` extensions in every import.** TypeScript files import each other as `./foo.js`, never `./foo` or `./foo.ts`. Required by ESM module resolution.
5. **ESM only.** All packages are `"type": "module"`. No CommonJS in source.
6. **Catalog versions.** Edit `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `catalog:` block to bump a dependency, never per-package `package.json` versions. Anything that appears in a published package's public types must be a peer dep, not a regular dep — see `dependencies.md`.
