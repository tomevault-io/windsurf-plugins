# capcap

macOS menu bar screenshot tool. Pure AppKit, Swift Package Manager, no third-party dependencies.

## Build & Verification

After every code change, run the compile check:

```bash
bash scripts/compile-check.sh
```

For runtime-sensitive UI changes, run the rebuild script too:

```bash
bash scripts/rebuild-and-open.sh
```

This script builds the app bundle, kills any running instance, launches the new build, and confirms it started.

## Project Structure

- `capcap/App/` — Entry point (`main.swift`, `AppDelegate.swift`, `Info.plist`)
- `capcap/Capture/` — Screen capture logic (ScreenCaptureKit, selection overlay)
- `capcap/Editor/` — Post-capture annotation editor
- `capcap/Trigger/` — Double-tap ⌘ key detection
- `capcap/UI/` — Status bar, toast, cursor chip
- `capcap/Settings/` — Settings dialog (startup + preferences)
- `capcap/Utilities/` — UserDefaults wrapper
- `scripts/` — Build and bundle scripts

## Key Rules

- **Always run `bash scripts/compile-check.sh` after modifying code** to verify the compile.
- No SwiftUI — this project uses AppKit exclusively with programmatic UI.
- No storyboards or XIBs.
- Minimum deployment target: macOS 14.0.
- All newly added user-facing copy must not end with punctuation. Punctuation
  inside the sentence is fine, but the final character of every visible string,
  tooltip, alert, toast, menu item, placeholder, and localized value must not be
  punctuation.

## Packaging Lessons

- SwiftPM target resources are not automatically present in the hand-assembled
  `.app` bundle. If any package target declares `resources:` in `Package.swift`
  or code uses `Bundle.module`, update both `scripts/bundle.sh` and the release
  workflow to copy the generated `<package>_<target>.bundle` into
  `capcap.app/Contents/Resources/`.
- Treat a missing SwiftPM resource bundle as a release-blocking error, not a
  runtime fallback. The failure may only surface when a UI path first touches
  `Bundle.module`, such as the PermissionFlow authorization panel.
- After packaging changes, verify the final `.app` contents directly with
  `find build/capcap.app/Contents/Resources -maxdepth 2 -name '*.bundle'` and,
  for release builds, confirm the universal app still contains both `arm64` and
  `x86_64` slices.

## Hotspot Ownership

- `capcap/Editor/EditWindowController.swift` owns editor session wiring,
  toolbar callbacks, scroll capture, crop mode, and output actions. Keep tool
  state changes paired with toolbar/sub-toolbar updates. Verify with
  `bash scripts/compile-check.sh`; use `bash scripts/rebuild-and-open.sh` for
  UI interaction changes.
- `capcap/Editor/EditCanvasView.swift` owns annotation state, mouse handling,
  selection chrome, undo/redo, and export compositing. Preserve value-typed
  annotation mutation and snapshot-based undo. Verify with
  `bash scripts/compile-check.sh`; use `bash scripts/rebuild-and-open.sh` when
  hit testing or visible editing behavior changes.
- `capcap/Editor/Annotations.swift` owns annotation model structs and drawing
  behavior. Keep drawing and hit-testing logic together for each annotation
  type. Verify with `bash scripts/compile-check.sh`.
- `capcap/Settings/SettingsView.swift` owns the settings window and preference
  controls. Keep persisted defaults in `Defaults.swift` aligned with visible
  controls and localized strings. Verify with `bash scripts/compile-check.sh`;
  use `bash scripts/rebuild-and-open.sh` for settings UI behavior.
- `capcap/Translation/OCRTranslatePanel.swift` owns OCR/translation result
  presentation and provider interaction. Keep translation latency work off the
  main actor except for UI updates. Verify with `bash scripts/compile-check.sh`.
- `capcap/Capture/PinLauncher.swift` owns pinned-image window behavior,
  toolbar visibility, drag/resize behavior, and zoom interaction. Keep hover
  affordances and the above/below-100% drag model stable. Verify with
  `bash scripts/compile-check.sh`; use `bash scripts/rebuild-and-open.sh` for
  pin-window interaction changes.
- `capcap/Utilities/Defaults.swift` owns persisted preferences and localized
  string accessors. Keep new settings normalized at the persistence boundary and
  add matching keys to every `Resources/*.lproj/Localizable.strings` file.
  Verify with `bash scripts/compile-check.sh`.
- `capcap/Settings/UploadSettingsPane.swift` owns image-host provider settings.
  Keep provider-specific validation, default-provider selection, and stored
  credentials isolated to this settings surface and `Defaults.swift`. Verify
  with `bash scripts/compile-check.sh`; use `bash scripts/rebuild-and-open.sh`
  when settings UI behavior changes.
- `capcap/Trigger/HotkeyManager.swift` owns global shortcut registration and
  keyboard trigger dispatch. Keep shortcut recording, defaults, and active
  registration behavior aligned with Settings. Verify with
  `bash scripts/compile-check.sh`; use `bash scripts/rebuild-and-open.sh` for
  end-to-end hotkey behavior.

## Adding an Editor Tool

Whenever a new annotation/editor tool is added, it MUST also be wired into the
toolbar — a tool that isn't in `ToolbarLayout` never appears for the user.
Checklist:

- Add the `ToolbarItemID` case and update `editTool`, `symbolName`, `tooltip`,
