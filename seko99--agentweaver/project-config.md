# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
`src/index.ts` is the main entrypoint and now acts primarily as CLI orchestration plus `auto` pipeline state handling. Execution logic is split into first-class executors under `src/executors/`, with data-only default configs in `src/executors/configs/` and shared runtime services in `src/runtime/`. Interactive terminal UI lives under `src/interactive/`, markdown rendering in `src/markdown.ts`, and supporting modules such as Jira/prompt/artifact helpers live alongside them in `src/`. Container runtime files no longer exist — Docker components have been removed from the repository. Build output goes to `dist/`. If you add tests, place them under a clear top-level directory such as `tests/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Install dependencies and build:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Useful commands:

```bash
node dist/index.js --help            # show CLI usage
node dist/index.js plan DEMO-1234    # run one workflow stage
node dist/index.js auto DEMO-1234    # run the full pipeline
npm run check                        # TypeScript type-check
npm run pack:check                   # inspect npm publish tarball
```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow TypeScript/Node conventions: 2-space or existing-file indentation consistency, `camelCase` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for classes/types, and `UPPER_CASE` for module-level constants. Keep imports grouped and prefer focused modules over large inline blocks when extending command handlers or TUI components. New external actions should usually be added as executor modules plus config entries rather than inline process logic inside `src/index.ts`.

## Language For Artifacts
Structured machine-readable artifacts such as `.json` files must always be written in English, unless the artifact is intentionally storing verbatim user-provided or external source text.
Human-readable markdown artifacts such as `.md` files must use the workflow-selected markdown language, for example `mdLang` when such a setting exists.

## Testing Guidelines
No committed automated test suite exists yet, so every change should include at least `npm run check` and one CLI smoke test. Prefer adding tests under `tests/` for new behavior. For executor or orchestration changes, prefer smoke checks such as `node dist/index.js --help`, `node dist/index.js auto --help-phases`, and representative `--dry` command runs.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Git history currently contains only `init`, so adopt a clearer convention going forward: use short imperative subjects such as `Add auto pipeline state validation`. Keep commits scoped to one concern. Pull requests should include the user-visible workflow affected, required environment variables, manual verification steps, and terminal output snippets when behavior changes.

## Configuration & Secrets
Do not commit Jira tokens, `.env`, npm auth tokens, or Codex home data. Keep local secrets in untracked environment files, and document any new required variables in `README.md` and the PR description.
