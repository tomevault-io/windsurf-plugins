## Project Overview
This is a Next.js TypeScript application for a real-time quiz platform with the following features:

### Core Features
- **Dual Login System**: Teachers (Faculty ID) and Students (Roll Number)

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (keep it simple and clean)
- **Database**: Simple file-based storage initially
- **Real-time**: WebSocket or Server-Sent Events

### Code Guidelines
- Keep code simple and readable
- Avoid over-engineering - prioritize functionality over fancy features
- Use clean, semantic HTML with basic Tailwind classes
- Focus on core functionality first, then enhance
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Keep components small and focused

### Key Components Needed
