# Claude Code Go

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Flux159/claude-code-go
cd claude-code-go
```

2. Install and set up Claude Code CLI first:
```
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

3. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Running the App

For full functionality, run these commands in separate terminals:

1. Start the mobile app:
```
npm run start  # Mobile app (includes --tunnel by default)
```
Or run directly with:
```
npx expo start --tunnel
```

2. Start the Python server:
```
npm run server  # Python server on port 8142
```

3. Start the Next.js web preview:
```
npm run dev  # Next.js web preview on port 3000
```

## Mobile Connectivity

If you get an error on Android like:
```
Uncaught Error: java.io.IOException: Failed to download remote update
```
Use the `--tunnel` flag as shown above for remote connections.

For iOS devices, the tunnel mode is also recommended for better connectivity.

## Project Overview

Claude Code on Mobile (aka Claude Code Go or Claude Code On-The-Go) is a mobile app that lets you:
- Browse directories on your development machine
- Run prompts (text input or dictation) using Claude Code
- Make git commits/PRs in git/sapling directories
- View dev builds via proxy

### Architecture

The application consists of three main components:

1. **Mobile App (Expo/React Native)**
   - Chat UI with conversation history
   - Directory browser and file explorer
   - Text and voice input capabilities
   - Settings for server connection

2. **Python Server**
   - Runs on port 8142
   - Proxies requests to the Claude CLI
   - Directory browsing and file operations
   - Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses

3. **Next.js Web App**
   - Runs on port 3000
   - Provides a web preview interface
   - Renders development site

### Key Features

- Directory navigation and file browsing
- Text/voice prompts to Claude
- Git integration for commits/PRs
- Development server preview
- Streaming JSON response format
- Persistent conversation history
- Mobile-friendly interface

### Workflow

1. Browse project directories
2. Send prompts to Claude (text or voice)
3. Claude returns results in streaming JSON format
4. Review and apply changes
5. Commit changes to git/sapling if needed
6. Preview changes in the development server

### Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**
   - Ensure all three components are running
   - Check that hostname/port settings match in settings
   - Verify Claude CLI is properly installed and configured

2. **Claude Command Issues**
   - Run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` in terminal first
   - Ensure Python environment has necessary permissions
   - Check server logs for Claude CLI errors

3. **Expo/React Native Issues**
   - Use `--tunnel` flag for remote connections (not ios specific commands)
   - Clear cache with `npx expo start -c` if needed
   - Check for compatible Expo SDK versions

### Future Roadmap

- Authentication and remote server connections
- Custom dev server commands and ports
- Voice input/output improvements
- New project creation
- Server restart capability
- Standard HTTP API for other clients (VSCode, etc.)
- MCP server integration
- App Store publication
