# Agent Instructions

## Tooling

- Use `uv` for dependency management, testing, and builds.

## SDK Design

- Keep the PyPI distribution name as `polymarket-client` and the import package as `polymarket` unless explicitly changed.
- When implementing new areas where guidance is vague, choose the most idiomatic Python approach but avoid premature abstractions.
- Prefer simple, direct code until there is a concrete repeated use case or public API need that justifies a helper, wrapper, protocol, base class, or configuration abstraction.
- Do not copy TypeScript SDK shapes mechanically; preserve feature parity while adapting APIs to Python ecosystem norms and the smallest useful surface.
- The SDK should present one cohesive consumer interface and hide current service boundaries where possible.
- Design public APIs around developer workflows rather than the current split between underlying APIs.
- Do not mirror today's service fragmentation directly in the public SDK surface.
- Public docs and docstrings should describe the unified SDK behavior; avoid mentioning underlying service names unless the user specifically asks, a low-level escape hatch requires it, or a test needs to document a boundary.
- In public-facing docs, docstrings, type descriptions, and examples, describe SDK objects directly as the objects users work with. Do not mention that objects are normalized from raw responses, hide uneven internal/API surfaces, or frame models around which backend currently provides data.
- Lower-level controls are acceptable when they support a concrete integration need, but the default experience should feel unified.
- For internal invariant checks, use Python-native `RuntimeError`, `AssertionError`, or `typing.assert_never` as appropriate instead of introducing a public `InvariantError` SDK exception.
- Use `typing.NewType` selectively for meaningful SDK domain types. Generic primitives such as `EvmAddress`, `HexString`, and `TransactionHash` belong outside `polymarket.models`; model-specific identifiers such as `MarketId`, `EventId`, `ConditionId`, `TokenId`, and `OrderId` belong under `polymarket.models` and should be re-exported from the public package where useful.
- Do not mark every primitive field. Prefer marked types for key identifiers and domain concepts where the IDE/type name adds meaning or prevents confusion. Keep public method inputs developer-friendly by accepting plain primitives like `str` unless stricter typing has a concrete benefit; returned models may expose marked types.
- Name request/path construction helpers with `build_*`.
- Avoid reuse that does not carry semantic or domain-specific value. Do not add boolean mode flags or generic helpers that hide distinct behavior behind one function; prefer separate explicit helpers whose names describe the behavior they implement.

## Client Sync/Async Design

- The default public clients should be synchronous: use `PublicClient` and `SecureClient` for normal imports, docs, examples, notebooks, scripts, and basic bot usage.
- Async clients should be explicit alternatives named with an `Async` prefix, such as `AsyncPublicClient` and `AsyncSecureClient`.
- Keep sync and async method names the same where possible: sync methods return values directly, async methods return awaitables and are called with `await`.
- Avoid mixed-mode clients with flags such as `async_mode=True`, and avoid adding `_async` method variants to synchronous clients by default.
- Share business logic between sync and async implementations. Request construction, URL/path selection, auth/signing, serialization, validation, response parsing, models, and endpoint namespace structure should be reusable.
- Keep the transport boundary separate: synchronous clients should use a synchronous transport, and async clients should use an asynchronous transport.
- Do not implement sync clients by calling `asyncio.run()` around async methods unless there is a specific, reviewed reason. Event-loop ownership causes issues in notebooks, async apps, tests, and agent runtimes.
- Prefer small shared request builders plus separate sync/async transport execution over duplicating endpoint method bodies.

## Tests

- Do not add low-value unit tests that only assert language mechanics, simple inheritance, imports, or direct assignment. Prefer tests that cover SDK behavior, meaningful validation, error mapping, serialization, request construction, or user-visible workflows.
- Do not add live trading tests to the default test suite.
- Mark live service tests with `@pytest.mark.integration`.
- Integration tests that need secrets must use the `require_env` fixture from `tests/integration/conftest.py`; do not read secret env vars at import time.
- Keep `.env.example` as the source of truth for local integration-test env names. Do not duplicate the full env list in Markdown files.
- Keep `.env` and real secrets uncommitted. GitHub Actions should receive integration secrets through repository or environment secrets/variables.
- Tests that place orders, spend funds, or mutate live state must also use `@pytest.mark.metered`; they are skipped unless `POLYMARKET_RUN_METERED_TESTS=1` is set.
- Document any metered test's live side effects near the test.
