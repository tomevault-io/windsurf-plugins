# Working on Shadowclone

Shadowclone maintains portable coding-agent skills from consented sessions and memory. Active installations deliver skills and small native instruction sections; legacy profiles remain for migration.

## Read first

- Read `.claude/skills/clean-code/SKILL.md` before editing code or prose.
- Read `.claude/skills/scoped-fix/SKILL.md` when changing existing behavior.
- Read `.claude/skills/data-handling/SKILL.md` before changing capture, storage, model access, or actions performed for the user.

## Work on the requested change

Inspect the current worktree and preserve unrelated edits. Record the change’s reasoning and sequence in `docs/` before implementation. Use an existing record when extending the same design.

Keep types and names explicit. Use Bun, the existing module boundaries, and the repository’s checks. Avoid introducing dependencies without a concrete reason.

Keep active skills delivery separate from legacy profile compatibility. Do not inject an aggregated profile into an active skill environment.

## Checks

```bash
bun install
bun run check
bun test src/skills
bun run cli --help
```

`bun run check` runs typecheck, lint, and tests. Run focused checks while editing and the full gate before handoff. Report pre-existing failures separately. Tests use synthetic fixtures; authenticated agent runs and paid evaluations require an explicitly authorized scope.

## Data boundaries

- Keep private repository material, transcripts, receipts, and identifying paths outside this public checkout, including ignored files. Use independently authored synthetic examples.
- Public evaluation material may name models and versions, but not evaluator identities, billing details, private installations, paths, or repositories.
- Each capture source needs its own consent flag, off by default. Document additions in `docs/data-handling.md`.
- Resolve eligible learning text through `resolveRedacted`. Exclude tool results, tool-returned file contents, thinking blocks, and data-access results from learning.
- Preserve repository and remote-owner scope. Global guidance needs explicit global evidence or a direct user decision.
- Preserve manual edits and ownership checks when writing skills or native instructions. Keep changes reversible.

## Documentation

Use [the documentation index](docs/README.md) to find user guides, architecture, and design history. Update the pages affected by a behavior change. Update the architecture diagram when the flow or a trust boundary changes.

Write for the page’s reader. Remove session narration, expired task instructions, and duplicate explanations. Keep current instructions accurate and identify historical designs as history.

Keep the README a short path to a working setup: a quick start with time estimates, plain-language results, and a privacy summary. Put usage detail in `docs/guides/` and link to migration, architecture, and detailed evaluation methods. User-facing commands use the installed `shadowclone` CLI; Bun commands belong in contributor instructions.

## Handoff and Git

Explain what changed, how it was verified, and any remaining limitation. Ask the user to review the completed diff before committing or pushing. Commit messages use a single lowercase conventional-commit subject with no body or co-author trailer. Never force push or amend a pushed commit.
