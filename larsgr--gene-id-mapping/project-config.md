# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project develops a bioinformatics workflow for mapping gene annotations across and within genome assemblies. The primary goal is to convert gene IDs from one annotation to another (e.g., from ICSASG_v2 to Ssal_v3.1) with accompanying metadata on mapping confidence and annotation similarity. The workflow will ultimately generate mapping tables for [Salmobase](https://salmobase.org).

## Workflow Structure

### Session Start Protocol
**IMPORTANT:** At the start of each session, automatically check git status:
- Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
- If uncommitted changes exist, display them and warn the user:
  ```
  ⚠️ Uncommitted changes detected:
  [show git status output]

  Manual edits should be committed before starting AI work.
  Would you like to commit these changes first? [Yes/No]
  ```
- If Yes: Guide user through creating a commit
- If No: Acknowledge and proceed with the session
- User should commit manual edits from previous sessions before starting new AI work

### Documentation Hierarchy
All work follows this three-tier structure:

1. **README.md → Roadmap Section**
   - High-level tasks using emoji status:
     - ✅ Completed
     - 🔄 In progress (may span multiple sessions/commits)
     - ⬜ Not started
   - Each task links to a detailed log file in docs/

2. **docs/[task-name].md → Detailed Task Log**
   - One log file per Roadmap task
   - Each AI session adds a new dated section with:
     - What was done (commands, files created/modified, analysis performed)
     - Key findings and conclusions
     - Problems encountered and solutions
   - Session section names should match:
     - The entry in docs/AI-usage.md
     - The git commit message for that session

3. **experiments/[experiment-name]/ → Experiment Scripts and Data**
   - Single-use analysis/experiment scripts stored in subdirectories
   - Each subdirectory contains:
     - Analysis scripts (Python, R, bash, etc.)
     - Output data (with .gitignore for files >1MB)
     - Brief README.md if complex
   - Referenced from the detailed task log

### Session End Protocol
**IMPORTANT:** When work appears complete, automatically remind the user to document:
- Detect potential session end (e.g., user says "thanks", "that's all", work is complete)
- Prompt: "This session's work should be documented. Would you like to run /session-end now?"
- The `/session-end` skill will:
  - Gather session summary information via prompts
  - Update docs/AI-usage.md with new entry
  - Update or create detailed task log in docs/
  - Suggest commit message matching session name
  - Verify all documentation is complete
- **Do not consider a session complete until documentation is updated**

## File Organization Rules

### Experiment Data
- Single-use experiments: `experiments/[descriptive-name]/`
- Always create .gitignore for generated files >1MB
- Include script used to generate outputs for reproducibility

### Analysis Reports
- **Rmarkdown reports**: Store in `notebooks/` directory
- Render as both .md (commit) and .html (add to .gitignore)
- Final polished reports can be moved to `docs/` if needed
- Initial/exploratory analyses stay in `notebooks/`

### Tool Scripts
- Reusable tools go in repo root (e.g., `gff_block_sort.py`, `within_assembly_compare.py`)
- Scripts that are part of the final workflow, not one-off analyses
- Should be documented in CLAUDE.md under "Key Scripts" section

### Documentation Files
- `docs/AI-usage.md`: Log of all AI sessions (prompt + summary + reflection)
- `docs/[task-name].md`: Detailed logs per Roadmap task
- `docs/[topic].md`: Design documents, guides, surveys (e.g., tool-survey.md)


## Development Environment

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate idmap

# Note: Some tools (ParsEval, Liftoff/LiftoffTools) are not available on osx-arm64 via conda
# Use Docker for those tools if needed on Mac ARM
```

The conda environment includes:
- Python 3.10
- bedtools, agat, gffcompare, gffread
- JupyterLab for analysis notebooks
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data analysis

## Architecture

The workflow follows a two-step approach:

### 1. Cross-Assembly Mapping (Liftoff/LiftoffTools)
- Lifts gene annotations from source to target assembly
- Generates variant and synteny information
- Full liftoff outputs stored in `data/genomes/{species}/liftoff/{source_asm}_to_{target_asm}_{annotation}.gff[.gz]`
  - Example: `data/genomes/AtlanticSalmon/liftoff/ICSASG_v2_to_Ssal_v3.1_Ens.gff3`
  - Annotation suffix: "Ens" = Ensembl, "NCBI" = NCBI
- Experimental/test runs stored in `experiments/liftoff_*/` and `experiments/liftofftools_*/` directories

### 2. Within-Assembly Comparison (Custom Script)
- Compares lifted annotations with native target annotations on the same assembly
- Uses streaming architecture to handle large genome-scale files
- Classifies gene mappings as Green/Yellow/Red based on overlap quality
- Main implementation: `within_assembly_compare.py`

## Key Scripts

### `gff_block_sort.py`
Sorts GFF3 files by `(seqid, gene_start)` while preserving gene blocks (all features belonging to a gene stay together).

**Usage:**
```bash
./gff_block_sort.py input.gff3 -o output.sorted.gff3
```

**Critical requirement:** All GFF3 files MUST be sorted this way before running `within_assembly_compare.py`. The comparison script validates this ordering and will error if it detects unsorted input.

### `within_assembly_compare.py`
Streams sorted GFF3 annotation files and computes gene/transcript-level overlap metrics.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic gene-level comparison
./within_assembly_compare.py annA.sorted.gff3 annB.sorted.gff3 -o comparison_output.tsv

# Include transcript-level details
./within_assembly_compare.py annA.sorted.gff3 annB.sorted.gff3 -o comparison_output.tsv --include-transcripts
```

**design document / Architecture:**
`docs/comparison-script-design.md` contains a detailed description. ALWAYS READ AND UPDATE THIS IF CHANGES ARE MADE!

## GFF3 Processing Conventions

### Gene ID Format
Gene IDs typically follow the pattern: `ID=gene:ENSSASG00000000001`

### Sorting Requirements
- All GFF files must be sorted by `(seqid, gene start)` with gene blocks intact
- Use `gff_block_sort.py` before any comparison operations
- The script validates ordering and will error on unsorted input

### Transcript Types
The comparison script recognizes these transcript types:
- mRNA, transcript
- ncRNA, lnc_RNA, miRNA, rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA
- primary_transcript, pseudogenic_transcript

## Comparison Metrics and Classification

### Transcript-Level Metrics
- **Jaccard_exon**: Overlapping exon bp ÷ union of exon bp
- **Jaccard_CDS_phase**: Overlapping CDS bp (same strand, same codon phase) ÷ union of CDS bp
- **Junction_F1_all**: F1-score over all splice junctions
- **Junction_F1_CDS**: F1-score over CDS junctions only
- **Strand_agree**: Boolean flag (false = antisense)
- **Monoexonic**: True if transcript has no introns

### Gene-Level Classification
Transcript pairs are rolled up to gene-level summaries with these classifications:

**Green (High Confidence):**
- Coding genes: CDS Jaccard ≥ 98% or Junction F1 ≥ 95%
- Non-coding genes: Jaccard ≥ 90% or Junction F1 ≥ 95%
- Monoexonic: Jaccard ≥ 95% and length ratio delta ≤ 10%

**Yellow (Significant but Different):**
- Coding: CDS Jaccard ≥ 40% or Junction F1 ≥ 50%
- Non-coding: Jaccard ≥ 50% or Junction F1 ≥ 50%

**Red (Weak Evidence):**
- Exon Jaccard < 10% or antisense overlaps

**NotMapped:**
- No overlapping partner found

Thresholds are defined in `within_assembly_compare.py:48-66`.

### Split/Merge Detection
- Genes with multiple partners across annotations are flagged
- Affects confidence scoring for downstream use in Salmobase
