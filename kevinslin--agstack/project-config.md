# AGENTS Instructions

## Git Workflow

- NEVER create a branch unless the user explicitly asks for one.
- Work directly on `main` by default.

## Script Testing Rule

- For any new or modified script under a `scripts/` directory, add or update automated tests in a nearby `tests/` directory.
- Do not consider script work complete until those tests are run and passing.
- Always update README.md when adding, removing, or significantly changing the functionality of a skill

## Important Considerations
- For note/document links, ALWAYS use links relative to the current file unless a stronger repo-specific rule overrides this. DO NOT USE ABSOLUTE PATHS. NEVER EVER DO THIS.
