# Nordstjernen — Claude operating guide

Nordstjernen ("Nordstjernen Web Navigator") is a clean-room web
browser written from scratch in **C**, using **GTK 4** for the UI and
**libcurl** for networking. Targets Linux, macOS, and Windows.

See `README.md` for the product vision. Nordstjernen is a fresh
implementation — there is no upstream browser engine, no fork,
nothing imported.

## Design constraints

- Minimalistic, compact, secure. Source should be readable and
  maintainable by a single human.
- HTML5 + modern CSS + modern JavaScript, supported pragmatically as
  far as is feasible without bloat.
- **No** WebGL, WebGPU, or AI-style web APIs.
- At most one video codec active at a time.
- English UI only (for now).
- Does not phone home, does not telemeter the user.

## Comments policy

**The code is self-explaining. Don't write code comments.**

- Each source file gets exactly one short header comment at the top
  naming the file and (at most) one sentence on what it does. That's
  it.
- No inline `/* … */` or `//` comments inside functions, in struct
  declarations, around tricky branches, or anywhere else. Rename a
  variable or extract a function instead.
- No "section banner" comments (`/* ---------- helpers ---------- */`).
  Group code by file or function instead.
- No `TODO`/`FIXME`/`XXX` markers — file a real task instead.

## Autonomous mode — read this every session

This repo is driven by Claude in long uninterrupted sessions.
**Default to acting, not asking.**

- **Don't ask "do you want me to proceed?", "should I continue?",
  "ready to commit?"** — just do it. The user interrupts if they
  disagree.
- **Don't summarize after every step.** One-line status is enough.
- **Don't pause for path/file/branch confirmation when context is
  unambiguous.** Grep, pick, proceed.
- **Commit and push aggressively.** Small commits, push to
  `origin/main` as soon as a logical unit lands.
- **Run for hours.** Diagnose, fix, retry. Only stop on genuine
  external blockers. When stopping: one line on what's blocked.
- **Never ask the user to run the build.** Run it yourself.
- **Local machine is the build *and* run oracle.** The repo can be
  driven from either a Linux box (GTK 4 / libcurl / meson / clang +
  an X session at `DISPLAY=:0`) or a Windows 11 box via MSYS2
  MINGW64 (same toolchain, same meson/ninja invocation; the binary
  is `./builddir/src/nordstjernen.exe`). Every commit must pass
  `meson compile -C builddir` locally before pushing. Smoke-launch
  the browser (in the background, then kill it) on material changes
  — that's the per-change correctness gate, not CI. See
  `docs/Windows.md` for the MSYS2 setup; the rest of this guide
  uses Unix-style invocations that work in either shell.
- **CI is disabled.** The Linux / macOS / Windows workflows only
  trigger on manual `workflow_dispatch` — the daily cron was
  removed. Nothing runs automatically on push or PR. Local Linux
  is the only correctness gate; the workflows are kept around for
  the rare ad-hoc cross-platform sanity run.

## Build / verify locally

The intended build system is **meson + ninja**. From a clean checkout:

```sh
meson setup builddir
meson compile -C builddir
./builddir/src/nordstjernen
```

`meson setup` will auto-download the QuickJS engine
([quickjs-ng v0.14.0](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs/releases/tag/v0.14.0))
from its release zip into `subprojects/quickjs-0.14.0/`, as
declared by `subprojects/quickjs.wrap`. No git submodules.

### HTML engine: Lexbor

The single HTML→DOM backend is
[lexbor](https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor). It is **required** —
configure fails if neither the system `lexbor/html/html.h` +
`liblexbor_static` nor the CMake subproject
(`subprojects/lexbor.wrap`) is usable. CMake is therefore a hard
build-time dep (Debian/Ubuntu `cmake`, Fedora/RHEL `cmake`,
openSUSE `cmake`).

### Image decoding: Wuffs

PNG, GIF, BMP, and JPEG bytes are decoded through
[Wuffs](https://github.com/google/wuffs), a memory-safe
transpiled-to-C image-decoder library. The single-file release is
vendored at `subprojects/wuffs/wuffs-v0.4.c` and built as a static
subproject. `src/image_wuffs.c::nd_image_decode_wuffs` is tried
first; it returns NULL for any other format, in which case
`src/image.c::nd_image_decode_bytes` falls back to GDK-Pixbuf
(for TIFF / ICO / WebP / etc.) and, last, to librsvg for SVG.

### URL parsing: lexbor URL module

The `nd_url_*` helpers in `src/net.c` route URL resolution, origin
extraction, and host extraction through `lxb_url_parse` /
`lxb_url_serialize` from lexbor's WHATWG URL module. No separate URL
library or build option — it's part of the same `liblexbor_static.a`
that the HTML parser uses.

### Charset detection: uchardet

Required dependency (Debian/Ubuntu `libuchardet-dev`,
Fedora/RHEL `uchardet-devel`). `nd_html_decode_body` hands the
response body to [uchardet](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/)
to identify the charset, then `g_convert`s to UTF-8. No
hand-rolled BOM / HTTP-charset / meta-charset sniffing — uchardet
handles all of that internally. The Latin-1 fallback only fires
if uchardet can't classify the bytes at all.

System packages required on Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config meson ninja-build \
