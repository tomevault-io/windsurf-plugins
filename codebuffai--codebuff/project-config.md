# Codebuff

Codebuff is an advanced coding agent with a composable agent framework. It also includes:
- freebuff, the free coding agent

## Goal

Make an efficient learning agent that can do anything.

## Key Technologies

- TypeScript monorepo (Bun workspaces)
- Bun runtime + package manager
- Next.js (web app + API routes)
- Multiple LLM providers (Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini/etc.)

## Repo Map

- `cli/` — TUI client (OpenTUI + React) and local UX
- `sdk/` — JS/TS SDK used by the CLI and external users
- `web/` — Next.js app + API routes (the "web API")
- `packages/agent-runtime/` — agent runtime + tool handling (server-side)
- `common/` — shared types, tools, schemas, utilities
- `agents/` — main agents shipped with codebuff
- `.agents/` — local agent templates (prompt + programmatic agents)
- `freebuff/` - a free coding agent built from configuring codebuff cli

## Conventions

- Never force-push `main` unless explicitly requested.
- Run interactive git commands in tmux (anything that opens an editor or prompts).

## Docs

IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning. Always read the relevant docs below before implementing changes.

- `docs/architecture.md` — Package dependency graph, per-package details, architectural patterns
- `docs/request-flow.md` — Full request lifecycle from CLI through server and back
- `docs/error-schema.md` — Server error response formats and client-side handling
- `docs/development.md` — Dev setup, worktrees, logs, package management, DB migrations
- `docs/testing.md` — DI over mocking, tmux CLI testing
- `docs/environment-variables.md` — Env var rules, DI helpers, loading order
- `docs/agents-and-tools.md` — Agent system, shell shims, tool definitions
- `docs/patterns/handle-steps-generators.md` — handleSteps generator patterns and spawn_agents tool calls
