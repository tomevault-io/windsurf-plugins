# CLAUDE.md

This is the project context file. Claude Code (and other agents that look for `CLAUDE.md`) reads this on session start. Replace the sections below with your own project's reality once you start writing code.

## What this project is

(One sentence — what are you building? Who is it for?)

## Stack

- (frontend / backend / db / hosting / payments / auth — fill in as you make choices)

## How audits work here

This repo runs the [commit.show audit](https://commit.show/audit) on every pull request via `commitshow/audit-action@v1`. The score and top concerns are posted as a sticky comment. Three pillars:

- **Audit (50)** — production maturity (tests · CI · observability · TS strict · lockfile · LICENSE · responsive), source hygiene, tech diversity, brief integrity.
- **Scout (30)** — human forecast votes from the league. Inactive on private repos; relevant if/when this project is published on commit.show.
- **Community (20)** — view/share/comment quality signals. Same — relevant on the public site.

For a private project the practical score ceiling is ~50 (Audit pillar only). Hit that first; the other two activate when you submit the project to https://commit.show/submit.

## Conventions

(Add your own — naming, error handling, testing approach, etc.)

## Glossary

(Add domain terms specific to your product so the agent stops re-asking.)
