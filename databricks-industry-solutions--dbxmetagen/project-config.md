# DDL Handling Rules

## Quote Wrapping

DDL string literals use double-quote wrapping: `COMMENT ON TABLE ... IS "comment text"`.
Inside the comment, double quotes are sanitized to single quotes before wrapping.

## Regex for Comment Extraction/Replacement

Always use a `\2` backreference to match the same quote character that opened the string:

```python
# CORRECT -- backreference ensures matching quotes
r'(COMMENT ON TABLE [^"\']+ IS\s+)(["\'])(.*?)\2'

# WRONG -- separate group matches mismatched quotes, breaks on apostrophes
r'(COMMENT ON TABLE [^"\']+ IS\s+)(["\'])(.*?)(["\'])'
```

When replacing, the captured comment text is in group 3 (not group 4).

## `is_column_comment` Detection

Check for the full DDL keyword, not just the word "COLUMN":

```python
# CORRECT
is_col = "COMMENT ON COLUMN" in ddl.upper() or "ALTER COLUMN" in ddl.upper()

# WRONG -- "Column" commonly appears in AI-generated comment text
is_col = "COLUMN" in ddl.upper()
```

## Comment Sanitization Consistency

Both the generation path (`processing.py`) and the review path (`ddl_regenerator.py`)
must apply the same sanitization: `new_comment.replace('""', "'").replace('"', "'")`.
If you change one path, update the other.
