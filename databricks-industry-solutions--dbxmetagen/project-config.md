# Genie Pipeline Patterns

## Architecture

Three-phase LLM pipeline in `agent.py`:
1. **Phase 1 (Core):** description, text_instructions, sample_questions, join_specs
2. **Phase 2 (SQL):** example_sql pairs
3. **Phase 3 (Snippets):** sql_snippets (measures, filters, expressions)

Post-processing merges pre-built joins, validates SQL, and builds the serialized space via `schema.py`.

## Join Reliability

- During context assembly (`context.py`), extract metric view joins into `join_specs` so the agent has them as input.
- After the agent runs, force-merge any pre-built `join_specs` into the output -- never rely solely on the LLM to reproduce them.
- The agent prompt must tell the LLM that pre-built joins will be auto-merged, so it should focus on additional joins only.
- If `join_specs` is empty and there are multiple data sources, emit a warning log.

## SQL Conventions

- Table references must be fully qualified: `catalog.schema.table`.
- Column references in snippets use `table.column` format.
- Date functions: `TIMESTAMPADD`/`TIMESTAMPDIFF` use bare singular units (no quotes, no plurals). `DATE_TRUNC` uses single-quoted interval.
- Join SQL is simplified to `table.column` via `_simplify_join_sql` and backtick-quoted via `_backtick_join_sql` in `schema.py`.
- Date unit fixing (`_fix_date_func_units`) runs on all generated SQL.

## Safety

All phases include `SAFETY_PROMPT_BLOCK`. Never generate PII/PHI in descriptions, instructions, sample questions, or example SQL. Avoid ephemeral statistics (row counts, date ranges). Structural patterns are fine.

## Serialized Space (`schema.py`)

`build_serialized_space()` coerces raw LLM output into the Genie API payload. Pydantic models act as a whitelist -- only defined fields survive serialization. Do not add fields to the Pydantic models without verifying they exist in the Genie proto schema.
