# Cursor Rules (for IDE Agent)

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1.1 Living Context

Context is never static.

Before any major action, you must:

- Re-evaluate the current context
- Validate assumptions with the user
- Adjust your understanding
- Stop immediately if a conflict appears

### 1.2 Human-in-the-loop (Mandatory)

You must not act on unvalidated assumptions.

If something is unclear:

- Check best practices
- Check repo context
- For code language unclarities, visit Context7
- Ask the user

The user must explicitly approve:

- new assumptions
- breaking changes
- multi-file refactors
- deviations from plan
- uncertainty or ambiguity

### 1.3 Minimal Context Loading

Load only the files relevant to the task.

Do not scan the entire repo unless explicitly instructed.

Reuse stored context.

### 1.4 Code Quality

- Follow existing architecture and project patterns
- Keep code clean, modular, readable
- Add docstrings for new functions/classes
- Use inline comments only for non-obvious logic
- Do not over-refactor or rewrite unless asked

## 2. REPO CONTEXT MEMORY

Your project includes the directory:

`.ai/context/`

This directory contains project-specific knowledge.

Before beginning any task, you must:

Load relevant context files from:

- `.ai/context/project.md`
- `.ai/context/architecture.md`
- `.ai/context/conventions.md`
- `.ai/context/domains/*.md`
- `.ai/context/files/*.md`
- `.ai/context/tasks/*.md` (only if helpful)

If stored context conflicts with actual code:

- Actual code always wins
- Stop and ask the user whether to update context

## 3. WORKFLOW (STRICT)

Follow this workflow exactly.

### 3.1 Workflow Exceptions for Small Changes

For **small, isolated changes**, you may bypass the full workflow phases (0-4) and proceed directly to implementation if the task meets these criteria:

**You can bypass the workflow if:**
- **Simple, focused task** (single feature addition, bug fix, or refactor within a limited scope)
- **Few files affected** (typically 1-5 files with clear, obvious dependencies)
- **No breaking changes** (backward compatible, no API contract changes)
- **Clear requirements** (the change is straightforward and unambiguous)
- **Low risk** (change doesn't affect critical business logic or core architecture)

**Examples of tasks that can bypass:**
- Adding a new UI component following existing patterns
- Fixing a bug in a single component
- Adding a new API endpoint following existing patterns
- Updating styling or layout
- Adding utility functions
- Refactoring within a single module/component
- Updating documentation
- Fixing lint errors or type issues

**When bypassing the workflow, you must still:**

- Load the relevant file(s) to understand context
- Make the change following existing patterns
- Verify the change doesn't introduce errors (check lints)
- Briefly explain what was changed

**If ANY uncertainty arises during a "small change", immediately revert to the full workflow.**

### Phase 0 — Gather Context

**Step 0.1: Load repo context memory**

Load only relevant summaries.

**Step 0.2: Load relevant code files**

Only scan what is needed for the task.

**Step 0.3: Create a Concise Context Summary**

Produce:

```
## Context Summary

Goal:
Current behavior:
Expected behavior:
Files involved:
Dependencies:
Edge cases:
Patterns observed:
Risks / unknowns:
Critical assumptions (need validation):
```

**Step 0.4: Ask the user to validate**

Do not proceed until the user validates assumptions.

### Phase 1 — Plan

After user validation:

**Step 1.1: Re-check context validity**

Confirm no new commits, changes, or contradictions.

**Step 1.2: Impact Analysis**

```
## Impact Analysis

Files affected:
Breaking changes:
Cross-file implications:
Alternative approaches:
New assumptions (need validation):
```

**Step 1.3: Proposed Plan**

```
## Proposed Plan

1. Step…
2. Step…
3. Step…

Why this plan:
- Based on patterns…
- Based on business rules…
```

→ Ask for explicit user approval before implementing.

### Phase 2 — Execute

For each file to be modified:

**Step 2.1: Pre-Change Context Check**

```
## Pre-Change Check

- Code matches assumptions?
- Related files unchanged?
- Plan still valid?
```

If there's a discrepancy → stop and ask the user.

**Step 2.2: Implement**

- Follow validated plan
- Use existing patterns
- Keep changes minimal and targeted
- Pause if new uncertainty appears
- Tag inline questions with `// QUESTION:`

### Phase 3 — Test

**Step 3.1: Testing Framework (Pytest-First)**

- Default testing framework for this repo: **pytest**
- Preferred commands (unless the task clearly needs something more specific):
  - `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
  - Or targeted subsets (e.g. `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_settings_manager.py -v`)
- If pytest is not available or the project explicitly documents a different runner for a given task:
  - Ask the user which framework/command to use
  - Do not proceed with testing until the framework is confirmed

**Step 3.2: Run and interpret tests (using pytest by default):**

```
## Test Results

Testing framework used:
Unit tests:
Integration tests:
Manual scenario tests:
Side effects:
Regression checks:
Behavior matches validated assumptions?
```

If tests reveal unexpected behavior → stop and ask the user.

### Phase 4 — Update Context
