# Agent Instructions

## Project Scope

- `OpenAI-Compatible Images` maintains the Standalone Skill and Codex App Plugin from one repository.
- Shared image logic lives in `scripts/`; each distribution uses its own adapter without duplicating the shared implementation.
- The Codex Plugin consists of `skills/`, `mcp/`, `web/`, `.mcp.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and the prebuilt `dist/` directory.
- Track `dist/` in Git. Update it only through `npm run build`; do not edit it by hand.

## Package Management

- Use npm with `package-lock.json` for Node dependencies.
- Use Python 3.12. Production Python code uses only the standard library.
- Do not install global packages or modify user-level `PATH`, registry entries, or Codex configuration.

## Checks

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Smart regression | `npm test` or `npm run test:smart` |
| Full release regression | `npm run test:release` |
| One test suite | `npm run test:suite -- <suite>` |
| One Node test file | `node --test tests/<suite>/<file>.mjs` |
| One Python test file | `python -m unittest discover -s tests/<suite> -p <file>.py` |
| Build the Plugin | `npm run build` |
| Check the Plugin | `npm run check` |
| Compile Python files | `python -m compileall -q scripts` |
| Check diffs | `git diff --check` |

## Module Boundaries

- `scripts/`: authentication, image requests, response validation, post-processing, delivery, and QA; independent of Codex, MCP, and the widget.
- `mcp/`: tool schemas, project binding, artifact storage, and runtime calls; does not construct provider image requests.
- `web/`: result cards and the focused canvas; does not read credentials or connect directly to image services.
- `skills/openai-compatible-imagegen/`: Plugin runtime tool selection and parameter decisions.
- Root `SKILL.md` and `references/`: Standalone runtime contract.
- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`: Git marketplace entry; Plugin sources must follow the marketplace checkout.
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json`: keep package identity and version aligned.

## Behavior Constraints

- Do not replace or impersonate Codex's built-in `image_gen` capability.
- Do not read or modify Codex task records, the App database, or unpublished host protocols.
- Do not automatically switch models, providers, endpoints, authentication sources, request protocols, or editing routes.
- Keep images, edit versions, and delivered artifacts immutable. Failed operations must not leave index entries pointing to incomplete files.
- Project configuration may override only fields allowed by the public contract.
- Never write credentials to logs, tool results, test fixtures, documentation, release packages, or commits.

## Tests and Documentation

- Add a test that reproduces the target behavior before implementing a feature or fixing a defect.
- Use smart regression for routine work. Unmapped paths must fail and receive an explicit impact rule; they must not trigger an automatic full regression.
- Run the full regression only through `npm run test:release` during release preparation.
- Keep tests in their owning suite and shared fixtures in `tests/support/`; test modules must not import helpers from another test module.
- Validate both the Standalone and Plugin adapters when shared image logic changes.
- Changes to MCP, the widget, Plugin manifests, or the marketplace require matching Node tests.
- Run Codex App acceptance during development when a change affects Plugin manifests or marketplaces, host loading, installation or cache identity, tool injection, the MCP Apps bridge, or behavior that deterministic automation cannot observe.
- Otherwise defer Codex App acceptance to the final release candidate. Every final release candidate requires acceptance on available target platforms; record unavailable platforms as unverified and follow the active release plan's platform matrix.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` and affected public guides when user-visible behavior changes.
- `README.md` serves first-time visitors; `docs/guides/` serves users; `AGENTS.md` serves contributors; distribution `SKILL.md` files serve runtime agents.
- Public content must not contain credentials, private endpoints, local absolute paths, test output, or unpublished implementation plans.

## Release

- One version and tag produce both the Standalone Skill ZIP and the Codex Plugin ZIP.
- The Git marketplace Plugin must contain `dist/server.mjs`, `dist/widget/`, and `dist/scripts/`.
- Before release, verify that marketplace metadata, Plugin manifests, package metadata, tags, and artifact versions agree.
- Freeze the version in `CHANGELOG.md` and add `.github/release-notes/<tag>.md` before creating the annotated tag.
- Release notes require a summary, `Highlights`, `Install`, and `Known limitations`; new releases also require `Commits` / `涉及提交` with change areas, commit links, and the complete version comparison as described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The Release title is exactly the version tag.
- Follow the active release plan's platform matrix. Require independently built Windows and Linux candidates to have identical file sets and bytes only when that release includes cross-platform reproducibility as a gate.
