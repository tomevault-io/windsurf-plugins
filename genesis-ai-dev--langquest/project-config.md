# Security Development Principles for Expo & React Native

These rules define essential practices for writing secure code in Expo and React Native applications.

**Source:** Based on [cursor-security-rules](https://github.com/matank001/cursor-security-rules) by Matan Kotick and Amit Ziv.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Do Not Expose Secrets in Client-Side Code

- **Rule:** Secrets such as API keys, credentials, private keys, or tokens must never appear in client-side code, public repositories, or bundled app files.
- **Action:**
  - Use environment variables with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix for non-sensitive config only
  - Store sensitive data in `expo-secure-store` or backend
  - Never commit secrets to version control

### 2. Use Secure Storage for Sensitive Data

- **Rule:** Sensitive data (tokens, passwords, PII) must be stored securely, not in AsyncStorage or plain text.
- **Action:**
  - Use `expo-secure-store` for sensitive data
  - Never store credentials in AsyncStorage, SharedPreferences, or UserDefaults

### 3. Enforce Secure Communication Protocols

- **Rule:** Only secure protocols (HTTPS, TLS) must be used for all external communications.
- **Action:**
  - Never use HTTP for API calls or data transmission
  - Enforce TLS/HTTPS in all `fetch()` calls and API requests

### 4. Validate All User Input

- **Rule:** All user input must be validated before use, especially before sending to backend, database, or rendering.
- **Action:**
  - Validate input type, length, and format on the client
  - Use allow-lists where possible
  - Remember: client-side validation is for UX only; backend must also validate

### 5. Do Not Log Sensitive Information

- **Rule:** Logs must not contain credentials, tokens, personal identifiers, or other sensitive data.
- **Action:**
  - Sanitize logs before writing
  - Avoid logging user input, API keys, or tokens
  - Be careful with React Native debuggers and console logs

### 6. Avoid Executing Dynamic Code

- **Rule:** Dynamically constructed code or expressions must not be executed at runtime.
- **Action:**
  - Avoid `eval()`, `Function()`, or similar dynamic code execution
  - Never execute user-provided code strings
  - Be cautious with WebView content and injected scripts

### 7. Never Trust Client-Side Security Logic

- **Rule:** Critical security logic (authentication, authorization, validation) must never rely solely on client-side code.
- **Action:**
  - Always validate and enforce security on the backend/Supabase
  - Client-side checks are for UX only
  - Use Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for data access control

### 8. Sanitize Data Before Rendering

- **Rule:** User-generated content must be sanitized before rendering to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Action:**
  - Escape HTML/JavaScript in text content
  - Be careful with WebView content
  - Validate URLs before rendering links

## Secure Local Database Usage (PowerSync + Drizzle ORM)

- **Rule:** Never construct SQL queries by concatenating or interpolating user input directly into the query string.
- **Action:** Use Drizzle ORM query builder (`system.db.query.*`) which automatically parameterizes queries. Never use raw SQL with string interpolation or `db.execute()` with user input.

## PowerSync Security

**Critical:** PowerSync Sync Rules control what data users can access.

- **Sync Rules** are defined in `supabase/config/sync-rules.yml`
- Never expose sensitive data in global buckets — use user-specific buckets with `request.user_id()`
- Review Sync Rules changes carefully — they control what data syncs to which users
- Never expose PowerSync JWT secrets in client code
- Validate data on client before PowerSync uploads to backend

## File Operations

- Validate file paths and restrict to app's document directory
- Never use user input directly in file paths
- Check file types and sizes before processing

## Deep Links and URL Handling

- Validate deep link URLs before processing
- Sanitize URL parameters
- Don't trust deep link data without validation
