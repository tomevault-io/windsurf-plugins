# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Interactive visual tutorial website for understanding AI from first principles. Built with Next.js 16 (App Router), MDX, and interactive React widgets. Currently Chapter 1 is implemented; 17 chapters are planned (see `docs/plans/curriculum-outline.md`).

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start dev server at localhost:3000
pnpm build            # Production build
pnpm lint             # ESLint + MDX validation
pnpm test:notebooks   # Execute all Jupyter notebooks (requires Python + torch)
npx playwright test   # E2E tests (expects dev server running)
```

## Architecture

### Routing & Content

Pages use Next.js App Router with a `(tutorial)` route group:

```
src/app/(tutorial)/{slug}/
  page.tsx        — Chapter page wrapper
  content.mdx     — MDX article content
  widgets.tsx     — Dynamic imports for chapter widgets (ssr: false)
```

Chapter metadata (title, slug, prerequisites, descriptions) lives in `src/lib/curriculum.ts`. The homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`) renders a chapter grid from this data.

### MDX Pipeline

- `@next/mdx` with `remark-math` + `rehype-katex` (LaTeX) + `rehype-pretty-code` (Shiki syntax highlighting)
- Custom MDX components registered in `mdx-components.tsx`: `<Callout>`, `<KeyInsight>`, `<Lead>`, `<TryIt>`, `<TryItInPyTorch>`
- MDX component source in `src/components/mdx/`

### Widget System

Widgets are client-side interactive components (`"use client"`) organized by chapter topic:

```
src/components/widgets/
  shared/             — WidgetContainer, SliderControl, SelectControl, ToggleControl
  computation/        — Chapter 1 widgets
```

**Pattern for widgets**: Each widget wraps in `<WidgetContainer>` for consistent chrome (title, description, reset button). Widgets are dynamically imported with `next/dynamic` + `{ ssr: false }` and wrapped in `<Suspense>`.

### Layout Structure

- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Root layout with `SiteHeader`, Geist fonts
- `src/app/(tutorial)/layout.tsx` — Tutorial layout with `SideNav`
- `src/components/layout/` — SiteHeader, SideNav, ChapterNav

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS 4 with `@tailwindcss/typography` for prose
- Design tokens as CSS custom properties in `src/app/globals.css` (e.g., `--color-accent`, `--color-surface`)

## Adding a New Chapter

1. Add chapter metadata to `src/lib/curriculum.ts`
2. Create `src/app/(tutorial)/{slug}/` with `page.tsx`, `content.mdx`, `widgets.tsx`
3. Create widgets in `src/components/widgets/{topic}/`
4. Follow the `01-computation` chapter as a template

## PyTorch Notebooks

The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks — one per chapter — that let readers run real PyTorch code in Google Colab. Each chapter's `content.mdx` links to its notebook via the `<TryItInPyTorch notebook="...">` component, which builds a Colab URL: `https://colab.research.google.com/github/robennals/ai-explained/blob/main/notebooks/{name}.ipynb`

When modifying a chapter, check if the companion notebook needs updating. When adding a new chapter, create a companion notebook following the existing pattern.

Every term must be defined before it's used in the notebook — either with a brief inline explanation, or a reference to the chapter where it's covered (e.g. "nn.Linear uses matrix multiplication — see Chapter 5"). See `docs/plans/pytorch-prerequisites.md` for the full forward-reference tracking.

Test notebooks: `pnpm test:notebooks` (requires `pip install torch matplotlib jupyter tiktoken`). Note: notebook 04 downloads ~66MB of GloVe embeddings on first run.

## MDX Gotchas

- **Never use raw `<p>` tags in MDX files.** MDX wraps paragraph text in its own `<p>`, so a raw `<p>text</p>` becomes `<p><p>text</p></p>` — invalid HTML that causes React hydration errors. Use `<Lead>` for intro paragraphs or `<div>` if you need a block wrapper. The `pnpm lint` command includes a check for this (`scripts/lint-mdx-no-raw-p.sh`).

## Large Files

**Never commit large data files** (model weights, embeddings, datasets, zip archives) to git. These bloat the repo permanently — even removing them later leaves them in history.

- `data/` — local directory for large downloaded files, fully gitignored. Scripts and notebooks should download what they need here on demand.
- `notebooks/` — gitignore covers `glove.*` and other large artifacts. Notebooks should download data at runtime (see `04-embeddings.ipynb` for the pattern).

If a script needs a large file, it should check if the file exists and download it if not, rather than expecting it to be in the repo.

## Key Conventions

- Import alias: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`
- Widgets are always client components with local `useState` (no global state library)
- Widgets are playgrounds, not demos — designed for experimentation and discovery (see `docs/plans/curriculum-outline.md` for editorial philosophy)
- D3 for data visualizations, Framer Motion for animations, Radix UI for accessible controls
