# tanban — architecture notes

A keyboard-driven kanban TUI built on **`@opentui/core`** (imperative API) and
run with **Bun**. TypeScript throughout, strict mode.

## Run / test

- `bun start` — launch the app (requires a TTY).
- `bun test` — runs `tests/`. `storage.test.ts` covers persistence + archiving;
  `app.test.ts` drives the real app through OpenTUI's headless test renderer
  (`@opentui/core/testing` → `createTestRenderer`, `mockInput`, `captureCharFrame`).
- `bun run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`.
- `bun run build` / `bun run install:bin` — compile a standalone binary
  (`bun build --compile`) and install it to `~/.local/bin/tanban`. Bun embeds
  OpenTUI's native `libopentui.dylib`, so the binary is self-contained.

## Layout

```
index.ts            Entry: load state, archive expired, create renderer, start app.
src/types.ts        Task / Status / Day / Board / BoardState model. STATUSES is column order, DAYS is group order.
src/storage.ts      Load/save (atomic), XDG paths, v2→v4 migration, weekly (Sunday) archiving, history log.
src/tasks.ts        Pure selectors: columnTasks/groupByDay, daysUntilArchive, history grouping, wrapText.
src/theme.ts        COLUMNS (status→title/accent) and the colour palette.
src/app.ts          KanbanApp: mode state machine + the single global key handler.
src/ui/board.ts     BoardView: persistent header/columns/footer; rebuilds cards on render.
src/ui/form.ts      TaskForm modal (add/edit): title Input + description Textarea.
src/ui/prompt.ts    PromptView modal: single-line text input (new/rename board name).
src/ui/detail.ts    DetailView modal (read-only task view).
src/ui/help.ts      HelpView modal; BINDINGS is the source of truth for the help list.
src/ui/history.ts   HistoryView modal: scrollable completed-work log (per board).
src/ui/confirm.ts   ConfirmView modal (delete task / delete board, y/n).
```

## Boards (dimensions)

- **State holds many boards.** `BoardState = { version, boards: Board[],
  activeBoardId }`; each `Board` has its own `tasks: Task[]`. The app shows one
  board at a time; **Tab / Shift+Tab cycle** through them, and the header is a
  tab strip of board names (active one bold). `b` creates a board, `r` renames
  the active one, `⇧D` deletes it (never the last). All selectors/actions in
  `app.ts` operate on `activeBoard()`.
- **Migration.** `parseState` wraps a legacy flat `{ tasks }` file (v1/v2) into
  a single board named "main" (v3), and `parseTask` backfills a missing `day`
  from the task's creation weekday (v4). `activeBoardId` falls back to the first
  board if stale.
- **History is per board.** `HistoryEntry` carries a `boardId`; the history view
  filters to the active board. Entries with no `boardId` (legacy) are attributed
  to the first board (`defaultBoardId()`). Deleting a board calls
  `removeBoardHistory` to drop its entries from `history.jsonl`.

## Key conventions & gotchas

- **Single global key handler.** `app.ts` registers one
  `renderer.keyInput.on("keypress", ...)` and dispatches by `mode`. OpenTUI runs
  global keypress listeners *before* the focused renderable, and `key.preventDefault()`
  stops the focused widget from also seeing the key (verified in
  `lib/KeyHandler` → `emitWithPriority`). So: in board mode we `preventDefault`
  everything we handle; in form mode we only intercept Tab / Ctrl+S / Esc /
  Enter (plain Enter saves from either field; Shift+Enter inserts a newline in
  the description) and let every other key fall through to the focused input.
  Prompt mode (board name) is the same idea: intercept Enter / Esc, let the rest
  reach the input. In board mode, Tab / Shift+Tab cycle boards.
- **Key names** come from `parseKeypress`: lowercase `name` (`"h"`, `"return"`,
  `"escape"`, `"tab"`, `"left"`, `"space"`) plus `shift` / `ctrl` flags. Capitals
  are `name:"h", shift:true`. Use those, not raw sequences.
- **Ordering** within a column is `columnTasks()`: day groups Mon→Sun, and inside
  a group the order of the active board's `tasks` — there is no separate order
  field. `BoardSelection.row` indexes that flattened list, so `j`/`k` step over
  the day headers. Mutations build the desired display order and hand it to
  `writeColumnOrder`, which drops it back into the slots that column already
  occupies so no other column shifts.
- **Day groups.** Every task carries a `day` (`mon`..`sun`), set by hand and never
  derived; new tasks take today's weekday. A column renders a header only for a
  day that holds a task, so most days are invisible most of the time. `⇧J`/`⇧K`
  swaps inside a group and, at the group edge, carries the card into the
  *adjacent* day — the next day, not the next occupied one, so pressing repeatedly
  reaches every day. `1`..`7` sets the day outright (Mon..Sun) and is the only way
  to reach a far empty day in one press. `⇧H`/`⇧L` changes column and keeps the day.
- **Archiving** prunes done tasks completed before the current week's start
  (most recent Sunday), so last week's Done clears out each Sunday. It runs at
  startup (`archiveExpired` in `index.ts`) and again at each local-midnight
  rollover during a long session (`maybeSweep` in `app.ts`). A task gets
  `completedAt` when it enters Done and loses it when it leaves.
