description: Inspect, analyze, validate, and modify civil-engineering DXF (and DXF-converted DWG) drawings using ezdxf. Use this skill whenever the user mentions a .dxf or .dwg file, AutoCAD drawings, site plans, plats, road/drainage/utility drawings, layer cleanup, quantity takeoffs, title-block updates, CAD standards checks, or any task that involves reading or writing CAD drawings. Always reach for this skill before trying to read a DXF with cat/grep/head or any text tool — DXF files are too big and too s

# DXF Civil Engineering Skill

A workflow harness for working with civil-engineering CAD drawings using `ezdxf` and progressive disclosure. Optimized for big files (10MB+) where dumping raw contents into context is hopeless.

## The Golden Rules

These rules exist because violating them wastes context and produces bad output. Follow them.

1. **Never read DXF files directly.** Do not `cat`, `head`, `grep`, or `view` a `.dxf` file. They are large, structured group-code text — unreadable to humans and a waste of context for you. Always go through the scripts in this skill.

2. **Always start with `summary.py`.** Before any other action on a drawing, run `python scripts/summary.py <file.dxf>` to get the JSON map of the drawing. Everything else is a drill-down from that summary.

3. **Render before reasoning about geometry.** If a task involves spatial relationships ("is the inlet near the curb?", "do these polylines connect?"), run `render.py` first and *look at the image*. Coordinates lie; pictures don't.

4. **Never modify files in `input/`.** All writes go to `output/`. If the user hasn't set up those folders, ask before writing anywhere near the source file. When in doubt, save to a `.modified.dxf` sibling.

5. **Use `ezdxf.recover` for messy files.** Real-world DXFs (especially from non-Autodesk tools or old exports) are often slightly malformed. The scripts here use `recover.readfile()` by default, which handles minor corruption. If you write your own one-off scripts, do the same.

6. **For files >100MB, stream don't load.** Use `iterdxf` patterns (see `scripts/_lib.py`) instead of loading the whole document into memory.

7. **Check `standards/layers.yml` before creating or renaming layers.** This file encodes the office's CAD standard. New layers must conform. If the user's drawing uses a different convention, ask before "normalizing" it.

## The Workflow

For any task, follow this loop:

```
1. summary.py          → get the map
2. render.py           → see the drawing (if spatial)
3. drill down with:    layer.py / query.py / spatial.py
4. (if modifying)      write your script, dry-run, then apply
5. validate.py         → confirm output is sound
```

Do not skip steps 1 and 2 to "save time" — they cost a few seconds and save many minutes of guessing.

## When To Use Each Script

All scripts live in `scripts/` and are runnable as `python scripts/NAME.py --help`.

### `summary.py` — the always-first call

Returns a JSON snapshot: DXF version, units, drawing extents, layouts, xrefs, every layer (color, linetype, entity counts, per-layer bounding box), block definitions and insertion counts, a sample of text labels, and audit results.

Output is JSON to stdout. Pipe to `jq` or read it back as a dict. Keep the JSON if you'll reference it again — re-running is cheap but not free on huge files.

```bash
python scripts/summary.py drawings/site.dxf > /tmp/site-summary.json
```

### `render.py` — see the drawing

Renders the modelspace (or a specific paperspace layout) to a PNG. Supports layer filtering, bbox cropping, and DPI control. Use it liberally — once per spatial reasoning step.

```bash
# Whole modelspace
python scripts/render.py drawings/site.dxf --out preview.png

# Just storm and sanitary layers, high-res
python scripts/render.py drawings/site.dxf --layers "C-STORM-*,C-SAN-*" --dpi 300 --out storm.png

# A specific paperspace layout
python scripts/render.py drawings/site.dxf --layout "Sheet C-101" --out c101.png

# Crop to a bbox
python scripts/render.py drawings/site.dxf --bbox 1000,2000,1500,2500 --out detail.png
```

After rendering, view the PNG (you have vision; use it). Then plan.

### `layer.py` — drill into one layer

Lists entities on a specific layer with their attributes and key geometry. Use after the summary tells you which layer is interesting.

```bash
python scripts/layer.py drawings/site.dxf --layer C-STORM-PIPE
python scripts/layer.py drawings/site.dxf --layer C-STORM-PIPE --type LWPOLYLINE
```

### `query.py` — find text

Searches MTEXT, TEXT, attributes, and dimension overrides for a regex pattern. Use for finding callouts, station numbers, structure IDs, title block fields.

```bash
python scripts/query.py drawings/site.dxf --pattern "MH-\d+"
python scripts/query.py drawings/site.dxf --pattern "STA \d+\+\d+" --layer "*-TEXT"
```

### `spatial.py` — find entities by location

Returns entities near a point (radius) or inside a bounding box.

```bash
python scripts/spatial.py drawings/site.dxf --near 1234.5,6789.0 --radius 50
python scripts/spatial.py drawings/site.dxf --bbox 1000,2000,1500,2500
```

### `validate.py` — audit + standards check

Runs `ezdxf` structural audit and checks layers against `standards/layers.yml`. Reports unrecoverable errors, malformed entities, and layers that don't conform to the office standard.

```bash
