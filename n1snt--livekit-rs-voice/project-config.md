# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents and contributors working in this repository.

## Project

`livekit-rs-voice` is a **monorepo** for voice-only, LiveKit-wire-compatible services in Rust, drop-in replacements for the corresponding `livekit-server` components: `livekit-voice` (the SFU) and `livekit-egress` (the recorder). Existing LiveKit clients, `livekit-agents`, and the `livekit/sip` + `livekit/egress` containers connect unchanged. Each service ships as its own small Docker image.

### Hard constraints

- **Wire compatibility is the contract.** Never change proto field numbers, message names, protojson casing, enum string names, Twirp routes/error codes, or WebSocket framing. The vendored `.proto` files in `protos/` are the source of truth; if unsure about a wire name, check the generated code in `target/.../out/`.
- **Audio only.** Video is out of scope; reject or ignore video tracks.
- **Multi-node over Redis.** When `redis.cluster: true`, nodes register, rooms are hosted on one node, and signaling is relayed to the hosting node over Redis streams (`cluster.rs`). This node-to-node clustering is Rust-native and does not interoperate with Go `livekit-server` nodes. The exception is the SIP/egress bridges: `psrpc.rs` implements the psrpc v0.7 wire protocol (Redis PubSub) so `CreateSIPParticipant`/`TransferSIPParticipant` reach a real `livekit/sip` container and `StartEgress` reaches `livekit-egress`. When disabled (default), every room is local.
- **Lean docs.** The readme covers only benchmarks and the differences from `livekit-server`. Do not add docs that re-document LiveKit behavior.
- **Never add or commit secrets/API keys.**

## Commands

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace              # includes a real WebRTC media loopback
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings   # must be clean
cargo fmt --all                                          # must be clean
cargo bench -p lk-proto --bench proto
cargo bench -p lk-server --bench core
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs fmt, clippy, tests, and a release build on every push/PR. Keep all four green.

## Layout

```
crates/lk-proto/    prost types + protojson serde, generated from protos/
                    (build.rs uses protox, no protoc binary needed).
                    Edit the .proto files, never the generated code.
crates/lk-server/   the server:
  config.rs         YAML config (LiveKit-compatible). Default impls must mirror
                    the reference defaults; partial YAML blocks must merge onto
                    them, not reset to zero.
  auth.rs           HS256 JWT verification + video grants (iss -> api key,
                    sub -> identity, canPublish/canSubscribe default true).
  http.rs           axum router: Twirp dispatch, WS upgrades, auth, CORS,
                    body/message-size limits.
  signal.rs         WS sessions, join flow, SignalRequest handlers, webhooks.
  media.rs          WebRTC SFU: publisher/subscriber PCs, RTP forwarding,
                    subscriber negotiation, data channels.
  audio_level.rs    RFC 6464 active-speaker detection.
  room.rs / participant.rs / track.rs   state models.
  agent.rs          worker registry + job dispatch (/agent).
  services.rs / services_sip.rs   Twirp method implementations.
  psrpc.rs          psrpc v0.7 wire protocol (Redis PubSub): client for
                    outbound SIP, server for the IOInfoSIP service.
  ioservice.rs      IOInfoSIP handlers (inbound trunk auth + dispatch rules).
  redis_store.rs    optional Redis store for SIP/egress container interop.
  webhook.rs / server.rs / metrics.rs  webhooks, room manager, metrics.
                    metrics.rs exposes the reference `livekit-server`
                    Prometheus contract (same names/labels/buckets), fed by
                    media-plane RTCP/RTP stats (see media.rs Forwarder).
crates/lk-egress/   the voice-only recorder (bin `livekit-egress`):
                    psrpc `EgressInternal` server (StartEgress), connects to
                    rooms as a subscriber, decodes Opus, mixes, and encodes to
                    WAV/MP3. Each crate ships its own Docker image.
```

## Rules

- **Never hold a `std::sync::Mutex` guard across an `.await`.** Futures must stay `Send` (axum's `on_upgrade` requires it). Scope locks to blocks, extract what you need, drop before awaiting. Use `tokio::sync` types for state held across awaits.
- **WebRTC callback closures that capture `Arc<Participant>` must use `Arc::downgrade` (Weak).** Capturing a strong ref in `on_track` / `on_message` / `on_ice_candidate` creates a reference cycle that leaks the participant and its media (this was a real memory-leak bug in `media.rs`).
- **No `unwrap()`/`expect()` on user-controlled input.** Use `Result`.
- **Broadcasts are best-effort:** `send_update` (bounded `try_send`) for fan-out; awaited `send` for request/response messages.
- **Do not block the join path on agent availability round-trips.** Spawn them (see `signal.rs` room-agent launch).
- **Enforce configured limits** (`limit.*`, message/body sizes). Do not let a client push unbounded data.
