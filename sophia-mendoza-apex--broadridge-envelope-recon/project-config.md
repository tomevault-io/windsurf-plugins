## Current State

### Final Reconciliation Numbers (audited, all sections consistent)

**Post-settlement (Mar 2022 - Dec 2025):**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Purchased | 21,039,500 |
| Used | 18,469,949 |
| Wastage (Est., contractual max) | 690,713 |
| Adj. Variance | +1,878,838 (+8.9%) |
| Total Invoiced | $1,575,143 |
| Buffer stock | ~9.0 months (policy: 2-3 months) |

**Full period (Jan 2020 - Dec 2025):**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Purchased | 30,065,500 |
| Used | 26,373,417 |
| Vendor Cost | $1,994,141 |
| Invoiced | $2,103,303 |

### Year-by-Year (post-settlement)
| Year | Purchased | Used | Variance | Var% |
|------|-----------|------|----------|------|
| 2022 (Mar-Dec) | 5,807,000 | 4,629,923 | +1,177,077 | +20.3% |
| 2023 | 6,571,000 | 6,081,272 | +489,728 | +7.5% |
| 2024 | 4,621,000 | 4,348,349 | +272,651 | +5.9% |
| 2025 | 4,040,500 | 3,410,405 | +630,095 | +15.6% |

### Contract Rates (verified from source PDFs)

**Original Schedule (Jan 2019 - Dec 2023):**
- Materials billed at cost + wastage (no margin)
- Wastage: 10% generic paper, 5% generic envelopes

**Amendment No. 1 (Jan 2024 - present):**
- Materials billed at inventory cost + 10% margin
- Generic inventory cost = vendor price + wastage (10% continuous, 3% cutsheet, 2% envelopes)
- Client-specific inventory cost = vendor price (no wastage)
- Generic stock: billed on usage. Client-specific stock: billed on receipt.

### Key Findings
- Usage declined 39% from 462,992/mo (2022) to 284,200/mo (2025)
- Broadridge admits 10-15% operational wastage vs 2% contract limit for envelopes
- Broadridge classifies our envelopes as **client-specific** (receipt-based billing). Our position: unbranded standard envelopes should be **generic** (usage-based).
- **Classification dispute (Mar 9):** Denci gave four shifting answers, ultimately conceding "yes they are standard envelopes" (Mar 6 PM). Sophia sent email Mar 9 pinning concession to contract language, asking to confirm generic classification.
- **Financial impact of misclassification: $225,870 (14.3%)** -- computed per-month comparing actual invoiced (receipt-based) vs generic terms (usage-based, with contractual wastage + margin). Added to Broadridge report but NOT yet cited in emails (strategic: establish principle first, bring dollars later).
