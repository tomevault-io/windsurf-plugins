The user might execute `git add`/`git restore` actively to observable/review your working progress, so DO NOT only rely on git status or related command to check files edits.

# Skills

## Explore external C# symbols

- Extensively use/load the `ilspycmd-find-implementation` skill when writing C# codes and you are not sure about any external symbol's behavior

## Line Ending Normalization

`normalize-line-endings` skill requires be use/load and you may follow the instructions in that skill before completing the givin task.

# Project Structure

```
src
+-- Snap.Nicole
+-- Snap.Nicole.Native
+-- Snap.Nicole.SourceGeneration
```

- Snap.Nicole: The main project. It primarily uses C#/WinUI 3 to build an agentic, multifunctional toolbox application.
- Snap.Nicole.Native: A supporting project that uses C++/WinRT to help the main project interact with the Windows system and to polyfill features that WinUI 3 does not provide.
- Snap.Nicole.SourceGeneration: A supporting `netstandard2.0` Roslyn incremental source generator project consumed by the main project as an analyzer to reduce repetitive code in settings models, WinUI dependency properties, native callback wrappers, and resource accessors.

## Snap.Nicole

### Architecture and patterns

- A SDK style project
- Extensively adopt Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting and Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection to manage the lifetime of applications, services, and objects. Services are registered at `Program.cs`.
- Extensively adopt the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to handle data presentation and user interactions.
- Extensively adopt Sentry to utilize it's error tracking and performance monitoring features.

### Type and file organization

- All top-level members like class/struct should be `internal` or `private`, unless XAML requires them to be `public` (for example, attached DependencyProperties and the `Application` class).
- Prefer one top-level type per file for models, result records, and enums. Split related types into files named after each type.
- For all `record` types, do not use positional record declarations or positional construction patterns. Prefer explicit properties and object initializers so members remain self-describing.

### Syntax and style

**IMPORTANT**: When writing code, find the best balance between **high performance** and **clean code**.

- Always try your best to avoid memory leak. Especially when:
	- Subscribing events, which is extremely dangerous when not properly unsubscribed.
	- Passing closure as callback argument, if the callback is not executed immediately, the callee might stores it and prevent GC to opt in.

- DO
	- Always normalize strings to uppercase before comparison when case-insensitive matching is required and `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase` is unavailable.
	- Always organize method arguments in single line, no matter how long they are. Wrap related arguments into context class/struct/record if necessary (Consider this when having more the 4 arguments).
	- When comparing an object with `null`, use `==` `!=` for WinRT Projection objects and the `is` `is not` pattern for all other types.
	- For read-only properties, do not use direct expression-bodied declarations like `Property => value;`; use an expression get accessor instead, for example `Property { get => value; }`. Keep accessors in the same line whenever possible.
	- For non-constant `string` or `string?` values that need an empty string, use `string.Empty` instead of `""`. Empty string literals are allowed only for constants (especially inside `[Attribute]` where `string.Empty` is not applicable) or the `is pattern`.
	- Use `Interlocked.Exchange` for atomic read-modify-write operations: `if (Interlocked.Exchange(ref value, true)) { return; }` instead of separate read and write operations:`if (value) { return; } value = true;`
	- When resolving multiple services from DI, single `IServiceProvider serviceProvider` argument is recommended, and resolve services from that serviceProvider, unless some parameters must be directly injected.
- DO NOT
	- Do not use expression-bodied syntax for methods, constructors, operators, or conversions. Lambdas or expressions inside method/property bodies are unaffected.
	- Avoid closures that capture more than 4 variables. Closures should generally be minimized; when a method has an overload that accepts a state argument, prefer that overload.
	- Non-static local functions should generally be avoided for the same reason as closures.

### Implementation choices

- Perfer uisng `System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicOperations` for general oneshot usage over certain types like `SHA256`,`MD5`

### Resources and reuse

- In `.resx` resources, single-line user-visible text should not end with a sentence-ending period. Preserve meaningful punctuation such as ellipses, URLs, file extensions, or multi-line prose.
- Do not reinvent the wheel when runtime libraries already provide equivalent functionality; use the `ilspycmd` command-line tool extensively to verify existing implementations before adding new code.
