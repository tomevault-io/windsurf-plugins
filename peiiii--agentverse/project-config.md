# File Size Limits and Code Organization

## Core Principle: Keep Files Small and Focused

### File Size Guidelines
- **Target**: Under 100 lines per file
- **Maximum**: 250 lines per file
- **When to split**: If a file exceeds 200 lines, consider refactoring

### Why Small Files Matter
1. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
2. **Testability**: Smaller units are easier to test
3. **Reusability**: Focused modules can be reused independently
4. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different files simultaneously
5. **Code Review**: Smaller changes are easier to review

## Refactoring Patterns

### When a File Gets Too Large

#### 1. Extract Types and Interfaces
```typescript
// Before: 300+ lines with mixed types and implementation
// After: Separate types.ts file
export interface MyInterface { ... }
export type MyType = ...;
```

#### 2. Split by Responsibility
```typescript
// Before: One large class with multiple responsibilities
// After: Multiple focused classes
- base-class.ts
- implementation-a.ts
- implementation-b.ts
```

#### 3. Extract Utilities
```typescript
// Before: Utility functions mixed with business logic
// After: Dedicated utils file
export function utilityFunction() { ... }
```

#### 4. Separate Concerns
```typescript
// Before: UI, logic, and data access in one file
// After: Separate files for each concern
- component.tsx (UI only)
- logic.ts (Business logic)
- data.ts (Data access)
```

## Directory Organization

### Service Bus Portal Example
The portal system demonstrates proper file organization:

```
portal/
├── types.ts                    # 80 lines - Type definitions only
├── base-portal.ts              # 50 lines - Abstract base class
├── postmessage-portal.ts       # 90 lines - PostMessage implementation
├── event-target-portal.ts      # 70 lines - EventTarget implementation
├── portal-factory.ts           # 60 lines - Factory methods
├── service-bus-portal-connector.ts  # 80 lines - Service integration
├── service-bus-portal-proxy.ts      # 90 lines - Proxy implementation
├── portal-composer.ts          # 80 lines - Multi-portal management
├── compatibility.ts            # 70 lines - Legacy support
└── index.ts                    # 30 lines - Exports only
```

## Refactoring Checklist

When a file approaches 200 lines:

- [ ] Can types be extracted to a separate file?
- [ ] Can the class be split into multiple classes?
- [ ] Can utility functions be moved to a utils file?
- [ ] Can the file be split by feature or responsibility?
- [ ] Are there clear boundaries between different concerns?
- [ ] Can some logic be moved to a separate service or hook?

## Benefits of Small Files

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each file has one clear purpose
2. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find relevant code
3. **Better Testing**: Smaller units are easier to test in isolation
4. **Reduced Conflicts**: Less chance of merge conflicts
5. **Improved Performance**: Smaller files load and parse faster
6. **Better IDE Support**: Faster autocomplete and navigation

## Examples of Good File Organization

### Before (Monolithic - 650 lines)
```typescript
// connect-service-bus-with-portal.ts - 650 lines
// Contains: types, implementations, factories, adapters, compatibility
```

### After (Modular - 10 files, each under 100 lines)
```typescript
// types.ts - 80 lines
// base-portal.ts - 50 lines  
// postmessage-portal.ts - 90 lines
// event-target-portal.ts - 70 lines
// portal-factory.ts - 60 lines
// service-bus-portal-connector.ts - 80 lines
// service-bus-portal-proxy.ts - 90 lines
// portal-composer.ts - 80 lines
// compatibility.ts - 70 lines
// index.ts - 30 lines
```

## Enforcement

- **Code Review**: Always flag files over 250 lines
- **Linting**: Consider adding file size limits to linting rules
- **Documentation**: Document the reasoning for any files over 200 lines
- **Refactoring**: Prioritize splitting large files in technical debt reviews
