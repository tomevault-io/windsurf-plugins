# UI Engineering Skill

## Overview

This skill provides a comprehensive library of **UI Engineering Specifications**. Each specification acts as a "stylesheet for logic", defining the exact colors, typography, interactions, and mental models for a specific style.

**When to use:**
- "Design a website like Apple"
- "Create a personal blog"
- "Build a dashboard like Stripe"
- "Make a PPT-style website"

## How to Use

### 1. Identify the Style
First, determine the most appropriate style for the user's request.
- Consult [Registry](references/_meta_registry.md) for a complete list of 60+ styles.

### 2. Read the Spec
Once a style is identified (e.g., `stripe`, `personal_blog`), read the corresponding reference file.
- Example: If the style is `stripe`, read `references/stripe.md`.

### 3. Apply the Rules
Use the Design Tokens, Component Recipes, and Tech Stack defined in the spec `references/[spec_name].md` to generate code. **Do not deviate** from the spec's defined hex codes or physics unless explicitly asked.

## Available References

### Core Registry
- [Meta Registry](references/_meta_registry.md): The master index of all styles, categorized by industry and vibe.

### High-Frequency Styles
- **SaaS / Fintech**: [Stripe](references/stripe.md), [Linear](references/linear.md)
- **Content / Blog**: [Personal Blog](references/personal_blog.md), [Notion](references/notion.md)
- **Presentation**: [Presentation Scroll](references/presentation_scroll.md)
- **Big Tech**: [Apple](references/apple.md), [Google](references/google.md), [Microsoft](references/microsoft.md)
