# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to LLM agents when working with this repository.

## Repository Overview

The Bindplane Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (BDOT Collector) is Bindplane's distribution of the upstream OpenTelemetry Collector. This is a Go-based project that implements the Open Agent Management Protocol (OpAMP) and supports both standalone and managed modes.

## Pull Request Content

The most important rule is not to post AI-generated comments on PRs or open PRs with summaries that are AI-generated. Discussions on the pull requests are for Users/Humans only.

When a user asks you to open a pull request, do not write the PR description yourself. Instead,
before creating the PR, prompt the user for the content of each section in the PR template
(Proposed Change, Documentation, Testing, Describe How The Reviewer Can Validate The Changes) and use their answers verbatim. Do not paraphrase, expand, or "improve" what the user writes. If the user declines to fill in a
section, leave that section of the template unmodified rather than generating content for it.

## Commit formatting

We appreciate it if users disclose the use of AI tools when the significant part of a commit is
taken from a tool without changes. When making a commit this should be disclosed through an
Assisted-by: commit message trailer.

Examples:

```
Assisted-by: ChatGPT 5.2
Assisted-by: Claude Opus 4.5
```

Do NOT use a `Co-authored-by:` trailer to disclose AI assistance. Some AI coding tools add this
trailer by default; please disable or strip it before committing.

## Development Commands

### Build Commands
- `make agent` - Build the collector via the OTel Collector Builder, using `manifests/observIQ/manifest.yaml` as the source of truth for components. Overwrites the ocb-generated `main.go` with `internal/extension/opampconnectionextension/cmd/main/main.go` so the managed/standalone runtime is wired in. Requires `builder` (`make install-ocb`; version pinned via `OCB_VERSION` in the Makefile).
- `make verify-manifest` - CI gate: regenerates sources from the manifest and compiles them. Fails if the manifest references unresolvable modules or has version drift. Cheap to run on every PR.
- `make agent-clean` - Wipe the ocb-generated `./build/` tree.
- `make updater` - Build just the updater binary for current OS/architecture
- `make build-binaries` - Build both collector and updater for current OS/architecture (default target)
- `make build-all` - Build for all supported platforms (Linux, Darwin, Windows)
- `make build-linux`, `make build-darwin`, `make build-windows` - Build for specific platforms

### Testing Commands
- `make test` - Run all tests with race detection
- `make test-no-race` - Run all tests without race detection
- `make test-with-cover` - Run tests with coverage reports
- `make test-updater-integration` - Run updater integration tests
- `make bench` - Run benchmarks

### Code Quality Commands
- `make ci-checks` - Run all CI checks (format, license, misspell, lint, gosec, test)
- `make lint` - Run revive linter
- `make fmt` - Format code with goimports
- `make check-fmt` - Check code formatting
- `make gosec` - Run security scanner
- `make misspell` - Check for misspellings in documentation
- `make misspell-fix` - Fix misspellings automatically

### Setup Commands
- `make install-tools` - Install all required development tools
- `make tidy` - Tidy go modules across all submodules
- `make generate` - Run go generate across all modules
- `make add-license` - Add license headers to source files
- `make check-license` - Check license headers

### Release Commands
- `make release version=vX.X.X` - Create and push release tags
- `make release-test` - Test release process locally
- `make release-prep` - Prepare release dependencies

## Project Architecture

### Core Components

The project is structured as an OpenTelemetry Collector distribution with custom components:

- **manifests/observIQ/manifest.yaml** - Canonical source of truth for components and their versions. Drives the `make agent` build.
- **internal/extension/opampconnectionextension/cmd/main/main.go** - Template `main.go` copied over ocb's generated `main.go`; calls into `internal/extension/opampconnectionextension/runtime` for managed/standalone dispatch.
- **internal/extension/opampconnectionextension/** - The OpAMP connection extension and its full managed-mode runtime cluster (collector lifecycle, OpAMP client, package state, report manager, measurements). Its own Go module; entry point `runtime.Run(Options)`.
- **internal/processor/snapshotprocessor/** - Bindplane snapshot processor. Its own internal Go module.

### Component Organization

Custom components are organized by type:
- **receiver/** - Custom receivers (AWS S3, M365, Okta, SAP NetWeaver, etc.)
- **processor/** - Custom processors (metric extraction, sampling, masking, etc.)
- **exporter/** - Custom exporters (Azure Blob, Chronicle, Google Cloud, Snowflake, etc.)
- **extension/** - Custom extensions (AWS S3 event, Bindplane extension)

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Dual Mode Operation**: The collector can run in standalone mode (using local config) or managed mode (via OpAMP)
