# Git Flow

Full guide: `docs/guides/git-flow.md`.

| Branch | Role |
|--------|------|
| `main` | Production |
| `develop` | Integration |
| `feat/*` `fix/*` `chore/*` `refactor/*` `docs/*` | Work |

1. **Never** commit or push directly to `main` or `develop` (the release bot is
   the only exception).
2. Branch from an up-to-date `develop`. PRs target `develop`; a release is a
   `develop` → `main` PR.
3. A hotfix may branch from `main` when it is genuinely urgent; sync it back to
   `develop` immediately.
4. Delete the branch after merge, then `git fetch --prune`. Never reuse a
   merged branch.
5. No force-push to `main` or `develop`.
6. **Commit only when the user asks.**
7. Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` …) — enforced by commitlint
   in the `commit-msg` hook.
8. Classify first; follow `docs/guides/new-feature.md`, `bugfix.md`,
   `refactor.md` or `chore.md`. Do not mix intents on one branch.
