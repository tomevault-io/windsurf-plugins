# TDD — business logic

Red → green → refactor. The test comes first, and it must fail for the right
reason before you write the implementation.

## Tested

- `src/domain/**`
- `src/features/*/domain/**`
- Any pure calculation or invariant

## Not tested

React components, styles, layout, snapshots. A snapshot test of a component is
a maintenance cost with no signal — do not add one, even "for coverage".

## Writing the test

- One behaviour per `it`, named as the rule it protects, not as the function it
  calls: `"rejects a duplicate name regardless of casing"`, not `"works"`.
- Assert on the error *type* from `src/domain/errors.ts`, not on the message —
  copy changes, semantics do not.
- Cover the boundary, not just the happy path: empty input, the limit itself,
  one past the limit, and the case that must be rejected.
- No mocks. If a rule needs the clock, a random value or a database row, that
  input is a parameter — this is what keeps the domain testable.
