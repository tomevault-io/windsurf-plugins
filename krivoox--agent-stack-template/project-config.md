# UI

Source of truth: `DESIGN.md`. Theme tokens: `src/app/globals.css`.

## Before writing UI

1. Reuse `src/components/ui/*`. Extend with a CVA `variant` / `size` rather
   than a one-off `className`.
2. Reuse the shell: `ContentPanel`, `SurfaceSection`, `FormSheet`, `FormField`.
3. No business rules in React.

## Mobile-first

Base styles target a phone (< 640px); enrich upward with `sm:` / `md:` / `lg:`.
Designing for desktop and patching with `max-md:` is the wrong direction.

- Tables: only identity + the primary value in the base layout; everything else
  `hidden sm:table-cell`.
- Forms: one column at base; grids from `sm:`.
- Primary controls at least ~40px tall on touch.

## Colour

Semantic classes only: `bg-background`, `bg-card`, `text-foreground`,
`text-muted-foreground`, `bg-primary`, `border-border`, `ring-ring`,
`sidebar-*`, and the accent tokens (`info`, `success`, `warning`,
`destructive`).

Forbidden in product UI: hex, raw `rgb()`, and Tailwind colour scales
(`bg-zinc-50`, `text-blue-600`). A new colour is a token in `:root` / `.dark`
plus an entry in `@theme inline` — never an inline value.

## Repetition

If a style combination appears three times, it becomes a CVA variant or a
component. Two is a coincidence; three is a pattern.

## States and motion

Every interactive element needs hover, focus-visible, disabled and loading.
Every list needs an empty state and an error state. Animate only `transform`
and `opacity`, under 300ms, and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Navigation

A new destination goes in `src/components/app-shell/nav-config.ts`. A link
added directly in a component never gets prefetched and never gets a title.
