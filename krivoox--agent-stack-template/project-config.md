# Project contract

Full guide: `AGENTS.md`. This rule is the always-loaded summary; do not
duplicate detail here, point to the document that owns it.

## Work type

Classify first (`AGENTS.md` → "Every turn"). Then open the matching guide.

- New behaviour → spec **Accepted** or **Shipped**, then `docs/guides/new-feature.md`
- Wrong current behaviour → `docs/guides/bugfix.md`
- Same behaviour, new shape → `docs/guides/refactor.md`
- Tooling / deps / CI / docs-only → `docs/guides/chore.md`
- Problem without a spec → `product-manager`, no product code

If a feature spec is Draft, do not write product code.

## Sources of truth

1. `docs/specs/<feature>.md` — business rules. Never invent one.
2. `docs/architecture.md` — layers, auth, data, performance.
3. `docs/stack.md` — what may not be substituted.
4. `docs/adr/` — accepted decisions.
5. `DESIGN.md` — UI only.

If a spec lacks the detail you need, update the spec before writing code.

## Stack (do not substitute without an ADR)

Next.js App Router · React · TypeScript strict · Better Auth · Prisma +
PostgreSQL · Zod + React Hook Form · TanStack Query · Zustand (UI state only) ·
Tailwind + shadcn/ui · Vitest.

Next.js in this repo may differ from your training data. Check
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before using an API you are unsure about.

## Layers

```
spec → domain tests → domain → services → actions → UI
```

- `src/domain/**`, `src/features/*/domain/**` — pure. No Next, React, Prisma or
  ambient clock.
- `src/features/*/services/**` — the only place Prisma is called.
- `src/features/*/actions/**` — `defineAction` / `defineWorkspaceAction` only.
- `src/app/**` — thin routes: compose, do not compute.
- `src/lib/env.ts` — the only reader of `process.env`.

## Hard rules

- Business logic in `domain/`, never in a component, action or service.
- Every business row carries `workspaceId`; every query filters by it.
- Server Actions are public endpoints: authenticate and authorise inside them.
- Semantic Tailwind tokens only; mobile-first.
- Commit only when the user asks.
