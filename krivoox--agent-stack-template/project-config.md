# Performance and navigation

Detail: `docs/architecture.md` §7.

## Required

1. Soft navigation only. The shell in `(app)/layout.tsx` is persistent; a full
   page reload during an authenticated session is a bug.
2. Every `(app)` segment ships a `loading.tsx` built on `PageSkeleton`.
3. `experimental.staleTimes.dynamic: 0`. Perceived speed comes from skeletons
   and prefetch, not from showing data captured before the last mutation.
4. Nav destinations live in `nav-config.ts` so idle prefetch covers them.
5. After a mutation, use `refreshAfterMutation` / `navigateAndRefresh` from
   `src/lib/navigation.ts`. A plain `router.push` can land on a Client Router
   Cache entry captured before the write.
6. Authenticated routes are `private, no-store` — add the prefix to
   `PRIVATE_ROUTE_PREFIXES` in `next.config.ts`.

## Forbidden

- Cross-request caching of tenant data (balances, membership, anything
  per-user).
- A service worker that caches HTML or `/api/*`. Static assets under
  `/_next/static/*` only — they are content-hashed and immutable.
- Offline UI that displays stale authoritative data. Users trust what they see;
  a stale number is worse than no number.
- Relaxing `staleTimes.dynamic` to make a page feel faster.
