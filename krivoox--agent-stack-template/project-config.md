# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Agent guide

> Rename this product in `src/lib/app-config.ts`, `package.json` and this file.
> Everything else is already generic.

## What this repository is

A production-shaped starting point for a multi-tenant web application, built so
that **coding agents produce consistent work without being told the same things
twice**. Conventions live in files an agent reads automatically, not in a
person's head.

The included `projects` feature is a **reference vertical slice**, not a
product. Read it, copy its shape, then delete it.

## Every turn

Classify the work **before** opening a file. Then follow the matching guide.
Do not start from the layer walkthrough until the type is known.

| The request is… | Do this | Do not |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| A problem, audience or outcome, no spec | `product-manager` → spec Draft | write product code |
| Spec exists but is Draft, or has open questions | resolve with the user; `domain-architect` if the rules are non-trivial | write product code |
| Spec **Accepted** or **Shipped**, new behaviour | [new-feature.md](docs/guides/new-feature.md) | skip the spec |
| Spec and code disagree | say which is wrong; fix that one | invent a third rule |
| Current behaviour is wrong | [bugfix.md](docs/guides/bugfix.md) | start a feature |
| Same behaviour, new shape | [refactor.md](docs/guides/refactor.md) | change a spec rule |
| Tooling, deps, CI, env, docs-only | [chore.md](docs/guides/chore.md) | sneak in behaviour |
| Copy, layout, existing actions | `ui-ux-developer` | put rules in React |
| Infra, migrations, deploy, secrets | `devops-engineer` | run destructive commands unasked |

**If a feature spec is Draft, do not write product code.** Accepted and
Shipped are the implementable states.

### Small or local models

You implement against a closed contract. You do not invent product.

- Classify, then open the matching guide. Do not skip it.
- If a rule is missing, the spec is Draft, or an ADR would reverse, stop and ask.
- Copy `src/features/projects/`. Do not invent a parallel shape.
- `npm run verify` is the gate. A red verify is not a suggestion.
- Leave scope, missing rules and stack changes to the user.

| [README.md](./README.md) | Local setup |

## Order of truth when implementing

0. Classify the work (table above). Open that guide.
1. `docs/README.md`
2. The relevant spec in `docs/specs/`
3. `docs/architecture.md` + `docs/stack.md` + `docs/adr/`
4. `docs/tdd-workflow.md`
5. `DESIGN.md` (UI only)

**Never invent a business rule.** If a spec is missing detail, update the spec
first, then write the code. A spec that disagrees with the code is a bug in one
of them — say which.

## Stack

Details in [docs/stack.md](./docs/stack.md). Do not substitute these without an
ADR and explicit approval:

- Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript strict, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- **Better Auth** for authentication
- **Prisma** + PostgreSQL
- Zod + React Hook Form, TanStack Query, Zustand (UI state only)
- Vitest for domain tests

## Layers

```
spec → domain tests → domain → services → actions → UI
```

```
src/
  domain/            shared pure logic (no framework imports)
  features/<name>/   domain/ services/ actions/ schemas/ components/
  lib/               env, auth, prisma, session, action helpers
  app/               thin routes
  components/ui/     shadcn primitives
```

| Layer | May import | Must not |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `domain` | other domain modules | Next, React, Prisma, `Date.now()` |
| `services` | domain, Prisma | React, decide user-facing copy |
| `actions` | services, schemas | contain business rules |
| `components` | actions, UI primitives | contain business rules |

Business rules live in `domain/`. If a calculation or an invariant is written
anywhere else, it is in the wrong place.
