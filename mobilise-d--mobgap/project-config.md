## Repository-local skills and refactoring

- When the same skill name is available from multiple locations, always use the repository-local skill under `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills/`. Repository-local skills take precedence over user-global skills. Do not load or apply the corresponding skill from `$HOME/.agents/skills/` when a repository-local version exists.
- Consider the repository's current publication state and backwards-compatibility requirements recorded in `.agents/refactor-policy.md` in all interactions.
