# Cursor Rules Creation and Generation

This meta-rule provides guidelines for creating and automatically generating Cursor Project Rules. It extends the basic creation guidelines to support building a comprehensive "stdlib" of rules that can be composed together, with specific adaptations for Swift projects.

## Rule Auto-Generation Approach

Cursor can be instructed to generate new rules based on observed patterns, successful implementations, or specific requirements. This approach enables rapidly building a rich library of rules for Swift development.

### Key Principles

* **Unix-Like Composition**: Design rules to be composable like Unix pipes, where the output of one rule can feed into another.
* **Continuous Learning**: Automatically update rules with learnings from successful implementations.
* **Templates Over Implementation**: Focus on creating rule templates that can be adapted rather than writing specific implementations.

## Prompting Cursor to Generate Rules

When asking Cursor to generate a new rule for Swift projects, use the following structure:

```
Create a Cursor rule for [specific purpose] that:
1. Defines [pattern/convention]
2. Works with files matching [glob pattern for Swift files]
3. Includes examples from [reference implementation]
4. Can compose with [other rules]
```

### Example Rule Generation Prompt

```
Create a Cursor rule for Swift protocol implementation that:
1. Defines standards for creating and implementing protocols
2. Works with files matching "Sources/**/*.swift"
3. Includes examples from our networking module
4. Can compose with our existing Swift naming conventions
```

## Building Your Rule Stdlib for Swift Projects

The "stdlib" approach involves:

1. **Core Infrastructure Rules**: Rules about where to place rules, how to name them, and how to compose them.
2. **Language-Specific Rules**: Rules for Swift language features, patterns, and best practices.
3. **Framework-Specific Rules**: Rules for UIKit, SwiftUI, Combine, etc.
4. **Architecture Rules**: Rules for architecture patterns like VIPER, MVVM, etc.
5. **Rule Composition Manifests**: Files that define how rules work together.

### Rule Composition

Rules can be composed by explicitly referencing other rules:

```markdown
---
title: Swift Network Layer Implementation
description: Guidelines for implementing network requests using our standardized approach
glob: "Sources/Networking/**/*.swift"
composes: ["swift-naming.mdc", "error-handling.mdc", "async-await.mdc"] 
---

# Swift Network Layer Implementation

This rule composes several other rules to define our complete network implementation pattern.

## Core Components

1. Follow naming conventions in [Swift Naming Conventions](mdc:swift-naming.mdc)
2. Implement error handling according to [Error Handling Standards](mdc:error-handling.mdc)
3. Use async/await as described in [Async/Await Patterns](mdc:async-await.mdc)

## Unique Aspects

[Network-specific patterns that aren't covered by the composed rules...]
```

## Rule Learning Workflow

After successfully implementing a requirement in Swift:

1. **Document the Pattern**: Identify the pattern that enabled success.
2. **Ask Cursor to Create/Update a Rule**:
   ```
   Based on our successful implementation of [feature], create a new rule (or update [existing-rule.mdc]) that captures:
   1. The pattern of [describe pattern]
   2. The key components: [list components]
   3. The error handling approach we used
   4. How we handled edge cases like [edge case]
   ```
3. **Link the Rule to Code Examples**: Always reference the actual implementation.
4. **Add to Composition Manifests**: Update any rule composition files to include the new/updated rule.

## Intervention and Improvement Cycle

When the LLM doesn't follow a rule correctly:

1. **Identify the Gap**: What aspect of the rule was misunderstood or ignored?
2. **Refine the Rule**: Make the rule more explicit about that aspect.
3. **Add Counterexamples**: Include examples of what not to do and why.
4. **Test the Updated Rule**: Try the implementation again.

This cycle creates increasingly accurate rules over time.

## Example Swift-Specific Rule Template

This template can be used by Cursor to generate rules for Swift projects:

```markdown
---
title: [Swift-Related Rule Name]
description: Guidelines for [Swift-specific purpose]
glob: "[pattern matching Swift files]"
alwaysApply: false
---

# [Rule Name]

## Introduction / Problem

[Why this rule exists and what problem it solves for Swift development.]

## Pattern Description

[Explain the Swift-specific pattern with code examples.]

```swift
// Example Swift code demonstrating the pattern
struct UserProfile: Codable {
    let id: UUID
    let username: String
    let email: String
    
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id
        case username
        case email
    }
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. [First step in implementing this pattern]
2. [Second step]
3. [Additional steps as needed]

## Real-World Examples

* [Link to Swift code in the project](mdc:../Sources/Path/To/Example.swift)

## Common Pitfalls

* [Common mistake 1 in Swift implementation]
* [Common mistake 2]
* [Other issues to watch for]
