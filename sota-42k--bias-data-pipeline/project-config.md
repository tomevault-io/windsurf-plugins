# Project: C-Section Decision Support Model (Bias-Aware Pipeline)

## Objective
Develop a machine learning pipeline to support C-section decisions. The core challenge is that the training data (based on US statistics) is considered biased due to the currently high/overused rate of C-sections. The goal is to propose a pipeline that can process this biased data effectively.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Generation
Generate synthetic datasets reflecting US population statistics:
- **Natality Meta Dataset**: Contains demographic and clinical features.
- **Maternal & Fetal Mortality Dataset**: Contains outcome labels.
- **Constraint**: Both datasets must share a common `id` for merging.

### 2. Evaluation Mapping
Create a mapping table to evaluate the current C-section usage based on the result dataset.
*(Specific instructions for creating this table will be provided later after the data is generated.)*

### 3. Model Development
Develop a simple, interpretable model to predict the necessity of C-section.
- **Model**: Logistic Regression.
- **Note**: The model architecture is secondary to the data pipeline and bias handling strategy.
