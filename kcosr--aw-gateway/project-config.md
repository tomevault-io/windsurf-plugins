# aw-gateway Agent Instructions

This repository contains `aw-gateway`, a gateway for disposable or reusable
container workspaces exposed through the host CLI, SSH-compatible clients, and
an optional JSON HTTP API.

## What This Repo Is

`aw-gateway` is a Rust gateway for disposable or reusable container workspaces.
It starts or reuses a configured container target, supervises in-container
services, exposes lifecycle and command operations through the host CLI and
optional JSON HTTP API, and uses SSH-compatible clients as the standard
interactive attach path to container-local SSH instead of the host shell or
host filesystem.

## Fast Bootstrap

1. Build: `cargo build`
2. Format: `cargo fmt`
3. Test: `cargo test`
4. Lint: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`
5. Release build: `cargo build --release`
6. Validate gateway config: `cargo run --bin aw-gateway -- --config aw-gateway.sample.toml config validate`
7. Validate agent config: `cargo run --bin aw-container-agent -- --config container-agent.sample.toml config validate`

## Development

- Use `cargo fmt`, `cargo test`, and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`
  before handing off substantial changes.
- Run `cargo build --release` before release-oriented or packaging changes.
- Keep protocol/proxy modes quiet on stdout. Use stderr/logs for diagnostics.
- Keep implementation generic where possible. Deployment-specific behavior
  should usually be expressed through config, not hard-coded.
- Prefer deterministic offline tests for config, dispatch, path, and lifecycle
  decisions.
- Update `README.md` for user-facing behavior, config, or workflow changes.

## Layout

- `src/bin/` contains small binary entrypoints.
- `src/config.rs` owns TOML schema and validation.
- `src/gateway.rs` owns host-side CLI dispatch and lifecycle orchestration.
- `src/gateway/` contains focused gateway support modules for client config,
  file utilities, health checks, HTTP API surface, identity/key handling,
  listener proxying, shared operation dispatch, status models, and session
  marker state.
- `src/agent.rs` owns in-container agent entrypoint dispatch.
- `src/agent/` contains focused container-agent support modules for SSH bridge,
  control socket dispatch, idle cleanup/reaper, process helpers, service
  supervision, shared agent state, socket helpers, and status projection.
- `src/ssh_dispatch.rs` owns `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND` parsing.
- `src/runtime.rs` owns Podman, Docker, and Colima command construction.
- `aw-gateway.sample.toml` and `container-agent.sample.toml` are the canonical
  sample configs.

## Changelog

Location: `CHANGELOG.md` (root)

### Format

Use these sections under `## [Unreleased]`:
- `### Breaking Changes` - API/config changes requiring migration
- `### Added` - New features
- `### Changed` - Changes to existing behavior
- `### Fixed` - Bug fixes
- `### Removed` - Removed features

### Rules

- New entries always go under `## [Unreleased]`.
- Append to existing subsections; do not create duplicate subsection headers.
- Do not edit already released version sections.
- Use inline PR links when a PR exists:
  `([#123](https://github.com/kcosr/aw-gateway/pull/123))`.

## Releasing

The first release version is `0.1.0`, matching `Cargo.toml`. Since the crate is
already set to that version, release it with:

```bash
node scripts/release.mjs current
```

For later releases:

```bash
node scripts/release.mjs patch    # Bug fixes, e.g. 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
node scripts/release.mjs minor    # New features, e.g. 0.1.1 -> 0.2.0
node scripts/release.mjs major    # Breaking changes, e.g. 0.2.0 -> 1.0.0
node scripts/release.mjs 0.2.3    # Explicit version
```

The release script verifies a clean `main` branch, optionally bumps
`Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, stamps `CHANGELOG.md`, commits and tags the
release, pushes to origin, creates a GitHub prerelease from the changelog
notes, then opens a new `## [Unreleased]` section for the next cycle.
