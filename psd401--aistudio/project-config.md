# Project Instructions

Use specification and guidelines as you build the app.

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy.

Your goal is to completely finish whatever I ask for.

You will see <ai_context> tags in the code. These are context tags that you should use to help you understand the codebase.

## Overview

This is a web app template.

## Tech Stack

## Rules

Follow these rules when building the app.

### General Rules

- Use `@` to import anything from the app unless otherwise specified
- Use kebab case for all files and folders unless otherwise specified
- Don't update shadcn components unless otherwise specified

#### Env Rules

- If you update environment variables, update the `.env.example` file
- All environment variables should go in `.env.local`
- Do not expose environment variables to the frontend
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables that need to be accessed from the frontend
- You may import environment variables in server actions and components by using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`
