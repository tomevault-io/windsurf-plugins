# Snapshot Testing Guide

## Updating Snapshots

When tests fail due to snapshot mismatches, update the snapshots using:

```bash
pnpm vitest run --update
```

or the short form:

```bash
pnpm vitest run -u
```

## When to Update Snapshots

- After making intentional changes to test behavior
- When fixing bugs that affect test output
- When adding new features that change build output
- After refactoring code that impacts test results

## Snapshot Files

Snapshots are stored in [test/**snapshots**/zshy.test.ts.snap](mdc:test/__snapshots__/zshy.test.ts.snap) and contain expected output from the zshy build tool tests.

## Best Practices

- Review the diff before updating snapshots to ensure changes are expected
- Only update snapshots when the new behavior is correct
- Commit snapshot updates separately from code changes for easier review
