      When introducing schema changes under `prisma/schema.prisma` or changing behaviors in `src/`, ensure:
      1) `prisma/seed.ts` stays valid and covers new required fields/relations.
      2) Add/update tests per repo rules in tests/** for changed behavior.
      3) Update scripts to support local dev DB population.

          Use:
          - `npm run db:up` to start Postgres
          - `npm run db:populate` to apply migrations and seed
          - `npm run db:backup` and `npm run db:restore <file>` to manage snapshots

On every change in this repository, keep tests and SEO assets up to date. Follow these rules strictly.

### Testing rules
- **Always update or add tests** that cover any behavior you change or add in `src/`.
- **Locations and mapping**:
  - For API route handlers in `src/app/api/**/route.ts` or `src/app/api/*.ts`: create or update tests in `tests/api/*.test.ts` mirroring the endpoint path and methods.
  - For React pages and components in `src/app/**` and `src/components/**`: test user-visible behavior in `tests/pages/**` and `tests/components/**` using Testing Library with JSDOM.
  - For hooks in `src/app/hooks/**`: add tests in `tests/hooks/**`.
  - For contexts in `src/app/contexts/**` or `src/contexts/**`: add tests in `tests/contexts/**`.
  - For utilities in `src/lib/**` and `src/app/utils/**`: add tests in `tests/lib/**` or `tests/utils/**`.
  - For middleware changes in `src/middleware.ts`: update `tests/middleware*.test.ts` accordingly.
- **What to cover**:
  - Happy path, common error paths, authorization/permission checks, edge cases, and regression cases for any fixed bug.
  - For API: validate status codes, response shapes, and side effects (e.g., DB writes, notifications) using existing patterns in `tests/api/*`.
  - For UI: assert accessible labels/roles, critical flows, and conditional rendering.
- **Keep tests deterministic**: avoid time/network flakiness; mock external services (e.g., GCP Storage, Clerk, email) as done in existing tests.
- **Commands to run locally before committing**:
  - Fast tests for staged files run via lint-staged. For full confidence, run:
    - `npm test`
    - `npm run test:coverage`
- **Do not lower coverage** without an explicit justification in the PR description and corresponding tests for new behavior.

### SEO rules
- **Sitemap and robots**:
  - `next-sitemap` is configured in `next-sitemap.config.js` and runs automatically after `npm run build` (via `postbuild`). Pre-commit runs `npm run build` via husky.
  - When adding, removing, or moving routes under `src/app/**`:
    - Update `exclude` and policies in `next-sitemap.config.js` if admin-only or private routes change (e.g., `/admin`, `/me`, `/api`).
    - Ensure `siteUrl` remains correct (prefer `process.env.SITE_URL`).
  - After route changes or SEO-relevant updates, regenerate and commit outputs in `public/` by running:
    - `npm run build` (triggers `next-sitemap`), or directly `npx next-sitemap`
  - Commit updated generated files in `public/` when they change: `sitemap.xml`, `sitemap-0.xml`, and `robots.txt`.
  - Do not manually hand-edit generated sitemap/robots; change the config and rebuild.
- **Per-page metadata** (Next.js 14):
  - For new pages or significant content changes, add or update `export const metadata` or `generateMetadata` with at least: `title`, `description`, canonical URL, Open Graph (og:title, og:description, og:url, og:image), and Twitter card.
  - Ensure pages that should not be indexed include `robots: { index: false, follow: false }` or are excluded in `next-sitemap.config.js`.
- **Static SEO files** in `public/` to maintain:
  - `public/security.txt` and `public/.well-known/security.txt` must match; update both when contact or policy changes.
  - `public/manifest.json` should reflect available icons; if you add icons in `public/`, update sizes/paths accordingly.
  - `public/llms.txt`, `public/humans.txt`, and any policy files must be kept current and consistent with site behavior.

### Definition of done for any change
- Tests exist and pass for the changed behavior (unit/integration as appropriate).
- SEO is correct:
  - Page metadata updated where relevant.
  - `next-sitemap.config.js` updated if route visibility changed.
  - Sitemaps/robots regenerated and committed when they change.
  - Static SEO files in `public/` reviewed and updated if impacted.

### Quick checklists
