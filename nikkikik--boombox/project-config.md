# Dev server (Boombox)

## Do not break a running dev server

- **Never** run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` / `npm run restart` is active — it corrupts `.next` and causes HTTP 500 until cache is cleared.
- Prefer `npm run lint` or TypeScript checks for validation during development.
- If you must verify production build, stop dev first or run build only when the user asks.

## After code changes

- Do **not** start a second dev server if one may already be running.
- Tell the user to run **`npm run restart`** only if the page shows 500 / blank / connection refused — not after every small edit (HMR should work).

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — frees ports 3000/3001, starts dev (fast).
- `npm run restart` / `npm run dev:clean` — same + deletes `.next` (fixes broken cache).
