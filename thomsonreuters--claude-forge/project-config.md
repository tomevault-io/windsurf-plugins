# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

`src/forge/` contains the Python app, split by domain (`cli/`, `session/`, `proxy/`, `guard/`, `core/`, `install/`,
`search/`, `review/`, `sidecar/`, `backend/`, `logs/`). Agent assets live in `src/skills/`, `src/commands/`, and
`src/agents/`. Tests are split by scope: `tests/src/` mirrors `src/forge/`, `tests/integration/` covers end-to-end and
Docker-backed flows, `tests/regression/` holds bug reproductions, and `tests/fixtures/` provides shared helpers. Keep
docs in `docs/`, runtime images in `docker/`, and automation scripts in `scripts/`.

## Documentation Guide

Use the repo docs as the source of truth for their domains: `README.md` for the overview, `docs/developer/` for setup,
and `CLAUDE.md` for agent context. `docs/developer/coding-standards.md`, `testing-guidelines.md`, and
`documentation-guidelines.md` define code style, test policy, and doc maintenance rules. Update `docs/design.md` and
`docs/design_appendix.md` when architecture or file ownership changes. When changing config ownership, auth resolution,
installer behavior, proxy/session semantics, or workflow prerequisites, also update the relevant `docs/end-user/*` guide
so wheel-installed users get the right Day 1 path.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use `uv` for dependencies and `make` for the standard workflow:

- `uv sync` installs runtime and dev dependencies.
- `uv run forge --help` checks the CLI entry point.
- `make test-unit` runs tests.
- `make test-integration` builds Docker images, starts test infrastructure, and runs integration-marked tests.
- `make test-regression` runs regression tests.
- `make lint`, `make format`, `make type-check`, and `make pre-commit` run Ruff, formatting, mypy, and the full hook
  suite.

## OSS Release & UX Verification

Editable installs can hide packaging and clean-environment bugs. For changes that affect `pyproject.toml`,
`scripts/setup.sh`, installer code, bundled extensions (`src/skills/`, `src/commands/`, `src/agents/`), or runtime files
loaded with `importlib.resources`, build a wheel/sdist and verify the behavior from a clean install path when practical.

For auth, proxy, and workflow changes, test the no-`.env` path explicitly: credentials should resolve from environment
variables first and `~/.forge/credentials.yaml` second, CLI failures should be actionable rather than raw tracebacks,
and workflow preflight should fail fast when required auth or proxies are missing. Remember that proxy health only
confirms the local proxy process is reachable; use `forge proxy start <proxy_id> --smoke-test` to verify upstream LLM
connectivity after first setup, credential changes, or proxy auth changes.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Target Python 3.11 with 4-space indentation and a 120-character line length. Use `snake_case` for modules, functions,
and variables, `CamelCase` for classes, and `UPPER_CASE` for constants. Follow the repo’s Python conventions: public
methods before private ones, type hints on public functions, and comments that explain why. Quality checks center on
Ruff and mypy; pre-commit also runs isort, Black, and gitleaks.

## Testing Guidelines

Use `pytest`, not `unittest`. Mirror source paths in `tests/src/` (for example, `src/forge/session/store.py` maps to
`tests/src/session/test_store.py`). Mark integration files with `pytest.mark.integration`. Name regression files
`test_bug_<id>_<description>.py` and mark them `regression`. Every bug fix should include a regression test, and broken
tests should be fixed or removed rather than skipped.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history follows conventional prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, and `chore:` with short imperative
subjects; issue references are appended when relevant, for example
`fix: session resume fails for nested worktree forks (#12)`. Branch from `main` and open PRs back to `main`. Before
requesting review, run `make pre-commit` and the relevant test targets, summarize behavior changes, list verification
commands, and link the issue. Include terminal output or screenshots when CLI-visible behavior changes.
