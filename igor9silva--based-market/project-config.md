When installing NPM packages, ALWAYS use `bun`. Never ever use npm, yarn, pmpn or other - always Bun. The same goes for running stuff. Instead of `npx` I'll always do `bunx`.

When using typescript/javascript, I'm used to add a blank comment line so prettier/Biome doens't remove that line. Specially for the very first line for a function declaration, I find it to be very important for readability, while also being unable to setup Prettier to keep that line blank.

Please, never remove those comments. In fact, I'd like you to add them.

Example:
```ts
export function useIsMobile() {
	//
	const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = React.useState<boolean | undefined>(undefined);

	React.useEffect(() => {
// ... rest of the code ...
```
------------------------------------
When using tailwind, NEVER use hardcoded values unless it's literally the only option. For example, instead of "min-w-[256px]", prefer to use tailwind conventions such as "min-w-64" *ALWAYS*
------------------------------------
Always prefer importing specific hooks from `React` over importing the entire library.
e.g. `import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'` instead of `import * as React from 'react'`

DO NOT EVER APOLOGIZE. It's fine to make mistakes, keep focused on fixing them.

Do not EVER remove comments. I'll do that manually when review the commit.
DO NOT MESS UP WITH MY INDENTATION.

Prefer `Boolean()` over `!!` as it's more readable.

Always use `bun` instead of `npm` or any other. Including `bunx` instead of `npx`.

***Everything*** should be type-safe. i.e. using `any` is STRICTLY forbidden.

`const` is preferable, avoid using `let` when possible.

// we do not Capitalize comments.

For validation ifs, oneliners are preferable.
e.g.
BAD
if (!element) {
	return;
}
GOOD
if (!element) return;
------------------------------------
Project uses TanStack (NOT Next.js).
Project uses Tailwind with shadcn-like components.
For form validation, we use TanStack.
For toasts/notifications, we use sonner (already present).
------------------------------------
all booleans should read like `isSomething` `hasSomething` `shouldDoShit`, like a yes/no question
------------------------------------
we use PascalCase for component files
------------------------------------
when doing multiple react Components on the same file, make sure the main Component is the first one on the file
smaller components should be AFTER the main component
------------------------------------
prefer array.concat() over [...spread] for performance reasons
------------------------------------
There is absolutetly no need to run the dev server or typechecks. `bun run dev` is ALWAYS running.
