# SiFli-SDK

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

SiFli SDK is an embedded firmware development framework built on RT-Thread RTOS, targeting SiFli Technologies' SoC family. The SDK supports five chip families: SF32LB52X, SF32LB55X, SF32LB56X, SF32LB57X, and SF32LB58X, with some supporting multi-core configurations (HCPU, LCPU and ACPU).

## Build System

The build system uses **SCons** with **Kconfig** for configuration. All builds must run inside a properly initialized environment.

### Environment Setup (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
./export.ps1
```

### Environment Setup (Linux/macOS)

```bash
source ./export.sh
```

### Building a Project

Navigate to an example's project directory which contains file `SConstruct` and `proj.conf`, then:

#### Build for a specific board
```
scons --board=<board_name> -j8
```
The artifacts are generated under directory `build_<board_name>`. 

#### Interactive configuration menu

```bash
sdk.py menuconfig --board=<board_name>
```

Example board names: `eh-lb551_hcpu`, `eh-lb563_hcpu`, `ec-lb583_hcpu`, `sf32lb52-lcd_n16r8_hcpu` for HCPU core.


### Configure a Board
Navigate to a board directory which contains file `board.conf` (`HCPU` and `LCPU` have separate folders), then type

```
sdk.py menuconfig
```

E.g., enter `customer/boards/sf32lb52-lcd_a128r16/hcpu` and execute `sdk.py menuconfig` to configure core `HCPU` of board `sf32lb52-lcd_a128r16`,
enter `customer/boards/sf32lb52-lcd_a128r16/lcpu` and execute `sdk.py menuconfig` to configure core `LCPU` of board `sf32lb52-lcd_a128r16`,


### Project Structure

Each example project contains:
- `SConscript` / `SConstruct` — SCons build definitions
- `Kconfig` / `Kconfig.proj` — configuration options
- `proj.conf` — default configuration values
- `rtconfig.py` — toolchain/compiler settings
- `<board_name>/ptab.json` or `<board_name>/ptab.yaml` — board-specific partition table

#### Dual-Core Projects

Some projects has user-defined LCPU firmware project, project structure lo like below

```
example/<name>/project/hcpu/   ← HCPU firmware project
example/<name>/project/lcpu/   ← LCPU firmware project
```

There's no need to build LCPU firmware separately. Just enter hcpu directory and run build command with HCPU board name, e.g. `sf32lb56-lcd_n16r12n1_hcpu` (suffix `_hcpu` could be omitted), it would build LCPU firmware automatically as LCPU is added as child project (by command `AddChildProj` in `SConstruct`).



### Configuration System

SDK uses Kconfig for configuration (Linux kernel style):
- Default values from Kconfig files
- Board-specific overrides in `board.conf`
- Project-specific overrides in `proj.conf`
- Final `.config` and `rtconfig.h` generated in `project/build_*/` during compilation

Configuration priority: `proj.conf` > `board.conf` > Kconfig defaults

## Architecture Layers

```
Application / Example
        ↓
Middleware (bluetooth stack, audio, DFU, app_fwk, crypto...)
        ↓
RT-Thread RTOS
  ├── RT-Thread Device Drivers
  └── RT-Thread Components
        ↓
HAL (drivers/hal/ — no OS dependency)
        ↓
CMSIS / SoC registers (drivers/cmsis/<soc>/)
        ↓
Hardware (Cortex-M33 HCPU, optional low-power LCPU co-processor)
```

**HAL vs RT-Thread Device Drivers**: HAL is OS-independent and manages interrupts directly. RT-Thread device drivers sit on top of HAL, expose a standard `rt_device_t` interface, and manage ISR registration through RT-Thread. Applications should prefer device drivers unless writing OS-independent code.

## Coding Style
- `.clang-format` for C code
