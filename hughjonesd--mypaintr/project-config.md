## Git Safety

- Ask before force-pushing. Do not run `git push --force` or `git push --force-with-lease` unless the user has explicitly approved it for the current operation in the chat conversation. A tool approval prompt, command escalation approval, or prior standing permission is not enough; ask in chat and wait for a clear affirmative reply before force-pushing.
