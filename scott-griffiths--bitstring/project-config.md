# Agent Guidance for Bitstring

This file gives project-specific guidance for automated coding assistants and contributors working on Bitstring.

## Project Snapshot

- Bitstring is a Python library for creating, analysing and modifying binary data at the bit level.
- `main` holds the in-development bitstring 5.0, a breaking-change rewrite built on [tibs](https://github.com/scott-griffiths/tibs), a sibling Rust/PyO3 library by the same author, for the core bit storage and manipulation. Expect the 5.0 API to still be settling on this branch.
- The stable 4.x line - pure Python, depends on `bitarray`, no tibs - lives on `4.x-maintenance` and is what's currently published to PyPI as `bitstring`. This file describes the `main`/5.0 architecture; `4.x-maintenance` predates the tibs core and much of it won't apply there.
- Targets Python 3.11+ (`requires-python = ">=3.11"`).
- MIT licensed.

## Repository Layout

- `bitstring/`: the package source.
  - `bits.py` / `bitarray_.py`: the two public bit containers - immutable `Bits` and mutable `BitArray(Bits)` - mirroring the immutable `Tibs` / mutable `Mutibs` split underneath.
  - `bitstore.py`: the intended sole point of contact with `tibs`. See "The tibs Boundary" below.
  - `bitstore_helpers.py`, `array_.py`, `dtypes.py`, `reader.py`, `utils.py`, `helpers.py`, `methods.py`: supporting modules for interpretation formats, the `Array` type, sequential `Reader`, and shared utilities.
  - `exceptions.py`: the module's exception types.
- `tests/`: pytest suite, including Hypothesis-based tests and benchmark tests (`test_benchmarks.py`, via `pytest-benchmark`).
- `doc/`: Sphinx source (`.rst`). `doc/html/` and `doc/_build/` are generated output - edit the `.rst` source, not generated HTML.
- `release_notes.md`: user-facing changelog, linked prominently from the README as the place to see what's changed.
- Generated or local-only, do not edit unless asked: `build/`, `dist/`, `bitstring.egg-info/`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `.benchmarks/`, `.hypothesis/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `__pycache__/`, `.idea/`.

## The tibs Boundary

- `bitstring/bitstore.py` is the intended sole point of contact with the `tibs` package (`Tibs`, `Mutibs`). It wraps them behind `ConstBitStore` and `MutableBitStore`, which share a `_BitStoreBase`.
- Several other modules currently import `tibs` directly too: `bits.py` and `bitarray_.py` (for the public `from_tibs`/`to_tibs` interop methods) and `bitstore_helpers.py` (for the per-value `Tibs.from_value(...)` conversions). Treat these as existing debt, not precedent - new code should go through `bitstore.py` rather than adding further direct `tibs` imports elsewhere.
- `tibs` itself lives in a sibling repository (`../tibs`) but is consumed as a normal PyPI dependency (`tibs >= 2.0.0rc2, < 3.0`; the pre-release lower bound is temporary until 2.0.0 final ships). If a task seems to need a change inside `tibs`, that belongs in the tibs repo - flag it rather than editing across the boundary.

## Public API Surface

- 4.x-era compatibility names (e.g. `tobytes`, `tolist`, and the longer dtype names `uint`, `int`, `float`, `uintbe`) are kept alongside their current equivalents rather than removed. They are deliberately not deprecated: no `DeprecationWarning` is raised and there's no plan to remove them, so don't add warnings to them or delete them as part of unrelated cleanup or "dead code" tidying. Only touch them if the task explicitly calls for it.
- There's no separate `.pyi` stub to keep in sync (unlike tibs's `tibs.pyi`) - `py.typed` marks the package as inline-typed, so a public API change just needs the signature updated in place.

## Development Workflow

- This is a `uv`-managed project (`uv.lock` present). `uv sync` installs the package and the `dev` dependency group (`pytest`, `hypothesis`, `gfloat`, `pytest-benchmark`). `tibs` is resolved from PyPI; since the pinned version is a pre-release, `uv` needs pre-releases enabled for it (`uv lock --prerelease=allow` / `UV_PRERELEASE=allow`) unless the constraint itself is enough for your uv version.
- Run the full suite with `pytest tests/ --benchmark-disable` (matches `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). For quick iteration, run a targeted file or test, e.g. `pytest tests/test_bits.py -k some_case`.
- Keep `tests/requirements.txt` in sync with the `dev` dependency group in `pyproject.toml` - CI installs from the former, local dev from the latter.
- There's no configured linter or type checker - no ruff, mypy, black, or flake8 config anywhere in the repo, and CI only builds and runs pytest. Match the surrounding code's style by eye; don't invent a `ruff check`/`mypy` step or assume one gates merges.

## Performance

- Performance still matters in this layer, even though the heavy bit-manipulation core now lives in tibs's Rust implementation. `dtypes.py`, `array_.py`, `reader.py`, and `bitstore_helpers.py` sit on hot paths (dtype lookup/parsing, `Array` element access, sequential reads) and should be checked against the benchmark tests (`tests/test_benchmarks.py`, results under `.benchmarks/`) when a change could plausibly affect them.
