# Payment Processing Best Practices

## Payment Security
- Always use HTTPS for all payment-related endpoints
- Implement proper webhook signature verification for all payment providers
- Never store sensitive payment data (use tokens and references)
- Encrypt payment-related data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls for payment endpoints
- Regular security audits for payment processing systems
- Follow PCI DSS compliance requirements

## Webhook Implementation
- Verify webhook signatures using timing-safe comparison
- Implement idempotency for all payment webhook events
- Use database transactions for payment state changes
- Handle webhook retries from payment providers gracefully
- Log payment webhook events (excluding sensitive data)
- Monitor webhook success rates and alert on failures
- Test webhook endpoints with payment provider sandbox environments

## Payment State Management
- Use database transactions for payment status updates
- Implement proper state machines for payment flows
- Handle edge cases like partial payments and refunds
- Synchronize payment data between local database and payment provider
- Implement proper rollback mechanisms for failed payments
- Track payment history and audit trails
- Handle subscription lifecycle events properly

## Error Handling
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for webhook responses
- Implement proper error logging for payment failures
- Never expose internal payment errors to end users
- Implement graceful degradation for payment system outages
- Handle payment provider API rate limits
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitor payment error rates and patterns

## Lemon Squeezy Integration
- Always verify X-Signature header using HMAC-SHA256
- Support critical webhook events: subscription_created, subscription_updated, subscription_cancelled, order_created, order_refunded
- Handle both test and production webhook environments
- Implement proper customer and subscription synchronization
- Use Lemon Squeezy checkout URLs for secure payment processing
- Handle Lemon Squeezy specific payment methods and currencies
- Test integration thoroughly in sandbox environment

## Stripe Integration
- Verify webhook signatures using Stripe's signature verification
- Handle Stripe webhook events: payment_intent, subscription, invoice events
- Use Stripe's idempotency keys for safe retries
- Implement proper handling of 3D Secure and payment confirmations
- Handle Stripe's webhook delivery guarantees and retries
- Use Stripe's test mode for development and testing
- Implement proper handling of disputed payments and chargebacks

## Data Privacy
- Follow GDPR requirements for customer payment data
- Implement proper data retention policies for payment information
- Anonymize or delete customer data upon request
- Never log credit card numbers or sensitive payment details
- Implement proper access controls for customer payment data
- Regular audits of payment data handling procedures
- Document data processing procedures for compliance

## Testing
- Test payment flows in sandbox/test environments
- Implement unit tests for payment webhook processing
- Test payment failure scenarios and edge cases
- Validate payment provider integration using test cards/accounts
- Test webhook signature verification with invalid signatures
- Implement integration tests for complete payment flows
- Regular penetration testing of payment endpoints

## Monitoring
- Monitor payment success/failure rates
- Track payment processing times and performance
- Set up alerts for payment system anomalies
- Monitor webhook delivery success rates
- Track customer payment experience metrics
- Implement dashboards for payment system health
- Regular review of payment processing logs

## Compliance
- Implement PCI DSS compliance requirements
- Follow payment provider compliance guidelines
- Document payment processing procedures
- Regular compliance audits and assessments
- Implement audit trails for all payment actions
- Train team members on payment security requirements
- Keep compliance documentation up to date

## Customer Experience
- Provide clear payment status feedback to customers
- Implement proper loading states during payment processing
- Handle payment failures gracefully with clear error messages
- Provide payment history and receipt functionality
- Implement proper payment confirmation flows
- Support multiple payment methods when possible
- Optimize payment flows for conversion

## Documentation
- Document all payment webhook endpoints and events
- Maintain payment integration guides and procedures
- Document payment error codes and troubleshooting steps
- Keep payment provider integration documentation updated
- Document payment testing procedures and test cases
- Maintain compliance documentation and procedures
- Regular review and updates of payment documentation
