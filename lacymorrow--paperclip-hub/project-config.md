# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## Definition
The Single Responsibility Principle states that "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor." In simpler terms, a class or function should have only one reason to change.

## Core Principles
- Each module has one clearly defined purpose
- Services handle only their domain concerns
- User creation belongs only in UserService
- Payment processing belongs only in PaymentService
- Side effects are managed by their respective services
- Cross-cutting concerns use service composition

## Signs of SRP Violations
- Methods doing multiple unrelated things
- Large service files (>300 lines)
- Services creating/managing entities outside their domain
- Duplicated logic across services
- A change in one feature requires changes in multiple services
- Conditional logic based on entity types
- Direct database access across domain boundaries

## Best Practices

### Service Organization
- Services should only manipulate their own domain entities
- UserService should be the ONLY place creating/updating users
- TeamService should be the ONLY place creating/updating teams
- PaymentService should NEVER create users directly
- Use service composition instead of cross-domain logic

### Correct Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ Good: PaymentService calls UserService for user creation
const user = await userService.ensureUserExists({
  email: payment.email,
  name: payment.name
});
await this.linkPaymentToUser(payment, user.id);

// ✅ Good: UserService manages all user creation side effects
async createUser(data) {
  const user = await this.insert(data);
  await this.createPersonalTeam(user.id);
  await this.createDefaultApiKey(user.id);
  return user;
}
```

### Incorrect Patterns
```typescript
// ❌ Bad: PaymentService creating users directly
const [user] = await db.insert(users).values({
  email: payment.email,
  name: payment.name
}).returning();

// ❌ Bad: Duplicated team creation logic
await db.insert(teams).values({
  id: randomUUID(),
  name: "Personal",
  userId: user.id
});
```

## Refactoring Guidelines

### When to Refactor
- When you find duplicated business logic
- When a service needs to know too much about another domain
- When adding a feature requires changes to multiple services
- When a service file exceeds 300 lines

### How to Refactor
1. Identify the "actor" responsible for each piece of functionality
2. Move methods to their appropriate service
3. Replace direct operations with service calls
4. Update tests to reflect new structure
5. Document service boundaries

## Examples

### User Creation
- UserService: responsible for creating users and all related side effects
- PaymentService: should NEVER create users directly
- AuthService: should defer to UserService for user creation

### Team Management
- TeamService: responsible for all team operations
- UserService: should call TeamService for team-related operations
- ProjectService: should call TeamService for team access checks

## Testing

- Test services in isolation using mocks for dependencies
- Verify service boundaries are respected in integration tests
- Don't test implementation details, test outcomes

## Monitoring for SRP Violations

- Regular code reviews focusing on service boundaries
- Static analysis for cyclomatic complexity
- Monitor file size growth over time
- Track cross-service dependencies
