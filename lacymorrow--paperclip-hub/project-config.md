# Project Overview

This is a Next.js project using:
- App Router
- Shadcn/UI
- Tailwind CSS
- Resend
- Builder.io
- Payload CMS 3
- NextAuth/AuthJS@v5
- TypeScript
- Bun

## Multi-Zone Architecture Support

Shipkit supports multi-zone deployment for scalable applications:

### Zone Configuration
- Main app serves core functionality (marketing, dashboard, auth)
- Secondary zones can be deployed for specialized content:
  - `/docs/*` - Documentation and guides
  - `/blog/*` - Blog and articles
  - `/ui/*` - UI component library showcase
  - `/tools/*` - Developer tools and utilities

### Zone Implementation Patterns
- Each zone uses a full Shipkit installation for consistency
- Zones are configured with `basePath` and `assetPrefix`
- Navigation between zones uses anchor tags (`<a>`) instead of Next.js `<Link>`
- Shared authentication and design system across zones
- Environment variables control zone routing and deployment

### Zone Development
```bash
# Clone Shipkit for each zone
git clone https://github.com/lacymorrow/shipkit.git shipkit-docs
git clone https://github.com/lacymorrow/shipkit.git shipkit-blog
git clone https://github.com/lacymorrow/shipkit.git shipkit-ui
git clone https://github.com/lacymorrow/shipkit.git shipkit-tools
```

## File Naming Conventions
- Use `kebab-case` for directories and files
- Use `.tsx` for React components
- Use `.ts` for TypeScript files
- Use `.test.tsx` for test files
- Use `.css` for style files
- Use `.mdx` for documentation
- Use `.mdc` for rule documentation

## Component Structure
- One component per file
- Export as named export (prefer arrow functions)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Keep components focused and small (under 500-700 lines)
- Follow atomic design principles
- Use descriptive, explicit variable names

## Code Organization Principles
- Make files small and discrete (under 500 lines when possible)
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Use the simplest solution first and only add complexity when necessary

## State Management Best Practices
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'
- Favor React Server Components (RSC)
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Avoid circular dependencies between state variables
- Don't update state directly inside useEffect without dependencies
- Use unidirectional data flow: parent state flowing to children
- For complex state transitions, implement dedicated functions rather than direct setters

## Navigation Patterns
- Prefer declarative links over imperative navigation (`router.push`)
- Use `src/components/primitives/link-with-transition` instead of `next/link`
- For styled links that look like buttons, use: `<Link className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant: "...", size: "..." }))} ...>`
- Only use router navigation for complex scenarios (form submissions with redirects)
- For multi-zone navigation, use anchor tags (`<a>`) between zones

## API Structure and Patterns
- RESTful endpoints in `app/api`
- Server actions in `server/actions`
- Services in `server/services`
- Type definitions in `types`
- Environment variables in `.env`
- Never use server actions to fetch data (use Server Components)
- Server actions should call services for server-side operations

## Performance Optimization
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
