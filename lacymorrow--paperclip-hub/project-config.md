# Deployment Best Practices

## Multi-Zone Deployment

### Zone Deployment Strategy
- Deploy each zone as separate Vercel project
- Use consistent naming: `main-shipkit`, `docs-shipkit`, `blog-shipkit`, `ui-shipkit`, `tools-shipkit`
- Configure environment variables pointing to zone URLs
- Assign custom domain to main application
- Test cross-zone navigation and functionality

### Zone Environment Configuration
- Main app contains zone domain environment variables
- Each zone has its own environment configuration
- Use separate databases or shared database per zone requirements
- Configure authentication to work across zones
- Set up monitoring for each zone independently

### Zone-Specific Optimizations
- Documentation zone: Static generation, search optimization
- Blog zone: ISR for posts, SEO optimization
- UI zone: Component isolation, visual regression testing
- Tools zone: Client-side rendering, real-time features

## Environment Setup
- Use `.env.local` for local development
- Use `.env.production` for production
- Use `.env.test` for testing
- Never commit environment files
- Document all required variables
- Use strong naming conventions
- Validate environment variables at startup

## Docker Configuration
- Use multi-stage builds
- Optimize layer caching
- Include only necessary files
- Use appropriate base images
- Set proper environment variables
- Configure health checks
- Document all configurations

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Automate build process
- Run tests before deployment
- Check code quality
- Scan for vulnerabilities
- Use proper caching
- Implement proper rollbacks
- Monitor deployment status

## Production Deployment
- Use proper build optimization
- Enable proper caching
- Configure proper headers
- Set up monitoring
- Configure logging
- Set up alerts
- Plan for scaling

## Infrastructure
- Use infrastructure as code
- Implement proper monitoring
- Set up logging
- Configure backups
- Plan for disaster recovery
- Document architecture
- Monitor costs

## Security
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Configure proper headers
- Implement rate limiting
- Set up WAF
- Monitor for threats
- Regular security audits
- Document security measures

## Monitoring
- Set up error tracking
- Monitor performance
- Track user metrics
- Set up alerting
- Log important events
- Monitor resources
- Track costs

## Scaling
- Plan for horizontal scaling
- Configure auto-scaling
- Optimize resource usage
- Monitor bottlenecks
- Plan capacity
- Document scaling strategy
- Test scaling scenarios

## Backup and Recovery
- Regular backups
- Test recovery procedures
- Document recovery plans
- Monitor backup status
- Plan for disasters
- Regular recovery tests
- Document procedures

## Documentation
- Document deployment process
- Document configuration
- Document dependencies
- Document troubleshooting
- Keep runbooks updated
- Document incidents
- Maintain change log
