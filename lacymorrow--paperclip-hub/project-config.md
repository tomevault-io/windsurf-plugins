# Shipkit Rules

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

This is a Next.js project using App Router, Shadcn/UI, Tailwind, Resend, Builder.io, Payload CMS v3, NextAuth/AuthJS v5, TypeScript, using Bun as the package manager.

Be aware of the latest versions of all libraries.
Your plans should be documented into a ai.mdx file. Check to see if it exists. If it does, pick up where you left off. Mark completed steps with a checkbox. Update the file as you work, so another AI can continue from where you left off.

Shipkit is a premium starter boilerplate for Next.js that allows customers to opt in to features by adding environment variables.

For example, you may launch with no environment variables at all. Adding a database will enable features like payload CMS. Adding a builder.io API key will enable the builder.io integration.

## Key Principles

- Authentication uses NextAuth/AuthJS v5.
- Authentication with credentials uses payload CMS user management.
- Use the Shadcn/UI components and styles when possible. This means colors, fonts, spacing, border-radius, etc. are already set up.

## Code sacred beliefs

- Thou shalt Make files small and discrete. When possible keep files under 500 lines, if at all possible.
- Thou shalt Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Thou shalt Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Thou shalt Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Thou shalt Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Thou shalt Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Thou shalt Use the simplest solution first and only add complexity when necessary.

## React State Management

- Avoid circular dependencies between state variables that can cause infinite update loops
- Don't update state directly inside useEffect without dependencies or conditions
- Don't use useState and useEffect when a single state update function would suffice
- When synchronizing two state variables, use a single source of truth approach
- For local storage integration, ensure state updates don't trigger unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer unidirectional data flow: parent state flowing to children
- When using multiple state variables that change together, consider useReducer
- Carefully analyze effects to avoid unwanted side effects and re-renders
- When a state update depends on previous state, always use the functional form (prev => ...)
- For complex state transitions, implement dedicated state management functions rather than direct setters

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

## UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

## Navigation Patterns

- Prefer declarative links over imperative navigation (`router.push`)
- In the App Router, use `src/components/primitives/link-with-transition` instead of `next/link`
- For styled links that look like buttons, use: `<Link className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant: "...", size: "..." }))} ...>`
- Only use router navigation for complex scenarios (e.g., form submissions with redirects)
- Prefer shallow routing when appropriate to avoid unnecessary data fetching
- Add proper aria labels to navigation elements

## Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

## Key Conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
- Use only for Web API access in small components.
- Avoid for data fetching or state management.

Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

## Don't

Don't delete environment variables.
Don't run the dev server (`bun dev`) in the terminal, User will do that.
Don't nest server components in client components unless passed through props.
Don't forget to add `use client` to the top of the file if you are using client-side code like hooks.
Don't use `use client` in server components.
Don't fetch data with server actions. AGAIN, DO NOT FETCH DATA WITH SERVER ACTIONS.

## Comments

pre-emptively add comments to explain "why" behind the code.
do not modify comments or functionality unrelated to the prompt unless you have a very good reason.
You will preserve all existing comments unless specifically asked to modify them
