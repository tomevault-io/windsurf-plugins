# Webhook Security Best Practices

## Signature Verification
- ALWAYS verify webhook signatures using timing-safe comparison
- Never accept webhooks without proper signature validation
- Use environment variables for webhook secrets
- Implement multiple signature algorithm support when available
- Log signature verification failures for security monitoring
- Never expose signature verification logic in error messages
- Use raw request body for signature validation (before JSON parsing)

## Request Validation
- Validate all webhook payload fields before processing
- Implement strict JSON schema validation
- Check for required fields and proper data types
- Sanitize all input data before database operations
- Validate webhook event types against expected values
- Implement payload size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- Check request headers for proper content-type

## Idempotency
- Implement idempotency using unique event identifiers
- Store processed webhook IDs to prevent duplicate processing
- Use database transactions for atomic operations
- Handle race conditions with proper locking mechanisms
- Implement retry logic for failed webhook processing
- Set appropriate timeouts for database operations
- Log all idempotency checks and outcomes

## Error Handling
- Return proper HTTP status codes (200 for success, 4xx for client errors)
- Implement comprehensive try/catch blocks
- Log all webhook processing errors with context
- Never expose internal error details in responses
- Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Use structured logging for better error analysis
- Set up alerts for webhook failure patterns

## Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting per webhook source
- Use sliding window or token bucket algorithms
- Configure different limits for different event types
- Monitor and alert on rate limit violations
- Implement progressive backoff for repeated violations
- Log all rate limiting actions
- Allow for burst traffic during normal operations

## Data Security
- Never log sensitive data from webhook payloads
- Encrypt webhook data at rest if storage is required
- Implement data retention policies for webhook logs
- Sanitize logs before external monitoring systems
- Use secure connections (HTTPS) for all webhook endpoints
- Validate SSL certificates in development and production
- Implement proper access controls for webhook endpoints

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Track webhook success/failure rates
- Monitor processing times and performance metrics
- Set up alerts for unusual patterns or failures
- Implement health checks for webhook endpoints
- Track payload sizes and processing volumes
- Monitor for potential security threats or attacks
- Regular review of webhook logs and metrics

## Testing
- Test signature verification with invalid signatures
- Test with malformed and oversized payloads
- Implement integration tests with webhook providers
- Test idempotency with duplicate events
- Test error handling and recovery scenarios
- Validate rate limiting behavior under load
- Test webhook endpoint availability and performance

## Database Security
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper database connection pooling
- Use database transactions for webhook data consistency
- Implement proper database access controls
- Regular database security audits
- Monitor database performance during webhook processing
- Implement database backup and recovery procedures

## Event Processing
- Process webhooks asynchronously when possible
- Implement proper queuing mechanisms for high-volume webhooks
- Use database transactions for multi-step operations
- Handle webhook dependencies and ordering when required
- Implement proper rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- Track processing status and provide visibility
- Implement dead letter queues for failed events

## Documentation
- Document all supported webhook events and formats
- Maintain webhook endpoint documentation
- Document security requirements and procedures
- Keep webhook integration guides updated
- Document error codes and troubleshooting steps
- Maintain webhook testing and validation procedures
- Document monitoring and alerting configurations

## Compliance
- Follow payment processor security requirements
- Implement PCI DSS compliance for payment webhooks
- Follow GDPR requirements for customer data processing
- Implement audit trails for compliance reporting
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Document compliance procedures and requirements
- Regular compliance training for development teams

## Lemon Squeezy Specific
- Always verify X-Signature header using HMAC-SHA256
- Support all critical webhook events (subscription.created, payment_success, etc.)
- Implement proper customer and subscription data synchronization
- Handle test vs production webhook environments correctly
- Implement proper error responses for Lemon Squeezy retry logic
- Follow Lemon Squeezy webhook documentation requirements
- Test webhook integration in Lemon Squeezy sandbox environment
