# Coding Style Guidelines

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `user-profile.tsx`)
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`)
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants

## File Structure
- Exported component
- Subcomponents
- Helpers
- Static content
- Types
- Keep files small (<200 lines)

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use maps instead
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Pre-emptively add types to all functions and variables
- Fix all TypeScript errors and warnings
- Use proper type imports

## React Components
- Use arrow functions for components:
  ```typescript
  ✅ export const Component = () => { ... }
  ❌ export function Component() { ... }
  ❌ export default function Component() { ... }
  ```
- One component per file
- Use named exports
- Keep components focused and small
- Document complex logic

## Comments
- Pre-emptively add comments to explain "why" behind the code
- Preserve existing comments unless specifically asked to modify
- Use callouts and examples:
  ```typescript
  /*
   * Logging configuration
   * @see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/logging
   */
  ```
- Document complex logic and important decisions

## Code Organization
- Group related code together
- Use index files for exports
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Follow DRY principles
- Pre-emptively optimize for production
- Keep code maintainable and readable

## Error Handling
- Handle all potential errors
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use proper error boundaries
- Log errors appropriately
- Document error scenarios

## Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Test edge cases
- Follow existing test patterns
- Document test coverage expectations
- Keep tests maintainable

## Best Practices
- Use open-source libraries when beneficial
- Follow security best practices
- Optimize for performance
- Consider accessibility
- Document architecture decisions
- Maintain consistency across codebase
