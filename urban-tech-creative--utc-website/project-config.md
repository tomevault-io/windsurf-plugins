# Session Handover

Last updated: 2026-03-09 (session 3)

## What happened this session

Performance fix for the 3D cube (GPU black-box artifacts) plus favicon replacement.

### 1. Cube face baking — GPU fix

The cube was causing black-box rendering artifacts in the browser. Root cause: `mix-blend-mode` inside `transform-style: preserve-3d` with continuous RAF animation exhausts the GPU compositor. Fixed by replacing the live face component layouts with static JPEG images captured from Storybook.

**Baked faces (done):** XR (`public/faces/xr.jpg`), Work (`public/faces/work.jpg`), Hamster (`public/faces/hamster.jpg`)

**Unbaked faces (still live):** AI, Collaborators, Showcase — these are placeholder layouts with no blend modes, so they're not causing GPU issues.

**Pattern:** Each baked face component (e.g. `XR.tsx`) returns a plain `<img src="/faces/xr.jpg" ... />`. The original FaceGrid layout is preserved as a named const (`XRDesign`, `WorkDesign`, `HamsterDesign`) so redesign + re-bake is possible without losing the source.

**Capture script:** `scripts/capture-face.ts` — runs `npx tsx scripts/capture-face.ts <face>`. Navigates Playwright to the canonical `Cube/Faces` Storybook story, screenshots the face element at 300×300 `@2x DPR` → 600×600 JPEG q90. JPEG (not PNG) gives 70-84% smaller files vs PNG with no visible quality loss on these designs.

**Image format note:** Playwright `element.screenshot()` only supports `png` and `jpeg` — no WebP natively. JPEG at q90 is the pragmatic choice. This project is on Cloudflare/OpenNext where `next/image` WebP conversion requires paid Cloudflare Image Resizing; static JPEG from CDN is simpler and good enough.

**Preload hints:** `app/page.tsx` uses `ReactDOM.preload()` to hoist preload hints for all three baked face images so they fetch in parallel with other page resources.

**Storybook story size:** `Faces.stories.tsx` decorator bumped from `200px` to `300px` (matches cube max size, so Playwright captures at the correct source resolution).

### 2. Favicon replacement

Replaced the default Vercel triangle (`favicon.ico` — deleted) with the UTC cube logomark.

- `app/icon.png` — 256×256 RGBA PNG, transparent background. Browser tab favicon, auto-registered by Next.js App Router.
- `app/apple-icon.png` — 180×180 RGBA PNG, transparent background. iOS "Add to Home Screen" touch icon.

**Capture script:** `scripts/capture-favicon.ts` — single command captures both. Navigates Playwright to dedicated Storybook stories (`FaviconCapture`, `AppleFaviconCapture` in `Logo.stories.tsx`), uses `page.screenshot({ type: 'png', omitBackground: true })` for transparency.

**Transparency gotcha (important for future):** Three separate background layers needed clearing before `omitBackground: true` worked:
1. `html { background: var(--theme-black) }` — app's `globals.css` — cleared via `documentElement.style.background = 'transparent'`
2. `body.sb-main-fullscreen { background: white }` — Storybook class — cleared by stripping `document.body.className`
3. Storybook's layout wrapper — `<div style="position: fixed; inset: 0; background: rgb(255,255,255)">` as first child of `#storybook-root`, inline style — cleared via `storybookRoot.firstElementChild.style.background = 'transparent'`. This was the hard one: inline styles can only be overridden by other inline styles, so no stylesheet `!important` approach works.

**Favicon stories:** `FaviconCapture` (128×128 viewport @2x → 256×256) and `AppleFaviconCapture` (90×90 viewport @2x → 180×180) added to `Logo.stories.tsx`. Containers are viewport-filling (`100vw × 100vh`) so `page.screenshot()` captures exactly the viewport, avoiding clipping from the CSS layout box that the 3D-transformed cube visually overflows.

### 3. Cursor skill added

`.cursor/skills/bake-cube-face/SKILL.md` — LM skill for both face baking and favicon capture workflows. Triggered when user says "bake", "capture", "snapshot", or "freeze" a face.

## Current state of the design system

### Component hierarchy

| Layer | Components |
|-------|-----------|
| Utilities | Pressable, Icon |
| Atoms | Frame, Accent, Heading, UIGrid, Overlay |
| Molecules | Button (primary/secondary/tertiary), NavLink, Logo lockup |
| Organisms | SiteHeader, PrimaryNav, NavMenuPanel, Cube, SectionDetail |

### Key interaction patterns

- **Button** = drop-in, opinionated, self-contained (use for standard actions)
- **Pressable** = zero-opinion wrapper (use for custom compositions like Logo lockups, NavLinks)
- **Hover** = cyan bg (Button built-in) or `group-hover:` (Pressable compositions)
- **Active/press** = `translate-y-1` downward shift, 100ms (Button built-in)
- **Focus** = 4px magenta outline, 2px offset (Button built-in; add manually for Pressable compositions)

### Cube face status

| Face | Position | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| XR | top | Baked → `public/faces/xr.jpg`, source in `XRDesign` const |
| Work | front | Baked → `public/faces/work.jpg`, source in `WorkDesign` const |
| Hamster | bottom | Baked → `public/faces/hamster.jpg`, source in `HamsterDesign` const |
| AI | back | Live placeholder — needs design |
| Collaborators | left | Live placeholder — needs design |
