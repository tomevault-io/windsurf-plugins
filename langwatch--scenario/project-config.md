When writing TypeScript code:

1. Follow SOLID principles strictly:
   - Single Responsibility Principle: Each class/function should have one reason to change
   - Open/Closed Principle: Open for extension, closed for modification
   - Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
   - Interface Segregation Principle: Many specific interfaces are better than one general interface
   - Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

2. Use TypeScript's type system effectively:
   - Never use `any` type
   - Use strict null checks
   - Define proper interfaces for all data structures
   - Use type guards and type predicates
   - Leverage discriminated unions for state management
   - Use readonly properties where appropriate
   - Prefer const assertions for literal types

3. Write clean, maintainable code:
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Keep functions small and focused
   - Use proper error handling
   - Follow consistent code style
   - Use proper indentation and formatting
   - Remove unused code and comments

4. Document everything:
   - Use JSDoc comments for all public APIs
   - Document complex algorithms
   - Explain business logic
   - Include examples in documentation
   - Document error conditions
   - Explain performance considerations

5. Handle errors properly:
   - Use custom error types
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Handle edge cases
   - Use proper error boundaries
   - Document error recovery strategies

6. Write testable code:
   - Use dependency injection
   - Follow the interface segregation principle
   - Make code modular
   - Avoid global state
   - Use proper mocking strategies

7. Optimize for performance:
   - Use proper data structures
   - Avoid unnecessary computations
   - Use proper caching strategies
   - Consider memory usage
   - Document performance implications

8. Follow security best practices:
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize user data
   - Use proper authentication
   - Follow least privilege principle
   - Document security considerations

9. Use proper design patterns:
   - Choose patterns that solve specific problems
   - Document pattern usage
   - Consider maintainability
   - Avoid over-engineering
   - Keep patterns consistent

10. Maintain code quality:
    - Use proper linting
    - Follow consistent naming conventions
    - Keep dependencies up to date
    - Document architectural decisions
    - Review code regularly

Remember: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, but it's not just JavaScript with types. Use its features to write better, safer code.
