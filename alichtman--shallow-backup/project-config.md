# CLAUDE.md — shallow-backup

## Project Overview

**shallow-backup** is a CLI backup tool for macOS and Linux that backs up dotfiles, app configs, installed packages, and fonts — with git integration and secret detection. Written in Python 3, developed with 3.12.

## Quick Reference

Commands sourced from `docs/development-guide.md` and verified against `Pipfile` / `setup.py`. All commands below run inside `pipenv shell` or prefixed with `pipenv run`.

```bash
# Dev environment setup (docs/development-guide.md)
pipenv shell
pipenv install --dev

# Run from source
python3 -m shallow_backup

# Install as editable package
pip install -e .

# Run tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage (note: some tests may fail with coverage — see docs/development-guide.md)
py.test --cov --cov-report html:code_coverage

# Interactive mode
shallow-backup

# Full backup
shallow-backup --backup-all

# Dry run
shallow-backup --dry-run
```

## Architecture

### Entry Point

`shallow_backup/__main__.py` — Click-based CLI. All flags map to backup/reinstall operations or config management. Entry point registered in `setup.py` as `shallow-backup=shallow_backup.__main__:cli`.

### Module Map

```
shallow_backup/
├── __main__.py        # CLI entry point (Click command)
├── backup.py          # backup_dotfiles(), backup_configs(), backup_packages(), backup_fonts()
├── reinstall.py       # reinstall_dots_sb(), reinstall_configs_sb(), reinstall_packages_sb(), reinstall_fonts_sb()
├── config.py          # JSON config file management (load, write, defaults)
├── git_wrapper.py     # Git init, commit, push, trufflehog hook installation
├── utils.py           # Shell commands, file ops, path helpers, condition evaluation
├── prompts.py         # Interactive menus (inquirer-based)
├── printing.py        # Colored terminal output helpers
├── constants.py       # ProjInfo class (version, author, URLs, ASCII logo)
├── compatibility.py   # OS-specific paths (macOS vs Linux)
└── upgrade.py         # Config version compatibility checking
```

### Key Flows

**Backup:** CLI args or interactive menu → create/verify backup dir → run selected backup functions → git add/commit/push with trufflehog pre-commit hook.

**Reinstall:** Read backup dir → evaluate per-file reinstall conditions → copy files back to original locations. Absolute paths stored with `:` prefix in config.

**Dotfile backup** uses multiprocessing for parallel file copying. Supports conditional backup/reinstall via bash expressions in config (`backup_condition` / `reinstall_condition`).

**Multi-system sync** (see README "Recipes" section, `git_wrapper.py`, `compatibility.py`, `backup.py`, `reinstall.py`): The backup directory is a git repo. The documented workflow for syncing dotfiles across machines (from README → "Synchronize dotfiles on multiple computers"):
1. **Machine A:** `shallow-backup --backup-dots` → commit and push to remote.
2. **Machine B:** Pull changes, run `shallow-backup --backup-dots`, resolve merge conflicts to produce a unified version.
3. Commit, push, then `shallow-backup --reinstall-dots` on Machine B.
4. **Machine A:** Pull and `shallow-backup --reinstall-dots`. Both machines are now in sync.

For a fresh machine (README → "Reinstall dotfiles from a backup"): clone the backup repo, set `backup_path` in the config to point at it, then run `shallow-backup --reinstall-dots`.

**OS-conditional backup/reinstall** (README → "Conditional Backup and Reinstallation", implemented in `utils.py:evaluate_condition()`): Use `backup_condition` and `reinstall_condition` in the config to skip OS-specific files. Example: `"backup_condition": "uname -a | grep Darwin"` only backs up on macOS. Empty string or omitted = always run.

**OS-specific paths** (`compatibility.py`): Handles platform differences — config paths (Sublime, VSCode, Terminal.app plist), font directories (`~/Library/Fonts` vs `/usr/local/share/fonts`), and application directories (`/Applications` vs `/usr/share/applications`).

**Secret detection** (README → "Git Integration", `git_wrapper.py:install_trufflehog_git_hook()`): `trufflehog` pre-commit hook runs before every commit. `.gitignore` files (configured via `root-gitignore` and `dotfiles-gitignore` config keys) exclude `.ssh/` and `.pypirc` by default.

**Nested dotfiles repo** (`git_wrapper.py:handle_separate_git_dir_in_dotfiles()`): If `dotfiles/` contains its own `.git`, it's treated as a submodule. `shallow-backup` prompts to commit/push the nested repo first before handling the parent.

### Config File

JSON config at `$SHALLOW_BACKUP_CONFIG_DIR/shallow-backup.json`, falling back to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/shallow-backup.json`, then `~/.config/shallow-backup.json`.

Key fields: `backup_path`, `dotfiles` (with optional conditions), `config_mapping`, `root-gitignore`, `dotfiles-gitignore`.

### Dependencies

- `click` — CLI framework
- `inquirer` — interactive prompts
- `colorama` — colored output
- `gitpython` — git operations
- `trufflehog` — secret detection (pre-commit hook, required)
