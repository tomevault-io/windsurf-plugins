## Build, Lint, and Test Commands

- **Build:**
  `bun run build` (uses tsdown)
- **Dev:**
  `bun run dev` (runs `start` subcommand with file watching)
- **Lint:**
  `bun run lint` (uses @antfu/eslint-config)
- **Lint & Fix staged files:**
  `bunx lint-staged`
- **Test all:**
   `bun test`
- **Test single file:**
   `bun test tests/messages-routing.test.ts`
- **Start (prod):**
  `bun run start` (runs `start` subcommand in production mode)
- **Daemon commands:**
  `bun run ./src/main.ts start -d` (background), `stop`, `restart`, `status`, `logs`, `enable`, `disable`
- **Live Copilot capability probes:**
  See [docs/copilot-capability-validation.md](docs/copilot-capability-validation.md#how-to-run-the-live-probes).

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Imports:**
  Use ESNext syntax. Prefer absolute imports via `~/*` for `src/*` (see `tsconfig.json`).
- **Formatting:**
  Follows Prettier (with `prettier-plugin-packagejson`). Run `bun run lint` to auto-fix.
- **Types:**
  Strict TypeScript (`strict: true`). Avoid `any`; use explicit types and interfaces.
- **Naming:**
  Use `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for types/classes.
- **Error Handling:**
  Use explicit error classes (see `src/lib/error.ts`). Avoid silent failures.
- **Unused:**
  Unused imports/variables are errors (`noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`).
- **Switches:**
  No fallthrough in switch statements.
- **Modules:**
  Use ESNext modules, no CommonJS.
- **Testing:**
   Use Bun's built-in test runner. Place tests in `tests/`, name as `*.test.ts`.
- **Linting:**
  Uses `@antfu/eslint-config` (see npm for details). Includes stylistic, unused imports, regex, and package.json rules.
- **Paths:**
  Use path aliases (`~/*`) for imports from `src/`.

## Proxy Capability Policy

- Treat GitHub Copilot upstream behavior as the source of truth for proxy pass-through decisions. Do not assume official OpenAI Responses or Anthropic API support implies Copilot support.
- For upstream-gated features, validate with the live capability probes documented in [docs/copilot-capability-validation.md](docs/copilot-capability-validation.md) before enabling new forwarding behavior.
- Supported upstream capabilities should be transparently forwarded. Known unsupported capabilities should fail locally or surface a clean upstream-aligned unsupported error instead of being silently dropped or rerouted into a false success.
- Do not route Anthropic `output_config.format=json_schema` to Claude `/chat/completions` as `response_format=json_schema`; native `/v1/messages` currently rejects it and the fallback can produce schema-invalid 200 responses. See [the Anthropic json_schema note](docs/copilot-capability-validation.md#important-nuance-for-anthropic-output_configformatjson_schema).
- When changing Responses routing, tool handling, MCP behavior, web search, image inputs, or structured output, run a real `codex` CLI smoke against the local `/v1/responses` proxy. Keep Codex config temporary, for example with `CODEX_HOME=/tmp/...`, and do not modify the user's `~/.codex`.
- When changing Anthropic `/v1/messages` routing, native passthrough sanitization, thinking/output_config handling, or Claude Code tool behavior, run a real `claude` CLI smoke against the local proxy. Use temporary local state and follow [the Claude Code smoke guidance](docs/copilot-capability-validation.md#claude-code-cli-smoke-tests).

## Request Abort and Upstream Cancellation Policy

- Do not pass Hono inbound request abort signals, especially `c.req.raw.signal`, into Copilot upstream fetch calls. This has repeatedly caused proxy clients such as NewAPI to surface 500s when the inbound request signal cancels upstream `/v1/responses` or `/v1/messages` work.
- Handle client disconnects at the response streaming boundary instead: check `stream.aborted` while writing SSE and stop writing to the client when needed. Do not use the inbound request signal as upstream cancellation unless there is fresh production evidence and the regression tests are updated deliberately.
- Before changing request-signal behavior, inspect `git log -S "signal: c.req.raw.signal"` and `tests/request-signal-regression.test.ts` to understand the v0.6.1/v0.7.6/v0.7.7 regression history. Treat reversing that test's semantic direction as high risk.
- When editing routes or services that call `createResponses`, `createAnthropicMessages`, `createChatCompletions`, `createEmbeddings`, or `forwardResponsesEndpoint`, run `bun test tests/request-signal-regression.test.ts`. The test's intent is to fail if any normal route forwards an inbound request signal upstream.
