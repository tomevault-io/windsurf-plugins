# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

AISecurity is a "General AI Security Layer" — a macOS menu-bar app plus a cross-platform Rust detection engine that guards AI agents (Claude Code, OpenClaw, etc.) and the host machine. All detection logic (pattern matching, scoring, redaction, policy) lives in Rust and is shared by every consumer; the Swift app and the standalone binaries are thin front-ends over it.

Note: the primary working directory (`AIS Learn`) contains only unrelated notes. The actual codebase is the `AISecurity/` working directory — do all work there.

## Architecture

Detection logic is written **once** in Rust (`SecurityCore/crates/security-core`) and consumed three ways:

1. **Swift macOS app** (`Sources/AISecurity`) — links the Rust `staticlib` through a C ABI. `build-rust.sh` compiles `security-core-ffi` into `CSecurityCore/lib/libsecurity_core_ffi.a` + a cbindgen-generated header; the `CSecurityCore` system-library target exposes it to Swift, and `RustBridge/SecurityCoreBridge.swift` wraps the C functions. Swift owns the UI, the launch-time integrity/keychain gating, file/process/TCC monitoring, and the encrypted Vault; it calls into Rust for every actual detection decision.
2. **Linux daemon** (`crates/security-linux`) — same core, native binary + TUI, no Swift.
3. **AI-agent integration binaries** (below) — link `security-core` directly as a Rust dependency.

### The daemon and the :7459 loopback service

The running app/daemon (`Core/SecurityDaemon.swift`) hosts an in-process HTTP listener on `127.0.0.1:7459` exposing `intent_verifier` and `privacy_router`. The AI-agent binaries are **thin relays** to this port so policy stays centralized in one running process:

- **`aisec-mcp`** — MCP server. Exposes `verify_intent` and `evaluate_privacy` as MCP tools (registered via `claude mcp add --scope user aisec …`). This is the `aisec` MCP server whose instructions appear in this session.
- **`intent-hook`** — Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook. Consults `intent_verifier` and returns allow/deny/ask; `install.sh` merges it into `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **`privacy-router`** — local forward-proxy for outbound LLM API calls (`HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7459`). Scans request bodies and applies allow/redact/warn/block.
- **`ai-exec`** — wraps a command in macOS `sandbox-exec` using the `[agents.*]` policy from config.

If the daemon isn't running, relays fail closed rather than making unguarded decisions.

### security-core module map

Each concern is one module in `crates/security-core/src/` with a matching config section. Detection modules: `threat_intent_parser` (7-layer scoring engine), `sensitive_data`, `prompt_injection`, `file_sanitizer`, `email_patterns`, `message_patterns`, `sender_whitelist`. Agent-facing policy: `intent_verifier`, `privacy_router`, `agent_policy`, `command_policy`, `model_verifier`/`model_vetting`, `package_vulns`, `threat_feeds`, `bypass`, `policy_audit`. Infrastructure: `config` (TOML + `MACSEC_*` env overrides), `path_resolver` (macOS vs Linux defaults), `encryption` (AES-256-GCM), `key_filter` (redaction), `wasm_sandbox` (wasmtime plugin loader), `tls_transport` (rustls log shipping), `vault`, `process_manager`, `local_services` (the :7459 handlers), `severity`, `alert`.

When adding a detection capability, add/extend the Rust module + its config section; the Swift `Modules/*.swift` file is a monitor/orchestrator that calls into it, not a second copy of the logic.

## Build & test

**Rust core** (from `SecurityCore/`):
```bash
cargo build --release -p security-core-ffi   # what build-rust.sh compiles for Swift
cargo test -p security-core                   # unit tests (~122)
cargo test --test cross_validation            # shared JSON suite validating Rust vs Swift parity
cargo test --workspace
cargo test -p security-core sensitive_data    # single module's tests
```

**Full macOS build** (from repo root):
```bash
./build-rust.sh release      # MUST run before/after any Rust change — Swift links the .a, edits to .rs are invisible until you rebuild it
swift build -c release
swift run AISecurity          # menu-bar app, no Dock icon (.accessory)
```
`.build/` (Swift) and `SecurityCore/target/` (Cargo) are build output.

**Full install** (builds everything, installs the `.app` + LaunchAgent, installs the agent binaries, wires the MCP server and PreToolUse hook):
```bash
./install.sh     # see uninstall.sh to reverse
```

## Config

Runtime config: `~/.mac-security/config.toml` (template: `config.toml.example`). One `[section]` per module. `MACSEC_*` environment variables override individual keys at highest priority (e.g. `MACSEC_MODE`, `MACSEC_SCAN_DIRS`).

`[general].mode` is `PRODUCTION | TESTING | DEVELOPMENT` and gates safety behavior — e.g. in `PRODUCTION` the default encryption passphrase is rejected, so `SECURITYCORE_PASSPHRASE` must be set for at-rest encryption of the whitelist/config secrets.
