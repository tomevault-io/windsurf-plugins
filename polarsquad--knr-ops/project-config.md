# AGENTS.md: knr-ops

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## What this repo is

A working reference implementation of a GitOps pattern for managing AWS
infrastructure through the Kubernetes API: no Terraform, no state files, no
second toolchain. A local kind cluster bootstraps Flux, which reconciles
everything else: CAPA-managed EKS workload clusters, per-cluster Flux
instances (CAPI addons), and ACK operators (S3, RDS, IAM) managing cloud
resources. There is no app source code here, only declarative infrastructure.

- `mgmt/aws/`: synced by the MANAGEMENT cluster's Flux.
  - `infrastructure/`: cert-manager, CAPI operator, CAPA identity, ACK
    controllers, pod-identity roles, account-global IAM, konflate.
  - `capi-providers/`: capi-system, capa-system, caaph-system.
  - `addons/flux-apps/`: installs Flux on each workload cluster
    (HelmChartProxy + ClusterResourceSets).
  - `clusters/`: EKS cluster definitions per region (`eu-north-1`,
    `eu-west-1`).
- `mgmt/local-host/`: the local-host management variant (kind-based).
  Same layout as `mgmt/aws/` (`clusters/docker`, `capi-providers/`,
  `addons/`, `infrastructure/`) with no cloud dependencies.
- `workload/`: synced by each WORKLOAD cluster's Flux.
  - `base/`: ACK controllers and S3/RDS/IAM custom resources.
  - `<region>-01/`: per-cluster overlays pointing at `../base`.
- `airgap/`: Zarf offline install kit for the local-host profile.
  `zarf.yaml` + `images.txt` define the packages; `scripts/` builds,
  renders, and stages the kit (`build-*`, `render-*`, `stage-*`,
  `offline-run.sh`); `archives/` and `rendered/` are gitignored outputs.
- `bootstrap.sh` / `teardown.sh`: the only imperative steps (one-time
  kind + Flux bootstrap, full teardown).
- `docs/`: detailed documentation (see the table in README.md).
- `mise.toml`: pinned tool versions and all task entrypoints.
  `mise.aws.toml` is the AWS tool layer (aws-cli, clusterawsadm),
  activated with `MISE_ENV=aws`.

## The golden rules (read before changing anything)

1. Edit YAML in Git; never mutate the clusters. Use kubectl to inspect live
   state, but make every persistent change here and let Flux converge.
2. Flux tracks `main`. Nothing reconciles until merged to `main`. Do not
   promise a fix is "live" until then.
3. Secrets via SOPS + age. Encrypted manifests are named `*.sops.yaml` and
   only `data`/`stringData` fields are encrypted (per `.sops.yaml`). Never
   commit plaintext secrets; `age.agekey` and `.env` are gitignored and must
   stay that way. Encrypt with `mise run sops-encrypt <file>`.
4. Run `mise run validate` before pushing. PRs are reviewed as rendered Flux
   diffs by the konflate GitHub Actions workflow (backed by an in-cluster
   instance), so what you push is what gets reviewed.

## Keeping this file current

When making changes that affect repository structure, architecture,
development workflows, build or test procedures, deployment workflows, or
other information used to navigate and understand the repository, update
`AGENTS.md` as part of the same pull request.

Do not update `AGENTS.md` for changes that do not affect repository
understanding or agent workflows.

## App layout convention

Each component pairs a plain kustomize root with a Flux `Kustomization`:

```
<scope>/<component>/
  kustomization.yaml   # kustomize.config.k8s.io: lists the manifests (+ flux-ks.yaml)
  flux-ks.yaml         # Flux Kustomization(s): path, dependsOn, wait
  ...                  # raw manifests (HelmRelease, CRs, ...)
```

- Register new components in the parent `kustomization.yaml` (the
  `flux-ks.yaml` entry) and use `dependsOn` / `wait: true` for ordering.
- Per-cluster values come from `postBuild.substituteFrom: cluster-vars`
  (`${AWS_REGION}`, `${CLUSTER_NAME}`), not from hardcoding.
- Adding a workload cluster or app is a documented multi-step procedure:
  follow `docs/extending.md` exactly rather than improvising.

## Common tasks (mise)

```sh
mise install            # install pinned tools (kubectl, kind, flux, sops, age, ...)
mise run validate       # build every kustomize overlay; mirrors CI
mise run bootstrap      # one-time kind cluster + Flux handoff
mise -E aws run kubeconfigs  # export AWS workload-cluster kubeconfigs
mise run teardown       # full teardown (EKS, AWS resources, kind)
```

## Where to look next

Load these only when the task touches their domain:

- `docs/architecture.md`: reconciliation order, how workload apps are delivered.
- `docs/extending.md`: adding a workload cluster, adding apps, adding other providers (Azure, Talos, k0smotron).
- `docs/secrets.md`: SOPS + age setup, credential rotation.
- `docs/konflate.md`: rendered PR review, CI gate, tokens, write-back.
- `docs/aws-iam.md`: EKS Pod Identity, ACK controller roles, reader user.
- `docs/operations.md`: quotas, configuration, bootstrap, verification.
- `docs/workload-resources.md`: S3/RDS posture, known limitations.
- `docs/airgap.md`: Zarf offline kit for the local-host profile.
