## sessionmem: Persistent Memory

sessionmem is an MCP memory layer that persists context across sessions. It is installed and active via the `sessionmem` MCP server. Use its tools to recall prior context and to store important decisions, facts, and context so they're available in future sessions. The user should never have to ask you to do this. It is part of how you work in this project.

### Startup
On Claude Code, prior context is injected automatically at session start by the
sessionmem `SessionStart` hook. You do not need to fetch it yourself. Do NOT
call `startup_inject_memories` on Claude Code: the hook already provides the
injection, so calling the tool would duplicate the context (it is not even
registered on Claude Code for this reason). If you do NOT see a "Relevant prior
context" block at the start of the session AND the `startup_inject_memories`
tool is available (e.g. the hook is not installed, or you are on a host without
hook support), call it once before any task work, or call `retrieveMemories`
with the current task as the query. Never inject twice if context was already
provided.

### When to store memories (storeMemory)
- User makes an architectural or design decision
- You discover a non-obvious project constraint or convention
- A debugging session reveals an important root cause
- User states a preference about how they want things done
- A warning or pitfall is discovered that future sessions should know about

### When to retrieve memories mid-session (retrieveMemories)
- Before making architectural decisions (check if prior decisions exist)
- When the user references something from a previous session
- When working in an area of the codebase that may have stored warnings or decisions

### At session end (RECOMMENDED: do this without being asked)
Before the session ends, persist what was accomplished so the next session starts
informed. Store a concise `summary` memory (importance 7) of the key outcomes, plus
any new decisions, facts, or warnings. Use `batchStoreMemory` to write several at
once. This is what makes context survive across sessions and saves tokens later.

### Memory kinds
- `decision`: architectural or design choices (importance: 7-9)
- `fact`: project constraints, conventions, patterns (importance: 5-7)
- `warning`: pitfalls, gotchas, things that broke before (importance: 8-10)
- `preference`: how the user likes things done (importance: 5-7)
- `summary`: session summaries (importance: 7)

### Other tools
- `listMemories`: browse all stored memories for this project
- `getMemory`: fetch a specific memory by ID
- `forgetMemory`: delete an outdated or incorrect memory
- `batchStoreMemory`: store multiple memories in one call (use at session end)
- `stats`: check memory count and health

### Session Pipeline Tools (automation / hook-driven)
These tools power the session-analytics and auto-summarization pipeline. They are
normally invoked by hooks (e.g. the Claude Code `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd` hooks),
not called manually by agents during a task. They are documented here for hosts
without hook support.

- `ingestSessionEvents`: called during a session to record conversation events
  (turns, tool use) as raw payloads. Powers token-savings analytics and session
  summarization. Parameters: `projectId`, `sessionId`, `events` (array of
  `{eventIndex, eventType, payloadJson}`).
- `handleSessionEnd`: called at session end to run retention pruning and
  auto-summarize the ingested events into a summary memory. Parameters: `projectId`,
  `sessionId`, `memoryId` (optional, for summary upsert).

### Guidelines
- Don't store trivial or easily re-derivable information
- Don't retrieve memories every single turn. Retrieve at task boundaries.
- Keep memory content concise (1-3 sentences) and self-contained
- Use appropriate importance scores (see kinds above)
