# Moto Implementation Strategy

## What works

- **gen_resource_lifecycle_test.py** generates good test skeletons from botocore shapes
- **gen_moto_impl.py** generates ~80% correct scaffolding but ONLY for response methods — agents often forget backend methods
- Not-found tests pass reliably — the implementations raise correct exceptions
- Three protocol patterns are well-understood: JSON (Glue), rest-json catchall (OpenSearch), rest-json explicit URLs (Connect/EKS)
- Service fixtures (SERVICE_FIXTURES) work well for prerequisite resources
- **Manual test files** work better than auto-generated for non-CRUD ops (standalone describes, deployment/revision lookups)

## Critical agent pitfalls

### Agents write response methods but forget backend methods
The most common failure: agent adds `responses.py` methods that call `self.backend.create_foo()` but never adds `create_foo()` to the backend class in `models.py`. Always verify both files.

### Cognito-IDP has two backend classes
`CognitoIdpBackend` (line ~999) and `RegionAgnosticBackend` (line ~2398). Methods must go on `CognitoIdpBackend`, not `RegionAgnosticBackend`. The `update_user_attributes` method at the end of `RegionAgnosticBackend` is a trap — new methods placed after it land on the wrong class.

### gen_moto_impl.py has many false positives
It reports nouns as "missing" if ANY CRUD op is unimplemented. Many services (EKS, EMR, cognito-idp, emr-serverless, stepfunctions) show false positives because:
- Operations are implemented but with different method names
- Operations are in a parser/provider submodule
- The moto module name differs from the boto3 service name (e.g., `emrserverless` vs `emr-serverless`)

Always verify with `probe_service.py` before implementing.

### Native providers have separate state from Moto
Robotocore has native providers for Lambda, SFN, ECS, etc. that maintain their own in-memory state (e.g., `_state_machines`, `EcsStore`). Operations NOT in the native provider's `_ACTION_MAP` are forwarded to Moto, which has a completely separate state store. If a resource was created by the native provider, Moto can't see it. When implementing new operations, check if the service has a native provider at `src/robotocore/services/{svc}/provider.py` and add the new ops there instead of (or in addition to) Moto.

### Moto lockfile update requires cache clear
After pushing moto changes, `uv lock --upgrade-package moto` may return the cached old commit. Use `uv cache clean moto --force` first, then `uv lock --upgrade-package moto`. Also push to the correct remote branch name (`robotocore/all-fixes:robotocore/all-fixes`).

## Test generator features (implemented)

- **ID capture**: Captures server-generated IDs from create responses and threads them through describe/delete calls
- **Doc-based param aliasing**: When param ends with "Id" but botocore docs mention "name", generates name value (e.g., CloudTrail DashboardId)
- **Integer min values**: Respects botocore `min` constraints on integer shapes
- **Required-only strict assertions**: Only asserts `isinstance` for botocore-required output fields, not optional ones
- **Tagged union shapes**: Generates correct first-member values for union types (e.g., `DataSourceType={"S3GlueDataCatalog": {}}`)
- **Service fixtures**: Creates prerequisite resources (connect instance, org, vault, cluster, domain, user pool)

## Service fixtures available

| Service | Fixture | Creates |
|---------|---------|---------|
| connect | `instance_id` | Connect instance |
| organizations | `org` (autouse) | Organization |
| backup | `vault_name` | Backup vault |
| eks | `cluster_name` | EKS cluster + IAM role |
| opensearch | `domain_name` | OpenSearch domain |
| cognito-idp | `user_pool_id` | User pool |

## Protocol-specific patterns

| Protocol | Params from | Returns | URL changes |
|----------|------------|---------|-------------|
| JSON (Glue, EMR, Cognito) | `self.parameters` | `ActionResult(dict)` / `EmptyResult()` | None |
| rest-json catchall (IoT, OpenSearch) | `self._get_param()` + URL path | `json.dumps(dict)` / `"{}"` | None |
| rest-json explicit (Connect, EKS) | `self._get_param()`, URL path | `ActionResult(dict)` / `json.dumps(dict)` | Add URL entries to urls.py |

## Worktree workflow for parallel implementation

1. Create worktree: `git worktree add ../robotocore-{svc} -b impl/{svc} HEAD`
2. Init submodule: `cd worktree && git submodule update --init vendor/moto`
3. Agent implements in worktree, commits to worktree branch
4. Copy changed files from worktree to main: `cp worktree/vendor/moto/moto/{svc}/* main/vendor/moto/moto/{svc}/`
5. Commit in main vendor/moto, push to fork, update lockfile
6. Clean up: `rm -rf worktree && git worktree prune && git branch -D impl/{svc}`

Key lessons:
- Submodule commits in worktrees can't be cherry-picked (different git databases). Use file copy.
- Push to the correct remote branch: `git push jackdanger robotocore/all-fixes:robotocore/all-fixes`
- Always verify installed moto has the new methods after sync (check with `python3 -c "from moto.{svc}.models import ..."`).

## Moto update flow

1. Edit vendor/moto/moto/{service}/models.py + responses.py
2. Push: `cd vendor/moto && git push jackdanger robotocore/all-fixes:robotocore/all-fixes`
