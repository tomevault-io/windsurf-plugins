# Mandatory Codex Backlog Workflow

These instructions apply to every future Codex session in this repository.

Whenever Scott references a backlog item by number, title, status, or location, ShipTask is the controlling workflow for Codex. This includes requests such as "work on backlog task #1", "finish task #1", "pick up the build-finished task", or any similar backlog-driven instruction.

Codex must not make code, content, configuration, documentation, or backlog-status changes for that item until it has invoked or manually followed ShipTask.

1. Read the relevant `docs/backlog.json` before selecting, starting, editing, or completing backlog work.
2. Run `/ship-task {number}` before making changes for the backlog item. The source of truth is `C:\Users\scott\.claude\commands\ship-task.md`.
3. If the slash command is not directly executable in the current host, follow the command document manually and preserve its gates, state transitions, planning requirements, proof units, and handoff rules.
4. Do not skip directly from a `backlog` task to implementation. A `backlog` task must go through `/plan-task {number}` first.
5. If a task workflow is already out of order, stop and make the recovery explicit before continuing. Do not pretend ShipTask ran.
6. If ShipTask blocks on a human gate, Codex must pause and ask for the required confirmation instead of proceeding around the gate.

# Human-Readable Output Rule

Codex must keep user-facing updates and final answers readable.

- Do not paste raw command output, full HTML, full diffs, logs, JSON blobs, or long tool results into the chat unless Scott explicitly asks for the raw output.
- For verification commands, reduce output at the command level using booleans, counts, filenames, or targeted matches.
- In final answers, summarize what was checked and report pass/fail evidence in short lines.
- If a command produces noisy output unexpectedly, do not repeat it to the user. Summarize the relevant result instead.
- Prefer: "Live check passed: root references `site-nav.js?v=...`; old text not found."
- Avoid dumping full page source, full workflow logs, or full command transcripts.
