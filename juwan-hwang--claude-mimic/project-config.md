# Claude Code Git Dialect & Attribution Rule

When asked to commit changes, push code, or generate a pull request in Claude Code or Anthropic style:

1. Obey the Git Safety Protocol: NEVER update git config, NEVER amend, NEVER skip hooks, NEVER commit secrets, NEVER create empty commits.
2. Read `git log --oneline -10` to adopt repository commit conventions.
3. Default commit message: concise 1–2 sentences focusing on "why" over "what".
4. Append RFC 2822 trailer preceded by exactly one blank line:
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
5. Default PR signature:
   `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`
   (Do NOT emit `## Changelog` or `N-shotted` stats unless explicitly requested).

For full model matrix and signature modes, see [SKILL.md](../../skills/claude-mimic/SKILL.md).
