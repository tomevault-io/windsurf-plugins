# Project: swamp

Deno based CLI for doing AI Native Automation.

## Planning

When planning new features, always use the `ddd` skill to inform the
architecture.

## Skills

Skills live in `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`. When creating or modifying any
skill, **always load the `skill-creator` skill first** — it contains the
authoritative guidelines for structure, frontmatter, and progressive disclosure.

### Skill structure

```
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md              (required — uppercase)
├── references/            (optional — detailed docs loaded on demand)
└── evals/                 (optional — trigger_evals.json)
```

### Rules for skill files

- **SKILL.md must be uppercase** — not `skill.md`.
- **Frontmatter is required** — YAML with `name` and `description` fields only.
  The `description` is the primary trigger mechanism; include what the skill
  does AND specific trigger phrases/contexts.
- **Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines** — split detailed content into
  `references/` files and reference them from SKILL.md.
- **No extraneous files** — no README.md, CHANGELOG.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md,
  or similar auxiliary docs.
- **Format after editing** — run `deno fmt` after modifying any `.md` files in
  `.claude/skills/`. Skill markdown files follow the same formatting rules as
  all other files in this repository.

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` types
- Use named exports, not default exports
- Comprehensive unit test coverage
- All code must pass type checking with `deno check`
- All code must pass `deno lint`
- Format all code with `deno fmt`
- All `.ts` and `.tsx` files must include the AGPLv3 copyright header from
  `FILE-LICENSE-TEMPLATE.md` at the top of the file (as `//` comments). Run
  `deno run license-headers` to add headers to any new files.
- No fire-and-forget promises. Every promise must be awaited or explicitly
  handled — unhandled promises race with `Deno.exit` and silently lose data. For
  outbound network calls, pass an `AbortSignal` with a timeout so the caller
  controls cancellation.

Changes should only touch what's necessary — don't refactor adjacent code that
isn't part of the task. Keep the blast radius small.

## Commands

Use `deno run` to get a complete list of custom tasks.

- `deno run dev`: Run the CLI.
- `deno run test`: Run the test suite.
- `deno check`: Type-check the program.
- `deno lint`: Run lints.
- `deno fmt`: Format the code.

## Source Control & Pull Requests

- Use the `github-pr` skill to create commit messages and pull requests.
- PRs are auto-merged after passing CI and Claude review. To prevent auto-merge,
  add the `hold` label to the PR.
- After completing work (finishing tasks, merging PRs), run `deno run compile`
  to recompile swamp.
- When a PR fixes a GitHub issue filed by an external contributor (not a repo
  collaborator), add them as a co-author to the commit. Check with
  `gh api /repos/systeminit/swamp/collaborators --jq '.[].login'` to determine
  if the issue author is a team member. If they are not, add
  `Co-authored-by: Name <email>` to the commit. Use `gh api /users/<username>`
  to look up their name, and use `<username>@users.noreply.github.com` as the
  email unless a public email is available from the API response.

## Verification

After completing work, run these checks:

1. `deno check` - Type checking
2. `deno lint` - Linting
3. `deno fmt` - Formatting
4. `deno run test` - Tests
5. `deno run compile` - Recompile the binary

## Architecture

- Follows domain driven design principles. Use the `ddd` skill when designing or
  reviewing code.
- Uses Cliffy for the command line
- Uses Ink for interactive terminal UIs (search, TUI dashboard)
- Uses LogTape for logging and non-interactive output (`"log"` mode)
- Uses JSON for structured output (`"json"` mode via `--json`)
- Every command _must_ support both `"log"` and `"json"` output modes
- You can read the files in `design/*.md` to understand elements of the design

IMPORTANT: CLI commands and presentation renderers must import libswamp types
and functions from `src/libswamp/mod.ts` — never from internal module paths like
`src/libswamp/data/get.ts`. Only libswamp-internal code (other generators, tests
in `src/libswamp/`) may import from internal paths.

## Testing

- Unit tests live next to source files: `foo.ts` → `foo_test.ts`
- Integration tests live in `integration/` directory (sibling to `src/`)
- Use `@std/assert` for assertions (`assertEquals`, `assertStringIncludes`,
  `assertThrows`, etc.)
- Use `ink-testing-library` for testing Ink components
- Test private functions indirectly through public APIs
- Name tests as `Deno.test("functionName: describes behavior", ...)` — see
  `src/domain/data/composite_name_test.ts` for a canonical example
- Run all tests with `deno run test`
- Run a single test file: `deno run test src/cli/repo_context_test.ts` (do not
  use `--` before the file path)
- Refactorings that change shared constants, paths, or cross-component contracts
  must include integration tests to verify components still work together

IMPORTANT: CLI command tests require logging initialization and model barrel
imports before they can run. See `src/cli/commands/data_get_test.ts` for the
pattern (`await initializeLogging({})` and
