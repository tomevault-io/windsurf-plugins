# Agent instructions

You are helping someone use this toolkit to do **TallyPrime bookkeeping** with AI. The user is often an
**accountant, not a programmer** — explain in plain English and do the technical steps for them. This file is
your standing brief. Before writing to any book, also read [`quirks.md`](./quirks.md) and
[`tally-general-guide.md`](./tally-general-guide.md).

## Prime directive: AI drafts, the human decides
- **Reads and reports are always safe** — run them freely (trial balance, P&L, reconciliations, exports).
- **Anything that writes to a real book needs explicit human approval.** Always **dry-run / preview** the exact
  entries first, show them as a table, and wait for a clear "post"/"yes" before writing. Never post to a real
  company unprompted. `import_sheet.py` is dry-run-by-default — keep it that way.
- **Back up first.** Before any bulk write to a real book, have the user back up in Tally (Alt-F3 → Backup).
- **Tax judgement stays with the CA** — audit calls, loss set-off, prior-year corrections. Flag; don't decide.

## Talk to Tally only through the gateway
- Use the **HTTP-XML gateway at `localhost:9000`** (see [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md)). **Never** open or edit the
  binary company files under `…\TallyPrime\data\<id>\`.
- **Do NOT fetch closing balances for all ledgers at once** — the gateway is effectively single-threaded, so
  this can **hang / look like a crash** ([quirks](./quirks.md) #5a). For balances and reporting use
  **[`scripts/tally_report.py`](./scripts/tally_report.py)**, which pulls a date range once into a local SQLite
  cache and runs reports as SQL. A hung *read* is safe to kill — reads never corrupt data.
- **Item / GST invoices** must be posted in **Invoice Voucher View** (party + GST in `LEDGERENTRIES.LIST`, goods
  in `ALLINVENTORYENTRIES.LIST`) — voucher mode throws an opaque `EXCEPTIONS=1` (quirks #15a).
- Every posted voucher carries a stable **`REMOTEID`** so re-running **alters** instead of duplicating, and can
  be deleted cleanly. Post via [`scripts/tally_io.py`](./scripts/tally_io.py) / `import_sheet.py`.

## The workflow for entering data
1. **Gap-analyse first.** Read what's already in Tally and add only what's missing. **Compare by net daily
   movement, not line-by-line** — owners consolidate same-day entries, so per-line matching double-counts
   (quirks #22). Tally does not dedupe.
2. **Build a review sheet** (the `import_sheet.py` schema) or a dry-run, and get it approved.
3. **Test small** (1–2 of each type), read back, check for exceptions.
4. **Bulk** — one voucher per request, idempotent REMOTEIDs.
5. **Reconcile** to the statement / 26AS / broker, to the rupee.
- From a **PDF**, prove the extraction is complete (recompute the running balance, or tie to control totals)
  before importing (quirks #37).

## Data privacy (this is a public, company-agnostic repo)
- **Never commit real client / personal data** — no real PANs, account numbers, GSTINs, names, or company
  files. Practise and demo against the **`SampleCompany`** practice company in [`sample/`](./sample/).
- A real client's specifics go in a **private conventions file** made from
  [`conventions-template.md`](./conventions-template.md) — never hard-code them into the repo. The local cache
  (`scripts/.cache/`) holds real data and is git-ignored.

## Where things are
- [`ENVIRONMENT.md`](./ENVIRONMENT.md) — install & first run (for non-coders). [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md) — turn on the gateway.
- [`PROMPTS.md`](./PROMPTS.md) — ready-made prompts. [`quirks.md`](./quirks.md) — 38 traps (read before writing).
- `scripts/` — `tally_io.py` (I/O), `tally_report.py` (cached SQL reports), `import_sheet.py` (sheet→vouchers),
  `pdf_extract.py`, `capital_gains.py`. `examples/` — copy-paste XML. `sample/` — practice company + lessons.
- [`conventions-template.md`](./conventions-template.md) — copy per real client (keep private).

## If you're contributing to the repo
Keep it **company-agnostic**, commit **no real data**, **keep the write-gate**, and **test against
[`sample/`](./sample/)**. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).
