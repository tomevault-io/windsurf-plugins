# AGENTS.md

Project context for AI assistants and human contributors working on this repository.

---

## What this repo is

A structured, model-agnostic FinOps knowledge skill for AI agents. The `cloud-finops/`
folder contains reference files that give any LLM accurate Cloud FinOps expertise -
Codex, GPT, Gemini, or any MCP-compatible agent.

- **SKILL.md** - entry point for Codex and generic agents
- **POWER.md** - entry point for Kiro IDE (same references, different format)
- **references/** - domain-specific content files (billing mechanics, pricing, optimisation patterns)
- **INSTALLATION.md** - 6 setup options including a model-agnostic response contract for non-Codex models

Both entry points route to the same reference files. No content is duplicated.
The response contract in INSTALLATION.md (Option 6) ensures structured, billing-grounded
answers across all models, even when model defaults differ.

## Content update pipeline

The `pipeline/` folder contains a weekly content scanner that detects FinOps-relevant
changes across 29 sources and proposes updates to the reference files. It is gitignored
and not part of the public distribution.

The pipeline is human-in-the-loop: nothing is changed automatically. Every proposed
update goes through review (list, preview diffs, approve/reject) before touching any
reference file. See `pipeline/README.md` for the full workflow.

---

## Model compatibility

The skill files are plain markdown - any LLM can read them. What differs across models
is how well they follow the structure and avoid hallucinating billing rules.

- **Codex** (Code, .ai, API) - reads SKILL.md natively, no extra configuration needed
- **Kiro IDE** - reads POWER.md natively
- **GPT, Gemini, other models** - inject the reference files as context and add the
  response contract from INSTALLATION.md (Option 6) to the system prompt

The response contract ensures consistent output structure (Context, Recommendation,
Metrics, Business impact) and prevents models from inventing pricing figures or
discount mechanics.

## How to add a new reference file

Follow these four steps whenever you add a new domain:

1. **Create the reference file** in `cloud-finops/references/`
   - Name it `finops-{domain}.md` (or `{category}-{domain}.md` for non-FinOps topics like `greenops-cloud-carbon.md`)
   - Follow the structure of an existing reference file as a template
   - Include practical guidance, not abstract theory

2. **Add a routing entry in SKILL.md**
   - Add a row to the "Domain routing" table with the query topic and file path
   - Add a row to the "Reference files" table with the filename, description, and approximate line count

3. **Add a routing entry in POWER.md**
   - Add a row to the "Domain routing" table (same format as SKILL.md)
   - Add relevant keywords to the `keywords` list in the YAML frontmatter

4. **Update README.md**
   - Add a bullet under "What this skill covers"
   - Add the file to the "Directory structure" listing
   - Add usage examples if applicable

---

## Content rules

**Writing style**
- Use straight dashes (`-`), never em dashes
- Use British spelling for public-facing content (optimisation, organisation, behaviour)
- Be direct and practical. Diagnose before prescribing
- Connect cost recommendations to business outcomes

**SKILL.md frontmatter**
- The `description` field must be **under 1024 characters** (Codex.ai upload limit)

<!-- Content truncated to meet Windsurf 6KB limit -->
