## Purpose

This repository contains `Dalamud Browser`, an experimental Dalamud plugin for rendering in-game browser views, aimed first at ACT, cactbot, and other local web tools.

The project is not a generic website browser yet. The current target is passive or low-interaction overlays inside FFXIV.

## Solution Layout

- `DalamudBrowser/`
  Main plugin project. Contains plugin entrypoint, config, workspace logic, windows, and plugin-side render backend.
- `DalamudBrowser.Common/`
  Shared protocol types used by the plugin and the external renderer process.
- `DalamudBrowser.Renderer/`
  External CEF offscreen renderer process. Owns Chromium/CEF and shared D3D11 texture creation.
- `.codex-temp/`
  Scratch/reference area. It currently contains a local clone of `Browsingway` used only as a reference. Do not treat it as part of the product.

## Runtime Architecture

- The plugin itself runs inside Dalamud/FFXIV.
- Browser rendering is out-of-process:
  - `DalamudBrowser.dll` starts `DalamudBrowser.Renderer.exe`
  - the renderer uses `CefSharp.OffScreen`
  - rendered pages are copied into shared `D3D11` textures
  - the plugin opens those textures and displays them through ImGui
- Keyboard input is intentionally not forwarded to the browser surface. This is deliberate to keep FFXIV keybinds with the game.
- View/window editing is handled in `BrowserWorkspace`.
- URL normalization and `file://` handling are centralized in `BrowserUrlUtility`.

## Important Files

- `DalamudBrowser/Plugin.cs`
  Plugin entrypoint and top-level wiring.
- `DalamudBrowser/Services/BrowserWorkspace.cs`
  Collection/view state, layout editing, availability checks, and render requests.
- `DalamudBrowser/Rendering/RemoteCefRenderBackend.cs`
  Plugin-side host for the external renderer process and shared texture consumption.
- `DalamudBrowser.Renderer/Program.cs`
  External renderer process entrypoint.
- `DalamudBrowser.Renderer/CefRuntime.cs`
  CEF initialization and runtime paths.
- `DalamudBrowser.Renderer/SharedTextureRenderHandler.cs`
  Offscreen paint -> D3D11 shared texture path.

## Build And Load

- Root build helper:
  - `build.bat`
  - `build.bat Debug`
  - `build.bat Release`
  - `build.bat All`
- Default build mode in `build.bat` is `Release`.
- Main dev plugin DLL:
  - `D:\git\AI REPOS\DalamudBrowser\DalamudBrowser\bin\x64\Release\DalamudBrowser.dll`
- The plugin must have a sibling renderer directory:
  - `D:\git\AI REPOS\DalamudBrowser\DalamudBrowser\bin\x64\Release\renderer\`

Do not point Dalamud at `DalamudBrowser.Common.dll` or any DLL inside the renderer folder.

## Toolchain And Version Baseline

- This repo is currently a `.NET 10` codebase:
  - `DalamudBrowser.Common` targets `net10.0-windows`
  - `DalamudBrowser.Renderer` targets `net10.0-windows`
- Treat the project as modern .NET only. Do not suggest or introduce `.NET Framework`, `net6.0`, `net7.0`, or `net8.0` changes unless the user explicitly asks for a downgrade or compatibility work.
- The plugin project uses `Dalamud.NET.Sdk/15.0.0`.
- C# language version is `latestmajor` in the shared and renderer projects. Do not intentionally write code around older C# language limitations unless required.
- Runtime/output assumptions are `Windows` + `win-x64`. The renderer packaging and shared texture path are not cross-platform.
- Renderer package/runtime versions currently in use:
  - `CefSharp.Common.NETCore` `143.0.90`
  - `CefSharp.OffScreen.NETCore` `143.0.90`
  - `chromiumembeddedframework.runtime.win-x64` `143.0.9`
- There is currently no root `global.json` pinning a different SDK. If local tooling differs, follow the repo target frameworks and package versions above instead of assuming an older SDK baseline.

## Build Gotchas

- If `Release` build fails with `DalamudBrowser.json` locked, the plugin is usually still loaded in Dalamud. Unload the dev plugin first, then rebuild.
- `Debug` builds are often easier while the plugin is actively loaded.
- The renderer runtime must remain complete next to the plugin build. In practice that means `renderer\` needs files such as:
  - `DalamudBrowser.Renderer.exe`
  - `CefSharp.Core.dll`
  - `CefSharp.dll`
  - `libcef.dll`
  - `locales\...`
- If you touch renderer packaging or output paths, verify both:
  - `DalamudBrowser\bin\x64\Release\DalamudBrowser.dll`
  - `DalamudBrowser\bin\x64\Release\renderer\...`

## Current Product Constraints

- Layout is still stored in pixels, not percentages.
- Browser interactivity is still limited compared with mature overlay browser plugins.
- Keyboard focus must stay game-first unless the user explicitly asks for a different model.
- The current UX is optimized around fixed overlays like ACT/cactbot, not arbitrary full browser workflows.

## Editing Rules For This Repo

- Keep protocol changes in sync across:
  - `DalamudBrowser.Common`
  - `DalamudBrowser`
  - `DalamudBrowser.Renderer`
- When changing renderer startup, check both assembly resolution and CEF resource paths.
- When changing layout editing, prefer keeping behavior in `BrowserWorkspace` rather than spreading it into UI windows.
