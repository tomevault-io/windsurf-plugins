# Agent Instructions for react-native-ease

## Overview

`react-native-ease` is a React Native library that provides declarative, native-powered animations via a single `EaseView` component. It uses Core Animation (iOS) and ObjectAnimator/SpringAnimation (Android) — no JS animation loop, no worklets, no C++ runtime.

**Fabric (new architecture) only.** Does not support the old architecture.

## Project Structure

```
src/                          # TypeScript source (library)
  EaseView.tsx                # React component — flattens props to native
  EaseViewNativeComponent.ts  # Codegen spec — defines native props/events
  types.ts                    # Public TypeScript types
  index.tsx                   # Public exports
  __tests__/                  # Jest tests

ios/
  EaseView.h                  # Native view header (ObjC++)
  EaseView.mm                 # Native view implementation (Core Animation)

android/src/main/java/com/ease/
  EaseView.kt                 # Native view (ObjectAnimator/SpringAnimation)
  EaseViewManager.kt          # ViewManager with @ReactProp setters
  EasePackage.kt              # Package registration

example/                      # Demo app (separate workspace)
  src/App.tsx                 # Main demo screen with animation examples
  src/ComparisonScreen.tsx    # Comparison with Reanimated
  src/components/             # Shared demo components (Section, Button, TabBar)
```

## Architecture

The JS component (`EaseView.tsx`) takes structured props (`animate`, `transition`, etc.) and flattens them into individual native props defined in the codegen spec (`EaseViewNativeComponent.ts`). When those flat props change on the native side, the native view diffs previous vs new values and creates platform-native animations.

**Prop flattening example:**
```
animate={{ opacity: 0.5, scale: 1.2 }}  →  animateOpacity=0.5, animateScale=1.2
transition={{ type: 'spring', damping: 10 }}  →  transitionType="spring", transitionDamping=10
```

**Key design pattern:** All animation logic lives on the native side. The JS layer is purely a prop resolver — no animation state, no timers, no refs.

## Adding a New Animatable Property

1. Add to `AnimateProps` in `src/types.ts`
2. Add `animate<Prop>` and `initialAnimate<Prop>` codegen props in `src/EaseViewNativeComponent.ts`
3. Add default to `IDENTITY` in `src/EaseView.tsx` and pass the flat props to `NativeEaseView`
4. **iOS:** Handle the new property in `updateProps:` — diff old/new, read presentation value, create animation
5. **Android:** Add `pending<Prop>` field, `@ReactProp` setter in `EaseViewManager.kt`, and handle in `applyAnimateValues()`
6. **Recycle:** Reset the new property to its identity value in `prepareForRecycle` (iOS) and `cleanup()` (Android). Fabric recycles views — any property not reset will leak stale values to the next user of the view.
7. Add tests and update README
8. Add an example/demo in the example app (`example/src/App.tsx` or a new screen)

**Important:** When adding or changing props/features, also update:
- `README.md` (props table + usage section)
- `docs/docs/usage.mdx` (usage guide)
- `docs/docs/api-reference.mdx` (API reference table)
- `skills/react-native-ease-refactor/SKILL.md` (supported properties list, transition category keys, decision tree)

## Development Commands

```sh
yarn                          # Install dependencies
yarn test                     # Jest tests (JS layer)
yarn lint                     # ESLint + TypeScript check
yarn format:check             # Prettier + clang-format check
yarn format:write             # Auto-fix formatting
yarn prepare                  # Build JS module (bob build)
yarn example start            # Start Metro for example app
yarn example ios              # Build and run example on iOS
yarn example android          # Build and run example on Android
```

## Pre-commit Checklist

Before committing, always run:

```sh
yarn format:write && yarn lint && yarn test
```

**Important:** Run `yarn format:write` (not `format:check`) first to auto-fix formatting before linting. This avoids redundant Prettier errors in lint output.

Lefthook pre-commit hooks enforce ESLint and TypeScript checks. Fix all failures before committing.

**Formatting tools:**
- **Prettier** for TypeScript/JavaScript files
- **clang-format** for Objective-C++, Kotlin, and C++ files

## Codegen

React Native Codegen generates the native component interface from `src/EaseViewNativeComponent.ts`. The generated spec name is `EaseViewSpec`.

After changing the codegen spec, you need to rebuild the example app for the native side to pick up changes. On iOS, `pod install` in `example/ios/` may also be needed.

## Testing

- Unit tests are in `src/__tests__/` and test JS prop resolution and native prop passing
- Uses `@testing-library/react-native` with a mocked native component
- **No native integration tests** — test native behavior by running the example app on a device/simulator
- Example app has demos for all features; use it to verify changes visually
