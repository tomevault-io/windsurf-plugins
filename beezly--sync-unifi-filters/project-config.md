# Claude AI Assistant Context

This document provides context for AI assistants (like Claude) working on this project.

## Project Overview

**sync_unifi_filters** is a Python CLI tool for managing Unifi Network Controller content filtering rules. It allows users to fetch domain block lists from Unifi controllers and sync domain lists back to the controller.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **UnifiContentFilter class**: Handles all API interactions with the Unifi Controller
   - `login()`: Authenticates with the controller
   - `get_content_filters()`: Retrieves all content filtering rules
   - `find_filter(name)`: Finds a specific filter by name
   - `update_content_filters(filter_name, domains)`: Updates a filter's domain list

2. **File Operations**:
   - `read_filter_file()`: Reads domains from text file, strips comments
   - `write_filter_file()`: Writes domains to text file with header

3. **CLI Interface**: Uses argparse with two subcommands:
   - `fetch`: Retrieve domains from Unifi (stdout by default, optional file output)
   - `sync`: Upload domains from file to Unifi

### Design Principles

- **Unix philosophy**: Does one thing well, outputs to stdout by default
- **Composable**: Designed to work with pipes and standard Unix tools
- **Clean separation**: Status messages to stderr, data to stdout
- **Generic**: Not tied to specific filter names or use cases

## API Details

### Undocumented API Warning

This tool uses **reverse-engineered, undocumented Unifi APIs**:

- Endpoint pattern: `/proxy/network/v2/api/site/{site}/content-filtering`
- Not in official API docs (checked against network-10.1.68.json spec)
- Uses "v2" versioning that doesn't align with documented "v1" APIs
- May break with controller updates

### API Endpoints Used

1. **Login**: `POST /api/auth/login`
   - Standard documented endpoint
   - Returns session cookie

2. **List filters**: `GET /proxy/network/v2/api/site/{site}/content-filtering`
   - Undocumented
   - Returns array of filter objects

3. **Update filter**: `PUT /proxy/network/v2/api/site/{site}/content-filtering/{id}`
   - Undocumented
   - Updates entire filter object with new `block_list`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Type hints for function parameters
- Docstrings for all public methods
- Error handling with try/except for network operations
- Print to stderr for status messages, stdout for data

### Testing Considerations

- Requires live Unifi Controller for integration tests
- SSL verification disabled by default (self-signed certs)
- Authentication state maintained in session object
- No unit tests currently (integration tests only)

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **API version detection**: Check controller version and use appropriate endpoints
2. **Bulk operations**: Support multiple filters in one command
3. **Dry-run mode**: Preview changes before applying
4. **Filter creation**: Support creating new filters (currently requires manual UI creation)
5. **Export/import**: Backup and restore all filters at once
6. **Validation**: Check domain format before uploading
7. **Diff mode**: Show changes before applying sync
8. **Watch mode**: Auto-sync when file changes

### Known Limitations

1. **Cannot create filters**: Must exist in UI first
2. **No error recovery**: Failed updates may leave partial state
3. **No rate limiting**: Could overwhelm controller with large operations
4. **Case-sensitive names**: Filter names must match exactly
5. **No validation**: Accepts any string as domain (controller validates)

## Configuration

Environment variables (see code for defaults):
- `UNIFI_HOST`: Controller URL
- `UNIFI_USERNAME`: Admin username
- `UNIFI_PASSWORD`: Admin password
- `UNIFI_SITE`: Site name (default: "default")

## File Structure

```
sync_unifi_filters/
├── sync_unifi_filters.py  # Main script
├── README.md              # User documentation
├── CLAUDE.md              # This file (AI context)
└── .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
```

## Historical Context

Originally created as `sync_samsung_filters.py` specifically for Samsung TV ad-blocking. Refactored to be generic and work with any Unifi content filter. The refactoring included:

- Removed hardcoded "Samsung Adblock" references
- Added argparse for better CLI interface
- Made fetch output to stdout by default
- Moved all status messages to stderr for clean data output
- Renamed to reflect generic nature

## When Making Changes

### Adding Features

- Maintain Unix philosophy (composable, single-purpose)
- Keep stdout clean (data only)
- Add examples to README
- Consider backward compatibility

### Modifying API Calls

- Remember these are undocumented APIs
- Test thoroughly with actual controller
- Document controller version tested
- Consider version detection for future-proofing

### Error Handling

- Print errors to stderr
- Use appropriate exit codes (0 = success, 1 = error)
- Provide helpful error messages
- Don't expose credentials in error messages

## Testing Strategy

Since this uses undocumented APIs:

1. **Manual testing**: Primary testing method
2. **Version tracking**: Document which controller versions work
3. **Error scenarios**: Test with missing filters, wrong credentials, etc.
