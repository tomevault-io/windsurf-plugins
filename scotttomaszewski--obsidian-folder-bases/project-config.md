# Folder Bases — Claude guide

Obsidian plugin: clicking a folder in the file explorer opens an associated
Obsidian **Base** (`.base` file), analogous to the "Folder Notes" plugin but for
Bases.

## Layout

```
src/main.ts        Plugin entry: click interception, base resolve/open/create, context menu
src/settings.ts    Settings interface, defaults, pure helpers, settings tab
test/              Vitest unit tests + an "obsidian" module mock
manifest.json      Obsidian plugin manifest (id: folder-bases)
esbuild.config.mjs Bundles src/main.ts -> main.js
vitest.config.ts   Test config; aliases "obsidian" to test/obsidian-mock.ts
devbox.json        Toolchain (Node 22) + build/dev/test/run scripts
docs/index.md      Topic-reference index (usage, .base format)
docs/handoffs/     Per-session handoff notes (HANDOFF.md when one exists)
ARCHITECTURE.md    How it works internally (design + data flows)
CHANGELOG.md       Keep a Changelog; new work goes under "Unreleased"
ROADMAP.md         New features + larger planned efforts + backlog
FOLLOWUPS.md       In-scope tangents to clear before the next feature (not ROADMAP)
```

This plugin lives **inside the test vault** at
`folder-bases-demo/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-folder-bases/` (the manifest `id`
is `folder-bases`), so the build output (`main.js`) is loaded directly by
Obsidian — no copy step.

## Build / dev

Uses [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox) for the toolchain. The init hook
runs `npm install` on first entry.

- `devbox run build` — type-check + production bundle to `main.js`
- `devbox run dev` — esbuild watch mode (rebuild on save)
- `devbox run test` — run the Vitest unit tests (`npm run test:watch` for watch mode)
- `devbox run release <version>` — bump version (manifest/package/versions.json),
  build, commit, push, and publish a GitHub release with the assets attached
  (delegates to the `release` recipe in `justfile`; needs a clean tree and an
  authenticated `gh`)
- `devbox run run -- <cmd>` — run an arbitrary command in the env (e.g. `devbox run run -- node -v`)

After building, reload the plugin in Obsidian (toggle off/on in
Settings → Community plugins, or reload the app) to pick up changes.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) +
[SemVer](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` — breaking / feature / fix).

- **When planning or implementing any user-facing change, add an entry under the
  `## Unreleased` section** (categories: Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed).
  Treat this as part of "done," like updating docs and tests. Reference the
  roadmap item number when applicable (e.g. `(#6)`).
- Don't hand-write version headers. `devbox run release <version>` renames
  `## Unreleased` to `## <version>` and reuses that section as the GitHub release
  notes (see the `release` recipe in `justfile`). Pick the version per SemVer:
  bump MINOR for a new feature, PATCH for a fix.

## Where docs live (route by lifespan)

Each fact has one home — put it there, don't duplicate:

- **Internal design / a new data flow** → `ARCHITECTURE.md` (and add the module to
  its component table if you add a file).
- **A new setting** → the settings list in `ARCHITECTURE.md` *and* the user-facing
  description in `docs/usage.md`.
- **A new docs topic file** → add it to the `docs/index.md` table.
- **A new `.base` syntax detail we rely on** → `docs/bases-format.md`.
- **A user-facing change** → a `## Unreleased` entry in `CHANGELOG.md` (see above).
- **A new feature or larger planned effort** → `ROADMAP.md` (numbered list or the
  Backlog section).
- **A small in-scope tangent found mid-task** (worth fixing, but would derail what
  you're doing) → a `FOLLOWUPS.md` entry. Clear these before starting a new feature.
  This is *not* the same as ROADMAP: follow-ups are near-term cleanups off the
  current task; the roadmap is for new/larger efforts. Don't merge the two.
- **Session state (what's half-done, resume steps)** → `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF.md`
  via the handoff skill — never durable docs.
- **A new `obsidian` symbol used by tested code** → add it to `test/obsidian-mock.ts`.

Treat updating the relevant doc as part of "done," like tests.

## Key facts

- **No custom view is registered.** The core Bases plugin owns the `.base`
  extension; we just `workspace.getLeaf().openFile(tFile)` and Obsidian renders it.
- **Click interception** is a capture-phase `click` listener on `document`
  (`registerDomEvent(..., { capture: true })`) so it runs before the explorer's
  own collapse/expand handler. Folder titles are `.nav-folder-title` elements
  carrying a `data-path` attribute. We only `preventDefault()` when we actually
  open/create a base.
- **Base path** = folder path + rendered `baseNameTemplate` (default
  `{{folder_name}}.base`). See `basePathForFolder` in `src/main.ts`.

## Testing

- **Unit tests** (`test/settings.test.ts`, run with `devbox run test`) cover the
  pure logic in `src/settings.ts`: `renderTemplate`, `templateFilePath`,
  `basePathFor`, `globToRegExp`, `parsePatterns`, `folderMatchesPatterns`,
  `paneArgForOpenLocation`, and `isFolderEnabled`. Keep these functions pure and
  exported so they stay testable without the Obsidian runtime.
