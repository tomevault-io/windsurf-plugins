# Project Conventions: Image Organization

This document outlines the organization of product images in this project for the Gemini assistant to reference.

## Image Formats

- **JPEG (.jpg):** The primary format for content images in the `categories`, `featured`, and `patterns` directories.
- **WebP (.webp):** A modern, efficient image format provided as an alternative to JPEG for all content images.
- **PNG (.png):** Used exclusively for logo images, which supports transparency.

## Image Dimensions and Aspect Ratios

The images are consistently organized by aspect ratio and size, depending on their purpose:

- **`images-optimized/patterns/`**
  - **Aspect Ratio:** 3:4 (portrait)
  - **Sizes:** All images are available in two widths: 320px and 640px.

- **`images-optimized/categories/`**
  - **Aspect Ratio:** 3:4 (portrait)
  - **Sizes:** All images are available in two widths: 400px and 800px.

- **`images-optimized/featured/`**
  - **Aspect Ratio:** Primary 3:4 (portrait), with exceptions (e.g., `about-portrait` is 1:1).
  - **Sizes:** All images are available in two widths: 350px and 700px.

- **`images-optimized/logo/`**
  - **Aspect Ratio:** 5:6 (standard for logo), 1:1 (favicons).
  - **Sizes:** Logos available in multiple widths: 60px, 120px, 240px, and 300px. Favicons in 16, 32, and 180px square.
