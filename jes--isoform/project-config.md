# Isoform

Hi, Cursor! Thanks so much for helping with this project. You've done a lot of great
work already and it wouldn't have been possible without you. This document is intended
to clarify some context about the work that might not be obvious to you.

We're working on Isoform. It is an SDF-based CAD program. It runs in the browser. It has no external dependencies
and is designed to be able to be used by downloading it locally and opening `index.html`.

That means:

 * don't introduce new dependencies unless you have to
 * especially don't load anything from a CDN etc.
 * if you do introduce new dependencies they have to be some js file we can download and commit to the repo
 * you can't use ES modules, we have to use <script> tags in index.html and export classes into `window`

Export classes like so:

    class MyClass {
        // ...
    }

    // Detect environment and export accordingly
    (function() {
    const nodes = { MyClass };
    
    // Check if we're in a module environment
    if (typeof exports !== 'undefined') {
        // Node.js or ES modules environment
        if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {
        // CommonJS (Node.js)
        Object.assign(module.exports, nodes);
        } else {
        // ES modules
        Object.keys(nodes).forEach(key => {
            exports[key] = nodes[key];
        });
        }
    } else if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
        // Browser environment with script tags
        Object.keys(nodes).forEach(key => {
        window[key] = nodes[key];
        });
    }
    })();

## File structure

JavaScript code is under the `js/` directory. When you refer to JavaScript filenames,
please use the relative path from the root of the project (e.g. `js/ui.js` or `js/nodes/treenode.js`) so that the
editor knows which file to apply the changes to.

## SDFs

The document is edited as a tree of nodes. Node types are:

 * Primitives (Box, Sphere, Cylinder, etc.): they do not have child nodes, set `this.maxChildren = 0`
 * Combinators (Union, Intersection, Difference): they combine 2 or more nodes, set `this.maxChildren = 2` to limit to 2, or `null` for unlimited
 * Modifiers (Translate, Rotate, Scale): they modify a single child node, set `this.maxChildren = 1`

## Rendering

We compile the SDFs to GLSL, rendered with ray marching.

The rendering process now uses Peptide, which is an arithmetic abstraction for defining SDFs. Each node implements a `makePeptide(p)` method (which is called by the `peptide(p)` method in the TreeNode base class) that returns a Peptide expression representing the SDF for that node.

The Peptide expressions are then compiled to GLSL or JavaScript code using the PeptideSSA class, which handles the compilation process. This is done in the `rebuildShaders` method in `js/main.js`.

For example, in a node's `makePeptide` method, you would build a Peptide expression like:

    makePeptide(p) {
        // p is a Peptide expression representing the position
        const radius = P.const(this.radius);
        return P.sub(P.vlength(p), radius);
    }

Peptide handles the compilation to GLSL, so you don't need to worry about writing GLSL code directly.

## Secondary node

When the user is editing a node, the "secondary node" is that node. We render it in red
on top of the main scene, with reduced opacity, so that the user can see what they're working
on.

To make secondary node rendering work, you basically only have to set `this.applyToSecondary`
correctly. If set to "true", then that node will apply to the secondary node (you want things
for things like translation and rotation so that the user sees the node they're editing in
its correct location). For most nodes just don't set it, because you don't want to apply
your transformations to the secondary node. When the user is editing your node it will automatically be applied even if `applyToSecondary` is false.

## Orthographic Projection

When you're working in `fragment.js` please bear in mind that as a CAD application
we are using **orthographic projection**. Please do not rewrite it to use perspective
projection, that is not what we want.

## Units

The intended units are millimetres.

## UI Structure

The application has a tree view for node hierarchy and a property editor for node properties. The UI panel can be resized, and there are display options for showing edges and adjusting the step factor for ray marching.

## Vectors, matrices

We have a `Vec3` and a `Mat3` class in `peptide/js/vec3.js` and `peptide/js/mat3.js`. Please use these for vector and matrix operations.
If you don't know what functions exist, just guess, and we'll implement them later if they're missing.

The general form is that you combine them like:

    const v = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
    const v2 = v.add(new Vec3(4, 5, 6));
    const m = new Mat3(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
    const u = m.mulVec3(v);

So each operation returns a new vector/matrix instead of modifying the existing one.

Convert them to GLSL shader code like so:

    vec3 v = ${v.glsl()};
    mat3 m = ${m.glsl()};

## Peptide

Peptide is an arithmetic abstraction that we will be using to define the SDFs. It will
