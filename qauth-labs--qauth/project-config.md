# QAuth - Language Rules

## Language

- **Default Language**: English
  - All code (variables, functions, classes, comments) must be in English
  - All documentation (README, inline comments, JSDoc) must be in English
  - All commit messages must be in English
  - All issues, PRs, and discussions must be in English
  - Exception: User-facing content can be localized (i18n)

## Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use strict mode, prefer type safety over `any`
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - PascalCase for classes, interfaces, and types
  - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
  - kebab-case for file names
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments in English for complex logic
- **Documentation**: Use JSDoc/TSDoc for public APIs

## Architecture

- **Federation First**: QAuth is a federated identity hub — upstream identity sources (passwords, VC wallets, OIDC providers) plug in through the `CredentialProvider` interface; downstream apps see only standard OAuth 2.1 / OIDC tokens
- **Modular First**: Phase 1 is a modular monolith; libs are designed for microservice extraction (Phase 3+)
- **API First**: Design APIs before implementation
- **Security First**: Always consider security implications (OAuth 2.1, PKCE mandatory, Argon2id, timing-safe)
- **Performance**: Consider performance, but don't over-optimize prematurely

## Git Commit Messages

Follow Conventional Commits:

- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor:` code restructuring
- `perf:` performance improvements
- `test:` adding tests
- `chore:` maintenance tasks

Example: `feat(auth): implement OAuth 2.1 authorization code flow`

## Dependencies

- Prefer well-maintained, popular libraries
- Check security advisories before adding dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Document why a dependency is needed

## Testing

- Write tests for business logic
- Write tests for public APIs
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not just high percentage

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs small and focused
- Write clear PR descriptions in English
- Link related issues
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review
