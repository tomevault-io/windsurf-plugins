# Coding Style (TypeScript/React)

- **Naming**: Use descriptive names; avoid abbreviations; functions are verbs; variables are nouns
- **Types**: Annotate exported/public APIs; avoid `any` and unsafe casts
- **Control Flow**: Prefer guard clauses and shallow nesting; avoid unnecessary try/catch and swallow-only handlers
- **Comments**: Only for non-obvious rationale, invariants, or caveats; keep concise; **always write comments in English**
- **Formatting**: Match existing style; wrap long lines; do not reformat unrelated code
- **Imports**: Keep paths aligned with existing alias usage (e.g., `@/utils/...`)
- **UI**: Prefer composition over prop drilling; colocate small helpers near usage
