# Agent guide

## Product direction

QueryPad is **Cursor for Data** - a local-first, terminal-first AI CLI that
understands datasets (discovers relationships, builds semantic models) before
generating SQL.
The web app was retired (tag `web-final`); the surfaces are the CLI and the MCP server.
The planned flagship surface is a native macOS desktop app (Swift + libghostty) that runs Claude Code / Codex against the MCP server - the CLI and MCP stay first-class as its foundation, and the web only ever returns as an intro/landing page after the rename.
See `ROADMAP.md` for the layered plan.

## Layout: core / engine / adapters

- `src/core/` - pure logic with **zero npm dependencies** (discovery, agent loop, sql utils, formatters, types).
  Keep it that way: no Node built-ins beyond types, no fetch, no fs.
- `src/engine/` - `QueryRunner` implementations. `engine/duckdb` binds native `@duckdb/node-api` for files; `engine/attach` attaches external Postgres/MySQL/SQLite read-only and exposes their tables as pushdown views.
  Anything that reaches an external database must stay `READ_ONLY` and must never let a credential into a log line or an artifact (`redactConnectionString`).
- `src/ai/` - provider-agnostic LLM completion (Anthropic / OpenAI, BYOK). Credentials come from env via `adapters/cli/ai-env.ts`.
- `src/embed/` - embedding interface; `@huggingface/transformers` is an **optionalDependency**, loaded only via dynamic import.
- `src/adapters/` - thin, replaceable surfaces: `adapters/cli` and `adapters/mcp` (stdio MCP server).
  Surfaces depend on core/engine, never the reverse.
  `adapters/cli/source.ts` resolves a folder or a `--db` connection into one `Source`, so commands never branch on where the tables came from.
  `core/agent/toolkit.ts` is the **single** definition of the read-only agent tools; the `ask` loop and the MCP server both consume it. Add a tool there, not in a surface.
  `core/agent/loop.ts` runs a self-critique **verification pass** before finalizing (projection/ranking/safety); it is on by default for `ask` (`--no-verify` off) and lives in our loop, not the toolkit, so MCP clients drive their own. `eval:agent --no-verify` measures the pre-verification baseline - keep it as the control when tuning the checklist.
  The MCP SDK is a devDependency on purpose - tsup bundles it (`noExternal`) so the shipped CLI carries none of its HTTP-transport deps. Keep `dependencies` at one entry.

The tsconfig has `lib: ["ES2022"]` with **no DOM** on purpose - browser APIs in
core/engine are a type error, not a code-review catch.

## Artifacts contract

- `inspect` writes `.datactx/` (schema.json, relationships.json,
  semantic-model.yaml/.json, inspect-summary.md; optionally term-embeddings.json).
- There are **two curation layers**, both inputs that every surface must honor and re-runs must preserve:
  - `.datactx/verdicts.json` - which joins are real (reject/override inferred joins).
  - `.datactx/glossary.json` - what things mean (descriptions + synonyms from `enrich`).
    `prepareDataset` re-applies it over the freshly derived model, the same way verdicts are
    re-applied over freshly inferred relationships. A glossary entry may name a column that
    became a **measure** rather than a dimension (numeric columns always do), and measure/dimension
    synonyms are indexed by `buildTermCatalog` - that chain is the only route from a business word
    like "revenue" to an opaque column like `amt_c`, so do not break a link in it.

## Evals

- `evals/dataset/` is a committed trap dataset; `evals/cases/*.json` are the graded cases.
  Both are inputs - never regenerate them to make a run pass.
- `npm run eval:engine` is deterministic and gates CI. `npm run eval:agent` costs tokens and is manual.
- A failing case is either a real defect or a wrong case. **Do not tune the engine to turn a case green** -
  fix the defect or fix the case, and say which.
- Agent grading is value-based (`src/evals/grade.ts`): column names and row order are ignored unless
  the case sets `orderSensitive`. Add behavioral expectations (`mustUseTool`, `maxSteps`) when the
  *route* to the answer matters, not just the number.
- Tool **subsetting** belongs in `createDataToolkit` (`only`), not in a surface - same rule as adding
  a tool. A surface that built its own tool list would be a second place that knows tool names.

### The grounding A/B (`eval agent --ab`, `src/evals/arms.ts`)

`grounded` vs `raw-sql` measures the product's central claim, so its integrity rules are strict:

- **`grounded` is the zero-override arm** - no `tools`, no `systemPrompt`, so it runs the shipped
  path. A test asserts it is identical to a plain `runAgentSuite()`; keep it that way or "we measured
  what ships" stops being true.
- **The control's prompt is a mechanical translation of `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`.** Licensed edits: name
  the read-only statements it inspects with (it has no `describe_table`), and drop the "ground your
  SQL in the relationships below" line. No dataset knowledge, no added strategy hints, and keep
  "All tools are read-only" - that is mechanics parity, and dropping it would break the safety case
  for a reason unrelated to the hypothesis.
