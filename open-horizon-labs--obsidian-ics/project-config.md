# Branch Management Rule
When working on an issue and currently on the master branch, always create a new feature branch first.

Use the format: `git checkout -b issue-{issue-number}` or `git checkout -b feature-{description}`

Since we use github, also publish the branch to `origin` (github)

This helps maintain a clean master branch and enables proper pull request workflows.
