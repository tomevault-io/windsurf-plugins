# Documentation Naming Convention

## Rule
All documentation files must follow these conventions:

### File Naming
- Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for all documentation file names
- Example: `SECURITY_GUIDE.md`, `API_VERSIONING_GUIDE.md`, `ERROR_CORRELATION.md`

### Location
- All documentation files must be placed in the `docs/` folder
- Website copies should be synced to `web/public/docs/`

### Examples

**Correct:**
```
docs/GETTING_STARTED.md
docs/API_REFERENCE.md
docs/SECURITY_GUIDE.md
docs/ERROR_CORRELATION_GUIDE.md
docs/REQUEST_EXTRACTORS.md
```

**Incorrect:**
```
docs/getting-started.md          # lowercase with hyphens
docs/apiReference.md             # camelCase
docs/security_guide.md           # lowercase
README.md                        # should be in docs/ if it's documentation
src/docs/guide.md               # wrong location
```

### Exceptions
- `README.md` at project root is acceptable
- `CHANGELOG.md` at project root is acceptable
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` at project root is acceptable
- `LICENSE` at project root is acceptable

### When Creating Documentation
1. Name the file in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE with `.md` extension
2. Place it in the `docs/` directory
3. If needed for the website, also copy to `web/public/docs/`
