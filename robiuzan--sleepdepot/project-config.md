# sleepdepot (sleepdepot.co.il) — project instructions

WooCommerce + ACF Pro store on LocalWP. This file is the source of truth for **this** site.
WP/Woo/ACF engineering rules for this project live locally (no global config) — imported here:

@.claude/wordpress-base.md

## Identity
- **Store**: sleepdepot.co.il (Israeli ecommerce store — mattresses/sleep products)
- **LocalWP site name**: `sleepdepot` · **Local domain**: https://sleepdepot.local · **Live**: https://sleepdepot.co.il
- **WordPress**: 7.0 · table prefix `wp_`
- **Locale**: Hebrew/Israel → **RTL** and i18n matter (see `/sleepdepot-hebrew-rtl`, `/i18n-l10n`, `/responsive-design`). Confirm the WP locale is `he_IL`.
- Prefix for new custom code: `sleepdepot_` · Text domain: `sleepdepot`

## ⚠ IMPORTANT — code location vs. working dir
- This Claude project dir is `C:\Users\robiu\antigravity\Projects\sleepdepot.co.il` (holds `.claude/` + this file). It is the env that is version-controlled in GitHub (`robiuzan/sleepdepot`).
- **The actual WordPress install is elsewhere** (LocalWP default location):
  `C:\Users\robiu\Local Sites\sleepdepot\app\public`
- Always edit theme/plugin files at that **absolute path** (it's wired as an additional working dir in `.claude/settings.json`). Consider opening `C:\Users\robiu\Local Sites\sleepdepot` as the workspace.

## Theme Architecture: **Classic**
- **Active theme: `sleepdepot`** — a standalone **HTML5 Blank**–based theme (classic PHP templates + hooks, not FSE → `/theme-json-architect` does **not** apply). **No parent/child** relationship; it is self-contained.
- Theme path: `...\app\public\wp-content\themes\sleepdepot\`
- Modular layout: `functions.php` only bootstraps; real logic lives under `settings/` (`acf/`, `enqueue_scripts.php`, `enqueue_styles.php`, `general.php`, `additional/`, `functions/`). Front-end page content is **ACF/DB-driven** via a page-builder (`templates/page-builder.php` + `parts/sections/section-*.php`). Full map in `/sleepdepot-theme`.
- WooCommerce overrides → `sleepdepot\woocommerce\...` (never edit the Woo plugin). Prefer `woocommerce_*` hooks/filters over template edits.
- Other themes present (`genesis-block-theme`, `twentytwenty*`) are **inactive** — editing them has no front-end effect.

## Stack / key plugins (installed)
- **Commerce**: WooCommerce + Product Bundles, Side Cart, Woo Discount Rules (+ Pro), **WebToffee Smart Coupons Pro** (`wt-smart-coupon-pro`), Advanced Free Shipping, WPC variation bulk editor, order + customer import/export. See `/sleepdepot-promotions`.
- **Payments (Israel)**: **iCredit** (`woocommerce-icredit 4.0.4` — note the space in the folder name) + PayPal Payments (secondary). Treat orders via Woo CRUD/HPOS API. See `/sleepdepot-icredit`. (No Rivhit/invoicing plugin here.)
- **Fields**: **ACF Pro** — local JSON sync is **already wired** to `themes/sleepdepot/settings/acf/acf-json/`. See `/wp-acf`.
- **Forms**: none active. Contact Form 7 is scaffolded in the theme but its include is commented out and the plugin isn't installed.
- **SEO**: Rank Math (`seo-by-rank-math`) — owns titles/meta/schema/sitemaps; don't duplicate. See `/seo-technical`, `/seo-onpage-schema`.
- **Performance/optim**: **Autoptimize** (cache/minify — no WP Rocket), `webp`/media via Enable Media Replace. See `/wp-performance`, `/core-web-vitals`, `/images-media`.
- **Blocks/UI**: Genesis Blocks + a theme-local Gutenberg `cta-block`; Popup Maker; SVG Support; Creame WhatsApp-me.
- **Security**: Wordfence, WPS Hide Login, Force Strong Passwords. See `/security-hardening`.
- **Headers/scripts**: Insert Headers and Footers (where GTM/analytics snippets would live). See `/analytics-tracking`.
- **Migration/backup**: All-in-One WP Migration (+ Pro), UpdraftPlus, BlogVault/Cloudways automated migration, WPE site migration. See `/sleepdepot-deploy`.
- **Other**: Jetpack, Akismet, WP File Manager.
- ⚠ **Mixed host origin**: mu-plugins from **Hostinger**, **WP Engine**, and **ManageWP/BlogVault** are all present — this site has been migrated more than once. Confirm the current live host before any deploy (see `/sleepdepot-deploy`).

## ⚠ Security note (theme ACF config)
`themes/sleepdepot/settings/acf/acf-config.php` enables `acf/shortcode/allow_unsafe_html` + `acf/the_field/allow_unsafe_html` and runs `do_shortcode()` over ACF values. **ACF output is not auto-escaped here** — escape on output in templates yourself, and restrict who can embed shortcodes. Worth a `security-auditor` pass. See `/security-hardening`, `/wp-standards`.

## Tooling
- **wp-cli**: open the **LocalWP site shell** for `sleepdepot` (so `wp` targets this DB). wp-cli is NOT on the system PATH — only inside that shell.
- **Debug logging**: ✅ enabled in `wp-config.php` (2026-06-10) — `WP_DEBUG`/`WP_DEBUG_LOG`/`SCRIPT_DEBUG` on, `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` off + `display_errors=0`. Errors log to `wp-content/debug.log` (created lazily on first notice). See `/wp-debug`.
- **Pulse** after PHP edits (reads the real site's debug.log):
  `powershell -NoProfile -File C:\Users\robiu\antigravity\Projects\sleepdepot.co.il\.claude\hooks\tail-wp-logs.ps1 -SitePath "C:\Users\robiu\Local Sites\sleepdepot"`
