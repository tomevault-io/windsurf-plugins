## Last Session
**Checkpoint written:** 2026-05-27T10:54:03.000642-05:00
**Task:** Update Perseus and generate memory checkpoints
**Status:** completed
**Next:** Decide whether to keep the regenerated perseus.py artifact diff and separately handle existing benchmark/gauntlet worktree changes.
**Workspace:** /Users/tconnally/Documents/perseus
**Notes:** Fast-forwarded main to origin/main c4b26d1. Smoke check reports perseus v1.0.6. Full suite passed outside sandbox: 1,032 passed in 69.14s. Sandbox-only pytest run failed on localhost socket binds. Regenerated perseus.py from src; artifact now removes stale generated prefetch/Mneme index snippets absent from source. Pre-existing benchmark and gauntlet changes were not touched.
