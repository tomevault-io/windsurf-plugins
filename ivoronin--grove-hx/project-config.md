# Architecture and domain

Read [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) before using or changing domain language. It owns canonical terms. Do not redefine them here.

Read [docs/features](docs/features/) before changing user-visible behavior. It owns Grove's executable behavior contract. Update the scenarios when behavior changes, then run `make test` to check the contract.

Read the relevant [architecture decision](docs/adr/) before changing a decision recorded there. Code owns its current layout and dependency graph. Runtime-workaround records own their evidence, containment, and `Revisit when` gates.
