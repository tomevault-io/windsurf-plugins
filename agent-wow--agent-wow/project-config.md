# Instructions for AI coding agents

- Do not edit README.md or any docs unless explicitly instructed.
- The environment may have a running Azerothcore server (authserver and worldserver) that can be used for end to end testing.
    - You are only allowed to interact with it via the public APIs (just like any client server model).
    - Do not change any of its internals (e.g. server configurations, database schemas or records, source code, etc).
    - You may refer to the source at https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk to guide implementation of this client.
