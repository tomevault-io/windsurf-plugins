# Project Rules

- This is a Rust CLI + library project (workspace with chub-core and chub-cli crates)
- Run `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings` before committing
- All business logic goes in chub-core; CLI/output/MCP concerns go in chub-cli
- Maintain byte-for-byte format compatibility with the original JS Context Hub
- Use serde(rename) attributes to keep camelCase JSON field names
- Tests are inline #[cfg(test)] blocks, not separate test files (except integration tests)
- Do not add Co-Authored-By trailers to commits

## Pinned Documentation
Use `chub get <id>` to fetch these docs when working with these libraries:
- serde/derive (rust) — Core serialization framework — used everywhere for JSON/YAML
- clap/derive (rust) — CLI argument parsing with derive macros
- tokio/runtime (rust) — Async runtime for MCP server and HTTP serving
- axum/routing (rust) — HTTP framework for chub serve

## Project Context
Use `chub get project/<name>` or ask Chub for these:
- project/architecture — Crate layout, data flow, and key design decisions
- project/conventions — Rust coding standards and patterns used in this project
- project/team-features — How team features work and how to extend them

## Module: cli (crates/chub-cli/**)
- Each command in its own file under src/commands/
- Use owo-colors for terminal output, support --json flag on all commands
- MCP tools use schemars::JsonSchema for parameter schema generation

## Module: core (crates/chub-core/**)
- No CLI concerns (no stdout/stderr, no clap, no owo-colors)
- All public functions return Result<T> using crate::error::Error
- Search pipeline: tokenizer -> BM25 -> inverted index -> lexical boost

## Module: team (crates/chub-core/src/team/**)
- Team features live in .chub/ directory (git-tracked)
- Three-tier config: ~/.chub/ -> .chub/ -> .chub/profiles/
- All team modules must work gracefully when .chub/ doesn't exist
