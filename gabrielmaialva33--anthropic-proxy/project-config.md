# Gemini Code Assistant

This document provides an overview of the `anthropic-proxy` project, its architecture, and development conventions to be
used as a context for Gemini.

## Project Overview

`anthropic-proxy` is a Python-based proxy server that acts as a bridge between the Anthropic and OpenAI API ecosystems.
It allows developers to use Anthropic's client-side tools and libraries (like Claude Code) with OpenAI's powerful
language models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini).

The core functionality of the proxy is to:

1. **Receive** API requests in Anthropic's format.
2. **Translate** these requests into the corresponding OpenAI API format.
3. **Forward** the translated requests to the OpenAI API.
4. **Receive** the response from OpenAI.
5. **Convert** the OpenAI response back into Anthropic's format.
6. **Return** the final response to the client.

This process is designed to be seamless and transparent, handling various complexities such as streaming responses, tool
calls, system prompts, and multi-turn conversations.

### Key Technologies

* **Python 3.10+**: The core programming language.
* **FastAPI**: A modern, high-performance web framework for building the API.
* **LiteLLM**: A library that provides a unified interface for interacting with various LLM APIs, handling the core
  translation logic.
* **Pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management, ensuring that API requests and responses adhere to the
  expected schemas.
* **Uvicorn**: An ASGI server that runs the FastAPI application.
* **python-dotenv**: Manages environment variables for configuration.

### Architecture

The project follows a standard Python application structure:

* `main.py`: The main entry point for starting the server.
* `src/app/`: Contains the core application logic.
    * `main.py`: FastAPI application setup, middleware, and exception handlers.
    * `api/routes.py`: Defines the API endpoints, including `/v1/messages` for handling chat completions.
    * `core/config.py`: Manages application configuration and environment variables.
    * `models/schema.py`: Pydantic models that define the data structures for API requests and responses.
    * `services/converter.py`: The heart of the proxy, containing the logic for converting data between Anthropic and
      LiteLLM/OpenAI formats.
    * `utils/`: Utility modules for logging, error handling, and other helper functions.
* `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests for the application.
    * `test_api.py`: Integration tests that send requests to the running proxy and compare its output to the native
      Anthropic API.
    * `test_converter.py`: Unit tests for the conversion logic in `converter.py`.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for the project.
* `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata and build configuration.
* `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`: For containerizing the application.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* `uv` or `pip` for package management
* An OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gabrielmaialva33/anthropic-proxy.git
   cd anthropic-proxy
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   # With uv (recommended)
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Or with pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   BIG_MODEL=gpt-4o
   SMALL_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   ```

### Running the Server

You can run the server in two ways:

1. **Using the main script (recommended for development):**
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
   This will start the server on `http://0.0.0.0:8082`.

2. **Using Uvicorn directly:**
   ```sh
   uvicorn src.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8082
   ```

### Running Tests

The project has a suite of tests to ensure that the proxy is functioning correctly.

* **Run all API tests:**
  ```sh
  python -m tests.test_api
  ```

* **Run converter unit tests:**
  ```sh
  python -m tests.test_converter
  ```

## Development Conventions

### Coding Style

* The project follows the **PEP 8** style guide for Python code.
* **Type hints** are used throughout the codebase to improve readability and allow for static analysis.
* Code is organized into logical modules with clear responsibilities.

### Testing

* The `tests` directory contains both integration tests (`test_api.py`) and unit tests (`test_converter.py`).
* `test_api.py` is particularly important as it performs end-to-end tests by sending requests to both the proxy and the
  official Anthropic API and comparing the results. This ensures that the proxy's output is consistent with the native
  API.
* When adding new features or fixing bugs, it is expected that corresponding tests will be added or updated to maintain
  coverage and prevent regressions.

### Dependency Management

* Project dependencies are managed in `requirements.txt`.
* `uv` is the recommended tool for installing and managing dependencies due to its speed.

### Commits and Versioning

* Commit messages should be clear and descriptive, explaining the "what" and "why" of the changes.
