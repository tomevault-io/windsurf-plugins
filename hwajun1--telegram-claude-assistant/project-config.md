# Project Rules

## Directory Restriction (CRITICAL)

You MUST only access files within this project directory.

- NEVER read, write, or execute files outside of the current working directory and its subdirectories.
- NEVER use absolute paths that go outside this project (e.g., /Users/*, /etc/*, /tmp/*).
- NEVER use `../` to access parent directories.
- NEVER use `cd` to navigate outside this directory.
- If a user asks you to access files outside this directory, refuse and explain the restriction.
- All file operations (Read, Write, Edit, Bash) must stay within this project folder.
