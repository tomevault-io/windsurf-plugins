# TQDB

Parser that turns Titan Quest Anniversary Edition game data (ARZ database, ARC archives, TEX textures) into one JSON file per locale plus a sprite sheet. The React site at [tq-db.net](https://tq-db.net) consumes that output verbatim.

This file holds only what is specific to this project and true right now.

## Documentation Map

- `docs/architecture.md` — how the Python pipeline works, end to end, and the game-data defects it works around
- `docs/game-formats.md` — DBR, TPL, ARZ, ARC, TEX formats and the localized text resources
- `docs/data-contract.md` — the JSON and sprite output the website depends on
- `docs/setup.md` — host setup, game data, input `data/` layout
- `docs/build-pipeline.md` — container image, version pins, update policy, verification ladder

Bugs and feature requests are tracked as GitHub issues on this repository.

Read `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/data-contract.md` before changing any parser. Read `docs/game-formats.md` before touching extraction.

## Layout

- `justfile`, `compose.yaml`, `Dockerfile` — the dev container; `just` lists the commands
- `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.python-version`, `Cargo.lock`, `uv.lock` — the version pins
- `extract/` — the `tqextract` Rust crate: `arz`, `arc`, `tex` readers and `prepare`, which builds the whole `data/` tree
- `run.py` — Python parser entry point
- `tqdb/main.py` — the six top-level collectors (affixes, creatures, equipment, quests, sets, skills)
- `tqdb/dbr.py`, `tqdb/templates.py`, `tqdb/storage.py` — record reader, template registry, global caches
- `tqdb/parsers/` — one `TQDBParser` subclass per game template; `base.py` holds the property formatters
- `tqdb/utils/text.py` — localized text loading and format-string conversion; `images.py` — TEX to PNG and sprite sheet
- `tqdb/constants/` — input globs and the hand-maintained boss-chest table
- `game/`, `data/`, `output/` — gitignored game content; `data/` is a Docker volume, not a host directory

## Hard Rules

- **Never commit game data.** Anything extracted from the game stays gitignored unless a decision in `docs/` says otherwise.
- **The website contract is frozen.** Property keys, the pre-formatted property strings, the six top-level JSON keys, the 19 equipment categories, the positional difficulty arrays, and the sprite CSS class names are all consumed by the site. Changing any of them is a website change too. `docs/data-contract.md` is the authority.
- **Game-data quirks are documented, not silently patched.** A workaround for a defect in the game files gets a comment naming the record and the symptom, and an entry in the game-data workarounds list in `docs/architecture.md`.
- **Localization goes through `texts.get`.** No English strings in parser output except where the game itself has none.
- **New code is path-portable.** Use `pathlib`, forward slashes, and lowercase game paths on both sides of every lookup.

## Working On This Project

- **Code executes in the container, never on the host.** `just test`, `just lint`, `just parse`, or `docker compose run --rm dev <cmd>`. The host has no Rust, Python, or uv. Edit on the host; run in the container.
- Always pass `--locked` to cargo and `--frozen` to uv, as the justfile does. Lockfiles change only via `just lock`, in their own commit.
- Run everything from the repo root. All input and output paths are relative to it.
- The full pipeline needs the extracted data volume (3.6 GB) and about 20 seconds per locale plus the sprite sheet. Prefer targeted checks on single records over full runs while iterating.
- Parser version is `tqdb/__init__.py:__version__` and `pyproject.toml`, and appears in the output filename. Bump both in one commit.
