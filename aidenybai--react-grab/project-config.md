## General Rules

- MUST: Use @antfu/ni. Use `ni` to install, `nr SCRIPT_NAME` to run. `nun` to uninstall.
- MUST: Use TypeScript interfaces over types.
- MUST: Keep all types in the global scope.
- MUST: Use arrow functions over function declarations
- MUST: Default to NO comments. Only add a comment when the user explicitly asks, or when the "why" is truly non-obvious - browser quirks, platform bugs, performance tradeoffs, fragile internal patching, or counter-intuitive design decisions. Never add comments that restate what the code does or what a well-named function/variable already conveys. When in doubt, leave the comment out.
  - Do not delete descriptive comments >3 lines without confirming with the user
- MUST: Use kebab-case for files
- MUST: Use descriptive names for variables (avoid shorthands, or 1-2 character names).
  - Example: for .map(), you can use `innerX` instead of `x`
  - Example: instead of `moved` use `didPositionChange`
- MUST: Frequently re-evaluate and refactor variable names to be more accurate and descriptive.
- MUST: Do not type cast ("as") unless absolutely necessary
- MUST: Remove unused code and don't repeat yourself.
- MUST: Always search the codebase, think of many solutions, then implement the most _elegant_ solution.
- MUST: Put all magic numbers in `constants.ts` using `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` with unit suffixes (`_MS`, `_PX`).
- MUST: Put small, focused utility functions in `utils/` with one utility per file.
- MUST: Use Boolean over !!.

## SolidJS Rules

### Mental Model

- MUST: Treat components as setup functions that run ONCE, not render functions.
- MUST: Place reactive work in primitives (`createMemo`, `createEffect`, `<Show>`, `<For>`), not component body.
- MUST: Access signals only inside reactive contexts (JSX expressions, effects, memos).

### Reactivity

- MUST: Call signals as functions: `count()` not `count`.
- MUST: Use functional updates when new state depends on old: `setCount((prev) => prev + 1)`.
- MUST: Keep signals atomic (one per value) - one big state object loses granularity.
- MUST: Use derived functions `() => count() * 2` for cheap/infrequent derivations.
- MUST: Use `createMemo(() => ...)` for expensive/frequent derivations - caches result.
- MUST: Use `createEffect` for side effects only (DOM, localStorage, subscriptions).
- MUST: Call `onCleanup(() => ...)` inside effects for subscriptions/intervals/listeners.
- MUST: Use path syntax for store updates: `setStore("users", 0, "name", "Jane")`.
- MUST: Wrap store props in arrow for `on()`: `on(() => store.value, fn)` not `on(store.value, fn)`.
- SHOULD: Use `{ equals: false }` for trigger signals that always notify.
- SHOULD: Use `batch(() => { ... })` when updating multiple signals outside event handlers.
- SHOULD: Use `on(dep, fn)` for explicit effect dependencies.
- SHOULD: Use `untrack(() => value())` to read without subscribing.
- SHOULD: Use `createStore({ ... })` for nested objects with fine-grained reactivity.
- SHOULD: Use `produce(draft => { ... })` for complex store mutations.
- NEVER: Derive state via `createEffect(() => setX(y()))` - use memo or derived function.
- NEVER: Place side effects inside `createMemo` - causes infinite loops/crashes.

### Effect Taxonomy

Before writing `createEffect`, classify the work and pick the right primitive:

- MUST: Use `createMemo` when the result is pure derived state from other signals/stores. If no external system is touched, it is not an effect.
- MUST: Use event handlers and direct action calls when work happens because a user clicked, selected, or navigated. Do not watch a flag/token in an effect to trigger imperative logic.
- MUST: Use `onMount`/`onCleanup` for one-time lifecycle setup and teardown (subscriptions, timers, imperative DOM wiring) that should not rerun for reactive changes.
- MUST: Keep `createEffect` single-purpose - one effect, one external bridge. Split mixed-responsibility effects.
- SHOULD: Use keyed ownership boundaries (keyed `<Show>`/`<For>`, or keyed `createRoot`) when local state should reset because an identity changed. Do not write a "watch key, clear state" effect.
- SHOULD: Normalize state at the write boundary, not via a repair effect that rewrites after the fact.
- NEVER: Use `createEffect` just to copy one store/signal into another - find the single source of truth.
- NEVER: Use `createEffect` as an event bus (watching a trigger signal to run a command). Call the action directly from the event source.

### Props

- MUST: Access props via `props.title`, not destructuring.
- SHOULD: Wrap in getter if needed: `const title = () => props.title`.
- SHOULD: Use `splitProps(props, ["keys"])` to separate local from pass-through props.
- SHOULD: Use `mergeProps(defaults, props)` for default values.
- SHOULD: Use `children(() => props.children)` only when transforming, otherwise `{props.children}`.
- NEVER: Destructure props `({ title })` - breaks reactivity.

### Control Flow

- MUST: Use `<For each={items()}>` for object arrays - item is value, index is signal.
- MUST: Use `<Index each={items()}>` for primitives/inputs - item is signal, index is number.
- MUST: Use `<Suspense fallback={...}>` for async, not `<Show when={!loading}>`.
