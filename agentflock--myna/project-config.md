# Myna — Project Instructions

## What is this project?

Myna is a local-first Chief of Staff for tech professionals. It's a set of AI agents that manage emails, Slack, meetings, projects, tasks, and people — drafting but never sending, organizing but never deciding. All data lives in an Obsidian vault as plain markdown.

**This project has two first-class outputs, not one:**

1. **Myna itself** — the working assistant.
2. **A methodology for having Claude autonomously build an agentic system end-to-end** — from feature ideas through architecture, foundations, and autonomous build, with concentrated human effort at design points and minimal oversight during the build. The methodology lives in `docs/design/foundations.md`, `docs/design/architecture.md`, `docs/design/product-decisions.md`, and `docs/design/architecture-decisions.md`. Intended to be reusable for building other agentic assistants on any capable LLM.

Treat process artifacts (decisions, foundations) with the same care as product artifacts. Both ship. When updating any process artifact, ask: "would this still make sense to someone using this playbook to build a different agentic assistant?"

**Status:** Phase 1 (Build) complete. Ready for Phase 2 (Install) targeting Claude Code.

## Key Documents

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/vision.md` | North star |
| `docs/design/product-decisions.md` | Product and behavior decisions — do not re-debate |
| `docs/design/architecture-decisions.md` | Runtime and install decisions — do not re-debate |
| `docs/design/architecture.md` | Runtime model, skill inventory, vault structure |
| `docs/design/foundations.md` | Vault folder structure, canonical file formats |

Approved features for every domain live in `docs/features/{domain}.md` under the `## Features` section. This is the only authoritative source for what's being built.

## Starting a Task

When the user says "start P{X}-T{Y}", "start phase N", "begin {task}", or similar task-kickoff phrasing:

1. Look up the task in `ROADMAP.md`.
2. Follow the task's instructions from there.

Do not invent a reading list or rules on the fly.

## Learning-Capture Discipline (D029)

When the user corrects your direction or you discover a non-obvious pattern during build work, write it to the appropriate file **immediately**, not at the end of the session. Structural learnings → `docs/design/foundations.md`. Rationale: D029.

**Test:** "If a fresh Claude session had only these files, would it succeed?" If no, the docs are incomplete — fix the docs, not the conversation.

## Git Conventions

- **Never auto-commit.** Only commit when the user explicitly asks.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `style:`, `ci:`, `build:`.
- Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit.
- Commit messages describe what was accomplished, not which files changed. Subject: lead with the most important change in plain language. Body: explain what was done and why — the decisions made, problems solved — not a list of edits.
- **Never add Co-Authored-By lines.**
- **Never create merge commits.** All merges must be fast-forward (`git merge --ff-only`). If a fast-forward isn't possible, rebase the source branch onto the target first. Never use `--no-ff`.
- **Pulls always rebase.** Use `git pull --rebase`. Never `git pull` without rebase.
- Update `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing changes — new behavior, bug fixes a user would notice, new skills. Skip for internal refactors, dev tooling changes, and doc cleanup. One entry per meaningful change, not per commit.

## Ground Rules

1. **Vision is authoritative.** If a requirement contradicts `docs/vision.md`, vision wins.
2. **Decisions are settled.** Don't re-open items in `docs/design/product-decisions.md` or `docs/design/architecture-decisions.md` unless the user explicitly asks.
3. **Add open questions.** If you surface a question not answered by existing docs, capture it in the appropriate decisions file as an unresolved item.
4. **Add decisions.** If the user settles a question during your conversation, add it to `docs/design/product-decisions.md` for behavior/feature questions, or `docs/design/architecture-decisions.md` for runtime/install questions.
5. **Claude-first, not Claude-only (D046).** Myna v1 targets Claude Code. Agent instructions can reference Claude Code capabilities directly. Content stays plain markdown — inherently readable by any LLM — but we don't architect for other runtimes upfront.
6. **Draft, never send.** Myna never sends emails, posts messages, or takes external actions (except personal calendar events with no attendees).

## Phase-Specific Instructions

Build pipeline is a **4-phase structure** (D044): Design (0), Build (1), Install (2), Ship (3).
