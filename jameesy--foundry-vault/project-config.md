# Foundry - An Agent-Run Obsidian Vault

This is an autonomous knowledge vault maintained by Claude. It follows the Karpathy wiki pattern: raw sources are ingested and compiled into a wiki of concepts, connections, and open questions. This file is the single source of truth for how Claude operates inside it.

## Companion vault (optional)

If you keep a personal vault (a commonplace, Zettelkasten, or notes folder), you can link it alongside this one. The contract:

- **Your vault** — read-only for Claude. Never write, edit, move, or delete anything there. Cross-link into it with `[[YourVault/Path/Note Title]]` style references when a Foundry note is informed by your writing.
- **Foundry** — Claude writes, maintains, reorganises. You read, query, and occasionally correct.

One-way read, cross-linkable. That's the contract. If you don't have a companion vault, Foundry works fine standalone.

## Directory structure

Three layers, following the Karpathy wiki pattern:

| Directory | Purpose | Who writes |
|---|---|---|
| `inbox/` | Staging for unprocessed drops (PDFs, URLs, screenshots, pasted text) | You drop, Claude clears |
| `sources/` | Immutable atomic source notes — one per article/paper/transcript | Claude on ingest; minor edits only after creation |
| `wiki/` | LLM-maintained pages: concepts, queries, people, index, log, health | Claude maintains |

Special files in `wiki/_meta/`:
- **`index.md`** — catalog of every page, keyword glossary, research threads, open questions, prompts, candidates. Claude reads this first when answering a query. Updated on every operation.
- **`log.md`** — append-only chronological record. Each entry: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] operation | Title`. Never rewritten, only appended.
- **`health.md`** — lint dashboard. Overwritten each `/foundry-lint` run.

---

## File naming

- **Source notes**: Title Case — `The Rosetta Stone of Design Engineering.md`
- **Concept articles**: Title Case, descriptive — `Design-engineering handoff.md`
- **People**: `FirstName LastName.md` with hyphens only inside compound names. If surname unknown, `FirstName.md` and note the uncertainty.
- **Queries**: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
- No emoji, no unicode hacks, no date prefixes in titles (dates go in front-matter)

---

## Front-matter

Plain key-value lines, not YAML. Blank line then `---` then body.

Note from @jameesy: This is very personal to the way I like to use Obsidian, and the way that I use tags across vaults. You can change to a different style here to suit however you are currently working.

**Source notes (`sources/`):**
```
Type: #type/source
Area: #area/craft/ai
Keyword: #keyword/knowledge-management #keyword/llms
Date created: [[2026-04-14]]
Source: https://example.com/article

---

**Summary**
3-5 sentences. Core claim.

**Key points**
- 5-10 tight bullets

**Claude's notes**
One paragraph: what's interesting, where it connects, what it contradicts.
```

**Wiki pages — concepts (`wiki/`):**
```
Type: #type/concept
Area: #area/craft/ai
Keyword: #keyword/knowledge-management
Date created: [[2026-04-14]]
Sources: [[Source One]], [[Source Two]]
Related: [[Concept A]], [[Concept B]]

---
```
Body: `What it is` > `Why it matters` > `Key points` > `Evidence across sources` > `Open questions` > `Prompts`.

**Voice for concepts.** The Foundry gives you a *foundation* for your own writing — not a finished essay. Favour sharp one-liners, evidence citations, and open questions over flowing prose. Key points should be pithy — one line each, claim-shaped. When in doubt, write less.

**Prompts.** Essay-shaped prompts where the concept intersects your existing notes or thinking. Distinct from Open questions (research gaps): Prompts are *"you could write this now."* One or two sentences each, pointed and specific. Empty is fine.

**Wiki pages — queries:**
```
Type: #type/query
Area: #area/craft/management
Keyword: #keyword/leadership
Date created: [[2026-04-14]]
Question: the question asked

---
```

**Wiki pages — people:**
```
Type: #type/person
Area: #area/craft/ai
Keyword: #keyword/llms
Date created: [[2026-04-14]]

---

One-line identifier. Topic description.

**Sources in the Foundry**
- [[Source Title]]

**Concepts they inform**
- [[Concept Title]]
```

---

## Tag taxonomy

Hierarchical sub-areas under Craft. Customise the top-level areas to match your life.

**`#area/`** — examples: Self, Craft, Work, Health, Finances, Meta (use whatever top-level areas fit your life)
**`#area/craft/`** — design, engineering, management, ai, product, writing

**`#type/`** — each note gets exactly one:
- `source` — an ingested external source (in `sources/`)
- `concept` — a synthesised wiki page built from 2+ sources
- `query` — a research report answering a question
- `person` — an entity page for a thinker/author
- `meta` — vault infrastructure (index, log, health)

**`#keyword/`** — free-form but curated via the Keywords section of `wiki/_meta/index.md`. Before creating a new keyword:
1. Check `wiki/_meta/index.md`
2. If a near-match exists, reuse it
