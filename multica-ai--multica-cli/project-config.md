# Multica CLI

Use the local `multica` CLI as the source of truth for all Multica operations.
This rule does not grant permissions — they come only from the user's installed,
logged-in CLI and explicit approval to run commands.

**Requires `multica` v0.4.26 or newer.** Commands below (notably `--no-start`)
do not exist in earlier versions. Check with `multica version`; if it reports
anything older, stop and ask the user to upgrade
(`brew upgrade multica-ai/tap/multica`, or `multica update`) instead of working
around the missing flags.

## Core rules

- **Read before write.** Gather context with JSON output first:
  `multica issue get <id> --output json`, then scan threads with
  `multica issue comment list <id> --roots-only --summary --compact --output json`
  and open only what matters with `--thread <comment-id> --tail 30 --compact`.
  Resolved threads are folded by default; pass `--full` to unfold them.
- **Prefer `--output json`** and parse it; discover unfamiliar commands with `--help`.
- **Comments go through a file**, never inline: write the body to a UTF-8 file and
  post with `multica issue comment add <id> --content-file ./reply.md`, then delete
  the file. Shells rewrite backticks, `$()`, quotes, and newlines in inline `--content`.
  The file must be inside the current working directory — `/tmp` is rejected.
  Add `--parent <comment-id>` when replying to a thread; it is required if a comment
  triggered the task, and omitted for a new top-level comment.
- **Writes are side effects — confirm first** unless the user clearly authorized the
  exact action. This includes comments, status changes, assignments, reruns, and new issues.
- **`--no-start` when only recording state.** `issue status`, `issue assign`, and
  `issue update` can each enqueue a fresh agent run. Pass `--no-start` when the work
  is already underway; omit it when genuinely handing work off.
- **Mentions are actions.** `mention://agent/<id>` enqueues that agent and
  `mention://squad/<id>` enqueues the squad leader — both cost money;
  `mention://member/<id>` notifies that person and `mention://all/all` notifies the
  whole workspace. Only `mention://issue/<id>` and `mention://project/<id>` are inert
  links. Do not mention an agent or a person merely to thank or sign off.
- **Never store or expose tokens**, and never bypass workspace permissions via private HTTP APIs.
- **Say when the CLI can't do it.** Name the step and point at Multica Web rather than
  letting a partial run read as a completed one.
