# Obsidian MCP Server

Self-hosted MCP server exposing an Obsidian vault (~2,577 markdown files) via semantic search, full-text search, and agentic exploration.

## Stack
- Python 3.12 / FastAPI / uvicorn
- SQLAlchemy async + asyncpg + pgvector
- MCP Python SDK (Streamable HTTP)
- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector (shared instance — see `.env`)
- Embedding provider abstraction (`src/services/embeddings.py`):
  - `OllamaProvider` — bge-m3 by default, set `OLLAMA_URL` in `.env`
  - `OpenAIProvider` — `text-embedding-3-{small,large}` over httpx, supports
    Azure OpenAI / OpenAI-compatible base URLs
- Jinja2 + htmx + Tailwind CDN control panel

## Project Layout
- `src/main.py` — FastAPI app, lifespan, MCP mount
- `src/config.py` — pydantic-settings
- `src/database.py` — async SQLAlchemy engine/session
- `src/models/db.py` — ORM models (api_keys, usage_logs, notes_metadata, note_embeddings, note_links)
- `src/mcp_server/` — MCP server, tools, auth middleware
- `src/services/` — vault ops, search, embeddings, indexer
- `src/api/` — control panel REST endpoints
- `src/control_panel/` — Jinja2 templates + static assets
- `alembic/` — database migrations

## Infrastructure
- Container: `obsidian-mcp`, listens on `:8000`
- Traefik routes: hostname driven by `MCP_HOSTNAME` in `.env`
  - Panel routes: OAuth protected via `chain-oauth@file`
  - MCP routes (`/mcp/*`): API key auth at app level
- Registry: `localhost:5000` (or change in `Makefile`)
- Deploy: `make deploy` (build → scan → push → backup → migrate → recreate)

## Public repo — host paths live outside the tree
This repo is published on GitHub. Anything host-specific (paths, secrets,
hostnames) must stay out of tracked files. The mechanism:
- `Makefile.local` (gitignored) overrides `DEPLOY_DIR` and `DATA_DIR`. On
  the production host both point at `/storage/docker/data/obsidian-mcp/`,
  which holds the real `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, and `backups/`.
- The compose project that owns the running container is rooted at
  `$(DEPLOY_DIR)`, not the repo. Always invoke `make` from the repo so
  `Makefile.local` loads — `cd /storage/docker/data/obsidian-mcp && docker
  compose ...` works but skips the build/push pipeline.
- The repo's `docker-compose.yml` and the deploy-dir copy are kept
  identical; if you change one, copy it over.

## Commands
- `make init` — first-time setup
- `make deploy` — full build, backup, migration, and deploy
- `make db-init` — create database + pgvector extension
- `make db-migrate` — run alembic migrations
- `make logs` — tail container logs
- `make status` — check health

## Engineering workflow

The standard flow — supervisor main thread, **Opus** subagents, OpenSpec, the
two Codex audit gates, `openspec-verifier`, and the `user-representative`
browser pass — is defined once in `~/.claude/rules/engineering-workflow.md` and
applies here. Read it; don't restate it. This section records only what is
specific to this MCP server.

**Local gates**

| Gate | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Dependency audit | `make audit` (pip-audit) |
| Migrations | `make db-migrate` (alembic) |
| Deploy | `make deploy` (build, backup, migrate, deploy) |

**Codex framing for this product.** The consumer here is an **agent**, not a
person, and the vault is Max's single source of truth for every project. The
expensive failures are **destructive writes** (an edit or append that clobbers
a note — this has actually happened) and **silently wrong search results**,
which an agent will act on without a human ever seeing the query. Treat any
change to the write tools, section addressing, or the chunking/embedding path
as a mandatory adversarial-pass trigger.

**No `user-representative` pass** — there is no browser UI. Substitute an
end-to-end exercise of the affected MCP tools against the live server, and say
in the report which tools were actually called.

## Key Decisions
- API keys use `omcp_` prefix, stored as SHA-256 hashes
- Vault mounted read-write at /obsidian in container
- Read responses are capped in characters (`MAX_READ_RESPONSE_CHARS`, default
  40,000) independently of the byte caps on disk I/O — see "Two kinds of size
  cap" below. Tool output is model input; the server must bound it.
- Embeddings: pluggable provider, `EmbeddingProvider` Protocol with two
  implementations (Ollama, OpenAI). Single `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` env var
  picks the backend; `get_provider()` is a cached singleton. Default is
  Ollama bge-m3 at 1024 dim, 512 token chunks, no overlap.
- Full-text search via PostgreSQL tsvector. The text-search config(s) are
  configurable via `FTS_CONFIGS` (default `["english"]`; e.g. `["simple"]` or
  `["english","norwegian"]`). Index- and query-time configs are kept in sync
  through `src/services/fts.py` (`index_tsvector_sql` / `combined_tsquery`).
  A note is indexed under every config (tsvectors `||`-concatenated) and a
  query matches if any config hits (tsqueries OR'd). Startup validates the
  config names against `pg_ts_config`. Changing `FTS_CONFIGS` requires `make
  rebuild-tsvectors` — keyword index only, no embeddings, no API calls.
- Vector search via pgvector HNSW index on `note_embeddings.embedding`
