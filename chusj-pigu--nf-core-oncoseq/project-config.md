# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
`main.nf` is the pipeline entrypoint. Top-level workflows live in
`workflows/`, reusable orchestration is in `subworkflows/`, and tool wrappers
are split between `modules/local/` and `modules/nf-core/`. Configuration is
under `conf/`, including resource presets and execution profiles such as
`conf/profiles/test.config`. Static inputs and templates live in `assets/`,
helper scripts in `bin/`, and sample data in `test_data/`.

Tests mirror the code layout. Use `tests/modules/.../*.nf.test`,
`tests/subworkflows/.../*.nf.test`, and `workflows/tests/*.nf.test` when adding
or updating coverage.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run a minimal local pipeline test with:

```bash
nextflow run . -profile test,docker --outdir test_results
```

Run the remote-assets profile with:

```bash
nextflow run . -profile test_remotes,apptainer --outdir test_results
```

Run nf-test suites with:

```bash
nf-test test --profile debug,test,docker --verbose
```

Lint the pipeline with:

```bash
nf-core pipelines lint .
```

Inspect merged configuration without launching tasks:

```bash
NXF_OFFLINE=true nextflow config -profile test_remotes
```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use 4-space indentation in `.nf` and `.config` files. Keep comments short and
focused on workflow intent. Follow existing channel naming patterns such as
`ch_input`, `ch_ref`, and `ch_<source>_for_<target>`. Name tests after the file
they cover, for example `tests/subworkflows/local/variant_calling/phasing.nf.test`.

When adding parameters, update `conf/params.config`,
`nextflow_schema.json`, and relevant docs in `README.md` or `docs/`.

## Testing Guidelines
This repository uses `nf-test`. Add or update tests for workflow behavior,
module interfaces, and regression fixes. Prefer the smallest realistic fixture
from `test_data/`. Before opening a PR, run the affected `nf-test` suite and at
least one `nextflow run` profile that exercises the changed path.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history favors short, imperative commit messages such as `Updated
whatshap`, `Corrected snp calling...`, or issue-linked prefixes like
`NO-54 added option to index single bam file input`. Keep commits scoped to one
change.

Open PRs against `dev`. Include a concise summary, linked issue, test evidence,
and any config or schema updates. If output structure or reports change, note
the user-facing impact clearly.
