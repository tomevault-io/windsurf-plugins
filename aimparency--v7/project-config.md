# Repository Agent Instructions

## Runtime

- Never start, restart, stop, or replace a development server for this
  repository unless the user explicitly asks for that exact action.
- Assume the local development stack is already running.
- Verify changes with focused tests, builds, static checks, or the existing
  runtime instead of launching another server.

## Aim Completion

- Use `review` when implementation and internal verification are complete but
  the feature still needs to be shown to and accepted by the user.
- Move an aim from `review` to `done` only after explicit user confirmation.
