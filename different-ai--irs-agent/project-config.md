    'A taxi driver earns $9461 per 1-hour work. ' +
    'If he works 12 hours a day and in 1 hour he uses 14-liters petrol with price $134 for 1-liter. ' +

console.log(`FINAL TOOL CALLS: ${JSON.stringify(toolCalls, null, 2)}`);
You can also use the experimental_output setting for generateText to generate structured outputs.

Accessing all steps
Calling generateText with maxSteps can result in several calls to the LLM (steps). You can access information from all steps by using the steps property of the response.


import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { steps } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  maxSteps: 10,
  // ...
});

// extract all tool calls from the steps:
const allToolCalls = steps.flatMap(step => step.toolCalls);
Getting notified on each completed step
You can use the onStepFinish callback to get notified on each completed step. It is triggered when a step is finished, i.e. all text deltas, tool calls, and tool results for the step are available.


import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: yourModel,
  maxSteps: 10,
  onStepFinish({ text, toolCalls, toolResults, finishReason, usage }) {
    // your own logic, e.g. for saving the chat history or recording usage
  },
  // ...
});
