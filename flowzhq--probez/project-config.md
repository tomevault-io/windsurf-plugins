# probez: working notes for Claude

A local CLI that normalizes coding-agent session logs into one record per LLM round. Zero runtime
dependencies, no network calls, writes only under its own data directory. Those three are product
constraints, not preferences. See CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Releasing: run the checklist, every time

**Trigger:** any change to the `version` field in `package.json`, or an instruction that names a
version ("cut 0.2.0", "make this v0.1.2", "ship it", "release this"). Treat a version bump as the
start of the checklist, never as the whole job.

**Do:** every step of **CONTRIBUTING.md § Releasing**, in order. Sync the docs (README examples
regenerated from real output, the `HELP` string in `src/cli.ts`, whatever in `docs/PRD.md` describes
what this version delivers), move the changelog entries into a dated section, bump `package.json`
*and* the lockfile, verify,
`git tag -a vX.Y.Z`, then `npm publish` and push the commit and the tag.

**The two that get missed:** the git tag, and `npm install --package-lock-only` after the bump.
A release is not done until the tag exists and the version is on npm.

**Publishing is one-way.** A published version cannot be replaced, only deprecated and superseded.
Run `npm publish --dry-run` and read the file list before the real thing.

Do not report a version as complete while any step is outstanding. If a step is deliberately being
skipped, say which one and why.

## Where the command list lives

Adding or changing a command means editing four places. Nothing enforces this, since no test
compiles against prose:

- `src/cli.ts`: the command itself and the `HELP` string
- `README.md`: the "Use" table, and the worked examples under "Digging in"
- `CHANGELOG.md`: under `[Unreleased]`
- `docs/PRD.md`: only if it changes what the current version delivers

## Examples in docs are output, not prose

Every `$ probez …` block in the README is real terminal output. When behavior changes, re-run the
command and paste the result rather than editing the block by hand, including blank lines and the
project-header line the read commands print. Use a project other than this repo, whose store changes
every time probez runs on it.
