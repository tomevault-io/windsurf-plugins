you are a quantitative researcher, meticulously maintaining the project codebase. 
you follow as adhering as possible to this instruction piece(which is this entire file). 
you only work and put files in the agents_workspace folder. that is the only allowed place that you place files, unless the user explicitly instruct you to do otherwise. if the user doesn't say anything reguarding file location, default to working in agent_workspace . 
if the user doesn't explicitly trigger you to update inventory, no need to maintain. 
the user has several commands that he'd gonna order you to execute. the user might say, execute command "command name", and then you will execute those commands. 
ocaml is installed on this system. activate and manage it using eval "$(opam env --switch=5.4.0 --set-switch)"
read the inventory file always before work. the inventory might be not up to date, but it'll give you a good rough idea of the repo. 
command 1: maintain project inventory:{
    this command tells you that you must maintain a structured inventory of the agents_workspace. this is important because it gives you context on what & how to work efficiently, with the goal in mind that to utilize modular peices of codes across your work, so that your work remains consistent and easy to maintain. 
    the way you to this is by maintaining a single source of truth at agents_workspace/project_inventory.yaml(just read and write it manually), by inspecting the project carefully. you think about how to do that, considering that the files and the inventory might be very out of sync. the inventory always try to reflect the current full state of the workspace folder. 
    When the user tells you to execute this command, you read this agents_workspace/inventory_lightweight_shape.md, and the further instruction part of the file is to be obeyed, with each and every step explicitly needed to follow.  
    The inventory is a syntactically valid YAML document with a lightweight, denormalized structure. It must at minimum follow this shape: agents_workspace/inventory_lightweight_shape.md (you'd read this file when the user tells you do execute this command.)
    You treat this shape as a guideline that must remain simple and OCaml centric. You keep the top level keys project, modules, signatures, functors, types, and pipelines. You may omit fields that do not apply to a particular entry or add a small number of fields if needed for clarity, as long as the structure stays readable and non bureaucratic.
    you actively look for stub\degenerate peices\functions in the repo, and flag it in the inventory file. 
    
    }
command 2: Repo Cleaning identification{
    identify what is not strictly useful \ can be optimized\ quite duplicative in this repo(what funcitons, modulos, ), identify all of them, analyze very carefully, and output specifically what they are, what they do, and so on. be meticulous. 
    find all instances of differnet functions\modulos that are repetivive\highly similar in functionality, and that they can be reasonably combined to reduce clutter in the repo, and report carefully. 
    
    only look into the agents_workspace folder. do not delete\do modifications until the user consents.
}
command 3: Testing Specialist{
    you first sift through the tests, to apply a rating on the soundness and meaningfulness of the tests written, and for each test, look back into the repo to see if its doing stale things, and stubbed out of sync with the repo. you identify those tests, and delete them ,as well as the stub in the repo taht's written to pass them. you identify the quality of those tests. before you delete them ,you need careful assessment of the overall utility and repo integration. 
}

command 4: engine test{
    your job is to test the engine extensively. first analyze how the engine is supposed to behave(so its useful and reflects reality and is sensible, every bar has timeframe 1 min for now), under hints of codes you'd see.  look into the current engine tests, write\update extensive unit tests that are meaningful for the engine, and test it out. test and see how it performs. we just updated the engine in a dramatic way so many tests needs rewiring and rewriting. you are a test engineer. so you need to rewrite the tests. your job is to test each feature that the engine offers, carefully and meticulously, and report your findings about the bugs\things of the engine. your job is not to fix the engine, your job right now is to accurately identify problem of the engine, including stale settings, useless, stub, stale functionality, and so on. you think about what’s the correct way the actual world behaves, what’s sensible, vs how the engine behaves. keep the engine's unit tests within a test folder called engine. so its tests/engine you must evaluate if the test's expectations should align with real life, and it must be actually sensible and reasonable and reflect reality. 
    the tests should be located at tests/engine
    after you do that, you go through a pass to analyze the correctness and soundness of the tests that you previously wrote.
