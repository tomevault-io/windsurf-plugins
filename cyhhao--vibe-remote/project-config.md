# Scenario Testing Standard

This directory is a portable standard package for capability-first, scenario-driven testing.

Treat this folder as the entrypoint when you are doing any of the following:

- designing or refactoring a project's testing architecture
- introducing scenario-harness or closed-loop flow testing
- defining reusable testing standards that should survive beyond one repository
- translating recurring manual regressions into stable automated coverage

## Mission

Build a testing system where feature work and bug fixes are validated as user-visible capability flows, not only as isolated unit behaviors.

The goal is not to replace unit tests or E2E tests.
The goal is to add a reusable middle layer that answers:

- what capability is being changed
- what scenarios define its success and failure boundaries
- what parts can be simulated deterministically
- what still requires contract, smoke, or manual verification

## Operating Rules

1. Start from capabilities, not files, modules, or bugs.
2. Require stable scenario IDs and reusable scenario catalogs.
3. Prefer shared harness primitives over one-off mocks.
4. Keep the harness light enough for everyday development use.
5. Turn the standard into delivery rules, not just reference docs.

## Folder Map

- `README.md`
  Overview and intended reuse model.
- `STANDARD.md`
  The core methodology and testing pyramid.
- `ADOPTION.md`
  The onboarding workflow for a testing-owner agent adopting this standard in a new project.
- `WORKFLOW.md`
  The day-to-day workflow for feature work, bug fixes, reviews, and CI.
- `templates/`
  Reusable templates for capability specs, scenario catalogs, dependency observations, and PR checklists.
- `examples/`
  Concrete project mappings. These explain how one repo applies the standard without redefining the standard itself.

## Deterministic Navigation Rule

Assume the next agent starts from zero memory and only has this file as its prompt.

That agent must be able to find the project's scenario assets through fixed locations, not through guesswork.

Preferred project layout:

- `tests/scenarios/INDEX.yaml`
  Project capability index. Read this first.
- `tests/scenarios/<capability>/catalog.yaml`
  Canonical scenario IDs and coverage state for that capability.
- `tests/scenarios/<capability>/observations.yaml`
  Historical dependency observations and reality-feedback notes for that capability.
- `tests/scenarios/<capability>/test_*.py`
  Executable scenario evidence.
- `tests/scenario_harness/`
  Shared harness primitives.

Human-facing docs may still exist elsewhere, but the project should make one location canonical for scenario metadata.

## Expected Outputs

For a project adopting this standard, the normal outputs are:

- a product and capability summary
- a capability map
- a capability spec
- a scenario catalog with stable IDs
- a harness boundary inventory
- a reusable scenario harness layer
- a dependency observation log
- project-specific reference scenarios
- PR/CI rules that enforce the standard

## Starting Rule

When adopting this standard in a new repository, start with `ADOPTION.md` before changing tests.

Use `WORKFLOW.md` only after the adoption baseline exists.

When working inside an already-adopted repository:

1. read the project's `tests/scenarios/INDEX.yaml`
2. open the target capability's `catalog.yaml`
3. open the same capability's `observations.yaml`
4. read the listed scenario test files
5. only then change production code, harness primitives, or docs

## Non-Goals

- inventing a heavy generic workflow engine up front
- forcing all real-world verification into automation
- replacing focused unit tests with giant scenario tests
- coupling the standard to Vibe Remote specifics

## Adoption Rule

When you add or modify a testing standard in this repository, update the project-specific guidance to point back to this folder rather than duplicating the standard elsewhere.
