description: Conventions and guidelines specific to the `packages/react` package.
---


- Follow all `general-monorepo-guidelines`.
- This package contains React components and hooks. Adhere to React best practices and the specific React linting rules (`@repo/config-eslint/react`).
- Prefer functional components and Hooks over class components.
- Tests utilize Vitest with `@testing-library/react`. Use `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers for DOM assertions. Ensure components, hooks, and interactions are well-tested.
