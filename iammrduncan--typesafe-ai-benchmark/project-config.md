# Agent instructions

## Mission

Maintain **typesafe-ai-benchmark**, a reproducible comparison of LLM-native
structured output from Qwen 3.8 on Cerebras and TypeSafe's native Jev judgment API.
Compare latency, cost and judgment outcomes on shared synthetic application tasks.
Preserve raw results, failures and mapping differences; distinguish type validity,
quality and performance. The standalone compatibility proxy supports the benchmark
and remains documented, but API imitation is not the project's primary goal.

The repository uses TypeScript, Node 22, npm workspaces, Fastify, Next.js and Zod.
Inspect existing code before adding tooling. Preserve validation and cancellation
on both provider paths. Do not claim universal speed rankings from this benchmark.

## Read first

1. Read [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) for implementation and verification rules.
2. Read the relevant code, tests, package scripts, and any scoped `AGENTS.md` files.
   Trace the affected request path and callers before proposing a change.
3. Use the human-owned [engineering principles](.agents/skills/engineering/reference/GOOD_ENGINEERING_H.md)
   and [ladder](.agents/skills/engineering/reference/ladder.md) for judgment.
   Do not edit those references to justify an implementation.

This file owns agent workflow; `CONVENTIONS.md` owns technical rules. `CLAUDE.md`
imports both. Keep each rule in one place. Explicit user instructions take priority
over repository guidance. More specific directory instructions apply to their scope.
If guidance conflicts, state the conflict and resolve it explicitly.

## Engineering judgment

- Understand the problem before judging the proposed solution. State what you do
  not know; distinguish observed behavior, assumptions, and recommendations.
- Climb the ladder: is the work necessary; does the repo already solve it; can the
  standard library, platform, or an installed dependency solve it; what is the
  smallest readable implementation? Never simplify away boundary validation,
  security, failure handling, or an explicit requirement.
- For a significant design, compare at least two approaches on simplicity,
  latency, correctness, and reversal cost. Record the choice and its tradeoffs near
  the implementation or in a short decision document when it spans modules.
- Prefer a working vertical slice and deep modules with narrow interfaces. Avoid
  provider frameworks, plugin registries, speculative configuration, and wrappers
  that only forward calls. Let shared abstractions emerge from actual use.
- Respect existing behavior. Trace why a guard exists before removing it. Fix bugs
  at the shared cause, inspect sibling callers, and add a regression check.
- Refactor in small working steps. Preserve unrelated user changes. Do not expand
  a task into a cleanup, migration, or product feature without a concrete need.

## Working agreement

- Act on implementation requests and finish the authorized work. Investigate facts
  yourself. Ask only when a missing decision materially affects scope, correctness,
  expense, or an irreversible action; continue independent work meanwhile.
- A request to review is read-only. When the
  [engineering skill](.agents/skills/engineering/SKILL.md) is invoked, follow the
  requested command and its reference. A separate explicit instruction to implement
  authorizes implementation; a finding by itself does not.
- Referenced skills are optional tooling unless the task invokes them. If a skill
  is unavailable, say so and use a small equivalent workflow where possible. Do not
  invent commands or make missing companion skills a dependency of routine work.
- Before changing code, identify the observable result and the smallest meaningful
  check. Before adding a dependency, explain the complexity it removes.
- Make a short progress update for substantial work. Surface evidence that changes
  the approach. Communicate plainly; do not give unsupported completion estimates.
- Do not expose credentials, commit local environment files, or send real user data
  to an upstream provider as incidental verification. Use synthetic fixtures.

## Compatibility discipline

Treat the public contract as a product feature. Consult the linked official sources
in `CONVENTIONS.md` when implementing an endpoint, and record the source date and
supported behavior in tests or compatibility documentation. Upstream docs can change
or disagree. Never infer a missing rule from a plausible example and call it exact.

Keep three claims separate: wire compatibility, judgment quality, and performance.
A valid JSON response proves neither calibrated probabilities nor equivalent model
behavior. A benchmark of local validation proves neither provider latency nor total
request latency. Unsupported behavior must be rejected or documented as a deliberate
compatibility limitation, never silently approximated.

## Definition of done

- The requested behavior works end to end, including the relevant failure path.
- Changed boundaries and invariants have meaningful checks. Bug fixes have regression
  coverage. Performance claims have reproducible measurements.
- Run the repository's relevant type checks, lint, tests, and build when available.
