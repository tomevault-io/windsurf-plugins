# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## What is QWERT

QWERT is a **dev environment manager** — not a package manager. The user declares what their machine should have in `~/.qwert/config.yml`, saves their dotfiles in a personal repo, and runs `qwert apply` on any new machine to replicate the environment exactly.

- `~/.qwert/config.yml` — the manifest: tools, stacks, hooks.
- `~/.qwert/` — the developer's personal dotfiles. Free-form directory, version-controlled in a personal git repo.
- `~/.local/share/qwert/` — qwert runtime data (recipes, completions, state, hooks, backups). Never edited by the user.
- `/opt/qwert/bin/qwert` — the binary.

No env vars needed. No shell config beyond what the installer writes.

## Architecture (v2 — Rust)

The current implementation is in Rust (`src/`). The original shell scripts are preserved in `v1/` with shims at the repo root.

## Recipe System

Recipes live in `recipes/<name>/` (cached to `~/.local/share/qwert/recipes/` at install time). Each recipe is a directory with up to two files — both optional:

```
recipes/
└── tmux/
    ├── install.toml   ← install/upgrade/uninstall + meta
    └── setup.toml     ← symlinks, copies, or commands for config setup
```

If only `setup.toml` exists, qwert synthesizes meta from the directory name and uses the platform default adapter. If neither file exists, qwert falls back to `brew install <name>` / `apt install <name>`.

### Types

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `brew` | BrewAdapter handles install/upgrade/uninstall from `meta.name` |
| `apt` | AptAdapter — same pattern |
| `pacman` | PacmanAdapter — same pattern |
| `qwert` | Custom commands in `[install]`, `[upgrade]`, `[uninstall]` sections |

### `install.toml`

```toml
[meta]
name = "tmux"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Terminal multiplexer"
type = "brew"          # brew | apt | pacman | qwert
depends = []           # other recipe names to install first
pkg = "git-delta"      # optional: override package name (default: meta.name)

[check]
command = "tmux"
version_flag = "-V"

# Only needed for type = "qwert" or cross-platform fallback
[install]
macos = "custom install command"
debian = ["step one", "step two"]
```

### `setup.toml`

```toml
# symlink: ~/.tmux.conf → ~/.qwert/tmux (undo = remove symlink)
dest = "~/.tmux.conf"
symlink = true
# src optional — defaults to ~/.qwert/<name>

# commands: run on setup (undo = [undo] section)
dest = "~/.qwert/iterm2"
