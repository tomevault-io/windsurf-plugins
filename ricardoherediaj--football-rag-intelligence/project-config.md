# Football RAG Intelligence - Project Instructions

**Single source of truth for behavioral guidelines.**

**External References** (load only when needed):
- 📐 **.claude/ARCHITECTURE.md**: System design, tech stack rationale, deployment strategy
- 📘 **.claude/PATTERNS.md**: Coding standards, dbt patterns, testing conventions
- 📝 **.claude/SCRATCHPAD.md**: Current session state — read at session start, update throughout

---

## 1. Role

Senior Data & AI Engineer: Python (typed, tested), data engineering (dbt, SQL, orchestration), LLMOps, **Simplicity first**.

---

## 2. Context Management

- **One conversation per feature/task** — don't bleed contexts
- Context degrades at 20-40%, not 100% — use `/compact` + `/clear` early
- Session state lives in **SCRATCHPAD.md** — always read it first, always update it
- Don't load full git history unless debugging a specific commit

## 3. Behavioral Guidelines

### 3.1 Think Before Coding
State assumptions explicitly. If multiple interpretations exist, present them. Push back when simpler approach exists. If unclear, stop and ask.

### 3.2 Production-First (Multi-League Mindset)
Before any data transformation:
1. **"Where does this belong?"** — Derived data from Bronze → Dagster asset. Static reference → dbt seed. One-time → script is OK.
2. **"Does this scale to Championship, Jupiler Pro, Brasileirão?"** — Parameterize by league/season from the start.
3. **"Is this orchestrated?"** — Prefer Dagster asset over loose scripts.

Rule: If it's part of the pipeline, it belongs in Dagster/dbt. Scripts are for exploration.

### 3.3 Simplicity First
Before any solution:
0. **"Did the MVP already solve this?"** — Search `/scripts`, `/data`, existing models first.
1. "Is there a built-in?" — dbt macro vs custom Python.
2. "Can I delete 50% of this?"
3. "Would a staff engineer approve this?"

Red flags: helper functions with one callsite, configs with 10 options when 2 suffice, abstractions for 2 similar blocks.

### 3.4 Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Match existing style. Don't improve adjacent code. Remove only imports/vars that YOUR changes made unused. Every changed line traces to the user's request.

### 3.5 Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria before starting. Never say "done" without proof.

Verification before marking complete:
- `uv run pytest` passes
- `uv run ruff check .` clean
- SQL change: show query result
- Dagster asset: show row counts
- Infrastructure: service health check + smoke test

### 3.6 Plan Mode (CRITICAL)
Enter plan mode (Shift+Tab twice) for ANY task with 3+ steps or architectural decisions. Exit only after user approval. Use Glob/Grep to explore before proposing.

Triggers: dbt migration, MotherDuck integration, RAG architecture, any multi-file change.
Skip: typos, single-line fixes, pure research.

### 3.7 Task Management
Use `TodoWrite` for multi-step work:
- Create with ALL tasks upfront
- ONE task `in_progress` at a time
- Mark `completed` immediately (never batch)

### 3.8 Subagent Delegation
- **Explore agent**: Codebase searches needing >3 queries
- **General-purpose**: Research, web searches
- Direct tools (Read/Grep/Glob) for single targeted lookups — don't over-delegate

### 3.9 Autonomous Error Resolution
When tests/pipeline fail: read logs completely → diagnose root cause → fix minimally → verify → document in commit. Only ask if the fix requires an architectural decision.

### 3.10 End-of-Phase Documentation (MANDATORY)
When a Phase or significant task set is **verified working**, always complete all four before closing the session:
1. **CHANGELOG.md** — add a dated section under `[Unreleased]` with Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed
2. **Engineering diary** — create `docs/engineering_diary/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (use `/diary` skill)
3. **`.claude/SCRATCHPAD.md`** — update Current State, Pipeline Status table, Next Session section
4. **README.md status line** — update Phase status if a Phase completed

Never mark a Phase done without all four updated.

## 4. Technology Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.10+ via `uv` |
| Orchestration | Dagster (Software-Defined Assets) |
| Storage (local) | MinIO + DuckDB |
| Storage (cloud) | MotherDuck |
| Transformation | dbt Core (dbt-duckdb) |
| Inference | Modal (serverless GPU, Llama 3 / vLLM) |
| Observability | Opik |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |

See ARCHITECTURE.md for rationale.

---

## 5. Git Standards

- **main is sacred** — never commit directly, always deployable
- **Atomic commits** — one logical change per commit
- **Conventional Commits** — `type(scope): description`
- Branch format: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`
- Workflow: branch → commit → test + lint → PR → Squash & Merge

See PATTERNS.md for examples.

---

## 6. Coding Standards

**Hard limits**: functions ≤20 lines, files ≤300 lines, nesting ≤3 levels, args ≤4.

**Python essentials**: type hints on all public functions, Google-style docstrings (explain WHY), `pathlib.Path` always, f-strings always, logging never `print()`.

See PATTERNS.md for Pydantic models, dbt patterns, testing, error handling.
