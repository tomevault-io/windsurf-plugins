## Plugin Structure

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — Marketplace manifest (root level)
- `founder-skills/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Plugin manifest with hooks
- marketplace.json must match Anthropic's format: only `name`, `owner`, `plugins` (each with `name`, `source`, `description`)
- Do NOT add `version` or `metadata` fields to marketplace.json

## Script Conventions

- Scripts use PEP 723 inline metadata; default to `python`, `uv run` optional
- Scripts output JSON to stdout, warnings/errors to stderr
- All scripts support `--pretty` for human-readable output and `-o <file>` to write to file (skill scripts emit a JSON receipt to stdout confirming the write)
- Skill-local scripts live in `founder-skills/skills/<skill>/scripts/`

## Shared Scripts

- **`founder_context.py`** — Per-company context management (init/read/merge/validate subcommands); protects 11 key metric fields
- **`find_artifact.py`** — Resolves artifact paths by skill name, artifact filename, and optional company slug

## Market Sizing Scripts

- **`market_sizing.py`** — TAM/SAM/SOM calculator (top-down, bottom-up, or both)
- **`sensitivity.py`** — Stress-test assumptions with low/base/high ranges and confidence-based auto-widening
- **`checklist.py`** — Validates 22-item self-check with pass/fail per item
- **`compose_report.py`** — Assembles report from artifacts, validates cross-artifact consistency
- **`visualize.py`** — Generates self-contained HTML with SVG charts; outputs HTML (not JSON)

## Deck Review Scripts

- **`checklist.py`** — Scores 35 criteria across 7 categories (pass/fail/warn/not_applicable) with overall score percentage
- **`compose_report.py`** — Assembles deck review artifacts into final report with cross-artifact validation
- **`visualize.py`** — Generates self-contained HTML with SVG charts; outputs HTML (not JSON)

## IC Simulation Scripts

- **`fund_profile.py`** — Validates fund profile structure (archetypes, check size, thesis, portfolio)
- **`detect_conflicts.py`** — Validates agent-produced conflict assessments and computes summary stats
- **`score_dimensions.py`** — Scores 28 dimensions across 7 categories with conviction-based scoring
- **`compose_report.py`** — Assembles IC simulation artifacts into final report with cross-artifact validation
- **`visualize.py`** — Generates self-contained HTML with SVG charts; outputs HTML (not JSON)

## Financial Model Review Scripts

- **`extract_model.py`** — Extracts structured data from Excel (.xlsx) and CSV files into model_data.json
- **`validate_extraction.py`** — Anti-hallucination gate: cross-references model_data.json against inputs.json (company name, salary, revenue, cash traceability, scale plausibility); `--fix` auto-corrects scale denomination issues (e.g., model in $000)
- **`validate_inputs.py`** — Four-layer validation of inputs.json (structural, consistency, sanity, completeness); `--fix` auto-corrects sign errors
- **`checklist.py`** — Scores 46 criteria across 7 categories with profile-based auto-gating by stage/geography/sector
- **`unit_economics.py`** — Computes and benchmarks 11 unit economics metrics against stage-appropriate targets
