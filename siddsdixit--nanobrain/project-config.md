# nanobrain — Cursor activation

This file tells Cursor how to use the brain repo. Cursor auto-loads `.cursorrules` from the workspace root. For the newer `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` format, see [docs/COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Boot sequence

Before responding to any task, read these files from the brain root:

1. brain/self.md — identity, voice, principles
2. brain/goals.md — current and long-term goals
3. brain/projects.md — active threads (index)
4. brain/people.md — contacts (index)
5. CONTEXT.md — what's literally happening this week

For per-entity detail, read the linked file under brain/people/<slug>.md or brain/projects/<slug>.md.

## Query the brain via MCP

code/mcp-server/ exposes read_brain_file with context-filter enforcement. Configure Cursor's MCP support in Settings → Features → Model Context Protocol. Server entry point: code/mcp-server/server.sh.

## Hard rules

- Direct. No preamble. Lead with the point.
- No em dashes. Use commas, periods, parentheses.
- One sentence per decision. Suggest simpler approaches before implementing.
- Max 4 files per response unless purely mechanical.
- Never scaffold/create files unless asked.
- Never create parallel implementations. Ask "replace or integrate?" first.
- Read existing code first. Match existing patterns.
- When in doubt, ask.

## Capture

Cursor does not emit a session-end hook usable by nanobrain. To capture a Cursor session into the brain, run /brain-save with key takeaways. A wrapper script for automatic capture lands in v2.2.
