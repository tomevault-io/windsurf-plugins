# mimageviewer - Codex Instructions

This file is the compact Codex entry point for this repository. `CLAUDE.md`
contains the broader project context and operational notes; read only the
sections relevant to the current task instead of treating the whole file as
always-active guidance.

## Before Editing

- Start by identifying the affected area and read the matching docs from
  `docs/README.md`.
- For architecture-sensitive changes, also read
  `docs/architecture-overview.md`.
- If a task touches display, fullscreen, thumbnail loading, folder scanning,
  virtual folders, presets, adjustments, AI features, or UI responsiveness,
  read the related document listed near the top of `CLAUDE.md` in the
  required-before-work section.
- If a task touches keyboard shortcuts, key events, or shortcut documentation,
  read `docs/keymap-spec.md` and `docs/key-customization-impl-plan.md`. New
  keyboard operations should go through `KeyAction` / keymap helpers unless the
  operation is intentionally fixed and documented as outside keymap scope.
- On Japanese Windows, PowerShell 5.1 may mojibake UTF-8 files without a BOM.
  When reading repository documents through PowerShell, use
  `Get-Content -Encoding UTF8` explicitly.
- Check the current git status before editing. Do not revert or overwrite
  unrelated user changes.
- In separate worktrees, do not create junctions, symlinks, or other reparse
  point links for `vendor/`, `target/`, or runtime dependency directories. If a
  worktree needs those files, copy the real files/directories into that
  worktree or run the setup scripts there. Before removing a worktree or copied
  dependency directory, verify the target path and do not recurse through
  reparse points.

## Core Engineering Rules

- Keep UI work responsive. Do not add synchronous I/O, heavy decoding, folder
  scans, GPU uploads, or blocking waits on the UI thread.
- Do not implement waiting with `try_lock` plus `sleep`. Move blocking work to a
  worker, use channels, or make state transitions explicit.
- Preserve thumbnail, fullscreen, ZIP/PDF virtual folder, preset/adjustment, and
  AI workflows when changing shared data structures.
- Treat path handling, archive extraction, external tools, and metadata writes
  as security-sensitive. Avoid trusting archive paths or user-provided paths
  without validation.
- Follow existing Rust, egui, and module patterns before introducing new
  abstractions.
- Avoid temporary workaround fixes for correctness-sensitive behavior. Choose a
  design that can be made fundamentally correct; if the correct design is larger
  than expected, document the scope and proceed in coherent steps rather than
  landing a stopgap that is likely to create follow-up bug reports.
- Do not remove, disable, delay, or degrade existing user-facing functionality as
  a bug fix or temporary workaround without explicit user approval. If a correct
  fix appears to require a behavior change, explain the trade-off and ask before
  editing. Bug fixes should preserve the intended feature set unless the user has
  approved the functional change.

## Bug Fix Policy

- Before changing code for a bug, identify the observed failure, the expected
  invariant, and the code path that violates it. Use logs, traces, tests, and
  source inspection to confirm the root cause instead of patching the most
  visible symptom.
- Fix the root cause at the ownership boundary where the incorrect state or
  transition is created. Avoid adding guards, delays, retries, extra repaint
  calls, blanket resets, or silent fallbacks unless they are part of the root
  cause fix and their invariants are documented.
- If the investigation shows that the correct fix is larger than the current
  scope, stop and explain the trade-off to the user before editing further.
  Offer coherent options, such as spending more time on the architectural fix,
  splitting the work into reviewed phases, or explicitly changing the
  user-facing specification to avoid the problematic behavior.
- Do not land a temporary behavior change, feature restriction, or partial
  workaround just to pass one manual smoke test unless the user explicitly
  approves that trade-off. When an approved mitigation is necessary, document
  what remains unresolved and how the final fix should replace it.
- Add regression coverage at the level where the bug happened whenever practical:
  pure state-transition tests for state bugs, handler-level tests for input
  routing bugs, and focused integration or log-based checks for lifecycle and
  multi-window behavior that cannot be reproduced in unit tests.

## UI And Tests

- For display, scroll, fullscreen, dialog, or layout changes, check
  the `CLAUDE.md` sections for UI/scroll behavior, `egui::Window` dialogs, and
  UI responsiveness review points as needed.
- Preserve Japanese IME behavior. For text input changes, read the
  `CLAUDE.md` IME section first.
- Changes that affect visible UI should include or update snapshot coverage
  when practical. See the UI snapshot test section in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Run the narrowest relevant tests first, then broaden when the change touches
  shared behavior.
