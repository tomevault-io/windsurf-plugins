# Athen -- Universal AI Agent

Athen is a **universal, proactive AI agent** built as a native desktop application (Tauri 2 + Rust). It monitors emails, calendar, messages, and direct input ("senses"), evaluates what needs doing, and executes tasks autonomously -- with a dynamic risk system that decides when to act silently vs. ask for permission. Designed for non-technical users: single binary, native GUI, zero runtime dependencies.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Core | Rust | Speed, memory safety, native cross-platform |
| UI | Tauri 2 | Native app with web frontend, tiny binaries |
| MCPs | Rust binaries | Standalone tools, no runtime deps |
| Database | SQLite | Embedded, serverless, portable |
| Shell | Nushell (embedded) | Cross-platform consistent shell + native fallback |
| Sandbox | OS-native + Podman/Docker | Tiered isolation, zero user setup for OS-native |

## Architecture

Multi-process architecture communicating over IPC (Unix sockets / Named pipes).

```
SENTIDOS (Monitors) --IPC--> SENSE ROUTER (Tauri) --events--> COORDINADOR
                                                                   |
                                                          IPC (TaskAssignments)
                                                         /    |    \
                                                    Agent1  Agent2  AgentN
                                                         \    |    /
                                                      EXECUTION LAYER
                                              (MCPs + Shell + Scripts + HTTP)
```

```

## Design Principles (CRITICAL)

### 1. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

`athen-core` defines ALL traits (ports). Every other crate implements adapters. No crate depends on a sibling -- only on `athen-core`. `athen-app` is the composition root that wires implementations together.

### 2. Dependency Rules

- `athen-core` depends on NOTHING internal (only serde, chrono, uuid, thiserror, async-trait, url, tokio-stream)
- All other crates depend on `athen-core` for trait definitions
- Crates NEVER depend on sibling crates (except through `athen-core` traits)
- `athen-app` is the ONLY crate that depends on multiple siblings
- Future bundled MCPs (Slack, Notion, ...) will live under `crates/mcps/` as standalone JSON-RPC servers that do NOT depend on `athen-core`

### 3. Independent Testability

Every crate can be tested in isolation by mocking trait dependencies.

## Coding Guidelines

- Async: `tokio` runtime, `#[async_trait]` for trait definitions
- Errors: `thiserror` with `AthenError` enum and `Result<T>` from `athen-core::error`
- Serialization: `serde` with `Serialize`/`Deserialize` derives
- IDs: `uuid::Uuid` v4 | Timestamps: `chrono::DateTime<Utc>`
- Platform-specific: `#[cfg(target_os = "...")]`
- Logging: `tracing` crate
- HTTP: `reqwest` with `rustls-tls` (no OpenSSL)
- Tests: mock trait dependencies, not real services
- `cargo clippy --workspace` must produce zero warnings
- All config via UI, never config files -- Athen is for non-technical users
- NEVER commit or push to git unless explicitly asked by the user

## Key Commands

```bash
# Build & test
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace

# Run CLI
