description: The alint check --format agent report: a flat violations array, a templated agent_instruction per finding, lowercase severities, stable behind schema_version 1.
---


`alint check --format agent` emits JSON shaped for AI coding agents that consume alint inside their own self-correction loops. It reports the same findings as [`--format json`](/docs/reference/output-formats/), reshaped so an agent can act on one violation at a time without re-deriving what to do.

```bash
alint check --format agent
```

`--format agentic` and `--format ai` are aliases for the same format.

## How it differs from `--format json`

- **Flat list of violations.** `json` groups violations under each rule result; `agent` flattens them into a single `violations` array, so an agent loops once.
- **A templated `agent_instruction` per violation.** A ready-to-act sentence composed from the severity, message, location, fix availability, and policy URL. `json` leaves that synthesis to the consumer.
- **`severity` is a lowercase string** (`"error"` / `"warning"` / `"info"`), not the SARIF level mapping, so it drops straight into a prompt.
- **Check-side only.** There is no agent-format fix report. An agent confirming a fix landed re-runs `alint check --format agent` against the modified tree.

## The self-correction loop

The format exists to make an agent's lint loop deterministic: the agent makes a change, runs `alint check --format agent` (locally or in CI), reads its own violations, acts on each `agent_instruction`, and re-runs until the report is empty.

## Report shape

A report is a single JSON object. This example has three violations: one path-bound and fixable, one path-bound and not, and one tree-wide.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "format": "agent",
  "summary": {
    "total_violations": 3,
    "by_severity": { "error": 1, "warning": 2, "info": 0 },
    "fixable_violations": 1,
    "passing_rules": 18,
    "failing_rules": 3
  },
  "violations": [
    {
      "rule_id": "agent-no-console-log",
      "severity": "warning",
      "file": "src/api.ts",
      "line": 2,
      "column": 1,
      "human_message": "console.log left in non-test source.",
      "agent_instruction": "warning: console.log left in non-test source. To resolve: edit src/api.ts:2:1.",
      "fix_available": false
    },
    {
      "rule_id": "final-newline",
      "severity": "warning",
      "file": "src/config.ts",
      "human_message": "File does not end with a newline.",
      "agent_instruction": "warning: File does not end with a newline. To resolve: edit src/config.ts — or run `alint fix --only final-newline` to apply the auto-fix.",
      "fix_available": true,
      "fix_command": ["fix", "--only", "final-newline"]
    },
    {
      "rule_id": "lockfiles-only-one",
      "severity": "error",
      "human_message": "Multiple lockfiles found.",
      "agent_instruction": "error: Multiple lockfiles found. To resolve: this is a repository-level rule with no specific file location; resolve the underlying invariant the rule enforces.",
      "fix_available": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | integer | Always `1` for this schema. |
| `format` | string | Always `"agent"`. Lets a multi-format consumer route on one field. |
| `summary` | object | Aggregate counts (below). |
| `violations` | array | One entry per violation, flattened across all rules. |

### `summary`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `total_violations` | integer | Length of `violations`. |
| `by_severity` | object | `error`, `warning`, `info`, each an integer count. |
| `fixable_violations` | integer | How many violations come from a rule that declares an autofix. Use it to decide whether to suggest `alint fix`. |
| `passing_rules` | integer | Rules that produced no violation. |
| `failing_rules` | integer | Rules that produced at least one violation. |

### `violations[]`

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rule_id` | string | yes | Matches the `id:` of a rule in your config. |
| `severity` | string | yes | `"error"`, `"warning"`, or `"info"`. |
| `human_message` | string | yes | The rule's message verbatim. Mirror of `message` in `--format json`. |
| `agent_instruction` | string | yes | Templated remediation phrasing (see below). |
| `fix_available` | boolean | yes | `true` when the source rule declares an autofix. |
| `fix_command` | array of strings | no | Present iff `fix_available`. Exact argv (after `alint`) to auto-fix this one violation — e.g. `["fix", "--only", "final-newline"]`. Run it programmatically instead of parsing the command out of `agent_instruction`. |
| `file` | string | no | Repo-relative path. Absent for tree-wide (cross-file) violations. |
| `line` | integer | no | 1-based line, when the rule reports one. |
| `column` | integer | no | 1-based column, when the rule reports one. |
| `policy_url` | string | no | Documentation URL provided by the rule. |

`off` rules never produce violations, so `"off"` never appears as a severity.

## How `agent_instruction` is composed

The string is built deterministically, not generated by a model. The shape is:
