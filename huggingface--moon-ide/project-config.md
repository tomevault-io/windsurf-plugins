# Agent instructions

This file is read by AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, opencode, etc.) when working in this repo. Humans read it too.

## Read-before-touching

1. Always read [specs/](specs/) before changing anything non-trivial. Specs describe intent; code is the implementation.
2. Skim [specs/architecture.md](specs/architecture.md) and [specs/protocol.md](specs/protocol.md) first.
3. Phased plan lives in [specs/roadmap.md](specs/roadmap.md).
4. Architecture decisions are in [specs/decisions/](specs/decisions/) (numbered ADR-style).

## Update-as-you-go

- If a spec is wrong or incomplete and you fix the underlying code, **update the spec in the same change**.
- New non-trivial decisions get a new ADR in `specs/decisions/NNNN-short-title.md`. Don't rewrite old ADRs; supersede them with a new one. ADRs and roadmap entries stay as terse as specs do — context, decision, rejected alternatives — not a play-by-play of the implementation.
- Keep specs short, opinionated, and current. They are not aspirational marketing.
- Specs record **contracts and intent**: wire shapes, schemas, invariants, behavior the user can observe, and the _why_ behind non-obvious decisions (including rejected alternatives). They do **not** narrate the implementation — no lock orders, no function-by-function walkthroughs, no event-choreography play-by-plays, no Svelte/Rust internals that `git log -p` and code comments already cover. Litmus test: if the paragraph would have to change after a behavior-preserving refactor, it belongs in the code, not the spec. When detail matters, link the file or test plan instead of inlining it.
- **Test plans are outdated.** Don't create new ones and don't modify existing ones — the historical files in `specs/test-plans/` are left in place as a record but are no longer maintained. Record intent in ADRs and roadmap entries instead (terse — context, decision, alternatives); a clear commit body + `git log -p` covers everything else.

## House rules

- **Early return** is preferred over nested conditionals.
- **No global try/catch in HTTP-style endpoints or Tauri commands**; let an error middleware / `tauri::Result` boundary handle it.
- **MB/kB use 1000-multiples**, not 1024.
- **Comments explain non-obvious intent only**, never narrate what the code does.
- **No emoji in code, docs, or commit messages** unless explicitly asked.
- **No one-line `if` / `else` / `for` / `while` without braces** — always use a block. Enforced by `oxlint`'s `curly` rule for JS/TS; Rust gets the same treatment by reviewer taste.
- **Tabs, not spaces** for indentation in every file we author. Editor display width is in `.editorconfig`. See [ADR 0004](specs/decisions/0004-code-style.md).
- Match existing code style. Don't do drive-by whole-file reformats just because you opened the file — that's review-noise and makes `git blame` worse.
- **No pre-existing warnings or actionable suggestions.** If `cargo build`, `cargo clippy`, `vite build`, `tsgo`, `svelte-fast-check`, `oxlint`, the Svelte MCP autofixer, or any other tool we use prints a warning or a concrete suggestion (e.g. "this `$effect` should be `$derived`", "this `bind:this` could be an attachment"), treat it as a bug and fix it — even on lines you didn't touch, even if it isn't your fault, and even if it isn't what you were asked to do. The repo stays clean. The only exception is when the fix genuinely needs a wider refactor than the current change can absorb; in that case, suppress it locally with a comment explaining why, or open a follow-up note in the relevant spec.

## Tooling

- Format: `bun run fmt` (oxfmt + prettier-svelte) and `cargo fmt --all`.
- Lint: `bun run lint` (oxlint, type-aware) and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
- Type-check: `bun run check` (`tsgo --noEmit` + `svelte-fast-check`).
- Test: `bun run test` (`vitest run` for JS/Svelte + `cargo test --workspace`). **Do not use `bun test`** — Bun's built-in runner doesn't compile Svelte's `$state` runes and trips on `*.svelte.ts` modules. Use the script.
- Full details and rationale: [ADR 0004 — code style](specs/decisions/0004-code-style.md).
- The IDE has to be able to develop itself. See [ADR 0005 — bootstrap](specs/decisions/0005-bootstrap.md).

## Phased delivery

This project is built in numbered phases (see [specs/roadmap.md](specs/roadmap.md)). **Stop at the end of each phase and wait for human review** before starting the next. The completion checklist at the bottom of each phase in the roadmap is the gate; do not auto-proceed even if every box is ticked.

## Scope discipline

Moon IDE serves one specific team. It is **not** a generic product, and the roadmap is **not** a wishlist.

- Don't pad phases with "nice-to-have" features just because other IDEs have them. If a feature isn't actively requested or blocking real work, leave it out — the team will surface real needs through testing and feedback.
- Hardcode first, configure later. If the team needs exactly one keybinding / one theme / one shortcut, hardcode it. Add user configuration when there's a second concrete need, not preemptively.
