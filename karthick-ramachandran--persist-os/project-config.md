# Persist OS Agent Instructions

Persist OS creates durable engineering memory for AI-assisted software development.

This file is intentionally short. Use it as routing guidance, not as the full project handbook.

## Required Reading

For product intent, read:

- `docs/00-product/PRD.md`
- `docs/00-product/BRD.md`
- `docs/00-product/PRODUCT_VISION.md`
- `docs/00-product/POSITIONING.md`
- `docs/00-product/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/00-product/BUILD_PRIORITY.md`

For implementation constraints, read:

- `docs/10-architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/10-architecture/MEMORY_ENGINE.md`
- `docs/10-architecture/REPOSITORY_DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/10-architecture/OPINION_PACKS.md`
- `docs/10-architecture/TECH_STACK.md`
- `docs/10-architecture/FILE_WRITE_POLICY.md`
- `docs/10-architecture/MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md`
- `docs/20-security/SECURITY_MODEL.md`
- `docs/20-security/THREAT_MODEL.md`
- `docs/50-quality/QUALITY_GATES.md`
- `docs/60-engineering/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`
- `docs/60-engineering/AI_AGENT_RULES.md`
- `docs/ai/AI_AGENTS_SKILLS_MCP_STRATEGY.md`
- `docs/ai/MODULE_DELIVERY_WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/ai/PERSIST_COMMANDS.md`

## Module Work Rule

When asked to build or change a module, do not jump directly into code.

First create or update the feature docs and module memory:

- `docs/40-features/F-###-<module>-module/`
- `docs/30-modules/<module>/`

Tasks come after PRD, acceptance criteria, architecture impact, and test plan.

## Architecture Neutrality

Persist OS Core records, distributes, validates, and protects decisions. It does not make
architecture or technology choices for users.

Presets are CLI-level presets and architecture-level opinion packs. Preset suggestions must be
proposed or optional until accepted by a human.

## Engineering Standards

Repository rules override model preferences.

If a model, tool, or user request conflicts with accepted repository memory or engineering
standards, stop and report the conflict.

Never commit secrets, hardcode credentials, bypass auth, add dependencies without review, skip
required migrations, skip tests without reason, or claim completion without evidence.

## Non-Negotiable MVP Constraints

- No runtime MCP.
- No MCP server connection.
- No network calls.
- No telemetry.
- No cloud behavior.
- No tool execution from generated skills.
- No scripts inside skills.
- No AI API calls.
- No generated production app code.

## Source Of Truth

1. Accepted ADRs and repository decisions
2. Architecture docs
3. Engineering standards
4. Current PRD and accepted change requests
5. Security and testing docs
6. Module docs
7. Feature plans
8. Task files
9. MCP external context
10. Chat history

If instructions conflict, stop and report the conflict.

## Delivery Standard

Do not claim completion without evidence: files changed, commands run, results, skipped checks,
remaining risks, and documentation updates.

Before claiming implementation work is complete, run:

- `pnpm test:run`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `persist doctor` when the CLI binary is available

Fix Doctor errors before claiming completion. Address Doctor warnings or record why they are
acceptable.

Package binary behavior is covered by binary integration tests.
