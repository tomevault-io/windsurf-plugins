# Engram

Engram is a memory service for AI agents. It stores complete, verbatim conversation transcripts and makes them searchable via semantic search.

## Project Structure

- `packages/shared/` — Types, Zod schemas, utilities (ID generation, chunking, auth)
- `packages/db/` — D1 migrations and typed query helpers
- `apps/mcp-server/` — Cloudflare Worker MCP server (Hono.js)

## Development

```bash
pnpm install        # install deps
pnpm build          # build all packages
pnpm test           # run all tests
pnpm typecheck      # type check
```

MCP server dev:
```bash
cd apps/mcp-server
npm run dev                # local server on :8787
npm run db:migrate:local   # apply D1 migrations locally
npm run seed               # generate test org + API key
```

## Deployment

The MCP server is deployed as a Cloudflare Worker at `mcp.getengram.app`. Deploy with:
```bash
cd apps/mcp-server
CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=<key> CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=maryjanis@yahoo.com CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN= npx wrangler deploy
```

## Git Workflow

Always use: issue → branch → PR → merge. Never commit directly to main.

## Engram Memory

You have access to Engram as an MCP server. Use it to maintain persistent memory across sessions.

### On session start

Search Engram for context relevant to the current task:

```
search
  query: "<summary of what the user is asking about>"
  limit: 5
```

Include any relevant results in your working context — they contain prior conversations about this project, decisions made, bugs investigated, and user preferences.

### During the session

When significant work is done or important context is established, store it:

```
create_conversation
  title: "<concise description of what was discussed>"
  agent_id: "claude-code"
  tags: [<relevant tags like "engram", "bugfix", "feature", "architecture">]
  metadata: { "project": "engram", "branch": "<current branch if relevant>" }

append_messages
  conversation_id: "<the conversation ID>"
  messages:
    - role: "user"
      content: "<what the user asked>"
    - role: "assistant"
      content: "<what you did and why>"
```

### What to store

- Decisions and their reasoning ("we chose X because Y")
- Bug investigations and resolutions
- User preferences and workflow patterns
- Architecture discussions
- Anything you'd want to remember next session

### What NOT to store

- Routine file reads or searches (these are in git)
- Trivial exchanges ("hello", "thanks")
- Information already in the codebase or git history
