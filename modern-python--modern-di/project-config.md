# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`modern-di` is a **zero-dependency** Python dependency injection framework that wires up object graphs from type annotations, manages lifetimes via hierarchical scopes, and supports both sync and async finalizers. Framework integrations (FastAPI, FastStream, LiteStar, Typer) and the pytest integration (`modern-di-pytest`) live in **separate repositories** and are published as separate PyPI packages.

## Commands

This project uses `just` (task runner) and `uv` (package manager).

```bash
just install      # uv lock --upgrade && uv sync --all-extras --frozen --group lint
just lint         # eof-fixer + ruff format + ruff check --fix + ty check
just lint-ci      # same checks without auto-fixing (used in CI)
just test         # uv run pytest (with coverage by default)
just test-branch  # pytest with branch coverage
```

`just test` passes extra args to pytest:
```bash
just test tests/providers/test_factory.py
just test tests/providers/test_factory.py -k test_name
```

Without `just`:
```bash
uv run ruff format . && uv run ruff check . --fix && uv run ty check
uv run pytest
```

## Architecture

### Scope hierarchy

`Scope` is an `IntEnum` with five levels: `APP=1 → SESSION=2 → REQUEST=3 → ACTION=4 → STEP=5`. Providers are bound to a scope; a provider can only be resolved from a container of the same or deeper (higher int) scope. Trying to resolve a REQUEST-scoped provider from an APP container raises a clear error.

### Container tree

`Container` is the central object. A root container is created with `Container(scope=Scope.APP, groups=[MyGroup])`. Child containers are created via `container.build_child_container(scope=Scope.REQUEST, context={...})`. Child containers share the parent's `providers_registry` and `overrides_registry` but have their own `cache_registry` and `context_registry`.

Pass `validate=True` to run cycle detection on the provider graph at container creation time (zero cost when disabled). Can also be called explicitly via `container.validate()`.

### Group and Provider declaration

`Group` is a namespace class (cannot be instantiated) used to declare providers as class-level attributes:

```python
class MyGroup(Group):
    my_service = providers.Factory(scope=Scope.APP, creator=MyService)
```

`Factory` parses the `creator`'s `__init__` type hints at declaration time via `types_parser.parse_creator()`. During resolution it looks up each parameter type in `providers_registry` and recursively resolves dependencies. There is no separate `Singleton` class — singleton behavior is `Factory(cache_settings=CacheSettings())`. Pass `kwargs={}` to supply static arguments that bypass type-based resolution. Pass `skip_creator_parsing=True` for callables whose signatures cannot be introspected.

`ContextProvider` is for runtime values injected at container creation time (e.g. a request object). `container_provider` is an auto-registered singleton that resolves to the `Container` itself.

### Resolution flow

1. `container.resolve(SomeType)` → looks up type in `providers_registry` → calls `resolve_provider(provider)`
2. `resolve_provider` checks `overrides_registry` first (returns override immediately if found)
3. Finds the container at the correct scope via `find_container(scope)` walking the parent chain
4. Checks `cache_registry`; if cached, returns immediately
5. Compiles kwargs: for each parsed parameter, finds a matching provider by type and resolves it recursively
6. Calls the creator, stores result in cache if `cache_settings` configured

### Registries

| Registry | Shared? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ProvidersRegistry` | Shared across all containers | type → provider mapping |
| `CacheRegistry` | Per-container | provider_id → cached instance |
| `ContextRegistry` | Per-container | type → runtime context object |
| `OverridesRegistry` | Shared across all containers | provider_id → override object (for testing) |

### Key files

- `modern_di/container.py` — Container class, the main entry point
- `modern_di/providers/factory.py` — Factory and CacheSettings (singleton pattern via caching + optional finalizer)
- `modern_di/providers/context_provider.py` — ContextProvider for runtime-injected values
- `modern_di/providers/container_provider.py` — auto-registered provider that resolves to the Container itself
- `modern_di/types_parser.py` — Signature introspection engine (parses type hints for DI wiring)
- `modern_di/scope.py` — Scope enum
- `modern_di/group.py` — Group base class for provider namespaces
- `modern_di/errors.py` — Error message templates

### Testing patterns

- Create a `Group` subclass with providers as class attributes, pass to `Container(groups=[...])`
- Use `container.resolve_provider(provider)` (by reference) or `container.resolve(SomeType)` (by type)
- For overrides: `container.override(provider, mock_obj)` / `container.reset_override(provider)`
- For scope chain tests: `app_container.build_child_container(scope=Scope.REQUEST)`
- `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pytest config — async test functions work without extra markers
