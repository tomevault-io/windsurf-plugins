# ERROR FIXING PROCESS
Study the code, the logs and the context (related files, code blocks, etc). 
If clear, fix the issue and send the fixed code.
If not clear, 2 options:
  1. Add logs and ask user to run and send the logs.
  2. Ask user for more information.

# Our .env variables
.env
.env.sample

COMMENTS:
  - Make sure to ALWAYS add comments to the code. Simple and short.
  - Do not delete comments unless they are no longer needed or are outdated.


IMPORTANT: 
  - Understand the entire context of the project.
  - When working on a file or a part of the code, understand the related files and code. 
  - Follow best practices for the code, like DRY, SOLID, KISS, YAGNI. Keep the code modular and easy to understand.
  This means, the other code that this one calls, the code that calls this one and so on, api call codes...
