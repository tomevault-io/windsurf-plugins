# VibeCoding Agent Guide

This file is for AI agents working in this repository. Keep changes aligned with the current codebase and prefer concise, minimal edits.

## Project Snapshot

- Language: Go
- UI: Bubble Tea + Lipgloss
- CLI: Cobra
- Default working style: terminal-first, tool-driven
- Main purpose: a terminal AI coding assistant with provider abstraction, sessions, tools, sandboxing, context files, skills, and unified serve mode

## Important Directories

- `cmd/mothx/` — CLI entry
- `internal/agent/` — agent loop, events, system prompt
- `internal/config/` — settings and defaults
- `internal/context/` — context window and compaction
- `internal/contextfiles/` — `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` discovery
- `internal/memory/` — persistent memory (memory.md)
- `internal/messaging/` — messaging platform abstraction (wechat, feishu)
- `internal/provider/` — provider abstraction and implementations
- `internal/provider/factory/` — shared provider/model construction from config
- `internal/provider/vendor*.go` — vendor adapter registry and per-vendor defaults
- `internal/sandbox/` — sandbox backends
- `internal/session/` — SQLite session storage, schema migrations
- `internal/skills/` — skills loading
- `internal/stats/` — usage stats web dashboard
- `internal/tools/` — built-in tools
- `internal/tui/` — terminal UI
- `internal/acp/` — ACP / MCP related integration
- `internal/a2a/` — A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol server and master mode
- `internal/serve/` — unified server mode: OpenAI-compatible API, Web UI, channels, cron, memory, settings APIs
- `internal/serve/openaiapi/` — OpenAI-compatible HTTP API runtime used by serve
- `internal/serve/channels/` — WeChat/Feishu/WebSocket channel dispatcher used by serve
- `internal/serve/ws/` — serve WebSocket channel runtime
- `docs/` — documentation

## Architecture Notes

- Providers stream responses through the provider abstraction.
- Provider creation should go through `internal/provider/factory` so CLI and ACP keep the same behavior.
- Vendor-specific behavior belongs in `internal/provider/vendor*.go` adapters and model `compat` flags, not in CLI/ACP wiring.
- Each vendor that needs detection or defaults should have a separate `internal/provider/vendor_<name>.go` file.
- Vendors without special behavior should fall back to the generic OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible provider based on `api` / base URL detection.
- Do not change the settings JSON schema or the expected meaning of existing provider config fields when adding vendor support.
- The agent loop builds a system prompt, sends messages, handles stream events, executes tools, and continues until completion.
- Tools should stay stateless when possible; shared execution state belongs in registries/managers.
- Context files and skills are first-class prompt inputs.
- Sessions are stored in SQLite with parent/child relationships. CLI and serve API sessions use a single root `sessions.db` database with dynamically computed virtual `.db` paths for listing/switching; serve channels additionally write physical handle files in per-user channel directories on disk.
- Schema migrations are managed via `internal/session/migrations.go`. A `schema_migrations` table tracks which migrations have been applied. `ApplyMigrations(db)` runs any pending migrations and is called on every DB open from both `session.withDB()` and `stats.Open()`. To add a schema change, append a new entry to the `migrations` slice — do not use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` directly in new code.

### Settings Configuration

- `settings.json` schema lives in `internal/config/settings.go`. Do not change existing field meanings when adding UI or provider behavior.
- TUI `/settings` is the central editor for top-level `settings.json` groups. Provider/model configuration is one branch under that menu, not the whole command.
- When writing a global top-level setting from the TUI, prefer `config.SaveGlobalSettingsPatch()` so only the affected JSON key is updated. Do not save a sparse `Settings` object with `SaveGlobalSettings()` for top-level edits, because non-`omitempty` struct fields can expand defaults and accidentally override unset config.
- `/settings` provider edits should not change `defaultProvider` / `defaultModel` by default. Use the Defaults picker or an explicit "Set as Default" path for default model changes.
- Approval bash whitelist/blacklist entries are command prefixes; trailing spaces can be meaningful (for example `go `). Preserve them and avoid comma-based trimming when editing those lists.

### API Mode

- `internal/serve/openaiapi/` implements the OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API used by `mothx serve`.
- The API runtime reuses the same agent loop, provider factory, session, tools, sandbox, and skills as CLI/ACP — no separate agent logic.
- Configuration lives in `serve.json` (global `~/.mothx/serve.json`, project `.mothx/serve.json`), separate from `settings.json`.
- Project-level `.mothx/serve.json` overrides global, same pattern as `.mothx/settings.json`.
- The API runtime supports slash commands (`/clear`, `/mode`, `/compact`, etc.) processed at the HTTP layer without invoking the LLM.
