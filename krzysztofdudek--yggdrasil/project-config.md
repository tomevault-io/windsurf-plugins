# Agent Instructions — Yggdrasil Repository

You work on the Yggdrasil repository: an open-source CLI that provides continuous architecture enforcement for AI-assisted development. This repo both implements Yggdrasil and uses it on itself (dogfooding).

## Context — Where Things Live

| Path                    | Role                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source/cli/`           | Implementation — CLI code.                                                          |
| `.yggdrasil/model/cli/` | Graph — describes intended CLI architecture. Aspects enforce rules on source code.  |
| `docs/`                 | User docs — for adopters.                                                           |
| `.plans/`               | Agent working dir — design docs and implementation plans. **Ignore skill paths** (e.g. `docs/plans/`) — always use `<root>/.plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` and `.plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md`. Gitignored; not committed. |

## Product Scope

`rules.ts` and `agent-rules.md` are consumed by agents in ANY repository that adopts Yggdrasil — not just this one. When editing rules content, examples, or guidance: use domain-neutral examples (no Yggdrasil-specific types or commands). Think "what would help an agent working on an e-commerce app or a mobile game?" not "what would help an agent working on this CLI."

## Constraints

- Never edit generated rules (platform-specific rules files, or the Yggdrasil section in `AGENTS.md`). To change the rules content: edit `source/cli/src/templates/rules.ts` (content) or `source/cli/src/templates/platform.ts` (frontmatter), then build and regenerate: `node source/cli/dist/bin.js init --upgrade --platform claude-code`. **Always regenerate after changing rules.ts** — this repo dogfoods Yggdrasil, so stale rules mean the agent operating on this repo uses outdated instructions.
- **Ignore generated rules files** for understanding: `.yggdrasil/agent-rules.md`, `.cursor/rules/yggdrasil.mdc`, etc. are auto-generated output. Never read or search them. The source of truth for rules content is `source/cli/src/templates/rules.ts`.
- **Always reflect changes in corresponding documentation.** When modifying code behavior, algorithms, or data structures, identify and update all documentation that describes the changed behavior — `docs/` (user docs) and `.yggdrasil/` (graph metadata). Changes to behavior are not complete until every document describing that behavior is consistent.
- **NEVER run `yg init` from a subdirectory.** Always run from the repository root. Running from `source/cli/` or any subdirectory creates a new `.yggdrasil/` there or corrupts the project config. Use `node source/cli/dist/bin.js` for local builds, not `npx yg` (which may use a cached global version).

## Adding Support for a New Agent

To add a new platform (e.g. a new IDE or agent): add it to `source/cli/src/templates/platform.ts` — implement `installFor<Platform>` to write the rules file to the agent's expected location.

## Version Bump & Changelog

- **Changelog is always updated.** Every code or behavior change gets an entry under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`. This happens as part of normal work — do not wait for a release.
- **Version bumps only on explicit user request.** Never bump the version in `source/cli/package.json` unless the user explicitly asks for a release. When they do:
  1. Bump version (patch/minor/major per [semver](https://semver.org/)).
  2. Run `npm install` in `source/cli/` to update `package-lock.json`.
  3. Move current version entries to a release section in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## CLI Message Design Principle

Every diagnostic message the CLI outputs to an agent must follow the **what / why / next** structure:

- **WHAT** happened — facts, one line or short block
- **WHY** it's a problem — context the agent needs to understand the situation
- **NEXT** — concrete command or instruction to resolve

Use `buildIssueMessage({ what, why, next })` from `source/cli/src/formatters/message-builder.ts` for all error/warning messages in validator, check, approve, and build-context. The builder enforces the structure; the caller handles presentation (indentation, error code prefix).

This applies to CLI output only. Rules.ts (system prompt) provides the map — workflow, vocabulary, categories. CLI provides the GPS — specific errors, next commands. They share vocabulary but never duplicate information.

## Quality Gate

**ALWAYS run `scripts/repo-check.sh` from repo root before ANY commit and ensure it passes cleanly.** Do not commit with failing checks. This is non-negotiable — every commit must leave the repo in a green state. The script runs typecheck, lint, build, tests with coverage, docs build, markdown lint, and `yg check` in sequence. Do not run these individually before committing — `repo-check.sh` covers everything.

## When Evaluating `yg check` or `scripts/repo-check.sh`

Consider both:

1. **Product** — Is the command correct and useful for adopters?
2. **Dogfood** — Is this repo's graph coverage mature enough? Gaps are expected.
