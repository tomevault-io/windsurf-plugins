# CLAUDE.md — Mithlayn Project System Prompt

You are building **Mithlayn** (mithlayn.com), a scholarly web application for studying the *mutashābihāt* (similar/repeated verses) of the Qurʾān, backed by classical Islamic scholarship.

Read this file completely before every session. No exceptions.

## Project Identity

**Name:** Mithlayn (مثلين) — Arabic for "two similars"  
**Mission:** Make Quranic mutashābihāt study accessible and beautiful. Scholarly depth, not superficial decoration.  
**Users:** Muslims serious about Qurān study — ḥuffāẓ (memorizers), students of tafsīr, Arabic learners.

## Design Mandate — The Anti-AI-Look Rule

Every frontend decision must pass this test: **Does this look like it was designed by a human who cares deeply about this subject, or does it look like AI output?**

### What to avoid (generic AI output):
- Hero sections with gradient blobs and floating cards
- Everything centered with too much padding
- Generic sans-serif at 16px with `#6b7280` subtext
- Rounded pill buttons with shadow hover effects everywhere
- Stock icon libraries used decorously
- Section headers like "Why Choose Mithlayn?" or "Features"
- Animations that serve no purpose beyond looking "dynamic"

### What to aim for (Apple/Linear/Vercel standard):
- One idea per screen section — ruthless whitespace
- Typography does the visual work — size contrast, weight, tracking
- Color used sparingly and with purpose — not as decoration
- Interaction that feels inevitable, not surprising
- Arabic text treated with the same care as English — it is the primary text
- The interface should feel like it was printed — precise, considered, not fluid

### Reference sites (spirit, not literal clone):
- apple.com — restraint, hierarchy, one thing at a time
- linear.app — dark product aesthetic, surgical grid
- vercel.com — monochrome confidence
- quran.com — Arabic text handling as a model (not the design)

## Always invoke the frontend-design skill first

Before writing **any** frontend code in a session:

```
invoke the frontend-design skill
```

No exceptions. This applies to: new pages, component additions, CSS changes, layout work.

---

## Screenshot workflow

After building or modifying any visual:
1. Start local server: `npx serve . -l 3000` (or `python3 -m http.server 3000`)
2. Take a full-page screenshot of the affected page
3. Compare against the design mandate above
4. Fix issues silently — do not ask permission for obvious improvements
5. For animated/dynamic elements, skip screenshot comparison and note this

Store screenshots in `temp-screenshots/`. Clear this folder at start of each session.

Do NOT take excessive screenshots. One full-page pass per major change is enough.

## CSS rules

- All values use `var()` from `tokens.css` — no hardcoded colors or sizes in component CSS
- Two themes: `html[data-theme="dark"]` (Cosmic Cliffs palette) and `html[data-theme="light"]` (Mushaf Cream)
- Theme is set on `<html>` element, persisted to `localStorage['mithlayn.theme']`
- Settings values from `localStorage['mithlayn.settings.v2']` override tokens at runtime
- Mobile-first breakpoints: base = mobile, `@media (min-width: 768px)` = tablet+
- Arabic text: always `font-family: var(--font-arabic)` (Amiri), `direction: rtl`
