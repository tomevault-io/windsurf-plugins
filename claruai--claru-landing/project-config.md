## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Hydration Safety
```typescript
// page.tsx - prevents SSR mismatches
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);
if (!mounted) return null;
```

### 2. Dynamic Imports
Heavy effects only load on client:
```typescript
const ASCIIBackground = dynamic(
  () => import("./components/effects/ASCIIBackground"),
  { ssr: false }
);
```

### 3. Animation Stack
- **Framer Motion**: Component-level declarative animations
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger**: Scroll-linked timeline animations
- **Lenis**: Physics-based smooth scrolling

### 4. Form Architecture
- Progressive terminal-style form (6 steps)
- Zod schema validation with React Hook Form
- Real-time validation, typewriter prompts

---

## Design System (globals.css)

### Colors
```css
--bg-primary: #050505;        /* Near-black */
--accent-primary: #00ff88;    /* Electric green */
--text-primary: #e8e8e8;      /* Off-white */
```

### Animation Keyframes
- `fadeUp`, `glitch-1/2`, `scanline`, `chromatic-shift`, `typewriter`, `flicker`

### Semantic Classes
- `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary` - Buttons
- `.card` - Dark card with border
- `.input-terminal` - Form inputs
- `.section`, `.container` - Layout

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Canvas rendering** for ASCII/particle effects (not DOM)
2. **FPS throttling** - ASCII background limited to 20 FPS
3. **Debounced resize** handlers
4. **CSS-only effects** for noise/vignette overlays
5. **GPU-friendly animations** (transform, opacity)

---

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev     # Development server (port 3000)
npm run build   # Production build
npm run start   # Production server
npm run lint    # ESLint
```

---

## TODOs

- [ ] Form submission backend (`ContactForm.tsx:217` - currently logs to console)
- [ ] Add unit/E2E tests (Jest, Playwright)
- [ ] Visual regression tests for animations

## Page Flow

```

├── Header (Sticky Nav)
└── Main
    ├── Hero (Logo, CTAs, ParticleField)
    ├── Wedge (Offering Cards)
    ├── ParadigmShift (Comparison)
    ├── Capabilities (Services)
    ├── Testimonials (Social Proof)
    ├── FinalCTA (Contact Form)
    └── Footer
```

## Working Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Leverage available tools
Before starting any task, check what agents, skills, and MCPs are available. Use specialized agents (frontend-expert, nextjs-expert, supabase-expert, code-reviewer, web-research-specialist) for their domains. Use MCP tools (Playwright for browser testing, context7 for package docs, Codex for code review). Don't do everything manually when a tool exists.

### 2. End-user UAT testing only
Test as a real user would — through the browser, with real credentials, following real flows. No admin shortcuts, no direct DB queries to verify behavior, no service role workarounds. If a user can't do it, the test isn't valid. Use Playwright MCP for automated UAT.

### 3. Read the docs before debugging
When debugging package issues, use context7 MCP to read up-to-date documentation. Use web search to find if others have solved the same issue (GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, forums). Don't guess at API contracts. Use `npx opensrc <gh_repo>` to download the code for any open source package so you can see how it works.

### 4. Parallelize aggressively
When multiple independent tasks exist, launch background agents in parallel. Don't serialize work that can run concurrently. Examples: multiple extractor migrations, independent UI components, research + implementation.

### 5. Comprehensive testing
Always set up: Vitest unit tests for core logic, integration tests for cross-module behavior, smoke tests for service health and schema validation, pipeline verification tests for end-to-end data flow, Playwright E2E tests for user-facing flows.

### 6. Seed data for testing
Maintain seed scripts (`scripts/seed-uat.ts`) with realistic test data that covers all UI states. Ask for API keys upfront. Seed data should be idempotent (running twice doesn't create duplicates).

### 7. Never bypass failures
Do NOT work around broken things by triggering manually or making direct DB queries. Understand WHY it failed, read the code path, check logs/DB/service health, fix the root cause, verify through normal user flow, add a regression test.

### 8. Agent architecture
Massive system prompts are bad news. Build parent-agent/sub-agent architecture (multi-agent orchestration). If the agent SDK doesn't support this, research the best architecture for the goal.

### 9. Pipeline Development
When building any AI pipeline or workflow: build it yourself first as an AI agent with Bash access and all available tools/agents/skills/MCPs. As each phase works, document how it would work deployed in production standalone (web app, mac app, etc).

### 10. Remote git branches
**NEVER push to remote without explicit human approval.** Free to do local git operations as needed. Always test via Playwright/browser verification BEFORE asking to push.
