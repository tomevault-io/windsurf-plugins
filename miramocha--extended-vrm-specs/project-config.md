description: How to author Extended VRM specs, ADRs, and schema docs

# Specs documentation

This repository holds Extended VRM specifications and related design decisions.
Prefer clarity for implementers over essay voice.

## Normative writing

- Separate **requirements** from **rationale** and **examples**. Label examples as non-normative.
- Prefer concrete field names, types, units, defaults, and version bounds over adjectives.
- Use consistent requirement strength (MUST / SHOULD / MAY, or an equivalent house convention).
  Do not mix soft marketing language into normative sections.
- State compatibility explicitly: which VRM/glTF versions, packages, or tools a change targets.
- When a requirement is undecided, write `TBD` or `[ADD: …]` — do not invent a decision.

## Audience

Separate **implementer / product** prose from **repo maintainer / agent** process.

| Audience | Belongs in | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Spec readers, tool authors, consumers | `specs/`, `decisions/`, `implementations/`, `references/` | Field rules, catalog schema, vendor paths, UI policy (`common: true`) |
| Specs maintainers and Cursor agents | `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/skills/`, optional `references/**/maintaining-*.md` | Regen scripts, same-PR sync habits, deslop triggers, skill workflows |

- Do **not** put `.cursor/**` paths in normative specs or in family/reference notes aimed at
  implementers. Point those notes at a `maintaining-*.md` page (or the skill) instead.
- Do **not** move product authoring policy (how tools use catalogs, morph layers, etc.) into
  Cursor rules — tools still need that in the vault.
- Agent-only steps that already live in a skill (e.g. `unity-shader-catalog`) stay in the
  skill; the maintaining page is the human-facing index when one is needed.

Materials-override catalog regen: [Maintaining catalogs](../../references/catalogs/maintaining-catalogs.md)
and skill `unity-shader-catalog`.

When adding or changing a shipping **editor** host: update the capability matrix in
[VRMXT Editor](../../implementations/vrmxt-editor.md) and the Architecture authoring
host table. Prefer the host profile for per-host detail; keep this matrix aligned.

## Structure

- Format authored notes for Obsidian using `obsidian-markdown.mdc`, including YAML
  properties and controlled tags.
- One concern per document when practical. Link related specs instead of duplicating rules.
- Keep headings scannable: purpose, scope, normative text, data model / schema, examples,
  compatibility, open questions.
- Prefer tables for fields, enums, and matrices. Prefer diagrams only when they clarify
  relationships that prose would bury.
- When a diagram is needed, use a fenced **Mermaid** block (` ```mermaid `). Do not use
  ASCII art boxes, arrows, or trees for flow, sequence, state, or relationship diagrams.
  Keep node/edge labels short and stable; prefer `flowchart`, `sequenceDiagram`,
  `stateDiagram-v2`, or `classDiagram` over decorative layouts.
- Preserve stable anchors and filenames once published; renames need intentional migration.

## File placement

- Put family-wide normative contracts that are not glTF extensions in `specs/core/`.
- Put reusable normative schema fragments with no independent `extensionsUsed` identity
  in `specs/fragments/`.
- Put concrete glTF extension specs in `specs/extensions/<domain>/`. Current domains are
  `animation`, `deformation`, `materials`, `physics`, and `vfx`.
- Do not place a concrete extension spec directly under `specs/`.
- Folder names are editorial taxonomy. They MUST NOT add a segment to the serialized
  extension name: `specs/extensions/vfx/vrmxt-sprite-particle.md` defines
  `VRMXT_sprite_particle`.
- Add every new normative document to the registry in `README.md`.
- Keep decisions, implementation profiles, and research in `decisions/`,
  `implementations/`, and `references/`.

## Accuracy and provenance

- Do not invent citations to VRM, glTF, UniVRM, or Blender docs. Link real sections or mark
  placeholders.
- Distinguish Extended VRM extensions from upstream VRM/glTF behavior.
- Record breaking changes and migration notes when changing published fields or semantics.
- Match identifiers used in Extended-UniVRM and Extended-VRM-Addon-for-Blender when those
  names already exist; do not invent parallel names for the same concept.

## Related

- Voice / AI-tell cleanup: `deslop-markdown.mdc` and the **deslop** skill.
- Note metadata and vault conventions: `obsidian-markdown.mdc`.
- Repo handoff: `handoff-and-git.mdc`.
