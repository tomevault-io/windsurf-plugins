# Extended-VRM-Specs repository

- This repo is for **specifications and design decisions** for Extended VRM — not Unity
  package source and not the Blender add-on implementation.
- Prefer documenting behavior, schemas, compatibility, and migration rules that UniVRM and
  the Blender add-on can implement consistently.
- Do not invent product scope, version history, or upstream VRM/glTF requirements.
- Keep implementation details in the owning code repos unless the spec needs them to be
  normative.
- When naming concepts, reuse identifiers already established in Extended-UniVRM or
  Extended-VRM-Addon-for-Blender when those exist.
- Treat repository standards as **unreleased drafts** unless a note explicitly states
  otherwise. Do not constrain draft design around a hypothetical v1, release phase, or
  post-release compatibility. Do not defer needed draft design to a later release without
  explicit direction. Existing `specVersion` values describe draft schema revisions, not
  released standards.
