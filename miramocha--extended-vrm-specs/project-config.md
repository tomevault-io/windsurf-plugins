description: Safe verification and git handoff for Extended-VRM-Specs
---


# Handoff and git

- Before handoff, inspect `git diff` and verify only task-scoped files changed.
- After drafting or materially editing markdown prose, run **deslop** per
  `deslop-markdown.mdc` on changed narrative sections.
- For new or materially restructured notes, verify Obsidian properties, controlled tags,
  heading order, and links against `obsidian-markdown.mdc`.
- Check specs against `specs-documentation.mdc`: normative vs example, stable names,
  real citations, no invented decisions, Mermaid over ASCII diagrams.
- Prefer small, reviewable doc diffs. Avoid unrelated rewrites of published specs.
- Report checks actually run and any verification not run.
- Never commit unless explicitly asked. Never push unless explicitly asked.
- Do not update git config, skip hooks, force-push, hard-reset, or discard user changes.
- Review diffs for accuracy and implementability first; style nits second.
