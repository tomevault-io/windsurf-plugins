description: Run deslop pass on authored markdown prose before handoff

# Deslop markdown

Authority: [deslop skill](../skills/deslop/SKILL.md), [tells catalog](../skills/deslop/references/tells.md), [register guide](../skills/deslop/references/voices.md).

## When to run

After you **draft or materially edit prose** in a `.md` file (specs, ADRs, README narrative, issue/PR bodies saved as markdown), **before handoff or commit**:

1. Read and follow **deslop** — Phase 0 (genre/register) → Phase 1 scan → Phase 2 rewrite → Phase 3 verify loop → Phase 4 register check.
2. Apply fixes to the **changed sections** (or full doc if you rewrote most of it).
3. Deliver a brief change log when the user asked for a deslop pass or the edit was agent-authored publishable prose.

## Skip (do not deslop)

| Case | Why |
|------|-----|
| Link-only, heading moves, anchor fixes | No prose change |
| Typo / single-word fix in otherwise human text | Noise |
| Mechanical tables (IDs, field lists, checkboxes, schema tables with no narrative) | Structure, not voice |
| Normative keyword / enum / path renames only | Spec precision, not voice |
| User explicitly asked to keep wording | Respect intent |
| Editing `.cursor/skills/**/SKILL.md` or agent instructions | Meta; don't loop-deslop the deslop skill |

## Genre defaults (Extended-VRM-Specs)

| Path | Register |
|------|----------|
| Specs, extensions, schema docs, `decisions/**` / ADRs | Technical specification — precise claims, no puffery |
| Root `README.md`, contributor/setup docs | Technical docs — imperative where appropriate |
| Design notes / rationale essays | Essay / technical docs — commit to claims; no marketing voice |

## Triggers

User says **deslop**, **de-slop**, `/deslop`, **remove AI tells**, or **humanize** — run the full skill on the named file or selection.

## Do not

- Invent facts, citations, or specifics to sound human — use `[ADD: …]` placeholders per skill.
- Replace locked IDs, schema names, field names, or version numbers with vaguer wording.
- Trade technical precision for casual voice in specifications.
