# AGENTS.md - YouTrackDB Project Guide

## Project Overview

YouTrackDB is a general-purpose object-oriented graph database developed by JetBrains, used internally in production. It implements the Apache TinkerPop API with Gremlin query language support and features O(1) link traversal, schema-less/mixed/full modes, and encryption at rest. The project is a fork of OrientDB, re-architected under the `com.jetbrains.youtrackdb` package namespace.

## Project Documentation

The `docs/` folder contains user-facing product documentation. See `docs/README.md` for the index. Project-internal documentation (development workflow, role guidelines, ADR archive) lives in `docs-internal/` — see `docs-internal/README.md` for the index.

## Architecture

Storage engine, Gremlin integration, RID format, generated code pipeline, and the table of key entry-point classes (`YourTracks`, `YouTrackDB`, `ServerMain`, `GlobalConfiguration`, `DiskStorage`, `AbstractStorage`, etc.) are documented in `.claude/docs/architecture.md`. Load on demand when the change actually touches storage / Gremlin / parser / generated-code areas.

## Role Guidelines

Role-specific rules live in two documents, keyed by the kind of activity you are about to do:

- **Planning work, choosing verification scope, PR / branch work, reviewing changes for workflow or review discipline, doc-sync duties** → read `docs-internal/agents/orchestrator-guidelines.md` (track-based workflow, test policy, pre-commit verification rules, git conventions, documentation sync).
- **Writing, editing, or reviewing code (style and test rules), running builds / tests / formatting, committing, hands-on codebase navigation** → read `docs-internal/agents/thread-guidelines.md` (build commands, code style, testing, committing, codebase tips).

The slate extension — installed from the `ytdb-slate` npm package pinned in `.pi/settings.json` — injects these documents automatically per role (orchestrator vs worker thread). The package also ships the generic track-based workflow protocol (track-workflow.md, pr-publishing.md), cited by absolute path in the orchestrator doctrine; YTDB-specific workflow deltas live in `docs-internal/dev-workflow/track-development.md`. Any agent whose prompt does not already include the relevant document must read it on demand before doing that kind of work.

### Load Guidance Documents on Demand

When designing agent guidance in this repo (e.g., the slate doctrine additions or review-perspective charters in `docs-internal/agents/`), load guidance/rules documents on demand instead of injecting them into every prompt. Keep the always-loaded surface to a short pointer naming the trigger condition and the document path.
