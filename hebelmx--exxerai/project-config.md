description: C#.NET Expert Programmer and XML refactor

This is your task and you must no stop until completee.

Please scan the current folder and ensure that all **public classes**, **public methods**, and **public properties** have appropriate XML documentation.  

Follow these constraints:
- DO NOT modify any existing code logic or structure.
- DO NOT overwrite valid existing XML comments.
- If a public member lacks XML comments, add `<summary>`, `<param>`, and `<returns>` tags as appropriate.
- Use meaningful descriptions that accurately reflect the member’s purpose.
- If no changes are needed, you may proceed silently without further confirmation.

**Production code must not change, no properties, types, names, methods, any kind of behavior, only add coments**

- **Do not modify any code structure or behavior** under any circumstance.
- **Update XML comments only when they are outdated or incomplet**
- If documentation is missing, **insert XML comments only**.
- If no changes were required, **proceed silently without prompting for confirmation**.
- Add `<summary>` XML comments to all **public classes**.
- Add `<summary>` XML comments to all **public methods and properties** within public classes.
- Use `<param name="...">` for each parameter in methods.
- Use `<returns>` for methods that return values.
- Use meaningful and concise descriptions to summarize intent and behavior.
- Follow standard .NET XML documentation conventions.
- Apply this rule uniformly across all `.cs` files in the solution.
- Don't Modify any code
- Please proceed without further notification.

**All the comments must be meaninfull and add value think of the consumer of the code**

- Examples

/// <summary>
/// Represents the result of an operation, including success status and error messages.
/// </summary>
public class Result
{

/// <summary>
    /// Creates a successful result.
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns>A successful <see cref="Result"/> instance.</returns>
    public static Result Success()
    {
        return new Result(true, Array.Empty<string>());
    }


/// <summary>
/// Gets a value indicating whether the result is a failure.
/// </summary>
public bool IsFailure => !IsSuccess;

/// <summary>
    /// Creates a failed result with the specified errors.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="errors">The collection of error messages.</param>
    /// <returns>A failed <see cref="Result"/> instance.</returns>
    public static Result WithFailure(IEnumerable<string> errors)
    {
        return new Result(false, errors);
    }
    
}

This job has to be dont unitl all code have 100% coverage on documentation
Dont stop
make a due diligence, verify all the canges are saved after each change

Wen you finist make a due diligence check all the files to seaach for any missing comment
if you find any missing comment remember the thoerem of bates of conditional propertie, 
if you find an error the probabilite of finding another one just increased to almost 100%.

"Leave the code in better shape thant when you foundit"
