### Monorepo jobs guide (pnpm + turbo)

This repository is a pnpm workspace orchestrated by Turbo.

### Conventions for the assistant

- Always run from the repo root so workspace and Turbo resolution work correctly
- Prefer Turbo filters for cross-package orchestration
- Usually `pnpm dev` is already running in the background, prefer to skip

### Core workspace commands

```bash
# Build everything
pnpm build

# Type-check everything
pnpm check-types

# Lint everything
pnpm lint

# Run tests across all projects
pnpm test

# Watch tests across all projects
pnpm test:watch

# Start all dev tasks (persistent; Turbo runs them in parallel).
pnpm dev

# Install deps (package or app)
pnpm -F al-formo add <package>

# Install deps (root)
pnpm --workspace-root add -D <package>
```

### Targeting specific packages

Use Turbo filters to scope tasks.

```bash
# Library: packages/al-formo
pnpm build -F al-formo
pnpm dev -F al-formo

# App: apps/dev-app
pnpm build -F dev-app
pnpm dev -F dev-app

# Service: apps/fake-server
pnpm dev -F fake-server
```

### Tests: run a subset

The root Vitest config defines projects for `packages/*` and `apps/*`.

```bash
# Run tests only for the library
pnpm test --project al-formo
```
