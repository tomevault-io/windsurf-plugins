# OpenProxy — Rust AI Proxy Router

## What
OpenProxy is an AI proxy router written in Rust — OpenAI-compatible endpoint that routes requests to 40+ AI providers with format translation, account fallback, token refresh, usage tracking, and SSE streaming.

## Why
Replace 9router (Node.js) with a faster, safer Rust implementation that avoids 235+ bugs found in the JS version. Critical patterns: type-safe format handling, encrypted secrets, immutable data flow, thread-safe by design.

## How (Architecture)
- **Core**: model parsing → format detection → request translation → provider execution → response translation → SSE streaming
- **Account mgmt**: credential selection → token refresh → model-level fallback → combo/fusion
- **Executor trait**: `ProviderExecutor` with default+specialized impls
- **Persistence**: SQLite WAL + encrypted columns + usage tracking
- **Security**: HMAC API keys, bcrypt auth, SSRF protection

## Beads
23 beads in `.beads/` organized across 7 phases. See `bv --robot-next` or `br ready` for actionable items.

## Key References
- `9router-audit-plan.md` — full plan with 9router bugs avoided per bead
- 9router repo at `/tmp/9router` for reference implementation (do NOT copy JS patterns directly)

## Status
Phase 1-6 planned, no implementation started yet. Start with `bv --robot-next`.

## Schema stability (`openproxy.v1.*`)

The `openproxy.v1.*` envelope namespace is a **frozen, additive-only contract**. Every JSON envelope emitted by `--robot` carries a `schema` field matching `openproxy.v1.<area>.<action>`. Existing fields keep their names, types, and meanings across releases. New fields are additive only — no renames or removals. A new `openproxy.v2.*` namespace will be opened before any breaking change.

Run `openproxy schema stability` to see the current stability promise:

```bash
openproxy --robot schema stability
# → {"schema":"openproxy.v1.schema.stability","data":{"namespace":"openproxy.v1","stability":"stable","policy":"..."}}
```

The `schema` subcommand provides four operations:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `openproxy schema list` | List all resource kinds with schema and example support |
| `openproxy schema show <resource>` | Print JSON Schema for a resource (provider, key, combo, etc.) |
| `openproxy schema example <resource>` | Print an example payload for a resource |
| `openproxy schema stability` | Print the v1 namespace stability contract |

13 resources are covered: `provider`, `provider-node`, `combo`, `key`, `pool`, `settings`, `custom-model`, `model-alias`, `usage-event`, `log-event`, `chat-event`, `quota`, `oauth-status`. Each has both a schema and an example — enforced by tests.
