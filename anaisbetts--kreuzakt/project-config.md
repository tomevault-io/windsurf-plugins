Every code file must follow a strict top-to-bottom ordering that reflects a "newspaper" hierarchy — the headline goes first, the fine print goes last. A reader skimming from line 1 should immediately understand what this file is about, and should only encounter supporting details as they scroll further.

Required ordering

Imports — external dependencies first, then internal/relative imports, separated by a blank line.
Constants — module-level configuration, magic numbers pulled into named values, environment lookups, default values.
Types and Interfaces — type aliases, interfaces, enums, Zod schemas, or any shape definitions that the rest of the file depends on.
Primary export / "headline" — the single class, function, or component that defines why this file exists. If someone reads only this, they should understand the file's purpose. This is the thing the filename describes.
Supporting actors — secondary classes, functions, or components that the headline depends on or that extend it. Ordered by relevance to the headline, most related first.
Utilities and helpers — pure functions, formatters, validators, mappers, and anything that could plausibly live in a utils/ file but is only used here. These are the least thematically central items.

Why this matters

Readability: new contributors orient themselves in seconds, not minutes.
Code review: reviewers see intent before implementation details.
Merge conflicts: keeping a consistent structure means different authors' changes land in predictable zones.

When you're unsure where something belongs
Ask: "If I deleted everything else in this file, would this item alone still justify the file's name?" If yes, it's the headline. If it supports the headline, it's a supporting actor. If it supports anything generically, it's a utility.
