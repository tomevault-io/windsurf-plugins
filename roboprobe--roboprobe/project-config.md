# RoboProbe Agent Guide

This checkout is **RoboProbe**, a community for evaluating and improving
LLM-as-Policy systems: a language model in the closed-loop action path, plus a
non-learned harness, scored only by the benchmark environment.

Every harness lives in `policy/<HARNESS>/`. The policy server imports it as
`XPolicyLab.policy.<HARNESS>.model`, so this checkout is always used as a
package inside a parent workspace — never as the top-level project. The import
name stays `XPolicyLab` because the harness runtime is XPolicyLab; do not rename
it to match the project name.

- Submission standard: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Reference harness: `policy/RoboDojo_Agent_L3_Inspect_EEF/` — the one with
  published 2100 numbers. Copy it to start a new one.
- Data formats: [docs/data_formats.md](docs/data_formats.md).
- Workspace, drivers and keys: [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

The rules below apply to every change in this repo. Their rationale is in
CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Images are RGB from end to end

`decode_image_bit` and `decode_obs_images` return RGB, and the policy server
hands `update_obs` / `update_obs_batch` RGB. Treat this as settled: do not
re-derive it from the usual "OpenCV returns BGR" rule, which does not apply,
because XPolicyLab buffers are encoded from RGB arrays and `cv2.imencode` /
`cv2.imdecode` carry channels through JPEG in the order they were given. A
`COLOR_BGR2RGB` added to "fix" a decode is always a bug.

The only exception is a medium adapter: `COLOR_RGB2BGR` immediately before
`cv2.VideoWriter.write(...)`, and `COLOR_BGR2RGB` immediately after
`cv2.VideoCapture.read()`.

## Decoding goes through the shared helpers

`model.py` never decodes. The server decodes every observation it forwards,
including for custom RPCs, so `obs["vision"][<camera>]["color"]` is already an
array; harnesses only reshape, cast, resize.

Offline code decodes only with `decode_image_bit` from
`XPolicyLab.utils.process_data`. Never hand-roll `cv2.imdecode` /
`np.frombuffer` / PIL decoding: the legacy RoboDojo image-bit layouts are only
handled correctly by that function. Mechanically, `cv2.imdecode` must not appear
outside `utils/process_data.py`.

## Paths and dimensions come from the shared helpers

`env_cfg/` lives in the **parent workspace, outside this repo** —
`XPolicyLab/env_cfg` does not exist, so a harness must never build that path
itself.

- **Importable root** in `policy/<HARNESS>/model.py` is
  `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`, the parent of the checkout.
  `parents[1]` is the checkout itself and `parents[3]` is unrelated; both are
  bugs.
- **Action dimensions** come from `get_robot_action_dim_info(env_cfg_type)` in
  `XPolicyLab.utils.process_data`, never hard-coded and never through a private
  re-implementation.

## The policy server owns no checkpoint

A harness trains nothing and loads no weights, so its server needs only this
checkout's own dependencies. `deploy.yml` says `policy_uv_env_path: ../..` and
the environment is built with `python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e .`.
Do not point it at another project's virtualenv.

## deploy.yml

`policy_name` must equal the directory name. Keep the full key set from
`policy/RoboDojo_Agent_L3_Inspect_EEF/deploy.yml` — including `protocol: ws`,
`host` and `port` — even where the scripts have a default; per-run fields are
overridden at launch.

## Reported results

The official RoboDojo score is 42 cells × 50 episodes = 2100, and the
Leaderboard Average is the mean of five equally weighted capability dimensions.
Unstable layouts are replaced by buffer ids, so a cell is **not** "layouts 0-49"
and holes in that range do not mean the cell is missing. Selection lives in
`results/selection.py`; comparison in `scripts/compare_robodojo_to_official.py`.
