Project rules for AI assistants:

1) Always answer in English.
2) Do not hardcode user-facing strings.
3) Any user-facing text must go through i18n keys and JSON locale files.
4) Keep copy tone/style consistent with existing app text.
5) For frontend i18n, update both:
   - front/src/locales/en/*.json
   - front/src/locales/es/*.json
6) For backend i18n, update both:
   - back/src/locales/en/**/*.json
   - back/src/locales/es/**/*.json
7) Use yarn commands (not npm/pnpm) when running scripts.
8) Keep TypeScript type/interface declarations in dedicated `*.types.ts` files.
9) In frontend, keep only shared domain-level types in `front/src/types`; colocate feature/component-specific `*.types.ts` files with those files.
10) Keep exactly one React component per `.tsx` file; extract additional components into separate files.
