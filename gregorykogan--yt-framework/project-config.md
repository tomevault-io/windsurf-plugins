description: Use the project Conda env yt-framework for all shell/Python commands; no ad-hoc venvs
---


# Python environment (Conda)

Human-readable setup: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (Development Setup). Environment name: **`yt-framework`**.

## Default for agents

- Run verification and tooling through that env, for example:
  - `conda run -n yt-framework -- <command>`
- Prefer `conda run` so activation hooks are not required. For compound commands from the repo root:
  - `conda run -n yt-framework -- bash -lc '...'`

## Do not

- Create `.venv` / `venv` or run `python -m venv` for routine tests, docs, or formatting unless the user explicitly asks.

## If Conda or the env is missing

- Do not silently fall back to a disposable venv; tell the user to follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- If Conda is available but `yt-framework` does not exist, a one-time setup is acceptable (keep commands aligned with CONTRIBUTING):
  - `conda create -n yt-framework python=3.11 -y`
  - `conda run -n yt-framework -- python -m pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"` (from the repository root; use `python -m pip` so installs target the env, not a system/Homebrew `pip`)

## If Conda is not installed

- State that clearly; do not invent a replacement workflow without user direction.
