# Test authoring and debugging (Angry Tests)

Philosophy is aligned with Yegor Bugayenko’s [Angry Tests](https://www.yegor256.com/angry-tests.html) and related posts: [On the Layout of Tests](https://www.yegor256.com/2023/01/19/layout-of-tests.html), [single-statement / single-assertion tests](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/17/single-statement-unit-tests.html), and [unit testing anti-patterns](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/12/11/unit-testing-anti-patterns.html). Adaptations below are **pytest-specific** for this repo.

Cross-links: proof obligations in [testing.mdc](testing.mdc); Conda commands in [conda-environment.mdc](conda-environment.mdc); general code style in [standards.mdc](standards.mdc).

## Mindset

- Tests are a **safety net**: a test that turns red after a change did its job—it localized a mistake. Fix **production code** or **update the test deliberately** when the contract changed; do not weaken assertions to “make green” without a stated reason.
- Prefer tests that **pinpoint** the broken unit or scenario so the failure message and test name narrow the search space (layout-of-tests).

## Naming and file placement

- Prefer **`tests/test_<module_basename>.py`** mapping to a single primary **system under test** (SUT), e.g. `test_job_command.py` for `yt_framework.operations.job_command`.
- For flows that **do not** map 1:1 to one module, use **`tests/integration/`** (or `tests/it/`) and **scenario-oriented** module names (IT-style), still with clear docstrings.
- Test function names describe **behavior or rule**, not `test1` / `test_foo` (layout-of-tests).

## Assertions (one logical outcome)

- Aim for **one logical outcome per test**: one main `assert`, or one `pytest.raises(...)` block, or one structured equality check. If you need two checks, split the test unless they are inseparable duplicates of the same outcome.
- Use **`match=`** on `pytest.raises` when the message is part of the contract.
- Use **`assert expr, "short reason"`** when the default pytest output would be obscure (layout-of-tests: descriptive failures).

## Structure: Arrange / Act / Assert

- Keep tests **short**. Visible three phases: build inputs → call the API → assert.
- **Shared setup:** Prefer **fake objects** or small factories that live next to production code (or clearly named helpers) over opaque shared fixtures. Avoid “god” fixtures and cross-test coupling ([anti-patterns](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/12/11/unit-testing-anti-patterns.html)).
- If you add **`tests/support/`**, keep helpers **explicit and minimal**; document what SUT they serve.

## Mocks

- Use **`unittest.mock` / `patch` sparingly**. This codebase is YT/S3-heavy: prefer **real pure logic**, **fakes**, **dev-mode** boundaries, or narrow integration tests over mocking large client surfaces unless there is no cheaper option.

## Mandatory fix loop (agents)

When a test fails or you are debugging tests, follow this loop **in order**; do not skip straight to refactors.

1. **Reproduce:** `conda run -n yt-framework -- pytest <path>::<test_name> -xvs` (or `-k` with a unique substring). Confirm the failure is stable.
2. **Read:** Study the **assertion output**, **exception message**, and **traceback top**—identify the failing line in test and production code.
3. **Locate SUT:** Open the production module that owns the behavior; confirm whether the test expectation or the code is wrong.
4. **Hypothesis:** State one sentence: e.g. “Off-by-one in path normalization” or “Test encodes old API.”
5. **Minimal change:** Apply the **smallest** edit that addresses that hypothesis only (standards: root-cause, no drive-by rewrites).
6. **Re-run:** Same single test, then full `conda run -n yt-framework -- pytest`.
7. **If still red:** Do **not** stack unrelated edits. Return to step 2 with fresh output. If the failure is environmental (Conda, missing env), fix the environment or document `--no-verify` only as an emergency (see CONTRIBUTING).

Proof of done: cite pytest output per [testing.mdc](testing.mdc).

## Project conventions

- Run pytest through **`conda run -n yt-framework --`** when verifying locally ([conda-environment.mdc](conda-environment.mdc)).
- Test code: type hints and Black like production ([standards.mdc](standards.mdc)).
