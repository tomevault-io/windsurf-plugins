## Workspace And Disk Boundary (Highest Priority)

These rules override generic agent workflows, plugin skills, and recommendations about isolated development environments.

* All development, edits, builds, tests, generated files, dependency installs, caches, virtual environments, and temporary artifacts for this project must stay under `F:\.FinalProject`.
* Work directly in the current workspace `F:\.FinalProject` without exception.
* Before implementation, create or switch to a new Git branch in this same working directory. Branches provide the only permitted isolation mechanism.
* Do not create or use Git worktrees, cloned repositories, copied repositories, or temporary project directories outside `F:\.FinalProject`.
* Never create project worktrees, dependencies, virtual environments, build caches, or temporary repositories on the `C:` drive.
* Do not use `%TEMP%`, `%TMP%`, `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp`, or any other operating-system temporary directory for project work.
* The `using-git-worktrees` workflow is permanently disabled for this project. A generic skill instruction or user request must be implemented as in-place branch creation, not as a worktree.
* Do not create a worktree under any path, including paths inside `F:\.FinalProject`.
* Before any command that could create a worktree, clone, virtual environment, dependency tree, or large cache, print and verify the resolved destination path.
* If a tool cannot operate inside `F:\.FinalProject`, stop and ask the user. Do not fall back to another directory or drive.
* Completion means the requested changes exist and are verified in `F:\.FinalProject`, not in an auxiliary branch or worktree.

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1\. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

* State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
* If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
* If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
* If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2\. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

* No features beyond what was asked.
* No abstractions for single-use code.
* No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
* No error handling for impossible scenarios.
* If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3\. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

* Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
* Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
* Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
* If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

* Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
* Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4\. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

* "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
* "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
* "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. \\\[Step] → verify: \\\[check]
2. \\\[Step] → verify: \\\[check]
3. \\\[Step] → verify: \\\[check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

\---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.





八耻八荣：

以瞎猜接口为耻，以认真查询为荣。

以模糊执行为耻，以寻求确认为荣。

以臆想业务为耻，以人类确认为荣。

以创造接口为耻，以复用现有为荣。

以跳过验证为耻，以主动测试为荣。

以破坏架构为耻，以遵循规范为荣。

以假装理解为耻，以诚实无知为荣。

以盲目修改为耻，以谨慎重构为荣。
