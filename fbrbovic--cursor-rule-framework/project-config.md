## State
Phase: null 
Status: null  
CurrentItem: null
EpicReference: null
EpicPhase: null
EpicStep: null  

## Plan
<!-- THe AI fills this in during the BLUEPRINT phase -->

## Rules
> **Keep every major section under an explicit H2 (`##`) heading so the agent can locate them unambiguously.**

### [PHASE: ANALYZE]
1. Read **project_config.md**, relevant code & docs.  
2. **Epic Integration Logic**:
   - If user request mentions epic work (e.g., "work on login from user management epic"), search epics.mdc
   - Identify matching epic, phase, and step from user's natural language description
   - Set CurrentItem to descriptive format, and set epic fields:
     - Set `EpicReference = EPIC_NAME` (if found)
     - Set `EpicPhase = PHASE_NAME` (if found)
     - Set `EpicStep = STEP_NAME` (if found)
   - If no epic context found, leave epic fields as null
3. Summarize requirements. *No code or planning.*

### [PHASE: BLUEPRINT]
1. **Architecture Validation**: Read architecture.mdc to understand current architecture and validate planned changes align with existing patterns and decisions.
2. If `EpicReference` exists, read epic context from epics.mdc for step requirements and acceptance criteria.
3. **Architecture Impact Assessment**: Evaluate if planned work requires architectural changes or updates.
4. Decompose task into ordered steps.  
5. Write pseudocode or file-level diff outline under **## Plan**.
6. **Plan Architecture Updates**: Include steps to update architecture.mdc if architectural changes are being made.
7. Set `Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL` and await user confirmation.

### [PHASE: CONSTRUCT]
1. Follow the approved **## Plan** exactly.  
2. After each atomic change:  
   - run test / linter commands specified in `project_config.md`  
   - capture tool output in **## Log**
3. **Architecture Updates**: When implementing architectural changes, update architecture.mdc with new patterns, decisions, or modifications.
4. On success of all steps, set `Phase = VALIDATE`.

### [PHASE: VALIDATE]
1. Rerun full test suite & any E2E checks.  
2. If clean, set `Status = COMPLETED`.  
3. Trigger **RULE_ITERATE_01** when applicable.

---

### RULE_INIT_01
Trigger ▶ `Phase == INIT`  
Action ▶ Ask user for first high-level task → `Phase = ANALYZE, Status = RUNNING`.

### RULE_ITERATE_01
Trigger ▶ `Status == COMPLETED && Items contains unprocessed rows`  
Action ▶  
1. Set `CurrentItem` to next unprocessed row in **## Items**.  
2. Parse epic reference if CurrentItem format is `EPIC_NAME > PHASE_NAME > STEP_NAME`.
3. Clear **## Log**, reset `Phase = ANALYZE, Status = READY`.

### RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01
Trigger ▶ `length(## Log) > 5 000 chars`  
Action ▶ Summarise the top 5 findings from **## Log** into **## ArchiveLog**, then clear **## Log**.

### RULE_EPIC_UPDATE_01
Trigger ▶ `Phase == VALIDATE && Status == COMPLETED && EpicReference != null`
Action ▶
1. Parse EpicReference, EpicPhase, and EpicStep to identify epic location in epics.mdc.
2. Update corresponding epic step status to include completion percentage, date, and notes.
3. Check if all steps in the phase are completed, update phase status accordingly.
4. Add completion entry to epic notes section with timestamp.

### RULE_EPIC_COMPLETION_ARCHIVE_01
Trigger ▶ `Epic Status == COMPLETED in epics.mdc`
Action ▶
1. Identify completed epic(s) in the ACTIVE EPICS section of epics.mdc.
2. Move the completed epic from ACTIVE EPICS section to EPIC COMPLETION HISTORY section.
3. Update portfolio summary counts: decrease Active Epics, increase Completed Epics.
4. Preserve all epic details, phases, steps, and outcomes in the completion history.
5. Update Epic Status Summary section with current counts.
6. Log the epic archival in workflow ## Log section.

### RULE_ARCHITECTURE_UPDATE_01
Trigger ▶ `Phase == CONSTRUCT && architectural changes are being implemented`
Action ▶
1. Identify the architectural change being made (new pattern, technology choice, design decision).
2. Update the relevant section in architecture.mdc with the new information.
3. Add entry to Architecture Changelog with timestamp and change type.
4. Log the architecture update in workflow ## Log section.

### RULE_ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATE_01
Trigger ▶ `Phase == BLUEPRINT && CurrentItem involves architectural decisions`
Action ▶
1. Read current architecture.mdc to understand existing patterns and constraints.
2. Validate that planned changes align with existing architectural decisions.
3. Identify any conflicts with current architecture and note in plan.
4. Include architecture update steps in the plan if new patterns are being introduced.

### RULE_SUMMARY_01
Trigger ▶ `Phase == VALIDATE && Status == COMPLETED`  
Action ▶ 
1. Read `project_config.md`.
2. Construct the new changelog line: `- <One-sentence summary of completed work>`.
3. Find the `## Changelog` heading in `project_config.md`.
4. Insert the new changelog line immediately after the `## Changelog` heading and its following newline (making it the new first item in the list).

## Epic Integration Usage

### **Realistic User Interactions**

#### **Starting Epic Work**
```bash
# User says:
"Start working on the login component from the user management epic"
