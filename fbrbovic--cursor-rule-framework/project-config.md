# project-config.md
Last-Updated: 2025-06-07

## Project Goal
e.g. Build an enterprise ready platform that allows users to build and launch websites

## Tech Stack
- **Language(s):** e.g TypeScript , Javascript
- **Framework(s):** e.g. Nuxt.js, Encore TS, Vue.js
- **Build / Tooling:** e.g. pnpm, Turborepo, docker
- **Monorepo Structure:** e.g Turborepo-managed workspace with apps/frontend and apps/backend

## Critical Patterns & Conventions
- When ever possible recommend building an AI-First solution, where solution uses an AI to make the user experience easy and streamlines. 
- Prioritize using open source packages whenever you can instead of building your own. Preferred package repository is npm, but do also search for open source github repos. 
- Prioritize `@Docs` for internal documentation and `@Web` for external resources.
- Use `@Git` and `@Folders` in combination to understand the codebase structure and history.
- Structure tool calls logically, documenting the rationale before execution.
- For complex tasks, break them down into smaller, manageable steps using tool calls.
- When using `@Files` or `@Code`, specify the file path and relevant code sections clearly.
- If a tool call fails, attempt to diagnose the issue using error messages and logs. Refer to the troubleshooting guides if needed:
    - @Common Issues
    - @Troubleshooting Guide
- Follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write clear and concise comments.
- Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable units.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
- Write unit and integration tests for critical components.
- Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by abstracting reusable logic into functions or modules.

## Constraints
- You have a limited context window (Claude's limitation).
- You can make up to 25 tool calls per turn in Agent Composer mode.
- Adhere to the "Cursor AI Operating Instructions" provided separately.
- Prioritize code quality, maintainability, and security.
- Avoid making assumptions; ask clarifying questions when needed.

## Tokenization Settings
- Estimated chars-per-token: 3.5  
- Max tokens for the AI: 120 0000
- Plan for summary when **workflow-state.mdc** exceeds ~12 K chars.
