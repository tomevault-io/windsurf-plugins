**Instructions** 
This rule contains comprehensive overview of our Architecture.

You are always to refer to this file when making any Architectual Decisions or building, tracking and making any plans. 
You are always to keep expanding this and any referred sub documents with any relevent information or plans about any levels of our architecture.

Contains sections of various high level overviews of our architecture, each section might contain a reference to additional detailed doc, if it's there super important to always refer to it. 

# **Architecture Documentation**

## **AI & User Collaboration Protocol**

### **Update Guidelines**
- **AI Updates**: AI should update this file during CONSTRUCT phase when implementing architectural changes
- **User Updates**: Users can update this file directly when making architectural decisions
- **Conflict Resolution**: Latest timestamp wins; conflicts should be noted in changelog
- **Version Tracking**: All major changes should be logged with date and reason

### **Change Protocol**
```
## Architecture Changelog
- [YYYY-MM-DD] [AI/USER] [CHANGE_TYPE] - Brief description
- [YYYY-MM-DD] [AI/USER] [CHANGE_TYPE] - Brief description
```

## **High-Level Architecture**

### **System Overview**
<!-- AI/User: Update this section with overall system design -->
*No architecture defined yet. This will be populated as development progresses.*

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- [ ] Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Scalable and maintainable codebase
- [ ] Security-first approach
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Code reusability and DRY principles

### **Technology Stack**
<!-- AI/User: Update from project-config.mdc and actual implementation -->
*Technology stack will be documented here based on project-config.mdc and actual implementation choices.*

### **Deployment Architecture**
<!-- AI/User: Update with deployment strategy and infrastructure -->
*Deployment architecture will be defined here as infrastructure decisions are made.*

---

## **Domain Architecture**

### **Application Domains**
<!-- AI/User: Update with business domains and their relationships -->
*Application domains will be documented here as they are identified and implemented.*

### **Domain Boundaries**
<!-- AI/User: Update with clear domain separation and interfaces -->
*Domain boundaries and interfaces will be defined here as the application grows.*

## **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**

### **Decision Template**
```
### ADR-[NUMBER]: [TITLE]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: [Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]
**Deciders**: [AI/User/Team]

#### Context
[What is the issue we're trying to solve?]

#### Decision
[What is the change we're making?]

#### Consequences
[What becomes easier or harder to do because of this change?]

#### Alternatives Considered
[What other options were evaluated?]
```

### **Active Decisions**
<!-- AI/User: Add new ADRs here as architectural decisions are made -->
*No architectural decisions recorded yet. ADRs will be added as decisions are made.*

---

## **Architecture Validation Rules**

### **Validation Checklist**
- [ ] **Consistency**: New components follow existing patterns
- [ ] **Scalability**: Design supports expected growth
