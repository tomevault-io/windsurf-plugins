# PUREsuggest Project Overview

## Project Description

PUREsuggest is a Vue 3 scientific literature search tool that suggests publications through citation-based recommendations. Users start with seed papers and receive ranked suggestions based on citations, references, and keyword boosting. Features a responsive design with network visualization, filtering capabilities, and BibTeX export.

## Architecture

- **Framework**: Vue 3 with Composition API
- **State Management**: Pinia stores (`session.js`, `interface.js`, `queue.js`, `author.js`, `modal.js`)
- **UI Framework**: Vuetify 3 + Bulma CSS hybrid approach
- **Visualization**: D3.js for network diagrams
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest with Happy DOM

## Key Components

- `App.vue`: Main application layout with grid-based responsive design
- `NetworkVisComponent.vue`: D3-powered citation network visualization
- `SelectedPublicationsComponent.vue`: User's selected publications list
- `SuggestedPublicationsComponent.vue`: Ranked publication suggestions
- `PublicationComponent.vue`: Individual publication display with metadata
- `FilterMenuComponent.vue`: Advanced filtering interface

## Core Business Logic

- **Domain Models** (`src/core/`):
  - `Publication.js`: Publication model with metadata fetching and scoring
  - `Author.js`: Author aggregation and scoring algorithms
  - `Filter.js`: Publication filtering logic
  - `PublicationSearch.js`: DOI-based search functionality
- **Infrastructure** (`src/lib/`):
  - `Cache.js`: IndexedDB-based caching system
  - `Keys.js`: Keyboard event handling
  - `Util.js`: General utility functions

## Services Layer

- `SuggestionService.js`: Dedicated service for computing publication suggestions (extracted from session store)

## Composables (Vue 3)

- `useAppState.js`: Core application logic extracted from stores (session management, suggestions, queuing)
- `useModalManager.js`: Modal dialog management and state coordination

## Testing Strategy

- **Framework**: Vitest with Happy DOM for unit tests
- **Browser Testing**: Puppeteer for performance testing and UI automation
- **Test Organization**:
  - `tests/unit/` - Component and utility tests
  - `tests/performance/` - Load and rendering benchmarks using Puppeteer
  - `tests/helpers/` - Shared test utilities and mock factories
  - `tests/README.md` - Comprehensive testing best practices guide

### Running Tests

**Prerequisites**: Development server should be running at http://localhost:8080 for browser-based tests.

**Unit Tests**:
- `npm test` - Run all unit tests once
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode for development
- `npm run test:ui` - Launch interactive Vitest UI
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage report

**Performance Tests**:
- `npm run test:perf` - Run performance benchmarks using Puppeteer
- `npm run test:perf:watch` - Watch mode for performance tests

**All Tests**:
- `npm run test:all` - Run both unit and performance test suites

**Testing Best Practices**: See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for detailed guidelines on:
- Behavior-driven testing patterns
- Mock factories and utilities (`testUtils.js`)
- Store mocking patterns
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Development server (port 8080)
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run lint` - ESLint code checking
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Data Flow

1. **Selection**: Users select publications via DOI or search
2. **Citation Fetching**: Publications fetch citation/reference metadata
3. **Suggestion Generation**: Algorithm computes ranked suggestions based on citation overlap
4. **Keyword Boosting**: Users can boost rankings with keywords
5. **Filtering**: Advanced filters applied to both selected and suggested publications
6. **Visualization**: Network diagram shows citation relationships
7. **Export**: Session state and BibTeX export capabilities

## State Management (Refactored Architecture)

- **Session Store**: Selected publications, excluded publications, suggestions, filters, boost keywords, active publication
- **Queue Store**: Temporary queues for batch operations (add/exclude publications)
- **Author Store**: Independent author aggregation and scoring (extracted from session store)
- **Interface Store**: UI state, loading states, mobile responsiveness
- **Modal Store**: Modal dialog states and search provider configuration
- **useAppState Composable**: Business logic layer coordinating between stores (session management, suggestion computation, queuing operations)
- **useModalManager Composable**: Modal dialog management and state coordination

## Performance Features

- Lazy loading of publication metadata
- Pagination for suggestions (`PAGINATION.LOAD_MORE_INCREMENT`)
- IndexedDB caching with LZ-string compression
- Performance monitoring with timing logs
- Memory usage tracking

## API Integration

- Multiple publication databases via DOI resolution
- Fallback strategies for metadata fetching
