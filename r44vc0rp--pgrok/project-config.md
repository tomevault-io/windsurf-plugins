## Architecture

- **Caddy was chosen over Traefik** because Traefik's Docker-label routing doesn't help here — tunnels route to SSH ports on localhost, not to containers. Caddy's admin API (`localhost:2019`) allows adding/removing reverse proxy routes at runtime via simple JSON POST/DELETE, which is the core mechanism for dynamic tunneling.
- **frp was evaluated and rejected.** frp and Traefik/Caddy both want ports 80/443, creating a conflict. For a single-user tool, SSH reverse tunnels are simpler and require zero extra software on the server. frp would only make sense for multi-user or non-SSH scenarios.
- The tunnel flow is: client SSH → server `pgrok-tunnel` script → Caddy admin API (add route) → stdin blocks → SSH drops → atexit removes route. The Python script's `sys.stdin.read()` is the mechanism that detects SSH disconnect.

## Server (Caddy + Docker)

- **`network_mode: host` is required** in `docker-compose.yml`. SSH tunnels bind to the host's `localhost`, which is unreachable from inside Docker's default bridge network. Without this, Caddy can see the route but can't reach the upstream.
- **`caddy-dns/vercel` is broken and abandoned** (1 commit from 2021, never updated for `libdns` breaking API change). Do NOT use it. The `caddy-dns/cloudflare` module is actively maintained and is the correct choice. Env var: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`.
- **On-Demand TLS is the preferred approach** — uses stock Caddy (no custom build), provisions individual certs via HTTP-01 challenge as requests arrive. Requires a `pgrok-ask` endpoint to prevent cert abuse. No DNS provider module or API token needed.
- **Caddy Admin API quirks with null routes**: When a Caddyfile creates a server with no routes (just on-demand TLS), the `routes` key is null/missing. `POST /config/apps/http/servers/srv0/routes` fails with "cannot unmarshal object into RouteList" 500 error. `PUT` to create it fails with 409 "key already exists" if routes were ever initialized. **Solution**: Use GET-modify-PATCH pattern: fetch existing routes (default to `[]` if GET fails), modify the array, then `PATCH` the entire array back. `PATCH` works whether the key exists or is null; `PUT` only works for creation.
- **Caddy route evaluation order matters**: Routes are evaluated in array order. A catch-all route with no `match` condition (e.g., `respond 502`) placed first in the Caddyfile will match ALL requests before any dynamically-added routes can match by host. Solution: either omit catch-all routes entirely, or ensure they have specific match conditions that don't overlap with tunnel routes.
- **Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud) must be OFF** for the wildcard A record. Caddy handles TLS termination directly — if Cloudflare proxies, it breaks the SSL handshake since Caddy expects to terminate TLS itself.
- The Caddy admin API `srv0` server name is Caddy's default when configured via Caddyfile. Deleting routes by ID uses `DELETE /id/<route-id>`.

## Server Script (`server/pgrok-tunnel`)

- Domain is configured two ways: `setup.sh` does `sed` replacement of `yourdomain.com` at install time, and the `PGROK_DOMAIN` env var serves as a runtime override. The sed approach means the installed copy at `/usr/local/bin/pgrok-tunnel` has the real domain baked in.
- The `read_timeout: 0` in the Caddy route config is intentional — it disables timeouts for long-lived connections like WebSockets and SSE streams.
- Stale route cleanup is a known gap. If SSH is SIGKILL'd, `atexit` won't fire and the Caddy route persists. Re-connecting with the same subdomain overwrites the stale route (same `@id`), which is a self-healing behavior.

## Server Script (`server/pgrok-ask`)

- A tiny HTTP server on port 9123 that Caddy's `on_demand_tls` directive queries before issuing a certificate. Returns 200 for `*.yourdomain.com`, 403 for anything else.
- Runs as a systemd service (`pgrok-ask.service`). Must be running before Caddy attempts to provision any certs.
- Without this, anyone could point a domain at the VPS and Caddy would issue certs for it, exhausting Let's Encrypt rate limits.

## Client (`client/pgrok`)

- Remote port is deterministic: `10000 + (cksum of subdomain) % 50000`. This means the same subdomain always gets the same remote port, avoiding the need for port negotiation. Collision is theoretically possible but negligible for single-user.
- The client uses `ssh -tt` (force pseudo-terminal allocation) so that the server-side `pgrok-tunnel` script receives a proper stdin that closes when the SSH connection drops.
- **`ExitOnForwardFailure` was intentionally removed** from SSH options. With this flag, SSH exits entirely if the local port isn't listening when the tunnel starts. Removing it allows the tunnel to stay alive (like ngrok) — start/stop local services freely while the tunnel runs. Individual forwarded connections fail silently if nothing is local, but the SSH session persists.
