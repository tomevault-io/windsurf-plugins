## Project Structure & Module Organization
This is a Go workspace (`go.work`) with three published modules plus the examples. The root module `go.agentcat.com/sdk/v2` exposes its public surface in `mcpcat.go`, `types.go`, `custom_event.go`, `context_description.go`, `diagnostics.go`, and `metadata.go`, and keeps all shared logic under `internal/`. The two adapter modules — `mcpgo/` (mark3labs/mcp-go) and `officialsdk/` (modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk) — have their own `go.mod`, cannot import `internal/` across the module boundary, and therefore consume root re-exports. Each adapter owns its `Track()` entry point and `Options`, its tools/list injection and tools/call capture path, and a `get_more_tools.go` that registers the optional tool.

Key internal packages: `internal/constants` pins the agent-facing copy, injected parameter names, wire keys, and event tags byte-for-byte against the other AgentCat SDKs; `internal/handles` mints, derives, extracts, and resolves task and agent handles; `internal/inject` is the pure, deterministic schema-injection engine (build, registries, strip, structured mirror); `internal/core` holds `Options`, `Event`, `AgentCatInstance`, and `UserIdentity`; `internal/registry` keeps a thread-safe server→`AgentCatInstance` map keyed by pointer address and released via `runtime.AddCleanup`; `internal/publisher` and `internal/exporters` fan events out; `internal/logging` centralizes file-backed logging to `~/agentcat.log`. There is no `internal/session`, `internal/sessionmap`, or `internal/testutil` — v2 removed transport sessions entirely.

`MIGRATION.md` is the source of truth for the v1→v2 delta and the list of removed APIs; keep other docs consistent with it rather than restating it.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run everything from the repo root. The full gate is `make check && make test-mcpgo && make test-officialsdk && make build-examples`. Do not shorten it to `make check && make build-examples`: `make check`'s test step is `go test ./...` from the root, and a root-level `./...` does **not** reach nested modules, with or without `go.work` — so it runs 17 root packages and **zero** adapter tests. That is why `test-mcpgo` and `test-officialsdk` exist as separate targets, and why `make vet` iterates every module rather than calling `go vet ./...` once. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) covers the same ground in four jobs: a `gofmt` check, `go test -race` per module across a Go 1.24/stable matrix, `make vet`, and `make build-examples`. Use `go test -race ./...` when touching shared-memory code, and `go test -v -run TestName ./path/...` for a focused run. Apply `make tidy` only when dependencies truly change so the module files stay stable. Because `go.work` is gitignored, every example must also build standalone (`cd examples/<x>/<y> && GOWORK=off go build .`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow default Go style: tabs for indentation, `UpperCamelCase` for exported symbols, `lowerCamelCase` for private helpers, and all-cap prefixes like `PrefixEvent` only for immutable constants. Keep package-level state guarded by `sync` primitives as seen in `internal/registry`. Document non-obvious behavior with short comments next to the relevant block rather than above every line. Two invariants are worth stating explicitly in code: nothing reachable from an `AgentCatInstance` may hold a strong reference back to its server (per-request `Track()` factories would leak), and `inject.Build` must stay deterministic (rebuild-on-demand depends on identical config plus identical tools yielding identical registries).

## Testing Guidelines
Place tests beside implementation packages (e.g., `internal/handles/handles_test.go`). Mirror exported APIs with table-driven tests, explicitly covering concurrent access paths (`registry`, `logging`), the per-request factory topology, and edge cases such as nil servers. Prefer deterministic clocks/mocks over real time by injecting dependencies where necessary. Assert events by identity (event type, task ID) rather than by position in the published slice.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Use clear, imperative commit subjects capped at ~70 characters (e.g., `Add Mark3Labs hook instrumentation`). Reference related issues in the body and call out TODO resolutions. PRs should link to context, explain behavioral impact, list manual verification (e.g., `make check`), and include screenshots only when user-facing behavior changes.
