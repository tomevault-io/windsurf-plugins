# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Archie — AI-powered architecture analysis and enforcement for coding agents. Analyzes any codebase, generates a structured blueprint (JSON), and produces: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, per-folder context files, and real-time enforcement hooks. Works with any language, zero dependencies beyond Python 3.9+.

## Repository Layout

- `archie/` — Python package (`archie-cli`): CLI commands, analysis engine, standalone scripts
- `archie/standalone/` — Zero-dependency Python scripts (scanner, renderer, validator, intent layer, health, drift, hooks)
- `npm-package/` — NPM distribution (`npx @bitraptors/archie`): copies scripts + Claude Code commands to target projects
- `tests/` — Test suite (pytest)
- `docs/` — Architecture documentation
- `landing/` — Landing page
- `v1/` — Archived V1 web app (FastAPI backend + Next.js frontend, obsolete)

## Commands

### Standalone Scripts
```bash
# Scanner — analyze repository structure
python3 archie/standalone/scanner.py /path/to/project

# Renderer — generate CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, rule files from blueprint
python3 archie/standalone/renderer.py /path/to/project

# Validator — check generated output against actual codebase
python3 archie/standalone/validate.py all /path/to/project

# Hooks — install enforcement hooks
python3 archie/standalone/install_hooks.py /path/to/project

# Intent layer — AI-generated per-folder CLAUDE.md via DAG scheduling
python3 archie/standalone/intent_layer.py prepare /path/to/project
python3 archie/standalone/intent_layer.py next-ready /path/to/project
```

### NPM Package
```bash
# Install Archie into a project (copies scripts + commands)
npx @bitraptors/archie /path/to/project

# Then in Claude Code on the target project:
/archie-scan      # Architecture health check (1-3 min, run often)
/archie-deep-scan # Comprehensive architecture baseline (15-20 min, run once)
/archie-viewer    # Blueprint inspector
```

### Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Two-Command Architecture

- **`/archie-scan`** — Architecture health check (1-3 min). Runs deterministic scanner for data gathering, then AI analyzes architecture like a senior architect: finds dependency violations, pattern drift, complexity hotspots, proposes enforceable rules.
- **`/archie-deep-scan`** — Comprehensive baseline (15-20 min). Full 2-wave AI analysis producing blueprint, per-folder CLAUDE.md, rules, and health metrics. Run once, then use `/archie-scan` for incremental checks.

## Deep Scan Pipeline (2-Wave)

1. **Scanner** — Counts files, detects frameworks, builds file tree
2. **Wave 1** (parallel) — 3-4 Sonnet agents gather facts:
   - Structure agent: Components, layers, file placement
   - Patterns agent: Communication, design patterns, integrations
   - Technology agent: Stack, deployment, dev rules
   - UI Layer agent: UI components, state, routing (only if frontend_ratio >= 0.20)
3. **Wave 2** — Reasoning agent (Opus) reads all Wave 1 output, produces architectural reasoning:
   - Decision chain (rooted constraint tree with violation keywords)
   - Key decisions with forced_by/enables links
   - Trade-offs with violation signals
   - Pitfalls with causal chains (stems_from)
   - Architecture diagram, implementation guidelines
4. **Normalize** — AI reshapes raw output to canonical schema
5. **Render** — Deterministic JSON→Markdown (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, rule files)
6. **Validate** — Cross-reference output against actual codebase
7. **Intent Layer** — AI-generated per-folder CLAUDE.md via bottom-up DAG
8. **Scan report** — Phase 4 of Step 9 writes `.archie/scan_report.md` with ranked findings in the same format `/archie-scan` emits (so `/archie-share` and future trend runs pick it up immediately after a deep scan)

## Key Data Model

Blueprint JSON (`blueprint.json`) contains: `meta`, `architecture_rules`, `decisions` (with `decision_chain`), `components`, `communication`, `quick_reference`, `technology`, `deployment`, `frontend`, `pitfalls`, `implementation_guidelines`, `development_rules`, `architecture_diagram`.

## Rules System

Rules come from two sources:

1. **Blueprint extraction** (`archie/rules/extractor.py`) — Deterministically extracts `file_placement` and `naming` rules from the blueprint.
2. **AI-proposed rules** (`/archie-scan`) — The scan AI proposes rules with check types: `forbidden_import`, `required_pattern`, `forbidden_content`, `architectural_constraint`, `file_naming`.

Additionally, `platform_rules.json` provides predefined architectural checks installed with every project.

The `/archie-deep-scan` Wave 2 (Opus reasoning) produces deeper architectural context in the blueprint: decision chains, trade-offs with violation signals, pitfalls with causal chains. These inform the AI's analysis during `/archie-scan` but are not extracted as mechanical check rules.

## File Sync

Standalone scripts exist in two places (canonical → copy):
- `archie/standalone/*.py` → `npm-package/assets/*.py`
- `.claude/commands/archie-*.md` (including `archie-scan.md`, `archie-deep-scan.md`) → `npm-package/assets/archie-*.md`
