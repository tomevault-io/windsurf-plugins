# SetShot — Claude Procedures

## Reviewing KB Submissions

New submissions arrive as GitHub Issues in `adamengst/setshot-submissions` (private). Run through these steps in order:

1. List open submissions — always check **both** labels:
   ```
   gh issue list --repo adamengst/setshot-submissions --label pending
   gh issue list --repo adamengst/setshot-submissions --label kb-feedback
   ```
   - `pending`: unrecognized changes submitted by users — decide **noise**, **KB entry**, or **needs more info**.
   - `kb-feedback`: user corrections to existing recognized entries — fix the KB entry (description, location, value_map, settings URL, etc.) and close with a comment.

2. View each issue. For `pending`, decide: **noise** (suppress silently), **KB entry** (add with description/location), or **needs more info**. For `kb-feedback`, apply the reported correction to the existing entry.

3. Edit `settings-kb.json` in `/Users/adam/GitHub/setshot-kb/`:
   - Noise entry: `"noise": true`, `"noise_reason": "..."`, leave `description`/`ui_location`/`settings_url` null.
   - If the key contains array indices (`[0]`) or UUIDs, use `"key": ""` and `"key_prefix": "..."` instead of an exact key.
   - Known entry: fill `description`, `ui_location`, `settings_url` (x-apple.systempreferences: URL if applicable), `value_map` if the values need human labels.
   - Set `"contributed_by_issue": <issue number>` in all cases.

4. Bump `version.json` — increment `version` by 1, update `updated_at` to current UTC timestamp.

5. Commit and push in `setshot-kb`:
   ```
   git add settings-kb.json version.json
   git commit -m "Description of changes (issues #N, #M)"
   git push
   ```

6. Close each issue in `adamengst/setshot-submissions` with a comment explaining what was done and which KB version it landed in.

## Releasing a New Version

`scripts/release.sh` does all of this. It reads the version from `project.yml`,
refuses to start unless the tree is clean, on `main`, in step with origin, and the
version and build are genuinely unpublished, then archives, notarises, staples,
builds both the zip and a disk image, signs the zip for Sparkle, and — after asking
— creates the GitHub release, adds the appcast entry and pushes it.

    scripts/release.sh --dry-run    # build and notarise, stop before publishing
    scripts/release.sh              # the same, then publish after confirming

Bump `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `project.yml` and commit
before running it. Signing keys stay in the keychain; nothing here needs them
anywhere else.

The steps below are what the script does, kept as the reference and as the fallback
if it fails partway.

### Before archiving

1. Check for pending KB submissions and process them first:
   ```
   gh issue list --repo adamengst/setshot-submissions --label pending
   ```

2. Check for a newer Sparkle release:
   ```
   gh release list --repo sparkle-project/Sparkle --limit 5
   ```
   Compare against the version pinned in `SetShot.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved`. Only upgrade if the new release has been out for **at least two to three weeks** — long enough for regression reports to surface. If upgrading, update `Package.resolved` with the new version and commit hash, build and test before proceeding.

3. Increment `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `project.yml` (e.g. `1.0` → `1.1`, build `1` → `2`).
3. Run `xcodegen generate` to update the `.xcodeproj`.
4. Run the test suite and confirm all tests pass:
   ```
   xcodebuild test -project SetShot.xcodeproj -scheme SetShot -destination 'platform=macOS'
   ```
5. Commit `project.yml` (and any other pending changes) and push.

### Building, notarizing, and stapling

4. Archive and export — all output goes to `/tmp/`:
   ```
   xcodebuild archive \
     -project SetShot.xcodeproj \
     -scheme SetShot \
     -destination 'generic/platform=macOS' \
     -archivePath /tmp/SetShot.xcarchive

   xcodebuild -exportArchive \
     -archivePath /tmp/SetShot.xcarchive \
     -exportPath /tmp/SetShot-export \
     -exportOptionsPlist ExportOptions.plist
   ```

5. Notarize and staple:
   ```
   ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent /tmp/SetShot-export/SetShot.app /tmp/SetShot-notarize.zip
   xcrun notarytool submit /tmp/SetShot-notarize.zip --keychain-profile SetShot-notarize --wait
   xcrun stapler staple /tmp/SetShot-export/SetShot.app
   ```
   (`xcodebuild -exportArchive` does not reliably auto-notarize, so submit manually every time.)

6. Zip the stapled app:
   ```
   ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent /tmp/SetShot-export/SetShot.app /tmp/SetShot-X.Y.zip
   ```

### Signing for Sparkle

7. Generate the EdDSA signature:
   ```
   "$(ls -t ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SetShot-*/SourcePackages/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/sign_update | head -1)" /tmp/SetShot-X.Y.zip
   ```
   Note the `sparkle:edSignature` and `length` values.

### Publishing

8. Create the GitHub Release and upload the zip:
   ```
   gh release create vX.Y /tmp/SetShot-X.Y.zip \
     --title "SetShot X.Y" \
     --notes "..." \
     --repo adamengst/setshot-app
   ```

9. Add a new `<item>` to `appcast.xml` in `setshot-app`:
