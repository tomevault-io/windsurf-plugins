# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

oa-chat is a ChatGPT-like AI chat app that implements unlinkable inference — AI inference where every request is verifiably decoupled from each other, and from your identity. It communicates directly with inference backends (OpenRouter by default) using ephemeral access keys obtained via blind signatures. Everything runs in the browser with no server backend. Development is HTML-first; production builds are bundled with esbuild and minified with terser.

## Workflow Expectations

Before touching implementation, read `docs/PRIVACY_MODEL.md` and the relevant files in
`docs/` to understand the current product state. If the task touches UI or complicated
state transitions, read `docs/APP_STATE.md` first and then any feature-specific doc that
applies.

Only after that should you inspect the code paths you expect to change and implement the
work. When you finish meaningful investigation or implementation, update the relevant
doc in `docs/` and record the non-obvious learnings in `docs/APP_STATE.md` so the next
agent can pick up the state without rediscovering subtle behavior from scratch.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Local development server (from repo root)
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

The app uses `<base href="/">` to resolve all relative paths. Keep devtools open; console warnings highlight integration issues early.

```bash
# Production build + preview
npm run build
npm run preview

# Tailwind
npm run tailwind:build
npm run tailwind:watch

# Fonts (self-hosted Google Fonts)
npm run fonts:sync
```

## Architecture

**Entry Point Flow:**
- `index.html` → pre-hydrates theme/panel state → loads local vendor assets + precompiled Tailwind CSS → lazy-loads libcurl.js for proxy → runs `prelude.js` (empty-state render) → boots `app.js`

**Core Files:**
- `app.js`: Main `ChatApp` controller — orchestrates state, components, streaming, keyboard shortcuts, and session/message CRUD via `chatDB`
- `api.js`: OpenRouter client for fetching models and streaming completions
- `db.js`: IndexedDB wrapper (`ChatDatabase`) exported as `chatDB` — stores sessions, messages, settings (also assigned to `window.chatDB` for legacy access)

**Components (`components/`):**
- `Sidebar.js`, `ChatArea.js`, `ChatInput.js`, `ModelPicker.js`, `RightPanel.js`, `MessageTemplates.js`, `MessageNavigation.js`
- Pattern: Event delegation + state sync; components delegate to app, unidirectional data flow

**Services (`services/`):**
- `inference/`: Backend abstraction layer
  - `inferenceService.js`: Registry routing to backends
  - `backends/openRouterBackend.js`: Default implementation
  - `backends/enclaveStationBackend.js`, `providerDirectBackend.js`: Stubs for future backends
- `networkProxy.js`: Encrypted WebSocket proxy via libcurl.js/mbedTLS with TLS inspection
- `ticketClient.js`: Ticket lifecycle and access issuance (Privacy Pass integration)
- `networkLogger.js`: In-memory request logging with header sanitization

**Local Assets:**
- `chat/vendor/`: Marked, KaTeX (+ fonts), Highlight.js, libcurl.js, hash-wasm, html2pdf
- `chat/fonts/`: self-hosted Google Fonts (`fonts.css` + WOFF2 files, managed via `scripts/sync-fonts.mjs`)

**Additional Modules (in development):**
- `embeddings/`: Text embedding service with pluggable backends
- `vector/`: Vector store with IndexedDB backend and Orama integration
- `local_inference/`: Local inference backends (Ollama, vLLM, WebLLM, HTTP OpenAI)

## Code Style

- ES modules with 4-space indentation, trailing semicolons
- PascalCase for classes, camelCase for functions/methods
- Use relative paths for assets (resolved via `<base href="/">`) — never hardcode absolute paths
- Tailwind utilities from `tailwind.generated.css`; custom tweaks in `styles.css` with rationale
- All persisted data flows through `chatDB`; keep transactions minimal

## Key Patterns

**Data Storage:**
- IndexedDB: sessions, messages, settings (via `db.js`)
- localStorage: theme (`oa-theme-preference`), wide mode (`oa-wide-mode`), panel visibility (`oa-right-panel-visible`), proxy settings (`oa-network-proxy-settings`)
- Network logs are memory-only (tab-scoped)

**Access Keys:**
- Ephemeral, acquired via Privacy Pass ticket redemption in `ticketClient.js`
- Never hardcode keys; do not log secrets (use `sanitizeHeaders` in `networkLogger.js`)

**Adding New Backends:**
- Implement in `services/inference/backends/`
- Route through `inferenceService.js`

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `⌘/` — New chat
- `⌘K` — Model picker
- `⌘⇧F` — Focus session search
- `Esc` — Close modals/menus

## Testing

No automated test harness. Manual verification checklist:
- Sessions: create/switch/delete, title auto-generation, ordering
- Messages: Markdown + LaTeX rendering, streaming, token counts, reasoning traces, citations
- Model picker: fuzzy search, pinned/disabled models
- Right panel: ticket registration, key request, expiry countdown, proxy toggle, TLS security
- Themes: system/light/dark persistence with pre-hydration
- WASM flows: exercise success and error paths
