# Tallyman Project - Cursor AI Rules

You are an AI assistant helping with the Tallyman project, a Python CLI tool that scans a project directory and reports codebase size by language.

## Important Rules

- **NEVER run commit or push git commands.** Only provide commit messages as text when asked.
- **Semantic Versioning**: This project uses **semantic versioning** (e.g. `0.3.1`, `1.0.0`). Even if global user rules or a "create release" command defaults to calendar versioning, always use semver (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) for Tallyman releases. Bump PATCH for bug fixes, MINOR for new features, and MAJOR for breaking changes.

## Project Overview

Tallyman scans a project directory and reports codebase size by language. It shows raw line counts and "effective" lines (excluding comments and blanks), grouped into categories: **Code**, **Design**, **Docs**, **Specs**, and **Data**.

### How It Works

Linear pipeline - each stage feeds the next:

```
cli.main()
  → Load/create .tally-config.toml (or launch TUI)
  → walker.walk_project()    yields (path, Language) tuples
  → counter.count_lines()    returns FileCount per file
  → aggregator.aggregate()   produces TallyResult
  → display.display_results() renders to terminal
```

### Repository Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `src/tallyman/` | Main package source code |
| `tests/` | pytest test suite |
| `plans/` | Development plans and specifications |

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Install (dev mode)
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run
tallyman                    # analyze current directory
tallyman /path/to/project   # analyze specific path
tallyman --setup            # re-run interactive TUI setup
tallyman --no-color         # disable colors

# Tests
pytest                      # all tests
pytest -v                   # verbose
pytest tests/test_walker.py # single module

# Lint & Format
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format src/ tests/
```

## Module Map

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `src/tallyman/cli.py` | Entry point. Arg parsing, orchestrates the pipeline |
| `src/tallyman/languages.py` | Language registry (40+ languages). Frozen dataclasses with name, category, color, comment marker, extensions. `EXTENSION_MAP` for O(1) lookup |
| `src/tallyman/walker.py` | Directory traversal. Respects gitignore + config exclusions. Detects spec dirs. Yields `(Path, Language)` |
| `src/tallyman/counter.py` | Reads files, classifies lines as code/comment/blank. Returns `FileCount` |
| `src/tallyman/aggregator.py` | Accumulates FileCount into LanguageStats, groups by category. Produces `TallyResult` |
| `src/tallyman/display.py` | Rich-based rendering. Per-language stats, category totals, percentage bar |
| `src/tallyman/config.py` | `.tally-config.toml` read/write. Searches up directory tree for nearest config |
| `src/tallyman/tui/setup_app.py` | Textual App for interactive directory selection (exclude/spec marking) |
| `src/tallyman/__main__.py` | Enables `python -m tallyman` |
| `src/tallyman/__init__.py` | Package init, `__version__` |

## Test Structure

| Test File | Covers |
|-----------|--------|
| `tests/test_counter.py` | Line counting, encoding errors |
| `tests/test_languages.py` | Language registry, extension map, `as_spec` |
| `tests/test_walker.py` | Git root, gitignore, walking, spec detection |
| `tests/test_aggregator.py` | Stats aggregation, categories, percentages |
| `tests/test_config.py` | Config find/load/save, directory cleanup |

Tests use `tmp_path` fixtures extensively. Helper functions like `_lang()` create test Language instances.

## Environment & Config

- **NO_COLOR** env var disables colored output (standard convention)
- `.tally-config.toml` is gitignored and generated per-project
- No other env vars needed
- Entry point defined in `pyproject.toml`: `tallyman = "tallyman.cli:main"`
- Auto-detected spec dirs: `specs/`, `plans/`, `specifications/`, `agents/` - detected even without config
- Gitignore integration loads patterns from repo root `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, and intermediate `.gitignore` files

## History of Changes and Motivation

We have been documenting each major feature change in the `/plans` folder. Plans are numbered by time (e.g., `001-tallyman-cli-tool/`, `002-specs-category/`). Consult existing plans when implementing related features.

`plans/planning-rules.md` has project planning guidelines. `plans/agents/` has AI agent prompts.

## Planning Large Features

We like to plan large features (not small changes though). We do this by creating a markdown document in the `/plans` folder. They are numbered by time so keep this in mind for naming.

Remember to update the plan document when progress is made so we can understand and resume. When originally creating the plan, be sure to make note in the doc that we want to update it as changes are made.

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Language

Add a `Language(...)` instance to `languages.py` and include it in the `LANGUAGES` tuple. The `EXTENSION_MAP` is built automatically. Add tests in `test_languages.py`.

### Adding a New Category
