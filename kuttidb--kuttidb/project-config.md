# AGENTS.md — Rules for AI Agents and Contributors

KuttiDB is a C database/server with a TypeScript management console. This file
defines the conventions every agent and human contributor must follow. It is
the single source of truth for where documentation lives.

## Documentation policy (mandatory)

**All project documentation lives in `docs/`. Never create `.md` files at the
repository root.**

The root keeps exactly three markdown-visible files:

- `README.md` — project entry point (the only documentation file allowed at root)
- `AGENTS.md` — this file
- `LICENSE` — not markdown, listed for completeness

Anything else — guides, references, specs, implementation plans, working
instructions, notes — goes under `docs/` in the matching subfolder. One
exception: the agent skill `.agents/skills/kuttidb/SKILL.md` is an
agent-invocation artifact, not project documentation; it is governed by the
skill-sync rule below and must not be moved into `docs/`.

### Where new documents go

| Path | Put here | Naming |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/guides/` | First-run guides, how-tos, migration comparisons | `UPPER_SNAKE.md` |
| `docs/design/` | Architecture, wire protocol, durability model | `UPPER_SNAKE.md` |
| `docs/messaging/` | Queue, exchange, and stream semantics | `UPPER_SNAKE.md` |
| `docs/operations/` | Deployment, Docker, Kubernetes, benchmarks, releases | `UPPER_SNAKE.md` |
| `docs/api/` | Management API reference material | `UPPER_SNAKE.md` |
| `docs/plans/` | Roadmap plus implementation plans and instruction documents used for development (by humans or agents) — **kept locally, not part of the published repository** | `UPPER_SNAKE.md`, suffix `_PLAN` or `_INSTRUCTION` |
| `docs/adr/` | Architecture decision records | `NNNN-short-title.md`, sequential number |
| `docs/SECURITY.md` | Security policy (must stay directly under `docs/` so GitHub recognizes it) | fixed |

If a document spans categories, pick the primary audience: operators →
`operations/`, application developers → `guides/`, protocol/storage internals →
`design/`.

### Rules when writing or moving documentation

1. Never add, leave, or re-create `.md` files at the repository root except
   `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
2. When you add a user-facing document, add a row to the index tables in
   `README.md` (Documentation section) and `docs/README.md`.
3. Use relative links between documents. After moving a document, fix:
   its outbound links, links pointing at it from other docs, the
   `README.md` tables, and the GitHub `blob/main/...` links in
   the separate private website repository.
4. Source comments may reference documents — use the repo-root path
   (e.g. `docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md`), never a bare filename.
5. Do not rename documents casually; agents and CI reference them by path.
   If a rename is required, update every reference and keep the move in its
   own commit.
6. Transient working notes for agent-driven tasks belong in `docs/plans/`,
   not the root, not `docs/` directly, and never in commit messages alone.
   The whole `docs/plans/` folder is gitignored: it stays on each
   contributor's machine and is never published or linked from other docs.

## Agent skill sync (mandatory)

`.agents/skills/kuttidb/SKILL.md` is the repository's agent skill. Agents load
it before starting the server, writing client code, configuring deployments,
or calling the Management API, so it must describe the current state of the
system — never a past one.

1. Whenever you implement a new feature or change any behavior the skill
   describes — server CLI flags or defaults, wire protocol or STATS output,
   client SDK methods or configuration, managed local mode (`kuttidb ensure`),
   metrics or Management API resources and conventions, Docker/compose setup,
   or test commands — update the skill **in the same pull request**. Skill
   sync is part of the definition of done, on the same level as running
   `make test`.
2. Verify every claim you add against the implementation before writing it:
   flags in `src/server.c` and `src/managed_launcher.c`, SDK surfaces in
   `clients/`, the Management API in `src/admin_http.c` and
   `openapi/management-v1.yaml`. Never copy examples forward from stale docs
   or memory.
3. Keep the skill's YAML frontmatter valid and accurate: `name` stays
   `kuttidb`, and `description` must still name the situations that should
   trigger agents to invoke the skill.
4. The skill references documentation by repo-root path. When documents move
   or are renamed, fix the skill's links in the same change (see rule 5
   above).
5. Do not expand the skill into a second documentation tree: it stays a
   compact operational reference for agents and points to `docs/` for depth.
   If a topic needs full prose, document it in `docs/` and link to it.

## Build and test

```sh
make              # builds kuttidb, kuttidb-bench, and the embedded library
make test         # core, platform, queues, exchanges, atomicity, streams, fuzz, embed
make bench-quick  # cache performance gates
pnpm lint && pnpm test   # management console (apps/management-ui)
```

- Durable semantics are the contract: a PR that changes acknowledgement or
  recovery behavior must come with a matching crash-test.
- Run `make test` before submitting; run the console checks when `apps/`
  or `packages/` change.
