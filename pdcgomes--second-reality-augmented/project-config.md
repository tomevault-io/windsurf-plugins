# Remastered Effect Documentation

## When to Create

After completing a new remastered effect variant (`effect.remastered.js`), create a companion document at:

```
docs/effects/{NN}-{effect-name}-remastered.md
```

where `{NN}` matches the part number of the classic doc (e.g., `06-glenz-3d-remastered.md`).

## When to Update

Update the remastered doc whenever:

- The remastered effect's rendering pipeline changes (new passes, different shader approach)
- Parameters are added, removed, or their ranges change
- Beat reactivity behavior is modified
- New post-processing stages are added
- Items move from "not yet implemented" to implemented
- The implementation checklist changes status

## Required Sections

Every remastered doc must include these sections:

### Header

```markdown
# Part {N} — {NAME} Remastered: {Short Description}

**Status:** Complete | In progress
**Source file:** `src/effects/{name}/effect.remastered.js`
**Shared animation:** `src/effects/{name}/animation.js`
**Classic doc:** [{NN}-{effect-name}.md]({NN}-{effect-name}.md)
```

### Sections Checklist

1. **Overview** — What the remastered variant does differently, with a comparison table vs classic
2. **Architecture** — Mermaid diagram showing module relationships (shared animation, data, core)
3. **Rendering Pipeline** — Mermaid flowchart of the per-frame render passes with a table of pass details (program, target FBO, resolution)
4. **Lighting/Shading Model** — How surfaces are lit (if applicable), with shader component breakdown
5. **Post-Processing** — Bloom pipeline, trails, or other full-screen effects
6. **Beat Reactivity** — Table of beat-driven effects with formulas
7. **Editor Parameters** — Full table of the exported `params` array (key, label, range, default, description)
8. **Shader Programs** — Table listing each program, its vertex/fragment shaders, and purpose
9. **GPU Resources** — Summary of allocated GL objects (programs, VAOs, textures, FBOs)
10. **What Changed From Classic** — Side-by-side table of classic vs remastered approach per aspect
11. **Remaining Ideas** — Unimplemented ideas from the classic doc's "Remastered Ideas" section
12. **References** — Links to classic doc, shared animation module, remastered rule

For effects still in progress, also include:

13. **Implementation Checklist** — Checkbox list tracking what is done vs pending

## Diagram Conventions

Use Mermaid diagrams for:

- **Module dependency graphs**: `graph LR` showing how animation.js, data.js, core/webgl.js connect to the effect
- **Rendering pipeline flowcharts**: `flowchart TD` showing the sequence of render passes, FBO targets, and data flow
- **Shading model graphs**: `graph LR/TD` showing how shader inputs combine to produce the final color

Keep diagrams focused — one concept per diagram. Use subgraphs to group related passes.

## Style

- Match the tone and depth of the classic effect docs
- Focus on the *how* and *why* of technical decisions, not just *what*
- Include formulas for lighting, beat curves, and blending when they clarify behavior
- Use tables for structured comparisons and parameter listings
- Link back to the classic doc for shared details (geometry, timeline, physics) rather than duplicating them
