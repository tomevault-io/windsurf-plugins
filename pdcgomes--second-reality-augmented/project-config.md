# Player Runtime Conventions

## Constraints

- Pure vanilla JS — no npm dependencies, no build step, no framework
- Must work as a static file served from any origin (file://, http://, https://)
- Imports only from `../core/` and `../effects/` via relative ES module paths

## Project Loading

Three-mode resolution, checked in order:

1. URL param: `?project=https://example.com/project.json`
2. Inline: `window.__DEMO_PROJECT__` (set by export pipeline)
3. Local fallback: `fetch('../assets/project.json')`

## Canvas

- Fullscreen `<canvas>` with `image-rendering: pixelated`
- Internal resolution: 320×256 (classic) or viewport size (remastered)
- Nearest-neighbor upscaling only — never bilinear
