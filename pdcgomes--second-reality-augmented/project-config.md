# Commit Discipline

## Rules

- Every commit is an atomic logical unit of work — one concern per commit
- Every commit must build cleanly and pass all tests before being created
- Never commit code that is known to be broken. Stubs are fine; broken stubs are not.
- Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`

## Pre-Commit Checklist

1. `npm run build` succeeds in `src/editor/`
2. `npm test` passes in `src/editor/` (Vitest)
3. No linter errors introduced
4. If a tracked milestone was completed, update `docs/TRACKER.md`

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <concise description of what and why>
```

Types: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `test` (tests), `chore` (tooling/config), `refactor` (restructure), `docs` (documentation)
