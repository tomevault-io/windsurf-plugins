# Project Architecture

Monorepo with source under `src/`, two entry points sharing `core/` and `effects/`:

- `src/editor/` — React + Vite creative tool (the only place React/Vite/Tailwind live)
- `src/player/` — Vanilla JS fullscreen runtime (no npm deps, no build step)
- `src/core/` — Shared runtime machinery (vanilla ES modules, zero dependencies)
- `src/effects/` — One subfolder per effect with classic + optional remastered variants

React, Vite, Tailwind, and any npm framework code must NEVER appear in `core/`, `effects/`, or `player/`.

## Master Clock

`AudioContext.currentTime` is the single source of truth for all timing. Never use `Date.now()` or `performance.now()` for demo timing.

## Beat Map

Pre-authored JSON beat map, not real-time beat detection. Sync is intentional and handcrafted.

## Effect Fidelity

Each effect has a `classic` variant (1:1 faithful to the original) and an optional `remastered` variant (4K, enhanced). Classic is always implemented first.

## Testing

`core/` modules must have unit tests (Vitest). Effects are validated manually — do not unit test shaders or visual output.

## Documentation

`docs/` contains technical design documents. Update `docs/TRACKER.md` when completing tracked milestones.

## Deliverable

The exported single-HTML file (via `tools/export.js`) is the true distribution artifact.
