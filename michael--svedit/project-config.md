# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

**Development:**
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

**Testing:**
- `npm run test:unit` - Run unit tests with Vitest
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run end-to-end tests with Playwright
- `npm run test` - Run both unit and e2e tests

**Testing Guidelines:**
- DO NOT run tests automatically (test:unit, test:e2e, test, etc.)
- The user prefers to run all tests manually
- Focus on implementing code changes and let the user handle testing

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Do exactly what the user asks for - one step at a time
- Do NOT think 4 steps ahead or add extra features/improvements
- Only implement the specific change requested
- You can suggest what the next step could be, but don't implement it

**Refactoring Guidelines:**
- During refactors, make ONLY the minimal changes needed (e.g., renaming APIs)
- Do NOT "improve" or restructure logic while refactoring
- If you see something that could be improved, note it separately for a future task
- Refactoring and improving are two separate activities - never combine them

**Code Style:**
- Use snake_case for all variable names, function names, and identifiers
- This applies to JavaScript/TypeScript code, test files, and any new code written

**What to NOT change (keep camelCase):**
- `window.getSelection()` - native API
- `document.activeElement` - native API
- `navigator.clipboard` - native API
- `addEventListener` - native API
- `preventDefault()` - native API
- `stopPropagation()` - native API
- `getRangeAt()` - native API
- Svelte event handlers: `onclick`, `onmousedown`, etc.
- DOM properties: `innerHTML`, `textContent`, `nodeType`, etc.

**Pattern**: If it's a web platform API or Svelte API, keep camelCase. If it's our custom variable/function name, use snake_case.

**File Extensions:**
- Files using Svelte runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, etc.) must use `.svelte.js` or `.svelte.ts` extension

**Documentation Style:**
- Use sentence case for all headings in documentation (README.md, etc.)
- Use sentence case for code comments
- Sentence case means: capitalize only the first word and proper nouns
- **Exception**: "Svedit" is always capitalized as it's a proper noun (the product name)
- Examples:
  - ✓ "Getting started" (not "Getting Started")
  - ✓ "Why Svedit?" (not "Why svedit?") - Svedit is a proper noun
  - ✓ "Developing Svedit" (not "Developing svedit") - Svedit is a proper noun
  - ✓ "Document-scoped commands" (not "Document-Scoped Commands")
  - ✓ "Create a new user" (not "Create a New User")
  - ✓ "API reference" (not "API Reference")
- This applies to: markdown headings, JSDoc comments, inline comments, commit messages

## Architecture

Svedit is a rich content editor template built with Svelte 5 that uses a graph-based data model.

### Core Components

**Document Model:**
- `Document` - Central document class with state management, transactions, and history
- `Tras` - Handles atomic operations on the document
- Documents are represented as graphs of nodes with properties and references

**Selection System:**
- Supports text, node, and property selections
- Maps between internal selection model and DOM selection
- Handles complex selection scenarios like backwards selections and multi-node selections

**Key Components:**
- `Svedit.svelte` - Main editor component with event handling and selection management
- `NodeArrayProperty.svelte` - Renders containers that hold sequences of nodes
- `Node.svelte` - Wrapper component for document nodes that handles node gap placement and viewport culling
- `AnnotatedTextProperty.svelte` - Handles annotated text rendering and editing
- Node components (`Story`, `List`, etc.) - Render specific content types

### Schema System

Content is defined through schemas that specify:
- Node types and their properties
- Property types: `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `string_array`, `annotated_text`, `node`, `node_array`
- Reference relationships between nodes
- Default types for node arrays

### Data Flow

1. Raw document data is loaded into `Session`
2. Changes are made through transactions for undo/redo support
3. Selection state is synchronized between internal model and DOM
4. Components render content based on document state and schema definitions
