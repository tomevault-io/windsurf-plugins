- For any user-visible feature, fix, dependency, or behavior change, require an entry in the active unreleased section.
- Keep the unreleased heading in release-ready format: `## <current-version> (unreleased)`.
- Group changelog entries under `### Added`, `### Fixed`, `### Changed`, or `### Dependencies`.
