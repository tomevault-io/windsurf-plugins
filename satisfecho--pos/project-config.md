# Git: `development` vs `master` (essential)

Routine work targets **`development`**, not **`master`**. **`master`** tracks what is ready for **production** (e.g. deploy to amvara9 from `master`).

## Sync before you change anything (multi-agent)

Several agents (and humans) push to **`development`**. Treat **“get latest”** as **`git fetch` + `git pull --rebase`** on **`development`**, not as opening a GitHub pull request for every sync.

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Before the first edit** in a session or agent step (code, task files, changelog) | Run **`./scripts/git-sync-development.sh`** from repo root (or equivalent: `git fetch origin`, checkout **`development`**, `git pull --rebase --autostash origin development`). |
| **Before `git push`** | Pull/rebase again on **`development`** so your push is based on the current remote tip. |
| **Orchestrator** | **`agents/pos-agent-loop.sh`** runs the sync script **at the start of each step** (log reviewer, feature coder, coder, tester, closer, committer). Disable with **`AGENT_GIT_SYNC=0`** only for offline or special cases. |

If sync fails (merge conflict after rebase, no network), **stop** and resolve; do not layer new commits on a stale tree.

## Where to commit and push

1. **Branch:** Check out **`development`** before starting work. If it does not exist locally:  
   `git fetch origin && git checkout -b development origin/development`  
   (or create **`development`** from **`master`** and push if the remote branch does not exist yet.)
2. **Commits:** Make commits on **`development`** (or a short-lived branch that merges back into **`development`** first).
3. **Push after work:** Push **`development`** to **`origin`**:  
   `git push origin development`  
   Do **not** routinely push only to **`master`** for normal fixes and features.

## When `development` may be merged into `master` (and `master` pushed)

Merge **`development` → `master`** (fast-forward or merge commit, per team habit) **only** when **at least one** of these holds:

| Trigger | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **~2-hour cadence** | Batch promotion: roughly every **two hours**, integrate tested work from **`development`** into **`master`** and push (human operator or scheduled job — not every single commit). |
| **Big production change** | Large or high-risk change that **must** go live soon: security fixes, data-integrity fixes, payment/order critical paths, migrations that block deploy, multi-tenant outages, or similarly material production impact. State that in the PR/commit message or task. |
| **Urgent / production in issue** | The linked **GitHub issue** (or explicit user instruction) says **urgent**, **hotfix**, **production**, **deploy now**, or equivalent — then merging to **`master`** immediately is allowed. Prefer label **`production-urgent`** on the issue when applicable. |

If none of the above applies, **stop after pushing `development`**; do **not** merge to **`master`**.

## Agents and the committer role

- **Coder / tester / closer:** Work on **`development`**; never assume **`master`** must be updated the same hour.
- **Committer / changelog:** Commit on **`development`** and **`git push origin development`**. Merge to **`master`** only per the table above.
- **When the user says “push”** (no other qualifier): push **`development`**, not a blind push of whatever branch is current — if you are on **`master`**, switch back to **`development`** for ongoing work after any allowed **`master`** promotion.

## Conflicts with other instructions

If anything else suggests “always push **master**” for every change, **this rule wins** for branch choice and promotion timing, except when the **user explicitly** asks to merge or release to production now.
