# Frontend – Run Headless Smoke Test

When you change code under `front/` (Angular app):

1. **After your changes**, run a quick headless-browser smoke test so the app is still working.
2. Use the project’s existing Puppeteer scripts. From the repo root, with the app reachable (e.g. via Docker on 4202):
   - **Quick smoke:** `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 npm run test:landing-version --prefix front` (Puppeteer is headless by default; use `HEADLESS=0` to watch.)
   - Or another fast script such as `test:landing-provider-links` or a test that touches the area you changed (e.g. `test:working-plan` for working-plan changes).
3. If the test fails, fix the cause before considering the change done.
4. Review the frontend logs for errors and warnings; fix them before considering the change done.

This keeps regressions from frontend edits from going unnoticed.
