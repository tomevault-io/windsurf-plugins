# Commit: Changelog, Docs, and Version Bump

When the user says **"commit"** (or asks to commit changes):

1. **Review and update** before committing:
   - **CHANGELOG.md** — Ensure `[Unreleased]` reflects the current changes; move items to a new version section if cutting a release.
   - **README.md** — Update if the change affects setup, usage, or documented behavior.
   - **docs/** — Scan relevant `.md` files (e.g. feature docs, deployment, troubleshooting) and update any that are affected by the change.

2. **Version bump** when the changelog has **substantial or important changes**:
   - "Reasonable size" = multiple items under Unreleased, or user-visible fixes/features.
   - Bump in `front/package.json` and `front/package-lock.json` (this repo’s source of version).
   - Add a new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section in CHANGELOG.md with the entries being released; clear or reduce `[Unreleased]` accordingly.

3. **If in doubt** whether to bump: prefer bumping when there are user-facing fixes or features; skip for trivial or internal-only tweaks unless the user asks for a release.

4. **Branching:** Changelog commits belong on **`development`** by default. Promoting those commits to **`master`** follows **`.cursor/rules/git-development-branch-workflow.mdc`** (not every “commit” implies an immediate **`master`** push).
