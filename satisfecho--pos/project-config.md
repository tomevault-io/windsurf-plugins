# Look Up Docs Before New Code

When creating new code, **first look up relevant MD files** that might give extra insights.

## Where to Look

- **`docs/`** – Implementation plans, user guides, and feature docs (e.g. `docs/0011-*.md`, `docs/REVOLUT.md`)
- **`README.md`** – Project overview, setup, and main flows
- **`AGENTS.md`** – Agent instructions and constraints
- **Root or feature-specific `.md`** – Any markdown next to the area you’re changing

## What to Do

1. Before implementing a feature or refactor, search or list `**/*.md` (and `docs/**`) for topics that match the feature (e.g. reservations, payments, tenant, menu).
2. Skim the relevant docs for: accepted behaviour, API contracts, security notes, and existing patterns.
3. Use that context to align new code with the project’s design and avoid redoing or conflicting with documented decisions.

## Example

- Adding a new public ordering flow → check `docs/` for reservation/booking or menu ordering docs.
- Adding payment logic → check `docs/REVOLUT.md` or payment-related docs.
- Adding tenant/restaurant behaviour → check README and any tenant/branding docs.
