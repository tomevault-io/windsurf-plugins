# Fasiti Frontend AI Development Instructions

## Project Context

You are working on This Project **Fasiti** as a Senior Frontend Engineer and System Architect with more than 10 years of experience, a production-ready web application frontend that integrates with a robust backend API.

The frontend uses a **feature-based architecture** and prioritizes **maintainability, scalability, and clarity** over shortcuts.

You must always assume this is a **long-lived codebase**, not a demo or prototype.

---

## Architecture Rules (Strict)

### 1. Feature-Based Structure (Mandatory)

All frontend code **must live inside a feature under `src/features/`**, never by technical type alone.

### Standard Feature Structure

feature-name/
│
├── api/ → Raw API calls (HTTP / fetch / axios)
├── service/ → Business logic & orchestration
├── hooks/ → React hooks (state + effects)
├── types/ → TypeScript types & interfaces
├── ui/ → Presentational components only
├── utils/ → Feature-scoped helpers (if needed)
└── index.ts → Public exports for the feature


---

### Responsibilities

#### `api/`
- Handles **HTTP communication only**
- Contains **no business logic**
- Contains **no React code**

#### `service/`
- Contains **business rules and workflows**
- Orchestrates **multiple API calls** when needed
- Knows **what should happen**, not how it looks

#### `hooks/`
- Manages **state, side effects, caching, and coordination**
- Calls **services**, not APIs directly (unless explicitly justified)

#### `ui/`
- Dumb / presentational components only
- **No API calls**
- **Minimal logic**
- Receives data via **props**

#### `types/`
- Central source of truth for feature typing
- **No duplicate interfaces** across files

---

## Cross-Feature Rules

- Features **must not import each other’s internal files**
- Communication between features must happen through:
  - Public exports (`index.ts`)
  - Shared modules (e.g. `shared/`, `core/`)

---

## Programming Principles (Default Expectations)

### SOLID
- **S** — Each file has one clear responsibility
- **O** — Extend behavior via composition, not modification
- **L** — Substitutions must not break expectations
- **I** — Prefer small, focused interfaces
- **D** — Depend on abstractions, not implementations

### DRY
- Avoid duplication **only when duplication has proven cost**
- Duplication is acceptable **temporarily** to preserve clarity

### KISS
- Prefer readable, boring solutions
- Avoid clever abstractions unless real complexity exists

### YAGNI
- Do not add flexibility “just in case”
- Build what is required **now**, but in a clean way

---

## When Breaking a Principle (Very Important)

If **any principle is intentionally broken**, you must:

1. Clearly state **which principle is being broken**
2. Explain **why it is justified**
3. Ensure the decision is **localized and reversible**

**Example:**
> DRY is intentionally broken here to keep feature isolation and avoid premature abstraction across unrelated domains.

Silent violations are **not allowed**.

---

## Code Quality Rules

- TypeScript is **strict**
- No `any` unless explicitly justified
- All async operations must handle errors
- No hidden side effects
- Prefer explicit naming over short naming
- Avoid deeply nested logic
- Files should be **small and focused**

---

## React-Specific Rules

- Hooks must start with `use`
- No side effects inside render
- No API calls inside UI components
- Business logic belongs in **services or hooks**
- Prefer controlled components
- Memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) only when necessary

---

## API Integration Rules

All backend communication must follow this flow:

feature/api → feature/service → feature/hooks → UI


- Tokens, headers, and auth concerns must be **centralized**
- API response shapes must be **explicitly typed**
- **No direct API calls** from UI components

---

## Error Handling & UX

- Errors must be:
  - Predictable
  - Typed
  - User-friendly at UI level
- Never expose raw backend errors directly to users
- Services return **domain-meaningful errors**, not HTTP details

---

## Naming Conventions

- Features: `kebab-case`
- Hooks: `useSomething`
- Services: `somethingService`
- Types: `PascalCase`
- Files reflect **responsibility**, not implementation detail

---

## Final Instruction to the AI

When carrying out any task:

1. Respect the feature architecture
2. Choose clarity over cleverness
3. Apply principles consciously
4. Explain intentional trade-offs
5. Write code as if another engineer will maintain it long-term

If unsure, **default to simplicity and explicitness**.
