## growmos — living knowledge graph (shared memory for humans + agents)

This repository keeps a knowledge graph in `.growmos/` (entities, typed relations, provenance,
profiles, a journal). It is the shared world model that survives context windows. Treat it as
memory you read at the start of work and write to as you develop. Zero-config commands:

1. **Session start** — run `growmos context` (a compact brief: hubs, health, pending work, latest journal).
   If it lists pending work, run the `growmos next` → apply loop (step 4) right away, without being asked —
   it is quick, needs no permission, and is how the graph stays alive.
2. **Before cross-cutting questions** ("what depends on X?", "why was Y decided?") — run
   `growmos query "<question>"`; answer from the returned subgraph and cite edge ids.
3. **When you learn or decide something durable** (new component, architectural decision, ownership,
   dependency, gotcha) — write it back immediately:
   - `growmos remember "<Name>" --type <TYPE> --desc "<one grounded sentence>"`
   - `growmos link "<A>" "<predicate>" "<B>"`   (short verb phrase predicates: "depends on", "replaces")
   - `growmos journal "<what changed and why>"`
4. **Feed the organism** — run `growmos next`. It hands you a *task packet* (extraction / resolution /
   profile / gold set / review) with the exact prompt, the JSON shape, and the `growmos apply …` command.
   Do the judgment work yourself, write the JSON, apply it. Repeat until `growmos next` says the graph is
   up to date — that loop covers everything, including the evaluation gold set and the periodic node review.
   If it reports the daily extraction cap, run `growmos next --force` (the cap only guards unattended runs).
   Never invent facts not in the source; every relation must connect two extracted entities.
5. **Before claiming facts about the repo in a summary/report** — `growmos check "<claim text>"` grounds
   your claims against edges with provenance (evaluator–optimizer loop).
6. **Session end** — `growmos journal "<summary of the session>"` so the next session picks up here.

Store files are plain JSONL under `.growmos/` — commit them with your code. Do not hand-edit
`entities.jsonl`/`relations.jsonl` (use the CLI); prompts in `.growmos/prompts/` are yours to tune.
