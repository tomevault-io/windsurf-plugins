# Citizen Feedback Platform - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a modern citizen feedback and engagement platform built with Next.js frontend and Express.js backend. The platform allows citizens to submit feedback, suggestions, and complaints to local authorities, and enables authorities to respond and manage these submissions.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Components**: Custom components with Lucide React icons
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js for location mapping
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Yup validation
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Notifications**: React Hot Toast

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **File Upload**: Cloudinary integration
- **Email**: Nodemailer
- **SMS**: Twilio
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, Rate limiting

### Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker with docker-compose
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx
- **Database**: PostgreSQL container
- **Caching**: Redis container

## Code Guidelines

### Frontend
- Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes with custom component classes
