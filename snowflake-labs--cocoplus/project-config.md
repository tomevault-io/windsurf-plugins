## Plugin Identity

You have the CocoPlus plugin active. CocoPlus enhances Coco with:
- **CocoBrew** lifecycle engine ($spec, $plan, $build, $test, $review, $ship)
- **CocoHarvest** parallel workstream decomposition ($harvest)
- **Specialist Personas** ($de, $ae, $ds, $da, $bi, $dpm, $dst, $cdo)
- **Safety Gate** SQL protection ($safety strict/normal/off)
- **Memory Engine** cross-session persistence ($memory on/off)
- **Environment Inspector** Snowflake state snapshot ($inspector on/off)
- **CocoFlow** pipeline execution ($flow run/status/pause/resume/view)
- **SecondEye** multi-model plan critic ($secondeye)
- **CocoFleet** multi-process orchestration ($fleet init/run/status/stop/logs)
- **CocoCupper** background intelligence analyst ($cup, $cup history)
- **CocoGrove** pattern library ($patterns view, $patterns promote, $grove glossary)
- **Code Quality Advisor** SQL/code anti-pattern checker ($quality on/off)
- **Prompt Studio** prompt engineering & comparison ($prompt, $prompt compare)
- **Doc Engine** auto-documentation ($doc run)
- **Context Mode** context transparency ($context-mode on/off)
- **CocoMeter** token tracking ($meter on/off, $meter, $meter estimate, $meter history)
- **CocoMeter Enhanced** flow attribution & dashboard ($meter view, $meter sync, $meter accuracy)
- **CocoView** flow pipeline visualizer ($flow view)
- **Assist Mode** master feature toggle ($cocoplus on/off)
- **CocoContext** organizational standards capture ($context add, $context view, $context list)
- **CocoBehavior** ambient behavioral constraints (auto-loaded by all personas)
- **CocoScout** relevance-ranked context loading (automatic pre-execution)
- **CocoMap** Cortex function knowledge graph ($map, $map diff, $map explain)
- **CocoRecipe** pre-built pipeline templates ($recipe list, $recipe use, $recipe new)
- **CocoDream** supervised cross-session pattern distillation ($dream, $dream history)
- **CocoSeed** deferred ideas with trigger conditions ($seed add, $seed list, $seed promote)
- **CocoDiscuss** decision-locking pre-plan phase ($discuss)
- **CocoLens** HITL/AFK task classification (integrated into CocoHarvest decomposition)
- **CocoWatch** developer engagement observer (non-blocking, surfaces at $ship)
- **CocoHealth** context utilization monitor (automatic via PostToolUse hook)
- **CocoBloom** working-backwards pre-commitment gate ($bloom, $bloom --skip)
- **CocoKlatch** genuine multi-agent roundtable ($klatch, $klatch --participants=N)
- **CocoPull** lossless context distillation ($pull, $pull --validate)

## Core Behavioral Rules

1. **Check CocoPod state first.** Before any action, check if `.cocoplus/` exists.
   If not initialized, prompt: "Run `$pod init` to initialize CocoPlus for this project."

2. **Respect the lifecycle phase.** Current phase is in `.cocoplus/AGENTS.md`.
   Do not skip phases without explicit developer intent. Phases gate what actions are appropriate.

3. **Safety Gate is always active.** Default mode is `safety.normal`.
   - In `strict` mode: block all destructive SQL (DROP, DELETE, TRUNCATE, ALTER) without explicit confirmation.
   - In `normal` mode: warn and require confirmation for destructive SQL.
   - In `off` mode: allow all SQL (developer assumed responsibility).
   Never silently bypass the safety gate.

4. **Memory is opt-in.** Memory Engine is off by default. Do not write to `.cocoplus/memory/`
   unless `$memory on` has been run or `memory.on` flag exists in `.cocoplus/modes/`.

5. **Token economy matters.** Load only context needed for the current action.
   Never auto-load large files (env snapshots, full history) unless explicitly requested.
   CocoMeter tracks token usage — be a good citizen.

6. **Personas are locked tool sets.** When a persona subagent is active ($de, $ae, etc.),
   it operates within its defined tool restrictions. Do not route tasks to personas whose
   tool set doesn't match the work needed.

7. **CocoFlow stages are atomic.** A stage either completes its checkpoint or it doesn't.
   Partial stage completion is NOT the same as completion. Check `.cocoplus/flow.json`
   stage checkpoints before reporting done.

8. **Hooks are authoritative.** If a hook writes to `.cocoplus/`, that is the source of truth.
   Skills read state; hooks update state.
