# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Global Coding Rules

- Default to real, executable code rather than pseudocode.
- Do not provide pseudocode unless explicitly requested.
- For any programming language, default to production-style, maintainable implementations.
- When giving code examples, prefer runnable code with clear structure, maintainable naming, and practical error handling where appropriate.
- If an example is illustrative and cannot run as-is, explicitly state what is omitted and why.

## General Engineering Lessons

- Do not treat "real-world sample passes" as sufficient verification for parser, serializer, markdown, formatting, or round-trip fixes.
- For any text-rewrite, markdown, parser, serializer, or round-trip bugfix, always define explicit invariants before changing code:
  - what must be fixed
  - what must remain unchanged
  - what contexts are allowed to trigger the rewrite
  - what contexts must never trigger the rewrite
- Assume any regex-based formatting fix can overmatch until proven otherwise.
- If a fix changes syntax-sensitive text, review it as if it were parsing code, not just cleaning strings.

## Required Test Strategy For Text/Format Fixes

- For parser, markdown, serializer, round-trip, escaping, and formatting fixes, always add all three categories of tests:
  - positive cases: prove the reported bug is fixed
  - negative cases: prove nearby literal text is not accidentally rewritten
  - contextual cases: prove the rewrite only happens when structural context is valid
- Near-miss counterexamples are mandatory. Do not wait for code review to supply them.
- When fixing delimiter-sensitive logic, always add tests for ambiguous literal inputs such as math-like, prose-like, or partially formatted text.
- When fixing indentation-sensitive logic, always add tests for:
  - true nested structure
  - top-level content that only looks nested
  - blank-line-separated edge cases

## Required Review Heuristics For Regex Or Rewrite Logic

- Before submitting any regex-based fix, explicitly check:
  - Can the pattern consume delimiter characters that should remain literal?
  - Can it trigger inside a larger delimiter pair?
  - Can two passes interact and create a false positive that neither pass creates alone?
  - Does it rely on local syntax when the real condition is structural context?
- If a rewrite depends on nesting, hierarchy, or surrounding structure, do not key it off the current line alone; inspect the nearest meaningful context.
- Prefer the narrowest possible transformation that satisfies the invariant.
- If the fix starts accumulating more and more regex exceptions, stop and consider a parser/tokenizer-level approach.

## Review And PR Discipline

- External code review comments must be technically verified, not blindly accepted and not emotionally resisted.
- If a review comment identifies a valid edge case, convert it into a regression test before or alongside the code change.
- For bugfix PRs, include a short root-cause statement and explicitly call out any unrelated existing test failures rather than hiding them.
- When a patch touches parser or formatter behavior, add a short note in the PR description about:
  - the exact false positive avoided
  - the exact structural case normalized
  - the boundaries intentionally left unchanged

## Imported Karpathy-Inspired Rules

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

Tradeoff: These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

Do not assume. Do not hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them. Do not pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what is confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No flexibility or configurability that was not requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what must be touched. Clean up only changes caused by the current work.

When editing existing code:

- Do not improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Do not refactor things that are not broken.
- Match existing style, even if a different style seems preferable.
- If unrelated dead code is noticed, mention it instead of deleting it.

When changes create orphans:

- Remove imports, variables, and functions made unused by the current changes.
- Do not remove pre-existing dead code unless explicitly asked.

Every changed line should trace directly to the request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" means write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass.
