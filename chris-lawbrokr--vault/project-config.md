## Key Terminology

These terms have been renamed in the codebase but may appear under old names:

| UI Name | Code Name | What it is |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Funnel | Campaign | Multi-step lead capture flow |
| Workflow | Journey | Automated lead follow-up sequence |
| Marketing Source | Source | Where a lead came from |

## Repositories

- **storefront** — Main Rails app (`/Users/chriskinsman/Documents/GitHub/storefront`)
- **justice-sync** — FastAPI AI backend
- **justice-frontend** — Next.js AI chat frontend
- **chrome-extension** — Chrome browser extension
- **figmatoreact** — Component library prototype (`https://github.com/chris-lawbrokr/figmatoreact`)

## Diagrams

When creating diagrams or charts in this vault, always use **Mermaid** syntax embedded in markdown files. Never use `.canvas`, `.drawio`, `.d2`, or other diagram formats.

**Rules:**
- Embed diagrams as fenced `mermaid` code blocks inside `.md` files
- Use descriptive headings above each diagram
- Supported diagram types: `graph`, `sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`, `stateDiagram`, `erDiagram`, `gantt`, `pie`, `flowchart`, etc.
- Preview in VS Code with the `bierner.markdown-mermaid` extension (`Cmd+Shift+V`)
- Mermaid also renders natively on GitHub

**Example:**
````
```mermaid
graph LR
    Start -->|path 1| Process_A[Process A]
    Start -->|path 2| Process_B[Process B]
    Process_A --> Merge
    Process_B --> Merge
    Merge -->|done| End
```
````
