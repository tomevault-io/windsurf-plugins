# XFOIL Matching Rule

## Core Principle

**To match XFOIL numbers, you MUST see what XFOIL is doing internally. Do not guess.**

## Rules

1. **No guessing**: Never assume what XFOIL does. Always read the XFOIL Fortran source code first.

2. **No invented methods**: Do not add any method, cap, clamp, or workaround unless it exists in XFOIL. If RustFoil diverges and XFOIL doesn't, the bug is in RustFoil - find it, don't mask it.

3. **Dump intermediate values**: When debugging discrepancies:
   - Add instrumentation to XFOIL to dump the relevant intermediate values
   - Add instrumentation to RustFoil to dump the same values
   - Compare them directly to find where divergence begins

4. **Match formulas exactly**: Every formula in RustFoil must match XFOIL exactly:
   - Same coefficients
   - Same order of operations
   - Same edge cases and limits
   - Same variable names where possible (for traceability)

5. **Verify with XFOIL source**: Before implementing or fixing anything, find the corresponding code in:
   - `/Xfoil-instrumented/src/xbl.f` - boundary layer routines
   - `/Xfoil-instrumented/src/xoper.f` - viscous operations
   - `/Xfoil-instrumented/src/xpanel.f` - panel methods

## Debugging Workflow

1. Identify the discrepancy (e.g., "ctau diverges at station 63")
2. Find the XFOIL code that computes that value
3. Add debug output to XFOIL at that location
4. Run XFOIL and capture the intermediate values
5. Add equivalent debug output to RustFoil
6. Compare step-by-step until you find the first divergence
7. Fix RustFoil to match XFOIL exactly

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ "Let me cap this value to prevent divergence"
- ❌ "Let me add a safeguard for numerical stability"
- ❌ "XFOIL probably does X, so let me implement that"
- ❌ "This seems reasonable based on physics"

## Correct Approach

- ✅ "Let me check what XFOIL does in xbl.f line 1568"
- ✅ "XFOIL uses DN1 = DCTAU / CTAU(IBL,IS), let me verify RustFoil matches"
- ✅ "I'll add DBGTRANSITION to XFOIL and compare with RustFoil output"
