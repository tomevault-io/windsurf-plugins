# PR-to-Main Requirements

Every pull request that targets `main` **must** satisfy the three gates below before it can be opened. Treat these as blocking — do not create the PR until all are done.

## 1. Update "What's New"

The in-app changelog lives in `flexfoil-ui/src/lib/version.ts` (the `CHANGELOG` array).

- If the current top entry's `version` already matches the release being prepared, **append** new items to that entry.
- Otherwise, **add a new entry** at index 0 with the next version, today's date, and the items.
- Every user-visible change in the PR must have a corresponding `{ category, text }` item. Use the correct category:
  - `added` — wholly new feature or capability
  - `changed` — enhancement or modification to existing behavior
  - `fixed` — bug fix
- Keep descriptions concise (one sentence, no period).

## 2. Bump Distribution Versions

All version numbers **must** stay in sync with the changelog's latest entry.

| File | Field | Must match |
|------|-------|------------|
| `flexfoil-ui/package.json` | `"version"` | Top `CHANGELOG` entry version (drives `__APP_VERSION__` via Vite) |
| `packages/flexfoil-python/pyproject.toml` | `version` | Bump if the PR touches **anything** in `packages/flexfoil-python/`, `crates/rustfoil-python/`, solver behavior, or the WASM bridge. Skip only if the PR is purely UI cosmetic. |

- Use semver: bump **patch** for fixes, **minor** for new features, **major** for breaking changes.
- The `package.json` version and the top `CHANGELOG` entry version must always be identical after the PR.
- When in doubt about whether the Python package needs a bump, bump it — users should always be able to `pip install --upgrade flexfoil` to get the latest solver/API changes.

## 3. Keep Documentation in Sync

The docs site lives in `docs-site/docs/` (Docusaurus `.mdx` files).

- If the PR adds, changes, or removes **any** solver behavior, UI feature, API surface, or configuration option, the corresponding doc page must be created or updated in the same PR.
- Docs must reflect the **actual** implementation — no aspirational or outdated content. If existing docs reference behavior that the PR changes, update those docs.
- New major features need their own doc page added to `docs-site/docs/`.

## PR Authoring Checklist

When drafting the PR description, include this checklist (filled in):

```markdown
## Changelog, Versions & Docs
- [ ] `flexfoil-ui/src/lib/version.ts` CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] All user-visible changes have a changelog entry
- [ ] `flexfoil-ui/package.json` version matches top CHANGELOG entry
- [ ] `packages/flexfoil-python/pyproject.toml` version bumped (if applicable)
