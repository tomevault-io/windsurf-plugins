# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains custom Claude skills—modular packages that extend
Claude's capabilities with specialized workflows and domain knowledge. Skills
are used with both Claude Code (CLI) and Claude.ai (web/mobile/desktop).

## Build Commands

```bash
# Package a single skill for Claude.ai upload
python build.py <skill-name>

# Package all skills
python build.py --all

# List available skills with validation status
python build.py --list
```

Output: `.skill` files in `dist/` (ZIP archives with skill contents)

## Architecture

### Skill Structure

Each skill is a top-level folder containing:

```
<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: instructions + YAML frontmatter
├── references/           # Optional: documentation loaded on-demand
└── assets/               # Optional: templates, examples
```

### SKILL.md Requirements

Must start with YAML frontmatter:

- `name` (required): skill identifier
- `description` (required, min 20 chars): determines when the skill activates

### Build System

`build.py` validates skills and packages them as ZIP archives:

- Validates YAML frontmatter presence and required fields
- Excludes hidden files, `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__`
- Creates `<skill-name>.skill` in `dist/`

Requires: `pyyaml` (for frontmatter parsing)

### Usage Modes

**Claude Code**: Reference skills directly via filesystem paths in project
`CLAUDE.md` or global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

**Claude.ai**: Upload packaged `.skill` files via Settings → Skills

## Templates

The `templates/` directory contains document templates and guides for
configuring Claude Code:
