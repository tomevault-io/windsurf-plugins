# Cy development guidelines for AI agents

Read `README.md` for general information about the project, as well as all READMEs in subdirectories except `lib/` if you see any.

The library sources are under the `cy/` directory; everything else is ancillary. The `lib/` directory contains dependencies and generally there is no need to look there.

The library code must be fully portable between different architectures and compilers, from baremetal to POSIX, from 8-bit to 64-bit.

You must read all source and documentation files in their entirety instead of using search tools for best context awareness.

Update docs/examples when public API behavior changes.

Do not git commit unless explicitly asked to.

When working with the CI, be aware that commits that contain `#yolo` run only the faster subset of CI jobs, which can be used to speed up the work.

When implementing nontrivial changes or refactoring, always run the full test suite with static analysis enabled afterward.

## Project structure

- `cy/`: the library itself, which is transport-agnostic and platform-agnostic.
- `tests/`: the test suite; refer to its own README.
- `examples/`: runnable demos.
- `lib/`: all external dependencies for the library itself, for the test suite, and for the demos.
- `model/`: formal protocol models. Read it to understand the protocol, esp. READMEs & notebooks.
- `tools/`: various utilities useful for development, validation, and verification.
- `papers/`: relevant publications and prior art.

If you need a build directory, create one named with the `build` prefix. Do not use `cmake-build-*`, these are for CLion.

## Style conventions

- Language targets: C99+ for Cy, C11 and C++20 for the test harness. Strict std only, compiler extensions not allowed.
- Naming patterns: `cy_*` functions, `cy_*_t` types, `CY_*` macros. Internal definitions need no prefixing. Enums and constants are `lower_snake_case`. Uppercase only for macros.
- Keep code very compact.
- DO NOT COMMENT THE CODE unless comments add critical information that is impossible to infer from reading the code (design rationale, gotchas, etc), in which case extremely terse comments are allowed.
- Treat warnings as errors and keep compatibility with strict warning flags.
- Module entities are prefixed with the module name; e.g., `foo.h` contains `foo_bar`, `foo_baz_t`, `FOO_QUX`. Module-local statics must not be prefixed to keep things brief.

## Adversarial validation and verification

Practice an adversarial approach to testing: the purpose of a test case is not to provide coverage, but to empirically prove correctness of the tested code. Always treat the code as suspect; you will be rewarded for pointing out flaws in it. If the code does not appear to be correct, refuse to test it and provide evidence of its defects instead of proceeding with testing.

When using subagents to implement tests, always instruct them to summarize their findings concerning the correctness of the tested code and its possible limitations at the end of their run. At the end of the turn, provide a summary of the findings.

## Review loop

Use `.claude/skills/review-loop` upon completion of each deliverable.
Iterate until three consecutive no-major-findings iterations.
