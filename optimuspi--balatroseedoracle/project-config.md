# Do not run Motely

- **Never** run Motely: no `dotnet run` on Motely.CLI, Motely.WASM, or any Motely project.
- **Never** build Motely for the purpose of executing it (e.g. no "run a search to verify").
- You may **build** the solution (e.g. `dotnet build BalatroSeedOracle.sln`) to verify compile errors.
- You may **read**, **edit**, and **analyze** Motely code; do not execute it.

Reason: Executing Motely (especially long-running search) consumes large amounts of tokens/time; keep changes to code-only unless the user explicitly asks to run something.
