# Project rules

- Write all project documentation in English, including README files, technical notes, project instructions, and any new or updated documentation.
- The user handles all Git operations exclusively. Do not run any Git commands or use APIs or other tools to perform Git operations. This includes reading status, diffs, and history, as well as init, add/staging, commit, push, pull, fetch, checkout, branch management, and configuration changes. Do not create, modify, or delete the `.git` directory or its contents.
- The untouched historical source archive is `resources/elite_atarist_source.zip`. Preserve its bytes. At the user's explicit request, `src_orig` is now an independently buildable conversion of that archive, replacing the former raw extraction. Maintain original gameplay there; do not import gameplay changes from the enhanced versions.
- Atari source code belongs in `src_atari`; the independent Amiga source code belongs in `src_amiga`. Do not share platform switches or build imports between the two trees.
- New gameplay changes belong in `src_atari` or `src_amiga`, not in the preserved original version. Build/conversion compatibility fixes may be made in `src_orig` without changing its original gameplay.
- Keep the project root tidy: do not place loose generated or temporary files there. Intermediate files and logs belong in the target source tree's `build` directory. Atari distribution files belong in `output_atari` (`output_atari/ELITE` and `output_atari/ELITE.ST`); Amiga distribution files belong in `output_amiga` (`output_amiga/ELITE` and `output_amiga/ELITE.ADF`); preserved original distribution files belong in `output_orig` (`output_orig/ELITE` and `output_orig/ELITE.ST`). Run the assembler and linker with a working directory under the corresponding source tree and an explicit `-o` output path, including when trying out the tools, so a default `a.out` is never created in the root.
- The root `tools` directory contains the bundled Windows vasm assembler and vlink linker executables and their license information. The build uses these tools by default; their rebuild scripts and sources remain under `src_atari`. All three game builds use the bundled executables.
- The root `build_atari.bat` forwards Atari build arguments to `src_atari`; `build_amiga.bat` forwards Amiga build arguments to `src_amiga`; `build_orig.bat` forwards original-version build arguments to `src_orig`. Each tree owns its build logic. There is no `platform=` build option.
