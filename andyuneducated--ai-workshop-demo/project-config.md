# Workshops (vibe coding)

## Repo layout

| Path | Use |
|------|-----|
| `play/` | Default for new spikes, scripts, disposable demos |
| `grow/` | Longer-lived mini-apps promoted from `play/` |
| `stash/` | Paused WIP |
| `refs/` | Copied reference snippets, not first-class product code |
| `_archive/` | Retired experiments |

Unless the user names another path, **create new experiments under `play/`**.

## Editing discipline

- **Minimal diffs**: only what the task needs; no drive-by refactors or unrelated files.
- **Match locals**: naming, imports, types, formatting, and comment density already in touched files.
- **Docs**: do not add README or other markdown the user did not ask for.
- **Secrets**: never commit real credentials; use `.env` locally and `.env.example` when a template helps.

## Verification

If the subproject defines checks (`package.json`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.), run the appropriate lint/test/build after non-trivial edits. If nothing exists, skip.

## Language

Use the same natural language as the user for that turn (中文 ↔ English).
