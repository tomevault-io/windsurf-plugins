# NERO Chain Docs — Cursor Rules

When working on this repository (or on a dApp that targets NERO Chain), prefer these canonical sources:

- Docs site: https://docs.nerochain.io
- Full docs corpus (machine-readable): https://docs.nerochain.io/llms-full.txt
- Site index: https://docs.nerochain.io/site-index.json
- Paymaster OpenAPI: https://docs.nerochain.io/specs/paymaster-openapi.yaml
- MCP server: https://docs-mcp.nerochain.io
- AI resources hub: https://docs.nerochain.io/en/ai-resources

## Writing content

- Pages live in `pages/en/` and `pages/ja/` with mirrored structure. Translate new EN pages into JA.
- Each directory has a `_meta.ts` that controls sidebar order and titles. Update it when adding pages.
- Use absolute internal links: `/en/developer-tools/paymaster-api/...`.
- Images go in `/public/assets/...` and are referenced as `/assets/...` in MDX.
- Keep MDX JSX minimal: `PageFeedback` is auto-inserted, `<Tabs>` is fine. Avoid new components unless necessary.
- Lead with positive framing — state what something IS, not what it isn't (global style rule).

## Editing code

- Yarn 3.8.3 Berry with `nodeLinker: node-modules`. Use `yarn`, not `npm`.
- `yarn build` runs `next build` then `node scripts/build-agent-artifacts.mjs`. Both must pass.
- After editing MDX, run `yarn build && yarn validate:agent-ready` to ensure llms.txt and friends stay in sync.

## NERO protocol facts (do not invent, verify before citing)

- EntryPoint address: `0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789`
- Native token: NERO
- AA Platform dashboard: https://aa-platform.nerochain.io
- Paymaster payment types: 0 = sponsored (free), 1 = prepay ERC-20, 2 = postpay ERC-20
- Paymaster JSON-RPC methods: `pm_supported_tokens`, `pm_sponsor_userop`, `pm_entrypoints`

For any other protocol fact, read the MDX under `pages/en/core-concepts/` or `pages/en/developer-tools/` before answering.
