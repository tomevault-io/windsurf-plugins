# Core Governance

- Read `AGENTS.md` first; treat it as the canonical cross-agent instruction source.
- Do not suggest changes that contradict `ARCHITECTURE.md` or durable decisions recorded in `.ai/memory.md` unless you explicitly flag the conflict.
- If intent is ambiguous, surface uncertainty explicitly rather than guessing silently.
- Keep changes scoped and focused; prefer updating enforcement through CI/hooks over adding verbose prompt-only rules.
- After changing Swift sources or Swift lint/format tooling (`.swiftlint.yml`, `.swiftformat`, `Mintfile`, `Brewfile`, `scripts/pre-commit`, `scripts/bootstrap`), run the same checks as `.github/workflows/swift_quality.yml` locally — see **`AGENTS.md` → Workflow → Swift quality (local parity with CI)**.
