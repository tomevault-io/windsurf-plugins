# Swift Implementation

- Follow `CONVENTIONS.md` for naming, architecture boundaries, error handling, and **design system** (`Brew/Theme/` — see `design-system.mdc` when editing `Brew/**/*.swift`).
- Do not share object instances unless shared state is required and concurrency-safe; see `instance-lifecycle.mdc` (`JSONDecoder`, formatters, etc.).
- Keep `Codable` transport models behind boundaries; do not expose `*JSON`/DTO wire types from service or repository APIs (see `codable-boundary.mdc`).
- Include required imports and provide compilable code updates.
- Use `@MainActor` where UI state is mutated.
- Avoid force unwraps/`try!`; use safe handling patterns and test helpers (`#require`, `XCTUnwrap`) in tests.
- Keep SwiftUI views passive: do not combine multiple ViewModel flags inline to drive one UI presentation decision. Add a single derived ViewModel property (or item) and bind the view to that.
- When a ViewModel grows with presentation mappings that mostly change together, extract them into feature-layer `*Item` types and expose those items from the ViewModel. Keep independently changing async state streams on the top-level ViewModel (for example, independent operation busy flags).
- Follow folder placement boundaries from `CONVENTIONS.md` and `.cursor/rules/folder-boundaries.mdc` (`Features/<Feature>/Views`, `Features/<Feature>/ViewModels`, command transport under `Services/BrewCommand/`, and domain-only `Models/`).
- Follow centralized preview guidance from `.cursor/rules/previews-centralized.mdc` and keep preview blocks colocated with their view files.
