# Package Domain Reference

- Any domain model that represents a Homebrew package must expose `id` typed as `HomebrewPackageID` for lookup identity.
- Use `.formula(name:)` for formula-backed models and `.cask(token:)` for cask-backed models.
- Prefer deriving `name`/display fields from `HomebrewPackageID.name` where practical to avoid duplicate identity sources.
