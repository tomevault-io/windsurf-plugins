# Folder Boundaries

- Use `Features/<Feature>/Views/` for feature views and root wrappers.
- Use `Features/<Feature>/ViewModels/` for feature view models, feature `*Item` types, and feature-scoped presentation helpers.
- Keep `Models/` domain-only. Do not place UI/presentation helpers, command/API JSON payloads, or infrastructure cache snapshots in `Models/`.
- Keep brew command transport/state and brew command JSON payload types under `Services/BrewCommand/`.
- Keep API networking transport types with the API client under one services networking boundary (for example `Services/API/`).
- Keep DB-related types grouped with DB access layer types under one DB boundary (for example `Services/Database/` or `Repositories/Database/`).
