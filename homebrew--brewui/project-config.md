# Temporal Cohesion: Wrap Co-Occurring Calls

When two or more calls always appear together at every call site, extract them into a single named function. This applies everywhere: ViewModels, actors, services, repositories, test helpers — sync or async, same type or across types.

**Why:** Repeated call sequences are brittle. Any new call site can silently omit one half. The composed name also communicates intent ("refresh relationships") rather than mechanism ("refresh dependencies, then dependents").

**Rule:**

- If `foo()` + `bar()` appear together at two or more call sites with no intervening logic that varies between sites, extract a function that calls both and replace every call site with it.
- Name the function after the **shared intent**, not after the individual operations (e.g. `refreshRelationships()`, not `refreshDependenciesAndDependents()`).
- Make the individual functions `private` where they have no independent callers — they become implementation details of the composed function. See `test-visibility.mdc` for the testing corollary.
- Do **not** collapse calls whose co-occurrence is coincidental or that carry genuinely distinct purposes at each call site. Only group when the pair represents a single coherent operation from the caller's point of view.

**Examples:**

```swift
// Before — async ViewModel
await viewModel.refreshDependencies()
await viewModel.refreshDependents()

// After
await viewModel.refreshRelationships()
```

```swift
// Before — sync setup
cache.invalidate()
cache.preload()

// After
cache.reset()
```

```swift
// Before — actor coordination
await center.submit(id: id, command: command)
await logger.record(id: id)

// After — composed on the coordinating type
await coordinator.submitAndRecord(id: id, command: command)
```
