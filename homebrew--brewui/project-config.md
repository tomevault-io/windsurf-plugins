# Do Not Expose Symbols for Test Access

Never widen the visibility of a method, property, computed var, or type beyond what production code requires just to make it reachable from a test target.

**Why:** Leaking implementation details as `internal` (or wider) under test pressure pollutes the API surface and makes future refactoring harder. Tests should exercise behaviour through the same entry points callers actually use.

**Rule:**

- If a symbol would naturally be `private` but a test wants to call it, **do not make it `internal`**. Instead, update the test to go through the public/internal method that composes it (the same surface production callers use).
- If no such composed entry point exists yet, **create one** (following the temporal cohesion rule where applicable), then test through that.
- The one permitted exception is **`init`**: initialisers may be given wider visibility than strictly needed so tests can construct types in isolation. This is standard practice and does not leak behaviour.

**Example (wrong):**

```swift
// Made internal only so tests can call it — wrong
func refreshDependencies() async { … }
func refreshDependents() async { … }
```

**Example (correct):**

```swift
// Private implementation details
private func refreshDependencies() async { … }
private func refreshDependents() async { … }

// Tests call the composed public entry point instead
func refreshRelationships() async {
    await refreshDependencies()
    await refreshDependents()
}
```
