# .cursorrules
# Cursor-specific extensions to AGENTS.md. Read AGENTS.md first.

## On Session Start
- Read `.ai/memory.md` and `.ai/progress.md` before beginning any task.
- Consult `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `.ai/memory.md` before touching structural code.

## On Session End
- Update `.ai/progress.md` with what was completed and what remains.
- If you learned something durable about the project, add it to `.ai/memory.md`.

## Editing Behaviour
- Follow all conventions in `CONVENTIONS.md`.
- Prefer targeted edits over rewrites. Do not refactor code outside the scope of the current task.
- When introducing a new pattern not covered by `CONVENTIONS.md`, add it there.

## Autocomplete & Suggestions
- Do not suggest changes that contradict `ARCHITECTURE.md` or durable decisions in `.ai/memory.md` without flagging the conflict explicitly.
- When uncertain about intent, surface the uncertainty as a comment rather than guessing silently.
