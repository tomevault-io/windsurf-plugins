# Termux TTS Skill

This skill provides text-to-speech functionality using Android's native TTS engine through Termux.

## Prerequisites

- Termux app installed
- `termux-api` package installed (`pkg install termux-api`)
- Termux:API app installed from F-Droid or Play Store

## Usage

### Basic speech

```bash
termux-tts-speak "Hello, this is a test"
```

### With options

```bash
# Speed: 0.5 (slow) to 2.0 (fast), default 1.0
termux-tts-speak -s 1.5 "Faster speech"

# Pitch: 0.5 (low) to 2.0 (high), default 1.0  
termux-tts-speak -p 0.8 "Lower pitch"

# Language (if supported by TTS engine)
termux-tts-speak -l zh-CN "中文朗读"
```

### Using the helper script

```bash
# Make executable first time
chmod +x ~/.openclaw/skills/termux-tts/scripts/tts.sh

# Use the script
~/.openclaw/skills/termux-tts/scripts/tts.sh "Text to speak"
```

## Helper Script

See `scripts/tts.sh` for a convenient wrapper with default settings optimized for Chinese speech.

## Common Issues

- **No sound**: Check volume and ensure Termux:API app is installed
- **Permission denied**: Run `termux-api` command first to establish connection
- **Wrong language**: Set system TTS language in Android Settings > Accessibility > Text-to-speech output
