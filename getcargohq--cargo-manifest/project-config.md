# Manifest guardrails (Cursor)

`AGENTS.md` at the repo root is the canonical contract and Cursor loads it
automatically. This rule restates only the hard guardrails so they survive as
an always-applied Cursor rule, matching the deploy denials Claude Code enforces
in `.claude/settings.json`.

## Never do these

- Never run `cargo-ai cdk deploy` or `cargo-ai cdk destroy` locally. Deploys
  happen from CI on merge to main only. If asked to deploy locally, refuse and
  point at the PR workflow.
- Never edit `infra/cargo.state.json` by hand or resolve its merge conflicts
  manually. It is machine-owned; re-run the plan/deploy instead.
- Never commit secret values. Secrets come from the environment via `secret()`
  and `env()`.

## Layer boundaries

- Dependency direction is strict: `infra/` reads `context/`, skills read
  everything, `outputs/` is written by everything and read only as memory.
  Nothing depends on `outputs/`.
- Put each change in its layer: knowledge in `context/`, production wiring in
  `infra/`, repo procedures in `.claude/skills/`, one-off ops in `scripts/`,
  regression suites in `evals/`, run archives in `outputs/`.
- New plays go through the `new-play` skill so context, infra, and evals ship
  together.

## Copy style

- No em dashes anywhere. Use colons, parentheses, commas, or split the sentence.

## Before a PR

- `npm run lint:context` if you touched `context/`.
- `npm run typecheck` if you touched `infra/` or `scripts/`.
- Archive any real-world result under `outputs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/` before
  finishing. Never rewrite an existing entry.
