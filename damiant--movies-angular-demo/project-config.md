- Avoid creating css or inline styles, css variables in theme/variables.css instead 
- Always use built in control flow rather than directives like *ngFor, *ngIf, etc
- Implement push change detection with components
- Use signal inputs and signals in general
- Do not use @Input()
- Avoid using rxjs
- use fetch rather than use httpclient
- Create components strategically to keep pages simple
- After code changes run the build to verify no build errors were created
- Always look for components that can be reused.
- If css is going over the budget limit consider breaking a page into components.
- Avoid using console.log
- Always use bun as the project is bun based: not npm.
