# Import Hygiene & Preview-Only Imports

## Purpose
Prevent accidental or unrequested import churn that causes build/lint issues and diffs unrelated to the task. Ensure SwiftUI is only imported where required (e.g., #Preview blocks) and avoid touching existing imports unless strictly necessary.

## Rules (Always Apply)

1. Do not change imports unless:
   - A new symbol is introduced that the compiler cannot resolve without the import
   - An existing import is provably unused and removal is part of the explicit task scope
   - The change resolves a red compiler error you introduced in this edit

2. Keep platform/framework imports minimal and local:
   - Prefer `import AppKit` for macOS UI code
   - Prefer `import UIKit` for iOS UI code
   - Do not add `import SwiftUI` to AppKit/UIKit view controllers unless they embed SwiftUI.

3. Scope SwiftUI to previews:
   - Only import `SwiftUI` inside `#if DEBUG` blocks for `#Preview` declarations
   - **Example:** See [swiftui-preview-import.swift](import-hygiene/swiftui-preview-import.swift)

4. Keep Shared Modules stable:
   - Do not remove `import Common` or other project modules unless a dedicated cleanup task
   - If a module is required elsewhere in the file, do not move or duplicate it

5. Lint & Build first, then adjust:
   - If a file shows missing-types errors after your edits (e.g., `Cannot find type 'FireproofDomains'`), prefer adding the specific missing import required for those existing symbols
   - Avoid speculative imports

6. No import reordering for style-only reasons unless the repository enforces it via formatter

## Rationale
- Unnecessary import edits generate churn and can break platform- or target-specific build settings
- Scoping SwiftUI to previews avoids accidental framework inclusion and linking in non-preview code paths

## Examples

- **CORRECT (AppKit-only controller):** See [appkit-only-controller.swift](import-hygiene/appkit-only-controller.swift)

- **CORRECT (preview-only SwiftUI):** See [preview-only-swiftui.swift](import-hygiene/preview-only-swiftui.swift)

- **AVOID:** See [import-to-avoid.swift](import-hygiene/import-to-avoid.swift)

## Enforcement Guidance
- During PR review, reject changes that add/remove imports without a clear necessity
- Prefer comments in code review over automated reordering unless enforced by tooling
