This file configures AI coding assistants for the Apple monorepo.
Development rules are maintained in `.cursor/rules/` as the single source of truth.

**Personal preferences** (workflow, communication style, tool settings) belong in
your tool's user-level config, not here:
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Cursor: User-level settings

This repo-level file is for **team-shared conventions only**.

## Mandatory Rules

Detailed rules live in `.cursor/rules/`. Read from the list below when the request is relevant. **Do not read any other files in `.cursor/rules` unless requested explicitly.**

| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `general.mdc` | Project overview, architecture summary, rule index, quick-start checklists |
| `code-style.mdc` | Full Swift style guide: naming, formatting, closures, optionals, memory management |
| `anti-patterns.mdc` | What NOT to do: singletons, async mistakes, SwiftUI pitfalls, testing mistakes |
| `user-defaults-storage.mdc` | Storing settings or preferences via `KeyValueStore` |
| `pixels.mdc` | Defining, naming, or firing pixel events |
