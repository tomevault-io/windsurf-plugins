# Agent Guidelines

This document contains guidelines and best practices for AI agents working with this codebase.

## Error Management

- Use `anyhow::Result` for error handling in services and repositories.
- Create domain errors using `thiserror`.
- Never implement `From` for converting domain errors, manually convert them

## Writing Tests

- All tests should be written in three discrete steps:

  ```rust,ignore
  use pretty_assertions::assert_eq; // Always use pretty assertions

  fn test_foo() {
      let setup = ...; // Instantiate a fixture or setup for the test
      let actual = ...; // Execute the fixture to create an output
      let expected = ...; // Define a hand written expected result
      assert_eq!(actual, expected); // Assert that the actual result matches the expected result
  }
  ```

- Use `pretty_assertions` for better error messages.

- Use fixtures to create test data.

- Use `assert_eq!` for equality checks.

- Use `assert!(...)` for boolean checks.

- Use unwraps in test functions and anyhow::Result in fixtures.

- Keep the boilerplate to a minimum.

- Use words like `fixture`, `actual` and `expected` in test functions.

- Fixtures should be generic and reusable.

- Test should always be written in the same file as the source code.

- Use `new`, Default and derive_setters::Setters to create `actual`, `expected` and specially `fixtures`. For example:

  **Good:**

  ```rust,ignore
  User::default().age(12).is_happy(true).name("John")
  User::new("Job").age(12).is_happy()
  User::test() // Special test constructor
  ```

  **Bad:**

  ```rust,ignore
  User {name: "John".to_string(), is_happy: true, age: 12}
  User::with_name("Job") // Bad name, should stick to User::new() or User::test()
  ```

- Use `unwrap()` unless the error information is useful. Use `expect` instead of `panic!` when error message is useful. For example:

  **Good:**

  ```rust,ignore
  users.first().expect("List should not be empty")
  ```

  **Bad:**

  ```rust,ignore
  if let Some(user) = users.first() {
      // ...
  } else {
      panic!("List should not be empty")
  }
  ```

- Prefer using `assert_eq` on full objects instead of asserting each field:

  **Good:**

  ```rust,ignore
  assert_eq!(actual, expected);
  ```

  **Bad:**

  ```rust,ignore
  assert_eq!(actual.a, expected.a);
  assert_eq!(actual.b, expected.b);
  ```

## Verification

Always verify changes by running tests and linting the codebase

1. Run crate specific tests to ensure they pass.

   ```
   cargo insta test --accept
   ```

2. **Build Guidelines**:
   - **NEVER** run `cargo build --release` unless absolutely necessary (e.g., performance testing, creating binaries for distribution)
   - For verification, use `cargo check` (fastest), `cargo insta test`, or `cargo build` (debug mode)
   - Release builds take significantly longer and are rarely needed for development verification

## Writing Domain Types

- Use `derive_setters` to derive setters and use the `strip_option` and the `into` attributes on the struct types.

## Documentation

- **Always** write Rust docs (`///`) for all public methods, functions, structs, enums, and traits.
- Document parameters with `# Arguments` and errors with `# Errors` sections when applicable.
- **Do not include code examples** - docs are for LLMs, not humans. Focus on clear, concise functionality descriptions.

## Refactoring

- If asked to fix failing tests, always confirm whether to update the implementation or the tests.

## Git Operations

- Safely assume git is pre-installed
- Safely assume github cli (gh) is pre-installed
- Always use `Co-Authored-By: blackfloofie-a codegraff agent <265516171+blackfloofie@users.noreply.github.com>` for git commits and Github comments

## Service Implementation Guidelines

Services should follow clean architecture principles and maintain clear separation of concerns:

### Core Principles

- **No service-to-service dependencies**: Services should never depend on other services directly
- **Infrastructure dependency**: Services should depend only on infrastructure abstractions when needed
- **Single type parameter**: Services should take at most one generic type parameter for infrastructure
- **No trait objects**: Avoid `Box<dyn ...>` - use concrete types and generics instead
- **Constructor pattern**: Implement `new()` without type bounds - apply bounds only on methods that need them
- **Compose dependencies**: Use the `+` operator to combine multiple infrastructure traits into a single bound
- **Arc<T> for infrastructure**: Store infrastructure as `Arc<T>` for cheap cloning and shared ownership
- **Tuple struct pattern**: For simple services with single dependency, use tuple structs `struct Service<T>(Arc<T>)`

### Examples

#### Simple Service (No Infrastructure)

```rust,ignore
pub struct UserValidationService;

impl UserValidationService {
    pub fn new() -> Self { ... }

    pub fn validate_email(&self, email: &str) -> Result<()> {
        // Validation logic here
        ...
    }

    pub fn validate_age(&self, age: u32) -> Result<()> {
        // Age validation logic here
        ...
    }
}
```

#### Service with Infrastructure Dependency

```rust,ignore
// Infrastructure trait (defined in infrastructure layer)
