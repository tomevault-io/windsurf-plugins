Instructions for AI agents when working with this repository.

## Architecture Overview

NeoPico-HD is a pure digital Neo Geo MVS capture system using the RP2350B.

- **Core 0**: Handles pixel-perfect video capture (PIO1+DMA). Runs the main coordination loop.
- **Core 1**: Dedicated to HSTX HDMI output and the audio pipeline (polling PIO2, SRC, and TERC4 encoding).
- **Hardware**: Designed for the WeAct RP2350B board using both Bank 0 and Bank 1 GPIOs.

## Essential Documentation

Agents MUST refer to these for implementation details:

- `README.md`: High-level overview and pin mapping.
- `docs/HSTX_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: HSTX protocol, sync polarity, and Data Island details.
- `docs/OSD_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: OSD architecture and rendering strategy.
- `docs/MVS_MV1C_DIGITAL_VIDEO.md`: MVS video tap points and PIO capture logic (Bank 1).
- `docs/MVS_MV1C_DIGITAL_AUDIO.md`: MVS audio tap points and I2S/SRC pipeline.

## Guidelines

- Don’t change any code or run any non-read-only-commands without informing me and discussing it first.
- Be extremely methodical, performing one step at a time and ensuring it works properly before continuing.
- Do not commit code unless explicitly told otherwise.

### OSD & UI

- **Location**: OSD rendering and buffer management MUST be handled on **Core 1**.
- **Rendering**: Overlaying MUST happen during the scanline doubling phase in the DMA ISR to ensure zero-copy transparency.
- **Aesthetic**: Use 8x8 pixel fonts to match the 320x240 internal resolution.

### Audio Pipeline

- **I2S Format**: Right-justified, WS High = Left, BCK Rising Edge.
- **Sample Rate**: Input ~55.5kHz, Output 48kHz (SRC required).
- **HDMI Audio**: MUST use **Validity Bit = 0**.
- **Location**: All audio processing MUST run on **Core 1** to prevent jitter on Core 0.

### Video Capture

- **Sync**: Self-synchronizes to CSYNC falling edge per line.
- **Priority**: Core 0 should ONLY handle capture and pixel conversion to ensure rock-solid sync.
- **Conversion**: Uses **interp0** + **256KB LUT** (main RAM) for RGB565 conversion.
- **Signal Logic**: SHADOW must be applied before expansion; SHADOW forces DARK=1.

### HSTX Output

- **Timing**: MUST be exactly **800 cycles per line**.
- **Mode**: Uses hardware TMDS encoding for video and RAW for Data Islands.

## Session Memory (Required)

- Maintain `SCRATCHBOOK.md` as persistent cross-session memory.
- Update `SCRATCHBOOK.md` on nearly every user interaction with concise entries.
- Always record:
    - User preferences and workflow constraints.
    - What was attempted, what worked, and what failed/regressed.
    - Current hypotheses, safe/unsafe patterns, and next recommended steps.
- Keep entries factual, timestamped, and short (append-only log style).
- Prefer introducing risky or experimental behavior behind compile-time feature flags (`#ifdef`/macros).
- Default policy for experiments: flag-gated, off by default, easy rollback path, avoid direct regression risk.
