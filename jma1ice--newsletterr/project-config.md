# newsletterr development notes

Flask app packaged as `app/` with an app factory (`app/__init__.py:create_app`) and per-feature blueprints. `newsletterr.py` is a thin entrypoint that also serves as the gunicorn target (`newsletterr:app`).

## Commands

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest                                  # full suite (~333 tests, ~2 min), hermetic (no network, temp DB)
ruff check app/ newsletterr.py tests/   # lint (F rules and E9 only)
python newsletterr.py                   # dev server, PORT env overrides 6397
```

Regenerate email golden fixtures after intentional output changes:
`UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 pytest tests/test_golden_sends.py` then review the diff of `tests/goldens/*.json`.

## Invariants (do not break these)

- URL paths are frozen. The frontend JS in `static/js/app/` hardcodes fetch paths like `/pull_stats`. Blueprint endpoints are dotted (`main.index`, `auth.login`); the URL-map snapshot test in `tests/test_structure.py` must be updated deliberately when routes change.
- Import layering flows one way: `config -> state -> crypto -> db/store/settings_store/security/theme/cache -> clients -> emails/render -> scheduler -> hooks/blueprints -> factory`. Nothing imports `app/__init__.py` except `newsletterr.py`.
- Mutable shared state lives in `app/state.py` and is accessed only as attributes (`state.cache_storage`), never via `from app.state import X`, which would break cross-module mutation.
- Settings are read through `app/settings_store.py:get_settings()` (single `SELECT *`, central defaults, eager decryption of secret columns). Do not add scattered `FROM settings` queries. The settings POST route keeps its raw SQL writes on purpose.
- Database access goes through `app/db.py:db_connect()`. Callers own closing.
- `gunicorn -w 1` is mandatory: the send scheduler is an in-process thread and must be a singleton. Use gthread threads for concurrency.
- The email subpackage is named `emails/` (plural) to avoid colliding with the stdlib `email` module.
- `VERSION` file at the repo root is the single source of release metadata: line 1 is the version, line 2 the publish date. The version format must stay `vYYYY.N` because the update checker compares numerically. Release tags must equal line 1 (CI enforces this).
- Send functions return plain values, never Flask responses. Routes wrap results in `jsonify`.
- Email HTML has a single renderer. Sends assemble through `app/emails/assemble.py`; the live previews (index builder and schedule preview) POST the same builder payload to `/preview_email` (`app/emails/preview.py:render_preview_email`). Since the v2026.4 single-renderer refactor the frontend just displays the returned HTML. Do not reintroduce client-side email-HTML construction. The remaining `build*PreviewHTML` functions in `static/js/app/04-stats-graphs.js` and the hand-mirrored copies in `templates/schedule_preview.html` are legacy and slated for removal (v2026.5); the `_filter*`/`_comingSoon*` mirrors are still parity-tested in `tests/test_js_preview_parity.py`.
- Email layouts (`legacy`/`classic`/`editorial`/`digest`/`spotlight`) live in `app/emails/builders/layouts.py`, dispatched from `assemble.py`; the settings-level `email_layout` column selects one. Layout-level chassis colors go through `layouts.apply_theme()` so the shell and the section cards agree; spotlight is the one layout that overrides them today. The `email_templates.layout` column is an unrelated legacy no-op, not the layout selector.
- Email density (`compact`/`expanded`) is a second axis that crosses every layout, settings column `email_density`, resolved in `app/emails/density.py` and carried on the theme dict (`stamp()` writes `density` and `density_layout`; nothing re-reads settings downstream). Each layout has one natural density that must stay byte-identical (`legacy`/`classic`/`spotlight` are naturally expanded, `editorial`/`digest` naturally compact) and one authored variant; blank means natural, which is why an untouched install never shifts. Builders must branch through `picker()`/`picker3()`/`show_art()`/`columns()`, never on `is_compact()` alone. The shared builders that render under every layout (recommendations, collections, the card grid) need the three-way `picker3()` because the same code is one layout's compact variant and another's expanded one. The compact variants carry no artwork at all and stack card grids into one column.
- The Coming Soon snap-ins take a per-item `csView` (`grid`/`calendar`/`agenda`, blank = the layout's own treatment) rendered by `app/emails/builders/calendar_view.py`. Its class names and the `@media (max-width: 600px)` block in `app/theme.py` are hand-synced: the month grid only reflows into a stacked list on phones because of those rules, and `.cs-cal-empty` must stay after `.cs-cal-cell` to win. `tests/test_coming_soon_views.py` fails on a class emitted without a matching rule.
- CSP is enforcing since v2026.3 (`app/hooks.py`). All script tags need `nonce="{{ nonce }}"`; the nonce comes from a context processor backed by `g.csp_nonce`. No inline `onclick=`/`oninput=` handlers in templates.
