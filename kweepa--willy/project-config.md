# ACME Assembler Style

This project uses [ACME](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme/) assembler syntax.

## Short Branches

Use ACME local-label short branches for nearby forward and backward jumps. Do **not** invent named labels when a short branch is sufficient.

| Direction | Notation | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Backward  | `-`      | Previous local label |
| Backward  | `--`     | Two labels back |
| Backward  | `---`    | Three labels back |
| Forward   | `+`      | Next local label |
| Forward   | `++`     | Two labels ahead |
| Forward   | `+++`    | Three labels ahead |

Local labels are bare `+` or `-` on their own line. Count only local labels when choosing `-`, `--`, `+`, `++`, etc.

```asm
; ✅ GOOD — short branches for local control flow
    cmp up_down_ctr
    beq +
    sec
    sbc #3
    cmp up_down_ctr
+
    rts

    cmp meta_content_guardians
    bne -

; ❌ BAD — named labels for trivial local jumps
    cmp up_down_ctr
    beq skip_sub
    sec
    sbc #3
    cmp up_down_ctr
skip_sub
    rts
```

`jmp`, `jsr`, and all conditional branches (`beq`, `bne`, `bcc`, `bcs`, `bpl`, `bmi`, etc.) may use short-branch notation.

## Other ACME Conventions

- Use `!source`, `!byte`, `!word`, `!if` / `!warn`, and other ACME directives — not ca65/ld65 syntax.
- Reserve named labels for subroutine entry points, loop heads referenced from a distance, and symbols referenced across routines.
- Match surrounding indentation and naming in the file being edited.
