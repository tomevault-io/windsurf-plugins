## Skill Structure

Each play lives at `skills/{stage}/{sub-stage}/{play-slug}/` and contains four level files:

```
skills/marketing/solution-aware/outbound-founder-email/
├── smoke.md      # Validate in ~1 week, free
├── baseline.md   # Prove repeatable results in ~2 weeks
├── scalable.md   # Scale 5–10× with automation over ~2 months
└── durable.md    # Agent-driven continuous improvement, 6+ months
```

### Frontmatter Fields

```yaml
---
name: play-name-level
description: >
  Short description of the play and what level this is.
stage: "Marketing > Solution Aware"
motion: "Outbound Founder-Led"
channels: "Email, LinkedIn"
level: "Smoke Test"
time: "5 hours over 1 week"
outcome: ">=3 replies from ICP prospects in 1 week"
---
```

## Stack Config

Before running any skill, check for `.gtm-config.json` in the project root or `~/.gtm-config.json` globally. This file specifies the user's tools (CRM, automation, email, enrichment, LinkedIn, scheduling). Substitute tool names throughout play instructions when this config exists.

If no config exists, prompt: "Run `npx gtm-skills init` to configure your stack, or tell me your CRM and automation platform."

## Level Progression Rule

Never skip levels. If a user asks to run Scalable without Baseline results, remind them to prove the play at Baseline first. A Smoke that misses its outcome is signal to iterate ICP, offer, or channel — not a failure.

## Checking for Updates

When using any skill from this repository:

1. **Once per session**, on first skill use, check for updates:
   - Fetch `VERSIONS.md` from GitHub: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tarkaai/gtm-skills/main/VERSIONS.md
   - Compare versions against local skill files

2. **Only prompt if meaningful**:
   - 2 or more plays have updates, OR
   - Any play has a major version bump (e.g., 1.x to 2.x)

3. **Non-blocking notification** at end of response:
   ```
   ---
   Skills update available: X GTM plays have updates.
   Say "update skills" to update automatically, or run `git pull` in your gtm-skills folder.
   ```

4. **If user says "update skills"**:
   - Run `git pull` in the gtm-skills directory
   - Confirm what was updated

## Build / Lint / Test

- YAML frontmatter is valid
- `name` field is present
- `level` matches one of: Smoke Test, Baseline, Scalable, Durable
- File is under 500 lines (move detail to references/ if needed)
