# Extension Resilience

- Keep extensions isolated: one failing extension must not break core editor behavior.
- Prefer diagnostics and graceful degradation over throwing from extension hooks.
- Treat `observe()` and `decorations()` as best-effort hooks; guard unsafe assumptions.
- Keep extension state explicit and namespaced; avoid hidden cross-extension coupling.
- Preserve schema validation at boundaries: reject or sanitize malformed extension/tool payloads before writes.
- For AI/collab/streaming flows, favor recoverable behavior (abort/cleanup/retry path) over hard failure.
