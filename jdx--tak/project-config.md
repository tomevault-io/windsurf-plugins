# tak Development Guide

tak measures how much work a command does by counting instructions, and stores the results in
the repository as git notes. Read the README before changing anything: the premise, the
measured numbers behind it, and the pre-v1 compatibility warning are all there.

## The invariant everything else serves

Metrics come in two tiers, and conflating them defeats the entire point of the project:

| tier | metrics | may gate CI? |
|---|---|---|
| **deterministic** | `instructions` | **yes** — ~0.02% run-to-run, ~0.035% across wildly different machine load |
| **timing** | `wall_min_ms`, `wall_p50_ms`, `wall_mean_ms`, `wall_max_ms` | **never** — 4–20% CV on a quiet host, medians move ~150% under contention |

Syscall counts and peak RSS sit between the two (~1%) and are *not* deterministic — they move
with thread scheduling. Record and flag them; never gate on them at a tight threshold.

Two consequences that come up constantly:

- **Report the minimum, not the mean.** Contention is one-sided — a busy machine can only make
  a run slower, and a subject that consults the network can only retire *more* instructions.
  The floor is the robust estimator for both tiers.
- **Series must be partitioned on `runner`.** Moving between runner classes shifts absolute
  numbers enough to look like a regression. That is the documented failure mode of every
  threshold-based CI benchmark, and reproducing it here would be embarrassing.

## Build & test

Go through mise rather than calling cargo directly, so that a laptop and a CI runner invoke
the same commands — the same reason `tak.toml` exists for benchmarks.

```bash
mise run build        # cargo build
mise run test         # cargo test --all-targets, including tests/counters.rs
mise run lint         # fmt check + clippy, warnings as errors
mise run lint-fix     # auto-fix what can be auto-fixed
mise run ci           # build + test + lint, everything CI runs
```

`mise run lint:fmt` and `mise run lint:clippy` are separately runnable. `mise tasks` lists
everything.

**Instruction counting needs valgrind.** Without it `measure::instructions` returns
`Ok(None)` and every counter test skips — which is how the cachegrind call once shipped having
never executed once. `tests/counters.rs` exists to stop that recurring, so if you touch the
measurement path, run it somewhere valgrind exists:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y valgrind
```

No usable valgrind exists on Apple Silicon or Windows. On those hosts, `mise run docker` builds
an image that carries it:

```bash
mise run docker
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/w" -w /w tak run --bench startup -- ./mycli --help
```

Pass `--user`: tak spawns the subject under measurement, so it inherits the container's
privileges over your mounted checkout.

`tak doctor` reports what is actually available — git repo, valgrind, notes fetch, runner class.

## Layout

```
src/main.rs        clap CLI, one cmd_* fn per subcommand, runner_class(), now_rfc3339()
src/measure.rs     the two tiers: wall() and instructions()
src/notes.rs       refs/notes/tak storage; shells out to git for all network I/O
src/record.rs      the on-disk line format and its schema version
src/config.rs      tak.toml — declared benchmarks
src/backfill.rs    benchmark published release binaries to bootstrap history
crates/asset-picker/   release-asset selection, extracted from mise; published separately
tests/counters.rs  exercises the real cachegrind subprocess
```

`src/lib.rs` re-exports the modules so integration tests can reach them. That is the only
reason the library target exists — keep it that way rather than growing a public API.

## Conventions in this codebase

- **Errors:** `anyhow::Result` throughout, with `.context()` / `.with_context()` naming the
  thing that failed. `bail!` for domain errors. No `thiserror` yet.
- **No `tracing`, no `log`.** Results go to stdout with `println!`; diagnostics to stderr with
  `eprintln!`. This is a CLI whose entire output is a handful of numbers.
- **Never spawn a shell.** A shell adds its own startup cost and variance to every sample,
  which for a 10ms command is a large fraction of the measurement. String commands in
  `tak.toml` split on whitespace and nothing else — no quoting, no globs. Anything needing a
  pipe is a list whose first element is the interpreter.
- **`BTreeMap`, not `HashMap`,** wherever the contents are serialised or iterated. Key order
  has to be stable across writers and across runs.
- **Git is a subprocess, deliberately.** `actions/checkout` sets up auth via
  `http.extraheader`; users have credential helpers, SSH agents and corporate proxies.
  Reimplementing that is a trap. Local object access could move to `gix` without crossing this
  boundary — network operations should not.
- **Validate up front.** `tak.toml` is fully validated at parse time, and a multi-benchmark run
  measures everything before writing anything. A partial set left behind by a late failure
  looks exactly like a complete one.
- **Comments say *why*, not *what*.** Nearly every non-obvious line here carries the reasoning
  or the measurement that produced it, often naming the failure it prevents. Match that. A
