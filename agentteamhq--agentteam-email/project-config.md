# Agent Requirements

## Documentation

Agents must keep `AGENTS.md` limited to durable workflows and read or update the
owning documentation before changing documented behavior.

Agents must not edit any `AGENTS.md` file without explicit current-task approval
for that specific file.

Before work involving authentication, authorization, Better Auth, credentials,
encryption, sessions, cookies, API keys, tokens, JWT, OAuth, JWKS, secret
storage, security-sensitive routes, or anything that could be security related,
agents must stop, read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), and follow it.

## Open Source Boundary

This repository is open source. Repository files must not contain secrets,
private operational context, private hostnames, private repository names,
credentials, tokens, absolute paths, or paths that resolve outside the
repository root.

Every path written into a repository file must be relative to the repository
root.

Agents must not write developer-machine, worktree-specific, temporary-checkout,
or local-clone paths into repository files. Do not include the output of
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` in committed content.

When the repository root is unclear, agents must run
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to identify it, verify the target path is inside
that root, and write only the repository-root-relative path.

## Standards And Structured Formats

Standard, protocol, common-format, and syntax-governed functionality must use
purpose-built structured APIs from well-supported canonical packages.

This applies to all repository code and workflows, including application code,
tests, scripts, probes, diagnostics, harnesses, generators, containers, and
tooling.

Agents must not hand-roll behavior covered by this rule. If the required package
is unavailable, agents must stop and request approval to add it or request an
explicit exception.

## Type Ownership

Agents must preserve strict types from their owning source instead of redefining
or weakening them locally.

Code must import upstream package types, generated contract types, or exported
workspace types from the owning package.

## Authorization

Permissions must be modeled as strict backend-owned TypeScript/Zod contracts and
enforced through CASL Ability.

Each protected domain object must have its own typed permission schema, CASL
subject, ability builder, and helper surface when its authorization semantics
differ.

Frontend labels, Storybook fixtures, OAuth scopes, and ad hoc booleans must not
define or enforce permission semantics.

## Generated Outputs

Generated outputs must not be manually edited. Agents must update the owning
source, configuration, or inputs and rerun the process that generates them.

## Definitions And Defaults

Definitions must have one owner.

Consumers must read, reference, derive from, or generate from the owning
definition.

Required inputs must fail fast with clear errors when missing or invalid.

Defaults must live only in the owning configuration surface.

## Build And Tasks

Agents must use [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for checkout setup, `WT` worktree identity,
repo-managed tool installation, and validation command selection.

Before adding or changing containerized workflows, agents must follow
[SETUP.md](SETUP.md) instructions.

Node and frontend workflows must use Corepack-managed `pnpm` scripts from the
relevant package.

Root `mise.toml` owns shared tool pins, repo-wide workflows, and broad aggregate
tasks; scoped app, chart, docs, and test-container workflows are owned by the
nearest relevant `mise.toml` and invoked with explicit monorepo task paths.

Root `package.json` owns workspace-wide Node workflows; app-specific and
test-container-specific Node commands live in the owning package and are invoked
through package filters or the owning `mise` task.

Canonical formatting, build, test, typecheck, lint, dependency, and runtime
failures must be triaged through the failing workflow.

Direct tool invocations are allowed for debugging, diagnosis, or workflows that
are not owned by a package script or `mise` task.

## Database

Database schema changes must start in the owning schema package.

Migration or schema generation must be run only through the canonical package
workflow and only when the current task authorizes generation.

## Dependencies

Dependency changes must follow `PEER-DEPS.md`.

Installing a package requires current-task approval for that specific package.

The root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` owns workspace package boundaries, catalogs, peer
rules, package-manager strictness, and minimum release age.

DO NOT EDIT `.pnpmfile.cjs` WITHOUT EXPLICIT CURRENT-TASK APPROVAL.

Dependency versions must be exact except where `PEER-DEPS.md` defines a peer or
workspace protocol.

`pnpm-lock.yaml` and install artifacts must be maintained by normal `pnpm
install` from the repo root.

Cross-package imports must use the referenced package's declared public exports.

## Runtime And Environment

Shared code must receive environment-specific origins, ports, credentials,
storage paths, providers, and debug behavior through explicit configuration.

Local database, mail, container, deploy, and service runtime workflows must use
the repo-owned task or script that owns that lifecycle.
