# agentic-workflow-governance-tools

C++20 CLI tool that scans git diffs, validates paths against policies, and enforces architectural boundaries for PR review safety gating.

## Quick Start

Clone and build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chrisipanaque/agentic-workflow-governance-tools.git
cd agentic-workflow-governance-tools
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
./build/agentic-workflow-governance-tools validate-policy
```

> Edit `config/forbidden-paths.json` and `config/dependency-rules.json` to set your own policies. The binary reads them from disk at runtime — no recompilation needed.

## Build & Run

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
./build/agentic-workflow-governance-tools <command>
```

Single dependency: `nlohmann_json` (v3.11.2, fetched via CMake FetchContent). No package manager required.

## Commands

| Command | What it does | Exit 0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `healthcheck` | Prints status, writes audit/trace logs | always |
| `show-policies` | Loads `config/forbidden-paths.json`, prints count | always |
| `scan-diff` | Runs `git diff --unified=0` via popen, prints stats | always |
| `validate-policy` | scan-diff + check paths against policy | if no violations |
| `validate-dependencies` | scan-diff + dependency boundary validation | if no dependency violations |

All commands write JSON audit reports to `output/reports/audit_*.json` and JSONL traces to `output/traces/trace_*.jsonl`.

## Architecture

- `src/main.cpp` — CLI dispatcher (5 commands, string comparison)
- Config files in `config/`: `forbidden-paths.json` (path + reason), `dependency-rules.json` (module boundary rules)
- `src/diff_scanner.cpp` — parses `git diff --unified=0` output, not `git diff --cached` (unstaged+staged, not just staged)
- `src/path_validator.cpp` — glob matching (`*`/`?`) against forbidden paths
- `src/dependency_validator.cpp` — include-directive analysis for module boundary enforcement
- `src/github_metadata.cpp` — reads `GITHUB_*` env vars (empty when run locally)
- `src/trace_logger.cpp` / `src/audit_log.cpp` — creates dirs via `std::filesystem::create_directories()` (recursive, no shell dependency), flushes on every command

## Testing

No unit test framework. CI (`.github/workflows/pr-governance-check.yml`) runs each command as a smoke test. For `scan-diff`, CI initializes a temp git repo with changes to avoid depending on the repo's actual diff.

To test locally, ensure you have staged/unstaged changes in a git repo, then run any command.

## Notable

- No linter, formatter, or typechecker config in the repo
- `build/`, and `output/` are gitignored
- Exit code 1 also means "unknown command"
- `validate-policy` returns 1 when violations found

## Gotchas

- **Never iterate `github_metadata.to_json().items()` directly.** The temporary `json` is destroyed before the loop body, a dangling-pointer UB. Always store in a named variable first: `auto m = github_metadata.to_json(); for (const auto& kv : m.items())`
- `diff_scanner` uses `git --no-pager diff --unified=0` via `popen()` to prevent pager-triggered blocking
- All output to stdout uses `std::cout`; diagnostic trace markers use `std::cerr` (unbuffered, visible immediately in CI)
- CI step for `validate-dependencies` wraps the binary in `timeout 30` as a safety net
