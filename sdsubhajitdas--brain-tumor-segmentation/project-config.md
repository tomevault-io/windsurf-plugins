# Brain Tumor Segmentation — Project Memory & Roadmap

## What this project is
A PyTorch project that segments brain tumors in MRI scans using a custom 4-block-deep
U-Net (`bts/model.py: DynamicUNet`). Trained on Jun Cheng's 3064-image figshare
dataset. Achieves ~0.74 mean Dice score on a 600-image test set.

Core pieces:
- `bts/model.py` — `DynamicUNet` (U-Net variant, configurable filters, 512x512x1 in/out)
- `bts/dataset.py` — `TumorDataset` (loads `{idx}.png`/`{idx}_mask.png` pairs, random aug)
- `bts/loss.py` — `DiceLoss`, `BCEDiceLoss`
- `bts/classifier.py` — `BrainTumorClassifier` (train/test/predict/save/restore)
- `bts/plot.py` — matplotlib visualization helpers
- `api.py` — CLI inference (`--file`/`--dir` flags), loads `saved_models/UNet-[16, 32, 64, 128, 256].pt`
- `Tumor Segmentation.ipynb` — main training/eval notebook
- `setup_scripts/` — dataset download/unzip/extract
- `web/` — FastAPI web app (Phase 3, see below)
- `requirements.txt` / `requirements-web.txt` — training and web-app deps, kept separate

Owner considers this one of their best/oldest projects. No CI, no tests.

## Status: done and live
Phases 1–3 (dependency modernization, web app) are merged into `master` and deployed.
The gallery-sync and frontend-redesign work below (originally two separate branches)
is combined onto this one branch, open as a single PR against `master`.

- **Stack**: Python 3.14.2, torch 2.13.0 / torchvision 0.28.0, FastAPI + vanilla JS
  for the web app.
- **Live app**: https://bts.subhajitdas.me — deployed via Dokploy (project "Brain
  Tumor Segmentation", app "Web"), auto-deploys on push to `master`.
- History: modernization work happened on `modernize-deps` (PR #28), the web app on
  `web-app` stacked on top (PR #29). Both merged into `master` 2026-08-09.

## Key decisions worth remembering
- **No retraining needed** for the dependency modernization — `state_dict` loads fine
  across the torch version jump; the shipped checkpoint is unchanged.
- **Device selection** is `cuda → mps → cpu` throughout (`api.py`, `web/inference.py`).
  This also happens to make the code Docker-portable for free: on Linux/Dokploy both
  `cuda` and `mps` are unavailable, so it cleanly falls back to `cpu` with zero
  Docker-specific code.
- **Web app** (`web/`) is a single FastAPI process serving both API routes and the
  server-rendered frontend (Jinja2 + vanilla JS, no SPA framework) — required so the
  whole thing packages into one Docker image for Dokploy.
  - Uploaded images are processed **entirely in memory**, never written to disk — no
    cleanup job needed.
  - The 12 curated "try it" sample pairs and the gallery images (WebP thumbs +
    capped full-size) are pre-baked and committed under `web/static/` by one-off
    scripts (`web/scripts/prepare_samples.py`, `web/scripts/build_gallery_thumbs.py`).
    The web app never depends on the large gitignored `dataset/` folder, and
    thumbnails aren't regenerated on every deploy.
  - `images/` at repo root is **not** the gallery's source of truth at runtime —
    `.dockerignore` excludes it entirely, so the deployed app never reads from it.
    It only feeds two build-time/doc consumers: (1) `web/scripts/build_gallery_thumbs.py`,
    a one-off script that globs `images/*.png` to regenerate
    `web/static/gallery/{thumbs,full}/*.webp` (295 of each, already committed —
    these are what `/gallery` actually serves), and (2) `README.md`'s "Results"
    section, which hand-picks 20 of the highest-scoring images by exact filename.
    `images/*.png` itself is intentionally kept at its original 88 files
    (dice >= 0.94, whitelisted in `.gitignore` by dice-score prefix,
    `!images/0.9[4-9]*`) — matching `master`, not widened to the full 295 the
    gallery now shows. Tried trimming it to just the 20 README-referenced files
    on 2026-08-10 to cut repo bloat, but that also deleted 68 files that
    pre-existed on `master` before any of this session's work, which the owner
    asked to have restored; reverted `images/` and `.gitignore` back to
    `master`'s state entirely rather than re-deriving a narrower whitelist. Net
    effect: the live gallery still serves all 295 images (already-committed
    WebP derivatives don't depend on this), but `images/*.png` source coverage
    is intentionally narrower than that — the fuller 601-image source corpus
    (synced 2026-08-10 from the owner's Google Drive zip) was never committed;
    re-derive from that zip if the gallery ever needs rebuilding.
  - `bts/classifier.py` and `bts/model.py` lazily import `tensorboard`/`torchinfo`
    (scoped to `train()`/`.summary()`) rather than at module level — needed so the
    lean web image (which deliberately excludes those training-only deps) can still
    `import bts.classifier`/`bts.model` for inference.
  - Dockerfile installs CPU-only torch/torchvision via a scoped
    `--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` (avoids the much larger
    default CUDA-bundled wheels). Final image: ~1.06GB.
  - **In-house per-IP rate limiter** (`web/rate_limit.py`) gates `/api/predict`.
    Skippable in dev via `APP_ENV=development`; unset or any other value (including
    the Dokploy deploy, which sets nothing) rate-limits — the safe default.
