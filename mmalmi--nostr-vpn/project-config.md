## Dataplane

- Goal: simple, fast, reliable FIPS/nvpn; high throughput; low latency, jitter, loss; observable failures.
- References: `wireguard-go`, then BoringTun.
- Delete concepts, LOC, unused code, stale tests, test-only APIs, and diagnostic scaffolding.
- Avoid knobs, wrappers, fallbacks, and duplicate paths.
- Keep the nvpn/FIPS adapter thin and canonical; leave dataplane policy, batching, queueing, priority, and liveness logic on the FIPS side when possible.
- Do not change FIPS protocol message types, byte values, wire record formats, routing semantics, or compatibility boundaries without explicit user approval. Performance work must preserve the FIPS protocol surface unless the user has approved a protocol change for that task.
- Measure bottlenecks: throughput, latency, loss, hard counters, CPU-sec/GB or cycles/Gbit.
- If architecture is sound, debug first bad perf rows before reverting. Large rewrites allowed.
- Build/test sparingly; use a separate test worktree for long runs.

## Build/Bench

- Perf: build daemon only.
- macOS daemon: `scripts/install-nvpn-test-daemon`; manual release path: `scripts/build-output-path --raw nvpn --release`; clear xattrs; ad-hoc sign.
- launchd env/plist/codesign: `bootout` + `bootstrap`; `kickstart` can keep old env.
- Linux remote: `scripts/build-nvpn-linux-musl <target>`; native glibc only same distro/glibc; never ARMv7 on ARMv6.
- Docker image binary swaps: use `scripts/docker-replace-nvpn-binary`; it rejects image/binary architecture mismatches that would run through Rosetta/QEMU and poison perf rows.
- Bench both directions: `iperf3 -R`; LAN MTU only with `mesh_mtu_profile = "lan"` / `NVPN_MESH_MTU_PROFILE=lan`.
- Remote bench: load SSH keys first (`ssh-add --apple-use-keychain <key>`).
- Avoid unittests unless very good reason, prefer integration test coverage

## Platforms

- Windows: run build/test checks from the configured Windows dev VM checkout; do not use local macOS/Linux `dotnet` as the verification path. Check `dotnet build windows\NostrVpn.Windows\NostrVpn.Windows.csproj -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true` there.
- Mobile-sensitive: `just mobile-test-kit`; sim/device packet paths: `just mobile-test-kit-sim` / `just mobile-test-kit-device`.
- FIPS protocol/routing/session/reconnect tests live in `fips`; Android/iOS VPN, FFI/JNI/C ABI, permissions, physical packet checks live here.
- Do not commit hostnames, device IDs, signing details, or local paths; use env vars.

## Release

- Before release: `just release-gate`; Linux GTK: `( cd linux && cargo check )`.
- Bump: changelog `## X.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD`; root version; `node scripts/sync-versions.mjs --check`; gate.
- Draft: `node scripts/local-release.mjs --publish`; no `v*` GitHub tag.
- Final: commit, lightweight `vX.Y.Z`, push `master` and tag to `github`, push `master` to htree `origin`, run htree publish, watch `gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 3`.
