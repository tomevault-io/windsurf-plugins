# RS-Agent Bot Guide

You're here to play the mmo game through the progressive development of botting scripts, starting small then adapting to your desires and ideas.
It is strongly recommended to get started and make the first step towards your goals, then researching and learning as you go.
## First Time Setup

**Create a new bot using the setup script:**

Ask the user for a bot name (max 12 chars, alphanumeric). If they skip, use the command without a username to auto-generate a random 9-character name.

```bash
# With custom username
bun bots/create-bot.ts {username}

# Auto-generate random username
bun bots/create-bot.ts

# Use local server (sets SERVER=localhost in bot.env)
bun bots/create-bot.ts {username} --local

# Use a custom server
bun bots/create-bot.ts {username} --server=myserver.example.com
```

This automatically creates:
- `bots/{username}/bot.env` - Credentials with auto-generated password
- `bots/{username}/lab_log.md` - Session notes template
- `bots/{username}/script.ts` - Ready-to-run starter script



### Quick Start

1. Install dependencies: `bun install` (from project root)
2. Open project in your AI coding tool — the MCP server will be available automatically
3. Control your bot with suggestions.

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `execute_code(bot_name, code)` | Run code on a bot. Auto-connects on first use. |
| `list_bots()` | List connected bots |
| `disconnect_bot(name)` | Disconnect a bot |

### Example

```typescript
// Just execute - auto-connects on first use
execute_code({
  bot_name: "mybot",
  code: `
    const state = sdk.getState();
    console.log('Position:', state.player.worldX, state.player.worldZ);

    // Chop trees for 1 minute
    const endTime = Date.now() + 60_000;
    while (Date.now() < endTime) {
      const tree = sdk.findNearbyLoc(/^tree$/i);
      if (tree) await bot.chopTree(tree);
    }

    return sdk.getInventory();
  `
})
```

See `mcp/README.md` for detailed API reference.

Code runs in an async context with `bot` (BotActions) and `sdk` (BotSDK) available as globals.

## Session Workflow

This is a **persistent character** - you don't restart fresh each time. The workflow is:

### 1. Check World State First

Before writing any script, check where the bot is and what it has:

```bash
bun sdk/cli.ts {username}
```

This shows: position, inventory, skills, nearby NPCs/objects, and more.

**Exception**: Skip this if you just created the character and know it's at spawn.

**Tutorial Check**: If the character is in the tutorial area, call `await bot.skipTutorial()` before running any other scripts. The tutorial blocks normal gameplay.

### 2. Write Your Script

Edit `bots/{username}/script_name.ts` with your goal. Keep scripts focused on one task. you may write multiple scripts for different tasks and switch between them.

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
bun bots/{username}/script_name.ts
```

### 4. Observe and Iterate

Watch the output. After the script finishes (or fails), check state again:

```bash
bun sdk/cli.ts {username}
```

Record observations in `lab_log.md`, then improve the script.

## Script Duration Guidelines

**Start short, extend as you gain confidence:**

| Duration | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| **10s** | New script, single actions, untested logic, debugging |
| **30s-1 min** | Validated approach, building confidence |
| **5+ min** | Proven strategy, grinding runs. USE SPARINGLY |

A failed 5-minute run wastes more time than five 30 second diagnostic runs. **Fail fast and start simple.**

Look out for "I can't reach" messages - the solution is often to open closed gates or that the item isn't accessible. 

Read and grep in the learnings/ and wiki/ folder for tips, skill guides, item and npc locations, and shop information.

## SDK API Reference

For the complete method reference, see **[sdk/API.md](sdk/API.md)** (auto-generated from source).

**Quick overview:**
- `bot.*` - High-level actions that wait for effects to complete (chopTree, walkTo, attackNpc, etc.)
- `sdk.*` - Low-level methods that resolve on server acknowledgment (sendWalk, getState, findNearbyNpc, etc.)

### bot.* Quick Reference

| Method | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `walkTo(x, z, tolerance?)` | Pathfind to coords, opens doors along the way |
| `talkTo(target)` | Walk to NPC, start dialog |
| `interactNpc(target, option?)` | Walk to NPC, interact with any option (e.g. `'trade'`, `'fish'`) |
| `interactLoc(target, option?)` | Walk to loc, interact with any option (e.g. `'mine'`, `'smelt'`) |
| `attackNpc(target)` | Walk to NPC, start combat |
| `pickpocketNpc(target)` | Pickpocket NPC, detects XP gain vs stun |
| `castSpellOnNpc(target, spell)` | Cast combat spell on NPC |
| `chopTree(target?)` | Chop tree, wait for logs |
| `pickupItem(target)` | Pick up ground item |
| `openDoor(target?)` | Open a door or gate |
| `openBank()` | Open nearest bank |
| `depositItem(target, amount?)` | Deposit item to bank |
| `withdrawItem(slot, amount?)` | Withdraw item from bank |
| `openShop(target?)` | Open shop via shopkeeper NPC |
| `buyFromShop(target, amount?)` | Buy item from open shop |
