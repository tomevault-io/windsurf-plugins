# AI-Driven Test Guidelines

This project uses AI-driven browser automation tests that rely on browser agents to simulate user interactions. Follow these patterns and best practices.

## Test Structure Pattern

### 1. Database-First Verification
- **Always verify database state** before and after browser agent execution
- **Don't rely solely on agent success/failure** - use database verification as primary pass/fail criteria
- **Create test data directly in database** rather than through UI when possible

```python
# ✅ Good: Verify database state
event = db.events.get(created_event_id)
assert event["fields"]["owner"] == [user_id], "Event ownership verified"

# ❌ Bad: Relying only on agent output
assert result.success, "Agent reported success"
```

### 2. Test Data Management
- **Use real database records** instead of fake IDs
- **Create complete user records** with all required fields
- **Clean up test data** in finally blocks
- **Use unique names** with UUIDs to avoid conflicts

```python
# ✅ Good: Create real user
attendee_user = db.users.create({
    "display_name": "Test Attendee",
    "email": f"attendee-{uuid.uuid4()}@example.com",
    "first_name": "Attendee",
    "last_name": "User",
    # ... all required fields
})

# ❌ Bad: Using fake IDs
attendee_id = "usr" + token_urlsafe(8)
```

### 3. Database Field Names
- **Use correct field names** that match the database schema
- **Use array format** for relationship fields (e.g., `"event": [event_id]`)
- **Exclude computed fields** from creation operations

```python
# ✅ Good: Correct field names and formats
project = db.projects.create({
    "name": "Test Project",
    "event": [created_event_id],  # Array format
    "owner": [user_id],           # Array format
    "repo": "https://example.com/repo",
    # Exclude computed fields like "points"
})

# ❌ Bad: Wrong field names
project = db.projects.create({
    "name": "Test Project",
    "event_id": created_event_id,  # Wrong field name
    "points": 100,                 # Computed field
})
```

## Browser Agent Prompts

### 4. Clear Success Criteria
- **Define explicit success criteria** in prompts with numbered steps
- **Clarify that empty data is expected** for new events
- **Emphasize UI exploration over data content**
- **Use direct "Return success=true" instructions** for clarity

```python
prompt = (
    f"{magic_url(temp_user_tokens)} "
    f"Navigate to your event '{event_name}' and access the admin panel. "
    "Verify you can see admin features like attendees, leaderboard, etc. "
    "IMPORTANT: This test should return SUCCESS if you can: "
    "1. Navigate to the admin panel "
    "2. Find admin UI sections (attendees, leaderboard, votes, referrals) "
    "3. Access these sections even if they show empty data "
    "Empty data sections are EXPECTED for new events. Finding the admin UI is SUCCESS. "
    "Return success=true if you can access the admin panel and see admin sections."
)
```

### 5. Handle Agent Behavior
- **Expect functionality testing** - agents may test remove/delete features
- **Account for data changes** during testing
- **Focus on UI accessibility** rather than data preservation

```python
# ✅ Good: Account for agent testing remove functionality
# The agent may have removed the attendee as part of testing the remove functionality
# This is actually correct behavior - we just need to verify the event structure is intact
assert event_after["fields"]["owner"] == [user_id], "Event ownership should remain unchanged"
```

## Test Organization

### 6. Test Categories
- **Authorization tests**: Verify access control and permissions (use direct URLs for non-owners/non-attendees, event names for attendees)
- **Functionality tests**: Test specific admin features
- **UI consistency tests**: Verify user experience and interface
- **Error handling tests**: Test graceful failure scenarios

### 6.1. Authorization Test Patterns
- **Non-owners/Non-attendees**: Should NOT see admin UI elements (use direct event URLs)
- **Owners**: Should see admin UI elements and be able to access them
- **Attendees**: Can see events in lists but should NOT see admin UI elements
- **Event visibility**: Non-owners who aren't attendees can only access events via direct URL, not through lists

```python
# ✅ Good: Authorization test with direct URL for non-owner/non-attendee
event_url = f"{app_public_url}/events/{slug}"
prompt = (
    f"{magic_url(temp_user_tokens)} "
    f"Navigate directly to the event URL: {event_url} "
    "Since you're not the owner or attendee, you should NOT see any admin UI elements (buttons, panels, admin sections). "
    "IMPORTANT: This test should return SUCCESS if you can: "
    "1. Navigate to the event page using the direct URL "
    "2. Confirm that NO admin UI elements are visible (as expected for non-owners/non-attendees) "
    "3. Verify that admin features are properly hidden from non-owners/non-attendees "
    "If you cannot see admin UI elements, that's the CORRECT behavior and SUCCESS. "
    "Return success=true if you can access the event but confirm admin features are hidden."
)

# ✅ Good: Authorization test for attendee (can find event in list)
prompt = (
    f"{magic_url(temp_user_tokens)} "
