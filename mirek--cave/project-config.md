# CAVE monorepo — working instructions

pnpm workspace of `@cavelang/*` packages implementing the CAVE
specification; the spec itself lives in `.claude/skills/` (section index
in README.md). `make check` runs typecheck + all tests.

## Live documentation

All documentation is maintained as live documentation. Every pull request
must use [`DOCUMENTATION.md`](DOCUMENTATION.md) to review the surfaces affected
by its changes and update them in the same PR, including package READMEs,
architecture and implementation guides, specification skills, examples,
website copy, the remaining TODO index, and the book source/PDF where
applicable. Track all active work in `todo/*.md` with a frontmatter `type`
(such as `bug`, `feat`, or `review`) and an entry in `TODO.md`; follow the task
format and bug regression workflow documented there. Delete completed TODO files
together with their index entries instead of marking them completed; preserve lasting rationale in
the relevant live document or changelog. A PR with stale documentation is
incomplete; explicitly confirm the review when no documentation edit is needed.
Historical changelogs, changesets, durable decision records, authorship, and
license records remain point-in-time records.

**Persist conclusions.** Any material finding or conclusion — a review
finding's rationale, an accepted or rejected alternative, a boundary a
command deliberately keeps, an operational gotcha, a decision reached in
conversation — is written into the relevant live document in the same
change: the specification skill it belongs to, a package README,
`ARCHITECTURE.md`/`IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `PROJECT-BOUNDARIES.md`, or the
workflow skill. Skills are live documents; a conclusion that lives only in
a chat, a PR thread, or a commit message is lost.

## Pull requests

The branch, changeset, review, CI, and merge workflow is
`.claude/skills/pull-requests/SKILL.md`. In short: fix or answer every Codex
finding with a test, reply on the thread and **resolve it**, request
`@codex review` again, and merge (squash, the only allowed method) only when
CI is green and a review comes back with no finding. A session that merges
a changeset-carrying PR also verifies and merges the resulting
`chore(release): version packages` PR before it ends — nobody has to ask.

## Versioning — changesets

All `@cavelang/*` packages release together at one version (a changesets
`fixed` group; `scripts/sync-versions.mjs` syncs the private root
manifest, VS Code extension manifest, and `tree-sitter.json` to it — the
private website manifest deliberately stays put). **Never edit a `version`
field by hand** — versions only move in the automated release PR. The VS Code
extension is not in the npm fixed group; it receives the resulting version
only after Changesets finishes, then publishes to Marketplace from the
`vscode` job of `.github/workflows/publish.yml` after every npm release
(`.github/workflows/vscode.yml` republishes an existing `v<version>` tag
manually).

**Every change adds a changeset instead of a version bump** — package
source, docs, these instructions, or the spec skills in `.claude/skills/`.
Write a uniquely named file under `.changeset/` (unique files can't
conflict between concurrent PRs):

```md
---
"@cavelang/core": patch
---

One-line summary of the change.
```

Name one public `@cavelang/*` package from the fixed group — one you touched,
or `@cavelang/core` for spec/docs-wide changes; the fixed group bumps every
package together. Private workspaces such as `@cavelang/mcp` and
`@cavelang/website` sit outside the group, so a changeset naming only them
would not advance the release; CI and `scripts/release-validate.mjs` reject it.
Internal packages bundled into the public CLI, including `act`, `automate`,
`shape` and `sync`, are also outside that group. Their changesets must include
`@cavelang/cli` at the intended release severity; naming only the internal
workspace does not advance the public release. Check current package manifests
and `.changeset/config.json` when choosing the owner.

- patch (0.x.Y) — fixes, docs, instruction/skill wording that doesn't
  change semantics
- minor (0.X.0) — new features, new CLI surface, spec/skill additions or
  semantic changes

CI rejects PRs that add no changeset. A change without a changeset is an
incomplete change.

The release toolchain pairs Changesets CLI 3.0.2 with action 2.1.2. Run
`pnpm run version-packages` only with pending changesets: an empty run fails
before synchronization or grammar generation. The synchronizer adds changelog
entries for any workspace versions it aligns after Changesets, since the
action reads them when constructing the version PR.

Releases are automated (.github/workflows/publish.yml): merged changesets
accumulate in a `chore(release): version packages` PR; merging it bumps
every version source, publishes to npm and tags `v<version>`. The publish
workflow runs `release-validate.mjs --mode=version-pr` while changesets are
pending: this validates Changesets configuration, fixed-group membership,
changeset structure, and workspace dependency ranges while allowing the
version PR to repair manifest drift. Once the version PR consumes the pending
changesets, `--mode=publish` requires exact package, derived-manifest,
