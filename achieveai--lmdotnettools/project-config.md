# Enhanced Cursor Rules with Self-Review Process

## CRITICAL: Review Process Before Task Completion

Before completing any coding task, you MUST perform a thorough self-review focusing on the following areas:

### Design Pattern Review
- Identify and explicitly name the design patterns used in the solution
- Verify that the chosen patterns are appropriate for the problem domain
- Check if patterns are implemented correctly and completely
- Ensure patterns are consistently applied across related components
- Look for opportunities to refactor toward cleaner pattern implementations

### Code Duplication Detection
- Scan all newly written code for duplicated or similar code blocks
- Check for duplicated logic across different files and components
- Identify opportunities to extract repeated code into reusable methods
- Look for similar functionality that could be abstracted into base classes or utilities
- Cross-reference with existing codebase to avoid reimplementing existing functionality

### Async Code Validation
- NEVER use blocking methods like `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` or `.Result` on async tasks
- Always use async/await pattern consistently throughout the codebase
- Ensure proper propagation of async calls up the call stack
- Check for potential deadlocks in async code
- Verify that cancellation tokens are properly used where appropriate
- Ensure exception handling in async code follows best practices

### External Knowledge
- When encountering unfamiliar frameworks or libraries, search the web for best practices
- Research modern approaches before implementing solutions for complex problems
- Look up official documentation for APIs being used
- Verify compatibility between different libraries and frameworks
- Check for deprecated methods or approaching obsolescence

### Build and Test Validation
- Use `dotnet build` to verify code compiles without warnings
- Run `dotnet test` to validate that all tests pass
- Address any build warnings that appear during compilation
- Fix test failures before considering the task complete
- Run appropriate linting tools as part of the review

## Test Code Standards

### Data-Driven Testing Approach
- Structure all test code to be data-driven by default
- Separate test logic from test data
- Design tests to easily accommodate new test cases by simply adding data samples
- Use parameterized tests for testing multiple scenarios with the same logic
- Implement test data factories to generate varied test cases
- Minimize the number of test methods; instead, have fewer methods that run against more data points
- Each data sample should clearly indicate its purpose in the test name or description

### Diagnostic Output for Debugging
- Use `System.Diagnostics` for writing debug output in test code
- Include detailed context in diagnostic messages
- Log input parameters and output results for each test case
- Write diagnostic information for each critical step in test execution
- Use different verbosity levels appropriately (Verbose, Debug, Information, etc.)
- Format diagnostic output to be easily readable in test runners
- Include timing information for performance-sensitive operations
- Ensure diagnostic output clearly identifies which test case is running when using data-driven tests

## Production Code Standards

### SOLID Principles Enforcement
- Single Responsibility: Each class should have only one reason to change
- Open/Closed: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- Interface Segregation: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Clean Code Practices
- Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions
- Keep methods short and focused (generally under 20 lines)
- Minimize method parameters (generally 3 or fewer)
- Avoid deeply nested code blocks (maximum nesting level of 3)
- Write self-documenting code with appropriate comments for complex logic
- Use immutable objects where possible
- Follow consistent formatting and style throughout the codebase

### Error Handling
- Use appropriate exception types for different error scenarios
- Include meaningful error messages that aid debugging
- Log exceptions with full context at appropriate levels
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures where appropriate
- Never swallow exceptions without proper handling
- Use defensive programming techniques for critical code paths
