### Feature Implementation

When implementing new features:

1. **State Management**: Use Provider for state management
2. **Platform Services**: Use the InstalledApps package for app-related operations
3. **Settings Storage**: Use shared_preferences for storing user settings
4. **Image Handling**: Use image_picker for wallpaper selection

## Testing

2. **Widget Tests**: Test individual widgets
3. **Integration Tests**: Test complete user flows

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Setting

1. Add the setting key to a constants file
2. Create the UI component in the settings screen
3. Implement the storage logic using shared_preferences
4. Update the relevant parts of the app that use the setting
