# Project Conventions

## Performance Optimization Process
When working on performance issues:
1. Always measure before fixing — use chrome-devtools-mcp for profiling
2. Document every optimization in docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md
3. Follow the OPT-NNN format (see that file for structure)
4. Include: problem, alternatives with tradeoffs, decision rationale, before/after measurements
5. If profiling shows an issue is within frame budget (16.6ms), move it to Rejected/Deferred
6. Commit optimization code and doc update together

## Commit Conventions
- perf: prefix for performance changes
- fix: prefix for bug fixes
- Include measurable results in commit body when applicable
