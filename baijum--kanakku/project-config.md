# Self-Improvement Guidelines

## Rule Maintenance

- Update rules when new patterns emerge
- Add examples from actual codebase
- Remove outdated patterns
- Cross-reference related rules

## Rule Improvement Triggers

- New code patterns not covered by existing rules
- Repeated similar implementations across files
- Common error patterns that could be prevented
- New libraries or tools being used consistently
- Emerging best practices in the codebase

## Analysis Process

- Compare new code with existing rules
- Identify patterns that should be standardized
- Look for references to external documentation
- Check for consistent error handling patterns
- Monitor test patterns and coverage
- **Rule Validation/Testing (Mental Walkthrough)**: Before finalizing a new rule or a significant modification to an existing rule, 'test' it by mentally walking through its application against recent, relevant code changes or feature implementations in `kanakku`. Does the rule clearly and unambiguously guide towards the desired outcome? Are there edge cases it doesn't cover well? Would it have prevented a recent bug or inconsistency?
- **AI Feedback Loop Integration**: If you, the AI assistant, find yourself frequently misunderstanding a rule, misapplying it, or needing to ask for clarification on a specific rule despite it existing, this is a strong signal that the rule itself needs improvement. Propose changes to that rule to enhance its clarity, specificity, or provide better examples relevant to your interpretation challenges.
- **Prioritization of Rule Improvements**: When proposing multiple rule changes, indicate if some are more critical than others. Prioritize updates or additions to rules that address:
    1.  Security vulnerabilities.
    2.  Core architectural principles of `kanakku`.
    3.  Frequently recurring bugs, inconsistencies, or code review comments.
    4.  Areas prone to significant AI misinterpretation leading to incorrect or suboptimal code.
- When proposing changes to these `.mdc` rule files for `kanakku`, clearly state:
    1.  The specific problem the proposed change addresses (e.g., ambiguity in current rule X, lack of coverage for scenario Y, observed AI misinterpretation pattern Z).
    2.  How the proposed new wording, example, or section provides a clearer, more actionable, or less ambiguous guideline for `kanakku` development.
  Ensure your proposals align with the formatting and intent of `cursor_rules.mdc` and the overall goal of improving code quality and AI assistance for this specific project.
- Avoid proposing rule changes that are overly prescriptive for minor stylistic preferences if `kanakku`'s current codebase is already largely consistent in that area and it doesn't impact correctness, security, or maintainability. Focus on rules that have a tangible impact on these key areas or significantly improve clarity for both human developers and AI assistants working on `kanakku`.

## Rule Updates

### Add New Rules When

- A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
- Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
- Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
- New security or performance patterns emerge

### Modify Existing Rules When

- Better examples exist in the codebase
- Additional edge cases are discovered
- Related rules have been updated
- Implementation details have changed

## Example Pattern Recognition

// If you, the AI, observe repeated patterns in the `kanakku` codebase, such as:

// In multiple Flask route handlers:
// File: app/some_feature/routes.py
// @bp.route('/items/<int:item_id>', methods=['GET'])
// @jwt_required()
// def get_item(item_id):
//     current_user_id = get_jwt_identity()
//     item = Item.query.filter_by(id=item_id, owner_id=current_user_id).first()
//     if not item:
//         return jsonify({"error": "Not Found", "message": "Item not found or not owned by user"}), 404
//     return jsonify(item_schema.dump(item)), 200

// In another route handler:
// File: app/other_feature/routes.py
// @bp.route('/widgets/<int:widget_id>/update', methods=['PUT'])
// @jwt_required()
// def update_widget(widget_id):
//     current_user_id = get_jwt_identity()
//     widget = Widget.query.filter_by(id=widget_id, user_id=current_user_id).first_or_404() // using first_or_404
//     # ... update logic ...
//     return jsonify(widget_schema.dump(widget)), 200

// Consider proposing an update to `backend.mdc` or a new `data_access_patterns.mdc`:
// - **Standardizing Resource Ownership Checks:** "Create a reusable decorator or helper function to consistently check resource ownership against `current_user_id` from JWT, abstracting the `filter_by(owner_id=current_user_id).first_or_404()` logic."
// - **Consistent Not Found Handling:** "Specify whether to use `.first()` then check `if not item:` and return custom 404, or to consistently use `.first_or_404()` which raises a Werkzeug NotFound exception (handled by a global error handler)."
// - **Service Layer Abstraction:** "Reinforce that direct `Model.query` calls should ideally be in a service layer, not route handlers."

## Rule Quality Checks

- Rules should be actionable and specific
- Examples should come from actual code
- References should be up to date
