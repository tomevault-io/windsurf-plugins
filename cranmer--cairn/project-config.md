# Cairn — Development Guide

This repository is the development home of **Cairn**, a tool and design standard for hybrid human/AI research collaboration. Read this file first; deeper context lives in the documents referenced below.

## What Cairn is

Cairn defines a repository structure, file schemas, and conventions for maintaining a research group's shared project memory. The substrate is a git repository organized following Cairn's conventions — *a cairn*. Around this substrate, Cairn provides a Python package for scaffolding and managing cairns, plus reference patterns for layered augmentations (MCP server, meeting capture, AI collaborators).

**Capitalization matters.** "Cairn" (capitalized) is the framework — this repo, the package, the conventions. "a cairn" (lowercase) is an instance — a specific research project's repository following those conventions. Maintain this distinction in code, docs, commits, and conversation.

## Where to find what

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — the design document. Read before making structural changes.
- `USER_STORIES.md` — testable user stories. The primary specification. When implementing a feature, reference the relevant `US-NN` ID.
- `figures/` — architecture diagrams referenced by ARCHITECTURE.md.
- `docs/index.html` — polished overview for sharing with colleagues; also the GitHub Pages landing page.
- `docs/splash.html` — splash page.
- `templates/default/` — the canonical cairn template that `cairn init` will scaffold from (to be built).
- `src/cairn/` — the Python package source (to be built).

## Current phase

**Phase 0 (Foundation) is complete.** Shipped: the canonical template at `templates/default/`, Pydantic v2 schemas for the five state files, and the CLI commands `cairn init`, `cairn collaborator add`, `cairn decision add`, `cairn validate`, `cairn status` (US-P-01 through US-P-06). 64 tests passing. See `docs/decisions/` for ADRs locking in YAML library, git library, template engine, and ID/timestamp conventions.

**Phase 1 (Agent skills + supporting commands) is complete.** Shipped: `cairn exploration start`, `cairn exploration close`, `cairn action add`, `cairn action complete`, and bundled Claude Code-style `SKILL.md` files in `templates/default/skills/` (`orient`, `search-history`, `start-exploration`, `resolve-exploration`, `complete-action`, `log-finding`) that ship into newly-scaffolded cairns via `cairn init`. Covers US-A-01, US-A-03, US-A-04, US-A-05, US-A-09 (plus US-A-02 from Phase 2). Exploration lifecycle now has both halves — opening and closing — so explorations don't accumulate without resolution.

**Phase 2 — Python package extensions — is in progress.** Targets and status:

- [x] US-A-02 + `cairn finding add`: finding files at `knowledge/findings/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` with YAML frontmatter (date, author, title, slug, related, exploration). Bundled `log-finding` skill in `templates/default/skills/`. `cairn validate` checks finding filenames, frontmatter schema, author/related cross-references.
- [ ] US-P-07: Meeting import — `cairn meeting import --from zoom <file>` produces `knowledge/meetings/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with frontmatter and an optional `<date>-staged.yaml` of inferred decisions / action items for human review.
- [ ] US-P-08: Artifact export — `cairn artifact export --format <astra|ara|ro-crate>` produces a directory in the chosen specification's layout. Stubs that pass schema validation are acceptable early.
- [ ] US-P-09: Agenda draft — `cairn agenda draft --since <date|last-meeting>` writes a markdown agenda assembled from flagged items, explorations needing review, recent open questions, due action items, and recent findings.

**Phase 3 — MCP server alongside the repo — has started.** Tier-1 ships an `[mcp]`-extra `cairn mcp` subprocess (stdio transport, FastMCP) plus a single user-level registry (`~/.config/cairn/server.toml`) so one MCP server serves multiple cairns (ADR-0010). Tools so far: `whoami`, `status`, `get_open_questions`, `get_action_items`, `add_decision`, `add_finding`, `add_action`, `complete_action` — all per ADR-0009's Tier-1 list. New CLI commands: `cairn register`, `cairn unregister`, `cairn registered`, `cairn link`, `cairn mcp`. Tier 2 (explorations, findings reads, search) and Tier 3 (full read surface) follow once UX testing of Tier 1 surfaces what's missing.

Out of scope until later phases: meeting capture automation (Phase 4), AI collaborator runtime with scheduling/permissions enforcement (Phase 5), voice mode (Phase 6), artifact export (Phase 2 / US-P-08), meeting import (Phase 2 / US-P-07). Don't speculatively scaffold these.

## Backlog (not yet phased)

Carried items that are not blocking a phase but should be picked up when convenient:

- ~~Agent-driven bootstrap doc~~ — *done*. `AGENT-BOOTSTRAP.md` lives at the repo root and is linked from `QUICKSTART.md`.
