# Security Policy

## Context Exclusions

The following file patterns must never be read, displayed, included in context, or committed:

- `**/kubeconfig`
- `**/kubeconfig.*`
- `**/.env`
- `**/.env.*`
- `**/secrets/**`
- `**/*.pem`
- `**/*.key`

## Credential Handling

- Only use the kubeconfig path the user explicitly provides. Never read or display its contents.
- No secrets, tokens, passwords, or credentials in commits or documentation.
- If a tutorial requires credentials (e.g., pull secrets), use placeholder values and document that the user must substitute their own.

## Cluster Safety

- MCP servers run with minimal required permissions.
- Never modify cluster-wide resources (CRDs, cluster roles, nodes) without explicit human confirmation.
- Never delete resources that were not created during the current session.
