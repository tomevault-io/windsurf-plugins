# OpenShift Virtualization Cookbook

Antora-based AsciiDoc documentation project. Tutorials live in `modules/<module>/pages/*.adoc`.

## Rules

Read and follow these rules files on every interaction:

- `.cursor/rules/shared-constraints.mdc` -- git policy, commit attribution, content rules, build gate
- `.cursor/rules/project-guidelines.mdc` -- AsciiDoc standards, review criteria, terminology, domain guidance
- `.cursor/rules/security-policy.mdc` -- credential handling, context exclusions, cluster safety
- `.cursor/rules/allowed-commands.mdc` -- whitelist of CLI commands

## Commit Attribution

When committing with Claude Code, use this trailer instead of the Cursor one:

```
Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```
