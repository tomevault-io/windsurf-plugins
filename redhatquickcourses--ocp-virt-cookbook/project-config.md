# Shared Constraints

These rules apply to every agent persona in the OpenShift Virtualization Cookbook project. Individual personas may add stricter rules on top of these but must never relax them.

## Git Policy

- Work only on a local branch for the specific task. Never work on `main`.
- Commit changes to that branch for human review.
- NEVER open pull requests. NEVER push to any remote. NEVER comment on Issues or PRs remotely.
- All changes stay local until the human user decides to push or open a PR.

**PR Reviewer exception:** The PR Reviewer persona is read-only. It never commits, never pushes, and never modifies the fetched branch. It writes logs to `.cursor/output/` and generates `gh api` commands but never executes them.

## Commit Attribution

Every commit MUST include the following trailer as the **last line** of the commit message body, separated from the rest of the body by a blank line:

```
Co-authored-by: cursor[bot] <206951365+cursor[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>
```

Use a HEREDOC to pass multi-line commit messages so the trailer is preserved exactly:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<short title line>

<optional body>

Co-authored-by: cursor[bot] <206951365+cursor[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>
EOF
)"
```

## Upstream Repository

The upstream repository for all `gh` commands is:

```
RedHatQuickCourses/ocp-virt-cookbook
```

Always use `--repo RedHatQuickCourses/ocp-virt-cookbook` when generating `gh` commands that target the upstream.

## Tutorial Content Rules

- Code blocks in tutorials must **NEVER** contain bash loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals (`if/then`), or multi-line shell scripts.
- Each code block should contain a single command (or a single tightly coupled pipeline). When a step involves multiple commands, use a separate code block for each with a brief sentence of prose between them.
- Host-side commands (`oc`, `virtctl`, `kubectl`) and guest-side commands (commands run inside a VM) must not be in the same code block. Separate them with prose explaining the context switch.
- Single-line commands are acceptable as long as they are not overly complex with multiple pipes and/or `awk`/`sed` with regex.
- When a code block starts with a shell command that embeds YAML (e.g., `oc apply -f - <<EOF`), tag it `[source,bash,role=execute]`, not `[source,yaml]`.

## Build Gate

- Run `npm run build` before committing. Fix any errors first.
- A failing build is a blocker; do not commit broken builds.
