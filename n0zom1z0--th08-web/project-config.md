# TH08 reconstruction agent rules

This repository reconstructs one exact binary: the original Japanese TH08
version 1.00d executable identified below and in `reccmp-project.yml`. Do not
analyze or substitute a localized, patched, trial, or earlier executable.

## Before changing reconstruction state

1. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/RE_WORKFLOW.md`, and the relevant source.
2. Verify `resources/th08.exe`: SHA-256
   `330fbdbf58a710829d65277b4f312cfbb38d5448b3df523e79350b879213d924`
   and size `840704` bytes.
3. Confirm the address and symbol in `config/mapping.csv` and the appropriate
   `config/reccmp-*.csv` files before editing.
4. Inspect target instructions with a target-safe backend. Reconcile function
   boundaries against disassembly; Ghidra/IDA function extents are evidence,
   not accepted compiler boundaries.
5. Build and compare the smallest affected source/object before broad edits.

## Evidence and status rules

- Keep target observations, upstream reconstruction claims, adjacent-version
  inferences, and unknowns distinct.
- [GensokyoClub/th08](https://github.com/GensokyoClub/th08) is the imported
  reconstruction baseline. Its complete Git history and original contributor
  attribution must remain intact.
- The [N0zoM1z0/th07 reconstruction](https://github.com/N0zoM1z0/th07)
  supplies this repository's workflow and structure. TH07 source and TH06 are
  supporting evidence only: confirm names, ABI, field offsets, side effects,
  and boundaries against TH08 1.00d.
- Never mechanically paste decompiler output as source.
- `config/implemented.csv` selects upstream implementations; it is not proof of
  an exact match. Likewise, an entry in `config/mapping.csv` or
  `config/reccmp-functions.csv` is a mapping, not a matching claim.
- Only a reproducible reccmp/objdiff result against the exact target may support
  an exact-match claim. Do not invent or manually transcribe progress numbers.

## Analysis database safety

IDA MCP is attached to whichever file is open in the GUI and has no reliable
program selector. Treat all TH08 IDA queries as blocked until the GUI is
switched to TH08 and the database is attested under `docs/IDA_MCP.md`.
The canonical SHA-256 applies to `resources/th08.exe`; an IDB or its loader
metadata can report a different input/container hash. That difference is not
itself evidence of a different mapped image. In that case, verify the
canonical file first, then compare IDA bytes at `.text` start, entry point,
the function being edited, and at least two separated `.text` locations
against `resources/th08.exe`. Only byte-for-byte agreement plus matching image
base/entry/.text extent permits IDA semantic evidence. Exact-match claims
remain reproducible comparisons against the canonical file only.

Until then, use read-only `objdump`/`llvm-objdump`, a correctly imported local
Ghidra project, and the upstream mappings. Do not write TH08 names or types into
the TH07 database. Never patch target bytes.

## ABI and implementation

- Preserve the Visual C++ .NET 2002 x86 ABI: calling conventions, field widths,
  class layout, vtable order, exception behavior, static initialization, and
  translation-unit boundaries.
- Prefer source expressions that plausibly produced the target. Do not use
  copied machine-code arrays, native assembly, inline assembly, naked-assembly
  byte dumps, fake returns, empty behavior, ABI lies, or arbitrary padding to
  force a comparison. Exact matching must come from natural VC7 emission of
  evidence-backed C/C++ behavior.
- Keep generated files under `build/` and private analysis under `.analysis/`.
- Do not commit original executables, game archives, IDA/Ghidra databases,
  downloaded toolchains, generated reports, credentials, or private keys.

## Single-agent sessions

- Use one writable agent/session at a time. Do not delegate reconstruction or
  matching to subagents, and do not run concurrent Wine/VC7 builds.
- Start by reading `docs/RE_HANDOFF.md`, inspecting `git status`, and running
  `scripts/analysis/report-reconstruction-status.py --summary`. Treat prose
  snapshots as secondary to the ledgers.
- `config/claims.csv` is retained only as a schema-compatible empty file. It is
  not a task list; single-agent work must leave it header-only.
- Keep one bounded address or one coherent repository-maintenance batch in
  flight. Commit stable checkpoints before a browser/session handoff.
- Re-run affected accepted units after shared header, layout, compiler-flag,
  object-partition, or global-mapping changes.
- Before publishing aggregate exact totals, or after any shared change that may
  affect more than one object, run
  `python3 scripts/analysis/verify-exact-units.py --all`. This command performs
  a single-job cold build of every configured comparison object by default,
  clearing both Ninja outputs and known VC7/linker side outputs first.
  `--reuse-build` is diagnostic only and cannot support an aggregate claim.

## Handoff

Run the relevant normal/object build and comparison, followed by
`python3 scripts/ci.py` and `git diff --check`. Update `docs/RE_HANDOFF.md` when
the current phase or blocker changes. Report target addresses, evidence class,
exact result, and any unverified assumptions. If the exact executable or
analysis backend is unavailable, say so and stop short of a matching claim.
