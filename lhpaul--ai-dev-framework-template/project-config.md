## Code Quality Conventions

Follow the best practices defined in:

- General standards: `docs/best-practices/1-general.md`
- Version control: `docs/best-practices/2-version-control.md`
- Testing: `docs/best-practices/3-testing.md`
- Stack-specific: `docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md`

### Key rules (quick reference)

- Follow the principle of least surprise — write code that does what it looks like it does
- One logical responsibility per function
- No dead code, no commented-out code
- No unilateral refactoring outside the scope of the current task
- Validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs); trust internal code
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Fix all lint errors before committing — do not suppress warnings without justification

### When you find a convention not documented

If you consistently follow a pattern not yet documented in `docs/best-practices/`, add it. Keep best practice docs up to date — they are read by AI agents on every task.
