## AI Development Workflow

This project follows a staged AI-assisted development workflow. The canonical reference is:

`docs/workflow/development-workflow/README.md`

Repository-specific workflow providers live in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`. Today, `review.on_draft.runner` is consumed by the Step 7a internal review gate protocol, and `review.on_draft.github` / `review.on_ready.github` are consumed by `pr-review-loop.sh` (Step 7); other sections are advisory until more tooling adopts them. Legacy review keys remain accepted for one transition release.

### Stages and protocols

| Stage | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Write spec | `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/01-generate-spec-protocol.md` |
| Write plan | `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/02-generate-implementation-plan-protocol.md` |
| Implement | `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/03-implement-development-protocol.md` |
| Review gate | `REVIEW.md` and the compatibility wrappers under `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/` |
| Batch orchestrate | `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/90-batch-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` |
| Orchestrate one item | `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` |

### Key rules

- Always read the spec and plan before implementing (Refactor items have no spec — read the plan and work item brief instead)
- Continue through the review gate, PR readiness, and CI unless the protocol surfaces a real human decision
- Always update CHANGELOG before opening a PR (except spec/plan-only PRs; for fixes to unreleased work, update the existing entry instead of adding a new one; in parallel batches, each PR adds its own CHANGELOG entry as normal; merge conflicts are resolved at merge time); **hotfix exception**: `hotfix/*` PRs write a new versioned section (e.g., `[1.0.1] - YYYY-MM-DD`) as the **first `##` section** in `CHANGELOG.md` (above all existing headers, including prior hotfix versions and `[Unreleased]`) — hotfixes patch released code and are released immediately on merge
- No `git push --force`, `reset --hard`, or rebase on shared branches without explicit human approval
- Humans merge PRs — agents open them
