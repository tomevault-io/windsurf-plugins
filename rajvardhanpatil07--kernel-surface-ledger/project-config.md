# Instructions for coding agents

Read this before writing any code in this repository.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **`report.schema.json` is a frozen contract.** Read it first. Every artifact you produce must validate against it. If you believe it needs to change, say so and stop - do not change it unilaterally, and never change it without updating `fixtures/demo.json` in the same commit.

2. **The collector is strictly read-only.** Never write outside the explicit output path. Never load or unload a kernel module. Never modify a sysctl. Hardening artifacts are *generated for human review*, never applied.

3. **Degrade, never crash.** Every read of `/proc`, `/sys`, or `/boot` must tolerate `PermissionError` and `FileNotFoundError`, record the reason in `meta.skipped`, and continue. The tool must produce a useful partial report when run as an unprivileged user.

4. **The engine must be deterministic.** Sort every collection before emitting. No dependence on dict ordering, no randomness, no wall-clock values in scored fields. Two runs over the same `raw.json` must produce byte-identical `report.json`. There is a test for this.

5. **The LLM never decides anything.** It writes `ledger[].explanation`, `plan[].breakage_note`, `plan[].detection`, `plan[].revert`, and may render `plan[].artifact.content`. It must never influence a weight, a gate, a score, or an ordering. `--explain-only=false` must yield identical numeric output. There is a test for this.

6. **Do not invent risk weights or CVE mappings.** Those live in `data/weights.yaml` and `data/cve-map.json` and are curated by a human. Read them; never generate them.

7. **No secrets in the repo.** API configuration comes from `KSL_API_BASE`, `KSL_API_KEY`, `KSL_MODEL` environment variables only.

## Definitions you must implement exactly

- `present` - compiled in (`=y`), currently loaded, or loadable via module autoload (`modules.dep`).
- `reachable_unpriv` - `present` AND not blocked by its sysctl gate AND not blocked by lockdown/LSM AND (for device nodes) the mode grants non-root access.
- `used` - invoked or held open by at least one live workload during the observation window.
- `sole_owner_elements` - elements touched by exactly one workload.
- `surface_debt(w)` - `sum(weight of sole-owner elements) + sum(weight / n_touchers for shared elements)`.
- `marginal_contribution(w)` - `total_reachable_weight - total_reachable_weight_without_w`.
- `orphaned` - `present AND reachable_unpriv AND NOT used` by any workload, restricted
  to *removable* kinds (`syscall`, `module`, `devnode`, `namespace`, `capability`).
  Exclude `sysctl`, `kconfig`, and `lsm`: a misconfigured flag is a missing hardening
  setting, not orphaned surface, and `used` is not meaningful for it. Those still
  appear as plan candidates, just never in the orphaned set.

## Style

Python 3.11, type hints and docstrings on every public function, stdlib only in `collector/` (`jsonschema` and `PyYAML` are permitted in `engine/`). After writing code, run it and fix your own errors before reporting back.
