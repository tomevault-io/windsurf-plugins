## What is Warden

A container engine and control plane for running AI coding agents (Claude Code and OpenAI Codex) in isolated containers. Shipped as four binaries: `warden` (headless API server), `warden-desktop` (web UI), `warden-tui` (terminal UI), and `warden-tray` (system tray companion for desktop). The engine is also importable as a Go library. Requires Docker.

## Terminology (MUST follow)

Read @docs/developer/terminology.md before writing any code. It defines the required terms (Project, Worktree, Terminal), banned terms (Session, Conversation), worktree states, terminal actions, Claude activity sub-states, and the ownership boundary between Warden and Claude Code.

## Commands

### Development

```bash
go run ./cmd/warden-desktop   # Go API server + embedded SPA
npm --prefix web run dev      # Vite dev server (optional, for frontend HMR)
```

Dev UI at `http://localhost:5173`. Always use `:5173` to access the frontend app with HMR. The Go server on `:8090` does not serve the SPA when the Vite dev server is running.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT start dev servers.** The user runs `just dev` themselves. Never run `go run ./cmd/warden-desktop`, `npm --prefix web run dev`, `just dev`, or any command that starts a server on `:8090` or `:5173`. If you need the server running, ask the user. If you need to test API calls, use `curl` against the already-running server. Starting a competing server will kill the user's running instance or cause port conflicts.

If you make additions/changes to the webapp frontend code, you MUST also update the TUI code.

### Debugging

Proactively use the agent-browser skill to check and debug frontend code.

Use warden's audit api to track down container and server bugs.

### Testing & Quality

```bash
go test ./...                          # Go unit tests
npm --prefix web run test              # Frontend unit tests (Vitest)
npm --prefix web run typecheck         # TypeScript type checking
golangci-lint run ./...                # Go linter
npm --prefix web run format            # Format frontend code (Prettier)
npm --prefix web run lint              # Frontend linter (ESLint)
```

Run a single Go test:

```bash
go test ./engine/ -run TestParseGitWorktreeList
```

Run a single frontend test:

```bash
npm --prefix web run test -- --run lib/cost.test.ts
```

E2E tests (auto-builds frontend and starts Go backend if no server is running):

```bash
npm --prefix web run test:e2e
```

If the Vite dev server (`:5173`) or Go backend (`:8090`) is already running, E2E tests reuse it. Otherwise Playwright builds the frontend and starts `warden-desktop` automatically. No manual server setup required.

### Build

```bash
npm --prefix web run build                        # Frontend → web/dist/
go build -o bin/warden ./cmd/warden               # Headless server
go build -o bin/warden-desktop ./cmd/warden-desktop   # Desktop binary
```
