# nuxt-precog

> Your links, loaded before the click.

A Nuxt module that asks TypeSafe Jev which link a visitor is about to click, then warms
exactly that navigation with the Speculation Rules API and Nuxt's own preloading.

## Rules

- Keep it small, minimal and fast. No backward compatibility is needed yet.
- Fail open. Any error, timeout or missing key means "do nothing", never a broken page.
- The API key never reaches the browser. Every Jev call goes through the Nitro route.
- Jev only ever answers with candidate ids the server sent. The server checks that the
  returned ids are a subset of the request's ids before mapping them back to paths.
- Use simple English. Hyphens, never em dashes, in docs, comments and commit messages.
- Short comments only for what the code cannot say itself. No history, no restating code.
- Small conventional commits.
- Keep this file current.

## Layout

- `src/module.ts`: options, defaults, run-time config, wiring.
- `src/runtime/types.ts`: shared types for client, server and public API.
- `src/runtime/core/*`: pure logic (candidates, signals, state, policy, rules), unit tested.
- `src/runtime/server/*`: the Nitro route that talks to Jev through advocaat.
- `playground/`: demo site used for the recording and for e2e.
- `bench/`: synthetic-visitor benchmark harness.
- `docs/`: the documentation site, built with [undocs](https://github.com/unjs/undocs). One
  flat guide, no reference section.
- `.github/DECISIONS.md`: the running log of decisions taken against the plan. Add an entry
  whenever reality differs from what was planned.
- `client/`: the Nuxt DevTools tab, generated into `dist/client` on publish.

## Status

- M0 scaffold: module registered, options and run-time config in place, no-op client plugin.
- M1 core: `match`, `candidates`, `state`, `policy`, `rules` are pure and fully unit tested.
- M2 server: `POST {endpoint}` validates the body, rate limits per IP, caches in Nitro storage,
  runs the `precog:predict` hook, then calls Jev through advocaat's `typesafe()` client. Any
  failure is a 503 with an empty prediction. `test/mock-typesafe.ts` stands in for the real API
  so the suite runs offline; the live smoke test is skipped without `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`.
- M3 client: the orchestrator collects candidates, watches scroll and pointer, asks the server
  with one request in flight at a time, and writes one `<script type="speculationrules">`.
  Playwright drives real Chrome against the built playground; `e2e/spa-vs-document.spec.ts`
  is the measurement behind the two-effector design.
- M4 Nuxt integration: `preloadPayload` and `preloadRouteComponents` for the chosen routes,
  `takeOverNuxtLinkPrefetch`, `definePageMeta({ precog: false })`, `usePrecog()`, and the
  `precog:decision` and `precog:metrics` client hooks.
- M5 overlay: `?precog=debug` or Shift+P shows probability badges and a HUD. Registered only
  when `overlay` resolves true, so `overlay: "dev"` leaves nothing in a production build
  (`pnpm check:treeshake`). The DevTools tab is a dev-only iframe fed over a BroadcastChannel.
- M6 demo: the playground has a prerendered docs section, a server delay middleware, a control
  panel with the three arms (off, native, precog), and replay of recorded Jev answers so it
  needs a key in `playground/.env`; there is no stand-in outside the tests.
- M7 benchmark: `pnpm bench` drives seeded synthetic visitors through three arms and writes
  `bench/results/bench.md` and `bench.json`. The committed table is the real output, including
  the places where precog ties the browser.
- M8 release: README, the undocs site under `docs/`, changelog, and a tag-triggered publish
  workflow using npm trusted publishing. The quickstart was checked by installing the packed
  tarball into a fresh Nuxt app, which is how two packaging bugs surfaced.
