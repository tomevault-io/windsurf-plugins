# TW2004 decomp: start here

A matching decompilation of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 (GameCube, GW4E69). The goal is EA's code
exactly as EA wrote it; a PC port and mods start from that code later, and the decomp never bends
the C to suit a port. The byte match (`build/GW4E69/main.dol: OK`) is the proof the C is right.
Fidelity and parity outrank speed. Order (owner, 2026-09-26): (1) EA's own form, 32-bit habits and
all (a `// port:` note marks a hazard); (2) only when that can't be found, a labelled fake match
that leaves the logic exactly unchanged; (3) never change what the game does to satisfy the compiler.

The agent workflow (lanes, orchestrator, rounds) was removed on 2026-10-03 and is being rebuilt
with the owner from scratch. Until it is, there is no standing plan: ask the owner what to work on.
Findings worth keeping from the old workflow are in `docs/evidence/notes/` (EA bug register, misfiled
units, TW07/TW06 name pairing, and the evidence files the code and name log cite).

## Hard rules (the owner's; never relax them)

- **Only exactly 100% counts.** Every commit ends with `main.dol: OK`.
- **Never delete what you have not checked.** Chain the delete on the check.
- **No game files in git**: no `main.dol`, disc images, ELF/PDB/SELF, archives, art or other game
  data. The build gets `main.dol` from a private container (`tools/cloud/`, CI).
- **No official SDK files in the repo** (Nintendo or Metrowerks headers, libraries, documentation),
  and leaked SDK material is never discussed publicly. Decompiled SDK and runtime code taken from
  public decomps (`extern/`, each with its CREDITS/README) is fine.
- **Never edit C or headers through the shell** (sed, heredocs, echo, `python -c`): it strips
  backslashes. Use the editor tools; a repeated edit is a saved Python script, and its diff is read.
- **Names and comments are true to the code** (docs/style.md "Where names and comments come from"):
  EA's name when a related build or EA's own text confirms it; otherwise a name read carefully from
  the code (tier T3). Every name is logged with evidence in `config/GW4E69/name_sources.tsv`
  (`tools/naming/name.py`). `fake match:` / `port:` / `EA bug:` labels are kept.
- **Downloads, purchases, posts, messages: ask the owner first.** Secrets (tokens) are created and
  stored by the owner; never ask for their values.
- The owner is **mits** (GitHub `mitsevox`).

## Build and verify

```
python configure.py        # downloads compilers and tools (wibo on Linux)
ninja                      # must end with: build/GW4E69/main.dol: OK
ninja build/GW4E69/report.json     # objdiff scores (exact, matched %, linked code/data)
```
`orig/GW4E69/sys/main.dol` must exist first: locally it is already there; in the cloud run
`tools/cloud/setup.sh` (needs the owner's `TW_BUILD_TOKEN` secret). Docs: `docs/getting_started.md`,
`docs/workflow.md` (every command), `docs/compiler/decomp-notes.md` (the compiler rulebook: read "Try these
first"), `docs/style.md` (how the C must read).

## Working with the owner

- Plain, friendly English; short. Say what each code area does in the game ("GameEffects = the
  GameBreaker camera"), not just file names.
- Numbers exactly as measured (report.json), side by side: exact functions, matched code, code
  linked, data linked. Estimates come from measured pace, never gut feel.
