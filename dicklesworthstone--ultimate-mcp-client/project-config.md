# Agent Master Loop (AML) Architecture

The Agent Master Loop module in [agent_master_loop.py](mdc:agent_master_loop.py) orchestrates AI agents with complex cognitive functions. It manages the think-act cycle, integrates with the Unified Memory System (UMS), and leverages LLMs for decision-making.

## Key Components

### AgentState
Holds the complete runtime state of the agent including:
- Workflow context and workflow stack
- Goal stack for hierarchical task management
- Current plan with structured steps
- Error tracking and meta-cognition metrics
- Adaptive thresholds for reflection and consolidation

### AgentMasterLoop
Main orchestrator class implementing:
- Think-act-learn cycles with LLM interaction
- Context gathering and management
- Tool execution and error handling
- Meta-cognitive processes (reflection, consolidation)
- Background task management

## Core Functionality

### Planning & Execution
- Maintains explicit, modifiable plans with sequential steps
- Validates plan steps and detects dependency cycles
- Executes tools via MCPClient with argument sanitization
- Records detailed action history with dependencies

### Memory & Goal Management
- Goal Stack: Hierarchical goal decomposition and tracking
- Working Memory: Smart optimization based on relevance
- Memory Promotion: Background elevation of memories to higher cognitive levels
- Memory Linking: Automatic creation of semantic relationships

### Meta-Cognition
- Reflection: Self-analysis for progress monitoring
- Consolidation: Synthesizing information into insights
- Adaptive Thresholds: Dynamic adjustment based on performance
- Mental Momentum: Bias for maintaining productive workflows

## Error Handling
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Structured error categorization for recovery
- Consecutive error tracking with safety limits
- Graceful degradation and shutdown mechanisms
