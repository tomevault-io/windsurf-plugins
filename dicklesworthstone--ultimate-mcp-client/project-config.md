# Observability & Monitoring

The MCP Client implements comprehensive observability and monitoring features in [mcp_client.py](mdc:mcp_client.py) to provide insights into operations and performance.

## Telemetry

### OpenTelemetry Integration
- Metrics (counters, histograms) for monitoring client operations
- Tracing with spans for server requests and tool execution
- Console exporters (can be enabled for debugging)
- Configurable export targets

### Metrics Collected
- Tool execution counts and latency
- Server connection success/failure rates
- Query processing times
- Cache hit/miss ratios

## Live Dashboards

### CLI Dashboard
- Real-time TUI dashboard via `/dashboard` command
- Built with Rich library
- Shows server health, tool usage stats, and client info
- Refreshes periodically with the latest data

### Web UI Status
- Dynamic server status indicators
- Health indicators for connected services
- Capability counts (tools, resources, prompts)
- Connection state visualization

## Logging

### Rich Console Output
- Uses Python's logging with RichHandler
- Pretty console output with color coding
- Tracebacks with syntax highlighting
- Configurable verbosity levels

### STDIO Server Logs
- Captured stderr output from stdio servers
- Written to log files in config directory
- Critical for diagnosing server-side problems

## Debug Features

### Verbose Mode
- `--verbose` flag for detailed logging
- Enables detailed JSON-RPC message logging
- Shows internal state transitions

### Error Handling
- MCP_CLIENT_DEBUG environment variable for full tracebacks
- Structured error reporting
- Retry metrics and circuit breaker status
