# Conversation Management

The MCP Client implements a sophisticated conversation management system in [mcp_client.py](mdc:mcp_client.py) that goes beyond simple chat history.

## Conversation Graph

### Core Structure
- Non-linear conversation history with branching support
- Each branch point is a `ConversationNode` with its own message history
- Forkable conversations allow exploring different interaction paths
- Supported in both CLI and Web UI interfaces

### Persistence
- Complete conversation graphs saved to JSON files
- Preserves all branches and messages across sessions
- Supports import/export for sharing or backup

## Context Management

### Working Memory
- Automatic or manual optimization of conversation context
- Summarization of long histories to stay within context limits
- Focus mechanisms for highlighting important info

### Dynamic Prompts
- Inject pre-defined prompt templates from servers
- Apply templates to current conversation context

## Web UI Visualization

### Branch Visualization
- Interactive tree view showing the conversation structure
- Visual indicators for current branch and branch points
- Click-to-checkout functionality for navigating between branches

### Branch Management
- Create new branches from any point
- Clear the current branch without losing history
- Import/export specific branches as needed

## CLI Commands

Key conversation management commands include:
- `/fork [name]` - Create a new branch
- `/branch list` - Show available branches
- `/branch checkout <id>` - Switch to a different branch
- `/export [--id <id>] [--output <file>]` - Export conversations
- `/import <file>` - Import conversation from file
- `/optimize` - Summarize conversation context
- `/clear` - Clear current branch messages
