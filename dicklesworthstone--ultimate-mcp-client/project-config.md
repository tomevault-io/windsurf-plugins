# Package Management with uv

This project uses `uv` instead of `pip` for Python package management. UV is a much faster alternative to pip with improved dependency resolution.

## Key Commands

To update the lockfile with the latest compatible dependencies:
```bash
uv lock --upgrade
```

To install all dependencies including optional extras:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

## Configuration

Dependencies are specified in [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml) rather than requirements.txt.

Benefits of this approach:
- Faster installation times
- Better dependency resolution
- Reproducible builds with lockfile
- Clear separation between development and production dependencies
- Support for optional feature groups via extras

When adding new dependencies, add them to the appropriate section in pyproject.toml and then run the lock command.
