# Server Discovery & Integration

The MCP Client provides multiple mechanisms to discover and integrate with MCP servers as implemented in [mcp_client.py](mdc:mcp_client.py).

## Discovery Methods

### File System Discovery
- Searches configured directories for potential STDIO server scripts
- Default paths include `.mcpclient_config/servers`, `~/mcp-servers`, etc.
- Auto-detected on startup when enabled in config

### mDNS/Zeroconf Discovery
- Real-time discovery of MCP servers on the local network
- Listens for services advertised under `_mcp._tcp.local.`
- Managed via the `/discover` command suite
- Can be automated with background scanning

### Local Port Scanning
- Actively scans configured port ranges for potential MCP servers
- Attempts MCP `initialize` handshake to detect compatible servers
- Configured via `/config port-scan` commands
- Useful for discovering servers not using mDNS advertisement

### Remote Registries
- Connects to defined MCP registry URLs to find shared servers
- Typically used for discovering SSE-based MCP servers

### Claude Desktop Integration
- Auto-detects and imports configs from `claude_desktop_config.json`
- Intelligently adapts Windows/WSL paths and command structures
- Remaps Windows-style paths to their Linux/WSL equivalents

## Server Management

### Connection Types
- STDIO: Process-based servers using standard input/output
- SSE: HTTP Server-Sent Events based servers (REST endpoints)

### Server Lifecycle
- Health monitoring with automatic recovery attempts
- Connection retries with exponential backoff
- Circuit breakers for consistently failing servers

### STDIO Safety
The client implements multiple layers to prevent accidental STDIO corruption:
- Output redirection to stderr when STDIO servers are active
- Context managers for critical operations
- Safe console utilities for UI display
