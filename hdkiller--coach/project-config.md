## Coach Watts Hot Context

This file tracks ongoing project state, active blockers, and recent architectural changes that haven't yet been formalized in `RULES.md` or `docs/`.

### Active Status & Known Issues

- **Typechecks**: The project has failing typechecks (TS2307, TS2578) across multiple existing files (share API, user store, fit utils). This is a known cleanup task.
- **Pricing Transition**: Transitioning from 'Free for Early Adopters' to tiered structure: Free ($0), Supporter ($8.99/mo), and Pro ($14.99/mo). See `docs/06-plans/pricing-and-entitlements.md`.

### Recent Integrations & Changes

- **Wellness Tracking**: Added Weight and Blood Pressure tracking via Intervals.icu.
- **Oura Integration**: Expanded to include SpO2, Stress, VO2 Max, and Weight. Raw biometrics (HRV/RHR) are strictly extracted to avoid score conflicts.
- **Location Tracking**: Added `cw:cli users location` tools to manage user countries based on last login IP.
- **Chat Stability**: fully stabilized using AI SDK v5 UIMessage schema. See `docs/04-guides/chat-development.md`.

### Feature Pointers

- **CLI Reference**: See `docs/04-guides/cli-reference.md`. **IMPORTANT**: Maintain this document whenever the CLI is updated or new issues/commands are found.
- **Nutrition Logic**: See `docs/02-features/nutrition/fueling-logic.md`.
- **System Messages**: See `docs/02-features/system-messages.md`.
- **Email System**: See `docs/02-features/email-communication.md`.
- **Chat Development**: See `docs/04-guides/chat-development.md`.
- **Timezone Handling**: See `docs/04-guides/timezone-handling.md`.

### Critical Prisma Workflow (DO NOT IGNORE)

- **NEVER use `prisma db push`**. It breaks migration history and causes schema drift.
- **NEVER use `prisma migrate reset`** on the local database unless explicitly told by the user. It destroys data.
- **Mandatory Migrations**: Whenever you modify `prisma/schema.prisma`, you MUST immediately create a migration file using `npx prisma migrate dev --name <descriptive_name>`. Do not commit schema changes without the corresponding `prisma/migrations` folder update.
- **Handling Schema Drift**: If `migrate dev` prompts to reset the database due to drift (e.g. "We need to reset the public schema"), **CANCEL IT**. You must resolve the drift manually by generating the SQL, creating a migration folder, and using `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied <name>` followed by `npx prisma migrate deploy`.
