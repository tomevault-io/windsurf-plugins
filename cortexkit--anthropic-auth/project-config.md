# Agent Notes

## Captured system prompts

The `captures/` directory is for local system-prompt captures from Claude Code and OpenCode via mitmproxy HTTPS interception. Capture artifacts are ignored by git; use them locally to verify proxy transform accuracy and understand what each tool sends to the Anthropic API.

- **Capture traffic**: `./scripts/capture-with-mitmproxy.sh -o <name>.flow -- <command>`
- **Extract prompt**: `bun run extract <name>.flow -o captures/<tool>-v<version>.txt`

See [captures/AGENTS.md](captures/AGENTS.md) for prerequisites, full workflow, and PII redaction rules.
