# Sim App Architecture

## Core Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component, hook, store has one clear purpose
2. **Composition Over Complexity**: Break down complex logic into smaller pieces
3. **Type Safety First**: TypeScript interfaces for all props, state, return types
4. **Predictable State**: Zustand for global state, useState for UI-only concerns

## Root-Level Structure

```
apps/sim/
├── app/                 # Next.js app router (pages, API routes)
├── blocks/              # Block definitions and registry
├── components/          # Shared UI (emcn/, ui/)
├── executor/            # Workflow execution engine
├── hooks/               # Shared hooks (queries/, selectors/)
├── lib/                 # App-wide utilities
├── providers/           # LLM provider integrations
├── stores/              # Zustand stores
├── tools/               # Tool definitions
└── triggers/            # Trigger definitions
```

## Feature Organization

Features live under `app/workspace/[workspaceId]/`:

```
feature/
├── components/          # Feature components
├── hooks/               # Feature-scoped hooks
├── utils/               # Feature-scoped utilities (2+ consumers)
├── feature.tsx          # Main component
└── page.tsx             # Next.js page entry
```

## Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (`WorkflowList`)
- **Hooks**: `use` prefix (`useWorkflowOperations`)
- **Files**: kebab-case (`workflow-list.tsx`)
- **Stores**: `stores/feature/store.ts`
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase with suffix (`WorkflowListProps`)

## Utils Rules

- **Never create `utils.ts` for single consumer** - inline it
- **Create `utils.ts` when** 2+ files need the same helper
- **Check existing sources** before duplicating (`lib/` has many utilities)
- **Location**: `lib/` (app-wide) → `feature/utils/` (feature-scoped) → inline (single-use)

## API Contracts

Boundary HTTP request and response shapes for all routes under `apps/sim/app/api/**` live in `apps/sim/lib/api/contracts/` (one file per resource family). Routes and clients consume the same contract — routes never define route-local boundary Zod schemas, and clients never define ad-hoc wire types. Domain validators that are not HTTP boundaries (tools, blocks, triggers, connectors, realtime handlers, internal helpers) may still use Zod directly; the contract rule is boundary-only.

- Each contract is built with `defineRouteContract({ method, path, params?, query?, body?, headers?, response: { mode: 'json', schema } })` and exports both schemas and named TypeScript type aliases (e.g., `export type CreateFolderBody = z.input<typeof createFolderBodySchema>`).
- Shared identifier schemas live in `apps/sim/lib/api/contracts/primitives.ts`.
- Routes validate via canonical helpers in `apps/sim/lib/api/server/validation.ts` (`parseRequest`, `validationErrorResponse`, `getValidationErrorMessage`, `isZodError`). Routes never `import { z } from 'zod'` and never use `instanceof z.ZodError`.
- Clients call `requestJson(contract, ...)` from `apps/sim/lib/api/client/request.ts`; hooks import named type aliases from contracts, never `z.input/z.output`.
- Routes under `apps/sim/app/api/v1/**` use `apps/sim/app/api/v1/middleware.ts` for shared auth, rate-limit, and workspace access. Compose contract validation inside that middleware.
- `bun run check:api-validation` enforces this policy and must pass on PRs.

`bun run check:api-validation:strict` is the strict CI gate and additionally fails on annotations with empty reasons. Four per-line opt-out forms are recognized: `// boundary-raw-fetch: <reason>` (placed immediately above a legitimate raw `fetch(` call in `apps/sim/hooks/queries/**` or `apps/sim/hooks/selectors/**` for stream/binary/multipart/signed-URL/OAuth-redirect/external-origin cases), `// double-cast-allowed: <reason>` (placed immediately above an `as unknown as X` cast outside test files), `// boundary-raw-json: <reason>` (placed immediately above a raw `await request.json()` / `await req.json()` read in a route handler that cannot go through `parseRequest` — JSON-RPC envelopes, tolerant `.catch(() => ({}))` parses), and `// untyped-response: <reason>` (placed immediately above a `schema: z.unknown()` response declaration in a contract file when the response body is genuinely opaque). The reason must be non-empty. Whole-file allowlists for routes that legitimately import Zod for non-boundary reasons go through `INDIRECT_ZOD_ROUTES` in `scripts/check-api-validation-contracts.ts`, not per-line annotations.
