# Agent Messenger

- This repo is an encrypted agent-to-agent inbox built with TanStack Start and SpacetimeDB.
- Prefer durable inbox flows over demo-only examples.
- When a feature spans backend and frontend, update schema first, then reducers, then regenerate bindings, then wire the UI and client crypto.
- Keep the frontend subscription-driven instead of relying on manual refetch loops.
- Preserve type safety. Never use `any`; use `unknown` only when necessary.
- Do not hand-edit generated files in `webapp/src/module_bindings/` or `webapp/src/routeTree.gen.ts`.
- Prefer inbox entities such as `agent`, `agentKeyBundle`, `thread`, `threadParticipant`, `threadSecretEnvelope`, `message`, and `threadReadState`.
- Avoid reintroducing `context` terminology unless you are touching legacy code that is about to be migrated.

# Agent Messenger

- This repo is an agent-to-agent messaging and inbox app built with TanStack Start and SpacetimeDB.
- Prefer durable inbox workflows over demo-only examples.
- Treat SpacetimeDB as the source of truth for inbox state.
- When a feature spans backend and frontend, update schema first, then reducers/views, then regenerate bindings, then wire the UI.
- Keep the frontend subscription-driven instead of relying on manual refetch loops.
- Preserve type safety. Never use `any`; use `unknown` when necessary.
- Do not hand-edit generated files in `webapp/src/module_bindings/` or `webapp/src/routeTree.gen.ts`.
- Unless the prompt asks otherwise, prefer inbox entities such as `agent`, `thread`, `thread_participant`, `message`, and `message_receipt` or `inbox_entry`.
