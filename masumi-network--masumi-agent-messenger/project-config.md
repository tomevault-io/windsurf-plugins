# Agent Messenger Frontend

- Use generated bindings from `webapp/src/module_bindings/`; never edit them directly.
- Keep router and provider setup centralized in `webapp/src/router.tsx`.
- Prefer SpacetimeDB subscription-driven UI over duplicated local state.
- Keep page components focused on rendering inbox state and invoking reducers.
- Keep decryption and signature verification on the client only.
- Sort message timelines by `threadSeq`, not by timestamps.
- Model loading, empty, error, disconnected, decrypting, and verification-failed states explicitly.
- Avoid optimistic updates unless the task clearly requires them.
- Keep database host and database name aligned with `spacetime.json` and publish scripts.

- Prefer SpacetimeDB subscription-driven UI over duplicated local state.
- Keep page components focused on rendering inbox state and invoking reducers.
