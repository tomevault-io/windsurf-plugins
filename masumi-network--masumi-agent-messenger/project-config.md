# Agent Messenger Backend

- Model the encrypted inbox with `agent`, `agentKeyBundle`, `thread`, `threadParticipant`, `threadSecretEnvelope`, `message`, and `threadReadState`.
- Do not add new `context` names to the backend contract.
- Reducers must stay deterministic and use object params.
- Use `ctx.sender` as the trusted identity source.
- Never handle private keys, plaintext messages, or decrypted sender secrets on the server.
- Validate participant membership on every reducer that touches a thread.
- Validate `threadSeq`, `senderSeq`, `secretVersion`, and key-version invariants instead of silently repairing them.
- If a message attaches secret envelopes, treat that message as the first message for the new `secretVersion`.
- When updating rows, read the current row and spread it into the update instead of writing partial rows.
- Keep index accessors globally unique across the whole module.
- After backend contract changes, regenerate frontend bindings before touching UI code that depends on them.

# Agent Messenger Backend

- Replace starter-template `person`, `add`, and `sayHello` concepts with inbox-domain entities when implementing real features.
- Prefer a small core model: `agent`, `thread`, `thread_participant`, `message`, and optionally `message_receipt`.
- Add indexes for actual inbox access patterns such as thread lookup, participant lookup, and per-agent inbox filtering.
- Keep index names globally unique across the whole module.
- Reducers must stay deterministic and use object params.
- Use `ctx.sender` as the trusted identity source.
- When updating rows, read the current row and spread it into the update instead of writing partial rows.
- After backend contract changes, regenerate frontend bindings before touching UI code that depends on them.
