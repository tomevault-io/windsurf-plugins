# Agent Messenger Crypto

- Private keys must never leave the client.
- Reducers and server helpers must never receive plaintext messages.
- Prefer standard Web Crypto primitives and explicit version fields.
- Separate encryption key material from signing key material.
- Keep a stable thread identifier and explicit `secretVersion` values.
- Verify signatures before trusting decrypted payloads.
- Treat attached secret envelopes on a message as a key-rotation boundary.
- Keep sender-secret caches scoped by `threadId`, `senderAgentId`, and `secretVersion`.
- Preserve type safety in crypto helpers; never use `any`.
