# ThinkRail

A ThinkRail-branded desktop-and-mobile client for the `pi` coding agent. The app is a thin host that
runs `pi` and bridges it to a rich UI; `pi` owns models, skills, compaction, cost, and session state.

Canonical specs (read these first):
- `goal-and-requirements.md` — product goal + V1/V2 scope
- `architecture.md` — top-level architecture, decisions, invariants

## Module structure & boundaries (top-priority requirement)

The app is built as a set of **clearly bounded modules**. This is a primary design requirement, not a
nice-to-have — treat it with the same weight as the non-negotiable invariants below.
- **Modules are fractal.** The boundary rule applies at *every* level: each package is a module, and the
  directories *inside* a package (`packages/server/src/agent/`, `apps/web/src/transport/`, …) are modules
  too. A sub-module is a directory with an `index.ts` **barrel** as its only public surface; siblings
  import it **through that barrel, never its internals**. (Exception: where a barrel would defeat
  code-splitting or a library's per-file convention — e.g. `apps/web/src/panels` and `components/ui`,
  which lazy-load Monaco/shiki/xterm — imports stay per-file and the boundary is held by spec + convention.)
- **Every module has a `SPEC.md`** that states its boundary explicitly: what it owns, what it exposes
  as its public surface, and what it must *not* reach into (allowed deps and forbidden deps). The
  **dependency edges *between* sibling sub-modules live in the parent module's `SPEC.md`** (a dependency
  graph), not in each leaf — leaves declare only their own external deps + forbidden reaches.
- **Boundaries should be covered by tests** where practical — a module's public surface and its
  boundary rules are worth exercising with tests, not just relying on convention. This is a goal, not a
  hard gate: aim for coverage, but don't block on guaranteeing it everywhere.
- **The spec leads the code.** A change that moves or blurs a boundary updates the module's `SPEC.md`
  first, then the code and the tests that pin it.

## Engine: `pi` only, in-process

Built around the `pi` coding agent, run **in-process** via `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`
(`createAgentSession`) — not a subprocess. No second runtime (no `claude-agent-sdk`), V1 or V2. We never
assemble the prompt ourselves; we influence the agent only by what we feed `pi` (context, files, `pi`
skills/extensions) and which flags we spawn it with.

Tradeoff: in-process means **no crash isolation** — a fatal agent/provider fault takes the whole host
down. Sessions still run concurrently (cooperative on one event loop); the subprocess RPC mode is the
only alternative if fault isolation ever becomes worth the complexity.

> The package scope is `@earendil-works/*`. The `@mariozechner/*` scope is the **deprecated** old name —
> do not use it.

## Architecture (three rings)

- **Engine host** — `packages/server` (+ `packages/shared`), launched by `apps/cli` (V1) or
  `apps/desktop` (Electrobun, deferred). `createServer()` = `Bun.serve` HTTP+WS + `AgentSessionManager`
  (one in-process `AgentSession` per tab) + handlers + persistence.
- **The wire** — `packages/contracts`: the typed, versioned protocol. Types-only.
- **UI client** — `apps/web`: mobile-first React, ships independently, dials a host over the wire.

V1 entrypoint is `apps/cli`: a `thinkrail` bin that boots the host in-process and opens the browser.
Remote/phone access (V2) is over Tailscale; auth stays external (the app carries an `owner` field).

**V1 shape (Worktree IDE):** left = projects (git repos) → workspaces (each a `git
worktree`, own branch/cwd, under `~/.thinkrail/worktrees`); center = a tabbed area of Monaco file tabs
+ chat tabs; right = an All-files tree + Changes (git diff) + terminals, all scoped to the active
worktree. The shell is built **first**, `pi` connected **last**. Deferred to V2: spec-graph viewer,
PR/Checks/Review.

## Repo layout

```
goal-and-requirements.md, architecture.md   top-level specs (repo root)
apps/
  cli/        V1 entrypoint: boot host + open browser   (SPEC.md)
  web/        mobile-first UI client                    (SPEC.md)
  desktop/    Electrobun launcher — DEFERRED            (SPEC.md)
packages/
  server/     createServer(): Bun.serve + AgentSessionManager  (SPEC.md)
  contracts/  the wire (types-only)                     (SPEC.md)
  shared/     shellEnv (server-side only)               (SPEC.md)
  spec-graph/ portable pi extension: spec_* tools + skill (SPEC.md)
```

## Spec graph (how decisions are recorded)

Architecture decisions live as spec-graph nodes, dogfooding the spec layer the product is about:
- Top-level specs (`goal-and-requirements.md`, `architecture.md`) in the **repo root**.
- Each module's spec is co-located as `<module>/SPEC.md`.
- Frontmatter: `id`, `type` (goal-and-requirements | architecture-design | module-design |
  submodule-design | task-spec), `status` (draft | active | stale | done | deprecated), `title`,
  `parent` (single link), `depends-on` / `references` / `implements` (link lists), `covers` / `tags`.
- **Specs are the source of truth and are updated during implementation.** A module spec is `draft`
