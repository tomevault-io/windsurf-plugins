# Agent instructions

This repository uses `mise` for tool versions and common development tasks.

- Run the full check with `mise run check`.
- Fix Go lint and formatting issues with `mise run fix`.
- Prefer running Go commands through mise, e.g. `mise exec -- go test ./...`, so the pinned Go version and environment from `mise.toml` are applied.
