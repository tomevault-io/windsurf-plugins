description: Parallel autonomous ML research agents with a Director, git worktrees for per-agent experiment branches, a Skills library for validated technique reuse, a Synthesizer that distills collective knowledge overnight, and circadian rhythm (leisure 03:00–06:00 for paper reading and creative thinking). Uses OpenClaw sessions_spawn, cron, and steer natively. Use when: (1) start or run ML research agents overnight, (2) check agent status or experiment results, (3) view leaderboard or morning digest, (4)

# Litmus — Parallel Autonomous ML Research Agents

Litmus spawns multiple OpenClaw subagents that experiment on your GPU overnight. Each runs on its
own **git branch** in a shared lab repository — every experiment is a commit, agents can read
each other's code, cherry-pick breakthroughs, and build on the global best at any time.

Validated techniques accumulate in a **Skills library** (`~/.litmus/shared/skills/`). A
**Synthesizer** runs at 04:00 to distill collective knowledge into skills and write a research
agenda for the next day. A **Director** runs every 2 hours to steer workers, trigger **Compass
Resets** on stagnation, and orchestrate cross-agent knowledge transfer.

**What makes it more than autoresearch**:
- Git worktrees: agents share one repo, each on their own branch — full experiment history,
  cherry-pick, and cross-agent code inspection via `git -C ~/.litmus/repo log --all`
- Skills library: validated techniques persist and compound — agents don't re-discover wins
- Synthesizer: distills all overnight notes into reusable skills and a research agenda
- Compass Reset: Director detects stagnation and forces structured pivots using the skills gap
- Two-phase experiment budget: quick 90-second check before committing to a full run
- Structured attempt records: JSON per experiment in `shared/attempts/` for rich analytics
- Leisure mode (03:00–06:00): workers read papers, write moonshot hypotheses, identify gaps
- Morning digest: research narrative delivered to your chat at 08:00

Everything is a native OpenClaw subagent. No external processes, no PID files.

## First-Time Setup

**Recommended** — ask your OpenClaw agent (runs a guided onboarding conversation):
> "Install https://clawhub.ai/kuberwastaken/litmus and set it up for my machine"

Full onboarding instructions: `{baseDir}/references/onboarding.md` — read that file first.

**Or manually:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuberwastaken/litmus ~/.litmus
bash ~/.litmus/scripts/setup.sh
```

Clones Karpathy's training harness, builds the shared lab git repo at `~/.litmus/repo/`,
installs Python deps via `uv`, downloads ~1 GB of training data. Wait for it to finish.

## Starting Research

### 1 — Prepare workspaces (creates git worktrees)

```bash
bash {baseDir}/scripts/prepare-agents.sh --agents 4 --templates architecture,optimizer,general,general
```

Creates git worktrees under `~/.litmus/agents/`, each on its own branch in `~/.litmus/repo/`.
The shared lab git repo means every agent's experiments are immediately visible to all others:
```bash
git -C ~/.litmus/repo log --all --oneline --graph
```

### 2 — Spawn research subagents

```
sessions_spawn
  task: "Read program.md in your current directory and run the research loop forever."
  runtime: "subagent"
  mode: "session"
  agentId: "litmus-worker-arch-1"
  cwd: "~/.litmus/agents/arch-1"
```

Repeat for each agent, then:
```
sessions_yield message: "Research agents running. I'll notify you on new discoveries."
```

**Templates**: `architecture` · `optimizer` · `regularization` · `general`
Full template details: `{baseDir}/references/templates/`

### 3 — Start the Director Layer

```bash
bash {baseDir}/scripts/setup-cron.sh --timezone "Your/Timezone"
```

Registers 6 cron jobs:

| Cron | Default schedule | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `litmus-director` | Every 2h during research hours | Reviews results, steers workers, Compass Reset on stagnation |
| `litmus-leisure` | 03:00 daily | Switches workers to paper-reading / creative thinking mode |
| `litmus-synthesizer` | 04:00 daily | Distills notes into skills library, writes research agenda |
| `litmus-dawn` | 06:00 daily | Wakes workers, queues synthesizer's priority experiments |
| `litmus-watchdog` | Every 30 min | Liveness check, disk check, escape mode on zero improvements |
| `litmus-digest` | 08:00 daily | Morning research narrative delivered to your chat |
| `litmus-archive` | Every 3 days | Cleanup old attempts + multi-day research checkpoint |

All times are configurable during onboarding — the setup agent pitches defaults and asks what you'd like to change. Common presets: night owl (01:00/02:00/04:00/07:00), early bird (23:00/00:30/02:00/05:30), intensive (1h director). Pass custom times to `scripts/setup-cron.sh` with `--leisure-start`, `--synthesizer-time`, `--dawn-time`, `--digest-time`, `--director-hours`, `--watchdog-minutes`, `--archive-days`.

## Managing Agents

**Status** (experiment counts, best val_bpb, git tree):
```bash
bash {baseDir}/scripts/status.sh
```

**Leaderboard** (cross-agent, from shared/attempts/ JSON):
```bash
bash {baseDir}/scripts/results.sh --top 10
bash {baseDir}/scripts/results.sh --agent arch-1  # single agent
```

**Full lab git history** (all agents' experiments as a tree):
```bash
git -C ~/.litmus/repo log --all --oneline --graph
```
