The main purpose of an MDC file is to provide context related to a specific topic.

 - the file extension for MDC files is .mdc.
 - MDC files are stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory.

## mdc file format

An MDC file consists of a header section with two fields:

description: A short description of the file's purpose.
globs: A file-matching pattern.

description: Use Bun for testing
globs: *.test.ts
---

This project uses Bun for unit testing.  
To run tests from the command line, use `bun test` or `bun test [path/to/file.test.ts]`.

bun:test has almost jest compatible functions like this.
import { describe, test, expect, beforeEach, afterEach } from "bun:test";
```
