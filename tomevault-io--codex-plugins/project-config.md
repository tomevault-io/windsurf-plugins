# Cursor Rules for Godot Agent MCP Project

## Code Quality Standards

### NO INLINE COMMENTS
- NEVER use inline comments (single # comments within function bodies)
- Inline comments indicate poor code quality and lack of experience
- If code needs explanation, refactor it into a well-named function with a docblock
- Code should be self-documenting through clear variable and function names

### Commenting Standards
- ONLY use docblock comments (## comments) for function/class documentation
- Docblocks should describe WHAT the function does, not HOW it does it
- Focus on the purpose, parameters, return values, and side effects
- No redundant comments that just repeat what the code obviously does

### MANDATORY DOCBLOCKS
- ALL public functions MUST have descriptive docblocks
- Docblocks must explain the function's purpose, parameters, return values, and side effects
- Private functions (starting with _) should have docblocks if their purpose isn't immediately obvious
- Include parameter types and return types in the description when helpful
- Document any exceptions or error conditions the function might encounter

### Code Structure
- If logic is complex enough to "need" inline comments, extract it to a separate function
- Use descriptive variable and function names that make the code self-explanatory
- Prefer small, focused functions with clear responsibilities
- Break down complex operations into well-named helper functions

### Examples of BAD commenting:
```gdscript
# Parse the request data  <-- NEVER DO THIS
var data = parse_request(request)

# Check if user is valid  <-- NEVER DO THIS  
if user.is_valid():
    # Process the user  <-- NEVER DO THIS
    process_user(user)
```

### Examples of GOOD commenting:
```gdscript
## Validates user credentials and processes authentication request
## Returns true if authentication succeeds, false otherwise
func authenticate_user(credentials: Dictionary) -> bool:
    var user = find_user_by_credentials(credentials)
    if not user or not user.is_valid():
        return false
    
    return process_authentication(user)

## Converts raw HTTP request data into a structured request object
## Parameters:
##   - raw_data: The complete HTTP request as a string
## Returns: Dictionary containing parsed headers, body, and method
## Throws: Returns error dictionary if request format is invalid
func parse_http_request(raw_data: String) -> Dictionary:
    # Implementation here
```

### Function Naming
- Use descriptive verb phrases for functions: `validate_input()`, `parse_json_request()`, `handle_authentication()`
- Use descriptive nouns for variables: `user_credentials`, `parsed_data`, `validation_result`
- Avoid abbreviations and single-letter variables (except for short loop counters)

### Refactoring Guidelines
- If you find yourself wanting to add an inline comment, stop and refactor instead
- Extract the code block into a function with a descriptive name
- The function name should explain what the inline comment would have said

## GDScript Specific Rules
- Follow GDScript naming conventions (snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes)
- Use type hints wherever possible
- Prefer `match` statements over long `if/elif` chains
- Use `const` for compile-time constants, `var` for variables

## Architecture Guidelines
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Keep classes focused on a single responsibility
- Separate concerns clearly between layers

## Implementing New Tools
- **ALWAYS read the README.md first** for comprehensive instructions on adding new tools
- The README contains detailed guidance on:
  - Tool architecture and base class patterns
  - Schema validation with Zodot
  - Registration process in plugin.gd
  - Testing requirements and examples
  - Code quality standards and examples
- Follow the existing tool patterns exactly (see addons/godot_agent_mcp/mcp/tools/)
- All tools must extend MCPTool and implement the four required methods:
  - get_name() - Unique tool identifier
  - get_description() - Human-readable description  
  - get_input_schema() - Zodot schema for parameter validation
  - run(params) - Tool execution logic
- Use Zodot for robust parameter validation - never manually validate parameters
- Register new tools in plugin.gd's tool array
- Include comprehensive docblocks for all public methods
