# Code-Based Routing

> [!TIP]
> Code-based routing is not recommended for most applications. It is recommended to use [File-Based Routing](../file-based-routing.md) instead.

## ⚠️ Before You Start

- If you're using [File-Based Routing](../file-based-routing.md), **skip this guide**.
- If you still insist on using code-based routing, you must read the [Routing Concepts](../routing-concepts.md) guide first, as it also covers core concepts of the router.

## Route Trees

Code-based routing is no different from file-based routing in that it uses the same route tree concept to organize, match and compose matching routes into a component tree. The only difference is that instead of using the filesystem to organize your routes, you use code.

Let's consider the same route tree from the [Route Trees & Nesting](../route-trees.md#route-trees) guide, and convert it to code-based routing:

Here is the file-based version:

```
routes/
├── __root.tsx
├── index.tsx
├── about.tsx
├── posts/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── $postId.tsx
├── posts.$postId.edit.tsx
├── settings/
│   ├── profile.tsx
│   ├── notifications.tsx
├── _pathlessLayout.tsx
├── _pathlessLayout/
│   ├── route-a.tsx
├── ├── route-b.tsx
├── files/
│   ├── $.tsx
```

And here is a summarized code-based version:

```tsx
import { createRootRoute, createRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const rootRoute = createRootRoute()

const indexRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: '/',
})

const aboutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: 'about',
})

const postsRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: 'posts',
})

const postsIndexRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  path: '/',
})

const postRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  path: '$postId',
})

const postEditorRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: 'posts/$postId/edit',
})

const settingsRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: 'settings',
})

const profileRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => settingsRoute,
  path: 'profile',
})

const notificationsRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => settingsRoute,
  path: 'notifications',
})

const pathlessLayoutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  id: 'pathlessLayout',
})

const pathlessLayoutARoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => pathlessLayoutRoute,
  path: 'route-a',
})

const pathlessLayoutBRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => pathlessLayoutRoute,
  path: 'route-b',
})

const filesRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: 'files/$',
})
```

## Anatomy of a Route

All other routes other than the root route are configured using the `createRoute` function:

```tsx
const route = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: '/posts',
  component: PostsComponent,
})
```

The `getParentRoute` option is a function that returns the parent route of the route you're creating.

**❓❓❓ "Wait, you're making me pass the parent route for every route I make?"**

Absolutely! The reason for passing the parent route has **everything to do with the magical type safety** of TanStack Router. Without the parent route, TypeScript would have no idea what types to supply your route with!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For every route that's **NOT** the **Root Route** or a **Pathless Layout Route**, a `path` option is required. This is the path that will be matched against the URL pathname to determine if the route is a match.

When configuring route `path` option on a route, it ignores leading and trailing slashes (this does not include "index" route paths `/`). You can include them if you want, but they will be normalized internally by TanStack Router. Here is a table of valid paths and what they will be normalized to:

| Path     | Normalized Path |
| -------- | --------------- |
| `/`      | `/`             |
| `/about` | `about`         |
| `about/` | `about`         |
| `about`  | `about`         |
| `$`      | `$`             |
| `/$`     | `$`             |
| `/$/`    | `$`             |

## Manually building the route tree

When building a route tree in code, it's not enough to define the parent route of each route. You must also construct the final route tree by adding each route to its parent route's `children` array. This is because the route tree is not built automatically for you like it is in file-based routing.

```tsx
/* prettier-ignore */
const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  indexRoute,
  aboutRoute,
  postsRoute.addChildren([
    postsIndexRoute,
    postRoute,
  ]),
  postEditorRoute,
  settingsRoute.addChildren([
    profileRoute,
    notificationsRoute,
  ]),
  pathlessLayoutRoute.addChildren([
    pathlessLayoutARoute,
    pathlessLayoutBRoute,
  ]),
  filesRoute.addChildren([
    fileRoute,
  ]),
])
/* prettier-ignore-end */
```

But before you can go ahead and build the route tree, you need to understand how the Routing Concepts for Code-Based Routing work.

## Routing Concepts for Code-Based Routing

Believe it or not, file-based routing is really a superset of code-based routing and uses the filesystem and a bit of code-generation abstraction on top of it to generate this structure you see above automatically.
