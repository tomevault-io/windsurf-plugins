# CLAUDE.md — which audience are you?

This repo has two kinds of AI reader, and they need different files.

**You are setting this tool up for a user** (they said "read AGENTS.md and set this up") →
read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Nothing on this page applies to you.

**You are changing this repo** (fixing a bug, adding a behaviour, cutting a release) → read
[`openspec/README.md`](openspec/README.md) first, then continue here.

## Working on this repo

### Spec before code

`openspec/specs/` states what this tool does. When a request changes that:

1. Write the delta spec first — `openspec/changes/<name>/` (copy `openspec/changes/TEMPLATE`).
2. Get the maintainer's line-by-line approval on it.
3. Then implement.

**When the requirement shifts mid-implementation, go back and change the delta spec before
touching code again.** A spec that gets updated after the fact is a changelog, and the whole
point is to have the argument before the code exists rather than after.

`openspec/specs/` itself is edited only by the archive step, never to describe work you are
about to do.

### How much ceremony — decide before you start

Not every change earns a full spec cycle. The test: **if the agent misread the requirement,
does one follow-up prompt fix it?**

- Yes → **Tier 0.** No spec. Commit with `[no-spec]`. Tests still have to be green.
- No, but the scope is unambiguous → **Tier 1.** Half a page of delta spec, written as
  acceptance criteria (Given-When-Then, observable Then, thresholds as literal numbers).
- Anything on the list below → **Tier 2.** Full cycle (proposal + delta + tasks), line-by-line
  maintainer approval, and one independent verifier pass after the implementation is done.

Tier 2 in this repo:

- **OCR routing** — what sends a PDF down the Surya path, the silent-`fitz`-failure detection,
  `--force-surya`. It only exists in the `--batch-dir` path, and getting it wrong costs a user
  a multi-GB install and hours of runtime.
- **Table gating** — every `T2N_TABLE_*` constant, `figures/figure_qc_gate.py`,
  `figures/pregate.py`, and the review-queue flagging. A gate that is too loose ships a
  misbound dose as clean citable data.
- **Release discipline** — anything that changes what a released tag contains, or the
  `CHANGELOG` + tag flow itself.

⚠️ Tier 0 means "cheap to notice and cheap to undo", **not "small diff"**. A two-line change
with fuzzy scope is exactly where an agent improvises — that one is Tier 1.

The full tiering rules live in the maintainer's local toolkit and are not part of this repo.
If you are an outside contributor, **default to Tier 1** and let the maintainer downgrade it.

### The commit guard

`.claude/hooks/spec-sync-guard.py` blocks a `git commit` that stages `converter/`,
`figures/`, `citations/`, `shared/`, `skills/`, `workflows/`, or `templates/` while staging
nothing under `openspec/` and no `CHANGELOG.md` entry. Test-only changes are exempt.

If a commit is genuinely internal, re-run it with `[no-spec]` in the message. Do not disable
the hook.

### Release discipline (this repo is public)

Every user-visible change ships as: `CHANGELOG.md` entry + commit + version tag. Never
overwrite a released tree wholesale.

Stage explicit paths. Never `git add -A` or `git add .`.

### Two rules that override convenience

- **Never tune a QC threshold to make a failing case pass.** Fix that book's geometry logic
  instead. This applies to `figures/figure_qc_gate.py`, `figures/pregate.py`, and every
  `T2N_TABLE_*` constant.
- **A new default-ON behaviour needs a corpus measurement** showing it corrects wrong
  output. Additive behaviours ship as opt-in flags, default OFF, byte-identical when unset.
