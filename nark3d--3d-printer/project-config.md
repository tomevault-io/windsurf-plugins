# Project instructions for Claude

This repo documents and manages a Klipper-driven 3D printer (ZeroG Mercury One, CoreXY, BTT Octopus Pro + EBB36 Gen2 toolhead, Beacon probe, Orbiter 2.5 extruder, hotbox chamber heater). Adam is the owner/operator.

## Read these FIRST when starting a new session

1. **`NEXT_STEPS.md`** — the current resume point. Status, pending items, and the "first concrete action" for the next session.
2. **Auto-memory files at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-adamlewis-Repos-3d-printer/memory/`** — specifically `MEMORY.md` which indexes entries. Load relevant memories for whatever task the user asks about.

## Safety-critical rules for interacting with the printer

**On 2026-04-12 I destroyed a 2-hour print and damaged hardware by sending Klipper RESTART without checking print state, then a G28 that drove the nozzle through the print into the bed.** Read `memory/never_send_printer_commands_without_permission.md`. These rules exist because I've already failed at them.

### The absolute rules

- **NEVER send motion, temperature, or restart commands without explicit per-command permission from Adam.** This includes G0, G1, G28, G29, G30, Z_TILT_ADJUST, BED_MESH_CALIBRATE, SMART_PARK, LINE_PURGE, PROBE_ACCURACY, RESTART, FIRMWARE_RESTART, M104, M109, M140, M190, SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE, and anything that moves or heats.
- **ALWAYS check `print_stats.state` before any command that could affect a running print.** Query `GET /printer/objects/query?print_stats`. If state is `printing` or `paused`, STOP.
- **Read-only queries are safe autonomously** — GET requests to Moonraker, SSH reads of log/config files, SCP pulls of result PNGs, analysis of local files. Adam explicitly authorised this workflow on 2026-04-12.
- **The safety wrapper and Claude Code hook are hard blocks**, not suggestions. `~/printer_cmd.sh` filters commands, and `.claude/hooks/block-printer-writes.sh` intercepts raw curl POSTs. Even with permission, respect these — they're the mechanical enforcement of the policy.

### The correct workflow for any command that changes printer state

1. Show Adam the exact command and why
2. Wait for explicit approval (`yes`, `go`, `do it`, or similar)
3. Before executing: check `print_stats.state` is `standby` (or acceptable)
4. Execute via `~/printer_cmd.sh` if the command is permitted by the wrapper's blocklist
5. If the wrapper blocks it (motion, temperature, restart): Adam runs it himself from Mainsail console

### If in doubt, ask

Pausing to confirm is free. An unwanted printer command is potentially hundreds of pounds of hardware damage. The cost asymmetry is extreme. Err on the side of asking.

## Working with Adam — communication and collaboration

- **Adam is technically sophisticated.** Don't over-explain basics. He builds printers from scratch and calibrates Klipper fluently.
- **Be terse.** Skip preambles and summaries unless he asks. Answer the question asked.
- **Don't over-claim.** Multiple memory files document my past pattern of presenting hypotheses as facts (`memory/dont_push_unneeded_tuning.md`, `memory/beacon_vs_lis2dw_uncertainty.md`). Frame non-obvious technical claims as: *hypothesis X, evidence Y, confidence Z, alternatives A/B/C*.
- **Don't push tuning steps when there's no concrete problem.** Ask "what problem are we solving?" first. NEXT_STEPS.md is a menu of options, not a checklist.
- **Listen to "no".** When he corrects an approach, update memory so the correction persists. Don't re-propose the same rejected idea in later sessions.
