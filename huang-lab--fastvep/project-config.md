# Working in this repository

fastVEP predicts the functional consequence of genomic variants. The output is
a prediction a clinician or researcher may act on, which sets the bar for
everything below: **the failure mode that matters here is not a crash, it is a
plausible-looking wrong answer.** Most of the fixes in `git log` are exactly
that — a variant annotated against the wrong transcript, a gene that lost its
symbol, a cache trusted after the parser that wrote it was fixed. None of them
would have shown up as an error message.

## Layout

Twelve crates, layered so that nothing below depends on anything above it:

```
fastvep-core            Consequence (49 SO terms), Allele, VariantType, Impact
  fastvep-genome        Transcript, Exon, Gene, CodonTable
    fastvep-cache       GFF3 parser, FASTA reader, transcript cache, providers
    fastvep-consequence consequence prediction (small variants + SVs)
    fastvep-hgvs        HGVS g. / c. / p. nomenclature
    fastvep-io          VCF parsing, CSQ / tab / JSON output
  fastvep-filter        filter_vep-compatible expression engine
  fastvep-classification ACMG-AMP criteria (Richards 2015 + ClinGen SVI)
      fastvep-sa        supplementary annotations (.osa/.osa2/.osi/.oga)
        fastvep-annotate  the shared annotation pipeline
          fastvep-cli     the `fastvep` binary
          fastvep-web     the axum production server
```

`fastvep-annotate` and `fastvep-cli` both drive annotation and their per-variant
loops have drifted apart before. A change to one is usually a change to both —
check the other before you call the work done.

## The loop

```bash
cargo fmt --all                                        # before every commit
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings  # what CI gates on
cargo test --workspace                                 # ~1000 tests, all must pass
```

CI runs exactly these three and nothing else, in this order. The lint set lives
in `[workspace.lints]` in the root `Cargo.toml`, so a local `cargo clippy`
already sees what CI sees — the only difference is the `-D`.

Keep that set narrow. Every lint in it is one the workspace currently
satisfies, which is what makes a warning worth reading. Adding a lint that
fires on hundreds of existing lines does not raise the bar; it trains everyone
to scroll past the output.

## Conventions the history already follows

**Commits.** Conventional commits with a scope, and a subject that names the
consequence rather than the edit:

```
fix(gff): read ncRNA_gene records, so non-coding genes keep their symbol (#98)
fix(cache): reject the pre-#90 cache format instead of trusting it (#95)
```

`cliff.toml` drafts release notes from these, but `CHANGELOG.md` is
hand-curated: git-cliff writes the unreleased block, a human writes the prose.
Released sections are never regenerated. Bug-fix commits do not touch
`CHANGELOG.md`; it is updated when a release is cut.

**Silencing a lint.** `#[allow(...)]` carries a one-line reason at the site.
An `#[allow]` with no explanation is a TODO nobody wrote down.

**Comments explain why, not what.** The code says what it does. Comments in
this repo exist to record the reasoning that is not recoverable from reading
it — which provider's file format forced a branch, which issue proved an
assumption wrong, why the obvious simplification is unsafe. When you fix a bug,
leave behind the fact that made it a bug.

**Formatting-only commits** go in alone and get their hash added to
`.git-blame-ignore-revs`. Never mix a reformat with a behaviour change; it
makes the behaviour change invisible in review.

## Two hazards worth knowing before you start

**A parser fix does not reach users on its own.** `fastvep annotate` writes a
sidecar transcript cache next to the GFF3 and reuses it whenever its mtime is
newer than the source. A user who fixes their fastVEP but not their GFF3 keeps
reading the cache the *old* parser wrote, and sees no change at all. So a fix
to `crates/fastvep-cache/src/gff.rs` that changes what gets parsed needs the
cache magic in `transcript_cache.rs` bumped alongside it, with the old magic
moved to the rejected list and a `SUMMARY_PRE_NN` / `DETAIL_PRE_NN` pair saying
what was wrong with what it holds. `#95` and `#98` are the worked examples.

The pair is two lengths of the same fact, because the two callers are not in
the same situation. The sidecar path rebuilds from the GFF3 by itself, so it
prints the summary and stops; the explicit `--transcript-cache` path has to
refuse the run, so it owes the user the detail. Recovery advice belongs at the
call site, not in the error: the sidecar has already rebuilt by the time it
reports, and deleting a cache named on the command line produces no sidecar to
replace it.

Rejecting is deliberate, and the reason generalises: a stale cache is
*intact*, so nothing in it distinguishes a gene that lost its symbol from one
that never had a symbol. There is no safe way to read it, only a safe way to
refuse it.

**Region-restricted transcript sets must never be cached.** Reading a GFF3
through the tabix path returns only the features overlapping *this* VCF's
variants. That set is correct for this run and wrong for every other one, so
