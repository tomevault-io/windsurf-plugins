Figwright is an open-source, **bidirectional** Figma agent for MCP clients (Claude Code and others). It connects an MCP server to a Figma plugin over a local WebSocket relay, letting an AI agent both **read** designs with high-fidelity grounding and **write** back to the canvas — no Figma paid tier required.

This file is the canonical guide for AI agents and contributors working in this repo. (`CLAUDE.md` points here.)

## Architecture

Two halves talk over a local WebSocket relay:

- **MCP server** (`packages/mcp`, published as `@figwright/mcp`) — the Node process an MCP client launches. It exposes 80+ read/write tools, plus higher-level **grounding** tools that join Figma data with the user's codebase (component / token / icon maps) and a codegen prompt. It owns the relay, leader/follower **election** (multiple MCP servers can share one plugin), and request **idempotency**.
- **Figma plugin** (`packages/plugin`) — a Vue 3 + Vite UI plus a sandbox that runs inside Figma and performs the actual Figma API calls. It connects out to the server's WebSocket.
- **Shared** (`packages/shared`) — types, Zod schemas, the msgpack wire codec, and the plugin↔server protocol. It is **bundled into the server at build time** (not published on its own).

Design stance: **provider-first**. Rather than a fixed compiler pipeline, the tools surface faithful, de-duplicated design context and let the LLM generate code that matches the user's actual stack (detected framework / styling system). The `figma-codegen` skill and the MCP `figma_to_code` prompt encode this approach.

## Layout

```
packages/
  shared/   # types, Zod schemas, msgpack codec, plugin↔server protocol (bundled into mcp)
  mcp/      # the MCP server — @figwright/mcp (Node, ESM): relay, election, tools, joins
  plugin/   # Figma plugin — Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind v4 (UI) + sandbox (Figma API)
skills/     # agent skills that orchestrate the tools (figma-codegen) — installable via `npx skills add`
test/       # cross-package integration tests (e.g. server tool registry ↔ plugin handlers)
```

`packages/mcp/src` is organized by concern: `tools/`, `relay/`, `election/`, `join/` (component/token/icon maps), `tokens/`, `profile/` (stack detection), `scan/`, `icons/`, `prompts/`.

## Tech stack

- **Node 24** (see `.node-version`), **pnpm 11** workspace (pinned via `packageManager`), ESM throughout.
- **TypeScript** (strict). Build: **tsdown** (the server bundles `shared`); the plugin builds with **Vite** (single-file UI).
- **Vitest** (tests), **oxlint** (lint), **oxfmt** (format), **knip** (unused deps/exports/files).
- **Zod** for server tool I/O + shared schemas; **msgpack** on the wire.

## Commands

Run from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install     # install workspace deps
pnpm typecheck   # tsc across packages
pnpm lint        # oxlint
pnpm format      # oxfmt (write); `pnpm format:check` is the CI variant
pnpm knip        # unused deps / exports / files
pnpm build       # build all packages (tsdown + vite)
pnpm test        # vitest run — the canonical test command
```

`pnpm test` from the root is **canonical** — it picks up both `packages/*/test/**` and the root `test/**`. Don't run tests per-package; you'll miss the cross-package suite.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) gates every push and PR on: **typecheck, lint, format:check, knip, build, test**. All must pass.

## Engineering standard

Figwright's moat is **grounding fidelity and generality** — how accurately and how broadly real designs turn into correct code (reliability is the floor, not the differentiator). Hold that bar by default; it is the point of the project, not a mode to switch on when asked.

- **Equal-or-better, never a regression.** Any change to existing behaviour must leave every real design's output the same or better. Before claiming a change is good, find the case where it could be _worse_ — adversarially stress-test your own proposal against diverse real designs (mixed-style text, wrapping layouts, absolute / constraint positioning, deep component trees), and drop or fix anything that can't clear the bar. Verify, then assert.
- **Fix root causes, not symptoms.** Read the implementation, the schemas, and the serializer; hunt the systemic class of bug — the recurring one here is _a multi-dimensional Figma property collapsed to a single field, or dropped on the way out_. Don't infer from the rendered screenshot.
- **Don't gold-plate.** Spend effort where it moves fidelity / generality; resist over-engineering for a "killer feature" narrative. The smallest change that faithfully closes the gap wins.
- **Prove it on real designs.** Pair unit tests with a live round-trip against an actual Figma file (plugin connected) — especially for read-path / serializer changes, where the running server uses the built `dist` (see Gotchas).
