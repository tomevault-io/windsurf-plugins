# Promptwright — QA Assistant powered by GitHub Copilot SDK
# TypeScript, pnpm monorepo, Electron + React, Playwright MCP, CDP

## Key Rules
- ESM only: always use `.js` extension in imports
- Module resolution: NodeNext, no path aliases
- Node.js 22+ required
- Never log full MCP configs or Copilot SDK payloads (contain secrets)
- Desktop app must run in Electron, not browser
- Renderer accesses backend only through `window.jarvis`
- After UI changes: `pnpm build && pnpm test:e2e:smoke`
