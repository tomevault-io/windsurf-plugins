The EveryPolitician (EP) website presents a global atlas of political offices associated with a wide range of territories (countries, subnational jurisdictions, and break-away states). For each position, office-holders are listed to indicate the periods in which they held tenure of a position.

- The website is meant to be a community-driven resource. For any copy, use the tone of projects like Wikipedia, WhatDoTheyKnow, Code For America.

### Technology

- Using Next.js, TypeScript, and running on Google Cloud Run.
  - Assume a development server is already running
  - Components are used for any re-usable elements and located in `components/`
  - Data interfaces and access functions are in `lib/`
- Searches and other API requests can be sent against the OpenSanctions API at api.opensanctions.org.
  - This contains Person, Position and Occupancy entities relevant to EP
  - see: https://api.opensanctions.org/openapi.json
- Main entity schemata:
  - https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/schemata/Person/
  - https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/schemata/Position/
  - https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/schemata/Occupancy/

### Styling

- Use react-bootstrap components where possible (e.g., `<Container>`, `<Row>`, `<Button>`)
- **Import all react-bootstrap components explicitly**, including subcomponents (e.g., `CardBody`, `CardTitle`)
- For elements without react-bootstrap components, use Bootstrap utility classes
- Minimize custom CSS—prefer Bootstrap utilities over custom styles
- Only add custom styles when Bootstrap doesn't provide what's needed

### Testing

**Strategy: Behavior-focused, minimal tests**

- Test what users experience, not implementation details
- Avoid mocking internal modules—mock only at system boundaries (external APIs, network)
- Tests should pass when refactoring internals, fail only when behavior changes
- Write only tests that provide real value: critical user journeys, edge cases, regression prevention
- Stack: Vitest + React Testing Library + jsdom
- Run tests: `npm test` (watch) or `npm run test:run` (single run)
