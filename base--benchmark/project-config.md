# React Component Development Guidelines

## Component Structure

### Functional Programming Approach
- Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
- Extract complex logic into helper functions outside the component
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use pure functions for data transformations

### Helper Functions
- Extract repetitive logic into reusable helper functions
- Place helper functions above the main component
- Use descriptive names that explain the function's purpose
- Add JSDoc comments for complex helper functions

### Render Functions
- Extract complex JSX into separate render functions
- Name render functions with the `render` prefix
- Keep render functions focused on a single UI element
- Pass only necessary props to render functions

### State Management
- Use `useState` for local component state
- Prefer `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Use `useCallback` for functions passed as props to child components
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible

## Code Organization

### Imports
- Group imports by type: React, third-party libraries, local utilities, types
- Use absolute imports for local files when possible
- Remove unused imports

### TypeScript
- Define interfaces for component props
- Use union types for finite sets of values
- Prefer `const assertions` for configuration objects
- Use proper typing for event handlers

### Comments
- Only comment code that explains business logic or complex algorithms
- Avoid comments that describe obvious operations
- Use comments to explain "why" not "what"
- Remove comments about styling or implementation details

## Styling Guidelines

### Tailwind CSS
- Use semantic color classes (emerald for success, red for errors, etc.)
- Prefer utility classes over custom CSS
- Use consistent spacing and sizing scales
- Group related classes logically

### Accessibility
- Include proper focus states for interactive elements
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alternative text for images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast

### Responsive Design
- Use responsive utility classes
- Test components at different screen sizes
- Consider mobile-first design approach

## Performance

### Optimization
- Use `React.memo` for expensive components
- Implement proper key props for list items
- Avoid inline object/function creation in render
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations

### Code Splitting
- Consider lazy loading for large components
- Split components into smaller, focused pieces
- Use dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
