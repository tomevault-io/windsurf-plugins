description: TokenBBQ is a TypeScript ESM dashboard distributed through `npx tokenbbq`. Core source lives in `src/`: `index.ts` is the dashboard launcher, `loaders/` normalizes usage data from supported tools, `aggregator.ts` prepares dashboard summaries, `pricing.ts` handles model pricing, and `server.ts`/`dashboard.ts` serve the web UI. Tests sit next to source as `*.test.ts`; loader fixtures live in `src/loaders/__fixtures__/`. Build helpers are in `scripts/`. Generated output belongs in `dist/`.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

TokenBBQ is a TypeScript ESM dashboard distributed through `npx tokenbbq`. Core source lives in `src/`: `index.ts` is the dashboard launcher, `loaders/` normalizes usage data from supported tools, `aggregator.ts` prepares dashboard summaries, `pricing.ts` handles model pricing, and `server.ts`/`dashboard.ts` serve the web UI. Tests sit next to source as `*.test.ts`; loader fixtures live in `src/loaders/__fixtures__/`. Build helpers are in `scripts/`. Generated output belongs in `dist/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm install`: install root dependencies.
- `npm run dev`: inline required assets, then run the dashboard locally through `tsx`.
- `npm run lint`: run TypeScript type checking with `tsc --noEmit`.
- `npm run test`: run Node's test runner against `src/**/*.test.ts`.
- `npm run build`: produce the publishable dashboard bundle in `dist/`.
- `npm start`: run the built dashboard entry from `dist/index.js`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use strict TypeScript, ESM `import`/`export`, and Node 20+ APIs. Keep module names lowercase and descriptive, for example `event-merge.ts` or `platform-paths.ts`. Tests should mirror the target module name, such as `pricing.test.ts`. Prefer small functions with explicit types at module boundaries. The codebase currently uses two-space indentation in TypeScript files; avoid unrelated formatting churn.

## Testing Guidelines

Tests use `node:test` and `node:assert/strict`, executed via `scripts/run-tests.mjs` so glob expansion works across supported Node versions. Add focused tests beside changed code when modifying aggregation, pricing, persistence, server behavior, or loader behavior. For new loaders, include representative fixture data under `src/loaders/__fixtures__/` when practical and verify missing data directories return empty results rather than throwing.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history follows Conventional Commit-style subjects, for example `fix(audit): ...`, `docs: ...`, and `chore(release): ...`. Keep subjects imperative and scoped when useful. Pull requests should fill out `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: explain what changed, why it is needed, confirm `npm run build`, note loader registration changes, and update `README.md` for user-facing behavior. Include screenshots or recordings for dashboard UI changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit local usage databases, credentials, or generated `dist/` artifacts unless release packaging requires them. Preserve cross-platform path handling; CI runs Linux, macOS, and Windows.
