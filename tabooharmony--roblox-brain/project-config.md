# AGENTS.md — Guide for AI Agents and Contributors

## What This Repo Is

`roblox-brain` is a skills-only repository for AI coding agents working with Roblox Studio. 28 curated skills covering Luau language, Roblox engine APIs, architecture, growth design, security, monetization, localization, and workflow. Distributed via `npx skills add TabooHarmony/roblox-brain`.

No plugin code. No build system. No npm package. Just SKILL.md files.

## Architecture: Progressive Disclosure

Each skill follows progressive disclosure. Compatible hosts discover skill names and descriptions, then load the selected entry point and references as needed.

1. **Skill metadata** — the host discovers names and descriptions from each `SKILL.md`
2. **SKILL.md** (~600 tokens, max 3,000 chars) — quick reference, enough for most tasks
3. **references/full.md** (max 35,000 chars) — detailed guidance and examples for full skills

Thin routing skills declare `kind: router` and may omit `references/full.md` when
their entire job is selecting the right domain skills.

The README is the human-facing catalogue. Skill hosts discover the individual `SKILL.md` files directly.

```
skills/roblox-gui/
├── SKILL.md              ← Quick Reference (under 3,000 chars)
└── references/
    └── full.md           ← Full Reference (under 35,000 chars)
```

## Skill File Structure

Every SKILL.md must have:

```yaml
---
name: roblox-<name>
description: >
  One-line description, under 150 chars.
last_reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
sources:
  - https://create.roblox.com/docs/...    # or [original] for synthesis
---

# Skill Title

## When to Load

1-3 sentences on when an agent should load this skill. Include cross-refs to related skills in backticks.

## Quick Reference

Dense table or list format. The most useful info inline. Code examples in ```luau blocks.

> Full code examples and API tables: [references/full.md](references/full.md)
```

**Required sections**: `## When to Load`, `## Quick Reference`
**Banned sections**: `## Overview`, `## 1. Overview`, `## Full Reference` (use references/full.md)

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/roblox-<name>/SKILL.md` following the structure above
2. Create `skills/roblox-<name>/references/full.md` with complete reference (under 35,000 chars)
3. Add a row to `README.md` in the appropriate skills table and update the skill count badge
4. Run `python3 validate_skills.py` — must pass
5. If the skill makes API claims, add focused entries to `api_drift_registry.yaml`

## Validation

Run `python3 validate_skills.py` before committing. Checks:
- SKILL.md under 3,000 chars
- references/full.md under 35,000 chars
- Description under 150 chars
- Required frontmatter: name, description, last_reviewed, sources
- sources field is not empty (use `[original]` for synthesis)
- `## When to Load` section present
- `## Quick Reference` section present
- No `## Overview` or `## 1. Overview` in SKILL.md
- No `## Full Reference` in SKILL.md
- No ```lua code blocks (use ```luau)
- references/full.md exists unless `kind: router`
- Cross-references (`` `roblox-X` `` in backticks) point to existing skills

Additional CI checks:
- `python3 verify_api_drift.py` — API claims against live Roblox creator-docs
- `python3 verify_source_urls.py` — source URLs are reachable
- `python3 verify_version_pins.py` — tool version pins (non-blocking)

CI runs on all branches (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Sourcing Rules

- All skill content must trace to a real source: official Roblox creator-docs, repositories with a compatible license or explicit reuse permission, or original work
- Training-data-only content is unacceptable. Verify API references against current docs
- Track sources in the `sources:` frontmatter field
- Use `sources: [original]` for synthesis/opinion/design heuristics
- When lifting from external repos, preserve attribution and record the license or reuse terms in the relevant vendor note
- Use `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs (not `github.com/blob/`) for source links
- Mark temporal claims with event dates: `<!-- temporal: 2026-06 -->`

## Conventions

- Luau code blocks use ```luau (not ```lua)
- API names in backticks: `UserInputService`, `RemoteEvent`
- Cross-skill references in backticks: `` `roblox-networking` ``, `` `roblox-data` ``
- Last reviewed date: update when you verify content against current docs
- Keep SKILL.md lean — if it hits 2,500+ chars, move detail to references/full.md
- Mark illustrative reference code as illustrative and require project-specific verification
- No orphaned reference files — all content goes in `references/full.md`

## Key Files
