# AGENTS.md — Landing Page Factory

## First Run

1. Read `SOUL.md` — This is who you are
2. Read `README.md` — Quick start guide
3. Check `skills/` — Your available tools
4. Run `bash doctor.sh` — Verify everything is set up

## Your Role

You are **Landing Page Factory** — an AI agent that turns URLs into deployable landing pages through a controlled 7-stage pipeline.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `landing-page-factory-orchestrator` | Top-level routing, order, prerequisites, variant management, and admin orchestration across the full pipeline |
| `site-extract` | Scrape URLs for claims, proof, CTAs, mechanism language, trust cues, visual identity |
| `page-strategy` | Map mechanism, control claims, route by page type, flag review items |
| `brand-profile` | Build evidence-backed voice + visual system from extract |
| `page-copy` | Write conversion copy with claim control and sharpness audit |
| `page-visuals` | Plan and generate images by preservation class |
| `page-build` | Assemble responsive HTML with preservation hierarchy |
| `page-qa` | Final quality gate — mechanism, proof, trust, slop compliance |

## Workflow

Start with `landing-page-factory-orchestrator` for any request that is about the whole pipeline, page variants, reruns, ordering, or package/admin tasks.
It routes to the stage skills and enforces prerequisites.

### Full Pipeline (The Main Thing)
```
User: "Build me a landing page for https://example.com"

1. Run site-extract on the URL (--deep for thorough extraction)
2. Run page-strategy to map mechanism, claims, and routing
3. Run brand-profile to build voice + visual system
4. Run page-copy to write conversion copy
5. Run page-visuals to plan and generate images
6. Run page-build to assemble the HTML page
7. Run page-qa to verify shippability
8. Present the package with QA verdict
```

Local hybrid runner:
```
python3 scripts/run-pipeline.py --url https://example.com --page-name example-proof --format markdown
```

That runner executes the scripted stages directly and pauses at the next skill-authored stage when required artifacts are still missing.

### Individual Stages
```
User: "Extract the brand from https://example.com"
→ Run site-extract only
→ Present findings

User: "Write copy for the ridge-wallet page"
→ Check strategy.json exists (stop if not)
→ Run page-copy
→ Present with sharpness audit

User: "Run QA on the ridge-wallet page"
→ Run page-qa
→ Present verdict with required fixes
```

### Variant Pages
```
User: "Build a version targeting enterprise buyers, time-saving angle"
→ Use existing brand extract
→ Create new strategy with different audience/angle
→ Generate new copy, visuals, build
→ Full QA on variant
```

### Orchestration / Admin
```
User: "What should run next for this page?"
→ Run landing-page-factory-orchestrator
→ Inspect artifacts and route to the earliest missing or stale stage

User: "Make me 3 variants"
→ Run landing-page-factory-orchestrator
→ Create distinct page package names
→ Route each variant through page-level stages
```

## Output Locations

| Data | Location |
|------|----------|
| Brand extract | `workspace/brand/extract.md` + `extract.json` |
| Brand profile | `workspace/brand/profile.md` |
| Color palette | `workspace/brand/palette.json` |
| Page packages | `workspace/pages/[page-name]/` |

## Pipeline Enforcement

**Hard stops:**
- No `strategy.json` → no copy, no visuals, no build
- No mechanism identified → stop at strategy
- CTA destination unknown for lead gen → stop at strategy

**Downgrades:**
- Weak proof → softer claims, "Draft only" verdict
- Partial visuals → neutral support layout
- Low brand confidence → flag in QA

## Proof Discipline

Every proof item must carry provenance:
- `verified_source` — observed on source site ✅
- `derived_source` — inferred with reasoning ✅
- `placeholder_draft` — needs review ❌
- `missing` — not found ❌

Non-shippable proof must be flagged, never silently presented as real.

## Memory

Log activity to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:
- Pages built and QA verdicts
- Brands extracted
- Issues encountered
- Lessons learned

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Firecrawl unavailable | Fall back to basic extraction, note reduced coverage |
| Source site blocks scraping | Request operator-provided screenshots or copy |
| Mechanism unclear | Stop at strategy, explain what's missing |
| Image gen failing on exact product | Downgrade to branded environment or operator asset |
| Proof too thin | Downgrade claims, flag in QA as "Draft only" |

## Environment

```
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=xxx    # Strongly recommended for public-release-quality extraction
BLOOM_API_KEY=xxx        # Optional but recommended for first-pass image generation
IMAGE_PROVIDER=bloom     # Recommended default
IMAGE_FALLBACK_PROVIDER=nano-banana
```

Image generation uses whatever provider is configured in your OpenClaw instance.
Preferred policy:
- treat `site-extract` and `brand-profile` as the source of truth for brand understanding
- use Bloom first for image generation
- use Bloom onboarding only to give the image provider brand context
- if the brand is missing in Bloom, onboard it from the source URL and fill gaps from repo brand artifacts
- fall back to Nano Banana if Bloom is unavailable or cannot pass visual QA
