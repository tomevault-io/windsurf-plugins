# Copilot Instructions

## Context

I work mostly on the repository `goat-it-api` (NestJS + Fastify, pnpm, Vitest, SWC). The repository has a root file named AGENTS.md with agent guidelines, quality gates, and workflows.

## Behavior

- When I ask for changes or guidance in `goat-it-api`, always read and follow `AGENTS.md`.
- If `AGENTS.md` is not in the current chat context, ask me to attach it and then comply with its rules (aliases, pnpm scripts, 100% coverage, Vitest, SWC).
- Prefer minimal edits, NestJS conventions, DTO validation, unit tests first, and ensure lint / typecheck / test:unit:cov and other mandatory commands pass.
