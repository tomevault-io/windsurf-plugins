# Agents Guide for Spotlight

This is the entrypoint for agents working on Spotlight. Read it before touching code, then read the relevant skill files under `.agent/skills/`. The implementation and skills are the source of truth for details; this file keeps only the project contract, behavior rules, and routing.

## Behavioral Guidelines

### 1. Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

### 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Reproduce it, then make the fix, then verify it stays fixed"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

## Project Contract

Spotlight is a compact launcher for GNOME Shell. Press a shortcut, a translucent glass popup appears positioned 25 percent from the top of the monitor, type something and results show up in real time. It permanently steals the Overview search widgets — the Overview itself stays functional, only its search UI gets replaced.

Supported versions: GNOME Shell 45 through 51. Wayland only.

Version format: `YYYY.PATCH` where patch resets to `01` each calendar year. Examples: `2026.01`, `2026.99`, `2026.100`, then `2027.01`.

The durable architecture, popup behavior, overview search stealing, and animation approach live in the relevant skills listed below.

## Skill Routing

Read these first for every non-trivial change:

- [`extension-best-practices`](.agent/skills/extension-best-practices/SKILL.md) for popup positioning, animations, keybinding, multi-monitor behavior, and core design decisions.
- [`guidance-maintenance`](.agent/skills/guidance-maintenance/SKILL.md) for what belongs in agent guidance and what must stay out of it.
- [`verification-discipline`](.agent/skills/verification-discipline/SKILL.md) for evidence, scope, testing, and reporting claims.
- [`writing-tone`](.agent/skills/writing-tone/SKILL.md) for how to write docs, comments, commit messages, and explanations.
- [`code-review-checklist`](.agent/skills/code-review-checklist/SKILL.md) for the mandatory review criteria.

Then read the focused skill for the code being changed:

- Extension structure and entry points: [`extension-getting-started`](.agent/skills/extension-getting-started/SKILL.md)
- ESM imports: [`extension-esm-imports`](.agent/skills/extension-esm-imports/SKILL.md)
- Enable/disable lifecycle: [`extension-lifecycle`](.agent/skills/extension-lifecycle/SKILL.md)
- Signal cleanup: [`extension-signal-cleanup`](.agent/skills/extension-signal-cleanup/SKILL.md)
- GSettings: [`extension-gsettings`](.agent/skills/extension-gsettings/SKILL.md)
- Preferences: [`extension-prefs`](.agent/skills/extension-prefs/SKILL.md)
- Styling and CSS: [`extension-styling`](.agent/skills/extension-styling/SKILL.md)
- Debugging: [`extension-debugging`](.agent/skills/extension-debugging/SKILL.md)
- EGO review: [`extension-review-guidelines`](.agent/skills/extension-review-guidelines/SKILL.md)
- Metadata: [`extension-metadata`](.agent/skills/extension-metadata/SKILL.md)
- General guidelines: [`extension-guideline`](.agent/skills/extension-guideline/SKILL.md)
- Writing standards: [`extension-writing-standards`](.agent/skills/extension-writing-standards/SKILL.md)
- Overview search stealing: [`extension-overview-search-stealing`](.agent/skills/extension-overview-search-stealing/SKILL.md)
- Popup close defense: [`extension-popup-close-defense`](.agent/skills/extension-popup-close-defense/SKILL.md)
- Defensive programming: [`defensive-programming`](.agent/skills/defensive-programming/SKILL.md)
- Security anti-patterns: [`security-anti-patterns`](.agent/skills/security-anti-patterns/SKILL.md)
