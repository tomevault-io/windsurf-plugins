# AI Challenge 2026 - Repository Rules

## Scope

These rules apply to the entire repository and all future work in:

- `task-1/`
- `task-2/`
- `task-3/`
- `task-4/`

## Repository Architecture

1. Keep each challenge task isolated inside its own folder (`task-X`).
2. Do not initialize an app at repository root.
3. Do not create root-level `package.json` or lockfiles.
4. If a task needs a project scaffold, initialize it only inside that task directory.

## Default Technical Stack

Unless a task explicitly overrides the stack, use:

- Node.js 24
- React latest stable
- React Bootstrap for UI components
- Font Awesome for icons

## Execution and Planning Discipline

1. Read the task announcement and transform requirements into a checklist.
2. Ask clarifying questions immediately when requirements are ambiguous.
3. Avoid assumptions that can affect scoring; if assumptions are required, write them explicitly.
4. Work in small verifiable increments and validate after each major step.

## Submission Safety Rules

1. Optimize for correctness over speed.
2. Perform requirement-by-requirement validation before finalizing.
3. Verify all links, artifacts, and expected outputs before submission.
4. Ensure there are no placeholder TODOs or incomplete sections in deliverables.

## Documentation Rules

Each task directory should maintain a `README.md` with:

- objective and scope
- implementation notes
- setup/run instructions
- verification checklist
- final submission artifacts/links

## AI-Agent Collaboration Rules

1. Start by restating task requirements and acceptance criteria.
2. If unsure, ask questions before implementing.
3. Explicitly list assumptions and risks.
4. Provide a concise verification report before marking work complete.
5. Avoid destructive actions unless explicitly requested.

## Security and Hygiene

1. Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials.
2. Keep naming predictable and task-specific.
3. Prefer reproducible commands and explicit setup instructions.
4. Keep changes minimal and aligned with the active task.
