# Wayfinder Project Guide

## Product

Wayfinder is a standalone macOS and Windows application that turns work with
AI into a visual history of how a project reached its result. It is designed
for AI-assisted conversations, research, writing, design, coding, and other
project work. Codex, Claude Code, and TRAE CN are the current early-access
collectors, not the boundary of the product. TRAE CN collection is currently
validated on macOS. The complete history stays under `~/.wayfinder`.

## Stack And Commands

- TypeScript/Node.js core and D3/SVG map renderer.
- Tauri/Rust desktop shell with a bundled Node SEA sidecar.
- Install: `npm ci`
- Full checks: `npm run check`
- Prepare desktop assets: `npm run companion:prepare`
- Rust tests: `cargo test --manifest-path companion/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- Version gate: `node scripts/verify-companion-version.cjs --prefix alpha-v`

## Structure

- `src/sessionCollector.ts`: local Codex, Claude, and TRAE collection and edit
  replay.
- `src/forestMapPanel.ts`: voyage-map rendering and interaction.
- `companion/`: desktop shell and generated web surface.
- `website/`: static download site; public downloads come from
  `website/releases.json`.
- `docs/`: product, install, privacy, release, and publication contracts.

## Rules

- The desktop app is the only supported product surface.
- The desktop collector does not invoke Git or create workspace snapshots;
  legacy Hook and extension snapshot code is unsupported.
- Do not advertise VSIX, plugins, Skills, CLI packages, Homebrew, Scoop, or MCP
  packages as current installation paths.
- Do not fabricate historical diffs or send raw conversations/source files to
  a cloud service.
- Waypoint titles must name a concrete task, object, or result in short,
  readable language. Reject generic labels such as "optimize current task",
  "continue current task", or "implement current task".
- Keep the website's 1440x900 desktop rendering pixel-stable. At 540px and
  below, use the dedicated phone compositions documented in
  `docs/MOBILE-REDESIGN.md`; do not shrink or crop the desktop scene.
- Keep `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `src/version.ts`, Cargo metadata,
  and Tauri config versions synchronized.
- Do not update `website/releases.json` until both macOS DMGs and the Windows
  x64 installer exist publicly.
- Do not edit generated `out/`, `companion/dist/`, binaries, or `target/`.

## Current State

- Public/live release: `0.3.16` early access.
- Public artifacts: Apple Silicon and Intel macOS DMGs plus a Windows x64 NSIS
  installer, with SHA-256 checksums.
- Local source version: `0.3.16`.
