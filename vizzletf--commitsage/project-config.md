# CommitSage — Instructions for Claude

## Responding to issues & PRs

When replying to users on GitHub issues or pull requests, follow the
maintainer's voice and templates in [docs/issue-response-guide.md](docs/issue-response-guide.md).

Key rules:
- Greet by handle (`Hello, @username!`), thank the user, be concise and honest.
- State root cause in one line, the fix, and the version it shipped in.
- Confirm the released version before promising a fix; otherwise say it'll be
  in the next release.
- Ask the user to update and give feedback. Reply in English.

## Docs

Project docs live in `docs/` — see `providers.md`, `configuration.md`,
`troubleshooting.md`, `testing.md`, and others for domain details.
