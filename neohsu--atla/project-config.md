# atla — agent guide

Rust workspace for `atla`, a unified Jira + Confluence Cloud CLI. Primary consumers are
**coding agents**: machine-readable output, stable JSON schemas, and accurate docs are
product features here, not niceties.

## Workspace map

| Crate | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/atla-cli` (package name **`atla`**) | clap definitions (`cli/`), command handlers (`commands/`), output rendering, pagination tokens |
| `crates/atla-core` | domain clients + hand-written models (`jira/`, `confluence/`), auth/profiles, markdown⇄ADF (`markdown/`) |
| `crates/atla-jira-api`, `atla-confluence-api`, `atla-confluence-v1-api` | progenitor codegen from `specs/*.json` at build time (`build.rs`); generated code is NOT committed |

## Build / test

```bash
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo test --doc --workspace --locked
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked \
  --exclude atla-jira-api --exclude atla-confluence-api --exclude atla-confluence-v1-api -- -D warnings
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) enforces equivalent workspace tests with `cargo-nextest` plus a
separate doctest run, along with Rust/Python formatting and lint checks, Clippy, secret scanning,
and a RustSec dependency audit, workflow syntax/pin checks, and zizmor security analysis. The CLI
package is `atla`, not `atla-cli`: `cargo test --locked -p atla`. For local orchestration, use
`mise run check:fast` during
the inner loop and `mise run check:pr` before pushing; `mise tasks` lists focused test, contract,
security, and coverage tasks. The explicit Cargo commands above
remain the portable baseline.

## Changing the CLI surface (checklist)

Any change to commands/flags under `crates/atla-cli/src/cli/` MUST be propagated, in this
order. `crates/atla-cli/src/doc_check.rs` enforces steps 2–3 in `cargo test`:

1. Implement the change (`cli/` + `commands/`).
2. Regenerate the surface snapshot: `UPDATE_CLI_SURFACE=1 cargo test --locked -p atla cli_surface`
   (updates `docs/cli-surface.txt`; the test fails until you do this).
3. Update every doc that mentions the command — all `atla` examples in these files are
   parse-checked against the real clap definition by the `doc_examples_parse` test:
   - `docs/agent-reference.md` (§2 command tree + §4/§5 flag tables)
   - `docs/jira.md` / `docs/confluence.md` / other `docs/*.md`
   - `skills/atla-cli/SKILL.md` + `skills/atla-cli/references/*.md`
4. In docs, write runnable examples with concrete values (`--version 4`, not
   `--version N`); use `<ANGLE>` placeholders only in usage-summary lines.

## Skill sync rules

- `skills/atla-cli/` in this repo is the **single source of truth** for the agent skill.
- The installed skill (`~/.agents/skills/atla-cli`) must be a **symlink** to this repo's
  `skills/atla-cli`. Never edit the installed location directly; never install with
  `npx skills add --copy` (a copy caused a 3-week doc/CLI drift in 2026-05/06).
- Skill content policy: SKILL.md holds the command tree, common traps, and quick
  patterns; exact flag syntax lives in `references/*.md`.
- Released CLI and skill versions are exact lockstep. Update
  `skills/atla-cli/compatibility.json`, the SKILL.md compatibility/version gate, and tag-pinned
  install docs together; `python3 scripts/check-skill-version.py` must pass.
- The distributable skill must remain self-contained around the installed `atla` CLI. Do not
  reference or bundle repository-only maintainer, CI, release, or live-smoke tooling there;
  document those workflows under `docs/` instead.

## API codegen / specs

- Refresh flow: `scripts/update-specs.sh` then `cargo build` (each API crate's `build.rs`
  regenerates its client). There is no `generate.sh`.
- All three clients build from **partial specs** (`specs/*-partial.json`). The jira and
  confluence-v1 scripts hand-build minimal specs; `confluence-v2-partial-spec.js` prunes
  the upstream spec to the used operations via $ref closure — when core starts calling a
  new v2 operation, add its snake_case name to `usedOperations` in that script and rerun.
- Every intentional schema repair in `specs/PATCHES.md` is applied automatically by its filter
  script, including Jira `Project.projectTypeKey` and the Confluence v2 enum/scalar repairs. The
  tooling test must reproduce all three checked-in partial specs; still review every invariant on
  refresh.
- `specs/manifest.json` tracks spec sources + SHA256; keep it updated via the script.

## Release workflow hardening

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` starts from cargo-dist output but is intentionally post-generated:
  action refs and installer bytes are SHA-pinned, permissions are job-scoped, shell expressions are
  injection-safe, cargo-cyclonedx 0.5.9 emits a binary-only CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM with hashes, and
  host-compatible macOS/Windows platform archives must pass native smoke tests before publishing.
- `allow-dirty = ["ci"]` in `dist-workspace.toml` is intentional. Do not replace release.yml with
  raw `dist generate` output. If regenerating, reapply the hardening and the release-tag skill
  version gate, verify with `mise run workflow:check` and `mise run workflow:security`, then run
  `dist plan` and artifact smoke tests.

## Agent-facing contracts (do not break)
