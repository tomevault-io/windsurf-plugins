## Build/Lint Commands

- Build: `yarn build`

- Define types with interfaces in appropriate files under domain/types.ts
- Use explicit typing for all properties (avoid any)
- Mark optional properties with ? suffix
- Use ES modules import format
- Use kebab-case for file naming
- Organize imports: external dependencies first, then internal modules
- Handle errors with appropriate try/catch blocks and logging
