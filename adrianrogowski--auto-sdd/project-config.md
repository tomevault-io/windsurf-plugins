# Subagent Patterns for SDD

When executing SDD commands, use subagents (the Task tool) to parallelize independent work. This applies to both interactive commands and the build loop.

## When to Fan Out

### During /spec-first
- **Parallel reads**: Load strategy, constitution, personas, design tokens, learnings index, and search for existing spec simultaneously (up to 6 parallel explore subagents)
- **Component stub creation**: If mockup references 3+ new components, create stubs in parallel

### During /tdd
- **Post-GREEN validation**: Run build check, lint check, and test check simultaneously (3 parallel shell subagents)
- **Drift check + compound**: After refactor, drift check and compound can start reading files in parallel (drift checks code, compound reads learnings index)

### During /build-next
- **Context loading**: Read strategy, vision, personas, constitution, design tokens, related specs, and learnings index in parallel (7 parallel reads)
- **Post-build phases**: If drift check and code review are both enabled, they read independent file sets — run simultaneously

### During /check-coverage
- **Parallel analysis**: Check spec coverage, test coverage, and mapping consistency as 3 independent subagents

### During /catch-drift
- **Multi-spec drift scan**: When scanning multiple specs, batch 3-5 specs per subagent instead of one at a time

### During /guide
- **Parallel gathering**: Read all feature specs, codebase files, and learnings in parallel batches

### During /ralph-run
- **Pre-flight checks**: Validate CLI, check ports, read roadmap simultaneously

## When NOT to Fan Out

- **Sequential dependencies**: Spec must complete before tests, tests before implementation
- **Git operations**: Only one agent should touch git at a time (commits, branches, merges)
- **Roadmap updates**: Single writer to avoid race conditions on roadmap.md
- **Small tasks**: If the total work is < 10 seconds, the subagent overhead isn't worth it

## How to Fan Out

Use the Task tool with appropriate subagent types:

```
# For file reading / exploration
subagent_type: "explore" with model: "fast"

# For shell commands (build, test, lint)
subagent_type: "shell" with model: "fast"

# For complex analysis (drift check, code review)
subagent_type: "generalPurpose"
```

### Pattern: Parallel Reads Then Sequential Write

```
1. Fan out: explore subagents read strategy, constitution, personas, tokens, learnings, existing specs
2. Collect results
3. Sequential: Write the spec using all gathered context
```

### Pattern: Parallel Validation

```
1. Agent completes implementation
2. Fan out: shell subagent runs tests, shell subagent runs build, shell subagent runs lint
3. Collect results
4. If all pass → continue
5. If any fail → fix sequentially (failures may be related)
```

### Pattern: Batch Processing

For commands that process multiple items (drift-scan, doc-loop, check-coverage):
```
1. Gather list of items to process
2. Chunk into batches of PARALLEL_FEATURES (default: 3)
3. Fan out: one subagent per chunk
4. Collect and merge results
```

## Build Loop Integration

The `BRANCH_STRATEGY=parallel` mode in `build-loop-local.sh` already handles script-level parallelism (multiple agent processes in separate worktrees). Within each agent process, use the patterns above for command-level parallelism.
