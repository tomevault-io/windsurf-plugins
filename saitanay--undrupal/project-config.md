# UnDrupal: AI Agent Skills

These skills help you plan and execute a migration off Drupal (D7 through D11). Load the relevant skill file from `skills/` and follow its instructions.

Start with `skills/00-quickstart.md`. It determines your situation, access level, Drupal version, migration target, and scope. It tells you which skills to run and in what order.

## Rules

1. Determine the Drupal version first. It changes available APIs, table schemas, and module locations.
2. Use the best access method available, in this order:
   - JSON:API for D9+ (in core, no contrib needed)
   - Drush with shell access
   - Direct database queries
   - Config files (YAML exports)
   - Admin UI or public URL as last resort
3. Preserve UUIDs as stable cross-system identifiers.
4. Output all exports as JSON with consistent schemas.
5. Include provenance metadata: source site URL, export timestamp, Drupal version.
6. Never export secrets. No API keys, password hashes, SMTP credentials, or payment gateway tokens.
7. D7 has different table schemas than D8+. Check version before writing any SQL.
8. Paragraph resolution is hard. Use Skill 12 for any site with Paragraphs contrib.
9. Rich text contains Drupal-specific tokens (`<drupal-media>`, `[entity:node:123]`, linkit attributes). Use Skill 26 to clean them.
10. Export first, map to target later. Skills produce neutral JSON. Target-specific mapping is a separate step.
11. During audit, check for page builders (Experience Builder, Site Studio, Gutenberg). Each stores content in its own format. Route to the correct skill (33, 34, or 35) before exporting pages built with them.
