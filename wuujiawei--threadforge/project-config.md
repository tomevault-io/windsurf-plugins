# ThreadForge Agent Index

- If the task involves release, publish, tag, changelog, or Maven Central, read `docs/releases.md` first.
- Treat real version tags as real releases, not dry runs.
- Keep the changelog entry visible near the top of `README.md`.
- If Central fails on signature validation, compare the current signature with the previous successful release before retrying.
- In repository docs, use relative paths only. Do not write workstation-specific absolute paths, local usernames, key material, fingerprints, or other sensitive environment-specific data.
