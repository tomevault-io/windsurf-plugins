# Agent Adapters — Engineering Notes

## Integration Research Process

Each agent binary is treated as a black box implementing ACP to an unknown degree of completeness. We assume nothing about compliance — every behavior must be observed and documented empirically.

### Goal

Discover the right foundation for multi-agent support by probing each agent individually, documenting exact behaviors, and building a compatibility matrix from observed evidence. The matrix will expose which ACP features are reliably shared across agents and which require per-agent handling.

### Approach

ACP support across agents is likely a patchwork. Each implementation may:
- Interpret the spec differently
- Support a different subset of methods
- Handle auth, permissions, fs, and terminal in agent-specific ways
- Use different execution models (delegate to client vs execute locally)
- Return unexpected schemas or extra fields
- Fail silently in ways the spec doesn't account for

The probe process is designed to discover these dimensions systematically.

### Integration Effort Loop (per agent)

**1. Probe** — Run `python scripts/probe_acp_agents.py <agent_id>` against the real binary. Observe what happens at each ACP phase: initialize, authenticate, session/new, session/prompt, session/update stream.

**2. Document** — Record every observation in `adapters/<agent>/INTEGRATION_EFFORT_LOG.md`. Each step captures: what was sent, what was received, what broke, what was fixed. No assumptions — only evidence.

**3. Detect anomalies** — Compare observed behavior against the ACP spec and against other agents already probed. Note deviations: different field names, missing methods, unexpected error codes, schema mismatches with the SDK.

**4. Confirm generalities** — When a behavior matches another agent exactly, mark it as a confirmed shared trait. When it differs, mark it as agent-specific. This builds the compatibility matrix incrementally.

**5. Fix and re-probe** — Adjust the adapter or probe as needed, re-run until the full intro.sh exercise completes end-to-end. The exercise proves: file creation, file permissions, terminal execution, output capture.

**6. Update matrix** — Add the agent's row to the compatibility matrix with all observed dimensions.

**7. Reassess generalizations** — After each new agent is integrated, revisit all prior assumptions marked as "shared" in the matrix. A behavior confirmed across 2 agents may break on the 3rd. Any generalization baked into shared adapter code must be re-validated against the full set of completed agents. If a new agent contradicts a prior generalization, the shared code must be refactored to accommodate the variance — not the agent forced to comply.

### Dimensions to Probe

Each agent is evaluated across these dimensions:

| Dimension | What to observe |
|---|---|
| Initialize | protocolVersion accepted, agentInfo returned, agentCapabilities shape |
| Auth | authMethods available, which method works, pre-config required |
| Session | session/new params accepted, models returned, modes returned |
| Model switching | set_session_model supported, model IDs format |
| Execution model | Does agent delegate fs/terminal to client, or execute locally? |
| Permission gating | session/request_permission sent? What options? What response format? |
| File operations | fs/read_text_file and fs/write_text_file — delegated or local? |
| Terminal operations | terminal/create flow — delegated or local? Output format? |
| Session updates | What sessionUpdate types are emitted? Schema matches SDK? |
| Error behavior | How does agent report failures? Error codes? Retry patterns? |
| SDK compatibility | Does `agent-client-protocol` SDK work cleanly, or are there schema mismatches? |
