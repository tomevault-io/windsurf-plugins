# CLAUDE.md

A small, opinionated dependency-injection container (`Thesis\Dic`). PHP 8.4.

## Docs

Public behavior is documented in `docs/` — consult it (and `README.md`) before changing the public API, and keep it in sync:

- [Objects](docs/object.md) — `object()`, factories, post-construction calls, lazy instantiation
- [Values](docs/value.md) — `value()` and refs as services
- [Functions and closures](docs/closure.md) — `function()`, `closure()`, runtime parameters vs. dependencies
- [Arguments](docs/arguments.md) — `arg()` / `args()` / `variadic()`
- [Autowiring](docs/autowiring.md) — `bind()`, qualifiers, per-parameter markers/attributes
- [Tags](docs/tags.md) — `tag()`, `taggedList()`, `onTagResolution()`, `onObject()` / `onFunction()`
- [Modularity](docs/modularity.md) — `Module` interface, `import()` (isolated) vs. `apply()` (shared scope)
- [Lifetimes](docs/lifetime.md) — singleton, scoped, `canBeScoped`
- [Disposal](docs/disposal.md) — `disposer()`

## Commands (everything runs in Docker via `make`)

- `make phpstan` — PHPStan, max level. Must stay clean.
- `make test` — test suite (Testo).
- `make fixer` / `make fixer-check` — PHP-CS-Fixer (apply / dry-run).
- `make check` — everything (fixer-check, rector, phpstan, test, …).
- `make run CMD='php …'` — one-off command in the php container.

After any source change run `make phpstan` and `make test`; before finishing, `make fixer`.

## Tests

- A unit test lives in the **same namespace as the class it covers**, mirroring `src/` under `tests/` (e.g. `Thesis\Dic\Internal\Builder\Autoconfiguration` → `tests/Dic/Internal/Builder/AutoconfigurationTest.php`), and is marked with `#[Covers(...)]`.
  Feature tests that exercise the public API through the `Dic` facade live in `tests/DicTest.php` (namespace `Thesis`).

## Errors (`Thesis\Dic\BuildError`)

- `Thesis\Dic\BuildError extends \LogicException` is a single `final` class — the one public error type; catch it to handle any container error. There is no hierarchy: construct it only through its `@internal` named static factories (e.g. `BuildError::cannotAutowireNoCandidate($parameter)`, `BuildError::circularDependency(...)`), each carrying structured context (ref / parameter / class / reason) and building its own message. The private `cannotAutowire()` / `invalidSignatureArgument()` helpers hold the shared message prefix (the atom); named factories delegate to them. The constructor rewrites `file`/`line` to the throw site so the static-factory frame doesn't leak into `getFile()/getLine()`.
- The name says the phase: every error is raised at **build**, never while a built container resolves services. The full dependency graph is validated eagerly at build — no marker interface, no runtime-error phase.
- `Internal\Autowiring\UnsupportedBindingType` (a separate `@internal` `\LogicException`) is **not** a `BuildError`: it's an internal control-flow signal, caught by type during autowiring and converted into a `BuildError` (`cannotAutowireUnsupportedBindingType` / `unsupportedBindingType`), so it must stay outside the `BuildError` type to remain catchable.
- **Never throw a message-less exception.** User-triggerable problems → a named `BuildError::…()` factory (no raw strings at the throw site). Internal "can't happen" invariants → `Internal\ShouldNotHappen('reason')` (always a reason). `ShouldNotHappen` is a **sibling** of `BuildError` (both extend `\LogicException`), not a `BuildError`; service resolution wraps only `BuildError` into `BuildError::invalidServiceFactory($ref, …)`, so a `ShouldNotHappen` thrown while building a factory propagates raw rather than being mis-attributed to the user's config — the narrow `catch (BuildError)` gives this automatically, no explicit rethrow.
- PHPDoc: `@api` on the `BuildError` class; the `@internal` factories are self-documenting by name — prose only when it adds something beyond the name.

## Rendering (error messages)

- Dependency paths render as indented trees; an edge is `{path} → {node}`, and an empty `Dependency.path` renders as just the node (no `→`).
- Node labels render the **real type**, not prose: `Scoped<X>`, `\Closure(…): …` (via `Typhoon\Type\stringify`) — never placeholders.
- Injected values are wrapped in double quotes. A `Ref` quotes itself in `Ref::__toString` (`"{label}" ({location})`), so insert refs raw (`{$ref}`); for everything else use `sprintf` with `"%s"` rather than escaping quotes inside an interpolated string.

## Markdown

- One sentence per line: start each new sentence on its own line within the same paragraph (semantic line breaks). Blank line still separates paragraphs.
- Soft-wrap at 120 columns; only wrap a single sentence onto the next line if it exceeds that.

## Taste

- PHP 8.4 throughout: property hooks, asymmetric visibility (`public private(set)`), `readonly`.
- Put each format/convention in one place (the atom) rather than scattering string-building.
- Keep transient single-use accumulators mutable; reserve immutability for shared/aliased data.
- Method names must match behavior.
- A multiline `args([...])` array: one entry per line with a trailing comma; never pack a multiline args array onto one line.
