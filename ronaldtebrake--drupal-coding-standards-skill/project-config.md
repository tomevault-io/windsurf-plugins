## Updating Drupal Coding Standards

When a new version of the Drupal coding standards is released, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Update Composer Dependency Version

1. Open `composer.json`
2. In the `repositories[0].package` section, update the `version` field:
   - Current: `"version": "0.1"`
   - New: `"version": "0.2"` (increment as needed)
3. Update the `require-dev` constraint if needed:
   - Current: `"drupal/coding_standards": "^0.1"`
   - New: `"drupal/coding_standards": "^0.2"`

### Step 2: Update Dependencies

Run Composer to fetch the updated standards:

```bash
composer update drupal/coding_standards
```

This will download the latest standards to `vendor/drupal/coding_standards/docs/`.

### Step 3: Copy Updated Standards to Assets

Copy the updated standards from vendor to the skill's assets directory:

```bash
rm -rf .claude/skills/drupal-coding-standards/assets/standards
cp -r vendor/drupal/coding_standards/docs .claude/skills/drupal-coding-standards/assets/standards
```

**Important**: Verify the copy was successful by checking that files exist:
```bash
ls -la .claude/skills/drupal-coding-standards/assets/standards/
```

### Step 4: Update Skill Version

Update the version in the skill's frontmatter:

1. Open `.claude/skills/drupal-coding-standards/SKILL.md`
2. Update the `version` field in the YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
    ---
    name: drupal-coding-standards
    description: Review code according to Drupal's official coding standards. Provides AI agents with comprehensive guidelines for PHP, JavaScript, CSS, Twig, YAML, SQL, and markup files in Drupal projects. Uses dynamic context discovery to load only relevant standards based on file type being reviewed.
    metadata:
    author: ronaldtebrake
    version: "0.1" # update this
    ---
   ```

### Step 5: Update CHANGELOG.md

Add a new entry to `CHANGELOG.md` following the existing format:

```markdown
## [1.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Updated
- Updated Drupal coding standards to version X.X (from drupal/coding_standards repository)
- Updated standards files in assets/standards/ to match latest Drupal documentation

### Notes
- Standards pulled from drupal/coding_standards repository version X.X
```

### Step 6: Verify Structure

Ensure the standards directory structure is correct:

```bash
# Check main categories exist
ls .claude/skills/drupal-coding-standards/assets/standards/

# Should include: php/, javascript/, css/, twig/, yaml/, sql/, markup/, accessibility/, etc.
```

### Step 7: Report

Let the user know you're done, so they can run their checks before committing and tagging this new version.

## Key Files to Update

When updating standards, always update:

1. ✅ `.claude/skills/drupal-coding-standards/assets/standards/` - The actual standards files
2. ✅ `.claude/skills/drupal-coding-standards/SKILL.md` - Version in frontmatter
3. ✅ `composer.json` - Dependency version in repositories and require-dev
4. ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` - Add entry documenting the update

## Files That Should NOT Change

These files should remain stable unless the Drupal coding standards repository structure changes:

- `standards-index.md` - Only update if file structure in coding_standards repo changes
- `README.md` - Only update if installation/usage process changes
- `AGENTS.md` - Only update if maintenance process changes

## Verification Checklist

Before committing an update, verify:

- [ ] Standards files copied successfully to `assets/standards/`
- [ ] All expected categories present (php, javascript, css, twig, yaml, sql, markup, accessibility)
- [ ] SKILL.md version updated
- [ ] composer.json version updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md entry added
- [ ] Git status shows only expected files changed

## Troubleshooting

### Standards directory is empty after copy

- Verify `vendor/drupal/coding_standards/docs` exists
- Check that `composer update` completed successfully
- Ensure you're running commands from the repository root

### Version mismatch errors

- Ensure version in `composer.json` repositories section matches require-dev constraint
- Check that SKILL.md frontmatter version is updated

### Missing categories in standards

- Check the Drupal coding_standards repository structure
- Update `standards-index.md` if new categories are added
- Update README.md if new file types are supported

## Dependencies

- **For end users**: None - the skill is self-contained with all assets scaffolded
