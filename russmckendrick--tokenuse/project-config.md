## Tooling

- **Code discovery via `/codebase-memory`.** This repo is indexed by the `codebase-memory-mcp` server. Prefer its tools (`search_graph`, `trace_path`, `get_code_snippet`, `get_architecture`, `query_graph`, `search_code`) for locating functions, callers, call chains, or architecture overviews — they return structured graph results in a fraction of the tokens that `grep`/`Read` would burn. Fall back to `Grep`/`Read` only for plain-text content (markdown, configs, fixtures) or when the graph is stale. If the index is missing or out of date, run `index_repository` first; `detect_changes` maps a working-tree diff to affected symbols.
- Before finishing code changes, run the same local pass as the CI check jobs: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` from the repo root.
- For desktop changes, also mirror the CI desktop check job: from `desktop/`, run `CI=true pnpm run check` and `CI=true pnpm run build`; from `desktop/src-tauri/`, run `cargo check`.
- Run all desktop `pnpm` commands non-interactively with `CI=true` so pnpm never stops on a no-TTY module purge prompt.
- If a required dependency/check command fails because the sandbox blocks registry or network access, rerun the same command with network approval instead of retrying in the sandbox.
- Update embedded pricing: `cargo run -- --refresh-prices` - never hand-edit `costs/pricing-upstream.json` or `src/pricing/snapshot.json`.
- Update embedded currency rates: `cargo run -- --generate-currency-json` - never hand-edit `costs/exchange-rates.json`.
- Default builds include confirmed Config-page downloads for local exchange-rate/pricing files. Use `--no-default-features` for a no-download build; `ureq` remains gated behind the `refresh-prices` and `refresh-currency` features.

## Non-obvious rules

- Consult `DESIGN.md` before any UI/theme change - the color tokens, density rules, and "no rounded card styling" guidance are enforced.
- Ingest results are cached at `~/.cache/tokenuse/ingest-cache.json` (TTL 15 min). On startup a fresh cache is reused so the dashboard opens fast; a stale or missing cache falls through to a synchronous ingest. A background refresher then re-runs ingest every 15 min and on the 'r' key, writing back to the cache. There is no live file watching - the timer is the only auto-refresh signal. Subcommands like `--list-projects` always run a fresh ingest and bypass the cache.
- `DashboardData` fields are `&'static str`. Sample data uses string literals; ingested data is leaked via the `leak()` helper in `src/ingest/pipeline.rs`. Do not change these to `String` without auditing every renderer.
- All shipped user-facing wording belongs in `src/copy/copy.json` and is exposed through `src/copy/mod.rs` / Tauri snapshots. Rust and Svelte should reference copy keys, not inline display strings, except for protocol IDs, parser fixtures, CSS classes, file names, and data-derived values.
- The dashboard reads usage files directly - no Anthropic/OpenAI platform API keys, no proxy, no telemetry. Don't add network calls outside explicit Config-page downloads or maintainer refresh feature paths. The opt-in `quota-sync` feature stores a Claude.ai or ChatGPT session cookie locally (OS keychain) and calls those services' user-facing usage endpoints only when the user triggers a sync from the Config page; see `docs/tools/claude-subscription.md` and `docs/tools/codex-subscription.md` before adjusting that flow.

## Documentation

- Add user-visible changes that affect shipped behavior or documented workflows to `docs/releases/unreleased.md`.
- Do not bump `Cargo.toml`, edit `Cargo.lock` just for a version change, or create a numbered `docs/releases/<version>.md` unless Russ explicitly asks to prep a release.
- When Russ asks to prep a release, choose a short human-readable release name, move the relevant `unreleased.md` notes into `docs/releases/<version>.md` using that name in the title and intro, then bump `Cargo.toml` and let Cargo update `Cargo.lock` in the same change.
- Keep `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/usage.md`, and the `docs/tools/<name>.md` files in sync with the code they describe. If you change page routing, ingestion behavior, or a tool adapter's source schema, update the matching doc in the same change.
- Update `docs/README.md` whenever a new top-level doc lands so the index stays current.

## Tool Adapter Conventions

- User-facing docs and UI call Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Copilot **tools**. The Rust adapter trait is named `ToolAdapter` and lives under `src/tools/`.
- Each tool adapter lives in `src/tools/<name>/{mod,config,discovery,parser}.rs`. **All paths, env vars, globs, and SQL queries belong in that adapter's `config.rs`** - not in a shared top-level config.
