# AGENTS.md — WebCodex Repository Guide

These are the always-on rules for ordinary repository work. Read only the linked sections needed for the current task. A deeper `AGENTS.md` governs its directory.

## 1. Verify and preserve

- Work only in the repository, worktree, and external target authorized by the user.
- At task start, verify the root, branch, HEAD, status, relevant changes, and recent history. Recheck only after a Git operation, an observed concurrent change, or before committing.
- Treat prompt hashes, paths, branches, and runtime state as expectations to verify, never as reasons to overwrite the actual repository.
- Preserve unrelated work. Do not reset, rebase, restore, clean, or rewrite history unless the user explicitly requests that operation.
- Inspect only the implementation, tests, documentation, and diff relevant to the task; do not bulk-read unrelated material.

## 2. Build the simplest useful product

- Optimize for a workflow that is simple, obvious, and easy to operate.
- Prefer the smallest direct solution. Add abstractions, configuration, modes, compatibility layers, or extension points only for a concrete current need or a demonstrated reliability problem.
- Do not build a general framework for one use case. Wait for a second concrete use case before extracting shared machinery.
- Do not design for hypothetical consumers, tenants, deployment scales, or trust boundaries that the product does not have.
- Protect real boundaries—credentials, public entry points, destructive actions, wrong-target execution, repository history, and published artifacts—without adding policy machinery for imaginary ones.
- When two designs satisfy the current need, choose the one with fewer concepts, states, configuration paths, and maintenance costs.

Product direction: [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) and [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 3. Follow intent and make focused changes

- The requested outcome, scope, prohibited actions, and acceptance conditions are hard constraints. Suggested files, symbols, commands, and step order are guidance unless explicitly mandatory.
- If guidance conflicts with current code or repository conventions, make the smallest adjustment that still satisfies the task.
- Do not knowingly create a bug, inconsistent state, resource leak, compatibility hazard, or false validation result.
- Prefer the smallest coherent change. Follow existing architecture and naming; avoid speculative compatibility, duplicate representations, unrelated cleanup, and broad refactors without a named current need.
- Keep only the interfaces actually affected by the change consistent. Do not touch or revalidate unrelated projections merely because they exist.
- Add focused tests for changed behavior when practical. Update documentation when public behavior or operations change.
- Ask only when required information cannot be discovered, instructions materially conflict, or proceeding could destroy work. Otherwise continue and report any material deviation.

## 4. Validate only changed behavior

Validation is evidence, not ceremony.

- Start with the smallest check that can detect a regression. Stop when sufficient relevant evidence has passed.
- Reuse a successful result from the exact same HEAD when relevant files have not changed.
- Do not rerun the same command unless relevant code changed, a rebase or conflict invalidated it, the earlier run was incomplete or flaky, or the user requested a repeat.
- Documentation-only changes do not require Cargo compilation or tests.
- Rust changes normally require affected formatting, the smallest relevant package check when compilation may be affected, and focused tests.
- Full library or workspace tests, `--all-targets`, ignored tests, real-process harnesses, and E2E scripts are not defaults. Run them only for an explicit user request, release or deployment, a genuinely cross-cutting boundary, broad conflict resolution, or when focused validation cannot cover the change. State the reason first.
- Distinguish current failures from pre-existing failures, expected negative cases, and failures resolved by a successful retry.
- Before finishing, review the diff and confirm whitespace, worktree, conflict, and active-job state.

Testing guidance: [`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md).

## 5. Protect work and keep delivery explicit

- Never print, commit, or expose credentials, authorization headers, private keys, tokens, secret files, or sensitive command output.
- Do not silently overwrite concurrent changes. Prefer guarded or conflict-detecting edits.
- Do not weaken meaningful authentication, authorization, validation, schemas, sandboxing, or tests merely to obtain a green result.
- Do not force-push, move published tags, overwrite releases, destructively reset other work, or rewrite published history without an explicit request naming the operation and target.
- Push, publish, tag, release, deploy, restart services, or alter external systems only when the task explicitly includes it and identifies the destination.
- Review status and diff before committing. Do not mix unrelated work or amend an unrelated commit.
