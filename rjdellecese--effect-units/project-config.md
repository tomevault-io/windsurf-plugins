# Repo Overview

effect-units is a single-package TypeScript library providing typed quantities and unit conversions for Effect (requires Node >= 22, pnpm). It targets Effect v4's release candidates: `effect` is pinned exactly in devDependencies and declared as `^4.0.0-rc.115` in peerDependencies, and `@effect/vitest` is unified-versioned with it, so the two move together.

## Build System

The package is built with tsdown (JavaScript output; `dts: false` delegates declarations to tsc) plus TypeScript: `tsc -b tsconfig.src.json` emits the `.d.ts` declarations. `tsconfig.json` is the noEmit typecheck project covering all sources, tests, and root config files; both extend `tsconfig.base.json`. Relative imports use `.ts` extensions (`import * as Unit from "./Unit.ts"`, the Effect v4 convention): `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` rewrites them to `.js` in tsdown's JavaScript output, declarations keep the `.ts` specifiers (which consumers' TypeScript resolves), and NodeNext module resolution makes tsc error on any extensionless relative import.

### Key Commands

- `pnpm build` - Build `dist/` (tsdown JavaScript + tsc declarations)
- `pnpm test` - Run the Vitest suite (includes type-level tests and coverage)
- `pnpm typecheck` - Typecheck sources and tests via `tsc -b`
- `pnpm lint`/`pnpm lint:fix` - Lint (Oxlint + Syncpack); `lint:fix` writes fixes
- `pnpm format`/`pnpm format:check` - Format (Oxfmt + Syncpack); `format` writes, `format:check` only checks
- `pnpm circular` - Fail on runtime import cycles (dpdm; type-only cycles are ignored)
- `pnpm clean` - Remove dist, coverage, and node_modules

## Conventions

- Import Effect modules from their submodule paths (e.g. `import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"`), not from bare `"effect"`—enforced for value imports by Oxlint's `no-restricted-imports` (type-only imports are exempt from the lint rule, but follow the convention anyway).
- Tests live in `test/*.test.ts` and use `@effect/vitest`; shared test helpers live alongside them in `test/` (excluded from the build and coverage).
- Property tests use `it.prop` (or `it.effect.prop` for Effects) with schemas or native `effect/unstable/arbitrary/Arbitrary` generators. Preserve numeric bounds and exclusions when composing generators, and configure run counts with `{ arbitrary: { runs } }`.
- Source modules are PascalCase (one module per unit/quantity); helpers are camelCase.
- Import Effect modules unaliased even when the name shadows a global (`import * as String from "effect/String"`), and reach for the built-in through `globalThis` (`globalThis.String(n)`, `globalThis.BigInt(n)`). Alias only to avoid shadowing a local export—`order` for `effect/Order` next to an exported `Order`, `Equivalence_` next to an exported `Equivalence`.
- Schemas follow the Effect v4 convention: the bare name is the identity schema and `XFromY` is the codec, named for its encoded form (`Unit`/`UnitFromString`, `Length`/`LengthFromStruct`). There is no `FromSelf`—that was the v3 spelling, and v4 dropped it.
- Every declaration carries its wire format twice over: once as the named `XFromY` codec (precise encoded type) and once as a `toCodecJson` annotation (composable, so `Schema.toCodecJson` works when the value is nested in a caller's schema, and nested declarations lower automatically). Both are built from a single `wire`/`wireStruct` + `wireTransformation` definition per module so they cannot drift. A declaration _without_ the annotation falls back to `Json` and fails at runtime on any non-JSON value; each of those six modules' own test file carries the regression test—the `toCodecJson` cases at the end of its schema tests, which fail with `Expected JSON value` if the annotation is dropped.
- Functions returning `boolean` are prefixed `is`/`are`, with two deliberate exceptions that keep this package aligned with Effect v4's own modules: `equals`/`equalsWithin` (v4 exports `equals` unprefixed from `BigDecimal`, `Duration`, `Cron`, and `Equal`), and `Equivalence`, which is a typeclass instance like `Order` rather than a predicate. Note `Rational.isBetween` deliberately _does_ take the prefix even though v4 spells it `BigDecimal.between`; v4 is inconsistent there (only `Order.isBetween` is prefixed) and this package is not. `Duration.between`/`DurationExact.between` are unrelated—they return a duration, not a boolean.

## Versioning and Publishing

Versioning and changelogs are managed with Changesets. Use `pnpm changeset` to create a changeset before merging a PR with user-facing changes; the Release workflow opens/updates a "Version Packages" PR, and merging that PR publishes to npm, tags the release, and creates the GitHub release.
