# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a weekly AI development digest project that automatically collects information from various sources (GitHub releases, changelogs, AI news) and generates articles for Note publication.

## Commands and Skills

### Main Pipeline Command
```bash
# Execute the full digest pipeline
# This runs 7 digest skills in PARALLEL using Task agents, then generates the final article
```
Located at: `.claude/commands/weekly_digest_pipeline.md`

### Individual Digest Skills (v1.1.0)

Skills are executed as isolated Task agents with their own context, enabling parallel execution and preventing context overflow.

| Skill | Description | Location |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Release Digest | Checks GitHub releases and changelogs | `.claude/skills/vibecoding_release_digest.md` |
| AI News | Collects recent AI-related news | `.claude/skills/ai_news_digest.md` |
| Trending Repos | Analyzes trending AI repositories on GitHub | `.claude/skills/ai_trending_repositories_digest.md` |
| Trending Papers | Collects trending AI papers from Hugging Face | `.claude/skills/ai_trending_papers_digest.md` |
| AI Events | Searches upcoming AI events on Connpass | `.claude/skills/ai_events_digest.md` |
| HN & Reddit | Collects trending discussions from HN/Reddit | `.claude/skills/hacker_news_reddit_digest.md` |
| Tech Blogs | Searches AI articles on Zenn, Qiita, note | `.claude/skills/ai_tec_blog_digest.md` |
| Article Generation | Creates final article from collected data | `.claude/skills/generate_weekly_article.md` |
| Guardrail Review | Validates article quality with textlint | `.claude/skills/article_guardrail_review.md` |

## Workflow

1. **Parallel Information Collection**: 7 digest skills run simultaneously as isolated Task agents
2. **Result Collection**: Pipeline waits for all tasks to complete and collects results
3. **Data Aggregation**: Information is saved to `resources/YYYY-MM-DD/` directory
4. **Article Generation**: Creates final article in `articles/` directory
5. **Quality Assurance**: Generated articles are automatically checked with textlint for Japanese AI writing guidelines
6. **Publication**: Articles are formatted for Note publication with improved quality and consistency

### Architecture Benefits (v1.1.0)

- **Parallel Execution**: All 7 digest tasks run concurrently, reducing total execution time
- **Context Isolation**: Each skill runs in its own Task agent context, preventing context overflow
- **Improved Reliability**: Failed tasks don't affect other tasks; partial results can still be used

### Failure Recovery Options

- **Complete Failure**: If pipeline fails completely, run individual skills manually via `/skill_name`
- **Partial Failure**: Use `generate_weekly_article` skill to create article from existing data

## Quality Assurance with textlint

This project uses textlint to ensure high-quality Japanese AI writing. The system automatically checks generated articles for:

- **AI Writing Guidelines**: Prevents overuse of AI-generated expressions and hype language
- **Technical Writing Standards**: Ensures clear, professional communication
- **Formatting Consistency**: Maintains consistent bullet points and emphasis patterns
- **Content Quality**: Reduces redundant expressions and improves readability

### textlint Configuration

The project uses `@textlint-ja/preset-ai-writing` with customized rules:
- Detection of AI-generated hype expressions
- Prevention of excessive emphasis patterns
- Control of colon continuation usage
- Technical writing guideline enforcement

Generated articles are automatically validated during the pipeline execution, ensuring publication-ready quality.

## Important Notes

- All digest skills expect today's date as an argument (e.g., `/vibecoding_release_digest 2025-12-28`)
- Skills run as isolated Task agents with `run_in_background=true` for parallel execution
- Generated articles are in Japanese and formatted for Note platform
- The pipeline automatically handles task execution, result collection, and error handling
- Articles include relevant emojis and proper formatting for engagement
