# company-brain

A long-term **sync hub** that checks a company's data sources into Git as plain, searchable files, so an AI agent has durable, greppable context about the business. Data is pulled into the repo as Markdown; the agent reads files, greps, and follows links instead of querying live MCP servers.

Runs on [Bun](https://bun.sh): TypeScript, no build step.

## Layout

- `src/connectors/<source>/` — one connector per data source, entry point `sync.ts`. Existing: `notion`, `repo`, `web`, `zendesk`, `pylon`, `granola`.
- `src/lib/` — shared helpers
- `context/<source>/` — synced output, committed to the repo so agents have durable context.
- `.github/` — per-source sync action + workflow (schedules are opt-in; uncomment the `schedule:` block in the matching workflow to enable)
- `.agents/skills/` — skills for common tasks: `add-connector`, `setup-connector`, `update-changelog`

## Connector templates

The canonical connector templates live at https://github.com/kombohq/company-brain/tree/main/src/connectors/. Before building a new connector from scratch, check there for the latest patterns.

## Changelog

Every user-facing change (a feature or bug fix) adds a terse bullet to `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]`. See the `update-changelog` skill. Releases are cut with `bun run release` (`scripts/release.sh`), which rolls `[Unreleased]` into a dated version section, tags, and creates the GitHub release. The script's pure helpers are unit-tested with [bashunit](https://bashunit.com) (`bun run test:sh`, `scripts/release_test.sh`).
