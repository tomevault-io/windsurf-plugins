# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

NeurolingsCE is a C++17/Qt 6 desktop application. First-party application code lives in `src/app/`: `core/` contains assets, commands, IPC, HTTP, audio, updates, and the Shijima engine; `runtime/` coordinates sessions and lifecycle; `ui/` contains windows, pages, dialogs, menus, and mascot rendering. Public headers mirror these features under `include/shijima-qt/`. Platform-specific implementations are under `src/platform/Platform/{Windows,Linux,macOS,Stub}`. Tests currently live in `src/app/tests/`. Resources and the bundled mascot are in `src/resources/` and `src/assets/`; translations are in `translations/`.

Treat `ElaWidgetTools/`, `cpp-httplib/`, and most of `libshimejifinder/` as vendored dependencies. Build helpers belong in `cmake/`, packaging scripts in `src/tools/` and `installer/`, and generated output in `build/` or `out/`.

## Agent Code Orientation

src/app/README.md is the entry point for understanding the application layer. Every directory under src/app/ has a README.md that describes the directory responsibility, the main data/control flow, and the purpose of every source or header file in that directory. Before changing a file, read the nearest README and then follow its links to the caller/callee modules when the change crosses a boundary.

Use the documentation hierarchy as a fast reading map:

- src/app/README.md explains application startup, GUI tick flow, CLI/IPC flow, and the module index.
- src/app/core/README.md explains shared services; core/commands/README.md is the JSON contract boundary and core/assets/README.md is the package/path security boundary.
- src/app/runtime/README.md explains Manager lifecycle, template/session ownership, screen environments, imports, and tick ordering.
- src/app/ui/README.md explains the QWidget layer; its child READMEs separate pages, mascot rendering/input, menus, dialogs, and speech bubbles.
- src/app/core/shijima-engine/README.md and the nested engine READMEs explain parser → factory → behavior → action → state/environment execution. rapidxml/ and scripting/duktape/ are vendored boundaries.
- src/app/cli/README.md and src/app/tests/README.md document command execution/output and the corresponding behavior/security tests.

These READMEs are navigation documents, not substitutes for public headers or implementation contracts. When adding, moving, renaming, or materially changing a file under src/app/, update the nearest README and any parent directory index in the same change. Keep file responsibility descriptions aligned with the actual call graph, thread boundary, ownership/lifecycle rules, security limits, and JSON fields. Do not modify vendored engine/dependency sources merely to update documentation.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Initialize dependencies after cloning:

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

On Windows with Ninja + MSVC, use the provided build entry so that configure
and build run under the same console code page. CMake derives the MSVC
`/showIncludes` dependency prefix from the console output code page at
configure time; if configure runs under a different effective code page than
the build (for example a UTF-8 PowerShell session), `rules.ninja` gets a
mojibake `msvc_deps_prefix`, Ninja records no header dependencies, and stale
objects are not rebuilt.

```powershell
src\tools\build-windows-ninja.cmd build Release   # also accepts Debug / RelWithDebInfo
```

The script pins the console code page (936 on zh-CN systems), loads the MSVC
environment, configures with Ninja, and builds. Set
`NEUROLINGSCE_BUILD_CODEPAGE` to override the code page (for example a
non-zh-CN locale). The equivalent manual commands must run in the same `cmd`
session:

```powershell
cmd /c "chcp 936 >nul && cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DQt6_DIR=D:/Qt/6.8.3/msvc2022_64/lib/cmake/Qt6 && cmake --build build --parallel"
```

Run the registered tests with:

```powershell
ctest --test-dir build -C Debug --output-on-failure
```

Executables are emitted beneath `build/bin/` (or `out/build/<preset>/bin/` with Visual Studio settings). Smoke-test CLI changes with `NeurolingsCE-cli --json --version`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Preserve the surrounding C++ style; no repository-wide formatter or linter is configured. Use four-space indentation, braces on the same line, and focused translation units. Classes and Qt widgets use `PascalCase`; functions and variables use `camelCase`; constants follow the nearest module. Keep public declarations in `.hpp` and implementations in `.cc`. Do not reformat or edit vendored code incidentally.
