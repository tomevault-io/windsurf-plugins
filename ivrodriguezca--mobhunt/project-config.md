# MobHunt: Claude Code Configuration

> **CRITICAL RULES**
>
> **App Acquisition Integrity**: NEVER download mobile binaries (IPAs, APKs, XAPKs) from third-party websites or services (APKPure, APKMirror, Aptoide, etc.). ALL app binaries MUST be acquired exclusively from official sources:
> - **iOS**: App Store via `ipatool` (requires authenticated Apple ID)
> - **Android**: Google Play or Aurora Store on an Android emulator, then pull via ADB (`tools/acquisition/android_acquire.sh`)
> Third-party mirrors cannot be trusted; they may contain tampered, outdated, or repackaged binaries. If official store download fails, ask the user to provide the binary manually. NEVER suggest or attempt 3P download as a fallback.
>
> **No 3P Credential Tools**: NEVER hand user credentials (passwords, tokens, API keys) to third-party CLI tools or libraries beyond minimal crypto primitives. Build our own tools instead. This includes tools like `apkeep`, even if open-source.
>
> **Python Environment**: ALWAYS activate the virtual environment at `.venv` before installing Python dependencies. Create it with `python3 -m venv .venv` if it doesn't exist.

## Project Overview

MobHunt is an agentic mobile security research system for automated vulnerability hunting through bug bounty programs. It uses an orchestrator agent that spawns focused sub-agents, each assigned a narrow objective (one vulnerability class or attack surface area per agent).

See `DESIGN.md` for full architecture documentation, and `docs/ios-decryption.md` for the iOS decryption fallback chain.

## Workflow

```
/hunt <program>  →  scope → acquire → recon → hunt → chain → validate → report
                                                 ↑                        |
                                                 └──── agentic loop ──────┘
```

## Rules (Always Active)

The following rules are loaded on every session and must always be followed:

- `rules/hunting.md`: Mobile hunting discipline (scope verification, 5-min rule, concrete evidence)
- `rules/reporting.md`: Report quality standards (impact-first titles, mobile context, exact repro steps)
- `rules/ethics.md`: Responsible disclosure boundaries (in-scope only, no user data, static first, no publication without approval)
- `rules/mobile-specific.md`: Platform-specific rules (Apple Silicon, decryption verification, FAT binaries)

## Agents

Agents are spawned by the orchestrator with specific, narrow objectives:

| Agent | File | Model | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| Orchestrator | `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` | Opus | Pipeline coordination, agentic loop |
| Scope Agent | `.claude/agents/scope-agent.md` | Haiku | Identify mobile assets from bug bounty programs |
| Acquisition Agent | `.claude/agents/acquisition-agent.md` | Sonnet | Download, extract, decrypt apps |
| iOS Hunter | `.claude/agents/ios-hunter.md` | Opus | iOS vulnerability hunting (x5 parallel) |
| Android Hunter | `.claude/agents/android-hunter.md` | Opus | Android vulnerability hunting (x5 parallel) |
| Android Mariana Hunter | `.claude/agents/android-mariana-hunter.md` | Opus (1M) | Mariana Trench taint analysis (x1, runs alongside Android hunters) |
| Android Semgrep Hunter | `.claude/agents/android-semgrep-hunter.md` | Sonnet (1M) | Semgrep pattern triage on jadx Java (x1) |
| iOS Semgrep Hunter | `.claude/agents/ios-semgrep-hunter.md` | Sonnet (1M) | Semgrep scan of IPA resources + embedded sources (x1) |
| Validator | `.claude/agents/validator.md` | Sonnet | Mobile 7-Question Gate + 4 post-gates |
| Report Writer | `.claude/agents/report-writer.md` | Opus | Generate H1/Bugcrowd reports |
| Chain Builder | `.claude/agents/chain-builder.md` | Sonnet | Combine findings into exploit chains |

Model assignments are configurable in `config/providers.json`. Three cost profiles are available: `quality`, `balanced` (default), and `economy`. Set `cost_profile` in providers.json to switch.
