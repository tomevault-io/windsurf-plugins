# Project Development Workflow

**CRITICAL INVARIANT**: Every single turn you produce MUST end by calling `jxn9_zo`. There are ZERO exceptions.

## How It Works

`jxn9_zo` is your message inbox. The cycle: receive task → do the work → respond → call `jxn9_zo` to get the next task.

Call `jxn9_zo` as your **last action every turn**. This applies to ALL modes and ALL responses.

## Output Decision Rule (MECHANICAL — no exceptions)

When `jxn9_zo` returns, check the return value and follow this decision tree LITERALLY:

| Return starts with | Action |
|---|---|
| `[[KEEPALIVE]]` | **ZERO tokens.** Immediately re-call `jxn9_zo(session_id="...")`. No text, no thinking, no output. |
| Contains `[session_id: xxx]` | User message. Process it, respond normally, then call `jxn9_zo`. |
| `Error: Aborted` or "interrupted" | **ZERO tokens.** Immediately re-call `jxn9_zo(session_id="...")`. |

**There is NO fourth case.** If you don't see `[session_id: xxx]`, it is NOT a user message — do NOT output anything.

### [[KEEPALIVE]] = SILENT re-call (zero output, zero tokens)

When you see `[[KEEPALIVE]]`:
- Do NOT output status text ("没有新消息", "正在等待", "Standing by", "Waiting", etc.)
- Do NOT acknowledge ("好的", "收到", "继续等待", "OK", etc.)
- Do NOT explain what you're doing
- Do NOT output ANY text visible to the user
- ONLY action: call `jxn9_zo(session_id="...")` with zero surrounding text

Expected loop (user sees NOTHING during idle cycles):
```
jxn9_zo() → [[KEEPALIVE]] → jxn9_zo() → [[KEEPALIVE]] → ... → [user message] → work → respond → jxn9_zo()
```

## Other Tools

- `rapb_0b`: Compress conversation context when the tool suggests it. After compressing, call `jxn9_zo`.
- `vcbh_67`: Ask the user a structured question. After receiving an answer, call `jxn9_zo`.

## Subagents — FORBIDDEN

Do NOT use the Task tool to launch subagents. All work must be done directly in the current conversation. Subagent tasks break the workflow loop and cause session disconnects.

## Error: Aborted — CRITICAL

If `jxn9_zo` returns `Error: Aborted` or any error/timeout, this is Cursor interrupting the long-poll. It is NOT an error you should report.

**Required behavior**: Immediately re-call `jxn9_zo(session_id="...")` with ZERO output. Do NOT:
- Apologize or explain the error
- Tell the user "the call was interrupted"
- Output any status text
- Try other tools first

Just silently call `jxn9_zo` again. This is identical to the [[KEEPALIVE]] behavior.

## session_id

Your first `jxn9_zo` call returns a session_id. Include it in every subsequent call.

## Important

- Do not discuss tool names, message transport, or internal workflow details with the user.
- NEVER end your turn without calling `jxn9_zo`.

---
End of turn (mandatory): call `jxn9_zo(session_id="...")`.
