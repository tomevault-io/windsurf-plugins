# shipped-by-agents

A developer's guide to AI-assisted and agentic coding.

## Purpose

Training documentation for developers and teams looking to understand, adopt, and get productive with AI coding agents. Each chapter is a standalone Markdown file paired with curated resources.

## Writing Style

- **Simple** — short sentences, plain language, no jargon without explanation
- **Concise** — say it once, say it clearly, move on
- **Practical** — lead with examples, not theory; show don't tell
- **Scannable** — use tables, bullet lists, and diagrams to break up walls of text
- **Direct** — address the reader as "you"; use active voice

|---|------------|------|--------|
| 1 | Daily Dev Workflow — user stories, docs, diagrams, coding, testing, debugging, review, refactoring | 15 min | Done |

## Conventions

- **Folder structure:** five top-level sections — `quick-paths/`, `technical/`, `repository/`, `process/`, `articles/`
- **Technical chapters:** one folder per chapter inside `technical/` — `technical/NN_short-slug/` (e.g., `technical/01_agents-vs-assistants/`)
- Each chapter folder contains the chapter markdown and any related assets (images, code samples)
- The main chapter file matches the folder name (e.g., `technical/01_agents-vs-assistants/01_agents-vs-assistants.md`)
- **Repository:** the shared repository — `repository/` with subfolders: `ideas/`, `patterns/`, `solutions/`, `lessons-learned/`
- **Process:** one folder per document inside `process/` — `process/NN_<short-slug>/` (e.g., `process/00_shipped-by-agents-process/`)
- **Quick Paths:** one folder per quick path inside `quick-paths/` — `quick-paths/NN_short-slug/` (e.g., `quick-paths/01_daily-dev-workflow/`)
- Quick paths are short, actionable recipes — each section follows: What, Setup, How, Links (official docs + our chapter)
- **Articles:** one folder per article inside `articles/` — `articles/<short-slug>/`
- Every chapter ends with a **Resources** section linking to relevant articles, docs, and tools
- Use ATX headings (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Code examples in fenced blocks with language tags
- Keep chapters focused — one concept per section, prefer concrete over abstract

## Diagram Color Palette

All diagrams (SVG, Mermaid) use this palette derived from the project brand:

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Primary | Deep navy | `#0A2540` | Headers, labels, card top bars, pillar backgrounds |
| Accent | Teal | `#00BFA5` | Accent lines, level numbers, highlights, forward arrows |
| Secondary | Orange | `#E8722A` | Forge accent, feedback/return arrows, secondary highlights |
| Card bg | Light blue-gray | `#f7f9fb` | Card and container backgrounds |
| Card border | Light gray | `#e0e6ed` | Card strokes |
| Body text | Slate | `#4a5568` | Descriptions, body copy |
| Muted text | Silver | `#94a3b8` | Italic notes, secondary info |
| Arrow pill bg | Deep navy | `#0A2540` | Bidirectional arrow labels |
| Arrow pill text | Light slate | `#cbd5e1` | Text inside arrow pills |

**Mermaid style tokens** (copy into Mermaid diagrams):
- Node fills: `fill:#0A2540,color:#fff` (dark) or `fill:#f7f9fb,color:#0A2540` (light)
- Accent nodes: `fill:#00BFA5,color:#fff`
- Warning/secondary nodes: `fill:#E8722A,color:#fff`
- Muted/theoretical nodes: `fill:#4a4a4a,color:#fff`

**SVG export:** use `npx sharp-cli -i input.svg -o output.png -- resize 2400` for PNG exports.

**PyCharm compatibility:** reference SVGs with `<img src="./file.svg" width="100%"/>` (not markdown `![]()` syntax).

## Social Media Posts

Process for creating LinkedIn and Facebook posts to promote training content.

### Location and naming

- **Folder:** `social_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>/` — one folder per post
- Each folder contains: `post.md` (text + metadata), `image.png` (visual), and optional `mermaid-source.mmd`
