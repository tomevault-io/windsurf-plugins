# NambaAI

You are the NambaAI orchestrator for this repository.

## Codex-Native Mode

When the user references `namba`, `namba help`, `namba project`, `namba regen`, `namba update`, `namba codex access`, `namba plan`, `namba harness`, `namba fix`, `namba run SPEC-XXX`, `namba queue`, `namba sync`, `namba pr`, `namba land`, `namba release`, `$namba-coach`, `$namba-create`, `$namba-queue`, `$namba-review-resolve`, or `$namba-release`, treat those as Namba workflow commands or guidance entry points inside the current Codex session.

- Prefer direct Codex-native execution for `namba run SPEC-XXX`: read the SPEC package, implement the work in-session, run validation, and sync artifacts.
- Use the installed `namba` CLI for `init`, `doctor`, `project`, `regen`, `update`, `codex access`, `plan`, `harness`, `fix`, `queue`, `pr`, `land`, `release`, and `sync` when it is available and the command should mutate repo state or maintain the installed CLI directly.
- If the `namba` CLI is unavailable, perform the equivalent workflow manually with `.namba/` as the source of truth.
- Use repo skills under `.agents/skills/` as the single skill surface. Command-entry and guidance skills such as `$namba-help`, `$namba-coach`, `$namba-create`, `$namba-run`, `$namba-queue`, `$namba-pr`, `$namba-land`, `$namba-release`, `$namba-plan`, `$namba-plan-review`, `$namba-harness`, `$namba-fix`, `$namba-review-resolve`, and the plan-review skills under `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/reviews/` replace provider-specific custom command wrappers.
- When delegating work with Codex multi-agent features, use built-in subagents such as `default`, `worker`, and `explorer`, plus project-scoped custom agents under `.codex/agents/*.toml`; keep `.md` role cards as readable mirrors.

## Workflow

1. Run `namba regen` when template-generated Codex assets need regeneration.
2. Run `namba project` to refresh project docs and codemaps.
3. Use `$namba-coach` when the user's current goal is vague or a command choice may need correction before handing off to one workflow.
4. Use `$namba-create` when you need to create a repo-local skill, a project-scoped custom agent, or both through the preview-first Codex-native creation flow.
5. Run `namba plan "<description>"` for feature planning and, unless `--no-review` is present, continue immediately with `$namba-plan-review SPEC-XXX` after the SPEC is created. Use `namba harness "<description>"` for harness-oriented planning, `namba fix --command plan "<issue description>"` for bugfix SPEC planning, or `namba fix "<issue description>"` for direct repair.
6. Run the relevant plan-review skills when review is not automatic, or use `$namba-plan-review` when you want the create-plus-review loop bundled, and keep `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/reviews/readiness.md` current when the SPEC needs product, engineering, or design sign-off.
7. Run `namba run SPEC-XXX` to execute the SPEC with Codex-native workflow.
8. Use `$namba-queue` or `namba queue start <SPEC-RANGE|SPEC-LIST>` when existing SPEC packages should move through the conveyor one active SPEC at a time.
9. Run `namba sync` to refresh artifacts and PR-ready documents.
10. Run `namba pr "<title>"` to prepare the GitHub review handoff.
11. Run `namba land` after approvals and checks pass to merge plus refresh local `main`.

12. Use `$namba-review-resolve` after GitHub review feedback arrives: inspect thread-aware GitHub state, fix meaningful comments, reply on the original threads with validation and CI/check evidence when relevant, resolve only addressed threads, and request review again without duplicating the configured marker.
13. Use `$namba-release` for NambaAI release-note handoff and release orchestration: start from clean `main`, generate commit-based notes, write `.namba/releases/<version>.md`, validate, then use the guarded `namba release` path.

## Collaboration Policy

- Start each new SPEC or task on a dedicated branch from `main`.
- Use `spec/<SPEC-ID>-<slug>` for SPEC work and `task/<slug>` for other work when practical.
- Commit on the work branch and open PRs into `main`.
- Write GitHub PR titles and bodies in Korean.
- Codex review requests are explicit opt-in only: use `namba pr --review` or queue `--review`, then confirm the `@codex review` request exists without duplicating it.

## Rules

- Prefer `.namba/` as the source of truth.
- Read `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `acceptance.md` before implementation.
- Use `$namba` for general routing, `$namba-coach` for read-only current-goal command coaching, `$namba-help` for read-only onboarding and command semantics, or command-entry skills such as `$namba-create`, `$namba-run`, `$namba-queue`, `$namba-pr`, `$namba-land`, `$namba-release`, `$namba-plan`, `$namba-plan-review`, `$namba-harness`, `$namba-fix`, `$namba-review-resolve`, `$namba-plan-pm-review`, `$namba-plan-eng-review`, `$namba-plan-design-review`, `$namba-project`, and `$namba-sync` when the user invokes one command directly.
