# Agent Rules for the evcc optimizer

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Overview

- The optimizer computes cost optimal home energy schedules for evcc: battery charging and discharging, grid import and export, given price, solar, and demand forecasts.
- The core is a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) built with PuLP and solved with CBC, exposed over an HTTP API (Flask plus flask-restx).
- A small Go CLI client (`cmd/`, generated `client/`) calls the API and renders the result as tables and charts.
- Python 3.13 managed with `uv`. Go 1.24.

## Essential Commands

All Python commands run through `uv`. Use `uv run python`, never bare `python`, it is not on PATH.

- `make test` runs the Python test suite (`uv run pytest`)
- `make lint` formats and lints (`autopep8` then `ruff check --fix`)
- `make run` starts the API locally on port 7050 (`uv run python -m optimizer.app`)
- `make build` regenerates the Go client from the OpenAPI spec (`go generate ./...`)
- `make install` syncs dependencies (`uv sync`)
- `make loadtest` runs Locust load tests against a local instance

## Architecture

- `src/optimizer/optimizer.py` builds and solves the MILP. `Optimizer` assembles the variables, objective, and constraints, then `solve()` returns the result dict.
- `src/optimizer/app.py` is the Flask API. It parses the request into the dataclasses (`GridConfig`, `BatteryConfig`, `TimeSeriesData`, `OptimizationStrategy`), runs the optimizer, and marshals the response. The optimization endpoint is `POST /optimize/charge-schedule`.
- `src/optimizer/settings.py` holds runtime settings (solver threads, time limit) via pydantic-settings with the `OPTIMIZER_` env prefix.
- `openapi.yaml` is the source of truth for the API contract.
- `cmd/client.go` is the Go CLI client. `client/client.gen.go` is generated from `openapi.yaml` and must not be edited by hand.
- `tests/` holds the test suite, `test_cases/*.json` hold data driven scenarios.

## Domain Knowledge

The model is a maximization problem. Read these before changing it:

- The objective is maximized. Costs and penalties enter as negative terms, so every penalty coefficient must be strictly positive to actually penalize.
- Energy is in Wh, power limits in W, prices per Wh. Time steps carry individual durations `dt` in seconds, so convert power to energy with `dt / 3600`.
- Penalty coefficients scale from a positive floor, `np.max([max_import_price, 0.1e-3])`. This keeps penalties positive even when market prices are zero or negative.
- Charging and discharging strategies are cost-neutral tie-breakers. They add tiny soft terms (coefficient around `min_import_price * 1e-6`) that only decide between economically equal solutions. They are intentionally excluded from `get_clean_objective_value()`, which recomputes the real economic value without strategy incentives or penalties.
- `get_clean_objective_value()` measures battery value as `(s[T-1] - s[0]) * p_a`, but `s[0]` already includes the first time step's charging, so energy charged in the first step is not counted as a gain. The optimization objective itself uses the absolute final state of charge, `s[-1] * p_a`. Two solutions that are equal in the real objective can therefore report different clean values. Keep optional charging off the first time step when designing cost-neutrality scenarios.
- Grid limits are soft: exceeding `p_max_imp` or `p_max_exp` is penalized rather than forbidden, so an over constrained request reports the violation instead of returning infeasible.

## Python Coding Standards

- Line length is 160 (`ruff` and `autopep8` are configured to match). Run `make lint` before committing.
- ruff rule sets in use: `F`, `I`, `E`, `W`, `PL`. Respect import ordering (`I`).
- Reuse the NumPy helpers already present in the model rather than hand rolling loops.
- Type hint new public functions and dataclass fields.

## API and Code Generation

- Change the API by editing `openapi.yaml` and the matching flask-restx models in `app.py` together, then run `make build` to regenerate the Go client.
- Never edit `client/client.gen.go` by hand. The generator config is `tools/cfg.yaml`, invoked through `tools/generate.go`.

## Testing

- The suite runs with `uv run pytest`.
- `test_cases/*.json` are loaded by `tests/test_app.py`. Each file holds a `request` and an optional `expected_response`, and the test asserts the optimizer status and, with `numpy.isclose`, the objective value. Add a scenario by dropping in a JSON file.
- For behavior the data driven harness cannot assert, such as a specific charge schedule, construct an `Optimizer` directly in a dedicated test module and assert on the returned dict.
- Cover both the success and the limit violation paths.

## Writing Style

- No em dashes in comments, commit messages, or docs. Use periods, commas, or colons.
- Project name is `evcc`, always lowercase.
- Uppercase acronyms in prose: MILP, API, HTTP, JWT, SoC.
- Commit subjects follow conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `infra:`, then a short description with no trailing period. Reference the issue when relevant, for example `fix: use max() for penalty scaling floor (closes #75)`.
