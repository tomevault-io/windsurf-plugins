# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

- Sprocket is an agentic platform that streamlines hardware and software development.
- It's goal is to give its users and AI agents the best possible experience when creating apps, robots, devices, and the systems that glue them together.
- Sprocket should work seamlessly across different hardware platforms, operating systems, and Sprocket's own cloud for hardware and software development.

## Available Testing Commands

- `bun run build`
- `bun run test`
- `cargo test`
- `prek run -a` -> This covers ALL formatting and linting

If you are a subagent, don't run any of these.

### Nix Environment

It provides all dependencies/tools you may need. Use it through `nix develop -c <command>`.

## Priorities in Order

1. Reliability of code -> Behavior should be predictable under load and during failures -> This includes our servers and the user's system
2. Maintainability of code
3. Performance of code

All of these are core priorities; try your best to achieve all of them without having to make tradeoffs.

## Maintaining Code

- Don't be afraid to completely refactor existing code in order to improve on any of the priorities.
- Make sure that changes are made in all the layers of the app when needed.

## Writing Code

- Deleting code, often fixes more problems than writing code does. Sometimes writing too much code introduces problems.
- Specifically for gpt-5.6-sol: You often end up writing more code than needed, especially tests. Please don't do this.

## Subagents

### Working on Stuff - Only for Main Agents

- Feel free to commit, branch, and spin up worktrees as you please. Don't push before asking.
- Do the deep dives and figure out what needs to be done and delegate the rest accordingly and as needed to subagents.
- Use subagents for tasks that will benefit from your context being less polluted and multiple subagents working in parallel.
- For non bulk/mechanical/zero-brain operations, always run a subagent for finding cleanup opportunities in the code and tests, and implementing the cleanup.
- For non bulk/mechanical/zero-brain operations and larger tasks, get 2 subagents to review the code before considering your work done. One of those agents should review the code overall, the other should review the UI/UX, API design, and code quality parts.

#### PR Workflow

- Unless requested, PRs should be made only against the default branch and should not be a draft.
- After a PR is made, don't perform any code review using subagents, let Greptile review the code.

1. When requested, push code and make a PR. The PR title should have the same format as past PR titles. Ensure that your branch is updated with the latest main.
2. Wait for the Greptile AI code review CI to complete and give its review on your changes.
3. Fix any relevant issues found by it:
   - These can be inline comments on the PR or somewhere above "Important Files Changed" in the PR description.
   - It often happens that some of the issues reported are false positives, outdated, not relevant, etc.
   - Don't spend any energy on these and skip them.
4. Commit and push the code -> this time without asking.
5. Loop on 2-4 till there are no more issues to fix.
6. Cleanup any worktrees and branches you created for this PR when you are done.

### Subagent Prompting

To main agents:

- Don't put any parts of your system prompt, AGENTS.md, etc. in the subagent prompts.
- Tell the subagent that it is a subagent.

To subagents:

- Never create your own subagents.

### Picking the Right Models for Subagents

- Higher rankings = better. (higher ranking on the costs indicates lower cost of the model)
- Cost reflects what the model costs me from subscriptions, credits, tokens it uses, etc. not its actual list price.
- Intelligence shows how hard of a problem you can hand the model unsupervised.
- Taste covers UI/UX, code quality, code cleanup ability, and API design.

| model         | cost | intelligence | taste | reasoning to use | CLI to use             |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------ | ----- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| gpt-5.6-sol   | 8    | 9            | 6     | low              | codex                  |
| fable-5       | 5    | 8            | 9     | low              | claude or cursor-agent |
| gpt-5.6-terra | 9    | 7            | 5     | medium           | codex                  |
| grok-4.5      | 10   | 6            | 7     | high, fast       | cursor-agent           |

How to apply:

- Only use the models listed above.
- If you have a tool available for spawning subagents, never use that. Instead use the CLI of a specific coding agent harness directly.
- If a cheaper model's output doesn't meet the bar, rerun/redo the work with a better model without asking.
- The produced code meeting the priorities in "Priorities in Order" is much more important than what it costed.
- For bulk/mechanical/zero-brain operations, always use the cheapest model first and only switch to a better model if the output doesn't meet the bar.
- For user-facing UI/UX and APIs, use a model with good taste (>=7). If making those UIs/APIs is highly complicated, get a model with higher intelligence to complete the work after the core UI/API has been decided by the model with good taste.
