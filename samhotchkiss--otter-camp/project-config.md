# OtterCamp — Claude Code Instructions

## Ralph Loop Rules (MANDATORY)

When running a Ralph Loop (the `/ralph-loop` skill or any end-to-end platform test):

### BEFORE EVERY ACTION, check these rules:

1. **ALL interaction with OtterCamp MUST happen via the TUI.** Use `tmux send-keys -t oc-test` for everything. NEVER use:
   - `curl` to hit the API directly
   - `psql` to query or modify the database
   - Direct CLI commands against the OtterCamp binary
   - Any other backdoor that bypasses the TUI

2. **File issues for Codex.** Do NOT fix bugs directly (unless truly ≤2 lines). Write an issue file in `issues/01-ready/` and let the Codex pipeline handle it. The whole point of the Ralph Loop is to test the platform as a user would experience it.

3. **Push every commit.** If you do make a code change, push it immediately.

4. **You are the human operator, not a developer.** Your job is to:
   - Send messages to agents via the TUI chat
   - Approve/reject staffing decisions
   - Review inbox items
   - Make judgment calls
   - Log decisions to `decisions.md`

5. **Don't tell agents HOW to do things.** Let them figure it out. Guide with WHAT, not HOW.

6. **Never modify the database directly.** No SQL updates, no job queue manipulation, no model profile switches. If something is broken, file an issue.

7. **Never switch model providers without Sam's approval.** The model profiles are set deliberately.

### CONTEXT COMPACTION RULE

**If you are in a Ralph Loop and your context has been compacted, you MUST re-read the loop instruction file before taking any action.** The loop instructions are stored at:
- The ralph-loop skill definition (invoke `/ralph-loop:help` if unsure)
- `decisions.md` in the repo root for decisions already made
- `.claude/plans/` for the current plan

Context compaction is the #1 cause of rule violations. When you lose context, you lose the rules. RE-READ THEM.

### What to do when blocked

When you hit a blocker (API credits exhausted, bugs, etc.):
1. **STOP.** Do not work around it.
2. **Tell Sam.** Describe the blocker clearly.
3. **File an issue** if it's a code bug.
4. **Wait** for Sam's guidance or for the issue to be fixed.

Do NOT: switch providers, dead-letter jobs, send API calls directly, modify the DB, or take any other shortcut. These shortcuts corrupt the test and invalidate the entire loop.

## General Development

- Build: `go build -o bin/ottercamp ./cmd/ottercamp`
- Branch: `main` is the active development branch
- Tests: `go test ./...`

## Root Cause Rule

When a failure repeats or survives more than one narrow fix, stop patching the nearest symptom.

Required behavior:
1. Define the invariant that should hold.
2. Identify the state transition or contract that violates that invariant.
3. Add or update deterministic coverage for the underlying failure mode.
4. Fix the underlying state-machine / contract bug.
5. Only then rerun the end-to-end scenario.

Do not keep stacking one-off symptom fixes when the same failure family keeps resurfacing under a new shape.
