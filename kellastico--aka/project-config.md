# AKA — Root CLAUDE.md

## What This Project Is

AKA is a local-first, task-driven desktop application for LLM-powered coding agents.
Built with Tauri v2 (Rust backend) + React + TypeScript (frontend).

AKA is fully agnostic — users bring any LLM backend (Ollama, MLX, oMLX, LM Studio,
any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) and any agent (Aider, OpenCode, Hermes, OpenClaw,
LangChain, custom scripts). AKA orchestrates them; it never prescribes them.

The app is task-first: describe what you want built, pick your model + agent, launch,
review the diff, approve or reject. Not a chat interface — a work dispatch tool.

## Core Principle: Full Agnosticism

AKA never hardcodes a model, provider, or agent. Every integration is:
- Configured by the user via the Provider Manager or Agent Runner
- Stored as a user-defined record (name, command/URL, args)
- Treated identically at runtime regardless of type

AKA's job is orchestration and UX — not opinion about which LLM or agent is best.

## Project Conventions

### Structure
- Each feature lives under `src/features/<NN-feature-name>/`
- Every feature has its own `Context.md`
- `Context.md` = current state, decisions made, open questions

### Naming
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Hooks: `use-kebab-case.ts`
- Stores: `use-feature-store.ts` (Zustand)
- Tauri commands: `snake_case` in Rust, camelCase wrapper in `src/lib/tauri/commands.ts`

### IPC Pattern
All Tauri `invoke()` calls go through `src/lib/tauri/commands.ts`.
Never call `invoke()` directly from components.

### Streaming
Agent output streams via Tauri events, not command return values.
```ts
listen<AgentChunk>('agent:chunk', (event) => {
  appendChunk(event.payload)
})
```

### State
- One Zustand store per feature at `src/features/<feature>/use-<feature>-store.ts`
- Cross-feature state in `src/stores/`

---

## Rust Backend Rules
- Commands in `src-tauri/src/commands/` — one file per feature domain
- Use `tokio::process::Command` for spawning agent/model subprocesses
- Stream stdout/stderr back via `app_handle.emit()`
- Persist config via `tauri-plugin-store`
- Never block the main thread — everything async

---

## What NOT to Do
- Do not embed or bundle any LLM — AKA orchestrates local models, never bundles one
- Do not build a full code editor — file editing is the agent's job; AKA shows diffs
  - **Markdown exception:** `.md` / `.mdx` / `.markdown` files in a pane are
    user-editable (plain textarea via `MarkdownPane`). The agent may also
    rewrite the same file on disk via its own tools; the pane watches the
    file (`file://changed` events from `commands::files::watch_file`) and
    surfaces a conflict banner (Reload / Keep mine / View diff) when both
    sides changed. All other file types stay read-only in panes.
- Do not hardcode any agent or model type — everything is pluggable
- Do not use `localStorage` — use Tauri's store plugin for persistence
- Do not make API calls from the frontend directly — route through Tauri commands
