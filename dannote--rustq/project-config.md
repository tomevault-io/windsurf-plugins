# Agent Guidelines for RustQ

## Canonical RustQ dogfooding doctrine

Before changing Rust generation in RustQ or downstream projects, read and follow:

- [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) — agent-facing RustQ skill for consumers, ports, generators, and dogfooding
- [`guides/using-rustq-well.md`](guides/using-rustq-well.md) — HexDocs guide for the same doctrine

The short version: RustQ exists to make Elixir↔Rust bridge generation readable,
maintainable, and beautiful. Prefer valid Elixir, `defrust`, ordinary Elixir
macros, RustQ AST, and structural metadata over raw Rust strings.

## Rusty Elixir / AST-first discipline

When adding or changing Rust generation in this repository, always try to express the work through RustQ itself before falling back to raw Rust strings.

Preferred order:

1. **Use valid Elixir + `defrust` when possible**
   - Prefer ordinary Elixir syntax, pattern matching, calls, normal Elixir macros, recursion, and `@spec`/`@type` driven lowering.
   - Treat Rusty-Elixir as a functional Elixir-shaped surface. For repeated or counted work, prefer recursive helper functions, pattern matching, and accumulator-style APIs over imperative loops.
   - `loop`, `break`, and `continue` are RustQ internal IR / low-level Rust implementation details, not the preferred user-facing or downstream-generator authoring style. Do not introduce them into product generator code just because Rust has loops; first model the logic with valid Elixir recursion or higher-level RustQ constructs.
   - Use ordinary external remote types in specs for Rust paths where possible (for example `GeneratedOpts.OvalOpts.t(R.lifetime(:a))` -> `generated_opts::OvalOpts<'a>`); keep `R.path` as a low-level escape hatch.
   - Do not introduce fake Rust syntax into Elixir.

2. **Use `RustQ.Rust.AST.Builder` for generated Rust structure**
   - Prefer helpers like `A.block`, `A.match`, `A.arm`, `A.if_expr`, `A.call`, `A.method`, `A.path`, `A.const`, `A.module`, etc.
   - Generated functions, dispatch tables, structs, modules, constants, and helper bodies should be AST-backed whenever possible.

3. **Add missing AST nodes/helpers instead of writing Rust strings**
   - If generation needs a Rust construct that RustQ cannot represent yet, first consider adding an AST node and native decoder/rendering support.
   - Keep growing the AST vocabulary rather than accumulating ad hoc string templates.

4. **Use semantic Rusty-Elixir helpers before raw strings**
   - Compose repeated Rusty-Elixir bodies with ordinary Elixir `defmacro`, helper functions returning quoted Rusty-Elixir, `quote`, `unquote`, and `unquote_splicing`; do not invent RustQ-specific quoting or DSL forms unless normal Elixir metaprogramming is demonstrably insufficient.
   - Before adding any new RustQ syntax, lowering clause, pseudo-form, or macro-template construct, stop and try ordinary Elixir generation first. The maintainer burden is to make valid Elixir produce RustQ, not to grow a parallel language because quote/unquote was overlooked.
   - `expr!(...)` lowers valid Rusty-Elixir values such as `:ok` and `{:ok, value}` to a `syn::Expr`.
   - `Super.foo(...)` in `defrust` intentionally lowers to a Rust parent-module call such as `super::foo(...)`.
   - `Atoms.fill()`-style plural aliases automatically lower to snake-case Rust modules such as `atoms::fill()`; do not add fake `defrustmod` declarations for externally-owned modules.
   - `raw_expr!(...)`, `raw_pat!(...)`, `raw_stmt!(...)`, and `raw_arm!(...)` are explicit Rust token escape hatches that lower through parser helpers.

5. **Use raw Rust strings only as isolated escape hatches**
   - Acceptable examples: `AST.MacroItem` for macro invocations such as `rustler::atoms!`.
   - If a string fallback is used, keep it local and treat it as a candidate for future AST support.

6. **Use structural sources of truth**
   - For RustQ-owned Elixir/Rust AST schemas, prefer `defstruct`, `@type t`, and RustQ AST schema introspection over parallel hand-written schema maps.
   - For external Rust crates, prefer `RustQ.Syn` metadata from original Rust source over duplicate Elixir typespec declarations or regex/source-text parsing.
   - Avoid duplicating field/type/category metadata unless there is no better source.

7. **Self-hosting invariants**
   - Do not introduce trivial Rust wrapper functions for semantic forms already written in `defrust`.
   - Do not add parallel constructor registries or data tables for `expr!`, `pat!`, `stmt!`, or `arm!` shapes.
   - Extend `RustQ.Meta.Lower` and existing RustQ AST nodes before adding new primitive Rust helpers.
   - Funnel token-only semantic escapes through generic primitives such as `parse_syn::<T>(quote!(...))` rather than one helper per shape.
   - Every new `RustQ.Rust.AST.Schema` node must get behavioral native rendering coverage.

8. **Architecture enforcement belongs in architecture tooling**
   - Do not add bespoke ExUnit "architecture tests" that grep source files or enforce policy with ad hoc string checks. That is the most stupid way to enforce architecture in this project.
   - Use real architecture/linting tools such as Reach/ExDNA/Credo/custom lint rules, or encode invariants in schema-driven behavioral tests that prove actual functionality.
