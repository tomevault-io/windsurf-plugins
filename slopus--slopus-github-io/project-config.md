# Writing Guidelines for Content Contributors

## Reading Level Requirements

All `.mdx` files in the ./content/ directory should target a **10th grade reading level**. This means using simple, clear language that's accessible to most readers while maintaining the depth and accuracy of information.

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity Without Sacrificing Depth

We don't want to "dumb down" content or skip over important nuance. Instead, we want to include ALL the information that someone reading at a post-graduate level would expect to find, but present it using:

- Simple vocabulary (avoid rare or overly technical words when common alternatives exist)
- Clear sentence structures (shorter sentences, active voice when possible)
- Plain English explanations of complex concepts
- Step-by-step breakdowns of complicated processes

### 2. Complete Information Coverage

Every reader should be able to find the detailed information and answers they're looking for, regardless of their background knowledge. This means:

- Including comprehensive explanations
- Providing context for technical concepts
- Adding examples and analogies when helpful
- Covering edge cases and important details

## Writing Process and File Organization

### Draft Files: `*.notes.txt`

When preparing content for an `.mdx` file, start by creating a corresponding `*.notes.txt` file (e.g., `how-it-works.notes.txt`). This file should contain:

- **All detailed information** you want to include
- Technical explanations in their natural form
- Complex concepts before simplification
- Research notes and references
- **No reading level restrictions** - write as technically as needed

### Communication Files: `*.talk.txt`

Create `*.talk.txt` files to communicate with other contributors about:

- The goals and purpose of each page
- Target audience considerations
- Key concepts that must be covered
- Specific communication objectives
- **No reading level restrictions** - use whatever language is clearest for collaboration

### Final Content: `*.mdx`

The final `.mdx` files should be the 10th-grade reading level versions that transform your detailed notes into accessible content.

## File Extensions and Nextra

- `.mdx` files → Processed by Nextra and displayed on the website
- `.notes.txt` files → Ignored by Nextra, treated as Markdown in VS Code
- `.talk.txt` files → Ignored by Nextra, treated as Markdown in VS Code

This setup lets you keep all your detailed work alongside the final content without cluttering the published documentation.

## Why Simple Language for Technical Audiences?

You might be thinking: *"This is a highly technical product only meant for software engineers. Why can't I expect them to be fully versed in all the jargon and terminology I know? Why can't we raise the bar a little?"*

Here's why simple language is better, even for technical audiences:

**Just because you CAN use complicated language doesn't mean you SHOULD.**

Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize-winning physicist, put it perfectly:

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."

## The Real Benefits of Simple Language

When you truly understand something, you should be able to:

- **Be direct** - Get to the point without unnecessary complexity
- **Paint a clear picture** - Help readers visualize concepts immediately  
- **Eliminate confusion** - Prevent readers from having to reread sections
- **Reduce cognitive load** - Let readers focus on the concepts, not decoding your language

Even brilliant developers appreciate clear explanations. Complex jargon often
just gets in the way of communication.

## Practical Tips

### Instead of rare words, use common ones:
- "utilize" → "use"
- "implement" → "set up" or "put in place"
- "subsequently" → "then" or "after that"
- "facilitate" → "help" or "make easier"

### Break up complex sentences:
- **Complex**: "The implementation of this feature, which requires careful consideration of multiple interdependent factors, can significantly enhance user experience."
- **Simple**: "This feature can greatly improve user experience. Setting it up requires thinking about several connected factors."

### Use active voice when possible:
- **Passive**: "The configuration should be modified by the administrator."
- **Active**: "The administrator should modify the configuration."

### Add context for technical terms:
- **Technical**: "Configure the API endpoint."
- **With context**: "Configure the API endpoint (the web address where your app sends requests)."

## Quality Check

Before finalizing any `.mdx` content, ask yourself:

1. Would a high school sophomore understand this explanation?
2. Have I included all the important details an expert would need?
3. Are there any unnecessarily complex words I could replace?
4. Do my examples help clarify the concepts?
5. Would Richard Feynman approve of this explanation?

Remember: Our goal is to make complex information accessible to everyone, not to make it simplistic.
