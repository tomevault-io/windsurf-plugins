# Agentsmith tsx contributing rules for cursor AI

1. Only use named exports (`export const thing`, not `export default`)¹
2. All pages should have a single top level page component in page-components
3. All components should be in components folder either as a single file named after the component or in a subfolder named after the component¹
4. All functions should be declared in const rocket format: `const rocket = async (payload: any) => { ... }`¹
5. All props should be explicitly typed as `type ComponentProps = { ... }` and not typed inline ex: `props: { foo: any }` is bad `props: ComponentProps` is good. DO NOT deconstruct props, if a component has props, it should be named as `props` and deconstructed in the body of the component. Write `const foo = (props: FooProps) => { const { arg, arg2 } = props; }` rather than `const foo = ({ arg, arg2 }: FooProps) => {}`
6. Only use icons from `lucide-react`
7. Only use tailwind css
8. Each component file should have at most 2 react components, any more than that and it should be split up into multiple component files/folders.
9. Any links to pages that exist under the web-studio should be prefixed with /app
10. All functions that take more than 1 argument, should use an `options` syntax instead of adding many arguments. i.e. `const foo = (options: FooOptions) => {}` rather than `const foo = (bar: string, baz: string, quux: string) => {}`
11. If the response for a function is an object, then it should be typed separately rather than inline. i.e. `const foo = (): FooResult => {}` instead of `const foo = (): { foo: string; bar: string; baz: string } => {}` 
12. DO NOT edit any generated files within the `__generated__` folder.
13. DO NOT create new types if they can be inferred from the supabase generated types OR can be inferred from the return of a supabase.from call using `Awaited<ReturnType><>`


¹ Exception for the Nextjs page.tsx files. They should only have one default function export.
