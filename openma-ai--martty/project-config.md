# Agent notes

Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md) before changing UI, the runner, or plugin loading. The migration sequence and phase 1 demo live in [docs/migration.md](docs/migration.md).

- The ACP client is a Cordis plugin providing `ctx.acpClient`. It is either the client composition root or an `insert` in another client tree. It attaches to an ACP agent by spawn (`dsh-acp` / `dsh --profile acp` / other) or `config.stream`. It does not import a harness.
- Do not sync plugin ids, `inject`, or fibers. Server plugins surface through ACP; client plugins stay on the client tree. Both sides negotiate protocol 0 through `initialize` `_meta.dsh.cordis`; only then may they use `_dsh/cordis/*` Extension Requests/Notifications. TUI painter methods are the `_dsh/cordis/tui/*` child domain. This is serialized capability projection, not plugin-tree sync.
- The primary profile path has two processes: the dsh Host tree mounts Base + the ACP plugin, then its runner starts a separate TUI Client process. ACP uses that Client process's stdin/stdout. The Client process receives the user TTY on fd 3/4 and maps it to the Rust painter; those descriptors never carry Host↔Client ACP. Standalone `dsh-tui` may instead spawn any ACP agent on standard pipes.
- Third-party packs are sibling `insert` rows plus `inject = ['tuiTheme']`. Do not nest them with `ctx.plugin` inside the runner.
- TUI npm may depend on `@deepseek-ai/cordis` only among `@deepseek-ai/*`; do not depend directly on `dsh-*`. It deliberately carries `@openma/deepseek-harness-acp` as a runtime dependency and exports its own Creator overlay. The TUI bundle mounts both Host plugins on the Base tree; neither enters the separate Client tree.
- The `tui-theme` service catalog starts with builtin `default`. Palette packs are sibling `insert` rows that `register` into the catalog (like agent presets). `/theme` and `tuiTheme.activate` switch which pack covers. `--demo-skin` is the only shipped path that selects gallery `ember`.
- The first shell slot proof is `chrome.right`: plugins inject `tuiSlots` and
  contribute validated `TuiNode` trees. Conversation timeline slots remain later work.
- Do not give plugins the TTY, kitty, raw mode, or global terminal size.
- Transcript paint comes from ACP `session/update`. Do not drive chrome or palette from `session/update`. Do not put TUI chrome in ACP `_meta`.
- ACP auth follows Backchat: read `initialize.authMethods`, submit in-app forms through `authenticate` `_meta`, run Terminal Auth (`_meta["terminal-auth"]`) on the TTY, then `authenticate` to re-check. `/login` stays the agent's slash when advertised. `dsh-tui --demo` stays on built-in `default`. Phase 1 demo is `--demo-skin` (`ember`).
- Token names, kinds, and slot names are append-only; field meaning changes bump `protocol`.
