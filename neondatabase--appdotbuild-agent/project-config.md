- Create separate components when logic exceeds 100 lines or has distinct responsibility
- Use single responsibility principle for each component
- File structure: shared UI in `components/ui/`, features in `components/FeatureName.tsx`
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Export components as default exports for consistency
