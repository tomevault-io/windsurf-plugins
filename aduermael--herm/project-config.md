description: Spawn a sub-agent to handle a complex subtask
---


Runs inside the dev container. Spawn a sub-agent with its own context window. Each sub-agent has startup cost (system prompt tokens + LLM call latency), so only use when the benefit outweighs that overhead.

**Modes — you must specify one:**
- `"explore"` — uses a fast, cheap model. For research, search, reading code, investigating issues, gathering information.
- `"general"` — uses the full orchestrator model. For writing code, making edits, running build/test cycles, executing changes.

**When to use:**
- Tasks requiring deep exploration across many files (10+ tool calls) -> `explore`
- Self-contained implementation work that would produce verbose output -> `general`
- Running multiple independent investigations in parallel (spawn several sub-agents) -> `explore`

When spawning multiple general-mode sub-agents, ensure they work on separate files — parallel edits to the same file will conflict. Partition work by file or directory.

**When NOT to use — act directly instead:**
- A single grep, glob, or file read
- A small edit (even edit -> test -> fix cycles)
- Running one command and interpreting the output
- Any task completable in ~5 or fewer tool calls

**Background mode** (`background: true`):
- The sub-agent runs asynchronously. You get an agent_id immediately and can continue working.
- When the background agent completes, its result is automatically injected into your next LLM context — you will see a "[Background agent completed]" notification.
- Use for long-running explorations or parallel independent tasks where you don't need the result right away.
- Check status anytime: `agent(agent_id: "<id>", task: "status")` — returns "running" or "completed" with the full result.
- Cannot be combined with agent_id (no background resume).

**Usage:**
- Provide a clear, self-contained task description — the sub-agent has the same tools you do but no shared memory.
- Resume a previous sub-agent by passing its agent_id with a new task — this continues from where it left off with full context preserved.

**Reading results:**
- Results have a compact header: `[agent:<id> turns:<N/M> summary:<method>]` followed by an `[output: <path>]` pointer to the full output file.
- `summary:model` — structured summary (STATUS/FILES/FINDINGS/NEXT); usually sufficient to act on.
- `summary:truncated` — naive truncation; read the full output file via `read_file` for complete findings.
- `[errors: ...]` — sub-agent hit errors; review and consider retrying with a narrower task.
- Turns count LLM response cycles, not individual tool calls (one response with 5 tool calls = 1 turn). N=M means the sub-agent hit its turn limit and may have incomplete results.
- Full output is saved to `.herm/agents/<agent_id>.md`. If you need exact file paths, line numbers, code snippets, or error details not in the summary, read the full output with `read_file`.

**Turn budget:** Explore mode gets __EXPLORE_MAX_TURNS__ turns, general mode gets __GENERAL_MAX_TURNS__ turns. Scope explore tasks to fit within ~75% of the budget + a few turns for synthesis. If a task requires more depth, consider splitting it into multiple focused sub-agents rather than one broad one.
