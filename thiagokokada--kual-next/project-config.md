# AGENTS.md

## Project intent

KUAL Next is a native launcher for existing KUAL JSON extensions on recent
jailbroken Kindles. Target hard-float firmware 5.16.3 and newer. Java,
Kindlets, Booklets, pre-hard-float devices, non-JSON menus, and KUAL's legacy
mailbox/cache protocol are intentionally out of scope.

Keep compatibility with the original KUAL JSON behavior where it is relevant
to modern extensions. Use small C libraries and avoid adding a large UI or JSON
framework.

## Repository layout and dependencies

- `src/` contains menu parsing, condition evaluation, command execution, and
  the FBInk/evdev UI.
- `include/kual.h` contains shared project types and interfaces.
- `tests/fixtures/` contains representative KUAL extensions.
- `assets/` contains the SH Integration scriptlet and bundled Noto fonts.
- `scripts/deploy-kindle.sh` performs checked SSH package deployments for the
  `make deploy` target; it must not contain a default device hostname.
- `third_party/FBInk` is a pinned recursive Git submodule. Do not replace it
  with a path outside this repository or modify its upstream sources as part
  of normal project work.
- `third_party/jsmn.h` is the vendored JSON parser.
- `third_party/yxml.c` and `third_party/yxml.h` are the vendored XML parser.

Initialize dependencies after cloning:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Build and verification

This is a NixOS development environment. Enter the pinned shell before
building:

```sh
nix develop
make test
```

The one-time Kindle toolchain setup downloads the checksum-verified prebuilt
koxtoolchain release:

```sh
nix develop
make toolchain
```

Before handing off a Kindle-facing change, run:

```sh
nix develop
make package
```

This runs parser tests, bundled-font coverage tests, the ARM hard-float ABI
check, and the static-link check. The resulting archive is written under
`dist/`. Build products, toolchains, caches, and packages are generated files
and must not be committed.

`make test` also builds and runs the host unit suite with AddressSanitizer,
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, and leak detection enabled. To run only the
sanitizer suite:

```sh
nix develop
make sanitize
```

Treat any sanitizer report as a failed verification.

The root `VERSION` file is the single version source for both the compiled UI
and package filename. Change it for releases; do not add another version macro.

After changing first-party C sources or headers, run `clang-format -i` on each
changed file from inside `nix develop`, then verify those files with
`clang-format --dry-run --Werror`. Do not reformat vendored sources under
`third_party/`.

Format maintained shell scripts with `make shell-format`. Verify them with
`make shell-format-check shellcheck`; both checks are also part of `make test`.

## Implementation constraints

- Write portable C11 and keep the existing warning-clean build flags.
- Continue using FBInk for drawing and Linux evdev for input.
- Keep the device binary statically linked unless a separate design decision
  explicitly changes that constraint.
- Use the bundled Noto fonts. Never load fonts or resources from the Kindle's
  Java installation.
- Preserve KUAL semantics for `exitmenu`, `checked`, `refresh`, `status`,
  `date`, conditions, nested items, and working directories.
- Keep runtime checked state separate from the configured entry name.
- Render KUAL UI indicators with the bundled Noto Symbols fonts; update
  `tests/check-fonts.sh` when introducing another built-in symbol.
- Keep screen geometry and touch hitboxes derived from the same dimensions.

## Kindle framework policy

The Amazon Home/framework may repaint over direct framebuffer content. While
its UI is visible, KUAL Next stops the separate Upstart `statusbar` service,
hard-disables Pillow, and sends `SIGSTOP` to the Awesome window manager. It
must track which components it changed, temporarily restore them while the
stock screen saver is active, and permanently restore them before launching an
`exitmenu` action and on every exit path. Keep the scriptlet supervisor
fallback so a launcher crash also restores the framework.

The on-device recovery commands are `/usr/bin/killall -CONT awesome`,
`lipc-set-prop com.lab126.pillow disableEnablePillow enable`, and
`/sbin/start statusbar`. Do not stop `KPPMainApp` or `lab126_gui`, and do not
restore saved framebuffer dumps. Continue listening for Kindle screen-saver
events, releasing input grabs while locked, and issuing a deferred full redraw
after unlock.

An Awesome-managed X11 ownership window was tested and rejected because it did
not reliably prevent framework repaint artifacts. Do not reintroduce an X11
ownership window or broader framework lifecycle management without a new user
decision and an on-device recovery plan.

## Packaging and commits

The package must continue to install these public paths:

- `/mnt/us/documents/KUAL Next.sh`
- `/mnt/us/kual-next/bin/kual-next`
- `/mnt/us/kual-next/fonts/`
- `/mnt/us/kual-next/LICENSES/`

Keep unrelated changes out of commits. When a request contains independent
structural, behavior, and visual fixes, create separate verified commits for
each concern. Preserve existing user changes and never rewrite or reset history
unless explicitly requested.
