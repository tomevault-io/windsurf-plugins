# Instructions for AI coding agents consuming NREKI via MCP (Codex, Gemini, others)

## 0. ZERO-CHATTER
- Call tools immediately. No "I will now..." or "Let me...".
- State changes in one line. No ASCII tables, no summaries.
- Output tokens cost 5x input. Optimize every syllable.

## 1. NAVIGATION & READING
- NEVER use Explore, Bash `grep`/`rg`/`cat`, or native `Read File`.
- EXACT SEARCH: ALWAYS use `nreki_navigate action:"fast_grep"`. Returns 3D AST topological coordinates (File + Symbol + Line) via SQLite index, orders of magnitude faster than bash grep.
- SEMANTIC SEARCH: Use `nreki_navigate action:"search"` for concept-based queries.
- BATCH READING: NEVER read functions one by one. Use ONE call with comma-separated targets: `nreki_code action:"compress" focus:"func1, func2, func3"`.
- LARGE FILES: `nreki_navigate action:"outline"` auto-expands HIGH-risk methods up to 6,000 token budget.
  - **CRITICAL:** If outline says `[BUDGET LIMIT REACHED]`, you MUST use `compress focus:"<omitted_symbols>"` to read the hidden logic before editing. Do not guess.
  - Pay attention to `⚠️` (Defect flags) and `👻 [0 ext refs]` (Orphan/safe-to-delete) markers.
- Small files: `nreki_code action:"read"`.

## 2. SURGICAL EDITING & ACID BATCHES
- NEVER use native Write/Replace on existing files (bypasses AST validation).
- NEVER edit sequentially. Read ALL targets first, then batch ALL fixes in ONE `nreki_code action:"batch_edit"` call.
- **80L GUILLOTINE:** NREKI mathematically rejects any single payload (`new_code` or `replace_text`) >80 lines. You MUST decompose large rewrites.
- **PATCH MODE (MANDATORY):** If the original symbol is >40 lines, `mode:"replace"` is BLOCKED. You MUST use `mode:"patch"` with `search_text` and `replace_text`.
  - *Tolerant Match:* `search_text` indentation is fuzzy. Focus on unique logical content. Do not worry about exact leading spaces.
  - *Multi-Patching:* To bypass the 80L limit, send MULTIPLE `patch` edits to the SAME symbol sequentially in one `batch_edit`.
  - *ACID Rule:* When multi-patching a symbol, EVERY `search_text` must match the ORIGINAL unaltered source code. Do not target code injected by previous patches.
- **ANTI-SWEEP SHIELD:** NEVER use `// eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, or `# noqa`. NREKI will block your edit. Fix the structural flaw.
- **RENAMING:** Run `nreki_navigate action:"prepare_refactor"` first.

## 3. BLAST RADIUS & TTRD (TYPE DISCIPLINE)
- **CASCADES:** Fix all downstream dependents in the SAME `batch_edit` when changing signatures.
- **TTRD SHIELD:** NEVER downgrade strict types to `any` or `unknown` to appease the compiler. NREKI catches type degradation in RAM and penalizes the file's Cognitive Friction Index (CFI).
- **BOUNTIES:** If you see `[UNPAID TYPE DEBT]` warnings, restore the original strict types to earn a CFI reduction reward.
- **AUTO-HEALER:** NREKI may auto-inject missing imports in RAM. Do not revert them.

## 4. CONTEXT SURVIVAL & MEMORY
- **Anchor plans:** `nreki_guard action:"set_plan" text:"PLAN.md"`.
- **Scratchpad:** `nreki_guard action:"memorize" text:"<notes>"`.
- **Engrams:** Use `nreki_guard action:"engram" path:"..." symbol:"..." text:"ASSERT: <rule>"` to pin architectural invariants to an AST node. The `ASSERT` prefix makes it immortal across code mutations.

## 5. ALERTS & VERIFICATION
- NEVER run `tsc`, `eslint`, or `npm install` to verify edits. NREKI mathematically validates every edit via TypeScript Compiler and LSP sidecars (Go/Python) in RAM BEFORE disk write.
- If `nreki_code` returns `[OK]`, the edit is guaranteed valid. Trust it. Move on.
- If NREKI returns an error, read the structured output and fix it using NREKI tools. Do not drop to the bash terminal.
- Terminal output: `nreki_code action:"filter_output"`.
- Circuit breaker: If you see `BREAK & BUILD` or `DECOMPOSE`, STOP. Read the strategy and rethink.
