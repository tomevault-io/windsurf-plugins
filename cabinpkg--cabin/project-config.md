# AGENTS.md

Cabin is a pre-1.0, Cargo-inspired (not Cargo-compatible) package manager and
build system for C/C++, implemented in Rust. Reuse Cargo vocabulary only
where the C/C++ semantics really line up. `docs/architecture.md` is the
canonical architecture and scope document (crate ownership, boundaries, data
flow, scope exclusions); if it disagrees with this file, update both in the
same change and treat the architecture doc as authoritative.

## Repository Layout

- `crates/` - Rust workspace crates. Read `crates/AGENTS.md` before changing
  anything under it.
- `crates/cabin/` - the `cabin` binary. Read `crates/cabin/AGENTS.md` before
  changing CLI code.
- `docs/` - canonical Markdown docs, rendered by the website. Per-page
  summaries are in the "Repository shape today" section of
  `docs/architecture.md`.
- `website/` - Astro site for `cabinpkg.com`; also renders `docs/`. Read
  `website/AGENTS.md` before changing website code or docs rendering.
- `examples/` - runnable Cabin packages covered by CLI integration tests.
- `RELEASING.md` - maintainer release procedure. Do not infer release rules
  from CI alone, and do not change cargo-dist, binstall, publish, or release
  workflow behavior as part of unrelated work.

## Checks

- `bash scripts/ci.sh` runs the CI gate locally, scoping expensive checks to
  the surfaces changed relative to `origin/main`. Agent stop hooks run
  `scripts/ci.sh --hook`, which blocks one attempt to stop while the gate is
  red; a second stop is let through with a warning (`stop_hook_active`).
- The exact per-command shapes are in `CONTRIBUTING.md` "Required checks".
  Mirror the flags verbatim: `--all-features`, `--locked`,
  `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`, and clippy's
  trailing `-- -D warnings` are intentional.
- Changes under `docs/` or `website/` require, from `website/`:
  `yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn lint && yarn build` (build runs
  typecheck, Astro build, CSP checks, and docs-link checks). For docs-only
  changes, run only the checks matching the touched surface.
- Commit subjects follow Conventional Commits, lower-case, at or under 100
  characters (commitlint runs in CI).
- Do not edit `typos.toml` or add allowlist entries unless a reviewer
  explicitly asks. Fix the spelling instead.

## Engineering Principles

Apply these pragmatically, not mechanically. When they conflict, prioritize
correctness, readability, simplicity, and ease of change over theoretical
purity. Make the smallest coherent change that solves the current problem,
and do not add speculative flexibility.

- Keep the implementation simple and focused: KISS and YAGNI.
- Avoid duplicating the same knowledge or business rule: DRY.
- Do not introduce abstractions prematurely: follow AHA and the Rule of
  Three.
- Separate distinct concerns and keep each component responsible for one
  coherent purpose. Prefer high cohesion and low coupling.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Keep APIs and behavior unsurprising: follow the Principle of Least
  Astonishment.
- Limit dependencies on internal object structure: follow the Law of
  Demeter.
- Validate assumptions early and fail fast with clear errors.
- Use types and data structures that make invalid states unrepresentable
  where practical.
- Prefer explicit behavior, dependencies, and configuration over hidden or
  implicit mechanisms.
- Apply SOLID principles where they improve clarity, substitutability, and
  maintainability, but avoid unnecessary indirection.
- If an external library can solve the same problem, use it, but weigh the
  full cost first.

## Working Rules

- State assumptions before coding when the request is ambiguous. Ask instead
  of silently picking between incompatible interpretations.
- Make surgical changes: no refactoring adjacent code, reformatting
  unrelated files, or removing pre-existing dead code unless asked. Prefer
  simple, direct Rust and existing local patterns; add abstractions only when
  they remove real duplication or match an established boundary.
- Comments explain constraints and rationale, not mechanics: non-obvious
  invariants, compatibility requirements, workarounds, external constraints,
  or why an obvious alternative is incorrect. Do not write comments that
  restate what the code does. Before keeping or adding a comment, first
  consider whether clearer naming, extracting a function, introducing a
  type, or restructuring would make it unnecessary.
- Business logic belongs in the owning crate; `crates/cabin` parses flags,
  calls typed APIs, and renders results. Boundary or scope questions:
  `docs/architecture.md` ("Scope and limitations" lists what is deliberately
  deferred - do not implement deferred features).
- Do not implement "not implemented" features. Unknown future syntax should
  fall through generic `deny_unknown_fields` or clap unknown-flag
  diagnostics, not feature-specific rejection arms.
- Keep C support first-class: when touching build planning, manifests,
  flags, toolchains, generated Ninja, packaging, lockfiles, metadata, or
  docs for those areas, cover C alongside C++ (fixtures included).
- Keep generated and machine-readable output deterministic (sorted or
  normalized); the full list is in `docs/architecture.md`
