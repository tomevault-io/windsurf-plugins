# Eternia Agent Operations Guide

This guide documents how autonomous and human-in-the-loop agents collaborate on Eternia. It distills industry best
practices for multi-agent delivery and adapts them to Eternia's alignment-first simulation stack, security posture, and
narrative goals.

## Objectives

- Preserve Alignment Governor authority: agents must honor pause, rollback, and red-mode signals before acting.
- Deliver traceable value: every action should link back to an issue, story, or task in `docs/tasks.md` or
  `docs/implementation_stories.md`.
- Stay test-first and reversible: agents stage tests before implementation work and maintain undo paths with checkpoints
  and Git hygiene.
- Minimize blast radius: apply gated changes, lean on preview environments, and surface risk to human overseers early.
- Keep repo truth authoritative: architecture, roadmap, and handoff memory live in repository docs, not in plugin prompts
  or ad hoc agent memory.

## Operating Model

Eternia uses a five-layer operating model so contributors can tell where a task belongs before they reach for tools:

1. **Truth layer**: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/tasks.md`, `docs/implementation_stories.md`,
   `docs/implementation_notes.md`, and `docs/agentic_orchestration_plan.md` remain the canonical source of truth.
2. **Repo skill layer**: project-scoped skills such as `eternia-workflow`, `eternia-runtime`, `eternia-next-task`, and
   `eternia-handoff` encode repeatable Eternia-specific workflows.
3. **Decision-agent layer**: the repo-scoped agents in `.codex/agents/` act as the thinking layer for mission fit,
   privacy/alignment review, state-memory review, and memo synthesis.
4. **Execution layer**: built-in execution agents such as `explorer` and `worker` handle bounded codebase discovery and
   implementation work.
5. **Plugin layer**: external plugins are boundary tools for systems outside the repo, not replacements for repo truth.

Treat plugins as selective adapters. They are appropriate when a task needs live PR metadata, deployment logs, Figma
artifacts, external collaboration data, or official product docs. They do not own architecture, governance,
simulation-runtime design, or testing policy.

## Delegation Default

Eternia's default is to use repo-local subagents whenever they materially improve delivery speed, review quality, or
focus without obscuring ownership.

"Materially help" usually means one or more of the following are true:

- A bounded discovery or verification task can run in parallel with the main line of work.
- An alignment, privacy, state-memory, or synthesis review would reduce risk before implementation or merge.
- An implementation slice has a clear interface, disjoint write scope, and explicit validation target.

Keep tightly coupled, blocking, or trivial work on the main thread when the next action depends immediately on that
result or when delegation would create duplicate context gathering. Avoid overlapping write ownership, redundant
subagent prompts, or delegation that hides who is responsible for the final integrated change.

## Core Roles and Handoffs

| Role                | Primary Outputs                                                                 | Guardrails                                                                       | Notes                                                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Supervisor**      | Draft PR seeded from `agent:ready` issues, branch `agent/{issue-number}-{slug}` | Blocks on repo `red-mode` or `needs-human-review` labels; idempotent PR creation | Runs on schedule or issue label events; leaves audit trail in PR timeline  |
| **Planner**         | `plan.md` with acceptance criteria, dependency callouts, risk log               | References canonical docs; forbids implementation changes                        | Uses strongest model; ensures alignment checks and runtime impact analysis |
| **Test Author**     | New or expanded automated tests committed before code                           | Restricted to `tests/`, `test/`, `ui/tests`, fixtures                            | Must justify skipped tests; promotes contract-first delivery               |
| **Implementer(s)**  | Minimal diff implementing planned change set                                    | Whitelisted directories; diff validation via `git_ops`                           | Fails closed on governor overrides or missing tests                        |
| **Reviewer**        | Rubric score + actionable feedback comment                                      | Checks correctness, perf, alignment, documentation                               | Can request human escalation when uncertainty > threshold                  |
| **Security Sentry** | Findings + patches or blocking comments                                         | Runs Semgrep/CodeQL/HMAC checklists; respects secret allow-list                  | Coordinates with governor for sensitive flows                              |
| **Doc Scribe**      | README/API/ADR updates, demo scripts                                            | Ensures human and agent onboarding stay current                                  | Syncs with `docs/pending_implementation_design.md`                         |

## End-to-End Workflow

1. **Issue Intake**: Product or Mission Control labels an issue with `agent:ready` and optional `epic:*` tag. Include
   story context, acceptance criteria, and links to design docs.
2. **Safety Gate**: Supervisor verifies `red-mode` and `needs-human-review` labels; logs decision. Governor overrides
   pause all automation.
3. **Branch & Draft PR**: Supervisor creates branch + Draft PR; posts Planner output as first comment.
4. **Sequential Roles**: Flow orchestrator triggers roles in order (Planner → Test Author → Implementer → Reviewer →
   Security → Doc Scribe). Each step leaves structured comments and commits.
5. **Validation**: Until the automation helpers land, execute Python suites with `pytest -q` (planned hand-off to
   `agents/tools/run_tests.py`) and gate UI/perf checks through existing CI jobs. Failures block progression.
6. **Observability Checks**: After implementation, agents fetch `/metrics`, review logs, and update risk status.
   Persistent anomalies open follow-up issues labeled `alignment:review`.
7. **Human Handoff**: On success, mark PR `ready for review`. On uncertainty or escalations, add `needs-human-review`,
   summarize blockers, and halt automation.

## Operational Guardrails

- **Diff Discipline**: Implementers must submit unified diffs validated by `git_ops`. Reject patches touching
  non-whitelisted roots or exceeding size thresholds.
- **Test Coverage**: PR merges require updated or new tests unless explicitly waived by human reviewer. Test Author
  advocates for coverage parity in Python and TypeScript.
- **Secrets & ENV Hygiene**: Only expose environment variables enumerated in `config/mcp/.env.example`. Never echo
  secret values in logs or comments.
- **Governor Compliance**: Call Alignment Governor APIs (`/api/governor/*`) through approved clients. Respect veto
  responses and log attempts.
- **Privacy Constraints**: When handling conversation data, defer to consent toggles and sanitization utilities in
  `modules/data_privacy.py`.

## Tooling Expectations

- Pin runtime versions via `agents/versions.py` (planned) or container images to avoid non-deterministic diffs.
- Prefer repo-local CLIs (poetry, npm scripts) over global binaries; run inside dedicated venv or Node environment.
- Capture artifacts (test results, SBOM, preview URLs) under `artifacts/` or GitHub Action summaries; avoid committing
  generated binaries.
- Start orientation from `README.md`, `docs/module_map.md`, `docs/tasks.md`, and `docs/implementation_notes.md`.
  If `scripts/repo_atlas.py` exists in the checked-out tree, you may use it to refresh `artifacts/repo_atlas.json`,
  but do not assume planned helper scripts are already present.
- Use `.codex/agents/README.md` together with the repo-local skills under `.codex/skills/` to classify work before
  execution. Treat `agents/prompts/` as planned scaffolding unless those files exist in the current tree.
- Use external plugins selectively:
  - GitHub for PR, issue, review-thread, and CI context.
  - Build Web Apps / Vercel for previews, runtime logs, browser verification, and deployment follow-up.
  - Figma only when a design artifact or design-system sync task exists.
  - Collaboration plugins such as Google Drive, Slack, and Gmail only when the task actually depends on those systems.
  - Official product-doc retrieval only for external-source research, never as a substitute for local architecture docs.

## Workflow Contracts

Every first-class workflow should declare these fields before execution:

- Source of truth
- Allowed tools or plugins
- Writable artifacts
- Required tests or checks
- Escalation conditions

Eternia currently standardizes three workflow families:

1. **Feature implementation**: repo truth -> decision agents for framing/risk -> bounded implementation -> local tests ->
   optional GitHub or deployment follow-up.
2. **Research to decision**: external retrieval only when needed -> repo-grounded memo -> synthesis -> docs or backlog
   update.
3. **Audit or refactor**: architecture/privacy/state review first -> bounded execution -> regression verification.

## Issue & Label Conventions

- `agent:ready`: Eligible for automation once requirements and links exist.
- `red-mode`: Automation freeze (only hotfix/security tasks allowed).
- `alignment:review`: Signals potential immersion or safety regression; requires governor & human audit.
- `needs-human-review`: Forces human intervention; Supervisor must respect and stand down.
- `epic:{A-F}`: Maps to implementation stories epics for reporting.
- Keep `docs/issue_story_map.json` current so automation can resolve stories from GitHub issues.

## Best Practices for Humans Partnering with Agents

- Provide crisp problem statements, explicit acceptance criteria, and validation hints in issues.
- Respond quickly to agent escalation comments to reduce idle branches.
- Label follow-up tasks with `handoff` and supply context (logs, metric IDs, reproduction scripts).
- Periodically audit agent comments and commits to refine repo-local skills and any future `agents/prompts/`
  checklists once those files actually exist.
- Review and rotate access tokens; revoke unused credentials from GitHub secrets and `.env` templates.

## Onboarding & Local Dry Runs

1. Copy `.env.example` from `config/mcp/` and populate tokens locally.
2. Install agent dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install --prefix ui`, additional CLIs listed in
   `installed_packages.txt`).
3. Read `README.md`, `docs/module_map.md`, `docs/tasks.md`, and `docs/implementation_notes.md` for orientation before
   touching code. If `scripts/repo_atlas.py` exists in the checked-out tree, you may also run it for a machine-readable
   snapshot.
4. Run `python -m agents.orchestrator.flow --dry-run <ISSUE_ID>` to simulate the pipeline and review required steps.
5. Verify governor connection with `python navigator.py --status` and ensure no `red-mode` label is active before real
   runs.

## Keeping This Guide Current

- Update this file whenever agent prompts, workflows, or guardrails change.
- Mirror changes in `docs/agentic_orchestration_plan.md` and `docs/codex_operating_model.md`, and mention major
  updates in release notes or internal briefings.
- Add TODOs to `docs/tasks.md` when gaps are discovered (new tools, missing scripts, updated governance rules).

Following this guide keeps Eternia's automation aligned with its narrative safety goals while enabling rapid, auditable
delivery.
