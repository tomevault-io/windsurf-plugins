# Löve2D Project Structure and Guidelines

This project is a Löve2D game built with Lua. Follow these guidelines when working on the code.

## Project Structure
- main.lua: The entry point that initializes the game
- conf.lua: Configuration settings for the Löve2D framework
- lib/: Third-party libraries and dependencies
- assets/: Game assets (images, audio, fonts, shaders)
- src/: Source code organized by functionality

## File Organization
- Keep related code in dedicated modules
- Organize entities (players, enemies, items) in src/entities/
- Place game states/scenes in src/scenes/
- Store utility functions in src/utils/
- Group UI components in src/ui/

## Coding Conventions
- Use snake_case for filenames and variables (player_score.lua, local player_health)
- Use PascalCase for "classes" (Player, Enemy)
- Prefix private functions with underscore (_calculateDamage)
- Organize "classes" with metatables and proper OOP structure
- Document functions with comments explaining parameters and return values
- Return the module table at the end of each module file

## Lua Best Practices
- Use local variables whenever possible for better performance
- Cache frequently used functions in locals (local sin = math.sin)
- Minimize table creation inside loops to reduce garbage collection
- Avoid string concatenation in performance-critical code
- Use table.insert() instead of t[#t+1] = value for clarity
- Reuse tables rather than creating new ones frequently
- Prefer ipairs() for sequential arrays and pairs() for associative tables
- Use the module pattern: local Module = {}; return Module at the end

## Löve2D Best Practices
- Use love.load() for initialization
- Handle game state in love.update(dt)
- Keep drawing code in love.draw()
- Separate logic and rendering
- Use love.keypressed/love.keyreleased for input handling
- Batch similar draw operations for performance
- Load assets once at startup, not during gameplay
- Use love.graphics.push() and love.graphics.pop() to manage transformations
- Consider using a state management library like hump.gamestate
- Implement a consistent update/draw pattern across all game objects

## Performance Considerations
- Reuse tables rather than creating new ones frequently
- Be mindful of garbage collection
- Use spritebatches for drawing multiple instances of the same image
- Consider using shaders for special effects rather than runtime calculations
- Profile your game regularly to identify bottlenecks
- Implement incremental garbage collection to avoid frame rate hitches
- Minimize the number of love.graphics state changes
- Use love.graphics.setColor once before drawing multiple objects of the same color
- Consider object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects

## Memory Management
- Monitor memory usage during development
- Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Be careful with closures that capture large environments
- Avoid creating large temporary tables in frequently called functions
- Consider implementing a custom allocation tracking system for debugging
- Set collectgarbage parameters appropriately for real-time performance

## Game Architecture
- Implement a scene/state management system
- Use an entity-component pattern for complex game objects
- Separate update and draw logic
- Consider implementing a simple event system for communication between components
- Use a model-view separation pattern for complex entities

## Asset Guidelines
- Keep image sizes as powers of 2 when possible
- Compress audio files appropriately
- Use a consistent art style
- Organize assets by type and purpose

## Testing
- Test your game on multiple devices/resolutions
- Implement debug tools to help with development
- Consider writing unit tests for complex logic
