# Knowledge Base — Vault Conventions

## Vault Structure
- `raw/` — Source material, clipped articles, research (input zone)
- `wiki/` — LLM-compiled knowledge base (you maintain this)
- `output/` — Query results and generated reports

## Wiki System
You are the librarian of the `wiki/` folder. You write and maintain everything in it.

### Structure
- `wiki/_master-index.md` is the entry point — lists every topic with a one-line description.
- Each topic gets its own subfolder with its own `_index.md` listing all articles.

### Compiling
When I say "compile" or dump new material in `raw/`:
1. Read each raw file
2. Decide which topic it belongs to (or create a new topic folder)
3. Write a wiki article with key takeaways and [[wiki links]] to related concepts
4. Update that topic's `_index.md`
5. Update `wiki/_master-index.md`
6. If a raw file spans multiple topics, create articles in both and cross-link

### Querying
When answering questions against the knowledge base:
1. Read `wiki/_master-index.md` first to find the right topic
2. Read that topic's `_index.md` to find relevant articles
3. Read the specific articles
4. Synthesize the answer

### Auditing
When I say "audit" or "lint", review the wiki for:
- Inconsistent or contradictory information
- Missing cross-links between related concepts
- Gaps in coverage
- Suggest improvements, but don't make changes without confirmation

## Conventions
- Always use [[wiki links]] when referencing other notes
- File names: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `ai-agent-overview.md`)
- Keep articles concise — bullet points over paragraphs
- Always include a `## Key Takeaways` section in wiki articles
