# WeKite — Agent Guide

## Build

```bash
./x build           # debug (uses same signing as release)
./x build --release # release (with optimization on)
./x zygisk build    # standard universal APK + arm64/arm32 Zygisk module ZIP
# (./x is alias to `cargo xtask` which orchestrates the build process)
```

- JDK 21
- **Gradle does NOT build the Rust native lib.** `./gradlew assemble*` only packages whatever
  prebuilt `libwekit_native.so` already sits in `app/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/`. Compiling
  `app/src/main/rust/wekit-native` and refreshing those `.so` files is xtask's job
  (`task_build_native`), so **always go through `./x`** — running Gradle directly will silently ship
  a stale native lib. Requires a Rust toolchain + the Android NDK and its Rust targets;
  `./x configure` regenerates `wekit-native/.cargo/config.toml` from the local NDK and is invoked
  automatically by the build tasks.
- `./x build --native-only` rebuilds just the native lib into `jniLibs/`
- AGP 9, Gradle version catalog in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`

## Project Structure

- `app/` — main Android module, entrypoints, hooks, UI, native Rust lib
- `libs/common/annotation-scanner/` — KSP annotation processor (`@Feature` scanner)
- `libs/common/libxposed-api/` — compileOnly LibXposed API interface stubs (compileOnly since they are provided by user's Xposed framework)
- `libs/common/bsh/` — submodule: forked BeanShell interpreter with snapshot serialization (`BshSnapshot`, `BshSnapshotHelper`); snapshots are encrypted AST byte representations used by the WAuxiliary Xposed module; `app/src/main/java/com.github.wekite/utils/BshSnapshotDecompiler.kt` — decompiles encrypted BeanShell snapshot files back into Java-like source code; the AES key was recovered from WAuxiliary's decompiled source
- `libs/common/reflekt/` — submodule: reflection utility library (`dev.ujhhgtg.reflekt`)
- `libs/common/stubs/` — compileOnly stubs for WeChat and Android hidden classes
- `buildSrc/` — custom Gradle tasks: `GenerateMethodHashesTask` (`IResolveDex` `resolveDex` method MD5 cache), `GenerateNewFeaturesTask` (features whose source file was added within 30 days of the HEAD commit → `NewFeatures.ADDED_AT_BY_NAME`, backing the 新功能 pseudo-category)
- `xtask/` — build orchestration behind `./x`: native-lib compilation + NDK linker config, APK
  assembly via Gradle, and Zygisk module packaging/flashing

## Entry Points & Architecture

- Xposed entry: `com.github.wekite.loader.entry.xp51.Xp51HookEntry` (legacy Xposed API 51+) and Zygisk native entry via `ZygiskEntry` / `LxpHookEntry` (standard build)
- Unified flow: `UnifiedEntryPoint.entry()` → `StartupAgent.startup()` → `WeLauncher.init()`
- Hook items annotated with `@Feature(path, description)`, auto-discovered by KSP annotation scanner at compile time
- Base classes: `SwitchFeature` (toggle on/off), `ClickableFeature` (toggle on/off with onClick event), `ApiFeature` (always-on), `BaseFeature` (abstract base, do not use directly)
- DEX analysis via DexKit with `IResolveDex` interface; method resolve body MD5-hashed for cache (
  `GenerateMethodHashesTask`)
- DEX-resolved targets DSL: `val methodTarget by dexMethod()` `val classTarget by dexClass()` delegate → `methodTarget.hookBefore { ... }`, `val method: Method = methodTarget.method`, `val clazz = classTarget.clazz`
- UI: Jetpack Compose + Material 3, dialogs written using `showComposeDialog` and `AlertDialogContent`
- Config: MMKV via `WePrefs`
- Logging: via `WeLogger`

## Key Conventions

- Package namespace: `com.github.wekite`
- Min SDK 28, target SDK 37, compile SDK 37
- Target: WeChat `com.tencent.mm`, versions 8.0.65–8.0.76. Current host info in `HostInfo`
- Process targeting via `TargetProcesses`: override `startup()` to check
  `TargetProcesses.isInMain` / `TargetProcesses.currentType`. Default: main process only.
- No unit tests — manual testing on real WeChat only
- If `JsApiExposer` (`hooks/items/scripting_js/JsApiExposer.kt`) is modified, keep `globals.d.ts` in
  the same directory in sync — it's the TypeScript type declaration for the JS scripting API
- NEVER wrap `hookBefore` and `hookAfter` in a `try-catch`/`runCatching` block. They should NOT fail. If they fail, then it's the module developer's problem.
- Use `WePrefs.Companion.prefOption` delegates to declare & use preference items easily.
- Teardown/revert on `onDisable` is **best-effort by design**, not a requirement. Many features
  irreversibly modify the host view tree; fully reverting them would need complex state management
  and syncing for little gain, so having the user restart WeChat is the accepted approach. Do NOT
  report "feature does not undo its changes in `onDisable`" as a bug.

## Naming Conventions

- 群聊: WeChat: chatroom; WeKite: group/群组
- 朋友圈: WeChat: sns; WeKite: moment

## Context you need

- WeChat decompiled sources: ~/coding/wechat_80{65,67,69,74,76}
- Decrypted WeChat main database: ./decrypted_wechat.db

## CI

- GitHub Actions: builds on push to `master`
- Artifacts published as GitHub Release (APK + Zygisk ZIP + update.json), see `VERSIONING.md`
