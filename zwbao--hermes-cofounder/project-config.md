# Hermes Agent - Development Guide

Instructions for AI coding assistants and developers working on the hermes-agent codebase.

**Never give up on the right solution.**

## What Hermes Is

Hermes is a personal AI agent that runs the same agent core across a CLI, a
messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, Slack, and ~20 other platforms), a TUI,
and an Electron desktop app. It learns across sessions (memory + skills),
delegates to subagents, runs scheduled jobs, and drives a real terminal and
browser. It is extended primarily through **plugins and skills**, not by
growing the core.

Two properties shape almost every design decision and are the lens for
reviewing any change:

- **Per-conversation prompt caching is sacred.** A long-lived conversation
  reuses a cached prefix every turn. Anything that mutates past context,
  swaps toolsets, or rebuilds the system prompt mid-conversation invalidates
  that cache and multiplies the user's cost. We do not do it (the one
  exception is context compression).
- **The core is a narrow waist; capability lives at the edges.** Every model
  tool we add is sent on every API call, so the bar for a new *core* tool is
  high. Most new capability should arrive as a CLI command + skill, a
  service-gated tool, or a plugin — not as core surface.

## Contribution Rubric — What We Want / What We Don't

This is the project's intent layer. Use it two ways:

1. **For humans and for your own work** — what gets merged and what gets
   rejected, so a contribution aims at the target.
2. **For automated review (the triage sweeper)** — guidance on when a PR is
   safe to close on the three allowed reasons (`implemented_on_main`,
   `cannot_reproduce`, `incoherent`) and, just as important, **when NOT to
   close** one. Taste-based "we don't want this / out of scope" closes are NOT
   an automated decision — those stay with a human maintainer. The sweeper's
   job here is to recognize design intent and *avoid wrongly closing a
   legitimate contribution*, not to make the won't-implement call itself.

Read the balance right: Hermes ships a **lot** — most merges are bug fixes to
real reported behavior, and the product surface (platforms, channels,
providers, models, desktop/TUI features) expands aggressively and on purpose.
The restraint below is aimed squarely at the **core agent + the model tool
schema**, the one place where every addition is paid for on every API call.
"Smallest footprint" governs *how a capability is wired into the core*, NOT
whether the product is allowed to grow. We are expansive at the edges and
conservative at the waist.

### What we want

- **Fix real bugs, well.** The bulk of what lands is `fix(...)` against an
  actual reported symptom. A good fix reproduces the symptom on current
  `main`, points to the exact line where it manifests, and fixes the whole bug
  class — sibling call paths included — not just the one site the reporter hit.
- **Expand reach at the edges.** New platform adapters, channels, providers,
  models, and desktop/TUI/dashboard features are welcome and land routinely,
  including large ones (a new messaging channel, a session-cap feature, a
  Windows PTY bridge). Breadth in the product is a goal, not a footprint
  concern — as long as it integrates with the existing setup/config UX
  (`hermes tools`, `hermes setup`, auto-install) rather than bolting on a raw
  env var.
- **Refactor god-files into clean modules.** Extracting a multi-thousand-line
  cluster out of `cli.py` / `run_agent.py` / `gateway/run.py` into a focused
  mixin or module is wanted work, even when the diff is huge and mechanical
  (large `+N/-N` refactors merge regularly). The "every line traces to the
  request" test applies to *feature* PRs; a declared refactor's request IS the
  extraction.
- **Keep the core narrow.** New *model tools* are the expensive exception —
  every tool ships on every API call. Prefer, in order: extend existing code →
  CLI command + skill → service-gated tool (`check_fn`) → plugin → MCP server
  in the catalog → new core tool (last resort). See "The Footprint Ladder."
- **Extend, don't duplicate.** Before adding a module/manager/hook, check
  whether existing infrastructure already covers the use case. When several PRs
  integrate the same *category*, design one shared interface instead of merging
  them one at a time (see the ABC + orchestrator note under the Footprint
  Ladder).
- **Behavior contracts over snapshots.** Tests should assert how two pieces of
  data must relate (invariants), not freeze a current value (model lists,
  config version literals, enumeration counts). See "Don't write
  change-detector tests."
- **E2E validation, not just green unit mocks.** For anything touching
  resolution chains, config propagation, security boundaries, remote
  backends, or file/network I/O, exercise the real path with real imports
  against a temp `HERMES_HOME`. Mocks hide integration bugs.
- **Cache-, alternation-, and invariant-safe.** Preserve prompt caching, strict
  message role alternation (never two same-role messages in a row; never a
  synthetic user message injected mid-loop), and a system prompt that is
  byte-stable for the life of a conversation.
