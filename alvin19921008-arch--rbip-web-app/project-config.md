# Playwright Smoke Guidelines

## When Editing Smoke Tests (`tests/smoke/**/*.ts`)
- Use `@smoke` grep tag for fast workflow validation
- Prefer functional assertions over screenshot/snapshot diff
- Keep deterministic: single worker, avoid timing-dependent checks

## When Editing Config (`playwright.config.ts`)
- Keep optimized for fast feedback:
  - Chromium-only by default
  - `trace: 'retain-on-failure'`, `screenshot: 'only-on-failure'`
  - `workers: 1` for deterministic workflow checks
- Avoid heavyweight defaults unless explicitly requested
- Use `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` env var for flexibility
