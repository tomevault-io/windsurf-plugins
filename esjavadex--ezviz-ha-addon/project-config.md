# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Home Assistant add-on that streams EZVIZ cameras via HLS. Primary target platform is **Raspberry Pi 4** running Home Assistant OS. The addon reverse-engineers the EZVIZ proprietary protocol to capture unencrypted video streams without cloud dependencies.

## Architecture

### Streaming Pipeline
1. `ezviz_stream.py` - EZVIZ protocol implementation (API auth, VTM/VTDU connection)
2. `stream_to_pipe.py` - Connects to VTDU, outputs raw H.265 video to stdout
3. `run.sh` - Orchestrates pipeline: Python → ffmpeg (H.265→H.264) → HLS segments
4. Python HTTP server serves HLS on port 8080

### Authentication

`meta.code 6002` on login means **EZVIZ requires device verification**, not a
wrong password. The flow is: login → 6002 → `POST /v3/sms/nologin/checkcode`
with `{from: account, bizType: TERMINAL_BIND}` → login again with `smsCode`,
`msgType: "3"` and `bizType: "TERMINAL_BIND"`. That registers the terminal once.

The `featureCode` identifies this installation and must be stable across
restarts, or EZVIZ asks for a code every time. It is generated on first run and
persisted to `/data/feature_code`. A hardcoded value shared by all installs gets
rejected — that is exactly what broke version 2.1.1 and earlier.

`login()` raises `EzvizAuthError` / `EzvizMFARequired` instead of returning a
bare `False`, because a caller has to distinguish credentials problems (which
retrying never fixes) from a dropped stream (which retrying does fix).
`stream_to_pipe.py` exits with **78** on auth failures so `run.sh` backs off
instead of retrying every 0.5s.

The session (`sessionId` + `rfSessionId`) is persisted to `/data/session.json`
and renewed through `PUT /v3/apigateway/login`, falling back to a full login
only when the refresh is rejected. This matters: a full login can hit device
verification, so restarting the add-on should not be an authentication event.

Verification codes are requested at most once every `MFA_RESEND_SECONDS`
(marker in `/data/mfa_requested_at`). Each send invalidates the previous code,
so asking on every retry leaves the user chasing an already-expired one.

### Logging

`http_server.py` collapses routine traffic (200/206/304/404) into a periodic
summary. A player polls the playlist several times a second, and when there is
no stream that becomes hundreds of 404s per minute — enough to push real errors
out of the add-on log. Anything that is not routine traffic is still printed
immediately.

### EZVIZ Protocol Flow
1. Login to EZVIZ API (`/v3/users/login/v5`), receive session JWT
2. Get server info for AUTH_URL
3. Request VTDU tokens from AUTH_URL
4. Connect to VTM server, send StreamInfoReq, receive VTDU redirect
5. Connect to VTDU, receive continuous video on channel 0x01

### VTM Packet Format
- 8-byte header: magic (0x24), channel, length (u16), sequence (u16), message code (u16)
- Channel 0x00 = messages, 0x01 = video stream
- MSG_STREAMINFO_REQ = 0x13b, MSG_KEEPALIVE_REQ = 0x135

### HLS Configuration
- `append_list+omit_endlist+discont_start` flags for seamless reconnection
- Unique segment names per session prevent video looping during reconnects
- Transcodes HEVC to H.264 for browser compatibility

## Key Limitations

- **EZVIZ enforces ~30 second connection timeout** (server-side, cannot be bypassed)
- Handled via auto-reconnection loop with 0.5s restart delay
- Keepalive packets (0x135) are rejected by server - do not attempt

## Local Development

### Test without Home Assistant
```bash
cd local-test
cp .env.example .env  # Edit with your credentials
./start.sh            # Start Docker container
# Stream at http://localhost:8080/stream.m3u8
./stop.sh             # Cleanup
```

### Deploy to Home Assistant
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. In HA: Settings → Add-ons → Repositories → Refresh
3. Reinstall/update the add-on
