# LokalMind v2 - Cursor Rules

## Scope of changes (read first)
- Do exactly what is requested. No unrelated refactors, no extra files, no unsolicited improvements.
- When editing existing files, match surrounding style, naming, and import patterns before introducing anything new.
- Do not generate barrel files, index re-exports, README files, or boilerplate unless explicitly asked.
- Keep final explanations short and technical.

## Engineering bar
- Write production-ready, senior-level React Native + TypeScript code.
- Keep implementations concise, modular, and easy to review.
- Prefer maintainable patterns over quick hacks; avoid duplication.
- Add brief developer comments only for non-obvious decisions or complex logic.

## Architecture (mandatory)
- Follow Clean Architecture: Presentation -> Use Cases -> Domain; Data implements repositories; infrastructure injected via DI.
- Never bypass contracts in `src/core/ports/` or repository interfaces.
- Keep domain pure: no framework or third-party SDK imports in domain entities or use cases.
- If a change conflicts with architecture, refactor to comply - do not add exceptions.

## LokalMind conventions (mandatory)
- Respect naming and folder conventions for screens, ViewModels, use cases, repositories, and routes.
- Use `Result<T>`-style flows for use cases; explicit error branches in ViewModels.
- MobX ViewModels: `makeAutoObservable(this)` first in constructor; all async mutations inside `runInAction`.
- Stack: Expo 54, RN 0.81, React 19.1, expo-router v6, MobX 6, llama.rn (GGUF), whisper.rn, expo-sqlite, RevenueCat.

## Platform constraints
- No Node.js-only APIs; all packages must be Expo-compatible.
- Validate native module compatibility (llama.rn, whisper.rn) before adding new dependencies.
- Whenever using a package, verify API usage against current docs and do not use deprecated APIs.
- Do not assume web APIs are available; guard platform-specific branches explicitly.

## TypeScript strictness
- TypeScript strictness: avoid `any`, prefer precise interfaces and explicit return types on public APIs.
- Use guard clauses and early returns to keep control flow flat.
- Handle edge cases first; never swallow errors silently.
- Keep UI code declarative; business logic belongs in use cases and ViewModels.

## Performance defaults
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders; memoize only where it produces measurable improvement.
- Stable keys and item layout strategies for large lists.
- Keep expensive computation out of render paths.
- Prefer incremental/streaming patterns for long-running tasks (inference, STT).

## Developer comments (high-signal only)
- Comment the "why", not the "what".
- 1-2 lines max; technical and precise.
- Comment around complex async flow, fallback behavior, and architectural trade-offs.
- Remove stale comments when code changes.

## Testing and reliability
- Add or update tests for critical logic changes and bug fixes.
- Unit tests for use cases and ViewModels; integration tests for key user flows.
- Keep tests deterministic; no time or network flakiness.
- Do not change behavior without validation.
