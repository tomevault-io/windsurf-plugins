# Testing Conventions

Full reference: `docs/development/CONVENTIONS.md` section 7.

## File location - co-located with source

```
SendMessageUseCase.ts
SendMessageUseCase.test.ts   ← same directory
```

## What must be tested

- Every `UseCase` - no exceptions
- Every `ViewModel` - initial state, each action, computed, async success + failure

## Mock at the interface boundary

```typescript
// Good - mock the interface
class MockChatRepository implements IChatRepository {
  saveMessage = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: '1', text: 'hi' });
}

// Bad - mock the concrete implementation
jest.mock('expo-sqlite');
```

## PR requirements

- New UseCase → must ship with tests
- New ViewModel → must ship with tests
- Bug fix → must include regression test
