# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

A Bun service that turns the Ulanzi TC002 pixel clock (52×16 LED) into a multi-channel content
studio: market tickers, tools, visual effects, a drawing canvas, a music/lyrics workstation
(NetEase + Spotify Connect), and a game arcade. The device has two tiers (ADR 0014): the
official Ulanzi firmware, which the service pushes rendered frames to, and **ZOS**
(`device/tc002-os/`), the one native C++ firmware in this repo — a full replacement that pulls
from the service; every new device-side feature targets ZOS only. A sideloaded C++ music
player (`device/tc002-lyrics-player/`) remains as a transitional artifact until ZOS's
device-side audio is verified on hardware, and receives no changes. Runtime is Bun 1.3.14
(pinned in `mise.toml`); `CLOCK_HOST` (the clock's LAN IP/hostname) is required for the
service to start.

## Commands

```bash
bun install
bun test                          # whole suite (bun:test)
bun test test/workspace.test.ts   # one file
bun test -t "carousel"            # filter by test name
bun run typecheck                 # tsc --noEmit over src/ scripts/ test/ web/
bun run build                     # vite lib build → dist/assets, then Bun.build of service/status/preview
CLOCK_HOST=<ip> bun start         # build + run dist/service.js, console at http://127.0.0.1:43820/
bun run preview                   # render every saved channel to .runtime/previews/ (no device needed)
bun run status                    # query a running service
bun run agent -- --help           # VIBE usage collector, for when the service is not on the machine holding the CLI logins
bun run agent-build -- --all      # compile that collector to dist/agent/ for every platform
mise run os-hostcheck             # compile+run the ZOS UI self-check and the games self-check on the host (clang++)
```

There is **no Vite dev server**. The web UI is built as a library bundle (`dist/assets/studio.js`
+ `studio.css`) and served by the Bun process, so any change under `web/` requires `bun run build`
before it shows up in the browser. `dist/` and `.runtime/` are gitignored.

Firmware builds (Docker cross-compile, optional) are `mise run os-build`, `os-linkaudit` and
`os-image`, documented in `device/tc002-os/README.md`; the shared toolchain lives in
`device/flythings-build/`. The transitional music sideload keeps `music-release` and its own
`device/tc002-lyrics-player/README.md` until it goes.

## Architecture

One Bun process does everything. `src/service.ts` is the composition root: it constructs every
store/client, then runs (a) `Bun.serve` on `HEALTH_PORT` (default 43820) and (b) a scheduling loop
that calls `controller.pushDue()` and sleeps until the next channel is due.

**Request handling** — `Bun.serve` always binds `0.0.0.0` (the clock itself must reach the
device-facing endpoints); `CONTROL_HOST` only affects what the installer advertises. Every HTTP
route lives in one big handler in `src/control-api.ts`; WebSocket upgrades for `/api/game/socket`
are decided first by `src/game-socket.ts` (a pure relay for the phone gamepad and doodle wall).

**Content pipeline** — the core contract is `ContentDefinition` in `src/content-registry.ts`:
a renderer receives a context (market data, weather, pixel assets) plus item options and returns
**frames + frame delays only**. Renderers never touch the device and never run their own loops.
`src/workspace-controller.ts` owns everything stateful: market caching, per-channel frame budgets,
GIF/PNG encoding (`src/pixel-ui.ts`, `src/display.ts`), serialized device writes, per-content
failure isolation, and refresh scheduling. Adding a built-in content type = registering one more
`ContentDefinition`; the registry deliberately does not load third-party JS at runtime (ADR 0001).

**Device transport** — `src/clock-client.ts` posts a complete Custom App per request to the
clock's native `POST /api/custom?name=...`, injected into the controller as `pushPayload(appName,
payload)` so a future MQTT/Home-Assistant transport needs no renderer changes. There are two write
paths on purpose: channel pushes go through curl (carries `CLOCK_HTTP_PROXY`), while
latency-critical writes — `/api/live/frames` and `/api/notify` — use Bun's native `fetch` and
bypass the proxy, on their own serial `liveWriteQueue` (~16 ms vs ~170 ms per write; this is what
makes 25 fps live streaming work — ADR 0003).

**Sideload installers** — `src/tc002-music-installer.ts` is one parameterized `Tc002SideloadInstaller`
used twice via `MUSIC_SIDELOAD_PROFILE` / `OS_SIDELOAD_PROFILE` (appId, remote dir, confirm
phrase, cleanup list). Sideloading is always non-persistent: files go to the device's tmpfs, flash
is never written, power-cycle restores the official firmware. The two firmwares are mutually
exclusive and distinguish sessions via `/tmp/tc002-sideload.id`. ZOS can also be flashed for good
(ADR 0012); the music profile leaves with the sideloaded player (ADR 0014).

**Web UI** — React 19 + `@cladd-ui/react` + Tailwind v4, entry `web/src/main.tsx` → `web/src/app.tsx`,
