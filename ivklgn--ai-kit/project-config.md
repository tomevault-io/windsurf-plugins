<!-- archcore:start --> managed by `archcore init` — edit outside these markers
## Archcore — project context for this repo

This repo's architecture, decisions, rules, specs and patterns live in `.archcore/`,
reachable through the Archcore MCP tools. Consult them even on code you think you
know — a decision or rule may already constrain it.

- Touching this repo's real code or behavior → search first; read only what matches.
- A decision was made ("we'll use X", "from now on Y") → record it.
- A module / API / system has no doc — or a search comes back empty → capture it.
- Planning a feature or refactor → scope it against what's already decided.

A `.archcore/` may also mount read-only **global sources** — shared, org-wide
context not shown in the session-start list. `list_documents` / `search_documents`
surface them alongside local docs, tagged `source_kind: "global"`. When present,
treat them as defaults a local doc can override — never edit or relate to one.

The search is cheap — lean on it. Skip it only for turns this repo would have no
opinion on: syntax trivia, throwaway snippets, pure mechanics.
