# Project Conventions

## Rust Style

Generic Rust best practices (error handling with `Result`, enums for closed
sets, API and testing idioms) live in
[docs/rust-best-practices.md](docs/rust-best-practices.md). Follow them for
all Rust code in this repo; the project-specific rules below take precedence
where they overlap.

## Rust Edition

**Use edition = "2024" in Cargo.toml** - This is the latest stable Rust edition. Do not change to 2021 or other editions without explicit request.

## Crate Layout

This package has both a library target (`src/lib.rs`, crate name `wbdd`) and a
binary target (`src/main.rs`).

**Never write `mod lib;` in `main.rs`.** Cargo already builds `src/lib.rs` as
its own library target. Declaring it as a module compiles the file a second
time inside the binary crate, producing two independent copies of every type —
same source, incompatible types if they ever meet. rustc warns
`special_module_name`. The binary depends on the library by crate name:

```rust
// src/main.rs
use wbdd::{Config, SolverConfig};
```

The same rule applies to `mod main;` and to any other target reaching into
`lib.rs` by path. Integration tests in `tests/` and downstream crates only ever
see the library target, so anything they need must be public API of `wbdd`.

## Modules and Re-exports

Keep the crate root's public surface flat. Submodules stay private; lift the
types callers need with a re-export at the top of `lib.rs`:

```rust
// src/lib.rs
mod configs;
mod kinematics;

pub use crate::configs::{Config, DifferentialIkConfig, Pose, SolverConfig};
pub use crate::kinematics::{Kinematics, differential_ik, se3_log};
```

Prefer `self::` (or `crate::`) on these paths rather than a bare `use configs::`
— the explicit prefix disambiguates a local module from an external crate of
the same name.

**One public path per type.** `mod foo;` (private) plus a root `pub use` gives
callers exactly one way to name a type: `wbdd::Config`. Writing `pub mod foo;`
*and* re-exporting from it publishes two paths for everything
(`wbdd::configs::Config` and `wbdd::Config`), which then both have to be kept
working. Pick one style — this crate uses private modules with root re-exports.

**Re-export a type from the module that defines it.** Do not `pub use` someone
else's type onward from an unrelated module: `kinematics` importing the config
structs should write a plain `use crate::configs::{...}`, not `pub use`. A
`pub use` there, combined with the root re-export, would give
`DifferentialIkConfig` three public paths and imply the type belongs to
`kinematics`. Plain `use` for consumption, `pub use` only for publishing what
you own.

Re-export deliberately. Exporting a name commits the crate to its signature, so
do not add one to the list until something outside the defining module actually
needs it.

Give a module its own file (`src/configs.rs`) once it outgrows a screen or two.
Inline `mod foo { ... }` blocks are fine for small, tightly-coupled helpers.
Module names are singular by convention (`config`, not `configs`) — this crate
is inconsistent on that point; do not spread it further.

Unit tests live in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the bottom of the module they
exercise, reaching the code under test through `use super::*`.

## Before Finishing

Run, in order:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo check --all-targets
cargo test
```

`cargo fmt` is not optional — do not hand-format `use` lists or wrap lines
yourself. rustfmt sorts names inside braces with uppercase before lowercase
(`DifferentialIkConfig, Kinematics, SolverConfig, differential_ik, se3_log`)
and splits a brace list across lines once it passes the width limit.

Use `--all-targets`. Plain `cargo check` skips `#[cfg(test)]` code, so a test
module that no longer compiles goes unnoticed.

The crate builds warning-clean; a new `unused`/`dead_code` warning means either
the code is unreachable or it is wired up wrong.

## Git Workflow

**Never commit or push without explicit request.** Stage changes and wait for
clear user instruction. This repo is your working directory, not an auto-pushed
branch.

Known failure: `configs::tests::config_parses` asserts a goal translation of
`(-1, -1, 1)` while `assets/config.yaml` specifies `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]`. This
predates the library split. Do not "fix" it by editing whichever side is
convenient — it is unresolved which one is correct.

## Matrix Algebra

**Never change the order of matrix multiplication or division.** Matrices are
non-commutative: `A * B ≠ B * A` in general. A transpose on the wrong side of
a product (`(AB)ᵀ = BᵀAᵀ`, not `AᵀBᵀ`) causes silent type mismatches or runtime
panics when dimensions don't align.

## CI

GitHub Actions runs [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) on
pushes to `main` and all pull requests: `cargo build`, `cargo test`,
`cargo fmt --check`, and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`. The
fmt and clippy jobs are gated hard (`-D warnings`), so keep the tree
formatted and warning-free or CI fails.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
