*   **Maintainability:** Allow for straightforward content updates and maintenance.

**3. Functional Requirements**

*   **3.1. Website Structure & Navigation:**

        *   Legal Links: Imprint, Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy.
        *   Copyright Information.
        *   Design Credit.

*   **3.2. Content Display:**
    *   **3.2.1. Text Content:** Display static text content as provided (headings, paragraphs, lists).
    *   **3.2.2. Image Content:** Display relevant images supporting the website's theme and content. Assume standard image optimization for web performance.

*   **3.3. User Interaction:**
    *   **3.3.1. Contact/Booking Form:**
        *   Provide a form on the "Contact | Booking" page (or linked from it).
        *   Use `React Hook Form` for form handling and validation.
        *   The form should capture necessary user details (e.g., Name, Email, Subject, Message - *specific fields to be confirmed*).
        *   Upon submission, the form data should be sent to the backend (Node.js/Express) via `Axios` and potentially stored in the `Supabase` database via `Prisma`.
        *   Provide user feedback upon successful/failed submission.
        *   *(Integration Note: Consider if Calendly integration is desired here for direct booking instead of/in addition to a contact message).*
    *   **3.3.2. Social Media Links:** Include functional links to Kirameki's social media profiles:
        *   Instagram
        *   YouTube

    *   **3.3.3. External Links:** Include functional links for:
        *   Crowdfunding Initiatives (linking to the relevant platform/page).
        *   *(Integration Note: If crowdfunding involves direct payments on-site, Stripe/Paypal integration will be needed).*
    *   **3.3.4. WhatsApp Link:** The phone number (`+81 80-2888-0788`) should ideally be formatted as a clickable link initiating a WhatsApp chat (`wa.me/` link).
    *   **3.3.5. Authentication (Optional - TBD):**
        *   If user accounts are required (e.g., for managing bookings, saving preferences), implement authentication using `Supabase Auth`.

        *   Support custom OAuth provider: Instagram.
    *   **3.3.6. Booking & Payments (Optional - TBD):**
        *   Integrate `Calendly` for scheduling consultations or program bookings.
        *   Integrate `Stripe` and/or `Paypal` for processing payments related to programs, consultations, or donations/crowdfunding.

        *   Store user consent preferences.
        *   Provide a mechanism for users to manage/change their consent settings later (e.g., via a "Manage Consent" link/button, potentially in the footer).
