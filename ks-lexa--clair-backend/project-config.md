# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CLAIR Backend is a FastAPI-based AI contract-analysis system (Korean-language app, port 8000). It handles contract upload, AI-powered analysis, chat-based Q&A, notifications, and public share links. MySQL + SQLAlchemy ORM, JWT auth with social login (Google/Naver/Kakao), and email-based flows (signup verification, password reset).

**The AI itself lives in a separate service (`clair-ai`, default `http://localhost:8001`).** This backend never calls Gemini/LLMs directly — it POSTs to clair-ai's `/analyze` and `/qa` endpoints. `GEMINI_API_KEY` in config is vestigial; `AI_SERVICE_URL` is what matters.

## Commands

```bash
# Setup
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS clair_db DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;"
cp .env.example .env          # then fill DB_PASSWORD, SECRET_KEY, AI_SERVICE_URL, etc.

# Run dev server
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
# Swagger /docs · ReDoc /redoc · Health /health

# DB migrations (Alembic)
alembic upgrade head                          # apply (run once on fresh DB)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "설명"      # generate migration from model changes
alembic downgrade -1                          # roll back one
```

There is **no test runner configured** — `tests/` exists but is empty, and `pyproject.toml` declares no pytest config. Verify changes by running the server and exercising endpoints (the codebase convention; see git history / PR descriptions).

> macOS networking gotcha: `localhost` can resolve to IPv6 (`::1`) while uvicorn binds IPv4, breaking backend↔clair-ai calls. Use `127.0.0.1` in `AI_SERVICE_URL` and CORS origins.

## Architecture

Layered: **API (`app/api/v1/`) → Services (`app/services/`) → Models/DB (`app/models/`, `app/db/`)**. Route handlers stay thin — no business logic; all logic lives in services, which receive a SQLAlchemy `db` session and the current `User`. Pydantic v2 DTOs in `app/schemas/` are kept separate from ORM models.

Five routers, all mounted in [app/main.py](app/main.py): `auth`, `contracts`, `chat`, `notifications`, `shares`.

### Core singletons & dependencies
- [app/core/config.py](app/core/config.py) — `settings` singleton (Pydantic Settings from `.env`). Single source of truth for all config; has computed properties like `database_url`, `*_list`, `*_bytes`.
- [app/core/security.py](app/core/security.py) — JWT create/decode, password hashing, and the `get_current_user` dependency (`OAuth2PasswordBearer`). Access token 60 min, refresh 7 days.
- [app/db/session.py](app/db/session.py) — `engine`, `SessionLocal`, `Base`, and the `get_db()` dependency injected into every DB-touching route.
- [app/db/init_db.py](app/db/init_db.py) — `init_db()` runs `Base.metadata.create_all()` on startup (lifespan in main.py). **Schema is managed by THREE mechanisms** — `create_all` (boots any missing table, so a forgotten migration can silently "work" locally), Alembic ([alembic/versions/](alembic/versions/), the source of truth), and hand-written SQL in [scripts/](scripts/) (`migrate_2026_05_*.sql` applied manually against shared/prod DBs) plus the original [database/schema.sql](database/schema.sql). For any schema change, always write the Alembic migration; the raw SQL scripts are a parallel manual track, not auto-applied.

### Contract analysis flow (async state machine)
Status: `UPLOADED → PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED / FAILED` (`ContractStatus` enum).

`POST /contracts/{id}/analyze` returns **202 immediately**, then runs `analyze_contract_background(contract_id)` as a FastAPI `BackgroundTask`. That background task **opens its own `SessionLocal()`** (the request-scoped `db` is already closed by the time it runs) and walks the contract through PROCESSING → COMPLETED/FAILED. Frontend polls `GET /contracts/{id}/status` or `GET /contracts/{id}`.

**Critical gotcha:** BackgroundTask exceptions are swallowed (not surfaced to the request). If a contract is stuck in `PROCESSING`, the cause is usually an unhandled error in the background task or an AI-response schema mismatch (see below).

### AI integration (`app/integrations/`)
- [ai_client.py](app/integrations/ai_client.py) — `AIServiceClient` singleton `ai_client`. **The only place that talks to clair-ai.** Services import `ai_client`, never `httpx` or AI types directly. `analyze_contract()` sends a server-local file path (clair-ai reads the file itself); `answer_question()` sends serialized clause dicts as RAG context.
- [ai_models.py](app/integrations/ai_models.py) — Pydantic models for clair-ai responses. **When clair-ai adds a field, mirror it here.** A missing/changed field raises a validation error inside the background task that gets swallowed → contract stuck in PROCESSING.
- [mappers.py](app/integrations/mappers.py) — pure functions converting AI response models → ORM rows (`ContractClause`, `RiskClause`, `ComplianceResult`, `AnalysisResult`).

### Safety scoring ([app/services/scoring.py](app/services/scoring.py))
