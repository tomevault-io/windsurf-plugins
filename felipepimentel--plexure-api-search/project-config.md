# Plexure API Search - Cursor Rules

# Code Preservation Rules
- Never remove existing code that is not directly related to the current change scope
- Always maintain existing functionality unless explicitly requested to change
- Keep all existing imports and dependencies unless they are specifically being refactored
- Preserve existing error handling and logging mechanisms
- Maintain existing configuration options and defaults
- Keep all existing CLI commands and their functionality
- Do not remove or modify existing tests unless they are directly related to changes
- Preserve existing documentation unless it needs to be updated for new changes

# File Specific Rules

## Core Files
- searcher.py: Search engine core logic, query processing, and result ranking
- indexer.py: API contract indexing, vector creation, and database management
- embeddings.py: Vector embedding generation and model management
- cli.py: Command-line interface and user interaction handling
- config.py: Configuration management and environment variables
- cache.py: Caching mechanisms for search results and embeddings
- metrics.py: Performance tracking and statistical measurements
- validation.py: Input validation and data sanitization
- boosting.py: Search result ranking and score boosting logic
- expansion.py: Query expansion and enhancement
- consistency.py: Data consistency and validation checks
- quality.py: Search quality metrics and improvements
- understanding.py: Natural language processing and query understanding
- monitoring.py: System monitoring and logging

## Support Files
- __init__.py: Package initialization and version info
- __main__.py: Entry point for command-line execution

## Configuration Files (in project root)
- pyproject.toml: Project metadata and dependencies
- poetry.lock: Locked dependency versions
- .env: Environment variables (not in git)
- .env.sample: Example environment variables
- .gitignore: Git ignore patterns
- README.md: Project documentation
- LICENSE: Project license
- NOTICE: Third-party notices

## Documentation Files (in docs/ directory)
- api.md: API documentation
- architecture.md: System architecture
- deployment.md: Deployment guide
- development.md: Development guide
- testing.md: Testing guide

# Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use consistent naming conventions across all files
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable names that describe their purpose

# Project Structure
- Keep all core logic in plexure_api_search/ directory
- Place all tests in tests/ directory
- Store configuration files in project root
- Keep documentation in docs/ directory
- Organize modules by feature/domain
- Use __init__.py files to control public APIs
- Keep circular dependencies strictly forbidden
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

# Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Place tests in tests/ directory
- Name test files with test_ prefix
- Test files must match source file names
- Include integration tests for critical paths
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Include performance tests for critical operations

# Documentation
- Document all public APIs with docstrings
- Keep README.md up to date with new features
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Document complex algorithms with comments
- Maintain API documentation in docs/
- Include type hints in documentation
- Document error conditions and handling
- Keep configuration options documented
- Include troubleshooting guides

# Dependencies
- Use Poetry for dependency management
- Pin dependency versions in pyproject.toml
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Document new dependencies in README.md
- Use requirements-dev.txt for development dependencies
- Make optional dependencies truly optional
- Handle dependency conflicts gracefully
- Document minimum version requirements
- Test with multiple Python versions

# Environment
- Use .env for environment variables
- Never commit sensitive data
- Keep .env.sample updated
- Use Python 3.9 or higher
- Document all environment variables
- Provide default values when appropriate
- Validate environment variables at startup
- Handle missing variables gracefully
- Support different environments (dev/prod)

# Model Management
- Use public, well-established models by default
- Handle model loading errors gracefully
- Implement fallback models for robustness
- Cache model artifacts appropriately
- Monitor model performance metrics
- Support model versioning
- Handle tokenization errors gracefully
- Validate model compatibility
- Document model requirements and limitations

# Error Handling
- Use specific exception types
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Implement graceful fallbacks
- Validate inputs early
- Handle resource cleanup properly
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Include error recovery mechanisms
- Monitor error rates and patterns
- Document error handling procedures
