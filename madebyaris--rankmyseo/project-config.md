# Composer senior practices

Load the [senior-practices skill](../skills/senior-practices/SKILL.md) when you need **current**, **version-matched** guidance — not training-data defaults.

## When to use

- Unfamiliar framework, library, or language feature in the repo.
- User asks for "best practice", "modern approach", or "how should we…"
- Upgrade, migration, or new pattern introduction.
- Architecture or code review where recommendations need citations.
- Style governance decision: is local style wrong enough to improve? (see [composer-coding-excellence](composer-coding-excellence.mdc) § Style governance)

## When not to use

- Trivial edits where the file's existing pattern is clear.
- Pure codebase archaeology (use Explore subagent / grep instead).
- Deep multi-vendor research (use [composer-deep-research](composer-deep-research.mdc) / deep-research skill).

## Source tiers

| Tier | Examples | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T1 — Primary** | Official docs, RFCs, release notes, security advisories | Defaults, APIs, deprecations |
| **T2 — Maintainer / platform** | Framework team blogs, platform engineering guides (version-matched) | Patterns endorsed by platform owners |
| **T3 — Corroborated senior** | Widely cited talks/posts **only when** aligned with T1/T2 or reproducible | Tradeoffs, operational wisdom |
| **Reject** | Random tutorials, outdated Stack Overflow, unversioned "best practices" | Do not cite as authority |

## Contract with style governance

Recommendations must reconcile with **this repo**: existing libs, ADRs, lint config, and [composer-coding-excellence](composer-coding-excellence.mdc) minimal-diff rules.

- **Apply now** — safe within the current task scope.
- **Follow-up plan** — style or tech-debt slice; do not drive-by refactor.

Never mass-fix unrelated modules based on external guidance alone.

See [reference.md](../skills/senior-practices/reference.md) for the compact checklist.
