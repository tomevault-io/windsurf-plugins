# Composer debugging

Use whenever something is broken, failing, flaky, or behaves unexpectedly. The goal is to find the cause, not silence the alarm.

Establish **reproduction in the parent** before spawning the debugger subagent (`.cursor/agents/debugger.md`), unless the task is explore-only. For parallel survey work, see [composer-orchestration](composer-orchestration.mdc).

## The debugging mindset

Bugs are not random. They have causes. Your job is to find the cause with the cheapest possible experiments, then fix it surgically.

Avoid the three classic anti-patterns:

1. **Symptom-patching**: making the error message disappear without understanding why it appeared.
2. **Guess-and-check**: changing things at random hoping it works.
3. **Premature theory**: committing to a hypothesis before evidence supports it.

## Step 1 — Reproduce reliably

Do not start fixing until you can reproduce. A bug you cannot reproduce is a bug you cannot fix; you can only paper over it.

- Find the **smallest reliable repro**: an exact command, input, route, or test case that triggers it.
- Note environment specifics: OS, runtime version, dependency versions, timing, concurrency, data state.
- If it's flaky, reproduce it **at least three times** before believing you have it.

If you genuinely cannot reproduce, say so and propose what data would let you (logs, a failing test, more user steps).

## Step 2 — Read the actual error

Read the **full** error message and stack trace, not just the first line.

- What component reported the error?
- What was the input/state at the failure point?
- What's the closest frame in code you control?
- What does the error message actually mean (look it up if unfamiliar)?

Common mistake: skimming a stack trace, picking a familiar-looking word, and chasing the wrong layer.

## Step 3 — Trace the data flow

Walk the path the bad value takes:

1. Where does it originate?
2. What transforms it along the way?
3. Where does it become wrong?
4. What invariant was violated, and where?

Use the cheapest tools first: read the code, then add a log/print, then a debugger, then a test. Don't reach for the heaviest tool first.

## Step 4 — Hypothesis ladder

List the possible causes from **most likely × cheapest to test** to least.

| Hypothesis | Test | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input validation drops field X | Log the input at boundary | low |
| Race condition between A and B | Add a deterministic delay; check ordering | medium |
| Library bug in version Y | Reproduce in a minimal isolated case | high |

Test cheapest first. Eliminate before you accuse.

## Step 5 — Find the root, not a symptom

When a hypothesis matches the evidence, ask **one more time**: "But why does *that* happen?"

- "The list is empty" — why? "The query returns nothing" — why? "The filter compares against the wrong field" — root.
- "Token is rejected" — why? "It's expired" — why? "The refresh job didn't run" — why? "Cron is misconfigured" — root.

Stop drilling when one more "why" leaves the system you're responsible for.

## Step 6 — Fix surgically and confirm

- Change the **minimum** that addresses the root cause.
- Add or update a test that **fails before the fix and passes after**. Run both directions.
- Re-run the original reproduction; confirm it no longer triggers.
- Check for adjacent code that has the same flaw.

## Symptom-patching is occasionally legitimate

If the root cause is genuinely out of scope (third-party library, infra owned by another team), patching the symptom can be the right move — **only if** you:

1. Document that it's a workaround, not a fix.
2. Reference the upstream issue or ticket where the real fix lives.
3. Add a TODO with conditions for removing the workaround.

Never silently mask a problem you don't understand.

## Working with flakiness

Flaky tests and intermittent bugs deserve the same root-cause discipline:

- Don't add retries to make CI green without understanding the flake.
- Don't increase timeouts blindly; find why something is slow.
- Don't mark a test `skip` to defer the problem; file an issue with the repro and link it.

## Never delete the failing test

A failing test is the most valuable artifact in the room. It's the bug, captured.

- Don't delete it.
- Don't comment it out.
- Don't change its assertions to match the broken behavior.
- Don't catch its expected error to silence it.

If the test itself is genuinely wrong, prove it (read the spec, talk to the author) before changing it.

## Reporting

When you report a fix, include:

1. **Symptom** the user saw.
2. **Root cause** you identified, with the evidence that confirms it.
3. **Fix** applied (file, function, what changed and why).
4. **Verification** — the test or command that proves it's fixed.
5. **Adjacent risks** — places with the same pattern, if any.
