# Cursor tools discipline

Tools are how you turn intent into evidence. Use them the way a senior engineer uses a debugger: deliberately, in the right order, and never as a substitute for reading.

## Pick the right tool

| Job | Right tool | Wrong tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read a file | structured file reader | `cat`, `head`, `tail` in shell |
| Find files by name | glob | `find`, `ls -R` |
| Search code by content | ripgrep / grep tool | `grep` in shell, full-file scans |
| Edit a file | structured edit tool | `sed`, `awk`, heredoc redirects |
| Run a command | shell | file tools |
| Hit an MCP server | the MCP tool, after reading its schema | guessing parameters |
| Heavy codebase search | built-in **Explore** subagent or parallel grep — parent keeps summary only | reading dozens of files sequentially in parent |
| Long or noisy shell output | built-in **Bash** subagent or background shell | pasting full logs into the user message |
| UI / browser verification | built-in **Browser** subagent; cite snapshot or screenshot evidence | "looks fine in the diff" |
| Specialist isolated work | Task / subagent with full prompt + return shape | vague "help me with this" delegation |

Using the wrong tool wastes the user's tokens and produces worse results.

## Parallelize independent work

Run **independent** discovery in parallel: multiple file reads, unrelated searches, web lookups that don't depend on each other. Send them in one batch, not sequentially.

Serialize only when there's a real dependency: read schema → call tool with those params; find the file → edit it.

For **independent subagent tracks**, batch Task calls in one message so they run in parallel. See [composer-orchestration](composer-orchestration.mdc) for when to delegate.

## Investigate progressively

Don't read megabytes when you need kilobytes. The default order:

1. **Orient** — list directory or glob the relevant area.
2. **Find** — search by symbol, identifier, or error message.
3. **Read** — open the specific file or function the search pointed to.
4. **Read more** — only when the first read leaves a real question open.

Re-reading the same files repeatedly is a signal you're guessing, not investigating.

## MCP and plugin tools

MCP surfaces change. Treat each one as untrusted-by-default until you've inspected it.

1. **Read the schema** before calling. Parameters, required fields, return shape.
2. **Auth deliberately** — only when a call fails for auth reasons; don't preemptively re-auth.
3. **Don't promise capabilities** that aren't in the live schema. Tool names and shapes drift across versions.
4. **Fallback gracefully** — if the MCP isn't available or fails, fall back to web docs or honest "blocked".

## Shell usage

- Prefer non-interactive flags (`-y`, `--no-input`, `CI=1`) so commands don't hang.
- Use the project's own scripts (`package.json`, `Makefile`, `justfile`) before reinventing equivalents.
- **Background** long-running processes; don't block the conversation on a 10-minute build.
- Tell the user how to check background output (terminal session, subagent output path).
- Quote paths with spaces. Don't pipe through unsafe shell substitution.
- Never run destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, DB drops) without explicit confirmation.

### Git commands

See [composer-core](composer-core.mdc) § Git remote safety. Default: **never push unprompted**.

| Allowed without extra ask | Requires explicit user ask in **this** turn |
| --- | --- |
| `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git add`, `git commit` (when user asked to commit) | `git push`, `git push -u`, `git push --force`, `git push --tags` |
| `gh pr view`, `gh pr checks`, read-only `gh` | Any command whose primary effect is updating `origin` |

**Anti-pattern:** Chaining `&& git push` at the end of "fix CI" or "create PR" scripts when the user did not say push.

## Background work and subagents

- Use **background** subagents or shells when the parent can make progress elsewhere; label assumptions until results return.
- **Stopping the parent stops child subagents** — avoid aborting mid-flight without noting impact.
- Subagent prompts need full context (subagents don't see chat history). See orchestration rule.

## Sandbox and network

- Prefer project scripts over ad-hoc installs when the sandbox allows.
- If a command fails for **network or permission** limits, report **blocked** with what allowlist or credential is needed — don't retry the same failing call indefinitely.
- Respect `sandbox.json` / org egress policy when documented.

## Web retrieval

When you need facts beyond the codebase:

- Prefer **primary** sources: official docs, RFCs, vendor pages, repo changelogs.
- Use the current date in queries when freshness matters; flag stale pages.
- For high-stakes claims (security, compliance, vendor behavior), corroborate with a second independent source.
- Cite what you actually opened. Don't list links you didn't read.

## Never fabricate tool output

This is the one inviolable rule of tool use.

- If a tool fails, say it failed.
- If a tool times out, say it timed out.
- If you ran a command and it printed nothing useful, say so.
- Don't invent plausible-looking output to fill a gap.
