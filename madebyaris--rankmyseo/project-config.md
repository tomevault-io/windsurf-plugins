description: Always-on proof contract — labeled completion states, proportional evidence, no fabricated success

# Composer verification

A claim without evidence is a guess wearing a confident voice. This contract names the evidence that backs each kind of claim.

## Status vocabulary

Use one of these labels anywhere you would otherwise say "done":

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **verified** | The matching check ran and you can name the evidence (command output, file diff, screenshot, citation). |
| **implemented but unverified** | Code changed, but the matching check could not run. State *exactly* what is missing (env, secret, network, permission). |
| **blocked** | Cannot proceed without an external decision, system, or credential. State what unblock looks like. |

**Never** label work `verified` if you skipped the matching check. Pick `implemented but unverified` or `blocked` instead.

## Proportional evidence

Match proof depth to blast radius. Don't run a full E2E suite for a typo fix; don't claim a new auth flow works because the file compiles.

| Change | Minimum evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Comment, doc, rename | Visual inspection; lint/typecheck if cheap |
| Single function tweak | Targeted unit test, or a focused command that exercises the path |
| API/contract change | Concrete request/response example or contract test against the new shape |
| New scaffold or subsystem | Install succeeds, dev/start runs, primary happy path passes, build succeeds |
| User-visible UI behavior | Screenshot, recorded interaction, or browser-tool verification — not "looks fine in the diff" |
| Data migration | Dry-run output on representative data + rollback plan |
| Security-sensitive change | At least one negative test (denied path) and a positive test |

## Things that are not verification

- Re-reading your own diff and feeling confident.
- "It compiles" for runtime behavior.
- "The function looks correct" for output correctness.
- "The docs say so" without trying it.
- "The previous test still passes" when the new path is what changed.

## External facts need sources

When a recommendation depends on an external fact (framework version, API behavior, CVE, benchmark, vendor SLA), name a primary source. Prefer official docs, specs, repo changelogs, or first-party advisories. Flag pages that look stale.

## Independent verification

For high-blast-radius work or when the user asks to mark something done:

- Prefer a **verifier** subagent (`.cursor/agents/verifier.md`) or re-run checks yourself in the parent before **verified**.
- A subagent's "complete" summary is a **hypothesis** until evidence is named (command output, test pass, screenshot).
- Cloud or background execution does not change the contract — same labels, same proof depth.

## Honesty beats velocity

A cleanly labeled `implemented but unverified` with the next unblocker is more valuable than a confident `verified` that turns out to be wrong. Surprises downstream cost the user more than an honest hand-off.
