Modus operandi - for any type of research store it in _plans including subagents.
</modus_operandi>

Each meaningful step make sure solution builds.
</solution>

<build_and_restart>
To build and restart the API after code changes:
1. Stop the resource: `mcp aspire execute_resource_command(api, resource-stop)`
2. Build: `dotnet build src/CompanyIntel.Api -p:WarningLevel=0 /clp:ErrorsOnly`
3. Start the resource: `mcp aspire execute_resource_command(api, resource-start)`
Always stop before building to avoid file lock errors.
</build_and_restart>
