# Adapted from anima a_paper_* / hexa-codex cx_paper_* into hexa-lang's
# bare snake_case directive convention (no hx_/hl_ prefix — matches
# diff_guard / wipe_guard / atlas_fold / stdlib_trig_libm).
#
# Paste this block into project.tape after stdlib_trig_libm, then
# `git add project.tape` (the sign token unlocks the agent edit).
#
# Infra already landed in this PR: CLAIMS.tape · .verdicts/ · PAPER/.
# Every `do =`/`dont =` value is ≤100 chars (hexa-lang lint cap).

# ── PAPER / capitalization policy → commons g84 (single SSOT · OPT-IN) ────
# Capitalization (paper / README-publish) is NOT proactive: the agent never proposes
# /paper nor auto-scaffolds on discovery. A verified discovery is logged (verdict +
# domain milestone) ONLY; a paper happens WHEN the user instructs it, gated by commons
# g84. verify discipline = commons g5. (Removed: ported claim_*/paper_*/discovery flow.)
