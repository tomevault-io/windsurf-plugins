## About the Project
This application is a .NET MAUI mobile and desktop application that generates a color style sheet (ResourceDictionary) based on a couple of supplied colors. 

The project code is in the /src folder

## .NET MAUI tips:

- Use `Border` instead of `Frame`
- Use `Grid` instead of `StackLayout`
- Use `CollectionView` instead of `ListView` for lists of greater than 20 items that should be virtualized
- Use `BindableLayout` with an appropriate layout inside a `ScrollView` for items of 20 or less that don't need to be virtualized
- Use `Background` instead of `BackgroundColor`
- When executing a build command, include a Target Framework Moniker (TFM) to ensure the correct platform is targeted. For example, use `net10.0-maccatalyst` for Mac Catalyst builds (which is a good default when running on a Mac). You can find the available TFMs for this project in the dotnet-colorthemes.csproj file.
