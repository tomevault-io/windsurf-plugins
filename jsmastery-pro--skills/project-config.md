# Project: Engineering Workflow Skills

A collection of Claude Code skills encoding a phase based engineering workflow. No mandated playbook: you run whichever skills a change needs, in whatever order fits. `/scope` recommends a workflow tier (`Vibe`/`Lean`/`Medium`/`Full`, how much verification a project or feature warrants), but it is a default you override per feature, never a forced track.

## Conventions every skill follows

- **The engineer decides; the AI recommends.** Any AI initiated verification or critique (e.g. `/architect`'s cross model spec check) is *offered*, never run or skipped on the engineer's behalf. Whatever such a check finds, a gap, a load bearing decision, a fix, is *surfaced to the engineer to decide*, never silently resolved or auto applied. A check the engineer invokes directly (`/check verify`, `/check review`) is already their choice to run, and still reports rather than auto fixes.
- **Every user facing question carries exactly one recommended option** with a one line why (make the call, let them override). Never a neutral menu, never a cold question, never a silent decision.
- **Keep skills lean.** A skill loads in full on its path every run, so every line is a recurring cost. Cut lines that don't change the agent's behavior, keep the reasoning in the commit or PR (not the skill body), name concepts instead of explaining them, and split out only rare, long content. Full guidance: [`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md). Run `npm run check` before committing skill edits.

## Layout

- Skills (source, for distribution via `npx skills`): `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Docs: `docs/workflow-guide.md` (what the workflow is and how it works) and `docs/conventions.md` (how to write skills). The "why" behind a change lives in its commit and PR, not a separate decision-record file.

## Skills

See `skills/` for available skills. (Consumers install them via `npx skills add JavaScript-Mastery-Pro/skills`, which lands them in their agent's skills dir, e.g. `.claude/skills/`.)
