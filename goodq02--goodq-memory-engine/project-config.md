# GoodQ4All Agent Operating Protocol

## Mission
- Operate and evolve GoodQ4All, a local-first multimodal memory and intelligence system on Windows 11 + NVMe with profile-gated GPU/WSL2 acceleration.
- Prioritize correctness, observability, and system integrity above novelty; production-verified, long-running, audit-driven.

## System Identity (non-negotiable)
- Local-first: no required cloud dependency to function.
- Scene-centric: scenes are the atomic unit of memory.
- Multimodal: audio, vision, text, embeddings, and knowledge graph.
- Persistent: SQLite + Knowledge Graph + Qdrant are authoritative.
- Auditable: failures must be visible, explainable, and logged.
- Resilient: optional enrichments may fail without halting ingestion.
- Not a demo system and not a stateless pipeline.

## Agent Knowledge Workspace
The primary workspace for agent onboarding, shared protocols, models and VRAM budgets, workflows, and historical lessons is located at the environment-relative path: `%USERPROFILE%\My Drive\_AGENT`. Future agents must reference this workspace for all persistent runbooks, environment capability checks via the bootstrap script (`bootstrap_agent.ps1`), and workspace verification rules (`verify_agent_workspace.py`).

## Canonical Runtime Model
- Primary host: Windows 11 desktop (source of truth).
- Secondary host: laptop (follower; aligns from desktop).
- GPU: optional by profile; `GPU_ENHANCED` uses local NVIDIA GPU (CUDA 12.1).
- Linux layer: optional by profile; WSL2 is used for accelerated audio paths.
- Vector store: Qdrant on port 6333 (canonical).
- Relational memory: SQLite; knowledge graph: SQLite-backed.
- Control plane: Watchdog + Control Agent + Config Healer.
- Assume long-running jobs and partial restarts are normal.

## Git Repository and Branch Governance (Anti-Drift)
- **Dev Repository**: `JoesDomingo/goodq4all` (`origin`) with the single canonical development branch `dev`.
- **Public Repository**: `GoodQ02/goodq4all` (`public`) with the single canonical release branch `main`.
- **No Stale Branches**: There are no other branches (such as `public/dev` or custom copilot/dependabot branches). Stale branches must be deleted immediately to prevent version drift.
- **Push Policy**: Local changes on `dev` are pushed to `origin dev`. When releasing/syncing to public, push local `dev` to `public main` (`git push public dev:main`) and push tags (e.g., `git push public v2.5.3`). Agents must never create or push to a `dev` branch on `public`.

## Agent Roles
- Pipeline Operator: ingestion, audits, backfills, validation.
- System Hardener: observability, error surfacing, stability.
- Memory Navigator: retrieval, querying, analysis.
- Developer Assistant: scoped, surgical code changes.
- Automation Assistant: local workflows, scripts, orchestration.
- No new architectures without explicit approval.

## Core Design Principles
- Surgical changes only: one file, minimal diff, explicit intent.
- Fail visible, not loud: replace silent failures with logging; raise only when instructed.
- Persistence over convenience: logs are ephemeral; manifests and memory are not.
- Desktop is canonical: laptop aligns from desktop, never the reverse.
- No speculative fixes: changes must be justified by audits, logs, or reports.

## Technical Standards
- Primary language: Python; secondary: TypeScript (UI/dashboards), minimal JS.
- Config: load via `config_loader`; avoid hardcoded paths.
- Isolation: conda/venv per role; no global pollution.
- GPU: Torch + CUDA 12.1 pinned and verified for `GPU_ENHANCED`; `BASELINE` must remain CPU-safe.
- WSL: treated as a compute extension, not a peer.
- Interpreter binding: avoid `conda activate`; prefer explicit `conda run -n <env> ...` using `steps.common.tool_paths.resolve_conda()` (Python) or `scripts/_lib/interpreter_bindings.ps1`/`.bat` (shell).
- WSL binding: use `GOODQ_WSL_DISTRO` (default `Ubuntu`) and always invoke `wsl -d <distro> -- ...` for distro-scoped commands.

## Vector and Memory Rules
- Embeddings generated per scene, persisted via MemoryRouter, stored in Qdrant + FAISS when enabled.
- Knowledge Graph is authoritative for entities, relationships, and temporal context.
- Phase 6b (harmonization) depends on persistent scene manifests; missing manifests are errors unless explicitly allowed.

## Observability and Audits
- Replace `except:` with `except Exception as e:` plus logging only in critical paths.
- Preserve fail-safe behavior unless instructed otherwise.
- Never suppress errors without recording them.
- Preferred logging levels: warning (recoverable failure), error (action required), debug (high-volume, optional context).

## Operational Protocol (mandatory)
1. State intent: 1-2 sentences describing the next action.
2. Scope lock: declare files touched and what will not be changed.
3. Execute minimally: no refactors or opportunistic cleanup.
4. Validate: targeted checks only; no full reruns unless approved.
5. Handoff: what changed, how to verify, next steps (optional).

## Iterative Repair Protocol (mandatory for pipeline fixes)
When repairing pipeline quality, scene truth, or witness failures:

1. Identify one concrete seam, not a broad category.
