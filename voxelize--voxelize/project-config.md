# Documentation Agent Guidelines

This file contains guidelines for AI agents working on Voxelize documentation updates.

## Documentation Structure

The docs live in `voxelize/docs/` and use Docusaurus 3.x with these sections:

- **`docs/tutorials/`** - Step-by-step guides for getting started
- **`docs/wiki/`** - In-depth explanations of concepts and patterns
- **`docs/api/`** - Auto-generated from TypeDoc (do not edit directly)

API docs are auto-generated from `@voxelize/core` and `@voxelize/protocol` packages via `docusaurus-plugin-typedoc`. The source code lives in `voxelize/packages/core/src/` and `voxelize/packages/protocol/src/`.

### Sidebar Configuration

- `sidebars/tutorials.js` - Tutorial sidebar
- `sidebars/wiki.js` - Wiki sidebar
- `sidebars/api.js` - API sidebar (auto-generated)

## Writing Style

Direct and human. No fluff:

- One sentence to explain what something does
- Show code right after
- Use `title="Description"` on code blocks
- Keep it short - code speaks louder
- Use contrasts when helpful (e.g., "Unlike events, methods run world-wide")
- No AI phrases like "In this section we will..." or "Let's explore..." - just get to the point

### Examples

Every feature needs a real example. No hand-waving.

Structure:

1. **Name it** (e.g., "Example: Discord Bot Bridge")
2. **What problem does it solve?** One sentence.
3. **Show the code** - break into steps if needed
4. **Full implementation** at the end for copy-paste

Bad:

```
Here's how to use onChat:
[code block]
```

Good:

```
## Example: Discord Bot Bridge

Announces when players chat in your game.

[code showing how to set it up]

### Full Implementation
[complete, runnable code]
```

Use sequence diagrams (mermaid) when the flow is complex. Skip them if it's obvious.

### Code References

When showing code blocks, prefer referencing real code from the codebase when possible:

1. **Point to tutorial source code** - If there's a working example in `examples/` or the tutorial project, reference the file path so readers can see full context
2. **Include "Full Implementation" sections** - After step-by-step breakdowns, show the complete, runnable code
3. **Link to town project patterns** - When a pattern exists in `client/src/` or `server/src/`, mention it as a real-world reference

Example reference style:

```
See the full implementation in `examples/client/src/main.ts`.
```

Or at the end of a tutorial section:

```
### Full Implementation

Here's the complete code from this section:

\`\`\`ts title="examples/client/src/main.ts"
// complete runnable code
\`\`\`
```

This helps readers:

- Verify the code actually works
- See surrounding context
- Copy-paste without missing pieces

### Code Block Format

Always use language + title:

```ts title="Client Setup"
const world = new VOXELIZE.World();
```

```rust title="Server Definition"
world.set_method_handle("my_method", |world, client_id, payload| {
  // ...
});
```

### Import Conventions

Client-side TypeScript always uses:

```ts
import * as VOXELIZE from "@voxelize/core";
import * as THREE from "three";
```

Server-side Rust uses standard Voxelize crate imports.

## Finding Examples

When documenting a class or feature:

1. **Check the town project first** - Real-world usage in `client/src/core/` and `client/src/components/`
2. **Check the packages source** - Implementation details in `voxelize/packages/core/src/`
3. **Check existing wiki pages** - Patterns and conventions in `voxelize/docs/docs/wiki/`

### Key Source Locations

| Feature    | Town Usage                      | Source Code                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Characters | `client/src/core/peers.ts`      | `packages/core/src/libs/character.ts`   |
| Entities   | `client/src/core/entities/*.ts` | `packages/core/src/libs/entities.ts`    |
| Peers      | `client/src/core/peers.ts`      | `packages/core/src/libs/peers.ts`       |
| World      | N/A                             | `packages/core/src/core/world/index.ts` |
| Blocks     | `client/src/core/blocks.ts`     | `packages/core/src/core/world/`         |
| Events     | Used in components              | `packages/core/src/libs/events.ts`      |
| Methods    | Used in components              | `packages/core/src/libs/method.ts`      |

## Updating Documentation

### For API Classes (Arrow, Character, etc.)

The API reference is auto-generated but often lacks good examples. To improve:

1. Read the source in `packages/core/src/`
2. Find real usage in `client/src/core/` or `client/src/components/`
3. Add a practical example to the class's JSDoc in the source file
4. The TypeDoc plugin will include it in the generated docs

Example of good JSDoc in source:

````ts
/**
 * A helper for visualizing a direction.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const arrow = new VOXELIZE.Arrow();
 * arrow.position.set(10, 0, 10);
 * arrow.setDirection(new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0));
 * world.add(arrow);
 * ```
 */
````

### For Wiki Pages

1. Start with a one-sentence description of what the feature does
2. Explain how it differs from related features (if applicable)
3. Show server-side code first (if fullstack)
4. Show client-side code second
