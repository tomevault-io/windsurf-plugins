## Project Overview
Sensa is a wearable air quality monitor running embedded AI on an ESP32-S3. It reads PM1/2.5/4/10, VOC index, NOx index, temperature, and humidity from a Sensirion SEN55 sensor and performs on-device calibration and classification using TensorFlow Lite Micro.

## Team
This project is built by a team of **electrical engineers**, not software engineers. All code must include comments that explain what the code is doing and why — do not assume familiarity with C++ patterns, embedded conventions, or build tooling.

## Repo Structure
```

## Language & Toolchain
- C++17, Arduino framework, PlatformIO
- Target board: ESP32-S3 (`rymcu-esp32-s3-devkitc-1`)
- Build: `pio run`
- Upload: `pio run --target upload`
- Serial monitor: `pio device monitor`
- Run tests: `~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio test -e native`

## Key Types (include/types.h)
- `Reading` — raw timestamped sensor sample (PM1/2.5/4/10, temp, RH, VOC, NOx)
- `FeatureVector` — aggregated statistics over a rolling window (~20–30 features)
- `Classification` — enum: GOOD, MODERATE, UNHEALTHY, VERY_UNHEALTHY, HAZARDOUS, UNKNOWN

## AQI Classification Thresholds (PM2.5 µg/m³)
Thresholds are defined as named constants in `include/aqi_thresholds.h` — do not use magic numbers in code.
See that file for values and the EPA source reference.

## AI / ML Constraints
- Sample rate: 1–2 Hz; window: 5–10 s; overlap: 50%
- Feature set: ~20–30 features per window (mean, median, std, IQR, min/max, slope, rolling variance, % above threshold, short-lag autocorr)
- Model types: tiny Random Forest, 1D-CNN, or DS-CNN (TFLite Micro, int8 quantized)
- Edge footprint: ≤30–100 KB weights; ≤128 KB RAM at runtime
- Inference latency target: <10–30 ms; feature extraction: <50–100 ms; end-to-end: <150 ms
- Accuracy target: ≥85% class agreement vs. reference sensor on unseen sessions
- Static tensor arena — document RAM usage; no dynamic allocation in inference path

## Data Pipeline (on-device)
```
SEN55 read → preprocess (warm-up discard, outlier clamp, EMA smoothing, T/RH compensation)
           → ring buffer → feature extraction → TFLite Micro inference → class label
           → BLE GATT notify (PM values, class label, battery, config characteristic)
```

## BLE / Communication
- BLE GATT service exposes three characteristics:
  - `...26a8` — PM2.5 float (kept for Python client backwards compat)
  - `...26a9` — classification label (uint8)
  - `...26aa` — full `Reading` struct as a packed 36-byte payload: `uint32 ts_ms` + 8× `float32` (pm1, pm2_5, pm4, pm10, temp_c, rh, voc_index, nox_index), all little-endian
- Web dashboard in `webapp/` connects via Web Bluetooth (Chrome/Edge only); unpacks `...26aa` using `DataView`
- For early development: stream raw data to PC via serial monitor before BLE integration

## Power / Battery
- Target: ≥8–12 hours continuous at 1–2 Hz updates
- Low-power pattern: MCU + sensor sleep between reads; wake every ~60 s, take 10 s of data, run ML, transmit over BLE
- Refer to SEN55 low-power operation guide for reduced-power modes

## Unit Testing Setup
- Framework: **GoogleTest** via PlatformIO native environment
- Portable logic lives in `lib/` (no Arduino headers) and is tested on the host machine
- Test files live in `test/native/test_<name>/test_main.cpp`
- Each test file must include its own `main()`:
  ```cpp
  int main(int argc, char **argv) {
      ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
      if (RUN_ALL_TESTS()) ;
      return 0;
  }
  ```
- Run with: `~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio test -e native`

### Known Gotchas (Ubuntu 24.04 / GCC 13)
- **Never name a project header `features.h`** — it shadows glibc's system `features.h` and causes cascading build failures. Use a unique name like `feature_extraction.h`.
- The `lib/<name>/src/` include path is added to the compiler search path, so any filename that matches a system header will silently shadow it.
- `std::sqrt(float)` is ambiguous on GCC 13 — always cast to `double`: `(float)std::sqrt((double)x)`

## Guidelines for AI Agents

### General
- Do not modify `include/types.h` shared types without updating all dependent files
- Prefer stack allocation over heap allocation (embedded constraints)
- Avoid dynamic memory allocation (`new`/`malloc`) in hot paths
