# AI Agent Guidelines

This repository ships package code, browser adapters, and a generated static documentation site. Work from the canonical sources and treat generated artifacts as build output.

## Source of truth

- Package code lives in `src/` and `resources/js/`.
- Static documentation source lives in `docs/md/`.
- Generated documentation output lives in `docs/*.html`, `docs/search-index.json`, `docs/sitemap.xml`, and `docs/.nojekyll`, and those files must never be edited manually.
- The documentation builder is `docs/build.php`, with layout and UI in `docs/template.php` and `docs/assets/`.
- All contributor and AI-agent guidance lives in this root `AGENTS.md`. Do not create or rely on nested `AGENTS.md` files for `docs/`.

## Required workflow

### Package code changes

1. Change the canonical PHP or JavaScript source.
2. Run the narrowest relevant tests first.
3. Run `composer test` before finishing a meaningful code change.
4. Rebuild docs when public behavior, configuration, or examples changed.

### Repository workflow changes

1. Update this root `AGENTS.md` when changing project structure, supported integrations, build or test commands, generated artifact locations, or documentation workflow.
2. Keep commands, paths, and workflow notes in sync with `composer.json`, `package.json`, and the current repository layout.

### Documentation changes

1. Edit Markdown files in `docs/md/`.
2. Run `php docs/build.php` or `composer docs:build`.
3. Verify the generated HTML, search index, and sitemap in `docs/`.
4. Commit the Markdown source and the regenerated output together.

### Documentation standards

1. Every page in `docs/md/` should include YAML frontmatter with at least `title`, `description`, `order`, and `slug`.
2. Use `##` and `###` headings so the builder can generate the table of contents.
3. Include at least one practical example and explain expected behavior, not just syntax.
4. Use fenced code blocks with a language whenever possible.
5. Do not add a top-level Markdown `# H1`; the template renders the page title from frontmatter.

### Internal documentation links

1. Use relative Markdown links such as `./installation.md` and `./usage.md#hooks`.
2. Only add heading fragments when the target heading is stable.
3. If you rename a heading, slug, or anchor, update every dependent link in the same change.

## Project overview

Laravel Client Validation converts Laravel validation rules into client-side behavior and supports Alpine.js, Livewire, Filament, vanilla JavaScript, React, and Vue flows. The repository also ships a generated static documentation site and an NPM package surface for browser adapters and core validators.

## Architecture

### PHP

- `src/Core/` contains rule parsing, validation context, and directive generation.
- `src/Contracts/` defines the service-layer interfaces.
- `src/Http/Controllers/` handles AJAX validation endpoints.
- `src/Livewire/` contains Livewire integration.
- `src/Filament/` contains Filament integration.

### JavaScript

- `resources/js/core/` contains `LaravelValidator`, `RuleRegistry`, `RemoteValidator`, and the individual rule implementations.
- `resources/js/adapters/` contains Alpine, vanilla, Livewire, React, and Vue adapters.
- `resources/js/index.js` and `resources/js/index.d.ts` are the main browser entry points.
- `package.json` exposes subpath exports such as `./core`, `./alpine`, `./vanilla`, `./livewire`, `./react`, and `./vue`.
- `resources/js/dist/` is generated output. Do not hand-edit it.

### Documentation system

- `docs/md/*.md` files are canonical and use YAML frontmatter.
- `docs/build.php` scans markdown, parses frontmatter, converts Markdown to HTML with `league/commonmark`, builds navigation and search metadata, and writes generated HTML, `.nojekyll`, `search-index.json`, and `sitemap.xml` into `docs/`.
- `.github/workflows/build-docs.yml` rebuilds and deploys the generated docs on pushes to `main`.

## Code style

### PHP

- Follow PSR-12.
- Target PHP 8.2+.
- Prefer straightforward typed code and small, readable changes.
- Run `composer pint` after PHP edits when formatting is needed.
- Run `composer analyse` when touching static-analysis-sensitive surfaces.

### JavaScript

- Use ES modules only.
- Keep the code in plain JavaScript with JSDoc where it adds clarity.
- Keep comments sparse and useful.
- Place each rule in its own file under `resources/js/core/rules/`.

### Rule function signature

All client-side validation rules must keep this signature:

```javascript
export default function ruleName(value, params, field, context = {}) {
    return boolean;
}
```

## Testing and validation commands

### PHP

```bash
composer test
composer test-coverage
composer analyse
composer format
```

### JavaScript

```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run build
```

### Documentation

```bash
php docs/build.php
composer docs:build
```

## Common tasks

### Adding a new validation rule

1. Add the rule implementation in `resources/js/core/rules/`.
2. Export it from `resources/js/core/rules/index.js`.
3. Register the default message in `resources/js/core/RuleRegistry.js`.
