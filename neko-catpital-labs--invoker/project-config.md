# Landing a PR stack safely

When the user asks to **land / merge / ship / queue** a PR or PR stack, treat
`skills/land-stack/SKILL.md` as the source of truth. Before queueing, labeling
(`admin-bypass`), resolving review threads, or merging **any** PR:

- **Use confirmed PR numbers** (bottom of stack first). If the user does not
  provide them, make a best-effort read-only discovery pass by broadly listing
  open PRs, filtering to `stack/` heads, checking local head SHAs, ordering by
  base/head links, and suggesting the bottom-up numbers for confirmation. Never
  discover the PR to land by branch name — do not use `gh pr list --head <branch>`.
  Two different PRs can share a branch name.
- **Run the guard, which must exit 0:**
  `node scripts/land-stack.mjs <pr> [<pr> ...]`
  It verifies each PR's head SHA exists locally, the head branch is a real
  `stack/` branch, the PRs form a proper stack, and all are OPEN.
- **Land only via** `node scripts/land-stack.mjs <pr> ... --execute`. Do not
  hand-add `admin-bypass` or run `gh pr merge` to bypass the guard.

Incident this prevents: a raw workflow-branch PR (#505) shared a branch name
with the intended stack (#2174 / #2175); landing by branch name queued the
wrong PR.
