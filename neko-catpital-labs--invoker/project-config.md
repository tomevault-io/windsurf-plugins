description: Skill and slash-command workflow overrides ad-hoc "just implement it" requests

# Skill and slash-command precedence

When **any** of these apply for the current user message, treat the linked **skill** as the source of truth for how to work—not optional context:

- The user runs a Cursor **slash command** whose stub says to use a skill (e.g. `/plan-to-invoker`).
- The user **attaches** a skill to the message.
- The user explicitly invokes a documented skill name or path.

**First action:** Read the skill file (e.g. `skills/plan-to-invoker/SKILL.md` or `.cursor/skills/plan-to-invoker/SKILL.md` after clone setup). If `SKILL.md` is missing under `.cursor/skills/plan-to-invoker`, run `bash scripts/setup-agent-skills.sh` from the repo root, then re-check.

## plan-to-invoker (hard stops)

Until the user confirms the workflow is complete:

1. Do **not** edit application or library code under `packages/` (or other product paths) for the substantive request.
2. Follow the skill: scope → Phase 1a → Phase 1b (`pnpm test` / headless as applicable) → implementation YAML from facts → `bash skills/plan-to-invoker/scripts/skill-doctor.sh <plan-file>` → present plan → **wait for user confirmation** before `./submit-plan.sh` or before coding.

Treat free text after `/plan-to-invoker` as **input to the skill workflow**, not a directive to implement immediately.

## Delegation hints in YAML (best effort)

Recommended headings in task `description` (`Files:`, `Change types:`, `Acceptance criteria:`) are **best effort**—plans can miss files or gain scope later. They are **not** enforced by default `skill-doctor`; optional warnings: `bash skills/plan-to-invoker/scripts/lint-task-atomicity.sh --warn-delegation <plan.yaml>`. See `skills/plan-to-invoker/references/task-patterns.md` and `references/efficacy-rubric.md`.
