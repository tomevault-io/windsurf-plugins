# Invoker Project Instructions

## Planning Rules

### Slash commands and agent skills

- **Precedence:** When a Cursor slash command or an **attached skill** says to follow a skill (e.g. `/plan-to-invoker`), that workflow **overrides** a bare “implement this” sentence in the same message. Complete the skill steps (including `bash skills/plan-to-invoker/scripts/skill-doctor.sh <plan-file>` and user confirmation) before editing product code for that request.
- **Bootstrap after clone:** Run `bash scripts/setup-agent-skills.sh` to build the CLI/app artifacts and install bundled `invoker-*` skills into Codex, Claude, and Cursor. Optional: `bash scripts/test-plan-to-invoker-skill.sh` when changing skill layout.
- **Repo rule:** See `.cursor/rules/skill-command-precedence.mdc` for the always-on summary.
- **Benchmark direct output:** If a `/plan-to-invoker` request says `For this benchmark`, `Required output path:`, `Write the final YAML plan to`, or `Do not submit the plan`, write a complete command-only YAML plan directly to the literal required path. The first top-level keys must be `name:`, `onFinish:`, `mergeMode:`, `repoUrl:`, and `tasks:`. Do not write `version:` or `metadata:` wrappers. Do not run `git remote`, `env`, `printenv`, `set`, schema scans, validation loops, submit commands, prompt tasks, nested `steps:`, or anything that can trigger an agent/autofix. If no repo URL is provided, use `https://github.com/Neko-Catpital-Labs/Invoker.git`.

- Implementation plans must include a user-confirmed `Safety invariant:` for every slice; follow `skills/review-compression/SKILL.md` and ask before finalizing.
- Every step in a plan MUST be testable. Each implementation step must have a corresponding verification with a concrete, executable command that produces a clear pass/fail exit code (e.g. `pnpm test`, `git diff --name-only`). Do not use AI prompts for test tasks — use commands only.
- Bug fix plans MUST follow a three-phase approach before any implementation:
  1. **Reproduce** -- Find or write a concrete reproduction case (a failing test or a command that demonstrates the bug). Report back the exact repro steps and observed vs. expected behavior. Do not proceed until the bug is reliably reproducible.
  2. **Debug and report** -- Investigate and report: (a) the root cause — why the code is in the buggy state, and (b) the test gap — how the bug escaped existing tests (missing coverage, wrong assumptions, untested edge case, etc.). For a UI or runtime behavior bug, instrument or trace the actual failing behavior first (logging, a MutationObserver, a debugger, a targeted repro) before proposing a fix hypothesis. Do not propose a root cause by pattern-matching to a bug that looks similar; a hypothesis that was not directly observed is a guess and must be stated as one until it is.
  3. **Plan the fix** -- Only after completing steps 1 and 2, create the implementation plan. The plan must include a verification step that re-runs the reproduction case to confirm the fix.

## Landing PR Stacks

- When asked to **land / merge / ship / queue** a PR or PR stack, follow `skills/land-stack/SKILL.md`.
- Never choose a PR by branch-name lookup (`gh pr list --head <branch>`). Two PRs can share a branch name (a raw workflow branch PR vs the intended `stack/...` PR). If PR numbers are missing, broadly list open PRs, filter to `stack/` heads, verify local head SHAs, order by base/head links, and suggest bottom-up numbers for confirmation. Land by confirmed PR number only.
- Verify before any write: `node scripts/land-stack.mjs <pr> [<pr> ...]` must exit 0 (checks head SHA is in the local clone, head branch is a real `stack/` branch, the PRs form a proper stack, all OPEN). Land via `node scripts/land-stack.mjs <pr> ... --execute`. Do not hand-add `admin-bypass` or `gh pr merge` to bypass the guard.
- See `.cursor/rules/land-stack-precedence.mdc` for the always-on summary.

## SQLite Command Policy

- If you are considering direct SQLite commands, use the corresponding Invoker headless command first.
- For normal local operations on workflows or tasks, prefer `./run.sh --headless ...` and `node scripts/headless-ipc.js ...` over SQLite reads or writes. Typical examples: `query workflows`, `query tasks`, `retry`, `retry-task`, `rebase-recreate`, `approve`, `reject`, `cancel`, and `cancel-workflow`.
- Verify operational changes with Invoker query commands (`query workflows`, `query tasks`, `query queue`, `query audit`) instead of SQLite inspection whenever the command surface exists.
- If no corresponding headless command exists, stop and prompt the user with a concrete plan to add that headless command functionality before proceeding.

## Testing Architecture

All packages use standard `vitest run` via `pnpm test`. The persistence layer uses `sql.js` (WASM-based SQLite), so tests run under system Node with no native SQLite addon or Electron test runtime.
