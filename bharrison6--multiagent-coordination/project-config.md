# Cross-Agent Coordination Protocol

This configuration applies to all repositories in `C:\github\`.

**Owner:** dover
**Repository Root:** Contains multiple project repositories. Each repo has its own STANDARDS.md with project-specific technical rules.

## How to Use This Configuration

This file contains **ONLY cross-agent coordination protocol**. For project-specific technical rules, see each repository's `STANDARDS.md` file.

**When working in a specific repo:**
1. Navigate to that repo's directory
2. Read that repo's `STANDARDS.md` for all technical rules

**Shared integration workflows** (reusable, project-agnostic patterns established across projects):
- See `C:\GitHub\workflows\` — before implementing any new integration from scratch, check here first
- Current guides: Google Apps Script + clasp (`workflows\google-apps-script-clasp.md`)

## Cross-Agent Activity Logging

Multiple AI agents (Claude, Gemini, Codex) work in this repository. To coordinate effectively, all agents must log their activity.

### Before Starting Work

1. **Read `<repo>\.agent-log\changelog.md` by direct path** - Review recent changes by all agents. Always use a direct file Read by absolute path — do NOT rely on Glob or directory listings to confirm these files exist. On Windows, Glob can silently miss files in `.agent-log\` directories. Only if Read returns "file not found" can you safely assume the file is absent.
2. **Read `<repo>\.agent-log\handoffs.md` by direct path** - Check for pending tasks or blockers. Same rule: direct Read only, never Glob.
3. **Read repo standards** - Navigate to the specific repo and read its `STANDARDS.md`

### Root-Level vs Repo-Level Logging

- **Repo-level** (`<repo>\.agent-log\`): Use for all work within a specific repository
- **Root-level** (`C:\github\.agent-log\`): Use for:
  - Protocol/config changes (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md edits)
  - Cross-repo tasks spanning multiple repositories
  - System-level reviews or coordination work
- When logging to root, use `Repo: ROOT` instead of a repo name
- Root log uses **absolute paths**; repo logs use **paths relative to repo root**

### During Work

- Follow the technical standards defined in the repo's `STANDARDS.md`
- Check for duplicate work before implementing new features
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns

### After Completing Work

1. **Log to `<repo>\.agent-log\changelog.md`** with this format:
   ```
   ### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] GEMINI [ACTION_TYPE]
   - Description of changes
   - Repo: <repo-name>
   - Files modified: <paths from repo root>
   - Notes: Important context for other agents
   - PENDING: (optional) What needs follow-up
   ```

2. **Action types:** `[IMPLEMENT]`, `[REFACTOR]`, `[FIX]`, `[TEST]`, `[CONFIG]`, `[DOCS]`, `[REVIEW]`

3. **If handing off incomplete work:** Update `<repo>\.agent-log\handoffs.md` with:
   - What was completed
   - What's still pending
   - Any blockers or issues
   - Which agent should continue

4. **Agent log files are append-only — never overwrite their contents.** Always Read the file first, then add your new entry while preserving all existing content. Only create a file fresh if Read confirmed the file does not exist.

### Update Check Triggers

Re-read configuration files when:
- Another agent logs "updated standards" or "updated config" in changelog
- You see unfamiliar code patterns in existing files
- More than 24 hours since your last session
- Build errors suggest API changes

## Multi-Agent Best Practices

### Coordination

- **No Duplication:** Always check changelog before implementing new features
- **Clear Handoffs:** Use handoffs.md when leaving incomplete work
- **Log Everything:** Better to over-communicate than under-communicate
- **Respect Standards:** Follow each repo's STANDARDS.md strictly
- **Preserve Logs:** Never overwrite `changelog.md` or `handoffs.md`. Always Read first and append your entry. Overwriting destroys other agents' history and handoff data.

### Agent Roles

- **Claude CLI:** Terminal-based, navigates filesystem, sees full repo context
- **Claude IDE:** IDE-based, opened at repo or project level, reads CLAUDE.md
- **Gemini CLI:** Terminal-based, navigates filesystem, sees full repo context
- **Gemini IDE:** IDE-based, opened at repo or project level, reads GEMINI.md
- **Codex CLI:** Terminal-based, navigates filesystem, sees full repo context
- **Codex IDE:** IDE-based, opened at repo or project level, reads AGENTS.md
