# Copilot Instructions - WaveGains App

This is a React TypeScript application for hypertrophy periodization training programs. The project uses:

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Key Design Principles

- **Evidence-based**: All periodization models should be based on scientific literature
- **User-focused**: Interface should be intuitive for different experience levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading and smooth interactions

## Architecture Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all data structures
- Keep state management simple with useState/useEffect (no localStorage requirement)
- Create reusable components with proper prop interfaces
- Use custom hooks for complex logic

## Periodization Models to Implement

1. **Linear Traditional**: Gradual progression (volume ↓, intensity ↑)
2. **Undulating (DUP)**: Weekly or daily variation
3. **Block Periodization**: Accumulation → Transmutation → Realization phases
4. **Conjugate Method**: Simultaneous training of different qualities

## Code Style

- Use arrow functions for components
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for user feedback
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow the established color scheme (primary: blue, secondary: green, dark theme support)

## File Organization

- Components in `/src/components/`
- Hooks in `/src/hooks/`
- Utils in `/src/utils/`
- Types in `/src/types/`
- Data/constants in `/src/data/`
