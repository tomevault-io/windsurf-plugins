description: Treat compiler/Rust warnings as hard errors — fix root cause, never hide
---


# Warnings are errors (no hiding)

**Why:** Green exit codes with a wall of warnings ship rot. The owner treats
warnings as build failures.

## Hard rule

- A warning in **Metal first-party** or **Metal-patched third_party** is a
  **hard error**. Do not declare the task done until it is gone.
- **Do not** paper over with `-Wno-*`, `#pragma`, `#[allow(...)]`, or
  log filters unless the warning is in **unmodified upstream** that Metal
  does not own (the `-Wno-*` set on the µPy core in `port/upy.mk` only).
- Prefer the **correct type/control-flow fix** over silencing.

## Required agent habit

1. Scan the full build log for `warning:` / `unused` / `-W` after every
   build you run (host, upy, browser, firmware, `cargo test`, `dev-up`).
2. If warnings appear: **stop**, fix root cause, rebuild, prove clean.
3. Do not say "OK" / mark todos complete while warnings remain in scope.

## Polyglot: three layers of "used"

Do not confuse rustc `dead_code`, a missing face, and runtime callers.
There is no static matrix to consult — ask the live registry.

| Layer | Question | Soft? |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Missing face** | Does the card show up on this seat — `pm_wasmmod_registry_module_at` / `export_at` after boot? | **No** — a card that never registers is a gap. |
| **rustc `dead_code`** | Reachable in this compiled TU/crate? | Private rot = error. Public / `#[no_mangle]` / registered via `PM_MOD_EXPORT_RS!` = used. |
| **Runtime call** | Did someone invoke it via that language? | **Yes** — an unused caller is normal; do not delete faces for it. |

Rules:

- `PM_MOD_EXPORT_C` / `PM_MOD_EXPORT_RS!` makes the compiler see a symbol as
  used **and** puts it in the registry — that is the same act, not two.
- Fix a gap by registering the missing face, never by loosening the prove
  that walks the registry.
- Host vs freestanding: compile only what the target owns (`cfg` /
  `PM_WASMMOD_GUEST`); do not `#[allow(dead_code)]` optional faces.
- Never delete a face to silence rustc; register it or `cfg` the whole
  export out of that image.

## Examples

```text
BAD:  -Wno-unused-function on vendor lfs because asserts are no-ops
GOOD: #define LFS_NO_ASSERT so unused assert helpers are not compiled

BAD:  ignore -Wsign-compare in wireguard base64 loops
GOOD: use size_t indices / cast byte counts correctly

BAD:  cargo test green while lib emits 17 dead_code warnings you introduced
GOOD: fix or gate dead code; do not grow #![allow(dead_code)]

BAD:  drop the assert so a seat missing the card still proves green
GOOD: register the card on that seat; keep the registry walk strict
```
