description: No long-running non-yielding operation anywhere in Metal (not just wasm/async guest code) — the check is cheap, blocking everyone else is not

# No long-running non-yielding operations, anywhere

**Not guest-specific.** This applies to host code, kernel code, wasm guests,
async tasks — everywhere in Metal, not a special wasm/async-only rule.

## The actual test

It's an economic comparison, not a blanket "always yield": **schedule/check
cost vs. the cost of not checking.** Measured on this project's own hardware
(see `registration_rethink_scope`'s quiesce/safepoint design): a periodic
liveness/safepoint check (an uncontended atomic flag load + not-taken branch)
costs **~0.3% overhead even done on every single call**, the pessimistic
upper bound — done at the coarser granularity it's actually meant for (once
per task step, not once per call), it's unmeasurable. The cost of *not*
checking — stalling every other runner's fairness, and stalling any
load/unload quiesce that depends on every runner reaching a checkpoint
within bounded time — is unbounded by comparison. That asymmetry means the
bar for "this is short enough to skip a yield/check point" is very high:
only genuinely tiny, provably-bounded-time operations get a pass. Anything
whose duration is unpredictable or non-trivial must be broken into steps
that yield/check periodically.

## Concrete rule

Any loop or operation whose duration is not providably tiny and bounded
must incorporate a periodic yield/check point. When choosing how often to
check, default to checking **more** often, not less — per the measurement
above, the check itself is close to free; the failure mode of checking too
rarely (stalling fairness, stalling a quiesce) is not.

## Why this is load-bearing for two things, not one

1. **Scheduler fairness** — a step that never yields already breaks
   cooperative scheduling today, independent of the registry design.
2. **The registry's quiesce/safepoint mechanism** (load/unload of an
   unloadable module) depends on every runner reaching a checkpoint within
   bounded time to ever complete — a violation here doesn't just cost that
   one task's fairness, it can stall a load/unload indefinitely.
