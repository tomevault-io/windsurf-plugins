description: Metal core uses one uniform C type spelling everywhere; EDK2 types/headers are physically confined to boot platform ports

# Metal C dialect (no UEFI types outside boot/platform/{efi,bios}/**)

Full rule + rationale: [`docs/SOURCETREE.md`](../../docs/SOURCETREE.md) → "C dialect".

**Why this is strict, not a style nit:** the user (project owner) is autistic
and reading code where the same type has two spellings (`UINT32` vs
`uint32_t`, `VOID` vs `void`) is a genuine, non-trivial extra cognitive load
for their pattern matching — even though the types are typedef-identical.
Treat "one spelling per type, everywhere in shared code" as load-bearing,
not negotiable, not a nice-to-have. Do not push back on this or suggest
relaxing it.

`src/pymergetic/metal/**` (**all of it, zero exceptions**) is **normal C**:

- Types: `int32_t` / `uint32_t` / `bool` / `void` / `const` / `char` — from `<stdint.h>` / `<stdbool.h>` etc.
- Linkage: `static`, not `STATIC`
- Unused: `(void)x`, not `(VOID)x`

**Banned anywhere in `src/pymergetic/metal/**` outside platform ports,
no filename-based exception:**

- `#include <Uefi.h>`, `#include <Library/*.h>`, `#include <Protocol/*.h>`, `#include <IndustryStandard/*.h>`
- `INT32` / `UINT32` / `UINTN` / `VOID` / `STATIC` / `CONST` / `CHAR8` / `BOOLEAN`
- bare `int` / `unsigned` / `long` / `short` for quantities (use stdint)

A file does **not** get to include EDK2 headers just because it's named
`*_port.c`/`*_port.h`. The **only** thing that makes EDK2 OK is physical
location under `src/.../boot/platform/efi/**` or `.../bios/**`. If Metal
logic genuinely needs one EDK2 primitive, declare a plain stdint-typed
prototype in the shared file (no body) and put the implementation in the
matching platform port body.

**Verify:** `grep -rlE '#include\s*<(Uefi\.h|Library/|Protocol/|IndustryStandard/)' src/pymergetic/metal --include=*.c --include=*.h` must return **nothing** outside `boot/platform/{efi,bios}/**`. Run after touching any file here.

Do not add a compat header that `#define UINT32 uint32_t` — convert call sites.

Prefer Metal/libc APIs (`pm_metal_log`, `memset`/`memcpy`/`memcmp`/`strcmp`/`strlen`, `snprintf`)
over `Print` / `ZeroMem` / `CopyMem` / `AsciiStrCmp` / `AsciiSPrint` in converted files —
a pure-C `snprintf`/`vsnprintf` already exists in the freestanding libc, so EDK2's
`AsciiSPrint` (`%a` for strings) is never required; translate the format string to
plain C (`%s`) at the call site.

## Layout (compact C)

- **Signature on one line** unless the arg list is long (many args / wraps ~80–100 cols). Then break args, not `rettype` alone on its line.
- **Empty body:** `static void Foo(void) {}` — never a braced blank block.
- Short stubs may be one line: `static int32_t NullReady(void) { return 0; }`

## Stackless + main alloc

Async steps (`status(self_h)`) must not park durable state on the C/wasm call
stack across `await`. Allocate from the **Metal host heap**:

- Host / guest: `pm_metal_mem_alloc` / `pm_metal_mem_free` (same names; guest
 cookies are opaque — do not dereference in wasm)
- Guest step frames: `pm_metal_async_coro_alloc` (host TLSF + step-scoped
 linear alias for a normal `T*` during the step)
- Guest buffers passed into async I/O that outlive the step must sit in the
 coro frame (or another host-durable buffer); natives resolve via
 `pm_metal_async_guest_buf_durable`

Wasm linear memory is for statics and short in-step stack only — not a second
long-lived heap for coro frames.
