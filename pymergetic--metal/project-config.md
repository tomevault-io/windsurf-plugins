description: Runtime-printed string literals in Metal must be plain ASCII — the boot console is a fixed 256-glyph codepage, not UTF-8
---


# ASCII-only in printed string literals (no UTF-8 decorative chars)

**Why:** the boot console (`font_vga8x16.inc.c`, a fixed 256-glyph codepage
font) is not UTF-8-aware. Any multi-byte UTF-8 sequence embedded in a string
literal that reaches `pm_metal_shell_out`/`pm_metal_log*`/`pm_metal_ui_set_status`/
`snprintf`-into-a-status-buffer/any other runtime-printed path renders as
mojibake (each byte drawn as its own wrong glyph) — this has reappeared
multiple times (`→`, `—`, `…` in `py_shell.c`, `mod.c`, `banner.c`,
`boot_init.c`, `boot_shell.c`, `input_shell.c`, `scanout_radeon_rv370.c`) and
is always a "looks broken to the user, wastes a debugging round-trip"
regression, not a style nit.

**Banned inside any string literal that can be printed at runtime** (i.e.
passed to an output/log/status function, or built via `snprintf` into a
buffer that is): `→` `—` `–` `…` `‘` `’` `“` `”` `✓` `×` `°` `±`, or any other
non-ASCII/multi-byte UTF-8 character. Use the plain-ASCII equivalent instead:

| Banned | Use instead |
|--------|-------------|
| `→` | `->` |
| `—` / `–` | `-` or `--` |
| `…` | `...` |
| `‘’` `“”` | `'` `"` |

**Comments are exempt** — em-dashes (`—`) are used pervasively in this
codebase's own comments and are never printed at runtime, so leave existing
comment style alone. This rule is only about characters inside a string
literal (`"..."`) that ends up on an output path.

Layout-dependent user-facing glyphs (e.g. German `ß`/`ü`/`ö`/`ä` in
`keyb.c`'s GR keymap table) are a different, deliberate case — those are
Latin-15/ISO-8859-15 single-byte values (`(char)0xDF`, not UTF-8), chosen to
match the VGA font's actual codepage. Don't confuse that pattern with UTF-8
decorative characters; the keymap case is correct as-is and out of scope
for this rule.

**Verify after touching any file with printed strings:**

```
grep -rnP '"([^"\\]|\\.)*[→—–…‘’“”✓×°±]([^"\\]|\\.)*"' src --include=*.c
```

Must return nothing (a match inside a `/* comment */` that happens to share
a line with an unrelated quoted string is a false positive — check the
match is actually inside the quotes before "fixing" it).
