# Never hold a resolved cross-module pointer across an await

**Resolve, use, discard -- all inside one step.** A cross-module address --
`RegEntry::get()`/`ImportRow::entry().get()`'s `*const c_void`, a claimed
wasm trampoline's `t->code`, anything obtained by looking a module/func
name up in the registry -- must be fetched and called within the same,
uninterrupted step. Never stash it in a coroutine's frame state to use
again after a later `.await`/redispatch.

## Why this is a real gap, not caution for its own sake

The registry has **no per-entry refcount by design** -- see
`reg/_impl/_entry.rs`'s `RegEntry` doc comment. That's safe *only* because
`_kernel::unload` quiesces every async runner first (parks every runner at
its next dispatch checkpoint, see `async/_impl/quiesce.rs`) before
withdrawing anything, so there is never a concurrent caller in flight
while a `RegEntry` goes null or a wasm slot gets freed.

Quiesce's guarantee is **between steps**, not **within** a task that
spans more than one. A step that resolves a pointer, then suspends
(`.await`, `ForgePoll::Pending`) while holding it, has stepped *outside*
what quiesce protects: a quiesce + unload can run in that gap, the
resolved address (a stamped trampoline slot, a freed `RegMod`'s entries,
a wasm instance's export) goes stale, and the task resumes holding a
dangling pointer with nothing left to catch it -- the "no refcount" design
depends on this never happening.

## Concrete rule

```rust
// BAD -- resolves once, awaits, calls later with a possibly-stale ptr
let ptr = row.entry().map(|e| e.get());
some_async_op().await;
if let Some(p) = ptr { unsafe { call(p) } }

// GOOD -- resolve and call in the same step, nothing carried across .await
some_async_op().await;
if let Some(p) = row.entry().map(|e| e.get()) {
    unsafe { call(p) }
}
```

Re-resolve on every entry into a step that needs the address; never carry
one in `pm_metal_async_coro_alloc`'d step-frame state, a struct field kept
across dispatches, or any other storage that outlives a single step.

See also `metal-no-long-running-ops.mdc` (a step must be short enough to
reach its next checkpoint quickly) -- this rule is the pointer-safety
half of the same quiesce/safepoint design; that one is the liveness half.
