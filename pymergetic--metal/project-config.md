# Finished quality only (no fake / unfinished code)

**Why this is load-bearing:** unfinished “looks done” code burns tokens,
steals time, and trains the wrong tree. The owner wants **quality and
finished code**, not stubs dressed up as features.

## Hard rule

Do **not** land code that pretends to work. If it is not finished, do not
ship it as if it were.

**Banned (concrete):**

- Rebranding one primitive as another (`Mutex { lock: Spin }` called a
  “mutex”)
- Fake completion: pluggable “park later”, panic-as-API, no-op success,
  TODO bodies behind a real name
- Empty generated faces, hollow hubs, or C exports with no real border
- “Placeholder until X exists” left in the tree as the implementation
- **Dual paths for one primitive** where only one is wired (or the slow
  one is “for later”): e.g. boot `cas32` ops table while locks use
  `core::sync::atomic`, plus a smoke that claims “used by mem locks”
- Comments / smokes that assert a dependency that `grep` cannot find

**Required instead:**

- Ship only what is **done and honest** for the current tree
- If the design is not finished, **omit it** — do not leave a fake type
- Prefer deleting unfinished surface over leaving a stub that compiles
- When unsure: ask, or stop — do not invent a pretend completion
- **One mechanism per job.** Prefer the fast direct path (language/core
  atomics, direct calls). An ops-table / indirection exists only when a
  real caller needs target-specific bodies — and that caller must use it
  now, not “someday.”

## Examples

```text
BAD:  Mutex wraps Spin; set_wait_ops "later"; panic if hooks missing
GOOD: Finished SMP futex mutex (own state machine + wait), or omit entirely.

BAD:  lock/__init__.h empty while real API lives only in a sibling face
GOOD: Package hub carries the real C border, or no face is emitted.

BAD:  /* empty catalog */ headers checked in as “sync output”
GOOD: No emit when there is no border (no exported fns).

BAD:  boot/platform sync cas32 ops + "used by mem locks" while mem/lock
      uses core::sync::atomic and never calls the ops
GOOD: Locks use core atomics only; no boot CAS surface until a real
      caller needs a target-specific CAS (and then locks use that).
```

## Agent habit

Optimize for **correct finished work**, not for looking busy. One real
primitive beats three fake ones. Do not “fill the gap” with noobshit.
