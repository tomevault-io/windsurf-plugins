# IDE lint = user interface (always)

The owner is not connected to the code the way an agent is. **The IDE is
their interface** — Problems / squiggles are what they see first and trust.
A change that "builds" but leaves red or yellow underlines is unfinished.

## Hard rule

**Linting is always from the IDE / user perspective.**

**IDE warnings count as errors.** A yellow squiggle is unfinished work —
same bar as a red error. Do not leave Unused / IncludeCleaner / sign-compare
noise in Metal-owned files because "it's only a warning."

1. **Ground truth = editor diagnostics** on the files you touched (and
   neighbors that include them) — use the IDE diagnostics tool
   (`ReadLints`), not only `clang`/`cargo`/`forge` exit codes. Treat
   every diagnostic severity the user sees (Error **and** Warning) as
   must-fix unless `docs/SOURCETREE.md` documents a known false positive.
2. **"Builds clean" is not "IDE clean."** Freestanding TUs often compile
   via `build.rs` `-I` while clangd still lacks PathMatch / CDB rows
   (`errno.h`, `platform_api_vmcore.h`, …). Fix the IDE path
   (`.clangd.template`, local `.clangd`, forge `compile_commands`) —
   do not call it done because the firmware linked.
3. **Do not claim fixed until diagnostics agree** (or you edited clangd /
   CDB and told them to **restart clangd** / reload so stale ASTs clear).
4. Prefer fixing the **cause** of the squiggle (missing `-I`, wrong
   PathMatch, stale `.clangd`, missing CDB TU, unused dead API) over
   casts/pragmas / `(void)` silencing — unless documented as a known
   clangd false positive in `docs/SOURCETREE.md`.
5. **Do not "fix" IDE noise by editing `external/`** — fix Metal-side
   flags / PathMatch instead. Vendored trees may suppress tidy in
   `.clangd`; Metal-owned code may not.
6. **Python guest** — stubs under `typings/`; regenerate after
   `PM_METAL_PY_BIND` changes so the IDE matches the bind table.

## After `.clangd` / CDB / include-graph edits

Sync `.clangd` from `.clangd.template` when the template changed. End with:
**restart clangd** (Command Palette → `clangd: Restart language server`,
or reload the window).

## Paths in IDE / CDB metadata

See `metal-clangd-no-abs-paths.mdc`. `.clangd*` `-I` and CDB `"file"` /
command `-I` stay package-relative. CDB `"directory"` is the **absolute
package root**. CDB at package-root `compile_commands.json` (mirrored
under `build/`). After template/CDB edits: regenerate if needed, then
**restart clangd**.
