description: Codegen outputs live under a single wholesale-gitignored include/ tree, never beside human source

# Generated files are gitignored (wholesale, under `include/`)

Full layout: [`docs/definitions/module.md`](../../docs/definitions/module.md).

**A module's own directory under `src/` holds only `_impl/` (human
sources) and `.pm/` (metadata) — never a generated face, never a
per-module `.gitignore` managed block.** All codegen for every module,
own-language pool faces and foreign-consumer faces alike, lands under
`include/pymergetic/metal/<mod>/...`, mirrored from `_impl/` with that
segment and any leading underscores stripped.

**Ownership:** generated faces carry an in-file banner
(`DO NOT HAND-EDIT THIS FILE.`). That line is the write gate — sync
refuses to overwrite a file that exists without it (this should never
actually trigger since nothing hand-writes into `include/`).

**Rule:** the entire `include/` tree is generated and gitignored with a
single root-level line — no per-file or per-module bookkeeping:

```gitignore
/include/
```

- `metal mod clean` wipes generated faces; `metal mod sync` regenerates
  the whole tree — there is no partial/stale state to reconcile
  file-by-file.
- Human `_impl/__init__.{ext}`, `.pm/module`, `.pm/Cargo.toml`, ports
  stay tracked as normal — none of them ever live under `include/`.
- Never ignore `.pm/Cargo.toml` or any other human schema file.
