description: Cross-module C borders must be real (non-inline) functions — static inline cannot be a link-time ABI symbol, so forge's generated include/ mirror can never carry it faithfully
---


# No `static inline` on public/exported borders

**Why (the fundamental reason):** you cannot register what has no address.
Every module's public border is meant to publish into the one registry
(`RegEntry.fn` — a real `void *` to one real function), which every
generated cross-module call site resolves through — see
`registration_rethink_scope`'s "Registry design verdict" and
[`docs/definitions/module.md`](../../docs/definitions/module.md) "Module
lifecycle". `static inline` has no guaranteed single link-time address at
all: the compiler is free to inline it away completely at every call site,
or emit a separate private copy per translation unit — there is nothing
stable to put in that `fn` slot. A function meant to be reachable from
outside its own module has to be a real, addressable symbol for the
registry to have anything to point at, independent of any codegen/header
concern.

**Why (the codegen consequence):** `forge mod sync` mirrors every module's
real, non-`_`-prefixed public surface into
`include/pymergetic/metal/<mod>/...` for every consumer language
(C/Rust/Python/toml) — see
[`docs/definitions/module.md`](../../docs/definitions/module.md) "Lang pool".
That mirror is built from the catalog: struct/enum/typedef shapes and plain
function *signatures*. A `static inline` function has no link-time symbol —
its body only exists per-translation-unit — so a generated header can never
faithfully reproduce it as a real declaration. Faking one as `extern` is a
link-time lie (already fixed once in `_export_c.rs`/`_export_rs.rs`); silently
dropping it instead makes the generated mirror an incomplete substitute for
the real header, which blocks ever making `include/` the single source of
truth for cross-module consumption (`src/` would still need to be reachable
for the inline-only bits).

## Hard rule

Any function meant to be called from **outside its own module** (i.e. it is
part of the module's public/exported border, reachable by a foreign
`#include`) must be a real, non-`inline` function: prototype in the header,
body in a `.c` file, ordinary link-time symbol.

`static inline` is fine only for something genuinely private to a single
translation unit inside the module's own `_impl`/module-root sources (never
included by another module).

**Concrete fix pattern:** a header like `boot/platform/uart.h` with
`static inline` convenience wrappers over an ops-vtable pointer
(`pm_metal_boot_uart_write`, `floor_iobase`, `floor_compat`, ...) — move the
body into the matching `.c`, leave a plain prototype in the header. The
generated `include/` mirror then carries the real symbol like everything
else; no cross-module consumer ever needs to read `src/` to get the
convenience it used to get from the inline body.

**Verify:** after touching a module's public header, check the generated
mirror in `include/pymergetic/metal/<mod>/...h` actually contains every
symbol a foreign consumer needs — a border function silently missing from
the mirror (dropped as `inline`) is the signal to convert it, not to keep
including `src/` for it.
