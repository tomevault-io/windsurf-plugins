# No stubs that lie

Never expose a public function, method, or symbol that only validates args /
returns success while the real behavior is "TODO later."

- No `stub` that returns `OK` / `0` / empty success
- No "v1: null-check only" behind a shipped name
- No comments like "grows here" on a call path callers depend on

Either implement the real behavior, or do not put the symbol in the public
header / API yet (keep it private, unexported, or behind an explicit
unfinished gate that fails closed — never silent success).

This covers build targets too. A board whose `build.mk` re-includes another
board's image under a different arch name is a stub that lies: the artifact
boots nowhere it claims to. Ship no board rather than a mislabelled one.

```make
# BAD — X86_UEFI/build.mk: 32-bit seat that is the 64-bit PE renamed
include boards/X86_64_UEFI/build.mk
$(BUILD)/esp/EFI/BOOT/BOOTIA32.EFI: $(BUILD)/esp/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI
	cp -f $< $@
```
