# Digital Twin App

## What This Is

A digital twin app deployed on AWS. The "twin" is an AI persona that responds as a specific person, using conversational memory to maintain context across sessions.

## Deployment Architecture

```

  S3 (static site) <-> CloudFront distribution

Backend
  API Gateway <-> Lambda (business logic)
      |
      +----> Amazon Bedrock (LLM inference)
      +----> S3 (conversational memory / history)
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Next.js App Router (static export to S3)
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda (Python), API Gateway (HTTP API)
- **AI**: Amazon Bedrock
- **Memory**: S3 (JSON conversational history per session)
- **Package manager**: uv (Python)
