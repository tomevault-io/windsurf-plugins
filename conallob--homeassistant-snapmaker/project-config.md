This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Home Assistant custom integration for monitoring and controlling
Snapmaker 3D printers over the local network. The integration communicates with
Snapmaker devices using:

- UDP broadcast on port 20054 for device discovery
- HTTP REST API on port 8080 for detailed status and control

## Architecture

### Core Components

**SnapmakerDevice** (`custom_components/snapmaker/snapmaker.py`):

- Handles low-level communication with Snapmaker devices
- Implements discovery protocol via UDP broadcast
- Manages token-based authentication for API access
- Provides device status updates including temperatures, print progress, and job
  information

**DataUpdateCoordinator** (`custom_components/snapmaker/__init__.py`):

- Polls the SnapmakerDevice every 30 seconds
- Coordinates data updates across all sensor entities
- Runs the blocking `snapmaker.update()` call in an executor job

**Config Flow** (`custom_components/snapmaker/config_flow.py`):

- Supports multiple setup methods: manual IP entry, DHCP discovery, and
  automatic device discovery
- Uses unique_id based on device IP to prevent duplicate configuration
- Validates connectivity before completing setup

**Sensors** (`custom_components/snapmaker/sensor.py`):

- 9 sensor entities per device:
    - Status (IDLE, RUNNING, OFFLINE)
    - Nozzle temperature (current and target)
    - Bed temperature (current and target)
    - File name
    - Progress percentage
    - Elapsed and remaining time
- All sensors inherit from `SnapmakerSensorBase` which extends
  `CoordinatorEntity`

### Communication Flow

1. **Discovery**: UDP broadcast message "discover" → device responds with
   `IP@<ip>|Model:<model>|Status:<status>`
2. **Authentication**: POST to `/api/v1/connect` → receive token → validate
   token
3. **Status Updates**: GET `/api/v1/status?token=<token>` → parse JSON response

### Token-Based Authentication

The integration implements secure token-based authentication following Snapmaker's
API requirements. This ensures only authorized connections can access device data.

**Token Generation Flow**:

1. Config flow initiates token request via POST to `/api/v1/connect`
2. Device responds with a temporary token
3. User must approve the connection on the Snapmaker touchscreen
4. Integration polls the token validation endpoint (10s intervals, max 5 minutes)
5. Once approved, token is validated and persisted to config entry

**Token Persistence**:

- Tokens are stored in Home Assistant's config entry data
- Tokens survive restarts and are automatically restored on setup
- A callback mechanism updates the config entry if a token refresh occurs
- Thread-safe updates using `call_soon_threadsafe()` from executor threads

**Token Expiration & Reauth**:

- When API returns 401 Unauthorized, the `token_invalid` flag is set
- DataUpdateCoordinator detects this and triggers a reauth flow (only once)
- User is prompted to generate a new token via the touchscreen
- New token is validated before persisting to config entry
- Integration automatically reloads with the new token

**Thread Pool Considerations**:

The `generate_token()` method blocks an executor thread during token generation:
- Default: 18 attempts × 10 second intervals = up to 3 minutes blocking time
- This is necessary because users must manually approve on the touchscreen
- Home Assistant's default executor pool has limited threads (typically 5-15)
- During token generation, one thread is unavailable for other operations
- This only occurs during initial setup or reauth, not during normal operation
- Consider the impact if multiple devices need reauth simultaneously
- The timeout can be customized via the `max_attempts` parameter if needed

Recommendations for production use:
- Ensure users understand they must approve on the touchscreen promptly
- Monitor thread pool utilization if managing many Snapmaker devices
- Token generation only happens during setup/reauth, not routine updates
- For large deployments, stagger device setup to avoid simultaneous token requests

### Breaking Changes & Migration

**Version 2.x - Token Authentication Required**

Prior versions of this integration did not implement token authentication,
which meant the API status endpoint was accessed without proper authorization.
As of version 2.x, token authentication is mandatory.

**Migration Path for Existing Users**:

If you're upgrading from a pre-2.x version:

1. **Automatic Reauth Prompt**: On first update attempt after upgrade, the
   integration will detect missing or invalid token and trigger a reauth flow
2. **User Action Required**: You'll see a "Reauthenticate" notification in Home
   Assistant → Configuration → Integrations
3. **Complete Reauth**: Click the notification, follow the authorize step, and
   approve the connection on your Snapmaker touchscreen
4. **Normal Operation Resumes**: Once token is generated and validated, the
   integration will work as before

**What Changed**:

- Config entries now include a `token` field in addition to `host`
- All API status requests include `?token=<token>` parameter
