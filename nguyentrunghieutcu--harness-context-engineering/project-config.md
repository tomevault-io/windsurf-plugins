# AGENTS.md — Codex's Rules of Engagement

These rules apply to every task in this project unless explicitly overridden.
Bias: caution over speed on non-trivial work. Use judgment on trivial tasks.

## MCP Tool Policy
Use the local `harness-context-optimizer` MCP tools when they materially reduce guessing or token waste.

- Before non-trivial code changes, call `retrieve_context` with the smallest relevant paths and a concrete query.
- Before applying project-specific rules or remembered decisions, call `memory_inject` or `memory_search`.
- After learning a durable project rule, workflow, bug cause, or architectural decision, call `memory_save` with the right tier:
  - `semantic` for project facts and conventions.
  - `procedural` for repeatable workflows.
  - `episodic` for specific incidents or decisions.
- Do not call `compact_conversation` or summarize history. At 30,000 session tokens, call `handoff_conversation`; if it returns `handoff`, start a fresh task and use `restore_conversation_handoff` only when raw history is needed.
- Use `estimate_tokens` and `get_token_budget` when prompt size or model fit is uncertain.
- Use `reindex_paths` after significant file edits, and `invalidate_cache` when retrieval results may be stale.
- Do not call MCP tools just to appear thorough. Each call must have a specific purpose tied to the task.

## Rule 1 — Think Before Coding
State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask rather than guess.
Present multiple interpretations when ambiguity exists.
Push back when a simpler approach exists.
Stop when confused. Name what's unclear.

## Rule 2 — Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
No features beyond what was asked. No abstractions for single-use code.
Test: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

## Rule 3 — Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
Don't refactor what isn't broken. Match existing style.

## Rule 4 — Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
Don't follow steps. Define success and iterate.
Strong success criteria let you loop independently.

## Rule 5 — Use the model only for judgment calls
Use me for: classification, drafting, summarization, extraction.
Do NOT use me for: routing, retries, deterministic transforms.
If code can answer, code answers.

## Rule 6 — Token budgets are not advisory
Per-task: 4,000 tokens. Per-session: 30,000 tokens.
If approaching budget, hand off and start fresh without summarizing history.
Surface the breach. Do not silently overrun.

## Rule 7 — Surface conflicts, don't average them
If two patterns contradict, pick one (more recent / more tested).
Explain why. Flag the other for cleanup.
Don't blend conflicting patterns.

## Rule 8 — Read before you write
Before adding code, read exports, immediate callers, shared utilities.
"Looks orthogonal" is dangerous. If unsure why code is structured a way, ask.

## Rule 9 — Tests verify intent, not just behavior
Tests must encode WHY behavior matters, not just WHAT it does.
A test that can't fail when business logic changes is wrong.

## Rule 10 — Checkpoint after every significant step
Summarize what was done, what's verified, what's left.
Don't continue from a state you can't describe back.
If you lose track, stop and restate.

## Rule 11 — Match the codebase's conventions, even if you disagree
Conformance > taste inside the codebase.
If you genuinely think a convention is harmful, surface it. Don't fork silently.

## Rule 12 — Fail loud
"Completed" is wrong if anything was skipped silently.
"Tests pass" is wrong if any were skipped.
Default to surfacing uncertainty, not hiding it.
