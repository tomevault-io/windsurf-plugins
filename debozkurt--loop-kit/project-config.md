# loopkit — working instructions

`loopkit` is a self-governed coding loop you can point at any repository: give it a goal and two
gates, and it drives a coding agent toward the goal tick by tick with guardrails (external
verification gate, held-out acceptance gate, three hard stops, durable git state, a blast-radius
safety envelope). It runs as a single loop, an in-process fleet, or a queue-driven fleet on
Kubernetes.

## ⛓️ Documentation contract (binding)

The architecture wiki and the resume doc are **load-bearing infrastructure, not afterthoughts**.
They are the canonical reference for both humans and AI working on this project.

- **`docs/architecture/`** is the long-running architecture reference. **Update it on any meaningful
  or relevant change** — a new subsystem or module, a changed contract/interface, a new
  architectural decision (or the reversal of one), a new failure mode/sharp edge, a new control-flow
  or data-flow path. Keep the page that *owns* that area current; keep the master diagram in
  `docs/architecture/README.md` in sync with the topology.
- **`docs/part-iii-resume.md`** (or the current phase's resume doc) holds **current state +
  load-bearing context + sharp edges + next step** — not chronological history. Update it whenever
  state moves: a phase starts/completes, a decision is locked, a gotcha is paid for, the "next step"
  changes.
- **History belongs in `git log`, not in the docs.** The wiki describes how things *are/will be*;
  the resume doc describes *where we are and what's next* (current state + a short newest-first
  "recent work" priming list, not a running changelog — the diary lives in git).
- A change is not "done" until the docs that describe it are updated in the same change.

This contract exists because loopkit is itself a tool for autonomous, long-horizon work: the docs
are the interface a future session (human or agent) uses to resume without re-deriving context.

## Invariants to preserve (don't regress)

- **Repo-agnostic by design; dogfooded, not shaped, by any one repo.** loopkit is built to be pointed
  at *any* repository — this is the tenet that underpins every design call. We dogfood it on **spacer**
  (a deliberately gnarly stress case: docker-compose gates, SCRAM auth, non-relocatable venv, four
  services), and spacer is where pain points surface first — but spacer is the *test subject, not the
  target*. When a dogfood friction appears, fix the **general class** in loopkit-core (prefer a
  declarative knob/contract over a heuristic that encodes one repo's accidents — e.g. a `group`/mutex
  field over repo-path guessing), keep the **repo-specific instance** out of core (in the operator's
  gates/proposer/config), and add a **generic example** so the next repo copies the right shape.
  Tailoring for spacer and shipping spacer-like examples is fine; **baking spacer assumptions into core
  is not.** Two guardrails bound this: never compromise loopkit's core goals/design to chase generality
  (the invariants below win), and **don't over-engineer for hypothetical repos** — build the general
  mechanism an *observed* need calls for, record deferred generality with a named trigger, and stop.
  The measure of a good change: it contains no repo-specific nouns in core, and it didn't add a knob
  nothing yet needs.
- **Reuse the contracts**, don't fork them: `Agent` / `Gate` / `Store`, the three `StopPolicy`
  stops, the **held-out acceptance gate**, the `[loopkit][component]` + run-id logging, and
  safe-by-default (never `main`, clean tree, protected paths, budget ceiling).
- **Extend at the seams.** The core (`loopkit/`) keeps **no runtime dependency** on
  `loopkit/extensions/`. New core attach points follow the established shape: keyword-only,
  typing-only import, duck-called, `None`-safe (None = exact prior behavior).
- **Stack stays thin:** `typer + rich + pydantic`, stdlib-first elsewhere. Optional wires behind
  extras (`[claude]`/`[openai]` = the API-adapter SDKs, `[trace]` = langsmith, `[fleet]` = redis,
  `[cloud]` = kubernetes client; `truststore` is **dev-only**, never prod). `pip install loopkit`
  never pulls any of them.
