You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write functional, maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain

## Angular Best Practices

- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It's the default in Angular v20+.
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
  - `NgOptimizedImage` does not work for inline base64 images.

## Accessibility Requirements

- It MUST pass all AXE checks.
- It MUST follow all WCAG AA minimums, including focus management, color contrast, and ARIA attributes.

### Components

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- Do NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead
- When using external templates/styles, use paths relative to the component TS file.

## State Management

- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead

## Templates

- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables
- Do not assume globals like (`new Date()`) are available.
- Do not write arrow functions in templates (they are not supported).

## Services

- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection

## Typescript

- NEVER use type assertions. Eg: `const x = value as Type` is forbidden. The only exception is `as const`.
- NEVER use `any` type.
- NEVER use the not null assertion operator (`!`). Prefers the optional chaining operator (`?.`) or explicit checks.
- Use type narrowing to check for not null or undefined values, such as `if (value !== null && value !== undefined)`.
- Use `===` instead of `==`.
- Define return types explicitly for functions.
- Use `const` for variables that are not reassigned, and `let` for those that are.
- When working with union types, use `never` to ensure that if new cases are added, TypeScript will throw an error if they are not handled.
- Avoid type checking with `instanceof`. Always prefer to specify types of variables, parameters and return values to leverage the full power of TypeScript features.
- Prefer immutability with `readonly`.

## TailwindCSS V4 Best Practices

- `text-opacity-*` → Use `text-{color}/{opacity}` instead
- `bg-opacity-*` → Use `bg-{color}/{opacity}` instead
- `border-opacity-*` → Use `border-{color}/{opacity}` instead
- `flex-grow-*` → Use `grow-*`
- `flex-shrink-*` → Use `shrink-*`
- `decoration-slice` → Use `box-decoration-slice`
