# MCPControl - Development Guide

## Build & Test Commands
- Build: `pwsh.exe -c "npm run build"` - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- Lint: `pwsh.exe -c "npm run lint"` - Runs ESLint to check code quality (TS and JS)
- Format: `pwsh.exe -c "npm run format"` - Runs Prettier to format code
- Format Check: `pwsh.exe -c "npm run format:check"` - Checks if files are properly formatted
- Test: `pwsh.exe -c "npm run test"` - Runs all Vitest tests
- Run single test: `pwsh.exe -c "npm run test -- tools/keyboard.test.ts"` or `pwsh.exe -c "npm run test -- -t \"specific test name\""`
- Watch tests: `pwsh.exe -c "npm run test:watch"` - Runs tests in watch mode
- Coverage: `pwsh.exe -c "npm run test:coverage"` - Generates test coverage report
- E2E Test: `cd test && ./e2e-test.sh [iterations]` - Runs end-to-end tests with Claude and MCPControl

## Running with HTTPS/TLS
MCPControl supports HTTPS for secure SSE connections (mandatory per MCP spec for production):
- `node build/index.js --sse --https --cert /path/to/cert.pem --key /path/to/key.pem`
- Default HTTPS port is still 3232 (use --port to change)
- Both --cert and --key are required when using --https

> Note: MCP Servers are typically launched by the Client as a subprocess.

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Imports**: Use ES module syntax with named imports
- **Types**: Define TypeScript interfaces for inputs/outputs in `types/` directory
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch with standardized response objects
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for interfaces
- **Functions**: Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility
- **Comments**: Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- **Testing**: 
  - Unit tests: Place in same directory as implementation with `.test.ts` suffix
  - E2E tests: Added to the `test/` directory
- **Formatting**: Code is formatted using Prettier (pre-commit hooks will run automatically)
- **Error Responses**: Return `{ success: false, message: string }` for errors
- **Success Responses**: Return `{ success: true, data?: any }` for success
- **Linting**: Both TypeScript and JavaScript files are linted with ESLint
