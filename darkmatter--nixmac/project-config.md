description: Three configuration tiers for the native app

# Configuration — use one of three tiers

Any new configuration must land in exactly one of these places. Do not invent a fourth config file or hard-code values in components.

## 1. Build profiles (environment variables)

**Files:** `apps/native/env.development.json`, `apps/native/env.release.json` (and `env.e2e.json` for e2e)

We call these **profiles** to distinguish them from runtime user settings. Anything that can be passed as an env var belongs here. Preferred over ad hoc env reads — each file references a generated JSON Schema (`src-tauri/resources/schemas/env.schema.json`) for intellisense.

Read in app code via `apps/native/src/lib/env.ts`.

## 2. User preferences (device-wide)

**Path:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nixmac/settings.json`

App settings at the **user** level — they apply across every project/config repo the user opens. Rust: `GlobalPreferences` / observable persistence in `src-tauri/src/state/`.

## 3. Project level (repo-scoped)

**Path:** `<config_dir>/.nixmac/settings.json`

Settings that travel with the user's nix/darwin config **repository** (agent limits, per-repo defaults, etc.). Rust: repo-scoped configurable slices via `storage/configurable_scope.rs`.

When unsure which tier: build-time constant → profile; follows the person → user prefs; follows the repo → project level.
