# Instructions for Codex

To build the Rust native extension, execute:

```
just build-extension
```

To run the test suite, execute:

```
just test
```

The test suite executes a number of sample programs in `test/programs` under
**two separate recorders, by design**:

* `gems/codetracer-ruby-recorder` — the production recorder, a Rust native
  extension. Emits CTFS v3 binary trace bundles (`<prog>.ct`).
* `gems/codetracer-pure-ruby-recorder` — a pure-Ruby reference
  implementation. Emits the legacy 3-file JSON shape (`trace.json`,
  `trace_metadata.json`, `trace_paths.json`).

The two recorders exist as a **cross-validation oracle**: every test
program is run through both, and their outputs are compared
structurally against the same fixtures in `test/fixtures`. For the
native recorder the test framework shells out to
`ct print --json-events` (from `codetracer-trace-format-nim`) and
normalises the resulting events into the same shape as the pure
recorder's JSON — see `read_trace` and `normalise_ct_events` in
`test/test_tracer.rb`. Any behaviour drift between the two
implementations is caught by structural divergence from the fixtures.

The pure-Ruby recorder is **JSON-only by design; do not migrate it to
CTFS**. Doing so would silently weaken the test suite by removing the
independent reference. If a shape change is needed, update the pure
recorder first, regenerate fixtures, and keep `normalise_ct_events` in
sync. See `gems/codetracer-pure-ruby-recorder/README.md` for the full
rationale.

When `just test` fails, I suggest running the two tracers directly and
analyzing where their outputs differ.

Please note that only the codetracer-pure-ruby-recorder formats the output json for
human readability. Thus, you must use `jq -S` when comparing the outputs.

To run the benchmark, execute:

```
just bench
```

# You don't have access to the internet

During development, certain commands will fail because you don't have
access to the internet.

The script `.agents/download_internet_resources.sh` is executed before
your development session starts while your computer is still connected
to the internet.

You can examine this script to see what kind of internet resources
have been downloaded for offline use. If it's difficult for you to
achieve a task without access to additional internet resources, you
can always propose a PR that modifies the download.sh script instead
of completing your main task.

Downloading development dependencies may also fail due to the lack of
internet connectivity. We are trying to maintain the script `.agents/codex-setup`
that is also executed before your development session starts while
your computer is still connected to the internet. It tries to run
all build commands that need development dependencies in order to
cache the dependencies for offline use. Please propose changes to
this script when you introduce new build targets with dependencies.

When you need to consult the documentation or source code modules
for a particular dependency, always try to find where this dependency
have been downloaded and try to access the necessary files through
the file system (i.e. depending on the programming language, the
operating system and the package manager being used, they should
be in their standard location).

# Keeping notes

In the `.agents/codebase-insights.txt` file, we try to maintain useful tips that may help
you in your development tasks. When you discover something important or surprising about
the codebase, add a remark in a comment near the relevant code or in the codebase-insights
file. ALWAYS remove older remarks if they are no longer true.

You can consult this file before starting your coding tasks.

# Windows development

### Environment setup
```bash
# Install Ruby via MSYS2
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ruby

# Git Bash / MSYS2 (auto-installs Rust & Cap'n Proto on first run)
source env.sh

# PowerShell (auto-installs Rust & Cap'n Proto on first run)
. .\env.ps1
```

### Build (Windows)
```bash
just build-extension       # compile Rust native extension (GNU target)
```

### Test (Windows)
```bash
just test
```

### Dependencies
- Rust 1.92.0 with `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target (via bootstrap)
- Cap'n Proto 1.3.0 (via bootstrap)
- Ruby 3.3+ (via MSYS2 pacman)
- MSYS2 MinGW64 toolchain

# Code quality guidelines

- ALWAYS strive to achieve high code quality.
- ALWAYS write secure code.
- ALWAYS make sure the code is well tested and edge cases are covered. Design the code for testability and be extremely thorough.
- ALWAYS write defensive code and make sure all potential errors are handled.
- ALWAYS strive to write highly reusable code with routines that have high fan in and low fan out.
- ALWAYS keep the code DRY.
- Aim for low coupling and high cohesion. Encapsulate and hide implementation details.
- When creating executable, ALWAYS make sure the functionality can also be used as a library.
  To achieve this, avoid global variables, raise/return errors instead of terminating the program, and think whether the use case of the library requires more control over logging and metrics from the application that integrates the library.

# Code commenting guidelines

- Document public APIs and complex modules using standard code documentation conventions.
