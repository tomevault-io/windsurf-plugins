# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

For complete documentation, see the [README.md](README.md).

## Project Overview

AreaProg.Migrations is a .NET class library split into two NuGet packages (`AreaProg.Migrations` for console/worker apps and `AreaProg.AspNetCore.Migrations` for ASP.NET Core) that provides application-level migration infrastructure. It complements Entity Framework Core database migrations by enabling versioned application migrations with lifecycle hooks.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Build for a specific framework
dotnet build -f net8.0

# Create NuGet package (auto-generated on build)
dotnet pack
```

The project multi-targets: net6.0, net8.0, net9.0, net10.0.

## Architecture

### Core Pattern

The library uses an abstract base class pattern for extensibility:

1. **BaseMigration** (`Abstractions/BaseMigration.cs`) - Abstract class that individual migrations inherit from. Requires implementing `Version` property and `UpAsync()` method.

2. **BaseMigrationEngine** (`Abstractions/BaseMigrationEngine.cs`) - Abstract orchestration layer that tracks applied versions. Subclasses implement version storage (e.g., database, file system).

3. **ApplicationMigrationEngine<T>** (`Services/ApplicationMigrationEngine.cs`) - Generic concrete implementation that:
   - Discovers `BaseMigration` implementations via reflection from assembly containing type `T`
   - Executes migrations sequentially based on version ordering
   - Wraps migrations in EF Core transactions when DbContext is configured
   - Provides lifecycle hooks: `RunBeforeAsync()`, `RunBeforeDatabaseMigrationAsync()`, `RunAfterDatabaseMigrationAsync()`, `RunAfterAsync()`

### DI Registration

```csharp
services.AddApplicationMigrations<MyMigrationEngine>(options =>
{
    options.DbContext = typeof(MyDbContext); // Optional: enables transactional migrations
});
```

### Running Migrations

**ASP.NET Core** - Use extension methods on `IApplicationBuilder`:

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();
app.UseMigrations();        // or await app.UseMigrationsAsync();
app.Run();
```

**Console Apps / Worker Services** - Use extension methods on `IHost`:

```csharp
var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args).Build();
host.RunMigrations();       // or await host.RunMigrationsAsync();
await host.RunAsync();
```

### Public Interface

`IApplicationMigrationEngine` exposes:
- `Run()` - Executes pending migrations synchronously
- `RunAsync()` - Executes pending migrations asynchronously
- `HasRun` - Indicates if migrations have executed

## Key Implementation Details

- Migrations are discovered at runtime via reflection scanning the assembly containing the engine type
- Version comparison uses `System.Version` ordering - migrations with higher versions run later
- EF Core database migrations run automatically via `context.Database.Migrate()` when DbContext is configured

### Current Version Re-execution (Development Workflow)

The migration matching the current registered version is **re-executed on each application startup**. This is intentional to facilitate development:

- You can iterate on a migration without manually rolling back the database version
- No need to delete version records or reset state between debugging sessions

To handle re-execution, use one of these strategies:

1. **Use `FirstTime` property** - Guards operations that should only run once:
   ```csharp
   public override async Task UpAsync()
   {
       if (FirstTime)
       {
           // Runs only on first installation (e.g., seed data, notifications)
       }

       // Idempotent operations run every time
   }
   ```

2. **Design idempotent migrations** - Methods that are safe to re-execute (upserts, "create if not exists", etc.)

The `FirstTime` flag is `true` when the migration version has never been registered, `false` on re-executions. During debugging, you can bypass the `FirstTime` check by moving the execution pointer.

### Pre-Migration Data Capture (Schema Change Workflow)

When changing column types (e.g., enum to string), you may need to capture existing data before the schema change and transform it afterward. Use `PrepareMigrationAsync` in individual migrations:

```csharp
public class Migration_1_2_0 : BaseMigration
{
    private readonly MyDbContext _db;

    public Migration_1_2_0(MyDbContext db) => _db = db;

    public override Version Version => new(1, 2, 0);

    // Called BEFORE EF Core migrations - capture data while old schema exists
    public override async Task PrepareMigrationAsync(IDictionary<string, object> cache)
    {
        var oldValues = await _db.Database
            .SqlQueryRaw<OldStatusRecord>("SELECT Id, Status FROM Orders")
            .ToListAsync();

        cache["OrderStatuses"] = oldValues;
    }

    // Called AFTER EF Core migrations - transform data with new schema
    public override async Task UpAsync()
    {
        if (Cache.TryGetValue("OrderStatuses", out var data))
        {
            var oldStatuses = (List<OldStatusRecord>)data;
            foreach (var record in oldStatuses)
            {
                var newStatus = record.Status switch
