## Click Tracking

Added 2026-05-17. Every referral CTA click fires a background POST to `/api/log` which writes a row to the shared Google Sheet and posts an embed to the #referral-clicks Discord channel.

**Env vars required** (Vercel project settings + `.env.local`):
- `CLICK_TRACKER_SHEET_URL` — Google Apps Script web app deploy URL
- `DISCORD_CLICK_WEBHOOK_URL` — Discord channel webhook URL

**Key files:**
- `src/app/api/log/route.ts` — server-side handler (parallel Sheet + Discord calls)
- `src/components/CTAButton.tsx` — `handleClick` fires the fetch on CTA click

> **Note:** Endpoint was renamed from `/api/track-click` → `/api/log` because adblocker filter lists (EasyPrivacy, uBlock Origin) blocked the original URL pattern client-side.

### Abuse guards (added 2026-07-14, network-wide)

After a bot replayed 26 identical click POSTs in 31s (2026-07-15 03:37 UTC), `/api/log` gained in-route guards — identical implementation in every network repo:

- **Same-origin check** — POSTs without a matching `Origin`/`Referer` host → 403 (blocks curl/replay loops)
- **Per-IP throttle** — max 10 events/min/IP → 429 (in-memory; effective because Fluid Compute reuses instances)
- **Dedupe** — identical `(ip, site, label, page)` within 30s is dropped silently
- **Discord flood breaker** — max 5 embeds/min, then one "alerts muted" summary embed; Sheet logging continues
- **Forensics** — payload now includes `ipHash` + `userAgent` (Apps Script must be updated to add columns before they appear in the Sheet)

### TODO: Verify end-to-end on this site
- [ ] Click CTA **with** adblocker enabled → Sheet row appears within 5s
- [ ] Click CTA **with** adblocker enabled → Discord embed appears in #referral-clicks
- [ ] Click CTA **without** adblocker → same as above

## SEO

**Network role:** Definition funnel satellite
**Search engine:** Both

**Primary keywords:**
- "what does pledge mean in star citizen"
- "star citizen pledge"
- "what is a pledge star citizen"

**Cross-links this site must send (body copy only):**
- → dayonecitizen.com: "New player guide" CTA
- → screferralreward.com: "Get a referral bonus when you make your first pledge"

**Do not:**
- Place cross-portfolio links in footers or link lists — editorial/body copy only

**Full strategy:** `E:\Claude Code\sc-portfolio\docs\seo\README.md`
