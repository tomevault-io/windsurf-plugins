## Developing the Plugin

Edit files directly in `plugins/agentic-dev-team/`. All plugin components (agents, skills, commands, hooks) live there.

### Testing locally

Install the plugin from the local path into a test project:

```bash
claude plugin install --scope project /path/to/agentic-dev-team/plugins/agentic-dev-team
# Or from the marketplace:
# claude plugin install agentic-dev-team@bfinster
```

### Adding agents, skills, or commands

- **Agent**: Add a `.md` file to `plugins/agentic-dev-team/agents/`
- **Skill**: Add a `.md` file to `plugins/agentic-dev-team/skills/`
- **Command**: Add a `.md` file to `plugins/agentic-dev-team/commands/`
- **Hook**: Add a `.sh` script to `plugins/agentic-dev-team/hooks/` and register it in `plugins/agentic-dev-team/settings.json`

After changes, run `/agent-audit` to verify structural compliance.

### Releasing

Releases are managed by release-please. Push conventional commits to main:
- `feat:` → minor version bump
- `fix:` → patch version bump
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` → major version bump

A release PR is opened automatically. Merging it creates a GitHub Release with a version tag.

See `plugins/agentic-dev-team/CLAUDE.md` for the full orchestration pipeline configuration.
