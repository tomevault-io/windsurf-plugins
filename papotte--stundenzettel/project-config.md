# Migrations

## Firestore rules and indexes

- **Rules:** Edit **`firestore.rules`**; deploy with `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`. Document non-obvious access changes in a PR or in `docs/` as needed.
- **Indexes:** Edit **`firestore.indexes.json`** for composite indexes; deploy with `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes` (or as part of firestore deploy). Document new indexes if non-obvious.

## Emulator and seeding

- **Emulator data:** `emulator-data/` is in `.gitignore`. Use `npm run emulators:start` (import/export to `emulator-data/`), `npm run emulators:fresh` for a clean start.
- **Seeding:** `scripts/seed-emulator.js`; `npm run emulator:seed` or `npm run emulator:seed:ci` for CI. See **`docs/FIRESTORE_MIGRATION.md`** for emulator setup and flow.

## One-off data scripts

- Scripts in **`scripts/`** (e.g. for Firestore or Stripe) are run from the project root. Use Firebase Admin or the appropriate SDK; do not commit secrets. Document what the script does and how to run it in the PR or in `scripts/README.md`.
