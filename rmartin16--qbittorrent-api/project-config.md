# Working on this test suite

This suite tests a client for qBittorrent's Web API. Most of it runs against a
real qBittorrent, which shapes nearly every rule below. Read this before adding
or changing tests.

## You need a running qBittorrent

Start the same container CI uses:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name qbt-tox-testing --publish 8080:8080 \
  --volume "$PWD/tests/_resources:/tmp/_resources" \
  ghcr.io/rmartin16/qbittorrent-nox:master-debug
```

Then run the suite:

```bash
python -m pytest                      # everything
python -m pytest tests/test_torrents.py -k webseed   # a slice
tox -e py                             # starts and stops the container for you
```

This is not optional, even for tests that never make a request: `setup_environ()`
in `tests/utils.py` contacts qBittorrent while `conftest.py` is being imported,
so *collection* fails without it.

**Never run two pytest sessions against one qBittorrent.** The session fixture
rewrites application preferences and adds torrents; two sessions will corrupt
each other's state and produce failures that look like real bugs.

## Two kinds of test

**Offline** — `tests/test_api_surface.py`, derived from `tests/catalog.py`. These
inspect the library itself and never talk to qBittorrent. They carry the
`offline` marker, are generated from all 130 endpoints in the catalog, and
finish in well under a second.

**Live** — everything else. These make real requests and assert on what
qBittorrent actually did.

Put a new test in the offline layer if it asserts something true regardless of
which qBittorrent is running: which names an endpoint is reachable under, what
version range it declares, what type it returns. Put it in the live layer if it
asserts that a request *changed something*.

## If you add or change an endpoint, regenerate the snapshot

```bash
python -m tests.catalog > tests/api_surface.json
```

`tests/api_surface.json` is a checked-in snapshot of the API surface, and
`test_catalog_matches_snapshot` fails until it is regenerated. This is
intentional, not an obstacle: the catalog is derived from the source, so it
cannot by itself notice a `version_introduced` constant being changed by
mistake — the expectation would move along with the change. The snapshot is the
second copy that makes such an edit visible in review. Regenerate it
deliberately and check the diff is what you meant.

## Do not mock qBittorrent in live tests

The point of the live layer is that qBittorrent really behaves this way.
Replacing requests with `unittest.mock` deletes the only thing those tests
verify. If a live test is hard to write, fix the fixture, do not mock it.

Pinning versions *is* allowed in the offline layer, where the subject is the
library's own logic:

```python
monkeypatch.setattr(client, "app_web_api_version", MagicMock(return_value="0.0.1"))
```

## qBittorrent applies changes asynchronously

A request that returns 200 has not necessarily taken effect yet, so a bare
assert immediately after a mutation is a flake waiting to happen. Wrap it in
`eventually()` from `tests/utils.py`, which retries the block until it passes or
the timeout expires (10 seconds by default):

```python
for attempt in eventually():
    with attempt:
        assert torrent.info.category == "test_category"
```

The assertions stay in the test module, so pytest rewrites them and a failure
reports the values that did not match. Only `AssertionError`, `AttributeError`
and `LookupError` are retried, and the final attempt re-raises whatever it gets,
so retrying can delay a genuine failure but never hide one.

Worse, qBittorrent sometimes drops a request entirely — webseed changes run in
worker threads that swallow every exception, and some setters return early when
qBittorrent's own cached state already looks correct. For those, pass `resend=`,
a callable that re-sends the request between attempts:

```python
def add_webseeds():
    client.func(add_webseeds_func)(torrent_hash=new_torrent.hash, urls=webseeds)


add_webseeds()
for attempt in eventually(
    timeout=WEBSEED_TIMEOUT, resend=add_webseeds, resend_every=WEBSEED_RESEND_EVERY
):
    with attempt:
        assert [w.url for w in new_torrent.webseeds] == webseeds
```

Only use `resend=` for requests that are safe to send more than once. Raise
`resend_every` for work handled on a thread pool, where re-sending on every
attempt only queues more onto a pool that is already behind.

## Tests share one qBittorrent, so clean up

Anything a test creates — torrents, categories, tags, RSS feeds — outlives it
and will confuse whatever runs next. Use the existing fixtures rather than
hand-rolling setup:

- `client` — session-scoped, authenticated
- `orig_torrent` — a torrent present for the whole session; re-synced per test
- `new_torrent` — added for one test, removed afterwards
- `new_torrent_standalone()` — same, as a context manager, when you need options

Clean up in a `finally` block so a mid-test failure still tidies up.

This is enforced. An autouse fixture compares qBittorrent's torrents,
categories, tags, RSS items and preferences either side of every test, and fails
one that leaves anything behind or changes a preference without putting it back:
