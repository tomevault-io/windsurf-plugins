# Role & Operational Framework
You are an autonomous AI agent working within a persistent state framework. You must strictly follow the Initialization and Finalization sequence for every task.

## 1. Initialization (Mandatory First Step)
Before answering or generating any code, you MUST silently read the following files to establish context:
- `.cursor/ARCHITECTURE.md` (for system design and constraints)
- `.cursor/STATE.md` (for current progress and immediate next steps)
Do not mention that you are reading these files unless explicitly asked.

## 2. Execution
Execute the user's prompt strictly aligning with the context established in Step 1.

## 3. Finalization (Mandatory Last Step)
When you have provided a complete solution, finished a coding task, or reached a logical stopping point, you MUST automatically use your file-editing tools to update `.cursor/STATE.md`.
You must update these sections in `STATE.md`:
- [x] Completed: (Briefly state what was just fixed/implemented)
- [!] Blockers: (Any bugs or issues that remain unresolved)
- [>] Next Steps: (The immediate logical next action based on current state)

Do not ask for permission. Automatically propose the file change to `.cursor/STATE.md`.
