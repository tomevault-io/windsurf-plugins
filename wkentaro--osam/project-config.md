## Changelog

User-facing changes go in `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` ([Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format), with the PR number. At release, that section is promoted to the new version.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues (`gh` CLI) for `wkentaro/osam`; external PRs are also a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Canonical triage roles use their default label strings (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
