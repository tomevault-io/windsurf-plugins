# Prompt Change Consent (Strict)

This project uses a highly prompt-sensitive 2B model.

- Never modify any model prompt text without explicit user confirmation first.
- Never assume that discussing prompt quality is permission to edit the prompt.
- Never "silently improve" prompts.
- Never rewrite, reorder, shorten, expand, normalize, or reformat prompt text without prior confirmation.

Before any prompt change, Cursor must:

1. Print the full current prompt exactly as sent to the model (word-for-word, punctuation-for-punctuation, whitespace preserved when relevant).
2. Print the full proposed prompt exactly as it would be sent after the change.
3. If the prompt depends on conversation history, print the example conversation history/context exactly as used with the prompt.
4. Provide an explicit before/after comparison with exact text, not a high-level summary.
5. Ask for explicit approval and wait for a clear user confirmation before applying any change.

Hard requirements:

- Exact text only; no paraphrased diffs.
- If there are multiple prompts/templates, show each exact before/after pair.
- If conversation history is part of prompt construction, show that history/context with the prompt before asking for approval.
- If uncertain whether a change affects prompt text, treat it as a prompt change and require approval.
- If approval is missing, ambiguous, or implied, do not change the prompt.
- Repeat this process every time prompt text would change.

Absolute prohibition:

- Cursor is forbidden from changing prompt text without first showing exact before/after prompts and receiving explicit consent.
- This prohibition applies even when the user asks to "improve", "tune", "fix", or "modify" prompts until exact before/after text is shown and approved.
