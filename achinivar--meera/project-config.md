# Code Change Consent (Strict)

The codebase is now mature. Any code modification requires explicit user confirmation before edits are made.

- Never modify code files without explicit user approval.
- Never infer that discussion, troubleshooting, or intent exploration is approval to edit code.
- Never "just make a quick fix" without confirming first.

Before any code change, Cursor must:

1. Restate the user's requested change in clear, concise terms.
2. Ask a brief clarification question if intent is ambiguous.
3. Propose the exact change plan (files/components and what will be changed).
4. Ask for explicit approval and wait for a clear confirmation before applying edits.

Hard requirements:

- If approval is missing, ambiguous, implied, or partial, do not edit files.
- Repeat this confirmation process for every new requested change.
- If scope changes during implementation, pause and request new approval before continuing.
- Only make the minimum set of changes required to satisfy the confirmed request.
- Do not add opportunistic, "nice-to-have," refactor, cleanup, defensive, or stylistic changes unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- If any additional change is proposed beyond the confirmed scope, ask for explicit permission first and wait for clear approval.

# Git Push Clarity

- When pushing a branch, always use the explicit branch name in the command.
- Do not use `HEAD` shorthand in push commands.
- Prefer: `git push -u origin <branch_name>`.
