# Skill Forge — Ultimate Claude Code Skill Creator

## Project Overview

This repository contains **Skill Forge**, a Tier 4 Claude Code skill for creating,
reviewing, evolving, and publishing other Claude Code skills. It follows the Agent
Skills open standard and the 3-layer architecture (directive, orchestration, execution).

## Architecture

```

## Key Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Metadata always loaded, instructions on activation, resources on demand
2. **Description is King**: The YAML description field determines when skills activate
3. **3-Layer Architecture**: Directives (SKILL.md) + Orchestration (Claude) + Execution (scripts)
4. **Self-Annealing**: Learn from failures, update skills with discoveries
5. **Simplicity First**: Start with Tier 1, evolve to higher tiers only when needed

## Development Rules

- Test with `python skill-forge/scripts/validate_skill.py <path>` after changes
- Keep SKILL.md files under 500 lines / 5000 tokens
- Reference files should be focused and under 200 lines
- Scripts must have docstrings, CLI interface, JSON output
- Follow kebab-case naming for all skill directories
- Never put README.md inside skill folders
