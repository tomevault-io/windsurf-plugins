# Agent Instructions

**Testing policy: CI runs the full e2e suite on every PR — rely on it for PR verification, and locally run the specs your change touches (plus `npm test` for unit tests).**

## Testing Requirements

Every new feature MUST be accompanied by:

- **Unit tests** covering the API/logic layer (if applicable)
- **E2E tests** (Playwright) covering:
  - The happy path (full user journey)
  - Edge cases (empty states, error handling, boundary conditions)

Tests live in:

- `src/**/*.test.ts` - vitest unit tests — run with `npm test`
- `api/src/**/*.test.ts` - bun:test unit tests — run with `cd api && bun test` (vitest excludes `api/**`; don't mix the two runners)
- `e2e/` - Playwright end-to-end tests — run with `npm run test:e2e` (boots both servers against an isolated `tmp/e2e-data`, never the real `data/`)

CI runs all of these, plus the e2e suite a second time against the production Docker image (`E2E_EXTERNAL_SERVER=1` with the container mapped to :3456 for the UI and :3457 for the Hono API the browser calls directly) to cover the standalone build and `docker-entrypoint.sh`. That e2e image is the amd64 image that a merge to master publishes. The workflow applies a new tag to it. It does not build it again.

A release tag is the one exception. `release.yml` builds the image again at the tag, because `git describe` must resolve to the tag for the About panel to report it. The release e2e job then runs against that rebuilt image, so the artifact that ships is the artifact that CI tested.

## API Documentation

`api/openapi.json` is generated from the route table, and it must stay complete.

- Mount a new route module in `api/src/routes/registry.ts`, never in `api/src/index.ts`.
- Add one entry per endpoint to `api/src/lib/openapi/annotations.ts`, keyed `"<METHOD> <path>"`.
- Run `npm run gen:openapi` and commit `api/openapi.json` with the change.

`bun test` in `api/` fails while a route has no entry, or while the committed
document is stale. The document holds only the endpoints a personal access token
can reach. The scope map in `api/src/lib/auth.ts` decides that set.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 + React 19 — the front-end. It serves the UI only: no database, and **no `/api/*` routes** (the Next→Hono proxy was removed in #188).
- Hono on Bun is the API backend (`api/`), using Bun's native `bun:sqlite`. The browser talks to it **directly** — `src/lib/data-layer.ts` and the other client fetchers route every call through `apiFetch`/`apiUrl` from `src/lib/api-base.ts`, which reads the API origin from `window.__ENV__.API_URL`. That's injected at container start by `docker-entrypoint.sh` from the runtime `API_URL` env (written to `/__env.js`), since `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` bakes at build and can't be set on a prebuilt image; it falls back to `http://localhost:3457` for dev. The cross-origin calls rely on Hono's `app.use('*', cors())`. (better-sqlite3 survives only as a devDependency, for the `scripts/build-dictionary.ts` / `export-cached-entries.ts` tooling.)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (class-based dark mode via `@custom-variant`)
- shadcn/ui (Base UI primitives, `base-vega` style, zinc tokens) is initialized — add primitives with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` into `src/components/ui/` and extend them there. Adoption is gradual: prefer `ui/` components in new/touched code, don't hand-roll buttons/dialogs/menus, and don't mass-migrate existing ones

## Flow maps

Maps of every app domain are in `docs/flows/`. Open `docs/flows/index.html` to walk the graph. The Lector node has a First walk. When you change a listed path, update `docs/flows/graph-data.js` and the matching `.md` notes. Then run `node docs/flows/validate-graph.mjs`.

## Key Patterns

- Pages use `NavHeader` component for sidebar/bottom nav
- Desktop sidebar is 56 units wide (`sm:ml-56` on page wrapper)
- Dark mode uses `.dark` class on `<html>`, toggled via `ThemeToggle`
- Practice page has type and MC modes with a fallback MC option

## SRS Behaviour (implemented in `src/app/practice/page.tsx`)

- Intervals: 0/1/3/7/14 days for mastery levels 0/25/50/75/100, scheduled at the exact review time (no midnight flooring). Mastery-100 cards keep a 14-day maintenance review and are served when due.
- Correct answers move up one level (+25). A miss hard-resets the card to mastery 0 and re-queues it at the end of the round; the retry runs from mastery 0 and awards no points (the answer was just shown).
- Cloze words from the bank can carry trailing punctuation — always strip via `splitTrailingPunctuation` (`src/lib/words.ts`) before matching, displaying, or persisting them.

## Dates, Streaks & Time Zone

- Day rollover (daily stats, streaks, review days) uses the `timezone` setting (Settings → Time Zone), falling back to the server's zone — never raw UTC. Server helper: `api/src/lib/dates.ts` (`getTodayDate()`); pure client-side math in `src/lib/dates.ts`.
