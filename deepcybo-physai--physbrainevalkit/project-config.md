# Agent Instructions for PhysBrainEvalKit

This file is the operational guide for coding agents (including Codex and Claude Code) working in this repository. The goal is to configure a reproducible environment and run the public Qwen3-VL benchmark suite without relying on private project conventions.

## Scope and repository rules

- This repository evaluates Qwen3-VL-compatible Hugging Face models on spatial and embodied-intelligence benchmarks.
- Keep changes limited to evaluation code, documentation, tests, and reproducibility helpers.
- Never add model weights, dataset archives, generated results, runtime logs, API keys, or machine-specific absolute paths to the repository.
- Use environment variables for paths that differ between machines.
- Treat upstream datasets as governed by their own licenses and access requirements.
- Do not rewrite metric definitions or prompt formats unless the task explicitly requests a protocol change. Point-localization metrics are specified in `docs/final_point_metrics_protocol.md`.

## Environment setup

Run commands from the repository root. Use an existing compatible environment when available; otherwise create a local virtual environment:

```bash
python3 --version  # Python 3.10+ (Python 3.11 recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

GPU evaluation requires a CUDA-compatible PyTorch installation. The multi-worker launcher also requires Bash, `taskset`, and `nvidia-smi`:

```bash
command -v python3
python3 --version
command -v bash taskset nvidia-smi
python -c "import torch, transformers, datasets; print(torch.__version__, transformers.__version__)"
```

For a restricted or offline environment, set `HF_HOME` to a writable cache and pre-populate all required Hugging Face datasets and model files before starting the evaluation.

## Model requirements

The model path must be a local Hugging Face directory containing at least:

- `config.json`
- tokenizer and processor files
- model weight files

The runner recognizes Qwen3-VL model configurations. Verify the model before launching:

```bash
export MODEL_PATH=/path/to/qwen3_vl_model
test -f "$MODEL_PATH/config.json"
python - <<'PY'
import json, os
p = os.environ["MODEL_PATH"]
with open(os.path.join(p, "config.json")) as f:
    print(json.load(f).get("model_type"))
PY
```

Use an official or otherwise publicly redistributable Qwen3-VL checkpoint. Do not assume that a checkpoint from another model family is compatible.

## Dataset configuration

All 28 benchmarks in the default plan resolve public Hugging Face IDs. Configure the cache before starting Python:

```bash
export HF_HOME=/data/huggingface
export HF_DATASETS_CACHE=/data/huggingface/datasets
```

Standard datasets use `datasets.load_dataset`. RoboVQA, VLABench, MindCube, and 3DSRBench resolve Hub snapshots automatically and require no dedicated path variables. Follow the README's download instructions to populate caches for offline use. A dry run does not download or validate dataset files. Set `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` and `HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1` only after the selected datasets are cached.

RoboRefit uses the public `VLyb/RoboRefit-corrected` Hugging Face snapshot by default. The snapshot contains `qa.jsonl`, `images/`, and `masks/`; the adapter resolves it from the Hugging Face cache automatically. Individual entry points also accept explicit local paths for debugging.

ViewSpatial-Bench uses the public `lidingm/ViewSpatial-Bench` snapshot. Its annotations expose `image_path` rather than an `images` column, and the referenced files are stored in `scannetv2_val.zip` and `val2017.zip`; the adapter resolves these ZIP members automatically.

## Standard evaluation workflow

1. Inspect the benchmark plan and validate command-line options without loading samples:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/eval_qwen3vl.sh \
     --model-path "$MODEL_PATH" \
     --model-name qwen3-vl-public \
     --output-base /path/to/results/qwen3-vl-public \
     --gpus 0,1 \
     --models-per-gpu 2 \
     --cpu-per-worker 4 \
     --dry-run
   ```

2. Review the printed benchmark list. Use `--only NAME1,NAME2` or `--skip NAME` when datasets are unavailable. The default plan contains 28 non-judge benchmarks and does not run API-judge workloads.

3. Start the real evaluation by removing `--dry-run` and adding `--resume`:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/eval_qwen3vl.sh \
     --model-path "$MODEL_PATH" \
     --model-name qwen3-vl-public \
     --output-base /path/to/results/qwen3-vl-public \
     --gpus 0,1 \
     --models-per-gpu 2 \
     --cpu-per-worker 4 \
     --resume
   ```

4. Keep the same `--run-id` when restarting an interrupted run and shard reuse is desired. A new run ID starts a new shard namespace.

5. Inspect the output directory for per-benchmark summaries and raw predictions. Aggregate scores with:

   ```bash
   python scripts/summarize_benchmark_scores.py --help
   ```
