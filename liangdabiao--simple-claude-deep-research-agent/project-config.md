# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a **simplified multi-agent deep research system** for Claude Code. The system uses skills to orchestrate parallel research tasks through specialized agents.

**Design Philosophy**: Medium complexity, web-focused, practical - not too simple, not overly complex.

## Quick Start

### Using the Deep Research Skill

```
deep-research What are the most effective treatments for depression?
```

or:

```
@deep-research Compare AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
```

**Important**: Do NOT use `/deep-research` - slash commands are built-in and cannot be customized.

### Adding Citations

```
citations [paste your research report]
```

## Architecture

### Agent Types

1. **Research Lead Agent** (`.claude/skills/deep-research.md`)
   - Analyzes queries and determines query type
   - Plans research approach
   - Uses `Task` tool to launch parallel subagents
   - Synthesizes findings into final report

2. **Research Subagent** (`.claude/skills/research-subagent.md`)
   - Receives tasks from lead agent
   - Uses web tools (web_search, web_fetch, Playwright MCP)
   - Reports findings in dense format
   - Limited to 20 tool calls

3. **Citations Agent** (`.claude/skills/citations.md`)
   - Adds citations to completed reports
   - Uses footnote or inline citation style
   - Preserves original content

### Query Types

| Type | Description | Subagents | Example |
|------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Straightforward | Simple fact-finding | 1 | "What is Tokyo's population?" |
| Breadth-first | Independent sub-topics | 3 | "Compare AWS, Azure, GCP" |
| Depth-first | Multiple perspectives | 4 | "What caused the 2008 crisis?" |

## Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose | Used By |
|------|---------|---------|
| `web_search` | Search web | Lead, Subagent |
| `web_fetch` | Get full page content | Subagent |
| `mcp__playwright__navigate` | Load JS pages | Subagent |
| `mcp__playwright__snapshot` | Get rendered content | Subagent |
| `Task` | Launch subagents | Lead |

**Note**: Only web tools are used - no internal tools (GDrive, Gmail, Slack).

## Development Workflow

### Modifying Agent Behavior

**To change research strategy**: Edit `.claude/skills/deep-research.md`
- Query classification logic (lines 19-33)
- Subagent deployment rules (lines 52-96)
- Synthesis approach (lines 98-111)

**To modify subagent behavior**: Edit `.claude/skills/research-subagent.md`
- Tool usage patterns (lines 40-56)
- Source quality evaluation (lines 58-67)
- Report format (lines 69-94)

**To modify citations**: Edit `.claude/skills/citations.md`
- Citation style (lines 30-44)
- When to cite rules (lines 19-28)

### Skill File Format

All skills require YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: "Brief description of when to use this skill"
---
```

Followed by detailed instructions.

### Testing Changes

1. Edit skill files
2. Test with: `deep-research <test query>`
3. Iterate based on results

## Key Implementation Details

### Task Tool Usage

Lead agent launches subagents using:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  prompt="<clear task description>",
  model="sonnet"  # optional
)
```

**Parallel execution**: Launch 2-6 Task calls in a single message.

### Task Description Format

Each task must include:
1. **Specific objective** (1 core objective per subagent)
2. **Output format** (e.g., "list of facts", "detailed report")
3. **Background context** (why this task matters)
4. **Key questions** (what to answer)
5. **Suggested sources** (where to look)
6. **Scope boundaries** (what NOT to research)

### Subagent Constraints

- **Tool call budget**: 3-15 calls depending on complexity
- **Hard limit**: 20 tool calls maximum (terminated if exceeded)
- **Minimum**: 3 tool calls for meaningful research
- **Parallel**: Use 2+ web_search calls simultaneously

### Source Quality Evaluation

Subagents evaluate sources for:
- **Speculation**: "could", "may", "might" indicate predictions
- **Source type**: Original sources > aggregators
- **Bias**: Marketing language, cherry-picked data
- **Recency**: Current info preferred for time-sensitive topics
- **Consistency**: Cross-reference conflicting facts

### Report Format

**Subagent Report**:
```markdown
## Key Findings

- Fact 1 with source
- Fact 2 with source

## Summary

[Brief summary]

## Sources

[URLs]
```

**Final Report** (Lead agent):
```markdown
# [Title]

## Section 1

[Content with data points]

## Section 2

[Content with comparisons]

...
```
