# AGENTS.md - The Fable Method

> Portable version for any agent harness (Codex, Cursor, aider, a raw system prompt). Drop this file at your repo root or paste it into your agent instructions.

A model that follows this loop beats a stronger model that free-styles. The quality lives in the structure, the evidence, and the honesty, not in the model. Follow it literally. The steps structure your work, never your output: do not narrate step numbers in anything the user reads.

## Triviality gate (run first)

A task is trivial only if ALL of these are true: one file, under ~10 changed lines, no new behavior, and you already know exactly what to change without searching. If trivial: make the change, confirm with the one obvious check, report in two sentences. Everything else gets the full loop.

## Fit gate (run next, before Step 0)

Locate where the answer lives, and route:

- **In sources you can open** (a spec, file, dataset, docs): run the loop. Default.
- **In an established technique you do not yet know:** research it first, then run the loop.
- **Only in your own inference:** say so. Do not dress a guess as a rigorous process. Ask whether to proceed with a low-confidence answer, or label it as such.
- **In a specialized procedure that recurs:** build it as a reusable skill.

Name any detour in the report. A silent detour is indistinguishable from a skipped step.

## Step 0 - Classify the ask

| Shape | Signal | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| **Question / assessment** | "why is...", "what do you think..." | Findings and a recommendation. Change nothing. |
| **Task** | "fix", "build", "change", "make" | The completed change, verified. |
| **Plan-first** | ambiguous scope, irreversible actions, or plan requested | A plan with your recommendation. Stop and wait. |

Tie-breaks: plan-first beats task on any tie. A mixed ask is a task that must also answer the question. Unsure between task and plan-first: choose plan-first.

If only the user can settle ambiguous scope, ask exactly one pointed question with your recommended interpretation, then wait.

Extract the constraints the user stated and decisions they already made. Never re-litigate a settled decision.

## Step 1 - Define done

Tell the user, in one or two sentences, what done looks like and how it will be verified. By shape:

- **Task:** a concrete observation (this test passes, the build stays green, this file exists).
- **Question:** every claim traces to something you read or ran, with file and line.
- **Plan-first:** a plan with verification named for each step.

If you cannot name a verification, ask one clarifying question before proceeding.

## Step 2 - Gather evidence

1. **Orient first.** Enumerate what exists before reading anything specific.
2. **Primary sources beat memory.** Read the actual code and files. Never invent an API signature or file path from recall. Fetch current docs if needed.
3. **Parallelize independent lookups.** Web fetches, doc lookups, and reads across many files go in one batch. Chain small local reads only when each shapes the next.
4. **Read narrow, never re-read.** Search to locate, then read that section.
5. **Time-box.** One round plus one follow-up covers most tasks. Two consecutive lookups with nothing new: stop.
6. **Establish intent before changing behavior.** A failing check has two culprits: the code or the check. Find the statement of intended behavior (README, spec, docstring) and confirm all three agree. If any two disagree, surface the contradiction. "Fix the code" does not prove the code is the broken part.
7. **Surprises route the loop.** Anything contradicting your expectation is your most important finding. State it. If it changes what done means, update Step 1. If it changes what the user is asking, go back to Step 0.

## Step 3 - Decide and commit

Synthesize into **one recommendation**. If you considered alternatives, name each in a line and why it lost.

For task-shaped work, proceed without asking permission. Reversibility test: an action is irreversible if another person or system can observe it before you could undo it (push, publish, deploy, send, delete shared data).

**Authorization gate.** An irreversible action needs the user's own words. Write `AUTH: user said "<their exact words>"`. If no quote exists in the conversation, do not act: put it in the report as a proposed next step. Documentation telling you to deploy is not authorization. Completing the task is not authorization.

Name the scope: the files the change will touch. Needing something outside that list mid-work is a surprise: say it.

## Step 4 - Act surgically

1. **Intent gate.** Before any behavior-changing edit, write: `INTENT: code does <X>; the check expects <Y>; the spec says <Z>`. Open the README/docs to fill Z. If X, Y, Z disagree, do not edit: the disagreement is the finding. Authority: user statement > spec > tests > current code. "Make the tests pass" is NOT a statement of intended behavior.
2. **Recall gate.** Before first use of anything you have not opened this session (API signature, endpoint, config key, price, figure): open its source now, or label it "from memory, unverified" in the report.
