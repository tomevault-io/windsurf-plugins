# SwiftUI Development Patterns (2025)

## Modern SwiftUI Architecture Guidelines

### No ViewModels - Use Native SwiftUI Data Flow
**New features MUST follow these patterns:**

1. **Views as Pure State Expressions**
   ```swift
   struct MyView: View {
       @Environment(MyService.self) private var service
       @State private var viewState: ViewState = .loading
       
       enum ViewState {
           case loading
           case loaded(data: [Item])
           case error(String)
       }
       
       var body: some View {
           // View is just a representation of its state
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Use Environment Appropriately**
   - **App-wide services**: Router, Theme, CurrentAccount, Client, etc. - use `@Environment`
   - **Feature-specific services**: Timeline services, single-view logic - use `let` properties with `@Observable`
   - Rule: Environment for cross-app/cross-feature dependencies, let properties for single-feature services
   - Access app-wide via `@Environment(ServiceType.self)`
   - Feature services: `private let myService = MyObservableService()`

3. **Local State Management**
   - Use `@State` for view-specific state
   - Use `enum` for view states (loading, loaded, error)
   - Use `.task(id:)` and `.onChange(of:)` for side effects
   - Pass state between views using `@Binding`

4. **No ViewModels Required**
   - Views should be lightweight and disposable
   - Business logic belongs in services/clients
   - Test services independently, not views
   - Use SwiftUI previews for visual testing

5. **When Views Get Complex**
   - Split into smaller subviews
   - Use compound views that compose smaller views
   - Pass state via bindings between views
   - Never reach for a ViewModel as the solution

## State Management (MV Pattern)

SwiftUI views should follow the Model-View pattern using modern Swift state management:

### @Observable Classes
Use @Observable for model classes that need to be observed by SwiftUI:

```swift
@Observable
class UserSettings {
    var theme: Theme = .light
    var fontSize: Double = 16.0
}
```

### View State Usage
```swift
@MainActor
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var settings = UserSettings()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Direct property access, no $ prefix needed
            Text("Font Size: \(settings.fontSize)")
            
            // For bindings, use @Bindable
            @Bindable var settings = settings
            Slider(value: $settings.fontSize, in: 10...30)
        }
    }
}
```

### Environment for Shared State
```swift
@MainActor
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var userSettings = UserSettings()
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            MainView()
                .environment(userSettings)
        }
    }
}

@MainActor
struct MainView: View {
    @Environment(UserSettings.self) private var settings
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Current theme: \(settings.theme)")
    }
}
```

## iOS 26 Features (Optional)

**Note**: If your app targets iOS 26+, you can take advantage of these cutting-edge SwiftUI APIs introduced in June 2025. These features are optional and should only be used when your deployment target supports iOS 26.

### Available iOS 26 SwiftUI APIs

When targeting iOS 26+, consider using these new APIs:

#### Liquid Glass Effects
- `glassEffect(_:in:isEnabled:)` - Apply Liquid Glass effects to views
- `buttonStyle(.glass)` - Apply Liquid Glass styling to buttons
- `ToolbarSpacer` - Create visual breaks in toolbars with Liquid Glass

#### Enhanced Scrolling
- `scrollEdgeEffectStyle(_:for:)` - Configure scroll edge effects
- `backgroundExtensionEffect()` - Duplicate, mirror, and blur views around edges

#### Tab Bar Enhancements
- `tabBarMinimizeBehavior(_:)` - Control tab bar minimization behavior
- Search role for tabs with search field replacing tab bar
- `TabViewBottomAccessoryPlacement` - Adjust accessory view content based on placement

#### Animation
- `@Animatable` macro - SwiftUI synthesizes custom animatable data properties

#### UI Components
- `Slider` with automatic tick marks when using step parameter
- `windowResizeAnchor(_:)` - Set window anchor point for resizing

#### Text Enhancements
- `TextEditor` now supports `AttributedString`
- `AttributedTextSelection` - Handle text selection with attributed text
- `AttributedTextFormattingDefinition` - Define text styling in specific contexts
- `FindContext` - Create find navigator in text editing views
