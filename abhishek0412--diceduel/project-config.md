- Implemented progressive disclosure for learning features

**Polish Features**:
- 1-second rolling animation with visual feedback
- Context-aware messaging ("🎉 Perfect!", "🔥 So close!")
- Educational probability hints after 3+ games

## 🛠️ AI Tools & Techniques Used

### Primary AI Assistant
- **GitHub Copilot**: Main development assistant for code generation
- **Model**: GPT-4 based with coding specialization
- **Integration**: VS Code extension with workspace context

### Prompting Strategies

#### 1. **Structured Task Breakdown**
```
"Implement the core dice rolling logic with state management for wins/losses"
```
- Clear, actionable prompts with specific deliverables
- Focus on single responsibility per request
- Include context about existing codebase

#### 2. **Progressive Enhancement**
```
"Add visual dice representation using emoji or CSS, with roll animation"
```
- Build features incrementally
- Reference previous implementation for context
- Specify both functional and visual requirements

#### 3. **Mobile-First Constraints**
```
"Make the layout mobile-responsive with large touch-friendly buttons"
```
- Include accessibility and usability requirements
- Specify technical constraints (touch targets, responsive design)
- Emphasize user experience considerations

### Code Quality Patterns

#### **Single Component Architecture**
- Kept all logic in `App.jsx` until MVP completion
- Used React hooks for state management
- Avoided premature abstraction or over-engineering

#### **Inline Styling Strategy**
- Used object-based styling for rapid iteration
- Maintained consistency through style reuse
- Enabled quick responsive adjustments

#### **Mobile-First Development**
- Prioritized touch-friendly interactions
- Implemented responsive flexbox layouts
- Used relative units and breakpoint considerations

## 📊 AI Effectiveness Analysis

#### **Speed & Productivity**
- **10x faster** initial implementation vs traditional coding
- Reduced boilerplate and repetitive coding tasks
- Instant generation of responsive UI patterns

#### **Code Quality**
- Consistent naming conventions and structure
- Proper React patterns (hooks, state management)
- Built-in accessibility considerations

#### **Feature Completeness**
- Comprehensive game logic with edge case handling
- Professional UI with animations and feedback
- Persistent data storage implementation

### Areas Requiring Human Oversight

## 🎮 Game-Specific AI Contributions

### Random Number Generation
```javascript
const rolls = Array.from({ length: diceCount }, () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1)
```
- Proper random dice rolling implementation
- Array generation with functional programming patterns
- Immediate sum calculation and validation

### Feedback System
```javascript
const diff = Math.abs(parseInt(prediction) - sum)
if (diff === 1) {
  setGameMessage('🔥 So close! Try again!')
} else if (diff <= 2) {
  setGameMessage('👍 Close! You\'re getting better!')
}
```
- Dynamic messaging based on prediction accuracy
- Encouraging feedback to maintain engagement
- Emoji integration for visual appeal

### Probability Education
```javascript
{gamesPlayed >= 3 && (
  <div>💡 Tip: With {diceCount} dice, sums near the middle are more likely!</div>
)}
```
- Progressive disclosure of educational content
- Context-aware probability hints
- Subtle learning integration without disrupting gameplay

## 🔄 Iterative Development Process
