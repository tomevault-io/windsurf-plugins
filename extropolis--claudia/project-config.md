# Claudia Development Guide

## CRITICAL: DO NOT RESTART THE SERVER

**NEVER run `./start.sh`, `.\start.ps1`, `npm run dev`, or kill/restart the server during development.**

The backend uses `tsx watch` which **automatically reloads** when you change `.ts` files in `backend/src/`:
- Write code → Wait 1-2 seconds → Changes are live
- No restart needed!

**Why?** Restarting the server while tasks are running causes:
- Out of Memory (OOM) crashes (exit code 137)
- Nested server instances that consume all system memory
- Loss of active task connections

## Architecture Overview

- **Backend** (`backend/src/`): Express + WebSocket server, PTY task management via node-pty, MCP server integration
- **Frontend** (`frontend/src/`): React + Vite, xterm.js terminal emulation, Zustand state management
- **Shared** (`shared/src/`): TypeScript types shared between backend and frontend
- Backend port: **4001** (HTTP + WebSocket)
- Frontend dev port: **5173** (Vite)

### Key Backend Files
- `task-spawner.ts` — Core task lifecycle: create, reconnect, disconnect, state polling, history management
- `server.ts` — Express routes, WebSocket handlers, MCP config sync
- `config-store.ts` — Persisted configuration (model, pricing, MCP servers)
- `token-parser.ts` — Parse Claude Code JSONL session files for token usage
- `claudia-mcp-server.ts` — MCP server injected into Claude Code sessions

### Key Frontend Files
- `TerminalView.tsx` — xterm.js terminal with resize buffering, history chunking, scroll-up lazy loading
- `WorkspacePanel.tsx` — Workspace list, task creation, drag-and-drop, collapsible sidebar
- `useWebSocket.ts` — WebSocket connection management with reconnection
- `taskStore.ts` — Zustand store for task/workspace state

## Auto-Reload Development

1. Write code in `backend/src/`
2. Wait 1-2 seconds for automatic reload (watch for "restarted" in logs)
3. Test with the CLI or browser
4. **Never restart the server manually**

## Testing

Always test changes using the CLI (`backend/test-cli.ts`):

```bash
cd backend
npx tsx test-cli.ts --list-tasks
npx tsx test-cli.ts -m "your prompt" -w /path/to/workspace
npx tsx test-cli.ts --help
```

Unit tests:
```bash
npm test                  # all packages
npm test -w backend       # one package
```

Add CLI functionality if needed for testing. Ensure adequate logging to debug issues.

### Coverage

Vitest reports coverage per package, which hides the repo-wide picture. Use the
aggregator for the real number:

```bash
npm run coverage:run      # run all suites, aggregate, gate
npm run coverage          # aggregate existing output (fast, no re-run)
npm run coverage:baseline # accept current numbers as the new floor
```

`npm run coverage` prints per-package and repo-wide totals, the weakest
directories, the biggest untested files, and an **API-surface audit**: which
HTTP routes, WebSocket message types, and MCP tools have no test referencing
them at all. Line coverage alone cannot tell you that a whole route is
unreachable from the suite.

**Three gates run in CI, and all three must pass:**

1. **Per-file thresholds** (`*/vitest.config.ts`) — floors for individual
   modules. Raise them as coverage improves; never lower them.
2. **Repo-wide ratchet** (`coverage-baseline.json`) — the aggregate total may
   never drop. Improving coverage means running `npm run coverage:baseline`
   and committing the new floor.
3. **New-file floor** — any source file added relative to `origin/main` must
   hit 60% line coverage. This is what the per-file allowlists structurally
   cannot do, since nobody remembers to add a new file to them.

Notes:
- `shared/` is aliased to its **source** in the backend and frontend vitest
  configs. Without that alias the suites import `shared/dist`, so a stale build
  means green tests over old code.
- An empty coverage report is treated as an error, not as 100%. A package with
  no vitest config yet is skipped with a note instead.

**Gotcha:** integration tests must create temp dirs under `homedir()`, not
`os.tmpdir()`. On macOS `/tmp` resolves under `/var`, which
`validateWorkspacePath` blocklists as a system path — workspace operations get
rejected before ever reaching the code under test.

## Starting the Server (Initial Startup Only)

**Only use this when the server is NOT running (e.g., after system reboot):**

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
./start.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

Duplicate starts are prevented by the single-instance lock: the backend claims
`<dataDir>/instance.json` (`backend/src/instance-lock.ts`) and refuses to boot a
second time against the same data directory, whatever port it was given.
`start.sh` checks the same file first so it can point you at the running server.
Ask a live backend who it is with `curl localhost:4001/api/server-info`.

## Cross-Platform Notes

- **Windows**: Use `.\start.ps1` for startup. Use forward slashes `/` for paths in code, backslashes `\` in shell commands. PowerShell folder dialogs require `-STA` flag.
- **macOS/Linux**: Use `./start.sh` for startup.
- The codebase uses `@homebridge/node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch` for cross-platform PTY support.
