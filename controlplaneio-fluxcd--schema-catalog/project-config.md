# Agent guide

This repository hosts a catalog of JSON Schemas and field indexes for
Kubernetes, OpenShift, the Flux ecosystem and other CNCF projects. The
schemas power `flux-schema validate`; the `.fields.txt` indexes are an
offline `kubectl explain` replacement for AI agents (one greppable line per
field: dotted path, type, constraints, description).

Two subsystems, each with its own reference doc — read the relevant one before
changing that subsystem:

- **`build/`** — the Bun/TypeScript builder that generates `catalog/` from
  `sources.yaml`. Dataflow, module map, extraction model, history-manifest
  invariants and the add-a-source recipe: [build/README.md](build/README.md).
- **`web/`** — the Cloudflare Worker that serves the catalog, explorer UI and
  MCP endpoint. Architecture, routing, caching and index generation:
  [web/README.md](web/README.md).

## Layout

| Path                        | What it is                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `catalog/<group>/`          | **Generated.** `<kind>_<version>.json` + `.fields.txt` siblings  |
| `build/config/sources.yaml` | Catalog sources config — the only file to edit to add a project  |
| `build/history/*.json`      | **Generated.** Per-source provenance manifests                   |
| `build/`                    | The Bun build system ([build/README.md](build/README.md))        |
| `web/`                      | The Cloudflare Worker: catalog serving, UI, MCP ([web/README.md](web/README.md)) |
| `README.md`                 | Versions table between markers is **generated**                  |
| `.github/workflows/`        | `test.yaml` (lint+test), `update-catalog.yaml` (daily build+PR)  |
| `plans/`                    | Git-ignored local scratch — never reference it in committed files |

## Rules

- **Never hand-edit generated files**: everything under `catalog/`,
  `build/history/`, and the README versions table is owned by the build.
  They ship from CI (`update-catalog`), which signs attestations for the
  history manifests; locally built copies break verification, so run
  `make build` to verify a change but do not commit its output. If pushing
  locally built manifests is ever unavoidable, force-dispatch
  `update-catalog` right after to rebuild and re-attest everything.
- **Bun-native only**: no npm runtime dependencies (`@types/bun` is the only
  dev dependency), no eslint/prettier. Reach for `Bun.YAML`, `Bun.semver`,
  `Bun.$`, `bun test` and node builtins.
- **Adding a catalog source is config-only**: the commit is the
  `build/config/sources.yaml` edit and nothing else, no code, no test
  changes, no generated files (CI builds and attests those). See the
  [recipe](build/README.md#adding-a-source).
- **flux-schema binary**: resolved from `FLUX_SCHEMA_BIN` (a single binary
  path), else PATH. Locally, Bun auto-loads the git-ignored `build/.env`;
  CI installs a released CLI via `fluxcd/flux-schema/actions/setup`.
- **GitHub Actions are pinned to commit SHAs** (with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment).
  When bumping a pin, dereference annotated tags to the underlying commit —
  the tag object SHA will not resolve.
- **Commits**: signed off (`git commit -s`), compact and logically split;
  generated catalog and history files stay out of local commits and ship
  through the `update-catalog` PR instead.

## Commands

```shell
make deps    # bun install (needed before lint)
make lint    # tsc --noEmit against build/tsconfig.json
make test    # bun test — pure logic only, needs no Flux CLIs or network
make build   # full catalog build; FORCE_BUILD=1 and BUILD_SUMMARY=<path> opt in
```

The underlying `bun src/main.ts build|regen` flags and env vars are documented
in [build/README.md](build/README.md#cli); the `make web-*` targets (build,
run, dev, sync, deploy, archive) are listed in
[web/README.md](web/README.md#commands).

## Verification

- Pure-logic changes: `make lint test`.
- Extractor/resolver/sync changes: additionally run a real single-source
  build (`bun src/main.ts build --source flagger --force` is the fastest),
  confirm the second run reports "up to date", and restore any churned
  `build/history` timestamps before committing
  (`git checkout -- build/history`).
- Catalog-wide claims (e.g. "validation still works"): run `flux-schema
  validate <manifests> --schema-location ./catalog` against a real example.
- Web changes: `bun run lint && bun test` inside `web/`, plus the smoke
  matrix in [web/README.md](web/README.md#verification) for serving changes.
  Verify MCP serving changes end to end with `bun scripts/mcp-e2e-test.ts`
  from `web/` (or `bun run mcp-e2e`); it runs the full modern-plus-legacy
  protocol suite against production by default and accepts a base URL for a
  local Wrangler dev instance.

## CI

`test.yaml` runs lint+test on PRs and main, path-filtered to the build
system. `update-catalog.yaml` runs daily and on dispatch (optional force
input): it builds the catalog, and only when the build signals
`changed=true` it smoke-tests the result by validating
`fluxcd/flux2-kustomize-helm-example` against the local catalog, then opens
a PR whose body is the build's own `--summary` output (only changed sources,
never the full list).
