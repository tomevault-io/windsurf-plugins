# Agent Guidelines

Katl produces KatlOS, an installable, upgradeable, systemd-native Kubernetes node OS. Keep work inside that product boundary and do not preserve compatibility for designs that have not shipped.

## Product Principles

- Optimize the supported journey for a home-lab operator on a trusted network. Routine install, configuration, bootstrap, upgrade, and management should be direct and unsurprising.
- Do not expose internal metadata, artifacts, or verification steps as operator ceremony. Calculate and carry integrity information internally. Keep stricter provenance or pinning optional for users with a different threat model.
- Default routine operations to the least disruptive safe behavior. Require confirmation only for genuinely destructive or ambiguous actions, and make errors explain what the operator should do next.
- Treat local, remote, and automation paths as one product experience. Every supported interface needs clear state, progress, and recovery guidance.
- Keep release artifacts self-contained for supported journeys. Avoid hidden prerequisites or separately distributed implementation artifacts when Katl can package, discover, or generate them.
- Katl prepares and manages Kubernetes nodes; it is not a Kubernetes distribution or a replacement for user-managed GitOps.
- Keep implementation details behind KatlOS workflows unless an expert interface specifically needs them.

## Engineering Boundaries

- Use Go for product policy, state machines, validation, planning, agents, and reusable logic that benefits from unit tests.
- Keep shell to small hooks and orchestration. Shell must not own installer policy, disk layout decisions, update policy, or other substantial state machines.
- Use mkosi as the image builder through `scripts/mkosi`; do not turn mkosi hooks into the installer engine.
- Use the libvirt-backed `scripts/vmtest-run` world for automated VM testing. Do not add competing VM runners without an explicit product need.
- Prefer native systemd primitives and configuration. Do not hide systemd behind a lossy abstraction; allow native passthrough where it is the clearest interface.
- Keep the runtime root immutable and versioned. Persistent identity and workload state belong on writable state storage; `/run` is ephemeral.
- Assume EFI-only boot unless a durable design decision expands the supported scope.
- Do not commit host-specific paths such as user home directories, `/nix/store`, `/run/current-system`, or `/etc/profiles`. Use `PATH`, repository-relative paths, containerized tooling, or explicit local overrides.
- Published images and release artifacts must not contain VM test agents, fixtures, or other test-only support code.

## Testing and Release Confidence

- Test operator-visible outcomes and durable contracts, not incidental formatting, timing, generated ordering, or implementation details. Fix systemic test design when failures reveal overspecification; do not mask flakes with retries or looser assertions.
- Design install and lifecycle behavior as typed, idempotent, testable transitions. Use unit tests for policy and planning, golden tests for generated assets, and VM tests for integrated boot and lifecycle journeys.
- Release-critical services must participate in health semantics and be asserted directly in the relevant VM journey. A successful boot marker is not proof that operator access or management paths work.
- `go test ./...` is the baseline unit and golden gate, not evidence that VM, boot, install, update, or kubeadm flows ran.
- Changes affecting VM infrastructure, fixtures, boot, installation, updates, disk layout, or kubeadm state must run the relevant `scripts/vmtest-run ... -count=1` gate on a capable host. If unavailable, record the exact capability gap and command still required.
- Verify generated systemd units with `systemd-analyze verify` where practical. Risky boot, disk, update, security, or kubeadm changes also require focused review.
- Use delete-on-success retention for routine VM gates. Keep large run output only while debugging and remove it afterwards.
- A release should exercise the same artifacts and supported journeys users receive. Do not infer release readiness solely from unit tests or a successful artifact build.
- Every user-facing change must pass hands-on user-journey validation in a persistent `katldev` VM through the public `katlctl` interface before it is landed. Automated `vmtest` coverage, unit tests, direct inspection of internal state, and a journey run for an earlier change do not substitute for this gate.
- Exercise the parts of the journey affected by the change, including representative happy paths, repeat operations or applies, online changes, next-boot or reboot behavior, and safe failure or recovery paths where applicable. Verify actual Linux, systemd, Kubernetes, and persisted-state outcomes from an operator-accessible surface without relying on internal shortcuts.
