# Git Commits - No Co-authors

## Rule

**NEVER add Co-authors to git commits.**

When creating git commits, do NOT include:
- `Co-authored-by:` trailers
- `--co-author` flags
- Any co-author metadata in commit messages

## Examples

```bash
# ❌ BAD - Do NOT do this
git commit -m "Update dependencies" --co-author="John Doe <john@example.com>"

# ❌ BAD - Do NOT add Co-authored-by trailers
git commit -m "Fix bug

Co-authored-by: John Doe <john@example.com>"

# ✅ GOOD - Simple commit without co-authors
git commit -m "Update dependencies"

# ✅ GOOD - Multi-line commit without co-authors
git commit -m "Fix bug

Fixed issue with audio processing"
```

## Rationale

This project does not use Co-authors in commit history. All commits should be attributed to the primary author only.
