# pgledger

Double-entry bookkeeping ledger implemented entirely as PostgreSQL functions and views. No application-level code — install the SQL, call the functions.

## Architecture

Three tables, three views, and a small set of SQL functions:

- **pgledger_accounts** — each account has a name, currency, balance, version, and optional balance constraints
- **pgledger_transfers** — each transfer moves a positive amount from one account to another (same currency)
- **pgledger_entries** — two entries per transfer (debit and credit), recording previous and current balance

Views (`pgledger_accounts_view`, `pgledger_transfers_view`, `pgledger_entries_view`) are the public query interface. The entries view joins to transfers to include `event_at` and `metadata`.

All IDs are prefixed ULIDs: `pgla_*` (accounts), `pglt_*` (transfers), `pgle_*` (entries). Generated from UUIDv7 converted to ULID.

## Core API

```sql
-- Create an account (returns pgledger_accounts_view row)
pgledger_create_account(
    name TEXT,
    currency TEXT,
    allow_negative_balance BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    allow_positive_balance BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT NULL
) → SETOF pgledger_accounts_view

-- Create a single transfer (returns pgledger_transfers_view row)
pgledger_create_transfer(
    from_account_id TEXT,
    to_account_id TEXT,
    amount NUMERIC,
    event_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NULL,
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT NULL
) → SETOF pgledger_transfers_view

-- Create multiple transfers atomically (returns pgledger_transfers_view rows)
pgledger_create_transfers(
    transfer_requests TRANSFER_REQUEST[],
    event_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NULL,
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT NULL
) → SETOF pgledger_transfers_view

-- VARIADIC convenience form
pgledger_create_transfers(
    VARIADIC transfer_requests TRANSFER_REQUEST[]
) → SETOF pgledger_transfers_view
```

`transfer_request` is a composite type: `(from_account_id TEXT, to_account_id TEXT, amount NUMERIC)`.

## Key constraints and design decisions

- Amounts must be positive; the direction is determined by from/to
- from_account_id must differ from to_account_id
- Transfers between accounts with different currencies are rejected
- Multi-currency exchange uses 4 accounts (2 user + 2 liquidity) and `pgledger_create_transfers`
- Accounts lock in sorted ID order to prevent deadlocks
- `event_at` records when the real-world event happened; `created_at` records when the ledger entry was written
- Balance constraints are checked after each update — set both `allow_negative_balance=false` and `allow_positive_balance=false` to freeze an account
- Account `version` increments on every transfer touching that account

## Implementation

- `pgledger.sql` — the entire implementation (tables, views, functions)
- `vendor/scoville-pgsql-ulid/` — ULID↔UUID conversion functions (must be installed first)

## Development

Requires Docker (for PostgreSQL) and mise (for tool versions).

```bash
mise install           # install tool versions (go, uv, just, golangci-lint)
docker compose up      # start PostgreSQL
just check             # full suite: dbreset, clean, tidy, format-sql, test, lint
```

Common commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `just test` | Run Go tests (`go test -v ./...` in `go/`) |
| `just dbreset` | Drop, recreate, and reload the schema |
| `just lint` | Run deadcode, sqlfluff, and golangci-lint |
| `just format-sql` | Format SQL with sqlfluff |
| `just benchmark` | Run Go benchmarks |
| `just run-examples` | Execute example SQL scripts and update `.out` files |
| `just psql` | Open a psql shell |

## Testing

Tests are Go integration tests in `go/test/` using pgx and testify. They connect to PostgreSQL at `postgres://pgledger:pgledger@localhost:5432/pgledger`. All tests call the SQL functions directly and verify results through the views.

Test helpers in `go/test/test_helpers.go` define Go structs (Account, Transfer, Entry) that map to the view columns, plus helper functions for creating accounts, transfers, and querying entries.

Tests run in parallel. The schema must be loaded before running tests (`just dbreset`).

PostgreSQL versions 15, 16, 17, and 18 are tested in CI.

## SQL formatting

SQL files are formatted with sqlfluff (via `uvx sqlfluff@4.0.0`). Configuration is in `.sqlfluff`.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains executable SQL scripts with `.sql.out` files showing their output:
- `basic-example.sql` — payment flow with receivables and pending accounts
- `multi-currency.sql` — currency exchange using liquidity accounts
- `lock-account.sql` — freezing an account via balance constraints
- `reconciliation.sql` — metadata-based reconciliation patterns
