Coding Conventions for FREE-MAD (Single Source of Truth)

- Use immutable dataclasses: prefer `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for all value objects, responses, transcripts, scores, and config-like records. Avoid mutable dictionaries internally; dictionaries are allowed only at API boundaries for JSON/Markdown output serialization.
- Use enums for categories: use `enum.StrEnum` for string-like categories (e.g., decisions, round types, score actions, tie-break strategies, validator names, section markers, logging events). Never compare raw string literals; compare enum members or their `.value`.
- Serialization: convert dataclasses/enums to primitive dicts via explicit `to_dict()` helpers at the boundary (CLI output, transcripts, files). Keep internal state strongly typed.
- Type checking: a `mypy.ini` is provided with strict-ish settings; prefer adding `from __future__ import annotations` and annotating all public functions. CI can run `mypy` when available.
- Determinism: any randomness must be seeded from the config to ensure deterministic tests.
- No shell=True and maintain CLI allowlist from config. Enforce budgets and size caps; include truncation markers where applied.
