# agent-inspect — Cursor guardrails

## Source of truth

- **Product, architecture, MVP scope, public API, data model, JSONL schema:** repo top-level docs (start with `README.md`)
- **Step-by-step implementation sequence:** follow the repo’s implementation guide (if present) and existing patterns in `packages/`

## MVP drift (do not implement unless the PRD explicitly promotes it)

- No SQLite
- No replay
- No token counting
- No cost calculation
- No framework adapters
- No browser dashboard
- No OpenTelemetry
- No plugin system
- No general-purpose logger API

agent-inspect must not become a logger library. The core concept is an **execution tree of steps**.

## Engineering requirements

- **TypeScript:** strict mode; match repo `tsconfig` settings.
- **Tests:** add or update tests when implementation behavior changes.
- **Instrumentation safety:** tracing, stepping, or observation must never throw into user code in a way that breaks the agent; failures degrade gracefully (see PRD).


## General guidance
Please ask questions and get clarify if you are not clear on any decisions or implementations.
