description: PowerSync skill — follow AGENTS.md playbook; powersync login is Cloud-only

# PowerSync agent skills

When editing or when the user’s task involves PowerSync:

1. Open **skills/powersync/AGENTS.md** and follow **Agent compliance** and the numbered onboarding playbook. Do not assume backend or Cloud vs self-hosted.
2. Prefer the **PowerSync CLI** per that file; do not hand-roll deployable config unless the user explicitly cannot use the CLI.
3. **`powersync login`** is for **PowerSync Cloud** (PAT) only — not for authenticating to a **self-hosted** service. Self-hosted: `powersync init self-hosted`, Docker commands, `PS_ADMIN_TOKEN` on the service.

If instructions here conflict with a “faster” approach, the playbook wins unless the user explicitly overrides.
