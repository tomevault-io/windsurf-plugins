# Monstera Development Guide

## Development stage: no backward compatibility

Monstera is being actively developed and has no wide adoption yet. We do NOT care about
backward compatibility or breaking interface changes at the moment — do not weaken a design to
preserve existing interfaces, wire formats, serialized state, or on-disk layouts. The goal is
the best possible design and implementation now; compatibility guarantees come later, once
there is wide adoption. When a breaking change is the better design, make it (and update all
callers, including sibling repos like `grackle`), rather than adding compatibility shims,
optional escape hatches, or versioned/legacy paths. In protobufs specifically: do not add
`reserved` statements for removed fields and do not preserve old field numbers — renumber
fields freely to keep the schema clean.

## Architecture

Read [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) first — it is a dense orientation to the codebase
(request path, key files, invariants, concurrency map, codegen model, and open issues) written
for effective work on deep features without re-researching the codebase each session. See 
`docs/` for user-facing documentation.

Keep `ARCHITECTURE.md` updated when any significant change or feature is done.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
make generate                 # generate all protobufs
make build                    # fully build Monstera (including generation)
go test -v --race ./...       # run all tests with Go directly
make lint                     # run linter, static check, go vet
```

## Domain conventions

- Shard keys are `cluster.ShardKey` (uint32) everywhere — never raw `[]byte`. Every uint32 value is
  a valid key, and shard bounds are ShardKeys too (`fixed32` in the cluster proto). The canonical
  4-byte big-endian encoding (`ShardKey.Bytes()` / `ShardKeyFromBytes`), which sorts identically to
  the integers, is used only at the edges: JSON hex bounds, derived shard ids, and row-range scans
  in persisted cores. The absence of a key (direct-shard requests, shard-wide updates) is always an
  explicit signal — a `HasShardKey` bool on transport requests, the `CommandRouting` enum on
  replicated commands — never a zero value or empty-slice sentinel.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow standard Go formatting (gofmt/goimports)
- Import order: standard lib, external packages (including other `evrblk/*` repositories), then `evrblk/monstera` packages
- Error handling: Always check errors with `if err != nil { return ... }`
- Document all exported functions, types, and variables
- Use table-driven tests when appropriate
- Use `testify/require` for test assertions
- In tests use `EqualValues` when comparing integers instead of `Equal` with a typecast
- Do not mention in comments things from the past (what was replaced) and do not mention design docs and implementation phases
