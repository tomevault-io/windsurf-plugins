- Support PHP 8.2+

## Symfony Package Development Guideline

- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools
- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports

## Documentation Guidelines

- Document all public methods and classes with PHPDoc annotations.
- Include `@param`, `@return`, and `@throws` tags for all methods.
- Document configuration options with sample values and explanations.
- Keep documentation up-to-date when changing functionality.
- Use descriptive variable and method names to improve self-documentation.
- Add inline comments for complex logic explaining the "why" not just the "what".
- Create markdown documentation for end-users in the docs/ directory.
- Include version compatibility information in all documentation.
- Document breaking changes prominently in CHANGELOG.md and README.md.
- Add type hints and return types to all methods for better IDE support.
- Document expected environment variables and their purposes.
- Maintain a FAQ section in the documentation for common issues.

- When specifying types, especially for nullable types, do not use ?string. Always write string|null instead of using ?, and make sure null is placed at the end.
