# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Overview

Scaffold-ETH 2 (SE-2) is a starter kit for building dApps on Ethereum. It comes in **two flavors** based on the Solidity framework:

- **Hardhat flavor**: Uses `packages/hardhat` with hardhat-deploy plugin
- **Foundry flavor**: Uses `packages/foundry` with Forge scripts

Both flavors share the same frontend package:

- **packages/nextjs**: React frontend (Next.js App Router, not Pages Router, RainbowKit, Wagmi, Viem, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI)

### Detecting Which Flavor You're Using

Check which package exists in the repository:

- If `packages/hardhat` exists → **Hardhat flavor** (follow Hardhat instructions)
- If `packages/foundry` exists → **Foundry flavor** (follow Foundry instructions)

## Common Commands

Commands work the same for both flavors unless noted otherwise:

```bash
# Development workflow (run each in separate terminal)
yarn chain          # Start local blockchain (Hardhat or Anvil)
yarn deploy         # Deploy contracts to local network
yarn start          # Start Next.js frontend at http://localhost:3000

# Code quality
yarn lint           # Lint both packages
yarn format         # Format both packages

# Building
yarn next:build     # Build frontend
yarn compile        # Compile Solidity contracts

# Contract verification (works for both)
yarn verify --network <network>

# Account management (works for both)
yarn generate            # Generate new deployer account
yarn account:import      # Import existing private key
yarn account             # View current account info

# Deploy to live network
yarn deploy --network <network>   # e.g., sepolia, mainnet, base

yarn vercel:yolo --prod # for deployment of frontend
```

## Architecture

### Smart Contract Development

#### Hardhat Flavor

- Contracts: `packages/hardhat/contracts/`
- Deployment scripts: `packages/hardhat/deploy/` (uses hardhat-deploy plugin)
- Tests: `packages/hardhat/test/`
- Config: `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`
- Deploying specific contract:
  - If the deploy script has:
    ```typescript
    // In packages/hardhat/deploy/01_deploy_my_contract.ts
    deployMyContract.tags = ["MyContract"];
    ```
  - `yarn deploy --tags MyContract`

#### Foundry Flavor

- Contracts: `packages/foundry/contracts/`
- Deployment scripts: `packages/foundry/script/` (uses custom deployment strategy)
  - Example: `packages/foundry/script/Deploy.s.sol` and `packages/foundry/script/DeployYourContract.s.sol`
- Tests: `packages/foundry/test/`
- Config: `packages/foundry/foundry.toml`
- Deploying a specific contract:
  - Create a separate deployment script and run `yarn deploy --file DeployYourContract.s.sol`

#### Both Flavors

- After `yarn deploy`, ABIs are auto-generated to `packages/nextjs/contracts/deployedContracts.ts`

### Frontend Contract Interaction

**Correct interact hook names (use these):**

- `useScaffoldReadContract` - NOT ~~useScaffoldContractRead~~
- `useScaffoldWriteContract` - NOT ~~useScaffoldContractWrite~~

Contract data is read from two files in `packages/nextjs/contracts/`:

- `deployedContracts.ts`: Auto-generated from deployments
- `externalContracts.ts`: Manually added external contracts

#### Reading Contract Data

```typescript
const { data: totalCounter } = useScaffoldReadContract({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  functionName: "userGreetingCounter",
  args: ["0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"],
});
```

#### Writing to Contracts

```typescript
const { writeContractAsync, isPending } = useScaffoldWriteContract({
  contractName: "YourContract",
});

await writeContractAsync({
  functionName: "setGreeting",
  args: [newGreeting],
  value: parseEther("0.01"), // for payable functions
});
```

#### Reading Events

```typescript
const { data: events, isLoading } = useScaffoldEventHistory({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  eventName: "GreetingChange",
  watch: true,
  fromBlock: 31231n,
  blockData: true,
});
```

SE-2 also provides other hooks to interact with blockchain data: `useScaffoldWatchContractEvent`, `useScaffoldEventHistory`, `useDeployedContractInfo`, `useScaffoldContract`, `useTransactor`.

**IMPORTANT: Always use hooks from `packages/nextjs/hooks/scaffold-eth` for contract interactions. Always refer to the hook names as they exist in the codebase.**

### UI Components

**Always use `@scaffold-ui/components` library for web3 UI components:**

- `Address`: Display ETH addresses with ENS resolution, blockie avatars, and explorer links
- `AddressInput`: Input field with address validation and ENS resolution
- `Balance`: Show ETH balance in ether and USD
- `EtherInput`: Number input with ETH/USD conversion toggle
- `IntegerInput`: Integer-only input with wei conversion

### Styling

**Use DaisyUI classes** for building frontend components.

```tsx
// ✅ Good - using DaisyUI classes
<button className="btn btn-primary">Connect</button>
<div className="card bg-base-100 shadow-xl">...</div>

// ❌ Avoid - raw Tailwind when DaisyUI has a component
<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded">Connect</button>
```

### Configure Target Network before deploying to testnet / mainnet.
