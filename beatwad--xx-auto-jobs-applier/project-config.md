- **Automated Job Search**: Scans hh.ru for vacancies matching specified criteria.
- **AI-Powered Evaluation**: Uses LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) to score vacancies on "interestingness" (1-100) based on user profile.
- **Smart Applications**:
  - Auto-generates personalized cover letters.
  - Answers employer questions (multiple choice, checkboxes, text) using AI.
  - Handles CAPTCHA via Telegram integration (sends screenshot to chat for user solution).
- **Resume Management**:
  - Can auto-raise resume in search results.
  - Generates resume improvement recommendations.
  - (Experimental) Creates tailored resumes for specific jobs (`RESUME_MODE`).
- **Monitoring & Logging**:
  - Comprehensive logging to files and Telegram.
  - Tracks successful, skipped, and failed applications.
  - Provides daily reports on application stats.
- **Flexible Configuration**:
  - `MONKEY_MODE`: Apply to everything.
  - `SEARCH_MODE`: Generate drafts without applying.
  - `SKILL_STAT_MODE`: Analyze demand for skills without applying.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Core Libraries**:

    - `style_manager.py`: Manages CSS styles.
    - `template_base.py`: HTML templates for resume sections.
    - `utils.py`: Resume builder utilities.
  - `utils/`: General utility functions.
    - `browser_utils.py`: Playwright browser management and interaction utilities.
    - `json_to_readable.py`: Helper to convert JSON to readable formats.
    - `utils.py`: General utility functions (file operations, text sanitization).
  - `constants.py`: Project constants (paths, dummy data, LLM prices).
