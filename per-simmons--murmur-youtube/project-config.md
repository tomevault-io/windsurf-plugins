# Working on this repo

Read this before changing anything. It is written for a coding agent picking the project up
cold, and it is mostly a list of things that look wrong but aren't, plus things that look
fine and will bite you.

---

## What this is

Push-to-talk dictation. Hold a key, talk, release, and cleaned-up text is typed into
whatever had focus. Two independent implementations:

| | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Swift 6 | C# / .NET 10 |
| UI | SwiftUI | Avalonia *(not written yet)* |
| Speech | Apple `SpeechAnalyzer`, or Parakeet via FluidAudio | Parakeet via sherpa-onnx |
| Location | repo root | `windows/` |

**The macOS app works and is in daily use. The Windows app is a dictionary engine plus a
detailed specification — no audio, hotkey, injection or UI yet.** Do not describe it as
working.

---

## The one rule that matters

**`shared/dictionary-test-vectors.json` is the specification for correction behaviour.**

Both implementations run it in CI. If you change how corrections work, change the vectors
first, watch both sides go red, then make them green. Changing one implementation to "fix"
a failing vector without changing the other is how the two silently diverge — and only one
of them can be exercised by hand.

```bash
swift test --filter VectorTests           # macOS side
cd windows && dotnet test Murmur.sln      # Windows side
```

The Swift copy at `Tests/MurmurDictionaryTests/dictionary-test-vectors.json` is a copy, and
CI fails if it drifts from `shared/`. After editing the shared file:

```bash
cp shared/dictionary-test-vectors.json Tests/MurmurDictionaryTests/
```

---

## Things that look like bugs and are not

**`swift build` fails with "input file was modified during the build."** The repo lives in an
iCloud-synced folder and the sync engine touches files mid-compile. **Always build with
`make`**, which uses `--scratch-path` outside the synced tree. A bare `swift build` also
writes a `.build/` directory into iCloud, which makes every subsequent build minutes slower.
If you see this error, wait a few seconds and retry.

**Compare mode doesn't type anything.** By design — `Settings.compareMode` runs every engine
on one recording and shows them side by side. If both injected, two transcripts would fight
over one text field. This is the single most confusing behaviour in the app.

**The timing column isn't comparing like with like.** Apple and Parakeet are timed on local
compute with the clock started *after* model load. Wispr Flow's number is its own
`e2eLatency`, which includes a network round trip and its cleanup pass. Don't present them
as one ranking.

**`MainActor.assumeIsolated` will crash the process.** It does not check the claim, it
asserts it. Use `await MainActor.run` from any non-main-actor context. This took the app
down once already.

**Mutating `@State` inside a `Canvas` draw closure floods the log and corrupts state.** The
VU meter keeps its needle physics in a plain reference type the view merely holds, which is
invisible to SwiftUI's state graph. Don't "clean that up" into `@State`.

---

## Design system

`Sources/MurmurYouTube/UI/DesignSystem.swift` defines every colour, size, radius, duration
and material token. **Views must not contain literal values.** If a component needs a number
that isn't a token, add the token rather than inlining it.

The direction is 1980s field recorders — Sony TC-D5, Marantz PMD, Nakamichi, Braun. Silver
face in light appearance, black face in dark. Two rules that are not negotiable:

- **Red means recording.** Nothing else in the app is red.
- **Amber and green are instrumentation only** — level meters, never UI chrome.

Explicitly ruled out: neon, vaporwave, synthwave, purple/pink gradients, glowing text, chrome
lettering, grid horizons. There are **no gradients anywhere**; depth comes from flat panels,
hairline bevels and procedurally-drawn brushed grain.

---

## macOS specifics

**Code signing is load-bearing, not cosmetic.** TCC stores a code-signing *requirement* per
entry, not just a path. An ad-hoc signature changes every build, so the rebuilt binary stops
satisfying the stored requirement — and the symptom lies: the Accessibility toggle still
shows as **on** while the app is untrusted. The `Makefile` auto-detects a Developer ID via
`security find-identity`. Don't replace that with `--sign -`.

If a grant does get wedged, reset that one row — never toggle, and never omit the bundle ID:

```bash
tccutil reset Accessibility ai.pivotstudio.murmur-youtube
```

A bare `tccutil reset Accessibility` wipes every app on the machine. Then quit System
Settings entirely (⌘Q) before reopening; the Privacy pane caches its list.

**`log` may be shadowed in the user's shell.** Use `/usr/bin/log` explicitly.

**Don't run the `.app` from the repo folder.** It's iCloud-synced and the sync engine can
corrupt the signature. `make install` puts the running copy in `/Applications`.

---

## Windows specifics

Everything here was researched and verified but **never run on Windows.** Treat the specifics
as load-bearing; they were expensive to establish. Full detail in `windows/README.md` and
`docs/PARAKEET-WINDOWS.md`.

**Three pinned versions that break silently at "latest":**
