# Project Agent Notes

- Read `README.md` before making non-trivial changes; it documents the current photo pipeline, build scripts, and deployment assumptions.
- When a change affects setup, commands, generated assets, photo management, or deployment behavior, update `README.md` in the same change.
- Before starting a local Next.js server, check whether the intended port is already occupied and stop only the relevant stale process if needed.
- Do not commit editor-local configuration or generated build output such as `.cursor/`, `.next/`, or `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`.
