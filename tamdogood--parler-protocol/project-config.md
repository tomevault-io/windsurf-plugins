# AGENTS.md

Onboarding map for any agent (or human) working on **Parler Protocol** — the chat protocol for AI agents.
This file is a **directory, not a manual**: it tells you what the project is, how the pieces fit, and
which doc to open next. Keep it short; push detail into `docs/`.

> **Claude Code users:** see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the few Claude-specific rules. Everything
> else lives here.

## What Parler Protocol is

One small Rust binary that lets independent AI agents **find each other, prove who they are, hand off
a live conversation (no copy-paste), and share memory** over a tiny WebSocket hub. Ships as both a
**CLI** and an **MCP server**. The flagship flow is *session handoff*: publish a conversation, share
a short key, and the next agent joins the same chat already caught up.

Setup is **one command**: `parler connect` auto-detects every AI agent on the machine (Claude Code,
Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini, Claude Desktop) and wires them all — the single source of truth the
desktop app's one-click *Connect* also drives. The only hub choice is a ladder with a default: shared
(nothing to run) → `--local` (nothing leaves the box) → `--team` (generates a join secret).

Full pitch and user-facing usage: **[`README.md`](README.md)**.

## Architecture at a glance

```
AI clients ──CLI / MCP──▶ parler-connector ──WebSocket──▶ parler-hub ──▶ SQLite (cards · rooms · FTS memory)
(Claude, Codex, …)        (MeshAgent core)                (relay bus)
                                                          ▲
                                              Next.js web ┘ (read-only REST)
```

The hub is a **relay, not a root of trust** — an agent's id *is* its Ed25519 public key, so even a
compromised hub can't forge a listing or impersonate anyone.

### Crate layout (`crates/*`, Cargo workspace)

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| `parler-protocol` | Wire frames + types; transport-agnostic standard. `canonical_card_bytes` for signing. |
| `parler-auth` | nkey/Ed25519 identity, `sign`/`verify`, NATS JWT issuance (NATS path is deferred). |
| `parler-hub` | WebSocket bus + embedded SQLite store (directory, rooms, FTS5 memory) + REST API. |
| `parler-connector` | The `MeshAgent` client core + `MeshTransport` seam + WS `HubClient`. Shared by CLI & MCP. |
| `parler-cli` | `parler` subcommands (incl. `parler connect`, the one-command agent wiring) **and** the `parler mcp` stdio server — thin adapters over `MeshAgent`. |
| `parler-bin` | The umbrella `parler` binary. |
| `web/` | Next.js / Tailwind v4 directory site (reads the hub's REST API). |

## Build, test, run

Toolchain is pinned (`rust-toolchain.toml`, stable + clippy). The `Makefile` mirrors CI exactly —
`make ci` locally == the cloud pipeline.

```bash
make ci          # full pipeline (build · clippy -D warnings · test --locked · web build · audit)
make selftest    # fast: test the test scripts themselves
make smoke       # boot the real hub binary and probe its HTTP surface
cargo test --workspace          # Rust suite only
CI_SKIP_WEB=1 make ci           # skip the website build while iterating on Rust

cargo build -p parler-bin       # → ./target/debug/parler
