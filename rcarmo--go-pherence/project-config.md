## Tooling

### Required

- **Go 1.24+** — the module uses recent Go features.
- **`go vet`** — run before every commit. Do not commit code that fails vet.
- **`go test ./...`** — run affected packages before committing. When touching `backends/`, run `go test ./backends/...`.
- **`gofmt -w`** — format all modified `.go` files before committing.

### Recommended

- **`gopls`** — install with `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest`. Use it for:
  - Finding all references to a symbol before renaming or moving it.
  - Checking which packages import a function before changing its signature.
  - Navigating build-tagged files (`_riscv64.go`, `_other.go`).
  - Mechanical refactors like extracting interfaces or inlining helpers.
- **`go build ./...`** — verify the entire tree compiles after cross-cutting changes.

### Remote K3 development

When working on the Milk-V/K3 board via SSH:
- Set `HOME=/home/me TMPDIR=/tmp GOCACHE=/home/me/.cache/go-build GOMODCACHE=/home/me/go/pkg/mod` explicitly — SSH-backed tool environments may not inherit the correct home directory.
- Use `nohup` for long-running generation commands; the board has 31 GB RAM and no swap, so aggressive memory use can trigger the OOM killer or reboot.
- After installing packages, use `--user --break-system-packages` for pip since `python3-venv` may not be available and `sudo` may require a TTY.

## Ground rules

### Before editing

1. **Read the file first.** Never edit blind. Understand what is there before changing it.
2. **Check build tags.** Many files have `_riscv64.go` / `_other.go` pairs. If you edit one, check the other.
3. **Search for callers.** Before changing a function signature, grep or use `gopls references` to find all call sites.
4. **Check for tests.** If a `_test.go` exists for the file you are editing, run it after changes.

### Making changes

5. **Prefer editing over rewriting.** Do not rewrite whole files unless you understand every function in them. I have lost working code to blind rewrites.
6. **Do not remove functions you didn't add** unless you have verified zero callers with `gopls` or `grep -R`.
7. **Preserve build-tag stubs.** Every `_riscv64.go` function must have a matching stub in `_other.go` (or vice versa). If you add a new function to one, add it to both.
8. **Keep imports correct.** When adding imports to build-tagged files, verify the import is available on all target platforms. Use `gofmt -w` to sort imports.
9. **Test tolerance.** If you change a numerical approximation (e.g. FastExp, polynomial SiLU), check whether existing tests have tight tolerances that will break. Widen tolerances explicitly with a comment, or gate the approximation behind a build tag.

### Committing

10. **Run `gofmt -w` on all modified files.**
11. **Run `go test` on affected packages.** At minimum: the package you edited plus any package that imports it.
12. **Run `go vet` on affected packages.**
