# Publishing a release

Every app release is published to the public product / auto-update feed:
https://github.com/salesforce/zana/releases

## Tag push is the publisher

Cut a release by tagging `vx.y.z` and pushing it. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds **Apple Silicon (arm64)** on `macos-15` and **Intel (x64)** on `macos-15-intel`, merges `latest-mac.yml`, and creates a **draft** GitHub Release on **salesforce/zana**.

Local `pnpm run release:mac` only packages the **host** architecture (`electron-builder --publish never`). It must not upload — a laptop arm64 publish would replace the dual-arch feed.

Signing/notarization uses `CSC_LINK`, `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.

## Always start as a draft

A new version must land as a **draft**. Drafts are invisible to electron-updater, so a tag does not ship to users until a human publishes it.

```text
✅  action-gh-release  draft: true
❌  published / latest on tag push
```

The release is not done until the draft on `salesforce/zana` is published (GitHub UI **Publish release**, or `gh release edit TAG --draft=false`).

## Release name is `x.y.z` only

The GitHub **release name** (title) is the semver triple from `package.json`, nothing else.

```text
✅ 2.0.3
❌ Zana Command Center 2.0.3
❌ Zana Command Center v2.0.3
❌ v2.0.3
❌ 2.0.3-arm64
```

The git **tag** stays `vx.y.z` (example: `v2.0.3`). Do not put product copy, architecture, or a leading `v` in the release name.

When using `gh release create` / `gh release edit`, pass `--title "x.y.z"` (or equivalent). If a draft or published release already has a prose title, rename it to `x.y.z` before calling the release done.
