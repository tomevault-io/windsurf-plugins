# Live thread / CLI Agent checks

When you change Modern **threads**, **CLI Agents**, harness providers, spawn argv/routing, `acpMode`, `reasoningLevel`, `executionState`, `modelLevel`, native roles, or plugin session instructions, finish by running:

```bash
unset ZCC_SESSION_ID
pnpm live:mode-reasoning
pnpm live:memory
```

`live:mode-reasoning` is the production-boundary check that spawn still works per harness mode and reasoning. `live:memory` is the production-boundary check that a live Claude Code thread still receives Memory catalog injection. Unit tests are not enough.

## What they cover

- **`pnpm live:mode-reasoning`** — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode — each distinct mode and reasoning once, on **both** `POST /api/v1/threads` and `POST /api/v1/cli-agents`. Crash-only: alive then `stop()`. Not PONG, not file writes, not `pnpm live:matrix`.
- **`pnpm live:memory`** — Memory plugin product-HTTP CLI, then a tagged hidden Claude Code thread that must quote a seeded catalog summary from `contributeInstructions`. Skip if the plugin is not `running`.

## How to run them

- Host shell only. `ZCC_SESSION_ID` → `FORBIDDEN_AGENT`.
- Attached app: product HTTP `:8780` (packaged / `dev:prod`) or `:8781` (`pnpm dev`), Electron with matching `ZCC_PRODUCT_SERVER_CREDENTIAL`, enrolled host-daemon.
- If harness verify is empty, tests skip and look green in milliseconds. That is a false pass — check the `[live] skip …` warnings.

Unattended HTTP DENIED for `accept-edits` or some `interactive` mappings is expected. A real failure is spawn 5xx, thread `error`, CLI early `exited` / `NOT_FOUND`, or a hang.

See `docs/control-sdk.md`.
