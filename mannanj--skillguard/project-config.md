# CLAUDE.md — contributor guide for agents

SkillGuard is a **stdlib-only, multi-engine security scanner for Claude Code
skills and MCP servers**. It runs as a CLI and as a PreToolUse hook that gates
skill/MCP invocations. This file is the fast on-ramp; deeper rationale lives in
module docstrings and `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `SECURITY.md`. Read it before changing
code, and keep it in sync when the engine set or module layout changes.

## Build / test / lint

A `.venv/` is checked in locally; prefix commands with `.venv/bin/` to use it.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"                          # dev deps: pytest>=8, ruff, mypy
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q                    # 205 tests, all must pass
.venv/bin/ruff check skillguard tests            # lint
.venv/bin/ruff format --check skillguard tests   # format
.venv/bin/mypy skillguard                        # typecheck (34 source files)
git config core.hooksPath .githooks               # one-time: enable pre-push gate
```

Those four commands (pytest + ruff check + ruff format + mypy) are the **DX
gates**; all four must stay green on every change. Python ≥ 3.10. Core has
**zero runtime dependencies** (`pyproject.toml` `dependencies = []`); the `cisco`
engine is an optional extra and is import-guarded.

## Architecture

`skillguard/cli.py` is a **thin facade**: it re-exports public names from the
sub-modules and owns `run_scan()` + `__version__`. `from skillguard.cli import …`
keeps working, but new code belongs in the focused module, not in `cli.py`.

Top-level package modules:

- `model.py` — shared types (`Finding`, `SkillInfo`), the `Engine` Protocol, and
  the **only** home for severity ordering (see Inviolable rules).
- `patterns.py` — `LOCAL_PATTERNS`, the regex detection rules + the `_p` builder.
- `branding.py` — naming authority (`APP_NAME`, `CACHE_DIR_NAME`, `DB_NAME`,
  `ENV_PREFIX`), all derived from `APP_NAME`.
- `config.py` / `paths.py` — settings precedence, cache-dir resolution.
- `discovery.py` / `scan.py` — find skills, run the engine pipeline, dedupe.
- `store.py` — SQLite history + activity store. **Stores only what it's given;
  callers must hand it redacted data.**
- `cache.py` / `triage.py` / `commands.py` / `args.py` / `_util.py` — verdict
  writers, false-positive triage, read subcommands, argparse, atomic-write util.
- `hook.py` — the standalone PreToolUse gate (see Hook posture).

Sub-packages:

- `engines/` — `LocalEngine`, `CiscoEngine`, `SkillAuditEngine`, `SnykEngine`,
  plus the registry (see below).
- `mcp/` — the MCP scanner, a package with a re-export facade in `__init__.py`
  (`__all__`). Modules: `model`, `discovery`, `secrets`, `launch`, `rules`,
  `materialize`, `engine`, `introspect`. **`secrets.py` is the single
  redaction/secret-detection authority** — new redaction/detection rules go
  there. **`introspect.py` is the ONLY module that executes untrusted code.**
- `render/` — `colors.py`, `reports.py`, `summary.py` (table/json/markdown/quiet
  output).

### Adding an engine

Engines satisfy the `@runtime_checkable` `Engine` Protocol in `model.py`
(`name`, `inter_target_delay`, `available`, `scan(target)`). To add one:
implement the class in `engines/`, then register it in **one place** —
`ENGINE_REGISTRY` in `skillguard/engines/__init__.py`. `_build_engines` and
`resolve_engine_names` are data-driven over that dict; `inter_target_delay` lets
a rate-limited remote engine throttle between targets (0.0 for local engines).

`McpConfigEngine` is **deliberately NOT in the registry** — it's the structural
MCP analyzer that `cli.py` appends only when MCP targets exist, never a
user-selectable engine.

## Inviolable rules

- **Secret redaction.** Raw env / headers / args / url values are scanned **in
  memory only**; only redacted, model-shape data is ever persisted (cache,
  history DB, materialized surfaces, finding messages). `mcp/secrets.py` is the
  authority; `store.py` stores "no secrets, ever" (its docstring). The MCP engine
  even re-scans raw literals in memory for blind-spots
  (`mcp/engine.py::_redaction_blindspot_findings`, via `secrets.redacted_literals`)
  without echoing them. Pinned by
  `tests/test_cli_mcp.py::test_secret_never_persisted_anywhere`.
- **Zero runtime dependencies.** Core imports stdlib only. Optional engines are
  import-guarded and gated on `.available`.
- **Severity ordering lives only in `model.py`** (`SEVERITY_ORDER`,
  `max_severity_of`, `worst_severity`, `normalize_severity`). Never re-derive
  "which severity is worse" or "unknown → medium" inline.
- **Hook posture (`hook.py:4-30` docstring).** Skills **fail CLOSED** (no scan,
  corrupted cache, or modified-since-scan → block; skipped → allow with a
  reminder). MCP policy is `off | warn | enforce`. The hook must never crash a
  tool call.
- **`hook.py` is standalone** and import-guards the package, so it
  **deliberately mirrors** branding/policy constants as inline literals
  (`CACHE_DIR`, `DB_NAME`, `MCP_POLICY_ENV`, `SETTINGS_NAME`, `_safe_name`, …).
  Do NOT "DRY" these into a `branding` import — the mirror is pinned by
  `tests/test_branding.py::test_hook_mirrors_branding` and
  `tests/test_hook.py::test_safe_name_mirrors_package`. When the package can't be
