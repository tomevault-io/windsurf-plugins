# Brume — agent onboarding

This file is the entry point for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex,
Cursor, OpenCode, etc.) working on Brume. Human contributors should
start at [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), which carries the
canonical house style, PR flow, and project scope. This document
adds the things an agent specifically needs at every interaction:
load-bearing invariants, a crate map, and an index of procedural
skills.

## What Brume is

A four-part multi-timbral synthesizer for the Raspberry Pi Compute
Module 5. Four engines (FM, Harmonic, Timbral, Granular), six voices
per part, one filter, one effects chain, a Lua scripting layer, a
10.1-inch touchscreen UI in iced + wgpu, and a USB bridge that
presents Brume to a host computer as a class-compliant audio + MIDI
device. Hobby project, GPL-3.0-only, no commercial pressure.

## Load-bearing invariants

These are absolute. Every change must respect them; CI enforces some
but not all.

- **`unsafe_code = "forbid"` workspace-wide.** No `unsafe` blocks.
  CI fails the build if you add one.
- **No allocations on the audio thread.** `process_block` and its
  callees must not call the allocator. Pre-allocate, reuse buffers,
  use `parking_lot::Mutex` (no poisoning) over `std::sync::Mutex`.
- **No syscalls on the audio thread.** That includes `eprintln!` /
  `println!`, file I/O, anything that can block on journald or a
  slow tty. If you need to surface state, use the engine→UI channel.
- **Atomic commits.** One logical change per commit. Don't batch
  unrelated work — five focused commits beat one sprawl. CHANGELOG
  bullet on every user-observable change. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  §"House style" for the full set.
- **Schema-version every persisted format.** `Patch`, `Perf`, and
  `ControlMatrix` all carry a `version: u32` and reject futures
  newer than this build supports. See the
  [`brume-schema-version-bump`](.agents/skills/brume-schema-version-bump/SKILL.md)
  skill before touching any of them.

## Procedural skills

Detailed playbooks live in [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/). Claude
Code loads these on intent (the `description` field in each
`SKILL.md` carries trigger phrases). Other agents can load them
directly when the user names a relevant scenario.

- **[`brume-getting-started`](.agents/skills/brume-getting-started/SKILL.md)** —
  orient a fresh agent: this file in expanded form, plus pointers to
  the right reading order for any contribution scope.
- **[`brume-audio-thread-review`](.agents/skills/brume-audio-thread-review/SKILL.md)** —
  the checklist for any change touching `process_block` or its
  callees. Allocation, syscall, panic, denormal, and lock-discipline
  audit.
- **[`brume-add-parameter`](.agents/skills/brume-add-parameter/SKILL.md)** —
  end-to-end procedure for adding a new `ParameterId`: enum, dispatch,
  default, UI slider, persistence, smoothing.
- **[`brume-schema-version-bump`](.agents/skills/brume-schema-version-bump/SKILL.md)** —
  when to bump `SCHEMA_VERSION`, how to add a migration arm, the
  test pattern that pins the gate.
- **[`brume-lua-script`](.agents/skills/brume-lua-script/SKILL.md)** —
  scripting subsystem: sandbox bounds, brume API, FX vs control
  scripts, `LuaBuffer` userdata for audio paths.
- **[`brume-cm5-deploy`](.agents/skills/brume-cm5-deploy/SKILL.md)** —
  rsync, build-on-device, install to `/usr/bin/brume`,
  `systemctl restart` workflow. The atomic binary swap pattern.
- **[`atomic-commits`](.agents/skills/atomic-commits/SKILL.md)** —
  the commit-hygiene rule: when to split, when to bundle, what
  belongs in the message body.

The [`.agents/skills/README.md`](.agents/skills/README.md) documents
the skill format if you need to author a new one.
