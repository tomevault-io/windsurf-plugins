# Testing & CI

* All CLI logic is covered by **Vitest** unit tests:
  * `tests/cli/file-helpers.test.js` - Tests for file operations
  * `tests/cli/config.test.js` - Tests for configuration handling
  * `tests/cli/stack-helpers.test.js` - Tests for common stack functionality
  * `tests/cli/nextjs-helpers.test.js` - Tests for Next.js specific functionality
* Template‑generation is validated by snapshot tests (`tests/templates/`).
* CI (GitHub Actions) runs `npm run test` and checks formatting.
* Before publishing a new version, run `npm run test -- --update` to refresh snapshots if necessary.
* Pre-commit and pre-push hooks run tests automatically using Husky.
