# goldenmatch-kg — Claude notes

Drop-in entity resolution for KG frameworks (neo4j-graphrag / LlamaIndex PGI /
Graphiti). This lived in the root `CLAUDE.md`; it is package-specific, so it now
loads only when you are working here.

`packages/python/goldenmatch-kg/` is a standalone package (PyPI `goldenmatch-kg`) that drops goldenmatch in as the entity-resolution stage of neo4j-graphrag / LlamaIndex PGI / Graphiti. A framework-agnostic `resolve_entities` core (zero-config `dedupe_df` → groups + canonical maps) + three import-gated shims (base-free `_resolve.py` decision helper per shim, locally testable). Design: `context-network/decisions/0021-goldenmatch-kg-integrations.md`. Gotchas:
- **EXCLUDED from the uv workspace on purpose** (`[tool.uv.workspace].exclude` in root `pyproject.toml`). Its three framework extras (neo4j-graphrag, llama-index-core, graphiti-core) are heavy, fast-moving dep trees that would enter the main `uv.lock` and risk breaking `uv sync --all-packages` repo-wide (the `goldenmatch[native]` footgun). It is installed standalone by its own `goldenmatch-kg.yml` lane — NOT a workspace member, NOT in the main `ci.yml` matrix, and NOT a `golden-suite` meta-package floor member (its heavy framework extras stay out of the suite dependency graph). It IS published to PyPI on its own: `publish-goldenmatch-kg.yml` (thin caller → `_publish-pypi.yml`, fires on a `goldenmatch-kg-v*` release tag or `workflow_dispatch`; added 2026-08-04, first release 0.1.0).
- **CI lane = core (always) + a fresh-venv-per-framework MATRIX.** The three frameworks have conflicting deps, so each gets an isolated venv; installing the extra un-skips that shim's real-library integration test. `fail-fast: false`. The lane is informational (not `ci-required`), so confirm it green before arming auto-merge — it is the only real-execution signal for the bindings.
- **Shim tests inject a deterministic stub for the goldenmatch decision** (`tests/conftest.py`), NOT real `dedupe_df`. Zero-config dedupe on a ~3-row toy frame commits a degenerate RED config whose fuzzy merge varies BY GOLDENMATCH VERSION (the stale local `.venv` had 1.30.0 which merged "Apple"/"Apple Inc"; CI's 2.2.0 did not) and across processes — so a toy-merge assertion is flaky. The shim tests verify the binding/marshaling; goldenmatch's accuracy is covered by core parity + ER-KG-Bench. (Side lesson: the local `.venv` goldenmatch can be badly stale vs main — a passes-locally-fails-in-CI trap; `uv sync` to refresh.)
