# Project Overview

This project is a hockey scoreboard application for the Bremerton Ice Arena. It is written in Java 21 and built with Gradle.

The application consists of a server that manages the game state and communicates with both hardware and browser clients.

- **Jetty + RESTEasy:** Expose a REST API on port `8080` for querying and updating the game clock, scores, penalties, and buzzer.
- **Native WebSocket server:** Pushes real-time score and clock updates to connected web clients on port `8082`.
- **jSerialComm:** Connects to the physical scoreboard over a serial port so on-ice displays mirror the server state.
- **Dagger:** Wires these components together and produces singletons for the scoreboard state and services.
