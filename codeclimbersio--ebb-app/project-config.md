# Claude AI Development Guide - CodeClimbers App

This is a Tauri application with React TypeScript frontend and Rust backend.

## Development Guides

For detailed development patterns and practices, please refer to:

- **Frontend Development**: `src/CLAUDE.md` - React TypeScript patterns, data architecture, and component guidelines
