# Purpose

jeq is a command-line client that turns TypeSafe System One judgments into safe, composable Unix data. It preserves request and response evidence as JSON and keeps policy decisions explicit and deterministic.

# Naming

Write the product name as lowercase `jeq`, including in headings and at sentence starts. Keep the uppercase `JEQ_` prefix only for established environment variables such as `JEQ_CONFIG`, `JEQ_TRACE_ID`, and `JEQ_BIN`.

# Writing

Write user-facing prose in direct, practical language. Start with what the command does, name the real constraint, and tell the reader what to run next. Avoid abstract words such as “surface” and “boundary” when a concrete action is clearer. Do not use em dashes. Keep headings short and natural.

# Architecture

`cmd/jeq` is the production composition root. It wires the shell-facing [CLI](internal/cli/AGENTS.md) to infrastructure adapters for [source input and rendering](internal/infra/AGENTS.md) and the TypeSafe HTTP API. The CLI depends inward on the domain contracts, composition rules, and [pipeline](internal/domain/AGENTS.md); the domain does not depend on Cobra, HTTP, files, or renderers.

# Modules

- [Command](cmd/jeq/AGENTS.md): process entry point and dependency wiring.
- [Examples](AGENTS.md): executable workflow examples and user-facing recipes.
- [Internal](internal/AGENTS.md): application implementation and test-support boundaries.

# Landmarks

- `cmd/jeq/main.go:main`: builds production dependencies and starts the CLI.
- `internal/cli/run.go:RunWithDeps`: executes a fresh command tree and maps failures to process exits.
- `internal/domain/jeq/compose.go:Compose`: resolves native or composed request documents.
- `internal/domain/pipeline/pipeline.go:Enrich`: appends one judgment response to a JSON record.
- `internal/domain/pipeline/gate.go:Gate`: applies offline numeric policy to evidence.
- `internal/infra/typesafeapi/client.go:Client.Evaluate`: crosses the wire to TypeSafe System One.

# Boundary flows

- Information flow: `cmd/jeq/main.go:main` -> `internal/cli/run.go:RunWithDeps` via `cmd/jeq/main.go:main`; value: `cli.AskDeps`.
- Information flow: `internal/cli/ask.go:NewAskCmd` -> `internal/domain/jeq/compose.go:Compose` via `internal/cli/ask.go:NewAskCmd`; value: `jeq.ComposeInput`.
- Information flow: `internal/domain/pipeline/pipeline.go:Enrich` -> `internal/infra/typesafeapi/client.go:Client.Evaluate` via `internal/cli/map.go:NewMapCmd`; value: `contract.Request`.
- Information flow: `internal/infra/typesafeapi/client.go:Client.Evaluate` -> `internal/infra/render/json.go:JSON` via `internal/cli/ask.go:NewAskCmd`; value: `contract.Response`.
- Information flow: `internal/domain/pipeline/gate.go:Gate` -> `internal/infra/render/json.go:JSON` via `internal/cli/gate.go:NewGateCmd`; value: `[]byte`.

# Placement

Put new command behavior in the CLI, request/response semantics in the domain, and operating-system or network concerns in infrastructure. Add a new top-level module only when a cohesive capability has its own ownership boundary and dependency direction; keep small implementation groupings under their owning guide.
