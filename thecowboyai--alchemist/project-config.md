description: Rules for Rust on Nix and NixOS
---

When planning to write code, ALWAYS respect the documentation in /doc
If instructions in /doc are unclear for the proposed functionality, ASK FOR CLARITY and add to the documentation before writing code.

YOU HAVE MANY EXAMPLES TO FOLLOW IN /samples
FOR BEVY AND EGUI CODE REFER TO THESE SAMPLES FOR SYNTAX CLARITY

NEVER, EVER DOWNGRADE A RUST LIBRARY.
IF THE CARGO.TOML FILE SPECIFIES A VERSION, YOU MAY ONLY GO UP, NEVER DOWN.

DO NOT MAKE TEMPORARY DOWNGRADES, FIX THE PROBLEM AT HAND.

USE `nix build` OR `nix develop -c cargo build` TO LOAD THE RIGHT NIX ENVIRONMENT

For building Bevy applications on NixOS, always use the Nix build toolchain rather than cargo directly, as Nix handles all the proper library paths and dynamic linking that Bevy requires.

ALWAYS be sure we CAN build before building as builds take some time.
use `nix develop -c cargo build` and `nix develop -c cargo test` to ensure no errors exist before building.

YOU MAY NOT CREATE ORPHANED PLACEHOLDERS
IF YOU CREATE A VARIABLE, YOU MUST USE IT.
IF YOU CREATE A FUNCTION YOU MUST IMPLEMENT IT, NOT LEAVE AN EMPTY STUB.

# Rust Standard Libraries & Tooling Setup for NixOS (Bevy/Wayland, Nightly Rust 2024)

## Context

This rule ensures consistent and reproducible Rust toolchain and standard library setup in a NixOS environment, specifically for Bevy/Wayland applications using Nightly Rust 2024 edition.

## Best Practices

### 1. Toolchain Management

- **Use oxalica/rust-overlay with flake-parts:**
  - Configure your flake to pull in `rust-overlay` and set up Nightly Rust with `rust-src` and `rust-analyzer` extensions.
  - Example:
    ```
    rust-nightly = (pkgs.rust-bin.selectLatestNightlyWith (toolchain:
      toolchain.default.override {
        extensions = ["rust-src" "rust-analyzer"];
        targets = ["x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"];
      }
    ));
    ```
- **Set `RUST_SRC_PATH`:**
  - Export `RUST_SRC_PATH` in your shellHook to point to the Nightly Rust standard library.
    ```
    shellHook = ''
      export RUST_SRC_PATH="${rust-nightly}/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library"
    '';
    ```

### 2. Environment Setup

- **Include required build inputs:**
  - Add the following to `buildInputs`:
    ```
    buildInputs = with pkgs; [
      vulkan-loader
      libxkbcommon
      wayland
      udev
      alsaLib
      pkg-config
      xorg.libX11
    ];
    ```
- **Set Wayland environment variables:**
  - Add to your shellHook:
    ```
    export WINIT_UNIX_BACKEND=wayland
    export RUST_BACKTRACE=full
    ```

### 3. Project Structure

- **Follow Rust conventions:**
  - Use `src/` for source code, `main.rs`/`lib.rs` as entry points, `bin/` for multiple binaries, `tests/` for integration tests, and `examples/` for example code[2].
- **Use a workspace if multi-crate:**
  - Structure your project as a workspace for modularity.

### 4. Cursor Rule Best Practices

- **Keep rules concise and focused:**
  - Avoid vague language; provide concrete examples and actionable guidance[1][5].
- **Specify essential code elements:**
  - Include critical environment variables, Nix expressions, and Rust toolchain configuration[5].
- **Use auto-attach for relevant files:**
  - Attach this rule to `Cargo.toml`, `flake.nix`, and `shell.nix` files for context-aware assistance[1][5].

### 5. Example Shell Hook

```
shellHook = ''
  export RUST_SRC_PATH="${rust-nightly}/lib/rustlib/src/1.75.0/library"
  export WINIT_UNIX_BACKEND=wayland
  export RUST_BACKTRACE=full
'';
```

### 6. Additional Tips

- **Pin Nightly Rust version:**
  - Consider using a pinned Nightly Rust date for reproducibility.
- **Update documentation:**
  - Keep your README.md updated with setup instructions and environment requirements.

This rule is designed to be concise, actionable, and scoped, providing clear guidance for both AI assistants and human developers working on Bevy/Wayland projects in NixOS with Nightly Rust[1][5][2].

# Bevy Dynamic Linking & Nix Build Configuration

## Development Setup

**Cargo.toml features:**
```
[features]
dev = [
  "bevy/dynamic_linking",
  "bevy/asset_processor",
  "bevy/file_watcher"
]
```

**Nix dev shell configuration:**
```
# flake.nix
devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
  packages = [rust-nightly];
  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    vulkan-loader
    libxkbcommon
    wayland
    udev
  ];

  shellHook = ''
    export RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"
    export CARGO_FEATURES_DEV="--features dev"
  '';
};
```

## Production Build Configuration

**Nix package derivation:**
```
packages.default = pkgs.rustPlatform.buildRustPackage {
  cargoLock.lockFile = ./Cargo.lock;

  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    vulkan-loader
    wayland
  ];

  cargoBuildFlags = "--release --no-default-features";

  # Required for Wayland surface creation
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "${pkgs.lib.makeLibraryPath [
    pkgs.vulkan-loader
    pkgs.wayland
  ]}";
};
```

## Build Commands

| Environment | Command                      | Flags                            |
|-------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Development | `nix develop`                | (shellHook auto-applies)         |
