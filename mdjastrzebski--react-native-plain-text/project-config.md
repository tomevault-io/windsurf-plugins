# AGENTS.md

A React Native library exposing `PlainText`: a lightweight static-text component
backed directly by the platform's native text widget (`UILabel` on iOS,
`TextView` on Android) instead of RN's own `<Text>`. It is a **Fabric (New
Architecture) native component**.

**Yarn v4 workspaces — never use `npm`.** The library is the repo root; `example/`
is an Expo dev-client app for running and testing changes.

## Commands

Run from the repo root:

|                                             |                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `yarn validate`                             | All checks: lint, format, typecheck, test, build |
| `yarn typecheck`                            | TypeScript                                       |
| `yarn lint`                                 | ESLint + Prettier (`--fix` to autofix)           |
| `yarn format`                               | Prettier on non-JS files too (md, json, yml)     |
| `yarn test`                                 | Jest (`yarn test path -t "name"` for one case)   |
| `yarn example ios` / `yarn example android` | Build & run the example app                      |
| `yarn example start`                        | Metro only — does **not** rebuild native         |
| `yarn prepare`                              | Build the shippable library into `lib/`          |

**After every change run `yarn validate`.**

**Do not build the native binaries yourself** (`yarn example ios|android`) unless
explicitly asked to.

## Documentation

Agent docs live in `docs/agent/` — put new ones there and link them here. The
human-facing docs are `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`, under `docs/` once that
exists.
