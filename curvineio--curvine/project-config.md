## Available Skills

<!-- SKILLS_TABLE_START -->
<usage>
When users ask you to perform tasks, check if any of the available skills below can help complete the task more effectively. Skills provide specialized capabilities and domain knowledge.

How to use skills:
- Read the skill file at `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Base directory provided in output for resolving bundled resources (references/, scripts/, assets/)

Usage notes:
- For Curvine project workflow tasks, prefer the cv-* skills listed in <available_skills> below
- User-installed global skills (e.g. ~/.cursor/skills/, ~/.claude/skills/) remain available when the agent tool exposes them
- Do not invent or invoke project skills that are not listed in <available_skills>
- Do not invoke a skill that is already loaded in your context
- Each skill invocation is stateless
- Canonical project skill location: `.agents/skills/` (symlinked from `.cursor/skills`, `.claude/skills`, `.github/skills`)
- Only `cv-*` skills are versioned in this repository
</usage>
