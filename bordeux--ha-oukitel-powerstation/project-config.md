# CLAUDE.md — Oukitel P2001E Plus → Home Assistant

## Goal
Build a **Home Assistant** integration for the **Oukitel P2001E Plus** (2048Wh / 2400W) portable
power station, controlled by the **WonderFree** app. The station has WiFi + Bluetooth.

## Status (current)
**Protocol fully reverse-engineered AND the HA integration is built & live-validated.**
- Reverse engineering: complete, verified end-to-end on the real device (read + write).
- Integration: `custom_components/oukitel_power_station/` (config flow + reauth, push coordinator, sensor/switch/
  select/number, diagnostics, icons, strings/translations). Fully local at runtime after a one-time
  cloud `authKey` fetch.
- Validated **live on the real network**: UDP discovery (same-subnet), handshake, AES read, write
  (USB toggle), and authKey-rotation re-fetch all confirmed.
- **Domain is `oukitel_power_station`** (NOT bare `oukitel`) — chosen so a hypothetical future
  *official* Oukitel core integration can't collide (HA can't share a domain; core wins). The brands
  folder name is forced to equal the domain.
- Live-validated on HA **2026.2.3** (Python 3.14). Fixed a load-blocking bug: `DeviceInfo` must be
  imported from `homeassistant.helpers.device_registry` (there is no `homeassistant.helpers.device_info`).
- Quality/CI: `ruff` clean, `pytest` green. `ci.yml`: ruff + pytest, and now **installs Home Assistant
  to run an import smoke test** (`tests/test_imports.py` imports every module against real HA — catches
  broken HA imports that ruff/offline tests miss; self-skips without HA). `validate.yml`: hassfest +
  HACS. `release.yml`: **release-please** (conventional commits → version bump in `manifest.json` +
  CHANGELOG + tag + GitHub release that HACS consumes). `pr-lint.yml`: enforces Conventional-Commit PR
  titles. All workflows trigger on **`master`**. Repo **sanitized** (no device secrets tracked).
- Git: branch **`master`**, remote `origin` = `git@github.com:bordeux/ha-oukitel-powerstation.git`.
  **Committed & pushed.** Author identity is the user's git config — leave it alone.

**Remaining:** submit the brand icon to `home-assistant/brands`
(`custom_integrations/oukitel_power_station/{icon,icon@2x}.png`) — staged & ready in **`brands-pr/`**
(gitignored; PNGs extracted from the WonderFree app launcher icon + `PR_STEPS.md`). Until merged, HACS
shows "icon not available" (cosmetic; does NOT auto-fix from any other brand entry). Optional:
DHCP autodiscovery (`manifest.json` `dhcp` matcher by MAC OUI `E485FB*` + `async_step_dhcp`).
To ship a new version: open a PR with a conventional title, merge it, then merge the release-please PR.

## ⭐ Read this first
**`REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md` is the single source of truth** — full protocol, encryption, key
derivation, command codes, the complete tag/property map, secrets, tools, and lab setup.
Do not re-derive anything; read that file. Start at its **section 0 (STATUS)**.

## One-paragraph protocol summary
Firmware is **Quectel / Acceleronix** (NOT Tuya). App ↔ station is **local LAN**: UDP `6606`
discovery, TCP `6607` control. Frames: `AA AA | len | checksum | packetID | cmd | payload`, with
byte-stuffing (`AA`→`AA 55`) and an additive checksum. Payload is **TTLV** (tag/type/len/value).
After a `p2/p3/p4/p5` handshake the payload is **AES-128-CBC/PKCS5** encrypted with
`key = Base64.decode(authKey)` and `IV = the random nonce` the device sends in `p3`.
`authKey` is per-device, fetched once from the cloud. Read = `cmd 17`, write = `cmd 19`,
telemetry report = `cmd 20`.

## Tools (`tools/`)
- `quectel_cloud.py` — cloud login (`emailPwdLogin`) → token, `userDeviceList` (includes `authKey`),
  and product TSL. Run on any host with internet: `python3 tools/quectel_cloud.py`.
- `oukitel_local.py` — the working local client (discover → handshake → AES → live decrypted
  telemetry). **Must run on the Pi** (same LAN as the station): `python3 -u tools/oukitel_local.py`.
- `tsl_p11wN7.json` — authoritative thing-model (tag → name/unit/enum).

## Lab / environment
- Kali Pi 5: `ssh oukitel-kali` (→ `kali@10.60.20.89`, key auth, passwordless sudo). `eth0` = uplink,
  `wlan0` = 2.4GHz hotspot **`oukitel-lab` / `oukitel12345`** (NetworkManager `shared`; needs
  `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`, persisted). Station joins the hotspot → IP `10.42.0.149`.
- Captures: `/home/kali/oukitel/oukitel-*.pcap`; analyze with `tshark`.
- Decompiled APK: `apk/jadx/sources/` (obfuscated `com.quectel.*` — grep string constants, not method
  names). Original APK: `~/Downloads/Wonderfree_V3.6.0_APKPure.xapk`.
- The Mac **cannot** reach `10.42.0.149` directly (behind the Pi NAT) — run the local client on the Pi.

## Key secrets (this device — full table in REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md §0)
pk `p11wN7` · dk `aabbccddeeff` · **authKey `REDACTED_AUTHKEY`** · cloud EU
`iot-api.quecteleu.com`. Cloud account email/password are NOT stored here — pass them at runtime
(args or `QUECTEL_EMAIL` / `QUECTEL_PASSWORD` env vars).

## Integration design (as built)
The protocol logic lives in `custom_components/oukitel_power_station/{protocol,cloud,discovery}.py` (the earlier
`tools/*.py` were the dev/RE prototypes, now gitignored/local-only).
