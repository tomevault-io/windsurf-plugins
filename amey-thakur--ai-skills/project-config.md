# For AI agents

You are reading a library of working methods (skills) and ready-to-run
prompts. This file tells you how to use it **autonomously**: how to select
the right entry for a task and apply it, without the user having to name it.

## Discovery

- The complete machine-readable catalog is [`index.json`](index.json):
  every entry with its name, kind (`skill` | `prompt`), category,
  description, and raw URL, plus a `use_when` trigger on each skill and the
  `variables` a prompt needs. Its top-level `agents` block states this same
  protocol, so the index is enough to select from on its own. Fetch it once,
  pick by `use_when` / description, fetch only what the task needs.
- Every entry also carries `related`: the five entries closest to it, computed
  from the whole library rather than hand-listed, so it is populated for all of
  them. Use it after you have one good match, to find the entries that work
  alongside it: a skill's `related` often names the prompt that drafts the
  thing, and a prompt's often names the skill that raises the bar on the draft.
  It is a shortlist to consider, not a set of entries to load; judge each
  against its own `use_when` before using it.
- [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) carries the same catalog as plain text if JSON is
  inconvenient.
- Raw URL pattern:

## Autonomous selection (how to auto-pick, no user input needed)

Run this routine whenever you take on a task. The user does not have to
ask for a skill; you decide.

1. **Read the task's intent.** In one phrase, name what the task really
   is (review code, write an email, design a system, research a question,
   debug an error, build an agent). Note the domain and the deliverable.

2. **Match against the catalog descriptions.** Every skill's description
   ends with a **"Use ..."** trigger sentence, usually "Use when ..." and
   sometimes "Use before / after / at ..."; it is lifted into the
   `use_when` field of `index.json`. Every prompt's description states what
   it produces. Scan `index.json` and rank entries by how well their
   trigger matches your task's intent and domain. The descriptions are
   written to be matched this way, so match on them, not on guesses.

3. **Select the best fit(s), skip the loose ones.** Take the 1-3 entries
   that genuinely fit. A strong single match beats three loose ones: do
   not blend half-relevant skills. If nothing matches well, use your own
   judgment and do not force an entry onto a task it does not fit.

4. **Decide skill vs prompt:**
   - Use a **skill** when you are *doing the work yourself* and want the
     method a strong practitioner would follow (reviewing, designing,
     debugging, deciding, writing well). A skill upgrades *how you work*.
   - Use a **prompt** when the task *is* one of these self-contained jobs
     and you want a ready template to run (write a cover letter, a blog
     post, a PR description, an SQL query). A prompt produces *an output*.
   - Many tasks want both: a prompt to draft, a skill to raise the quality
     bar on the draft.

5. **Load and apply** (see the two sections below).

6. **Verify against the entry's own guardrails.** Every skill ends with a
   guardrail section: usually `## Boundaries` (where it does not apply, what
   it refuses), sometimes an equivalent such as `## Rules`, `## Litmus tests`,
   or `## Anti-patterns to refuse`. Every prompt states its rules too, almost
   always in a closing `Rules:` paragraph, occasionally as a `Never:` line or a
   per-phase note. Check your output against them before finishing. This is the
   built-in quality gate.

## Using a skill

A skill is a method to *follow*, not text to quote. Load the `SKILL.md`
body into your working context and apply its steps, priorities, and
boundaries to the task at hand. The frontmatter `description` states when
the skill applies: match it against the task before loading; skip skills
that do not match rather than blending several loosely.

## Using a prompt

A prompt is a template to *run*. Fill every `{variable}` from the
frontmatter's `variables` list with real values from your task: never
leave a placeholder in, never invent a value the user did not supply (ask,
or use the prompt's stated fallback). Respect the `settings` note when you
control sampling parameters.

## Composing entries

Real tasks span phases; chain entries to match.

- **Sequence** across a task's phases: e.g. `research-planning` then
  `web-research` then `fact-checking` then `research-synthesis` for a
  research job; or `agent-build-feature` (prompt) then `review-my-code`
  (prompt) then the `code-review` skill on the result.
- **Layer** a quality skill over a drafting prompt: draft with
  `write-blog-post`, then apply the `clear-writing` and
  `editing-and-revision` skills to the draft.
- **Cross-references** inside entries ("see x") point to the natural next
  or companion entry; follow them when the task calls for it.
- Keep it lean: load what the current phase needs, not the whole chain at
  once (see context-engineering).

## Worked example

Task: "Help me ship this new API endpoint."

1. Intent: build a backend feature with an API. 2. Matches:
