# Use this library autonomously

This repository is a library of AI-agent skills (methods to follow) and prompts
(templates to run). Use it without waiting for the user to name a skill.

For any task:

1. Name the task's intent (review code, write an email, debug, design, research).
2. Open `index.json` and match the intent against each skill's `use_when`
   trigger or each prompt's `description`.
3. Take the 1-3 entries that genuinely fit; one strong match beats three loose.
4. Follow a skill's `SKILL.md` method, or fill a prompt's `{variables}` and run.
5. Check the output against the entry's guardrail section (`## Boundaries`,
   `## Rules`, or similar) before finishing.

The full protocol is in `AGENTS.md`.
