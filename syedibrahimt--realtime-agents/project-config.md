# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- **Development server**: `npm run dev` - Starts Vite development server
- **Production build**: `npm run build` - Creates optimized build in `dist/`
- **Linting**: `npm run lint` - Runs ESLint with React and React Hooks rules
- **Preview build**: `npm run preview` - Serves production build locally

## Architecture Overview

This is a React-based AI tutoring application using OpenAI's Realtime API with a multi-agent architecture. The app provides interactive math/science tutoring through voice conversations with visual feedback.

### Core Structure

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite, using `@openai/agents-realtime` for real-time AI interactions
- **Agent System**: Multi-agent architecture in `src/agents/tutor/` with specialized roles:
  - `greeterAgent`: Welcome and session initialization 
  - `introGiverAgent`: Concept introduction with visual elements
  - `questionReaderAgent`: Question presentation and handling
  - `stepTutorAgent`: Step-by-step tutoring guidance  
  - `brainStormerAgent`: Interactive brainstorming sessions
  - `closerAgent`: Session conclusion and summary

### Key Components

- **App.jsx**: Main application with session management, push-to-talk controls, and visual feedback system
- **StarBackground**: Animated star field that responds to connection state
- **VisualFeedback**: Displays illustrations, hints, and success messages from agents
- **NotesArea**: Shows step-by-step progress tracking

### Data Flow

- Problem data loaded from JSON files (hard1.json - hard4.json) containing:
  - Topic information and learning objectives
  - Question data with multiple choice options
  - Step-by-step tutoring content with visual elements
  - Conceptual questions with illustrations and feedback

- Agents communicate through global window functions:
  - `window.handleStepCompletion()`: Updates progress tracking
  - `window.handleVisualFeedback()`: Shows illustrations/hints/success messages
  - `window.handleIntroVisual()`: Displays concept introductions

### Push-to-Talk Implementation

- Always-on push-to-talk mode using spacebar
- Microphone muted by default, activated only while key held
- Visual indicators for talk state and connection status

### Environment Setup

- Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_URL` in `env.js`
- Uses OpenAI's gpt-4o-realtime-preview model

### Agent Flow Logic

Agents are conditionally chained based on `isConceptIntroductionEnabled` flag in problem data:
- If enabled: greeter → introGiver → questionReader → stepTutor → closer
- If disabled: greeter → questionReader → stepTutor → closer

The brainStormer agent can be used as an alternative initial agent for more exploratory learning sessions.
