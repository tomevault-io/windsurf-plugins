# NeuronScope - AI Assistant Configuration

## Project Overview
NeuronScope is an open-source research and visualization platform for exploring neuron activations inside transformer models (initially GPT-2, with LLaMA support planned). The project aims to provide interactive, intuitive visual insights into how transformer model neurons activate, cluster, drift, and respond to various inputs.

## Architecture & Technology Stack
- **Backend/Core**: Python 3.11+ (PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)
- **Frontend/Web UI**: React with interactive plotting libraries (Plotly, D3.js)
- **Data Format**: JSON-based data exchange between backend and frontend
- **Optional**: C/Cython for performance optimization if >5x gains identified

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Follow the modular separation between backend (data generation, analysis) and frontend (interactive visual display)
- Use the defined data structures from `DATA_STRUCTURE.md` for all JSON outputs - if changes are required, please ask.
- Implement features as small, focused modules that can be completed in 1-2 prompts
- Break tasks into one-feature files to improve AI comprehension
- Do NOT make mock functions or stubs. Test data should be realistic.

### Python Backend Standards
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include comprehensive docstrings for all functions
- Structure activation data according to the JSON schema in `DATA_STRUCTURE.md`
- Use PyTorch for GPT-2 model loading and inference
- Implement clustering using scikit-learn (K-Means initially)

### React Frontend Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement responsive design principles
- Follow the visualization guidelines from `VISUALIZATION_GUIDELINES.md`
- Use Plotly.js for interactive visualizations
- Structure components to handle the defined JSON data formats
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

### Data Flow
1. User enters prompt or selects from samples
2. Python backend runs prompt through GPT-2, extracting activations
3. Backend saves structured JSON for activations, clusters, and queries
4. React frontend loads and visualizes data via interactive components

## Key Features to Implement (in order)

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- GPT-2 model loading and activation extraction
- Basic React app setup with routing
- JSON data structure implementation
- Sample prompt processing

### Phase 2: Visualization Core
- Neuron activation heatmaps
- Interactive scatter plots with PCA/t-SNE
- Basic clustering visualization
- Reverse activation query system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Neuron drift analysis across checkpoints
- Polysemantic neuron detection
- Animation support for temporal data
- CLI tools for batch processing

```

## Coding Standards

### Python
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Implement proper error handling for model loading and inference
- Use async/await for potentially long-running operations
- Include logging for debugging and monitoring
- Write unit tests for core functionality

### React/JavaScript
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Implement proper state management (useState, useContext)
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Follow React best practices for performance
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Visualization
- Prioritize interpretability over aesthetics
- Use consistent color schemes and styling
- Implement proper tooltips and legends
- Ensure accessibility (colorblind-friendly palettes)
- Design for scalability (small to large neuron counts)

## AI Assistant Instructions

### When Working on Backend
- Always consider the JSON output format defined in `DATA_STRUCTURE.md`
- Implement functions that can handle the sample prompts from `samples.json`
- Focus on modular, testable code that can be easily integrated
- Consider performance implications for large models or datasets

### When Working on Frontend
- Follow the visualization guidelines from `VISUALIZATION_GUIDELINES.md`
- Implement components that can handle the defined JSON data structures
- Focus on user experience and interactivity
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

### When Implementing New Features
- Check the TODO.md file for specific implementation tasks
