# CLAUDE.md

This is `bunwv` — a headless browser automation CLI built on Bun.WebView (Bun v1.3.12+). Cross-platform: WebKit on macOS (default), Chrome on Linux/Windows (auto-detected).

## Project Structure

```
bunwv.ts          # CLI entry point (shebang, arg parsing, commands)
lib/daemon.ts     # WebView daemon (Bun.serve on Unix socket, all routes)
skills/bunwv/     # Claude Code skill file (SKILL.md)
.claude-plugin/   # Marketplace plugin config
docs/             # Bun.WebView API reference notes
```

## Development

```bash
bun bunwv.ts help                    # run locally during dev
bun bunwv.ts start                   # test the daemon
bun bunwv.ts close                   # stop it
```

Default to Bun for everything — no Node, no npm scripts, no external dependencies.

## Architecture

- **CLI** (`bunwv.ts`) parses args into flags/positional, sends HTTP requests to the daemon via Unix socket
- **Daemon** (`lib/daemon.ts`) owns a `Bun.WebView` instance, exposes all WebView methods as HTTP routes on `/tmp/bunwv-<session>.sock`
- **Sessions** are isolated by name — each gets its own socket, PID file, and WebView instance
- **Auto-shutdown** after 30min idle (configurable via `--idle-timeout`)

## Design principles (agent-first)

`bunwv` is designed for AI coding agents driving it via discrete tool calls. Humans are a secondary user. When the two conflict, agent UX wins.

- **Statelessness over streams.** Every command is one request, one response, exit. No long-lived connections, no background processes for the agent to manage. "Tail" patterns use snapshot + cursor (`--since <seq>`), never streaming.
- **Token efficiency in the happy path.** Successful verbs print only what's needed to continue. `click`, `type`, `navigate`, `press`, `scroll`, `resize`, `back/forward/reload`: empty stdout, exit 0. Don't spend tokens confirming success.
- **Structure only where it earns its tokens.** JSON is ~30–50% heavier than prose for small outputs. Use plain text for simple success; use JSON for (a) errors, (b) genuinely structured data (events, console buffer, multi-field status under `--json`), (c) anywhere the agent must distinguish types — `evaluate` prints JSON-literal values so strings keep their quotes and numbers don't.
- **Reliability on the unhappy path.** Errors are always JSON on stderr with nonzero exit. Exit codes are stable and documented. Agents branch on exit code, not on stderr parsing. (0 ok, 1 generic, 2 usage, 3 timeout, 4 element-not-found, 5 daemon-unreachable.)
- **Error-level console auto-surfaces; everything else is pull.** If `console.error` or `console.warn` fires during a verb, the daemon attaches `X-Console-Errors` to the HTTP response and the CLI forwards it to process stderr as `{console:[…]}`. Normal logs, CDP events, and navigation events stay in ring buffers, fetched on demand via `bunwv console --since` / `bunwv events --since`.
- **File paths for binary outputs.** Screenshots default to a file path on disk; the agent's file-reading tools handle the image. `--encoding base64` and `--out -` (stdout) exist but are not the default.
- **`--json` for opt-in uniformity.** Agents that prefer one shape over terseness can force an envelope `{ok, data?, error?, exitCode}` on any command.
- **1:1 with Bun.WebView.** Every capability of the `Bun.WebView` type is reachable from the CLI. No JS-API-only escape hatches.

When in doubt: measure the token cost of the default output on the happy path. If it's not roughly zero, justify it.

## When the CLI surface changes

Any change that adds, removes, renames, or alters the behavior of a verb, flag, exit code, or output format must land in **all** of these files in the same commit. The 0.1.0 release shipped with a stale README because this wasn't enforced — don't repeat it.

- `bunwv.ts` — CLI parser and command dispatch
- `lib/daemon.ts` — matching HTTP route on the daemon
- `README.md` — public docs on GitHub + npm (commands tables, Quick Start, examples)
- `skills/bunwv/SKILL.md` — agent-facing docs (command list, usage patterns, limitations)
- `CLAUDE.md` — this file's "Browser Testing" quick reference at the bottom, plus any relevant design-principle updates
- `CHANGELOG.md` — a versioned entry under the next release (Breaking / Added / Changed / Migration as appropriate)
- `package.json` + `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — version bumps when shipping a release

Before committing a CLI change, grep each file for the old verb/flag name and confirm the new name appears where it should.

## Key Design Decisions

- Unix socket over TCP — no port conflicts, automatic filesystem discovery
- `clear` uses React-compatible native value setter (`HTMLInputElement.prototype.value.set`) — keyboard clearing doesn't update React state
- `submit` uses `form.requestSubmit()` — JS `.click()` produces `isTrusted: false` which React forms reject
- `evaluate` auto-wraps statements (`const`, `let`, etc.) in an IIFE — WebView's `evaluate()` only accepts expressions
- `click --text` resolves text → unique `data-bunwv-click-*` attribute → selector, so the actionability wait + `isTrusted: true` path is preserved
