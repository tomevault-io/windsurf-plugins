# VIT-AP Student App — working notes

An independent (not university-affiliated) Flutter app that reads a student's own
VTOP data using their own credentials. Built by Udhay Adithya.

## Stack

- **Flutter + Riverpod.** Most providers use `riverpod_annotation` codegen; a few
  are plain (`bottom_nav_provider.dart`, `schedule_clock.dart`). Both are fine.
- **All VTOP data goes through the Rust bridge** (`lib_vtop` via FRB). `http` is
  used only for the weather API and `announcements.json`. So a VTOP bug is a Rust
  bug — see `docs/vtop_frontend_handoff.md`.
- **ObjectBox** for persisted domain data, **SharedPreferences** for throwaway
  local state (dismissed announcements, engagement counters). Adding a property
  to an ObjectBox entity is a schema migration on a shipping app — don't do it
  for state that doesn't deserve one.
- Codegen: `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

## How to work here

**Discuss UI changes before implementing them.** The established rhythm is:
read the actual code, describe what's wrong and why, propose, get a decision,
then build. Skipping to code on a design task is not wanted.

**Extract rules into pure, tested functions.** Anything with a real rule in it —
deadlines, version gates, due dates, prompt eligibility — lives in a plain
function with an injectable `now`, not inside a widget. See
`outing_rules.dart`, `assignment_schedule.dart`, `semantic_version.dart`,
`review_prompt_policy.dart`. Regression tests carry a comment saying what bug
they lock down.

**Verify with `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`.** There is no Android device
attached in most sessions, so device verification usually can't happen — say so
plainly rather than implying something was seen working.

**Commits:** conventional, lowercase, single line, no body, no attribution.

## Design system

Established across the home, login, biometric, outing, assignment and account
screens. Follow it rather than inventing per-screen treatments.

- **Every colour comes from `ColorScheme`.** No `Colors.red/green/blue/orange` —
  they sit off the seeded cream/olive palette in light mode and glare in dark.
  Status maps to `primary` / `tertiary` / `error`, containers for fills.
- **One saturated element per screen.** If everything is loud, nothing is.
- **Radii:** 28 hero cards, 20 cards and sheets' inner blocks, 16 strips and
  inputs, stadium/999 for pills and primary buttons.
- **Inputs:** `appInputDecoration()` is the single treatment — filled, radius 16,
  floating label. Don't hand-roll `InputDecoration`.
- **Home page rhythm:** `SectionHeader.gapAbove` (28), `gapBelow` (12),
  `gutter` (16). Sections supply no top padding of their own, and no widget
  carries its own horizontal gutter.
- **Bespoke card treatments per surface, not global `CardTheme`** — theming
  cards globally repaints every card in the app.
- `StyledSheet` is this app's replacement for centre dialogs.
- Prefer `ListTile` over a hand-rolled `Row` in a fixed-height `SizedBox`; the
  latter is how rows end up top-aligned instead of centred.

## Things that will bite you

**VTOP demands an OTP per session.** `executeWithRetry` throws
`VtopError_LoginOtpRequired`, pauses, and shows a global sheet. **Never fetch on
page open** — it can demand an OTP for a page someone only glanced at. Biometric
and attendance both fetch on an explicit tap for this reason, and neither has
pull-to-refresh. This cost a 1-star review before the OTP sheet explained itself.

**The weekend outing form is only served Tue–Sat.** Outside that VTOP returns the
page with student fields stripped, and the Rust parser reports
`RegistrationParsingError` — mapped to a friendly message in
`outing_remote_repository.dart` only, since that variant means something else at
login.

**Timetable rows arrive in VTOP's order, not chronological.** Sort before
displaying. Empty grid cells arrive as `"-"`; `parseClassTime` returns null
rather than throwing.

**`announcements.json` is hand-edited and pushed with no validation.** Parsing is
deliberately lenient — one bad entry is skipped, unknown enums fall back, bad
dates become null. Keep it that way. See
`docs/announcements/ANNOUNCEMENT_SYSTEM_DOCS.md`.

**Upgrader:** both `UpgradeAlert` and `UpgradeCard` check `versionInfo != null`
*before* consulting `debugDisplayAlways`, so a failed store lookup can't be
forced open with a debug flag. One shared `appUpgrader` instance is used by both
surfaces — two instances means two store lookups and unshared "Later" state.

**The For You feed is cached, on purpose.** The home tab is torn down and rebuilt
on every tab switch, so an auto-disposed provider turned each one into a fetch of
a list that changes a few times a month. `ForYouViewModel` is `keepAlive`, and
`ForYouRepository` reads through a SharedPreferences cache with a 6h TTL and
`If-None-Match` revalidation. Don't make it fetch on build again. Contract and
required response headers: `docs/for_you/FOR_YOU_FEED_DOCS.md`.

**`AppConstants.forYouItemTypes` must match the API's `type` enum.** They drifted
once — the app offered `'events'` and `'other'` while the API validated against
