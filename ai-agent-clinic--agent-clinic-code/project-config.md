# Project Structure & Rules

This project workspace consists of multiple standalone projects separated into sub-folders (e.g., `e101/`, `e102/`, etc.).

## Core Rule: Standalone Projects
- Every sub-folder directly under the project workspace root must be treated as a fully independent, **standalone project**. 
- Code, dependencies, and execution contexts should remain isolated to their respective sub-directories.
- Do not create cross-dependencies between these standalone projects unless explicitly instructed.
