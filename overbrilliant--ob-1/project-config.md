## Conventions
- **Minimal runtime dependencies.** Prefer Bun built-ins (`bun:sqlite`, `fetch`, `node:*`) where they
  fit. Heavy optional features such as `browser_check` load their packages lazily; keep new runtime
  dependencies justified and narrow.
- **Run `bun run scripts/smoke.ts`** before committing memory/embedding changes.
- **Bundle-check** with `bun build src/index.ts --target=bun --outfile=/tmp/x.js` (no tsc install).
- Each layer is provider-/backend-swappable: sqlite-vec, tree-sitter, and other LLM providers
  are documented drop-in upgrades on a Node runtime.
- See `docs/planning/PROGRESS.md` for the phased roadmap and `docs/planning/ob1-plan.html` for the full design.
