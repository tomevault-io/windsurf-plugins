Do not change any code unless I specifically request it. By default, I'm looking for suggestions, both ideas on what to do and potential code snippets I could integrate.

When in doubt, do not include guards like `try: except`, `dictionary.get()`, `if len(data) == 0`, etc. I would much prefer if code obviously fails when something isn't as expected. I do not want silent failures or bloated code.
