# AI SDK Integration

The provider implements the `LanguageModelV2` contract and is designed to work with the Vercel AI SDK.

## Key Points

- Create models via the provider function: `const model = provider("gpt-4o")`.
- Supported operations include `doGenerate` and `doStream` (see [src/sap-ai-chat-language-model.ts](mdc:src/sap-ai-chat-language-model.ts)).
- Tool calling is supported by passing `tools` in call options.
- Structured outputs (JSON schema response_format) are enabled for most models except Anthropic and Amazon families.
- `n` (multi-choice) is disabled for Amazon models.

## Recommended API Usage

- Text generation: `generateText` with `model: provider("<modelId>")`.
- Streaming: `streamText` for SSE token streams.
- Structured outputs: `generateObject` when the model supports JSON schema.

Refer to examples in [README.md](mdc:README.md) and [examples/](mdc:examples/).
