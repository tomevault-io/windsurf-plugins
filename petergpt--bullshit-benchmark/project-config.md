# BullshitBench Agent Instructions

## Benchmark config alignment

- Treat config alignment as part of any model/test run, publish, or leaderboard update. Do not leave benchmark results only in ad hoc run artifacts, temporary configs, or published CSV/JSONL files.
- If a model/reasoning variant is published into `data/latest/*`, make sure the durable v1 config path knows about it. Use `config.json` for models that should remain in the reusable v1 run set, or document why a one-off config is intentionally kept separate.
- If a model/reasoning variant is published into `data/v2/latest/*`, make sure the durable v2 config path knows about it. Use `config.v2.json` for models that should remain in the reusable v2 run set, or document why a one-off config is intentionally kept separate.
- Use `config.new-models.v1.json` and `config.new-models.v2.json` for candidate catch-up sweeps before results are published. After publishing, either fold the successful model/reasoning variants into the main config or explicitly remove/defer them from the catch-up config.
- Keep `collect.models`, `collect.model_reasoning_efforts`, and any `collect.model_request_overrides` in sync. If a model has non-default reasoning variants, every intended variant should be represented in `model_reasoning_efforts`.
- Before adding a current OpenRouter slug, check whether the repo already has an equivalent older/beta/alias row in `data/latest/leaderboard.csv`, `data/v2/latest/leaderboard.csv`, and `viewer/index.v2.html` display aliases. Do not duplicate a row family unless the user explicitly wants a rerun of the new slug.
- Avoid adding expensive or low-priority models to catch-up configs when the user has excluded them. In this repo, do not add `openai/gpt-5.4-pro` unless the user explicitly asks for that cost.
- When adding new model IDs, update or plan the matching metadata path before publish: `data/model_metadata/model_launch_dates.csv` for release-date charts and `data/model_metadata/model_params.csv` where model-size/licensing data is available.

## Private/local-only runs

- If the user marks a model, run, dataset, or viewer as private, pre-release, local-only, not-for-publication, or not-for-GitHub, treat that instruction as overriding the normal config-alignment and publish workflow.
- For private/local-only runs, do not write raw responses, grades, aggregate rows, reports, viewer HTML, leaderboard rows, model metadata, or configs into tracked repo paths. In particular, do not touch `data/latest/*`, `data/v2/latest/*`, `viewer/index.v2.html`, `config.json`, `config.v2.json`, `config.new-models.v1.json`, `config.new-models.v2.json`, or `data/model_metadata/*` unless the user later explicitly says to publish.
- Store private/local-only artifacts outside the repo, preferably under `/Users/peter/.codex/private/bullshit-benchmark/<run-id>/`. If a local browser viewer is needed, serve it from that private directory on `127.0.0.1` rather than from the repo tree.
- Before publishing, committing, or pushing any benchmark update, explicitly check that no private/local-only identifiers or files are in tracked content. At minimum run `git status --short --untracked-files=no`, inspect the intended diff, and use `git grep`/`git ls-files` for the private model IDs, run IDs, and local viewer paths.
- Do not put private model IDs, API keys, raw private outputs, or exact private leaderboard results into tracked instructions or docs. If future-agent context is needed, keep exact details in a private handoff file outside the repo and reference it generically.
- If `/Users/peter/.codex/private/bullshit-benchmark/PRIVATE_RUNS.md` exists, read it before handling local-only benchmark data, private viewer setup, or publish/push safety checks.

## Verification

- At minimum, after config edits run JSON parsing for every edited config and a dry-run collection for the relevant config, for example:
  `python3 scripts/openrouter_benchmark.py collect --config config.new-models.v2.json --dry-run --limit 1 --output-dir /tmp/bullshit-benchmark-config-check --run-id config_check`
- If the task is specifically about OpenRouter coverage, re-query `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` and compare against the combined durable config set before answering.
