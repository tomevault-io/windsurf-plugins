# Copilot/Agent Instructions — Semantic Kernel MCP Server

Purpose: Fast-orient AI coding agents (Copilot/agent) to be productive in this repository.

Summary (big picture):
- This repo implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using the C# MCP SDK and integrates Microsoft Semantic Kernel. The server runs as a stdio tool and exposes tools (MCP endpoints) that clients (e.g., VS Code Copilot) can call.
- Major components:
  - `SemanticKernelMcpServer/Program.cs`: MCP server host configuration, registers tools and stdio transport.
  - `SemanticKernelMcpServer/Tools/`: MCP tools. Key files:
    - `SemanticKernelAgentTools.cs`: Agent-based tools using Semantic Kernel (ChatCompletionAgent).
    - `RandomNumberTools.cs`: simple sample tool (non-AI).
  - `SemanticKernelMcpServer/Plugins/TaskManagementPlugin.cs`: Semantic Kernel plugin with `[KernelFunction]` methods for CRUD operations on in-memory tasks.
  - `.mcp/server.json` + `.vscode/mcp.json`: server metadata and VS Code config (environment variables and runtime args).

What to know first (immediate priorities):
- `Program.cs` adds the server and registers tools: `.AddMcpServer().WithStdioServerTransport().WithTools<...>()`.
- Tools are annotated with `[McpServerTool]`. These methods are published to MCP clients.
- The agent uses `ChatCompletionAgent` and `Kernel` (Semantic Kernel). Plugins are registered via `builder.Plugins.AddFromType<T>("PluginName")`.
- Kernel functions are annotated with `[KernelFunction]` and are available for function calling. Example: `TaskManagementPlugin.CreateTask`.

Development workflows & commands agents should use:
- Build:
  - `dotnet build` (solution or project folder `SemanticKernelMcpServer`).
- Run locally for testing (stdio MCP server):
  - `dotnet run --project SemanticKernelMcpServer/SemanticKernelMcpServer.csproj`.
- VS Code (developer experience):
  - Update `.vscode/mcp.json` if using a local build; set environment variables for AI if needed.
  - Use GitHub Copilot Agent Mode and `Select tools` to see the available MCP tools.
- Package & Publish (optional):
  - `dotnet pack -c Release` to produce `.nupkg` files.
  - `dotnet nuget push bin/Release/*.nupkg --api-key <key> --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`.

Key repo-specific conventions & patterns:
- Tools: Methods annotated with `[McpServerTool]` are canonical MCP entry points. Keep them high-level and thin; routing to the plugin or agent inside the method.
- Plugins: `TaskManagementPlugin` demonstrates the plugin pattern (kernel functions) that is safe for tool calling. Prefer registering plugins with `builder.Plugins.AddFromType<T>()`.
- AI Service Configuration: The agent is created in `SemanticKernelAgentTools()`; the `Kernel` builder needs `AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion()` or `AddOpenAIChatCompletion()` to enable AI features. If those are not set, the agent will return a friendly message and fall back to direct tools.
- Function Calling Behavior: The `OpenAIPromptExecutionSettings` with `FunctionChoiceBehavior.Auto()` is used to auto-invoke kernel functions; keep argument shapes and descriptions clear.

Integration points & environment variables:
- `.mcp/server.json` declares environment variables for `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`, and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`. These map to the runtime environment for the MCP server for enabling AI features.
- `.vscode/mcp.json` contains a `SemanticKernelMcpServer` configuration pointing to `dotnet run` and environment placeholders.

Testing & debugging guidance:
- When the server is running, logs go to stderr (stdout is reserved for MCP protocol messages). `Program.cs` configures logging to send console logs to stderr.
- Reprocamp: If build fails due to app lock, stop running server process (`Stop-Process` on Windows) — we saw this lock during build earlier.
- No unit tests yet — CI runs `dotnet test` but doesn't fail the build if tests are missing. If adding tests, include them under a `tests/` project and reference the solution.

Patterns to follow when editing code:
- Register new tools under `Program.cs` with `WithTools<ToolClass>()`.
- Expose behavior to agents via `TaskManagementPlugin` by annotating with `[KernelFunction]`.
- Make sure public tool method signatures are documented using `[Description]` and parameter descriptions so agents know how to use them.
- Avoid modifying MCP transport or protocol logic unless necessary — the `ModelContextProtocol` library handles message framing; prefer adding tools and functions.

Important TODOs an agent may perform (examples):
- Add new kernel plugin that integrates with a data store (replace in-memory `List<TaskItem>` with persistence; update `TaskManagementPlugin` to use DI for storage).
- Add AI service configuration with environment-driven secrets in `.vscode/mcp.json` and documentation.
- Implement unit tests and add `dotnet test` expectations in CI.
- Add proper error handling and logging to tools that call agent methods.

Where to look for examples:
- Native MCP tool example: `SemanticKernelMcpServer/Tools/RandomNumberTools.cs`.
- AI agent example: `SemanticKernelMcpServer/Tools/SemanticKernelAgentTools.cs`.
- Plugin example with kernel functions & outputs: `SemanticKernelMcpServer/Plugins/TaskManagementPlugin.cs`.

File references:
- `SemanticKernelMcpServer/Program.cs` — server bootstrap & tool registration.
- `SemanticKernelMcpServer/Tools/SemanticKernelAgentTools.cs` — how to build `Kernel`, create `ChatCompletionAgent`, and call agent.
- `SemanticKernelMcpServer/Plugins/TaskManagementPlugin.cs` — pattern for kernel functions (`[KernelFunction]`).
- `.mcp/server.json` & `.vscode/mcp.json` — MCP metadata and VS Code integration config.

If you need help performing an operation, suggest this:
- For code changes: create a focused PR describing the intent and include examples of expected MCP responses and how to test them locally via `dotnet run` and VS Code Agent Mode.
- For adding AI configuration: add `AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(...)` calls to `Kernel` builder and update `.vscode/mcp.json` environment variables.

If something is ambiguous or missing here, ask which area to expand (run patterns, plugin conventions, test wiring, or CI updates).

Now I'll commit this file and push it to the repository. (I can further refine if you want more detail or examples.)
