# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## What this is

Blume is a zero-config documentation site generator: users drop Markdown/MDX in a folder, and the `blume` CLI generates and drives a **hidden Astro project in `.blume/`** (dev server, static build, search, OG images, theming). `blume eject` turns that into a standalone Astro app. Zero-config mode is a permanent, first-class design goal — never treat it as a stepping stone to "real" configuration.

## Repository map

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/blume` | The published npm package: CLI, Astro runtime, components, core logic. |
| `apps/docs` | The dogfooded docs site (useblume.dev). Content lives in `apps/docs/content/docs`. |
| `packages/video` | Remotion project for launch/marketing videos. Excluded from `build`. |
| `skills/` | Agent skills shipped with the package (`blume`, `blume-migrate`, `blume-update-docs`). Judgment-heavy workflows (like migration) ship as skills; mechanical checks ship as CLI commands. |
| `patches/` | Bun `patchedDependencies` (currently `oxfmt` — see Gotchas). |
| `plans/` | Working design notes; not shipped. |

Within `packages/blume/src`: `cli/` (Node-side CLI, the only part bundled to `dist/`), `core/` (config, content, navigation, schema), `astro/` (integration), `components/`, `runtime/`, `search/`, `og/`, `openapi/`, `translate/`, `audit/`, `theme/`.

## Toolchain and commands

Bun is the package manager (`bun install`, version pinned in `package.json#packageManager`); Turbo orchestrates workspaces. Node ≥ 22.12 is required at runtime.

From the repo root:

```bash
bun run check          # lint + format check (ultracite → oxlint/oxfmt)
bun run fix            # auto-fix lint/format
bun run typecheck      # tsgo --noEmit across workspaces
bun run test           # bun test via turbo
bun run test:coverage  # tests with the coverage gate (what CI and pre-commit run)
bun run build          # builds everything except packages/video
```

In `apps/docs`, scripts are the Blume CLI itself: `blume dev`, `blume build`, `blume check`, `blume audit`, plus `playwright test` for e2e.

- **TypeScript is pinned to `^6.0.3`. Never bump to 7** — the Go rewrite has no JS API (`ts.sys` is gone) and Blume's tooling depends on it. Speed comes from `tsgo`, not a TS upgrade.
- **Never run `npx oxfmt` or `npx oxlint`.** The repo patches `oxfmt` (fence/directive preservation); `npx` resolves an unpatched copy that mangles `:::` directives. Always use `bun run check` / `bun run fix`. If oxlint fails with ENOENT, run `bun install` and retry.
- The husky pre-commit hook runs `check`, `typecheck`, `test:coverage`, and the blume build — **commits take minutes**. Use generous timeouts (600s) when committing from a tool; a hanging commit is usually the suite, not signing.

## Testing and coverage

- `packages/blume` enforces **100% line and function coverage, per file**, via `bunfig.toml` — but only under `--coverage`. `bun test` alone won't tell you the gate fails.
- Branches guarded by environment variables need tests that explicitly set **and delete** the variable, or local coverage diverges from CI.
- `Intl.Segmenter`/ICU behavior differs between macOS and Linux (e.g. what counts as word-like). Cover tokenizer branches with rule-based inputs (like a trailing U+200D), not locale-dependent characters, or CI will fail where local passes.
- For dev/build e2e tests, reuse the helpers in `test/configured-integrations.test.ts`. Known flake patterns: double config restarts, startup wedges, readiness fetches that hang, builds that never exit, pipe drains that never EOF after a kill. Never use fixed sleeps or bare drain awaits.
- Tests write fixtures to `os.tmpdir()` under `blume-*` prefixes; coverage ignores those paths already.

## Architecture rules

- **`.blume/` is shared state** between `blume dev` and `blume build`. Never run a destructive build or `rm -rf .blume` while a dev server is running against it.
- **Only `src/cli` ships as a Node bundle** (`dist/cli/index.js`); the Astro runtime ships as source. Node-side code must resolve package files with `packageRoot()` from `core/package-root.ts`, never `import.meta`-relative offsets — those break in the bundled CLI.
- **Front matter goes through `core/frontmatter.ts`.** Never `import matter from "gray-matter"` directly; the wrapper injects a js-yaml engine so js-yaml 4 consumers don't crash on the removed `safeLoad`.
- **Dependency mirroring:** the generated `.blume/` project resolves deps through the `blume` package, _except_ anything it imports **by name** — those need a mirror entry in the root `package.json` devDependencies (this is why e.g. `takumi-js` and `sharp` appear at the root). rolldown-vite silently bundles unresolvable externals, so a missing mirror only surfaces on a **cache-cold** Vercel build ("Cannot find native binding") — green CI and warm-cache previews prove nothing. Reproduce locally with `VERCEL=1`.
- **`bun add` cwd trap:** running `bun add` from the repo root lands Blume runtime deps in the root manifest, where hoisting hides the mistake until publish. `bun update <transitive>` can also promote transitives to root deps — fix by stripping the `bun.lock` entries and re-running `bun install`, not by keeping the root entry.
