# CLAUDE.md — website

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working on the website in this repository.

## What this is

A marketing site for **Vocello** (formerly QwenVoice), a local-first Mac TTS app. Single-page React + Vite. This directory lives inside the QwenVoice monorepo at `website/` and is deployed by Vercel with `website/` as the project root. The site is the brand surface for the app in the parent repo — see "Content accuracy" below. For repo-wide conventions, the app engine, and the source-of-truth order, see the root [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md); this file is scoped to the website only.

## Commands

```sh
npm --prefix website run dev      # from repo root: vite dev server on localhost:5173
npm --prefix website run lint     # deterministic source/metadata/accessibility contract
npm --prefix website test         # dependency-free Node contract fixtures
npm --prefix website run build    # from repo root: production build -> website/dist/
npm --prefix website run check    # lint + test + build
npm --prefix website run preview  # from repo root: serve the production build
```

When already inside `website/`, omit `--prefix website` from the same commands.

The dependency-free Node contract checks metadata, public release identity, internal anchors,
image alt text, safe external links, assets, visible punctuation, and unqualified performance
claims. The parent `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs those checks plus the Vite production build with
the exact Node/npm identities from `config/toolchain.json`. Browser review remains useful for visual
behavior; Vercel owns deployment for this directory.

## Tooling for this directory

- This is a **non-app, non-native zone** — do not run Swift/iOS/macOS skills or audits here.
- For React, Vite, or library API questions, use authoritative current documentation and a docs or
  library MCP when callable.
- For UI/UX/visual passes, read `PRODUCT.md` and `DESIGN.md` first, then use a browser MCP when it
  is currently available against the running dev/preview server. Otherwise use the same local
  server for attended browser verification and record unreachable states.
- Run `npm`/`node` commands through the shell.

## Architecture

`src/App.jsx` is a **thin composer** (~73 lines). All UI is split across:

- `src/sections/` — one file per page section, in render order: `Nav`, `Hero`, `WorkflowBand` (rendered 3× from data), `Listen`, `Capabilities`, `WhyCloud`, `TryIt`, `HowItRuns`, `Limitations`, `FinalCTA`, `Footer`.
- `src/components/` — three shared primitives:
  - `Icon.jsx` — single switch over an 18-case SVG vocabulary. Also exports `makeWaveBars` (deterministic bar-height generator).
  - `Waveform.jsx` — bar waveform for Listen rows.
  - `TryCanvas.jsx` — canvas-driven animated waveform for the TryIt demo. Reads `DELIVERY_COLORS` from `data/samples.js` and a local `DELIVERY_SHAPES` table; hashed brief content + per-delivery shape parameters drive the rendering.
- `src/data/` — **single sources of truth**:
  - `workflows.js` (`WORKFLOWS`): the three voice workflow bands' copy + screenshot paths.
  - `samples.js` (`SAMPLES`, `DELIVERIES`, `DELIVERY_COLORS`): Listen samples (with `src` paths into `public/assets/voice-samples/`) + the TryIt delivery picker options.
  - `credits.js` (`CREDITS`, `REPO`, `RELEASE_LATEST`, `RELEASE_V1`): "Built on" tech list + GitHub URLs. Used by `FinalCTA.jsx` for the closing credits roll.
- `src/site.css` + `src/tokens.css` — single global stylesheet (tokens.css is imported from site.css). No CSS modules, no styled components.

### Responsive breakpoints

Three breakpoints in `site.css`, applied universally:

- `<1100px` — hero stacks (copy first, then Mac window).
- `<900px` — workflow bands stack, listen rows stack, runs spec collapses to single column, try-inner stacks, nav-links hide, **all content text-aligns center** (text blocks added `margin-inline: auto` to center as blocks, not just inner text).
- `<600px` — container padding tightens, `formerly QwenVoice` clarifier hides, CTA shrinks.

When changing grid layouts at narrow breakpoints, **use `grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr)` instead of `1fr`** — grid items default to `min-width: auto` which equals content's intrinsic width, and several children (e.g., `.workflow-band-points` with `width: max-content`) force columns wider than the container. Every narrow-breakpoint grid in this file already uses `minmax(0, …)` for this reason.

## Content accuracy (required reading)

Two design-context files in this directory encode the website's rules:

- **`PRODUCT.md`** (i.e. `website/PRODUCT.md`, the brand doc — distinct from the repo-root `PRODUCT.md` app-product doc) — brand voice, register (`brand`, not product), copy rules. Required by the `impeccable` skill when that skill is available. Key constraints:
  - Say *local*, not *offline* or *on-device*, unless the technical distinction matters.
  - Sentence case. Reserve all caps for tiny labels only.
  - **No em dashes in visible copy.** Use commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses.
    After any copy change, scan visible text for the em-dash character; the repository
    documentation contract enforces this policy.
