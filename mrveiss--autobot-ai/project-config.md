# AutoBot Development Instructions

Index plus the rules that are catastrophic to miss. Everything else is in `docs/developer/` —
read a doc when its trigger fires, not before. Universal rules (worktree mandate, issue
decomposition, evidence, model tiers, never-idle) live in the global instructions and are not
repeated here; where the two disagree, **this file wins**.

## Read when triggered

| Trigger | Doc |
|---|---|
| Starting a task — the 8 core rules in full | [`CLAUDE_RULES.md`](docs/developer/CLAUDE_RULES.md) |
| Branching, worktree collisions, stashing, force-push, push recovery | [`CLAUDE_GIT.md`](docs/developer/CLAUDE_GIT.md) |
| Labels, `gh` workarounds, deployment, pre-merge gates | [`CLAUDE_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/developer/CLAUDE_WORKFLOW.md) |
| Opening, reviewing, or merging a PR (incl. the required body headings) | [`CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`](docs/developer/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md) |
| Closing an issue | [`CLAUDE_CLOSURE.md`](docs/developer/CLAUDE_CLOSURE.md) |
| Running parallel agents or a batch | [`CLAUDE_BATCH.md`](docs/developer/CLAUDE_BATCH.md) |
| Need a service, port, or architecture fact | [`AUTOBOT_REFERENCE.md`](docs/developer/AUTOBOT_REFERENCE.md) |
| Adding an event type, WebSocket route, bus, or session state | [`EVENT_STATE_DOCTRINE.md`](docs/developer/EVENT_STATE_DOCTRINE.md) |
| Reviewing or changing path validation, session ownership, plugin loading, or secrets | [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](docs/developer/THREAT_MODEL.md) |
| Claiming a work scope, adding a lock/lease, or any "which agent owns this" state | [`AGENT_COORDINATION.md`](docs/developer/AGENT_COORDINATION.md) |
| Deviating from a standard pattern on purpose | [`ARCHITECTURE_EXCEPTIONS.md`](docs/developer/ARCHITECTURE_EXCEPTIONS.md) |
| Adding a ratchet, changing its detector or matcher, or freezing/regenerating a baseline | [`RATCHET_BASELINES.md`](docs/developer/RATCHET_BASELINES.md) |
| Writing or changing a guard, sweep, count, or acceptance criterion — or reading an empty result | [`MEASUREMENT_DISCIPLINE.md`](docs/developer/MEASUREMENT_DISCIPLINE.md) |

## Engineering Standard

Correctness → Speed → Maintainability. No wasted motion, no speculative work.
Parallelize independent calls · minimal surface area · async-first · ≤3 exploration commands
then act.

**The 8 core rules** — full text in [`CLAUDE_RULES.md`](docs/developer/CLAUDE_RULES.md):
1 Check before writing · 2 Reuse from `autobot_shared/` · 3 Standardize (≤30-line functions,
no `_v2`/`_fix` suffixes) · 4 Clarify ambiguous architecture before coding · 5 Verify with
evidence · 6 Report **and fix** every discovered problem · 7 Grep the *behavior*, not the
symbol, on extraction PRs · 8 Outbound HTTP goes through the guarded fetch (egress policy).

## Never violate

- **Say "I don't know" — never fabricate.** But an admission is not a closure — it is an opening: it means *"I need help, let's find this together"*, so **ask right then** in an interactive session, and where there is nobody to ask leave the criterion unticked, file it, and never drop it. A *stated* gap is a finding; an *unstated* one is the defect. A guessed cause, count or verdict is the one error treated as serious — for an agent a wrong answer is not an opinion, it executes. "I could not determine X" is a contribution. Guards and reports distinguish *nothing found* from *did not look*. See [`MEASUREMENT_DISCIPLINE.md`](docs/developer/MEASUREMENT_DISCIPLINE.md).
- **PRs target `main`; `release` is the release branch.** `release`/`master` are blocked by the pre-commit hook — use `issue-*` or `hotfix-*`.
- **Never work from a stale base** — and the half that bites is the judgement, not the freshness. Answer "is this already done?" against current `origin/main` and the issue's acceptance criteria, **never against an old branch**: a stale answer points toward doing *more* work, so nothing pushes back on it, and reviving such a branch can regress newer code. `git fetch origin` and branch from (or rebase onto) current base before the first edit — the auto-update bot only refreshes branches that already have a PR, so the window this covers is everything before the first push.
- **Commit format:** `<type>(scope): <description> (#issue-number)`. Never `--no-verify` — a PostToolUse hook auto-formats `.py`.
- **Never hardcode.** Config via SSOT, TTLs via env-var-backed module constants, no IPs or ports in code.
- **The codebase is the source of truth** — never edit `/opt/autobot/` or `/var/log/autobot/`.
- **System updates (test AND prod) go through the builtin updater only** — the code-sync API / self-update path a user reaches in the maintenance UI. If the builtin cannot do it, fix that gap (issue + PR); never side-channel via ad-hoc ansible or shell.
- **Security reviews are findings-first** — one-line verdict, then a severity/`file:line`/issue/fix table, within 3 tool calls. Verify *after*; never explore before the verdict lands. Skill: `secreview`.
- **Nothing internal in outward artifacts** — no IPs, hostnames, secrets, tokens, or internal filesystem paths in issues, PRs, comments or logs. Redact to a generic role or node reference.
