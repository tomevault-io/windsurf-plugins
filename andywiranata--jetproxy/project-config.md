# GEMINI Plan: A 10x Vision for JetProxy

This document outlines a strategic roadmap to evolve JetProxy from a capable reverse proxy into a category-defining, AI-native API gateway, making it 10x more powerful, efficient, and intelligent than competitors like Traefik.

Our vision is centered on three core pillars:
1.  **Unmatched Performance and Efficiency**
2.  **AI-Powered Intelligence and Automation**
3.  **Next-Generation Developer Experience**

---

## 1. Unleash Unprecedented Performance with Native & Async Core

Traefik is fast, but JetProxy can be faster and more efficient by leveraging its modern Java foundation.

*   **Why it's 10x:** Go beyond just routing. Achieve near-native performance with significantly lower memory overhead, enabling higher density and lower operational costs. The existing GraalVM native image build is the perfect foundation for this.
*   **How to Achieve It:**
    *   **Aggressively Optimize for GraalVM:** Make native compilation a first-class feature. Systematically audit and refactor any code that relies on Java reflection to ensure a seamless and highly efficient native image build.
    *   **Embrace an Async-First Architecture:** While Jetty is excellent, evaluate a full transition to a non-blocking, asynchronous framework like **Eclipse Vert.x** or **Netty**. This would maximize concurrency and dramatically improve throughput for high-volume, I/O-bound workloads.
    *   **Publish Benchmarks:** Create a public, reproducible benchmarking suite that compares JetProxy (in both JIT and native modes) against Traefik, Nginx, and Envoy on key metrics: latency, requests per second (RPS), and memory usage for HTTP, gRPC, and REST-to-gRPC transcoding.

---

## 2. The Gemini Advantage: The First AI-Native API Gateway

This is the core differentiator. Instead of being a passive proxy, JetProxy will become an active, intelligent control plane.

*   **Why it's 10x:** Move from declarative configuration to intelligent, real-time optimization. Let developers declare *intent* while JetProxy, powered by AI, handles the *execution*.
*   **How to Achieve It:**
    *   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection (Security):**
        *   Integrate a machine learning model that analyzes traffic patterns in real-time.
        *   Automatically detect and flag anomalies like DDoS attempts, unusual request payloads, or credential stuffing attacks, providing a self-learning Web Application Firewall (WAF).
    *   **AI-Assisted Configuration & Routing:**
        *   Create a CLI or dashboard feature where a user can describe a routing goal in natural language (e.g., *"Create a canary route for the 'users-v2' service, starting with 5% of traffic from EU regions only"*).
        *   Gemini would translate this intent into the correct `config.yaml` stanza.
    *   **Predictive Autoscaling Hooks:**
        *   Analyze historical metrics (via OpenTelemetry) to predict traffic surges.
        *   Expose webhooks that can trigger autoscaling events in container orchestrators (like Kubernetes HPA or KEDA) *before* the surge hits, enabling proactive scaling instead of reactive.

## 3. Next-Generation Developer Experience (DX)

Focus on making JetProxy the easiest, most powerful tool for developers to manage API traffic.

*   **Why it's 10x:** Eliminate configuration complexity and provide unparalleled insight into traffic flow, turning the proxy from a piece of infrastructure into a true development tool.
*   **How to Achieve It:**
    *   **Polyglot, Sandboxed Middleware via WASM:**
        *   Evolve the middleware engine to support plugins compiled to **WebAssembly (WASM)**.
        *   This allows developers to write custom, high-performance middleware in any language (Rust, Go, TinyGo, AssemblyScript) and run it in a secure, sandboxed environment. This is a massive advantage over Traefik's Go-specific plugin system.
    *   **Unified API Control Plane:**
        *   Deepen the **REST-to-gRPC transcoding** feature. Add support for automatic schema validation and transformation.
        *   Add first-class support for **WebSockets** and **GraphQL**, making JetProxy a single entry point for all modern application protocols.
    *   **Integrated Debugging and Observability:**
        *   Build a more advanced dashboard that doesn't just show metrics but provides actionable insights.
        *   Visualize the entire lifecycle of a request as it flows through middleware, showing timing for each step.
        *   Directly integrate and visualize distributed traces (from OpenTelemetry) within the JetProxy dashboard, allowing developers to pinpoint bottlenecks without switching tools.
