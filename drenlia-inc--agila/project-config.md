# Confirmation dialogs

When building confirmation boxes / overlays (delete forever, empty trash, destructive confirms, etc.):

1. **Cancel** button dismisses without confirming.
2. **Escape** dismisses the same as Cancel.
3. **Click / pointer outside** the confirmation surface dismisses the same as Cancel.
4. Defer outside-click listeners until after the opening click (e.g. `setTimeout(0)`), so the click that opened the dialog does not immediately close it.
5. Prefer `role="dialog"` (and `aria-modal` when appropriate) on the confirmation surface.
6. Do not rely on `window.confirm` for app chrome confirmations unless there is a strong existing reason.

Apply this to both modal-style and inline/popover confirms (e.g. trash bulk purge, per-card purge).
