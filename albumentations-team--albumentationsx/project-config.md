# Testing Conventions

## Prefer Standard Transform Calls Over Direct Method Calls

Use `transform(image=image)` / `transform(images=images)` through `Compose`, not direct calls like `transform.apply()` or `transform.apply_to_images()`.

This exercises the full pipeline (parameter generation, dtype handling, Compose routing) and catches integration issues.

```python
# CORRECT - use transform call interface
transform = A.Compose([A.MedianBlur(blur_range=(3, 7), p=1.0)])

# Single image
result = transform(image=image)["image"]

# Batch of images
batch_result = transform(images=images)["images"]

# INCORRECT - avoid direct method calls in tests
result = transform.apply(image, kernel=3)
batch_result = transform.apply_to_images(images, kernel=3)
```

## Parallel Test Execution

Use `pytest-xdist` to run tests in parallel:

```bash
# Run tests using all available CPU cores
pytest -n auto

# Run tests using a specific number of workers
pytest -n 4
```

Ensure tests are independent and don't share mutable global state so they can run safely in parallel.
