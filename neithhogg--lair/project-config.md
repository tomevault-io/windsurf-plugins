# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

**lair** is a reusable skill set for the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) platform. It provides five user-invocable skills (`/project-init`, `/project-sync`, `/project-config`, `/tdd`, `/pre-push`) that bootstrap new AI-assisted projects with scope discipline, living documentation, and code quality guardrails. Distributed via `npx skills add neithhogg/lair`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run setup      # Install lair skills locally + recommended third-party skills
npm run validate   # Validate all SKILL.md frontmatter (run before pushing)
```

Node 22+ required (see `.nvmrc`). No external npm dependencies.

## Architecture

### Skills (`skills/*/SKILL.md`)

Each skill is a single Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name        # Must match directory name exactly
description: >          # Min 20 chars; used for auto-invocation matching
  ...
disable-model-invocation: true  # Explicit /command only (no auto-trigger)
---
```

Frontmatter is validated against `scripts/skill-schema.json`. User-invocable skills must also have an `evals/` subdirectory (CI enforces this).

### The Five Skills

**`/project-init`** — 4-phase project bootstrap:
1. Discovery (5 rounds: idea, users, scope boundaries, constraints, success metrics)
2. Tech stack proposal (every choice traced to Phase 1 constraints)
3. File scaffold (generates PROJECT.md, JOURNAL.md, .gitignore, tmp/README.md)
4. Skill discovery (searches skills.sh, user multi-selects to install)

**`/project-sync`** — keeps all project docs accurate and consistent:
- Auto-reads git history and file changes to determine what shipped and what's planned
- JOURNAL.md is a plain checklist: `- [x]` done, `- [ ]` planned (no verbose entries)
- Performs a consistency pass across PROJECT.md, JOURNAL.md, CLAUDE.md — fixes stale content
- Confirms proposed changes once before writing

**`/project-config`** — generates the right AI agent context file for any codebase:
- Detects the running agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- Scans the codebase for commands, architecture, and style config
- Writes CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, or .cursorrules as appropriate

**`/tdd`** — strict red-green-refactor TDD cycle:
1. Detect test runner and file conventions from project files
2. Write failing test only (confirm before any write, verify it fails for the right reason)
3. Write minimal implementation (green), then offer a refactor pass

**`/pre-push`** — local CI runner before git push:
1. Detect test/lint/build/type-check commands from package.json, Makefile, go.mod, CI workflows
2. Present a numbered menu, confirm selection before running anything
3. Execute in sequence, stop on first failure, report a pass/fail summary

### Living Documents Pattern

PROJECT.md (scope/stack reference) + JOURNAL.md (living checklist) travel together in every project bootstrapped by lair, giving any AI agent full session context.

### Supporting Scripts

- `scripts/setup.js` — installs lair's own skills + recommended third-party skills; failures are warnings only
- `scripts/validate-skills.js` — parses YAML frontmatter, checks schema, verifies directory/name alignment
- `scripts/skills.recommended.json` — team-vetted third-party skills to auto-install during setup

## CI

`.github/workflows/validate-skills.yml` runs on PRs touching skill files:
1. `npm run validate` — checks all SKILL.md frontmatter
2. Verifies `evals/` directories exist for each user-invocable skill

## Contributing

**Adding a skill:**
1. Create `skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` with valid frontmatter
2. Run `npm run validate` locally
3. If user-invocable, run `/skill-creator` to generate `evals/`
4. Commit as `skill: add my-skill`

**Updating recommended skills:** edit `scripts/skills.recommended.json` and PR.

**Iterating on existing skills:** re-run `/skill-creator` to refresh evals after edits to user-invocable skills.
