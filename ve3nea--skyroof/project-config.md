# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines

- never implement functionality that was not explicitly requested. for example: if asked to add a "Save" button, add the button
and any minimal wiring (event hookup) but do not implement the file-saving logic unless explicitly requested to do so.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Indent with 2 spaces
- Use camelCase for variables and parameters
- Use PascalCase for all other identifiers
- do not put curly braces around a single statement if syntax rules allow
- place the statement that follows if(), while(), etc. on the same line if it fits
- start comment with a lower case letter unless it is all-capitals
- never remove any comments or blank lines
- ensure that no syntax errors are introduced by your formatting changes
