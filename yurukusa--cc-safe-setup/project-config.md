# Project Rules

## Safety
- Do not push to main/master directly
- Do not force-push
- Do not delete files outside this project
- Do not commit .env or credential files
- Run tests before committing

## Code Style
- Follow existing conventions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments only when the logic isn't obvious

## Git
- Use descriptive commit messages
- One logical change per commit
- Create feature branches for new work
