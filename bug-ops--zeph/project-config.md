# GitHub Automation Guide

This directory contains CI, release, and repository automation files.

- Keep workflow commands aligned with the actual supported local commands in the repository.
- Prefer explicit, reproducible CI steps over clever shell tricks.
- If you change checks, matrix entries, release flow, or badges, update the relevant docs and README references.
- Treat permission scopes, tokens, and supply-chain settings as security-sensitive.
