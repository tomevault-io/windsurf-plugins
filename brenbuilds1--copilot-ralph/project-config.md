# Agent Instructions

## Skills

### prd-generator (`skills/prd/SKILL.md`)

Generates `prd.json` files for Ralph autonomous implementation.

**Triggers:** "create a PRD", "generate a PRD", "plan a feature", "write user stories", "set up Ralph for [feature]"

**Workflow:**
1. Asks 3-5 clarifying questions with A/B/C/D options
2. Generates structured prd.json with properly-sized user stories
3. Each story includes specific, verifiable acceptance criteria

## Commands

```bash
# Run Ralph with default 10 iterations
./ralph.sh

# Run with custom max iterations
./ralph.sh 25

# Check story status
cat prd.json | jq '.userStories[] | {id, title, passes}'

# View progress log
cat progress.txt
```

## How It Works

1. `ralph.sh` runs a bash loop
2. Each iteration calls: `copilot -p "$PROMPT" --allow-all-tools`
3. Copilot reads `prd.json` and `progress.txt` for context
4. Copilot implements one story, commits, updates `prd.json`
5. Loop checks for `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` to exit
6. Otherwise, next iteration picks up remaining work

## Key Files Created During Runs

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `prd.json` | User's PRD with stories (copy from prd.json.example) |
| `progress.txt` | Append-only log of learnings |
| `.ralph-last-branch` | Tracks branch for archiving |
| `archive/` | Previous runs archived here |

## Modifying This Project

- **prompt.md**: Edit to customize agent behavior, add project-specific commands
- **ralph.sh**: Modify loop logic, add pre/post hooks
- **prd.json.example**: Update template for your use cases

## Patterns

- Each iteration is a fresh Copilot instance with clean context
- Memory persists only via: git history, `progress.txt`, `prd.json`
- Stories should be small enough to complete in one context window
- Always update progress.txt with learnings for future iterations
