# Q Entrepreneur OS

@q-system/AGENTS.md

## Project Structure
- `plugins/` - Plugin groups: kipi-core (every instance), kipi-ops (GTM), kipi-design (UI)
- `.Codex/agents/` - Custom agent definitions (preflight, data-ingest, synthesizer, etc.)
- `.Codex/rules/` - Path-scoped instruction files
- `q-system/` - Core OS (canonical/, marketing/, methodology/, output/, my-project/, memory/)

## Conventions
- Never produce fluff - every sentence must carry information or enable action
- Mark unvalidated claims with `{{UNVALIDATED}}` or `{{NEEDS_PROOF}}`
- All written output goes through the founder voice skill
- All actionable output follows AUDHD executive function rules (if enabled)
- No filler phrases ("leverage," "innovative," "cutting-edge," "game-changing")
- When something fails because an LLM misinterpreted instructions, the fix must be a deterministic script or code change
- A prompt or skill alone cannot enforce behavior. Enforcement requires a hook, script, test, validator, required check, or executable code. The `prompt-only-enforcement-guard.py` PostToolUse hook blocks prompt-only enforcement claims.
- For any task involving more than a single file edit, state the planned approach and wait for OK
- When fixing identified issues, fix exactly what was flagged. No scope expansion.
- Never read or search files outside the current project directory without stating which directory and why
- All product/system changes use the PRD template at `q-system/marketing/templates/prd.md`

## Commands
- `/q-morning` - Full morning briefing (9-phase agent pipeline)
- `/q-debrief` - Post-conversation extraction (highest priority)
- `/q-calibrate` - Update canonical files
- `/q-create` - Generate specific output (talk tracks, emails, slides, decks)
- `/q-plan` - Review and prioritize actions
- `/q-engage` - Social engagement mode
- `/q-market-*` - Marketing system commands
- `/q-draft` - Ad-hoc output generation
- `/q-wrap` - Evening health check
- `/q-handoff` - Session continuity
- `/q-research` - Anti-hallucination research mode
- `/wiring-check` - End-of-task gate: verify every change is connected end-to-end. Full rule in `.Codex/rules/wiring-check.md`
- `/say` - Synthesize the previous assistant response to a stable mp3 via OpenAI TTS. Autoplays locally in a new Terminal window (mpv) so your keys drive speed/seek/pause; over SSH, without mpv, or with `--no-play` it just prints the play command. Manual replay: `mpv ~/.config/kipi/say-last.mp3` (or `say-play`). Over SSH: `ssh <mini> 'cat ~/.config/kipi/say-last.mp3' | mpv -`. `/say stop` clears stray playback.

## Build and Test
- Build daily schedule: `python3 q-system/marketing/templates/build-schedule.py <json> <html>`
- Audit morning routine: `python3 q-system/.q-system/audit-morning.py q-system/output/morning-log-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Audit instruction budget: `python3 q-system/.q-system/scripts/instruction-budget-audit.py`
- Develop with plugins: `kipi dev` (loads all 3 plugin groups)
