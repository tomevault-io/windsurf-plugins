# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Development
deno task dev          # Run with file watch mode

# Testing
deno task test         # Run all tests (requires --expose-gc internally)
deno test -A --v8-flags="--expose-gc" test/<name>.test.ts          # Run a specific test file
deno test -A --v8-flags="--expose-gc" test/<name>.test.ts -f "name" # Run a single test by name

# Build
deno task build        # Compile src/ → dist/ and generate package.json

# Linting & formatting
deno lint
deno fmt               # Auto-format
deno fmt --check       # Check without modifying
```

## Architecture

`experimental-threads` is a concurrency library for Node.js, Deno, and Bun that
lets you run **inline closures** in Web Workers without separate entry files. It
uses static AST analysis to capture lexical scope and serialize it into a
self-contained worker script.

### Core flow

1. **`spawn(fn)`** (`src/lib/lib.ts`) is the main API. It:
   - Resolves the call site via stack trace parsing (`getCallSite()` in
     `src/lib/utils.ts`)
   - Reads the caller's source file and parses it with the TypeScript compiler
     API
   - Walks the AST to find free variables in `fn` (`analyzeScope()`)
   - Rewrites relative imports for the worker context (`patchImports()`)
   - Returns a `WorkerScript<T>` string (a branded string type) that encodes the
     worker bootstrap code
   - `eval(spawn(fn))` yields a `JoinHandle<T>`: thenable, `cancel()`
     (cooperative, fires the closure's `AbortSignal` via `Atomics.waitAsync` on
     a shared flag), `abort()` (terminates the worker), and async-iterable when
     `fn` is a generator (yields stream back as `yield` messages; the
     generator's return value resolves the handle)
   - `par(items, fn)` (same file) is a parallel map: chunks items across up to
     `hardwareConcurrency` workers via `__par_wrapper__`; `analyzeScope` finds
     the closure in argument 1 of `par` calls
   - `scope()` returns a `ThreadScope` (`await using`): handles spawned while
     open are tracked on a module-level stack and joined at dispose

2. **Worker pool**: workers are pooled by a signature derived from the captured
   variable set. Idle workers are terminated after 30 seconds. A warning fires
   if active workers exceed 4× hardware concurrency.

3. **Shared memory / `Shared<T>`** (`src/lib/primitives.ts`): wraps a
   `SharedArrayBuffer` identified by a location-based ID (`file:line:col`). The
   main thread registers buffers in a `GLOBAL_MEMORY` map; workers receive a
   hydration map so they reconstruct the same buffer references across V8
   isolates.

4. **Synchronization primitives** (`src/lib/primitives.ts`): `Mutex<T>`,
   `Semaphore`, `RwLock<T>`, `Condvar`, `WaitGroup`, `Once`, `OnceCell<T>`, and
   `Barrier` are built on `Atomics.wait`/`Atomics.notify`. `MutexGuard<T>`
   implements `Symbol.dispose` for RAII-style unlocking
   (`using guard = await mutex.lock()`) and carries a `mutex` backref for
   `Condvar.wait()`. `Channel<T>` is an MPMC channel over a SharedArrayBuffer
   ring buffer (JSON-serialized payloads, async + blocking-sync send/recv,
   `Channel.select`). All extend `SharedStruct` and self-register for
   cross-isolate hydration.

### Platform layers

- **`src/deno/`**: entry point for Deno; polyfills `Atomics.waitAsync` to keep
  the event loop alive
- **`src/node/`**: entry point for Node.js/Bun; wraps `node:worker_threads` in a
  Web Worker–compatible API and polyfills `WorkerGlobalScope`
- Both re-export everything from `src/lib/lib.ts` after loading their polyfill

### Build

`scripts/build.ts` uses the TypeScript compiler API with a custom transformer
that rewrites `.ts` import extensions to `.js`. It compiles `src/**/*.ts` to
`dist/` targeting ES2020/ESNext modules and generates a `package.json` with
platform-specific exports for Node, Deno, and Bun.

### Tests

Tests live flat in `test/` as `<name>.test.ts` files using `Deno.test()` (shared
helper modules are plain `.ts` files next to them). Tests that spawn workers
always call `shutdown()` in a `finally` block to drain the worker pool. The
`--expose-gc` V8 flag is required to allow explicit GC triggering in tests.

### TypeScript strictness

The project uses `strict: true` plus `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`,
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitReturns`, and `noImplicitOverride`. Lint
rules `no-explicit-any` and `no-unused-vars` are disabled.
