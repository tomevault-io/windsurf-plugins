This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SolTrader - A whale wallet intelligence system for Solana that monitors high-net-worth wallet activity to identify coordinated memecoin investment opportunities. The system detects coordinated buying patterns and generates trading signals.

## Goal

This project is about Solana Memecoin trading.
The idea is to watch a moderate number of specific wallets for open and close prositions
and when a number of wallets get into the same coin within a short time
this is probably a good trading opportunity 
(let's assume these guys know what they are doing because they are successful).
These wallets are owned by whales, kols, insideds, etc.
The number of wallets that should hold a position concurrently and the timeframe in which
they need to open their positions are configurable.

Whenever multiple wallets buy/swap the same coin, we will generate a BUY signal.
This signal shows the date-time, the wallets, the number of wallets and the size of each purchase and the price of the coin.
A signal is generated when 2, 3, 4, 5 and >5 wallets are in a coin at the same time.
So we can have 6 signals about the same coin purchase.
We will do the same for every close or sell and generate a SELL signal.
So, also here we can have a max of 6 SELL signals.


The system will generate paper trades for each signal and calculates the profit for each signal.
A few times a day, depending on how many of these signals were created, we give the paper trades
to one or more LLMs for analyses. The analyses should look at how many concurrent wallets generate the best results,
does the day and the time of day have any influence, is the purchase amount or combined amount of influence
and is the precense of certain wallets of influence.

From these analyses, the system should (re-)generate some rules that will determine when we will
actually engage in a real trade and with how much money.

## Modules

### wallet-watcher
This module will use one or more RPC services like Helius, Quicknode and others to subscribe to wallet changes.
It will maintain an in-memory list of purchased coins whereby it keeps a coin purchase in the list for as long as the timeframe
that is set by the frontend. After every wallet transaction there will be a count on wallets holding the same coin.
Depending on the outcome of the count a signal is generated. Signals are stored in the database where they will be picked up by the frontend.

### wallet-analyzer
This module will scan all the wallets for wallet to wallet transactions. The goal is to find related wallets.
Sometimes funds are moved to other wallets or wallets are funded from other wallets. If related wallets hold balances
They should be linked to eachother and participate in the watching.

### paper-trader
This module will act on a signal an open or close a papertrade.Papertrades are recorded in the database.

### signal-analyzer
This module will analyze a bunch of trades to find the optimal trading strategy.
The signal analyzer should look at optimal stop-loss and take-profit strategies with the help of the signal trader.

### signal-trader
This module will make real trades based on the rules set by the rule analyzer.
This module can also act as a trailing stop loss and trailing take profit actor.
The signal analyzer should look at optimal stop-loss and take-profit strategies.

## MCP Servers to use
Use context7 to search for documentation on Neon, Helius, Solana, Hono, HTMX and everything that you have trouble with getting things to work. Read more docs!
Use the Neon mcp server to get info on tables, views, functions, etc. You may also update table schemas if needed.


## Architecture

The platform uses a unified single-process architecture:

### Unified Server (`server.ts`)
- **Framework**: Hono web framework (lightweight, fast)
- **Frontend**: HTMX + Alpine.js + Pico CSS (NOT a SPA)
- **Backend Services**: 4 coordinated services in same process
- **Philosophy**: Server-side rendering, minimal client-side complexity
- **Runtime**: Bun-first but Node.js compatible

## Development Commands

### Unified Server Commands
```bash
# Development with auto-reload
bun run dev              # Unified server with watch mode

# Production
bun run start            # Production server  

# Building
bun run build            # Build for Bun runtime
bun run build:node       # Build for Node.js runtime

# Testing  
bun test                 # Run tests with Bun
npm run test             # Run tests (uses test database)
npm run test:watch       # Tests in watch mode

# Deployment
npm run deploy           # Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
```

## Testing

- **Framework**: Bun test runner with database integration tests
- **Database Testing**: Uses Neon test branches or test database
- **Single Test**: Use `bun test path/to/test.ts` or `npm run test -- path/to/test.ts`

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Unified Architecture**: Single process for simplicity and performance
2. **Runtime Agnostic**: Avoid Node-specific APIs (Bun/Node.js/Workers compatible)
3. **Database-First**: Neon PostgreSQL as single source of truth
