# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains code for control-arena, an open source library for AI Control experiments built on top of Inspect AI. It is built by the UK AI Security Institute.

Code can be found in `control_arena/`.
Docs can be found in `docs/`.
Also see `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more information.

## Build/Lint/Test Commands

- Run python code: `uv run path/to/script.py`
- Run all tests: `uv run pytest` or `uv run pytest -m "not skip_ci and no long_running"`
- Run a single test: `uv run pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py::test_function_name -v`
- Format code: `uv run ruff format`
- Lint code: `uv run ruff check --fix`
- Type check: `uv run pyright`

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Formatting**: Follow Google style convention. Use ruff for formatting. Try to follow ruff styles directly when writing code. You can see what rules we have enabled in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Imports**: Use isort order (enforced by ruff). Imports must be at the top of the file, unless there is a very good reason otherwise.
- **Types**: Strict typing is required. All functions must have type annotations
- **Naming**: Use snake_case for variables, functions, methods; PascalCase for classes
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings required for public APIs. These will be used for automatic documentation generation and so should be clear, easy to understand and complete.
- **Documentation**: This project uses Quarto for documentation. See `docs/` for examples. When adding new public APIs we may need to update the docs, including the automated API reference section in `docs/reference/`. Lists within .qmd files must be separated by a blank line from anything above, otherwise they will not render properly.
- **Spelling**: This project is built by the UK AI Security Institute, so use UK English spelling where relevant.
- **Error Handling**: Use appropriate exception types; include context in error messages. Use if / raise rather than assert for runtime checks.
- **Testing**: Write tests with pytest; maintain high coverage. No need to mark async tests with `pytest.mark.asyncio` as this is configured automatically. Use `pytest.mark.skip_ci` for tests that should not run in CI (e.g. because they call LLMs), and `pytest.mark.long_running` for tests that take a long time to run.
- **String Formatting**: Don't wrap lines manually unless they should explicitly be separated by a line break. Instead, put strings (e.g. docstrings) on one line so that they can be wrapped automatically by whatever editor is being used.
- **Async Code**: This project supports both asyncio and trio backends via anyio (configured by the `INSPECT_ASYNC_BACKEND` environment variable). **Do not use `asyncio` primitives directly.** Instead:
  - Use `anyio.sleep()` instead of `asyncio.sleep()`
  - Use `from control_arena._async_utils import gather` instead of `asyncio.gather()` / `asyncio.create_task()`
  - Use `from control_arena._async_utils import gather_with_exceptions` instead of `asyncio.gather(*coros, return_exceptions=True)`
  - Use `anyio.run(fn, backend=get_async_backend())` instead of `asyncio.run()` for sync-to-async entry points
  - Use `anyio.open_process()` instead of `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec()` (and catch `anyio.EndOfStream` when reading from process streams)
  - Use `anyio.to_thread.run_sync()` instead of `loop.run_in_executor()`
  - Use `anyio.fail_after()` instead of `asyncio.wait_for()`
  - Use `anyio.Semaphore()` instead of `asyncio.Semaphore()`
  - See `control_arena/_async_utils.py` for available utilities

## Git Conventions

- **Branch naming**: `<username>/<type>/<description>` in kebab-case (e.g. `alice/feat/add-new-setting`, `bob/fix/monitor-timeout`)
- **Commit messages**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) -- `<type>: <description>`. Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `test`. Use `!` for breaking changes (e.g. `feat!: Change sample ID format`).

Respect existing code patterns when modifying files. Run linting before committing changes.
