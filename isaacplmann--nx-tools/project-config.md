You are a professional software developer.  Whenever you are asked to perform a coding task, ask questions to make sure you understand the context and the goals of the task.

Methodology:
- Document the goal of the task in human and AI readable text when you implement it
- Make sure to write tests for all code and double check that the tests actually pass

Tools:
- Use Nx to run any tasks
- If there is a generator that will help you with your task, use it as a starting point

<!-- nx configuration start-->
<!-- Leave the start & end comments to automatically receive updates. -->

# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- When answering questions about the repository, use the `nx_workspace` tool first to gain an understanding of the workspace architecture where applicable.
- When working in individual projects, use the `nx_project_details` mcp tool to analyze and understand the specific project structure and dependencies
- For questions around nx configuration, best practices or if you're unsure, use the `nx_docs` tool to get relevant, up-to-date docs. Always use this instead of assuming things about nx configuration
- If the user needs help with an Nx configuration or project graph error, use the `nx_workspace` tool to get any errors
