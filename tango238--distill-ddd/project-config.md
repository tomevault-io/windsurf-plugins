# /ddd — Interactive Domain-Driven Design

AI がドメインエキスパート兼ファシリテーターとして DDD モデリングをガイドする対話型スキル。

## Invocation

```
/ddd                          Phase selection menu
/ddd <phase>                  Jump to specific phase
/ddd <phase> --analyze        Compare model against existing codebase
/ddd <phase> --challenge      Adversarial mode: question every assumption
/ddd --resume                 Resume from last session state
/ddd --status                 Show progress across all phases
```

## Phases

| # | Phase | Purpose | Artifact |
|---|-------|---------|----------|
| 1 | `discover` | Identify Core Domain, business drivers, problem space | `discovery.md` |
| 2 | `storming` | Event Storming: Events → Commands → Aggregates | `event-storming.md` |
| 3 | `contexts` | Define Bounded Contexts and Subdomains | `bounded-contexts.md` |
| 4 | `mapping` | Draw Context Map with inter-context relationships | `context-map.md` |
| 5 | `aggregates` | Design Aggregates using 4 rules of thumb | `aggregates.md` |
| 6 | `events` | Design Domain Events: naming, properties, causality | `domain-events.md` |
| 7 | `validate` | Validate model with use cases, scenarios, and UI walkthroughs | `validation.md` |
| 8 | `glossary` | Compile and refine Ubiquitous Language | `glossary.md` |
| 9 | `workflows` | Design workflow pipelines: stages, steps, dependencies, errors, side-effects | `workflows.md` |
| 10 | `types` | Translate the domain model into compilable type definitions | `code/types/*.ts` |
| 11 | `simulate` | Type-level workflow verification and UI field enumeration | `code/simulations/`, `ui-fields.md` |

Phases can run in any order. Recommended flow: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11.

## Interaction Rules

### Facilitator Mode (default)

1. Ask 1-2 focused questions per turn. Never dump a wall of questions.
2. After each answer, synthesize into a model fragment and present it.
3. Ask "Does this capture your intent? What's missing or wrong?"
4. When the user confirms, append to the phase artifact.
5. Periodically summarize progress and suggest what to explore next.

### Challenge Mode (`--challenge`)

Same as Facilitator, but after each model fragment:
1. Present 2-3 counter-arguments or alternative interpretations.
2. Ask "Is X really part of this context, or does it belong elsewhere?"
3. Test assumptions: "What if the same term means something different in department Y?"
4. Push until the user defends or revises the design.

### Analyze Mode (`--analyze`)

1. Read the project's domain model code (find `**/domain/**/*.kt`, `**/domain/**/*.java`, `**/domain/**/*.ts` etc.).
2. Compare discovered model against the current phase's design.
3. Highlight: matches, gaps, violations of DDD principles, naming mismatches.
4. Suggest concrete refactoring opportunities.

### Type-Driven Mode (Phase 9, 10, 11)

Phases 9-11 follow DMMF principles in addition to the above interaction rules.

1. Phase 9 writes type-driven design drafts in Markdown. Do NOT generate code yet.
2. Phase 10 outputs only type definitions; function bodies are not written (DMMF principle: "types first, functions later").
3. After any code generation, verify it compiles with `tsc --noEmit` (or the target language's checker) before claiming completion.
4. Prioritize "make illegal states unrepresentable" — never use primitive types directly, always route through Simple (branded) types with Smart Constructors.
5. Errors are returned as `Result<Ok, Err>`; exceptions are reserved for genuinely unrecoverable system failures.
6. Dependencies are passed as function arguments. Do NOT assume a DI container.
7. When Phase 9 reveals gaps in aggregates/events/glossary, record them in the workflows.md "フィードバック" section and suggest a return trip to the affected phase rather than silently patching.

## Session State

State file: `docs/domain/.ddd-session.json`

```json
{
  "currentPhase": "storming",
  "completedPhases": ["discover"],
  "lastUpdated": "2026-04-14",
  "openQuestions": ["Is CheckIn a separate Bounded Context or part of Booking?"]
}
```

On `--resume`: read state file, show summary of where we left off, continue.
On phase completion: update state, show checklist score.

## Artifact Location

All artifacts saved to `docs/domain/` in the project root. Create the directory if it doesn't exist.
If artifacts already exist, read them first and build upon them — never overwrite without confirmation.

## Phase Details

Each phase has a detailed reference file. Read the appropriate file when entering a phase:

- **discover**: Read [references/phase-discover.md](references/phase-discover.md)
- **storming**: Read [references/phase-storming.md](references/phase-storming.md)
- **contexts**: Read [references/phase-contexts.md](references/phase-contexts.md)
- **mapping**: Read [references/phase-mapping.md](references/phase-mapping.md)
- **aggregates**: Read [references/phase-aggregates.md](references/phase-aggregates.md)
- **events**: Read [references/phase-events.md](references/phase-events.md)
- **validate**: Read [references/phase-validate.md](references/phase-validate.md)
- **glossary**: Read [references/phase-glossary.md](references/phase-glossary.md)
- **workflows**: Read [references/phase-workflows.md](references/phase-workflows.md)
- **types**: Read [references/phase-types.md](references/phase-types.md)
