Orchestration: Combining Data Analysis, Generation, and Publishing

Communication between agents: In our setup, agents don’t directly “chat” with each other; instead the orchestrator script acts as the go-between, passing outputs as inputs to the next. In a more advanced implementation, one might use an event-driven architecture or message queue (RabbitMQ, Redis pub/sub, etc.). For instance, TrendScannerAgent could emit an event “TrendsUpdated” with data payload; ContentCreatorAgent listens for “TrendsUpdated” events and then runs. Given the complexity, a simpler chronological chain triggered by a scheduler is easier to start with. Another approach is leveraging frameworks for multi-agent orchestration like LangChain or Microsoft’s AutoGen​
MEDIUM.COM
, which allow multiple AI agents to communicate and coordinate. For example, you could have a “Manager” agent that asks TrendScanner for data, then passes it to ContentCreator, etc., in a conversational loop. This is cutting-edge and can be overkill for our scenario, but it’s worth noting that such patterns exist if we wanted the agents themselves to discuss (“TrendAgent, what’s hot today?” -> “ContentAgent, create posts for these topics.” -> “SchedulerAgent, when should we post them?”). In most cases, though, a deterministic script with API calls suffices. The workflow can be visualized in a timeline table:
Time (Daily Workflow)	Action	Agent/Process
08:00 AM	Fetch latest trends (hashtags, etc.)	TrendScannerAgent (API calls)
08:05 AM	Generate draft posts for Twitter, IG, LinkedIn based on trends and brand guidelines	ContentCreatorAgent (OpenAI GPT)
08:06 AM	Generate image for post (if needed)	Image Generator (Stable Diffusion API)
08:10 AM	Review or lightly edit content (optional human step)	–
08:15 AM	Schedule Twitter post for 10:00 AM, Instagram post for 10:30 AM, LinkedIn post for 12:00 PM (for example)	SchedulerAgent (scheduling)
10:00 AM	Post Twitter content via API	SchedulerAgent -> Twitter API
10:30 AM	Post Instagram content via API	SchedulerAgent -> IG API
12:00 PM	Post LinkedIn content via API	SchedulerAgent -> LinkedIn API
12:05 PM	Log all posted content details	SchedulerAgent (logging)
6:00 PM	(Maybe a second Twitter post if content available) Post via API	SchedulerAgent
Throughout day	Monitor for any @mentions or messages (could be EngagementAgent’s job if implemented)	–
Next day	Collect engagement stats (likes, comments) for yesterday’s posts (future improvement)	AnalyticsAgent (if implemented)
This table illustrates one cycle. The times can be adjusted based on actual optimal times found. Initially, we might start with 1 cycle per day; later, we could have multiple cycles (morning and afternoon content). Caching and Reuse: If TrendScannerAgent didn’t find anything new since the last run, the system might decide to reuse the previous Trend Report or simply not generate new content (to avoid redundancy). Similarly, ContentCreatorAgent might have generated a pool of posts (say 3 variations); SchedulerAgent could queue one for today, another for tomorrow, etc. Designing a content repository where generated ideas live until used can make the system more robust (so it’s not catastrophic if one day’s trend fetch fails – you still have content ideas from earlier). Concurrency considerations: If this system scales up (say posting 10 times a day), ensure that the API usage is within limits. The orchestrator could throttle calls or prioritize tasks. It’s wise to include slight random delays in posting to avoid a detectable pattern (platform algorithms sometimes demote overly mechanical posting patterns). In summary, the orchestration ties everything together: TrendScannerAgent informs ContentCreatorAgent, which produces content for SchedulerAgent, which in turn publishes and closes the loop with logging. This separation of concerns (analysis vs creation vs execution) follows best practices for multi-agent systems and ensures each component can be improved or debugged in isolation.
