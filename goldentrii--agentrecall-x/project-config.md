# AgentRecall — Codex Agent Instructions

AgentRecall gives you persistent memory across sessions. The only thing the human ever does is describe intent — loading and saving memory is invisible runtime machinery that YOU, the agent, must drive without being asked.

**This host (Codex, Cursor, or any raw MCP client) has no lifecycle hooks.** Claude Code auto-fires memory at session start/stop via hooks; here there is no such hook. That means: if you don't call these tools yourself, nothing loads and nothing saves — silently. This is non-negotiable, not a nice-to-have:

1. **ENTRY — ALWAYS, every session, not just on trigger phrases.** The moment a session resumes prior work, call `session_start` FIRST, before acting on anything else. Do not wait for the user to say "load my context" — that phrase (see trigger table below) is an *additional* signal, not the only permitted trigger.
2. **EXIT — ALWAYS, before you stop.** Before ending a turn/session where you did meaningful work, call `session_end` with a real summary. Do not wait for the user to say "save this" — that phrase is an *additional* durable-intent trigger, not a gate you wait behind. Saying it is not saving it: only the tool call saves it.
3. **DURABLE INTENT — call immediately, don't defer.** The moment you or the user says save / remember / checkpoint / 记住 / 保存, call `session_end` (or `remember` for a single fact) right then, not at some later "natural" stopping point.
4. `recall` and `check` are safe to call freely, any time, with no gating at all.

## Tool surface (verified against `packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts` + `tool-surface-purity.test.mjs`)

AgentRecall's real MCP surface is **5 tools by default**, **6 with `--full`**, **13 with `AR_EXTRAS=1 --full`** — not the 10-tool list this file used to describe. That old list mixed in four project-board/status and bootstrap-scan/import tools that were deleted from the MCP surface on 2026-07-05 (zero organic MCP use); their logic lives on in the CLI only, see the CLI-equivalents table below.

### Default (5) — always registered, every session

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `session_start` | Load project context — corrections, insights, watch_for warnings. Call at ENTRY, always. |
| `session_end` | Save journal, insights, trajectory. Call at EXIT, always, and on any durable-intent trigger. |
| `remember` | Write a single fact/decision — auto-routes to the right store. Durable-intent trigger. |
| `recall` | Search all memory — keyword/RRF fusion + optional vector. Safe to call any time. |
| `check` | Record understanding; anticipates the likely correction before you make it. Pass `action_description` before a risky action (publish/deploy/delete/credential/external-send) for a matching + `blocked`/`advisory` verdict. Safe to call any time. |

### `--full` adds (1 more, 6 total)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `check_action` | Pre-action safety matcher — warns on publish/push/deploy before you run them. |

### `AR_EXTRAS=1 --full` adds (7 more, 13 total) — quarantined, low-use

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `pipeline_open` | Open a new project narrative phase. |
| `pipeline_close` | Close active phase with reflection fields. |
| `pipeline_list` | List all narrative phases as JSON summaries. |
| `pipeline_current` | Return content of the currently active phase. |
| `pipeline_show` | Render project narrative spine — all phases. |
| `register_rule` | Save an IF-THEN behavior policy. |
| `digest` | Context cache — store/recall/read/invalidate pre-computed analysis. |

## Trigger Phrases → Actions

Trigger phrases below are **additional** signals for durable intent — they are not the only conditions under which you call these tools. `session_start` fires at session begin regardless of phrasing; `session_end` fires before you stop regardless of phrasing. The phrases below just make the *save/recall content* explicit when the user names it directly.

**Session begin (always, no trigger phrase required):**
> First action of every session that resumes prior work
→ Call `session_start(project="[slug or auto]")`
→ Show: project intention, last session summary, top insights, watch_for corrections

**Explicit load phrasing (reinforces the same call):**
> "load my context" / "what was I working on" / "load AgentRecall for [project]"
→ Call `session_start(project="[slug or auto]")`

**Session end / durable intent (always before stopping, no trigger phrase required):**
> Before ending any turn/session with meaningful work done
→ Call `session_end(summary="...", insights=[...], trajectory="...")`
→ Confirm: "Saved to ~/.agent-recall/projects/[slug]/journal/[date].md"

**Explicit save phrasing (reinforces the same call, call it NOW, don't defer):**
> "save this session" / "save to memory" / "wrap up" / "记住" / "保存"
→ Call `session_end(...)` immediately

**Recall specific knowledge (any time, no gating):**
> "recall [topic]" / "what do I know about [X]" / "any past notes on [X]"
→ Call `recall(query="[topic]")`
→ Show results inline

**Save a single fact (durable-intent trigger, call it NOW):**
