### Examples of Good vs Bad Usage:

**✅ GOOD - Read when needed:**
```
User: "Explain the CAP theorem"
→ Read docs/fundamentals/distributed-systems-fundamentals.md (section 1 only)

User: "How do I implement event sourcing?"
→ Read docs/phase2-architecture-patterns/event-driven-architecture.md (section 1)

User: "What's the Saga pattern?"
→ Read docs/phase2-architecture-patterns/event-driven-architecture.md (section 4)

User: "How do I implement caching?"
→ Read docs/phase3-scalability-performance/scalability-performance.md (section 1)

User: "When should I use MongoDB vs PostgreSQL?"
→ Read docs/phase4-data-management/data-management.md (section 1)

User: "Explain the Saga pattern for distributed transactions"
→ Read docs/phase4-data-management/data-management.md (section 2)
```

**❌ BAD - Don't read automatically:**
```
User: "How do I run the tests?"
→ Don't read any docs, this is a practical question

User: "Debug this error in the code"
→ Don't read theory docs, focus on debugging

User: "List all the files"
→ Don't include docs in file listing, they're reference materials
```

**Why?** These files are very large (~625 KB total) and contain educational content. They should only be loaded when genuinely needed for the current task to conserve tokens and improve response time.

## Notes & Learnings
(Document key insights, challenges, and solutions as you progress)

---

## Next Steps
1. Start with Phase 1: Review monolith limitations and identify decomposition boundaries
2. Set up your learning environment (Docker, local Kubernetes, cloud account)
3. Begin documenting your current system's architecture

**Remember:** System design is about trade-offs. There's no perfect solution, only solutions that fit specific requirements and constraints. Focus on understanding the "why" behind each pattern and practice making reasoned decisions.
