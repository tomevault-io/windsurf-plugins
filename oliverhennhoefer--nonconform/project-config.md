# v1 Compatibility Policy

This project has reached `v1.0.0`. Backward compatibility is now a constraint
for documented public APIs and statistical validity claims.

- Prefer additive public APIs over changing or removing existing public APIs.
- Treat `nonconform.__all__` and public module `__all__` exports as compatibility
  contracts.
- Keep `nonconform._internal` private and out of user-facing docs/examples.
- Breaking public API changes require a major-version plan, migration notes, and
  explicit release documentation.
- Statistical-core behavior changes require explicit before/after rationale and
  validation evidence.

# Decision Hierarchy

1. Statistical correctness and validity claims.
2. User intent and acceptance criteria.
3. Architecture clarity and long-term design quality.
4. Maintainability and readability.
5. Performance.

# Execution Defaults

- Ask questions only for contradictions, missing critical requirements, or destructive/irreversible risk.
- Enforce strict no-scope-creep: do only what is requested and directly necessary.
- Assume declared dependencies are available; do not redesign around hypothetical missing dependencies.
- Do not run `uv update` lightly; it can override intentionally pinned security patch versions in this repository.
- Treat current CI trigger and test-run cadence as intentional; do not suggest changing it unless explicitly requested by the user.

# Statistical-Core Change Guardrail

Statistical-core means any logic that computes statistics or affects statistical validity/interpretation (for example p-values, FDR control, weighting, calibration, aggregation, or related quantities).

- Do **not** change statistical-core behavior unless the user request explicitly asks for it or it is an unavoidable implication of the requested change.
- Statistical-core behavior changes should be rare.
- If such a change is needed, provide explicit before/after rationale in the final report.

# Regression Policy

- Target zero regressions by default.
- Any intentional regression/tradeoff is allowed only when directly requested or logically required by the task.
- Every intentional tradeoff must be called out explicitly with rationale.

# Validation Policy

No substantial task is complete without validation evidence.

- Run `uv run pytest` when changes touch `nonconform/**` or `tests/**`.
- Skip full `pytest` when changes are limited to:
  - Markdown-only (`*.md`) files, or
  - Python files outside `nonconform/**` and `tests/**` (e.g. `examples/**`).
- Run `uv run ruff format .` for every task.
- Run `uv run ruff check . --fix` for every task.
- Run `uv run mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml` whenever documentation changes under `docs/**`.
- Run narrower tests while iterating, then finish with full `pytest`.

# Codebase Topology

- `nonconform/`: public library code.
- `nonconform/_internal/`: private internals, not user API.
- `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`: layered validation.
- `examples/`: user-facing executable usage.
- `docs/` + `docs/source/`: canonical documentation.

# API and Architecture Discipline

- Keep boundaries explicit across detector interfacing, strategy, estimation, weighting, FDR, and metrics.
- Avoid hidden coupling and dead abstractions.
- Make API surface changes explicit and intentional.
- Keep `_internal` out of user-facing docs/examples.

# Documentation and Examples 

- Behavioral/API changes require documentation updates.
- User-facing changes require example updates.
- Do not leave docs/examples stale relative to implementation.

# Changelog Policy

- Keep root `CHANGELOG.md` limited to release-relevant changes for package
  users: public API, behavior, statistical claims, packaging/distribution,
  dependencies/security, deprecations, and removals.
- Do not add changelog entries for changes limited to docs, examples, tests,
  CI, tooling, or repository maintenance unless they affect the released
  package.
- Follow Keep a Changelog categories, keep `[Unreleased]` first, avoid raw
  git-log dumps, and use `Security` for vulnerability/security dependency fixes.

# Definition of Done

A task is done only when all are true:

- Requested behavior is implemented end-to-end.
- Validation completed with command-level evidence.
- No unintended regressions detected.
- Docs/examples/tests are aligned with the final behavior.
- Scope remained constrained to the requested task.

# Final Report Contract

For substantial tasks, always include:

- What changed.
- Why this approach.
- Validation performed (exact commands).
- Intentional tradeoffs/regressions (if any).
- Statistical-core change rationale in before/after form (required when applicable).
- Residual risks or assumptions.
