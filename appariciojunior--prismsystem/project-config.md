# Design System - AI Agent Instructions

This file is intentionally concise for prompt efficiency.

Canonical deep references (read when needed):

- `packages/tokens/.agents/skills/README.md`
- `packages/tokens/.agents/skills/governance/constraint-reference.md`
- `packages/tokens/DESIGN_SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md`
- `packages/tokens/styleguide.md`

## First Prompt Bootstrap (Once Per Day)

Before any substantial work on first prompt of the day, run:

```bash
# 1) Sync repo
git fetch origin main && git pull origin main --rebase 2>/dev/null || echo "Offline mode"

# 2) Quick status
echo "=== DAILY BOOTSTRAP ===" && \
git log --oneline -3 && \
echo "=== TODO STATE ===" && \
head -30 packages/tokens/.agents/TODO_STATE.md
```

Then read: `packages/tokens/.agents/TODO_STATE.md` and `packages/tokens/.agents/skills/governance/constraint-reference.md`.

Skip bootstrap only if user says `skip bootstrap` or `continue from last session`.

## Architecture Invariants

- Token architecture is 3-layer: Foundation -> Palette -> Semantic.
- Semantic tokens must reference Palette, never Foundation.
- `packages/tokens/src/tokens.json` is the Token Studio source of truth.
- Never modify `$themes` or any `$figma*` metadata unless explicitly human-approved.
- Do not edit `tokens.json` to fix output/render issues; investigate build scripts in `packages/output/src/scripts/` first.

## Dark Mode Critical Rule

Neutral ramps are reversed in dark mode:

- Light mode: `neutral.50` is white, `neutral.1000` is black.
- Dark mode: `neutral.50` is black, `neutral.1000` is white.

Always verify actual hex in `packages/tokens/data/ramp-colors-reference.csv` before deciding dark mappings.

## Governance Gates

- Foundation edits require explicit human approval and `foundation-change` governance path.
- Palette edits require explicit approval (`palette/approval`) and design owner sign-off.
- For semantic-only scope, do not change foundation or palette layers.
- If scope is ambiguous, stop and ask one concise clarifying question.

## tokens.json Edit Rules

When explicitly asked to edit `packages/tokens/src/tokens.json`:

- Change only intended token `value`/`description` fields.
- Keep font weights as strings (for Figma export), not numeric values.
- Validate JSON immediately:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool packages/tokens/src/tokens.json > /dev/null
```

## Verification Commands

Use these after token-affecting changes:

```bash
npm run build:output
npm run test:output
```

If the workflow requires it, also run:

```bash
python3 packages/tokens/scripts/verify_tag_updates.py
```

## Documentation Boundary

Keep token documentation under `packages/tokens/`. Do not create token docs elsewhere.

## Agent Brief Size Limit

All files in `packages/tokens/.agents/briefs/` must stay at or below 150 lines. Keep briefs concise and push deep workflow detail into skills under `packages/tokens/.agents/skills/`.

## Skills Path

Canonical skills live in `packages/tokens/.agents/skills/` and are synced to:

- `.github/skills/tokens`
- `.cursor/skills`
- `.claude/skills`
- `.codex/skills`

Avoid duplicating long instruction blocks across tool-specific files.

## Token MCP Fast Path

- Prefer `ds-tokens-mcp` for token discovery before broad file scans.
- Use `search_tokens` for intent-first lookup, then `token_lookup` for exact path/value confirmation.
- Use `audit_design_system` when evaluating quality/risk across token groups.
- `packages/tokens/src/tokens.json` remains the source of truth.

## Token Reference Query Contract (MCP-Only, Deterministic)

For requests that are explicitly reference-only (for example "suggest tokens", "which token should I use", "token reference", "no implementation"), use this strict output contract:

1. Retrieval path must be MCP-only fast path.
2. If the intent is about a component or interaction pattern (for example modal, drawer, onboarding flow, paywall), query Mobbin MCP first to ground the response in real shipped patterns.
3. Do not use non-MCP validation fallback for these requests.
4. Output must be table-only and grouped by application area in this exact order:
   - Fill
   - Border
   - Icon
   - Text
   - Other
5. Table columns must be exactly:
   - Semantic Token
   - Description
6. Rows must be deterministically sorted alphabetically by semantic token path within each group.
7. If MCP results are partial or noisy, retry MCP with a narrower intent once and a scoped token-type filter once.
8. If still partial, return best available grouped tables and add a single line:
   - `Data Quality: MCP partial match. Tokens listed are highest-confidence semantic references for this intent.`

This contract is mandatory for all agents responding to token reference queries.

## Component Docs Fast Path

Component docs are indexed in Docmancer and readable via explicit file pointers. Use both layers:

- **Discovery (unknown component):** `docmancer query "<intent>"` — finds the right component doc without knowing the file path. 238 sections indexed across 12 components.
- **Direct read (known component):** `read_file packages/tokens/docs/components/<name>/<Name>.md` — load the full spec immediately. See `packages/tokens/docs/components/README.md` for the canonical read-order list.
