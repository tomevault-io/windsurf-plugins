# AtCoder NoviSteps

A web service for tracking submissions on AtCoder and other competitive programming sites, which are graded by difficulty (Q11-D6).

## Guidelines

Always prefer simplicity over pathological correctness. YAGNI, KISS, DRY. No backward-compat shims or fallback paths unless they come free without adding cyclomatic complexity.

**When implementing:**

1. Use `/writing-plans` to generate a phased plan (lower risk → higher risk order). Store the plan at `docs/dev-notes/YYYY-MM-DD/{task-name-en}/plan.md`. Split into `phase-N.md` files when the plan exceeds 200 lines or has 5+ phases. Each plan must include: overview, design rationale, rejected alternatives, and a per-phase summary. Write plans in Japanese; source code comments in English. Verify each task before starting:
   - Which layer? (prisma / server / zod / types / fixtures / services / utils / stores / routes / components) — split if 2+ layers
   - Single responsibility: one purpose per task
   - Existing util/service/type? Search before creating
   - Test name: state it in the task description
2. Before writing a new function, search `src/lib/utils/`, `src/lib/services/`, `src/features/*/utils/` and `src/features/*/services/` for existing implementations; extract shared logic there when it appears in 2+ places
3. Write tests first, then implement production code, then verify with `pnpm test:unit`
4. Review critically after implementing: flag YAGNI violations, over-abstraction, missing tests
5. After all phases complete (feature and refactor branches only — not hotfixes or dependency bumps): run a mandatory refactor cycle. Write to `plan.md`: novel lessons (implementation blockers, non-obvious patterns not already in rules) and remaining tasks. Discard `phase-N.md` files. Run `coderabbit review --plain`; write all findings of `critical` / `high` / `potential_issue` (medium) to a `## CodeRabbit Findings` section in `plan.md`. The user decides which to fix before opening a PR; do not fix any finding unilaterally. `nitpick` findings defer to PR CI.
6. Run `/session-close` at the end of feature and refactor branches (not hotfixes, deps bumps, or single-session fixes): updates plan checklist, proposes rule/skill additions, checks for bloat, and detects repeated instructions

**Plan Approval ≠ Implementation Start:** Generating a plan (`/writing-plans`) does NOT authorize implementation. Always:

- Wait for explicit user consent ("let's start", "implement", etc.)
- Use AskUserQuestion before starting if requirements are ambiguous (data model, preferences, test scope, etc.)

## Working with the User

### Communication

- **No social pleasantries:** Skip opening remarks like "お疲れ様です", "了解しました", "ありがとうございます"
- **Direct & concise:** Lead with substance (findings, next steps, decisions)
- **Task-focused:** Avoid flattery, apologizing, or performative agreement
- **Respect the work:** Speak plainly about tradeoffs and real issues; don't sugar-coat

### Responding to Feedback

- **Verify before accepting:** Check for misunderstanding, missing context, or counterpoints
- **Question, don't defer:** Ask clarifying questions or offer alternatives with reasoning—don't blindly follow

### Critical Review as Default

When proposing approaches, designs, or solutions:

- **Lead with the proposal:** State the recommendation clearly
- **Then critique it:** Point out tradeoffs, risks, limitations, and when it fails
- **Offer alternatives:** Present 2–3 viable options with reasoning for each
- **Let user decide:** Don't pretend one option is obviously best if it isn't

## Tech Stack

SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 (Runes) + TypeScript | PostgreSQL + Prisma | Flowbite Svelte + Tailwind 4 | Vitest + Playwright | oxlint (JS/TS) + ESLint (Svelte)

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start dev server (localhost:5174)
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm test             # Run all tests
pnpm test:unit        # Vitest unit tests
pnpm test:e2e         # Playwright E2E tests
pnpm coverage         # Report test coverage
pnpm lint             # Prettier + oxlint (JS/TS) + ESLint (.svelte) check
pnpm format           # Prettier format
pnpm check            # Svelte type check
pnpm exec prisma generate           # Generate Prisma client
pnpm exec prisma migrate dev --name # Create migration (with description)
pnpm db:seed          # Seed database
```
