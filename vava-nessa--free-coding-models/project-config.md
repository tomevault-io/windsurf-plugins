# Agent Instructions

## Post-Feature Testing

After completing any feature or fix, the agent MUST:

1. Run `pnpm test` to verify all unit tests pass (62 tests across 11 suites)
2. If any test fails, fix the issue immediately
3. Re-run `pnpm test` until all tests pass
4. Run `pnpm start` to verify there are no runtime errors
5. If there are errors, fix them immediately
6. Re-run `pnpm start` until all errors are resolved
7. Only then consider the task complete

This ensures the codebase remains in a working state at all times.

## Release Process (MANDATORY)

When releasing a new version, follow this exact process:

1. **Version Check**: Check if version already exists with `git log --oneline | grep "^[a-f0-9]\+ [0-9]"`
2. **Version Bump**: Update version in `package.json` (e.g., `0.1.16` → `0.1.17`)
3. **Commit ALL Changed Files**: `git add . && git commit -m "0.1.17"`
   - Always commit with just the version number as the message (e.g., "0.1.17")
   - Include ALL modified files in the commit (bin/, src/, test/, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.)
4. **Push**: `git push origin main` — GitHub Actions will auto-publish to npm
5. **Wait for npm Publish":
   ```bash
   for i in $(seq 1 30); do sleep 10; v=$(npm view free-coding-models version 2>/dev/null); echo "Attempt $i: npm version = $v"; if [ "$v" = "0.1.17" ]; then echo "✅ published!"; break; fi; done
   ```
5. **Install and Verify**: `npm install -g free-coding-models@0.1.17`
6. **Test Binary**: `free-coding-models --help` (or any other command to verify it works)
7. **Only when the global npm-installed version works → the release is confirmed**

**Why:** A local `npm install -g .` can mask issues because it symlinks the repo. The real npm package is a tarball built from the `files` field — only a real npm install will catch missing files.

## Real-World npm Verification (MANDATORY for every fix/feature)

**Never trust local-only testing.** `pnpm start` runs from the repo and won't catch missing files in the published package. Always run the full npm verification:

1. Bump version in `package.json` (e.g. `0.1.14` → `0.1.15`)
2. Commit and push to `main` — GitHub Actions auto-publishes to npm
3. Wait for the new version to appear on npm:
   ```bash
   # Poll until npm has the new version
   for i in $(seq 1 30); do sleep 10; v=$(npm view free-coding-models version 2>/dev/null); echo "Attempt $i: npm version = $v"; if [ "$v" = "NEW_VERSION" ]; then echo "✅ published!"; break; fi; done
   ```
4. Install the published version globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g free-coding-models@NEW_VERSION
   ```
5. Run the global binary and verify it works:
   ```bash
   free-coding-models
   ```
6. Only if the global npm-installed version works → the fix is confirmed

**Why:** A local `npm install -g .` can mask issues because it symlinks the repo. The real npm package is a tarball built from the `files` field — if something is missing there, only a real npm install will catch it.

## Test Architecture

- Tests live in `test/test.js` using Node.js built-in `node:test` + `node:assert` (zero deps)
- Pure logic functions are in `src/utils.js` (extracted from the main CLI for testability)
- The main CLI (`bin/free-coding-models.js`) imports from `src/utils.js`
- If you add new pure logic (calculations, parsing, filtering), add it to `src/utils.js` and write tests
- If you modify existing logic in `src/utils.js`, update the corresponding tests

### What's tested:
- **sources.js data integrity** — model structure, valid tiers, no duplicates, count consistency
- **Core logic** — getAvg, getVerdict, getUptime, filterByTier, sortResults, findBestModel
- **CLI arg parsing** — all flags (--best, --fiable, --opencode, --openclaw, --tier)
- **Package sanity** — package.json fields, bin entry exists, shebang, ESM imports

## GitHub Contributors

When new PRs are merged, add the contributor's GitHub handle to the footer in `bin/free-coding-models.js` (the `Contributors:` line near line 775), separated by spaces. Also update this list:

- @whit3rabbit
- @PhucTruong-ctrl

## Testing the TUI with agent-tui

The project's TUI is built with raw ANSI escape codes + chalk. To visually test TUI behavior, use **agent-tui** — a PTY-based TUI automation tool that lets the AI agent spawn, screenshot, and interact with the terminal app.

### Setup

`agent-tui` is installed as a devDependency (`pnpm add -D agent-tui`). All commands run through `npx agent-tui`.

**One-time:** Start the daemon before any TUI testing session:

```bash
npx agent-tui daemon start
```

### Core Commands

All commands below use `npx agent-tui <command>`. The daemon manages sessions in the background.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `npx agent-tui run --cols 120 --rows 40 -- node bin/free-coding-models.js` | Spawn the TUI in a virtual terminal |
| `npx agent-tui run -- node /full/path/to/bin/free-coding-models.js --tier S` | Spawn with CLI flags (use full path) |
| `npx agent-tui screenshot` | Capture current screen as text |
| `npx agent-tui screenshot --strip-ansi` | Capture screen without ANSI colors |
| `npx agent-tui screenshot --json` | Capture as JSON (includes session_id) |
| `npx agent-tui press T` | Send a key press |
| `npx agent-tui press ArrowDown ArrowDown Enter` | Send multiple keys |
