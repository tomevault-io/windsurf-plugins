💳 Bank Offer Bookmarklet Factory: Dev Blueprint

🎯 Project Goal
Build and maintain a suite of JavaScript bookmarklets that automate "Activate All" functionality for credit card merchant offers using a Python + Playwright + Gemini-CLI feedback loop.

🛠️ The 2026 Tech Stack
|Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|Automation Engine | Playwright (Python) | Navigation, Shadow DOM piercing, and session persistence.|
|AI Intelligence | Gemini-CLI | DOM analysis, selector repair, and logic refactoring.|
|Logic Layer | Python 3.11+ | Orchestrates browser, file-watching, and AI prompting.|
|Script Format | IIFE (JavaScript) | Ensures isolation within bank portals.|

🏆 Chase v4.5 Feature Set (Current Stable)
The Chase activator has evolved into a robust "Smart Activator" with the following capabilities:
- **AI Smart Learning Mode:** Allows the user to "teach" the script by clicking 2 sample buttons. It then learns the CSS selector and card container pattern dynamically.
- **Turbo DOM Scraper:** A hybrid speed approach that scans the card face for expiration info first, only waiting for the side-drawer if data is missing.
- **Date Calculation Engine:** Converts relative Chase terms like "3d left", "Last day", and "Expiring soon" into standardized `YYYY-MM-DD` formats based on the system date.
- **Navigation Interceptor:** Overrides `history.pushState` during activation to prevent the Single Page App (SPA) from redirecting the user away from the offers list.
- **Interactive HUD:** A dark-themed floating UI that displays real-time progress, success/fail counters, and provides mode-selection buttons.
- **CSV Export:** Generates a detailed report with Merchant Name, Expiration Date (formatted), Offer Details, and Activation Method.

🏆 Amex v3.7 Feature Set (Current Stable)
The Amex activator uses a "Structural Precision" strategy to handle complex nested DOM elements:
- **Smart Trait-Based Learning (3-Click Triangulation):** User clicks 3 different offers to train the engine. It triangulates shared Aria labels, titles, and framework-specific CSS classes.
- **Intelligent Ancestry Engine:** Scans the DOM tree up from the clicked button to identify the reliable repeating card container (using class scoring).
- **Double-Pass Scrape:** Captures expiration data both before clicking and 800ms after clicking (when Amex often reveals countdowns like "3d left").
- **Integrated Autoscroll:** Automatically handles lazy-loading by scrolling the page to ensure all offers are injected into the DOM before scanning begins.
- **Date Calculation Engine:** Same as Chase, standardizing all terms to `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **API Deprioritization:** Reverted to a high-speed "Turbo DOM" approach due to Amex's aggressive CORS blocking and complex telemetry headers (ruxitagentjs).
- **CSV Export:** Unified schema matching the Chase version for cross-bank reporting.

🏆 Citi v2.4 Feature Set (Current Stable)
The Citi activator combines a high-speed API layer with a resilient "Ghost Stealth" DOM fallback:
- **API-First Bulk Activation:** Directly calls Citi's gcgapi endpoints to enroll all available offers across multiple cards in seconds.
- **Session Header Auto-Extraction:** Dynamically parses essential headers (TMXSessionId, client_id, etc.) from active session cookies.
- **Ghost Stealth Mode:** For DOM fallback, suppresses all CSS transitions and uses a MutationObserver to instantly nuke Citi's aggressive modal overlays.
- **Smart 3-Click Triangulation:** Uses a 3-sample training mode to precisely identify card containers and activation buttons.
- **Multi-Card CSV Reporting:** Automatically splits reports into separate files per physical card for easier reconciliation.

🚦 Differentiation StrategyTo manage multiple banks (Chase, Amex, Citi) without code collisions, we use a Strategy Pattern.
1. The "Universal Loader" (JS Level)Instead of five bookmarks, use one "Router" bookmarklet that detects the domain and fetches the correct logic.
    - How: Checks window.location.hostname.
    - Benefit: One click regardless of which bank portal you are currently viewing.

2. The "Bank Key" Mapping (Python Level)
The Python orchestrator treats each bank as a unique configuration object.
```# Python # Internal Logic Example
BANKS = {
    "amex": {"url": "amex.com/offers", "auth": "auth/amex.json", "src": "src/amex.js"},
    "chase": {"url": "chase.com/offers", "auth": "auth/chase.json", "src": "src/chase.js"},
    "citi": {"url": "citi.com/merchantoffers", "auth": "auth/citi.json", "src": "src/citi.js"}
}
```
3. The "Gemini Context" (AI Level)
When prompting Gemini-CLI for fixes, always prefix with the Bank Key.Prompt: "Working on the [AMEX] strategy. The selector #offer-stack is missing. Here is the HTML..."

📊 Data Standards: Universal CSV Schema
To ensure cross-bank compatibility and easy data merging, all bank portal activators must export CSVs following this standardized 7-column schema. This applies to all current and future implementations:

| Column | Requirement | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Card Kind** | Optional | The product name or nickname of the card. | `"Citi Double Cash"` |
| **Card Suffix** | Optional | The last 4 digits of the card account. | `"1234"` |
