# NFLDrafter - Fantasy Football Open Scorer
# Cursor Rules for Development

## Project Overview
This is a local-first fantasy football scoring application with the ability to swap to Postgres later. The app provides custom scoring profiles, player analysis, and news integration for fantasy football drafting and analysis.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS, Recharts
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2.x (async with aiosqlite), httpx
- **Database**: SQLite (WAL mode) with FTS5 for news search
- **ETL**: Typer CLI + APScheduler, pandas, nfl_data_py
- **Authentication**: Yahoo OAuth (3-legged) with Authlib

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)
- Use Python 3.9+ features and type hints
- Follow FastAPI best practices with async/await patterns
- Use SQLAlchemy 2.x async syntax with proper session management
- Implement proper error handling and validation with Pydantic
- Use dependency injection for database sessions and external services
- Follow PEP 8 with 88-character line limit (use black formatter)
- Use ruff for linting and mypy for type checking

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use TanStack Query for server state management
- Follow React hooks best practices
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes consistently
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for API responses

### Database
- Use SQLite with WAL mode enabled for performance
- Implement proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- Use FTS5 for full-text search on news content
- Follow SQLAlchemy best practices for async operations
- Implement proper foreign key constraints and relationships

## Key Development Guidelines

### API Design
- Use RESTful endpoints with consistent naming
- Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Implement rate limiting for external API calls
- Use proper authentication middleware for protected routes

### Data Models
- Players: Core player information with cross-platform IDs
- PlayerWeekStats: Normalized weekly statistics (long format)
- ScoringProfiles: Custom scoring rule sets
- ScoringRules: Individual scoring rules with multipliers and bonuses
- NewsItems: RSS feed content with player associations

### Scoring Engine
- Implement flexible scoring rules with multipliers, bonuses, and caps
- Support per-unit scoring (e.g., 0.1 points per yard)
- Handle bonus thresholds and maximum point caps
- Ensure scoring calculations are deterministic and testable

### ETL Processes
- Use nfl_data_py for player data and weekly statistics
- Implement idempotent data ingestion with upsert patterns
- Handle data validation and cleaning during ingestion
- Support historical data loading for multiple seasons

### Security Considerations
- Store OAuth secrets in environment variables
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper CORS policies for local development

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for scoring engine with known snapshots
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Performance tests for scoring calculations (<50ms per profile)
- Data validation tests for ETL processes

## Performance Requirements
- Scoring calculations should complete in under 50ms per profile
- Database queries should use proper indexing
- Frontend should implement virtualization for large data sets
- News search should use FTS5 for fast text queries

## Development Workflow
1. Set up local environment with SQLite database
2. Seed player data and historical statistics
3. Implement scoring profiles and rules
4. Build player explorer and news integration
5. Add Yahoo OAuth for league integration
6. Implement advanced features (tiering, watchlists, ADP)

## Code Quality
- Use ruff for Python linting and formatting
- Use black for consistent Python code formatting
- Use mypy for type checking
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write clear docstrings and comments
- Follow consistent naming conventions

## Future Considerations
- Design for easy migration from SQLite to Postgres
