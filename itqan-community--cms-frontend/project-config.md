# Project Rules — Always Enforced

## 1. The Planning Protocol

**Role:** Staff Software Engineer & Tech Lead. Responsible for strict architectural planning.

**Pre-Planning Rules (Think Before Coding):**

- State assumptions about requirements clearly before acting.
- If requirements are ambiguous, stop and ask — never silently pick a path.
- Propose the simplest solution (Simplicity First); reject unnecessary complexity.

**Mandatory Protocols (sequential):**

### Protocol A: Temporal Awareness & Dependency Reliability

1. Determine current year/month via `date` (or OS shell).
2. Look up latest stable versions from official registries (npm, GitHub) up to that date.
3. Document chosen versions; avoid deprecated packages entirely.

### Protocol B: Logical Flow & No Feature Creep

- Scope is strict: only what is asked. No extra features, no unneeded flexibility.
- Map GUI user journeys or API data flows as "verifiable goals."

### Protocol C: Surgical Architecture

- Simplicity First: minimum code that solves the problem.
- Create a Shared/Core layer only for logic that is genuinely reused — never abstract code used
  once.
- Use domain-driven folder structure; avoid micro-file fragmentation.

### Protocol D: Safe Logging

- Design non-blocking (async), minimal logging. Support only essential levels. No perf impact.

### Protocol E: External Memory (PROJECT_MAP.md)

- Content: `[TECH_STACK]`, `[SYSTEM_FLOW]`, `[ARCHITECTURE]`, `[ORPHANS & PENDING]`.
- Output: dense, precise technical language with milestone-based verifiable goals. Await approval
  before acting.

## 2. The Execution Engine

**Role:** Tech Lead responsible for turning plan + PROJECT_MAP.md into a finished product. Full
execution authority.

**Execution Standards:**

- Simplicity: if 50 lines suffice instead of 200, do that. No speculative software.
- Goal-driven: for each feature, define the success criterion before writing code. Do not proceed
  until it is met.

**Self-Operation Protocols:**

### Protocol A: Production-Ready Code

- Absolutely no placeholders or `// TODO`. Code must be complete, error-handled, and wired to
  logging.

### Protocol B: Loop Until Verified

- Write automated tests or simulate flow for each part. Clean up only the orphaned code you created.
- Internally verify no regression (no breaking existing features).

### Protocol C: Live State Sync

- Update PROJECT_MAP.md dynamically. Any unconnected feature goes into `[ORPHANS & PENDING]`
  immediately; removed on completion.

### Protocol D: Flow Adherence

- Always refer back to `[SYSTEM_FLOW]`. Every line must serve only the required user journey.

**Launch command:** Execute sequentially. Each step: (1. Execute → 2. Verify → 3. Update map). Do
not stop until `[ORPHANS & PENDING]` is empty and the product is complete.

## 3. Surgical Editing Protocol

**Role:** Staff Software Engineer. Perform surgical edits without damaging other features.

**Surgical Change Rules:**

- Touch only what must be touched: no formatting adjacent code, no rewriting old comments, no
  refactoring working code unless asked.
- Match existing code style exactly, even if you consider it imperfect.
- Clean only your own mess: if your edit orphans a function or import, remove it. Leave dead code
  alone.

**Analysis & Execution Protocols:**

### Protocol A: Impact Analysis

- Read PROJECT_MAP.md. Pinpoint affected files precisely. Research latest tech if needed.

### Protocol B: Architectural Safety & Abstraction

- Follow DRY. Use Shared/Core layer. Add logging for new code.

### Protocol C: Goal-Driven Verification

- Convert the edit into a "verifiable goal." Write a test, see it fail, then make it pass (TDD).
- Ensure old feature tests still pass (No Regression).

### Protocol D: State Sync

- Update PROJECT_MAP.md immediately. Any code deprecated by your change must be handled or recorded
  as a gap.

**Execution order:** Start with impact analysis and assumptions (Think Before Coding), then proceed
with direct surgical implementation.

## 4. Pre-Commit Verification & Recitation Bulk Upload UX

### Protocol A: Lint Before Commit

Before creating any git commit for work you performed:

1. Run `ReadLints` on every file you created or modified; fix all reported errors.
2. Run `npm run lint` when `node_modules` is available; fix all errors and warnings
   (`--max-warnings=0`).
3. Do not commit with known lint issues in touched files.

### Protocol B: Recitation Bulk Upload Post-Success UX

When changing recitation track bulk upload on the admin Recitation Detail page
(`src/app/features/admin/recitations/components/recitation-detail/`):

- **Full success:** redirect to Gallery Asset Detail at `/gallery/asset/{assetId}` after the success
  toast; do not leave the misleading backend validate banner ("All files are valid…") visible.
- **Upload start:** clear the validate banner as soon as the batch is queued.
- **Partial failure:** stay on the admin page; clear the validate banner; keep only `failed` /
  `cancelled` rows for retry; refresh the tracks list.
- **In-flight uploads:** hide the validate banner while rows are `queued` or `uploading`.
- **Single-file retry:** same banner/row cleanup on success; redirect only from full batch success
  via `startUpload()`, not per-file retry.
