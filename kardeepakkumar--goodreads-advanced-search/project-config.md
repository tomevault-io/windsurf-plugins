## What this is

A genre-first book discovery app built on Goodreads shelf data. Users filter books by genre combinations, rating, and text search. Data is scraped from Goodreads and stored in MongoDB Atlas. There is no public-facing write surface — all scraping is admin-only.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 15** App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (dark-only)
- **MongoDB Atlas** M0 free tier — strict JSON Schema validators on all collections
- **iron-session v8** for admin auth (encrypted cookie)
- **Atlas Search** for full-text + wildcard search and genre facets
- **cheerio + axios** for scraping Goodreads shelf pages

## Key architectural decisions

**Two-path API in `/api/books`**: no text query → plain MongoDB aggregation; text query present → Atlas Search pipeline. Do not merge these paths.

**Background scraper via `instrumentation.ts`**: the ticker loop starts on server boot, runs independently of the browser. On Vercel serverless this dies between invocations — documented limitation. Do not add client-side tick loops back.

**In-memory log buffer on `global`**: `autoTicker.ts` stores logs in `global.__scraperLogs` so the array is shared across Next.js module instances. The API route imports the same reference. This is intentional — do not move it to module-level state.

**Genre insertion order in UI**: `activeOrder` state in `GenrePanel.tsx` preserves the order genres were selected. Active genres are always shown at the top of the panel even when the search filter is active.

## MongoDB — critical gotchas

All collections have `additionalProperties: false` strict validators. Any write must include **all required fields** with **correct BSON types** or it will fail with "Document failed validation".

| Field type | Wrong | Right |
|---|---|---|
| Dates | `new Date().toISOString()` | `new Date()` |
| Integers | `someNumber` (JS double) | `new Int32(someNumber)` |
| ObjectIds | hex string | `new ObjectId()` |

The `books` collection requires: `goodreadsUrl`, `title`, `author`, `avgRating`, `numRatings`, `genres`, `genresAutocomplete`, `firstSeenGenre`, `schemaVersion`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

`$setOnInsert` and `$addToSet` cannot both target the same field in one operation — MongoDB throws a path conflict error. `genres` and `genresAutocomplete` are handled by `$addToSet` only; `$setOnInsert` does not touch them.

## Env var gotcha

`ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH_B64` stores the bcrypt hash **base64-encoded**. Reason: dotenv-expand treats `$2a`, `$10`, etc. in bcrypt hashes as shell variable references and mangles the value. The login route decodes it before comparing:
```ts
const validHash = Buffer.from(process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH_B64!, 'base64').toString('utf8')
```
Do not change this back to a raw hash in the env.

## Goodreads scraping

- Shelf page HTML format: ratings are in `<span class="greyText smallText">` with text `avg rating 3.68 — 7,380,157 ratings — published 2005`
- The old `.minirating` class no longer exists on Goodreads pages
- `ordered: false` on `bulkWrite` is intentional — partial page failures should not abort the whole page
- Timeouts revert job to `queued` (retry same page), not `failed`
- Rate limit default: 10 seconds, stored in `appConfig.rateLimitMs` in MongoDB (not an env var)
