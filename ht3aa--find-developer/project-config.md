# New chat — branch, push, and PR

Treat the **start of a new Cursor chat** (first time you would change the repo or run git in this thread) as a signal to isolate work on its own branch, publish it to the remote, and **open a pull request** into the default branch.

## When to run

- Do this **once per chat**, before the first commit or substantive edit, unless the user explicitly says to stay on the current branch or use an existing branch name.
- If the working tree is dirty, stop and tell the user to stash/commit or resolve; do not reset their work without permission.

## Branch name (the “label”)

Use a single descriptive slug derived from the user’s first request (kebab-case, ASCII, max ~50 chars). Prefix with the date so branches sort and stay unique:

`cursor/YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>`

Examples:

- `cursor/2025-03-23-fix-pint-workflow`
- `cursor/2025-03-23-add-newsletter-api`

If the goal is unclear, use a neutral slug like `cursor/2025-03-23-session` or ask the user for one word to use as the label.

## Commands (conceptual)

1. `git fetch origin`
2. Checkout the repo default branch (usually `main`) and fast-forward: `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only` (or the branch the user names)
3. Create and switch: `git checkout -b cursor/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>`
4. After the **first commit** on this branch (Git needs at least one commit to push a new branch on most hosts), push and set upstream:

`git push -u origin HEAD`

5. **Open a pull request** (see below). Do this after the push that publishes the branch, not before there is at least one commit.

Do not create empty commits only to satisfy push unless the user asks.

## Pull request

After the first successful **`git push -u origin HEAD`** for this session branch:

- If **`gh` CLI** is installed and authenticated:
  - If a PR for the current branch already exists (`gh pr view` succeeds), stop; do not create a duplicate.
  - Otherwise run **`gh pr create`** against the default base branch (usually `main`). Use non-interactive flags so it works in automation: `--base main`, `--title` (short, imperative summary of the change), `--body` (what changed, why, and tests or checks run). Omit `--head`; it defaults to the current branch.
  - Add **`--label cursor-session`** when the label exists in the repo; if `gh` errors on the label, retry without it or mention adding the label in the PR description.
- If **`gh` is not available** or not logged in: give the user the **compare URL** from the `git push` output, or construct `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/compare/main...<branch-name>`, and tell them to open “Compare & pull request” on GitHub.

Skip opening a PR only if the user explicitly says not to (e.g. WIP on purpose, or no remote host).

## Remote

- Push to **`origin`** (the user wrote “get”; interpret as **git** / default remote).
- Use the branch name above as the session “label”; no separate tag is required unless the user asks.

## Conflicts with other instructions

If the user or another rule says to use a specific branch (e.g. `feat/…`), follow that instead for this chat.
