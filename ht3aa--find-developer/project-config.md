# GitHub pull request label (Cursor agents)

Whenever you **create a new GitHub pull request** for this repository (including via the pull request management tool, `gh pr create`, or the GitHub web UI on behalf of the user), you **must** attach the label **`cursor`** to that PR in the same turn, before you finish.

## How to apply the label

1. Prefer the GitHub CLI from the repo root after the PR exists (works on the current branch’s PR):

   ```bash
   gh pr edit --add-label cursor
   ```

2. If that fails because the label does not exist yet, create it once (requires sufficient token permissions), then retry adding it:

   ```bash
   gh label create cursor --color BFD4F2 --description "Pull request opened by a Cursor agent" 2>/dev/null || true
   gh pr edit --add-label cursor
   ```

3. If `gh` is unavailable or authentication fails, say so explicitly in your summary and ask a maintainer to add the **`cursor`** label manually to the new PR.

## Customizing the label name

If this repository uses a different label (for example `ai` or `bot`), change the literal **`cursor`** in this file to match an existing repository label and keep the instructions above in sync.
