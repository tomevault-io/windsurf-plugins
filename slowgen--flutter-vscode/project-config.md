# AGENTS Index

This file is the root index for AI and contributor documentation.

## Canonical File Naming

- Use `AGENTS.md` (uppercase) as the only canonical root agent-instruction file.

## Quick Navigation

- [Documentation Root](docs/index.md)
- [Agent Guidelines](docs/agent-guidelines/index.md)
- [Architecture](docs/architecture/index.md)
- [Guides](docs/guides/index.md)
- [Reference](docs/reference/index.md)
- [Roadmap](docs/reference/roadmap.md)
- [Contributing](docs/contributing/index.md)

## Root Project Documents

- [README](README.md)
- [PRD](PRD.md)
- [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

## Mandatory Baseline Rules

- Project type is a Flutter package that provides code generation and runtime utilities.
- Keep generator code, runtime utilities, and platform-specific bridge implementations separated.
- Use `very_good_analysis` and follow Effective Dart conventions.
- Prefer `package:web` and `dart:js_interop`; do not add `dart:js_util`.
- For generation errors, provide actionable user-facing failures.
- Keep documentation and examples aligned with API behavior.

## Consumer Agent Toolkit

Extension authors (not package contributors) use:

- [Agent-Assisted Development](docs/guides/agent-assisted-development.md)
- [VS Code API Mapping](docs/reference/vscode-api-mapping.md)
- [Consumer AGENTS.md template](docs/templates/consumer-agents.md)
- Skills in [`skills/`](skills/) — scaffolded into extension projects as `agent-skills/`

For full detail, follow the linked topic pages under `docs/agent-guidelines/`.
