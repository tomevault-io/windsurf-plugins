## READ THE UNIVERSAL RULES FIRST

Before doing ANY work, fetch and read the TRIADBLUE universal brand rules:
```
curl -s "https://linkblue-githubproxy.up.railway.app/api/github/file?repo=.github&path=CLAUDE.md"
```
Those rules govern colors, fonts, naming, payments, and ecosystem standards. They are non-negotiable.

## SCANSBLUE-SPECIFIC BRAND COLORS

These override the universal defaults for this platform only:

| Token | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Background | `#E9ECF0` | Triad White — page backgrounds |
| Text | `#09080E` | Triad Black — all text |
| Primary | `#00203A` | Primary buttons, primary UI |

**Colors that MUST NOT appear on this site:**
- `#0000FF` — Pure Blue. Not for text, headers, borders, or buttons.
- `#E00420` — this is the / scan app color inside businessblueprint.io, NOT the scansblue.com brand red.

## ARCHITECTURE

### What ScansBlue Does
1. **Quick Analysis** — free scan of up to 5 pages. Checks buttons, logos, favicons, navigation, accessibility, forms, images, headings.
2. **Comprehensive Analysis** — $10. Full site crawl up to 50 pages. Prioritized task list delivered via email.
3. **Code and Site Auditor** — chat interface. Ask questions about a website's code, SEO, security.
4. **Bundle** — $15. Comprehensive + 5 auditor questions.
5. **Add-ons** — $5 per 5 additional pages or 5 additional questions. No limit on purchases.

### Pricing (Option A — Bundle-first)
- $10 — Comprehensive Analysis
- $15 — Comprehensive + 5 Auditor Questions
- $5 — 5 more pages or 5 more questions (unlimited increments)
- No standalone auditor — everyone starts with a report

### Homepage Structure — 4 Tabbed Sections
Everything lives on the homepage in curved file-folder tabs:

| Tab | Label (from site-config.ts) |
|-----|----------------------------|
| 1 | Quick Analysis |
| 2 | Comprehensive Analysis |
| 3 | Code and Site Auditor |
| 4 | Pricing |

All tab labels, prices, and features come from `client/src/config/site-config.ts`. Zero hardcoded strings in components.

### Configuration
**`client/src/config/site-config.ts`** is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for tab names, prices, features, colors, ecosystem data. One change here propagates to the header nav, tab bar, footer product column, and pricing cards.

### AI Engine
Three DeepSeek system prompts in `server/prompts/`:
- `code-auditor-system-prompt.md` — code review + marketing stack detection
- `comprehensive-analysis-system-prompt.md` — full site crawl + prioritized task list
- `quick-analysis-system-prompt.md` — fast per-category checks

All three are platform-aware (know about businessblueprint.io apps, scoring model, and setup cadence). Rewritten in Phase C (commit 7580e56).

### Integration with businessblueprint.io
ScansBlue powers the Digital IQ assessment:
- `POST /api/businessblueprint/fast-check` — quick scan for assessment pipeline
- `POST /api/businessblueprint/full-report` — comprehensive report queue
- `POST /api/businessblueprint/auditor` — interactive follow-up

### Payment Flow
All payments through swipesblue.com. ScansBlue calls SwipesBlue's checkout API.

### Logo Assets
Use logo files from `/Users/Shared/global assets/logo images and texts/scansblue-com/` on the local machine.

### Key Files
- `client/src/App.tsx` — routing
- `client/src/pages/home.tsx` — homepage with 4 tabs
- `client/src/config/site-config.ts` — centralized config
- `client/src/components/app-header.tsx` — header navigation
- `client/src/components/footer.tsx` — footer
- `server/routes.ts` — API routes (quick scan limit = 5 pages)
- `server/prompts/` — DeepSeek system prompts
- `server/services/deepseek.ts` — DeepSeek API service (code auditor)
- `server/services/questionParser.ts` — DeepSeek-powered question parsing (replaces former OpenAI service)
