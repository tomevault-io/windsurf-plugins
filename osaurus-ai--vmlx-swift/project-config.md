# Codex Configuration - vmlx-swift

See `~/AGENTS.md` for the global Codex environment, wiki protocol, hard rules,
machine context, and useful commands.

## Active Focus: Gemma 4 QAT Correctness Checkpoint

Until this lane is merged and consumed by Osaurus, focus only on the Gemma 4
QAT MXFP4/JANG_4M correctness checkpoint:

- Default model loading must not enable the paged RAM KV cache. Paged RAM cache
  may still be exercised by explicit benchmark or regression-test settings, but
  ordinary single-batch chat/server loads should start with it off.
- Gemma JANG_4M and MXFP4 QAT bundles must load and run through the real
  Osaurus/vMLX runtime path with bundle-driven generation config, parser/tool
  fixes, no protocol marker leakage, and no prompt or sampler masking.
- Cache claims must match telemetry. If the runtime reports rotating KV plus
  disk-backed restore and `turbo_quant_kv_layer_count=0`, do not claim a
  TurboQuant-KV-layer topology; report the effective KV mode, prefix/paged/L2
  counters, and disk-backed restore state exactly.
- Add real prefill progress telemetry so Osaurus can show prompt-processing
  percentage during long first-token waits. Progress must come from runtime
  prefill/cache/media stages, not from a UI timer guess.
- Defer raw speed benchmarking and Gemma4 audio support until after the
  correctness PR. Do not load or benchmark BF16/source Gemma bundles for this
  checkpoint.
- Keep progress and remaining proof in the repo docs before claiming the PR is
  merge-ready. This branch is not a broad model-runtime cleanup lane.

## MLXPress Non-Negotiables

For any MLXPress, JANGTQ, cache-stack, model-runtime, or Osaurus-facing work,
agents must treat these as hard gates, not nice-to-have follow-ups:

- Never add forced-behavior "fixes" to make a model look coherent. This
  includes forced thinking tags, forced reasoning closers/openers, hidden
  repetition penalties, synthetic temperature/top-p/top-k overrides, decode-loop
  close-token biasing, or prompt/template coercion that is not part of the
  model's own template/config contract. If any such guard exists, treat it as a
  bug: document where it came from, remove it, and fix the real root cause in
  template parsing, runtime/decode, cache, matmul/Hadamard/2D/3D kernels, model
  loading, or API wiring.
- Default generation parameters must come from the active model's
  `generation_config.json` or equivalent bundle config. Chat/API/CLI defaults
  may pass user-explicit overrides, but must not silently invent sampler,
  repetition-penalty, or thinking-mode defaults to hide a runtime issue.
- Low RAM means Activity Monitor physical footprint stays low. A load or
  generation row that reaches full model size in Activity Monitor is a failure,
  even if the output is coherent.
- Always record token/s when generation occurs. If no token/s is emitted,
  document that as a failed/blocked row.
- Coherency matters every time: visible answer, reasoning channel, no looping,
  no hidden reasoning-only output, and no length-cap fake pass.
- Multi-turn proof is required before calling a model family working. Single
  prompt or load-only evidence is not enough.
- Cache-stack proof must include the relevant cache topology: prefix/paged/L2
  disk hits, TurboQuant KV when enabled, and architecture-specific companion
  state for VL, video, SSM/linear-attention, or other path-dependent caches.
- VL/video rows need real media payloads and cache-hit validation, not only
  text-path evidence.
- Unstacked routed JANGTQ must use the low-RAM active-streaming path by
  default. Do not write or load permanent prestacked routed overlays unless the
  user explicitly asks for an overlay diagnostic.
- Report-only memory-gate runs are diagnostics only. They never make a row
  production-ready.
- The historical JangPress target is resident compute with macOS reclaiming
  cold routed pages, not per-token SSD/active-bank streaming. A row around
  1 tok/s with tiny Activity Monitor footprint is still rejected for the
  user-facing methodology. Recovering the old MiniMax target means usable
  decode speed while staying below the family Activity Monitor gate, with
  coherent multi-turn output and low effective read pressure.
- Old JangPress MiniMax notes are a target, not proof: MiniMax Small measured
  about 43.74 tok/s at pct=70 with ~5.5 GB RSS post-decode and 22.9 GB
  reclaimed, but those rows predate Activity Monitor `phys_footprint` gates and
  had a chunk-buffer output bug. Current rows must re-prove speed, low
  footprint, and coherency together.
- Faster rows that loop are failures. MiniMax compiled-decode diagnostics are
  useful only after `KVCacheSimple` is promoted to `CompilableKVCache`; promote
  no compiled row unless it passes the same no-loop, no-length-stop, multi-turn
  coherency gates as the default decode path. The current MiniMax compiled
  TurboQuant-KV row closes the old speed/RAM target only for the explicit
  ephemeral-prestack diagnostic; it remains partial until explicit overlay
  dependence is removed.
- Activity Monitor gates must measure/enforce `phys_footprint`, not secretly
  throttle `MLX.Memory.memoryLimit`. Throttling can turn a valid MiniMax
