## Cloud-specific instructions

# ryOS Cloud Environment Guide

## Development Environment

This project uses **Bun** as the package manager and runtime. Local API testing should use the standalone Bun server + Vite proxy, while production deployment can still target **Vercel**.

### Package Manager

- **Bun** is required (version 1.3.5+)
- Use `bun install` to install dependencies
- Use `bun run <script>` to run package.json scripts

### Key Commands

```bash
# Development
bun run dev            # Start full stack (API + Vite with proxy) — the default
bun run dev:vite       # Start Vite dev server only (frontend-only, no API)
bun run dev:api        # Start standalone Bun API server only (port 3000)
bun run dev:vercel     # Optional: Vercel dev server (parity/debugging only)

# Build & Production
bun run build      # TypeScript compile + Vite build

# Testing
bun test           # Run all tests via bun:test (API tests require server running)
bun run test:unit  # Unit/wiring tests only (no server needed)
bun run test:api   # API integration tests only
```

### Running the Application

For **full functionality** (default):
```bash
bun run dev
```

For **frontend-only** development (no API):
```bash
bun run dev:vite
```

For **API server only** (e.g. to run tests against):
```bash
bun run dev:api
```

The frontend runs on port 5173 by default. The standalone API defaults to port 3000.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for full functionality:

### Required for Core Features
- `REDIS_KV_REST_API_URL` - Upstash Redis REST API URL (for caching, chat rooms, authentication)
- `REDIS_KV_REST_API_TOKEN` - Upstash Redis REST API token

### Required for AI Features
- AI provider API keys (at least one):
  - OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google AI keys are configured via Vercel AI SDK

### Required for Real-time Features
- `PUSHER_APP_ID` - Pusher app ID (for chat rooms)
- `PUSHER_KEY` - Pusher key
- `PUSHER_SECRET` - Pusher secret
- `PUSHER_CLUSTER` - Pusher cluster

### Optional Features
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - ElevenLabs API (for text-to-speech)
- `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` - YouTube Data API (for video metadata)
- `YOUTUBE_API_KEY_2` - YouTube Data API fallback key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API (for audio transcription)
- `MAPKIT_TEAM_ID` / `MAPKIT_KEY_ID` / `MAPKIT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `MAPKIT_ORIGIN` - Apple MapKit (powers the Maps app + the AI's `mapsSearchPlaces` tool via the Apple Maps Server API)
- `MUSICKIT_TEAM_ID` / `MUSICKIT_KEY_ID` / `MUSICKIT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `MUSICKIT_ORIGIN` - MusicKit JS v3 (Apple Music) used by the iPod's "Apple Music" library mode. Reuse the same `.p8` key as MapKit if both services are enabled on the key — the signer falls back to `MAPKIT_TEAM_ID` / `MAPKIT_KEY_ID` / `MAPKIT_PRIVATE_KEY` when the `MUSICKIT_*` variants are unset.
- `IP_GEOLOCATION_URL_TEMPLATE` - Optional override for the IP-geolocation provider used as a fallback when Vercel's `geolocation()` returns nothing (defaults to `https://ipwho.is/{ip}`). Use this on Coolify / Docker / plain Bun deploys, or to switch to a paid provider. Use `{ip}` as the placeholder.
- `IP_GEOLOCATION_DISABLED` - Set to `1`/`true` to disable the IP-geolocation fallback entirely (no outbound calls).

### Non-Vercel Deployment Hardening

These knobs only matter when the API is **not** running on Vercel (i.e. Coolify, Docker, plain Bun). On Vercel, the platform-managed `X-Vercel-Forwarded-For` is trusted automatically and these are unused.

- `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` - Number of trusted reverse-proxy hops in front of the API. **Defaults to `0`**, meaning client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` are NOT trusted (the standalone Bun server's socket peer IP is used instead). Set to `1` if you have one trusted reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Render's edge, Fly.io's edge, etc.) injecting the client IP into the right-most XFF entry; set to `2`+ for chained proxies. Tests (`bun run dev:api`) export `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=1` because integration tests use spoofed XFF to exercise per-IP rate limits.
- `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE` - Force the `Secure` flag on/off for the auth cookie. Set to `1`/`true` on any HTTPS-fronted self-hosted deployment if auto-detection is wrong. Auto-detection enables `Secure` whenever `APP_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` starts with `https://` or the runtime env is `production`/`preview`.

### Localization / Scripts
- `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` - Google Generative AI (for machine translation of locale files)

**Note:** The application will run with limited functionality without these environment variables. API endpoints requiring these services will fail gracefully.

### Using `.env.local`

The project includes a `.env.local` file with all required keys pre-configured. Scripts that need API keys (e.g. `scripts/machine-translate.ts`) do **not** auto-load `.env.local`. Export the key before running:

```bash
export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="$(grep GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY .env.local | cut -d'"' -f2)"
bun run scripts/machine-translate.ts
```

## Project Structure

- `api/` - Node-style API route handlers (Vercel-compatible, also used by standalone Bun server)
