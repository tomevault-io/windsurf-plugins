# UIKitPlus - Agent Governance

## Repository Identity

UIKitPlus is a declarative, protocol-oriented UI framework built on UIKit/AppKit.

Core characteristics:
- fluent `Self`-returning API composition;
- extension-driven feature growth;
- reference-semantic reactive state (`State`, `InnerState`, mapped/bound states);
- deferred/state-backed layout constraints;
- explicit UIKit/AppKit platform bridges;
- native-platform behavior as the preferred implementation substrate.

Architecture is frozen by default. Contract-changing architecture work requires explicit maintainer approval.

## Authority Hierarchy

When stable documents conflict, higher authority wins:

1. `.agent/SYSTEM_RULES.md` - global operational/engineering invariants.
2. `.agent/WORKFLOW.md`, `.agent/DEVELOPMENT_ORCHESTRATION.md`, `.agent/ARTIFACTS_WORKFLOW.md`, and `.agent/COMMIT_RULES.md` - development/orchestration/artifact/Git workflow.
3. `.agent/ARCH_INDEX.md` and the owning `.agent/architecture/*.md` files - technical architecture and architecture-ID authority.
4. `.agent/STYLE_GUIDELINES.md`, `.agent/DSL_SAFETY_RULES.md`, `.agent/EXTENSION_RULES.md`, and applicable focused policy/skill docs - implementation conventions inside architecture boundaries.
5. `.agent/PROJECT_MEMORY.md` and `.agent/SOURCE_MAP.md` - durable current-state/navigation facts.
6. `.agent/TASKS.md`, `.agent/TODO.md`, `.agent/TECH_DEBT.md`, `.agent/TASKS_ARCHIVE.md`, and `.agent/STATE_VNEXT_PLAN.md` - active work, future work, debt, history, and deferred State planning.
7. `.agent/CONTEXT_LOADING_RULES.md`, `.agent/CONTEXT_BUDGET.md`, `.agent/PUBLIC_CONTENT_IDEAS.md`, `.agent/SKILL_INDEX.md`, `.agent/skills/*`, `.agent/TEMPLATE_INDEX.md`, and `.agent/templates/*` - progressive routing and focused operational guidance.

`.artifacts/**` is disposable Git-ignored working memory and never stable authority.

Architecture owners win on UIKitPlus semantics. Link to owners instead of duplicating full contracts in routing/workflow docs.

## Mandatory Development Workflow

**PLAN -> IMPLEMENT -> AUDIT**

- Non-trivial work requires current-repository research and a reviewed plan before production mutation.
- Use `.agent/DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md` for UIKitPlus-specific phase mechanics.
- For non-trivial iterative LLM-assisted work, load `.agent/DEVELOPMENT_ORCHESTRATION.md` and `.agent/ARTIFACTS_WORKFLOW.md`.
- Large/cognitively dense implementation or correction work is decomposed into numbered surgical task files; detailed mechanics stay in those files and the executor receives one short coordinator prompt.
- Executor reports are evidence, never proof. Independently inspect actual source/diff/Git and relevant architecture owners.
- If a materially reviewed assumption fails during implementation, stop that path and re-plan rather than silently widening scope.
- Commit and push are separate explicit gates; passing AUDIT does not authorize either.

## UIKitPlus Engineering Routing

For source/API work:

1. Use `.agent/ARCH_INDEX.md` to select the relevant architecture owner(s).
2. Load `.agent/architecture/LAYER_MODEL.md` plus the smallest decision-complete domain/contract set.
3. Inspect analogous existing UIKitPlus source before designing a new approach.
4. Preserve the native-first two-stage pattern where applicable: thin declarative native wrapper first, UIKitPlus convenience layer second.
5. Preserve fluent/reference/state/extension/platform invariants owned by the selected architecture docs.

Application state-placement work additionally routes through `.agent/architecture/APPLICATION_STATE_OWNERSHIP.md` and its `AO*` invariants.

## Mandatory Context Budget

Normal work:
- starts here;
- loads `ARCH_INDEX.md` for routing;
- keeps at most 3 active architecture docs by default, including `LAYER_MODEL.md`;
- loads at most one operational skill by default;
- uses `SOURCE_MAP.md` before broad source discovery;
- inspects the smallest relevant source subset.

Operational orchestration/artifact/public-content routers do not consume architecture-doc slots. Public-content shards are lazy and must not be loaded "just in case".

Cross-cutting governance/architecture audits may deliberately exceed the default budget. Full rules: `.agent/CONTEXT_LOADING_RULES.md` and `.agent/CONTEXT_BUDGET.md`.

## Documentation Self-Maintenance

- Stable docs must match current implementation and reviewed architecture.
- Architecture IDs have one authoritative owner; cite instead of restating alternate full rules.
- Update only docs whose owned durable fact actually changed.
- Keep transient execution history, local tool IDs, temporary logs, and task-specific evidence in `.artifacts/**`, not stable governance.
- If `.artifacts/**` disappears, reconstruct current working context from stable docs + Git + actual source; never invent lost evidence.

After meaningful research/design/implementation/correction/audit, perform the lazy capture check owned by `.agent/PUBLIC_CONTENT_IDEAS.md`. Open the bank only when genuinely valuable README/docs/website/release/migration/publication material was discovered, then load only the relevant shard.

## Git Safety

Follow `.agent/COMMIT_RULES.md`.
