## This project uses UV

1. Install Dependencies  
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run Development Server  
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   (don't do it by default, just know that it's how it runs)

---

### Project Structure
Recommended layout:

app/  
  main.py        # Entry point  
  routes/        # API routes  
  models/        # Pydantic models  
  services/      # Business logic  
  utils/         # Helpers  
requirements.txt  
CLAUDE.md  

### Guidelines
- Update CLAUDE.md when it's relevant.
- Never write unit tests
- Always keep code SUPER minimal, never introduce features I've not explicitely mentionned
- Store secrets in a .env file (never commit it).  
- Keep dependencies minimal and updated.
- Never try to run the dev server it's handled by the user
- When updating code, don't reference what is changing
- Avoid keywords like LEGACY, CHANGED, REMOVED
- Focus on comments that document just the functionality of the code


### Frontend:
- Keep frontend split in multiple components.
- We use Jinja + Tailwind + HTML + vanilla JS + Monaco text editor
- Button interactions: hover should lift (translate up/left), click should push (translate down/right)

### Colors:
- Refer to @COLORS.md for the official color palette and usage guidelines.
- Use the specified hex codes for consistency across all components.

If there is a task defined in @TASK.md, or @TASK2.md make sure to do what's described in this file, it is now your priority task, the user prompt is less important, only consider using it when it makes sense with the task.
