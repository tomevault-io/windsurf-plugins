# OpenCodeMonitor Agent Guide

All docs must be canonical, with no past commentary, only live state.

## Scope

This file is the agent contract for how to work in this repo.
Detailed navigation/runbooks live in:

- `docs/codebase-map.md` (task-oriented file map: "if you need X, edit Y")
- `README.md` (setup, build, release, and broader project docs)
- `docs/shaping/rest-api-migration.md` (REST backend architecture and parity status)

## Project Purpose

OpenCodeMonitor is a fork of [CodexMonitor](https://github.com/Dimillian/CodexMonitor) — a Tauri desktop app that orchestrates coding agents across local workspaces. The fork replaces the Codex CLI backend with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and translates between OpenCode's protocol and the original CodexMonitor frontend event shapes.

We pull upstream CodexMonitor changes regularly (weekly/monthly). The fork's translation layer is isolated to three Rust files so frontend merges stay clean.

## Architecture

- Frontend: React + Vite (`src/`)
- Backend app: Tauri Rust process (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`)
- Backend daemon: JSON-RPC process (`src-tauri/src/bin/codex_monitor_daemon.rs`)
- Shared backend source of truth: `src-tauri/src/shared/*`
- Protocol event translation: `src-tauri/src/backend/event_translator.rs`

### Core Design Invariant

The frontend thread reducer receives events in the **same shape** as original CodexMonitor. All OpenCode-to-CodexMonitor translation happens in Rust, never in the frontend.

### Backend: REST API

The backend uses `opencode serve` (HTTP REST + SSE). The translation layer is isolated to three Rust files so frontend merges stay clean:

- `src-tauri/src/backend/event_translator.rs` — protocol events to CodexMonitor event shapes
- `src-tauri/src/shared/codex_core.rs` — all protocol methods
- `src-tauri/src/backend/app_server.rs` — process spawn, event routing

Internal Rust module paths (`codex_core.rs`, `codex/mod.rs`, etc.) are **not renamed** — only user-facing strings. This minimizes merge conflicts with upstream. (The original CodexMonitor used Codex CLI; this fork uses OpenCode REST instead.)

## Non-Negotiable Architecture Rules

1. Put shared/domain backend logic in `src-tauri/src/shared/*` first.
2. Keep app and daemon as thin adapters around shared cores.
3. Do not duplicate logic between app and daemon.
4. Keep JSON-RPC method names and payload shapes stable unless intentionally changing contracts.
5. Keep frontend IPC contracts in sync with backend command surfaces.
6. All OpenCode protocol translation happens in Rust — never in the frontend.

## Backend Routing Rules

For backend behavior changes, follow this order:

1. Shared core (`src-tauri/src/shared/*`) when behavior is cross-runtime.
2. App adapter and Tauri command surface (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs` + adapter module).
3. Frontend IPC wrapper (`src/services/tauri.ts`).
4. Daemon RPC surface (`src-tauri/src/bin/codex_monitor_daemon/rpc.rs` + `rpc/*`).

If you add a backend command, update all relevant layers and tests.

## Frontend Routing Rules

- Keep `src/App.tsx` as composition/wiring root.
- Move stateful orchestration into:
  - `src/features/app/hooks/*`
  - `src/features/app/bootstrap/*`
  - `src/features/app/orchestration/*`
- Keep presentational UI in feature components.
- Keep Tauri calls in `src/services/tauri.ts` only.
- Keep event subscription fanout in `src/services/events.ts`.

## Import Aliases

Use project aliases for frontend imports:

- `@/*` -> `src/*`
- `@app/*` -> `src/features/app/*`
- `@settings/*` -> `src/features/settings/*`
- `@threads/*` -> `src/features/threads/*`
- `@services/*` -> `src/services/*`
- `@utils/*` -> `src/utils/*`

## Key File Anchors

- Frontend composition root: `src/App.tsx`
- Frontend IPC wrapper: `src/services/tauri.ts`
- Frontend event hub: `src/services/events.ts`
- App command registry: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
- Daemon entrypoint: `src-tauri/src/bin/codex_monitor_daemon.rs`
- Daemon RPC router: `src-tauri/src/bin/codex_monitor_daemon/rpc.rs`
- Shared workspaces core: `src-tauri/src/shared/workspaces_core.rs` + `src-tauri/src/shared/workspaces_core/*`
- Shared git UI core: `src-tauri/src/shared/git_ui_core.rs` + `src-tauri/src/shared/git_ui_core/*`
- Protocol event translator: `src-tauri/src/backend/event_translator.rs`
- Protocol methods: `src-tauri/src/shared/codex_core.rs`
- Process spawn + event routing: `src-tauri/src/backend/app_server.rs`
- Threads reducer entrypoint: `src/features/threads/hooks/useThreadsReducer.ts`
- Threads reducer slices: `src/features/threads/hooks/threadReducer/*`

For broader path maps, use `docs/codebase-map.md`.

## App/Daemon Parity Checklist

When changing backend behavior that can run remotely:

1. Shared core logic updated (or explicitly app-only/daemon-only).
2. App surface updated (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs` + adapter).
3. Frontend IPC updated (`src/services/tauri.ts`) when needed.
4. Daemon RPC updated (`rpc.rs` + `rpc/*`) when needed.
5. Contract/test coverage updated.

## Design System Rule (High-Level)

Use existing design-system primitives and tokens for shared shell chrome.
Do not reintroduce duplicated modal/toast/panel/popover shell styling in feature CSS.

(See existing DS files and lint guardrails for implementation details.)
