# Tempo

Tempo is a blockchain node built on [Reth SDK](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth).

## Pull Requests

## TIPs (Tempo Improvement Proposals)

When creating a new TIP:

- Branch: `tip/XXXX` where `XXXX` is the next available TIP number (check `tips/` directory and existing branches).
- File: `tips/tip-XXXX.md` matching the branch number.
- Follow the template in `tips/tip_template.md`.
- Follow the process and quality gates in `tips/tip-0000.md`.

### Titles

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with an optional scope:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`

**Scope** (optional): crate or area, e.g. `evm`, `consensus`, `rpc`, `tip-1017`

Examples:
- `fix(rpc): correct gas estimation for TIP-20 transfers`
- `perf: batch trie updates to reduce cursor overhead`
- `feat(consensus): add checkpoint guard for batched state ops`

### Descriptions

Keep it short. Say what changed and why — nothing more.

**Do:**
- Write 1–3 sentences summarizing the change
- Explain _why_ if the diff doesn't make it obvious
- Link related issues or TIPs
- Include benchmark numbers for perf changes

**Don't:**
- List every file changed — that's what the diff is for
- Repeat the title in the body
- Add "Files changed" or "Changes" sections
- Write walls of text that go stale when the diff is updated
- Use filler like "This PR introduces...", "comprehensive", "robust", "enhance", "leverage"

**Template:**

```
Closes #<issue>

<what changed, 1-3 sentences>

<why, if not obvious from the diff>
```

**Good example:**

```
Closes #2901

Adds `valid_before` upper bound for all AA transactions. Transactions past
their expiry are rejected at validation time and cleaned up from the pool
via a periodic sweep.
```

**Bad example:**

```
## Summary
This PR introduces comprehensive validation checks for the valid_before field.

## Changes
- Modified `crates/pool/src/validate.rs` to add validation
- Modified `crates/pool/src/pool.rs` to add cleanup
- Added tests in `crates/pool/src/tests/valid_before.rs`

## Files Changed
- crates/pool/src/validate.rs
- crates/pool/src/pool.rs
- crates/pool/src/tests/valid_before.rs
```
