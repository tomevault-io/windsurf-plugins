# Pre-Push Checks

Before pushing code or creating a pull request, **always** run these checks locally in order:

1. `npm run lint` — must exit with 0 errors (warnings are acceptable)
2. `npm run test:unit` — all tests must pass with no regressions introduced
3. `npm run build` — build must succeed

Only proceed to push / create a PR once all three pass cleanly.
