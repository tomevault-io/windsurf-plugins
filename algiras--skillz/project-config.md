# Skillz Coding Standards

## Before Committing

ALWAYS run these checks before committing any changes:

```bash
# 1. Format code
cargo fmt --all

# 2. Run clippy with warnings as errors
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# 3. Run tests
cargo test
```

## Code Style

- Use `#[allow(dead_code)]` for public API methods that aren't used internally
- Follow Rust formatting conventions (enforced by `cargo fmt`)
- No clippy warnings allowed (enforced by `-D warnings`)

## Version Bumping

When making changes, bump the version in `Cargo.toml`:
- Patch version (0.4.x) for bug fixes and minor improvements
- Minor version (0.x.0) for new features
- Major version (x.0.0) for breaking changes

## Testing

- Add tests for new functionality in `tests/` directory
- Use `tempfile::TempDir` for tests that need filesystem access
- Run tests with `cargo test --release -- --test-threads=1`

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
