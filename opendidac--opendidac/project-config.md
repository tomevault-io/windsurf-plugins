### Project Overview

Eval is an educational platform designed to facilitate the creation, distribution, and management of training exercises and exams across various disciplines, with a strong emphasis on engineering and software development. It aims to provide a seamless experience for educators and students, offering tools for interactive assessments and real-time evaluation tracking.

Key Features:
- Diverse Question Types: Multiple choice, essay, code writing (multi-language support), database queries (PostgreSQL), and web development tasks
- Code Execution Environment: Monaco editor-based sandbox for multiple programming languages
- Authentication: NextAuth
- Evaluation Lifecycle: Four phases (Draft, In Progress, Grading, Finished)
- Real-time Monitoring: Student progress tracking and analytics
- Automated Grading: Support for various question types with manual override
- Export Capabilities: Results in CSV and PDF formats

### Project Architecture

Frontend:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- React 18 for component architecture
- Material-UI (MUI) v5 for base components
- Monaco Editor for code editing
- SWR for data fetching and caching
- NextAuth for authentication

Backend:
- Next.js API Routes
- Prisma ORM for database operations
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Docker for containerization

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Code Principles:
- Write clear, maintainable code with early returns
- Use Tailwind classes exclusively for styling
- Prefer "class:" over ternary operators in class declarations
- Follow REST API best practices for endpoints
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use Prisma transactions for data consistency
- Implement proper security measures (CSRF, XSS protection)

Naming Conventions:
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (e.g., handleClick)
- Follow consistent casing patterns (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)
- Use meaningful Prisma model and field names

Accessibility Requirements:
- Include appropriate tabindex values
- Add descriptive aria-labels
- Implement proper event handlers (onClick, onKeyDown)
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 compliance

Code Structure:
- Organize code by feature/module
- Separate business logic from UI components
- Use custom hooks for shared logic
- Implement proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Follow consistent formatting patterns
- Use proper error boundaries

Testing Requirements:
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Test database operations thoroughly
- Ensure proper error handling coverage

Dependencies:
- Use NPM as package manager
- Leverage MUI components for consistent UI
- Minimize external dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Document any new dependency additions

Security Guidelines:
- Implement proper authentication flows
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Follow OWASP security best practices
- Implement proper input validation
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Implement proper CORS policies
