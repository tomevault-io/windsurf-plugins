## Plan Desk Factory — default operating mode

This repository runs on the Factory workflow. On any work request:

1. **Follow the factory cycle** — the always-on [factory.md](.agents/factory/factory.md) contract governs each work item: pull → read → red gate → delegate → prove → observe → gate → ship. Bracket the session with `start_agent_run` / `complete_agent_run`; call `record_agent_progress` every cycle.
2. **Delegate implementation by default — when a worker is available.** The supervisor orchestrates; IC workers execute. Probe the dispatchers in [.agents/factory/workers/](.agents/factory/workers/) per [protocol.md](.agents/factory/protocol.md) and hand each work item to a probed worker. **If no worker is installed on this machine, do the work yourself under the same contract** — never skip the cycle just because you are the one typing, and never assume a delegation skill or worker CLI exists that this repo did not ship. Write inline without dispatch only for trivial edits, integration/conflict resolution, and review fixes under ~5 lines.
3. **Execute without pausing** — decompose the goal into verifiable moves on a harness task list (`TaskCreate` / `TaskList` / `TaskUpdate`), drive them to zero, and ship finished work without pausing for permission. The IC spine is [execution.md](.agents/factory/execution.md).
4. **Prove before done** — re-run the claimed checks per [protocol.md](.agents/factory/protocol.md); exit codes are authoritative.
