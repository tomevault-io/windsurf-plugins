# Use desktop-driver without guessing its CLI

`desktop` is the instrument, not the application under test. It has three distinct interfaces:

| Need | Interface | Read before acting |
|---|---|---|
| Navigate a web page, query the DOM, fill forms, manage tabs or downloads | `desktop browser` | [references/browser.md](references/browser.md) |
| Inspect or act on browser chrome or another GUI application | accessibility commands such as `snapshot`, `click`, and `type` | [references/desktop.md](references/desktop.md) |
| Launch a GUI away from the user's keyboard and pointer | `desktop session` | [references/sessions.md](references/sessions.md), then the reference for the chosen interface |

Read only the reference for the route being used. Read
[references/recovery.md](references/recovery.md) after a failed command or when scripting around exit
codes. Do not translate options between interfaces: `desktop click --element 7` and
`desktop browser click @e7` are unrelated syntaxes.

## Command discipline

1. If the exact syntax is not present in the relevant reference, run
   `desktop <namespace> <command> --help` before composing the command. Never invent a flag, selector
   prefix, key chord, or positional order.
2. Put global options immediately after `desktop` so they cannot be consumed by a launched program:
   `desktop --json ...`, `desktop --no-steal-focus ...`, `desktop --read-only ...`.
3. Use `--json` when subsequent logic depends on the result. Branch on the exit code and the JSON
   `error` field; do not parse human prose.
4. Quote user text, paths, URLs containing shell metacharacters, and complete browser selectors.
   Pass literal values as one argument.
5. Observe, act, then observe again. Use `wait`; never use a fixed sleep to assume a GUI or page
   changed.
6. Stop sessions and managed browsers that this task started. Do not close a pre-existing user
   application or delete a persistent profile unless the user asked.

## Safety boundary

When using the user's existing desktop, add `--no-steal-focus` and use element-addressed
accessibility actions. It refuses pointer or keyboard operations that could race the user. Use
`--host` only when the task explicitly targets the user's desktop while an agent session is active.

For a new login, start a named session with `--visible`, open a visible browser, and hand the window
to the user. The user enters passwords, passkeys, and one-time codes. Never request, read, capture,
or type those values. Continue only after the user confirms login. If a visible session is
unavailable, stop instead of falling back to headless authentication.

## Minimal valid loops

Browser page content:

```bash
desktop --json browser doctor
desktop --json browser open 'https://example.com' --headless
desktop --json browser snapshot --interactive
desktop --json browser click @e1
desktop --json browser wait --load domcontentloaded --timeout 10000
desktop --json browser snapshot --interactive
desktop --json browser close
```

Existing GUI on the user's desktop:

```bash
desktop --no-steal-focus --json apps
desktop --no-steal-focus --json snapshot --app 'Calculator'
desktop --no-steal-focus --json click --element 7
desktop --no-steal-focus --json snapshot --app 'Calculator'
```

New isolated GUI:

```bash
desktop --json session list
desktop --json session start task-name --visible
desktop --json session run firefox 'https://example.com'
desktop --json snapshot --app Firefox
desktop --json session stop
```

The examples above show syntax, not permission to perform unrelated mutations. Authentication and
profile deletion retain the stricter boundaries above.
