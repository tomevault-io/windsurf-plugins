# SoL-Pi installation and configuration instructions

For any request that installs, builds, configures, or validates SoL-Pi:

1. Read `agents-install.md` completely before taking action.
2. Follow its phases, stop conditions, evidence requirements, and install-scope rules unless an explicit user instruction conflicts.
3. Never expose a credential or silently ignore a failed validation command.
4. Keep upstream Pi unmodified; SoL-Pi must remain a standalone extension.

For ordinary repository changes, preserve the same compatibility and secret-handling constraints.
