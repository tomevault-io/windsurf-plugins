# SimpleDB

This documentation provides information about the SimpleDB project and also provides development workflow for Claude Code agents.

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: A SQL database which started as a port of SimpleDB from Java to Rust. It is mainly a playground for performance profiling, testing and experimenting with novel approaches of building database engines.

**Tech Stack**: Rust, Python

**Repository**: https://github.com/redixhumayun/simpledb

## Architecture Overview

Core engine paths should remain dependency-free beyond the Rust standard library.
Allowed exceptions:
- platform bindings that expose OS primitives not available in `std` (for example `libc`)
- non-engine tooling dependencies (for example benchmark harnesses like `criterion` and CLI parsing like `clap`)

Do not introduce third-party crates on the critical read/write/transaction execution path without explicit design discussion and rationale.

The code is designed to construct and answer typical SQL queries. The code will construct a query tree that will use the pull-based iterator pattern in a way that is probably typical in most SQL systems. However, the code leans towards readability rather than performance.

There is a test suite which provides basic coverage to ensure the code still works. This can be run with `cargo test`. Never run tests in serial by specifying threads as 1 as this will hide isolation issues. Always make sure tests pass when you make any changes.

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow (REQUIRED)
1. **Always start by syncing with master**:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   ```

2. **Create feature branch with descriptive name**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
   # or fix/bug-description, enhance/improvement-name
   ```

3. **Work autonomously using available tools** until blocked

4. **Treat documentation as part of the code change**:
   - when you add or change Rust code, add or update Rust docs/comments where needed
   - docs should explain **why** first, especially the reasoning behind decisions and invariants
   - keep docs clear and concise; do not write verbose commentary

5. **Test thoroughly before committing**:
   Testing requires running tests with combinations of compiler flags. The default-feature run exercises the default Direct-IO path. The no-default-features runs below vary replacement policy coverage without repeating the default IO feature set. Run these commands one after another; do not use `--test-threads=1`.
   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo test
   # Verify default features build and tests pass. Default features include replacement_lru, page-4k, and direct-io.

   cargo test --no-default-features --features replacement_clock --features page-4k
   # Verify build works and tests pass

   cargo test --no-default-features --features replacement_sieve --features page-4k
   # Verify build works and tests pass
   ```

6. **Run benchmarks before committing only when asked**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin simpledb
   # verify the CLI starts up without errors

   SIMPLEDB_BENCH_BUFFERS=12 cargo bench --bench buffer_pool --no-default-features --features replacement_lru --features page-4k
   # verify that the operations complete and see results

   SIMPLEDB_BENCH_BUFFERS=12 cargo bench --bench buffer_pool --no-default-features --features replacement_clock --features page-4k
   # verify that the operations complete and see results

   SIMPLEDB_BENCH_BUFFERS=12 cargo bench --bench buffer_pool --no-default-features --features replacement_sieve --features page-4k
   # verify that the operations complete and see results

   # Filter to a specific benchmark (Criterion passes filter after --)
   SIMPLEDB_BENCH_BUFFERS=12 cargo bench --bench buffer_pool -- "Sequential Scan"
   ```

7. **Run cargo formatting before committing**
   ```bash
   # check whether clippy reports errors
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   # check cargo formatting
   cargo fmt -- --check
   # run cargo fix
   cargo clippy --fix
   # fix remaining errors before committing
   ```

8. **Create PR with descriptive title and summary**
   - Write the description for a reviewer, not as an implementation log — no phases, no task lists, no "step 1/2/3" framing
   - Lead with what changed and why, in plain prose
   - Group related changes into short paragraphs if there are multiple concerns; one paragraph per distinct concern is enough
   - Note breaking changes (renamed methods, removed APIs, changed signatures) explicitly
   - No test plan checklist — CI covers that

9. **Address PR review comments**
   - Evaluate each comment: determine whether it identifies a genuine bug or design issue before acting
   - Fix each distinct issue in a separate commit
   - Reply to the comment thread using the GitHub API once the fix is committed and pushed:
     ```bash
     # List comment IDs for a PR
     gh api repos/redixhumayun/simpledb/pulls/<PR>/comments --jq '.[] | {id: .id, login: .user.login, path: .path, body: .body[:80]}'

     # Reply to a comment
     gh api repos/redixhumayun/simpledb/pulls/<PR>/comments/<comment_id>/replies \
       -f body="Fixed in <commit hash>.
