# Code Review Checklist

When reviewing or submitting code changes, verify:

## Required Checks

- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] No linting errors (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`npm run format:check`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)

## Code Quality

- [ ] No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- [ ] Functions have appropriate error handling
- [ ] No console.log statements (use NestJS Logger if needed)
- [ ] No hardcoded values that should be configurable

## Metrics Best Practices

- [ ] Metric names follow Prometheus naming conventions (snake_case, _total suffix for counters)
- [ ] Labels are low-cardinality (avoid user IDs, timestamps as labels)
- [ ] Histograms use appropriate bucket sizes for the use case

## Testing

- [ ] New features have corresponding unit tests
- [ ] Edge cases are covered
- [ ] Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)

## Documentation

- [ ] README updated if public API changed
- [ ] JSDoc comments for public methods
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry if needed (managed by semantic-release)
