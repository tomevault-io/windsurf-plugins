# GEMINI Project Context: MapleScript Automation

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based automation project for the online game *MapleStory*. Its primary purpose is to automate repetitive in-game tasks, such as completing daily quests, fighting bosses, and managing collections.

The architecture is composed of three main parts:
1.  **A Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with `PySide6`, acting as the main control center for users. It provides a modern, dark-themed interface to start/stop tasks and view execution logs.
2.  **A Python control script (Backend)**: Running on a **Windows** host computer. It uses computer vision libraries (`mss`, `OpenCV`, `Pillow`) and Windows-specific APIs (`pywin32`) to interact with the game window. It recognizes game elements by matching them against images in the `photos/` directory to decide on the next action. AI-powered rune detection is handled by `src/utils/rune_detector.py` using TFLite models in `models/`.
3.  **A Seeed Studio Xiao ESP32S3 microcontroller**: Acting as a hardware-level input device. It runs `CircuitPython` and receives commands from the host PC via a USB serial connection. It translates these commands into actual keyboard presses and mouse movements, making the automation difficult to distinguish from human input.

The core logic is encapsulated in `src/MapleScript.py`, which provides base functionalities, **thread-safety mechanisms**, and **minimap-based navigation** (`move_to_point`). Computer vision tasks are delegated to `src/utils/maple_vision.py`. Low-level window management is handled by `src/utils/windows_object.py`. Specific automation routines (e.g., `MapleGrind`, `DailyBoss`, `RouteRecorder`) inherit from the base `MapleScript` class.

Settings and resources are managed by a **hybrid storage system**:
- **General Preferences & Dynamic Data**: Stored as JSON files in `AppData/Local` (managed by `SettingsManager`). This includes skill configurations, recorded routes, and task-specific toggles.
- **Sensitive Data (e.g., Passwords)**: Securely managed using Windows Credential Manager via `SecretManager`.
- **Resource Management & Static Config**: Managed by `YamlLoader` in `src/utils/config_loader.py`. It loads static configurations from `config/config.yaml` and **caches image resources** as `PIL.Image` objects for global use.

## Building and Running

### 1. Hardware Setup

- A board with the appropriate version of CircuitPython is required (e.g., Seeed Studio Xiao ESP32S3).
- Load the code from the `code/` directory onto the Xiao board.

### 2. Software Dependencies

**Important:** This project is designed for **Windows only**.

Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Key dependencies include `PySide6`, `qdarkstyle`, `pywin32`, `opencv-python`, `mss`, `Pillow`, `pynput`, `pyserial`, `keyring`, `pyyaml`, and `ai-edge-litert`.

### 3. Running the Application

To launch the graphical interface:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will open the "Guai Guai Automation Control Center". You can click buttons to start tasks and use the "STOP" button to interrupt them immediately.

## Architecture & Conventions

### Directory Structure
- `main.py`: **GUI Entry Point**. Initializes the `PySide6` application and hardware connection.
- `src/`: Core logic and task implementations.
    - `MapleScript.py`: Base class for all scripts. Includes minimap navigation (`move_to_point`), input handling, and hardware safety mechanisms.
    - `MapleGrind.py`: Automation for hunting/grinding. Supports stationary, route-based, and random wander modes with automatic origin return and boundary detection.
    - `RouteRecorder.py`: Tool for recording keyboard input sequences.
    - `DailyBoss.py`, `DailyPrepare.py`, `MonsterCollection.py`, `Storage.py`, `DancingMachine.py`: Specific task modules.
- `src/ui/`: Contains GUI-related code.
    - `app_window.py`: The main window layout and signal/slot logic.
    - `task_manager.py`: Manages background threads for script execution.
    - `grind_settings_dialog.py`: Specialized dialog for configuring grind skills and route recording.
    - `settings_dialog.py`, `hardware_setup_dialog.py`, `storage_settings_dialog.py`: Dialogs for system and task configuration.
- `src/utils/`: Shared utilities and helpers.
    - `xiao_controller.py`: Manages serial communication with the hardware.
    - `settings_manager.py`: Implements the hybrid storage system with path virtualization (`$APP_DATA$`).
    - `config_loader.py`: (`YamlLoader`) Loads static configurations from `config.yaml` and manages image resources.
    - `rune_detector.py`: AI-based rune arrow detection using TFLite.
    - `windows_object.py`: Window handle and state management.
    - `maple_vision.py`: Computer vision and minimap analysis.
- `code/`: CircuitPython code for the Xiao ESP32S3 hardware.
- `config/`: Static configuration files (`config.yaml`).
- `models/`: TFLite models and labels for AI tasks (e.g., `model_unquant.tflite`).
- `photos/`: Image templates for computer vision matching.
- `tools/`: Supplementary tools like `KeyLogger.py`.
