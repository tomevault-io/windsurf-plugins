# Zubridge Coding Patterns

## Rules
- Develop functions with a test-driven development mindset, ensuring each low-level function or method intended for reuse performs a single, atomic task, but avoid adding unnecessary abstration layers.

## Promise Handling
- Always await Promises; use `void` prefix if intentionally not awaiting
- Avoid floating promises to prevent unhandled rejections

## React Components
- Avoid default React import; use named imports only
- Prefer functional components over class components
- Follow React hooks rules (dependencies array, call only at top level)

## Restricted Patterns
- Avoid "barrel" files at the root of package subdirectories (like `packages/ui/src/components/Logger/index.ts`). Barrel files at the package root level (like `packages/ui/src/index.ts`) are acceptable.
- Prefer named export over export default

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations that might fail
- Provide appropriate error messages and fallbacks
