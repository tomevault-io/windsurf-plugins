## Project Structure & Module Organization

ACECode is a C++17 terminal AI coding agent with daemon, web UI, and optional desktop surfaces. The root [main.cpp](main.cpp) owns the terminal TUI entry point. Reusable logic lives under [src/](src) by subsystem, including `commands`, `config`, `daemon`, `desktop`, `history`, `markdown`, `memory`, `network`, `project_instructions`, `provider`, `session`, `skills`, `tool`, `tui`, `utils`, and `web`.

Unit tests live in [tests/](tests) and mirror source paths; for example, session storage code should be covered under `tests/session/`. Static model catalog assets are in [assets/models_dev/](assets/models_dev). User and subsystem docs live in [docs/](docs). Vendored or submodule code is under [external/](external). vcpkg overlay ports are under [ports/](ports).

Canonical root docs are [README.md](README.md), [README_CN.md](README_CN.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), this file, and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Keep the root small: do not reintroduce one-off status reports, root task lists, captured build logs, or duplicate project-instruction docs.

## Build, Test, And Development Commands

- `git submodule update --init --recursive`: fetch required submodules.
- `cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg-root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=<triplet> -DVCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS=$PWD/ports -DBUILD_TESTING=ON`: configure a testable build.
- `cmake --build build --config Release`: build the `acecode` executable.
- `cmake --build build --target acecode_unit_tests`: build the GoogleTest binary.
- `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure`: run the unit suite.
- `scripts/code_quality_check.sh` or `scripts/code_quality_check.bat`: run local quality checks for common DRY and error-handling issues.
- In [web/](web), run `pnpm install` once, `pnpm test` for JS tests, and `pnpm build` before configuring/building CMake when embedded frontend assets must be refreshed. See [web/README.md](web/README.md).
- Desktop shell is opt-in: configure with `-DACECODE_BUILD_DESKTOP=ON` and build `acecode-desktop`. The desktop target expects the daemon executable beside it at runtime.

## Architecture Boundaries

- Keep TUI-specific code in [main.cpp](main.cpp), [src/tui/](src/tui), and [src/markdown/](src/markdown). Put reusable, testable logic in the relevant `src/<subsystem>/` area or a focused top-level `src/*.cpp` helper when that is the existing local pattern.
- `acecode_testable` intentionally excludes the full TUI entry point and desktop WebView shell. Pure helpers can be added there and covered by unit tests.
- Daemon/API work usually touches [src/daemon/](src/daemon), [src/web/](src/web), and [src/session/](src/session). Update [docs/daemon-api.md](docs/daemon-api.md) when protocol behavior changes.
- React/Vite/Tailwind frontend work stays under [web/src/](web/src). Do not edit generated build output directly; regenerate it with the web build.
- Avoid modifying vendored or submodule trees such as [external/](external), `hermes-agent/`, or `claudecodehaha/` unless the task explicitly targets them.

## OpenSpec Workflow

For non-trivial behavior changes, create or continue an OpenSpec change under `openspec/changes/` before implementation. Use the repository's OpenSpec workflow commands or the local `openspec` CLI to propose, apply, and archive changes. During implementation, read the change context, complete tasks one by one, and update task checkboxes in the change's `tasks.md` immediately after each task is complete.

## Project-Level Agent Overrides

The Superpowers plugin is disabled for this repository. Do not invoke or follow `superpowers:*` skills, including `superpowers:using-superpowers`, unless the user explicitly re-enables Superpowers for a specific turn.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow [.editorconfig](.editorconfig): UTF-8, LF line endings, final newline, 4-space indentation for C++ and CMake, and 2-space indentation for JSON/YAML. Use C++17. Keep headers in `src/**/*.hpp` and implementations in matching `.cpp` files where practical. Name test files with the singular suffix `_test.cpp`; `tests/CMakeLists.txt` discovers that pattern automatically.

Prefer existing helpers such as `ToolArgsParser`, `ToolErrors`, path/session utilities, provider/model helpers, and web handler pure functions instead of duplicating parsing or validation logic.

This is a terminal UI project. Avoid emoji or ambiguous-width glyphs in C++ source, rendered UI, logs, and console output. Prefer ASCII or width-stable symbols already used in the codebase.
