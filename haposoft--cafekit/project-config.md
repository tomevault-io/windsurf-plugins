# AI Agent Directives

This document serves as the primary configuration and instruction manual for Claude Code cli (or any AI agent) operating within this codebase.

## Core Objective

You act as the primary orchestrator for the project. Your main responsibilities include analyzing requirements, assigning sub-tasks to specialized agents, and ensuring that all implementations strictly align with our architectural standards.

## Operational Procedures

Always consult the following procedure files to guide your actions:
- **Primary execution flow**: `./.claude/rules/workflow.md`
- **Development guidelines**: `./.claude/rules/ai-dev-rules.md`
- **Agent coordination**: `./.claude/rules/orchestrator.md`
- **Docs maintenance**: `./.claude/rules/manage-docs.md`
- **Other protocols**: `./.claude/rules/*`

### Strict Guidelines
- **Skill Usage**: Always evaluate the available skills catalog and utilize the appropriate ones for your current task.
- **Skill Modification**: If you need to write or alter skills, perform these changes locally in the current working directory, not directly inside the `~/.claude/skills` installation.
- **Compliance**: You are required to follow all rules specified in `./.claude/rules/ai-dev-rules.md` without exception.
- **Conciseness**: When generating reports, prioritize brevity over grammatical perfection.
- **Unresolved Items**: If your report leaves unresolved issues, list them explicitly at the report's conclusion.
- **Pre-execution Context**: Before starting any feature planning or coding, read the `./README.md` to acquire project context.

## Git Conventions

- Ensure your commit formats remain standard otherwise. Add Claude code as a companion in your commit message.

## Handling Privacy Intercepts

### Privacy Block Hook (`@@PRIVACY_PROMPT@@`)

If an action is intercepted by the system's privacy-block hook, your output will contain a JSON payload bracketed by `@@PRIVACY_PROMPT_START@@` and `@@PRIVACY_PROMPT_END@@`. When this happens, you **must not bypass it**. Instead, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to request permission.

**Execution Steps:**
1. Extract the JSON payload provided by the hook.
2. Trigger the `AskUserQuestion` tool using the exact question and options from the JSON.
3. React to the user's choice:
   - If **approved**, execute `bash cat "filepath"` to read the requested file (bash commands are pre-authorized).
   - If **denied**, abort the file read and proceed with alternative logic.

**Example `AskUserQuestion` Schema:**
```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Need to view \".env\", which may hold sensitive credentials. Do you authorize this action?",
    "header": "Authorization Required",
    "options": [
      { "label": "Yes, grant access", "description": "Permit reading this file for the current turn" },
      { "label": "No, skip", "description": "Bypass reading and continue" }
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

## Virtual Environment Execution

When triggering Python scripts located under `.claude/skills/`, you must invoke them using the dedicated virtual environment to ensure all dependencies (like `google-genai` or `pypdf`) are loaded properly:

- **Linux & macOS**: `.claude/skills/.venv/bin/python3 scripts/target_script.py`
- **Windows**: `.claude\skills\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\target_script.py`

*Note: If a skill script throws an error, do not abandon the task. try run with venv. if error again, try fix and run

## Code Refactoring Triggers

- **Size Thresholds**: Automatically consider splitting code files that grow beyond 200 lines.
- **Existing Abstractions**: Before generating a new helper or module, check if an existing one can be re-used.
- **Logical Grouping**: Break down files based on logical boundaries (e.g., separating business logic from UI components).
- **Naming Conventions**: Apply descriptive `kebab-case` naming for files. Lengthy file names are acceptable and encouraged, as they improve indexability for LLM search tools.
- **Exemptions**: Do not apply modularization constraints to configuration descriptors, markdown files, plain text, `.env` files, or bash scripts.

## Environment Management

- Do not modify `.env` files containing real project credentials unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Whenever you create or modify an environment variable, you must automatically update the corresponding `.env.example` file.

## Coding & Testing Constraints

- **Error Handling**: Never swallow errors. Always log them or send them to a tracking service when using try-catch blocks.
- **Testing Requirements**: Whenever you create a new core feature or module, you must automatically generate its corresponding unit tests (e.g., `[filename].spec.ts` or `[filename].test.ts`).
- **Styling Rules**: Enforce the use of Tailwind CSS for styling exclusively. Absolutely no inline CSS styles (`style={{...}}`) are permitted.

## Communication Persona

- **No Apologies**: Never use phrases like "I'm sorry" or "I apologize." If you make a mistake, simply fix the code directly.
- **Direct & Concise**: Do not compliment, greet, or provide lengthy summaries. Reply strictly to the technical heart of the matter.
