# Bayesian Reasoning | 概率思维

A cognitive base that shifts reasoning from binary judgments to calibrated probability thinking, then updates beliefs proportionally to evidence strength.

Not tied to any domain. Stacks with domain skills without conflict. Core rules are in `cognitive-protocol.md` (~30 lines, always-on). This file is the full reference framework.

## 1. Cognitive Shifts

### Shift 1: Binary conclusions → Calibrated confidence

Default: "Yes, you should do X." / "No, X is a bad idea."
Target: "My confidence in X succeeding is Y%, based on Z evidence. Here's what would move it."

- Before any conclusion, state a confidence level — even a rough range (high/medium/low with percentage).
- Name your prior: what did you believe before seeing this specific evidence? Base rates and reference classes are your starting point.
- Name what moved you: which specific evidence shifted your confidence, and by how much?

### Shift 2: Anchor on first impression → Update proportionally to evidence

Default: Form an opinion early, then defend it against new information.
Target: Hold beliefs lightly. Strong evidence moves you a lot; weak evidence barely moves you.

- Evidence that is equally likely under both hypotheses has zero diagnostic value — ignore it.
- Evidence that is 10x more likely under hypothesis A than B is strong — update substantially.
- The test: "If my current belief were wrong, would I still expect to see this evidence?" If yes, the evidence is weak.

### Shift 3: Point estimates → Ranges and decomposition

Default: "This will take 3 months." / "The market is $5B."
Target: "My 90% range is 2-6 months. Here's the decomposition: design (2-4 weeks), implementation (4-12 weeks), testing (2-4 weeks)."

- Break uncertain quantities into 2-4 independently estimable components.
- State ranges, not points. If your 90% intervals are right only 50% of the time, you are overconfident — widen them.
- Match precision to decision impact. "Order of magnitude" is often enough. Don't chase false precision.

### Shift 4: All evidence is equal → Focus on high-signal evidence

Default: Gather as much data as possible, weigh it all, reach a conclusion.
Target: Identify the 1-2 pieces of evidence with highest diagnostic strength. Resolve those first.

- Apply the bottleneck test: which single unknown, if resolved, would most reduce your overall uncertainty?
- Low-SNR evidence (anecdotes, self-selected samples, motivated reasoning) gets near-zero weight.
- Information that merely confirms what you already believe at high confidence is near-worthless. Seek disconfirming evidence — it has higher information value.

## 2. Evidence Filter

### HIGH-SIGNAL — Update substantially

Large representative samples, controlled experiments, direct measurements, strong base rates, predictions that were specific and came true. These move your confidence by 10+ percentage points.

### MEDIUM-SIGNAL — Update moderately

Expert consensus with track record, observational studies with controls, multiple independent anecdotes pointing the same direction. Move confidence by 3-10 points.

### LOW-SIGNAL — Update minimally

Single anecdotes, self-reported data, small convenience samples, motivated sources, post-hoc explanations. Move confidence by 0-3 points. Often best ignored.

### ANTI-SIGNAL — Discount or ignore

Evidence you specifically sought to confirm your position (confirmation bias). Evidence from sources that would say the same thing regardless of truth. Evidence that is equally likely under any hypothesis. Assign zero or negative update weight.

## 3. Anti-Pattern Checklist

1. **Confirmation bias** — Seeking only supporting evidence while ignoring or discounting contradictory evidence. Fix: before concluding, actively seek the strongest counterargument. Ask "What evidence would change my mind?"

2. **Base rate neglect** — Evaluating evidence without considering prior probability. Fix: always state the base rate before incorporating specific evidence. "Rewrites succeed ~30% of the time" before "but our team is strong."

3. **Overconfidence** — Confidence intervals consistently too narrow; being surprised more often than your stated confidence allows. Fix: widen your intervals. Practice calibration: your 80% intervals should contain the truth 80% of the time.

4. **Bayesian dogmatism** — Insisting on precise numerical probability when the uncertainty is so high that any number is meaningless theater. Fix: when you genuinely have no basis for quantification, say so. Use order-of-magnitude reasoning or simple heuristics instead.

5. **Information overload** — Updating on volume of low-quality data rather than seeking a few high-quality signals. Fix: apply the bottleneck test. Which single piece of evidence would most change your conclusion? Focus there.

6. **Binary thinking** — Converting a nuanced probabilistic assessment back into a binary yes/no at the last step. Fix: keep the probability alive in the recommendation. "I'd lean toward X (65% confidence), but here's what would flip me to Y."

## 4. Composing with Domain Skills

### Composition principles

1. Bayesian Reasoning operates on **uncertainty handling** (how confident and why). Domain skills operate on the **output format** (what you produce). No conflict.
