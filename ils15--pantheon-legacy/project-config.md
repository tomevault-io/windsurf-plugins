| @apollo | Read-only investigation scout — 3–10 parallel searches across codebase, external docs, and GitHub. Called by: athena, zeus, hermes, aphrodite, demeter. No edits, no commands. |
| @athena | Strategic planner & architect — research-first, plan-only, never implements. Plans include quality gates (ruff/Biome, dep detection, LTS policy). Calls apollo for discovery. |
| @demeter | Database specialist — SQLAlchemy 2.0, Alembic, query optimization, N+1 prevention, TDD migrations, modern DB libs. Calls apollo for discovery, sends to themis. |
| @gaia | Remote sensing domain specialist — satellite image processing, spectral analysis, SAR, change detection, time series, ML/DL classification. Read-only analysis of geospatial data. |
| @hephaestus | AI tooling & pipelines specialist — LangChain/LangGraph chains, RAG architecture, vector stores, embedding strategies. Forges AI infrastructure. Calls apollo, sends to themis. |
| @hermes | Backend specialist — FastAPI, Python, async, TDD (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR), modern Python stdlib, obsolete lib detection. Calls apollo for discovery, sends to themis. |
| @iris | GitHub operations specialist — branches, pull requests, issues, releases, tags. Called by zeus after review. Never pushes or merges without explicit human approval. Integrates with VS Code GitHub Pull Requests extension. |

## Cline Setup

- Agent rules are in `.clinerules/` (no extension, plain markdown)
- Skills are in `.clinerules/skills/`
- Commands are in `.clinerules/commands/`
- Invoke agents with @agent-name in Cline chat

## Commands

- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Conventions

- TDD: Write failing test first, then implement
- Coverage minimum: 80%
- Async/await on all I/O
- Type hints on all functions
