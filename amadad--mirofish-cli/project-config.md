## What this is

MiroFish — CLI social simulation engine. Feed documents + a requirement, get a multi-agent social media simulation with report, verdict, and visual snapshots. Designed to be invoked by agents via the `mirofish` skill.

Fork of [666ghj/MiroFish](https://github.com/666ghj/MiroFish), fully translated to English.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync                                    # install
mirofish run --files f.pdf --requirement "..." --json   # run pipeline
mirofish runs list --json                  # list runs (slim: run_id, status, created_at, artifact_count)
mirofish runs status <id> --json           # full manifest for a run
mirofish runs export <id> --json           # export artifacts
mirofish --help                            # always works even with invalid/missing .env
uv run python -m pytest -x                 # tests
```

## Architecture

CLI (`cli.py`) orchestrates via `WorkbenchSession` which composes tools:
1. `GenerateOntologyTool` — LLM entity/relationship extraction from documents
2. `BuildGraphTool` — ontology → JSON graph (with entity validation against ontology types)
3. `PrepareSimulationTool` — agent profile generation (capped at 150 words)
4. `RunSimulationTool` — OASIS subprocess (Twitter + Reddit)
5. `GenerateReportTool` — single-pass report generation
6. Verdict generation — LLM extracts structured `verdict.json` from report

Each run produces an immutable directory under `uploads/runs/<run_id>/` with manifest, frozen inputs, graph, simulation data, report, verdict, SVG visuals, and logs.

### Key output: `report/verdict.json`

Machine-readable verdict for agent consumption — prediction, confidence (0-1), key_dynamics, and signals array. Agents should read this first, then `report/summary.json`, then `report/report.md` only if deeper analysis needed.

## Config

`.env` file at repo root. Key vars:
- `LLM_PROVIDER` — `claude-cli` (default) or `codex-cli`. Validated at `main()` startup — any other value (including `openai`) exits 1 with `config error: LLM_PROVIDER must be 'claude-cli' or 'codex-cli'`. `--help` / `--version` skip validation so metadata commands always work.

## Agent Integration

Skill file: `~/agents/_skills/mirofish/SKILL.md`
Symlinked into `.claude/skills/` for discovery by Claude Code and OpenClaw agents.

## Gotchas
- `mirofish runs list` returns a slim summary (`run_id`, `status`, `created_at`, `artifact_count`) so agent output stays narrow. Use `runs status <run_id>` for the full manifest.
- `Config.validate()` runs at `main()` startup before argparse. An invalid `LLM_PROVIDER` (e.g. `openai` left in `.env`) now fails fast with exit 1 instead of silently dying at the first LLM call. `--help` / `-h` / `--version` bypass the check.
- `cli_display.PipelineDisplay` honors `NO_COLOR` and `sys.stdout.isatty()` when constructing the Rich `Console`, so piped / non-tty invocations stay plain.
- Simulation runs OASIS in a subprocess via `scripts/`. The scripts add the project root to `sys.path` to import from `app.utils.oasis_llm`.
- `camel-oasis==0.2.5` and `camel-ai==0.2.78` are pinned — upgrading either can break the simulation pipeline.
- LLM calls have automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts).
- CLI display (`cli_display.py`) uses `rich.Live` on stderr. Suppresses service-layer logs to WARNING during display. `--json` mode bypasses rich entirely.
- Never trash `uploads/runs/` — run artifacts are the product. Each run is immutable and self-contained.
- Process cleanup: `atexit` handler terminates OASIS subprocesses on CLI exit.
