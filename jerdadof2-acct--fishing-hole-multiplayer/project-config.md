# component-dataflow

Primary data flows connect the following core systems:

## Water Simulation → Fishing Mechanics
- `src/water/waterBodyTypes.js` provides physical water properties that affect:
  - Fish behavior patterns
  - Fishing line physics
  - Casting trajectory calculations
- Flow importance: 85/100

## Fishing Rod → Water Physics
- `src/fishing/rod.js` calculates rod tip deformation which feeds into:
  - Line entry point calculations
  - Water surface interaction physics  
  - Wave pattern disturbances
- Flow importance: 80/100

## Camera System → Rod Aiming
- `src/camera/cameraSpring.js` tracking data influences:
  - Rod positioning constraints
  - Casting arc visualization
  - Target zone calculations
- Flow importance: 75/100

## Rod Aiming → Water Material
- `src/fishing/aimRod.js` targeting data affects:
  - Water surface rendering at target point
  - Depth-based color transitions
  - Wave pattern modifications
- Flow importance: 70/100

Core State Management:
1. Water Body State
- Current flow direction/speed
- Wave pattern configuration
- Turbidity and visibility levels
- Light absorption properties

2. Fishing State  
- Rod tension and flexibility
- Line entry point and angles
- Cast trajectory and power
- Target zone position

3. Camera State
- Spring dampening values
- Target tracking position
- Water level constraints
- View angle limits
