# Branch protection

- `main` is protected: requires PR, merge queue, status checks, and **verified commit signatures**.
- All commits must be signed. Unsigned commits will block PR merges.
- Never push directly to `main`.
- Never push to fork branches. If a PR comes from a fork, only leave review comments.

# Environment

Default branch is `main` (not `master`). Use `--base main` for PRs.

Dependencies are managed by `uv`. Never use `pip install`.
To read botocore source, find the installed path with
`python3 -c "import botocore; print(botocore.__file__)"`,
then read files directly — do not use `inspect.getsource()`.

# Pre-commit checks

Run before committing:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all --show-diff-on-failure
```

Key constraints:

- YAML lines must be ≤120 chars (`# yamllint disable-line rule:line-length` for exceptions)
- All workflow jobs must have `timeout-minutes`
- Python code formatted with `ruff`

# Tests

```bash
uv run pytest -sv tests/<path>           # run specific tests
uv run make mototest                     # moto-based tests (CI runs these)
uv run pytest -sv tests/test_patches.py  # hash validation
```

## Test directory structure

- `tests/` — aiobotocore-specific tests (parametrized with aiohttp+httpx via conftest.py)
- `tests/botocore_tests/` — tests ported from botocore (not parametrized with HTTP backends)

# Versioning

**Don't bump `aiobotocore/__init__.py` and don't edit `CHANGES.rst` in feature PRs.**
Both are owned by the AI-drafted release flow:

- `.github/workflows/draft-release.yml` (manual trigger) summarizes merged PRs
  since the last tag, computes the next version, writes the changelog entry,
  and opens a `Release vX.Y.Z` PR.
- `.github/workflows/auto-release-on-merge.yml` runs when that PR merges:
  creates the tag, drafts the GitHub Release, and the existing tag-push CI
  publishes to PyPI.

For your feature PR to land in the changelog cleanly, write a
Conventional-Commits-style title (`fix:`, `feat:`, `BREAKING:`, `docs:`,
`ci:`, `chore:`, `test:`) and a one-paragraph body describing the
user-visible effect. The bump rule keys off these:

- any `BREAKING:` or `breaking` label → MAJOR
- any `feat:` or `enhancement`/`feature` label → MINOR
- otherwise → PATCH

The `update-botocore-bounds` skill (the only thing the automated
`botocore-sync` workflow runs today, formerly named `bump-version`)
only updates `pyproject.toml` bounds and `uv.lock` — `__init__.py`
and `CHANGES.rst` are off-limits to per-PR automation.

# Overriding botocore code

When adding or modifying an override, update `tests/test_patches.py` with the SHA1 hash of the
overridden botocore function. See the existing entries and `CONTRIBUTING.rst` "Hashes of Botocore
Code" for details.

# AI workflow conventions

These rules apply to the Claude-driven GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/*-prompt.md`). They do
not apply to humans editing the repo directly.

- **Signed commits via MCP:** workflow runs must use `mcp__github_file_ops__commit_files` for
  every commit. It creates signed commits attributed to `claude[bot]`; plain `git commit`
  produces unsigned commits that block PR merges.
- **Branches:** always use the `claude/` prefix for branches created by the bot. Never push to
  `main` — it is protected.
- **Committing to a branch from a workflow:** `mcp__github_file_ops__commit_files` takes only
  `files` and `message`. It has **no branch argument** — passing `branch:` or `ref:` is silently
  ignored. The target comes from the `CLAUDE_BRANCH` env var on the action step, read once when
  the MCP server starts. Unset, it falls back to `GITHUB_REF_NAME`, so a `workflow_dispatch` run
  on `main` commits to `main` and is rejected by branch protection ("Changes must be made through
  the merge queue / pull request"). So: **set `CLAUDE_BRANCH: claude/<name>` in the step's `env:`**
  (see `draft-release.yml`). Don't pre-create the ref — the tool creates the branch off
  `BASE_BRANCH` on first commit. Conversely it *reuses* the branch if it already exists, so
  prefer a name scoped per *attempt* —
  `claude/release-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}` — over one a failed attempt
  could have left behind with commits on it. `run_id` alone is not enough: it stays the same
  across re-runs, so a retry would land on the failed attempt's branch.
  Do **not** fall back to `git push` — workflow checkouts use `persist-credentials: false`, so it
  fails with "could not read Username", and a runner-side `git commit` is unsigned (no key on the
  runner), which blocks the merge.
- **What actually signs a bot commit:** GitHub signs any commit created through its API with the
  workflow token's identity. `commit_files` is a thin wrapper over `POST /git/blobs`,
  `POST /git/trees`, `POST /git/commits`, `PATCH /git/refs/heads/<branch>` — there is no signing
  key or GPG step in it. So the MCP tool is the *convenient* path, not a magic one: the same four
  `gh api` calls produce an identically verified commit (that fallback drafted v3.7.1 — commit
  `cc8814f6`, `verified: true`). Prefer the MCP tool; if it's ever blocked, the `gh api` git-data
  route is a legitimate escape hatch. Only `git push` is off-limits.
