# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ShellCon is an educational full-stack smart aquarium management system designed for learning Rust and Shuttle Cloud deployment. The project includes a React frontend dashboard and three Rust microservices that form a complete aquarium monitoring ecosystem.

## Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture with:

**Backend Services** (located in `shellcon-backend/services/`):
- `aqua-monitor` (port 8000): Environmental sensor readings and tank monitoring
- `species-hub` (port 8001): Species database and feeding schedules  
- `aqua-brain` (port 8002): Analytics engine for tank health analysis

**Frontend** (located in `shellcon-frontend/`):
- React + Vite dashboard with TypeScript
- Uses shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- Connects to all three backend services via REST APIs

## Development Commands

### Backend Services
Each Rust service uses Shuttle for local development and deployment:

```bash
# Run individual services locally (from service directory)
cd shellcon-backend/services/aqua-monitor && shuttle run --port 8000
cd shellcon-backend/services/species-hub && shuttle run --port 8001  
cd shellcon-backend/services/aqua-brain && shuttle run --port 8002

# Deploy to Shuttle Cloud (from service directory)
shuttle deploy

# View service logs
shuttle logs --latest
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd shellcon-frontend

# Install dependencies (first time)
npm install

# Development servers for different environments
npm run dev:localhost    # Points to localhost:8000-8002
npm run dev:prod        # Points to deployed Shuttle services

# Build and lint
npm run build
npm run lint
```

## DevContainer Setup

A DevContainer configuration is available for Docker-based development environments. The setup includes:

- Pre-configured Rust development environment with Microsoft's official container
- Node.js 20 for frontend development  
- Docker-in-Docker support via DevContainer features
- VS Code extensions for Rust development
- Automatic Shuttle CLI installation via postCreateCommand

### Docker-in-Docker Database Connectivity

**Important**: The DevContainer includes a fix for Shuttle's database connectivity in Docker-in-Docker scenarios. When Shuttle runs locally with a database, it provisions a PostgreSQL container with a connection string using `localhost`. However, inside a dev container, `localhost` points to the container itself, not the host where the database container runs.

The DevContainer configuration includes:
```json
"runArgs": [
  "--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
]
```

This maps the container's default bridge gateway to `host.docker.internal`, allowing the Shuttle services to reach the host-provisioned database containers. This resolves the connectivity issue without requiring manual database provisioning.

### Using the DevContainer

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. When prompted, select "Reopen in Container" or use Command Palette → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" 
3. **First time setup** (30 seconds): Run `./.devcontainer/setup-node.sh` to install Node.js 20
4. Run `shuttle login` to authenticate
5. Follow normal development workflow with `shuttle run` commands

**Fast startup**: The DevContainer now starts in ~15 seconds with minimal extensions, then you can install Node.js only when needed for frontend development.

## Challenge System

The project includes 4 performance optimization challenges embedded in the Rust services:

1. **Challenge 1** (`aqua-monitor/src/challenges.rs::get_tank_readings`): Async I/O optimization
2. **Challenge 2** (`species-hub/src/challenges.rs::get_species`): SQL query optimization  
3. **Challenge 3** (`aqua-brain/src/challenges.rs::get_analysis_result`): String allocation optimization
4. **Challenge 4** (`aqua-monitor/src/challenges.rs::get_sensor_status`): HTTP client resource pooling

Each challenge has validation endpoints that check implementation patterns in the source code. Solutions must be implemented within the marked `// ⚠️ CHALLENGE` code blocks.

## Environment Configuration

Frontend supports multiple environment configurations via `.env` files:

- `.env.localhost` - Used with `npm run dev:localhost` for local backend services
- `.env.prod` - Used with `npm run dev:prod` for deployed Shuttle services

Required environment variables:
```
VITE_AQUA_MONITOR_URL=http://localhost:8000 (or deployed URL)
VITE_SPECIES_HUB_URL=http://localhost:8001 (or deployed URL)  
VITE_AQUA_BRAIN_URL=http://localhost:8002 (or deployed URL)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
```

## Key Technical Details

- **Database**: Each service uses PostgreSQL via Shuttle's shared database feature
- **HTTP Framework**: All services use Axum with tower-http for CORS and tracing
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio for all async operations
- **Tracing**: Structured logging with tracing crate and correlation IDs
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types implementing IntoResponse for consistent API responses
- **Frontend State**: React Query for API state management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
