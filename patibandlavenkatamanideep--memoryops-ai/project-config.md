# AGENTS.md — MemoryOps AI working notes

> The authoritative product/architecture brief is [CLAUDE_ENTERPRISE.md](CLAUDE_ENTERPRISE.md).
> This file is the short operational guide for working in the repo.

## What this is

MemoryOps AI is a governed memory lifecycle system for AI assistants — not a chatbot with memory.
The lifecycle is: **Capture → Evaluate → Store → Retrieve → Rank → Compose → Update → Forget → Audit**,
wrapped by Security, Governance, Observability, Reliability, Evaluation planes.

## Non-negotiable invariants (enforced in code + tests)

1. Tenant isolation — every memory query filters by `tenant_id` + `user_id`.
2. Deletion guarantee — `status='deleted'` rows are never retrieved.
3. Provenance — every memory has a non-null `source`.
4. Graceful degradation — retrieval failures never block responses.
5. Policy-before-storage — the policy broker runs before any write.
6. Temporary chat — `temporary_chat=true` writes/reads nothing.
7. Auditability — every lifecycle action appends an audit event.

## Layout

- `services/api` — FastAPI. Write path lives in `app/services/` (extractor, policy_broker,
  write_service) and is orchestrated by `app/services/gateway.py`. Read path:
  `app/services/{retriever,ranker,context_composer}.py`.
- `services/api/app/embeddings` — swappable `EmbeddingProvider` (stub default + optional OpenAI).
  `MEMORYOPS_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=stub|openai`. `app/core/embeddings.py` is a back-compat shim.
- `services/api/app/compression` — optional context compression at the LLM boundary
  (`MEMORYOPS_CONTEXT_COMPRESSION=none|headroom`). `NoopCompressor` is the default;
  `HeadroomCompressor` is optional and degrades to no-op. Runs **after** policy/governance/
  composition, never before the policy broker. See ADR-007.
- `services/api/app/llm` — provider-neutral LLM layer (v0.4). Swappable `LLMProvider`
  (`StubProvider` default + optional OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini), schema-validated structured
  output, prompt registry, heuristic fallback. `MEMORYOPS_LLM_PROVIDER=stub|openai|anthropic|gemini`
  (default `stub`). Powers structured extraction + conflict detection. LLM output is
  **advisory** — the policy broker stays authoritative and is never bypassed; tests need
  no API keys. See ADR-008.
- `services/api/app/workers` — background memory lifecycle workers (v0.6–v0.7). Off the chat
  request path. Six jobs (decay, archive, deletion_compaction, deletion_verification,
  conflict_scan, reflection — off by default) driven by `runner.py`
  (`python -m app.workers.runner --tenant T --user U --job all`). Tenant scoped, idempotent,
  retry-safe, audited; never resurrect deleted memory; the policy broker stays authoritative.
  `deletion_compaction` (v0.7) clears soft-deleted memory's content + vector material after a
  retention window, preserves the governance tombstone, and verifies the purge fail-closed —
  not crypto-shred, no physical disk/index reclamation claim. Hosted by the Railway `worker`
  service (scope enumeration is the orchestrator's job). See ADR-010, ADR-011,
  `docs/background-lifecycle-workers.md`, `docs/deletion-compaction.md`,
  `docs/vector-purge-verification.md`, `docs/deletion-verification.md`.
  v0.8 worker runtime (`orchestrator.py`/`scheduler.py`/`locks.py`/`retry.py`):
  the `worker` service runs the scheduler over explicit `MEMORYOPS_WORKER_SCOPES`,
  leased (duplicate runs prevented), retried with backoff, dead-lettered on
  exhausted retries, with persisted run history (`worker_runs`, migration 006) and
  worker health at `GET /healthz/workers`. See ADR-012, `docs/worker-runtime.md`.
- `services/api/app/db` — repository abstraction. `MEMORYOPS_STORAGE=memory|postgres`. Vector
  retrieval goes through `Repository.search_candidates` (pgvector on Postgres, cosine in memory).
- `infra/db/migrations` — SQL schema (Postgres + pgvector). RLS is **enforced** in
  `004_rls_policies.sql` (`FORCE` + tenant policy); verify with `scripts/check_rls_policies.py`. See ADR-006.
- `apps/web` — Next.js frontend. v0.5 adds the **memory control plane**:
  `/memories`, `/memories/[id]`, `/governance`, `/audit`, with reusable components
  under `components/{memories,governance,audit}`. It is a read + audited-action
  surface only — every action maps 1:1 to an audited backend route and never
  writes around the policy broker. Backend additions are read-only
  (`GET /api/memories/{id}`, `/{id}/provenance`, `/{id}/audit`) plus a `memory_id`
  filter on `list_audit`/`/api/audit`. See ADR-009,
  `docs/governance-ui.md`, `docs/memory-control-plane.md`.
- `evals` — golden + adversarial cases, `run_evals.py`.

## Running

```bash
# API (no infra):
cd services/api && pip install -r requirements.txt && \
  MEMORYOPS_STORAGE=memory uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Tests:
cd services/api && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest -q

# Full stack:
docker compose up --build
```

## Deployment workflow (Railway-only — v0.3.2)

Deployment target is **Railway only**. Do **not** add or suggest a Vercel path.
One project (`memoryops-ai`), five services: `memoryops-web`, `memoryops-api`,
`memoryops-worker`, Railway Postgres (+pgvector), Railway Redis.

- Config-as-code lives in `railway/{api,web,worker}.railway.json`; point each
