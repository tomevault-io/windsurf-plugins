# AI Agent Instructions for Plugboard

This document provides guidelines for AI coding agents working on the Plugboard project. Following these instructions ensures contributions are consistent with the project's architecture, conventions, and style.

## Project Overview

Plugboard is an event-driven framework in Python for simulating and orchestrating complex processes with interconnected stateful components. Typical users are data scientists and engineers.

### Core Architecture

**Component**: The fundamental building block for modeling logic (see `plugboard/component/`).
- Lifecycle: `__init__` → `init` → `step` (repeated) → `destroy`.
- I/O declaration: Use class-level `io: IOController` attribute. Use this to specify inputs, outputs and events associated with a component.
- Business logic: Implement in the `step` method.
- Asynchronous: All lifecycle methods (`init`, `step`, `destroy`) must be `async`.

**Process**: Orchestrates execution of components (see `plugboard/process/`)
- Manages collections of components and their interconnections.
- `LocalProcess`: Runs all components in a single process.
- Supports distributed execution via other process types, e.g. `RayProcess`.

**Connector**: Defines communication channels between components (see `plugboard/connector/`).
- Links outputs to inputs: `component_name.output_name` → `component_name.input_name`.
- Various connector types available for different execution contexts.

**State Management**: Tracks component and process status (see `plugboard/state/`).
- Critical for monitoring and distributed execution.
- Uses `StateBackend` abstraction.

**Configuration**: Flexible process definition.
- Python-based: Direct component instantiation.
- YAML-based: Declarative configuration for CLI execution (`plugboard process run ...`).
- Relies on the Pydantic objects defined in `plugboard-schemas`.

## Development Environment

### Setup
- **Package Manager**: Uses `uv` for dependency management.
- **Dependencies**: Defined in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.12 or higher.

### Testing
- You can delegate to the `test` agent in `.github/agents` to update/add tests.
- **Framework**: `pytest`
- **Location**: `tests/` directory
- **Commands**:
  - `uv run pytest tests/path/to/tests` to run a specific test file or folder.
  - `make test` - Run all tests.
  - `make test-integration` - Run integration tests.
- **Best Practice**: Always include tests with new features.

### Linting & Formatting
- You can delegate to the `lint` agent in `.github/agents` to resolve linting issues.
- **Tools**: 
  - `ruff` - Formatting and linting.
  - `mypy` - Static type checking.
- **Commands**:
  - `make lint` - Check for issues.
  - `make format` - Auto-format code.
- **Requirement**: All code must be fully type-annotated.

### CLI
- **Framework**: Built with `typer`.
- **Location**: `plugboard/cli/`.
- **Usage**: `plugboard --help`.

## Code Standards

### Async Pattern
- Entire framework built on `asyncio`.
- All I/O operations must be async.
- All component lifecycle methods must be async.

### Dependency Injection
- Uses `that-depends` for DI.
- Container setup: `plugboard/utils/DI.py`.
- Access logger: `self._logger = DI.logger.resolve_sync().bind(...)`.

### Data Structures
- Prefer immutable structures: `msgspec.Struct(frozen=True)`.
- Use Pydantic models for validation where needed.

### Components
When creating components:
1. Inherit from `plugboard.component.Component`.
2. Always call `super().__init__()` in `__init__`.
3. Declare I/O via class-level `io` attribute.
4. Implement required async methods.
5. Use type hints throughout.

Example:
```python
import typing as _t
from plugboard.component import Component, IOController as IO
from plugboard.schemas import ComponentArgsDict

class MyComponent(Component):
    io = IO(inputs=["input_a"], outputs=["output_x"])
    
    def __init__(
        self, 
        param: float = 1.0, 
        **kwargs: _t.Unpack[ComponentArgsDict]
    ) -> None:
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self._param = param
    
    async def step(self) -> None:
        # Business logic here
        self.output_x = self.input_a * self._param
```

### Events
- Event system for component communication.
- Define events by inheriting from `plugboard.events.Event`.
- Add handlers with `@Event.handler` decorator.
- Emit events via `self.io.queue_event()` or return from handlers.

## Best Practices

1. **Minimal Changes**: Make surgical, focused changes.
2. **Type Safety**: Maintain full type annotations.
3. **Testing**: Add tests for new functionality.
4. **Documentation**: Update docstrings and docs for public APIs. You can delegate to the `docs` agent in `.github/agents` to maintain the project documentation.
5. **Async Discipline**: Never use blocking I/O operations.
6. **Immutability**: Prefer immutable data structures.
7. **Logging**: Use structured logging via `structlog`.
8. **Error Handling**: Use appropriate exception types from `plugboard.exceptions`.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Component
1. Create class inheriting from `Component`.
