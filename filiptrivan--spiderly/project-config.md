# SpiderlyDataTableComponent

Wraps PrimeNG v19 `<p-table>` and exposes Spiderly's column-based filter / sort / pagination model. Notes for anyone editing the component or designing `Column<T>[]` configurations in consumer code.

## Custom toolbar actions — `<ng-template spiderlyDataTableActions>`

Consumers add their own toolbar buttons/markup by projecting an `<ng-template spiderlyDataTableActions>` (the `SpiderlyDataTableActionsDirective` marker). The component picks it up via `@ContentChild(SpiderlyDataTableActionsDirective, { read: TemplateRef })` and renders it with `*ngTemplateOutlet` at the **start** of the caption's right-side action row — `*ngIf`-guarded so an un-projected slot renders nothing (no stray flex gap).

- **Rendered before the built-ins on purpose.** Delete Selected is conditional, so trailing custom buttons would shift when selection toggles. Leading keeps them positionally stable. If you reorder the caption, keep the outlet first.
- **No context is passed** to the template (it binds to the consumer's component). This is deliberate: lazy-load selection has no clean flat-id representation (`newlySelectedItems`/`unselectedItems` under select-all). If a future need appears, add `ngTemplateOutletContext` keys — that's non-breaking, existing templates ignore unknown `let-` vars.
- The contract is covered by `spiderly-data-table.component.spec.ts` (the library's TestBed suite; runs via the `Unit Tests (Angular)` CI job, `karma.conf.js` → `ChromeHeadlessNoSandbox`).

## `showMatchModes` defaults to false on every column

The match-mode `<p-select>` rendered next to text/numeric/date filter inputs is gated by **two** conditions in PrimeNG (`*ngIf="showMatchModes && matchModes"`). Spiderly always supplies `matchModeOptions` (`matchModeNumberOptions`, `matchModeDateOptions`), so the second condition is satisfied — but the binding `[showMatchModes]="col.showMatchModes"` resolves to `undefined` when a column omits the flag, and PrimeNG's `booleanAttribute` coerces that to `false`. Net effect: the dropdown does not render and the column filters with the default match mode (`Equals` for numeric, `Contains` for text) only.

To let the user pick a match mode, set `showMatchModes: true` on the column. Example:

```typescript
{ name: t('CreatedAt'), filterType: 'date', field: 'createdAt', showMatchModes: true }
```

## Match-mode labels are runtime translations

`matchModeNumberOptions` / `matchModeDateOptions` populate `label` from `translocoService.translate(...)`, so the user-visible option text is the **value** in `assets/i18n/<locale>.json`, not the key. For English:

| `MatchModeCodes` | translation key | rendered label |
|---|---|---|
| `Equals` | `Equals` | `Equals` |
| `LessThan` | `LessThan` | `Less than` |
| `GreaterThan` | `MoreThan` | `More than` |
| (date) | `OnDate` | `On date` |
| (date) | `DatesBefore` | `Dates before` |
| (date) | `DatesAfter` | `Dates after` |

When matching options programmatically (e2e tests, conditional logic), match against the rendered label, not the key. Renaming the key without updating en.json or vice versa silently breaks consumers that match by label.

## Filter-state persistence

`@Input() stateKey?: string` plus `@Input() stateStorage: 'session' | 'local' = 'session'` light up PrimeNG's stateful-table behavior. When `hasLazyLoad` is true, `ngOnInit` derives `resolvedStateKey` from `router.url` (plus `additionalFilterIdLong` to disambiguate parent-child views). Consumers don't normally pass `stateKey` — leave it auto-derived. The `clear(table)` method also calls `table.clearState()` so the "Clear all filters" caption button wipes the persisted state instead of just resetting the in-memory table.

## Per-cell click — `Column.onCellClick`

Set `onCellClick?: (e: CellClickEvent) => void` on a column to make *its* value cells clickable (the mirror of `Action.onClick`, but for plain value cells rather than the actions column). Implementation notes for editing this component:

- **`td.clickable` is the affordance.** Opted-in cells get `cursor: pointer` + hover via the `td.clickable` rule in this component's SCSS — `.clickable` was previously declared on rows but never styled, so the rule is new.
- **Fires on display cells only** — text/numeric/date/boolean/`blob`. Editable cells (`col.editable`) are excluded; that cell belongs to its inline input.
- **Swallows row navigation.** The handler calls `event.stopPropagation()`, so on a `navigateOnRowClick` table an opted-in cell runs *its* handler instead of navigating. (On non-navigating tables this is a harmless no-op.)
- **`CellClickEvent` captures `element` synchronously on purpose.** It's the clicked `<td>`; we grab it at dispatch time because `originalEvent.currentTarget` nulls once dispatch ends, so it's already null by the time an async handler's HTTP response resolves. (`element` is a superset addition over `ActionClickEvent`'s, alongside `field`, `value` (raw) and `displayValue` (formatted).)
