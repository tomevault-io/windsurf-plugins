## What is Spiderly

Spiderly is a .NET 9 + Angular 19 code generator. It reads EF Core entity classes decorated with custom attributes and generates: CRUD UI (Angular), API controllers, services, DTOs, mappers, FluentValidation rules, Angular validators, TypeScript entity classes, and more. Users extend generated base classes with custom logic.

Spiderly is a fast-moving startup — no backward compatibility needed. Make breaking changes freely.

## Config ↔ options binding is a reflective contract — guard it

`appsettings` is bound to options classes (`EmailOptions`, `JwtOptions`, …) **reflectively at runtime**, with no compile-time link. So a shape mismatch between the documented config and the options type binds **silently** to a default/empty value and only fails much later at first use. This actually shipped: `EmailSender` became a `{ Email, Name }` object in code, but the JSON schema + an existing consumer's `appsettings` still had it as a **string** → bound to an empty `EmailSender` (`Email == null`) → 500 "sender is missing" on the first login email, latent for weeks.

When you add/refactor an option:
- Update **all** of: the options class, the `spiderly init` template's emitted `appsettings`, **`schemas/appsettings.schema.json`**, and any consumer config. The schema and existing configs are the ones that silently drift.
- Add a **`ValidateOnStart` guard** in `StartupExtensions.AddSpiderly` for config that is *required when a feature is enabled* (mirror the `JwtKey` / `EmailSender.Email` checks) so a missing/empty value **fails loudly at boot**, not at first use. `ValidateOnStart` validates *values*, not *shape* — a wrong-shape binding produces an empty default and passes unless you assert the value.
- Lock the shape with a binding test in `Spiderly.Shared.Tests/OptionsBindingTests.cs` (bind a representative `appsettings` to the options, assert required fields populate).

### Versioning

`X.Y.Z` (stable) or `X.Y.Z-preview.N` (preview). All packages share the same version. Stored in each `.csproj` `<Version>` tag, `Angular/projects/spiderly/package.json`, `spiderly-cli/package.json`, and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (`plugins[0].version`). These are bumped together by `.github/workflows/release.yml` — do not hand-edit.

**Version bumps happen at publish time, not during refactors.** Don't bump the version as part of a feature or refactor PR — even for breaking changes. The human owns release cadence and decides when to cut a new version.

User-facing version upgrades (consumer apps moving from one Spiderly release to another) are handled by the `spiderly-upgrade` skill — see `claude-plugins/skills/spiderly-upgrade/SKILL.md`.

## Documentation updates

When Spiderly code changes affect public API, attributes, generated output, or behavior — update the documentation in the `spiderly-website/` sibling repo accordingly.

## API error codes

`ApiErrorCodes` (returned as `ApiErrorDTO.errorCode`) is a cross-language public contract. Three mirrors must stay in sync whenever a code is added, removed, or renamed:

1. `Spiderly.Shared/Contracts/ApiErrorCodes.cs` — canonical C# source.
2. `Angular/projects/spiderly/src/lib/errors/api-error-codes.ts` — admin consumers.
3. Downstream TS mirrors in any consuming app (e.g. a storefront's `api-error.ts`).

`ApiErrorCodes` lives under `Spiderly.Shared.Contracts` because it is a static constants class, not a DTO.

## Coding conventions

- Prefer raw string literals (`$$""" """`) for multiline strings in C#
- Enum types are conventionally named with a `...Codes` suffix (e.g., `StatusCodes`, `UIControlTypeCodes`) — convention only, not enforced; `[SpiderlyEnum]` is what marks an enum for code generation
- `bool?` (nullable) is **recommended** for checkbox properties — non-nullable `bool` is supported but `bool?` is preferred in most cases. Treat `null` as `false` in business logic
- All public members in shipped packages (`Spiderly.Shared`, `Spiderly.Security`, `Spiderly.Infrastructure`) must have `/// <summary>` XML doc comments — never plain `//` comments as documentation. Generated methods that end users can override (virtual hooks) should also include `<example>` showing usage
- **Database table names are singular** — matching the entity class name exactly (e.g., `Category` class → `"Category"` table, not `"Categories"`). This is because Spiderly registers entities via `modelBuilder.Entity()` without `DbSet<T>` properties, so EF Core uses the class name as-is
- **Hand-written classes require classification attributes.** Source generators enroll classes by marker attribute, not by namespace suffix:
  - Entities → `[SpiderlyEntity]`
  - M2M junction classes → `[M2M]` **and** `[SpiderlyEntity]` (both required — `[M2M]` flags the junction; `[SpiderlyEntity]` enrolls it for generation)
  - Hand-written DTOs → `[SpiderlyDTO]` (generated DTOs like `{Entity}DTO` / `{Entity}SaveBodyDTO` / `{Entity}MainUIFormDTO` need no attribute)
  - Custom controllers → `[SpiderlyController]`
