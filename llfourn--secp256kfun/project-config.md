- run cargo fmt and clippy before running `git commit`
- Do not make code comments that explain *what* is happening. Only explain *why* something is being done.
- When making a PR, include conversation history in PR description using `<details><summary>Conversation History</summary>...</details>`. Only include prompts/responses that had significant impact on the PR's implementation - skip meta discussions about git/PRs.
