# Project: Multi-Agent System

Hierarchical agent system. See `README.md` for layout, `config/policies.yaml` for autonomy rules, and [`docs/operator-contract.md`](docs/operator-contract.md) for the full set of operating rules.

## Session-start protocol (read this first)

Every conversation that asks for work reads two files in order:

1. **`docs/goal.md` — the outcome layer.**  This is the **first** read.  The active goal here describes what success looks like as a concrete deliverable.  An empty work queue does **not** mean the goal is achieved; only the goal's "Done when" criteria do.  If the active goal is unmet, the agent's job this session is to advance it, not to drain the roadmap.  If a deliverable subgoal is unchecked, that is the work — even when `docs/roadmap.md` is empty.
2. **`docs/roadmap.md` — the work queue.**  Read second.  The "Now" section is the day-level priority for the current goal.

Why the split: 2026-05-15 → 2026-05-16 produced 11 commits of infrastructure with the roadmap reading 0 open items, while the actual outcome (a real CC short emerging from that infrastructure) was 0 produced.  `docs/roadmap.md` Done all ticked, goal not met.  The two layers exist so that mistake can't repeat — when goal.md says a deliverable subgoal is unchecked, "queue is empty" is never the right signal.

- Do **not** use the README's "Status" checklist to pick work — it has no order, no dates, no priority signal.
- Do **not** infer the next task from `git log` alone — the log shows what landed, not what was *being* worked on or what is *now* most important.
- If `docs/goal.md` active goal is empty, ask the user before assuming a goal.  Do not invent goals.
- If `docs/roadmap.md` "Now" is empty but goal subgoals are unmet, the next task is whatever advances the most-blocked subgoal.
- If both goal subgoals and roadmap queues are clean, promote "Next" → "Now"; if both are empty, surface that state to the user rather than making up work.
- After work lands, append a one-line entry to `docs/roadmap.md` "Done" with the commit hash and date; tick any goal subgoals the work cleared.
- If `docs/audit/CURRENT-ALERT.md` exists, read it before picking up the goal — it means the last audit run flagged drift or a critical issue, which may bump priority above the goal queue.
- Subagents (orchestrator, planner, resourcer, editor, qa, auditor) do **not** read `docs/goal.md` or `docs/roadmap.md`. Day-level decisions belong to the top-level conversation; subagents stay pure functions of the mission prompt (or, for `auditor`, the focus arg) they receive.

## Operating rules

The full contract — agent behavior, never-pause rule, money firewall, dual-stack reporting, terminal format, documentation style, split-commit-push, session-resume protocol — lives in [`docs/operator-contract.md`](docs/operator-contract.md). Committed; survives machine changes; agent memory is a fast-access cache pointing back to it. The four most-load-bearing summarized inline:

- **Agent does all the work** — user never touches the terminal. Claude installs, edits, configs, commits, pushes. User intervenes only on hard guardrails (single-click approval, never a multi-step recipe).
- **Never pause unless told** — user is async; "or pause?" turns into hours of idle. When `docs/roadmap.md` Next has an item and Now finishes, promote it and continue in the same turn.
- **Money firewall** — paid APIs, SaaS, cloud-resource creation require explicit user confirmation. Local resources (Ollama, FFmpeg, brew, whisper, yt-dlp) stay auto-approved.
- **Logic changes need explicit OK** — editing `agents/*.md` or `.claude/agents/*.md` always pauses for user confirmation, regardless of autonomy mode.

## Git workflow — auto-commit, auto-push

- **Every code change** (anything under `agents/`, `.claude/agents/`, `config/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`) is committed and pushed to `origin/main` on completion.
- Remote: `git@github.com:MelonS/MelonS-Agents.git` (public).
- `records/` is **never** committed (gitignored). The history on GitHub reflects only how the agent system itself evolves, not its outputs.
- Use `git commit` and `git push` as two separate Bash calls; never `&&`-compound (classifier blocks it; see operator-contract §7).
- Commit message style: imperative subject ≤72 chars, optional body with bullets explaining *why*. Group changes by concern; don't bundle unrelated edits.

## Core rules

- **Code vs Data separation**: agent logic lives under `agents/` and `.claude/agents/` (git-tracked). All outputs go to `$RECORDS_DIR` (default `./records/`, gitignored).
- **Env-driven paths**: never hardcode `/opt/homebrew/...` or `~/...`. Read `$FFMPEG_BIN`, `$OLLAMA_HOST`, `$RECORDS_DIR`, etc. from `.env`.
- **Autonomy policy**: respect `config/policies.yaml`.
  - `AUTONOMY_MODE=false` (default): pause for user confirmation before logic changes, destructive FS ops, external publishes.
  - `AUTONOMY_MODE=true`: overnight mode. Stay within `AUTONOMY_BUDGET_USD`. Never edit agent definitions unattended.
