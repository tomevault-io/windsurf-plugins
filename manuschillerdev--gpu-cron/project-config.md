- Use mise for tool versions and project tasks, pnpm for every JavaScript dependency operation, and uv for every Python operation. Do not use npm, npx, or pip. Training: `uv run --locked --project training python training/train.py`. Never invoke Python or pip directly.
- Training uses MLX. The browser package uses specialized WGSL and packed learned weights with zero runtime dependencies. Verification compares MLX fixtures with actual browser WebGPU execution. Keep deployment and training independent. WebGPU is mandatory: no CPU inference backends or automatic fallback.
- Cron uses summed hashed feature embeddings, bidirectional affine scans, family scores and semantic token roles. Keep learned semantic-role/family predictions distinct from exact value interpretation and calendar semantics. Never present family/token metrics as end-to-end parsing accuracy.
- Reject unconsumed syntax. Never silently discard a schedule restriction or emit an approximate cron expression.
- Preview and cron use local wall-clock fields. Preserve the documented reference, timezone, alternate-week anchor, and DST policies.
- Verify with `mise run check`, including real browser WebGPU/reference parity. If WebGPU cannot be tested, report that explicitly.

- Keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `training/uv.lock` committed. Setup uses frozen/locked installs. Do not regenerate trained artifacts for dependency-tooling changes.
