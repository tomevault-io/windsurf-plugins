# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository contains `extenso`, a zero-runtime-dependency TypeScript library
that writes numbers in Portuguese. Changes must preserve linguistic correctness,
numeric precision, package compatibility, and the documented public API.

These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Runtime and toolchain

- Use Node.js 22.20 or newer. CI validates Node.js 22 and 24.
- Use npm and keep `package-lock.json` synchronized with `package.json`.
- AVA is the test runner, c8 enforces coverage, ESLint handles formatting and
  static analysis, esbuild produces JavaScript bundles, and TypeScript produces
  declarations.
- Do not add a runtime dependency without a strong, documented reason. The
  package intentionally has zero runtime dependencies.

## Repository map

- `src/index.ts`: public entry point and high-level conversion pipeline.
- `src/types.ts`: canonical public TypeScript types. Define public types here and
  re-export them from `src/index.ts`.
- `src/core/`: conversion orchestration and number-writing algorithms.
- `src/core/integer/`: integer group formatting and scale conjunction rules.
- `src/mode/`: behavior specific to number, currency, digit, and abbreviated
  modes.
- `src/lists/`: Portuguese vocabulary, scales, ordinals, decimals, and currency
  metadata.
- `src/utils/`: parsing, normalization, validation, currency detection, locale
  translation, and text post-processing.
- `src/**/tests/`: unit tests colocated with their subsystem.
- `src/tests/`: public API, regression, option-combination, boundary, and
  performance tests.
- `test/installed-package.mjs`: tests the packed artifact as CommonJS, ESM, and
  TypeScript consumers.
- `README.md` and `README-english.md`: equivalent Portuguese and English public
  documentation.
- `dist/` and `build/`: generated output. Never edit these files manually or
  commit them.

## Public contracts

- The default ESM export is the `extenso` function.
- `require('extenso')` must return the function directly.
- Named TypeScript exports must remain available from the package root.
- Supported inputs are `string`, finite `number`, and `bigint`.
- Preserve exact string and bigint digits. Never route large values through
  floating-point arithmetic.
- Supported output modes are `number`, `currency`, `digit`, and `abbreviated`.
- Public option values, validation behavior, scale limits, and error cases must
  stay synchronized with both READMEs.
- Treat changes to output wording, accepted input, defaults, thrown errors,
  package exports, or TypeScript types as public API changes.

## Architecture rules

- Keep `src/index.ts` focused on the high-level pipeline: validation, resolution,
  normalization, parsing, conversion, translation, and post-processing.
- Put mode dispatch in `src/core/convert.ts` and implicit currency or mode
  selection in `src/core/resolve-conversion.ts`.
- Keep parsing and validation separate from linguistic formatting.
- Prefer small domain functions with explicit names over long conditional chains.
- Reuse canonical vocabulary and scale lists instead of duplicating Portuguese
  words in production code.
- Runtime validators must accept `unknown` at untyped boundaries and narrow it
  safely. Avoid `any`, double assertions, and unchecked casts.
- When adding an enum value or public option, update runtime validation, public
  types, mode resolution, tests, and both READMEs together.

## Code style

- Follow `eslint.config.mjs`; there is no Prettier configuration.
- Use four spaces, single quotes, no semicolons, and trailing commas in multiline
  structures.
- End every text file with a newline.
- Prefer `const`, expression-style functions, early returns, and explicit return
  types for public or non-obvious functions.
- Use `import type` for type-only imports.
- Keep production files below the configured 300-line limit.
- Comments should explain linguistic, numeric, or compatibility reasoning rather
  than restating the code.
- Error messages are part of debugging ergonomics. Keep them specific and test
  important error behavior.

## Testing requirements

- Every behavior change or bug fix requires a regression test.
- Test public behavior through `src/tests/` and focused implementation behavior
  through the relevant subsystem test directory.
- Include singular, plural, zero, negative, decimal, gender, locale, short-scale,
  long-scale, and boundary cases when relevant.
- For parsing changes, cover both decimal-separator configurations, grouping,
  malformed input, and precision-preserving string cases.
- For currency changes, cover code, symbol, unit, subunit, custom definitions,
  detection precedence, and decimal precision.
- Coverage must remain at 100% for statements, branches, functions, and lines.
  Do not exclude meaningful code merely to satisfy the threshold.

Run the following before considering a code change complete:

```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:package
```

For dependency, packaging, export, build, or release-related changes, also run:

```bash
npm audit
npm pack --dry-run
```

## Build and declarations

- `npm run build` generates CJS, ESM, UMD, source maps, and TypeScript
  declarations.
