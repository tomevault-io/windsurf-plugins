# fast-mcp-telegram

Canonical GitHub repository: https://github.com/alexeyleshchenko/fast-mcp-telegram

Canonical Python package: `fast-mcp-telegram` on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/fast-mcp-telegram/).

Canonical MCP registry name: `io.github.alexeyleshchenko/fast-mcp-telegram`

The old GitHub URL `https://github.com/leshchenko1979/fast-mcp-telegram` is a public 404. Do not restore that owner in README links, `pyproject.toml`, `server.json`, `glama.json`, GHCR image names, or docs clone URLs. PyPI is the stable pointer.

Do not create a replacement repository under `leshchenko1979/fast-mcp-telegram`. If GitHub ever unsuspends that account and allows a transfer, keep the old name free so redirects can work.

Telegram MCP server (stdio, http-no-auth, http-auth). Full setup, ACL matrix, and dev workflow: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Session Corrections

### 2026-05-27
- **Issue**: Tried ACL live testing via Cursor MCP (`telegram-dev` or http-auth URL with fixed `Authorization`)
  - **Correct approach**: ACL is not viable through Cursor MCP (stdio has no ACL; URL MCP uses a fixed bearer; stale MCP subprocesses). Use `pytest tests/test_session_acl.py tests/test_mcp_tool_acl_integration.py`, HTTP curl against a local http-auth server, and [`scripts/acl_mcp_smoke.sh`](scripts/acl_mcp_smoke.sh) (reads bearer tokens from `acl.dev.yaml`, not hardcoded placeholders) — see [CONTRIBUTING.md § ACL development and testing](CONTRIBUTING.md#acl-development-and-testing-not-via-cursor-mcp)
- **Issue**: Started http-auth ACL server from wrong cwd, or `source .env.local` in zsh for `MTPROTO_PROXY`
  - **Correct approach**: Start the server from the **project root** so Python loads `.env` / `.env.local` via dotenv; do not `source .env.local` in zsh — proxy URLs with `&` break shell parsing
- **Issue**: Assumed ACL applies in stdio or without per-bearer sessions
  - **Correct approach**: ACL enforces only with `SERVER_MODE=http-auth` and `ACL_ENABLED=true`; each bearer in `acl.dev.yaml` needs a matching `{token}.session` via `http://127.0.0.1:8765/setup`
- **Issue**: Expected `connection.py` stdio fix without restarting Cursor MCP
  - **Correct approach**: After changing server code used by **telegram-dev**, restart **telegram-dev** in Cursor’s MCP panel — stale subprocess keeps old behavior
- **Issue**: Risk of committing real ACL bearer tokens
  - **Correct approach**: Keep `acl.dev.yaml` gitignored; never commit real bearer tokens (template only: `acl.dev.yaml.example`)
- **Issue**: "Repeat the sourcery-pr-cycle" interpreted as running another full PR → Sourcery → fix loop
  - **Correct approach**: User may mean publish/commit the skill to master, not re-execute the review cycle. Confirm intent when ambiguous.
- **Issue**: Treated phase closeout as blocked until all follow-up PRs merge, or assumed phase 1 code cannot land on master while follow-ups are open
  - **Correct approach**: Phase 1 code can be on master while follow-up PRs (e.g. #56) remain open; closeout means merge all **blocking** follow-ups first, not every open PR.
- **Issue**: Posted Telegram release announcement before release CI finished
  - **Correct approach**: After `gh release create`, verify CI/checks are green on the release tag or master commit (`gh run list`, `gh release view`); do not post Telegram until release is published **and** CI is green unless the user explicitly overrides — see [release-notes skill](.cursor/skills/release-notes/SKILL.md)
