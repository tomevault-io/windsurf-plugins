# Superpowers — Project Instructions

## What This Repo Is

A Claude Code plugin containing composable agent skills for software development workflows (TDD, design, draft-plan, orchestrate, pr-create). Skills live in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with optional supporting files alongside.

## Skill Conventions

### Skill Testing

Use skill-eval for dedicated skill refactors or new skill creation where triggering accuracy and workflow correctness need validation. For routine skill edits (wording changes, model upgrades, adding a section), eval is overkill — manual review is sufficient.

### Token Efficiency

SKILL.md files are injected into context when the skill triggers. Every excess word displaces working memory. Budget: 1,500 words (hard cap 2,000). The more concise, the better.

Challenge every line: Does the agent already know this? Does this paragraph justify its token cost? Only add context Claude doesn't already have — library knowledge, common patterns, and standard practices are already in the model.

- Never use `@filename` references in SKILL.md — they force-load the file immediately into context
- Use `**See:** filename.md` for on-demand references the agent reads only when needed, but only when the content is truly conditional (not every invocation)
- One good example, not three. If the agent needs more examples, put them in a supporting file

### Cross-Referencing Syntax

```text
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use skill-name
**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** Read skill-name first
**See:** filename.md
```

### Skill Descriptions

Descriptions are the primary triggering mechanism — they determine whether a skill fires. Keep them trigger-condition-only: start with "Use when..." and never include workflow summaries, rationale, or what-the-skill-does content. Summaries after the trigger clause cause the model to shortcut the skill body.

### Explain the Why

Replace heavy-handed `MUST`/`NEVER`/`ALWAYS` patterns with reasoning that explains why the behavior matters. Today's models respond better to understanding the reasoning than to imperative commands.

## Repo Structure

```text
skills/           — One directory per skill (SKILL.md + optional supporting files)
docs/reviews/     — Codebase review reports
.claude-plugin/   — Plugin manifest and marketplace config
```

Plan artifacts (design docs, plan.json, task briefs) are created by the design/draft-plan skills under `.claude/claude-caliper/` and gitignored — they're transient working state, not permanent repo content.

## Testing

Bash test scripts live in `tests/`. Run with `bash tests/<dir>/<script>.sh`. Skill-eval is available for dedicated skill refactors — see Skill Testing above.

## Scripts

All shell scripts (`bin/*`, `tests/**/*.sh`) must have a `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang and the executable bit set (`chmod +x`). Agent teammates can't auto-approve `bash <script>` because `bash` is excluded from safe-commands — but `./script` resolves to the script's own path, which the hook can approve.

## Development Workflow

This repo uses its own skills. The typical flow: design -> worktree -> draft-plan -> orchestrate -> pr-create -> pr-review -> pr-merge.

Orchestrate supports two execution modes: subagents (parallel Agent tool dispatches) and agent teams (parallel teammates). The design skill recommends a mode based on plan complexity. Agent teams requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`.

## Markdown

- Always add a language label to fenced code blocks (MD040) — CodeRabbit flags this on every PR

## Git

- Use `nikhil5890@gmail.com` for commits (personal repo)
- Feature branches, squash merge, delete branch after merge
- Bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in any PR that changes skill behavior — the plugin installer compares cached vs declared version, so without a bump users stay on stale cache
- After merging a PR that bumps the version, create a GitHub release (`gh release create vX.Y.Z --generate-notes`) so users can track changes
