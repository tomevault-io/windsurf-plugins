# Domain-Oriented Module Organization

When organizing code in a modular application, follow these principles for better maintainability:

## Principles

- **Reduce cross-module dependencies and import cycles**
  - Co-locate related functions to prevent circular imports
  - Move utility functions to modules where they're most relevant

- **Improve code understandability**
  - Keep related functions together based on domain, not just technical category
  - Group functions by what they operate on rather than how they operate

- **Enhance maintainability**
  - Organize code according to domain boundaries, not just technical layers
  - Make it easier to update related functionality without needing to touch multiple files

- **Clarify utility purposes**
  - Make it obvious which utilities are general-purpose vs. domain-specific
  - Place domain-specific utilities in relevant command/feature modules

## Examples

### ❌ Avoid: Cross-Module Dependencies

```typescript
// utils/homebrew.ts
export async function isBrewPackageInstalled() { /* ... */ }

// commands/tools/homebrew.ts
import { isBrewPackageInstalled } from '../../utils/homebrew.ts';
export function getToolBrewPackageName(brewConfig, toolId) { /* ... */ }

// utils/tool-status.ts
import { getToolBrewPackageName } from '../commands/tools/homebrew';
import { isBrewPackageInstalled } from './homebrew';
```

### ✅ Better: Domain-Oriented Organization

```typescript
// utils/homebrew.ts - Contains ALL homebrew-related functions
export async function isBrewPackageInstalled() { /* ... */ }
export function getToolBrewPackageName(brewConfig, toolId) { /* ... */ }
export function normalizeBrewConfig(brewConfig, toolId) { /* ... */ }

// Commands use the consolidated utility module
import { isBrewPackageInstalled, getToolBrewPackageName } from '../../utils/homebrew';
```

## Guidelines

1. **Identify Domain Boundaries**: Group code by what it operates on (tools, fibers, config) rather than how (utils, helpers)

2. **Co-locate Related Functions**: Functions that work with the same data or concept should be in the same file

3. **Minimize Cross-Layer Dependencies**: Avoid having utils depend on commands and vice versa

4. **Consolidate Shared Interfaces**: Keep type definitions together with their primary implementation

5. **Merge Fragmented Utilities**: If multiple utility files serve the same domain, consider merging them
