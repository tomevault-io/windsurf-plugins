Startup success prediction.

Primary Research Question:
"What are the most significant predictors of startup success, and can we accurately predict whether a startup will succeed (IPO/Acquisition) or fail (Closed) based on its early-stage characteristics?"

Specific Sub-Questions to Answer:

1. Feature Importance & Impact

- Which factors have the strongest correlation with startup success?
- How much does funding amount vs. funding source matter?
- Do geographic location and industry sector significantly impact outcomes?

2. Predictive Performance

- Can we predict startup outcomes with >70% accuracy?
- Which machine learning model performs best for this multi-class problem?
- How early can we reliably predict a startup's eventual outcome?

3. Business Insights

- What funding strategy leads to the highest success rates?
- Which investor types (VC, Angel, Corporate) provide the most value beyond capital?
- Are there optimal timing patterns for funding rounds?

4. Practical Applications

- Can we create a risk assessment tool for investors?
- What recommendations can we provide to early-stage startups?
- Which warning signs indicate a higher probability of failure?

The Ultimate Question to Answer:

"Given a startup's current characteristics (funding history, industry, location, team, investor profile), what is the probability it will achieve each outcome (Operating/Acquired/IPO/Closed), and what actions could improve its chances of success?"

This question combines:

Prediction: Probability estimates for each outcome
Explanation: Why certain outcomes are more likely
Actionability: What can be done to improve success chances
