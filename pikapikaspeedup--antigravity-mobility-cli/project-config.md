# AI Agent Behavioral Rules

- The AI is STRICTLY PROHIBITED from modifying any template, pipeline, or core configuration files (e.g., inside `.agents/assets/templates/` or configuration JSON files) as a workaround to bypass runtime errors, missing parameters, or to artificially assist in completing a task.
- System contracts and templates define the architectural boundaries and must be respected. If a tool or API call fails because it violates a configuration contract, the AI must fix the calling mechanism, supply the required inputs, or ask the user, rather than altering the underlying configuration.
