# AGENTS.md — aireceipts constitution

*This file is the operating manual (design rationale: `docs/internal/harness.md`). Reading order when documents disagree: AGENTS.md (process + invariants) → specs/SPEC-0000 (product) → the active spec → the matching skill. ≤150 lines,
enforced by CI — if you're adding to it, cut something first.*

## Mission

aireceipts is a local, deterministic CLI that reads AI coding-agent transcripts off disk
(Claude Code, Codex, and other agents) and prints a **cost receipt** for the session: a
per-tool cost/time breakdown, waste lines (loops, downgrades, redundant work), a
an honest cheaper-model story (price-delta arithmetic + routable-spend estimate —
never "model X would have done it" predictions; `compare` measures that), and a compact
handoff block the user can paste into a PR or chat. No servers, no accounts, no dashboards.

## Stack

Node >=20, TypeScript strict, `tsup` (ESM build), `vitest` (tests), `fast-check`
(property tests on pricing/parsing), Stryker (mutation testing on `src/pricing/**`).

## Verification block (identical to CI — run this before you claim done)

```sh
npx tsc --noEmit;                    echo $?
npx eslint . --max-warnings 0;       echo $?
npx vitest run;                      echo $?
node scripts/verify-goldens.mjs;     echo $?
node scripts/determinism-check.mjs --runs=10 -- node scripts/verify-goldens.mjs; echo $?
node scripts/spec-lint.mjs;          echo $?
node scripts/hygiene.mjs;            echo $?
```

**Never pipe these through `tail`/`grep`/`head`.** A pipeline's exit status is the last
command's — piping hides a real failure behind a green-looking summary. Always check `$?`
directly, unmasked. This is the single most common way agents ship broken work undetected.

## File ownership

| Path | Owns | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| `src/parse/` | Vendor transcript adapters (Claude Code, Codex, …) | goldens |
| `src/pricing/` | Pure price-lookup + cost calc functions | **mutation-tested**, fast-check |
| `src/receipt/` | The receipt renderer (text/JSON output) | **golden-gated** (byte-equal) |
| `src/cli/` | Argument parsing, command surface | vitest |
| `data/prices/` | Cited price tables (per vendor JSON) | hook-enforced citations |

No duplicated truths: one renderer, one price schema, one numbering scheme for specs.

## Invariants (I1–I6 — restate in every spec and skill; never violate)

- **I1 — Deterministic; zero model calls; zero network in the product path.** Same
  transcript → byte-identical receipt.
- **I2 — Never fabricate a dollar.** `$` renders only when a dated price-table row
  matches the session's model and date; otherwise render tokens. No silent fallback
  prices.
- **I3 — Every number traceable.** Price rows carry cited `sources:`; the attribution
  methodology is one flag away (`--methodology`) and ships in `--json`; cheaper-model
  lines are labeled (arithmetic vs ≈ estimate), and no line ever claims another model
  would have completed the task.
- **I4 — Local-first; diagnostics + adoption telemetry, disclosed and escapable.** The
  product works fully offline. The only network call is content-free telemetry (Azure
  App Insights): command, coarse buckets, versions, agent type, error class, parse-failure
  signature, feature-usage enums, and a random (never machine-derived) install identifier
  sent only as a salted hash — NEVER transcript content, prompts, file paths, repo names,
  or dollar amounts; raw counts/timestamps never ship as payload fields. First-run notice;
  `--telemetry-show` prints the exact payload; `AIRECEIPTS_TELEMETRY=off` or
  `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` kills it. (SPEC-0002, SPEC-0043.)

- **I5 — The receipt is a byte-stable contract.** Goldens gate all output changes.
- **I6 — Facts, not rankings.** Report what a session cost; never rank models or agents
  as better/worse.

## The maintainer's four buttons

1. Approve/reject spec proposals (drafts never self-approve).
2. One-click cited price-table PRs.
3. Curate the skill surface (agents cannot add or modify skills).
4. Cut release tags (npm publish never happens without the maintainer).

## Current-state inventory

*Updated only by the `release` skill. Keep this section, and only this section, current
after each release — don't hand-edit it elsewhere.*

- **Shipped (npm `aireceipts-cli`, v0.11.0):** the receipt engine and its whole surface
  are live — parse adapters (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, opencode), cited price
  tables, per-tool attribution, waste lines (stuck-loop, trivial-spans, context-thrash
  incl. Codex compactions), price-delta + routable-spend (now with `% less`), `compare`,
  `week`, `--handoff` (resume packet + standing rules + savings slip), local budget
  line, quota context, statusline v2 (brand prefix, quota default-on, `--format`
  segments, labeled `≈` quota ETA — SPEC-0062), subagent rollups on every surface (PR
  fence + details table, session receipt `SUBAGENTS` row, statusline/mini/`--json` —
  SPEC-0060/0061), `--details`, `backfill`, `--demo`, `setup` + `integrations`
  (day-1 kit), per-agent docs pages, PR receipts (multi-session, SHA-anchored,
