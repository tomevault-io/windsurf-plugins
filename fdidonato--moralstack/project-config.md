# Architectural Boundaries

## Layer Isolation

- **Risk layer** (`moralstack/models/risk/`) must NOT import from the **Constitution layer** (`moralstack/constitution/`).
- Domain classification (domain overlays, regulated domains) must originate from the Constitution module — the Risk module only produces `risk_score`, `risk_category`, and structured signals.
- The Orchestrator (`moralstack/runtime/orchestrator.py`) must only orchestrate; it must NOT contain parsing logic or policy inference.

## Controller Routing

- Controller routing logic in `moralstack/orchestration/controller.py` must conform to the documented decision model in @docs/decision_policy.md.
- No ad-hoc action mapping — all routing must derive from the formal policy rules documented in @README.md (section "Policy formale SAFE_COMPLETE").
- **Borderline REFUSE**: when `risk_score ∈ [risk_thresholds.medium, borderline_refuse_upper]`, a REFUSE decision enters the deliberative pipeline instead of early-fast refusal. This is controlled by `OrchestratorConfig.borderline_refuse_upper` (default `0.95`). See @docs/modules/orchestrator.md.

## Simulator & Semantic Harm

- The simulator contributes to votes in `_determine_decision` (deliberation_runner) via `semantic_expected_harm` and `dominant_harm_types`.
- The simulator **can never produce REFUSE**; REFUSE comes only from hard violations, op_risk HIGH, misuse HIGH, or policy bounds.

## Parsing & Validation

- LLM outputs must be parsed via the shared utility in `moralstack/utils/` — no per-module ad-hoc parsing.
- Parsing, validation, and decision logic must remain separated (no merging into a single function).

## Design Principles (from @docs/architecture_spec.md)

- **Fail-Safe**: on error, refuse rather than respond unsafely.
- **Latency-Aware**: dynamic gating avoids overhead for low-risk requests.
- **Stateless Core**: each request is independent.
- **Modular**: cognitive modules are replaceable and testable in isolation.
- **Language-Agnostic**: see section below.

## Language-Agnostic Invariant

MoralStack MUST be completely independent from any specific natural language.

- **No hardcoded strings in any natural language** for runtime logic: prompts, pattern matching, content checks, refusal stubs, and safety assertions must NEVER contain language-specific words or phrases (e.g. Italian, English, etc.).
- **System prompts** sent to the LLM are in English as a lingua franca for the model, but they must instruct the LLM to reply in the user's language — they must NOT embed language-specific content used for detection, filtering, or decision-making.
- **All safety checks** (content filtering, pattern detection, draft validation) must rely on structural or semantic signals, never on keyword matching tied to a specific language.
- **Refusal and fallback messages** must be generated dynamically by the LLM in the user's language, or use language-neutral structural markers — never hardcoded natural-language sentences.
- **Content purity**: Final response `content` must contain ONLY generative output; never critic rationale, revision_guidance, or meta-analysis text.
- **Comments and docstrings** in code must be in English (see enforce-english-for-all-comments-and-project-documentation.mdc); runtime-visible strings must be language-agnostic.

## AI Instructions

- Any structural change in these modules **requires** updating @docs/architecture_spec.md.
- If a proposed change crosses a layer boundary listed above, **stop and flag it** before proceeding.
- Never silently change logic related to `final_action`, risk classification, or orchestration order.
- **Before adding any hardcoded natural-language string** to runtime logic (patterns, stubs, checks), **stop and flag it** — propose a language-agnostic alternative instead.
