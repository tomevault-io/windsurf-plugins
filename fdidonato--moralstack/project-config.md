# Refactoring Guardrails

Rules for safe, reversible refactoring of the MoralStack codebase. No observable behavior change; one logical transformation per commit.

## Mandatory Constraints

1. **No observable behavior change** — Refactoring only. If you find bugs, annotate them (e.g. in `docs/refactoring_diary.md` or as TODO comments) but do **not** fix them in the same refactoring step.

2. **Atomic changes** — At most one logical transformation per commit (e.g. one rename, one extract function, one move). Avoid bundling unrelated edits.

3. **Pre-commit checks** — Before every commit run:
   - `pytest -q` (or targeted tests for the touched area)
   - `ruff check .`
   - If formatting is applied: `ruff format .` or `ruff format --check .` as appropriate

4. **Reversibility** — Use a dedicated branch (e.g. `refactor/...`). Keep commits small with clear messages: `refactor: ... (no behavior change)`.

5. **Separate formatting from logic** — Do not mix formatting-only commits (Ruff/Black) with logical refactoring in the same commit. One commit for format, separate commits for each refactor.

6. **Ensure every line length at max 125 chars**
every line of the code should be lower equal than 125 chars

## Workflow Checklist

- [ ] Create a refactoring branch from `main` (e.g. `refactor/scope-name`).
- [ ] For each change:
  1. Apply **only one** logical transformation (rename, extract, move, split, etc.).
  2. Run `pytest -q` (or relevant tests) and `ruff check .`; fix any regressions or lint issues before committing.
  3. Commit with a clear message: `refactor: <what> (no behavior change)`.
  4. Do **not** mix format-only and logic changes in the same commit.
- [ ] Document decisions and baseline in `docs/refactoring_diary.md` (baseline: date, branch, test/lint commands; log: what, why, risk, tests run, commit).
