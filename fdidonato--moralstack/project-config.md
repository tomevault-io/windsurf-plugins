# Rules Self-Maintenance

The `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files encode architectural invariants, module maps, policy constraints,
and process checklists that **must stay aligned with the actual codebase**.

## When to Update Rules

After completing a user-requested change, check whether it affects any of the following:

| Change Type                                  | Potentially Affected Rule(s)                         |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Module added, renamed, or removed            | `project-overview.mdc` (module map)                  |
| Layer boundary or import constraint changed  | `architecture-guidelines.mdc`                        |
| Constitution schema, loader, or overlay changed | `policy-layer.mdc`                                |
| Documentation index or naming changed        | `documentation-enforcement.mdc`                      |
| Dependency added, removed, or upgraded       | `dependency-management.mdc` (key dependencies table) |
| Safety-critical file list changed            | `commit-hygiene.mdc`                                 |
| Decision model changed (actions, routing)    | `project-overview.mdc`, `architecture-guidelines.mdc`|
| New Cursor rule added or rule scope changed  | This file (`rules-self-maintenance.mdc`)             |

## AI Instructions

- After every structural or policy-impacting change, **review the table above** and update every affected `.mdc` file.
- Rule updates must happen **in the same session** as the code change — do not defer them.
- When updating a rule, preserve its existing format and style; make surgical edits, not rewrites.
- If the user explicitly requests a change that contradicts a rule, **apply the change first**, then **update the rule** to reflect the new intent.
- If unsure whether a rule is affected, read it (`@.cursor/rules/`) and verify before skipping.
