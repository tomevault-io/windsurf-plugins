## Working agreement

1. Before writing any code, describe approach, wait for approval.
2. Requirements ambiguous? Ask clarifying questions before writing code.
3. After writing code, list edge cases + suggest test cases.
4. Bug? Write a test that reproduces it, then fix until the test passes.
5. Every correction: reflect on the mistake, plan to avoid repeating it.
6. All updates must be happened on the worktree branch, not main. 
7. Write spec and plan under `doc/specs` before implementation, so they're available for reference during implementation.
8. Tests should >90% coverage, but focus on meaningful tests that cover edge cases and critical paths, not just trivial lines. 
9. Co-locate tests with the code under test: each module `foo.py` has its tests in a sibling `foo_test.py` (suffix style — never a separate `tests/` directory, never the `test_*.py` prefix). 
10. **Never drive a model with a bare Python `for`/`while` loop when it runs repeatedly.** Python loops execute op-by-op (dispatch overhead, no fusion) and trace fresh each step; the `brainstate.transform` primitives lower the whole loop into one compiled XLA program, tracing the body only once. Pick by shape of the work:
    - **Single step or one-shot call** → `brainstate.transform.jit` — wrap the step/model call so it compiles once and reuses the trace.
    - **Many steps, collect outputs** → `brainstate.transform.for_loop` — repeat a step `length` times or map over `xs`; `State` is carried automatically and stacked outputs are returned.
    - **Many steps with an explicit carry** → `brainstate.transform.scan` — when threading a carry value alongside `State` (`f(carry, x) -> (carry, y)`).
    - **Long rollout under autograd (backprop through time)** → `brainstate.transform.checkpointed_for_loop` / `brainstate.transform.checkpointed_scan` — same semantics as above but rematerialize activations on the backward pass (tune `base`) to bound peak memory at the cost of recomputation.

    Compose them freely (e.g. `jit` an outer driver that calls a `for_loop`/`scan`). Reach for the checkpointed variants only when reverse-mode gradients through a long simulation would otherwise exhaust memory — otherwise prefer plain `for_loop`/`scan`.
11. Maintain compatibility with JAX versions >= 0.8.0.


## Docstring style (NumPy-doc)

All public classes, methods, functions must use [NumPy-style docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). Canonical section order:

1. **Short summary** – one-line imperative description (no blank line before).
2. **Extended summary** – optional, follow blank line after short summary.
3. **Parameters** – each entry: `name : type` on own line, description indented below.
4. **Returns** / **Yields** – same format as Parameters.
5. **Raises** – exception type and when raised.
6. **See Also** – related functions / classes.
7. **Notes** – implementation details, math, references.
8. **References** – numbered bibliography entries (`.. [1]`).
9. **Examples** – runnable, doctestable code snippets.

Rules for the Examples section:

- Wrap example code in `.. code-block:: python` directive so Sphinx render with syntax highlighting.
- Prefix every input line with `>>>` (continuation lines with `...`) for `doctest` compatibility.
- Show expected output on line immediately after statement, **without** prompt prefix.
- Separate distinct scenarios with blank `>>>` line.
- Always include necessary imports (`import brainunit as u`, etc.) at top of example block so self-contained.
