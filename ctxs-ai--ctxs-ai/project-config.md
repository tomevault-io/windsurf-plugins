description: Agent implementation using Mastra for intelligent document organization
---


This is an agent implementation that will serve as an intelligent librarian, organizing and managing information in markdown files. The implementation uses Mastra as its foundation.

Key Architectural Points:
1. The agent is implemented as a TypeScript application using Bun as the runtime
2. Core functionality is centered around markdown file processing and LLM interactions
3. Uses Commander.js for CLI interface design
4. Implements frontmatter validation and generation capabilities

Development Guidelines:
1. Keep the agent's core responsibilities separate from the file processing logic
2. Use TypeScript types rigorously, especially for frontmatter and configuration interfaces
3. Maintain clear separation between:
   - Agent core logic
   - File system operations
   - LLM interactions
   - CLI interface

When implementing new features:
1. Consider the agent's primary role as a librarian/organizer
2. Ensure proper error handling for file operations and LLM interactions
3. Add appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring
4. Keep the CLI interface intuitive and consistent

Code Style:
1. Use async/await for asynchronous operations
2. Implement proper TypeScript types for all functions and data structures
3. Document complex logic with clear comments
4. Use meaningful variable names that reflect the librarian/organizer domain
