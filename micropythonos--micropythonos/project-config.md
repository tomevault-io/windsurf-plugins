# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

- Build is driven by `./scripts/build_mpos.sh <target>`; it mutates tracked files (patches `lvgl_micropython/lib/micropython/ports/esp32/main/idf_component.yml`, appends include to `micropython-camera-API/src/manifest.py`, and toggles `@micropython.viper` in `internal_filesystem/lib/mpos/audio/stream_wav.py`). Re-run builds expecting these edits to persist unless reverted.
- Unix/macOS builds rely on symlinks created by `build_mpos.sh` in `lvgl_micropython/ext_mod/` for `c_mpos` and `secp256k1-embedded-ecdh` because `USER_C_MODULE` is unreliable on those targets.
- Syntax tests run via `./tests/syntax.sh` and compile every `internal_filesystem/**/*.py` with `mpy-cross`; failing files are reported by path.
- Unit tests run via `./tests/unittest.sh [test_file] [--ondevice]`; runner injects `main.py` and disables `mpos.TaskManager` for desktop, but on-device runs must NOT re-run boot/main (the script handles this).
- Graphical tests are detected by filename containing `graphical` and run with LVGL boot/main injected; non-graphical tests run without boot files.
- To run a single test, pass a file path to `./tests/unittest.sh` (absolute path is resolved inside the script).
- Testing workflow details and examples live in `tests/README.md`; check it before adding new tests.
- Code formatting for Python in this repo is ruff with double quotes configured in `ruff.toml` (quote-style = "double").

Guidelines:
- If something is incomplete or lacks functionality that is needed to finish the task, then implement the missing functionality, rather than working around it.
- Always add a timeout -s 9 30 to ./scripts/run_desktop.sh so run: timeout -s 9 30 ./scripts/run_desktop.sh

Guidelines for writing or updating tests:
- Use the testing facilities in ./internal_filesystem/lib/mpos/ui/testing.py and feel free to add new ones there, NOT ad hoc in the test itself.
- When adding graphical tests, follow the helpers and conventions described in tests/README.md.

LVGL tips:
- import lvgl as `lv` and use `lv.` to access it
- `lv.screen_active()` (not `lv.scr_act()`)
- use `button` instead of `btn`, `image` instead of `img`
- use `lv.EVENT.VALUE_CHANGED` instead of `lv.EVENT_VALUE_CHANGED`
- instead of `lv.OBJ_FLAG.CLICKABLE`, use `lv.obj.FLAG.CLICKABLE` (same pattern for other flags)
- instead of `.set_hidden(True)` use `.add_flag(lv.obj.FLAG.HIDDEN)`; instead of `.set_hidden(False)` use `.remove_flag(lv.obj.FLAG.HIDDEN)`
- use `.remove_flag()` instead of `.clear_flag()`
- use `obj.remove_state(...)` not `obj.clear_state(...)`
- event handlers need 3 arguments: `button.add_event_cb(button_cb, lv.EVENT.CLICKED, None)`
- if you pass a method as an event callback, it must accept the event argument: `def callback(self, event)`. Using the same method as both a direct call and an event callback requires a default: `def method(self, event=None)`.
- don't hard-code display resolution; use `lv.pct(100)` or other techniques to scale the interface
- `DRAW_PART_BEGIN` does not exist anymore
- don't use `get_child_by_type()`; use a global variable with the child you want instead
- msgbox: `msgbox = lv.msgbox()` then `msgbox.add_title("title")`
- use `lv.buttonmatrix.CTRL.CHECKABLE` instead of `lv.BUTTONMATRIX_CTRL_CHECKABLE`
- use `lv.buttonmatrix.CTRL.CHECKED` instead of `lv.BUTTONMATRIX_CTRL_CHECKED`
- colors: `RED = lv.palette_main(lv.PALETTE.RED)` or `DARKPINK = lv.color_hex(0xEC048C)`
- use `lv.anim_t.path_ease_in_out` not `lv.anim_path_ease_in_out`
- instead of `label.set_long_mode(lv.label.LONG.WRAP)` use `label.set_long_mode(lv.label.LONG_MODE.WRAP)`
- use `style_obj = lv.style_t()` then `style_obj.init()` instead of `lv.style()`
- always call `style.init()` after `lv.style_t()` before calling setters like `set_bg_color()` — without it the device may hang
- In LVGL 9.x style setters take only the value (no selector). The selector goes in `add_style()`. E.g. `style.set_bg_color(lv.color_hex(0x...))` then `obj.add_style(style, lv.PART.ITEMS | lv.STATE.CHECKED)`.
- `lv.buttonmatrix` has no `set_button_text()` or `set_button_ctrl()` in this binding. To update text, rebuild and call `set_map()`. To mark buttons visually (e.g. solved state), change the text symbol itself (e.g. append "!").
- `lv.buttonmatrix.set_map()` fires `LV_EVENT_VALUE_CHANGED` asynchronously (next LVGL tick), causing phantom second-selection events. Guard with a time-based debounce (`time.ticks_diff(now, last_ts) < 50`) rather than a simple flag.
- LVGL object wrappers (e.g. `lv.button()`, `lv.obj()`) do NOT support arbitrary Python attribute assignment (`btn.idx = 5` raises `AttributeError`). To associate data with a widget, use closures/lambdas (`lambda e, i=idx: callback(e, i)`) or maintain parallel lists keyed by list index.

MicroPythonOS tips:
- `self.appFullName` is automatically set by the ActivityNavigator when launching an Activity. Use it instead of hard-coding the app's package name (e.g. for `SharedPreferences(self.appFullName)`).

MicroPython compatibility:
- Some builds ship a minimal `random` module without `random.Random` or `random.shuffle`. For shuffling, implement Fisher-Yates manually with `random.randint`.
- For deterministic jitter in apps, prefer a tiny local LCG (linear congruential generator) instead of `random.Random`.
