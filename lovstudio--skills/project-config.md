# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repo.

## What This Is

The **central index** for Lovstudio skills. The source of truth for each skill is its own repo at `github.com/lovstudio/{name}-skill`. Locally, skills are developed under `~/lovstudio/coding/skills/{name}-skill/`.

This index repo also carries a **read-only mirror** of every free skill under `./skills/<name>/`, auto-synced by CI from the upstream skill repos. The mirror exists so that `npx skills add lovstudio/skills --all -g` (vercel-labs/skills CLI) can discover every skill in a single clone — that CLI only resolves local paths in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, not external `github` sources.

## Repo Layout

```
.
├── README.md / README.en.md          # Human-readable catalog (CI-rendered between SKILLS:START/END)
├── skills.yaml                       # Machine-readable manifest — SOURCE OF TRUTH
├── skills/<name>/                    # Auto-mirrored free-skill contents (do NOT hand-edit; CI overwrites)
├── .claude-plugin/marketplace.json   # Claude Code marketplace manifest (auto-rendered)
├── scripts/sync-skills.py            # Mirrors each free repo into ./skills/<name>/ (shallow clone + rsync)
├── scripts/render-marketplace.py     # Regenerates marketplace.json from skills.yaml
├── scripts/render-readme.py          # Regenerates README skill table from skills.yaml
├── CHANGELOG.md                      # Index repo history (not per-skill)
├── LICENSE                           # MIT (for this index; each skill has its own LICENSE)
└── .github/workflows/                # render-readme.yml runs sync → render-marketplace → render-readme
```

**Edit `skills.yaml`, not the README table, not marketplace.json, not files under `skills/`.** CI regenerates all three on push and nightly. You can preview locally with `python3 scripts/sync-skills.py && python3 scripts/render-marketplace.py && python3 scripts/render-readme.py` (add `GH_SYNC=1` to the last one to refresh descriptions from GitHub).

## How users install

- **Via `npx skills`** (vercel-labs CLI, cross-agent): `npx skills add lovstudio/skills --all -g` — clones this repo, scans `./skills/**/SKILL.md`, installs everything into `~/.claude/skills/`. The `--all -g` flags are non-negotiable for AI/CI/non-TTY environments because the default path opens three `@clack/prompts` interactive selectors (skills → agents → confirm) and hangs without a TTY. When recommending install commands to users — in READMEs, SKILL.md, marketplace blurbs, anywhere — always include `--all -g` (or `--skill <name> -g -y` for single-skill installs).
- **Via Claude Code native marketplace**: `/plugin marketplace add lovstudio/skills` then `/plugin install <name>@lovstudio` — reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, each plugin resolves to `./skills/<name>/`.

Both paths work off the same mirror.

## skills.yaml Schema

```yaml
version: 1
skills:
  - name: any2pdf                       # skill short name (no prefix)
    repo: lovstudio/any2pdf-skill       # GitHub repo (always lovstudio/{name}-skill)
    paid: false                         # true = private repo + purchase required
    category: "Document Conversion"     # display category
    version: "0.7.1"                    # from SKILL.md (optional, CI-synced)
    description: "Markdown → …"         # Agent-facing trigger copy (English, terse). CI-synced from GitHub repo description.
    tagline_en: "Typeset Markdown …"    # Human-facing English one-liner for README. Hand-maintained.
    tagline_zh: "把 Markdown 排成 …"    # Human-facing Chinese one-liner for README. Hand-maintained.
    skill_path: "skill/lovstudio-xxx"   # OPTIONAL. Use only when SKILL.md is not at repo root.
```

### Field responsibilities

- **`description`** — read by Claude Code / Agents to decide when to trigger the skill.
  Keep it professional, English, and terse (Agents have a skills-token budget).
  CI pulls this from each skill's GitHub repo description nightly (`GH_SYNC=1`) — so the repo
  description on GitHub is the source of truth; don't hand-edit this field as marketing copy.
- **`tagline_en` / `tagline_zh`** — shown to humans in README.md / README.zh-CN.md and on
  agentskills.io. Value-oriented ("what the user gets"), NOT implementation details.
  Hand-maintained — CI never overwrites them.
- **Paid skills**: `tagline_*` must not leak implementation specifics (no library names,
  no auth/token mechanics, no internal endpoints) — they sit in a public index.

## Key Conventions

- **`paid` field is only here**, not in individual SKILL.md files. It's business classification, not skill metadata.
- **Current totals live in `skills.yaml`** — the README count line is auto-rendered, so don't hand-edit it. See `scripts/render-readme.py`.
- **Naming**: GitHub repo = `lovstudio/{name}-skill`; local path = `~/lovstudio/skills/{name}-skill/`. No `lovstudio-` prefix in the name.
- Skill short name (`any2pdf`) is what users invoke via `lovstudio:any2pdf` in Claude Code.

## Adding a New Skill

1. In `~/lovstudio/skills/`: run the [`skill-creator`](https://github.com/lovstudio/skill-creator-skill) skill to scaffold `{name}-skill/`.
2. `cd {name}-skill && git init && git add -A && git commit && gh repo create lovstudio/{name}-skill --public --source=. --push`
