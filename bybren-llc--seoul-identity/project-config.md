## Project Overview

This is a screenwriting project for "Seoul Identity" by Scott Graham. The screenplay is written in Fountain format (.fountain), a plain-text markup language for screenwriting.

This repository uses a **multi-agent screenwriting harness** adapted from the WTFB Safe Agentic Workflow methodology.

## Quick Start Commands

### Workflow

/end-session               - Complete session, commit progress
/check-format              - Validate Fountain syntax
/check-continuity          - Check consistency across script
/new-branch [type] [desc]  - Create properly named branch
```

### Writing
```
/new-scene [location]      - Add formatted scene heading
/new-character [name]      - Add character with tracking
