# Code Style

## Clarity Above All

- Variable, function, and class names must be self-explanatory
- Avoid obscure abbreviations. Prefer `calculateTotalGain` over `calcTG`
- Small functions with a single responsibility (< 30 lines ideally)
- No unnecessary comments. The code should explain itself

```typescript
// ❌ Bad: comment that repeats the code
// Calculate the total gain
const totalGain = this.calculateTotalGain(positions);

// ✅ Good: self-explanatory name, no comment needed
const totalGain = this.calculateTotalGain(positions);
```

## When to Comment

Comment only:
- Non-obvious business decisions (e.g., a specific tax rule)
- Temporary workarounds with a link to the issue
- Public interfaces (concise JSDoc)

## Strict TypeScript

- `strict: true` is active. Never use `any` (ESLint rule enforced)
- Use discriminated unions instead of boolean flags
- Prefer `readonly` for immutable properties
- Use `interface` for contracts, `type` for unions and utility types

```typescript
// ❌ Bad
function process(data: any): any { ... }

// ✅ Good
function processOperations(operations: readonly Operation[]): PortfolioSnapshot { ... }
```

## Conventions

- Imports use the `@/` alias for `src/`
- One main class/type per file
- Files named after the class/type they export
- Private methods prefixed with clear purpose, not underscore
