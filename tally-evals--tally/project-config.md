# Active Development Rule

## Project Status
This project is **actively under development**. The codebase is being actively worked on and modified.

## Migration Policy
- **DO NOT** generate backward compatibility code, adapters, or transitional layers unless explicitly requested
- **DO NOT** create migration utilities, compatibility wrappers, or version bridges

- **DO NOT** modify existing APIs, interfaces, or data structures without explicit instruction

## Refactoring Policy
- **ALLOW** refactoring for code improvement (better organization, readability, maintainability)
- **ALLOW** internal code restructuring that doesn't change external behavior
- **ALLOW** improving code quality, naming, and structure
- **DO NOT** create migration files or breaking changes as part of refactoring

## What to Do Instead
- Focus on implementing new features as requested
- Refactor existing code for better quality when working on it
- Make minimal, targeted changes to existing code only when necessary
- Ask for explicit permission before making any structural changes that affect external APIs
- Preserve existing patterns and conventions unless specifically asked to change them

## Exception
Only make migrations or refactoring changes when the user explicitly asks for them with clear instructions.# Active Development Rule
