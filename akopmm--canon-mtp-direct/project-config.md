# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Android app that transfers RAW files from a Canon camera via USB using the `android.mtp` API directly, bypassing Android's 99-file SAF picker limit. Fully offline — no networking.

Two generations of Canon body are in scope: Digic 8 and newer (EOS R8, R, M50, 90D…) write `.CR3` and `.MP4`, everything before that (EOS 760D/Rebel T6s, 80D, 5D III…) writes `.CR2` and `.MOV`. The R8 is the only body tested on hardware.

## Build & Development

This is an Android project using Gradle. Once scaffolded:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug          # Build debug APK
./gradlew installDebug           # Install on connected device
./gradlew lint                   # Run lint checks
./gradlew test                   # Run unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest   # Run instrumented tests (device required)
```

No emulator support for USB Host mode — MTP testing requires a physical device with a Canon camera connected over USB. Logic that can be tested without hardware (e.g. preview extraction in `util/ThumbnailUtils`) belongs in `app/src/test` and must stay free of Android framework calls.

## Tech Stack & Constraints

- **Language:** Kotlin only (no Java)
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose + Material 3
- **Min SDK 26 / Target SDK 35**
- **Architecture:** MVVM + Clean Architecture with Hilt DI
- **Async:** Kotlin Coroutines + Flow
- **USB/MTP:** `android.hardware.usb` + `android.mtp`
- **Transfer service:** Foreground Service with `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_DATA_SYNC`
- **Persistence:** DataStore (preferences) for dedup — stores set of transferred filenames

**Do not add** Room, Retrofit, or any networking library. Single-screen app — no `NavHost` or `BottomSheetScaffold`.

## Architecture

```
data/mtp/          → MTP device management, file enumeration, transfer (emits progress Flow)
data/prefs/        → DataStore for transferred filename dedup
domain/model/      → Cr3File (objectHandle, name, sizeBytes, dateCreated), TransferState (sealed class)
domain/usecase/    → ScanCameraUseCase, TransferFilesUseCase
service/           → TransferForegroundService (keeps transfer alive, posts progress notification)
receiver/          → UsbReceiver (ACTION_USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED)
ui/main/           → MainScreen (single Compose screen), MainViewModel
ui/components/     → FileProgressItem, OverallProgressBar, CameraSetupGuide
```

## Critical Implementation Rules

### MTP calls must run on Dispatchers.IO
All MTP methods (`getStorageIds`, `getObjectHandles`, `getObjectInfo`, `importFile`) return `null` on failure instead of throwing. Treat `null` as error. Never call on Main thread.

### File-type detection by filename only
Canon bodies do not reliably report RAW format codes via `MtpObjectInfo.getFormat()`. Always classify by extension (case-insensitive) after `getObjectInfo()` — `.CR3`, `.CR2`, `.JPG`/`.JPEG`, `.HIF`/`.HEIF`/`.HEIC`, `.MP4`, `.MOV`.

Branch on `FileType.isVideo` / `isRaw` rather than naming individual types, so an added format doesn't have to be chased through the UI.

### File enumeration is recursive
Canon bodies organize files in DCIM subfolders. Walk `getObjectHandles` recursively — enter `FORMAT_ASSOCIATION` (folders), collect the supported extensions.

### Use importFile(), never getObject()
`getObject()` loads entire file into memory. Use `MtpDevice.importFile(objectHandle, destFile)` instead.

### Dedup by filename only
Key is filename (e.g. `IMG_1234.CR3`), not full path — Canon reuses folder names across sessions. Store in DataStore as `Set<String>`.

### Destination path
Save to `/sdcard/Pictures/CanonImports/YYYY-MM-DD/IMG_XXXX.CR3`. Create date subfolder with `File.mkdirs()`. After saving, call `MediaScannerConnection.scanFile()` with the MIME for the type (`image/x-canon-cr3`, `image/x-canon-cr2`, `video/quicktime`, …).

### RAW thumbnails differ by container
When the camera's MTP thumbnail is missing or won't decode, the preview has to come out of the file. CR3 is ISOBMFF with the preview inline near the start — scan the head. CR2 is a TIFF whose preview bytes live far past any header window — parse the IFD chain (`ThumbnailUtils.findCr2PreviewRange`) and fetch only the byte range it reports. Never pull a multi-MB full-size preview per tile when the small one is described.

### Foreground Service
Must call `startForeground()` within 5 seconds of starting. Expose progress as `StateFlow<TransferState>`.

### USB permission
Use `ActivityResultLauncher` with `PendingIntent` — never raw BroadcastReceiver registration inside Activity.

### MTP device lifecycle
One `MtpDevice` instance per connection. Always close in `finally` block or on `ACTION_USB_DEVICE_DETACHED`. Never cache across disconnect/reconnect.

## Canon Specifics

- **Vendor ID:** `0x04A9` (Canon) — `device_filter.xml` matches the vendor, not a product ID, so any Canon body auto-launches the app
- Single SD card slot on the supported bodies — `getStorageIds()` returns one storage ID
- Auto power-off kills connection — remind users to disable it

### EOS R bodies
