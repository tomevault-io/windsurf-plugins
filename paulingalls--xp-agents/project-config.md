# xp-agents Development Guide

## What This Project Is

A Claude Code plugin that enforces XP practices via hooks. Broadcast event log (Shared Mental Model) replaces point-to-point mailboxes. All XP agents are implemented as hook handlers.

Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for design decisions, hook map, event types, and platform constraints.

## Scoping: CLAUDE.md vs PROCESS_GUIDE.md

CLAUDE.md is NOT shipped with the plugin — it's for plugin developers (us). PROCESS_GUIDE.md IS shipped and serves all plugin users. Dedup is one-directional: CLAUDE.md may lean on PROCESS_GUIDE.md, never the reverse.

## Official Claude Code Docs

Full docs index: https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt — always verify hook I/O formats against the hooks reference before implementing new hooks.

## Coding Standards

**Python 3.11+, stdlib only — for plugin code that ships** (`plugins/xp-agents/scripts/`, `smm/`, hooks, agents, skills). No external packages, no pip, no virtualenv at runtime; every shipped script must run with just `python3` on PATH. Tests under `plugins/xp-agents/tests/` are NOT bound by this constraint — they don't ship and can use external runners (e.g., `pytest`, `pytest-xdist`) if it speeds the suite without complicating local setup. Keep the test deps short and well-justified; the spirit is still "simple to run".

Use `match/case` for tool_name routing, event type handling, and hook input parsing. Use type hints. Use `pathlib` over `os.path`.

All scripts start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.

**Keep files small and focused.** Target 500 lines max per file. Each module should have a single responsibility. When a file grows past 500 lines, look for a cohesive group of functions to extract into its own module (e.g., `coordination.py`, `security.py`, `concerns.py` were extracted from `_common.py`). Test files follow the same rule — split by the script or feature they test, not by milestone or chronology.

## Hook Patterns

See https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md for full reference. Minimum-viable shapes:

- **Input**: `input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)` — fields: `session_id`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `agent_id`
- **Context injection**: exit 0, stdout `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse", "additionalContext": "..."}}`
- **Block (simple)**: `print("reason", file=sys.stderr); sys.exit(2)`
- **Block (JSON)**: exit 0, stdout `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}`
- **Prompt/agent hooks**: return `{"ok": true}` or `{"ok": false, "reason": "..."}` — NOT `decision`/`block`
- **Recursion prevention**: skip when `agent_type.startswith("xp-")` — every command hook gating an agent hook must check this

## SMM Path Resolution

All scripts resolve via `init.sh` (single canonical source). Honors `$SMM_DIR` env override. SMM lives at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/{project-id}/smm/` — user level, not project level. Never hardcode paths.

## Hook Registration

All paths use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in `hooks/hooks.json`. Never relative paths — Claude Code copies plugins to a cache. See https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference.md for format.

## Platform Constraints

- **`additionalContext` unsupported on**: Stop, SubagentStop, TeammateIdle, TaskCompleted — output silently ignored. Use `decision: "block"` / `reason` or marker files instead. See `docs/PLUGIN_TOOLS.md` for full matrix.
- **Stop hooks run in parallel** — a command hook's `additionalContext` is NOT visible to a prompt hook in the same entry.
- **Available events**: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PermissionRequest, PostToolUse, PostToolUseFailure, Notification, SubagentStart, SubagentStop, Stop, TeammateIdle, TaskCompleted, InstructionsLoaded, ConfigChange, WorktreeCreate, WorktreeRemove, PreCompact, PostCompact, Elicitation, ElicitationResult, SessionEnd.

## File Structure

Plugin at `plugins/xp-agents/`: manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), guides (`XP_VALUES.md`, `PROCESS_GUIDE.md`, `TEAMMATE_GUIDE.md`), hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`), scripts (`scripts/`), agents (`agents/`), skills (`skills/`), SMM engine (`smm/`), tests (`tests/`).

## Error Handling

Fail loud, never corrupt, always recoverable: atomic writes (tempfile + rename), flock on `events.jsonl` with timeout fallback, schema validation at write time, graceful degradation when SMM is missing (exit 0).

## Event Appending

See PROCESS_GUIDE.md for event types, required fields, and common patterns.

## Testing

All tests run on every commit via lefthook. Leaky env vars (`GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_COMMON_DIR`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, `SMM_DIR`, `XP_TEAMMATE_NAME`) stripped via `env -u` in lefthook.yml and at import time in `conftest.py`. The teammate var matters because the SessionStart hook reads it to choose the teammate guide; without stripping, integration tests assert against the wrong guide and every teammate's pre-commit fails.

**Setup** (one-time): `pipx install pytest && pipx inject pytest pytest-xdist`. See README "Development setup" for details.

```bash
# Run everything in parallel (~13s on 16 cores):
pytest -n auto
# Run a single file:
