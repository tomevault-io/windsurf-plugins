# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm install                       # install JS deps
npm run tauri dev                 # full dev: Vite on :1420 + Tauri window, Rust hot-restart
npm run build                     # tsc && vite build (frontend only)
npm run test:regression           # npm run build + cd src-tauri && cargo test  (the CI gate)
```

Targeted checks:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit                                    # frontend type check (CI uses this)
cd src-tauri && cargo test <name>                   # single Rust test
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings   # lint Rust (CI runs this, continue-on-error)
cd src-tauri && SKIP_VERSION_BUMP=1 cargo build     # build check without bumping the patch version
```

**Version-bump side effect.** `npm run build` runs `scripts/bump-build.cjs` as a `prebuild` step and increments the patch in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` in lockstep. Set `SKIP_VERSION_BUMP=1` whenever you don't want that (CI sets it on plain build checks; the signed-release flow also sets it — see `docs/build-and-release.md`).

Signed/notarized builds, release tagging, and the `latest.json` updater feed are documented in `docs/build-and-release.md`; do not run them speculatively.

## Architecture

Tauri 2 desktop app. **React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Zustand** (`src/`) talks over Tauri IPC to a **Rust** backend (`src-tauri/src/`). Bundle target is macOS aarch64 + Windows x64; no Linux packaging.

### Two Tauri windows
`src/App.tsx` branches on `getCurrentWindow().label`:
- `main` — the full app (sidebar + routes under `BrowserRouter`).
- `tray-popover` — a separate Tauri window owned by `src-tauri/src/tray.rs`, renders `<TrayPopover />` only. It emits `navigate-to` events that the main window picks up via `NavigateListener` (also shows/focuses the main window).

### Adapter trait — the core abstraction
`src-tauri/src/adapters/traits.rs` defines `AgentAdapter` (`id`, `name`, `capabilities`, `detect`, `read_config`, `diff`, `deploy`, `remove`, `managed_paths`). One implementation per provider (`claude_code`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `gemini`, `copilot`, `antigravity`, `vscode`, `codex`) lives next to it. `AdapterRegistry::new()` in `adapters/mod.rs` instantiates the full list — **adding a provider means adding it there**.

The deploy pipeline is: frontend calls `preview_deploy` → registry resolves capability/agent IDs → each selected adapter's `diff()` returns `ConfigDiffEntry`s (Add/Modify/Remove + current/proposed content) → user reviews in the wizard → `execute_deploy` runs `utils::backup` then writes via `utils::paths::atomic_write` and records a manifest. `utils::drift` later compares stored hashes against on-disk content to surface drift.

### Analytics is a parallel subsystem
`src-tauri/src/analytics/` has its own per-provider modules (`claude_v2`, `cursor_v2`, `codex`, `gemini`, `copilot`, plus several others), shared `http`, `token_store`, `cost_engine`, and a `commands` module that exposes the tray summary + per-provider analytics commands. The cost engine and rate-limit "LimitState ladder" are provider-specific — don't try to unify them with the deploy/adapter layer.

### Tauri command registration is centralized
Every IPC command must be wired in **two** places:
1. The Rust handler lives under `src-tauri/src/commands/<domain>.rs` (or `analytics/commands.rs`, or `tray.rs`).
2. It is registered in the giant `invoke_handler![…]` macro in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`. If you add a new command and skip this, the frontend call silently fails with "command not found". The matching TypeScript wrapper goes in `src/lib/tauri.ts`.

### Registry sources (bundled + community + custom)
Capabilities and agents are loaded from three roots, in this order: the bundled `registry/` directory (resourced into the app via `tauri.conf.json`), a synced community clone under the app data dir, and per-user custom items. `src-tauri/src/registry/loader.rs` walks `capabilities/{mcps,rules,skills,hooks,plugins,customs}` and merges by ID (later sources win). The `updater` polls the configured GitHub repo on a background interval; `App.tsx` starts polling on launch when `settings.registry.auto_update` is on and listens for `registry-updated` events to reload stores.

### Frontend routing convention
The canonical pattern is `adapters/:adapterId/:featureId`, rendered by `src/pages/AdapterFeaturePage.tsx`. Older flat routes (`/global`, `/memory`, `/permissions`, `/usage`, `/extensions`, `/prompts`, `/transcripts`, `/plans`, `/ai-attribution`) are explicit `<Navigate>` redirects in `App.tsx` — when adding new feature pages, prefer the adapter route and only add a redirect if a legacy URL needs preserving.

### Cross-platform file handling
The codebase is sensitive to Windows quirks. When touching managed config files, use the helpers in `src-tauri/src/utils/paths.rs`:
- `atomic_write` (write tmp + rename; on Windows, remove-then-rename when destination is locked).
- `read_with_sharing` (retries with backoff on `PermissionDenied`).
