## **Part C: 10-Mark Essay Questions**

*(Answer any one, no ceiling)*

**Strategy:** Your answer must be detailed, like a "2-page" handwritten essay. You **must** include a diagram, a full explanation of all parts, and the pros/cons to get full marks.

### **Predicted Question 1: Explain the Spiral Model with a neat diagram. What are its advantages and disadvantages?**

**Answer Outline:**

* **1. Definition:** The Spiral Model, developed by Barry Boehm, is a risk-driven software development process model. [cite_start]It is a sophisticated model that combines the iterative nature of the prototyping model with the systematic, controlled aspects of the Waterfall Model [cite: 250-251]. Its main characteristic is the heavy emphasis on **risk analysis** in each iteration. The project passes through multiple iterations, or spirals, and each spiral is divided into four main quadrants.

* **2. Diagram:**
    

* **3. Explanation of the Four Quadrants (Phases) per Iteration:**
    The software development process repeatedly passes through these four quadrants in each spiral:
    * **Quadrant 1: Identification (Planning):** This phase starts with gathering the initial requirements from the customer. In subsequent spirals, it involves identifying the objectives, alternatives, and constraints for that iteration. This quadrant focuses on planning and understanding what needs to be built.
    * **Quadrant 2: Evaluation or Risk Analysis:** This is the most critical quadrant. The team performs a detailed risk analysis for the identified objectives and alternatives. Risks (like "requirements are unclear" or "technology is too new") are identified and resolved. A prototype may be built to help understand and mitigate these risks.
    * **Quadrant 3: Design (Engineering):** In this quadrant, the software is actually developed and tested. Based on the requirements and risk analysis from the previous quadrants, the team proceeds with the design, coding, and testing of the product for that iteration.
    * **Quadrant 4: Construct or Build (Customer Evaluation):** The customer evaluates the build (or prototype) from the engineering phase. Based on this feedback, the project enters the next iteration, and the planning for the next spiral begins.

* **4. Advantages:**
    * **High Risk Management:** It is excellent for large, complex, and high-risk projects because risk analysis is built-in. Risky parts of the project are developed first.
    * **Changing Requirements:** New requirements can be accommodated easily in each new iteration.
    * **Prototyping:** Allows for extensive use of prototypes, which helps in clarifying requirements.
    * **User Feedback:** Users see the system early and often, leading to better feedback and a more accurate final product.

* **5. Disadvantages:**
    * **Complex:** It is the most complex model to manage and requires significant expertise.
    * **Costly:** Can be very expensive. It is not suitable for small or low-risk projects.
    * **Indefinite Spiral:** The project end may not be known early, and the spiral may go on indefinitely.
    * **Relies on Expertise:** Its success is highly dependent on the team's expertise in risk analysis.

### **Predicted Question 2: What is Requirement Engineering? Explain the steps of the Requirement Engineering Process.**

**Answer Outline:**

* **1. Definition:** Requirement Engineering is the systematic and disciplined process of gathering the software requirements from the client, analyzing them, and documenting them in a clear and unambiguous way. The main goal of this entire process is to develop and maintain a sophisticated and descriptive **'System Requirements Specification' (SRS) document**. This process forms the foundation for the entire software development project.

* **2. Diagram:**
    

* **3. Steps of the Requirement Engineering Process:**
    The process is generally divided into four main steps:
    * **Step 1: Feasibility Study:** This is the first step where analysts study the client's rough idea. [cite_start]The team checks if the proposed system is feasible to develop, analyzing it from several perspectives [cite: 516-518]:
        * **Economic Feasibility:** Can it be built within the budget?
        * [cite_start]**Technical Feasibility:** Does the current computer system support it? [cite: 141-142]
        * **Legal Feasibility:** Does it comply with laws and regulations?
        * [cite_start]**Operational Feasibility:** Will it work as expected by the client? [cite: 139-140]
        The output is a feasibility study report for management.
    * [cite_start]**Step 2: Requirement Gathering (Elicitation):** If the project is feasible, analysts and engineers communicate with the client and end-users to gather detailed requirements [cite: 522-523, 549]. This is a critical step to understand what the software should provide. Common techniques include:
        * [cite_start]Interviews (Structured and Non-structured) [cite: 559-563]
        * Surveys / Questionnaires
        * [cite_start]Prototyping [cite: 580-581]
        * [cite_start]Observation [cite: 585-586]
    * **Step 3: Software Requirement Specification (SRS):** This is the **most crucial step**. The analyst creates the SRS document based on the gathered requirements. This document formally defines the intended software, including how it will interact with hardware, its operational speed, response time, security, and limitations. [cite_start]It translates the client's requirements from natural language into a technical language for the development team [cite: 527-528].
    * **Step 4: Software Requirement Validation:** After the SRS is built, it is validated to ensure it is correct and complete. [cite_start]The team checks the requirements to see if they are valid, complete, unambiguous, and can be practically implemented [cite: 538-542]. This step helps catch errors early before design begins.

## **Part B: 5-Mark Short Answer Questions**

*(Answer any 7, 30-mark ceiling)*

**Strategy:** Your answer should be a detailed paragraph (or two) of 150+ words. Define the concept, explain its purpose, list its types/parts, and compare/contrast if the question asks for it.

### **Q1: Differentiate between White Box Testing and Black Box Testing.**

**White Box Testing** is a software testing technique where the internal structure, design, and coding of the software are tested to verify the flow of input-output. The tester has full knowledge of the internal workings of the code. [cite_start]Because the code is visible to the testers, it is also known as Clear Box Testing, Glass Box Testing, or Open Box Testing [cite: 1059-1060]. This type of testing is typically performed by developers or specialized QA testers and is used to test code paths, loops, and conditional statements.

**Black Box Testing**, on the other hand, is a software testing method where the functionalities of the software are tested *without* any knowledge of the internal code structure, implementation details, or internal paths. The tester only knows the required inputs and the expected outputs, treating the software as a "black box." This method focuses entirely on the software's external behavior and is based on the software requirements and specifications. [cite_start]It is also known as Behavioral Testing and is typically performed by the QA team acting as end-users [cite: 1061-1063].

### **Q2: Explain Cohesion and Coupling.**

**Cohesion** and **Coupling** are two fundamental concepts in software design that measure the quality of a modular design. [cite_start]**Cohesion** is a measure of how strongly the elements *within a single module* are related to each other [cite: 821-822]. It is an extension of the information hiding concept. We always aim for **High Cohesion**, which means that a module performs one single, well-defined task (e.g., a "CalculateTax" module). A module with high cohesion is easy to understand, maintain, and reuse.

[cite_start]**Coupling** is the measure of the interdependence or connection *between different modules* in a software's structure [cite: 824-825]. It indicates how much one module relies on or interacts with another. We always aim for **Low Coupling**, which means that modules are as independent as possible. If modules are highly coupled (high interdependence), a change in one module can have a ripple effect and break many other modules. This makes the system difficult to implement, test, and maintain over time. Therefore, a good software design has **High Cohesion and Low Coupling**.

### **Q3: What are Functional and Non-Functional Requirements?**

[cite_start]**Functional Requirements** are the requirements that the end-user specifically demands as basic facilities the system should offer[cite: 475]. They define *what* the system **DOES**. [cite_start]These requirements are stated in the form of input to be given to the system, the operation performed, and the expected output[cite: 477]. [cite_start]They are the features one can see directly in the final product[cite: 478]. [cite_start]For example, in a hospital management system, a functional requirement would be: "A doctor *should be able to* retrieve the information of his patients"[cite: 479].

[cite_start]**Non-Functional Requirements** are the quality constraints that the system must satisfy[cite: 482]; they are not related to specific functions but are *expected* characteristics. They define **HOW** the system performs. [cite_start]These requirements deal with issues like portability, security, maintainability, reliability, and performance [cite: 486-491]. For example, a non-functional requirement for the same hospital system would be: "The system response time for retrieving patient information must be less than 2 seconds" or "All patient data must be encrypted to ensure security."

### **Q4: What is a Prototyping Model? List its advantages.**

[cite_start]The **Prototyping Model** is a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model that is used when the customers do not know the exact project requirements beforehand[cite: 349]. In this model, a **prototype** (an early, working model) of the end product is first developed, tested by the customer (user evaluation), and then refined as per the customer's feedback. [cite_start]This cycle of building, testing, and refining repeats until a final, acceptable prototype is achieved which forms the basis for developing the final product[cite: 350].

**Advantages of the Prototyping Model:**
* [cite_start]Reduces the risk of incorrect user requirements[cite: 359].
* [cite_start]Good for when requirements are changing or unclear[cite: 360].
* [cite_start]Errors can be detected much earlier as the system is made side-by-side[cite: 364].
* [cite_start]Gives the user a working model to see and feel, leading to better and more specific feedback (aids management)[cite: 361].
* [cite_start]Supports early product marketing[cite: 362].
* [cite_start]Can lead to reduced maintenance costs[cite: 363].

### **Q5: Explain the different levels of Software Testing.**

Software testing is performed at different levels to ensure the quality of the product. The main levels are:

* **1. [cite_start]Unit Testing:** This is the first level, which focuses on the **smallest testable unit** of software design, such as a single function, method, or individual unit[cite: 1033]. [cite_start]It is often done by the programmer who wrote the code[cite: 1034]. The goal is to verify that each unit performs its intended function correctly in isolation.
* **2. [cite_start]Integration Testing:** The next level takes the unit-tested components (modules) and tests them *together* to build a program structure as dictated by the design[cite: 1036]. The objective is to find errors in the interfaces and interactions *between* the combined components.
* **3. System Testing:** This level tests the entire, integrated software system as a whole. [cite_start]It is a type of Black Box Testing where the focus is on the required input and output, without looking at the internal working[cite: 1050]. The goal is to verify that the complete application works according to the customer requirements as defined in the SRS.
* **4. Acceptance Testing:** This is the final testing phase, done to validate that the software meets the business needs and is ready for deployment. It is typically conducted by the end-user or customer. It includes:
    * [cite_start]**Alpha Testing:** A type of acceptance testing done *before* the product is released to customers, typically by internal QA people at the developer's site [cite: 1043-1044].
    * [cite_start]**Beta Testing:** Conducted at one or more *customer sites* by the end-user of the software in a real-time environment [cite: 1046-1047].

## **Part A: 2-Mark Definition Questions**

*(20-mark ceiling)*

**Strategy:** Your answer should be 3-4 lines. Give a clear definition, add a sentence for context or purpose, and mention a related fact or example from the PDF.

* **What is Software Engineering?**
    Software engineering is a systematic engineering branch focused on the development of software products. [cite_start]It uses well-defined scientific principles, methods, and procedures to achieve this [cite: 2-3]. [cite_start]The main objective is to create reliable, correct, and maintainable software that meets all user requirements [cite: 5-8].

* **Program vs. Software**
    [cite_start]A program is a subset of software, typically referring to the combination of source code and object code[cite: 56]. [cite_start]Software is a much broader concept; it includes the programs, plus all the associated documentation and operating procedures needed to set up, operate, and implement the system [cite: 54-55].

* **What is SDLC?**
    SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. [cite_start]It is a systematic process for building high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations and is correct [cite: 105-106]. [cite_start]The SDLC provides a clear framework, typically divided into phases like planning, defining, designing, building, testing, and deployment [cite: 110-115].

* **Define Modularity.**
    [cite_start]Modularity is a fundamental design concept where software is divided into separate, named, and addressable components called modules [cite: 813-814]. These modules are then integrated to satisfy the overall problem requirements. [cite_start]Modularity is a key attribute that permits a program to be managed easily[cite: 815].

* **What is Abstraction?**
    [cite_start]Abstraction is a key software design concept that allows a solution to be stated in broad terms using the language of the problem environment[cite: 796]. [cite_start]Lower levels of abstraction provide a more detailed description of the solution[cite: 797]. [cite_start]For example, a procedural abstraction refers to a sequence of instructions, while a data abstraction describes a collection of data [cite: 798-799].

* **Define Software Maintenance.**
    [cite_start]Software Maintenance is the process of modifying a software product *after* it has been delivered to the customer [cite: 1071-1072]. [cite_start]The main purpose is to correct faults, improve performance, implement enhancements, or adapt the software to a changing environment [cite: 1074, 1076-1081]. [cite_start]Maintenance is a crucial part of the software lifecycle and can be categorized as corrective, adaptive, perfective, or preventive [cite: 1084-1094].

* **What are Actors in a Use Case Diagram?**
    In a UML Use Case Diagram, an actor represents an entity that interacts with the system. [cite_start]Actors are external to the system and are identified to get an outside view of it[cite: 719]. [cite_start]An actor can be a human user, another internal application, or an external application that influences the system[cite: 722].

* **What are Software Myths?**
    [cite_start]Software myths are mistaken beliefs about software and the development process that are formed during the initial stages[cite: 59]. These myths, held by management, users, or developers, can lead to software problems and failures. [cite_start]An example of a user myth is believing that a brief, initial requirement statement is enough to start development[cite: 63].

* **Define Reusability.**
    Reusability is an objective of software engineering, also considered a characteristic of good software. [cite_start]A software product has good reusability if its different modules can be easily reused to develop new products[cite: 10]. This helps in faster development, lower costs, and higher-quality software.

* **What is an SRS?**
    [cite_start]An SRS (Software Requirement Specification) is a crucial document created by a system analyst after requirements are collected from various stakeholders[cite: 525]. [cite_start]It defines *how* the intended software will interact with hardware, its operational speed, response time, security, and limitations[cite: 526]. [cite_start]This document translates the client's requirements from natural language into a technical language for the development team [cite: 527-528].
