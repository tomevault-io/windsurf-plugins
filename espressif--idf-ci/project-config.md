# Code Style

## Error Handling
- No defensive coding — only handle errors that can actually occur
- Let exceptions propagate; catch only when you can meaningfully recover

## Functions
- Extract to a function only when called multiple times
- Use positional-only and keyword-only args wisely: `foo(pos_only, /, *, kw_only)`

## Variables
- Avoid temp variables unless they save repeated computation or improve readability significantly

## Docstrings
- Use Sphinx-style RST format
- Only write docstrings when behavior isn't obvious from the name and type hints

## Documentation
- For user docs under `docs/` folder, use `.rst` files
- For developer-facing docs, use `.md` files
- Keep paragraphs short; assume readers are professionals
