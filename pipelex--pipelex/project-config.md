# Pipelex Coding Rules

## Codex Cloud Commands

### Linting

   After making code changes, you must always lint using `make agent-check`.

   ```bash
   make agent-check
   # If the current system doesn't have the `make` command,
   # lookup the "agent-check" target in the Makefile and run the commands one by one (targets fix-unused-imports format lint pyright mypy)
   ```

   This runs multiple code quality tools:
   - Pyright: Static type checking
   - Ruff: Fix unused imports, lint, format  
   - Mypy: Static type checker
   - plxt: Format and lint TOML, MTHDS, and PLX files

   Always fix any issues reported by these tools before proceeding.

### Cleaning Derived Files

   If you need to clean derived files and caches, typically after you erased files or moved tests, the linters can get confused, the pytest collection can be off...

   ```bash
   make cleanderived
   ```

### Running Tests in Codex Cloud

    To test everything that can be tested from within the Codex Cloud sandbox, run this:

    ```bash
    make codex-tests
    # It's equivalent to running pytest with `-m "(dry_runnable or not inference) and not (pipelex_api or codex_disabled)"`
    # If some test fails, re-run it with `-s -vv` to see more details
    ```

### Prerequisites for running command lines: use virtual environment

   **CRITICAL**: Before running any `pipelex` commands or `pytest`, you MUST use the appropriate Python virtual environment. The only exceptions are our `make` commands which already include the env activation.

   Call the CLI directly from the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/pytest -s -v -k test_render_jinja2_from_text
   .venv/bin/pipelex validate --all
   ```

   For standard installations, the virtual environment is named `.venv`. Always check this first. On Windows, the path is `.venv\Scripts\` instead of `.venv/bin/`.

### Pipelex Dev CLI (`pipelex-dev`)

   The `pipelex-dev` CLI provides internal development tools that are not distributed with the package. It is available in the virtual environment.

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/pipelex-dev --help
   ```

   Key commands:

   - **`generate-mthds-schema`**: Regenerate the MTHDS JSON Schema (`derived/mthds_schema.json`). Run this after modifying `mthds_schema_generator.py`.

     ```bash
     .venv/bin/pipelex-dev generate-mthds-schema
     ```

### Pipelex CLI Commands

   To run the Pipelex CLI commands without the logo, you can use the `--no-logo` flag, this will avoid useless tokens in the console output.

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/pipelex --help
   .venv/bin/pipelex build --help --no-logo
   .venv/bin/pipelex run --help --no-logo
   .venv/bin/pipelex validate --help --no-logo
   .venv/bin/pipelex doctor --help --no-logo
   .venv/bin/pipelex init --help --no-logo
   ```

## Coding Standards & Best Practices for Python Code

This document outlines the core coding standards, best practices, and quality control procedures for the codebase.

### Python Version Compatibility

    - The project supports Python 3.10+ (`requires-python = ">=3.10,<3.15"`). Never use features introduced after Python 3.10 without a compatibility fallback.
    - Common pitfalls:
      - `datetime.UTC` was added in Python 3.11. Use `datetime.timezone.utc` instead.
      - `StrEnum` was added in Python 3.11. Always import it from `pipelex.types` which handles retrocompatibility.
      - `type` statement (PEP 695) was added in Python 3.12. Use `TypeAlias` from `typing` instead.
      - `ExceptionGroup` / `except*` was added in Python 3.11. Avoid unless using the `exceptiongroup` backport.

### Variables, loops and indexes

    - Variable names should have a minimum length of 3 characters. No exceptions: name your `for` loop indexes like `index_foobar`, your exceptions `exc` or more specific like `validation_error` when there are several layers of exceptions, and use `for key, value in ...` for key/value pairs.
    - When looping on the keys of a dict, use `for key in the_dict` rather than `for key in the_dict.keys()` otherwise you won't pass linting.
    - Avoid inline for loops, unless it's ultra-simple and holds on oneline.
    - If you have a variable that will get its value differently through different code paths, declare it first with a type, e.g. `pipe_code: str` but DO NOT give it a default value like `pipe_code: str = ""` unless it's really justified. We want the variable to be unbound until all paths are covered, and the linters will help us avoid bugs this way.

### Enums and tests

    - When defining enums related to string values, always inherit from `StrEnum`
    - When you need the enum value as a string, don't use `str(enum_var)` or `enum_var.value`, just use `enum_var` itself, that is the point of using StrEnum!
    - Never test equality to an enum value: use match/case, even to single out 1 case out of 10 cases. To avoid heavy match/case code in awkward places, add @property methods to the enum class such as `is_foobar()`. This is to avoid bugs: when new enum values are added we want the linter to complain. Use the `|` operator to group cases
    - As our match/case constructs over enums are always exhaustive, NEVER add a default `case _: ...`. Otherwise, you won't pass linting.
