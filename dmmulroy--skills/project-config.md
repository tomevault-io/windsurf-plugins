# Agent Instructions

<!-- agent-repos:start -->
## Vendored Repositories

This project vendors external repositories under @repos/ for coding-agent reference.

- Use vendored repositories as read-only reference material when working with related libraries.
- Prefer examples and patterns from vendored source code over generated guesses or web search results.
- Do not edit files under @repos/ unless explicitly asked.
- Do not import from @repos/; application code should continue importing from normal package dependencies.

Vendored repositories currently available:

When working with a related library, inspect its vendored repository for idiomatic usage, tests, module structure, API design, examples, and docs. If the vendored repository contains agent-oriented guidance such as LLMS.md, AGENTS.md, or AGENT.md, read that guidance before making changes.

When repeatedly working with a vendored library, consider creating a project-local pattern file under agent-patterns/ (for example, agent-patterns/<library>-<topic>.md) that summarizes the implementation, tests, docs, common constructors/combinators, examples, error-handling patterns, and what to avoid.
