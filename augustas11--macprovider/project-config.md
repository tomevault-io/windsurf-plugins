# AGENTS.md — for AI agents working on this repo

This repo's full agent rules live in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). The
rules there apply to **any** AI coding agent operating in this
repository (Claude, Codex, Cursor, etc.), not just Claude. Read
`CLAUDE.md` before writing or pushing code.

The most important rules, in priority order:

## 1. Worktree isolation — never edit the canonical checkout

For any implementation, audit, release, or other write-heavy task in
`/Users/augstar/macprovider-poc`, first create a fresh sibling worktree
from the intended base, usually `origin/main`:

```bash
git status -sb
git worktree list
git fetch origin
git worktree add ../macprovider-<topic> -b fix/<topic> origin/main
cd ../macprovider-<topic>
```

Do all edits, tests, commits, pushes, PR work, and merge follow-up from
that task worktree unless the user explicitly says to use the current
checkout. Do not reuse or mutate another active session's branch/worktree
silently.

## 2. PR workflow — never develop on local `main`

Money-path and security-sensitive changes (billing, payouts, gateway,
coordinator auth) go through PRs. GitHub squash-merge produces a new
single commit on `origin/main` with a different hash from your
PR-branch commits. If you commit directly to local `main`, you create
a parallel-universe divergence that will conflict on the next push.

Always work on a feature branch. After your PR squash-merges, run
`git reset --hard origin/main` to mirror origin and discard the local
PR-branch commits. See `CLAUDE.md` § *PR workflow* for the full
sequence and recovery steps for inheriting a divergent local main.

## 3. Git identity — pushes route to `Augustas11` automatically

A per-repo credential helper in `.git/config` calls `gh auth token
-u Augustas11` at push time, regardless of which `gh` account is
currently active. A plain `git push origin main` just works. Do **not**
manually switch accounts; do **not** embed tokens in URLs. See
`CLAUDE.md` § *Git identity* for restore steps if the helper is ever
missing (e.g. after a fresh clone).

## 4. Sensitive paths require PR

These directories carry money or auth logic and any change to them
must go through a PR with review:

- `phase4-coordinator/internal/billing/`
- `phase4-coordinator/internal/buyer/`
- `phase4-coordinator/internal/auth/`
- `phase4-coordinator/internal/requestlog/`
- `phase5-gateway/internal/router/`
- `phase5-gateway/internal/auth/`

## 5. Clean-room boundary

`d-inference` (https://github.com/layr-labs/d-inference) is licensed
NOASSERTION and is strictly clean-room. Do **not** inspect their
source under any circumstance.

## 6. Spec and decision-log conventions

- Specs live under `specs/`. House style: `BUILD_SPEC_*`,
  `AUDIT_SPEC_*`, `FIX_SPEC_*_VX_Y` for prompts; `SPEC-NNN-*.md` for
  normative documents.
- Decision log is `beta/DECISION_CRITERIA.md`. Append entries to
  capture what was decided and why.

## 7. Audit the full fix diff — never a slice

The three required audit lanes are Codex subscription CLI via OMC, not
Cursor `Task` subagents and not raw `codex` / `codex exec`:

```bash
omc ask codex --agent-prompt code-reviewer --prompt "<lane prompt>"
omc ask codex --agent-prompt security-reviewer --prompt "<lane prompt>"
omc ask codex --agent-prompt architect --prompt "<lane prompt>"
```

Run from the session/worktree root. Artifacts land under
`.omc/artifacts/ask/`. Gate: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH, 0 MEDIUM (LOW/INFO may
be carried explicitly).

When running those lanes on a fix, always review the **full diff of the
complete fix as it will land** — every commit of that fix combined,
scoped to the fix's files — never an incremental follow-up slice
layered on an already-merged earlier part of the same fix.

Reviewing only the delta loses whole-change context, hides interactions
between the earlier and later parts, and can bless a slice that is
locally fine but wrong in the combined patch.

Reconstruct it by finding the base commit **before the fix's first
commit** and diffing that base to the working tree, scoped to the fix's
files (`git diff <base> -- <files...>`). Do **not** diff against
`origin/main` when `main` already contains an earlier part of the same
fix.

## 8. Release verification — don't trust workflow green alone

For provider CLI releases that ship Malibu.app plus the standalone tarball,
verify byte identity between both embedded `macprovider-cli` binaries after
final signing/packaging, and verify the updater path from the previous stable
version. Do not treat candidate green, matching `--version`, or Gatekeeper
success as production proof. See `CLAUDE.md` and
`docs/runbooks/provider-cli-release-verification.md`.

For the canonical, full version of every rule above, see `CLAUDE.md`.
