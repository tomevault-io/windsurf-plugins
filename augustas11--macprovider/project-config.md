# Docs-only → direct to `main` (no PR)

In `Augustas11/macprovider` / macprovider-poc worktrees:

**Do not open a pull request for docs-only work.** Commit on a clean `main` synced to `origin/main`, then push straight to `main`.

## Docs-only means

- Markdown: specs planning/audit prompts, runbooks, beta exploration reports, close-criteria / close-record notes, decision-log append-only entries when they are narrative only
- Other non-executable documentation artifacts

## Not docs-only (feature branch + PR required)

- Any executable code (Swift, Go, scripts that run in CI/prod, shell shipped to providers)
- Money-path / auth paths: `phase4-coordinator/internal/{billing,buyer,auth,requestlog}/`, `phase5-gateway/internal/{router,auth}/`
- Catalog / rate-card / `coordinator.yaml` / static JSON that affects runtime
- CI workflow changes, schemas that gate validation, release tooling

## Why

Docs PRs still schedule the full macOS CI matrix (`macos-15` Swift + SPEC-015), burn scarce runners, and slow real code PRs. Direct-to-main skips that queue waste.

## Ship sequence

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout main && git reset --hard origin/main   # only when main is clean of unique work
# edit docs…
git add <docs paths>
git commit -m "…"
git push origin main
```

Never invent a `docs/…` branch or `gh pr create` for pure documentation.
