# Trust contracts: SPEC before code

Incident reference: Phase 3 live MDA (#1033) shipped `attestation_tier=hardware`
as an observe sketch; eight Codex audit rounds reverse-engineered the binding /
durability / rate-limit / invalidation invariant under fire (2026-08-17).

## Rule

For any change that **mints, upgrades, downgrades, or buyer-exposes a trust
tier or attestation strength label** (including `attestation_tier`,
`require_attestation` flips, MDA/`hardware` paths, or gateway trust disclosure):

1. **Write or extend the normative SPEC first** (usually SPEC-008) with the
   trust predicate: who may bind, one path that may set the label, what must
   be true at publish time, what invalidates it, durability, rate limits, and
   observe vs enforce boundary.
2. **Short SPEC audit** (honesty/completeness) before implementation.
3. **Then** implement and conformance-check code ↔ SPEC.
4. Do **not** treat runbook checkboxes or “observe prototype” as a substitute
   for that contract when the code publishes a public trust label.

## Allowed without a new SPEC pass

- Bugfixes that restore behavior already required by an existing SPEC clause
- Pure observability that cannot change tier/status/routing/disclosure
- Docs/runbooks that do not change normative trust semantics

## Not sufficient

- “We’ll SPEC it after the audit loop”
- Shipping `hardware` (or equivalent) from best-effort MDM/probe code and
  discovering binding/durability rules only in review
