## Exit code semantics for our CLI tool

Follow these conventions for signifying the success or failure of operations in our CLI wrapper:

*   **`0` (Success):** The command executed successfully, and all primary requested operations were successful. For batch operations, this means all specified targets were processed successfully (or reported as already in the desired state, e.g., "item already in collection").
*   **`1` (Runtime Error / Partial Success / Actionable Failure):**
    *   A general runtime error occurred (e.g., network issue, unexpected Python exception).
    *   A specific, actionable error from the Zotero API (e.g., invalid API key, permissions issue, rate limit, server error).
    *   **Crucially for "Not Found":** If the *primary target(s)* of a command are not found.
        *   For single-target commands (e.g., `get item X`): If X is not found, exit `1`.
        *   For batch commands (e.g., `delete item X Y Z`): If *any* of X, Y, or Z are not found, the command should ideally exit `1` (or a distinct code like `3`).
*   **`2` (Usage Error):** Incorrect command-line flags, missing arguments, invalid option values. (Click handles this well with `UsageError`).

## Error message formatting conventions for our CLI tool

*   Use `handle_zotero_exceptions_and_exit` from `pyzotero_cli/utils.py` as the primary handler for PyZotero API errors.
*   For non-API errors, use the appropriate helper from `pyzotero_cli/utils.py`:
    *   **Usage errors** (incorrect command-line flags, missing arguments, invalid option values): Use `create_usage_error()` → **Exit code 2**
    *   **Runtime errors** (input validation, file not found, processing errors): Use `create_click_exception()` → **Exit code 1**
*   Use a consistent format: `Error: <Brief, user-friendly problem description>. [Context: <Relevant key/value if applicable>]. [Details: <Optional snippet from underlying error if concise and useful>]. [Hint: <Optional user action>]`.
*   All error messages to `stderr`.
*   Both helper functions automatically format messages according to the standard format above.
