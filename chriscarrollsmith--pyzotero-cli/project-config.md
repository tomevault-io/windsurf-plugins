## `pyzotero` exception types

Import `pyzotero` exception types from `pyzotero.zotero_errors` where necessary to catch and handle them. Here are the available types, with their use cases and status codes (where applicable):

*   `PyZoteroError`: Generic parent exception.
*   `ParamNotPassedError`: Raised if a required parameter isn't passed.
*   `CallDoesNotExistError`: Raised if the specified API call doesn't exist.
*   `UnsupportedParamsError`: Raised when unsupported parameters are passed.
*   `UserNotAuthorisedError`: Raised when the user is not allowed to retrieve the resource.
*   `TooManyItemsError`: Raised when too many items are passed to a Write API method.
*   `MissingCredentialsError`: Raised when an attempt is made to create a Zotero instance without providing both the user ID and the user key.
*   `InvalidItemFieldsError`: Raised when an attempt is made to create/update items with invalid fields.
*   `ResourceNotFoundError`: Raised when a resource (item, collection etc.) could not be found.
*   `HTTPError`: Raised for miscellaneous URLLib errors.
*   `CouldNotReachURLError`: Raised when a URL can't be reached.
*   `ConflictError` (409): Raised when the target library is locked.
*   `PreConditionFailedError` (412): Raised when the provided X-Zotero-Write-Token has already been submitted.
*   `RequestEntityTooLargeError` (413): Raised when an upload would exceed the storage quota of the library owner.
*   `PreConditionRequiredError` (428): Raised when If-Match or If-None-Match was not provided.
*   `TooManyRequestsError` (429): Raised when there are too many unfinished uploads.
*   `FileDoesNotExistError`: Raised when a file path to be attached can't be opened or doesn't exist.
*   `TooManyRetriesError`: Raised after the backoff period for new requests exceeds 32 seconds.
*   `UploadError`: Raised if the connection drops during upload or some other non-HTTP error code is returned.

Where possible, any ``ZoteroError`` which is raised will preserve the underlying error in its ``__cause__`` and ``__context__`` properties, should you wish to work with these directly.
